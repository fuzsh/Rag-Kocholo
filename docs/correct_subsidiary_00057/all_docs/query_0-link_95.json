BUSINESS.\n\nI. GENERAL\n\nLucent Technologies Inc. (\"Lucent\") was incorporated in Delaware in\n\nNovember 1995. Lucent has its principal executive offices at 600 Mountain\n\nAvenue, Murray Hill, New Jersey 07974 (telephone number 908-582-8500). Lucent\n\nwas formed from the systems and technology units that were formerly a part of\n\nAT&T Corp. (\"AT&T\"), including the research and development capabilities of Bell\n\nLaboratories. Prior to February 1, 1996, AT&T conducted Lucent's original\n\nbusiness through various divisions and subsidiaries. On February 1, 1996, AT&T\n\nbegan executing its decision to separate Lucent into a stand-alone company (the\n\n\"Separation\") by transferring to Lucent the assets and liabilities related to\n\nits business. In April 1996, Lucent completed the initial public offering\n\n(\"IPO\") of its common stock and on September 30, 1996, became independent of\n\nAT&T when AT&T distributed to its shareowners all of its Lucent shares. Lucent's\n\nfiscal year begins October 1 and ends September 30.\n\nOn September 30, 2000 Lucent completed its plan to spin off its enterprise\n\nnetworks business, forming a separate and independent company. The spin off of\n\nthe new company, Avaya Inc., was accomplished through a tax-free distribution of\n\nshares to Lucent shareholders. On July 20, 2000, Lucent announced its intention\n\nto spin off its microelectronics business, which includes the optoelectronics\n\ncomponents and integrated circuits divisions, into a separate, independent\n\ncompany called Agere Systems Inc. (\"Agere Systems\"). On December 11, 2000 Agere\n\nSystems filed a Form S-1 registration statement with the Securities and Exchange\n\nCommission (the \"SEC\") in anticipation of an IPO of Agere Systems and intends to\n\ndistribute the remaining shares in a tax-free distribution. This report does not\n\nconstitute an offering of any securities, which will be made only by a\n\nprospectus filed with the SEC. The IPO is expected to be completed in the\n\nquarter ending March 31, 2001, and the completion of the spin-off is expected by\n\nthe end of the 2001 fiscal year. The IPO and spin-off are subject to certain\n\nconditions, including a favorable tax ruling by the IRS. On November 13, 2000\n\nLucent entered into an agreement to sell its power systems business to Tyco\n\nInternational Ltd., a diversified manufacturing and service company, for $2.5\n\nbillion in cash. The sale, which is subject to regulatory approval and other\n\ncustomary closing conditions, is expected to close by December 31, 2000.\n\nLucent is one of the world's leading designers, developers and\n\nmanufacturers of communications systems, software and products. Lucent is a\n\nglobal leader in the sale of public and private communications systems,\n\nsupplying systems and software to most of the world's largest communications\n\nnetwork operators and service providers (together referred to as \"service\n\nproviders\"). Lucent is also a global leader in the sale of microelectronic\n\ncomponents for communications applications to manufacturers of communications\n\nsystems and computers. Lucent's research and development activities are\n\nconducted through Bell Laboratories (\"Bell Labs\"), one of the world's foremost\n\nindustrial research and development organizations.\n\nThe communications industry is experiencing rapid changes in the\n\ntechnologies used to service customers' needs. Traditional circuit based\n\nswitching and data packet transmission are converging. This convergence of\n\ntechnologies is driven by the growing demands on the transmission of information\n\nusing data, voice, video and fax, or any combination of these. The demand is\n\ndriven by the expansion of Internet traffic over existing networks -- both\n\nwireline and wireless -- as well as the buildout of new and improved networks.\n\nLucent's strategy is to meet its customers' needs by offering an end-to-end\n\nsolutions platform, which brings together Lucent's core products with new\n\nofferings obtained through strategic acquisitions and the research and\n\ndevelopment of Bell Laboratories. This strategy brings together products related\n\nto data, voice, optical, wireless, software, services and support.\n\nLucent has two reportable segments: Service Provider Networks (\"SPN\") and\n\nMicroelectronics and Communications Technologies (\"MCT\"). SPN provides public\n\nnetworking systems and software to telecommunications service providers and\n\npublic network operators around the world. MCT designs and manufactures\n\nhigh-performance integrated circuits, power systems, optical fiber and fiber\n\ncables, and optoelectronic components for applications in the communications and\n\ncomputing industries. These two reportable operating\n\n4\n\n5\n\nsegments are strategic market units based on the customers and the markets\n\nserved. For further information about Lucent's segments and products, see Note\n\n14 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\n\nII. SERVICE PROVIDER NETWORKS\n\nA. General\n\nLucent designs, develops, manufactures and services systems, including\n\nsoftware, which enable service providers to provide wireline and wireless\n\naccess, local, long distance and international voice, data and video and cable\n\nservices. The SPN segment includes the product groups responsible for Lucent's\n\noptical networking, switching solutions, access, wireless networks and software\n\nproducts businesses. It also includes the businesses which are focused on the\n\nneeds of cable television operators and data networking systems for service\n\nproviders as well as the sales and support organizations responsible for offers,\n\nsales, distribution, installation and maintenance for service provider customers\n\nworldwide.\n\nLucent's systems connect, route, manage and store voice, data and video in\n\nany combination, and are used for: wireline access; local and long distance\n\nswitching; intelligent network services and signaling; wireless communications,\n\nincluding both cellular and personal communications services (\"PCS\"); and\n\nhigh-speed, broadband multi-functional communications. Lucent has a wireline\n\nlocal access installed base (the number of access lines serviced by switches\n\nmanufactured by Lucent) of approximately 150 million lines.\n\nLucent designs, develops, manufactures, sells, and services each of the\n\nfive broad elements that comprise communications networks for service providers:\n\nswitching systems, which route information through the network; transmission\n\nsystems (including optical networking and access products) which provide the\n\ncommunications path through the network that carries information between points\n\nin the network as well as to and from subscribers; operation support systems,\n\nwhich enable service providers to manage the work flow, planning, surveillance,\n\nmanagement, provisioning and continuous testing of their networks; intelligent\n\nnetwork/application software, which enables service providers to offer a broad\n\narray of enhanced and differentiated services; and cable systems, which provide\n\nthe transport media between points in a network. These systems collectively\n\ncomprise the infrastructure that enables communications service providers to\n\nprovide traditional narrow band voice and data services and enables both new and\n\ntraditional network operators to offer broadband multi-media services.\n\nIn fiscal year 2000, Lucent acquired several companies related to the SPN\n\nsegment's business, including Chromatis Networks and Spring Tide Networks.\n\nB. Switching Solutions\n\nLucent manufactures, develops, markets and manages switching products and\n\nsoftware for the service provider market. Lucent's primary switching solutions\n\nproducts include:\n\n- 7R/E(TM) Packet Solutions -- An entire portfolio of packet data\n\nnetworking products that deliver traditional telephony as well as data\n\nfeatures and services within a packet environment. Applications cover the\n\nentire range of service providers and network operators regardless of\n\nnetwork size or scope.\n\n- 5ESS(R) Switch -- The most highly-deployed circuit switching solution in\n\ntoday's global network. Its evolution capabilities allow for complete\n\nmigration to packet; scaleable for both incumbent and emerging network\n\noperators and service providers from 3,000 subscribers and higher.\n\n- Lucent SoftSwitch (and Full Circle(SM) Program) -- Robust, programmable\n\ncall control and signable platform; targeted at entire range of service\n\nproviders and network operators regardless of network size or scope; also\n\ntargeted at a large audience of 3rd party application and service\n\ndevelopers.\n\n- ExchangePlus EXS(R) and VSE(TM) Switches -- A scaleable, converged\n\nsolution providing tandem, international gateway and/or IP application\n\nservers, targeted at networks of up to 30,000 ports.\n\n- Packet Intelligent Networks -- Carrier grade solutions for wireline and\n\nmobile internet applications.\n\n- Messaging Solutions -- Voice mail, unified messaging, agent and portal\n\nsolutions for service providers.\n\n5\n\n6\n\nC. Optical Networking\n\nLucent designs, manufactures and markets optical networking systems,\n\noffering a complete portfolio of optical networking products. Lucent's family of\n\noptical networking systems provides service providers with fast, efficient\n\ninformation transport over fiber-optic lines. The enabler of optical networking\n\nis photonics, a technology that uses light particles, or photons, to transport\n\ninformation over hair-thin glass fibers.\n\nMost transmission systems currently comply with one of two similar\n\nstandards designed to promote the implementation of maximum transmission\n\ncapacity with the greatest simplicity and lowest cost for service providers. The\n\nSynchronous Optical Network (\"SONET\") standard has been widely adopted in North\n\nAmerica. The Synchronized Digital Hierarchy (\"SDH\") predominates throughout the\n\nrest of the world. Lucent markets transmission access systems supporting both\n\nstandards.\n\nLucent's primary optical networking products include:\n\n- Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing (\"DWDM\") systems such as the\n\nWaveStar(TM) 40G OLS and 400G OLS which use prism-like technology to\n\ncombine the information generated by up to 80 individual lasers onto a\n\nsingle strand of fiber-optic cable.\n\n- Systems that automatically route large amounts of information from fiber\n\nto fiber, such as the WaveStar(TM) Bandwidth Manager and WaveStar(TM)\n\nLambda Router(TM) Switches.\n\n- Systems that combine many low-speed electronic signals into a single\n\nhigh-speed signal, and then convert that signal to an optical signal for\n\ntransmission over fiber-optic cable. Examples include the current SONET\n\nand SDH product lines (FT 2000, DDM 2000, ISM 2000, SLM 2000) as well as\n\nthe new global product line (WaveStar(TM) 2.5G, WaveStar(TM) 10G,\n\nWaveStar(TM) 40G Express).\n\nD. Wireless Products\n\nLucent manufactures and markets total-system solutions for the global\n\nwireless networks industry. Lucent provides end-to-end capabilities for\n\noperators to plan, deploy, operate and maintain mobile and fixed wireless\n\nnetworks to maximum efficiency, and to competitively meet their customers'\n\nneeds. Lucent's portfolio includes Mobile Switching Centers, base station\n\nproducts, and network support software. Lucent also provides global customer\n\ntechnical support and training.\n\nLucent's solutions for wireless network operators encompass all of the\n\nmajor wireless mobile network standards, including AMPS, TDMA, CDMA and GSM,\n\nspreading over a broad frequency spectrum including: 800 MHz, 900 MHz, 1800 MHz\n\nor 1900 MHz. Lucent's solutions offer scaleable platforms for wireless services\n\nthat are fully compatible with the larger telecommunications environment of\n\ntoday, yet are able to evolve to next-generation networks including those that\n\nwill make use of new varying technologies collectively referred to as Third\n\nGeneration or 3G, including UMTS (Universal Mobile Telecommunications Service),\n\nthat will provide enhanced capacity and improved internet access and facilitate\n\nthe provision of sophisticated, high speed data applications.\n\nLucent's primary wireless product families include:\n\n- Mobile Switching centers that provide the transfer of calls within the\n\nwireless network and interface to the public switched telephone networks.\n\n- Operations and maintenance centers which are software systems allowing\n\nfor the provisioning, diagnostics and administration of the wireless\n\nnetworks.\n\n- Base station systems that are the radio systems that transmit and receive\n\nsubscriber calls and manage handoffs as customers move from cell to cell.\n\n6\n\n7\n\nE. Software Products\n\nLucent develops open, standards-based, multi-vendor software products and\n\nservices to help service providers manage their complex, converging voice and\n\ndata networks. Lucent's portfolio of software solutions includes software for\n\nnetwork and service management, billing and customer care.\n\nLucent's primary software products represent Operations Support Software\n\nwhich provides established and growing service providers with service ready\n\nsolution sets that include: convergent customer care and billing management;\n\nmultiple switching software platforms; network performance and assurance; number\n\nportability; service activation, provisioning, and management; transport\n\nprovisioning; and wireless/mobile network management. Some of our modular,\n\nscalable, leading-edge software products include: Arbor(R) Product Suite,\n\nActiview(R) Service Management, ConnectVu(TM) Configuration Management,\n\nIntegrated Transport Management, Mechanized Loop Testing, NetMinder(TM) System\n\nNetwork Performance, Network Fault Management, and OneVision(R) Network\n\nManagement Solution.\n\nF. Data Networking -- Service Providers and Access\n\nLucent develops, markets, sells and services data networking solutions for\n\nservice provider customers worldwide. For the service provider market, Lucent's\n\nproduct and services portfolio includes WAN Access, Multiservice Core Switching,\n\nVoice-over-Packet/Cell, Secure VPN, Digital Subscriber Line (xDSL), Metropolitan\n\nOptical Network, and Network Management.\n\nLucent's primary data networking and access solutions for service providers\n\ninclude:\n\n- GRF multigigabit routers which deliver high performance in dynamic\n\nheavy-traffic IP networking environments. Routers are network controllers\n\nthat determine the best routing for data transmission between end\n\nstations. They perform their operations by looking at network layer\n\ninformation found in data packets and either forwarding the packets\n\ndirectly to a destination or sending them through a series of\n\nintermediate devices.\n\n- The MAX TNT(R) multiprotocol WAN access switch enables carriers, ISPs,\n\ncorporations, and major network providers to offer a variety of access\n\nservices such as analog, ISDN, leased T1/E1, and frame relay. Because the\n\nMAX TNT is the highest-density product in its class, it dramatically\n\nreduces rack space requirements while driving down the price per port.\n\n- The GX Smart Core ATM product family which includes the GX 550 Smart Core\n\nATM Switch, a scalable, high-capacity switching system that provides the\n\nnecessary capacity, performance, and port fanout capabilities for carrier\n\nservices. ATM switches incorporate a cell-based switching and\n\nmultiplexing communications technology which permits transportation of\n\nsubstantially all traffic types (e.g., video, voice, data, interactive\n\nvideo, etc.). ATM is a connection-oriented technology, i.e., before data\n\ncan be transferred, a connection between the sending and receiving nodes\n\nmust be established.\n\n- The NX64000 multi-terabit switch/router, is an architectural innovation\n\nthat provides high-speed optical interfaces and integrates substantially\n\nall of the key core requirements onto a single, carrier-class\n\nmulti-service device. It provides features of ATM switches and\n\nhigh-capacity routers.\n\n- B-STDX Multiservice wide area network (\"WAN\") switches (deployed to build\n\ncore frame relay networks), carrier-class switches which are evolving as\n\nan access point to the next-generation WAN with the addition of\n\ninternetworking modules for IP and ATM services for high-speed trunking\n\nand low-speed converged access. Frame relay technology allows bits to be\n\npackaged and sent out into the network with source and destination\n\naddresses. Products include the B-STDX 8000, B-STDX 9000 and B-STDX 8200.\n\nAnother Lucent multi-service WAN switch is the CBXTM 500 which is of\n\ngreater bandwidth than the B-STDX family of products. In addition, Lucent\n\nhas its MAX family of WAN access switches.\n\n- The Stinger(TM) DSL Access Concentrator, is a new carrier class DSL\n\naccess concentrator. Access concentrators are call aggregation devices\n\ndesigned for large dial-in applications such as Internet service\n\nproviders. They aggregate analog and digital calls over channelized lines\n\nsuch as T1/E1 and\n\n7\n\n8\n\nT3/E3. The Stinger offers features that ATM brings to multi-service\n\nnetworks, including effective bandwidth management and high availability.\n\nAddressing the needs of carriers implementing cell-based backbone\n\nnetworks, it features high-capacity traffic aggregation capabilities and\n\nperformance. Other DSL access concentrators include the DSLTNT, DSL MAX\n\n20 and the DSL Terminator 100 Access Concentrators.\n\nG. NetworkCare(R) Professional Services -- Service Providers and Engineering\n\nServices\n\nLucent's NetworkCare(SM) Professional Services provides a comprehensive\n\nsuite of value added services in the communications industry. These services\n\nincludes the full lifecycle of planning, design, implementation and operations\n\nsupport services that allow customers to manage their networks.\n\nThe NetworkCare Professional Services provides network planning and design,\n\nconsulting, integration and support services, including remote diagnostics and\n\naround-the-clock network monitoring services. In addition, NetworkCare\n\nProfessional Services offers specialized solutions focused on clients' network\n\nsecurity, performance and service level management, Microsoft Windows 2000, and\n\nvoice/data convergence requirements.\n\nThe NetworkCare Network Services unit is focused on network engineering,\n\nprovisioning, installation, and warranty and post-warranty support. In addition,\n\nNetworkCare Network Services offers specialized solutions for system upgrades\n\nand conversions, system health assessments, capacity planning, network\n\noptimization, and program/project management services of complex network\n\nimplementations.\n\nH. Markets/Sales/Distribution\n\nThe principal customers for Lucent's systems in the SPN segment are service\n\nproviders that provide wireline and wireless local, long distance and\n\ninternational telecommunications services, including local, long distance and\n\ninternational telecommunications companies, cable television companies and\n\ninternet service providers. Lucent's systems for service providers are installed\n\nto expand the capacity and features offered by existing networks, to replace\n\nolder technology in existing networks and to establish new networks for entrants\n\ninto deregulated or previously unserved markets. See \"Outlook -- Reliance on\n\nMajor Customers/Multi-Year Contracts.\"\n\nAs a result of structural, public policy and technological changes since\n\nthe mid-1980's, the telecommunications industry has undergone a period of\n\nsignificant growth in the number of lines in service and applications offered.\n\nIn developed markets, deregulation has permitted new market entrants to\n\nconstruct networks. In response, existing service providers have expanded beyond\n\ntraditional offerings and are offering new services. In emerging markets,\n\nprivatization, competition and economic expansion have increased demand for the\n\nsystems marketed by the SPN business and its competitors. At the same time,\n\ntechnological advances also have increased demand by reducing operating costs\n\nand facilitating new applications, including multi-functional services.\n\nLucent markets and sells its SPN systems worldwide, primarily through a\n\ndirect sales force. Many of SPNs sales are made pursuant to general purchase\n\nagreements, which establish the terms and conditions and provide for price\n\ndetermination to be made on a contract bid basis. In addition, certain of the\n\nlarge infrastructure projects are conducted under long-term, fixed-price\n\ncontracts. See \"Outlook -- Reliance on Major Customers/Multi-Year Contracts.\"\n\nAs a result of the increasing complexity of SPN systems and the high cost\n\nof developing and maintaining in-house expertise, service providers typically\n\ndemand complete, integrated turn-key projects. Service providers are\n\nincreasingly seeking overall network or systems solutions that require an\n\nincreased software content which would enable them to rapidly deploy new and\n\ndifferentiable services. In response, Lucent has formed an organization focused\n\non turn-key network engineering projects for both public and private sector\n\ncustomers. Lucent markets integrated solutions for the project and engineers,\n\ndesigns and installs the network, including equipment and software manufactured\n\nby both Lucent and third parties.\n\n8\n\n9\n\nIncreasingly, as a result of the financial demands of major network\n\ndeployments, service providers are looking to their suppliers to arrange for\n\nfinancing. The ability to provide financing is a requirement to conduct business\n\nin certain emerging U.S. and non-U.S. markets and in some cases Lucent furnishes\n\nor guarantees financing for customers. As a result, Lucent works with its\n\ncustomers to structure and lay off financing packages. See also,\n\n\"Outlook -- Future Capital Requirements.\"\n\nIn order to market its product line for service products worldwide, Lucent\n\nhas established wholly-owned subsidiaries and joint ventures with local\n\ncompanies in many countries.\n\nI. Competition\n\nLucent believes that its key competitive assets in the SPN segment are its\n\nbroad product line, large installed base, relationship with key customers,\n\ntechnological expertise and new product and software development capabilities.\n\nLucent's primary competitors in the service provider market are four very large\n\nEuropean and North American companies which have substantial technological and\n\nfinancial resources and which offer similar broad product catalogs. These\n\ncompetitors are Alcatel Alsthom, Nortel Networks Corporation, Siemens AG and\n\nTelefonaktiebolaget LM Ericsson.\n\nIn addition, in each of Lucent's product areas covered in the SPN segment,\n\nLucent faces significant competition from other companies which do business in\n\none or a number of such product areas. For example, in wireless systems,\n\nMotorola, Inc. and Nokia Corporation, which are very large companies with\n\nsubstantial technological and financial resources, are two additional\n\nsignificant competitors. In optical networking and software products,\n\ncompetition in the markets includes Nortel Networks Corporation and hundreds of\n\nsmaller competitors. Lucent is also encountering competition from companies that\n\ndesign and manufacture data networking equipment such as Cisco Systems Inc. As\n\nLucent continues to expand its SPN business, it is likely that other competitors\n\nwill arise in each new technology or market area.\n\nJ. Customer Dependency\n\nA limited number of customers have provided a substantial portion of SPN's\n\nrevenues. These customers include Verizon, AT&T and certain incumbent and\n\ncompetitive local exchange carriers. The spending patterns of these customers\n\ncan vary significantly during the year. An elimination or change in the spending\n\npatterns of, or a significant reduction in orders from, any one of these\n\ncustomers could negatively affect SPN's operating results. SPN's fiscal year\n\n2000 results were negatively affected by the decline in sales to one large U.S.\n\ncustomer as well as one large non-U.S. customer due to the completion of a\n\nmulti-year contract. Concurrent with this consolidation among the larger service\n\nproviders, the dynamics of the marketplace have created opportunities for new\n\ncompetitors to enter the market. Lucent is diversifying its customer base in the\n\nSPN segment and seeking out new types of customers globally. These new customers\n\ninclude competitive access providers and local exchange carriers, wireless\n\nservice providers, cable television network operators and internet service\n\nproviders. See also, \"Outlook -- Reliance on Major Customers.\"\n\nK. Sources and Availability of Raw Materials\n\nLucent makes significant purchases of electronic components, copper, glass,\n\nsilicon, and other materials and components from many U.S. and non-U.S. sources.\n\nWhile there are some shortages in electrical components and some other\n\nmaterials, Lucent has generally been able to obtain sufficient materials and\n\ncomponents from sources around the world to meet its needs, although there may\n\nbe temporary delays. Lucent also develops and maintains alternative sources for\n\nessential materials and components. Occasionally, additional inventories of\n\nspecific components are maintained to minimize the effects of potential\n\nshortages. Lucent does not have a concentration of sources of supply of\n\nmaterials, labor or services that, if suddenly eliminated, could severely impact\n\nits operations.\n\nL. Seasonality\n\nRevenues and earnings from the SPN segment do not follow a consistent\n\npattern and are not materially seasonal.\n\n9\n\n10\n\nM. Intellectual Property -- See \"Patents, Trademarks and Other Intellectual\n\nProperty\"\n\nN. Industry Practices Impacting Working Capital\n\nExisting industry practices that affect working capital and operating cash\n\nflow include the level and variability of customer orders relative to the volume\n\nof production, vendor lead times and/or materials availability for critical high\n\ndollar parts, inventory levels held to achieve rapid customer fulfillment, the\n\nprovisions of extended payment terms to customers, the provision of return/stock\n\nrotation rights for certain key customers and distributors and the extension of\n\nfinancing terms.

Optoelectronics\n\nLucent designs, develops and manufactures optoelectronic products which\n\nconvert electricity to light (emitters) and light to electricity (detectors),\n\nthereby facilitating optical transmission of information. These products include\n\nsemiconductor lasers, photodetectors, integrated transmitters and receivers and\n\nadvanced-technology erbium-doped fiber amplifiers. Lucent provides these\n\nproducts worldwide to manufacturers serving the telecommunications, cable\n\ntelevision and network computing markets. Optoelectronic products extend the\n\ntransmission capacity of fiber to meet the requirements of such applications as\n\ninternet access video-on-demand, interactive video, teleconferencing, image\n\ntransmission and remote database searching. Lucent markets a number of advanced\n\nproducts, including optoelectronic components that support telecommunication\n\ntransmission; long-wavelength optical data modules for data networking; and\n\nanalog lasers for use in cable television fiber optic transmission.\n\nLucent's primary optoelectronic product groups include:\n\n- High-Speed Transport Products, including lasers, modulators, transmitters\n\nand receivers that enable high speed fiber optic communications.

With 12\n\ncable manufacturing facilities around the world, Lucent is one of the world's\n\nleading suppliers of optical fiber cables.\n\nLucent's primary fiber optic products include:\n\n- Applications based fibers (TrueWave(R) optical fiber family for submarine\n\nand long haul, and AllWave(TM) fiber for metropolitan networks).\n\n- AllWave Advantage(TM), a optical end to end fiber cable and connectivity\n\nsolution for metro AllWave fiber based networks.\n\n- Smart fiber monitoring and connectorization systems (Smart LGX).\n\nE. Intellectual Property Licensing\n\nThe intellectual property licensing organization has the responsibility to\n\nlicense, protect, and maintain Lucent's intellectual property and to enforce the\n\ncompany's intellectual property rights. This responsibility includes the\n\nlicensing of Lucent's patents and technology to third parties and negotiating\n\nagreements regarding Lucent's licensing of intellectual property from others.\n\nF. Market/Sales/Distribution\n\nLucent's MCT products are sold globally to service providers and\n\nmanufacturers of communications systems and computers through a combination of\n\ndirect sales, manufacturers' representatives and distributors. In addition,\n\nLucent's energy power systems and fiber optics generally are sold directly to\n\nU.S. and foreign service providers. Lucent's MCT customers are competing in\n\nmarkets characterized by rapid technological changes, decreasing product life\n\ncycles, price competition and increased user applications. These markets have\n\n11\n\n12\n\nexperienced significant expansion in the number and types of products and\n\nservices they offer to end-users, particularly in personal computing, portable\n\naccess communication devices and expanded networking capability. As a result,\n\nLucent's MCT customers continue to demand products which are smaller, require\n\nless power, are more complex, provide greater functionality and are produced\n\nwith shorter design cycles and less manufacturing lead time.\n\nIn addition to the revenues from sales to third parties, ICs, power\n\nsystems, optoelectronic products and fiber optics are also key components of\n\nLucent's systems sold to the SPN segment. These MCT products compete with\n\nproducts of third party manufacturers for inclusion in Lucent's SPN systems and\n\nproducts.\n\nLucent has traditionally sold its power products via direct sales to large\n\nservice providers and OEM's. Lucent has increased market coverage to both\n\nService Provider and OEM customers by building indirect sales channels.\n\nG. Competition\n\nLucent considers its product leadership and relationships with key\n\ncustomers to be important competitive assets. The market for MCT products is\n\nglobal and generally highly fragmented. Lucent's competitors differ widely among\n\nproduct categories. Lucent's competitors in certain IC product categories\n\ninclude Texas Instruments Incorporated, Conexant Systems Incorporated,\n\nSTMicroelectronics Incorporated and LSI Logic Corp.; in electronic power\n\nsystems, competitors include Astec, a subsidiary of Emerson Electric Co.,\n\nArtesyn Technologies Inc. and Marconi plc; in optoelectronics, competitors\n\ninclude Fujitsu Limited, Nortel Networks Corporation and JDS Uniphase\n\nCorporation; and in optical fiber, competitors include Corning, Siecor, Alcatel,\n\nand Societe Internationale Pirelli.\n\nLucent believes that key competitive factors in the microelectronics and\n\ncommunications technology marketplace are the early involvement in customers'\n\nfuture applications requirements, the speed of product and technological\n\ninnovation, price, customer service and manufacturing capacity. Other important\n\ncompetitive factors include quality, reliability and local manufacturing\n\npresence.\n\nH. Customer Dependency\n\nLucent sells its MCT products to a wide variety of global electronic\n\nsystems manufacturers and service providers. Over the past several years, the\n\nproportion of revenues gained from customers outside of Lucent has increased.\n\nBecause of the high fixed-cost nature of many MCT manufacturing processes, the\n\nloss of any significant customer could have a material adverse effect on\n\nLucent's operating results in the MCT segment. See also, \"Outlook -- Reliance on\n\nMajor Customers\".\n\nI. Sources and Availability of Raw Materials\n\nDemand for optoelectronic components is greater than the ability of most\n\nmanufacturers of optoelectronic components, including us, to supply products.\n\nLucent has supply limitations that we believe most of our competitors also have.\n\nAlthough we have not experienced any significant difficulties in purchasing\n\nthese components, we are currently looking to expand alternative sources of\n\nthese components. The loss of a significant supplier or the inability of a\n\nsignificant supplier to meet performance and quality specifications or delivery\n\nschedules could have a material adverse effect on our business and\n\nprofitability.\n\nJ. Seasonality\n\nThe MCT segment may experience variability in revenues due to changes in\n\nmarket conditions, the timing of product development cycles and the life cycle\n\nof major programs by customers. However, the MCT segment is not materially\n\nseasonal.\n\n12\n\n13\n\nK. Intellectual Property -- See \"Patents, Trademarks and Other Intellectual\n\nProperty\"\n\nL. Industry Practices Impacting Working Capital -- See \"Outlook -- Future\n\nCapital Requirements\"\n\nIV. BELL LABORATORIES\n\nLucent's SPN and MCT segments have been and will continue to be supported\n\nby the technological expertise provided by Bell Labs, one of the world's\n\nforemost industrial research and development organizations. Bell Labs provides\n\nsupport for the businesses of Lucent and conducts basic research. Bell Labs has\n\nmade significant discoveries and advances in communications science and\n\ntechnology, software design and engineering and networking. These contributions\n\ninclude the invention of the transistor and the design and development of ICs\n\nand many types of lasers. Areas of Bell Labs research and development work in\n\nrecent years include: networking software; data networking; lightwave\n\ntransmission, especially the wavelength division multiplexing systems (\"WDM\")\n\nwhich offer greater transmission capacity than other transmission systems;\n\nelectronic switching technology, which enables rapid call processing, increased\n\nreliability and reduced network costs; and microelectronics components, which\n\nbring the latest advantages of very large scale integration to the full range of\n\nproducts offered by the Company. Bell Labs' research and development activities\n\ncontinue to focus on the core technologies critical to Lucent's success, which\n\nare software, network design and engineering, microelectronics, photonics, data\n\nnetworking and wireless/cellular.\n\nBell Labs is a leader in software research, development and engineering for\n\ncommunications applications. For example, its innovations in fault-tolerant\n\nsoftware have enabled Lucent to achieve a level of system reliability with\n\noff-the-shelf commercial processors that allows Lucent to reduce its reliance on\n\ncustom microprocessors.\n\nBell Labs has contributed many innovations in voice quality, is a leader in\n\nthe development of digital signal processing, and has developed a number of\n\ninnovative algorithms for high-quality speech and audio. These innovations have\n\ncontributed to Lucent's implementation of speech processing applications which\n\ninclude text-to-speech synthesis, speech recognition and automatic translation\n\nof speech from one language to another. They are used in many of Lucent's\n\nproducts, including the elemedia(R) products for Internet applications, and are\n\nsold to outside customers.\n\nBell Labs also has led in the development of software-based networking\n\ntechnologies that support Lucent's systems and products. Recently, it has\n\ndeveloped systems for digital cellular, PCS, mobile computing and wireless LANs.\n\nBell Lab's technology has allowed the recent introduction of data networking\n\nproducts such as the Internet Telephony Server SP, PacketStar(R) IP switch,\n\nPacketStar(R) IP Services platform and the WaveStar 400G high capacity WDM\n\noptical networking system.\n\nSimilarly, Bell Labs' advances extend to the microlasers used in today's\n\nbroadband multifunctional transmission systems, and to today's optical\n\namplifiers and TrueWave fiber. Current photonic research includes work on\n\npassive optical networks, photonic switching and quantum wire lasers.\n\nV. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS\n\nLucent is in the process of reorganizing its business to become more\n\nfocused and better positioned to capitalize on market opportunities. This\n\nreorganization includes the recent spin-off of Avaya, the expected sale of the\n\npower systems business, and the announced IPO and spin-off of Agere Systems, as\n\nwell as a comprehensive review and restructuring of Lucent's internal systems\n\nand processes. Specific initiatives include performing a comprehensive product\n\nand service portfolio review aimed at aligning research and development and\n\neffective redeployment of sales and marketing teams and other investments as\n\nappropriate, consolidating corporate infrastructure and improving supply chain\n\nmanagement. The spin-off of Agere Systems is expected to be completed by\n\nSeptember 30, 2001. For a discussion of an anticipated substantial decline in\n\nrevenues and a substantial loss from continuing operations, along with lowered\n\ncredit ratings and expected restructuring charges, please see \"Key Business\n\nChallenges\" in Item 7.\n\n13\n\n14\n\nVI. BACKLOG\n\nLucent's backlog, calculated as the aggregate of the sales price of orders\n\nreceived from customers less revenue recognized, was approximately $8.7 billion\n\nand $6.3 billion on September 30, 2000 and 1999, respectively. Of these amounts,\n\napproximately $1.9 billion and $600 million at September 30, 2000 and 1999,\n\nrespectively, was attributable to the microelectronics business which will be\n\nspun off as Agere Systems. Approximately $1.2 billion of the orders included in\n\nthe September 30, 2000 backlog are scheduled for delivery after September 30,\n\n2001. However, all orders are subject to possible rescheduling by customers.\n\nAlthough Lucent believes that the orders included in the backlog are firm, some\n\norders may be canceled by the customer without penalty, and Lucent may elect to\n\npermit cancellation of orders without penalty where management believes that it\n\nis in Lucent's best interest to do so. About $330 million of the amount at\n\nSeptember 30, 2000 is under large, multi-year contracts of which about $110\n\nmillion is scheduled for delivery after September 30, 2001 and is included in\n\nthe $1.2 billion referred to above.\n\nVII. PATENTS, TRADEMARKS AND OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS\n\nFrom October 1, 1997 to September 30, 2000, Lucent was issued 4,000 patents\n\nin the United States. Lucent owns approximately 10,000 patents in the United\n\nStates and 15,000 in foreign countries. These foreign patents are, for the most\n\npart, counterparts of Lucent's United States patents. Many of the patents owned\n\nby Lucent are licensed to others and Lucent is licensed to use certain patents\n\nowned by others. In connection with the Separation, Lucent has entered into an\n\nextensive cross-licensing agreement with AT&T and NCR Corporation. See also,\n\n\"Separation Agreements -- AT&T -- Patent Licenses and Related Matters.\"\n\nLucent markets its products primarily under its own name and mark. Lucent\n\nconsiders its many trademarks to be valuable assets. Many of its trademarks are\n\nregistered throughout the world.\n\nLucent relies on patent, trademark, trade secret and copyright laws both to\n\nprotect its proprietary technology and to protect Lucent against claims from\n\nothers. Lucent believes that it has direct intellectual property rights or\n\nrights under cross-licensing arrangements covering substantially all of its\n\nmaterial technologies. Given the technological complexity of Lucent's systems\n\nand products, however, there can be no assurance that claims of infringement\n\nwill not be asserted against Lucent or against Lucent's customers in connection\n\nwith their use of Lucent's systems and products, nor can there be any assurance\n\nas to the outcome of any such claims. Lucent was assigned ownership of the\n\nsubstantial majority of AT&T's patents in connection with the Separation.\n\nPursuant to the patent license agreement entered into among Lucent, AT&T and\n\nNCR, Lucent has been given rights, subject to specified limitations, to pass\n\nthrough to its customers certain rights under approximately 400 patents retained\n\nby AT&T.\n\nLucent and Avaya executed and delivered assignments and other agreements\n\nrelated to patents, technology, and trademarks owned by Lucent. Lucent assigned\n\nto Avaya or its subsidiaries approximately 800 issued U.S. patents and their\n\ncorresponding foreign counterparts relating principally to the businesses of\n\nAvaya. Lucent assigned to Avaya certain technology, including trade secrets,\n\nsoftware, and copyrights, principally relating to the Avaya businesses. Lucent\n\nalso assigned to Avaya several hundred trademarks principally relating to the\n\nAvaya businesses. Lucent and Avaya each granted to the other, under the patents\n\nthat each of us has, a non-exclusive, personal license to make, have made, use,\n\nlease, import, sell, and offer for sale any and all products and services in\n\nwhich the licensed company is now or hereafter engaged. Each company also\n\ngranted limited licenses to the other under certain specified technology\n\nexisting as of October 1, 2000. See also, \"Separation Agreements -- AVAYA.\"\n\nVIII. OUTLOOK\n\nA. Forward Looking Statements\n\nThis Form 10-K report contains forward-looking statements that are based on\n\ncurrent expectations, estimates, forecasts and projections about the industries\n\nin which Lucent operates, management's beliefs and assumptions made by\n\nmanagement. In addition, other written or oral statements which constitute\n\nforward-looking statements may be made by or on behalf of Lucent. Words such as\n\n\"expects,\" \"anticipates,\"\n\n14\n\n15\n\n\"intends,\" \"plans,\" \"believes,\" \"seeks,\" \"estimates,\" variations of such words\n\nand similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking\n\nstatements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and\n\ninvolve certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions (\"Future Factors\") which\n\nare difficult to predict. Therefore, actual outcomes and results may differ\n\nmaterially from what is expressed or forecasted in such forward-looking\n\nstatements. Lucent undertakes no obligation to update publicly any\n\nforward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future\n\nevents or otherwise.\n\nFuture Factors include increasing price, products and services competition\n\nby U.S. and non-U.S. competitors, including new entrants; rapid technological\n\ndevelopments and changes and Lucent's ability to continue to introduce\n\ncompetitive new products and services on a timely, cost-effective basis; the mix\n\nof products and services; the availability of manufacturing capacity, components\n\nand materials; the ability to recruit and retain talent; the achievement of\n\nlower costs and expenses; credit concerns in the emerging service provider\n\nmarket; customer demand for Lucent's products and services; the ability to\n\nsuccessfully integrate the operations and business of acquired companies; timely\n\ncompletion of the proposed IPO and spin-off of Agere Systems and the sale of the\n\npower systems business; the successful implementation of the strategic\n\nreorganization; U.S. and non-U.S. governmental and public policy changes that\n\nmay affect the level of new investments and purchases made by customers; changes\n\nin environmental and other domestic and foreign governmental regulations;\n\nprotection and validity of patent and other intellectual property rights;\n\nreliance on large customers and significant suppliers; the ability to supply\n\ncustomer financing when appropriate; technological, implementation and\n\ncost/financial risks in the use of large, multi-year contracts; Lucent's credit\n\nratings; the outcome of pending and future litigation and governmental\n\nproceedings; the continued availability of financing, financial instruments and\n\nfinancial resources in the amounts, at the times and on the terms required to\n\nsupport Lucent's future business. These are representative of the Future Factors\n\nthat could affect the outcome of the forward-looking statements. In addition,\n\nsuch statements could be affected by general industry and market conditions and\n\ngrowth rates, general U.S. and non-U.S. economic conditions including interest\n\nrate and currency exchange rate fluctuations and other Future Factors.\n\nB. General Market Competition\n\nLucent operates in a highly competitive industry and expects that the level\n\nof competition on pricing and product offerings will intensify. Lucent expects\n\nthat new competitors will enter its markets as a result of expansion by market\n\nparticipants and advancements in technology. These competitors, as well as\n\nexisting competitors, may include entrants from the telecommunications,\n\nsoftware, data networking and semiconductor industries, and may have strong\n\nfinancial capabilities, technological expertise and established name\n\nrecognition. Such competitors include Alcatel Alsthom, Cisco Systems, Inc.,\n\nEricsson, Nortel Networks Corporation, Motorola, Nokia and Siemens AG. Steps\n\nLucent may take include acquiring or investing in new businesses and ventures,\n\npartnering with existing businesses, delivering new technologies, closing and\n\nconsolidating facilities, disposing of assets, reducing work force levels or\n\nwithdrawing from markets. See also, the \"Competition\" section above under\n\n\"Service Provider Networks,\" and \"Microelectronic and Communications\n\nTechnologies.\"\n\nC. Dependence on New Product Development\n\nThe markets for Lucent's principal products are characterized by\n\nrapidly-changing technology, evolving industry standards, frequent new product\n\nintroductions and evolving methods of building and operating communications\n\nsystems for service providers and other customers. Lucent's operating results\n\nwill depend to a significant extent on its ability to continue to introduce new\n\nsystems, products, software and services successfully on a timely basis and to\n\nreduce costs of existing systems, products, software and services. The success\n\nof these and other new offerings is dependent on several factors, including\n\nproper identification of customer needs, cost, timely completion and\n\nintroduction, differentiation from offerings of Lucent's competitors and market\n\nacceptance. In addition, new technological innovations generally require a\n\nsubstantial investment before any assurance is available as to their commercial\n\nviability, including, in some cases, certification by U.S. and non-U.S.\n\nstandards-setting bodies.\n\n15\n\n16\n\nD. Reliance on Major Customers\n\nA limited number of large customers provide a substantial portion of\n\nLucent's revenues. These customers include Verizon, AT&T and certain incumbent\n\nand competitive local exchange carriers. Revenues from Verizon accounted for\n\napproximately 13% of consolidated revenues in fiscal year 2000, principally in\n\nthe SPN segment. Revenues from AT&T accounted for approximately 10%, 14% and 15%\n\nof consolidated revenues in fiscal years 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively. The\n\nspending patterns of any of these customers can vary significantly during the\n\nyear. Elimination or change in the spending patterns of, or a significant\n\nreduction in orders from, any one of these customers could negatively affect\n\nLucent's operating results. Lucent's fiscal year 2000 results were negatively\n\naffected by the decline in sales to one large U.S. customer and one large\n\nnon-U.S. customer. The communications industry has recently experienced a\n\nconsolidation of both U.S. and non-U.S. companies. As a result, Lucent's\n\noperating results could become more dependent on a smaller number of large\n\ncarriers. Lucent continually endeavors to diversify its customer base by adding\n\nnew and different types of customers. Lucent, however, is often required to\n\nprovide or arrange for long-term financing for customers as a condition to\n\nobtain or bid on infrastructure contracts. Thus, our ability to develop certain\n\ncustomer relationships may be dependent upon our ability to raise capital and\n\nextend credit.\n\nE. European Monetary Union -- Euro\n\nSeveral member countries of the European Union have established fixed\n\nconversion rates between their existing sovereign currencies and the Euro and\n\nhave adopted the Euro as their new common legal currency. The legacy currencies\n\nwill remain legal tender in the participating countries for a transition period\n\nuntil January 1, 2002. During the transition period, cashless payments can be\n\nmade in the Euro. Between January 1, 2002 and July 1, 2002, the participating\n\ncountries will introduce Euro notes and coins and withdraw all legacy currencies\n\nso that they will no longer be available.\n\nLucent has in place a joint European-United States team representing\n\naffected functions within Lucent. This team has been evaluating Euro-related\n\nissues which may affect Lucent as they develop, including its pricing/marketing\n\nstrategy, conversion of information technology systems, and existing contracts.\n\nThe Euro conversion may effect cross border competition by creating cross border\n\nprice transparency.\n\nLucent will continue to evaluate issues involving the introduction of the\n\nEuro as further accounting, tax and governmental legal and regulatory guidance\n\nis available. Based on current information and Lucent's current assessment,\n\nLucent does not expect that the Euro conversion will have a material adverse\n\neffect on its business or financial condition.\n\nF. Future Capital Requirements\n\nLucent's working capital requirements and cash flow from operating\n\nactivities can vary greatly from quarter to quarter, depending on the volume of\n\nproduction, the timing of deliveries and collection of receivables, the build-up\n\nof inventories, the payment terms offered to customers, and the extension of\n\ncredit to customers.\n\nService providers, inside and outside the United States, increasingly have\n\nrequired their suppliers to arrange or provide long-term financing for them as a\n\ncondition to obtaining or bidding on infrastructure projects. These projects may\n\nrequire financing in amounts ranging from modest sums to over a billion dollars.\n\nLucent has increasingly provided or arranged long-term financing for customers.\n\nAs market conditions permit, Lucent's intention is to lay off these long-term\n\nfinancing arrangements, which may include both commitments and drawn down\n\nborrowings, to financial institutions and investors. This enables Lucent to\n\nreduce the amount of its commitments and free up additional financing capacity.\n\nAs of September 30, 2000, Lucent had made commitments or entered into an\n\nagreement to extend credit to customers up to an aggregate of approximately $6.7\n\nbillion. As of September 30, 2000, approximately $1.3 billion had been advanced\n\nand was outstanding. In addition, as of September 30, 2000, Lucent had made\n\ncommitments or entered into agreements to guarantee debt of customers up to an\n\naggregate of approximately $1.4 billion of which approximately $770 million was\n\noutstanding.\n\nIn addition to the above arrangements, Lucent will continue to provide or\n\ncommit to financing where appropriate for its business. The ability of Lucent to\n\narrange or provide financing for its customers will depend\n\n16\n\n17\n\non a number of factors, including Lucent's capital structure, credit rating and\n\nlevel of available credit, and its continued ability to lay off commitments and\n\ndrawn down borrowings on acceptable terms.\n\nLucent believes that its credit facilities, cash flow from operations, long\n\nand short-term debt financings and receivables securitizations, will be\n\nsufficient to satisfy its future working capital, capital expenditure, research\n\nand development and debt service requirements. Lucent has a shelf registration\n\nstatement for the issuance of debt securities of which approximately $1.8\n\nbillion remained available at September 30, 2000. Lucent believes that it will\n\nbe able to access the capital markets on terms and in amounts that will be\n\nsatisfactory to it, and that it will be able to obtain bid and performance\n\nbonds, to arrange or provide customer financing as necessary, and to engage in\n\nhedging transactions on commercially acceptable terms, although there can be no\n\nassurance that Lucent will be successful in regard to any of the foregoing.\n\nG. Non-U.S. Growth, Foreign Exchange and Interest Rates\n\nLucent intends to continue to pursue growth opportunities in markets\n\noutside the United States. In many markets outside the United States,\n\nlong-standing relationships between potential customers of Lucent and their\n\nlocal providers and protective regulations, including local content requirements\n\nand type approvals, create barriers to entry. In addition, pursuit of such\n\ngrowth opportunities outside the United States may require significant\n\ninvestments for an extended period before returns on such investments, if any,\n\nare realized. Such projects and investments could be adversely affected by\n\nreversals or delays in the opening of foreign markets to new competitors,\n\nexchange controls, currency fluctuations, investment policies, repatriation of\n\ncash, nationalization, social and political risks, taxation and other factors,\n\ndepending on the country in which such opportunity arises. Difficulties in\n\nforeign financial markets and economies, and of foreign financial institutions,\n\ncould adversely affect demand from customers in the affected countries.\n\nLucent is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange\n\nrates and interest rates, which could impact its results of operations and\n\nfinancial condition. Lucent manages its exposure to these market risks through\n\nits regular operating and financing activities and, when deemed appropriate,\n\nthrough the use of derivative financial instruments. A significant change in the\n\nvalue of the dollar against the currency of one or more countries where Lucent\n\nsells products to local customers or makes purchases from local suppliers may\n\nmaterially adversely affect Lucent's results. Lucent attempts to mitigate any\n\nsuch effects through the use of foreign exchange forward or option contracts,\n\nalthough there can be no assurances that such attempts will be successful.\n\nWhile Lucent hedges certain foreign currency transactions, the decline in\n\nvalue of non-U.S. dollar currencies, may, if not reversed, adversely affect\n\nLucent's ability to contract for product sales in U.S. dollars because Lucent's\n\nproducts may become more expensive to purchase in U.S. dollars for local\n\ncustomers doing business in the countries of the affected currencies.\n\nH.

Intellectual Property -- See \"Patents, Trademarks and Other Intellectual\n\nProperty Rights\" above.\n\nIX. EMPLOYEE RELATIONS\n\nOn September 30, 2000, Lucent employed approximately 126,000 persons,\n\nincluding 73% located in the United States. Of these domestic employees, about\n\n36% are represented by unions, primarily the Communications Workers of America\n\n(\"CWA\") and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (\"IBEW\").\n\nLucent's current five-year collective agreements with the CWA and IBEW expire\n\nMay 31, 2003.\n\nX. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS\n\nLucent's current and historical operations are subject to a wide range of\n\nenvironmental protection laws. In the United States, these laws often require\n\nparties to fund remedial action regardless of fault. Lucent has\n\n17\n\n18\n\nremedial and investigatory activities underway at numerous current and former\n\nfacilities. In addition, Lucent was named a successor to AT&T as a potentially\n\nresponsible party (\"PRP\") at numerous \"Superfund\" sites pursuant to the\n\nComprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980\n\n(\"CERCLA\") or comparable state statutes. Under the Separation and Distribution\n\nAgreement, Lucent is responsible for all liabilities primarily resulting from or\n\nrelating to the operation of Lucent's business as conducted at any time prior to\n\nor after the Separation including related businesses discontinued or disposed of\n\nprior to the Separation, and Lucent's assets including, without limitation,\n\nthose associated with these sites. In addition, under such Separation and\n\nDistribution Agreement, Lucent is required to pay a portion of contingent\n\nliabilities paid out in excess of certain amounts by AT&T and NCR, including\n\nenvironmental liabilities.\n\nIt is often difficult to estimate the future impact of environmental\n\nmatters, including potential liabilities. Lucent records an environmental\n\nreserve when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of\n\nthe liability is reasonably estimable. This practice is followed whether the\n\nclaims are asserted or unasserted. Management expects that the amounts reserved\n\nwill be paid out over the periods of remediation for the applicable sites which\n\ntypically range from 5 to 30 years. Reserves for estimated losses from\n\nenvironmental remediation are, depending on the site, based primarily upon\n\ninternal or third-party environmental studies, and estimates as to the number,\n\nparticipation level and financial viability of any other PRPs, the extent of the\n\ncontamination and the nature of required remedial actions. Accruals are adjusted\n\nas further information develops or circumstances change. The amounts provided\n\nfor in Lucent's consolidated financial statements for environmental reserves are\n\nthe gross undiscounted amount of such reserves, without deductions for insurance\n\nor third-party indemnity claims. In those cases where insurance carriers or\n\nthird-party indemnitors have agreed to pay any amounts and management believes\n\nthat collectibility of such amounts is probable, the amounts are reflected as\n\nreceivables in the financial statements. Although Lucent believes that its\n\nreserves are adequate, there can be no assurance that the amount of capital\n\nexpenditures and other expenses which will be required relating to remedial\n\nactions and compliance with applicable environmental laws will not exceed the\n\namounts reflected in Lucent's reserves or will not have a material adverse\n\neffect on Lucent's financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Any\n\namounts of environmental costs that may be incurred in excess of those provided\n\nfor at September 30, 2000 cannot be determined.\n\nXI. SEPARATION AGREEMENTS\n\nA. AT&T\n\nFor the purposes of governing certain of the relationships between Lucent\n\nand AT&T (including NCR) following the Separation, the Company, AT&T and NCR\n\nentered into a Separation and Distribution Agreement and the Ancillary\n\nAgreements to which they are parties (collectively, the \"Separation\n\nAgreements\"). The Ancillary Agreements include the Employee Benefits Agreement;\n\nthe Brand License Agreement; the Patent License Agreement and other\n\npatent-related agreements; the Technology License Agreement and other\n\ntechnology-related agreements; and the Tax Sharing Agreement and other\n\ntax-related agreements. Certain of the Separation Agreements, including certain\n\nof the Agreements summarized below, are exhibits to this Form 10-K.\n\nReference is made to such exhibits for the full text of the provisions of\n\nthose Agreements, and the agreement summaries below are qualified in their\n\nentirety by reference to the full text of such Agreements. Capitalized terms\n\nused in this section and not otherwise defined in this Form 10-K shall have\n\ntheir respective meanings set forth in the Separation and Distribution Agreement\n\n(except that the term \"Company\" is used in lieu of the term \"Lucent\") or other\n\nSeparation Agreement.\n\nSeparation and Distribution Agreement\n\nUnder the Separation and Distribution Agreement, Lucent assumed or agreed\n\nto assume, and agreed to perform and fulfill, all the \"Lucent Liabilities\" (as\n\ndefined in such Agreement) in accordance with their respective terms. Without\n\nlimitation, the Lucent Liabilities generally include all liabilities and\n\ncontingent liabilities relating to Lucent's present and former business and\n\noperations, and contingent liabilities otherwise assigned to Lucent; contingent\n\nliabilities related to AT&T's discontinued computer operations (other than those\n\nof NCR) were assigned to the Company. The Separation and Distribution Agreement\n\nprovides for the\n\n18\n\n19\n\nsharing of contingent liabilities not allocated to one of the parties in\n\nspecified proportions, and also provides that each party will share specified\n\nportions of contingent liabilities related to the business of any of the other\n\nparties that exceed specified levels.\n\nAbility to Terminate Certain Rights. The Separation and Distribution\n\nAgreement provides that certain rights granted to Lucent and the members of\n\nLucent Group will be subject to the following provisions. Except as otherwise\n\nexpressly provided, in the event that, at any time prior to February 1, 2001,\n\nLucent or any member of Lucent Group offers, furnishes or provides any\n\nTelecommunications Services of the type offered by the AT&T Services Business as\n\nof the Closing Date, then AT&T may, in its sole discretion: (a) terminate all or\n\nany portion of the rights granted by AT&T under the Brand License Agreement (b)\n\nexercise the right to require Lucent to transfer to AT&T certain personnel,\n\ninformation, technology and software under the Supplemental Agreements; (c)\n\nterminate all or any portion of the rights to patents and technology of AT&T or\n\nany member of the AT&T Group granted to Lucent and the members of Lucent Group\n\npursuant to the Patent License Agreement and the Technology License Agreement;\n\nand (d) direct Lucent and the members of Lucent Group to reconvey to AT&T all\n\ninterests in any and all patents and technology in which Lucent or any member of\n\nLucent Group was granted an undivided one-half interest pursuant to the Patent\n\nAssignments or the Technology Assignment and Joint Ownership Agreements. Lucent\n\nand the members of Lucent Group will not be deemed to offer, furnish or provide\n\nany Telecommunications Services (and the foregoing provisions will not apply)\n\nsolely by virtue of certain specified investments in Persons that offer, furnish\n\nor provide Telecommunications Services or by virtue of offering, furnishing or\n\nproviding Telecommunications Services below a specified de minimis amount.\n\nEmployee Benefits Agreement\n\nAT&T and Lucent entered into the Employee Benefits Agreement that governs\n\nthe employee benefit obligations of the Company, including both compensation and\n\nbenefits, with respect to active employees and retirees assigned to the Company.\n\nPursuant to the Employee Benefits Agreement, Lucent assumed and agreed to pay,\n\nperform, fulfill and discharge, in accordance with their respective terms, all\n\nLiabilities (as defined) to, or relating to, former employees of AT&T or its\n\naffiliates employed by Lucent and its affiliates and certain former employees of\n\nAT&T or its affiliates (including retirees) who either were employed in Lucent\n\nBusiness (as defined) or who otherwise are assigned to Lucent for purposes of\n\nallocating employee benefit obligations (including all retirees of Bell Labs).\n\nPatent Licenses and Related Matters\n\nThe Company, AT&T and NCR executed and delivered assignments and other\n\nagreements, including a patent license agreement, related to patents then owned\n\nor controlled by AT&T and its subsidiaries. The patent assignments divided\n\nownership of patents, patent applications and foreign counterparts among the\n\nCompany, AT&T and NCR, with the substantial portion of those then owned or\n\ncontrolled by AT&T and its subsidiaries (other than NCR) being assigned to the\n\nCompany. A small number of the patents assigned to Lucent are jointly owned with\n\neither AT&T or NCR. Certain of the patents that Lucent jointly owns with AT&T\n\nare subject to a joint ownership agreement under which each of Lucent and AT&T\n\nhas full ownership rights in the patents. The other patents that Lucent jointly\n\nowns with AT&T, and the patents that Lucent jointly owns with NCR, are subject\n\nto defensive protection agreements with AT&T and NCR, respectively, under which\n\nLucent holds most ownership rights in the patents exclusively. Under these\n\ndefensive protection agreements, AT&T or NCR, as the case may be, has the\n\nability, subject to specified restrictions, to assert infringement claims under\n\nthe patents against companies that assert patent infringement claims against\n\nthem, and has consent rights in the event Lucent wishes to license the patents\n\nto certain third parties or for certain fields of use under specified\n\ncircumstances. The defensive protection agreements also provide for one-time\n\npayments from AT&T and NCR to the Company.\n\nThe patent license agreement entered into by the Company, AT&T and NCR\n\nprovides for cross-licenses to each company, under each of the other company's\n\npatents that are covered by the licenses, to make, use, lease, sell and import\n\nany and all products and services of the businesses in which the licensed\n\ncompany (including specified related companies) is now or hereafter engaged. The\n\ncross-licenses also permit each\n\n19\n\n20\n\ncompany, subject to specified limitations, to have third parties make items\n\nunder the other companies' patents, as well as to pass through to customers\n\ncertain rights under the other companies' patents with respect to products and\n\nservices furnished to customers by the licensed company. In addition, the rights\n\ngranted to Lucent and AT&T include the right to license third parties under each\n\nof the other company's patents to the extent necessary to meet existing patent\n\nlicensing obligations as of March 29, 1996, and AT&T has the right, subject to\n\nspecified restrictions and procedures, to ask Lucent to license third parties\n\nunder a limited number of identified patents that were assigned to the Company.\n\nTechnology Licenses and Related Matters\n\nThe Company, AT&T and NCR executed and delivered assignments and other\n\nagreements, including the Technology License Agreement, related to technology\n\nthen owned or controlled by AT&T and its subsidiaries. Technology includes\n\ncopyrights, mask works and other intellectual property other than trademarks,\n\ntrade names, trade dress, service marks and patent rights. The technology\n\nassignments divide ownership of technology among the Company, AT&T and NCR, with\n\nLucent and AT&T owning technology that was developed by or for, or purchased by,\n\nLucent's business or AT&T's services business, respectively, and NCR owning\n\ntechnology that was developed by or for, or purchased by, NCR. Technology that\n\nis not covered by any of these categories is owned jointly by Lucent and AT&T\n\nor, in the case of certain specified technology, owned jointly by the Company,\n\nAT&T and NCR.\n\nThe Technology License Agreement entered into by the Company, AT&T and NCR\n\nprovides for royalty-free cross-licenses to each company to use the other\n\ncompanies' technology existing as of April 10, 1996, except for specified\n\nportions of each company's technology as to which use by the other companies is\n\nrestricted or prohibited.\n\nB. AVAYA\n\nFor the purpose of governing certain of the relationships between Lucent\n\nand Avaya following the spin off, Lucent and Avaya entered into a Contribution\n\nand Distribution Agreement, as well as other ancillary agreements, including the\n\nEmployee Benefits Agreement; the Patent and Technology License Agreement; the\n\nTax Sharing Agreement; and the Trademark Licensing Agreement. The Contribution\n\nand Distribution Agreement provides for indemnification by each company with\n\nrespect to contingent liabilities primarily relating to their respective\n\nbusinesses or otherwise assigned to each, subject to certain sharing provisions.\n\nIn the event the aggregate value of all amounts paid by each company, in respect\n\nof any single contingent liability or any set or group of related contingent\n\nliabilities, is in excess of $50 million, each company will share portions in\n\nexcess of the threshold amount based on agreed-upon percentages. The\n\nContribution and Distribution Agreement also provides for the sharing of certain\n\ncontingent liabilities, specifically: (1) any contingent liabilities that are\n\nnot primarily contingent liabilities of Lucent or contingent liabilities\n\nassociated with the businesses attributed to Avaya; (2) certain specifically\n\nidentified liabilities, including liabilities relating to terminated, divested\n\nor discontinued businesses or operations; and (3) shared contingent liabilities\n\nwithin the meaning of the Separation and Distribution Agreement with AT&T Corp.\n\nPlease refer to the Registration Statement on Form 10 (No. 001-15951) of Avaya\n\nfor the full text of the Contribution and Distribution Agreement and other\n\nancillary agreements.\n\nITEM 2. PROPERTIES.\n\nAt September 30, 2000, Lucent operated 36 manufacturing sites, of which 17\n\nwere located in the United States, occupying in excess of 17 million square feet\n\nsubstantially all of which were owned. The remaining 19 sites were located in 11\n\ncountries.\n\nAt September 30, 2000, Lucent operated 118 warehouse sites, of which 86\n\nwere located in the United States, occupying in excess of 4 million square feet,\n\nsubstantially all of which were leased. The remaining 32 sites were located in\n\n15 countries.\n\n20\n\n21\n\nAt September 30, 2000, Lucent operated 627 office sites (administration,\n\nsales, field service), of which 379 were located in the United States, occupying\n\nin excess of 20 million square feet, of which 15 million square feet of which\n\nwere leased. The remaining 248 sites were located in 56 countries.\n\nAt September 30, 2000, Lucent operated additional sites in 21 cities, of\n\nwhich 8 were located in the United States, with significant research and\n\ndevelopment activities, occupying in excess of 10 million square feet, of which\n\napproximately 2 million square feet were leased.\n\nLucent believes its plants and facilities are suitable and adequate to meet\n\nits current needs.\n\nITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.\n\nIn the normal course of business, Lucent is subject to proceedings,\n\nlawsuits and other claims, including proceedings under the laws and regulations\n\nrelated to environmental and other matters. (Also see Item 1. \"Business -- XI\n\nSeparation Agreements\" regarding the assumption by Lucent of certain liabilities\n\nand contingent liabilities.) All such matters are subject to many uncertainties\n\nand outcomes are not predictable with assurance. Consequently, Lucent is unable\n\nto ascertain the ultimate aggregate amount of monetary liability or financial\n\nimpact with respect to these matters at September 30, 2000. While these matters\n\ncould affect operating results of any one quarter when resolved in future\n\nperiods and, while there can be no assurance with respect thereto, it is\n\nmanagement's opinion that after final disposition, any monetary liability or\n\nfinancial impact to Lucent beyond that provided in the consolidated balance\n\nsheet at September 30, 2000 would not be material to Lucent's annual\n\nconsolidated financial statements.\n\nIn addition, Lucent and certain of its former officers are defendants in\n\nseveral purported shareholder class action lawsuits described in the following\n\nthree paragraphs for alleged violations of federal securities laws. The\n\npurported class action suits described in the following three paragraphs are in\n\nthe early stages and Lucent is unable to express a view on their outcome. Lucent\n\nintends to defend these actions vigorously.\n\nLucent and certain former officers of Lucent are defendants in a purported\n\nclass action litigation pending in the United States District Court for the\n\nDistrict of New Jersey. That action is the result of several complaints that\n\nwere consolidated on February 25, 2000, and amended several times since. The\n\nthird Consolidated Amended and Supplemental Class Action Complaint purports to\n\nbring claims on behalf of all persons who allegedly purchased Lucent's common\n\nstock between October 26, 1999, and November 21, 2000, for alleged violations of\n\nthe federal securities laws, including Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the\n\nSecurities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder.\n\nSpecifically, the complaint alleges, among other things, that beginning in late\n\nOctober 1999, Lucent and certain of its officers misrepresented Lucent's\n\nfinancial condition and failed to disclose material facts that would have an\n\nadverse impact on Lucent's future earnings and prospects for growth. The action\n\nseeks compensatory and other damages, and costs and expenses associated with\n\nlitigation.\n\nLucent is aware of five other purported class action lawsuits that have\n\nbeen filed in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey.\n\nAs with the consolidated action discussed above, those actions purport to bring\n\nclaims for alleged violations of the federal securities laws, including Sections\n\n10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5\n\npromulgated thereunder. The actions seek compensatory and other damages, and\n\ncosts and expenses associated with litigation. Because the actions assert claims\n\nthat relate to or are similar to the claims in the consolidated litigation\n\ndiscussed above, it is likely that these actions will be consolidated with that\n\naction.\n\nIn addition, Lucent is aware of purported class action lawsuits that have\n\nbeen filed in Civil District Court in the State of Louisiana and in the United\n\nStates District Court for the Eastern District of New York. As with the\n\nconsolidated action discussed above, those actions purport to bring claims for\n\nalleged violations of the federal securities laws, including Section 10(b) of\n\nthe Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder. The\n\ncomplaints allege that Lucent misrepresented its financial condition and failed\n\nto disclose material facts about its business, operations and future prospects.\n\nThe actions seek compensatory and other damages, and costs and expenses\n\nassociated with litigation. Lucent has filed a petition to remove the Louisiana\n\naction from state court to federal court in Louisiana. In addition, because\n\nthese actions assert claims\n\n21\n\n22\n\nthat relate to or are similar to the claims in the consolidated litigation\n\ndiscussed above, these actions may ultimately be transferred to the United\n\nStates District Court for the District of New Jersey and consolidated with that\n\naction.\n\nFrom time to time we are subject to unfair labor charges filed by the\n\nunions with the National Labor Relations Board. For example, Lucent has been\n\nadvised by Region 6 of the National Labor Relations Board, which is located in\n\nPittsburgh, Pennsylvania, that it is issuing a complaint alleging that Lucent\n\nhas refused to bargain over the outsourcing of certain of its manufacturing\n\nactivities. In that proceeding, which will be held before an administrative law\n\njudge in Region 6 of the National Labor Relations Board, the General Counsel of\n\nthe National Labor Relations Board will act as prosecutor and the charging\n\nparty, IBEW System Council EM-3, which is the union representing the workers at\n\nthe manufacturing facilities in question, will be an interested party entitled\n\nto participate in the proceeding.\n\nOn December 11, 2000, the former President of Lucent North America filed a\n\nlawsuit against Lucent in the Superior Court of New Jersey. The complaint makes\n\na number of allegations, including claims under New Jersey's Conscientious\n\nEmployee Protection Act and for breach of contract. It seeks unspecified claims,\n\ncompensatory damages and punitive damages. Lucent intends to defend this action\n\nvigorously.\n\nSee also the discussion of \"Environmental Matters\" in Item 1. for\n\nadditional information on environmental matters and proceedings.\n\nITEM 4. SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS.\n\nDuring the fourth quarter of the fiscal year covered by this report on Form\n\n10-K, no matter was submitted to a vote of Security Holders.\n\nPART II\n\nITEM 5.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND\n\nFINANCIAL CONDITION\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nIn fiscal 2000, Lucent Technologies Inc. (\"Lucent\" or the \"Company\")\n\ncompleted its plan to spin off its Enterprise Networks business to shareowners,\n\nforming a separate and independent company. The new company is called Avaya Inc.\n\n(\"Avaya\") (See DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS).\n\nIn addition, on July 20, 2000, Lucent announced its intention to spin off\n\nits microelectronics business, which includes the optoelectronics components and\n\nintegrated circuits divisions, into a separate and independent company. The new\n\ncompany is called Agere Systems Inc. (\"Agere Systems\"). On December 11, 2000, a\n\nForm S-1 registration statement was filed with the SEC in anticipation of an\n\ninitial public offering (\"IPO\") of Agere Systems. Lucent intends to distribute\n\nthe remaining shares in a tax-free distribution. This report does not constitute\n\nthe offering of any securities, which will be made only by a prospectus filed\n\nwith the SEC. In connection with the spin-off, Lucent may be adjusting its\n\ncapital structure including a possible reduction in the amount of debt\n\noutstanding. The IPO is expected to be completed in the quarter ending March 31,\n\n2001, and completion of the spin-off is expected by the end of the 2001 fiscal\n\nyear. The IPO and spin-off are subject to certain conditions, including a\n\nfavorable tax ruling by the IRS.\n\nOn November 13, 2000, Lucent entered into an agreement to sell its power\n\nsystems business to Tyco International Ltd., a diversified manufacturing and\n\nservice company, for $2,500 million in cash. The sale, which is subject to\n\nregulatory approval and other customary closing conditions, is expected to close\n\nby December 31, 2000 and result in a one-time gain to be recorded as an\n\nextraordinary item, net of tax, in the quarter in which the sale closes.\n\nThese actions will allow Lucent to concentrate its investments, resources\n\nand management attention on optical, data and wireless solutions, along with the\n\nnetwork design, consulting and integration services to support them. Lucent\n\nexpects to take a business restructuring charge associated with the redesign of\n\nits business in the quarter ending March 31, 2001. Lucent expects to give\n\ndetails of the charge in late January, 2001. A review of our internal processes\n\nwill continue throughout 2001 and may result in additional restructuring and\n\nassociated charges (see KEY BUSINESS CHALLENGES).\n\nOn a total basis, Lucent reported net income of $1,219 million, or $0.37\n\nper share (diluted) for the year ended September 30, 2000, as compared with\n\nyear-ago net income of $4,789 million, or $1.49 per share (diluted). Fiscal 2000\n\nnet income includes a $462 million loss, or $0.14 per share (diluted), from\n\ndiscontinued operations, net of tax, compared with $455 million of income, or\n\n$0.14 per share (diluted), net of tax, for fiscal 1999. The fiscal 2000 net\n\nincome also includes a reduction of costs and operating expenses of $252 million\n\nrepresenting the impact of adopting Statement of Position 98-1, \"Accounting for\n\nthe Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use\" (\"SOP\n\n98-1\"). In addition, in fiscal 1999 Lucent changed its method for determining\n\nannual net pension and postretirement benefit costs. As a result, included in\n\n1999 net income is a $1,308 million, or $0.41 per share (diluted), cumulative\n\neffect of accounting change. Lucent's income before the cumulative effect of\n\naccounting change was $3,481 million for the year ended September 30, 1999. See\n\nNote 12 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for further\n\ndetails of the accounting change.\n\nDISCONTINUED OPERATIONS\n\nOn March 1, 2000, Lucent announced plans to spin off Avaya and, on\n\nSeptember 30, 2000, the spin-off was accomplished through a tax-free\n\ndistribution of shares to Lucent's shareowners.\n\nAvaya represented a significant segment of the Company's business. Pursuant\n\nto Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 30, \"Reporting the Results of\n\nOperations -- Reporting the Effects of Disposal of a Segment of a Business, and\n\nExtraordinary, Unusual and Infrequently Occurring Events and Transactions\" (\"APB\n\n30\"), Lucent has reclassified its Consolidated Financial Statements to reflect\n\nthe spin-off of Avaya. The revenues, costs and expenses, assets and liabilities,\n\nand cash flows of Avaya have been segregated in the Consolidated Statements of\n\nIncome, Consolidated Balance Sheets and Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\n\nThe net operating results, net assets and net cash flows of this business have\n\nbeen reported as \"Discontinued Operations\" in the accompanying Consolidated\n\nFinancial Statements.\n\n24\n\n25\n\nLucent recorded a $462 million loss from discontinued operations (net of a\n\ntax benefit of $78 million) for the year ended September 30, 2000. The net loss\n\nis comprised of $303 million of net income from discontinued operations for the\n\nperiod prior to the measurement date and a $765 million net loss on disposal of\n\nAvaya. The loss on disposal of Avaya reflects the costs directly associated with\n\nthe spin-off and the net loss of Avaya between the measurement date and the\n\nspin-off date of September 30, 2000. The costs reflect those components of Avaya\n\nreorganization plan, including a business restructuring charge and directly\n\nrelated asset write-downs of $545 million recorded during the year, along with\n\ntransaction costs of $56 million for the spin-off. Major components of this\n\ncharge include $365 million for employee separation and $101 million for real\n\nestate consolidation.\n\nIn addition, the loss from discontinued operations includes an allocation\n\nof Lucent's interest expense based on the amount of debt assumed by Avaya.\n\nApproximately $780 million of commercial paper borrowings were assumed by Avaya\n\nas part of the spin-off transaction.\n\nLucent's financial results for discontinued operations are different from\n\nthe results reported by Avaya due to different assumptions and allocations\n\nrequired to be made by the two companies.\n\nThe following discussion will focus on Lucent's results from continuing\n\noperations.\n\nFINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS\n\nLucent reported income from continuing operations of $1,681 million, or\n\n$0.51 per share (diluted), for the year ended September 30, 2000, compared with\n\nyear-ago income from continuing operations of $3,026 million, or $0.94 per share\n\n(diluted).\n\nIncome from continuing operations for 2000 includes $1,005 million ($1,001\n\nmillion after-tax) of purchased in-process research and development (\"IPRD\")\n\nexpenses related to the acquisitions of Spring Tide Networks, Chromatis\n\nNetworks, Herrmann Technology, Ortel Corporation, Agere, Inc. and VTC Inc., a\n\npre-tax gain of $189 million ($115 million after-tax) associated with the sale\n\nof an equity investment, a reduction to costs and operating expenses of $252\n\nmillion related to the impact of adopting SOP 98-1 and a pre-tax charge of $61\n\nmillion ($40 million after-tax) primarily associated with the mergers with\n\nInternational Network Services (\"INS\"), Excel Switching Corporation and Xedia\n\nCorporation.\n\nIncome from continuing operations in 1999 includes a $108 million ($71\n\nmillion after-tax) reversal of business restructuring charges, a $110 million\n\nnon-tax deductible charge for merger-related costs and a $236 million charge\n\n($169 million after-tax) primarily associated with asset impairments and\n\nintegration-related charges related to the Ascend Communications, Inc. and\n\nNexabit Networks, Inc. mergers, a $274 million gain ($167 million after-tax) on\n\nthe sale of an equity investment, and $292 million ($280 million after-tax) of\n\nIPRD expenses related to the acquisitions of Stratus Computer, Inc., XNT\n\nSystems, Inc., Quantum Telecom Solutions, Inc., InterCall Communications and\n\nConsulting, Inc., Quadritek Systems, Inc., Sybarus Technologies, WaveAccess Ltd.\n\nand the Ethernet local area network (\"LAN\") component business of Enable\n\nSemiconductor (\"Enable\").\n\nACQUISITIONS\n\nAs part of Lucent's continuing efforts to provide its customers with\n\nend-to-end communications solutions, the Company completed numerous acquisitions\n\nand mergers during the three years ended September 30, 2000. For more\n\ninformation, see Note 4 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nOPERATING SEGMENTS\n\nLucent operates in the global telecommunications networking industry and\n\nhas two reportable segments: Service Provider Networks (\"SPN\") and\n\nMicroelectronics and Communications Technologies (\"MCT\"). SPN provides public\n\nnetworking systems, software and services to telecommunications service\n\nproviders and public network operators around the world. MCT provides\n\nhigh-performance optoelectronic components and integrated circuits, power\n\nsystems and optical fiber for applications in the communications and computing\n\n25\n\n26\n\nindustries. In addition, MCT also includes Lucent's new ventures business. The\n\nresults of other smaller units and corporate operations are reported in Other\n\nand Corporate.\n\nThe two reportable operating segments are strategic market units that offer\n\ndistinct products and services. These segments were determined based on the\n\ncustomers and the markets that Lucent serves. Each market unit is managed\n\nseparately as each operation requires different technologies and marketing\n\nstrategies.\n\nAs a result of reorganization initiatives (see KEY BUSINESS CHALLENGES),\n\nthe Company is evaluating changes to its management model and organizational\n\nstructure which will result in changes to the reportable segments in the next\n\nfiscal year.\n\n[CHART]\n\nSEGMENT REVENUES\n\nFOR THE YEARS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 1998, 1999 AND 2000\n\n1998 1999 2000\n\n----- ----- -----\n\n(DOLLARS IN BILLIONS)\n\nService Provider Networks................................... $20.1 $24.8 $26.5\n\nMicroelectronics and Communications Technologies............ 4.2 5.0 7.0\n\nOther and Corporate......................................... 0.1 0.8 0.3\n\nLucent's Service Provider Networks segment represents about 78% of the\n\ntotal external sales for 2000.
