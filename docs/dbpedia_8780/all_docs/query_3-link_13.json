        "text": "Muṣāhara (affinity/relation by marriage) represented one of the essential distinctions of the ruling elite of fourteenth-century Granada. Ibn al-Khaṭīb understood its importance for life in Granada and he felt the need to mention it whenever two people were related by marriage. His perception has been taken as one of the most fundamental for historical research, as he drew on his personal experience in Granada. This study first defines the concept of the ruling elite of fourteenth-century Granada. Within this group, the concept of muṣāhara as understood by Ibn al-Khaṭīb is further elaborated. The definition of muṣāhara is followed by the description of its actual use among the families close to the office of the vizier (wazīr) and by Ibn al-Khaṭīb himself. The history of one of these families (al-Fihrī) has been hailed as an exceptional example of the “ruling elite family” that included contemporaries and adversaries of Ibn al-Khaṭīb. The example of the al-Fihrī family shows how strong and active their position was during the rule of every fourteenth-century emir. Consequently, this study demonstrates that the extensive Granadan families similar to those known from the fifteenth century had existed and cooperated with each other before this time.\n\nAbstractThe study of female onomastics of the Banū Marīn of Fez lacks a deep and monographic analysis, despite of being very useful to better define different features of the idiosyncrasy of this lineage. The main objective of this paper is precisely to cover this scientific gap, offering a philological and socio-cultural analysis of the wide catalog of female names present in the Merinid genealogical tree, from the scientific rigor. As we will try to demonstrate, such denominations constitute valuable resources to reconstruct the diverse identities (ethnic, geographical, prosopographic, cultural, etc.) of both these women and the sovereigns to whom they were related. Likewise, these names make it possible to identify with greater precision the strategies of political and religious legitimization that this dynasty designed in both the Arab socio-cultural scope and the Islamic religious sphere."
