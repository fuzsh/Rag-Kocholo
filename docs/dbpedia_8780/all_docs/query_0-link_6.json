A volume of this kind, which covers a large swathe of history, can only ever be the product of research, reading and conversations that have accumulated over many years. I am grateful to the numerous scholars, young and old, with whom I have had the pleasure of interacting during that time, and the many students who have discussed the Berber dynasties with me, and obliged me to provide a coherent narrative of this complex era. Particular thanks are due to Michael Brett for his ongoing support and interest in my work; to Maribel Fierro for her always stimulating, challenging and erudite perspectives on the Almohads; to Camilo Gómez-­Rivas, Allen J. Fromherz and Mariam Rosser-­Owen, younger scholars who have opened fresh vistas on the Almoravids and Almohads, respectively; and to Shady Hekmat Nasser who read and commented on the draft and provided numerous ­edifying snippets of information on religious scholars and many other topics. I am also grateful to the Leverhulme Trust for a two-­year research grant to explore political legitimacy in the Maghrib assisted by a post-­doctoral fellow, James A. O. C. Brown, and to the Department of Middle Eastern Studies, University of Cambridge, and Magdalene College for granting me a year’s sabbatical from teaching and administrative duties to complete the writing of this book. Thanks are also due to Professor Ian Netton with whom I first discussed the idea of adding a volume on the western Islamic dynasties to the Edinburgh series, and to the editorial staff at Edinburgh University Press, particularly Nicola Ramsey and Ellie Bush, who have been unfailingly courteous, despite the time it has taken me to fulfil my side of the bargain. I should also like to thank Dr Adrian Popescu and the Fitzwilliam Museum for supplying and allowing the reproduction of images from the coin collections, and Mariam Rosser-­Owen for kindly sharing her photographs of Tinmall with me. I am painfully aware that a whirlwind tour through two hundred years ix\n\nx | the a lmora vi d a nd a l mo h a d e mp ir e s of history naturally leads to a process of selectivity, with which not everyone will agree, and many unacknowledged intellectual debts, all such errors and lacunae are my own responsibility and I hope that readers may forgive me for them.\n\nAbbreviations and Note on Transliteration\n\nEI2 Encyclopedia of Islam, 2nd edition, ed.

Kate Fleet, Gudrun Krämer, Denis Matringe, John Nawas and Everett Rowson (Leiden: Brill, ­referenceworks.brillonline.com). This book follows the current British system of Arabic–English transliteration, used by the Encyclopedia of Islam 3, for the majority of technical Arabic terms and Berber terms in Arabic. In accordance with Edinburgh University Press guidelines, place names and personal names are rendered with markers for hamza (’) and ‘ayn (‘) but no other diacritics, except in the Index where they are fully vocalised. Similarly, names of authors and book titles transliterated from Arabic are fully vocalised in the Bibliography. Words that are now common in English and can be found in English dictionaries, such as amir, imam and jihad, are not vocalised or italicised. Place names present a particular problem in the Maghrib in that many now have common French, Spanish or English forms. In the case of Iberia, the Arabic place names of the past, sometimes themselves transliterated from Latin or Romance, now often have common Spanish forms. It has therefore proved impossible to be entirely consistent. Where a common English form of a name exists, such as Tangier or Algiers, I have used that in preference to transliteration or other European forms of the name. Where the Spanish or French form is widely used, I have adopted that, Córdoba and Tlemcen, for instance. In the case of less well-­known destinations in the Maghrib, those whose names are quite different in Arabic and European languages, or have changed over time, I have transliterated the names from Arabic, for example, Qasr al-­Majaz rather than Ksar es-­Seghir, Ribat al-­Fath rather than Rabat, Bijaya rather than Bougie. I have provided a list of place names giving both their common European and vocalised Arabic forms as an appendix which readers may consult if they wish. xi\n\nFor Tshiami\n\n50\n\nLisbon\n\n100\n\nAlarcos\n\nLLE SUS VA\n\nY\n\nL\n\nD\n\nA\n\nLE\n\nS\n\nAT\n\nMeknes\n\nS\n\nTaza\n\nAINS\n\nSijilmasa\n\nLA\n\nUNT\n\nFes\n\nMO Guercif\n\nNedroma Tlemcen\n\nTénès\n\nt\n\nKEY\n\nTahart\n\nS\n\nr\n\nIC\n\nAlgiers\n\nr\n\na\n\nMallorca\n\nGeographical features Major cities Smaller Towns Battle sites\n\nn\n\nMenorca\n\nQal‘at Bani Hammad\n\nAR\n\ne\n\nIbiza\n\nB\n\nE AL\n\nSUS VALLEY Marrakesh Silves Sagrajas\n\nOran\n\ne\n\nd\n\ni\n\nLérida\n\nDénia\n\nTortosa\n\nFraga\n\nValencia Játiva\n\nCuenca\n\nFigure 1.1 The Maghrib and al-Andalus, 1050–1250\n\nNul Lamta\n\nTinmall\n\nRIF\n\nMID\n\nT - A\n\nSalé\n\nG H H I\n\nAghmat\n\nRibat al-Fath\n\nMarrakesh\n\nBadajoz\n\nSagrajas\n\nToledo\n\nMadrid\n\nSaragossa\n\nLas Navas de Tolosa Mértola Córdoba Baeza Murcia Carmona Jaén Silves Baza Seville Lucena Guadix Granada Niebla Tavira Jerez Almería Málaga Cádiz M Algeciras Tangier Ceuta Asila\n\nBeja\n\nSantarem\n\n150 miles\n\n50 100 150 200 kilometres\n\nA t l a n t i c O c e a n\n\n0\n\n0\n\nBiskra\n\na\n\nJerez\n\nn\n\nGafsa\n\nTebessa\n\n‘Annaba\n\nS\n\nTunis\n\nAsila\n\n0\n\n0\n\na\n\n50\n\nSousse Monastir al-Mahdiyya Sfax\n\n50 miles\n\n100 kilometres\n\nMediterranean Sea\n\nMálaga\n\nGabes\n\nQayrawan\n\ne\n\nAlgeciras Algec Gibraltar Tarifa Gibraltar f o s t i Stra Ceuta Tangier Qasr sr al-Majaz\n\nCádiz\n\nBijaya\n\ne\n\nNIA\n\nSARDI\n\nAlmería\n\nGuardix\n\nBaza\n\n1 Introduction\n\nT\n\nhis volume provides an introduction to the history of the Almoravids and the Almohads, two of the most important empires of the medieval Islamic west, an area defined here as al-­Andalus (southern Spain and Portugal), the Maghrib and Ifriqiya (modern Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia and western Libya). The Almoravid and Almohad empires were the second and third of three great empires which ruled substantial parts of the Islamic west between the tenth and mid-­thirteenth centuries ce. The first empire, that of the Fatimids, is relatively well known due to their origins in the Middle East and the transfer of the dynasty from Ifriqiya (Tunisia) to Egypt in 972 ce, a move that brought them into the full light of Middle Eastern Islamic history. Their successors, however, who remained in the Maghrib and expanded north into the Iberian peninsula remain relatively unfamiliar outside the spheres of Andalusi and Maghribi history, both of which have traditionally been the preserve of French and Spanish rather than Anglophone scholarship,1 despite their integral place in the wider Islamic historical panorama as powerful contemporaries of the Fatimids, Seljuks, Zangids and Ayyubids; as participants in the Muslim response to the Crusades in their Iberian and North African manifestations; and as the dominant powers in the western Mediterranean for two centuries. The founders of these empires were two different Berber tribal peoples, the Sanhaja of the western Sahara and the Masmuda of the High Atlas mountains and the Sus valley in modern Morocco, who emerged from their respective homelands to conquer extensive territories in the name of their\n\nThe standard histories of the Almoravid and Almohad empires are J. Bosch Vilá, Los Almorávides, republished with a new foreword by Emilio Molina López, and A. Huici Miranda, Historia política del imperio almohade. More recently, the two empires have been dealt with extensively in the Historia de España, vol. 8: El retroceso territorial de Al-­Andalus: Almoravides y Almohades siglos XI al XIII, ed. María Jesús Viguera Molins. See also Vincent Lagardère, Les Almoravides I and Les Almoravides: le djihâd andalou, and Maribel Fierro’s numerous publications on the Almohads, some of which are collected in The Almohad Revolution: Politics and Religion in the Islamic West during the Twelfth–Thirteenth Centuries.\n\n1\n\n1\n\n2 | the almoravi d and almo h a d e mpir e s interpretations of Islam. The Almoravids emerged from the western Sahara in the 1050s to impose their control over the politically and religiously disunited western Maghrib, where Islam, in one form or another, was still often the religion of city rather than mountain or plain. They then crossed the Straits of Gibraltar into al-­Andalus, which had previously been ruled by the Umayyads of Córdoba, but was a troubled and politically divided region in the eleventh and twelfth centuries. The fragmentation of the Muslim political scene was in contrast to the slow consolidation of the Christian powers in the north, Castile-­León, Aragon and later Portugal, all of whom proved eager to expand their territories at the expense of each other and the small Muslim kingdoms to the south, and it was this threat that led to the Almoravid intervention in al-­Andalus. The Almoravid conquest took many decades, however, and shortly after their empire had reached its fullest extent in the 1110s, their control began to be challenged in the Maghrib by the nascent Almohad movement. The Almohads emerged from the High Atlas mountains during the 1130s, and by the time they conquered Marrakesh in 1147 they controlled most of the Almoravids’ erstwhile territories in the Maghrib and had begun to consolidate their control of al-­Andalus too. They then went on to conquer the rest of the Maghrib as far east as modern Tunisia, creating the largest Berber empire to have ever existed. Their power began to falter in the 1220s, however, as a result of external challenges and internal political and logistical problems and, by the 1250s, a series of smaller Islamic monarchies or sultanates had emerged across the region from Granada to Tunis and the Almohads controlled little more than Marrakesh, which they finally lost to the Zanata Berber Marinids in 1269. The heartlands of both these empires were situated in what is now Morocco and centred upon the fertile Atlantic plains that stretch inland from the coast to the eastern circle of the Middle Atlas, High Atlas and Anti-­Atlas mountain ranges. Both Fes and Marrakesh are located in this extended lowland region, whose agriculture has always been a vital source of tax revenue along with the fruits of long-­distance trade. Indeed, it was the arteries of trade which dictated the direction of expansion for these two empires. Over the course of two centuries, the Almoravids and Almohads established impressive administrative and judicial systems to rule their domains and contributed to the slow but steady Islamisation and Arabisation of the Maghrib, whilst also bringing the Berbers into the fractious family of great Islamic peoples. By the end of the Almohad era, the vast majority of the Maghribi population were Muslim and the sectarianism of earlier centuries was fading in favour of Maliki Sunnism, and a fertile synthesis of the cultures on each side of the Straits of Gibraltar had occurred. Each regime also made significant and\n\ni ntroducti on | 3 sometimes spectacular contributions to intellectual, artistic and architectural life during the centuries of their dominance, in the Islamic west itself and in the wider Mediterranean, African and Middle Eastern spheres too. Their achievements can be justly compared with those of contemporary eastern Islamic dynasties of Turkic origin, such as the Ghaznavids and the Seljuks, or the Kurdish Zangids and Ayyubids. As Michael Brett has delineated in several places, developments on the northeastern Turkic and southwestern Berber fringes of the Islamic world share many features, despite their specificities. Both the Turks and the Berbers were tribal peoples whose rise to imperial status was predicated on their opposition to the Fatimid caliphate and its Isma‘ili offshoots, and support for the Sunni response, personified by the ‘Abbasid caliph in Baghdad whom the Ghaznavids, Seljuks and Almoravids acknowledged as the caliph of Islam. The Almohads, meanwhile, in a unique display of self-­confidence, appropriated the idea of the Shi‘i imam and mahdī for themselves and proclaimed themselves Islam’s true caliphs and the Berbers as central rather than peripheral to the Islamic project.2 The Almohads’ independence in this respect demonstrated the growing confidence of Maghribi Berbers in enunciating their own superior understanding of the truth. However, from the Iberian perspective, which has been dominated by Spanish and Portuguese nationalist concerns, the North African Almoravids and Almohads were ‘fanatical’ in their approach to Islam and imperialist in their attitude towards al-­Andalus. Both have often been vilified as responsible for the passing of the diverse and glittering cultural life previously apparent in al-­Andalus and the introduction of a dour and oppressive religious and cultural atmosphere, which compromised the sophisticated but delicate balance of elements achieved within Andalusi society under the Umayyads of Córdoba (757–1031).3 To put it crudely, ‘African barbarians’ destroyed the tolerant and essentially ‘European’ interaction of Muslims, Christians and Jews known as convivencia which characterised the centuries before their arrival. Both have also been criticised for their ultimate failure to prevent the Christians of northern Iberia from advancing into al-­Andalus and reducing Muslim territory to the small kingdom of Granada by 1250, in contrast to the successful Levantine campaigns of the Zangids, Ayyubids and Mamluks against the Crusaders in the Levant. Certainly, the Almoravids and Almohads each entered al-­Andalus with a self-­proclaimed mission to unify See Brett, Rise of the Fatimids, pp. 430–2; Brett, ‘‘Abbasids, Fatimids and Seljuks’, pp. 689–98. 3 Menocal, Ornament of the World, pp. 43, 45. 2\n\n4 | the almoravi d and almo h a d e mpir e s the Muslim population, hold the frontier and ideally to regain territory lost to the Christian powers, and the insurmountable challenge of holding the frontier eventually contributed to the escalation of opposition to them and their demise. However, the fact that Portugal, León-­Castile and Aragon had ended Muslim rule in the majority of the peninsula by the 1250s should not obscure the fact that the Almoravid and Almohad presence slowed down and complicated that advance for generations. This volume starts from three premises: the first is that these empires of the Maghrib deserve to be ranked with the Islamic empires of the Mashriq as major contributors to the story of Islamic civilisation, and the Berbers placed with the Arabs, Persians and Turks as a major Islamic people. My second premise is that the Almoravids and Almohads were quite different from each other and thus need to be contrasted as well as considered together as Berber empires. The third premise is that the modern conceptual division between the African south and the European north of the Straits of Gibraltar obscures the complexities of the relationship between these Berber peoples, other indigenous Berber and Arab inhabitants of the Maghrib, and the population of al-­Andalus. The story of these empires is not a tale of ‘European’ Andalusis faced by ‘African’ invaders but, as recent scholarship shows, a series of negotiations and conflicts among different tribes, rural communities, and urban constituencies in the Maghrib and al-­Andalus to secure their own best interests in which the Almoravids and Almohads could be both winners and losers. Telling this story in a single volume is undoubtedly an over-­ambitious undertaking and there are inevitably simplifications and elisions within the narrative, but, nonetheless, it provides a starting point for the student or scholar and a springboard for those wishing to delve deeper into the history of this fascinating time and place within the broader span of Islamic history. Given my second premise that the Almoravids and Almohads were very different, their inclusion in a single volume requires some justification, particularly as they have traditionally been considered together in studies of al-­Andalus on the negative grounds that they were both ‘uncivilised’ if not ‘fanatical’ Berber regimes from North Africa. To place them together thus appears to perpetuate this wholly negative approach and to obscure the fact that, although lumped together under the rubric ‘Berber’, the Almoravids and Almohads drew their support from opposed and linguistically distinct groups of tribes in North Africa, and that the latter overthrew the former. That being said, there are also ways in which the two can be seen as comparable, if not similar, and in many instances the Almohads built on Almoravid foundations. Moreover, both provided some of the key data upon which the fourteenth-­century thinker and politician Ibn Khaldun based his famous cyclical theory of empire formation and collapse.\n\ni ntroducti on | 5 In a modern dialogue with Ibn Khaldun, Brett sees in the Fatimids, Almoravids and Almohads a series of imperial adventures which had the stated aim of Islamic revolution or reform, but actually entailed the Islamisation of the tribal hinterland of the Maghrib, large sections of which had been left virtually untouched by the Islamic conquests of the late seventh and early eighth centuries.4 While the Fatimids undertook this endeavour among the Kutama tribes of Ifriqiya, the Almoravid and Almohad missions to the Sanhaja and Masmuda, respectively, arose in geographically contiguous areas, the western Sahara and the High Atlas mountains. Moreover, both regimes aspired to rule similar areas and integrate them into centralising administrative systems, which manifestly changed the geopolitical map of the Maghrib. They also both faced the challenge of ruling al-­Andalus and dealing with the aggressive advance of Christian powers into territory held by Muslims for several centuries, and both of them funded their imperial endeavours by means of the trans-­Saharan trade and its Mediterranean offshoots in addition to rural taxation. A further point in favour of considering the Almoravids and Almohads together is actually the intense rivalry between them in search of a common goal: integration into the ‘Islamic world’ writ large as represented by al-­ Andalus, Ifriqiya and the Mashriq. While they adopted different religio-­ political ideologies, they fought for the same stakes: control of the Maghrib under the banner of normative Islam, however defined. The gradual amalgamation of these trends fostered the emergence of the Islamic society that endured, in Morocco especially, until the early twentieth century, making the Almoravid and Almohad eras a crucial phase in the region. Focus on these dynasties as key contributors to the maturing of an Islamic society in the Maghrib avoids seeing them as either African invaders of Spain or Berber nationalists, and puts them in their proper context: medieval Mediterranean and Islamic history. At the same time, it does not ignore the massive contributions made by al-­Andalus and, indeed, Ifriqiya to the evolution of society in the Islamic west between the late eleventh and the mid-­thirteenth ­centuries, and the rise of the west as an equal, if not dominant, part of the Dar al-­Islam. The Berber Empires in Khaldunian Thought As we have already seen above, the Berber empires have been interpreted from many different perspectives in modern scholarship which have often been inflected with concerns alien to the medieval era, particularly nationalism and See Brett, Ibn Khaldun, esp. chs I and VI.\n\n4\n\n6 | the almoravi d and almo h a d e mpir e s the Europe versus Africa binary, which is a variation on the civilised Occident versus decadent Orient theme. It is therefore instructive to turn to the indigenous, although equally subjective, interpretation of the Berber empires to be found in the writings of ‘Abd al-­Rahman b. Khaldun, the famous fourteenth-­ century thinker, politician and courtier, renowned for the introduction (muqaddima) to his voluminous history of the Arabs and Berbers, the Kitab al-­‘Ibar.5 Although Ibn Khaldun’s theories are perhaps cited too freely, the advantage of using them as a frame here is that he perceived the Almoravid and Almohad ventures as similar from a paradigmatic point of view and he is one of the main medieval historical authorities on their empires. Moreover, the fact that western scholars of the Maghrib have so persistently referred to him over the last century makes engagement with his theories unavoidable. French colonial historians of Morocco, in particular, adopted his view that both empires were indigenous Berber state-­building experiments, but added the interpretative twist that the demise of each empire was a cumulative Berber political failure that ultimately allowed ‘foreign’ Arab dynasties to impose themselves over a restive Berber population, a situation not resolved or rectified until the imposition of French colonial control. From a different standpoint, many modern anthropologists and historians have used Ibn Khaldun’s theories as their starting place and have analysed the great man’s life and œuvre as exceptional contributions to Islamic history, philosophy and even sociology.6 The Muqaddima to Ibn Khaldun’s history of the Arabs and Berbers presents his detailed analysis of human society and covers much more than the rise and fall of empires. He was, nonetheless, especially fascinated by the relationship between government and society and the role of tribes in the interplay between the two, a recurrent issue in the Maghrib of his day. Ibn Khaldun’s underlying premise, shared by many other Muslim thinkers, was that government preserved humankind from rampant savagery and was thus essential to the smooth functioning of society and the emergence of Ibn Khaldun, ‘Abd al-­Rahman, Kitab al-­‘Ibar wa-­Diwan al-­Mubtada’ wa’l-­Khabar fi Ayyam al-­‘Arab wa’l-­‘Ajam wa’l-­Barbar (henceforth Kitab al-­‘Ibar). The sections on North Africa were translated into French by W. MacGuckin de Slane as Histoire des Berbères (henceforth Histoire des Berbères). 6 It is not possible to give a full account of the copious literature on Ibn Khaldun. Classic works on him include: Muhsin Mahdi, Ibn Khaldun’s Philosophy of History; Walter Fischel, Ibn Khaldun in Egypt; Yves Lacoste, Ibn Khaldun: The Birth of History and the Past of the Third World; Aziz Al-­Azmeh, Ibn Khaldun, An Essay in Reinterpretation. Recent studies of his life and work include Abdesselam Cheddadi, Ibn Khaldûn: l’homme et le théoreticien de la civilisation; Gabriel Martinez-­Gros, Ibn Khaldoun et les sept vies de l’Islam; Fromherz, Ibn Khaldun, Life and Times. 5\n\ni ntroducti on | 7 civilised urban life (‘umrān). However, civilisation had its own downside in that it fostered an effete, decadent and morally questionable lifestyle in comparison with the simple, virtuous and hardy ways of the tribes, who also enjoyed the military capacity to capture cities. One key distinction Ibn Khaldun perceived between tribesmen (badw) and urbanites and peasants (ªa∂ar) was that the former had a much stronger sense of solidarity. Ibn Khaldun described the bonds uniting groups of tribesmen as ‘a‚abiyya, which has been translated variously as group or tribal solidarity, kinship or blood ties. This defined insiders and outsiders, thereby creating a metaphorical wall around a particular tribe or group. He believed that it was this quality, combined with their martial skills, that empowered tribesmen such as the early Arabs, the Almoravid Sanhaja and the Almohad Masmuda to move from arid or mountainous regions to conquer stable agrarian areas and urban centres and found great empires when galvanised by a religious message of some kind. Conversely, a charismatic leader in an urban context was likely to remain a demagogue or a rebel due to his limited military capacity. The acquisition of cities and the encounter with ‘umrān had an ambivalent transformative impact on tribal conquerors that included the decline of their ‘a‚abiyya and their virile fighting capacity, the swapping of the ‘first among equals’ ethos of tribal leadership for a more hierarchical dynastic model, and a consequent rise in tension between the dynasty and its tribal following. This pattern of ‘corruption’ meant that most tribal empires could only endure for three generations before they were swept away by fresh tribal conquerors with whom the cycle restarted. The only way to delay the inevitable turning of the wheel of fortune was for a dynasty to slow its decline by recruiting new military resources – slaves, mercenaries or tribal auxiliaries – to bolster their power and compensate for the decreasing loyalty and strength of their own tribal contingents. From the Khaldunian perspective, then, the formation of the Almoravid and Almohad empires demonstrated how two different tribal peoples could surmount their internal differences and feuds and create a large political entity (dawla) when their sense of ‘a‚abiyya was amplified by a charismatic leader with a particular religious message. The prime example of the phenomenon, however, was the rise of the Arabs themselves under the banner of Islam, with the Seljuk Turks in the east also providing grist for his theoretical mill. In Ibn Khaldun’s view, the importance of tribal peoples to state formation was not, therefore, a purely Maghribi phenomenon, but a broader characteristic of Islamic, if not global, history in which the rise of the Turks and later the Mongols figured alongside the achievements of the Arabs and the Berbers. He too, therefore, considered the Berbers as only one in a series of Muslim\n\n8 | the almoravi d and almo h a d e mpir e s tribal peoples who played the same game and as the western counterparts of the Arabs and Turks. It is helpful at this point to consider what the term ‘tribe’ actually means since many of the modern debates around Ibn Khaldun’s theory relate to the definition of a tribe, the role of kinship within tribal society, and the relationship between tribalism and nomadism. There are myriad ways of defining tribes, but some key elements are, first, the belief that all the members of the group are joined by kinship, whether real or fictive; secondly, a keen interest in genealogical ancestry to determine social and political relationships; and, thirdly, reliance on a form of political organisation often described by anthropologists as ‘segmentarity’, a theoretically egalitarian type of organisation in which several family ‘segments’ form one clan, several clan ‘segments’ form one tribe, several tribal ‘segments’ form a larger tribal people or confederation. Although ‘segments’ at each level may have disputes with each other, they unite in the face of a threat from outside or, in Ibn Khaldun’s theory, when inspired by a religious ideology. It is important to note that Maghribi tribesmen followed a wide range of lifestyles from sedentary agriculture to transhumance and full nomadism depending on the terrain in which they lived. In other words, the terms tribesman and nomad were not synonymous and tribesmen were often villagers in the Maghrib. One of the problems that arises in connection with Ibn Khaldun’s theory is the real role of tribes and kinship in empire building. Lapidus, for instance, argues that it was not tribes based on kinship, but chieftaincies based on religious or warrior credentials that actually expanded to become empires and, although tribesmen provided essential military support, it can be argued that most movements sought to surmount tribal divisions and also integrated a motley assortment of groups into their ruling elites, including townsmen and additional tribes with no kinship bonds to the dominant group.7 Moreover, ‘a‚abiyya and religion interacted with other factors, such as control of trade and other types of wealth in successful empire formation. Others have argued that the decline of ‘a‚abiyya and the incorporation of other elements into the ruling elite was not a problem but a necessity as empires transitioned from the conquest phase into a stable period of governance, and should not therefore be seen as a factor in the relative brevity of empires.8 Others again point out that Ibn Khaldun’s analysis, albeit brilliant, is not as universal as he thought but relevant only to particular types of society.9 Despite these caveats, Ibn Khaldun’s theory remains a powerful and provocative tool in the analysis See Lapidus, ‘Tribes and state formation’, pp. 25–47. See Messier, ‘Rethinking the Almoravids’, pp. 59–80. 9 See Gellner, Muslim Society, pp. 88–9. 7 8\n\ni ntroducti on | 9 of relations between tribes and state formation. Even if one can and should question the precise roles of tribes, ‘a‚abiyya and religion in Islamic empire formation, all three were undeniably present in the rise of the Almoravids and Almohads. Understanding the formation of the Berber empires, however, requires not only an understanding of the historiographical landscape, but also some background knowledge of the history of the Berbers and of the regions they came to rule. It is to this background that we now turn. The Maghrib and Ifriqiya before the Era of the Berber Empires The indigenous inhabitants of northwest Africa are collectively known in Arabic writing as the Berbers, a term derived from the Latin barbarus that indicated someone whose language was beyond the pale of Graeco-­Roman civilisation. Berber had a similar connotation in Arabic to the term ‘Ajam used for the Persians and other non-­Arabic speakers in the Middle East. The so-­called ‘Berbers’ did not, however, consider themselves to be one people but several, all speaking their own related but distinct languages which shared characteristics with Ethiopic and other languages of the neo-­Hamitic family. In ancient times some Berbers used a script described as Old Libyan or Numidian, which became known as Tifinagh in a later form and is the basis of the modern Amazigh script.10 However, Berber languages were not for the most part written and so we have to depend on external sources to elucidate the world of the Berbers, and the picture we draw may be partial or biased at times. The Berbers are assumed to have been tribal peoples since earliest times, but it should be remembered that we see them through the lenses of the Classical writers of Antiquity and medieval Arab (or Arabised) authors and little is actually known about their social and political organisation. Given the vast sweep of territory inhabited by the Berber-­speaking peoples from the western oases of Egypt to the Atlantic coast, it is hardly surprising that they had very varied modes of subsistence, which we shall explore in more detail in Chapter 5. Suffice to say here that on the fertile coastal plains Berbers lived in village communities and cultivated the land. Similar village communities could be found in many of the mountain ranges cutting across northwest Africa. Where the land was less fertile, tribes supplemented their cultivation with herding sheep and goats between summer pastures up in the hills and mountains and winter pastures at lower altitudes. Some tribes travelled in great annual circuits in search of pastures for their flocks. In the most arid parts of North Africa adjacent to the Sahara desert, tribes resorted to full nomadism, ranging over vast areas and living off the meat and milk Smith, ‘What happened to the ancient Libyans?’, p. 463, n. 8.\n\n10\n\n10 | the a lmora vi d a nd a l mo h a d e mpir e s of their animals with occasional supplements of dates and wheat bartered or bought from sedentary communities. Both the Phoenician Carthaginians and Romans left their mark on North Africa and encouraged the urbanisation of large sections of the Mediterranean littoral and the cultivation of wheat and oil for export to Rome. The Romans identified the ‘barbarians’ of North Africa as Libyans, Numidians, Garamantes and Mauritanians and sought to draw their chiefs into the Roman elite, a process that bore fruit with the appointment of the Roman-­educated Juba II as client king of Mauritania. In time, Christianity spread into North Africa and gained a firm foothold in the area from eastern Algeria to Libya, Roman Africa, which produced St Augustine and a new sedentary Latin Christian community of mixed Berber and migrant parentage, later called Afariqa (Africans) by the Arabs.11 As the Roman Empire contracted, the Vandals swept down through Iberia and crossed the Straits of Gibraltar to the Maghrib, moving swiftly eastwards to what is now Tunisia and Libya where they established a Vandal kingdom that perpetuated late Roman culture during the fifth and sixth centuries, after which the Byzantine general Belisarius restored direct eastern ‘Roman’ rule over the hinterland of Carthage and a string of coastal enclaves, including Ceuta. Other parts of the Maghrib reverted to indigenous Berber control, provincial Roman towns such as Volubilis near modern Meknes in Morocco shrank in size, and many attenuated urban communities retreated from vulnerable locations to easily defensible hilltops. Although the silence of the sources has encouraged many to assume that the Berbers were divided into numerous small, tribal chieftaincies during these centuries, two huge stepped pyramid tombs near Tiaret in Algeria hint that a substantial post-­ Roman kingdom existed in the western Maghrib.12 The idea that the people who built the tombs may have been from the Sahara where similar tombs have also been found provides an intriguing parallel with the later northward movement of the Almoravids. When the Arabs pushed west in the late seventh century ce after their conquest of Byzantine Egypt in 642, the society they encountered in what is now Libya and Tunisia, an area they called Ifriqiya (after Roman Africa), was one of tribal peoples akin to their own organised in smaller or larger chieftaincies and kingdoms interspersed with sedentary Latinate Christian townsmen and villagers, the Afariqa.13 The relationship that developed between the incoming Arab tribesmen and the Berber tribes is an interesting one. Amara, ‘L’Islamisation du Maghreb centrale’, pp. 113–14.

The other side of the coin, however, was that the processes of war – alliance, defeat, captivity, enslavement and liberation through conversion – tied the Arabs and Berbers closely together.14 Many Berber men entered the Islamic armies as clients of Arab masters, and many Berber women ended up in the harems of the Middle East where they became mothers to important figures such as the first Umayyad amir of al-­Andalus, ‘Abd al-­Rahman I, whose mother was a Nafza Berber.15 As the Islamic armies moved west through North Africa, they thus became more and more Berber in their composition. By the time they reached what is now Morocco and cast their gaze across the Straits of Gibraltar to Visigothic Spain, not only was the rank and file of the army predominantly Berber, there were also Berber clients in positions of command, the most famous being the conqueror of Visigothic Spain, Tariq b. Ziyad, client of the Arab general Musa b. Nusayr. Although these new Berber recruits were nominally Muslim, the majority did not speak Arabic.16 The Andalusi historian Ibn al-­ Qutiyya recounts that when ‘Abd al-­Rahman I was trying to drum up support in al-­Andalus in the 750s, he sent Berbers to speak to their kinsmen in the Berber tongue (kalām al-­Barbar) to persuade them to join him.17 In contrast to the Middle East and al-­Andalus where Arabisation occurred more speedily than conversion to Islam, in North Africa linguistic Arabisation continued to lag behind conversion for centuries in the countryside. It was only in the Almohad era that more thorough-­going rural Arabisation began to occur as a result of the Almohads’ westward transfer of the Arab Banu Hilal and Banu Sulaym tribes, who had previously migrated from Egypt into Ifriqiya, to serve as auxiliary troops. The Berber languages were gradually pushed back into the mountains, but did not die out: in Morocco today Berber languages remain the mother tongue of 40–60 per cent of the population. Despite the absorption of numerous Berbers into the army, the Muslim conquest was initially limited to a series of towns and their hinterlands, while most rural areas remained fairly untouched. The most important of these Islamic urban communities was that of Qayrawan in Ifriqiya, a new See Norris, The Berbers in Arabic Literature. Ruggles Fairchild, ‘Mothers of a hybrid dynasty’, p. 70. 16 Some of those from Ifriqiya may have spoken Latin as well as a Berber vernacular.

Small Muslim garrisons could also be found in many captured pre-­Islamic towns along the coastal littoral to Tangier, and it was from these nodes that the transformation of the Berber interior began as the result of the Kharijite rebellion that erupted in 739–40. The Kharijites were a group of Arab Muslims who objected to the way issues of succession and leadership in the Islamic community were handled by the fourth caliph, ‘Ali, and his rival for power, Mu‘awiya. As a result, they left (kharaja) the rest of the Muslim community and spread the message that the caliph should be selected for his qualities as a Muslim and a leader rather than because of his ancestry. This message was very appealing to Berber troops who resented their inferior status to the Arabs and willingly joined the Kharijite rebellion when it started in Tangier in 739. As a consequence of the revolt, several new Kharijite Muslim states emerged in the interior, and indigenous and eastern Islamic missionaries initiated the conversion of the Berbers to Islam by example, persuasion and trade rather than by warfare. One such Kharijite missionary was Ibn Rustam, whose father was a Persian soldier in Qayrawan, while another ideological refugee to establish a new polity backed by Berber tribes was the ‘Alid Idris b. ‘Abd Allah who migrated west from Egypt and founded Fes. These small states had a major social impact. Not only did they act as bulwarks for rural Berber Islamisation, they also functioned as motors for urbanisation in areas where it had previously been very limited and encouraged the migration of Arabs, Persians and also non-­Muslim traders, especially Jews, into the interior. While the Idrisids founded Fes, the Rustamids founded Tahart (modern Tiaret in Algeria) and the Miknasa Berber Midrarids founded Sijilmasa, the great caravan city that lured the Almoravids from the desert. Conversely, Berbers from these towns began to travel to Córdoba, Qayrawan and the Middle East for trade, religious education and to perform the pilgrimage to Mecca, giving them knowledge and experience of the wider Islamic world which they brought back to the most remote corners of the Maghrib. The involvement of Berbers in such peregrinations was instrumental in generating both the Almoravid and Almohad movements. In the centuries following the conquest, Arabic writers evolved a full genealogical ancestry for the Berbers, which divided them into two main groups descended from eponymous ancestors, the supposedly nomadic Butr and the predominantly sedentary Baranis, each of which contained numerous tribes and peoples such as the Nafusa, Nafzawa and Miknasa (Butr), and the\n\n‘Ajisa\n\nLawata (Libya)\n\nJazula\n\nAzdaja\n\nLamta\n\nNafzawa (Ifriqiya)\n\nLamtuna\n\nVeiled Sanhaja of the Sahara\n\nHimyarite Arabs\n\nKutama/Zawawa (Ifriqiya)\n\nBurnus\n\nMiknasa (western Maghrib)\n\nFigure 1.2 The genealogies of the Berber tribes according to Ibn Khaldun\n\nAwraba (western Maghrib)\n\nHawwara (Ifriqiya)\n\nButr\n\nGuddala\n\nMasufa\n\nSanhaja (western Maghrib, Sahara) Claim to Arab ancestry\n\nBanu Fatin\n\nSanhaja (central Maghrib)\n\nNafusa (Ifriqiya)\n\nMasmuda/Ghumara (western Maghrib)\n\nZanata (central Maghrib)\n\n14 | the a lmora vi d a nd a l mo h a d e mpir e s Awraba, ‘Ajisa, Azdaja, Masmuda, Kutama, Hawwara and Sanhaja (Baranis).18 From early on, the dominant Arab-­Islamic paradigm of history depicted the Berbers as erring and ignorant, but as Berbers learnt to express themselves in Arabic they were able to depict their own world in their new language, creating works such as the ‘Boasts of the Berbers’ (Mafakhir al-­Barbar) which gave them an honourable place in the civilisation of which they were becoming part and inserted them within its Semitic foundation myths.19 One important aspect of this was the development of legends of origin that connected the Berbers to Middle Eastern Semites, either as migrants in Biblical times or as Yemeni Arabs who migrated west prior to the rise of Islam and gradually adopted the language and mores of the peoples around them. This desire to create a connection with the scripturally endorsed genealogical past of the Semitic peoples of the Middle East and classical Islamic civilisation manifested itself in the foundation myths and genealogies of both the Almoravids and Almohads, who gave the Berbers a more politically dominant role than ever before. Al-­Andalus before the Era of the Berber Empires Like coastal North Africa, the Iberian peninsula was part of the Roman Empire and many of its cities, including Córdoba, Mérida and Tarragona, had served as Roman provincial capitals. After Constantine made Christianity the religion of the Roman Empire, most of the urban inhabitants of Iberia converted to the new religion, although many rural communities, especially in the isolated mountainous northwest, retained older pre-­Christian beliefs and practices for centuries. During the fifth and sixth centuries, the Visigoths entered Iberia and gradually established a post-­Roman monarchy comparable to the kingdom of the Vandals in Ifriqiya but of longer duration. At first there were deep tensions between the Visigothic warrior aristocracy, who professed Arianism, and the Catholic Iberian churchmen. However, during the sixth century many Visigoths converted to Catholicism and parallel Arian and Catholic episcopal hierarchies emerged, paving the way for the official conversion of the kingdom itself to Catholicism at the Third Church Council in Toledo in 589 and the development of a mutually supportive relationship between the king and clergy.20 During this era, Iberian society consisted of the Visigothic warrior For the problems in using literary sources to classify the peoples of North Africa, see Smith, ‘What happened to the ancient Libyans?’. 19 See Shatzmiller, The Berbers and the Islamic State, pp. 5–39; Sánchez, ‘Ethnic disaffection’, pp. 181–4. 20 Collins, Visigothic Spain, p. 67. 18\n\ni ntroducti on | 15 aristocracy, the Romano-­ Iberian churchmen, Iberian townsfolk, a small Jewish minority and a large rural peasantry. Although urban life continued in Córdoba and the foremost Visigothic towns of Toledo and Seville, Roman towns decreased in size and, in more vulnerable and isolated locations, the population often moved to defensible hill-­top locations as in North Africa. Across the countryside, the great slave-­worked latifundias of the Roman era seem to have been replaced by hamlets and villages inhabited by free peasants who paid tribute rather than being subjected to serfdom.21 The Visigoths and the Church certainly held large tracts of land, but the way they were administered and the status of those who worked on them is unknown despite controversial speculations about proto-­feudalism.22 Post-­conquest anecdotes in the history written by a Muslim of Visigothic ancestry, Ibn al-­Qutiyya, suggest the extent of such landed estates and their maintenance into the Islamic era. The sons of Witiza, the penultimate Visigothic king, supposedly agreed to ally with the Muslim invaders in return for keeping their 3,000 estates, and decades later ‘Abd al-­Rahman I became quite jealous of one son, Artabas, due to the constant arrival of supplies from his numerous estates outside his tent when they were travelling together. ‘Abd al-­Rahman confiscated the estates, but later returned twenty of them to avert the complete impoverishment of Artabas.23 Another anecdote depicts Artabas generously giving a Muslim ascetic an estate with which to support himself and then being implored for similar gifts by Muslim notables, to which he graciously responded by doling out 100 more estates!24 The agricultural abundance of southern Iberia and its settled village-­based society made it an appealing destination for Berber raids from North Africa. In 711, however, this pattern of raids turned into the crossing of a large well-­ organised Muslim army led by Tariq b. Ziyad, probably with the collusion of the lord of Ceuta, Julian, and other partisans of the recently deceased King Witiza, including his sons, who opposed the accession of Roderic.25 The Muslims defeated Roderic’s army in battle near Medina Sidonia and initiated the Islamic conquest of Iberia, a development that Roderic’s opponents probably had not foreseen.26 This was a very different conquest to that\n\nCollins, Visigothic Spain, pp. 205–9.

First, the Iberian population were not, for the most part, trained combatants. They expected the Visigothic army to fulfil their defensive needs, and when it was defeated communities were ill-­prepared to defend themselves, unlike the tribes of North Africa, and were therefore willing to negotiate. Secondly, since Iberia was populated by Christians, at least in the towns, the Muslim conquerors offered them protection and freedom to practice their religion in return for payment of the poll tax (jizya) in keeping with practices in conquered Byzantine and Sasanian lands in the east. In effect, the conquest replaced one military aristocracy, the Visigoths, with another, the Muslims, and while churchmen lamented the defeat of a Christian power by followers of the strange new religion or heresy of Islam, the population at large were reassured by the continuity of daily life. Furthermore, the Arabs clustered in the main towns and river valleys and initially made little mark on more remote country areas, while the mountainous, rainy regions of Galicia, Asturias and the Basque country were not conquered at all. Even in conquered regions, many Visigothic lords such as Theodemir in Murcia continued to hold their estates and lands and paid the Muslims an agreed tribute. Berbers, the bulk of the conquest force, probably settled more widely in the countryside, especially in the Guadiana and Tajo valleys, although the absence of incontrovertible evidence has stimulated considerable debate on the point.27 From the longer-­term perspective, however, the important thing is the phenomenon of Berber migration into Iberia. While significant Arab migration ceased after the arrival of Arab contingents from Syria in the 740s, following the Kharijite rebellion in North Africa, the sporadic movement of Berbers, usually as military recruits, became a major feature of the relationship between the two sides of the Straits of Gibraltar and culminated in the Almoravid and Almohad absorption of al-­Andalus into their respective empires. Naturally, Iberian society was not static between the Muslim conquest and the arrival of the Almoravids nearly four hundred years later. Social change began in the towns in or near which Arab military contingents (junds) settled such as Córdoba, which soon became the capital of Muslim al-­Andalus, Seville, Elvira (Granada), Jaén and Tudmir (Murcia). In this new urban and sedentary environment, the old tribal genealogies of the Arabs came to function as indicators of aristocratic lineage for individual families rather than as a mode of organisation or military mobilisation and, over the centuries, many non-­Arabs acquired such genealogies as markers of status. The Muslim presence also impacted upon indigenous Christian Iberians as\n\nHitchcock, Muslim Spain Reconsidered, pp. 24–9; Kennedy, Muslim Spain and Portugal, pp. 16–18.\n\n27\n\ni ntroducti on | 17 Arabic and Islam became dominant across the south, gradually reducing the Latin Christian majority to an Arabised Christian minority known in scholarship as the Mozarabs, although recently scholars have become wary of this denomination and favour Andalusi Christians instead.28 Arabisation also affected the predominantly urban Jewish minority, but conversion to Islam was uncommon and the Jewish community probably expanded rather than diminished. It was also invigorated by the opportunity Muslim rule presented to Jews to form new commercial and intellectual connections with co-­religionists across the Islamic world. In charting social change, we are best informed about Córdoba, which became a centre for the dissemination of Arabic, Islamic learning and, by the tenth century, literary and artistic culture. Migrants from the east contributed to these developments as did Arabised Berbers and indigenous Iberian converts to Islam, creating a society in which Arabic was dominant but Romance-­Arabic bilingualism common.29 In most Andalusi towns and cities, Arabisation led slowly but surely to the conversion of a substantial proportion of the Christian population to Islam with a surge of conversion probably occurring in the mid-­ninth century at the time of the Córdoban martyr movement, led by the monk Eulogius who whipped a significant section of the Christian population into resistance to rampant Arabisation and Islamisation. His adherents, many of whom came from families of mixed religious affiliation, made repeated public denunciations of the Prophet Muhammad, an act punishable by death in Islamic law, and were ultimately executed after refusing to recant.30 Arabisation and conversion also occurred in the countryside, albeit more slowly and in a manner that de Epalza describes as ‘default conversion’, that is, the drift of the population from one religion to the other as the rural Christian infrastructure contracted and disappeared.31 The sparse evidence for the rural situation, however, has led to stark differences of interpretation between those who believe that the countryside remained Christian and Romance speaking and those who uphold widespread Arabisation and conversion to Islam. From the late ninth to early tenth centuries, conversion triggered immense social tensions between the different Muslim communities in a­ l-­Andalus – the Arabs, the Berbers and Iberian converts known as Muwalladun – m ­ anifested in revolts and bids for provincial autonomy from Umayyad Córdoba in which the Muwalladun fought for parity with those claiming superior aristocratic Hitchcock, Muslim Spain Reconsidered, p. 59.

The irony of this was that the racial or ethnic distinctions between groups were often minimal because the social construction of identity was predicated, in most cases, solely on patrilineality, that is, one’s father’s identity. The Umayyad ruling family provide an illustrative case: the mothers of several Umayyad amirs were northern Christian concubines, often of Basque or Navarrese extraction, and many amirs were blond and blue-­eyed.32 However, no one considered them other than a pure Meccan Arab lineage based on their paternal line. While those of Arab ancestry carefully recorded and vaunted their genealogies, conversion, intermarriage and concubinage gradually produced a social reality of Arabic-­speaking Andalusi Muslims of varied origins with close relationships to the Arabised Christian and Jewish minorities who shared their language and culture. During the tenth century newcomers – fresh waves of Berber tribal migrants from North Africa and ‘Slavs’ (‚aqāliba)33 imported from the north to serve in the Umayyad army – came to be conceptualised as the ‘outsiders’ in contrast to the Andalusi Muslim majority of townsmen and peasants and their non-­Muslim neighbours. Most of these newcomers were fighters who entered the politico-­military ruling group and several of their chiefs and commanders became rulers of Ta’ifa principalities, such as the ‘Slav’ Mujahid who became lord of Dénia and the Sanhaja Berber Zirids of Granada. These ‘new’ Berbers were considered to be distinct from the ‘old’ Berbers who had settled in al-­Andalus during the conquest era, and their arrival prefigured that of the Almoravids a century later. The overall impression given of al-­Andalus in the eleventh century is a relatively densely populated, fertile land in which village communities, professing Islam or Christianity, tilled the soil and tended their gardens, orchards and flocks. The ruling class consisted of Andalusis but also the Berber or Slavic newcomers mentioned in the previous paragraph, all of whom sought to exploit the wealth of the countryside through direct taxation or land grants. Al-­Andalus was more urbanised than most of the Maghrib and sustained a thriving urban culture characterised by a sophisticated industrial sector, interest and investment in Arabic literature, and a self-­confident religious class. The protected religious minorities were prominent and, in the Christian case, quite numerous with churches and monasteries as well as mosques within urban and suburban zones.\n\nRuggles Fairchild, ‘Mothers of a hybrid dynasty’, p. 69. The ‚aqāliba were slaves from the central and eastern reaches of Europe, although some were Slavic, others were Frankish and Germanic and a handful came from the Mediterranean.\n\n32 33\n\ni ntroducti on | 19 A more militarised society pertained in the areas closest to the Christian-­ ruled north where raiding into the northern principalities and defence against their raiding in the opposite direction was a regular occurrence. Despite the formal enmity exhibited in religio-­political rhetoric, this pattern had engendered familiarity and contact across the marches (thughūr) for ­centuries and one must be wary of seeing this as religious warfare rather than territorial aggrandizement prior to the era of the Crusades and Maghribi jihad. However, as the Christian kingdoms began to exert both military and ­financial pressure on the Ta’ifa rulers, the old equilibrium began to falter, leading to repeated Andalusi appeals for Almoravid help to halt the Castilian advance beyond Toledo, which fell in 1085. Yusuf b. Tashfin responded to their pleas in 1086 thus setting in train the Almoravid conquest of the Ta’ifa kingdoms, the incorporation of al-­Andalus and the Maghrib into a single empire, and the rise of a new jihad-­based political paradigm shared by the Almoravids and the Almohads. * The following chapters utilise Arabic primary sources and the copious scholarship on these dynasties, both classic studies and more recent reappraisals, to present an aperçu into the political formation of these empires and their position within the longer span of Islamic and western Mediterranean history, while also considering the society and economy over which they ruled and the kinds of religious and material culture they supported. Chapters 2 and 3 provide a chronological and political narrative of each regime. Although such narratives are sometimes considered rather dry, it is impossible to understand the Almoravid and Almohad eras without establishing the chronological framework and the geopolitical context within which these dynasties functioned. Moreover, dynastic chroniclers considered the succession of rulers and military campaigns to be of paramount importance, therefore these chapters also reflect the preoccupations and biases of some genres of Islamic historiography. For many medieval Muslim writers, for instance, a vital dimension of the history of this period was resistance to the Christian advance in Iberia, often understood as jihad just as Christians frequently understood their actions as crusade or the ‘reconquest’ (reconquista) of Christian land. Chapter 2 charts the rise of the Almoravid movement among the Sanhaja tribes of the northwestern Sahara, their use of jihad ideology to combat rivals of other sects and ethno-­linguistic groups, and their creation of a territorial domain centred on their new capital of Marrakesh. This gave the Almoravids a new ‘Moroccan’ geopolitical focus which drew them north and led on to their intervention in Iberia, creating an important commercial, political and cultural corridor from West Africa to central Iberia. The chapter will then explore how the Almoravid jihad gained a new dimension in the form of\n\n20 | the a lmora vi d a nd a l mo h a d e mpir e s military campaigns to hold the Muslim frontier against growing pressure from the nascent kingdoms of the Christian north, signalled by the fall of Toledo to Alfonso VI of Castile in 1085. Holding the Iberian frontier soon entailed incorporating the fractious Andalusi Muslim Ta’ifa kingdoms into the Almoravid empire, a development that transformed al-­Andalus from the western Islamic metropole it had been for centuries into a province of empires whose heartlands were in North Africa. The chapter will conclude with the contraction of the Almoravid empire from the 1120s and its replacement by a new Maghribi power, the Almoravid’s greatest rivals, the Almohads. Chapter 3 turns to the Almohads of the High Atlas mountains and the Sus valley, beginning with the mission of its founder Ibn Tumart, the development of the Almohad movement, and then its transformation into an empire-­building project. It will go on to survey the new geopolitical axis created by the Almohads who exerted no control over the Sahara, but moved to dominate the entire fertile coastal strip of North Africa as far as Ifriqiya (Tunisia) and the southern part of the Iberian peninsula. The chapter will explore the revolutionary conquest phase of the Almohad movement and their jihad against the Normans and Iberians, their slow creation of a stable, centralised empire, and the factors that led to the collapse of the empire and the emergence of a series of Almohad successor states in the early thirteenth century. Chapter 4 will move on to consider the social configurations of the period, beginning with some general comments on Muslim theorisations of society and regional society prior to the rise of the Almoravids. It will then look at the social composition of the Almoravid and Almohad ruling elites, starting with the nomadic Almoravid Sanhaja and their tribal solidarity, which, to a large degree, defined the ruling cohort, then moving on to additional elements that became more or less integrated into the elite. The chapter will then explore the social background of the Almohads, whose support was recruited predominantly, but not exclusively, among the Masmuda of the High Atlas, and the subsequent diversification of the elite through the formation of a new scholarly cohort of mixed background, the recruitment of other Berber tribes, and the transfer of numerous Arab tribes from Ifriqiya to Morocco. After reviewing the social structure of the Almoravid and Almohad elites, the chapter will turn to wider society, rural and urban, tribal and non-­tribal. Gender roles and relations with other Muslims, Christians and Jews will also form part of the discussion. A feature of Almoravid society was the relative freedom of Sanhaja women that appeared to others to be at variance with ‘Islamic’ norms. The Almohads repeatedly criticised the Almoravids for their inversion of gender roles, indicating that the status of women was a live\n\ni ntroducti on | 21 issue at the time. Below the level of the elite, however, the reality of life for most women was probably fairly constant over the Almoravid and Almohad centuries and determined by a range of local customs and attitudes which we shall try to glimpse through the scattered references to women in the sources. Although both eras have been seen as negative for the status and position of religious minorities, the Almoravids and Almohads diverged significantly in their treatment of them. The Almoravids adopted a strict legalistic approach which entailed firm application of the Shari‘a rules related to the position of protected minorities, in cities at least, while the Almohads are reported to have denied the existence of the dhimma, or pact of protection, historically accorded to monotheistic religious minorities. This section will show that the actual experience of minority communities, however, depended as much on political and strategic exigencies as on religious dogma, and it had begun to deteriorate in al-­Andalus prior to the arrival of the Almoravids as the pressure from the northern Christian kingdoms increased. On the other hand, both regimes ultimately bowed to military and economic pressures and recruited Christian soldiers and permitted Christian merchants to ply their trade in their lands. Chapter 5 will look at the economic underpinnings of the Almoravid and Almohad empires, which involved direct and indirect agricultural exploitation and promotion of the trans-­Saharan and Mediterranean trades. Right from the outset, the Almoravids sought to control the trans-­Saharan trade and this was one of their motivations for expanding across the Sahara and capturing the ‘port’ cities of Sijilmasa and Awdaghust on either side of the desert. Secure access to salt, gold and slaves was a major factor in their success and Almoravid gold dinars became the most valued currency in the Mediterranean at the time. The Almohads were similarly keen to benefit from trade and, despite their supposed intolerance towards non-­Muslims in their domains, they allowed non-­Muslim traders to reside in several coastal and inland entrepôts to keep trade buoyant. This chapter will consider the workings of the economy and commerce, and suggest how ordinary people made a living by reference to geographical accounts of the agriculture, markets and manufactures of the Maghrib and al-­Andalus at this time. It will also explore how each regime interacted with the economy through taxation, the granting of estates and investment in agricultural development. In Chapter 6, we will move on to investigate the types of faith, religious practice and knowledge that existed in al-­Andalus and the Maghrib from the mid-­eleventh to the mid-­thirteenth centuries, beginning with an overview of the prior development of Islamic law (Shari‘a) and its methodology (fiqh), theology (kalām) and mysticism (Sufism) in the Islamic west. The chapter will then return to the imperial religious ideologies of the Almoravids and\n\n22 | the a lmora vi d a nd a l mo h a d e mpir e s Almohads themselves which defined the dominant ‘state’ form of religion and played a major role in shaping the subsequent religious landscape of the Maghrib. The Almoravids adopted Maliki Sunnism as an imperial legal framework which they then implanted from Córdoba to West Africa, creating an unprecedented level of religio-­legal homogeneity in the region. While not as sophisticated as the famous Ottoman integration of qānūn (in this case, customary law) with the Shari‘a, the Almoravids had a similar end in mind by requiring that legal decisions made in Marrakesh on the Berber periphery concurred with opinions from the existing centres of Maliki law – Córdoba and Qayrawan. Almohadism contributed in a different way by promoting a more sophisticated approach to religion which integrated scholastic theology, philosophy, law and Sufism. Although Malikism remained the dominant madhhab of the Maghrib, it was leavened by the Almohad theological contribution. The chapter will also explore the complex relationship between religious and non-­religious sciences, exemplified by the Almohads’ perceived religious dogmatism and simultaneous patronage of Aristotelian philosophy, and look at issues of grassroots conversion and alternative sites of religious authority. On a popular level, the conversion of the majority of the rural population to Islam and the diffusion of Sufism across the region encouraged the spread of new forms of religiosity which were person-­rather than text-­centred. Several of the founding fathers of Andalusi and Maghribi mysticism lived at this time and while the population in general may not have understood the intricacies of the mystical path, they responded wholeheartedly to those of a pious, ascetic and mystical bent who settled among them. As we shall see, relations between Sufis and the state were ambivalent because of their growing popularity among the masses which appeared to rulers to have potential political ramifications, regardless of whether Sufis themselves were politically inclined. Chapter 7 will turn to material culture as one of the most striking aspects of this period is the flourishing of art and architecture in the far west of North Africa and the emergence of a regional style that stretched from al-­ Andalus across to Ifriqiya. There is little to suggest that the earlier towns founded in the area that is now Morocco had truly monumental buildings. The most important city was almost certainly Sijilmasa which had a large great mosque by the tenth century, while Fes was made up of two warring townships, neither of which boasted particularly splendid great mosques. The Almoravids changed this with the foundation of Marrakesh c. 1070, which became an imperial centre embellished with fine palaces, mosques and markets within one to two generations. The Almoravids also transformed Fes into a single entity and built large great mosques across their domains, as well as numerous smaller ones. In doing so, they created a new Maghribi architectural\n\ni ntroducti on | 23 style that blended Andalusi, Saharan and eastern Islamic e­ lements in a new synthesis carried forward by the Almohads. Although the Almohads were deeply hostile to the Almoravids, and in some cases demolished their mosques on the grounds that they were not correctly aligned towards Mecca, they fully understood the power of imperial art and architecture and quickly moved to produce a series of strident, militant Almohad monuments, including mosques, fortified citadels, looming gateways and city walls. Their hallmark was the square tower minaret of such huge proportions that each one they built dominated the skyline of its host city, but, as fragments of their palace in Seville show, they did not completely eschew luxurious and delicate decoration. They also began to use the faience mosaics and tiles that came to be a quintessential feature of both Andalusi and Maghribi art from the thirteenth century onwards, alongside the carved stucco already used by the Almoravids before them. Together these dynasties established the artistic and architectural canon which we now perceive as characteristic of much of the Maghrib. Chapter 8 will conclude the volume by enumerating the achievements of the Almoravids and Almohads in Islamising the Maghrib and trying to hold the Muslim frontier against the Christian kingdoms in al-­Andalus. It will flag up their contribution to the future shape of the Maghrib and also the areas in which both regimes faltered. It will then compare their track records with developments across the Islamic world at the same time to locate them in the broader span of Islamic history and place them alongside their rivals and peers in the Mashriq.\n\n2 The Almoravids: Striving in the Path of God\n\nT\n\nhis chapter and Chapter 3 explore the political contours of the Almoravid and Almohad states as a prelude to investigating the society and culture over which they presided. In both empires, politics and military activity were deeply entwined and therefore military campaigns are the uppermost strand in the chronicles, and rulers appear first and foremost as commanders in chief, recruiting, mobilising and leading their armies. However, political life also involved the formation of a judicial system, administrative structures to gather taxes and maintain correspondence, and the nurturing of the religious and intellectual environment. Medieval Islamic government was minimal in comparison with modern government, so for the majority of the population in both al-­Andalus and the Maghrib, ‘good’ government meant a regime capable of maintaining law and order, and one that gathered taxes permitted by the Shari‘a (Islamic law) in a fair manner. The limited range of Shari‘a taxes, however, meant that rulers usually had to collect non-­canonical taxes, risking unpopularity and even rebellion. In the religious sphere, rulers were expected to be personally pious and devout and to defend the faith. This took two main forms in the eleventh to thirteenth centuries. First, rulers had to defend Islam by force of arms, a task usually described as jihad, which might entail warfare against Muslims of other ‘heretical’ sects or action against rebels as well as fighting against the Christian powers of Iberia and the northern Mediterranean. Secondly, rulers also had to show respect and deference to religious professionals, collectively known in this region as the ‘ulamā’ (scholars) or fuqahā’ (jurists), and contribute to the religious infrastructure by building or augmenting mosques and other religious facilities. The creation of a form of imperial government that responded to these established Islamic religio-­political conventions entailed a very steep learning curve for the Almoravids and the Almohads, given their origins beyond Islamic state control in the deserts and mountains of the south. The first of the two, the Almoravid movement, drew its support from a small cohort of Sanhaja Berber tribes who resided in the Sahara, the Guddala, 24\n\nt h e al m ora vi ds: stri vi ng i n the pa th o f go d | 25 Córdoba Granada\n\nSeville\n\nAlgeciras Ceuta\n\nA t l a n t i c O c e a n\n\nGHUMARA Fes\n\nSalé\n\nTunis Bijaya Tahart SANHAJA Qayrawan Qal‘at Bani Hammad IFRIQIYA Tlemcen CENTRAL MAGHRIB ZANATA\n\nWESTERN MAGHRIB MASMUDA Aghmat\n\nal-Mahdiyya\n\nTripoli\n\nSijilmasa\n\nJAZULA Nul Lamta LAMTA (Sanhaja)\n\nS\n\nE\n\nR\n\nT\n\nD\n\nR\n\nA\n\nMASUFA (Sanhaja)\n\nE\n\nA\n\nLAMTUNA (Sanhaja)\n\n200\n\n400\n\n600\n\n800 kilometres\n\nA\n\nH\n\n0 0\n\n200\n\n400\n\n600 miles\n\nS\n\nAzuggi GUDDALA (Sanhaja) Awdaghust\n\nZANATA\n\nMain tribal confederations of the Maghrib, c.1050\n\nIFRIQIYA\n\nMain geographic regions of the Maghrib\n\nFes\n\nMain towns and cities of the Maghrib, c.1050\n\nFigure 2.1 The distribution of the Berber peoples, c. 1050\n\nthe Lamtuna and the Masufa. They were pastoralists who roamed the desert, moving from well to well with their flocks and felt tents. Living far beyond the area of the early Islamic conquests, they were almost certainly introduced to Islam between the ninth and eleventh centuries by Kharijite Muslim Berber traders participating in the trans-­Saharan trade who needed their protection and assistance.1 We know very little about the pre-­Islamic history of the Sanhaja, but later quasi-­historical accounts claimed that they were ­descendants of the ancient Himyaritic kings of Yemen. There is no relationship between the Lamtuna and the Berbers, except on the maternal side. The Sanhaja trace their lineage to Himyar. They left the Yemen and travelled to the Sahara which became their home in the Maghrib.2\n\nThis was a mythical genealogy claimed by many Berber tribes to give them a place within the Arab-­Islamic scheme of history. The details of the See Lewicki, ‘Les origines de l’Islam dans les tribus berbères du Sahara occidental’. al-­Hulal al-­Mawshiyya, pp. 17–18.\n\n1 2\n\n26 | the a lmora vi d a nd a l mo h a d e mpir e s Almoravid myth of origin, which will be reviewed in Chapter 4, further claimed that the Sanhaja were forced to flee from the Arabian peninsula to avoid persecution for their monotheistic inclinations, and were thus Muslims even before the revelation of Islam. It also addressed the very distinctive Sanhaja practice of male veiling which gained the Almoravids the alternative name of ‘The Veiled Ones’ (al-­mulaththamūn). One of our earliest sources, the geographical work of al-­Bakri dating to the mid-­eleventh century (c. 1068), simply describes how proudly Sanhaja men wore the veil (lithām) and how shameful they considered it if a man’s lower face was revealed, without giving the practice an Islamic justification.3 However, in later sources, the face veil became a commemoration of the Sanhaja escape from Yemen disguised as women and, therefore, another mark of their devotion to Islam. The development of the Almoravid movement among the Sanhaja tribes of the western pre-­Sahara is similarly shrouded in myth. In the absence of verifiable facts, we can only present the story as it appears in Arabic sources and endeavour to tease out the implications embedded within it and sometimes its discrepancies. The story generally begins with a pilgrimage to Mecca undertaken by Yahya b. Ibrahim, chief of the Guddala tribe, probably in the company of men regarded as religious experts by the Sanhaja, including an individual called Jawhar b. Sakkum. Although often dated to 1048–9, a date repeated in many medieval Arabic sources, current scholarship prefers an earlier date between 1035 and 1038 based on al-­Bakri’s statement that the movement was well underway by 1048–9 and the death of Abu ‘Imran al-­Fasi, whom the pilgrims purportedly met in Qayrawan, in 1038–9.4 This dating discrepancy of around a decade persists through the first forty years of the movement. The Islamic world that Yahya and his companions encountered with its burgeoning cities and rival Muslim sects was very different to his sparsely populated Saharan homeland. The dominant power in much of the Maghrib was the Isma‘ili Fatimid caliphate which ruled Ifriqiya and Egypt, but there were also numerous Kharijite principalities, and strong support for Malikism, one of the Sunni legal schools, in the cities of Ifriqiya. Scholars with different perspectives and views gathered in the great mosques of the cities, exchanging legal and theological views at a level completely unfamiliar to the Sanhaja ­pilgrims, who probably sought to acquire knowledge from these teachers based in the cities on their route, as pilgrims commonly did. As a result, Yahya came to feel that his fellow tribesmen were in desperate al-­Bakri, Description de l’Afrique, Arabic text, p. 170; French text, pp. 320–1. Bosch Vilá, Los Almorávides, pp. 49–50; Norris, ‘New evidence’, p. 259; Lagardère, Almoravides I, p. 45; Messier, Almoravids, p. 192; Ibn ‘Idhari, al-­Bayan, vol. 4, p. 7, n. 3.\n\n3 4\n\nt h e al m ora vi ds: stri vi ng i n the pa th o f go d | 27 need of education in their professed religion. On his return from Mecca he stopped in Qayrawan, the main city of Ifriqiya, and asked Abu ‘Imran al-­Fasi, a Maliki scholar that he encountered, if he could send someone to instruct the Guddala. According to an amusing but plausible anecdote, none of Abu ‘Imran’s students in Qayrawan were prepared to leave their city comforts to go off to the Sahara, so he gave Yahya b. Ibrahim a letter for Wajjaj or Waggag b. Zalwi who was the head of a religious settlement (ribā†) in the Sus valley below the High Atlas mountains, relatively close to Sanhaja lands.5 Waggag in his turn appointed one of his students, ‘Abd Allah b. Yasin of the Jazula or Gazula, a tribe often considered part of the Sanhaja confederation, to instruct the Guddala about Islamic ritual and law. One source, the Kitab al-­ Madarik written by Qadi ‘Iyad of Ceuta, makes no mention of either Yahya or Abu ‘Imran reporting instead that the jurist Jawhar b. Sakkum asked Waggag directly for someone to educate his fellows.6 This omission may reflect Qadi ‘Iyad’s particular interest in scholars or the later elaboration of a myth to connect the Almoravids with the hugely influential Abu ‘Imran and personalise their attachment to Malikism, just as the later myth of Ibn Tumart’s meeting with al-­Ghazali performed the same function for the Almohads. Ibn Yasin’s mission to the Guddala is another aspect of early Almoravid history that is riddled with contradictions and lacunae. He was a man of the desert himself, whose mother Tin Izamaren lived in Tamamanawt, a village al-­Bakri describes as located on the edge of the ‘Sahara of the city of Ghana’.7 As a young man, he made the arduous journey to study in Córdoba and returned to the Maghrib keen to ‘reform’ Islam and relieve the Sanhaja tribes of their subjugation by the Barghawata and Zanata, leading Lagardère to ask whether he was first and foremost a jurist or a political agitator.8 When he arrived among the Guddala as the guest of Yahya b. Ibrahim, Ibn Yasin received a warm welcome and set about forcing them to adhere to Maliki law in their ritual and social behaviour. He recruited a number of disciples and, according to al-­Bakri, founded a town called Aratnanna,9 which may have been a teaching centre similar to Waggag’s ribā† in the Sus from which he had come.10 However, the geographical location of Ibn Yasin’s ribā† or town al-­Bakri, Description de l’Afrique, Arabic text, pp. 164–5; French text, p. 312. Although this phrase is taken to mean the northern side of the desert (Bosch Vilá, Los Almorávides, p. 51), the reference to Ghana implies its southern side. 6 Norris, ‘New evidence’, pp. 255–6, 259–60. 7 al-­Bakri, Description de l’Afrique, Arabic text, p. 165; French text, p. 312. 8 Lagardère, Almoravides I, p. 47. 9 al-­Bakri Description de l’Afrique, Arabic text, p. 165; French text, p. 313. 10 Bosch Vilá distinguished between Ibn Yasin’s ribā† and Aratnanna, which he located opposite Awdaghust; Los Almorávides, p. 70. 5\n\n28 | the a lmora vi d a nd a l mo h a d e mpir e s is unknown and most of the locations adduced in later sources, such as the estuary of the Senegal river, near Nouakchott, or Arguin island, seem to be folkloric tropes rather than factual reports.11 At some point relations between Ibn Yasin and the Guddala soured. This may have been triggered by the harsh punishments he meted out for even rather minor religious infractions, or his sometimes idiosyncratic interpretations of Islamic law. Al-­Bakri reports that Jawhar b. Sakkum and two Guddala chiefs questioned his religious knowledge and interpretations, thereby inciting the Guddala to reject his religious leadership, pillage his home and chase him from their midst.12 However, the accounts also imply other reasons for the decline in Guddala support for Ibn Yasin related to changes in the leadership of the tribe triggered by the death of his patron, Yahya b. Ibrahim. Norris argues that while many Guddala notables wished for a patrilineal succession to keep the chieftainship within the Guddala, the affiliated Lamtuna tribe supported the succession of one of their chiefs, Yahya b. ‘Umar, whose mother Safiyya was from the Guddala and probably the sister of Yahya b. Ibrahim. Although the idea that the son of a deceased man’s sister should inherit might seem unusual, it was, in fact, a common matrilineal inheritance pattern among the Sanhaja and it seems to have won the day, with Ibn Yasin’s approval.13 Yahya b. ‘Umar emerged as chief and as Ibn Yasin’s patron and foremost aristocratic disciple, support which Ibn Yasin could not do without, despite his talents as a religious preacher. By the early 1050s, a triumvirate of Ibn Yasin, Yahya b. ‘Umar and his brother Abu Bakr b. ‘Umar had emerged and the movement was dominated by the Lamtuna rather than the Guddala. Moreover, the perspective had shifted from educating the Sanhaja tribes who accepted Ibn Yasin’s religious leadership to forcibly correcting the religious deficiencies of neighbouring tribes and communities by means of jihad. The first victims of Lamtuna assertiveness were other Sanhaja tribes – the now hostile Guddala, the Masufa and the Lamta. This was a Lamtuna bid for hegemony over the Sanhaja as a whole, understood and legitimised as a religious mission to impose ‘correct’ Maliki Islam on religious deviants and, although the Guddala continued to resist for many years, the Masufa and Lamta soon joined the Lamtuna, creating a large Sanhaja military federation, known as the Murabitun (Almoravids). The newly recruited devotees then turned against the non-­Muslim tribes of the Dar‘a valley south of the High Atlas in an expansive wave in which Sanhaja Norris, ‘al-­Murābi†īn’. al-­Bakri, Description de l’Afrique, Arabic text, pp. 165–6; French text, p. 313. For more detail on Ibn Yasin’s doctrine, see below, pp. 238–40. 13 Norris, ‘New evidence’, pp. 261–2. 11 12\n\nt h e al m ora vi ds: stri vi ng i n the pa th o f go d | 29 ‘a‚abiyya gained mass through their adherence to Maliki Islam and their desire to propagate it through jihad. When the Almoravid jihad entailed warfare against other Muslims rather than non-­Muslims, however, it was inspired not simply by notions of correct versus deviant interpretations of Islam or Sanhaja chauvinism, but also by the often deeply held conviction that Muslims should form one political and religious community obedient to one caliph. From this perspective, jihad was an important integrative mechanism and a process of religio-­political unification. Ibn ‘Idhari, who witnessed the last dark days of the Almohad empire and the fall of many Andalusi cities to the Christians, expresses this view very clearly when he presents Ibn Yasin’s mission as the unification of Muslims to follow Islam’s way or law (sharī‘at al-­Islām) under a single imam in place of the fissiparous partisan politics of both al-­Andalus and the Maghrib where each tribe or community had its own chief or leader (amīr) and only followed the rulings (ªukm) of its own tribe or sect.14 In contrast, the Almoravid amir was the commander of Truth (amīr al-­ªaqq), in the sense of true religion, a figure whose virtue lay in making the Muslim umma one.15 This use of religion to unite and focus a group of tribes, previously given to raiding and competing for resources amongst themselves, was one of the examples upon which Ibn Khaldun based his theory of the complementary roles of ‘a‚abiyya and religion in tribal state-­building. Those Sanhaja who joined the movement found a new identity as Almoravids that enabled them to harness their martial abilities and use them to expand their power rather than dissipating them in internal feuds. As Ibn ‘Idhari suggests, however, their appeal was also potentially wider than to the Sanhaja alone, and their rivals description of them as Lamtuna or Mulaththamun was a slur to diminish the religious component of their movement, encapsulated in the title al-­Murabitun/Almoravids. It is a point of speculation, however, when and why the Sanhaja affiliates of Ibn Yasin came to be known as Almoravids.16 Possibly, it had the sense of ‘Men of the ribā†’ of Ibn Yasin or his master Waggag. Conversely, it may have had a more spiritual or metaphorical meaning, in the sense of ‘men bound to God’ from the Arabic root r-­b-­† meaning ‘to tie’. Writing in the thirteenth century, Ibn ‘Idhari says that Ibn Yasin gave them the name to indicate their fortitude and devotion to their cause after they lost half their fighters in a battle around 1054 against non-­Muslim tribes in the Dar‘a valley.17 This may well be a later rationalisation of the term, but Ibn ‘Idhari, al-­Bayan, vol. 4, pp. 9–10. Ibid., vol. 4, p. 11. 16 Bosch Vilá, Los Almorávides, pp. 55–6; Lagardère, Almoravides I, pp. 58–60. 17 Ibn ‘Idhari, al-­Bayan, vol. 4, p. 11. 14 15\n\n30 | the a lmora vi d a nd a l mo h a d e mpir e s it is also an explanation that closely linked ribā† to jihad in the sense of a physical and spiritual girding of the loins for battle. This militancy was a key feature of the movement. It was not solely religious fervour or ‘a‚abiyya that underpinned the Lamtuna desire for Saharan dominance. Life in the Sahara desert was extremely hard and the competition for scant resources was fierce at all times, rising to critical levels if the population rose or drought struck, factors that may well have contributed to the rise of the Almoravids.18 Although something of an exaggeration, al-­Bakri describes the Sanhaja as living solely on strips of dried meat and milk in a land where few animals beyond wild gazelles and foxes could sustain themselves.19 In this harsh environment, survival depended on possession of as many water sources as possible and control of the routes taken by the trans-­Saharan caravans carrying salt, grain, gold and slaves, whose caravaneers paid good money to be led safely through the desert, and swapped their grain for pastoral products. As in many pre-­modern contexts, the combination of religious, political and economic motives driving the Sanhaja does not mean that the Almoravids were insincere. Like the early Muslims and their Almohad successors, they associated military victory and political power with divine favour and saw the material benefits they gained as a reward from God that proved they were on the right path. Truly profitable exploitation of the trans-­Saharan trade required possession of Sijilmasa and Awdaghust, the great northern and southern desert-­edge cities, dominated by the Zanata and the Soninke, respectively. It is therefore hardly coincidental that these were the first cities targeted by the Almoravids after they had consolidated their control over the desert itself. After moving into the Dar‘a valley to wage war against the non-­Muslim tribes they found there, the Almoravids advanced east towards Sijilmasa in 1054–5. According to al-­Bakri, they offered its Zanata Maghrawa lord, Mas‘ud b. Wanudin, and the city notables a deal, presumably the chance to submit and accept Maliki Sunnism in place of Kharijism, but they attacked the city after their approach was rejected.20 Later chronicles embellish the story by adding that disgruntled elements within the population called upon the Almoravids to help them against their ‘tyrannical’ Zanata Berber rulers.21 Framed in this way, the Almoravid attack constituted a jihad to restore justice and transform a city that was a hotbed of Kharijism, Fatimid Shi‘ism and lax morality into a bastion of Maliki orthodoxy, as well as an attempt to dislodge the Zanata.

Although the Almoravids took the city fairly easily, when the majority of their warriors returned to the desert to raid Awdaghust to the south and capture it from the pagan Soninke ruler of Ghana, the Maghrawa returned and slaughtered the small Almoravid garrison as they prayed or sought refuge in the great mosque.22 Ibn Yasin responded to this reverse by summoning the Almoravids for a second attack on the Maghrawa to regain Sijilmasa, but the Guddala refused and returned to their desert homelands bordering the Atlantic. This was an important moment for the Almoravids. Reading between the lines, there appears to have been tension between Ibn Yasin and those Sanhaja who saw their future beyond the desert and others, such as the Guddala, who did not wish to become embroiled in conflict with the powerful Zanata tribes or venture too far beyond their familiar desert lands. Yahya b. ‘Umar was obliged to campaign against the recalcitrant Guddala and died fighting them in either 1055 or 1056.23 The desertic south and the fertile lands to the north continued to pull the Almoravids in two ways for many years. It must also have become obvious after the Sijilmasa insurgency that while cities might be easy to conquer, they were not so simple to govern and hold, and that the cooperation of at least some of the urban elite was essential. This provided the rationale for the consistent Almoravid recruitment of Maliki jurists of urban background to complement the military capabilities of the Sanhaja as their empire expanded. After the death of Yahya b. ‘Umar and the reconquest of Sijilmasa, Ibn Yasin and Abu Bakr b. ‘Umar consolidated Almoravid control over the caravan route from Sijilmasa westwards through the Sus valley to Nul Lamta at the expense of the Zanata, some of whom were adherents of the mysterious Shi‘i Bajaliyya sect.24 Then they cast their eyes north towards the snow-­covered peaks of the High Atlas mountains and the rich trading town of Aghmat, another Zanata stronghold, beyond. Ibn Yasin had crossed the mountains on his journeys to and from Córdoba, and he took to the high passes once again to persuade the Masmuda tribes to make common cause with the Almoravids against the Zanata. Although they were familiar with the rigours of the desert, the mountains were unfamiliar and dangerous territory for the Almoravids and their animals, and they would have found the crossing al-­Bakri, Description de l’Afrique, Arabic text, p. 168; French text, p. 315. For more detail, see Bosch Vilá, Los Almorávides, pp. 73–4. 23 Bosch Vilá, Los Almorávides, p. 76. 24 Ibid., pp. 83–5; Lagardère, Almoravides I, p. 66. 22\n\n32 | the a lmora vi d a nd a l mo h a d e mpir e s almost impossible without Masmuda support. Indeed, they found mountain engagements perilous for the duration of their rule and lost control of the Atlas when the Masmuda turned against them in the early twelfth century. In 1058, however, the alliance held and the Almoravids crossed the High Atlas, possibly via the westernmost pass, the Tizi Mashu, which would have brought them down the Shishawa valley, after which they travelled east to Aghmat and laid siege to it.25 Like Sijilmasa, Aghmat was a prosperous commercial town embedded in the trade networks that stretched eastwards to Qayrawan and northwards across the Straits of Gibraltar to Córdoba, with sufficient economic and cultural weight to have attracted migrants from al-­ Andalus and Ifriqiya and a sizable coterie of Jewish traders. It was a double town made up of Aghmat-­Warika and Aghmat-­Ilan (Ar. Haylana), named after the Masmuda Berber tribes that inhabited each settlement, controlled by a Zanata Berber warlord, Laqqut b. Yusuf, who had connections with the Zanata Banu Ifran lords of Salé further north. The Almoravids took it after a short siege accompanied by negotiations with local notables, while Laqqut b. Yusuf escaped and sought refuge with the Zanata of the Tadla region only to be killed in battle with the Almoravids later.26 After they had expelled the Zanata from Aghmat, the Almoravids renewed their northward mission against the Barghawata tribes of the Atlantic littoral who had long been considered heretical due to their belief that Muhammad and the Qur’an were the prophet and the book of the Arabs while one of their own chiefs, Salih, was the prophet of the Berbers and had given them their own book. Ibn Yasin took the initiative as he had with the Masmuda of the High Atlas and travelled among the Barghawata tribes calling them to Malikism, but he was over-­confident: his advances were rejected and he was killed in 1059, an event much embellished in the Rawd al-­Qirtas.27 Sulayman b. ‘Addu, another pupil of Waggag, succeeded Ibn Yasin as religious leader of the movement, but he was less charismatic and he died soon after fighting the Barghawata as the Almoravids sought revenge for Ibn Yasin’s death. After that, effective leadership of the movement passed to the Lamtuna chief Abu Bakr b. ‘Umar and his cousin Yusuf b. Tashfin, who had already begun an offensive against the Zanata tribes north and east of Sijilmasa which steadily took the Almoravids towards the more northerly towns of Salé, Meknes, Fes and Tlemcen.

The first revolves around the enigmatic figure of Zaynab daughter of Ishaq al-­Hawwari or al-­Nafzawi who has the distinction of being one of the few women in Maghribi historical writing to enjoy a public profile. Her father was an Ifriqiyan merchant from Qayrawan who had migrated to Aghmat. Although chroniclers differ as to whether he was of Nafzawa (Ibn ‘Idhari and Ibn Khaldun) or Hawwara (Ibn Abi Zar‘) origin,28 both these Berber tribes subscribed to Kharijite Islam, primarily in its Ibadi form, confirming that Aghmat was a town heavily influenced by Kharijism like Sijilmasa south of the High Atlas.29 Zaynab herself is variously described as the wife of the Maghrawa chief Laqqut b. Yusuf and thus the ‘queen’ of Aghmat, or the concubine of a previous chief, Yusuf b. ‘Ali.30 More fancifully, she was said to have refused to marry anyone but the ruler of the Maghrib and was reputed to be a soothsayer or sorceress in contact with the jinn and the keeper of an immense secret treasure.31 After Laqqut was killed in the course of the Almoravid campaigns in the Tadla region, Zaynab was a widow of substance and around 1067–8 she became the wife of Abu Bakr, thereby putting her wealth and experience at the disposal of the new masters of the area. While not challenging the historicity of Zaynab, fantastical legends about her extraordinary beauty and her secret riches symbolise the wealth that the Atlantic plains offered the newcomers, while her marriage and cooperation with Abu Bakr indicate the Almoravids’ need for local interlocutors and collaborators, and the fact that their empire was not fou"
