The Nasrid Kingdom of Granada (1232–1492), the last remnant of al-Andalus in the Iberian Peninsula, has normally merited brief mentions as an active part of the Mediterranean scene at the end of the Middle Ages; it has also played the lead role in specific studies of some facet of its historical reality. For example, it has famously earned a place in general works on the art of Western Islam, which harbors some of its most brilliant manifestations. But it has rarely enjoyed a general treatment that encompassed a total, broad, and deep view of the Nasrid world as a historic society. Few scholars have ventured to situate it within the complex Islamic societies of the late-medieval Mediterranean and the varied phenomena of their evolution. And even fewer have offered a thorough appreciation of the multiform character of this society: suspended between two worlds, still steeped in the essence of medieval Islam but also fully launched on a journey to the Modern Age, open to interchange, and invaded by principles alien to its nature that initiated its evolution. The first monographs that adopted this approach were the fundamental works of Miguel Ángel Ladero Quesada (1969) and Rachel Arié (1973), together with collected volumes such as those edited by María Jesús Viguera Molíns (2000) and Rafael Peinado Santaella (2000). We hope that the present multifaceted examination of the Nasrid kingdom through its politics, society, economics, and culture will help readers to perceive it as a hybrid society that was extraordinarily dynamic: still strongly marked by its Islamic essence but well integrated into its own time and space, in full transition to the Early Modern Age, and deeply influenced by its interactions with the Latin Mediterranean world. Although it was the last Muslim territory in the Iberian Peninsula, it was by no means either isolated or wholly oriented toward the rest of the Islamic world – though of course that world provided it with significant support at every level. The Nasrid kingdom also maintained fundamental relationships with its neighbors in the Latin West, interactions that played out in the political, diplomatic, economic, and cultural spheres. The Nasrids’ special relationships with nearby Christian states may have accelerated certain transformations of their late Andalusi society toward more highly evolved forms. One of the most interesting features of the kingdom’s history is how it reveals certain dynamics or factors of change, the tensions and adaptations characteristic of a society in transition. That may be, in fact, the most important role that this small state played in the history of al-Andalus. It\n\n- 978-90-04-44359-4 Downloaded from Brill.com04/11/2021 09:51:24AM via Universidad de Granada\n\nx\n\nPreface\n\nwas not, as many interpretations would have it, a mere end-point or shadow of Andalusi society, an anomaly that represented the decadence of an entire age and culture. This impression needs to be corrected by emphasizing the role of this space in the context of the change and evolution being experienced by Western Islamic societies at the end of the Middle Ages. Such a society, in all its manifestations, underwent transitions of enormous complexity that we cannot apprehend without a rich and varied series of approaches. Research into the Nasrid world has managed to convert into a strength what seemed to be one of its great weaknesses: its paucity of written sources in comparison to other sociopolitical entities of the time, both Islamic and Christian. “Nasrid studies” has become an ample and multidisciplinary area of historiography in recent years, leading Hispanic medievalism in general, and studies of Andalusi Islam in particular, in theoretical and methodological innovation. This renewal of methodology has favored combined systems of analysis. Of course written documentation provides important information, as we see in the contributions of Francisco Vidal Castro on Arabic sources and Raúl González Arévalo on Christian ones. But it is increasingly joined by other modes of information, such as anthropological analysis: beginning with reflections on the Islamic nature of Andalusi society by Pierre Guichard, who offers us a splendid general Introduction here, it also underlies the contributions by Amalia Zomeño and Bilal Sarr on the composition of Nasrid society and its internal functioning. Finally there is archaeology, which has developed in recent years within Nasrid studies: in the present volume Alberto García Porras offers us an overview, while Antonio Malpica Cuello analyzes patterns of settlement within the territory and the evolution of the Alhambra as a populated space. Here we expand these diverse ways of approaching a bygone society through a series of studies that not only covers all the manifestations of the Nasrid world but also embodies the many ways in which they have been developed and encompassed through scholarship. In planning the makeup of this volume we have made choices that we must now clarify for the reader. We wish to offer a general frame of reference by placing the Nasrid kingdom in its political, institutional, and juridical contexts, explored respectively in the essays by Bárbara Boloix Gallardo, Antonio Peláez Rovira, and Amalia Zomeño. Roser Salicrú i Lluch illustrates the kingdom’s firm insertion into a dynamic international sphere, whose economic development is explored by Adela Fábregas; Daniel Baloup studies its ambivalent relationships with the convergent interests of other Mediterranean powers, and the territorial and ideological struggle that marked its relations with Castile. In fact this last relationship, based on a territorial conflict, would determine the kingdom’s end when Castile conquered it at the end of the Middle Ages. Nasrid society also had to be placed in its proper cultural context: María - 978-90-04-44359-4 Downloaded from Brill.com04/11/2021 09:51:24AM via Universidad de Granada\n\nPreface\n\nxi\n\nDolores Rodríguez Gómez describes its intellectual development, Expiración García Sánchez its achievements in science, Juan Carlos Ruiz Souza its brilliant art and architecture, and José Miguel Puerta Vílchez its splendid literature. We focus on the latest advances in research in which, in recent years, other fields of study have offered new paths and methodologies that have enriched Nasrid studies. Having established the general framework that situates the Nasrid kingdom within late-medieval Mediterranean societies, we then turn to research into its material dimension: Antonio Malpica explores the archaeology of landscape, Christine Mazzoli-Guintard the urban spaces that loom so large in Nasrid society, María Elena Díez Jorge its inhabitants’ daily lives, and Alberto García Porras its material culture. Of course, if we are to understand a transitional society like this one we must also look at the reverse of the medal: how it confronted the definitive, traumatic step of a new historical reality, brought about by a process of conquest and submission. As Rafael Peinado describes Castile’s imposition on the former Nasrids, it presupposed a fundamental transformation into a new society, evoked in all its complexity by Ángel Galán Sánchez. In a decisive epilogue, a new ideological identity arose through religious conversion: Gerard Wiegers describes all of the resistances and distortions that it produced. All these essays provide us with essential keys for understanding not only the fundamentals of the Nasrid world but also the roads it traveled toward its final dissolution. The preparation of this volume has required much time, labor, and enthusiasm from all the participants involved. Our first contacts with Brill and our editors there, Kathy van Vliet and Jorik Groen, took place in 2016. From the first moment, the opportunity to make a work on the Nasrid kingdom of Granada available to a broad public was enormously attractive, and has received the publisher’s help and support throughout. Our translator of the Spanish and French texts and editor of the English ones, Consuelo López-Morillas, performed the difficult work that resulted in this elegant English version. But the project could never have come to fruition without the wisdom, generosity, and patience of this large group of authors, who took up the challenge of presenting to interested readers the Nasrid kingdom in every manifestation of its corner of the medieval Islamic world, through reflections drawn from their own research. Our deepest gratitude and respect for their valuable work goes to them all. The efforts of so many have resulted in a magnificent volume that, we trust, will situate this small Islamic Mediterranean state in the place it deserves within medieval studies.

Although I visited Granada often during my academic career and in retirement, I have rarely studied, except superficially, the last Andalusi political entity, usually called “the Kingdom of Granada.” I have concentrated chiefly on earlier eras. My first book on al-Andalus1 argued for an early and profound “Orientalization” of Andalusi society, and while historians and Arabists credit it with some influence on the historiography of al-Andalus, and many contributors to this volume have generously cited it, it concerned the very first centuries of the territory’s Arabization and Islamization. My 1990–1991 dissertation on the Muslims of Valencia2 dealt with a later period, the eleventh to thirteenth centuries, most of which preceded the rise of the Nasrid kingdom; and in any case it focused on the eastern Peninsula, Sharq al-Andalus, not Andalusia. Nonetheless, some scholars have interpreted my writings about these earlier eras and a different geographical region by applying to Granada in the late Middle Ages notions that I had not intended for that time and place. For example, as early as December 1976 María Jesús Rubiera Mata presented a paper to the Primer Congreso de Historia de Andalucía (published in the conference proceedings in 1978)3 that argued that certain marriages of the Nasrid dynasty contradicted the opposition I had established between the “Western” tradition of exogamy and the endogamic system of traditional Arab marriages in al-Andalus. In the 1970s and 1980s I often debated with Drs. Rubiera Mata and Mikel de Epalza the question of the “Berberization” of Sharq al-Andalus, and in preparing the present essay I “discovered,” or rather “rediscovered,” her paper, which I had forgotten. While I have no particular wish to revisit old polemics, this text leads me to clarify, in relation to the Nasrids, my often-cited position about the “Orientalization” of Andalusi society. In my 1976 book I sought to analyze the early centuries of Arabization and Islamization in the Peninsula in the light 1 Guichard, Structures sociales. 2 Guichard, Les musulmans de Valence. 3 Rubiera Mata, “El vínculo cognático en al-Andalus.”\n\n© Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, 2021 | doi:10.1163/9789004443594_002\n\n- 978-90-04-44359-4 Downloaded from Brill.com04/11/2021 09:51:24AM via Universidad de Granada\n\n2\n\nGuichard\n\nof what we know about the historical anthropology of Arab-Muslim societies. I believed that the force of the tribal system that the conquerors brought to Hispania marked al-Andalus far more strongly than “traditionalist” scholars had admitted: they argued for a superficial Arab-Islamic “coloration” laid over a society that preserved its “Western” features inherited from the Romans and Visigoths. In my view the Arabs, in accordance with their strongly patrilineal kinship structure – and in contrast to the Roman and Barbarian tendency toward exogamy, encouraged by the Western Church – had introduced into the Peninsula endogamous “Arab marriage” with one’s paternal first cousin (bint al-ʿamm). Its effect was to consolidate patrilineal groups of relatives, the basis for tribal organization. 1\n\nWas the Nasrid Dynasty Cognatic or Endogamous?\n\nRubiera Mata’s paper, in contrast, stressed the “cognatic” character of many marriages of Nasrid princesses. She proposed, first of all, that one factor in the Nasrids’ rise to power was the series of strong alliances they forged with other powerful families such as the Banū l-Mawl and the Banū Ashqilūla by marrying Nasrid women to their members. Then she examined marriages arranged within the Nasrid family itself to show that the union of a Nasrid man with the daughter of a sovereign had an “ennobling” effect on the bridegroom that favored his eventual accession to power. All this proved, in her opinion, that Nasrid princesses (banāt Naṣr) could transmit nobility and legitimacy, and she concluded: The kinship structure of Granadan families was therefore bilateral, formed by a relationship of agnates and cognates who were mutually supportive. In Pierre Guichard’s study this type of structure is considered “Western” in contrast to the unilateral and agnatic “Eastern” type. [Guichard] holds that although the two structures coexisted during the early centuries of Islam, the “Eastern” one eventually prevailed…. In these pages we have reached the opposite conclusion from M. Guichard: it was the “Western” model that succeeded. Once again, we believe that the old Hispanic traditions survived, tinged with Arabic ones: [in this case,] certain marriages with one’s bint al-ʿamm (paternal cousin).4 4 “La estructura de parentesco en los linajes granadinos se nos presenta, pues, como bila­ teral, formado por una parentela de agnados y cognados, solidarios entre sí.

I am tempted to contrast her interpretation with that of the Nasrids’ contemporary Ibn Khaldūn; in his Muqaddimah, while acknowledging the evident “detribalization” of al-Andalus, he wrote: Ibn al-Ahmar … seized power with the help of a group of relatives [ʿisāba qarība min qarābatihi] who were called “the chiefs [al-ruʾasāʾ].” He needed no more people than these, because there were so few groups in Spain (at that time) possessing a government and subjects…. One should not think that he was without group support [ʿisāba]. This was not so. He started out with a group [ʿisāba], but it was a small one. However, it was sufficient for his needs, because there were few groups [ʿasāʾib] and tribes [qabāʾil] in (Spain) and, consequently, not much group feeling [ʿasabiyya] was needed there, in order to gain the upper hand over the Spaniards.5 Bearing this in mind, we can view in a different light the accession of Ismāʿīl I in 1314, which Rubiera interprets as the first “cognatic” succession in the Nasrid line because Fātima, mother of this fifth sultan, was the daughter of Muḥammad II (1272–1302). María Jesús Viguera, in her section on Nasrid political history in Menéndez Pidal’s Historia de España,6 is correct in modifying the exclusively “cognatic” interpretation of such unions: she shows how the great Granadan writer Ibn al-Khatīb, in his Lamḥa al-Badriyya devoted to the dynasty, evokes Ismāʿīl’s youth: “He grew up concerned with all things proper to his station, enjoying his father’s favor and especially the preference of his grandfather the sultan, who was his mother’s father and his father’s cousin.” Ismāʿīl and his father belonged fully to the Nasrid paternal line, and it is within that line that the problems of succession arose. When political crises led to the removal of Muḥammad III and then of his brother Nasr – neither of whom left an heir – power passed to the other branch of the Nasrids, that of the “chiefs” descended from the brother of Muḥammad I, ra‌ʾīs Ismāʿīl, governor of Málaga. ‘oriental’ unilateral agnático.

Modern historians accept categories such as endogamy and exogamy established by anthropology; those same realities were not unknown to Arab authors, but they viewed them through the lens of their own culture and different family structures. Manuela Marín notes that marriages that united two families of jurists were frequent, creating unions that do not seem to have affected the patrilineal definition.7 As for Ibn Khaldūn, he views events from his own perspective and identifies himself with a similar family of Andalusi origin; in his autobiography he can trace its history readily from his distant Andalusi ancestors (something a Western aristocrat of the time would have been hard pressed to do). He can therefore establish a difference between the Muslim sovereigns’ system of succession and that of the Franks and Spanish Christians from the North: “a foreign custom … that gives the throne to descendants of women.”8 This evident exaggeration deserves fuller commentary, but probably comes from his direct experience with the Christian political milieu gained through his contacts with the court of Peter the Cruel of Castile. In Arab-Muslim society, then, there were multiple options in the realm of marriage: an almost total absence of forbidden unions, a traditional preference for marriage to one’s bint al-ʿamm, but also many circumstances that might make one kind of matrimonial alliance preferable to another in a given situation. Manuela Marín’s study of women in al-Andalus devotes many pages to matrimonial strategies and the links between power and relationships forged through women. She notes the frequency of “endogamous” unions among the Nasrids (p. 541) but also comments on the long and fascinating passage in the memoirs of ʿAbd Allah, Zirid ruler of Granada, about the marriage of his sister. No other text tells us in such rich and personal detail the range of options for such a union, whose political implications might be important: marriage to a sovereign’s daughter was not without consequences. At first ʿAbd Allah assumed she should marry a first cousin with whom he enjoyed good relations, but his counselors dissuaded him, fearing that such a marriage might give too much influence to that chosen member of the royal family. They then discussed a second possibility, marriage to an unrelated noble who would therefore be beholden to the ruler. A few amusing lines describe precisely the candidate finally chosen: he had to be so wholly non-threatening that we are left with the impression of his total insignificance – though he also seems insufferably 7 Marín, Mujeres en al-Andalus, chap. 8. 8 Ibn Khaldūn, Histoire des Banou l-Ahmar, 35.\n\n- 978-90-04-44359-4 Downloaded from Brill.com04/11/2021 09:51:24AM via Universidad de Granada\n\nThe Nasrid Kingdom in the History of al-Andalus\n\n5\n\npretentious. The emir also speculated about possible marriages with princes of other taifa kingdoms, or even with the Almoravid emir Yūsuf ibn Tashfīn (pp. 249–254). We are drawn to this text by Emir ʿAbd Allah not only because it concerns a Granadan dynasty but because it recalls a situation somewhat similar to that of the Nasrids. The possibilities that the Zirid was weighing are similar to those the Nasrid sovereigns would face a century and a half later, in a much more “detribalized” context. Arab tradition, perhaps revived in the context of a claim of Arab genealogy, called in principle for marriage with a paternal cousin, and many Nasrid marriages were in fact of this type, but the political situation could lead to speculation about other choices. It may be of interest (and could be interpreted in a framework of “Arab endogamy”) that there is scarcely any mention of a Nasrid marriage with the ruling Berber families of the Maghreb, although the two dynasties were in constant contact.9 As a political strategy this is very different from that of Christian ruling houses. On the other hand, “political” marriages were formed to strengthen a more powerful family by an association with an allied one, such as the Banū Ashqilūla10 and especially, later, the Banū l-Mawl. Clearly, giving a daughter of the dynasty to a family whose support is sought is honorable and profitable for the latter, since it creates an in-law relationship (ṣihr). There is no doubt that the early Nasrids applied this strategy deliberately. Bājjī was promised such a union in return for Seville’s support11 in the revolt of the Banū Ashqilūla in 1266, perhaps as part of an identical offer that came to nothing: the anticipated marriages eventually benefited the Banū l-Mawl.12 In the end a close relationship was established with the Banū l-Mawl, a family that, like the Nasrids, claimed ancient Arab ancestry: they shared in power as viziers, and were also joined in marriage to women of the Nasrid line.13 While not fully integrated into the reigning dynasty, the Banū l-Mawl became virtually a collateral branch of the Nasrids, so that the term “exogamy” scarcely applies – these were marriages made inside the ruling group. It is not wholly inappropriate to speak of “cognatism,” but only a very few unions deserve that label. In Ibn Khaldūn’s opinion Muḥammad I, founder of the Nasrids, lacking support by a tribe – since that structure no longer existed in al-Andalus at the time – nonetheless benefited from his alliance with the ruling group “formed 9 10 11 12 13\n\nSee, however, Arié, L’Espagne musulmane, 91.

He brought to power a family group within which there were marriages – perhaps technically “cognatic” but often endogamous from the viewpoint of the group itself – that supplied strong internal cohesion; thus he maintained his dynasty at the pinnacle of what remained of al-Andalus for its last two and a half centuries. The cohesion within this group began with the marriage of Fātima, daughter of Muḥammad II, to her paternal cousin Faraj Abū Saʿīd, father of the future Ismāʿīl I. Later several similar marriages were arranged, such as that of Yūsuf I’s daughter to his nephew Muḥammad Abū Saʿīd, the future Muḥammad VI; and toward the end of the dynasty Fatima al-Hurra married her cousin Aḥmad, son of Yūsuf II and father of Yūsuf V. It has been shown recently that Umm al-Fath, daughter of Muḥammad IX, was both the paternal cousin and the wife of the future Muḥammad VI. The same logic seems to apply to unions between women of the central Nasrid family and allied lines, chiefly the Banū l-Mawl, who therefore became a sort of collateral branch of the dynasty: not only did they supply the rulers with viziers, but one of them ascended to power with the name Yūsuf IV. Ibn al-Khatīb records that the head of the Banū l-Mawl of Cordova “joined the family through his marriage to the daughter of the ra‌ʾīs Abū Jaʿfar, known as ‘al-Fachallib,’ a paternal cousin of the sultan, thus making the power of the house even stronger. The relationship was later reaffirmed through the union of a Mawl, a brother of that vizier, with a daughter of the ra‌ʾīs Abū l-Walīd who was sister to the ra‌ʾīs Abū Saʿīd, a son of these noble kings.”15 Modern historians include him in the dynasty’s family tree, and his accession to the throne did not constitute a break;16 he was buried in the Nasrids’ royal cemetery, the Rawda, in the Alhambra. For Ibn Khaldūn the Nasrids, in a land that lacked the tribes that he thought essential for establishing a dynasty, thereby came to form a mutually supportive “clan”: a durable, coherent group that managed to preserve its power efficiently in spite of the many dissensions and vicissitudes that marked its history. The two great fourteenth-century authors we have quoted, both of whom were related to the Nasrids, held that the family was an “Arab” dynasty; its matrimonial traditions did not contradict 14 Ibn Khaldūn, Histoire des Banou l-Ahmar, 25. 15 Ibn al-Jatib [sic], Historia de los reyes de la Alhambra, 170. 16 Fierro, “Ways of Connecting with the Past.”\n\n- 978-90-04-44359-4 Downloaded from Brill.com04/11/2021 09:51:24AM via Universidad de Granada\n\nThe Nasrid Kingdom in the History of al-Andalus\n\n7\n\ntheir interpretation of sociopolitical realities, but reflected the state and needs of Andalusi society. 2\n\nThe “Kingdom of Granada”: A Political Entity with Relatively Stable and Defined Borders, unlike Its Contemporary States in the Maghreb\n\nAntonio Malpica ends his essay “Organization of Settlement and Territorial Structures in the Nasrid Kingdom of Granada” by observing that the territorial outline of the Nasrid kingdom changed somewhat but maintained its own character, and did not come apart in the face of constant challenges. In spite of the dynasty’s internal tensions the decisive threat came from the outside, in the long, harsh feudal conquest of the second half of the fifteenth century. The emirate’s political geography did undergo certain changes, for example the Merinids’ temporary stranglehold on Algeciras and Ronda and the contrary phenomenon, the Nasrids’ brief possession of Ceuta. More insidious was the continual erosion from Castile’s pressure on the kingdom’s land borders. Baza had been exempt from conquest since the king had ceded it to the archbishop of Toledo in 1231; it was later briefly occupied by the Castilians but returned to Muslim rule in 1324, after the Nasrids won the battle of Sierra Elvira (“the disaster of La Vega”) in 1319. Antequera was lost for good in 1410, well before the dramatic retreats foreshadowed by the loss of Archidona in 1462. Other frontier towns such as Huéscar and Vélez-Rubio were difficult to defend and subject to Castilian or Aragonese occupation. While each sector of the terrestrial frontier should be studied in detail, over the long term it enjoyed a certain stability. For the greater part of the Nasrid era it is fairly easily mapped,17 while it is much harder to do the same for the three contemporary Maghrebi states, which had no true “frontiers.” That term itself, common in toponyms of Christian towns along the border (e.g., Arcos de la Frontera), is transcribed as Furuntaīra or Farantira in Ibn Khaldūn in apparent acknowledgement of its reality from the Arab-Muslim side. (We do not know if it was commonly used by Andalusis, whose normal term was thaghr.)18 It seems that in spite of the dynasty’s many vicissitudes it still identified itself with the territory. On several occasions sovereigns who were deposed but not executed, or who were briefly replaced in the Alhambra by a rival, withdrew to Guadix or were kept under surveillance in the royal fortress at Salobreña; 17 18\n\nSee, e.g., Bazzana et al., “La frontière,” 54.

Everyone, including the Christian powers, recognized its coherence as the historic seat of the Nasrid dynasty. Thus Muḥammad III, forced to abdicate in 1309 in favor of his brother Nasr, retired to Almuñécar but returned to the capital the following year after Nasr fell ill; once his brother was cured he took up residence in Almuñécar once more, dying there in 1314. Nasr himself was dethroned in 1313 by his paternal cousin Abū l-Walīd Ismāʿīl (Ismāʿīl I, whose mother was Nasr’s sister); he withdrew to Guadix and maintained a “sultan’s” court there, conspiring with James II of Aragon. After his death in 1322 the town was incorporated fully into the Nasrid state, and his body was eventually taken to Granada and buried with honors in the royal cemetery on the Sabika hill, at the foot of the Alhambra complex. In 1359 Muḥammad V, deposed by his brother, went to Guadix and received an oath of fealty from its inhabitants before proceeding to Morocco, where he bided his time before recovering the sultanate. On the death of Muḥammad VII in 1408, his brother Yūsuf III was recalled from captivity in Salobreña to succeed him. In 1464 Abū l-Ḥasan ʿAlī (he had married the widow of Muḥammad XI, who reigned in 1451–1452) dethroned his father Saʿd and sent him captive to Salobreña. After Saʿd’s death his body was conveyed to Granada and buried in the royal pantheon, though without any special ceremony.19 In 1482, during the chaotic last years of the dynasty, Sultan Abū l-Ḥasan ʿAlī’s two sons, Abū ʿAbd Allah Muḥammad (better known later as “Boabdil”) and Yūsuf, encouraged by their mother, a daughter of Muḥammad IX, broke with their father and left the Alhambra for Guadix, where their sovereignty was recognized. It was from Guadix that Boabdil, freed and supported by King Ferdinand, would try to reconquer Granada in 1483. Finally, in 1485 Muhammal al-Zaghal would depose his brother Abū l-Ḥasan ʿAlī and force him into residence at Almuñécar.20 On the basis of these events – only a few of the dynasty’s moments during the turbulent, packed, and complex history of the “kingdom of Granada” – it would be difficult to hazard any theory about a relationship between the royal line and the territory. Nonetheless, references to specific towns suggest that these episodes occurred against the background of a well-delineated and unified state. Different individuals who sprang from a single dynasty, which lacked any clear principle of succession, fought bitterly and violently to control that state, but its coherence was never seriously in doubt. This situation may have 19 Arié, L’Espagne musulmane, 145. 20 Arié, L’Espagne musulmane, 165.\n\n- 978-90-04-44359-4 Downloaded from Brill.com04/11/2021 09:51:24AM via Universidad de Granada\n\nThe Nasrid Kingdom in the History of al-Andalus\n\n9\n\ncreated a kind of de facto fief or domain (like the apanages associated with the French monarchy): for instance, Nasr’s base in Guadix between 1314 and 1322, after he was deposed by his cousin Ismāʿīl I. But it cannot be considered a taifa of the sort that important towns like Almería or Málaga had controlled for long periods in the past. The ever-more-frequent civil wars that, with continual Christian intervention, weakened the Nasrid state in the late fifteenth century were fought for control over the whole kingdom of Granada. There are many issues associated with the frontier and the complex relations established, in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, between Peninsular states and Maghrebi entities of similar strength; we see this clearly in Daniel Baloup’s contribution, which delves into practices of war and negotiation. The situation must have become more acute after the Castilians conquered Algeciras and the Portuguese took Ceuta in 1415, straining the fragile relationships that southern al-Andalus and the Maghreb had maintained for centuries. In this context, the kingdom of Granada may show a closer resemblance to its Christian neighbors than what obtained between Christian and Muslim Peninsular states in earlier eras (except, up to a point, in the taifa period). Granada, like the Christian kingdoms, existed within a fairly well-defined territory (although the Christians were advancing toward the south), and possessed a durable dynasty; it might even have evolved into a “national” state of the European type. The three Maghrebi states to the south, which were in constant contact with their northern neighbors, were also ruled by relatively stable dynasties in the late Middle Ages, but their territorial base was much less certain. The reason was, in part, that the Hafsids and Merinids still harbored imperial (caliphal) aspirations that the Nasrids had abandoned, and in part because their “human ecology” was different: their tribal structure was difficult to incorporate into a state. On several occasions the equilibrium they had struggled to achieve was called into question: for instance, the Merinids of Fez did not always accept the existence of their neighbors and cousins the Abdelwadids of Tlemcen, while they also tried to invade Hafsid territory. The Hafsids of Tunis underwent unexpected changes as well. The area between the two states, dominated by Tlemcen, was the arena for constant clashes that imperilled its political status; it was dominated by tribes, not only of Arabs (in spite of the large number of Hilalis who had invaded in the eleventh and twelfth centuries). The Granadan dynasty, free from this tribal problem, did not experience the same volatility. As Daniel Baloup correctly asserts, the Granadan frontier, in spite of its potential for violence, almost paradoxically gave the Nasrid kingdom considerable geographical stability. The dynasty’s alliances with Christians in the Iberian Peninsula and Muslims in the Maghreb helped to ensure its survival, at least up to the unification of Castile and Aragon.\n\n- 978-90-04-44359-4 Downloaded from Brill.com04/11/2021 09:51:24AM via Universidad de Granada\n\n10\n\nGuichard\n\nIbn al-Khatīb, a contemporary witness, offers a tantalizing panorama of this period in his al-Lamḥa al-badriyya, written from the viewpoint of the ruling family. The text evokes vividly the war of jihād along the frontier with the Christians, for which he gives credit to the Nasrids. Among the more interesting anecdotes was one that impressed the people of Granada: under Muḥammad III (1302–1308) the Nasrids took the town of al-Manzar (probably modern Bedmar) and captured its inhabitants, “among whom was the renegade woman [ʿilja] who ruled the city, an illustrious Christian. She was brought before the court in a group of prisoners; she rode a finely caparisoned horse, was richly dressed, and was very beautiful. The king of the Maghreb claimed her for himself.”21 Here we see how Nasrids may have perceived social customs different from their own: in this case, women who enjoyed a visible public presence. The appropriation of this Christian woman by the Merinid ruler, an essential ally of the Nasrids, reminds us of how al-Mansūr, toward the end of the Umayyad caliphate, contracted marriages with princesses from Christian kingdoms of northern Spain, having forced their sovereigns to yield their daughters to him; these unions redounded to the prestige of his Amirid line.22 3\n\nA Thriving City, a Great Capital, a Magnificent Palace Complex: Dependent on the Sunni Revival of the Late Middle Ages?\n\nChristine Mazzoli is probably right in claiming that the meager “visibility” of such an important capital as Granada in general urban histories of the Middle Ages owes much to rigid disciplinary boundaries and concentration on other issues, although this great city ruled an area more intensely urbanized than any other in Europe at the time. But we wonder whether from a general historical point of view the same outlook affects important centers like Almería, and above all Málaga, in relation to Granada. She has contributed to Prosopografía de los ulemas de al-Andalus23 99 known ulemas (ʿulamāʾ, religious scholars) in Málaga against 139 for the city of Granada, and scholars may have assigned too readily to the capital figures who actually lived in the port city, which teemed with travelers and merchandise.

Its entries can be added to the 11,000 in the Prosopografía and should allow statistical comparisons that locate these authors and suggest the relative importance of a given city at a particular time. This information can make our rather abstract view, based so far on a simple count of how often an individual person or place is mentioned, more concrete. We choose as an example the town of Vélez-Málaga, a fairly unimportant center whose existence one might attribute to its mere proximity to the regional capital. Yet a reading of the lives of intellectuals who were born in Vélez or passed through it disproves that notion. Al-Bunnāhī is known for having persecuted Ibn al-Khatīb and persuaded the Merinids to execute him; born in Málaga, he served as a judge (qāḍī) in Vélez at one point in his career. Later he preached at the great mosque in his home city, was a government secretary in Granada, and became a judge in the capital during Muḥammad V’s second reign, dying there at the end of the fourteenth century.25 Others who were born in Vélez studied in Málaga or elsewhere but returned home to spend most of their lives. Abū Jaʿfar Aḥmad b. al-Zayyāt, a mystical poet who died in 1328, taught in Vélez, and his son became a judge there; Abū ʿAbd Allāh Muḥammad al-Badawī, both jurisconsult ( faqīh) and poet, also taught in the town, preached in one of its neighborhood mosques, and died in 1350. These two examples show that a resident of Vélez with a merely local position could still gain enough renown to be mentioned favorably by Ibn al-Khatīb and other authors of his time.26 Our biographical information about these intellectuals reveals intense exchanges with both Málaga and the capital. Ibn al-Khatīb says of Abū Jaʿfar Aḥmad b. al-Zayyāt, who seems to have been firmly established in Vélez, that throughout his life “he visited Granada so often that one cannot count the trips he made there for different reasons, including his passion for knowledge and its transmission, the ordinary necessities of life, a summons from the sultan, or the opportunity to head a delegation.”27 As for Abū ʿAbd Allāh Muḥammad al-Badawī, his contemporary Ibn al-Khatīb speaks of meeting him often at the palace, where al-Badawī went to settle matters of religious or civil administration in his home town of Vélez.28\n\n24 25 26 27 28\n\nLirola Delgado and Puerta Vílchez, Biblioteca de al-Andalus (hereafter BAA).

Ibn al-Murabiʾ of Vélez, for example, whose biography Ibn al-Khatīb narrates at length in his Ihāta, died in 1350; he had dedicated a maqāma to the Nasrid prince Abū Saʿīd Faraj b. Nasr, nephew of Muḥammad I and governor of Málaga (d. 1302).29 But such men also maintained strong ties to the capital, Granada, in a milieu that was socially diverse but culturally very coherent. There were jurisconsults ( fuqahāʾ) of varied origin who, while closely associated with Vélez, participated in the culture of their time. We offer two examples. Abū l-Ḥasan ʿAlī b. Aḥmad al-Madhhijī al-Multamāsī, as his names of origin (nisbas) indicate, claimed to descend from the tribe of Madhhij and was born at the fortress (ḥisn) of Munt Mās, now Bentomiz. His father was governor of the fortress, whose district must have included the nearby town of Vélez-Málaga. He was a pupil of the aforementioned Abū Jaʿfar Aḥmad b. al-Zayyāt and served as a qadi in Vélez for a long time; according to Ibn al-Khatīb he held the same post briefly in Málaga but preferred to return to Vélez, where he died in 1345-46.30 The second figure, of more humble origin, was Abū ʿAbd Allāh Muḥammad al-Badawī, also mentioned above. F.N. Velázquez Basanta, who wrote his entry for the Biblioteca de al-Andalus, explains convincingly, based on al-Badawī’s nisba and short genealogy, why his family must have been rural, and perhaps recently converted Mozarabic Christians.31 Unfortunately, only rarely can we penetrate further and breathe some life into the circumstances of these intellectuals, whose network we glimpse through their biographies. By chance we have a fatwa from Vélez (though anonymous and undated)32 that affords a glimpse of daily life in the town. It relates how peasants from a nearby hamlet called al-Tāliʿa “brought salt, alfalfa and other products to Vélez and camped on the square in front of the great mosque. They traded what they had brought for fruit, and spread out their figs in the mosque’s courtyard to dry them and make them into packets, eating and conversing while the people were praying in the mosque.” The fatwa expressed the opinion that they should be expelled. Religious authorities were called on to judge many other cases, and while decisions were made on a local basis they help us to visualize the ordinary life of the small or medium-sized towns in the kingdom’s urban network. The jurist al-Mawwāq, who died in the very year that Granada was conquered, issued a fatwa about Vélez that evokes a rural hamlet (qarya) not far from the coast; it 29 30 31 32\n\nBAA 4:264.

The inhabitants, who had probably taken refuge elsewhere (perhaps in Vélez itself), asked the jurist if they could turn the revenues attached to the mosque, previously used for its maintenance, to other purposes: specifically, to build an observation point atop the minaret to survey the movements of the Christians and serve as a guide for sailors.34 Al-Mawwāq approved the plan. We see here not only the reallocation of revenues from a mosque but a chance to restore the abandoned village in question, Multamās (an alternative form of Munt Mās). If we collate these various documents we can imagine a small rural district that contained, beside the ḥisn and qarya of Munt Mās/Bentomiz, the principal town (Vélez) and other hamlets such as al-Tāliʿa, whose residents went to Vélez to buy figs. We rarely find such information about a small rural area – fatwas are usually not so specific in their geography – but this case shows us the remarkable cultural and religious links that connected tiny rural hamlets, a small town like Vélez, the provincial capital at Málaga, and the seat of the Nasrid state. These connections were made possible by the thick web of men of letters and men of religion that is revealed in biographies of intellectual figures and in fatwas issued by jurists – though the latter were often imprecise for the study of toponymy and anthroponymy. The city of Granada was the unquestionable head of this “urban order,” as Christine Mazzoli calls it, that forms the background of the biographies of so many individuals. But the immense prestige of the palatine city that dominated it – the celebrated and admired Alhambra – tended to eclipse the capital itself, the “bourgeois” city as James Dickie called it, whose visible remains are far less impressive.35 The few traces still standing include the Corral del Carbón, the Cuarto Real de Santo Domingo, and the Bañuelo, while recent archaeological excavations in the former madrasa are recovering important elements in the history of the Nasrid metropolis.36 But the Alhambra itself, while it benefits from the greatest attention, is also subject to a certain distortion. Antonio Malpica, in his article on the palatine city in this volume, warns against the temptation of turning it into a contemporary space ruled exclusively by museal and patrimonial considerations, omitting many other essential features of its past. For example, research in recent years has shown that the Alhambra was not simply a group of administrative buildings (of which the Mexuar still 33 34 35 36\n\nLagardère, Histoire et société, 288, no. 273.

We have yet to establish the dynamics of its construction and the coherence of the ensemble. Nor can we forget the Generalife: in part through the demands of tourism we tend to see it as a building rather than as a vast garden of leisure, built on a system of irrigated plots that is still not fully reconstituted and understood. One can only hope that Malpica’s appeal for a scientific and societal debate about Spain’s heritage, focused on the nation’s most-visited monument, will be heard. The Alhambra should illuminate a moment in the history of alAndalus and of Muslim civilization in general, rather than standing as a mere aesthetic and monumental icon of the Nasrid world. Juan Carlos Ruiz Souza’s contribution responds to this concern, proposing to integrate Nasrid art into the general context of Islamic art. In an example of the “debate” that Antonio Malpica hopes for, he makes suggestive references to Yasser Tabbaa’s work on the return to the unity and orthodoxy of the Sunni world in the Mediterranean after the fall of the Fatimid caliphate of Egypt in 1171, and to the work of Nasser Rabbat on Mamluk architecture. In Western Islam we should also consider the collapse of the Almohads’ ambitious ideological and political program in the early fourteenth century, which paved the way for a Sunni (and strongly Malikite) “reaction” among the Merinids and Nasrids. The Hafsids sought to continue the Muʾminid regime, but in a sort of minor key that did not affect the population’s Sunni orthodoxy or the strong unity of Malikite areas of the Maghreb (in the broadest sense of the term). We should also realize that the Nasrid palace complex is exceptional as practically the only late-medieval example of its kind to have survived. In Muslim civilization religious buildings (like the mosque in Cordova) were generally preserved, but civil or political ones received little respect, in contrast to their preservation in the Latin world. A new dynasty or a new sovereign would often abandon or even destroy the seat of the previous ruler. Even among the Nasrids the greatest sovereigns built their own palaces (Yūsuf I erected Comares, his son Muḥammad V the Palace of the Lions), but fortunately they kept the earlier ones. Paradoxically, it was probably the Alhambra’s appropriation by a Christian monarchy that allowed it to survive; that is why such impressive structures as the palaces’ muqarnas domes have been preserved and exhibited, not only for admiration by tourists but for analysis by historians of art. I find especially promising Juan Carlos Ruiz Souza’s use of proposals by authors such Tabbaa37 and Rabbat:38 he situates the Nasrid edifices in the Alhambra within an artistic movement linked to the restoration of Sunnism in 37 Tabbaa, The Transformation of Islamic Art. 38 Rabbat, Mamluk History through Architecture. - 978-90-04-44359-4 Downloaded from Brill.com04/11/2021 09:51:24AM via Universidad de Granada\n\nThe Nasrid Kingdom in the History of al-Andalus\n\n15\n\nthe Mediterranean basin in the late Middle Ages. One of the key constructions of the period was the great iwan that the Mamluk sultan al-Nāsir (1311–1341) built in Cairo, now no longer standing: “without doubt one of the most emblematic buildings of its time in the Mediterranean.” The Comares Tower, with its “solid, square shape” projecting from the north wall of the Alhambra, would represent “the most impressive echo of the great iwan of Cairo.” The muqarnas (superimposed prisms combined in geometric fashion) in the cupolas – like the particularly fine ones in the Dos Hermanas hall, the most important political space in the Palace of the Lions and the entire complex – would serve as the architectural expression of Ashʿarite atomist theories, which were acceptable to Sunni orthodoxy. These held that Creation depends unceasingly on the divine will, which constructs the world out of primary units, the atoms (represented by the muqarnas), requiring the constant intervention of the divine will in this composition; they reject the Aristotelian notion of a natural order of the world. Latin Christians, on the other hand, embraced the idea of such an order, inherited from Aristotle and transmitted by Averroes in the thirteenth century: while the natural order was created by God it obeyed palpable, observable laws that could be studied by science. Al-Andalus in the late Almohad and Nasrid eras, however, retreated from such Averroist theories into a blind embrace of orthodox Ashʿarism. Without going too deeply into this philosophical digression we can only observe that the great adversaries of Ibn Rushd (Averroes) were Abū l-Husayn ʿAbd al-Rahmān b. Rabīʿ al-Ashʿarī, qadi of Écija (d. 1189-90), and his son Abū ʿĀmir Yaḥyā, qadi of Cordova (d. in Málaga 1242). The Banū Rabīʿ family, defenders of Ashʿarism, enjoyed great influence early in the Nasrid regime: Abū ʿĀmir Yaḥyā seems later to have been the first qadi of Granada under that dynasty, and was followed in the post by his son Abū l-Qāsim ʿAbd al-Rahmān, who would have died around 1300. Most intellectuals in Granada adhered to official ideas strongly marked by Ashʿarite Sunni orthodoxy. In the earlier “Almohad parenthesis,” great thinkers like Ibn Tufayl and Ibn Rushd, backed by the ruling powers (though ever more hesitantly), had been tempted by a falsafa of Aristotelian inspiration; but it was rejected under the Nasrids, as in the rest of the Arab-Muslim world. Jean-Claude Garcin, in introducing his chapter on the Mamluks of Cairo, wrote that with that regime, “under the protection of the invaders the last grand synthesis of Islam before modern times was forged…. The climate of intellectual conformity that marked it does not detract from its historical importance, for this cultural legacy would continue for centuries under the Ottomans and undergo no true renovation.”39 We might pass the same judgment on the Nasrid 39\n\n“… s’élabore à l’abri des envahisseurs, la dernière grande synthèse de l’Islam arabe avant les temps modernes … Le climat de conformisme intellectuel qui marque cette élaboration - 978-90-04-44359-4 Downloaded from Brill.com04/11/2021 09:51:24AM via Universidad de Granada\n\n16\n\nGuichard\n\nkingdom which, with its monuments and brilliant literature in Arabic, can be seen as an “exceptional” moment in late medieval Islam. But we can also ask ourselves whether, while actually attached socially, politically, and intellectually to the general trends of the Arab Mediterranean world, it was simply more dramatically exposed to the “barbarous” pressure of the Christians, which made this province of Dār al-Islām too fragile to survive. In some contributions to this volume we see a reaction to the notion that the Nasrid area represents a weakening or “cultural decline” relative to earlier periods of “greatness,” from the caliphate of Cordova to the Almohads. I took such a position myself in the chapters on the late-medieval kingdom of Granada in my collected volumes on al-Andalus.40 Perhaps the most appropriate phrase for the change from the intellectual innovations of the Almohad period is “intellectual conformity,” which Jean-Claude Garcin applied to the Mamluks. 4\n\nFamily Structures and Habitat\n\nOne occasionally senses in authors in the present volume some resistance to joining a historiographical tendency judged too “tribalist,” and often attributed to my 1976 book Al-Andalus.41 In effect, that book marked the beginning of an “Orientalizing” slant in its assessment of the changes brought to the Peninsula by the Arab-Berber conquest of the early eighth century. Eduardo Manzano, in a passage subtitled “¿Una sociedad tribal?,” distances himself from my interpretations from 1976, which he finds based “on a thesis opposed to the ‘continuist’ view that had prevailed until then: the invasion by Arab and Berber groups, far from producing a mere religious or cultural veneer that would barely have affected Spain’s historical essence, marked a profound ‘rupture’ with respect to the situation before 711…. Faced with a dying and weakened ‘prefeudal’ society under the last Visigoths, the conquerors brought an expanding society organized along tribal and clan lines that endowed its members with strong internal cohesion.”42 By this interpretation, he asserts, these strongly n’enlève rien à son importance historique car ce legs culturel va constituer pour plusieurs siècles sous les Ottomans, un acquis qui ne sera pas vraiment renouvelé”: Garcin, États, sociétés et cultures, 343. 40 E.g., Guichard, Al-Andalus: 711–1492. 41 Guichard, Al-Andalus: estructura antropológica. 42 “… en una tesis opuesta a la visión ‘coninuista’ hasta entonces dominante: lejos de haber supuesto un mero barniz religioso o cultural que en poco o nada había afectado a la esen­cia histórica de España, la irrupción de grupos árabes y bereberes marcaba una profunda ‘ruptura’ con respecto a la situación anterior al año 711….

It hardly needs saying that I am fully aware that five long centuries intervened between the Arab conquest and the post-Almohad crisis that gave rise to the Nasrid kingdom; and that obviously al-Andalus, after its earliest era and the politico-military incursions of the Almoravids and Almohads, was never tribal to the extent that the Maghreb was in the late Middle Ages. I believe that I never referred to the existence of “tribes” in al-Andalus in my dissertation on Valencia in the eleventh to thirteenth centuries, except of course when Maghrebi powers or persons intervened in al-Andalus at the time. We can trust the words of Amalia Zomeño (“Families and Family Ties,” in this volume): “Most of Granada’s population was Arab and Muslim, what we might call ‘definitively Andalusi,’ but together with that Arab majority the Andalusi was defined as including an important Berber component.” The contingent of North-African origin had been added to the population base inherited from earlier times. Zomeño adds that these ethnic distinctions carried no great weight in the late period except to the extent that they legitimated (as they did for the Nasrid dynasty itself) the right to rule based on a claim of Arabism rooted in the most ancient historical and religious tradition. The Nasrids, in fact, traced their real or fictional genealogy (offered by their sycophants like Ibn al-Khatīb) to Saʿd b. ʿUbāda, “head of the tribe of Khazraj, one of the Companions who protected the Prophet in his flight from Mecca to Medina.”43 Zomeño notes that such remembrances of tribal or clanic conduct were purely theoretical. She cites Manuel Acién who, in his studies of the Berber settlement of the Serranía de Ronda, “is reluctant to suggest that these groups behaved like qabīlas or tribes, since they included an exogenous component,” and also Antonio Malpica Cuello, who “sees tribal bonds and the links between kinship and territory as significantly weakened in Granada, especially since the population was mobile and exogamy was frequent.” Finally, the families of men of letters and intellectuals that we know of believed themselves to exist within an overall patrilineal system that is reflected in their genealogies. We offer the example of Abū l-Ḥasan b. Saʿīd al-Ansī: in the debilitada sociedad ‘prefeudal’ de los últimos tiempos del reino visigodo, los conquistadores representaban una sociedad en expansión, organizada sobre vínculos tribales y clánicos que dotaban a sus miembros de una fuerte cohesión interna”: Manzano Moreno, Conquistadores, emires y califas, 131–32. 43 Arié, L’Espagne musulmane, 182.\n\n- 978-90-04-44359-4 Downloaded from Brill.com04/11/2021 09:51:24AM via Universidad de Granada\n\n18\n\nGuichard\n\nmiddle of the thirteenth century he completed al-Mughrib fī hulā l-Maghrib, a significant work begun over a century earlier in the time of his paternal greatgrandfather, who contributed to it along with his descendants. Its last author, our Abu l-Ḥasan b. Saʿīd, belonged to a powerful family connected to Alcalá la Real (Qalʿat Banī Saʿīd) and left Spain with his father on the accession of the Nasrids, since they were partisans of the Nasrids’ adversary Ibn Ḥūd of Murcia. His writings allow us to reconstruct his genealogy all the way back to his remote ancestor of the Yemenite tribe of Ans, who came to the Peninsula in the eighth century, and at least part of his paternal line from the mid-twelfth century onward. The information he offers shows that even in the time of this last author of al-Mughrib there remained a consciousness of ties among different lines of this family or “clan” of the Banū Saʿīd, even those no longer closely related. Our Abū l-Ḥasan, during his years of service to the Hafsid sultan al-Mustansir in Tunis between 1254 and 1267, frequented another Ibn Saʿīd, a vizier in that government, from a branch of the same Andalusi family that had emigrated to Ifrīqiya a half-century earlier; he considered him a paternal cousin (ibn alʿamm) even though their relationship was very distant – their common ancestor was about five generations back.44 Such a consciousness of belonging to the same group of relatives despite great genealogical and geographical distances seems to me hardly possible except within an Arab patrilineal system. If cognatic relations had been counted, the lines would have diverged much sooner. In referring to my thesis of 1976 about the fundamental “Easternness” of Andalusi society, Amalia Zomeño is entirely right to observe one fundamental change in our handling of sources for the urban, or urbanized, society of alAndalus: “we can now include data about family economy and present families as units – if not of production, at least of developing economic strategies for preserving family property.” Some of these come from Arabic documents from Granada that testify to juridical practice under the Nasrid sultanate, but the most important are collections of fatwas: the most important is the Miʿyār of the North African jurist al-Wansharīsī (1430–1508), on which Zomeño relies for her study of how these “family strategies” operated. Nonetheless she acknowledges that, for example, although we know that in theory inheritances should be divided according to Qurʾanic law, our information about the actual transmission of property is very imperfect – the Muslim world is known to have many ways of circumventing that legislation. She hypothesizes that “Granadans tried to pass on their assets during their lifetimes so that little or nothing would remain when the time came to distribute them according to Qurʾanic law.” She also emphasizes that “the matrimonial tie did not produce 44 BAA 5: nos. 1063, 1067.\n\n- 978-90-04-44359-4 Downloaded from Brill.com04/11/2021 09:51:24AM via Universidad de Granada\n\nThe Nasrid Kingdom in the History of al-Andalus\n\n19\n\na new, productive economic unit, since spouses’ property remained under the (indirect) control of the family of each.” This stands in significant contrast to the practice of Western Christian societies, and the Nasrid custom must not have been very different from that of other urban Arab societies in Dār al-Islām. We can assume that neither did it differ in other aspects, for instance in the endogamous and polygamous marriages that are important elements of the Arab-Muslim family system. On the first point it is certainly difficult to generalize. I have already spoken of the frequent endogamous marriages within the dynasty, evoked by Manuela Marín in Mujeres en al-Andalus: “Curiously, the practice of endogamous marriages within the ruling family returns in force in the final period of Andalusi history, for we find several instances of it in the Nasrid family.”45 But we need not, like Marín, be surprised at this fact; it seems to me the more remarkable that, in a play of diplomacy between powers of a “Western” type, matrimonial alliances might have been forged with other dynasties of comparable standing in the Muslim West, yet this does not seem to have happened. Probably other important Andalusi families of the time also practiced endogamy in accordance with Arab tradition and (with some exceptions) favored marriage with a female paternal cousin (bint al-ʿamm). We know of the physician Abū ʿAbd Allāh Muḥammad al-Shaqūrī, cited in the article by Expiración García Sánchez, who lived in the fourteenth century and whose parents were first cousins.46 In an article many years ago I studied the family of the ra‌ʾīs of Crevillent (in the modern province of Alicante), in which endogamy is found in many generations.47 It is in Christian sources from Aragon, however, that we learn of the endogamy in this important family from Sharq al-Andalus, and not from Arabic ones, which have little to say on such topics. As for polygamy, it is also difficult to cite definite statistics because so few allusions to women appear in written texts. The example of Ibn al-Khatīb would be interesting in this regard: we know very little about the nuclear family of this very famous writer, even though much is written about his lineage in general. He himself shares some significant information, such as his grandfather’s matrimonial alliances with families from Granada’s aristocracy. We know that he aspired to marry the daughter of his teacher Ibn al-Jayyāb and also to marry into an important Granadan family, the Banū Juzayy, in both cases without success. We do not know who his mother was and have the name of only one\n\n45 Marín, Mujeres, 541. 46 BAA, 7:302–03, no. 1702. 47 Guichard, “Un seigneur musulman.”\n\n- 978-90-04-44359-4 Downloaded from Brill.com04/11/2021 09:51:24AM via Universidad de Granada\n\n20\n\nGuichard\n\nwife, Iqbal, because he wrote an elegy to her on her death.48 For a number of reasons – especially economic, but also a certain resistance by women themselves – polygamy must scarcely have existed outside the highest social classes. Nonetheless it was entirely possible, both legally and morally. Abū lBarakat al-Balafīqī (1281–1370), a respected and pious jurist from Almería with a reputation for humility, goodness, and moderate mysticism, was in no way censured for having divorced several wives and been survived by four legitimate ones on his death; despite his reputation as an ascetic he was known for his strong inclination toward women.49 Amalia Zomeño believes that polygamy was more common than has previously been thought. These questions of matrimony touch on the place of women in the social structure. Also relevant is the issue of domestic space, discussed here by María Elena Díez Jorge, who recalls classic legal consultations having to do with buildings that overlook other homes, with frequent cases that involve the height of neighboring terraces. It is easy to agree with her that “[l]egal precepts governing domestic privacy … were not exclusive to the world of al-Andalus, since they also occurred in contemporary Christian kingdoms,” and that “this privacy affected not only women but the entire domestic group.” Further, we should not see the Andalusi habitat as made up entirely of courtyard houses: André Bazzana offers many examples in his dissertation of what he considers the most common type of dwelling based on archaeological evidence, the “single-cell house” (maison monocellulaire). Square or rectangular in shape, it seems to have been, “from Valencia to Andalusia and La Mancha and beyond, as far as southern Extremadura and the Algarve, the commonest type of dwelling … [and] the setting for family life and the productive activities of the couple and their children.”50 These houses were generally small – the Repartimiento of Loja, for instance, normally gave several to a single Christian settler – and could scarcely have boasted an interior courtyard. Despite the complexity of Granadan houses that Díez Jorge stresses, and the difficulty of establishing a true “model,” the type with an interior patio must be taken into account in any discussion of the habitat. Archaeologists have found it from one end of al-Andalus to the other, from Cieza to Mértola, including the Nasrid site at Castillejo de los Guájares, where it is present but not at all exclusive. It is also true that even the earliest Islamic law condemns the harm done to 48 BAA, 3:646, 648. 49 BAA, 1:162, no. 52. 50 “… de Valence jusqu’à l’Andalousie et la Manche, et plus loin, jusqu’au sud de l’Estrémadure et de l’Algarve, le type d’habitat le plus commun … [et] le cadre de la vie familiale et des activités productrices du couple et de ses enfants”: Bazzana, Maisons d’al-Andalus, 1:164.\n\n- 978-90-04-44359-4 Downloaded from Brill.com04/11/2021 09:51:24AM via Universidad de Granada\n\nThe Nasrid Kingdom in the History of al-Andalus\n\n21\n\nothers by “visual indiscretion,” which all jurists denounce. Jean-Pierre Van Staëvel has shown the stability of these opinions, from the tenth-century jurist Ibn al-Imām of Tudela to the fourteenth-century Tunisian master mason Ibn Rāmī,51 adding that, without being too culturalist, we must recognize that this notion held “an absolutely central place in juridical thought” throughout the Middle Ages.52 Obviously we should determine the extent to which social practice conformed to the law. If we are to believe Rafael López Guzmán, who is cited by Díez Jorge, not until the sixteenth century did the homes of Granada’s aristocracy acquire a monumental entrance, replace their interior garden with a solid floor, modify the internal distribution of the rooms, and replace lateral staircases to the upper story with a single, central one. The same authors note another significant change at this period: the disappearance of the “elbowed” entrance to the patio, i.e., the classic zaguán, which protected the intimacy of the home discussed by Díez Jorge; this phenomenon is often mentioned in archaeological and ethnographic studies of the “Muslim house” in al-Andalus.53 Without claiming that the zaguán was an obligatory element of such houses, we must acknowledge that it is also found all over al-Andalus from the eleventh to the fifteenth centuries, continuing an arrangement that was habitual and commonly recognized in the Maghreb. Lucette Valensi speaks of the type of house that was “a model for the whole urban complex … a family organism that groups the private apartments around a courtyard. Forbidden to the eyes of strangers – the façade is blind and the entryway a zigzag – it harbors a single family. An edifice that would house several families is unknown.”54 We find this obvious protection of the privacy of the extended family, and particularly of the honor of its women, in many places: most recently toward the northern frontier of al-Andalus at the beautiful site of al-Balāt above the town of Romangordo and the southern bank of the Tagus (modern province of Cáceres), conquered by the Christians in 1142. The principal house excavated there “follows a model widely distributed through al-Andalus from the tenth century: a dwelling of about 77 square meters of usable space, reached through a zaguán whose elbow shape prevents the patio from being seen from the street.”55 While we wish neither to “essentialize” this model excessively, nor to “differentialize” in an exaggerated way the layout of an Arab-Muslim house as 51 52 53 54 55\n\nVan Staëvel, Droit malikite et habitat, 89–92 (quotation at 91 n. 9), 478–83.

They are based on sources that speak of an apparent richness of artisanal products, and of what was raised or grown in dry-farmed and irrigated fields in the sultanate. But they soon become mere enumerations that, it must be confessed, grow tedious, and it is not clear how these lists can help us beyond what the documents provide. We find them easily in any chapter on the Andalusi economy, like the one that Rachel Arié offers: Arab writers praised the abundance of crops from orchards and gardens, because of the fertility of the irrigated soil. Ibn Bassāl of Toledo described the cultivation of melons and watermelons in detail and praised that of cucumbers, asparagus, and eggplants. Muslim travelers and poets exclaimed in ecstasy over the quality of fruits and cherries from Granada, pears from the Ebro valley, almonds from Denia, pomegranates and peaches from Málaga and Elvira, and above all figs from Almuñécar, Málaga, and Seville. The Castilian chronicle of King John II praises in several passages the overall verdure of the Grazalema mountains and the region of Málaga.56\n\n56 “Los autores árabes elogiaron la abundancia de cultivos hortícolas y de vergeles, debida a la fertilidad del suelo irrigado.

This is why both internal and external trade in specialized manufactures (silk fabrics, leather, weapons, furs, ceramics, fruits and nuts, bracelets, earrings, shoes adorned with silver and precious stones, etc.) was so highly developed.57 There is no doubt that this picture reflects what our sources tell us. In the same chapter, à propos of José Hinojosa Montalvo’s study of Granadan trade with Valencia (based on Christian sources), the imported goods cited include “a wide variety of merchandise: white clay for ceramics, hemp fiber, silver spoons and goblets, saffron, cotton, copper cauldrons, wooden caskets, deerskins, ginger, silver jugs, honey, woolen blankets, twenty-five quintales of tin….” I am not criticizing these enumerations here, since the historian must quote them to give us an idea of what the sources contain; but we should compare the texts systematically to objects that have been preserved. Cristóbal Torres Delgado makes this suggestion on a page dedicated to armor and weapons in Granada, claiming that arms manufacture was perfected through metallurgic techniques known in al-Andalus, and benefited from military practices introduced into the sultanate by “Zanātī” warriors under the Merinids. Christians valued these arms, as J. Ferrandis Torres proved by consulting Castilian inventories from the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. There are isolated testimonies to the recognized quality of Granadan products: in 1333, Alphonse XI of Castile offered Muḥammad IV cloth of gold and silk made in Granada!58 It is hard to go beyond these frequent but scattered mentions, and Torres Delgado himself is aware that our factual information is fairly disappointing, claiming that it is still practically impossible for research to provide satisfactory answers. Nonetheless lists such as these, and the too-few surviving objects, can tell us something about the variety and apparent prosperity of an economy 57\n\n“[T]oda la producción económica del reino de Granada se orienta al consumo interior, y a las industrias derivadas de la agricultura o sus recursos mineros, que dan un crecimiento y extraordinaria calidad a la artesanía y productos manufacturados de los Nazaríes.

From this perspective the Nasrid kingdom appears as a sort of “turntable,” or in any case the focus of intense commercial traffic in specialized and expensive goods such as silk, sugar, and dried fruits, all objects of strong European demand. But it is also clear that the initiative for this economic activity came almost exclusively from the Christian powers that dominated economic relations between Northern and Southern Europe at the time. Chief among these was the Republic of Genoa, which is omnipresent in our sources on the economy of the kingdom of Granada. It was not alone, however, and Adela Fábregas has pointed to efforts to participate by other centers such as Venice. Other actors, for example Florence, are less in evidence, but overall it was Christian powers and their merchants who held pride of place in the sultanate’s external relations. Several publications have studied this theme over the last half-century and are still being followed by major works that reveal new aspects, such as those of Jacques Heers and Federico Melis on Italy and Roser Salicrú’s dissertation on the sultanate of Granada and the Crown of Aragon.59 History of art and archaeology have brought to our attention one of Granada’s chief exports, luxury ceramics with gold and sometimes blue glazes, or “lustreware.” Even a superficial glance at the best examples, such as the famous jarrones of the Alhambra, reveals the level of perfection the art had achieved and the complex and delicate technology of its Nasrid artisans/ artists. But scientific analysis has allowed us to go further than this initial “aesthetic” judgment based on just a few emblematic pieces. Alberto García Porras is correct in saying that the “highest level of technological sophistication” in these artifacts required “extraordinary control and knowledge on the part of the artisans who made them.” He has also developed a new analysis of the clear formal distinction between “luxury” pieces and those for domestic use: “this allows us to consider the possibility that in the Nasrid kingdom external factors, such as commerce and its increasingly present agents, may have influenced the development of this split.” Nasrid production of ceramics destined for an elite, whether local or foreign, would have adapted itself to luxury tastes and attained “a commercial success that proved ephemeral, for it was soon replaced by other Peninsular products that applied the technology developed in Granada but managed to establish a production better aligned with the growing commercial context of the Mediterranean.” He means specifically the ceramics of Manises in Valencia (which he has also studied), which in the 59\n\nSalicrú i Lluch, El Sultanat de Granada i la Corona d’Aragó.\n\n- 978-90-04-44359-4 Downloaded from Brill.com04/11/2021 09:51:24AM via Universidad de Granada\n\nThe Nasrid Kingdom in the History of al-Andalus\n\n25\n\nfourteenth and fifteenth centuries largely replaced terra maliqa – whose name reveals that it originated in Málaga or was exported through that city.60 An analysis of this type points us toward an urban economy enlivened by commercial traffic. The available sources clarify to a certain extent which agricultural products passed through those circuits (e.g., the triad of sugar, silk, and dried fruits, which were usually exported), but tell us little about the social context in which they existed. Adela Fábregas reminds us that sugar entered European markets in the thirteenth century; we assume that most of it – a proportion we unfortunately cannot assess – was produced in periurban areas directly controlled by the sultan or the aristocracy. Silk production, on the other hand, so often mentioned in written documents, must have been spread more widely and have occupied a much broader segment of rural society. While trade in silk was abundant, we have less understanding of the specific conditions of its production and commercialization. As a general rule the urban context is better described, because of the greater homogeneity of socioeconomic structures in Arab-Muslim cities of the Mediterranean area: there are consistent juridical sources for the Nasrid sultanate and its immediate predecessors, for instance concerning the hisba or oversight of markets, funduqs such as the Corral del Carbón,61 and qaysariyyas. The same cannot be said for the organization of rural societies. I will mention parenthetically here a passage about rural society from my essay in The Legacy of Muslim Spain.62 Recalling work on “hydraulic archaeology” by Miquel Barceló and his colleagues on Majorca, and mine with André Bazzana in rural areas of Valencia, I referred to documents from the time of the Christian conquest of the plain of Gandía: these reveal, in the mid-thirteenth century, an irrigation system organized around “water towers” associated with villages whose names reflect a clear gentilic origin: Beniarjó, Beniflá, Benieto, etc. Toponyms of this type are very abundant in the eastern region but relatively rare in Andalusia, where the organization of settlement seems to have been of another type. Unfortunately no source from the Muslim era provides details about how residents of these farmsteads (alquerías) near Gandía were connected (or not) to the “segmented” or “clanic” reality suggested by such toponymy at the time of the Christian conquest. And we know little more about how these rural localities were organized; no doubt they were closely linked to some central site, like those in the Alpujarra, placed so as to dominate the irrigated fields whose hydraulic system and cultivation they controlled. 60 Fábregas García and García Porras, “Genoese Trade Networks.” 61 Arié, España musulmana, 343. 62 Guichard, “The Social History of Muslim Spain.”\n\n- 978-90-04-44359-4 Downloaded from Brill.com04/11/2021 09:51:24AM via Universidad de Granada\n\n26\n\nGuichard\n\nAdela Fábregas, referring to my work in her essay here, confirms my proposal that the community dynamics of rural aljamas as revealed in Latin sources from Valencia “can be seen as reminiscences of kinship systems that derive from Eastern societies and Berber groups and were especially vital in rural areas and peasant communities.” It remains to be seen whether this interpretation, which I consider valid for Sharq al-Andalus (Valencia and Murcia) can also inspire scholars who work on Nasrid Andalusia; I will not enter any possible debate, as I have insufficient data at my disposal. What seems clear, however, from Fábregas’s contribution is a vision of the agrarian economy based chiefly on “[g]roups of free peasants who lived and worked in small farmsteads [and] were chiefly engaged in direct cultivation…. [M]ost of Andalusi and Nasrid agricultural lands were organized into small and medium-sized properties that typified the unit of cultivation in rural areas. Large holdings were restricted to certain areas, usually in periurban zones.” Such an overview of agrarian structures evidently takes us away from more “latifundist” interpretations, which are only slowly being abandoned. We recall how Ambrosio Huici Miranda, a fine historian and expert in texts, wrote on the subject of agriculture and latifundia that Valencian peasants were probably less wretched than those elsewhere in Muslim Spain because their region was so rich, but they still did not possess their own lands and were reduced to almost serflike status.63 Rachel Arié, in her 1973 dissertation, dedicated only a few lines to how land was exploited in Granada.64 Conscious of the extreme paucity of information in Arab sources, she focused on large estates owned by the sultans and the aristocracy, while observing that Ibn al-Khatīb also speaks of hamlets that “belonged in common to thousands of persons” and were named in “many titles to private property.” I will not attempt to re-analyze the chapters that concern the economy. As Raúl González Arévalo demonstrates, we must look to Christian sources to clarify the conditions of existence in the sultanate of Granada. Adela Fábregas shows that if we wish to learn about Nasrid agriculture “our more specific knowledge of how the fields of Nasrid lands were cultivated is based only on later sources – the famous Libros de Apeos and Repartimientos (ledgers of distribution and reapportionment) compiled immediately after the Christian conquest.” Available documents suggest that when the Nasrid state inserted itself into the powerful commercial networks based in Christian (especially Italian) centers, the result was increasing pressure from the state, which “adopted the commercial option as a strategy for political and economic survival within the international balance of power.” To a certain extent it could operate 63 Huici Miranda, Historia musulmana de Valencia, 1:51. 64 L’Espagne musulmane au temps des Nasrides, 351.\n\n- 978-90-04-44359-4 Downloaded from Brill.com04/11/2021 09:51:24AM via Universidad de Granada\n\nThe Nasrid Kingdom in the History of al-Andalus\n\n27\n\nthrough the medium of taxation. This is an interesting hypothesis that opens potentially fruitful lines of research by taking urban-rural relations into consideration, relying on the best-studied regions such as the Alpujarra. It also suggests areas for investigation that are still little explored, such as numismatics. We should also ponder how much room for maneuver the Nasrid state actually possessed within the context of “Islamic taxation”: in theory its norms were common to all Muslim states, but we know much less about its practical applications, though post-conquest Christian documents and Muslim legal literature can offer some insights for Granada. Most likely the constant threat from the Christians, making a virtue of necessity, gave the state considerable latitude in this area. For example, a fatwa by Ibn Manzur (d. ca. 1480) mentions a maʿūna related to real estate and taxation: it appears to conform to Qurʾanic norms in its use of common terms used elsewhere, such as alacer or “tithe” (Arabic ʿushr). The jurist claims that this tax was imposed to help satisfy the country’s needs, and that in general non-Qurʾanic taxation can be justified if it is “to ensure the defense of the nation.”65 We can assume in any case that the pressure of taxation, el duro fisco de los emires, was a significant burden on the eve of the Christian conquest. 6\n\nWritten Culture\n\nIn speaking of the urban network in Granada, we have already mentioned an Arab-Islamic culture that – from the tiny rural hamlet that consulted a famous jurist about a pious foundation to the highest legal-religious authorities of the capital – included all its scholars and men of letters in a single coherent system. Those men were responsible for the transmission and continuation of knowledge, and their biographies often contain impressive lists of masters and disciples. M.D. Rodríguez Gómez’s essay in this volume recalls that Ibn Khaldūn (1332–1406) pointed out a notable difference between education in al-Andalus and that in other parts of the Maghreb: Andalusis were better prepared in the Arabic language (it was less influenced by Berber), and “primary school” relied less on teaching the Qurʾan, while including “non-religious” language through an earlier exposure to poetry and prose. This great writer credits the Andalusis with this difference and a better mastery of Arabic, and speaks of them many times; yet interestingly his overall view of Nasrid culture, then reaching its zenith, is not entirely positive. No one can introduce us to the cultural life of Western Islam in the fourteenth century better than Ibn 65 Lagardère, Histoire et société, 200, no. 394; Arié, España musulmana, 217.\n\n- 978-90-04-44359-4 Downloaded from Brill.com04/11/2021 09:51:24AM via Universidad de Granada\n\n28\n\nGuichard\n\nKhaldūn. He was thoroughly familiar with the three states that then occupied North Africa, both their capital cities and their rural areas; that formed the foundation of his reflections on the contrast between “urban” and “rural” civilizations (ʿumrān madanī/ʿumrān badawī) and led to the theory that made him the world’s first “sociologist.” Nor can we deny Ibn Khaldūn’s excellent knowledge of Andalusi intellectual culture; his writings abound in references to great scholars of Andalusi origin whom he knew personally as contemporaries. In the Maghreb he frequented several of them, such as Abū l-Qāsim al-Barjī (d. 1384, born in Berja in 1310), who, he said, had studied with the best Andalusi teachers, “learning law and literature from them,” before emigrating to Bougie in 1340. There he had “distinguished himself in the art of composition in both prose and verse” and had enjoyed a brilliant career in the Maghreb under the Hafsids and especially the Merinids, serving in several posts as secretary and qadi. Ibn Khaldūn considered him his “friend … a man unequalled for the sweetness of his character, his courtesy, delicacy, amiabi"
