History

The taifa (principality) began as a small, weakly-defended territory comprising parts of the modern Spanish provinces of Seville, Huelva, and CÃ¡diz, but quickly emerged as the most powerful taifa of the time, after its rulers began a policy of expansion.

The first emir of Seville was Abu al-Qasim (1023â1042). He was qadi of Seville and declared independence from the Caliphate of CÃ³rdoba after its downfall in 1031, becoming Abbad I, emir of Seville. His son, Abbad II al-Mu'tadid (1042â1069) who succeeded him, expanded the taifa by conquering Mertola, Niebla, SaltÃ©s and Huelva, Silves, Santa MarÃ­a de Algarve during his reign.[4]

His son, Muhammad al-Mu'tamid (1069â1091), turned Seville into a major centre of Ibero-Muslim culture. He seized CÃ³rdoba in 1071,[5] and maintained a precarious hold on the city until 1091 (with a brief interlude in 1075â1078). While his vizier and fellow poet Ibn Ammar, conquered Murcia.[4]

Nevertheless, the Abbad dynasty felt insecure from Castile's military successes in Aragon, Valencia, and especially from the fall of Toledo in 1085 under the leadership of King Alfonso VI. Al-Mu'tamid requested assistance from the Almoravids, a dynasty from present-day Morocco, to fight against the Castilians. The Almoravids established themselves at Algeciras, and after defeating the Christians at the Battle of Sagrajas in 1086, occupied the other Muslim taifas, including Seville itself in 1091. Following this, the Almoravids would go on to occupy and control vast swathes of present-day Spain.[4] After they ravaged the city, al-Mu'tamid ordered his sons to surrender the royal fortress (the location of the present-day AlcÃ¡zar of Seville)[6] in order to save their lives. He was taken prisoner to Aghmat, where he was executed in 1095.
