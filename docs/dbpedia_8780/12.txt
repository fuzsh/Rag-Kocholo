The Taifa of Jaén was a Muslim territory that emerged in al-Andalus, as a result of the disintegration that the Caliphate of Córdoba had been suffering since 1009 and whose origin was the cora of Jaén.

First taifa kingdoms

Control of Granada and independent Kingdom

Since 1013 it was a territory controlled by the taifa of Granada, which had two districts: Jaén and Granada. In March 1018, the Caliph of Córdoba Abderramán IV conquered the district of Jaén and gave it the name of kingdom, however in 1019 Habús ben Maksan of Granada reconquered it, unifying both territories and installing his capital in Granada, to the detriment of Elvira, the former capital of the homonymous choir.

Seville Control

In 1031 the district of Jaén was subdued by Abu ul-Qásim, of the taifa of Seville, who controlled it until its conquest at the hands of the Almoravids in 1091. Therefore this kingdom of Jaén belongs chronologically to the first kingdoms of taifas.

Second kingdoms of taifas

With the appearance of the second taifa kingdoms, Jaén and its territory achieved a certain independence as taifa during a period of twenty years, from 1148 to 1168, under the successive governments of Abu Jafar ibn Hud Saif al-Dawla (Zafadola), descendant of the Hudis, kings of the Taifa of Zaragoza, of the Almoravid vali Yahya ben Ganiya, of Abd al-Mumin and of Muhammad ben Ali al-Kumí.

Murcia Control

In 1159 Muhammad ibn Mardanish, the "Wolf King", incorporated Jaén into his extensive Taifa of Murcia, succeeding him in the government of the taifa of Jaén Ibraim ben Ahmed ben Mufarach ben Hamuskh. Finally, It passed into the hands of the Almohads.

After the defeat in the Battle of Las Navas de Tolosa (1212) the Almohad power in the peninsula was greatly weakened and their rule became purely theoretical, proliferating new taifas that would declare themselves independent.
