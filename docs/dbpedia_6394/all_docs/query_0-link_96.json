        "text": "Tse, who also directs the action, plays a customs officer who intercepts a boatload of weapons and single-handedly stops their terrorist owners grabbing them back in Herman Yau’s highly implausible film.\n\nA teenage student cramming for Hong Kong’s university entrance exam joins YouTuber Hui Yin, who is resitting it at 30 to put right his past failures, in documentary Once Upon a Time in HKDSE.\n\nLau Ching-wan plays a police hostage negotiator framed for murder and Francis Ng an ex-colleague in Herman Yau’s pale remake of Hollywood movie The Negotiator.\n\nChristopher Sun’s film has the trappings of a social realist drama, but in fact is a well constructed mystery. Not without its flaws, it is a welcome addition to the Hong Kong film canon.\n\nA migrant from China to Hong Kong (Raymond Lam) winds up in the Kowloon Walled City, where he befriends mobsters, in Soi Cheang’s lavishly funded yet edgy film, a spectacle let down by its storytelling.\n\nStarring Patra Au, Tai Bo and Leung Chung-hang, director Ray Yeung’s LGBTQ drama All Shall Be Well sees an elderly Hong Kong lesbian at risk of losing everything after her partner suddenly dies.\n\nDonna Ong’s documentary examines cinema and Hong Kong history from the 1950s onwards through the eyes of a titan of the cultural scene. Fascinating and packed with archive material, it is narrated by Law.\n\nDirector Sam Wong has tried to pack too much into Suspect, and the result is an incoherent mess. Playing a detective with unusual powers, Nick Cheung endures some frankly stupid set pieces.\n\nMartial arts film icon and the 2024 Hong Kong Film Awards’ Lifetime Achievement Award recipient Sammo Hung talks about his movies, stars like Donnie Yen, Bruce Lee and Jackie Chan – and eating.\n\nThe same five titles dominate the nominations in all major categories of the Hong Kong Film Awards 2024. Post film editor Edmund Lee predicts the winners and reflects on who or what actually should win.\n\nWriter and director Sasha Chuk stars in her debut film Fly Me to the Moon, which follows a young immigrant from mainland China as she struggles to live life in Hong Kong.\n\nThe big mystery about this suspense drama is how a film with such a promising scenario – a star-crossed romance, identity swap and cold-blooded murder – can turn out so dull, nonsensical and awful.\n\nA heist movie that looks like it was dreamed up by a five-year-old, We 12, starring all the members of Cantopop boy band Mirror, is witless, lifeless and above all dull. For true fans only.\n\nThe meaning of home and family when one is kept apart from them by a pandemic is a big theme of Tsang Tsui-shan’s film about once-a-decade festivities in rural Hong Kong for which emigrants cannot return.\n\nWe Are Family, Hong Kong comic Eric Tsang’s film about rent-a-families, starts off as a farcical showbiz satire before taking viewers on an emotional roller coaster, and ends as a poignant tear-jerker.\n\nA charismatic Chung Suet-ying stars in coming-of-age comedy The Lyricist Wannabe as a woman who tries – and continually fails – to become a Cantopop songwriter.\n\nComedy sequel Table for Six 2, The Moon Thieves – a heist thriller starring Mirror boy band idols – and darkly comic Aaron Kwok crime caper Rob N Roll: the Post film editor’s views of Lunar New Year releases.\n\nIn Rob N Roll, Lam Ka-tung and Richie Jen play two middle-aged losers who get caught up in the fall-out from an armed robbery led by Aaron Kwok’s former pro wrestler. It’s well acted, but convoluted.\n\nTable for Six 2, the sequel to the Hong Kong Lunar New Year comedy sensation, is a satisfyingly chaotic ensemble comedy with Louis Cheung and Stephy Tang that explores family and romantic relationships.\n\nThis year’s Hong Kong Film Awards are completely dominated by the same five front runners, although one – In Broad Daylight – stands out from the pack with 16 nominations.\n\nMirror’s Anson Lo, Keung To and Edan Lui star in a by-the-numbers crime thriller about a Tokyo watch heist that entertains with slick visuals and charismatic performances by all but one of the main cast.\n\nThe latest instalment in the most inept crime thriller series in Hong Kong cinema in the past 10 years, Crypto Storm, with its young, good-looking cast, is watchable if you forget how farcical its story is.\n\nIn Hong Kong director Patrick Kong’s latest romance movie, Mandy Tam plays a young woman who falls for Edward Chen’s rich young man. The story starts off passably, but deteriorates at the end.\n\nDirector Kelvin Shum’s debut film, Deliverance, while atmospheric and visually striking, is undone by its highly unrealistic screenplay – we might give this one a miss.\n\nDirected by Soi Cheang, Mad Fate has been voted the best Hong Kong film of 2023 in the latest Hong Kong Film Critics Society Awards, with Wu Kang-ren and Jennifer Yu winning acting prizes.\n\nAndy Lau’s drug lord in crime thriller I Did It My Way comes off as unreasonable to the point of being comic, and confusing writing and a superficial depiction of Asia’s dark web only add to the farce.\n\nNick Cheung, William Chan and Isabella Leong star in Bursting Point, Dante Lam’s first Hong Kong crime thriller in years and one packed with enough violence to warrant an adults-only rating."
