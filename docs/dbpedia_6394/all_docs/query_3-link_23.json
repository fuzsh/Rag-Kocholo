        "text": "The crime film genre is a category of film that focuses on the criminal activities and investigations related to them. The genre can include a wide range of subgenres, each with its own specific focus and style. Some of the most notable subgenres within the crime film genre include film noir, neo-noir, psychological thriller, and military thriller. Film noir is a subgenre of crime film that is characterized by its dark and moody visual style, as well as its focus on themes of crime, corruption, and moral ambiguity. This subgenre often features morally conflicted protagonists, femme fatales, and convoluted plots that are filled with twists and turns. Classic examples of film noir include \"Double Indemnity\" and \"The Maltese Falcon.\" Neo-noir, on the other hand, refers to crime films that are made with a modern sensibility but still retain the dark and gritty elements of classic film noir. These films often take a more contemporary approach to storytelling and visual style, while still exploring themes of crime and moral ambiguity. Examples of neo-noir films include \"Chinatown\" and \"L.A. Confidential.\" The psychological thriller subgenre of crime film focuses on the psychological and emotional aspects of crime and criminal behavior. These films often delve into the minds of both the perpetrators and the investigators, exploring the motivations and thought processes behind their actions. Examples of psychological thrillers include \"Silence of the Lambs\" and \"Se7en.\" Military thriller is a subgenre of crime film that focuses on military or spy operations, often involving espionage, covert operations, and international conflicts. These films often feature high-stakes action and suspenseful storytelling, with a focus on the military or intelligence organizations. Examples of military thrillers include \"Zero Dark Thirty\" and \"Black Hawk Down.\" In conclusion, the crime film genre is a diverse category that encompasses a wide range of subgenres, each with its own unique focus and style. Whether it's the dark and moody world of film noir, the modern sensibilities of neo-noir, the psychological complexity of thrillers, or the high-stakes action of military thrillers, this genre offers something for every fan of crime and suspenseful storytelling."
