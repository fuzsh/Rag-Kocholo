        "text": "Wow that worked great and took about 30 seconds including the time it took to download the app. Thanks very much.\n\nCompletely off topic but just wondered about upgrading to iOS 8.3. I read a bunch of posts that the front camera quit working after upgrading so was a little concerned given you can't go back once you upgrade. I also only have a 4s so really don't get all of the features of 8.3 and wondered if it slowed down the phone given the older technology it has.\n\nDo you know if I do a complete backup of my phone before upgrading, if I was to upgrade, would doing a restore put me back to iOS 7 or does the backup only do your files?\n\nThanks again for your help\n\nThanks for the suggestion but did use the one below yours.\n\nJust for future reference if I backed mine up or synced it to iCloud would all I have to do to put them on my wife's be to log into my iCloud account with her iPhone and it would automatically sync or copy them to her iPhone? How do you keep it from backing up her contacts to iCloud and wiping out mine?\n\nSorry for the silly questions but have no experience with iCloud or using the sync capabilities.\n\nThanks\n\nI understand what you are saying but the majority of these posts were either right here or on other tech support forums, not in the bizzaro world somewhere, and often resetting the phone solved the problem but not in all cases. I also realize, as you say, when the upgrade goes fine, you don't hear from people but I don't know that there is really anything in iOS 8.3 that would benefit me other than many apps are optimizing them for 8.3. I also don't know if they slow the phone down due to the older technology/processor and if so I wouldn't bother upgrading.\n\nIf by chance a 4s runs better or faster on iOS 8, which occasionally does happen, then I would likely upgrade.\n\nI'm currently using iOS 7xx so thus the apprehension of upgrading when there is no way back. I have used computers long enough to know upgrades often add new features but also are optimized for the processor of the day, and although they still run on the older systems/phones, often there is performance loss and using the older devices, which were once enjoyed, now are very frustrating. I am happy with the 4s and it suits my needs just fine so don't want to spoil the experience but upgrading to something that will slow it down.\n\nOn the other hand occasionally the upgrade can improve the performance. Microsoft Vista was a poor OS and upgrading to Windows 7 improved the performance of my older laptop and made it much more enjoyable to use again.\n\nSergZak wrote:\n\njackdup777 wrote:\n\nThanks for the suggestion but did use the one below yours.\n\nJust for future reference if I backed mine up or synced it to iCloud would all I have to do to put them on my wife's be to log into my iCloud account with her iPhone and it would automatically sync or copy them to her iPhone?\n\nIf you use the same Apple ID for contacts, everything you do/change on one device will affect the other...unless you first sync the contacts, then sign out of that Apple ID or disable the syncing of contacts on one device (or even both).\n\nYou may be better off having them on different Apple IDs and using the manual method (using the app I suggested) and periodically backing up and merging the contacts. Personally, I don't trust having all my eggs in one basket (one Apple ID) and having everything in \"the cloud\"...I've been doing this stuff (PCs, electronics, gadgets, etc) since ~1980 so I'm set in the physical, tangible means of backing up and keeping my data safe. Others will of course disagree but do what you're personally comfortable with.\n\nI would not leave both phones with the same ID, would have just logged in with my wife's in order to transfer my contacts from iCloud to her phone and then would have gone back to her own ID.\n\nI understand the importance of backups but must say I find the process of backing up Apple products a little more involved or complicated. I have been doing this for a long time as well. I bought my first Apple II+ in 1981 and an Apple III in 1982, and in 1985 my first PC. I would have liked a hard drive for the Apple as I used it for a bookkeeping service but at $5,000 for a 5 MB it was out of my price range. I got a 10 MB in my PC in 1985 and it was $1,800, which was an amazingly good deal at the time. I would have loved a Mac back then but again was way out of my price range, plus the monitor was quite small and there were no programs for bookkeeping which was the main use I had at that time.\n\nI don't really have anything on either my iPhone or iPad that would really bother me if I lost it other than my pictures which I backup regularily to my PC as well as an external hard drive. I also use RAID-1 on my PC so if one drive fails I have a mirrored copy on the other. I was being lazy not wanting to retype all of my contacts onto my wife's phone, so using the app you suggested worked great.\n\nThanks again.\n\nSergZak wrote:\n\nI didn't realize you were still on iOS 7. If you don't need the compatibility to run iOS 8 apps, I would stay right where you are on iOS 7 until you eventually *do* require iOS 8 to run the apps you want.\n\nThanks, I'll probably do that. I don't have a lot of apps I use on a regular basis so will leave things as the are for now.\n\nSergZak wrote:\n\nI myself started with an Atari 800 (with a cassette drive at first) and an Apple IIe...with a Duo Disc drive...good times. ðŸ™‚\n\nI had a IIE as well and it was a big step up at that time anyway. I always had two disk drives as I needed one for the accounting software I used and one for the data disks. Back then 5 1/4 blank disks were $5.40 each. Later I took a IIC on trade for a PC and I actually still have it I the original boxes."
