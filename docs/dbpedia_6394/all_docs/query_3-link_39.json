        "text": "FILM NOIR DEFINITION\n\nWhat is film noir?\n\nFilm noir is a stylized genre of film marked by pessimism, fatalism, and cynicism. The term was originally used in France after WWII, to describe American thriller or detective films in the 1940s and 50s. Though, Hollywood’s film noir stretches back to the 1920s. Film noir literally translates to “black cinema” and French critics used it to describe Hollywood movies that were saturated with darkness and pessimism not seen before.\n\nIt’s hard to say if it's is a genre or style, and the elements of noir listed below do not all have to be present for the film to be considered noir. But they are extremely common with this style.\n\nNoir Genre\n\nFilm noir originated in a time of angst\n\nThis style of filmmaking was characterized by a painful time in history. Cynicism and pessimism from the Great Depression were ingrained in the American psyche. Then came WWII, which sent many men to the frontlines while many women took up the jobs in their absence.\n\nAfter the war, there was a period uncertainty. Men returned from the battlefield with trauma, and the world lost quite a bit of innocence. Upon their return, the theory goes, men found women had shifted their role substantially. Housewives had become workers themselves so there was a perceived disruption to the gender roles that had been in place for decades.\n\nIn response to this insecurity, film noir gives us tales of men being taken advantage of by powerful and sometimes sinister women. Again, this merely the theory about how and why film noir became such a prominent style/genre in the post-war period.\n\nThe truth is that many of the iconic film noir movies that Hollywood produced in the '40s were based on novels written in the '30s. So, it can be argued that WWII had nothing to do with the source material but that it might explain the popularity of the films made later.\n\nExamples from Cinema\n\nFilm noir examples\n\nWhat characterizes cynicism in cinema? Is it dialogue dripping with sarcasm and mordancy? Or is it simply the high contrast lighting in each scene. Notice the bleak feel of all three of these classic film noirs.\n\nThe Maltese Falcon (1941)\n\nStarring Humphrey Bogart, this mystery noir made a lasting impact with its spectacular cinematography and menacing use of shadows."
