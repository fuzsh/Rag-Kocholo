        "text": "What is a screenplay?\n\nA Screenplays are a creative and fun way for writers to bring their stories to life on the screen, allowing their audiences to engage in captivating narratives through the power of storytelling and compelling characters. To write a screenplay the writer should follow a guideline or format because “a screenplay is written in a specific format to distinguish between characters, action lines, and dialogue” (Provost).\n\n“The screenplay is the backbone of narrative filmmaking” says StudioBinder Inc. Screenplays serve as the foundation for a film, television show, or video game. It is a specialized form of writing that provides a detailed description of the story, including dialogue, actions, settings, and other elements necessary for the visual and auditory aspects of the production.\n\nScreenplay formats typically include elements such as scene headings, action descriptions, character names, dialogue, Parenthetical, transitions, and sometimes camera directions.\n\nThe goal of a screenplay is to convey the story in a way that is both engaging and practical for the filmmakers and actors involved in bringing it to life. “A screenplay is one of the most crucial aspects of any movie” (Fechter). The format allows for easy interpretation by the various members of a film or television production team, from the director to the cinematographer to the actors.\n\nAccording to Industrial Scripts, a well-known screenwriting company with solid connections to the film industry and full of positive feedback from its clients worldwide, started in 2010, a typical screenplay should be around 90 to 120 pages long. You might ask “But why?” Well, think of it like this: each page of a screenplay usually translates to about a minute of screen time. So, for a regular feature film lasting around 90 to 120 minutes, sticking to this page range helps keep the story well-paced, engaging and .\n\nWhere are screenplays originated from?\n\nAccording to Jeff Heimbuch a writer with a number of produced (and unproduced) screenplays and written over 200 episodes of television, George Méliès’ 1902 film “Le Voyage Dans La Lune” or “A Trip to the Moon” is often regarded as the pioneer of screenplays. Despite being a silent film with no dialogues, the screenplay supposedly contains action lines and specific descriptions that resemble a script format similar to what we use in modern filmmaking (Heimbuch). This early example is considered a significant step in the evolution of screenplay development in the history of cinema.\n\nWhat is a Psychological Thriller?\n\nA Psychological thriller is a subgenre of thrillers that explores the psychology of its characters. These stories often delve into the complexities of the human mind portraying characters facing internal struggles, emotional disorders, and psychological confusion.\n\nPsychological thrillers delve into various psychological themes such as paranoia, obsession, identity crises, and the darker aspects of human nature, creating a deeper exploration of the characters’ psyche and motivations.\n\nPsychological thriller sets itself apart by digging into the depths of the human mind, going where other thrillers don’t dare. “What sets a psychological thriller apart is its commitment to exploring the darkest corners of the human mind” (Dukes). Unlike other sub-genre of thrillers, it’s all about unraveling the very complicated workings of our psyche, adding a psychological touch to the suspenseful storytelling.\n\nPsychological thrillers gained popularity in the early 90s and continue to captivate audiences with their intense narratives and intricate character developments. However, The roots of the psychological thriller genre trace back to Gothic literature in the 18th-century, where the human psyche was a recurring theme. As the field of psychology developed, stories progressively delved further into characters’ minds.\n\nWilkie Collins being a key figure in the psychological sub-genre. Collins introduced groundbreaking narrative techniques that continue to shape the genre today. He ingeniously crafted novels where characters grappled with uncertainties about their own memories, introducing the concept of the ‘unreliable narrator.’\n\nIn Collins’ works, characters faced the unsettling possibility that they might be implicated in a crime, yet were uncertain due to the unreliability of their own recollections. This narrative innovation laid the foundation for the psychological thriller’s exploration of the human mind’s darker and more disturbing aspects.\n\nFast forward to the 19th century, Edgar Allan Poe further contributed to the genre by delving into the psychological intricacies of the human psyche. Poe’s exploration of the gruesome and the mysterious added another layer to the evolving landscape of psychological thrillers.\n\nToday, when we immerse ourselves in a gripping psychological thriller, we owe a debt to Wilkie Collins for his inventive storytelling techniques and to Edgar Allan Poe for his deep dive into the darker recesses of the human mind. Their contributions have left an unforgotten mark on the genre, influencing countless writers who continue to draw inspiration from the psychological complexities they unveiled.\n\nInspiring Famous Screenwriters and their Skills\n\nAlfred Hitchcock AKA the “Master of Suspense,” Hitchcock made significant contributions to the psychological thriller genre, a pioneer in psychological thrillers, he shaped the genre with his talent for building suspense. His clever use of unexpected plot twists, and skillful character development set a high standard. Hitchcock defined the essence of psychological tension by keeping his audience on the edge with intricate details and complex characters.\n\nDennis Lehane, is best known for one of his best works “Shutter Island.” He added depth to psychological thrillers by creating very complicated plots and exploring the human mind. Lehane is known for crafting morally complex characters and psychological stories that challenge common beliefs. His narratives delve into psychological trauma and the blurry lines between right and wrong, which captivate his audiences with compelling storytelling.\n\nGillian Flynn, celebrated for “Gone Girl,” brought a modern and realistic twist to psychological thrillers. Flynn’s strength lies in defying expectations, creating characters with questionable reliability, and surprising plot turns. She explores themes like manipulation, identity, delusions, and societal norms, urging audiences to question everything and make assumptions. “Ms. Flynn writes dark suspense novels that anatomize violence without splashing barrels of blood around the pages . . . Ms. Flynn has much more up her sleeve than a simple missing-person case. As Nick and Amy alternately tell their stories, marriage has never looked so menacing, narrators so unreliable.” (The Wall Street Journal). Flynn’s psychologically rich narratives and complex, flawed and unreliable characters have become a defining features of gripping psychological thrillers.\n\n5 Key Elements of a Gripping Psychological thriller.\n\nImagine stepping into a thrilling world of psychological thrillers — it’s like an exciting rollercoaster for your mind. These stories take you on wild rides, from characters losing their grip on reality to heart-pounding moments that make you question everything. As we dive into this genre, think of it as discovering the hidden secrets behind the scenes. There are special ingredients that turn a regular story into a gripping experience, making you stay glued to your seat. Join the adventure as I uncover these secrets, revealing what makes psychological thrillers so spine-tinglingly captivating.\n\n1. Complex and Flawed Character development\n\nCreate characters with intricate layers, where flaws link with strengths, creating a psychological depth that keeps your audience guessing their next move and questioning the very essence of their being.\n\nCreating complex and flawed characters is essential in developing compelling psychological thrillers as they add depth, relatability, and intrigue to your narrative.\n\n“There’s nothing that brings fiction to life like complex characters. To read them is a joy. But to write them… That can be a little trickier.” (The Novelry).\n\nHere are some steps to help you create and develop such characters:\n\nGain a deep understanding of human behavior, including the complexities of the human mind, emotions, and motivations. This understanding will help you create multidimensional characters that feel authentic and relatable to your audience.\n\nGive Them a Layered Personality by developing characters with multiple layers, including both positive and negative traits. Show the internal conflicts within their minds, their fears, desires, and the struggles they face in their lives. This complexity will make them more believable and engaging.\n\nEstablish a Compelling Backstory by creating a rich backstory for each character, including their past experiences, traumas, and significant life events that have shaped their personalities. Use this backstory to explain their current behaviors, motivations, and decisions.\n\nIntroduce flaws and vulnerabilities in your characters that make them more human and relatable. These imperfections could include insecurities, weaknesses, or past mistakes that haunt them. Such flaws can be pivotal in driving the plot and creating tension within the story.\n\nBlur the lines between right and wrong by giving your characters ambiguous moral values. Let them make questionable decisions and face moral dilemmas, making it challenging for the audience to categorize them as purely good or evil.\n\nEmphasize Struggles by highlighting the internal struggles and psychological conflicts your characters experience. Show their inner battles, such as grappling with guilt, paranoia, or conflicting desires, which can add depth to their personalities and drive the narrative forward.\n\nDevelop intricate relationships between characters, filled with dynamics of love, hate, jealousy, and betrayal. These relationships should be authentic and should reveal more about the characters’ personalities, motivations, and vulnerabilities.\n\nAllow your characters to undergo significant transformations throughout the story. Let them evolve, learn from their experiences, and confront their inner demons, leading to personal growth or downfall.\n\nEnter “The Girl on the Train” a tale around three women including Megan, Anna, and Rachel, the unconventional protagonist crafted by Paula Hawkins. She’s no ordinary commuter, she’s battling alcoholism, unemployment, and the lingering shadows of a violent history with her ex-husband. Rachel’s train journeys serve as a cover for her joblessness and an inability to contribute to rent.\n\nBut don’t be quick to dismiss her. Rachel, despite her flaws, surprises with astute observations and a gripping narrative that captures the essence of everyday events during her train rides. In this psychological thriller, appearances are deceiving, and Rachel’s narrative keeps you hooked.\n\nGirl on the train (trailer)\n\n2. Atmosphere and Setting that promotes emotions.\n\nThere are several ways to manage atmosphere in your screenplay, but the most common ones are physical location or space, emotional and mental state, and careful timing, also referred to as the rhythm or pacing of your story (“4 Ways to Create Atmosphere in Your Screenplay”).\n\nImmerse your audience in a setting that breathes with emotion, where every corner resonates with the characters’ internal struggles. You can also turn the setting into a psychological playground where your audience must solve its mysteries.\n\nEngage the audience’s senses by incorporating vivid sensory details that resonate with the emotional undertones of the scene. Describe not only what the characters see but also what they hear, smell, and feel. This immersive approach helps the audience experience the setting on a deeper level, connecting them emotionally to the characters’ internal struggles.\n\nUse concise yet expressive language to convey the atmosphere, whether it’s a moment of suspense, fear, tranquility or beauty, the audience should feel the emotional ambiance from the very beginning, creating a more immersive experience. As used Shutter Island a movie based on a novel by Dennis Lehane.\n\nScript in action (Shutter Island)\n\nThis technique not only sets the mood and differentiates scenes but also serves as a foreshadowing tool, ensuring each moment resonates with the intended emotional impact, contributing to the overall suspense and psychological depth of the narrative.\n\n3. Descriptive Action Lines AND Dialogues.\n\nWrite the story with explosive action lines, where descriptive language ignites the scenes with sensory fireworks, plunging the audience into a thrilling whirlwind of sights, sounds, and emotions.\n\nSpec scripts emphasizes the importance of being brilliantly descriptive while maintaining conciseness in screenwriting. “Be brilliantly descriptive, but avoid being long winded. Keep your descriptions concise and don’t add details that aren’t pertinent to the story” (Folden).\n\nAs seen in the screenplay above, you can already paint a vivid picture, letting you imagine the character’s looks, actions, and feelings without needing visuals. It’s like a cinematic magic trick where words on a page bring the story to life. Descriptive action lines are the secret sauce that turns a screenplay into a thrilling experience. As McKenzie puts it “well written action lines are vital to the success of your screenplay,” making you feel every moment as if you’re right there in the scene. It’s the art of storytelling that goes beyond just visuals.\n\nDialogue is like the most crucial part in a psychological thriller screenplay, stirring up emotions and building up the suspense. For instance take a peek at “Gone Girl” — when Amy said, “I’ve killed for you, who else could say that?” Amy’s chilling statement can sends shivers down your spine. Then comes her possessive declaration, “You think you’d be be happy with a nice Midwestern girl. No way, baby, I’m It.” You can practically feel the tension. But Nick, when he said “You’re delusional”, this adds another twist to the scene. It’s like a verbal rollercoaster, making the audience question reality and their psych, keeping the story thrilling and engaging.\n\nThe director, David Fincher plays with dialogue and timing, but the essence of the message is still the same.\n\nRoss Van Leeve, emphasizes the art of choosing the right moment to deliver important lines in dialogue. He writes, “Use “Timing” within dialogue creates suspense by either withholding or slightly delaying character or plot driven dialogue…” By strategically holding back or slightly delaying these lines, writers can build suspense and make scenes more memorable. The goal is to create a sense of reality in the audience’s experience, sparking discussions about the authenticity of the characters and their interactions.\n\nScript in Action (Gone Girl)\n\n4. Psychological Plot Unraveling in Heart-Stopping Suspense.\n\nA psychological thriller needs to have a dynamic world where the plot must be artfully unraveled with heart-stopping tension. It is the narrative’s lifeblood, drawing the audience in and making them clutch to the edge of doubt. The plot’s incessant turns and discoveries keep the audience’s interest at fever pitch, turning them from passive viewers into active players in the characters’ complex shadow dance.\n\nTo drawing the audience into a maze of feelings, the heart-pounding tension creates an unbreakable tie between them — a shared pulse that echoes the continuous search for psychological truths. It is the core of cinematic immersion, a thrilling journey through the deepest corners of the human brain that permanently alters the narrative’s essence.\n\nCreate a complex web of deception in which mysteries are revealed with every turn. Make the audience wonder about the characters’ behavior as well as the nature of reality itself, building suspense with each new development in the psychological tapestry.\n\nHandle the story as if it were a work of art, precisely timing the moments of discovery. A buildup of tension should be used to build anticipation, mixed with shocking realizations that leave the audience in astonishment and eager for the next jaw-dropping plot. “Curiosity is evoked by presenting the final outcome of the story first.” says Ken Miyamoto.\n\nPlay the exciting game of character roulette, where the value of trust is high. Present characters whose motivations are unreadable and whose allegiances are ambiguous, so that the audience is left wondering who to believe. The tension is maintained as a high-stakes psychological game by the constantly changing dynamics.\n\nScript in action.\n\n5. A mind-blowing ending, shrouded in ambiguity.\n\nIn the heart-pounding world of a psychological thriller, imagine the ending like a fireworks finale — mind-blowing and wrapped in mystery. It’s not just the closing scene; it’s like a carefully planned explosion that sends the whole story soaring to new heights.\n\n“Don’t you just love epic film endings that you never saw coming? These endings are the ones that stay with viewers for a long time and inspire talk about the movie” (NYFA). Think of it as the grand finale in a dazzling show, leaving a lasting impression on everyone watching. This mysterious ending isn’t a clear-cut conclusion; it’s a thrilling puzzle that invites the audience to interpret and speculate. It’s like a rollercoaster ride for your mind, where each unexpected turn gives you an adrenaline rush. This mind-blowing finale isn’t just the end; it’s a spectacular finish that leaves you thinking long after the lights go out.\n\nFor example: In the heart-pounding Netflix psychological horror-thriller “Run Rabbit Run,” directed by Daina Reid and crafted by the talented Hannah Kent, the story revolves around Sarah, a fertility doctor, and her daughter Mia. As Mia’s behavior takes a strange turn, unraveling the buried secrets of Sarah’s haunted past. The shadows of guilt loom large. When Sarah’s sister (Alice) was just seven, she went missing, and now, as Mia (Sarah’s daughter) turns the same age, things get seriously weird. Mia insisting on being called Alice? That’s the first clue to a bigger mystery. The movie is like a skilled storyteller weaving guilt, paranoia, and tricky relationships into a suspenseful web. And the ending left us wanting more.\n\nThe Ending of “Gone Girl” also falls under the category of leaving the audience with unanswered questions, adding a layer of excitement. Why does Nick choose to keep quiet about Amy’s actions? What’s next for them? Nick’s final question, “What will we do?” hints at a mysterious plan, keeping the audience on the edge, eagerly anticipating the untold twists ahead."
