        "text": "OMG, just how many 1980s movies are getting a sequel or remake? It seem like every other day I learn about another. Let’s go down the list.\n\nTime Bandits (TV Series)\n\nRelease Date: July 24, 2024 (10 episodes)\n\nThis I have to see. Taika Waititi is directing and Lisa Kudrow plays Penelope.\n\n——Content continues below——\n\nBeverly Hills Cop: Axel F\n\nRelease Date: July 3rd (Netflix)\n\nThey really brought back the gang: we have Judge Reinhold, John Ashton, Bronson Pinchot, and Paul Reiser back from the originals, plus Kevin Bacon and Joseph Gordon-Levitt as new characters.\n\nWill I watch it? Of course.\n\nWill it be any good? Doubtful.\n\nDo I care? Not so much.\n\nIt’s a good occasion to rewatch the original.\n\nThe Crow\n\nRelease Date: August 23rd, 2024\n\nJust remaster the original and release that. There’s no way they do better.\n\nDon’t get me wrong, I think Bill Skarsgård is a fabulous actor, but these are some big shows to fill. The loss of Brandon Lee during production of The Crow 1994 was a tremendous loss. He was destined to become a Hollywood A-lister. Who knows how dramatically movies would have been reshaped had he been around.\n\nBeetlejuice Beetlejuice\n\nRelease Date: September 6th, 2024\n\nThe Naked Gun\n\nRelease Date: July 18, 2025\n\nThis movie has quite the cast: Liam Neeson as Frank Drebin Jr., Kevin Durand, Pamela Anderson, Danny Huston, Busta Rhymes, Paul Walter Hauser, et al. I’m really looking forward to seeing Liam in a comedic role.\n\nMasters of the Universe\n\nRelease Date: June 5th, 2026\n\nThis is one of the few animated movies on the list.\n\nHighlander (Reboot)\n\nRelease Date: TBD, expected in 2026\n\nWhat we do know is that Henry Cavill plays the lead role. Whether that character is Connor MacLeod of the clan MacLeod or some other is still under wraps. Chad Stahelski is directing. Stahelski directed all of the John Wick movies, so John Wick with swords? Sign me up!\n\nBy the way, if they don’t at least use remixes of the original soundtrack by Queen then heads will roll!\n\nFlight of the Navigator\n\nRelease Date: TBD\n\nAll that is known is that Bryce Dallas Howard is directing, and maybe there’s a gender swap for the main character, David. There have been previous attempts to bring this movie back, so don’t hold your breath.\n\nBig Trouble in Little China\n\nRelease Date: TBD (in production)\n\nThe only thing really known at this time is Dwayne Johnson is set to play the lead role and we have two writers back from the original. This is one of those movies that I really loved back in the 1980s. Even back then it flew under the radar. There’s on chance of that happening again with Dwayne Johnson staring in it. I don’t know if it will be any good, but it won’t go unnoticed.\n\nThe Roses\n\nRelease Date: TDB (pre-production)\n\nI think this is a remake of the original War of the Roses, which was a fabulously funny movie. (I’ll just be in here pissing on the fish.) Benedict Cumberbatch and Olivia Colman are cast in the lead roles.\n\nShort Circuit\n\nRelease Date: TBD\n\nThere was a flurry of news about this back in 2020 and pretty much crickets since then. So maybe? All that is really know, or perhaps more accurately, all that is suspected is that the cast will have a Latinx bend.\n\nAn American Werewolf in London\n\nRelease Date: TBD\n\nThere hasn’t been much news on this recently, however, IMDb does currently list this movie as in development. The only solid news I found is that Max Landis is directing, the son of John Landis, who directed the original. It’s not often that a son gets to remake his father’s movie. There could be some interesting behind-the-scenes conversation.\n\nGuns 3: Dead or Alive\n\nRelease Date: TBD\n\nThere’s not much known other than Emilio Esteves is writing and directing and we have Christian Slater and Lou Diamond Phillips in the cast. The latest news I could find was an interview in 2023 with Lou Diamond Phillips who said the project is in limbo but not dead.\n\nWarGames\n\nRelease Date: TBD\n\nIt has an IMDb page, but there’s no writer, producer, or director. I think this is something that could be problematic to make because of the rapid developments in AI. They may build a fictional AI for the movie that by the time the movie is released there’s an online AI that is better and for free."
