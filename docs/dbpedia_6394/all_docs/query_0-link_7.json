        "text": "Share this Article:\n\nThe latest Film Stories Podcast takes in two Kevin Costner corkers: No Way Out (1987) and Bull Durham (1988). It’s a Kevin Costner double bill in the latest episode of the Film Stories podcast – and whilst the films are very different, there is a link between them. 1987’s No Way Out is actually a remake, something its director – Roger Donaldson – wasn’t actually aware of. One of the very best thrillers of the 1980s – especially if you don’t know its twists and turns – its release actually ended up being held back to see if another Costner-headlined movie would prove more successful first. Yet it was the ultimate success of No Way Out that finally led to Bull Durham getting off the ground, after a hell of a challenge to raise the money for the movie. It was far from the only challenge, either: an executive at Orion Pictures was causing problems, and there was a casting demand that wasn’t going away… Both films are covered in this episode. Both films are also making their UK Blu-ray debut this month, and you can find details on the releases at store.filmstories.co.uk — Thank you for visiting!
