        "text": "It might seem counterintuitive that many of the most famous movie quotes are also the most misquoted onesâbut the more people say something, the more chances there are for it to get bungled. And sometimes, the bungled version ends up supplanting the actual quote practically everywhere except in the original source.\n\nRead on to find out which iconic lines weâve been getting wrong for decades, from Casablancaâs âPlay it again, Samâ to The Silence of the Lambsâs âHello, Clarice.â\n\n1. âIt was beauty that killed the beast.â // King Kong (1933)\n\nActual quote: âIt was beauty killed the beast.â\n\nItâs probably our modern grammar sensibilities that cause us to add a that to this King Kong quote, but Carl Denham (Robert Armstrong) didnât. When a police lieutenant tells him that âthe airplanes gotâ King Kong, Denham corrects him: âOh, no, it wasnât the airplanes. It was beauty killed the beast.â\n\n2. âMirror, mirror, on the wall, whoâs the fairest of them all?â // Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937)\n\nActual quote: âMagic mirror on the wall, who is the fairest one of all?â\n\nThe jealous queenâs queries to her magic mirror are a regular occurrence throughout Snow White and Seven Dwarfs, yet many viewers managed to miss what she actually asks that piece of glass. To be fair, our collective memory of the movie might have gotten muddled by the different versions of the rhyme in various translations of the Grimm brothersâ story.\n\nItâs been rendered as âLooking-glass upon the wall, who is fairest of us all?â, for example, and âMirror, mirror, on the wall, who in this land is fairest of all?â Disney itself even used âMirror, mirrorâ in a 1980s hardcover book.\n\n3. âFrankly, Scarlett, I donât give a damn.â // Gone with the Wind (1939)\n\nActual quote: âFrankly, my dear, I donât give a damn.â\n\nRhett Butler (Clark Gable) says this to Scarlett OâHara (Vivien Leigh) in response to her panicked questionsââWhere shall I go? What shall I do?ââas heâs leaving her. He doesnât call her by name here in the film or in the book.\n\n4. âPlay it again, Sam.â // Casablanca (1942)\n\nActual quote: âPlay it, Sam. Play âAs Time Goes By.ââ\n\nIngrid Bergmanâs Ilsa Lund never asks Sam, the pianist played by Dooley Wilson, to âplay it again.â She says, âPlay it once, Sam, for old timeâs sake.â Then, after he feigns confusion, she clarifies: âPlay it, Sam. Play âAs Time Goes By.ââ\n\nThe misquote is so prevalent that Woody Allen even borrowed it verbatim for the title of his 1969 stage play, which he adapted for the big screen a few years later.\n\n5. âBadges? We donât need no stinkinâ badges!â // The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (1948)\n\nActual quote: âBadges? We ainât got no badges! We donât need no badges! I donât have to show you any stinkinâ badges!â\n\nWhen Gold Hat (Alfonso Bedoya) claims that he and his cohort are mounted police, Dobbs (Humphrey Bogart) asks where their badges are. Gold Hatâs response is a little longer than what most people remember, but thatâs not for no reason: The abridged version was immortalized in 1974âs Blazing Saddles and in a 1967 episode of The Monkees.\n\n6. âIâm ready for my close-up, Mr. DeMille.â // Sunset Boulevard (1950)\n\nActual quote: âAll right, Mr. DeMille. Iâm ready for my close-up.â\n\nPeople donât bungle Norma Desmondâs (Gloria Swanson) most iconic line too badly, but the call-out to director Cecil B. DeMille (who plays himself in the film) technically comes before the rest of the quote. (In the stage musical, the line is âAnd now, Mr. DeMille, Iâm ready for my close-up.)\n\n7. âFasten your seat belts. Itâs going to be a bumpy ride.â // All About Eve (1950)\n\nActual quote: âFasten your seat belts. Itâs going to be a bumpy night.â\n\nIt wouldâve made sense for Bette Davisâs Margo Channing to follow up her seat belt directive with a warning about a bumpy ride. But she doesnât do thatâshe says ânight,â instead. (For what itâs worth, sheâs talking about a party, not a trip.) The line âItâs going to be a bumpy rideâ has been uttered elsewhere, including in 2004âs Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban.\n\n8. âA manâs gotta do what a manâs gotta do.â // Hondo (1953)\n\nActual quote: âA man ought to do what he thinks is best.â\n\nThe axiom A manâs gotta do what a manâs gotta do has appeared in plenty of places, none of them a John Wayne movie. What his eponymous character says in Hondo is admittedly a little less catchy, but still iconic when you know the context: Hondo has just refused to tell his dog to move out of another manâs way, to which the man says, âIâll be hanged if I go out of my way for any cur dog.â Hondo, rifle in hand, ends the discussion with âA man ought to do what he thinks is best.â\n\nAnother misconception is that the quote is from the Alan Laddâstarring Shane (1953). Viewers may have conflated two lines from the film: Joe Starrettâs (Van Heflin) âI couldnât do what I gotta do if I hadnât always knowed that I could trust yaâ and Shaneâs âA man has to be what he is.â\n\n9. âMrs. Robinson, are you trying to seduce me?â // The Graduate (1967)\n\nActual quote: âMrs. Robinson, youâre trying to seduce me. Arenât you?â\n\nThe delivery of this line in The Graduate has more nuance than the misquote affords it. Dustin Hoffmanâs Benjamin Braddock avers, with a good-natured shake of his head, that Mrs. Robinson (Anne Bancroft) is trying to seduce himâbut when she starts laughing, he immediately loses all confidence and follows it up with an uneasy âArenât you?â\n\n10. âPlease, sir, can I have some more?â // Oliver! (1968)\n\nActual quote: âPlease, sir, I want some more.â\n\nNot only does poor, starving Oliver not ask the workhouse master if he may have more gruelâhe doesnât ask at all. âPlease sir, I want some more,â he says in Charles Dickensâs original novel and every major film adaptation of it: 1933âs, 1948âs, 2005âs, and 1968âs musical version, Oliver!\n\n11. âDo you feel lucky, punk?â // Dirty Harry (1971)\n\nActual quote: âYouâve got to ask yourself one question: âDo I feel lucky?â Well, do ya, punk?â\n\nClint Eastwoodâs Harry Callahan isnât too concerned with brevity when he delivers this speech to a robber heâs holding at gunpoint. But weâve all subconsciously edited it down for the sake of a good catchphrase. (Except for Jim Carreyâs The Mask character, who repeats the original quote in full, though he slightly botches the beginning).\n\n12. âWeâre gonna need a bigger boat.â // Jaws (1975)\n\nActual quote: âYouâre gonna need a bigger boat.â\n\nEven the most rabid Jaws fan might be guilty of mishearing this line, in part because Brody (Roy Scheider) has a cigarette hanging out of his mouth when he says it.\n\n13. âIâm mad as hell, and Iâm not gonna take it anymore!â // Network (1976)\n\nActual quote: âIâm as mad as hell and Iâm not going to take this anymore!â\n\nItâs no mystery why we often donât get the wording of Howard Bealeâs (Peter Finch) impassioned on-air outburst exactly right: When other people shout it from their windows in the film, not all of them get the wording exactly right.\n\n14. âIâm out of order? Youâre out of order! This whole courtâs out of order!â // â¦ And Justice for All (1979)\n\nActual quote: âYouâre out of order! Youâre out of order! The whole trial is out of order! Theyâre out of order!â\n\nSpeaking of movie outbursts, there isnât a YouTube compilation titled âAl Pacino losing his shitâ for nothing. Pacinoâs reaction to the judgeâs âMr. Kirkland, you are out of orderâ in â¦ And Justice for All ranks among the most memorable, but itâs a little less smoothly worded than you might think.\n\nItâs also not the only time Pacino has played a lawyer who reacts to being told heâs out of order in a courtroom. In Scent of a Woman, he replies with âOutta order? Iâll show you outta order! You donât know what outta order is, Mr. Trask.â\n\n15. âLuke, I am your father.â // The Empire Strikes Back (1980)\n\nActual quote: âNo, I am your father.â\n\nThe Empire Strikes Backâs most famous line is so widely misremembered that itâs become a popular example of the Mandela effect: a shared false memory. âLuke, I am your fatherâ works great as a standalone quote, but âNo, I am your fatherâ makes more sense in context. âObi-Wan never told you what happened to your father,â Darth Vader says, and after Luke answers, âHe told me enoughâhe told me you killed him,â Vader sets the record straight.\n\n16. âBeam me up, Scotty.â // Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home (1986)\n\nActual quote: âScotty, beam me up.â\n\nShockingly, the exact phrasing âBeam me up, Scottyâ has never appeared in the Star Trek canon, though countless variationsâincluding âBeam us up, Mr. Scott,â âScotty, beam us up fast,â and simply âBeam me upââhave. The closest weâve gotten is when William Shatnerâs James T. Kirk says âScotty, beam me upâ in the 1986 film Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home.\n\n17. âIf you build it, they will come.â // Field of Dreams (1989)\n\nActual quote: âIf you build it, he will come.â\n\nThough Kevin Costnerâs Field of Dreams brings all sorts of legendary ballplayers to his yard, the voice that tells him to build the field only promises a single personâsame as it is in W.P. Kinsellaâs Shoeless Joe, the novel that inspired the film. (James Earl Jonesâs character does say âPeople will comeâ several times in his famous baseball monologue, which might contribute to the confusion.)\n\n18. âHello, Clarice.â // The Silence of the Lambs (1991)\n\nActual quote: âGood morning.â\n\nHannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins) does greet Clarice (Jodie Foster) in The Silence of the Lambs, but not with a hello. The first time they meet, he just says âGood morning.â Though Lecter does frequently address her by name during their conversations, thereâs a more compelling reason so many people think he utters âHello, Clariceâ in as many wordsâbecause he does so in the 2001 sequel, Hannibal.Â\n\nâIs this Clarice?â Lecter says over the phone, and then, after a beat of silence, âWell, hello, Clarice.â The clip appeared in the trailer, so even people who didnât watch Hannibal in full mightâve heard the quote before another movie.\n\n19. âLife is like a box of chocolates. You never know what youâre gonna get.â // Forrest Gump (1994)\n\nActual quote: âMy momma always said life was like a box of chocolates. You never know what youâre gonna get.â\n\nThe simile doesnât get lost in the misquote, but some of the context does. Forrest Gump (Tom Hanks) is reiterating something his mother used to say, and he uses wasânot isâto keep it in the past. We also get to hear Mrs. Gump (Sally Field) utter the adage herself in the movie, but she adds a direct address in the middle of it: âLife is like a box of chocolates, Forrest. You never know what you're gonna get.â\n\n20. âIâm king of the world!â // Titanic (1997)Â\n\nActual quote: âIâm the king of the world!â\n\nA true Titanic super fan would never forget the first the in Jackâs (Leonardo DiCaprio) gleeful cry from the bow of the ship. Neither did director James Cameron when he memorably repeated the line in his speech after winning the Best Director Oscar in 1998.\n\nA version of this story was published in 2018; it has been updated for 2023."
