        "text": "1. Conventions of a thriller\n\n2. What is a thriller? • Thriller is a genre of literature, film, and television programming that uses suspense, tension, and excitement as its main elements. • Thrillers heavily stimulate the viewer's moods, giving them heightened feelings of suspense, excitement, surprise, anticipation and anxiety. • Thrillers generally keep the audience on the \"edge of their seats\" as the plot builds towards a climax. • Common elements in dramatic and psychological thrillers include plot twists, psychology, obsession and mind games.\n\n3. Key conventions of thrillers • Low key lighting • Tense, slow music • Black and white • Shadows • Breathing • Darkness • Fast paced editing • Urban settings • Weapons • Cars\n\n4. Characters • Characters may include criminals, stalkers, assassins, innocent victims (often on the run), menaced women, psychotic individuals, spree killers, sociopaths, agents, terrorists, cops and escaped cons, private eyes, people involved in twisted relationships, world-weary men and women, psycho-fiends, and more. • Often the key characters are unaware that something bad is happening to them, or they are involved in danger. • Common characters included are soldiers, criminals, stalkers, prison inmates and innocent civilians that get into danger. • Thriller characters can be found to have darker or sinister motives than others, they usually have been trapped in a situation and might feel they have hit rock bottom.\n\n5. Themes • The audience is made to feel like the plot could actually happen to them, scaring them. • A thriller keeps the audience in constant suspense. Like something bad could happen at any point. • Key themes often include romantic triangles, terrorism or pursuits. • Thrillers often include an atmosphere of menace and sudden violence, such as crime and murder, characterize thrillers. The tension usually arises when the character(s) is placed in a dangerous situation, or a trap from which escaping seems impossible. Life is threatened, usually because the principal character is unsuspectingly or unknowingly involved in a dangerous or potentially deadly situation. • Can sometimes centre on injustice in society but usually solves these things.\n\n6. Editing and camera shots • Often includes jump cuts to show suspense. • Editing conventions within the thriller genre are often focussed around creating an uncomfortable or suspenseful atmosphere as quick cuts and changing camera angles are often used which disorientates the spectator and creates an on screen tension. • Close ups are used, can often show that that particular characters may be dangerous, even if the other characters don’t know this. • A quick succession of fast-paced short clips will disorient an audience. Quick cutting with fast moving clips creates a pace in which the audience starts to believe that everything on screen is being performed in haste and they feel a sense of urgency.\n\n7. Sound • Diegetic and non diegetic sound is key for any thriller, non diegetic sound can give the audience a sense that something is happening that the characters in the film don’t know about. • Music can often hint at the mood or feelings of the characters, or that something significant is going to happen in the film. • Sound can start off slow when nothing much is happening in the film for example, and then the music may get faster to show something bad is about to happen. • High pitched sound is often used as it makes the spectator uncomfortable and shows how the scene might not be pleasant or something unexpected might happen."
