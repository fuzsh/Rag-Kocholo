        "text": "The slasher movie sub-genre could be considered one of the most controversial sub-genres in cinema. With its stark violence, it’s often the subject of discussions around the effect of slasher films on society at large.\n\nThese films burrow into our deepest fears and take hold of the wider imagination. They provide some of cinema’s most iconic moments and some of its most terrifying. And they hold a unique place in their ability to scare and shock.\n\nBut how do you write a slasher film? What are the key elements of this notable and unique sub-genre? All slasher films share commonalities and often follow a specific set of rules. In this article, we will focus on the slasher sub-genre as a whole and look at the best way into writing this often controversial but gripping genre.\n\n*This article may contain spoilers.\n\nWhat is a Slasher Movie?\n\nA slasher movie is a horror sub-genre that involves the murdering of a number of people by a psychopathic killer, typically via a knife or bladed tool (such as a scythe).\n\nIn general, the horror genre is known for its fear, violence and terror. It will typically feature a menacing villain, whether it be a monster or a supernatural evil spirit, for example.\n\nBut a slasher movie specifically can prey on audiences’ most palpable fears. It boils down the horror genre to simple terms – a crazed killer with a crude weapon on the hunt for blood.\n\nIn general, horror intends to leave the audience in a state of unease and trepidation. The genre branches into many different categories. For example, the main sub-genres of the horror genre, along with slashers, include:\n\nPsychological Horror – Phobias and home invasions e.g. The Purge.\n\nParanormal Horror – Supernatural possession e.g. The Haunting in Connecticut.\n\nComedy Horror – Black comedy and satire e.g. Get Out.\n\nMonster Horror – Zombies, mythological creatures, vampires and werewolves e.g. Dawn of the Dead.\n\nFound Footage – Documentary-style e.g. The Blair Witch Project.\n\nBody Horror – Body Modifications e.g. American Mary.\n\nHorror movies usually fit into hybrid genres. For example, the Saw franchise can be seen as a slasher-mystery. And most slasher films that feature a masked killer often involve the theme of mystery; where neither the characters nor the audience know the killer’s identity and it’s either kept a mystery or is revealed by the finale.\n\nWhilst there are a number of overlaps between the different horror sub-genres, the slasher movie will contain a number of key and specific elements. Let’s look at what those elements are…\n\n13 Key Elements of Slasher Movies\n\n1. A Psychopathic Killer\n\nThe villain is strong and feels impossible to defeat. They will get knocked down and get back up like nothing happened, seeming often to be indestructible.\n\nVillains are often serial killers or mass murderers out to exact revenge upon their prey. They stalk their victims and find pleasure in murdering. Villains often wear masks that characterise them, for example, the Ghostface mask in the Scream franchise.\n\nThere often doesn’t seem to be much of a rhyme or reason to the killer’s motivations. Often it will just seemingly be a straightforward bloodlust. And sometimes the pure terror they evoke can be enough to make up for slightly two-dimensional or cartoonish characterisation.\n\nHowever, the more convincing their motivations, the more believable and consequently terrifying their actions.\n\n2. Killer’s Backstory Revealed\n\nOften slasher movies will show how the villain developed into such a monstrous and destructive force. The more realistic this is the more terrifying it’s likely to be.\n\nFor example, the classic opening of Halloween shows how Michael Myers developed his notorious bloodlust at the age of six.\n\nWhile other films, such as Friday the 13th, show the villain’s backstory later on in the film. Here it’s revealed that Jason Vorhees was subjected to bullying from campers that ultimately led to his drowning.\n\nSometimes the killer may have a connection with the main character. For example, Ghostface and Sidney Prescott have a close connection in Scream that ties them to each other both in the present and past.\n\nThe motivation is often revenge. However, the more complex and nuanced a backstory the more intriguing and original it will become. Revenge is always a powerful motivator. But a more original and believable one is likely to make your story stand out from many other films within the genre.\n\n3. Setting & Location\n\nThis could be a cabin in the middle of the woods like Camp Crystal Lake in Friday the 13th. Or it could be a stranded desert like in The Hills Have Eyes.\n\nThe setting will often be a creepy and eerie location where the characters cannot find help or be rescued. However, this isn’t always the case.\n\nHalloween, for example, is set in a suburban area where help could be found. Although, the town is quiet and no one seems to come to Laurie’s aid when she knocks on neighbours’ doors. And in many ways, this makes the setting purposeful.\n\nThis is the key, allowing the setting to act as an element that furthers the horror. Make sure your setting isn’t incidental but purposeful in what it adds to the story and its tone as well as the plot itself.\n\n4. Set A Time\n\nThe antagonist‘s killing spree often takes place over one day or night. Most slasher films are set during the night-time because it adds an extra layer of mystery and tension. Although, for example, a good proportion of Halloween is set during the day, Michael Myers only murders during the night.\n\nThe timeframe of the sequence of events is important, as it plays a crucial role in the pacing and tension of the film at large. Typically slasher films will occur over a short timeframe for this reason. The pace has little chance to let up over the course of a night or one day, for example.\n\n5. Weapon of Choice\n\nThe antagonist equips themselves with a weapon of choice that is synonymous with their character. Slasher movies have used a variation of weapons, some of which become iconic.\n\nFor example, Leatherface uses a chainsaw in The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Whilst Harry Warden uses a pickaxe in My Bloody Valentine.\n\nA distinctive weapon of choice helps in making the character themselves distinctive. It gives a shorthand for the film to use and helps the character feel unique where other elements might be more familiar.\n\n6. Multiple Victims\n\nThe majority of victims in slasher movies are teenagers. The situations they place themselves in might include parties, vacations or trips. Slasher films have these big distractions to place the characters in more extreme danger. These scenarios gather characters together, making perfect prey for the killer.\n\nAnd this is why the main characters are often teenagers. There is shorthand here for group vulnerability. Teenagers are both more likely to be spending time together in a group and more likely to be vulnerable as a result. The killer often exploits (knowingly or unknowingly) the fragile dynamics between the different group members.\n\nThere need to be these multiple victims as there has to be an escalating level of threat. Typically there will be a main protagonist. And the killer will get closer and closer to the protagonist with each character they kill off. This is the benefit of multiple victims – it’s a way of continually escalating the stakes.\n\n7. Characters Split Up\n\nWhen there is this group, it must be split up at a certain point. The group separates, which makes them easy targets for the killer. There is too much strength in numbers after all.\n\nFurthermore, the characters will be killed off one by one, rather than together (even if it’s just two characters together). This allows each character to get their own unique and special kind of death. And this helps the movie’s pacing, giving it clear and memorable beats.\n\nA group facing off against a killer together will probably be too singular to remain interesting for the period of an entire film. Therefore, the group, and consequently the plot, must splinter. This allows the story to veer off in different directions, giving it a variety.\n\nEventually, these strands will tie together via the protagonist. Usually, there will be nowhere left for the plot to turn other than to the protagonist (as everyone else is dead).\n\n8. Stranded Signals\n\nCommunication is often disabled or non-existent in slasher movies. The characters are placed in a trap and they aren’t supposed to receive outside help. Mobile phones and communication do not work or are cut off by the killer.\n\nWhere the characters are, they might have a low phone battery or poor to little signal, for example. This cuts off the characters’ communication with the rest of the world so they have to face the villain alone. It adds necessary complications to the action. If the characters could call for help to turn up in an instant, for example, then the film would likely be over.\n\nIsolating the characters with the killer heightens and focuses the tension. It makes the characters vulnerable and bolsters the threat posed by the killer.\n\n9. Jump Scares\n\nJump scares are all about luring and reeling the audience in. The environment feels safe and unassuming. Until the characters are trapped in a corner and the killer is in the shadows waiting to pounce.\n\nJump scares vary in their use.\n\nFor example, the jump scare might often be obvious and the characters are set up for it.\n\nHowever, nothing happens and it’s a fake jump scare.\n\nUntil then, a few moments later, the killer jumps out and attacks them.\n\nThis tricks and shocks the audience further and can evoke real fear and terror.\n\nThe jump scare may be somewhat of a cliche. However, it’s very effective at raising the audience’s heart rate. It’s a literal, physical jolt. And this is the power of horror in general. It makes you feel something you are seeing on screen in your physical body.\n\nA cheap jump scare will likely fall flat. But the right jump scare at the right moment can be a great way to get the audience emotionally invested. It sounds obvious but your jump scare should come when the audience will least expect it. This doesn’t mean it can’t be built up to. But it needs to truly surprise the audience, either in its timing or its nature.\n\n10. Illogical Thinking\n\nCharacters don’t think logically when in a state of turmoil and shock. At high tension points, characters slow down and their ways of thinking become drastically illogical.\n\nThey make decisions that trap themselves into dead ends. This forces them to battle rather than flee. And they go head to head with the villain. Most victims in these situations do not survive.\n\nThis is a key way of heightening the tension. Whilst we’re (mostly) on the victims’ side, their actions should become alien to us. This proves the stress of the circumstances.\n\nThe characters are buckling under the pressure of the situation and we genuinely question whether they will make it out or not. It places the upper hand with the antagonist, which is inherently terrifying.\n\n11. The Killer Resurrects\n\nThe characters believe they have killed the antagonist once and for all. This is until the villain resurrects for one last scare. This is an important moment in conveying believable pacing and stakes. We have to believe that our protagonist might prevail. However, it’s never going to be that easy.\n\nIn simple terms, the protagonist gets one over on the antagonist, only for the antagonist to show what they’re really made of. This further corners our protagonist, making the situation feel hopeless.\n\n12. The Final Girl\n\nThe final girl is a character that the movie’s point of view follows. She’s usually the protagonist. And as the meaning suggests she is often the only survivor in most slasher movies. This character is more observational and is often smarter than the rest of the characters.\n\nShe has a particular set of skills, which ultimately help her survive throughout the movie. Her heart is set on more important things than other characters’ interests. For example, other characters may be interested in partying, while the final girl notices the strange occurrences that others do not.\n\nIn the climax of slasher films, the final girl goes head-to-head with the antagonist. Classic examples of final girls include Halloween’s Laurie Strode, Scream’s Sidney Prescott and A Nightmare on Elm Street’s Nancy Thompson.\n\nIt’s a trope that may or may not work for your particular script and one that you may choose to subvert or play with. However, it’s worth thinking about what characteristics the final girl demonstrates that are important for your protagonist in general, whoever they are or whatever their background. For example, the sense that they have something different from the other characters that makes us relate to them is crucial.\n\n13. A Killer Ending\n\nMost great and memorable slasher films leave the ending on a cliffhanger. This makes the audience reeling for more from the killer.\n\nFor example, in Wrong Turn, the two remaining survivors believe they have killed the family of cannibals, only for the police to find out the villains are very much alive. This hints they will continue their killing spree in the next instalment.\n\nIf the antagonist survives in the ending, it often leads to sequels and franchises. For example, the infamous character resurrections in franchises, such as Michael Myers in Halloween and Jason Vorhees in Friday the 13th.\n\nSo it’s always worth suggesting your killer is one that can’t truly be defeated. Not only does it set up the potential for sequels, but it leaves the audience with one last chill.\n\n10 Great Slasher Movie Examples\n\nIn this section, we’ll analyse 10 great slasher movie examples according to the criteria of the 13 key elements of slasher movies section seen above.

But in the quiet town, no one is of help.\n\nMultiple jump scares include the iconic wardrobe scene at the climax.\n\nMyers resurrects after multiple stabs from Laurie. But Final Girl Laurie Strode is helped by Myers’ doctor, Dr. Sam Loomis, to escape his torment.\n\nMichael is shot five times before he falls over the balcony.

It’s quite a formulaic genre in this regard, needing specific beats to make the specific elements work.\n\nLocation demonstrates this best. The slasher film would not work as well if the characters weren’t isolated with the killer and stranded. That being said, there are many ways to play with the formula of a slasher film. The key parts of it are to make the tension and violence feel palpable. And streamlining the elements into key parts often helps in this regard.\n\nThis is where using the above 13 elements as a guide comes in handy. It’s a shorthand for making sure your story is doing the utmost it can to keep the horror high. Slasher movies might seem like they just need a ruthless killer with a sharp weapon. However, it’s clear that there are important beats that make the horror powerful and resonant.\n\nFollowing these beats will allow the horror to creep out from the page and into the minds and bodies of readers and audiences. This is the key to a great slasher film – creating the sense of tangible terror.\n\nIn Summary\n\n– What did you think of this article?
