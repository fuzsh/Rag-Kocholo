She went on to star or co-star in such movies as Riding in Cars with Boys (2001), Spun (2002), Just Married (2003), Uptown Girls (2003), Sin City (2005), and Happy Feet (2006) before her baffling sudden death at the young age of 32.\n\nNot-So-Fun Fact\n\nSimon Monjack was an English screenwriter, film director, producer and make-up artist He was the husband of American actress Brittany Murphy. Five months after the death of his wife, Monjack was found dead on 23 May 2010 in the same house in Hollywood where Brittnay died. Law enforcement sources say the Los Angeles Fire Department was called there for a medical emergency after Murphy’s mother, Sharon, found Monjack unconscious in the master bedroom around 9:20 pm, and then called 911. Paramedics arrived and Monjack was pronounced dead at 9:45 pm. The coroner’s report found the cause of Monjack’s death to be acute pneumonia and severe anaemia, similar to the causes attributed to his wife’s death five months earlier in the same house. He was buried next to Murphy at Forest Lawn cemetery in the Hollywood Hills.\n\nThe home at 1895 Rising Glen Road, Los Angeles, California where both Brittany and her husband died has since been torn down and a new home built in it’s place."
