        "text": "Background\n\nBrittany Anne Murphy was born in Atlanta, Georgia, on November 10, 1977, to Angelo Bertolotti and Sharon Murphy. Her father is of Italian ancestry and her mother has an Irish and Slovak background. She grew up as a Baptist before becoming a non-denominational Christian. She had a younger half-sister and two older half-brothers. After her parents’ divorce, Murphy and her mother moved to Edison, New Jersey. She developed an interest in acting as a child. Murphy’s mother encouraged her to pursue her dreams and enrolled her at Verne Fowler’s School of Dance and Theater in Colonia, New Jersey when she was five. She began appearing in television ads when she was about 12 years old. She eventually got minor roles in television sitcoms like “Murphy Brown” and “Kids Incorporated.” She was a supporting character in the American sitcom “Drexell’s Class” from 1991 to 1992. Meanwhile, she continued her schooling at Burbank, California’s John Burroughs High School.\n\nMurphy’s first major film appearance was in Amy Heckerling’s teen romantic comedy “Clueless,” released in 1995. The picture was a financial success, grossing roughly $57 million on a budget of $12 million. It also earned favorable reviews and grew to have a cult following over time. She played a significant role in the 1999 drama film “Girl, Interrupted” after starring in various films such as “Freeway” (1996), “Bongwater” (1997), “The Prophecy II” (1998), and “Zack and Reba” (1998). Commercially and critically, the film was a big hit. Over the years, she appeared in several films, including “Cherry Falls” (2000), “The Audition” (2000), “Sidewalks of New York” (2001), “Don’t Say A Word” (2001), and “8 Mile” (2002). She had a vital role in the criminal anthology film “Sin City” in 2005. Commercially, the picture was a great hit, grossing roughly three times its budget. The critics appreciated it as well. Throughout her career, she appeared in several television programs, including “Boy Meets World,” “Murder One,” and “Pepper Ann.” After she died, the films “Abandoned” (2010) and “Something Wicked” (2014) were released posthumously.\n\nMurphy and Ashton Kutcher began dating in 2002, but they separated, and she got engaged to Joe Macaluso in 2005. In 2006, they ended their relationship. Murphy married British screenwriter Simon Monjack in a private Jewish wedding ceremony in Los Angeles in May 2007. On December 20, 2009, the actress died of pneumonia, and on December 24, 2009, she was laid to rest in Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Hollywood Hills."
