        "text": "The home where doomed starlet Brittany Murphy and her husband, Simon Monjack, died has been sold for $12.2 million, The Post can reveal.\n\nThe sale, which took place under the radar on Dec. 29, 2020, is only the latest chapter in the home’s long, eerie saga.\n\nPerched atop the Sunset Strip, the Los Angeles home was sold to Murphy by pop superstar Britney Spears in 2008.\n\nAt 8 a.m. on Dec. 20, 2009, the Los Angeles Fire Department responded to a call at the home, where Murphy, 32, had apparently collapsed in a bathroom. She was transported to Cedars-Sinai hospital, where she died about two hours later after going into cardiac arrest.\n\nHer husband, who was 40, died just five months later, on May 23, 2010 — also at the Hollywood Hills residence.\n\nThe fire department was again called to the home for a medical emergency, after Murphy’s mother, Sharon, found Monjack unconscious in the master bedroom around 9:20 p.m. He was pronounced dead by paramedics.\n\nThe coroner’s report found the cause of Monjack’s death to be acute pneumonia and severe anemia, similar to the causes attributed to his wife’s death.\n\nLater in 2010, authorities planned an inspection of the home to determine whether toxic mold could have contributed to their deaths. However, that theory was later ruled out by the medical examiner’s office. Still, the circumstances around their deaths has haunted fans to this day: This week, HBO Max announced a two-part documentary on the “Clueless” and “Uptown Girls” actress.\n\nBut the home itself has a story to tell. In the 11 years since Murphy and Monjack died, the property has been listed 10 different times.\n\nIn 2013, a complete deconstruction and makeover of the sprawling mansion began, which lasted three years. Developers sought to tear down the original structure and upgrade the property into a contemporary design to fit with the SoCal lifestyle.\n\nIn 2017, the home was finally sold to a new owner, before it was sold again three months ago at a $2 million loss.\n\nWhile Spears lived there, she had a decidedly spooky experience with the house, according to her former makeup artist Julianne Kaye.\n\nOn the Feb. 24 episode of the “We Need To Talk About Britney” podcast, Kaye claims Spears recounted to her a run-in with supernatural forces: “[Spears] had that place up on Sunset Plaza — and I’m just gonna say, this is really weird … She calls me … I had my friend do reiki healing on her, he had come up, I guess she’d had a crazy partying weekend and needed to relax. He left, and she swears to God that he opened some spirit portal or something, and these bad spirits had come in … and they were trying to, like, push her down the stairs or something crazy.”\n\n“It was so bad that she left,” Kaye continues. “She went to the Casa Del Mar hotel to stay there and never went back to the house. She goes, ‘I know you’re gonna think I’m crazy. I’m not crazy. I know what I saw, I know what I felt.’ “\n\nBut it appears that the home’s more recent owners have gone to great lengths to move on from its grim history.\n\nHere’s a look inside the five-bedroom, nine-bathroom mansion.\n\nThe house has an open floor plan with floor-to-ceiling windows in nearly every room. A Crestron smart home system includes automated window shades to allow natural light to flow throughout, according to the listing.\n\nThe gourmet kitchen includes top-of-the-line Miele appliances and opens to a wood-planked patio. The master suite comes with sweeping views of the city and boasts two walk-in closets, his-and-hers bathrooms and a private patio.\n\nAn elevator has also been added, which goes from the garage to the master bedroom.\n\nOther features include a home theater, a massage room, a wine cellar, an infinity pool, a spa, a built-in barbecue area with seating and a custom fire pit."
