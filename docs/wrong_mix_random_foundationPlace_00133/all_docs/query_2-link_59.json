        "text": "THE Brittany Murphy/HBO Max documentary trailer featured a friend that claimed her husband Simon Monjack made her his \"prey\" before her sudden death.\n\nThe What Happened, Brittany Murphy? documentary will follow the struggles of the breakout star from the popular '90s comedy, Clueless.\n\nIn the footage, Hocus Pocus actress Kathy Najimy revealed her thoughts on the marriage between the 8 Mile actress and Simon, who was known as an English screenwriter, director, and producer\n\nKathy alleged: \"We all were scared and freaked out. Like, who was this guy?\"\n\nThe Sin City actress struggled with her body image while dealing with the pressures of Hollywood.\n\nThe King of the Hill voice actress continued: \"She said, 'That's what I've been told if I wanted to be considered as a leading lady.'\"\n\nKathy claimed: \"During a little dip she was having, he came along. And I think that's where her judgment was muddled, and she became prey.\"\n\nThe HBO Max documentary will also feature interviews with Simon's mother, Linda, and his brother, James, and Elizabeth Ragsdale, the woman whom he was engaged to before he married Brittany, according to People.\n\nSIMON AND BRITTANY\n\nBefore tying the knot to the Don't Say a Word actress, Simon was married to Simone Bienne back in 2001 until the former couple divorced in 2006.\n\nSimon then married his second wife Brittany back in 2007 until her death.\n\nThe Just Married actress passed away on December 20, 2009, at the age of 32.\n\nAfter collapsing in the shower before 8am, Brittany was found dead at her home in Los Angeles.\n\nThe Los Angeles Coroner ruled her death was due to pneumonia, anemia, and drug intoxication due to prescription pills.\n\nSimon was found dead about five months later on May 23, 2010, in his house in Hollywood, according to the Los Angeles County coroner’s office.\n\nThe coroner’s report found the cause of Simon's death to be acute pneumonia and severe anemia, similar to the causes attributed to his wife’s death in the same house.\n\nTHE AFTERMATH\n\nSimon reportedly had two secret children.\n\nSimon's reported daughter Jasmine was raised in Luton, UK, by her mother Marcia Newman.\n\nBrittany did not leave behind any children during her life.\n\nBefore his death in 2019, Brittany's father, Angelo Bertolotti, revealed he had given up on his legal fight against the Los Angeles Coroner's Court to get her body exhumed and find out the true cause of death.\n\nThe two-night event for What Happened, Brittany Murphy? will begin October 14, 2021, on HBO Max."
