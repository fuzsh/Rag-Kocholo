        "text": "Highlights\n\nBrittany Murphy's marriage to Simon Monjack was unusual, and they had a close relationship with her mother Sharon Murphy.\n\nSharon and Monjack lived in the same house and even slept in the same bed after Brittany's death.\n\nMonjack and Sharon spent a lot of time together until Monjack passed away.\n\nBrittany Murphy's 2009 death was particularly disturbing. After watching the sweet actress star in movies like Clueless, she faded from public view for a while, and hearing that she had passed away was terrible. Fans have a lot of questions about Brittany's life before her passing, including whether she was friends with co-star Alicia Silverstone.\n\nThe details of Brittany Murphy's demise are still fuzzy. It seems like no matter how much time goes by, no one can be sure about what actually occurred. One of the oddest things about her life was her marriage to Simon Monjack, who thought Brittany's career was affected by a conspiracy. It turns out there was something else that was off about him, too: his relationship with her mother Sharon Murphy.\n\nInside The Odd Relationship Between Brittany Murphy's Husband Simon Monjack And Mother Sharon Murphy\n\nAccording to a Grunge article about Brittany Murphy's inheritance, her husband Simon Monjack and her mother Sharon Murphy were a little too close after she died. As explained in the HBO Max documentary What Happened, Brittany Murphy?\n\nWhile fans would expect her husband and family to still keep in touch, they lived in the same house. To make things even more confusing, Grunge reported that the two actually slept in the same bed.\n\nIt's unclear why Sharon and Monjack did this. There is no evidence that the two were romantically involved either before or after Brittany Murphy's death. It's possible that they did and no one knew about it, but that would just be speculation.\n\nRelated\n\nBrittany Murphy Admitted She Had To Be Very Careful When Answering A Certain Eminem Question\n\nBrittany Murphy worried that if she gave the wrong answer to a certain question, she would become diss material for an Eminem song.\n\nAfter TMZ reported that Monjack and Sharon Murphy slept next to each other, Sharon said that it wasn't true. She said:\n\n\"I am very disturbed that the L.A. Coroners [sic] office continues to release things to the media that are misleading. The TMZ story with it's [sic] salacious headline suggesting that my prescious [sic] son-in-law Simon and I slept in bed together, infering [sic] sexual contact is journalism at its lowest.\"\n\nWhile Sharon Murphy said that nothing was going on between her and Simon Monjack, they seemed to spend a lot of time together until he died in the spring of 2010.\n\nLinda Monjack, Simon's mother, was interviewed by People in January 2010 and mentioned how well her son and Brittany's mother got along.\n\nLinda said:\n\nâHeâs very strong, and heâs got Sharon. Theyâre very close, and theyâre keeping each other going.â\n\nSome might say that it's odd that the two kept living in the same house after Brittany was gone. It's even more confusing to hear that they wanted to move to New York City.\n\nRelated\n\nBrittany Murphy's Greatest Roles, Ranked By IMDb\n\nBrittany Murphy tragically passed away well before her time, but her Hollywood career is one to be remembered.\n\nIn March 2010, E! News interviewed Monjack, who shared the news. He said, \"I decided to move back to my apartment in New York as had been my plan with Brittany. Sharon said that she always loved New York and L.A. is just too painful for her; so would I mind if she moved too? Of course I don't.\" He also said, \"But I should point out we will be maintaining separate residences.\"\n\nHow Did Brittany Murphy Die?\n\nHow Did Simon Monjack Die? (According to People)\n\nSharon Murphy and Simon Monjack both spoke to the media after Brittany's passing. While they talked about how much they missed her and how heartbroken they were, they also talked about their own relationship. According to People, Monjack said:\n\nâI donât know if she will ever recover, and I know when she reads all this nonsense about her son-in-law and her deceased daughter, her heart is breaking. She has lived with us and saw the love and support. I hope she stays â I canât imagine my life without Sharon â sheâs my link to Brittany.â\n\nA few years after Monjack died, in 2013, Sharon Murphy wrote a piece for The Hollywood Reporter and shared her sadness over grieving both her son-in-law and her daughter. She wrote, \"I have remained in seclusion in my mourning.\"\n\nHow Long Were Brittany Murphy And Her Husband Simon Monjack Together?\n\nSimon Monjack and Brittany Murphy were together from 2006 until 2009, according to Us Weekly. They got married in 2007. Since people talk about the couple's relationship so much, it might seem like they dated for many years, but that wasn't actually the case.\n\nAccording to People, the couple met at a Hollywood photo shoot. Brittany was only 13. When they saw each other again at a birthday celebration held for Brittany, she was 28 years old, and the relationship began. He was seven years her senior.\n\nRelated\n\nBrittany Murphy's Final Performance In Something Wicked Took Four Years To Edit And Her Performance Left Those Behind The Scenes Speechless\n\nAs expected, looking back at the footage of Brittany Murphy's last role was an emotional process for everyone involved with the film.\n\nBrittany Murphy's Ex-Partners (According to Today.com)\n\nJoe Macaluso (production assistant)\n\nJeff Kwatinetz (talent manager)\n\nEminem\n\nAshton Kutcher\n\nWhere there's a lot to know about the couple's relationship, people are, of course, very interested in the speculation that Monjack was somehow involved in Brittany's death. According to USA Today, the documentary What Happened, Brittany Murphy? suggested that Monjack was in charge of Brittany's life and that it wasn't the healthiest relationship.\n\nCynthia Hill, the director of the documentary, spoke to Variety about Monjack. Hill said:\n\nâThe first thing is that you have to believe her autopsy if you believe in science. I donât think that [Simon] murdered â and Iâm throwing air quotes around it â Brittany. But I do think that he bears a good deal of responsibility in her demise and death because of the things that he didnât do. Also, I think from all the isolating her from other people, it was like this perfect storm.â\n\nncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiZq6Gkqa6vxYymrKuomK7AbrnOrZ%2Beql2dwrSuwKebZquZoryvecyopaOZk6B6o7XZmqmrnV2nsq2t06Kmp6uYnr1urcWtnKtllJqutbSO"
