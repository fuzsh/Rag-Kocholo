        "text": "HBO has announced it is releasing a new documentary focused on the mysterious death of Hollywood actress Brittany Murphy, who was best known for films including Clueless, 8 Mile and Just Married.\n\nMurphy died in 2009, aged 32. The cause of her death was ruled as accidental, with the coroner blaming a combination of pneumonia and over-the-counter medications.\n\nThe two-part documentary series, however, features interviews with Murphy's former co-stars and examines 'concerns' relating to her husband, London-born screenwriter Simon Monjack, whom she married in 2007 .\n\nThe trailer for What Happened, Brittany Murphy? accuses Monjack of repeatedly lying about having terminal brain cancer, and having dated Elle Macpherson and Madonna.\n\n'Every single word out of his mouth was a lie,' said one contributor.\n\nMonjack himself died less than six month after Murphy, at the same Los Angeles house, under similar circumstances.\n\n'Brittany was so wonderful,' said actress Kathy Najimy in the trailer. 'There was nobody else like her.'\n\nBrittany Murphy in Clueless, alongside Alicia Silverstone and Justin Walker\n\nShe goes on to describe how Monjack 'came along' when the star was suffering a 'little dip'.\n\n'I think that's where her judgment was muddled, and she became prey. We all were scared and freaked out. Like, \"Who was this guy?\"'\n\nOther contributors cast further suspicion on the narrative surrounding Murphy's death.\n\nOne said, 'a healthy 32-year-old doesn't just die,' while another added: 'Simon took her away. He made sure no one could get to her.'\n\nSimon Monjack and Brittany Murphy\n\nDirected by Cynthia Hill, What Happened, Brittany Murphy? features new footage and interviews with the actress' close friends.\n\nProducers say it 'goes beyond the tabloid rumours to examine the impact of Hollywood’s sexism on her struggles, as well as lingering concerns about her relationship'.\n\nBoth episodes of the documentary will debut on HBO Max on October 14, but unfortunately we'll have to wait for a UK release date.\n\nFingers crossed it comes to UK shores soon, as it looks set to be unmissable."
