        "text": "Some homes have a bad history connected to them, and late actress Brittany Murphy’s house is no exception.\n\nBrittany, who died in December 2009 in her home, moved into her Hollywood Hills house in 2003 after she bought it fully furnished from Britney Spears. The former Clueless star’s health—and her house—are covered extensively in the new HBO Max documentary,\n\nHere's everything you need to know about the dark and weird history of the home.\n\nHow long did Brittany live in her home?\n\nBrittany lived in her house for a little less than six years with her husband, Simon Monjack. The actress was just 32 when she collapsed in her bathroom after having flu-like symptoms for a few days. Her mom, who lived with Brittany and Simon, called 911 and she was taken to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, where she was pronounced dead.\n\nThe L.A. County Coroner determined in February 2010 that Brittany had died from untreated pneumonia, combined with anemia and drug intoxication from prescription and over-the-counter medications, according to People.\n\nBrittany's husband also died in the house—under similar circumstances.\n\nBut just months later, Sharon found Simon unresponsive in the home. Authorities pronounced him dead and determined that, like his late wife, he died of acute pneumonia and severe anemia, according to ABC News.\n\nThe eerie similarities in the couple’s deaths had people wondering if they died of mold toxicity.\n\n\"It is unusual to have two people die of similar circumstances with pneumonia,” Los Angeles County assistant chief coroner Ed Winter told ABC News at the time. “We've been looking at it and saying, 'Something isn't right.' I'm not saying you can't get pneumonia from mold, but we did all the tests on it—mold did not come up in the toxicology reports.”\n\nBut Simon’s mom, Linda Monjack, later told the Daily Mail that her son had found “severe mold” in the home before he died and he was also having hallucinations. “All I know is that before Simon's death, he was having hallucinations that things were crawling out of his skin,” she said.\n\nBrittany didn't like the house and wanted to move.\n\nBefore his death, Monjack told the Hollywood Reporter that his wife didn’t like their home. “She absolutely hated the Rising Glen house,” he said. “Every time we would drive up Sunset, Brit would say, 'Please, can we stay at the Beverly Hills Hotel?' I'd say: 'Honey, you've got to be realistic. We have our house, a 10,000-square-foot home. We're going to stay in it.’”\n\nThe couple had plans to move to New York before Brittany died.\n\nBritney Spears also got bad vibes from the house.\n\nWhile all of that is freaky, Britney also had a weird experience in the home, her former makeup artist Julianne Kaye said on the “We Need to Talk About Britney” podcast in February.\n\n“I had my friend do reiki healing on her, he had come up, I guess she'd had a crazy partying weekend and needed to relax,” Kaye said. “He left, and she swears to God that he opened some spirit portal or something, and these bad spirits had come in … and they were trying to, like, push her down the stairs or something crazy.”\n\nKaye said that the experience “was so bad that she left. She went to the Casa Del Mar hotel to stay there and never went back to the house.” Kaye also said that Britney told her, “I know you're going to think I'm crazy. I'm not crazy. I know what I saw. I know what I felt.’”\n\nIt was sold in December 2020 for $11.59 million."
