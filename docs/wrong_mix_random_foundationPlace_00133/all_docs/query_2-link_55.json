        "text": "The thing about Brittany Murphy was how alive she was.\n\nIn her constant smile, in her quick laugh, in her uninhibited fury and fear in dramatic roles — she was the sparkle and the light.\n\nHer breakout film role as Tai — a fish-out-of-water Beverly Hills high school student with a tri-state accent in the 1995 classic “Clueless” — saw her “rollin’ with the homies,” but also delivering one of the most devastating lines of all time:\n\n“You’re a virgin who can’t drive.”\n\nThe way she aggressively swiveled her neck and fired those words at Alicia Silverstone’s character Cher — as though she was channeling every ounce of spite in the state of New Jersey — it was as if Silverstone had left her body, like in a cartoon, and started playing the harp. You could see the life leave her eyes.\n\nMurphy’s crackling performance in “Girl, Interrupted” (1999) and her lead roles in “8 Mile” (2002) and a string of early aughts romantic comedies helped establish her as a talent with big potential.\n\nSo when she died suddenly in 2009, it seemed like some cruel tabloid joke. Murphy was only 32, and just about everyone had questions. Most centered on Simon Monjack, her husband of more than two years. But then he died just five months later, in remarkably similar circumstances.\n\nWhat the hell was going on?\n\nThat’s the resounding question in the title of the two-part documentary, “What Happened, Brittany Murphy?” premiering Thursday on HBO Max.\n\nAnswers bring more questions\n\nThe film, directed by Emmy nominee Cynthia Hill (“Private Violence”), is mostly a postmortem of the dark and twisted end of Murphy’s life — including details on how her actual autopsy was conducted — and partly an appreciation of her ebullience and talent.\n\nPyramid Productions and Blumhouse’s “What Happened, Brittany Murphy?” shuns a chronological timeline to shuttle back and forth between the rise of Murphy’s career and the days after her death, when suspicions fixated on Monjack, a mostly unknown English screenwriter and filmmaker. On that note, Hill’s film seeks to deliver a clearer picture of who he really was.\n\nHBO Max bills the film as a nuanced departure from other, perhaps more sensational attempts at understanding Murphy’s death — the Investigation Discovery special “Brittany Murphy: An ID Mystery” aired in 2020. But the facts are so startling that any approach can feel like a collection of tabloid headlines.\n\nA medical examiner determined that Murphy died from pneumonia and anemia from severe iron deficiency in combination with intoxication from over-the-counter drugs. Monjack, 40, was found to have died from pneumonia and anemia in the same home as Murphy.\n\nThe matching causes of death added to the mystery, but efforts to determine if possible toxic mold in their home played any role never turned up any credible evidence. Neither did the assertion from Murphy’s father Angelo Bertolotti that his daughter was intentionally poisoned (Bertolotti died in 2019).\n\nThe documentary consults celebrity journalists, including Perez Hilton, and Ed Winter, a retired Los Angeles coroner who handled Murphy’s death and was widely cited in coverage in 2009 and stories revisiting the puzzling developments.\n\n“There were several little indicators that just didn’t feel right,” Winter says of the scene after Murphy’s death. “The hair on the back of your neck stands up and it’s like, ‘What?’”\n\nIt’s the people who were close to not just Murphy but also Monjack who give us the biggest insights into why the actor isn’t lighting up our screens anymore.\n\nMurphy died of pneumonia and anemia, but the film argues that she was dying another kind of death ever since she met Monjack.\n\nYoung star with a ‘Jersey edge’\n\nBrittany Murphy was born in Atlanta and grew up in Edison before moving to Los Angeles in the early ‘90s with her single mother, Sharon Murphy, to chase acting roles.\n\nOne of the most haunting scenes in the film isn’t any of the Murphy movie clips that eerily match up with developments in her life, like dramatic reenactments performed by her ghost. It’s when a young Murphy is at the Metuchen Country Fair 31 years ago, in October 1990.\n\n“Would you like a children’s perspective?” she asks the host of a program called “Metuchen on the Air.”\n\nMurphy, then a smiling, laughing student from Herbert Hoover Middle School in Edison, proceeds to act as a correspondent, holding the microphone and interviewing fairgoers. She always had the heart of a performer, and it hurts that we can’t see what else she might have done if she was still with us.\n\nKelley Faulkner, Murphy’s friend from back home in Jersey, met the actor when she was 11, and they were in a play together. The future star never stopped trying to be an entertainer. Faulkner remembers when Murphy completely blanked on the lyrics to a song and improvised a dance routine with high kicks and pirouettes to fill the space. Murphy was an “in the moment” type of performer, she says, echoing her future work on film sets where she was fresh and new with every take.\n\nThe documentary uses quick cuts of Murphy’s many film roles to match the mood of the story and build drama, at one point placing her in a pantheon of iconic Hollywood actresses. After a steady stream of sitcom roles as a kid from 1991 on, the actor booked her first movie — “Clueless.”\n\n“There was kind of a sweet, childish, lost quality that she had that just breaks your heart,” Amy Heckerling, the director of the film, sharply observes.\n\nMurphy was still a child — 17 — when she played Tai in the movie. But she retained that vulnerable youthfulness in other roles.\n\nHer filmography also included “Uptown Girls” (2003) with a young Dakota Fanning; “Freeway” (1996) with Reese Witherspoon; sleeper hit “Drop Dead Gorgeous” (1999) with fellow Jersey actor Kirsten Dunst; “Don’t Say a Word” (2001) with Michael Douglas; “Riding in Cars with Boys” (2001) with Drew Barrymore; “Spun” (2002) and “Sin City” (2005) with Mickey Rourke; and the animated penguin movie “Happy Feet” (2006).\n\n“I think she knew that she had something different, that Jersey edge,” says Bruce Bibby, a Hollywood correspondent who wrote as Ted Casablanca. “Absolutely loved that about her.”\n\nThe actor had the kind of electricity that reached through the screen, that made you feel like she needed better opportunities, especially when her career started to downshift.\n\nTaryn Manning, Murphy’s co-star in “8 Mile,” describes her as being like “a butterfly that you can’t catch … just buzzing around everywhere.”\n\nNevertheless, in something of a misogynistic, real-life version of Tai’s makeover from “Clueless,” Brittany Murphy wasn’t allowed to be herself — not physically, anyway. She was pressured to be a rail-thin blonde after someone “important” in Hollywood told her she didn’t have sex appeal (they used a more vulgar word for this). Following instructions for what it took to becoming a “leading lady,” she dropped a lot of weight and tried a different wardrobe. She fended off accusations of anorexia. Before she collapsed and died, Murphy shrunk even more, appearing frail to friends.\n\n‘He worked his spell on her’\n\nSimon Monjack, portrayed as a master manipulator, entered Murphy’s life in 2006 in a vacuum created by a career lull and the breakdown of previous relationships, according to the film. They included two engagements and a very public romance with the highly visible Ashton Kutcher (her co-star in the 2003 film “Just Married”).\n\nSara Hammel, who covered Murphy’s death for People magazine, argues that Monjack filled some larger need in the actor as someone in search of a father figure, her own father having been absent.\n\nHill constantly returns to Monjack like he’s the second subject. And he pretty much is, given the question in the title, though it can’t help but feel like the Murphy career section needs more time in the spotlight. It does seem inevitable that the circumstances of her death and her young age will always be part of her legacy, but if we know it’s bound to overshadow her work, why not pull some more in the opposite direction? If she was such a brilliant actor, why can’t we let her brilliance shine a bit more, and not just in service of illustrating her downward spiral and death?\n\nNot only did he request that there be no autopsy of his wife, but before he died, Monjack gave a Radar Online reporter a detailed tour of the home he shared with Brittany and Sharon. He highlighted what he called “the infamous bathroom” where she died. He also shared that Sharon, who kept living in the house with him, would sometimes join him in bed to cry over Brittany, fueling rumors of an unsavory relationship between the two in combination with a cringeworthy 2010 interview with Larry King and an awkward photoshoot where they embraced.\n\nRoger Neal, who served as the publicist for Sharon Murphy and Monjack in the wake of Brittany’s death, rejects allegations that Simon and Sharon had anything more than a family relationship.\n\nWhich begs another question: What if Sharon Murphy had agreed to be in the film, and had more of a voice here beyond archival footage? She was not interviewed, though she is the only person still alive who was living in Brittany’s Hollywood Hills home when her daughter and Monjack died.\n\nSharon’s painful howls set the tone at the start of the documentary, in a 911 call after Brittany passed out in her bathroom in December 2009.\n\n“Brittany, please come back!” she says, crying out in anguish. The actor had been dizzy and had trouble walking after getting sick following a trip to Puerto Rico to film a movie. Brittany, Sharon and Simon all reported flu-like symptoms in connection with the journey.\n\nIt feels like any documentary on Monjack could easily turn into a 10-episode limited series.\n\nHe would tell people he was a billionaire. On more than one occasion, he claimed he had terminal cancer but was saved by an experimental treatment made from shark fins. He boasted that he had dated Madonna and Elle Macpherson. He called himself the largest collector of Vermeer paintings and said he had 17 Ferraris. He also said his movie “Two Days, Nine Lives” (1999) was getting great reviews in England.\n\nEverything was a lie.\n\nAfter his wife died, Monjack briefly ran a Brittany Murphy Foundation and solicited donations (his mother appears in the film alongside his brother, and says she often gave him a lot of money but denies he ever swindled her). Neal says Monjack had run through $3 million of Murphy’s money in three years, telling Sharon that he made investments in jewelry and real estate. When she wanted to sell the jewelry after he died, Neal tried to get it appraised and found everything was fake.\n\nNeal learned that Monjack had a daughter in England, something he says Brittany never knew about. (He surmises that Monjack must have used her money to put the child through private school.) But Monjack also had a son named Elijah with Elizabeth Ragsdale, an American woman he met in France (Neal had no idea until he sat down to film the documentary).\n\n“I know why Brittany chose Simon,” says Ragsdale, who was formerly engaged to Monjack. “He worked his spell on her and she fell for it, like I did.”\n\nShe tells a harrowing, eerily familiar story of a time when she needed medical attention, but Simon had to be forced to help her get it.\n\nMurphy purportedly told more than one person that she thought she might be dying. What if Monjack had taken her to a hospital or doctor instead of watching as she used over-the-counter drugs? What if she had a simple lab test that could’ve flagged her anemia, or a chest X-ray that would reveal pneumonia?\n\nWhen she saw photos of Murphy looking more and more thin, Ragsdale remembered Monjack’s love of “anorexic women,” and the times he criticized her own appearance.\n\n‘Hypnotized,’ then dead\n\n“What Happened?” uses interviews with directors, producers and actors who worked with Murphy, frequently returning to Kathy Najimy, her co-star in the hit animated series “King of the Hill” (Murphy voiced Luanne Platter, and Najimy voiced Peggy Hill).\n\n“Brittany was so wonderful,” Najimy says. “Like, there was nobody else like her.”\n\nShe drives home an idea that many seem to echo. In a town of performers on and off the screen, the word with Murphy was “genuine.” She could be counted on to be the same person at a party or at home as she was on set.\n\nBut something changed when she met Monjack.\n\nAs Najimy puts it, Murphy was “hypnotized” by her husband. He had all the power, the actor and others say — not just over Murphy but her mother.\n\nEventually, Murphy parted ways with her agent and manager so Monjack could take control. She had no access to phone or email. He handled all communications, whether from directors and filmmakers or friends and loved ones, and no one could reach her without seeking him out. He even became her on-set makeup artist (with apparently disastrous results).\n\nThere was nothing obvious to indicate that Murphy was fatally sick, but in December 2009, when Najimy’s husband told her he had bad news, she immediately guessed that Murphy had died. (For his part, Perez Hilton, who targeted Murphy’s marriage, flagging career and drug rumors while she was alive, says he regrets a radio interview where he guessed Brittany Murphy would die.)\n\nNajimy regrets that she hadn’t just posted up outside Murphy’s house, demanding to see her — that she hadn’t whisked her away against her will just to keep her alive.\n\nMurphy had been sapped of her vitality for a while. People who cared about her knew it, they just didn’t know how to stop it.\n\nYes, there were rumors of drug abuse and public appearances where she appeared to be altered — a personal trainer says she seemed “high” when she was with Monjack — but the intervention that friends staged was about their relationship.\n\nThey tried to show Brittany and Sharon that Simon was bad news, that he had an expired visa and legal troubles.\n\nIt didn’t work.\n\n“What Happened, Brittany Murphy?” premieres Thursday, Oct. 14 on HBO Max.\n\nThank you for relying on us to provide the journalism you can trust.
