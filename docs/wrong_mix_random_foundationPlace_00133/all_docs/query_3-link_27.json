        "text": "While the death of Brittany Murphy may leave some of her unfinished big screen roles up in the air, a source who worked with Murphy on one of her most recent projects spoke out with some startling words about the actress and her husband.\n\nEarlier this month, it was reported Murphy was fired from her latest film, \"The Caller,\" for disturbing production. And following her death, a source who worked on the film told Access Hollywood about the actress' strange behavior on the set of the supernatural thriller.\n\n\"Bizarre doesn't begin to describe her behavior on set,\" the source claimed. \"It's her husband who is Satan. And he drags her to the dark side… And even after all the horrible things she and her evil dude did, everyone is devastated.\"\n\nOn December 5, \"Saturday Night Live\" spoofed the actress' dismissal from the film on \"Weekend Update,\" with Abby Elliot playing a seemingly out of sorts caricature of Murphy.\n\nFollowing her death, the skit was removed from Hulu.com, the online video site co-owned by NBC Universal.\n\nMurphy's husband, Simon Monjack, is a British screenwriter who hasn't been without his own health problems. When he and Murphy returned to Los Angeles on November 28 from the Puerto Rico set of \"The Caller,\" Monjack was rushed to the hospital after he \"stopped breathing,\" according to the 911 call from the incident.\n\nBut the source on the set of \"The Caller\" apparently isn't the only one with a strong opinion on Murphy's husband.\n\nOn Monday morning at Los Angeles International Airport, Murphy's former friend, Jaime Pressly, suggested Monjack came between their friendship.\n\n\"Were you friends with Brittany Murphy?\" photographers asked Jaime.\n\n\"I was before she married him,\" she replied.\n\nMurphy and Monjack tied the knot in 2007.\n\nRelated Content from AccessHollywood.com:\n\nVIEW THE PHOTOS: Sudden Endings: Stars Who Died Too Soon\n\nPLAY IT NOW: Access Archives: Brittany Murphy Is An Access 'Producer For A Day' (July 9, 2004)\n\nPLAY IT NOW: Brittany Murphy: 'I Would Love To Have A Child'\n\nMORE ACCESS ON THESE TOPICS: Brittany Murphy - Movies - Deaths"
