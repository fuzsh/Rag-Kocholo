        "text": "BRITTANY Murphy’s medical examiner revealed she could’ve been saved in a new HBO Max docuseries about the actress’ mysterious death.\n\nThe two-part documentary features new interviews with some of those closest to her, detailing the circumstances surrounding her marriage to Simon Monjack and her 2009 death.\n\nBrittany was found dead at her home in Los Angeles on December 20, 2009, with the Los Angeles Coroner ruling her cause of death as pneumonia, anemia and drug intoxication due to prescription pills.\n\nAfter the Clueless star’s tragic death, Dr. Lisa Scheinin, a deputy medical examiner at the time, conducted an autopsy to learn more about what happened to Brittany.\n\nIn the documentary, the doctor revealed that her tests showed that the beloved actress “would’ve had a chance” to survive if her husband Simon had taken her to the hospital sooner.\n\nBoth Simon and Brittany’s mom, Sharon, had said after the death that Brittany was sick in the weeks before, though no one ever did anything about it.\n\nDr. Scheinin said the autopsy showed that Brittany was a “very anemic person” and that she was suffering from “severe pneumonia” at the time of her death.\n\nShe added that these things could’ve easily been seen in tests had she been taken to the hospital while she was alive and doctors could’ve have started her on treatment, possibly saving her life.\n\nOn top of those two health issues, the doctor said the toxicology report said there was “no evidence of alcohol or any drugs of abuse in her system,” but she did have “prescription and over the counter medications” in her body.\n\n“This could be the straw that breaks the camel’s back,” she said of what might’ve led to Brittany’s death at just 32 in the docuseries, titled What Happened, Brittany Murphy?\n\nSimon was married to second wife Brittany from 2007 until her death on December 20, 2009.\n\nHe was found dead just five months later on May 23, 2010, in his house in Hollywood, according to the Los Angeles County coroner’s office.\n\nThe coroner’s report found the cause of his death to be acute pneumonia and severe anemia, similar to the causes attributed to his wife Brittany’s death in the same house.\n\nThe medical examiner who did the autopsy on Brittany aimed to dispute suggestions that mold in the house led to her death, as theorists wondered if that led to her and her screenwriters husband’s similar deaths.\n\n“On my autopsy, I didn’t see any evidence of mold in her lungs or her other organs,” Dr. Sheinin said. “Because you can see…the little strands of mold.”\n\nBrittany rose to fame in the 90s classic Clueless, alongside Alicia Silverstone and Paul Rudd.\n\nShe also starred alongside Michael Douglas in Don't Say A Word in 2001 and Eminem in 8 Mile, for which she received critical acclaim."
