The shares are about 8 per cent below a six-year peak it hit the same month amid speculative flurry that followed the release of Pokemon Go.\n\nWe apologize, but this video has failed to load.\n\nTry refreshing your browser, or\n\ntap here to see other videos from our team.\n\nNintendo shares jump as public gets first taste of company's upcoming Super Mario Run mobile game Back to video\n\nAdvertisement 2\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nTHIS CONTENT IS RESERVED FOR SUBSCRIBERS ONLY\n\nSubscribe now to read the latest news in your city and across Canada.\n\nExclusive articles from Barbara Shecter, Joe O'Connor, Gabriel Friedman, and others.\n\nDaily content from Financial Times, the world's leading global business publication.\n\nUnlimited online access to read articles from Financial Post, National Post and 15 news sites across Canada with one account.\n\nNational Post ePaper, an electronic replica of the print edition to view on any device, share and comment on.\n\nDaily puzzles, including the New York Times Crossword.\n\nSUBSCRIBE TO UNLOCK MORE ARTICLES\n\nSubscribe now to read the latest news in your city and across Canada.\n\nExclusive articles from Barbara Shecter, Joe O'Connor, Gabriel Friedman and others.\n\nDaily content from Financial Times, the world's leading global business publication.\n\nUnlimited online access to read articles from Financial Post, National Post and 15 news sites across Canada with one account.\n\nNational Post ePaper, an electronic replica of the print edition to view on any device, share and comment on.\n\nDaily puzzles, including the New York Times Crossword.\n\nREGISTER / SIGN IN TO UNLOCK MORE ARTICLES\n\nCreate an account or sign in to continue with your reading experience.\n\nAccess articles from across Canada with one account.\n\nShare your thoughts and join the conversation in the comments.\n\nEnjoy additional articles per month.\n\nGet email updates from your favourite authors.\n\nSign In or Create an Account\n\nEmail Address\n\nor\n\nArticle content\n\nUnlike the hit game, which was created by San Francisco-based Niantic Inc., Super Mario Run is developed 100 per cent at Nintendo. That means most of the proceeds will flow directly to the company. It also means a potential flop would put the blame squarely with headquarters in Kyoto and would represent a major setback to the company’s long-awaited push into mobile devices.\n\nRecommended from Editorial\n\nWe talk to Mario creator Shigeru Miyamoto about the iconic plumber’s leap from your TV to your iPhone\n\nDespite being on iOS, Super Mario Run feels like real entry in Nintendo’s storied franchise\n\nSo far, at least, reception has been mostly positive. Here’s a roundup of some of the reactions:\n\nIGN showed that the first three levels will be free to play, but gamers will need to pay US$10 to unlock the remaining 21 levels and other content. Engadget praised the game’s graphics and wrote that “replayability should be excellent.” Time said the title is “simple and the gameplay remains rich and addictive,” comparing the experience to playing Super Mario games on Nintendo’s own consoles Mic.com wrote the game seemed fairly easy, saying “Mario veterans will be shocked to find that they can run right through enemy goombas.” Researcher SensorTower estimated the title will gross US$71 million in the first month and be downloaded by more than 50 million users. In September, the researcher said Pokemon Go was downloaded more than 180 million times in the first two months. In October, Apple Inc.’s Tim Cook said more than 20 million people had signed up to be notified once it is available.\n\nAdvertisement 3\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nNintendo also began a marketing campaign on television and other media to promote the game:\n\nMario creator Shigeru Miyamoto said in an interview with Time that characters besides Mario will be playable, suggesting more variety that will encourage people to replay Super Mario Go. Nintendo’s U.S. head Reggie Fils-Aime appeared on The Tonight Show to promote the game. A video of the segment has been viewed more than 500,000 times in less than 24 hours since it was uploaded. Separately, Fils-Aime also showed off the first ever live-demo of Nintendo’s upcoming console Switch. Fans on social media praised its graphical performance.\n\nIn October, Nintendo President Tatsumi Kimishima said in an interview that the game would appeal to both adults and children:\n\n“In terms of the game itself, you can download it and play a certain part of it, and then pay a fixed price and then play it over and over as many times as you want without having to pay anything extra. And that should give peace of mind that kids can play it. And we’re hoping that will help it become more popular.” “Our main business is the hardware/software business. In addition, our smartphone business has helped sell a lot of our existing packages. And it has really proved our original thesis: by releasing our software on the smartphone, it positively impacts our existing hardware and software business. And that’s precisely the synergy effect we were expecting. And as that has been proven correct, we have more confidence.”\n\nBloomberg News\n\nArticle content\n\nShare this article in your social network"
