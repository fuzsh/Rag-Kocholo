Emails with surveys is a thing, emails about changes of this size and impact should be obligatory to send out.\n\nWhat I’m the most confused about is this: If you actually decide to make changes this drastic, why not change it to a more user-friendly, easy-to-navigate and more intuitive interface?\n\nIt’s great that the users who are very invested in the forum can find their way around (with help from various Discords and what not, from what I can see). Some, like me, just need to ask a question from time to time in order to be able to do actual Wayfarer - which I love.\n\nIf I were to invest in trying to navigate this mess (sorry, but it’s CRAZY), it would take away from my actual Wayfarer time. That is not gonna happen.\n\nI’m legit very sorry to see everything was just deleted. This makes it impossible to refer to previous cases and discussions. RIP.\n\nAlso please, how do you delete your Niantic ID?"
