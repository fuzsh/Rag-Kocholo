Our latest product, Pokemon GO, has been downloaded over 500 million times and is the fastest growing mobile app of all time. We have inspired our players to collectively walk more than 4.6 billion kilometers (halfway to Pluto!). Our first product, Ingress, has been downloaded more than 14M times and has attracted a fan-base of highly active users in more than 200 countries around the world. Our systems utilize high throughput real-team geospatial querying and indexing techniques to process more than 200M game actions per day as people interact with real and virtual objects in the physical world. Interesting opportunities exist in developing the hosted platform for these and future products and in developing innovative client-side 3D and AR technologies.\\r\\n\\r\\nNiantic offers competitive salaries, stock options, medical and dental coverage for you and your family, generous vacation and holiday pay.
