I want to contact them about international trading.\n\nhttps://support.pokemongo.nianticlabs.com/hc/en-us\n\nThey have this… but forget on getting a straight answer. Tryed to contact them, since there´s a gym nearby that got a wrong name on the latest updated location, the answer was the same they give to everyone: “Find some ingress players in your region and ask them to change the name and the picture of the gym.”"
