Mark Wakefield (Co-founder) started to question why drink brands aren't required to list ingredients compared to food labels and became frustrated at how unclear it is whether drinks are natural or not. This led to the learning that many brands use E numbers to colour their drinks. Following this, due to their love for bitter drinks, the founders wanted to make an aperitif style drink that is fully transparent listing the full ingredients and thus Beesou was created. Both founders are environmentally conscious and fell in love with the idea of making a drink from honey that could help raise awareness to save the bees, support ethical beekeeping and raise money for bee charities.\n\nAbout LØCI\n\nLØCI was founded in April 2021 by Emmanuel Eribo, Philippe Homsy, Frank Eribo & Mark Quaradeghini, London-based entrepreneurs with a vision to champion style and sustainability, expressed in their statement debut sneaker collection. 100% vegan, cruelty-free, and unisex, LØCI sneakers are handmade in Porto, Portugal using recycled ocean plastics, as well as renewable and biodegradable materials where possible to help deliver a stylish eco-conscious sneaker. Production is scaled up or down in response to demand to manage environmental impact. 10% of online profits on every pair purchased are donated to conservation charities focused on protecting wildlife.\n\nSOURCE SmartMedia Technologies"
