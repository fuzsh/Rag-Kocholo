        "text": "Not sure where to post this, so please feel free to move this to a better category if it’s misplaced. TY.\n\nSome time back I stumbled upon a huge load of obviously fake Wayspots all in the same small town (Ebberup, Denmark). They were mostly small power boxes with street art paintings - only problem is they were clearly stolen images from other Wayspots or Shutterstock and other image search results.\n\nI took the time and energy to report as much of it as I could to the Wayfarer Help team (within the Wayfarer page) and fortunately, most of it got removed.\n\nToday I got a nomination for review from Ebberup though and it was a painted power box. Not street art, it just seemed someone was trying to “create” a Wasypot. I did not catch an image of this as I ended up logging all the surrounding fake Wayspots instead. But the nomination I saw was called Street art on the box (title) Nice street art on the box. (description). Address was Ebberupvej 85, 5631 Ebberup, Danmark (please hide/censor if necessary?).\n\nThere are generally MANY Wayspots in the town that seem to be on private property or school grounds, but most seem real enough at least.\n\nHowever this one is clearly not:\n\nPas på dinosaur i skoven.\n\n55.239929,9.97458\n\nThe photo is taken/bought from Shutterstock. This does also not look like a Danish scene at all so that was my first hunch something was off with this one.\n\nBtw it is also on daycare facility grounds, as well as the Wayspot a bit north of the fake dino one.\n\nStreet art box, with different logos.\n\n55.239358,9.980075\n\nThis is fake. The website written on it is also German, not Danish. The photo does not match the surroundings it’s supposed to be in here.\n\nStreet art “Pokemon” on the box.\n\n55.239429,9.981345\n\nBackground behind the box does not match the area at all and does not match any Danish power companies logo or writing. I’m also 90% sure I saw this photo on a German portal, just can’t remember which one.\n\nStreet art in the town.\n\n55.239017,9.980052\n\nI can’t prove say for sure that this is fake, but it looks fake to me and it seems to be the same submitter (putting full stop at the end of all their titles seems to be their thing)\n\nThese are just the worst ones. I think it adds to the abuse that this submitter has created many fake Wayspots before, had many removed and then does this again. This is not what Wayfarer is about and this should have consequences.\n\nThanks in advance for reading and looking at the locations, team.\n\nLet’s keep working towards keeping the Wayfarer map clean and reflecting the real world.\n\nThank you!\n\nI just feel like I’ve seen the Pokémon box too many times now.\n\nThank you for the link also. I chose to put it here though because I already reported a whole wave of these in the same town some months back (can’t remember exactly) and I decided that this should be exposed since the abuser has no shame and just keeps doing their thing.\n\nI also feel Niantic should know this and honestly, it’s time to ban this person’s/group’s Wayfarer accounts. This is so far away from what Wayfarer is about and I think it’s important to send a signal to everyone that this is not at all acceptable.\n\nKnowing the games (particularly GO), they can probably just make new accounts and carry on their activitites… Not much (if anything at all) is ever done about multiple accounts in GO. One of the reasons I chose to close my account 2 yrs ago. It’s out of control.\n\n@NianticLC Hi, tagging you since kawin240 suggested your name. I’d love it if you and the team could go into this and get Ebberup cleaned up, so to speak."
