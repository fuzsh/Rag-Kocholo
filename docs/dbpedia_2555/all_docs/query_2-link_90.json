The Committee met, pursuant to notice, at 10 a.m. in room SD-G50, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Hon. Roger Wicker, Chairman of the Committee, presiding. Present: Senators Wicker [presiding], Cantwell, Capito, Blumenthal, Scott, Schatz, Gardner, Duckworth, Thune, Markey, Blackburn, Tester, Lee, Johnson, Udall, Blunt, Sinema, Sullivan, and Peters. OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. ROGER WICKER, U.S. SENATOR FROM MISSISSIPPI Senator Wicker. Good morning and welcome to today's hearing on The Oversight of the Federal Communications Commission. I'm glad to convene the hearing with my friend and colleague, Ranking Member Cantwell. I welcome our distinguished panel of witnesses and thank all of them for appearing. Today, we'll hear from FCC Chairman Ajit Pai, Commissioner Michael O'Rielly, Commissioner Benjamin Carr, Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel, and Commissioner Geoffrey Starks. One of the FCC's most important responsibilities is to promote the expansion of competitive telecommunications and broadband networks across the United States. Under Chairman Pai's leadership, the agency has taken steps to close the Digital Divide in Rural America. The Commission has promoted investment and innovation by addressing outdated rules and regulations and has also taken steps to enhance public safety, protect consumers, and improve transparency into agency actions. I commend the FCC for its efforts but note, as we would all agree, that more work remains. That work starts with closing the Digital Divide once and for all. Access to broadband is essential. Through Internet connectivity, Americans can access jobs, education, economic opportunities, good health, and entertainment. For too long, Americans across the Nation have gone without access to reliable high-speed Internet service simply because they live in the rural heartland. In previous hearings, we have discussed how inaccurate maps have contributed to the persistent broadband gap. It is clear to me that short of a completely new approach to developing accurate and reliable maps, the FCC should not move forward on broadband funding decisions until it gets the maps right. As a first step to improving the Nation's broadband maps, last month I introduced the Broadband Interagency Coordination Act with Senator Klobuchar. This legislation would improve coordination among Federal agencies that administer broadband deployment programs. It would also facilitate information gathering among the FCC, the NTIA, and the Department of Agriculture concerning broadband activity throughout the United States. Increased coordination will help target broadband resources to unserved areas and communities that lack access to Internet services. Today, I will introduce the Broadband Data Act with Senators Peters, Thune, and Klobuchar. This legislation would build upon better coordination among Federal agencies and would require the FCC to collect more granular data about where wired, fixed wireless, and satellite broadband is available and where it is not. I'm sure Commissioners will want to discuss today what the FCC is doing to collect more accurate data about broadband availability as well as how the Commission is verifying the data submitted by carriers. I also hope the Chairman will provide a status update on the Mobility Fund Phase II Program and discuss how the recently announced $20.4 billion Rural Digital Opportunity Fund will be used to close the Digital Divide. We must solve the problem and do so without further delays. The FCC's work also includes ensuring American leadership in 5G, which is critical for the continued economic well-being and security of the United States. The Commission has made real progress in bringing spectrum to market to foster the development of next generation networks. Mid-band spectrum is particularly important to the initial deployment of 5G, but the United States currently lags behind our competitors in the availability of mid-band spectrum. This morning's hearing is an opportunity for Commissioners to discuss the FCC's efforts to speed up the availability of mid-band spectrum for 5G and whether they believe congressional action is necessary to advance the Commission's work in this area. Winning the race to 5G is dependent on the security of the Nation's communications networks. I recently introduced bipartisan legislation, The United States 5G Leadership Act, with Senators Cotton, Warner, Markey, and Sullivan. This legislation would provide relief to providers that need to replace foreign equipment that may present a national security risk. The legislation would help improve information-sharing among the national security agencies and communications providers to address immediate threats to network security. I look forward to hearing what more the Commission and the entire Federal Government might do to improve security in the next generation of telecommunications infrastructure. Finally, let me commend the Commission for taking steps to expand telemedicine in rural areas through its proposed $100 million Connected Care Pilot Program. This program is inspired by the University of Mississippi Medical Center, which is a national trailblazer in telehealth. The Commission's focus on expanding connectivity through this program can help reduce the cost of care and improve patient outcomes, especially among the Nation's most underserved populations. Clearly, there's much to discuss today. I look forward to hearing testimony from the Commissioners and thank them for appearing. I will now turn to my good friend from the State of Washington, Senator Cantwell. STATEMENT OF HON. MARIA CANTWELL, U.S. SENATOR FROM WASHINGTON Senator Cantwell. Thank you, Chairman Wicker, and thank you for holding this important hearing and having the FCC Commissioners before us today. We have had two and a half of the last years in which I think a lot of the important issues that affect consumers before the FCC have been challenged, and I would say eviscerated, as opposed to the consumer interests that have been pushed forward. Last year, more than 20 million Americans wrote asking you to protect a free and open Internet, and instead net neutrality protections for consumers were repealed. Don't worry. Big cable companies will do the right thing by you. Just last week in my own state, Comcast was ordered to pay $9.1 million in fines for deceptive practices that affected 50,000 Washingtonians. And since the repeal of net neutrality, some wireless and broadband companies already appear to be testing ways to undermine the free and open internet. Wireless carriers have been accused of potentially throttling subscribers to Netflix and YouTube. CenturyLink temporarily blocked access to the Internet in Utah to force consumers to watch ads. Sprint allegedly interfered with competitive Skype services using wireless networks. So these are all questions that I will definitely be following up on in our Q&A session. But time and time again, big cable companies have prioritized their bottom lines over the fair treatment of consumers and the Internet economy, and we want to know that you are on the front line of consumer interests. When scientists and weather experts from outside and inside the Trump Administration warned that actions on spectrum could harm forecasting, their concerns were ignored. Peer-reviewed science research has concluded that without key vapor data, that could vanish due to actions on where spectrum has been allocated, that this could impact our weather forecasting. And despite the correct forecasting, if you consider that Sandy impacted hundreds of lives and caused $70 billion, getting that forecast wrong would have been deadly. I want to thank Chairman Wicker for agreeing to hold a hearing on this topic in the near future because I think it needs to be addressed in more detail. I also want to make sure that we are clear today we are not going to allow this vital information to be jeopardized in the future. We have also heard, at a time when motor vehicle accidents claim more than 37,000 lives in the United States each year, that the FCC is pushing to open up key spectrum that jeopardizes the promise of new technologies in this particular area that could prevent as many as 80 percent of those accidents. So just like spectrum and its important use in transportation, weather, launch forecasting, also the Chairman mentioned broadband. So we all agree that we need to make more access to Internet broadband equitable to Americans. He mentioned the issue that's so important to all of us, and that is rural telemedicine. But if we've failed at the FCC to collect accurate data about who has access to broadband and we don't have the right information, how can we ever fix the problem? I know that the FCC wants to put a cap on universal service, the most successful broadband deployment in the Nation's history, because they refuse to make the hard decisions about how to appropriately fund it. So I hope that we will hear about real solutions today and how we get through these challenging times and make sure that we are protecting the public interest. I know that in the Information Age, we're going to continue to grow and new products and services are going to be there, but we also have to make sure we are aggressive about doing our jobs and protecting that interest on behalf of the consumer. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Senator Wicker. Thank you very much, Senator Cantwell. And now we'll proceed with hearing opening statements from our panelists, and today, why don't we do it this way? Why don't we hear from Commissioner Pai first and then Ms. Rosenworcel, then Mr. O'Rielly, then Mr. Starks, and finally with Mr. Carr. So, Chairman Pai, welcome, and we are interested in hearing your five-minute statement. STATEMENT OF HON. AJIT PAI, CHAIRMAN, FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION Mr. Pai. Thank you, Chairman Wicker, Ranking Member Cantwell, Members of the Committee. Thank you for holding this hearing. I appreciate the opportunity to update you on the work of the Federal Communications Commission. For almost two and a half years, we have worked together with the Committee on a number of important priorities, from advancing our Nation's leadership in 5G, including the 24 gigahertz ban, to tackling robocalls, our Number 1 consumer complaint. For example, last week, the FCC made clear that voice service providers may block unwanted robocalls by default and last month, the Senate passed the TRACED Act, important legislation that I hope soon becomes law. I'm optimistic that steps like these will make a significant dent in this problem. This morning, I'd like to focus on my top priority, closing the Digital Divide. The FCC has taken many steps to better enable the private sector to deploy broadband infrastructure, from eliminating unnecessary regulatory burdens to modernizing our rules to make it easier to replace copper with fiber, to groundbreaking reforms, like One Touch Make Ready. The good news is that we're headed in the right direction. Investment in our Nation's broadband networks rose in 2018 for a second straight year by an estimated $3 billion. Fiber was deployed to more new homes in 2018 than any year before and small cell deployment more than quadrupled. Additionally, Internet speeds are up 40 percent year over year. We're also maximizing the impact of the Universal Service Fund with aggressive reforms that will deliver more broadband to more Americans. Last year, we finished the Connect America Fund Phase II Reverse Auction. Through this novel approach, we are now awarding about $1.5 billion to connect almost 700,000 unserved homes and businesses nationwide. We are distributing this funding much more efficiently thanks in part to competitive bidding, saving $3.5 billion from the $5 billion price tag we initially thought would be required to connect these unserved areas. These dollars are making a real difference. To date, the Commission has authorized $278 million for the build-out of high-speed Internet service to almost 100,000 unserved locations in 27 states. Among other construction, these applicants will be deploying gigabit fiber to locations in rural Hawaii, Kansas, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Missouri, and Tennessee. I saw a glimpse of the exciting future ahead for consumers in these areas during a recent visit to the East Central Electric Cooperative in Okmulgee, Oklahoma. Thanks in part to FCC funding, this electrical cooperative will build gigabit speed connections to thousands of locations in Rural America, including many tribal residents of the Creek Nation. Now our efforts don't stop there, we reformed the FCC's A- CAM Program last December and as a result, 186 small rural carriers have now accepted $657 million in additional support to connect 106,000 more rural homes and small businesses. This is a 31 percent overall increase in the number of locations that will have 25 megabit per second service and some states will see a much larger increase, 114 percent in Arizona and 105 percent in Montana. At the same time, we increased the funding of small rural carriers that rely on the FCC's Legacy cost-based support mechanism and we increased their obligations accordingly. Under the prior Administration's rules, these carriers were only required to provide 10 megabit per second service to about 115,000 locations. Under our new rules, these same carriers will have to provide 25 megabit per second service to more than 600,000 locations, and we initiated the second round of A-CAM offers to these carriers in exchange for building out 25 megabit per second broadband to all fully funded locations in those service areas. If all carriers accept offers, over 1.1 million locations will have 25 megabit service, including 58,000 locations in Texas, 42,000 in Indiana, and 36,000 in Missouri, and that's not all. In the coming months, we will begin a rulemaking to establish a $20 billion Rural Digital Opportunity Fund to spur the deployment of high-speed broadband networks and bring greater economic opportunities to Rural America over the next decade. This program will bring broadband to over four million rural homes and small businesses. Now while we continue our work closing the Digital Divide, we also understand the importance of improving our broadband deployment maps and that is why I am pleased to announce this morning that, after a thorough review of the record and the painstaking work of our career staff, I intend to recirculate a report and Order of the FCC's monthly meeting in August that would result in more granular and more accurate broadband maps. That means requiring broadband providers to report where they actually offer service below the census block level and looking to incorporate public feedback into our mapping efforts. I hope my colleagues will join me in this effort to improve upon our maps and I look forward to working with you on that effort. Chairman Wicker, Ranking Member Cantwell, Members of the Committee, thank you once again for inviting me to testify. I look forward to answering your questions and continuing to work with you in the days to come. [The prepared statement of Mr. Pai follows:] Prepared Statement of Hon. Ajit Pai, Chairman, Federal Communications Commission Chairman Wicker, Ranking Member Cantwell, and Members of the Committee, thank you for holding this hearing. I appreciate this opportunity to update you on the work of the Federal Communications Commission to advance the public interest. I'd like to lead off by saying how proud I am of the dedicated staff of the Commission. They come to work every day eager to carry out their mission to close the digital divide, promote innovation, protect consumers and public safety, and improve the FCC's processes and programs. It has been a privilege to work alongside them at the FCC's headquarters and in the field. They exemplify what it means to be public servants. For almost two-and-a-half years, we have worked together to achieve the priorities I set at the beginning of my chairmanship--most notably, the top priority of closing the digital divide. The Commission has taken a variety of steps to better enable the private sector to deploy broadband infrastructure. For example, last year, we made it easier and cheaper for competitive providers to attach fiber to utility poles through a groundbreaking reform called ``one-touch make ready.'' Of course, there are some areas where the business case for broadband deployment just won't exist--no matter how much red tape we cut. These are typically rural areas with sparser populations and lower incomes. The FCC manages programs to connect these rural communities through the Universal Service Fund. Here, we've been aggressively taking action to maximize the USF's impact--to stretch scarce dollars as far as we can. Last year, we finished the Connect America Fund Phase II reverse auction. Through this novel approach, we're now awarding about $1.5 billion to connect over 713,000 unserved homes and businesses nationwide. Before the auction, we identified parts of our country that were unserved by broadband. This was so that we could target funding to leverage--not displace--private capital expenditures. We didn't want to fund overbuilding. We also made sure the auction was open to providers of all types, including rural telecom, cable, fixed wireless, and satellite companies, as well as electric utilities. This ensured that there would be plenty of competition. The outcome of the auction was a tremendous success. We distributed funding much more efficiently thanks in part to intermodal, competitive bidding, saving $3.5 billion from the $5 billion price we initially thought would be required to connect these unserved areas. And consumers are getting high-quality broadband--99.7 percent of the winning bids are to provide consumers with service of at least 25/3 Mbps. On Monday, we gave final approval to a second round of auction funding that will provide $166.8 million over the next decade to expand broadband to 60,850 locations in 22 states (including Arizona, Kansas, Missouri, Nevada, New Mexico, and Tennessee). This money will begin flowing by the end of the month. In May, we gave final approval to the first batch of applications to expand service to 37,148 rural homes and businesses in 12 states, and these funds have already started reaching broadband providers. Among other construction, these applicants will be deploying gigabit fiber to thousands of locations in rural Missouri and Hawaii. To date, the Commission has authorized $278.4 million over the next decade for buildout of high-speed Internet service to 97,998 unserved locations. I saw a glimpse of the exciting future ahead for consumers in these areas during a recent visit to East Central Electric Cooperative in Okmulgee, Oklahoma. Thanks in part to CAF funding from the FCC, this electric cooperative will build gigabit-speed connections to thousands of locations in rural Oklahoma, including many Tribal residents of Creek Nation. Moreover, last December, we implemented reforms to the FCC's Alternative Connect America Cost Model (A-CAM). As a result, a total of 186 small, rural carriers participating in the A-CAM program have now accepted $657 million in additional support over the next decade to provide 106,000 more rural homes and small businesses with 25/3 Mbps broadband service. This represents a 31.8 percent increase in the number of locations that will have high-quality service available through the FCC's A-CAM program. And the increase is much larger in many states, such as 123 percent in New Mexico, 114 percent in Arizona, and 105.4 percent in Montana. In December, for the first time we also began requiring that small, rural carriers that continue to rely on the Commission's legacy, cost- based support mechanism provide 25/3 Mbps broadband service to specific numbers of rural homes and small businesses in their service areas. Under the prior Administration's rules, these carriers were only required to provide 10/1 Mbps service to 115,441 locations; under our new rules, these same carriers will have to provide 25/3 Mbps broadband to at least 600,535 locations. At the same time, we also initiated a second round of A-CAM offers of fixed, model-based support for a term of ten years to these carriers, in exchange for building out 25/3 Mbps broadband to all fully-funded locations in their service areas. If all legacy-reliant carriers accept the new A-CAM offers, they will be required to provide 25/3 Mbps service to at least 1,126,082 locations. This would include 58,000 locations in Texas and Iowa, 42,000 locations in Indiana, and 36,000 locations in Missouri. Last year, we took other steps through the Fund to help close the digital divide. For example, we increased the annual cap on rural healthcare program spending by nearly 43 percent to $571 million per year and implemented ongoing annual inflation adjustments--the first increase in the program's funding level since it was established in the 1990s. In addition, in June 2018, we established a process to carry- forward unused rural healthcare program funds from past funding years for use in future funding years. This sensible modification means an additional $83 million can be used in funding year 2019 that will help to provide critical connectivity to rural healthcare institutions. Going forward, we plan to continue our emphasis on closing the digital divide. Later this year, for instance, we will begin a rulemaking to establish a $20.4 billion Rural Digital Opportunity Fund. Applying lessons learned from the Connect America Fund Phase II reverse auction, this program will spur the deployment of high-speed broadband networks across more of rural America over the next decade, bringing greater economic opportunities to America's heartland. Service providers that win funding in the reverse auction will deploy needed infrastructure to provide up to gigabit-speed broadband in the parts of the country most in need of connectivity. I'm excited about this program--it will be the FCC's single biggest step yet to close the digital divide and will connect up to 4,000,000 rural homes and small businesses to high-speed broadband networks. Of course, it is vital that we spend USF funds wisely and eliminate waste, fraud, and abuse in these programs. That's why recently, we developed a reorganization plan to create a Fraud Division within the Enforcement Bureau. I am pleased that this proposal was unanimously endorsed by the Commission and cleared by the Office of Management and Budget. This reform will embed a permanent effort to combat USF fraud within the structure of the Enforcement Bureau. Another critical Commission priority is to maintain and advance our Nation's leadership in 5G, the next generation of wireless connectivity. 5G networks will be 100 times faster than today's networks, perhaps more. They will have lag times that are one-tenth of what they are today. And they'll have much more capacity, being able to connect as many as one million devices per square kilometer. Our work on 5G will open the door to new services and applications that will grow our economy and improve our standard of living. Smart transportation networks will link connected cars--reducing traffic, preventing accidents, and limiting pollution. Ubiquitous wireless sensors will enable healthcare professionals to remotely monitor your health and transmit data to your doctor before problems become emergencies. Connected devices will empower farms to apply precision agriculture. And there will be more innovations that we can't even conceive of today. These breakthroughs will boost our economy. One study pegs 5G's potential at three million new jobs, $275 billion in private investment, and $500 billion in new economic growth. And that should not be news to the members of this Committee, which has taken the lead in ensuring America's leadership in 5G by passing laws like the MOBILE NOW Act. To realize this potential, we've developed and are executing the 5G FAST plan--a comprehensive strategy that will ``Facilitate America's Superiority in 5G Technology.'' It has three key components: (1) pushing more spectrum into the marketplace; (2) promoting the deployment of wireless infrastructure; and (3) modernizing outdated regulations. In my testimony today, I'd like to concentrate on the first prong, spectrum. The applications and services of tomorrow will require much more bandwidth. They cannot be developed and deployed without spectrum. This critical resource represents the lifeblood of the communications industry--and with it, the future of our economy. That's why the FCC must continue its work to aggressively make more spectrum available for commercial use. Last year, I stated that the FCC would hold two high-band spectrum auctions during this Fiscal Year: one for the 28 GHz band and another for the 24 GHz band. And I noted that conducting these auctions successfully and promptly would be important to U.S. leadership in 5G. I am pleased to report that we have done what I said we would do. Our 28 GHz auction began last November and concluded this January. All in all, bidders won 2,965 licenses, and the auction raised $700,309,809 in net bids for the U.S. Treasury. Our 24 GHz auction began in March and concluded in May. In this auction, bidders won 2,904 licenses, and the auction raised $2,022,676,752 in net bids. These auctions are significant accomplishments, but the FCC cannot and will not rest on our laurels. Instead, we will continue to free up spectrum for commercial use. Starting on December 10, we will hold an auction of the upper 37 GHz, 39 GHz, and 47 GHz bands. This auction will be the largest in American history, releasing 3,400 megahertz of spectrum into the commercial marketplace. All in all, these auctions will free up for the commercial marketplace over 5 gigahertz of spectrum for flexible use. For context, that's more spectrum than is currently used for mobile broadband by all mobile broadband providers in the United States combined. We are also taking aggressive action on mid-band spectrum, important spectrum given the desirable combination of coverage and capacity that these bands offer for wireless services. Next year, we intend to auction mid-band spectrum in the 3.5 GHz band. However, we expect to authorize initial commercial deployments in this band later this summer--well ahead of the auction--after we complete our review of the laboratory test results from the first group of spectrum access systems. And we intend to take action to make available more spectrum in the 2.5 GHz and 3.7-4.2 GHz bands in the coming months. Notably, the MOBILE NOW Act also required the Department of Commerce to evaluate the sharing of the 3.1-3.55 GHz band with commercial operators. Although the Department has only announced that it has started looking at a small portion of that band--the upper 100 megahertz--we look forward to working with our Federal partners on how to effectuate the widespread sharing of the full 450 megahertz of this prime mid-band spectrum. As part of our balanced spectrum strategy, we have also been working to make more spectrum available for unlicensed use. Earlier this year, for example, we allocated over 21 gigahertz of spectrum in the Spectrum Horizons bands for unlicensed operations. And we are continuing our effort to open up a large amount of unlicensed spectrum in the 6 GHz band (while safeguarding incumbents with innovative technologies and sharing techniques). This will make sure we get the most use of this limited, essential resource and deliver consumer value. The next priority I'll discuss is our important mission to protect public safety. Here, the Commission has been extremely active, both proactively and in response to emergencies that have arisen, such as Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, Maria, and Michael. Last year, for example, we took important steps to improve Wireless Emergency Alerts, which play a critical role in notifying Americans when emergencies strike. We adopted an order that requires the delivery of more precise, geographically targeted alerts so that the alerts reach only those communities impacted by an emergency. The order also adopted rules to enable the public to better review emergency information by requiring that alert messages remain available on wireless devices for at least 24 hours after receipt, or until consumers choose to delete it. Last year, we also took important steps to improve the reliability and effectiveness of the Emergency Alert System, or EAS. For example, we adopted an order that authorizes ``live code'' testing of EAS--that is, the testing of the same alert codes and processes that would be used in actual emergencies--but also requires clear messaging and outreach to make sure the public knows they are receiving a test message, not an actual emergency alert. And to reduce the risk and impact of false alerts, the order requires new safeguards in the configuration of EAS equipment and also requires broadcasters, cable systems, and other EAS participants to notify the Commission's 24/7 operations center when they discover they have transmitted a false alert. We have also taken steps to ensure that Americans in need can reach someone who can help and that emergency responders can more quickly locate Americans in need. For instance, we have proposed rules to implement Kari's Law--and I would like to thank the members of this Committee again for making this vital 911 improvement law a reality. Kari's Law requires multi-line telephone systems--which commonly serve hotels, office buildings, and campuses--to enable users to dial 911 directly. And it also contains a notification requirement so that when a 911 call is made in these settings, a front desk or security office will be alerted to facilitate building entry by first responders. In March, we also proposed rules to help first responders more precisely locate wireless 911 callers in multi-story buildings. Specifically, we proposed a vertical, or ``z-axis'' metric to our location accuracy rules that would enable 911 call centers and emergency responders to figure out on what floor wireless 911 callers are located. In the coming year, the Commission intends to take final action to improve our location accuracy rules and implement Kari's Law. Our work in this area also extends to national security. When it comes to the security of our communications networks, we cannot afford to make risky choices and just hope for the best. We must have a clear view of the threats we face and take action to respond to those threats. That ethos extends to our review of foreign companies that seek to do business in the United States. At our May open meeting, for example, the Commission advanced our national security by denying the application of China Mobile USA, a wireless carrier ultimately owned by the Chinese government, to provide international telecommunications services in the United States. The process that yielded decision reflects the well-considered, fully-integrated approach of the FCC and Administration to the national security implications of communications networks. The FCC solicited the views of the relevant Federal agencies on whether China Mobile's application raised national security, law enforcement, or related concerns. After a lengthy review of the application and in consultation with the U.S. intelligence community, in 2018, the Executive Branch agencies recommended that the FCC deny China Mobile USA's application due to substantial national security and law enforcement concerns. Notably, this was the first time the Executive Branch had ever recommended that the FCC deny an application due to national security concerns. Based on this recommendation and the full public record in this proceeding, I determined that approving this application would not serve the public interest and the Commission voted to deny China Mobile USA's application. I'm pleased my colleagues agreed with me. Our cross-agency efforts extend to the international stage. Last month, I was honored to be part of the United States delegation that traveled to Prague for an important conference on how best to secure our 5G networks. I'm grateful to the leaders of the Czech Republic's government for convening this meeting, which featured government officials from more than 30 countries, as well as industry leaders. I'm even more gratified that this gathering was able to develop a set of consensus best practices for 5G security. Dubbed the Prague Proposals, these guiding principles fall into four categories: policy, technology, economy, and security.\\1\\ And the fact that proposals gained such wide support was due in part to the close collaboration among U.S. government agencies, including the FCC, and direct engagement on the international stage. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\1\\ The Prague Proposals issued following the Prague 5G Security Conference are available at https://www.vlada.cz/en/media-centrum/ aktualne/prague-5g-security-conference-announced-series-of- recommendations-the-prague-proposals-173422/. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Going forward, we will continue to prioritize the security of our communications networks. We are working with our Federal partners to implement Executive Order 13,873, the President's May 15 Order on Securing the Information and Communications Technology and Services Supply Chain, and section 889 of the John S. McCain National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019. We are in turn examining the impact of these developments on the FCC's 2018 proposal to ban the use of money from the Universal Service Fund to procure equipment or services from companies that pose a national security threat to our communications networks or the communications supply chain. And we have followed with interest the bipartisan introduction of the United States 5G Leadership Act of 2019, which would create a Supply Chain Security Trust Fund to aid small carriers in replacing such equipment. The last priority I'll mention--but certainly not the least important--involves attacking unwanted and illegal robocalls. During my tenure as FCC Chairman, I've had the opportunity to set the agenda for 28 monthly meetings. At almost half of those meetings, we've voted on measures to fight unlawful robocalls and caller ID spoofing. We've taken action to cut off robocalls and spoofing at the source, including authorizing carriers to stop certain spoofed robocalls. We've authorized the creation of a reassigned numbers database. We've taken aggressive enforcement action against those who unleash robocalls on consumers. We've proposed to use the authority Congress gave us in last year's RAY BAUM'S Act to expand the reach of our anti-spoofing rules. Most recently, last week we made clear that voice service providers may block unwanted robocalls by default and sought comment on creating a safe harbor for providers who block such calls that fail Caller ID authentication. I'm optimistic that these steps will make a significant dent in this problem, which generates the most consumer complaints to the Commission. An important coda on Caller ID authentication framework, which can help combat illegal caller ID spoofing: Call authentication is the best way to ensure that consumers can answer their phones with confidence. It will help consumers know when a phone call is fraudulent before they pick up, thus eroding the ability of scam artists to use false caller ID information to trick vulnerable Americans into answering their phones when they shouldn't. With a robust framework in place, consumers and law enforcement alike will be able to more readily identify the source of illegally spoofed robocalls and reduce their impact. I have repeatedly demanded that major carriers implement the SHAKEN/STIR Caller ID authentication framework by the end of 2019. If they do not, the Commission has taken the necessary steps to be move directly to final regulations early next year to require that they do so. Our work here is fully in line with, and a complement to, the important work this Committee has done in crafting the Telephone Robocall Abuse Criminal Enforcement and Deterrence Act, or TRACED Act-- important legislation that I hope soon becomes the law of the land. In addition, the Commission continues to aggressively enforce the Telephone Consumer Protection Act as well as the Truth in Caller ID Act. We have sent a clear message that those who engage in illegal robocall schemes will pay a price. The FCC coordinates with the Federal Trade Commission on investigations into violations of our Do Not Call rules, and we work together on consumer education programs. The Commission also works with Federal and state agencies to share information and resources that can be used to investigate unwanted calls, such as the Department of the Treasury, Department of Justice, and Department of Homeland Security. Finally, we alert consumers about robocall scams, such as a recent ``one-ring'' advisory issued this month warning consumers about scam calls using three-digit country codes for Mauritania or Sierra Leone and hanging up after a single ring.\\2\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\2\\ The `` `One-Ring' Phone Scam'' advisory is available at https:/ /www.fcc.gov/consumers/guides/one-ring-phone-scam. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- * * * I would like to conclude by once again thanking our dedicated staff. Day in and day out, they work hard to advance the public interest. Whether they are working to combat robocalls, expand broadband deployment, promote wireless innovation, protect public safety, or address consumer complaints, they serve the American people with skill and dedication, and I am honored to have them as colleagues. Thank you for this opportunity to testify. I will be pleased to answer any questions that you may have. Senator Wicker. Thank you very much, Commissioner Pai, and we appreciate that announcement. Commissioner Rosenworcel, welcome back to the Committee. STATEMENT OF HON. JESSICA ROSENWORCEL, COMMISSIONER, FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION Ms. Rosenworcel. Good morning, Chairman Wicker, Ranking Member Cantwell, and Members of the Committee. Thank you for the opportunity to be here today. I believe the future belongs to the connected. No matter who you are or where you live in this country, you need access to modern communications to have a fair shot at 21st Century success, and I saw this just over a month ago in Washington State where, with the Ranking Member of this Committee, I met a fisherman who suffered a stroke. He was from Shaw Island, a population of 165. Now that's not a place with a big health care facility, but he was diagnosed remotely and airlifted to a hospital for surgery and telemedicine made it possible. Just last week, I saw something similar at the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota where heart patients can be sent home with a wearable patch to monitor cardiac activity, offering continuous care outside of the hospital. But the story that stays with me most is from Arkansas and the Upper Delta. This is an area with a proud history. It's known the world over for the rice its fields produce. It was where Johnny Cash spent his childhood and where Ernest Hemingway penned A Farewell to Arms in a barn. But this region is also on the leading edge of an ugly trend and that's increasing maternal mortality. You see, the United States is the only industrialized nation with a growing rate of maternal mortality and it hits women of color especially hard but in rural communities across the country, obstetric care is disappearing. Half of our rural counties no longer have a hospital with a maternity ward and in light of this, this team of health care professionals I met at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences decided they were going to do something about it. They described for me a typical patient in the Upper Delta and she had been diagnosed with pre-eclampsia, a hypertensive disorder that is a leading cause of maternal mortality, and to manage this disorder monitoring is key. But this patient lives in a rural area. In fact, she had to drive several hours just to give birth at a specialty hospital. There's just no way she was going to make the same drive on a daily basis during the weeks after delivery. So this team of health care professionals, they got creative. They sent her home with a blood pressure cuff, a digital scale, and a pulse oximeter to measure the levels of oxygen in her blood and she was told just connect all of these devices to a wireless gateway and transmit daily readings to the medical center. This was great, except for one small detail. The patient had no wireless service at home. As she described it, she lived in a dead zone. So every day after performing these rituals, she climbed in her truck, drove up to the top of a hill a mile away, and then sent the data along. Now I can't stop thinking about that story because it tells us about the power of communications but it reminds us of how too many people in too many places in this country are still struggling to connect and during the past 2 years, I don't think the Federal Communications Commission has done enough to address this problem. For starters, we don't even know with certainty where broadband and wireless service is throughout the country. Our broadband maps are a mess. One cabinet official recently called them ``fake news.'' The FCC distributes billions each year to help build broadband but it's wasteful and irresponsible to continue to do so without a truly accurate picture of where service is and is not. On top of this, we have done too little to fix robocalls. At the start of this Administration, consumers received about two billion robocalls a month. They now get about five billion a month. That's crazy. Last week, the FCC took steps to authorize phone companies to deploy new blocking technology to help with this problem, but here's the kicker. Nothing in this decision prevents carriers from charging consumers for this blocking technology. I think robocall solutions should be free to consumers, full stop. They didn't cause this mess on their phone lines. They shouldn't have to pay to fix it. Finally, privacy matters. Recent press reports show that for a few hundred dollars some shady middlemen can sell you your location within a few hundred meters based on your wireless phone data. I don't recall consenting to this surveillance when I signed up for wireless service and I bet neither do you. Think about what the sale of this data means for criminal activity and domestic abuse. It's chilling. This is a matter that's crying out for clarity but so far, the FCC has been totally silent. That's unacceptable. It's time for the agency to hold those who violated the law responsible and make clear to the American public that their wireless location data is safe. In closing, we have problems to solve, resources that are constrained and communities that are having difficulty navigating the Digital Age. The right communications policies can help and they can even help solve hard problems, like maternal mortality, but the way to do this is have the FCC change course and put the public first. Thank you. I look forward to answering any questions you may have. [The prepared statement of Ms. Rosenworcel follows:] Prepared Statement of Hon. Jessica Rosenworcel, Commissioner, Federal Communications Commission Good morning, Chairman Wicker, Ranking Member Cantwell, and Members of the Committee. Thank you for the opportunity to appear before you today. I believe the future belongs to the connected. No matter who you are or where you live in this country you need access to modern communications to have a fair shot at 21st century success. Clearing the way for this connected future should be at the heart of everything we do at the Federal Communications Commission. I believe we can do this when we focus on the most basic values in our laws: universal service, consumer protection, competition, and public safety. It saddens me that during the past two years, we have not led with these values. Instead, too often this agency has acted at the behest of the corporate forces that surround it, shortchanging the American people. You see this clearly in our inability to bring broadband to underserved communities and our bungled efforts to produce an accurate map showing where high-speed service is and is not all across the country. You see it in our slow and tepid response to the robocall epidemic. You see it, too, in the mess we made with our roll back of net neutrality and in our failure to offer anything but total silence in response to revelations that our privacy has been violated with the sale of sensitive wireless location data on our phones. I am disappointed that the FCC has failed to show the courage I believe is necessary to take on these big challenges. Because on top of these, so many others lie ahead: our leadership in 5G wireless, the extraordinary cybersecurity challenges facing our networks, and the need for a bolder national broadband goal of 100 megabits per second with gigabit speeds in sight--everywhere and for everyone. Our challenges with 5G leadership are particularly acute. There is widespread agreement that to get 5G out of dense cities and into rural America, we need mid-band spectrum to do it. However, the FCC has made zero mid-band spectrum available at auction for the 5G economy. Instead, we are doubling down with auction after auction of high-band spectrum that is too costly to deploy in rural areas. By doing so we are expanding the digital divide--when we should be collapsing it. Moreover, we are creating a gap between the airwaves used for 5G in the United States and the rest of the world, as China, Japan, South Korea, Australia, Spain, Italy, Austria, Switzerland, Germany, and others put a premium on early 5G deployment with mid-band spectrum. Our choice to focus just on high-band airwaves with limited propagation has consequences--less scale, greater interoperability challenges, and limited prospects for service in remote communities. The truth is we have problems to solve, resources that are constrained, and communities that are having difficulty navigating the digital age. I still believe that the right communications policies can help. They can help students caught in the homework gap, stuck without the Internet service they need to do their nightly schoolwork. They can help expand the use of telemedicine to tackle our hardest healthcare challenges, like the increasing rate of maternal mortality in this country. They can help make us safer, with improved 911 service in all of our communities. They can help make our democracy stronger, if we can commit to media policies that can ensure news organizations can report without fear or favor. I believe it is not too late to change course. It is not too late to refocus our attention on our most basic values--universal service, consumer protection, competition, and public safety. To that end, I have some ideas about where we can start to regain what has been lost. Universal Service Universal service is a cherished value in communications law. As I noted at the outset, no matter who you are or where you live in this country, you need access to modern communications to have a fair shot at 21st century success. But the fact of the matter is that too many Americans lack access to broadband. According to the FCC's last-published report, over 21 million Americans do not have access to high-speed Internet service, the bulk of them in rural areas. That's troubling. But even more troubling is that there is no way this statistic is truly credible. Our methodology--assuming a single broadband customer in a census block means service is available throughout--is inadequate. How inadequate? Consider that another study found that 162 million people across the United States do not use Internet service at broadband speeds. That turns our digital divide into a yawning chasm. We have to figure out what is going on. It is becoming clear that the FCC does not have the full picture of just where service is and is not all across the country. This is unacceptable. It is time to fix this mess with accurate and honest broadband and wireless maps. This is essential because we will never be able to manage problems that we do not measure. I am not the only one who feels this way. In a congressional hearing earlier this year, a cabinet official pronounced the FCC's maps ``fake news.'' We need to do better. Our wired maps have serious inaccuracies. Our wireless maps are so suspect they are now the subject of an ongoing investigation. To fix our maps, we need to be creative. We should use crowdsourcing, spot checking, auditing, and processes to challenge these maps based on our lived experience. But above all, we should stop taking data from carriers and simply assuming every bit of it is true. Getting this right matters. If we don't have proper maps, we will not be able to target policy solutions effectively. The FCC distributes billions of dollars each year to help accelerate the build out of broadband, so we can connect all of our communities. It's wasteful and irresponsible for the agency to do so without having a truly accurate picture of where these resources should go. Consumer Protection Consumer protection is always in the public interest. It requires the FCC to be nimble, especially as the communications industry changes at a breakneck pace. But our efforts to stem the growing tide of robocalls have been anything but. At the start of this Administration, American consumers received roughly 2 billion robocalls a month. That number is now about 5 billion a month. That is about two thousand robocalls every second every day. That's insane. To tackle this mess, the FCC has tried to take on bad actors flooding our lines with these nuisance calls. But as the Wall Street Journal reports, out of the hundreds of millions of fines the FCC has assessed on these bad actors, the agency has collected no more than a grand total of $6,790. It's clear the FCC's enforcement is not working. This is like trying to empty the ocean with a teaspoon. Earlier this month, the FCC decided to take a different approach. The good news is that it authorized phone companies to deploy technology to block robocalls across the network, unless a consumer opts out. The bad news is that nothing in this decision prevents carriers from charging consumers for this blocking technology to stop robocalls. I think robocall solutions should be free to consumers. In fact, I wrote major phone companies in December of last year to demand that they provide free robocall blocking tools to consumers. Consumers didn't cause this mess on their phone lines. They shouldn't have to pay up to fix it. That's because consumers are already paying the price--in scams flooding our phone lines; wasted time responding to false and fraudulent calls offering us what we did not ask for, do not want, and do not need; and a growing distrust in communications networks. It's disappointing that the FCC couldn't simply do what consumers want most--stop robocalls and do it for free. Competition Competition is fundamental. It yields lower prices and higher quality services. But right now, too few households have any choice when it comes to high-speed broadband service. I know this personally, because I'm one of them. But I also know this professionally, because the FCC's data show that half the households in this country have no choice of broadband provider. This is one of the reasons why the FCC adopted net neutrality rules a few years back. With these rules in place, your broadband provider does not have the right to block websites, throttle online services, or censor online content. That sounds good to me--and to American consumers everywhere. In fact, a study from the University of Maryland found that 86 percent of the public support net neutrality. But, the FCC--over my objection--stripped net neutrality from our rules. Now, because of the lack of competition, consumers have nowhere to turn if their broadband provider slows down their service or censors websites. This is not right. Moreover, in its haste to roll back net neutrality, the agency used a process that should make no one proud. The record was rife with fraud. More than nine million people--including United States Senators--had their identities stolen and used to file views about net neutrality that were not their own. This is a crime under state and Federal laws. However, the FCC refused to assist state authorities looking to understand how this happened and turned away requests from journalists seeking information about this mess. The agency was forced to pay one journalist tens of thousands of dollars to settle a court case and is actively fighting others in court. All of which begs the question, what is the FCC hiding? Earlier this year, I was the only FCC Commissioner to sit through the oral argument at the court reviewing the FCC decision to eradicate net neutrality. What was obvious to me is that some part of our decision--if not all of it--will be remanded to us. When that happens, I hope that this agency will have the courage to run a fair and open process. I hope that it will reflect the strong desire of the American public to have open Internet policies once again be the law of the land. Public Safety Finally, public safety is paramount. In the very first sentence of the Communications Act, Congress instructed the FCC to make available, ``to all the people of the United States . . . a rapid, efficient, Nation-wide, and world-wide radio and communication service'' in order to promote the ``safety of life and property.'' At about this time last year, press reports revealed that wireless carriers were selling our private data about when and where we are using our phones to third-party location aggregators. Then, earlier this year, it was revealed that this data was still for sale--and ending up in the hands of bounty hunters. It turns out that for a few hundred dollars, shady middlemen could use this data to show where you were at any moment within a few hundred meters. This is outrageous. I don't recall consenting to have my wireless location data sold this way--and yet it has been happening. I don't see how this is permissible under the law--and yet it has been happening. This is an issue of personal and national security. It is an issue of privacy. Think about what the sale of this data means for criminal activity and domestic abuse. It's chilling. This is a matter that is crying out for clarity from the FCC. But to date, the agency has been totally silent. That's unacceptable. I believe the FCC needs to do more to provide the public with basic information about what is happening with their real-time location information. So I wrote every major wireless carrier and asked them to confirm that they have stopped this kind of sale of our wireless data. Moreover, I asked them to explain just what has happened to any data that has already been made available to location aggregators or anyone else. I made their responses public. To date, this is the only information publicly available about this practice. It's not enough. It's time--past time--for the FCC to hold those who violated the law responsible and make clear to the American public that their wireless location data is safe. In closing, thank you for holding this hearing. Thank you for providing me with the opportunity to offer my views. I look forward to answering any questions you may have and I look forward to working with you and your staff in the days ahead. Senator Wicker. Thank you, Commissioner. Commissioner O'Rielly, welcome back to the Committee. STATEMENT OF HON. MICHAEL O'RIELLY, COMMISSIONER, FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION Mr. O'Rielly. Thank you, sir. Thank you, Chairman Wicker, Ranking Member Cantwell, and the Members of the Committee. It is a pleasure to be before this body as it conducts further oversight of the FCC. With your indulgence, I'd like to raise three areas of communications infrastructure for the Committee's attention. First, spectrum. I believe there's near universal agreement to free up additional mid-band spectrum given its propagation characteristics and opportunities for global spectrum harmonization. Continuing what Chairman Pai has put in motion, the Commission must redouble its efforts to allocate additional mid-band frequencies for the next generation license services. Part of this must be reallocating a portion of the 3.7 to 4.2 gigahertz band or the C-band. One of my foremost concerns is to ensure that the mechanisms selected allow for the quickest possible process, and I remain hopeful that satellite incumbents will be willing to part with closer to 300 megahertz. Separately, there needs to be a greater effort to identify more Federal bands that can be converted to commercial use. Moreover, the Commission must free additional unlicensed spectrum. Second, while broadband availability has improved over the years, many unserved areas remain and we must continue our efforts to expand access in an efficient and timely manner. At the same time, I worry that the well-intentioned desire of Congress or selected agencies to expand broadband infrastructure will lead to unexpected wasteful and duplicative spending with adverse consequences for consumers. Specifically, it is my foremost desire that any new funding go to unserved areas rather than areas where broadband service already exists. Coordination among various agencies and departments is helpful but only through clear legislative directions, like that in the Broadband Interagency Coordination Act of 2019, to ensure funding does not duplicate existing programs and goes to only those Americans without broadband today. The last issue I want to touch upon is 9-1-1 fee diversion. Every month, millions of consumers pay their phone bills only to see a good portion of the money flowing to a state or territory's general treasury and as a result, only a small percentage goes toward emergency services. On top of being downright deceptive, this is a serious public safety matter that directly affects emergency call centers and personnel. Following the FCC's December report the states and territories guilty of diverting these critical funds for 2017 were New York, New Jersey, Rhode Island, Montana, Nevada, West Virginia, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. I respectfully request the Committee's assistance. The name and shame process generated by our annual report has only been so helpful. I believe new legislation is needed and it'll take a more forceful approach to end diversion once and for all. Thank you for inviting me to testify. I welcome any questions you may have. [The prepared statement of Mr. O'Rielly follows:] Prepared Statement of Hon. Michael O'Rielly, Commissioner, Federal Communications Commission Good morning. It is a pleasure to appear before this Committee once again, as it conducts further oversight of the Federal Communications Commission. I appreciate the opportunity to be here and welcome any questions you may have. In approaching the current communications landscape, the Committee and the Commission have been focused on the changing nature of the industry, whether in terms of technological advancement, modern networks, or present-day markets. Under Chairman Pai's leadership, the Commission has made a strong effort to modernize our regulations to keep pace with these changes. Make no mistake, this is hard work. However, we have made progress despite the headwinds, and I am excited to see further growth and strengthening of our Nation's communications infrastructure over the coming months and years. In considering the many different areas of communications policy ripe for discussion at today's hearing, I decided to narrow my testimony to four issues that are of particular importance to me: first and foremost, the need to quickly deploy more mid-band spectrum; second, the urgent need to prevent taxpayer-funded overbuilding of existing infrastructure; third, the need to end theft of 9-1-1 fees by states for unrelated programs; and finally, the need to address illegal robocalls while protecting legal communications. I am happy to answer your questions on these or other topics. Freeing Additional Spectrum, Especially in the Mid Bands The Commission continues to make great strides to ensure U.S. leadership in 5G by allocating the necessary millimeter wave frequencies. Over the past three years, however, I have focused most of my energy on crucial mid-band spectrum. There is now near universal acceptance that far more needs to be done to free up additional mid- band spectrum given its propagation characteristics and opportunities for global spectral harmonization. Finding additional mid-band spectrum is extremely hard. There is no fallow spectrum, incumbent users are everywhere, and a multitude of interested parties have different and often conflicting visions, interests, and needs. I faced these issues head-on when I led, with the Chairman's blessing, the process to review and revise our 3.5 GHz rules. Today, 3.5 GHz is nearly ready to go to auction and will support many functions, including 5G deployment. Unfortunately, software reconfiguration, the testing process, and other issues have delayed our auctions. In turn, the priority access licenses are probably not going to be auctioned until the second quarter of 2020, at best. And, while 3.5 GHz is a good start, current supply cannot meet overall demand, especially since providers are seeking 100 megahertz channels. Building on what the Chairman has already put in motion, the Commission must continue its efforts to allocate additional mid-band frequencies for next-generation licensed services. Highest on our priority list must be the 3.7 to 4.2 GHz band, or the C-band. The Commission continues a deliberative process to consider the market-based approach, along with other options presented in the record. One of my foremost concerns is to ensure that the mechanism selected allows for the quickest reallocation of the band. I believe that the majority of relevant stakeholders are diligently working through how best to accommodate the current incumbents and provide a sufficiently transparent process. Further, I remain hopeful that the satellite incumbents recognize the great need for such frequencies and are willing to part with closer to 300 or more megahertz, assuming the requisite technology can accommodate this amount. In addition to 3.5 GHz and C-band, there needs to be a greater effort to identify more Federal agency holdings in the mid bands for reallocation. I have suggested that the 3.45 to 3.55 GHz band be made available for commercial use, and that additional feasibility studies be initiated to determine the extent of commercial offerings that can be introduced in 3.1 to 3.45 GHz. This spectrum can be combined with spectrum at 3.5 and 3.7 to 4.2 GHz to create the channel sizes required for true 5G services. Further, we should also start looking to the 7.125 to 8.5 GHz band to ensure that there is sufficient spectrum for the many entities that want to offer 5G services. At the same time, the Commission must also consider mid-band spectrum for unlicensed use, such as the 4.9, 5.9, and 6 GHz bands. The community serving this incredibly valuable function needs larger spectrum swaths to meet the speed, capacity, and latency expectations demanded of next-generation Wi-Fi and other unlicensed uses. Broadband Deployment & Overbuilding Concerns, Especially in Rural Communities One of the many things my fellow colleagues and I agree on is the critical importance of broadband infrastructure to the American people. It is hard to imagine any part of our current society that hasn't been integrated with Internet connectivity: from education and information, to employment and health care, broadband is a key component of modern American life and has improved our standard of living in so many ways. This is true no matter the underlying characteristics of the technology used to provide digital access--wired or wireless. In fact, both serve interchangeable functions for increasing numbers of Americans and will likely continue to do so going forward. Similarly, there is consensus among FCC Commissioners that all Americans--including those living in areas with challenging topography and sparse populations--should have the opportunity to access broadband Internet, if they wish to do so. While broadband availability has improved over the years, many unserved areas remain, and we must continue our efforts to expand access in an efficient and timely manner. That is why I have spent so much time over the years promoting better incentives and greater efficiency within our Universal Service Fund programs, and why I have repeatedly called for the implementation of the Remote Areas Fund (RAF) auction--in order to serve those Americans in the hardest to reach communities, which tend to be more rural and of lower economic status. I know that Chairman Pai is committed to this goal as well. At the same time, I worry that the desire to expand broadband infrastructure will lead to wasteful and duplicative spending and adverse consequences for consumers. Recently, Congress allocated new funding for broadband programs at the Department of Agriculture, and there appears to be interest in funding broadband buildout via the Department of Commerce as well. While I would reiterate my humble request from previous testimony that Congress consider the FCC's Universal Service Fund (USF) as a primary means to distribute new funding, it is my foremost concern that any new funding go to unserved areas, rather than areas where broadband service already exists. Coordination among the various agencies and departments would be helpful, and, of course, there are new legislative efforts by members of this Committee to help facilitate this. However, coordination can mean different things to different government agencies and their employees. Only through clear legislative direction and necessary oversight can Congress ensure that funding does not duplicate existing programs and goes only to those Americans without broadband today. Failure to prevent overbuilding can undermine providers' existing and future investments and result in extremely problematic outcomes. In particular, providers serving hard-to-reach areas can face serious financial difficulties if a new government-subsidized provider ``competes'' to serve existing customers--or worse--takes only the most highly profitable customers. I have seen this situation firsthand within the Commission's own USF program. It recently came to my attention that new E-Rate-subsidized fiber networks were overbuilding local USF-funded Texas broadband providers and stealing their anchor customers. By manipulating the contracting process to favor the bids of particular providers or self-provisioned service, some local school districts have been actively undermining local USF-supported providers' existing investments, and as a result, making it even more difficult to serve surrounding communities where some households may lack any Internet access at all. Ending Theft of 9-1-1 Fees by States & Territories The next issue that I will touch upon today is one that I've been very vocal about for the past several years and which has caught the attention of this Committee as well: 9-1-1 fee diversion. This is a very significant problem, though not as widespread as it once was, thankfully. Every month, millions of consumers pay their phone bills and if they look closely enough, they'll see a line item that generally refers to 9-1-1 emergency services, though the exact wording varies by jurisdiction. In accordance with the line item, consumers appropriately expect that those funds will go toward maintaining and upgrading 9-1-1 emergency calling systems. In some states and territories, however, this money flows into the general treasury and, as a result, only some portion of the collected fees ends up going toward emergency services. On top of being downright deceptive, this is a serious public safety matter that directly affects emergency call centers and personnel, not to mention all the people who live in or visit these states who expect that when they call 9-1-1, the system is up to date. Following the FCC's December report,\\1\\ the states and territories guilty of diverting these critical funds for 2017 were: New York, New Jersey, Rhode Island, Montana, Nevada, West Virginia, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\1\\ Tenth Annual Report to Congress on State Collection and Distribution of 911 and Enhanced 911 Fees and Charges for the Period of January 1, 2017 to December 31, 2017 (Dec. 17, 2018), https:// www.fcc.gov/files/lothannual9llfeereporttocongresspdf. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- As I noted, some members of this Committee have been outspoken on this issue as well, and I thank them for their efforts. The Commission has been issuing an annual report for the last decade, pursuant to Federal law, that measures the amount of money, if any, that each state diverts, on a total funding and a percentage basis. The report also provides an assessment of whether the diverted funds were used for purposes related in some capacity to public safety or completely unrelated. You may find it shocking that the diversion rate was as high as 90 percent in one state (New York). Beyond creating a problem of public confidence in the fee system itself, fee diversion also shortchanges the budgets of emergency call centers and has prevented much-needed upgrades. I've been to public safety answering points (PSAP), and I've met with the dedicated emergency communications professionals in many of the states subject to diversion. I can assure you that they are continually frustrated by their state politicians who do not have the will to do the right thing. However, I would be remiss if I didn't also address the positive side of our report. There are many states and territories that have made a concerted effort to get off the list, especially in some cases where the problem was an accounting technicality, and in others where public officials simply did the right thing and rectified their state budget practices. West Virginia has committed to do just this. To those states and their leaders, I tip my cap, and I know that in the long run, the people in their states will be better off and their emergency communications systems will be stronger and more reliable. It is also important to remind those states and territories that continue this despicable practice: they remain ineligible for new Federal funding to modernize their call centers as the shift to Next Generation 9-1-1 occurs. NG911 will be costly, but these improvements will increase the system's effectiveness and will be vital to saving lives. In the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012, this Committee helped create a new grant program for 9-1-1, E9-1-1, and NG911, and the law specifically excluded states and territories that divert fees from receiving these grants. In closing on this topic, I respectfully request the Committee's assistance. The ``name and shame'' process generated by our annual report has only been so helpful. The state leaders of certain recalcitrant states--New York, New Jersey, and Rhode Island--don't seem to care about the shaming part. Moreover, other states and territories seem to spring up after seeing a lack of substantial penalties and decide to divert for a few years to address a budget shortfall or provide new spending for a pet project. I believe new legislation is needed, in addition to what has already been introduced, and that it will take a more forceful approach to end diversion once and for all. I would be pleased to work with any Senators who are interested in this issue. Stopping Illegal Robocalls & Protecting Legal Calls The final issue I will discuss is the Commission's rightful focus on the surge of illegal robocalls in this country. These calls, many from overseas, are at best irritating; at worst, they serve to scam susceptible consumers out of their hard-earned money. Implementation of new technology should substantially reduce this menace, as will cooperation with foreign governments, but it is clear that eliminating such calls altogether is likely impossible. In considering this issue, it is important to maintain a careful and nuanced approach. Not all robocalls are illegal or scams, and we must be precise in describing the actual problem at issue. Many honest, legitimate businesses use automatic dialing technologies to communicate needed information to their customers and doing so is perfectly within the scope and intent of the TCPA. These legal and legitimate calls and texts include fraud alerts, flight schedule changes, school closures, delivery window delays, prescription alerts, appointment reminders, default notices, and public safety information, and share no part in the true robocall problem facing the Nation's communications networks. In terms of illegal calls, I applaud those innovative companies and carriers that have already offered or are in the process of offering free call authentication and call blocking services to their customers. I am hopeful that the Commission's recent Declaratory Ruling allowing carriers to block illegal and unwanted calls on an opt-out basis will help to further protect consumer interests. This includes pushing carriers to adopt expeditious processes for correcting false-positives, to ensure that legal and wanted calls are not incorrectly labeled or blocked. * * * Thank you to the Chairman and Ranking Member for inviting me to testify today. I welcome any questions from Committee members related to the topics I have covered or any others that are important to you and your constituents. Senator Wicker. Thank you very much, Commissioner. Commissioner Starks, welcome to the Committee. STATEMENT OF HON. GEOFFREY STARKS, COMMISSIONER, FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION Mr. Starks. Good morning, Chairman Wicker, Ranking Member Cantwell, and Members of the Committee. I'm honored to appear before you as a Commissioner for the first time and I appreciate the support that I received from all of you to assume this post. The future is already here. It's just not evenly distributed. Wise words that excellently frame the state of our Digital Divide. From this seat, I see a world that is on the cutting edge of a 5G transformation that will open the floodgates of innovation with autonomous vehicles, virtual reality, advanced health, precision agriculture, and artificial intelligence, and while I'm excited about 5G, I'm increasingly concerned about the far too many communities that are stuck with, as Senator Tester has said, no G. There cannot be two Americas, one where those with much get even more and another for those who are left behind. Researchers describe the Digital Divide as, quote unquote, persistent, and I agree. To that end, I see a world in which our Digital Divide is hardening into a state of Internet inequality impacting our economy, our democracy, and in fact the individual dignity of our citizens. We must make sure that quality affordable broadband is available to all Americans and where people are connected great things are possible. For instance, broadband can create opportunities in health care and education. I've seen the power of telehealth while visiting with Corie Nieto, the Director of Telehealth Services at the Nevada Health Center Clinic in Amargosa Valley, where technology connects distant doctors with rural patients, bringing expertise and specialty services that would otherwise be unavailable. I've also seen the power of high-quality online education at Winston-Salem State University in North Carolina. WSSU's program allows students unable to attend in person to take classes online and study at their own pace. These students efficiently acquire skills needed for jobs that are in high demand across the state, including back home in their own communities, and, for example, I met with Gabriel Bettazzi, a second career student who graduated from SSU's online Health Care Administration Program and now runs the Llibott Consultorios Medicos, a group of four primary care clinics focused on serving North Carolina's Latino community through in-person and telemedicine visits. And we live in a nation that runs on networks. Fixed and wireless communications are critical to our defense, infrastructure, business, and the billions of communications sent in America every day. Network security is national security and so it concerns me that right now our networks contain insecure Chinese equipment that could allow hostile actors to spy on us or even cripple our communication networks during a national emergency. While recent White House action has barred U.S. companies from buying or using this equipment moving forward, it did not address equipment that is already in our networks. I have said that the FCC needs to find it, fix it, and fund it. We need to find the equipment that poses a national security threat. We must fix it to secure our networks and we must fund the removal of insecure equipment in our networks as rapidly as possible while minimizing the disruption to consumers, and it could be expensive but it's an investment that we must make. Finally, I'd like to highlight two areas where the Commission must do more for our consumers. First, robocalls. I supported the Commission action last week to clarify that providers can offer call blocking service to consumers by default. This action should make these tools available to millions more and the FCC spoke clearly. We fully expect these services to be offered for free, free. If not, the FCC will know and will initiate a rulemaking and providers have long said that they want to be part of the solution and now is the time. On Monday, I sent letters to all the major carriers asking whether they plan to offer call opt-out blocking, how they plan to inform their customers and whether it will be free. If they fail to meet my expectations, you will hear of it. Second, I want to again call for the Commission to act in response to the sale of our location data by wireless carriers. Under this practice, anyone with a few hundred dollars could purchase real-time geo-location information. As a former Federal prosecutor, I'm shocked to think that a domestic abuser could access location data illegally to track a survivor to a safe house or a shelter. This is downright dangerous and so is our inaction. This practice was first reported over a year ago and the Commission has yet to find anyone responsible and we need to act now. In closing, I am honored to serve the American people. We have a lot to do. I look forward to working with you all and with my colleagues to address the many challenges ahead. Thank you. I look forward to your questions. [The prepared statement of Mr. Starks follows:] Prepared Statement of Hon. Geoffrey Starks, Commissioner, Federal Communications Commission Good morning, Chairman Wicker, Ranking Member Cantwell, and Members of the Committee. I'm honored to appear before you as a Federal Communications Commissioner for the first time today and I appreciate the support that I received from all of you to assume this post. ``The future is already here, it's just not evenly distributed.'' Wise words, and ones that excellently frame the state of our digital divide. In this seat, I see a world on the cutting edge of transformational fifth generation of wireless technology, or 5G, that will open the floodgates of innovation--autonomous vehicles, virtual and augmented reality, advanced telehealth, precision agriculture, and artificial intelligence. And I'm excited. But while we press forward with 5G, I am increasingly concerned about the far too many communities that are stuck with ``no-G.'' There cannot be two Americas--one where those with much get even more, and another for those who are left behind. Researchers have begun to describe the digital divide as ``persistent.'' I agree. To that end, I see a world in which our ``digital divide'' is hardening into a state of ``internet inequality.'' This is an issue that affects not only the U.S. economy, but also the individual dignity of our citizens and our democracy. It is absolutely imperative that we make sure that quality, affordable broadband is available to all Americans. Where people are connected, great things are possible. I'm particularly excited about how broadband can create healthcare and educational opportunities. For health care, I've seen the power of telehealth while visiting with Corie Nieto, the director of telehealth services at the Nevada Health Center Clinic in Amargosa Valley, Nevada--population about 1,500. She demonstrated how telehealth technology connects doctors from distant urban centers with patients in rural communities, bringing expertise and specialty services that would otherwise be unavailable to patients in this rural community. For educational opportunities, I recently saw the power of high-quality online education in action when I visited Winston Salem State University (WSSU) in North Carolina. WSSU's program allows students who may not be able to attend traditional in-person classes due to work or family demands, to study at their own pace to acquire skills needed for high-demand jobs. These same students apply what they've learned back home in their communities. For example, Gabriel Bottazzi, a second- career student who graduated from WSSU's online Healthcare Administration program, now runs LliBott Consultorios Medicos, a group of four primary care clinics that focus on serving the Latino community in North Carolina through in-person and telemedicine visits. The FCC manages billions of dollars of Universal Service program funds intended to ensure that all Americans have the broadband connectivity needed to access programs like those offered by WSSU and the Nevada Health Center Clinic. But to eliminate Internet inequality we must understand the scope and scale of the problem. The fundamental question is this: does the FCC truly know who has broadband and who does not? Unfortunately, at present, it appears that we do not, and the problem begins with the data. The FCC's recently-released broadband deployment report is, unfortunately, a glaring demonstration of our shortcomings. The first draft of the 706 Report was based on data that overstated high speed broadband connections by more than 62 million connections--that's more than the populations of Mississippi, Washington, Texas, Michigan, and Illinois put together. This is troubling for a host of reasons: that the FCC's data practices lack the sophistication to catch such a significant error by a new entrant; that we had to rely on an outside party to catch the mistake; that a draft with an error of this magnitude was circulated for consideration; that the inaccurate numbers from the draft were publicized in a way that overstated our progress on addressing access disparities; that it took months to correct the data; and that the fluctuating data did not change the FCC majority's analysis in any way. And, even when our data is reported correctly, it still doesn't paint an accurate picture in many instances. Under the current system, if a provider reports that it does, or even could, connect a single home in a census block, we count the entire census block as if everybody who lives there is connected. It's no secret that the FCC's broadband maps have problems. It's past time that we fix this. Right now, the FCC is considering imposing an arbitrary budget cap on all USF programs. But instead of imposing an arbitrary cap, the FCC should get the data needed to produce granular and accurate maps of where broadband is and is not available in the U.S. The status quo is not good enough--not by a long shot. In short, the FCC should be focused on mapping not capping. I'd also like mention a universally hated phenomenon--robocalls. Robocalls have overwhelmed the network and consumers, and have fundamentally changed the fabric of our culture--we don't pick up our phones anymore. These calls range from annoying and disruptive to deceptive and dangerous, defrauding unwitting consumers out of real money. Often, calls are spoofed to appear like they are coming from a local business or neighbor. This pernicious practice makes it impossible to differentiate these unwanted robocalls from calls coming from our pastor, doctor, or kids' schools. Put simply, by allowing these calls to proliferate, we've broken phone service in this country. I supported the Commission's action last week to clarify that voice service providers can offer call blocking service by default on an opt- out basis. This action should make these tools available to millions more consumers. And the FCC spoke clearly--we fully expect these services to be offered to consumers for free. Free. Because if not, the FCC will know about it, and initiate a rulemaking to prohibit these charges. We live in a nation that runs on networks. The importance of fixed and wireless communications to the U.S. economy can't be overstated. They are critical to military and government communications, utility infrastructure, every sector of business, and the billions of personal e-mails, phone calls, and text messages sent in America every single day. Looking forward, as the Internet of Things emerges and billions of cars, appliances, and other devices come online, the importance of our networks will only grow. Network Security is National Security, and right now there are threats in our communications networks--national security threats posed by unsecure Chinese telecommunications equipment with vulnerabilities that carry the risk of espionage or surveillance, and the ability of foreign entities to cripple our communications networks in times of a national emergency. These threats are serious and their presence in our networks is a problem. And while the President's recent Executive Order barred U.S. companies from buying or using telecommunications equipment deemed to be a national security risk moving forward, it did not address the fact that our networks already contain and depend on much of this equipment. I have said that we need to ``find it, fix it, and fund it.'' The FCC needs to step up, using its own authority and working with other Federal agencies, to investigate and determine the scope of our network's exposure to these threats. We must find any equipment that poses a national security threat. We must fix it to secure our networks. And we must fund the transition of carriers away from insecure equipment in their networks as rapidly as possible. This may require ``ripping and replacing,'' but it must be done in a way that minimizes disruption to carriers and their customers. This is a national problem that needs a national solution. It could be expensive--estimates range from $150 million for mitigation measures to over $1 billion for full replacement as we offset the cost of purchasing and installing new, secure equipment. But our national security is at stake and we must act to protect it. Finally, I want to reiterate my call for the Commission to act in response to wireless providers selling customer location data. With each passing month, our inaction becomes harder to explain and more problematic. This outrageous practice allowed anyone with a few hundred dollars to purchase anyone else's real time location. As a former Federal prosecutor, I've personally petitioned courts for restraining orders to protect survivors of domestic abuse. And I'm shocked to think that an abuser could illegally track a survivor's phone to a safehouse or a shelter. The misuse of this data is downright dangerous. This practice was first widely reported more than a year ago, yet the Commission still hasn't acted against those responsible. The passage of this much time is significant--the Commission typically has only a year to act before statutes of limitations run out. We need to act now. In closing, I am honored to serve the American people. We have a lot to do, and I look forward to working with my colleagues to address the many challenges ahead. Thank you for the opportunity to testify today. I look forward to answering your questions. Senator Wicker. Thank you very much. Commissioner Carr, you're recognized. Welcome to the Committee. STATEMENT OF HON. BRENDAN CARR, COMMISSIONER, FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION Mr. Carr. Thank you. Chairman Wicker, Ranking Member Cantwell, Distinguished Members of the Committee, thank you for the invitation to testify. When I first appeared before this Committee in 2017, the U.S. faced significant challenges in our effort to lead the world in 5G. Our outdated rules meant that it took too long and it cost too much to build out Internet infrastructure in this country. We risked ceding U.S. leadership in 5G and half a trillion dollars it could add to our economy, to our global competitors. Indeed, China was putting up new cell sites, the building blocks for 5G, at 12 times our pace. We needed to take bold action and that's exactly what we've done at the FCC. For one, we updated the Federal rules that apply to the construction of small cells, the backpack size antennas needed for next gen connectivity. We did so by excluding them from the costly and time-consuming review that applies to the construction of large 200-foot towers. For another, we addressed the state and local review process. We did this by building common sense reforms already enacted by elected officials in their own towns, reforms that provide clarity on fees, and ensure timely decisions. The FCC's reforms are now delivering results. Internet speeds are up nearly 40 percent. More fiber was built out last year than ever before. The number of small cells put up increased from 13,000 in 2017 to more than 60,000 in 2018. Investment in broadband networks is back on the rise, and the U.S. now has the world's largest 5G deployment. There's more to do, but we've turned the page on the failed policies of the prior FCC. We're now heading in the right direction. I've had the chance to see firsthand how our decisions are helping to create jobs in communities around the country. In places like Euless, Texas, I visited a manufacturing plant that build the smart poles needed for 5G. One of the workers there, Chris, told me that they're now doubling production every quarter because of an increase in demand for small cells. In fact, our success in accelerating infrastructure construction has crea"
