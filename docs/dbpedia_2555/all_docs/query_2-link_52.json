        "text": "To what extent did the diversification of Niantic Inc’s games portfolio influence the company&#039;s growth? Word count:\n\nINDEX\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nMETHODOLOGY\n\nDEFINITIONS\n\nFINDING AND ANALYSIS\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nBIBLIOGRAPHIC REFERENCES\n\nSUPPORTING DOCUMENTS\n\nSupporting Document Nº1\n\nSupporting Document Nº2\n\nSupporting Document Nº3\n\nSupporting Document Nº4\n\nSupporting Document Nº5\n\nsupporting documents were used such as news that addressed the growth aspects of the 4 products, as well as the information characterized for each game and monthly data on the number of downloads per game. Finally, in the written comment the following business management tools were used: Diversification Strategy in Product Catalogs, BCG Matrix and Definition of Sales Growth.\n\nDEFINITIONS\n\na) MATRIZ BCG:\n\nA business strategy that symbolizes in a graph how different the divisions can be, since it positions them according to the relative share with respect to the market and the industrial growth rate. (David, 2003, p. 206)\n\nb) DIVERSIFICATION:\n\nAccording to Ramanujam and Varadarajan, the diversification strategy is the ability of organizations to enter new lines of activity or products, in internal processes, acquisitions, involving changes in management areas. (1989, as cited in León, 2016, p)\n\nc) PRODUCT PORTFOLIO:\n\n“The concept of portfolio usually refers to the products offered by a company and has its greatest interest when it is extended to all the products offered by the market and that cooperate in an activity”. (Riba et al., 2016, p)\n\nd) SALES GROWTH:\n\n“Sustainable sales growth, or bankable, is the growth of sales that are financed without making changes in the existing financing structure (changes in debt or issuance of new capital) or in the distribution of profits.” (Fornero, 2017, p)\n\ne) MARKET SHARE: “Market share is the market share, defined in terms of units or revenue, for a specific product.” (Dominguez and Hermo, 2007, p)\n\nAlso, in 2020 John Hanke mentioned that: &quot;We are working hard on our games portfolio with a multi-year product roadmap comprised of games and other forms of AR experiences&quot;, this is supported by the development intent of 10 games (Supporting Document N°1). One application released as a beta test is &quot;Catan: World Explorers&quot;. According to García (2020) &quot;The new game will use Niantic Real World Platform technology to bring the world of Catan “to real life&quot;\n\nFigure 1\n\nBCG MATRIX\n\nNote. Own elaboration with information from the Supporting Document Nº\n\nFor the analysis, the data from July and August of this year were considered. In this way it was evidenced that Pokemon Go had a considerable decrease in downloads, however, it is the one that represents a high market share per product of 0, becoming the star product. On the other hand, Ingress Prime, had a not so representative growth, but it is the second product in terms of Market Growth Rate and therefore the first in Market Share with 0, positioning itself as the incognito product. Finally, the Harry Potter and Catan\n\ngames are dog products, since they have had negative results in terms of Market Growth Rate, which considerably affects their Market Share with 0 and 0 respectively. First of all, it can be considered that Pokemon Go is a success, since they invest a lot of financial resources for their growth, this also happens with Ingress Prime, because the company does invest considerable amounts, but it is a weak generator of cash so it is You should evaluate whether to continue with the same investment. However, for dog products, it does not take much consideration or effort as they are more likely to generate losses than profits. From this, it will be evaluated how the growth of Pokemon go has been: Table 1 Growth of Pokemon Go\n\nYear Revenue (Billon) Growth\n\n2016 $0 billion - 2017 $0 billion MG = (0 - 0)/ 0 x 100 = - 30% 2018 $0 billion MG = (0 - 0)/ 0 x 100 = 39% 2019 $0 billion MG = (0 - 0)/ 0 x 100 = 8% 2020 $1 billion MG = (1 - 0)/ 0 x 100 = 38% Note. Own elaboration with information from the Supporting Document Nº\n\nFigure 2\n\nrevenue growth, which should have done the same for the other games in its portfolio.\n\nNow the evaluation of Niantic as a company is presented:\n\nFigure 3\n\nNiantic valuation\n\nNote. Supporting Document Nº\n\nThe diversification of Niantic&#039;s games portfolio has been very important in the valuation of the company, since as of 2016 it increased by $ 3,649,850,000, and for 2019 it also had a growth of $ 350,000,000,000, significant figures in its growth as a company.\n\nFigure 4 Market Share of each game\n\nGame Early ReleaseDownloads Market share\n\nIngress Prime 35,932 MS= 35,932 /9,534,724 x 100 = 0% Pokemon Go 9,378,888 MS= 9,378,888 / 9,534,724 x 100 = 98% Harry Potter 109,994 MS= 109,994 / 9,534,724 x 100 =1% Catan 9,910 MS= 9,910 / 9,534,724 x 100 = 0% Total 9534,724 100% Note. Own elaboration with information from the Supporting Document Nº\n\nFigure 5 Market Share of each game\n\nNote. Own elaboration with information from the Supporting Document Nº\n\nPokémon is the product with the highest market share with 98%, the next is Harry Potter with 1%, however, those with a very low market share are Ingress Prime and Catan with 0% and 0%, this because they are few known games with improvements that are still in development.\n\nmore resources in Pokemon Go. For this, more should be invested with others, so that an opportunity is also provided to obtain attention in the market, involving new investigations to find the weak points of diversification and portfolio. Quantumly, it can be observed that the Niantic company presents a market growth in each year, also, qualitatively the value of the company is greater than previous years.\n\nBIBLIOGRAPHIC REFERENCES\n\nSUPPORTING DOCUMENTS\n\nSupporting Document Nº\n\nMochizuki, T.

SUPPORTING DOCUMENTS\n\nSupporting Document Nº Pokémon Go Studio Revs Up Pipeline in Quest for Next AR Hit\n\nBy Takashi Mochizuki\n\n15 de junio de 2020 8:00 GMT-\n\nPokémon Go developer Niantic Inc. plans to release two titles over the next six months and sustain that pace annually, accelerating its pipeline in hopes of scoring its next augmented-reality hit.\n\nthrough the app’s co-developer Pokémon Co. Nintendo also owns an undisclosed stake in Niantic, which remains private.\n\nThe Covid-19 outbreak presented several challenges to Niantic and Pokémon Go, Hanke said, as people didn’t explore the outdoors to hunt for Pokémon characters the way they usually would. But that also served as an opportunity for the company to brainstorm how it could offer more indoor-playing functions, he said.\n\nHanke said the company’s long-term design goal is to make a quarter of every game playable without leaving the home, as it hopes to bring the AR experience to a wider range of people, including those who have difficulties traveling alone.\n\nPokémon Go now counts the number of steps earned by indoor workouts -- steps are an essential component of hatching eggs inside the game -- allowing players to keep progressing at home. As a result, Pokémon Go’s revenue from the start of February to the end of May this year increased by 6% from the same period last year, according to Sensor Tower data.\n\nIn support of worldwide social distancing precautions, Niantic is hosting its annual Pokémon Go Fest digitally for two days from July 25. Past events have attracted large crowds in major cities such as Chicago, Japan’s Yokohama and Germany’s Dortmund, though many players still missed out because of geography and limited tickets. This year, Niantic said tickets are available for $15 each and open to anyone interested in participating.\n\nHanke said the company will continue encouraging players to encounter the real world. One upcoming initiative is a local business recovery program, wherein players can nominate their favorite local establishment and Niantic will turn it into a Pokémon Go replenishment station free of charge, letting players\n\nfill up on Pokéballs, potions and berries while helping drive clientele through its doors.\n\nNote.
