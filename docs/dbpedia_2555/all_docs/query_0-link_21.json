        "text": "Apr 4th 2019\n\nTrainers Worldwide Invited to Attend Major Real-World Pokémon GO Events in the Americas, Europe and Asia, Featuring Special Challenges, Experiences and Activities\n\nSAN FRANCISCO—April 4, 2019— Niantic, Inc. and The Pokémon Company International have announced the Pokémon GO Summer Tour 2019 which will continue to build upon the innovative real-world Pokémon GO events with immersive interactive experiences for Trainers to enjoy together. This year's Pokémon GO Summer Tour will bring hundreds of thousands of Trainers from around the world to Pokémon GO Fest: Chicago from June 13 to June 16 and Pokémon GO Fest: Dortmund in Germany from July 4 to July 7. The Pokémon GO Summer Tour 2019 will round out an action-packed summer with a Pokémon GO Fest in Asia with more details on the event coming soon.\n\n“Last year's Pokémon GO Summer Tour brought hundreds of thousands of Trainers together at real-world events around the world which left us with some truly unforgettable moments and stories,” said John Hanke, founder and CEO of Niantic, Inc. “This summer, we're looking to continue to build upon that success and create even more ways for Trainers to enjoy and interact with these incredible parks and cities and build lasting friendships throughout their journeys of encountering Pokémon in the 'real-world.'”\n\nIn the United States, Pokémon GO Fest returns to Chicago for its third year for Pokémon GO Fest 2019 from June 13 to June 16, expanding the event from two to four days. This year's event will take place across the expansive Grant Park, where Trainers of all ages will get to catch an array of Pokémon while interacting with physical installations and participating in exclusive activities throughout the park. Pokémon GO Fest: Chicago in Grant Park will also feature more than 300 acres of walking space in addition to some of Chicago's most iconic landmarks and attractions. Tickets will go on sale through an all-new Niantic ticketing system built within the Pokémon GO app later this month.

Hosted at the renowned Westfalenpark, Trainers will have an opportunity to play Pokémon GO together with others, explore Dortmund's cultural history and interact with local attractions while playing Pokémon GO together with others. Tickets for the event will be going on sale later this spring.

Details for the global challenges during each Pokémon GO Fest will be revealed ahead of each event. In addition to these unique challenges, Pokémon GO Community Days will also be hosted throughout the months of June, July and August giving Trainers even more reasons to venture outside and play together.\n\nTo learn more about Pokémon GO, the Pokémon GO Summer Tour 2019 and other events occurring around the world, please visit the official Pokémon GO blog at PokemonGOLive.com.\n\nTrainers can also stay up-to-date on Pokémon GO announcements and the latest real-world events by following the game on Twitter or liking it on Facebook.\n\nAbout Pokémon\n\nThe Pokémon Company International, a subsidiary of The Pokémon Company in Japan, manages the property outside of Asia and is responsible for brand management, licensing and marketing, the Pokémon Trading Card Game, the animated TV series, home entertainment, and the official Pokémon website.
