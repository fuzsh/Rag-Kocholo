        "text": "Cancer Incidence in Physicians: A Taiwan National Population-based Cohort Study.\n\nPubMed\n\nLee, Yu-Sung; Hsu, Chien-Chin; Weng, Shih-Feng; Lin, Hung-Jung; Wang, Jhi-Joung; Su, Shih-Bin; Huang, Chien-Cheng; Guo, How-Ran\n\n2015-11-01\n\nCancer has been the leading cause of death in Taiwan since 1982. Physicians have many health-related risk factors which may contribute to cancer, such as rotating night shift, radiation, poor lifestyle, and higher exposure risk to infection and potential carcinogenic drugs. However, the cancer risk in physicians is not clear. In Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database, we identified 14,889 physicians as the study cohort and randomly selected 29,778 nonmedical staff patients as the comparison cohort for this national population-based cohort study. Cox proportional-hazard regression was used to compare the cancer risk between physicians and comparisons. Physician subgroups were also analyzed. Physicians had a lower all-cancer risk than did the comparisons (hazard ratio [HR] 0.86, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.76-0.97). In the sex-based analysis, male physicians had a lower all-cancer risk than did male comparisons (HR 0.82, 95% CI 0.73-0.94); and female physicians did not (HR 1.29, 95% CI 0.88-1.91). In the cancer-type analysis, male physicians had a higher risk of prostate cancer (HR 1.72, 95% CI 1.12-2.65) and female physicians had twice the risk of breast cancer (HR 2.00, 95% CI 1.11-3.62) than did comparisons. Cancer risk was not significantly associated with physician specialties. Physicians in Taiwan had a lower all-cancer risk but higher risks for prostate and breast cancer than did the general population. These new epidemiological findings require additional study to clarify possible mechanisms.\n\nReoperation Rates After Anterior Cervical Discectomy and Fusion for Cervical Spondylotic Radiculopathy and Myelopathy: A National Population-based Study.\n\nPubMed\n\nPark, Moon Soo; Ju, Young-Su; Moon, Seong-Hwan; Kim, Tae-Hwan; Oh, Jae Keun; Makhni, Melvin C; Riew, K Daniel\n\n2016-10-15\n\nNational population-based cohort study. To compare the reoperation rates between cervical spondylotic radiculopathy and myelopathy in a national population of patients. There is an inherently low incidence of reoperation after surgery for cervical degenerative disease. Therefore, it is difficult to sufficiently power studies to detect differences between reoperation rates of different cervical diagnoses. National population-based databases provide large, longitudinally followed cohorts that may help overcome this challenge. We used the Korean Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service national database to select our study population. We included patients with the diagnosis of cervical spondylotic radiculopathy or myelopathy who underwent anterior cervical discectomy and fusion from January 2009 to June 2014. We separated patients into two groups based on diagnosis codes: cervical spondylotic radiculopathy or cervical spondylotic myelopathy. Age, sex, presence of diabetes, osteoporosis, associated comorbidities, number of operated cervical disc levels, and hospital types were considered potential confounding factors. The overall reoperation rate was 2.45%. The reoperation rate was significantly higher in patients with cervical spondylotic myelopathy than in patients with cervical radiculopathy (myelopathy: Pâ=â0.0293, hazard ratioâ=â1.433, 95% confidence interval 1.037-1.981). Male sex, presence of diabetes or associated comorbidities, and hospital type were noted to be risk factors for reoperation. The reoperation rate after anterior cervical discectomy and fusion was higher for cervical spondylotic myelopathy than for cervical spondylotic radiculopathy in a national population of patients. 3.\n\nThe national burden of cerebrovascular diseases in Spain: a population-based study using disability-adjusted life years.\n\nPubMed\n\nCatalÃ¡-LÃ³pez, FerrÃ¡n; FernÃ¡ndez de Larrea-Baz, Nerea; Morant-Ginestar, Consuelo; Ãlvarez-MartÃ­n, Elena; DÃ­az-GuzmÃ¡n, Jaime; GÃ¨nova-Maleras, Ricard\n\n2015-04-20\n\nThe aim of the present study was to determine the national burden of cerebrovascular diseases in the adult population of Spain. Cross-sectional, descriptive population-based study. We calculated the disability-adjusted life years (DALY) metric using country-specific data from national statistics and epidemiological studies to obtain representative outcomes for the Spanish population. DALYs were divided into years of life lost due to premature mortality (YLLs) and years of life lived with disability (YLDs). DALYs were estimated for the year 2008 by applying demographic structure by sex and age-groups, cause-specific mortality, morbidity data and new disability weights proposed in the recent Global Burden of Disease study. In the base case, neither YLLs nor YLDs were discounted or age-weighted. Uncertainty around DALYs was tested using sensitivity analyses. In Spain, cerebrovascular diseases generated 418,052 DALYs, comprising 337,000 (80.6%) YLLs and 81,052 (19.4%) YLDs. This accounts for 1,113 DALYs per 100,000 population (men: 1,197 and women: 1,033) and 3,912 per 100,000 in those over the age of 65 years (men: 4,427 and women: 2,033). Depending on the standard life table and choice of social values used for calculation, total DALYs varied by 15.3% and 59.9% below the main estimate. Estimates provided here represent a comprehensive analysis of the burden of cerebrovascular diseases at a national level. Prevention and control programmes aimed at reducing the disease burden merit further priority in Spain. Copyright Â© 2013 Elsevier EspaÃ±a, S.L.U.

The purpose of the current study was to examine the relationship between a range of childhood adversities and PDs in a nationally representative sample while adjusting for Axis I mental disorders. Data were from the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC; n=34,653; data collection 2004-2005); a nationally representative sample of the United States population aged 20 years and older. The results indicated that many types of childhood adversity were highly prevalent among individuals with PDs in the general population and childhood adversity was most consistently associated with schizotypal, antisocial, borderline, and narcissistic PDs. The most robust childhood adversity findings were for child abuse and neglect with cluster A and cluster B PDs after adjusting for all other types of childhood adversity, mood disorders, anxiety disorders, substance use disorders, other PD clusters, and sociodemographic variables (Odd Ratios ranging from 1.22 to 1.63). In these models, mood disorders, anxiety disorders, and substance use disorders also remained significantly associated with PD clusters (Odds Ratios ranging from 1.26 to 2.38). Further research is necessary to understand whether such exposure has a causal role in the association with PDs. In addition to preventing child maltreatment, it is important to determine ways to prevent impairment among those exposed to adversity, as this may reduce the development of PDs.

Based on the entire national population, a nested case-control design was adopted using Norwegian national longitudinal registers to obtain 23Â 073 suicide cases having occurred in 1969-2012 and 373Â 178 controls. Odds ratios (ORs) for suicide were estimated using conditional logistic regression analysis adjusting for socio-economic factors. Compared with native Norwegians, suicide risk was significantly lower in first- and second-generation immigrants but higher in Norwegian-born with one foreign-born parent and foreign-born individuals with at least one Norwegian-born parent. When stratifying data by country group of origin, first-generation immigrants had lower ORs in most of the strata. Subjects born in Asia and in Central and South America with at least one Norwegian-born parent had a significantly higher risk of suicide. The observed results remained mostly unchanged in the analyses controlled for socio-economic status. Suicide risk is lower in first- and second-generation immigrants but higher in subjects born in Norway with one foreign-born parent and those born abroad with at least one Norwegian-born parent, with notable differences by country group of origin.

Here, we present the history, structure, contents, and way to use data procurement in the Korean National Health Insurance (NHI) system for the benefit of Korean researchers. Methods The NHIS in Korea is a single-payer program and is mandatory for all residents in Korea. The three main healthcare programs of the NHI, Medical Aid, and long-term care insurance (LTCI) provide 100% coverage for the Korean population. The NHIS in Korea has adopted a fee-for-service system to pay health providers. Researchers can obtain health information from the four databases of the insured that contain data on health insurance claims, health check-ups and LTCI. Results Metabolic disease as chronic disease is increasing with aging society. NHIS data is based on mandatory, serial population data, so, this might show the time course of disease and predict some disease progress, and also be used in primary and secondary prevention of disease after data mining. Conclusion The NHIS database represents the entire Korean population and can be used as a population-based database. The integrated information technology of the NHIS database makes it a world-leading population-based epidemiology and disease research platform.

We aimed to investigate migraine as a risk factor for stroke in a Swedish population-based twin cohort, and whether familial factors contribute to an increased risk. The study population included twins without prior cerebrovascular disease who answered a headache questionnaire during 1998 and 2002 for twins born 1935-58 and during 2005-06 for twins born between 1959 and 1985. Migraine with and without aura and probable migraine was defined by an algorithm mapping on to clinical diagnostic criteria according to the International Classification of Headache Disorders. Stroke diagnoses were obtained from the national patient and cause of death registers. Twins were followed longitudinally, by linkage of national registers, from date of interview until date of first stroke, death, or end of study on 31 Dec 2014. In total, 8635 twins had any migraineous headache, whereof 3553 had migraine with aura and 5082 had non-aura migraineous headache (including migraine without aura and probable migraine), and 44 769 twins had no migraine. During a mean follow-up time of 11.9 years we observed 1297 incident cases of stroke. The Cox proportional hazards model with attained age as underlying time scale was used to estimate hazard ratios with 95% confidence intervals for stroke including ischaemic and haemorrhagic subtypes related to migraine with aura, non-aura migraineous headache, and any migraineous headache. Analyses were adjusted for gender and cardiovascular risk factors. Where appropriate; within-pair analyses were performed to control for confounding by familial factors. The age- and gender-adjusted hazard ratio for stroke related to migraine with aura was 1.27 (95% confidence interval 1.00-1.62), P = 0.05, and 1.07 (95% confidence interval 0.91-1.26), P = 0\n\nPOPULATION-BASED EXPOSURE MODELING FOR AIR POLLUTANTS AT EPA'S NATIONAL EXPOSURE RESEARCH LABORATORY\n\nEPA Science Inventory\n\nThe US EPA's National Exposure Research Laboratory (NERL) has been developing, applying, and evaluating population-based exposure models to improve our understanding of the variability in personal exposure to air pollutants.

Several authors in order to determine natural hazards risk (Seismic, landslides, cyclones, flood, Volcanic) perception used questionnaires as tool for providing reliable quantitative data and permitting comparison the results with those of similar surveys. In Italy, risk perception studies based on surveys, were also carried out in order to investigate on national importance Natural risk, in particular on Somma-Vesuvio and Phlegrean Fields volcanic Risks, but lacked risk perception studies on local situation distributed on whole national territory. National importance natural hazard were frequently reported by national mass media and there were debate about emergencies civil protection plans, otherwise could be difficult to obtain information on bonded and regional nature natural hazard which were diffuses along National territory. In fact, Italian peninsula was a younger geological area subjected to endogenous phenomena (volcanoes, earthquake) and exogenous phenomena which determine land evolution and natural hazard (landslide, coastal erosion, hydrogeological instability, sinkhole) for population. For this reason we decided to investigate on natural risks perception in different Italian place were natural hazard were taken place but not reported from mass media, as were only local relevant or historical event. We carried out surveys in different Italian place interested by different types of natural Hazard (landslide, coastal erosion, hydrogeological instability, sinkhole, volcanic phenomena and earthquake) and compared results, in order to understand population perception level, awareness and civil protection exercises preparation.

Longer-term projections suggest the population will peak around 2036 and then gradually start to fall. The population will become gradually older with the median age expected to rise from 36.9 years in 1998 to nearly 42 years by 2021. In 1998, there were 1.4 million (13 per cent) more children aged under 16, than people of pensionable age. However, by 2008, the population of pensionable age is projected to exceed the number of children.\n\nSalivary sex hormone measurement in a national, population-based study of older adults.\n\nPubMed\n\nGavrilova, Natalia; Lindau, Stacy Tessler\n\n2009-11-01\n\nTo describe the methods used for, correlates of cooperation with, and validity of in-home salivary specimens collected from older adults. Salivary specimens were collected between 2005 and 2006 during in-home interviews with a probability sample of 3,005 U.S. men and women, ages 57-85 years. Sex hormone levels were assessed by enzyme-linked immunoassay conducted at Salimetrics, LLC (State College, PA). Mean salivary sex hormone concentrations were compared by gender and in relation to medication use and health conditions. Self-collected saliva specimens were provided by 2,722 (90.6%) individuals; 95.8% of these were adequate for analysis. Black participants were significantly less likely than individuals of other racial/ethnic groups to provide a salivary specimen; age, gender, education, and self-rated health were not associated with participation. Mean testosterone levels were higher in men compared with women, and estradiol levels were higher in women using estrogens. Salivary hormone measurements obtained in the National Social Life, Health, and Aging Project (NSHAP) and other studies are of similar magnitude. NSHAP is the first large, population-based study of older adults to measure salivary estradiol, progesterone, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), and, in women, testosterone. These data demonstrate a high cooperation rate with in-home salivary specimen collection from older adults and good validity of sex hormone measurements.\n\n2002-based national population projections for the United Kingdom and constituent countries.\n\nPubMed\n\nShaw, Chris\n\n2004-01-01\n\nThe 2002-based national population projections, carried out by the Government Actuary in consultation with the Registrars General, show the population of the United Kingdom rising from 59.2 million in 2002 to nearly 65 million by 2031. Longer-term projections suggest the population will peak around 2050 at over 65 million and then gradually start to fall. The population will become gradually older with the median age expected to rise from 38.2 years in 2002 to 43.3 years by 2031. In 2002, there were around 850 thousand (8 per cent) more children aged under 16, than people of state pensionable age. However, from 2007, the population of pensionable age is projected to exceed the number of children.\n\nElevated incidence rates of diabetes in Peru: report from PERUDIAB, a national urban population-based longitudinal study\n\nPubMed Central\n\nSeclen, Segundo Nicolas; Rosas, Moises Ernesto; Arias, Arturo Jaime; Medina, Cecilia Alexandra\n\n2017-01-01\n\nObjective A recent report from a non-nationally representative, geographically diverse sample in four separate communities in Peru suggests an unusually high diabetes incidence. We aimed to estimate the national diabetes incidence rate using PERUDIAB, a probabilistic, national urban population-based longitudinal study. Research design and methods 662 subjects without diabetes, selected by multistage, cluster, random sampling of households, representing the 24 administrative and the 3 (coast, highlands and jungle) natural regions across the country, from both sexes, aged 25+ years at baseline, enrolled in 2010â2012, were followed for 3.8 years. New diabetes cases were defined as fasting blood glucose â¥126âmg/dL or on medical diabetes treatment. Results There were 49 cases of diabetes in 2408 person-years follow-up. The weighted cumulative incidence of diabetes was 7.2% while the weighted incidence rate was estimated at 19.5 (95% CI 13.9 to 28.3) new cases per 1000 person-years. Older age, obesity and technical or higher education were statistically associated with the incidence of diabetes. Conclusion Our results confirm that the incidence of diabetes in Peru is among the highest reported globally. The fast economic growth in the last 20 years, high overweight and obesity rates may have triggered this phenomenon.

The population will become gradually older with the mean age expected to rise from 38.4 years in 1996 to nearly 42 years by 2021. The number of children aged under 16 is projected to fall by 1.0 million (9 per cent) by 2021, while the number aged 65 and over is projected to increase by 2.7 million (29 per cent). Longer-term projections suggest the population will peak around 2031 and then gradually start to fall.\n\n2004-based national population projections for the UK and constituent countries.\n\nPubMed\n\nShaw, Chris\n\n2006-01-01\n\nThe 2004-based national population projections, carried out by the Government Actuary in consultation with the Registrars General, show the population of the United Kingdom (UK) rising from 59.8 million in 2004, passing 60 million in 2005 and 65 million in 2023, to reach 67.0 million by 2031. In the longer-term, the projections suggest that the population will continue rising beyond 2031 but at a much lower rate of growth. The population will become older with the median age expected to rise from 38.6 years in 2004 to 42.9 years by 2031. With the current plans for a common state pension age of 65 for both sexes from 2020, the number of people of working age for every person of state pensionable age is projected to fall from 3.33 in 2004 to 2.62 by 2031.\n\nInterim 2003-based national population projections for the United Kingdom and constituent countries.\n\nPubMed\n\nShaw, Chris\n\n2004-01-01\n\nThe 2003-based national population projections, carried out by the Government Actuary in consultation with the Registrars General, and using essentially the same underlying assumptions as for the previous 2002-based projections, show the population of the United Kingdom rising from 59.6 million in 2003, passing 60 million during 2005, to reach 65.7 million by 2031. Longer-term projections suggest the population will peak around 2050 at nearly 67 million and then very gradually start to fall. The population will become older with the median age expected to rise from 38.4 years in 2003 to 43.3 years by 2031. In 2003, there were around 700 thousand (six per cent) more children aged under 16, than people of state pensionable age.

These \"interim\" projections, carried out by the Government Actuary in consultation with the Registrars General, take preliminary account of the results of the Census which showed that the base population used in previous projections was overestimated. The interim projections also incorporate a reduced assumption of net international migration to the United Kingdom, informed by the first results of the 2001 Census and taking account of more recent migration information. The population of the United Kingdom is now projected to increase from an estimated 58.8 million in 2001 to reach 63.2 million by 2026. The projected population at 2026 is about 1.8 million (2.8 per cent) lower than in the previous (2000-based) projections.\n\nManagement and prognosis of locally recurrent rectal cancer - A national population-based study.\n\nPubMed\n\nWestberg, Karin; Palmer, Gabriella; Hjern, Fredrik; Johansson, Hemming; Holm, TorbjÃ¶rn; Martling, Anna\n\n2018-01-01\n\nThe rate of local recurrence of rectal cancer (LRRC) has decreased but the condition remains a therapeutic challenge. This study aimed to examine treatment and prognosis in patients with LRRC in Sweden. Special focus was directed towards potential differences between geographical regions and time periods. All patients with LRRC as first event, following primary surgery for rectal cancer performed during the period 1995-2002, were included in this national population-based cohort-study. Data were collected from the Swedish Colorectal Cancer Registry and from medical records. The cohort was divided into three time periods, based on the date of diagnosis of the LRRC. In total, 426 patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Treatment with curative intent was performed in 149 patients (35%), including 121 patients who had a surgical resection of the LRRC. R0-resection was achieved in 64 patients (53%). Patients with a non-centrally located tumour were more likely to have positive resection margins (R1/R2) (OR 5.02, 95% CI:2.25-11.21). Five-year survival for patients resected with curative intent was 43% after R0-resection and 14% after R1-resection. There were no significant differences in treatment intention or R0-resection rate between time periods or regions. The risk of any failure was significantly higher in R1-resected patients compared with R0-resected patients (HR 2.04, 95% CI:1.22-3.40). A complete resection of the LRRC is essential for potentially curative treatment. Time period and region had no influence on either margin status or prognosis.

We used nationally represented, population-based data from the second China National Sample Survey on Disability, conducted in 2006. A total of 1,724,398 study subjects between the ages of 15 and 64, including 10,095 subjects with mental disability only, were used for the analysis. Wealth status was estimated by a wealth index that was derived from a principal component analysis of 10 household assets and four other variables related to wealth. Logistic regression analysis was used to estimate the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for mental disability for each category, with the lowest quintile category as the referent. Confounding variables under consideration were age, gender, residence area, marital status, ethnicity, education, current employment status, household size, house type, homeownership and living arrangement. The distribution of various types and severities of mental disability differed significantly by wealth index category in the present population. Wealth index category had a positive association with mild mental disability (p for trend <0.01), but had a negative association with extremely severe mental disability (p for trend <0.01). Moreover, wealth index category had a significant, inverse association with mental disability when all severities of mental disability were taken into consideration. This study's results suggest that wealth is a significant factor in the distribution of mental disability and it might have different influences on various types and severities of mental disability.\n\nPopulation based study of rates of multiple pregnancies in Denmark, 1980-94.\n\nPubMed Central\n\nWestergaard, T.; Wohlfahrt, J.; Aaby, P.; Melbye, M.\n\n1997-01-01\n\nOBJECTIVE: To study trends in multiple pregnancies not explained by changes in maternal age and parity patterns. DESIGN: Trends in population based figures for multiple pregnancies in Denmark studied from complete national records on parity history and vital status. POPULATION: 497,979 Danish women and 803,019 pregnancies, 1980-94. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: National rates of multiple pregnancies, infant mortality, and stillbirths controlled for maternal age and parity. Special emphasis on primiparous women > or = 30 years of age, who are most likely to undergo fertility treatment. RESULTS: The national incidence of multiple pregnancies increased 1.7-fold during 1980-94, the increase primarily in 1989-94 and almost exclusively in primiparous women aged > or = 30 years, for whom the adjusted population based twinning rate increased 2.7-fold and the triplet rate 9.1-fold. During 1989-94, the adjusted yearly increase in multiple pregnancies for these women was 19% (95% confidence interval 16% to 21%) and in dizygotic twin pregnancies 25% (21% to 28%). The proportion of multiple births among infant deaths in primiparous women > or = 30 years increased from 11.5% to 26.9% during the study period. The total infant mortality, however, did not increase for these women because of a simultaneous significant decrease in infant mortality among singletons. CONCLUSIONS: A relatively small group of women has drastically changed the overall national rates of multiple pregnancies. The introduction of new treatments to enhance fertility has probably caused these changes and has also affected the otherwise decreasing trend in infant mortality. Consequently, the resources, both economical and otherwise, associated with these treatments go well beyond those invested in specific fertility enhancing treatments.

Longer-term projections suggest the population will peak at nearly 66 million around 2040 and then gradually start to fall. The population will become gradually older with the median age expected to rise from 37.4 years in 2000 to 42.4 years by 2025. In 2000, there were 1.3 million (12 per cent) more children aged under 16, than people of state pensionable age. However, by 2007, the population of state pensionable age is projected to exceed the number of children.\n\nLithium in drinking water and the incidence of bipolar disorder: A nation-wide population-based study.\n\nPubMed\n\nKessing, Lars V; Gerds, Thomas A; Knudsen, Nikoline N; JÃ¸rgensen, Lisbeth F; Kristiansen, SÃ¸ren M; Voutchkova, Denitza; Ernstsen, Vibeke; Schullehner, JÃ¶rg; Hansen, Birgitte; Andersen, Per K; ErsbÃ¸ll, Annette K\n\n2017-11-01\n\nAnimal data suggest that subtherapeutic doses, including micro doses, of lithium may influence mood, and lithium levels in drinking water have been found to correlate with the rate of suicide. It has never been investigated whether consumption of lithium may prevent the development of bipolar disorder (primary prophylaxis). In a nation-wide population-based study, we investigated whether long-term exposure to micro levels of lithium in drinking water correlates with the incidence of bipolar disorder in the general population, hypothesizing an inverse association in which higher long-term lithium exposure is associated with lower incidences of bipolar disorder. We included longitudinal individual geographical data on municipality of residence, data from drinking water lithium measurements and time-specific data from all cases with a hospital contact with a diagnosis of mania/bipolar disorder from 1995 to 2013 (N=14Â 820) and 10 age- and gender-matched controls from the Danish population (N= 140Â 311). Average drinking water lithium exposure was estimated for all study individuals. The median of the average lithium exposure did not differ between cases with a diagnosis of mania/bipolar disorder (12.7Â Î¼g/L; interquartile range [IQR]: 7.9-15.5 Î¼g/L) and controls (12.5Â Î¼g/L; IQR: 7.6-15.7 Î¼g/L; P=.2). Further, the incidence rate ratio of mania/bipolar disorder did not decrease with higher long-term lithium exposure, overall, or within age categories (0-40, 41-60 and 61-100Â years of age). Higher long-term lithium exposure from drinking water was not associated with a lower incidence of bipolar disorder. The association should be investigated in areas with higher lithium levels than in Denmark. Â© 2017 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Nation-wide population-based study\n\nPubMed Central\n\nBjÃ¶rklund, Johan; Folkvaljon, Yasin; Cole, Alexander; Carlsson, Stefan; Robinson, David; Loeb, Stacy; Stattin, PÃ¤r; Akre, Olof\n\n2016-01-01\n\nObjective To assess 90-day postoperative mortality after Robot assisted laparoscopic Radical prostatectomy (RARP) and retropubic radical prostatectomy (RRP) by use of nationwide population-based registry data. Patients and methods Cohort study in the National Prostate Cancer Register (NPCR) of Sweden of 22 344 men with prostate cancer in clinical local stage T1-T3, PSA <50 Î¼g/ml who had undergone primary RP in 1998 - 2012. Vital status was ascertained through the Total Population Register. 90-day postoperative mortality was analysed by use of logistic regression analysis and comparison of 90-day mortality with the background population were made using standardised mortality ratios (SMR). Results 29 out of 14820 men (0.20%) died after RRP and 10 out of 7524 men (0.13%) died after RARP. Mortality during the 90-day postoperative period in the cohort was lower than in an age-matched background population, SMR 0.57 (CI 95% 0.39-0.75). There was no statistically significant difference in 90-day mortality according to surgical method, RARP vs. RRP (odds ratio, OR 1.14; 95% CI, 0.46-2.81). Postoperative 90-day mortality decreased over time, 2008-2012 vs. 1998-2007 (OR 0.44; 95% CI, 0.21-0.95), mainly due to decreased mortality after RARP. Limitations of our study include the non-randomised design and that more RARP were performed in recent years compared to RRP. Conclusion 90-day postoperative mortality was low after RARP and RRP and there was nostatistically significant difference between the methods. Given the long life expectancy among men with low and intermediate risk prostate cancer, very low postoperative mortality is a prerequisite for RP which was fulfilled by both RRP and RARP. The selection of healthy men for RP is highlighted by the lower 90-day mortality after RP compared to the background population.

The aim of this paper was to examine how patients with HGD were coded in HES and whether it was done consistently. National population-based cohort study of patients with newly diagnosed with HGD in England. The study used data collected prospectively as part of the National Oesophago-Gastric Cancer Audit (NOGCA). These records were linked to HES to investigate the pattern of ICD-10 codes recorded for these patients at the time of diagnosis. All patients with a new diagnosis of HGD between 1 April 2013 and 31 March 2014 in England, who had data submitted to the NOGCA. The main outcome assessed was the pattern of primary and secondary ICD-10 diagnostic codes recorded in the HES records at endoscopy at the time of diagnosis of HGD. Among 452 patients with a new diagnosis of HGD between 1 April 2013 and 31 March 2014, Barrett's oesophagus was the only condition coded in 200 (44.2%) HES records. Records for 59 patients (13.1%) contained no oesophageal conditions. The remaining 193 patients had various diagnostic codes recorded, 93 included a diagnosis of Barrett's oesophagus and 57 included a diagnosis of oesophageal/gastric cardia cancer. HES is not suitable to support national studies looking at the management of HGD. This is one reason for the UK to adopt an extended ICD system (akin to ICD-10-CM).

Methods and Materials: Data from the population-based Cancer Registry of Norway was used to identify all patients diagnosed with cancer and/or treated by RT for cancer in 1997-2010. Radiation therapy utilization rates (RURs) were calculated as (1) the proportion of incident cancer cases who received RT at least once within 1Â year of diagnosis (RUR{sub 1Y}); and (2) the proportion who received RT within 5Â years of diagnosis (RUR{sub 5Y}). The number of RT treatment courses per incidentmoreÂ Â» cancer case (TCI) was also calculated for all cancer sites combined. The actual RURs were compared with corresponding Australian and Canadian epidemiologic- and evidence-based model estimates and criterion-based benchmark estimates of optimal RURs. The TCIs were compared with TCI estimates from the 1997 Norwegian/National Cancer Plan (NCP). Joinpoint regression was used to identify changes in trends and to estimate annual percentage change (APC) in actual RUR{sub 1Y} and actual TCI. Results: The actual RUR{sub 5Y} (all sites) increased significantly to 29% in 2005 but still differed markedly from the Australian epidemiologic- and evidence-based model estimate of 48%. With the exception of RUR{sub 5Y} for breast cancer and RUR{sub 1Y} for lung cancers, all actual RURs were markedly lower than optimal RUR estimates. The actual TCI increased significantly during the study period, reaching 42.5% in 2010, but was still lower than the 54% recommended in the NCP. The trend for RUR{sub 1Y} (all sites) and TCI changed significantly, with the annual percentage change being largest during the first part of the study period. Conclusions: Utilization rates of RT in Norway increased after the NCP was implemented and RT capacity was increased, but they still seem to be lower than optimal levels.Â«Â less\n\nWeb-based international studies in limited populations of pediatric leukemia.\n\nPubMed\n\nValsecchi, Maria Grazia; Silvestri, Daniela; Covezzoli, Anna; De Lorenzo, Paola\n\n2008-02-01\n\nRecent progress in cancer research leads to the characterization of small subgroups of patients by genetic/biological features. Clinical studies in this setting are frequently promoted by international networks of independent researchers and are limited by practical and methodological constraints, not least the regulations recently issued by national and international institutions (EU Directive 2001/20/EC). We reviewed various methods in the design of international multicenter studies, with focus on randomized clinical trials. This paper reports our experience in planning and conducting international studies in childhood leukemia. We applied a decentralized study conduct based on a two-level structure, comprising a national and an international coordinating level. For the more recent trials this structure was implemented as a web-based system. This approach accommodates major legal requirements (e.g., safety reporting) and ensures Good Clinical Practice principles by implementing risk-oriented monitoring procedures. Setting up international non-commercial trials is increasingly complicated. Still, they are strongly needed for answering relevant questions in limited populations.

To determine national estimates of visual impairment and ischemic optic neuropathy after spine surgery. Loss of vision after spine surgery is rare but has devastating complications that has gained increasing recognition in the recent literature. National population-based studies of visual complications after spine surgery are lacking. All patients from 1993 to 2002 who underwent spine surgery (Clinical Classifications software procedure code: 3, 158) and who had ischemic optic neuropathy (ION) (ICD9-CM code 377.41), central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO) (ICD9-CM code 362.31) or non-ION, non-CRAO perioperative visual impairment (ICD9-CM codes: 369, 368.4, 368.8-9368.11-13) were included. Univariate and multivariate analysis were performed to identify potential risk factors. The overall incidence of visual disturbance after spine surgery was 0.094%. Spine surgery for scoliosis correction and posterior lumbar fusion had the highest rates of postoperative visual loss of 0.28% and 0.14% respectively. Pediatric patients (<18 years) were 5.8 times and elderly patients (>84 years) were 3.2 times more likely than, patients 18 to 44 years of age to develop non-ION, non-CRAO visual loss after spine surgery. Patients with peripheral vascular disease (OR = 2.0), hypertension (OR = 1.3), and those who received blood transfusion (OR = 2.2) were more likely to develop non-ION, non-CRAO vision loss after spine surgery. Ischemic optic neuropathy was present in 0.006% of patients. Hypotension (OR = 10.1), peripheral vascular disease (OR = 6.3) and anemia (OR = 5.9) were the strongest risk factors identified for the development of ION. We used multivariate analysis to identify significant risk factors for visual loss after spine surgery. National population-based estimate of visual impairment after spine surgery confirms that ophthalmic complications after spine surgery are rare.

We conducted a population-based study in a United Kingdom research database of prospectively collected primary care data (The Health Improvement Network) including children born 1990 to 2009 (nâ=â794,169) and identified major CA diagnoses using EUROCAT (European Surveillance of Congenital Anomalies) classification. Prevalence ratios (PR) were used to estimate the risk of CA in males compared with females for any CA, system-specific subgroups and specific CA diagnoses. In a subpopulation of children whose medical records were linked to their mothers', we assessed the effect of adjusting for sociodemographic and maternal factors on sex odds ratios. PRs were pooled with measures from previously published studies. The prevalence of any CA was 307/10,000 in males (95% CI, 302-313) and 243/10,000 in females (95% CI, 238-248). Overall the risk of any CA was 26% greater in males (PR (male: female) 1.26, 95% CI, 1.23-1.30) however there was considerable variation across specific diagnoses. The magnitude and direction of risk did not change for any specific CA upon adjustment for sociodemographic and maternal factors. Our PRs were highly consistent with those from previous studies. The overall risk of CA is greater in males than females, although this masked substantial variation by specific diagnoses. Sociodemographic and maternal factors do not appear to affect these risks.

Our study tests that association using a national population-based study design. The source population comprised of all persons born during1922-1945 in Nazi-occupied or dominated European nations, that immigrated to Israel by 1965, were identified in the Population Register (N = 220,665), and followed up for suicide to 2014, totaling 16,953,602 person-years. The population was disaggregated to compare a trauma gradient among groups that immigrated before (indirect, n = 20,612, 9%); during (partial direct, n = 17,037, 8%); or after (full direct, n = 183,016, 83%) exposure to the Nazi era. Also, the direct exposure groups were examined regarding pre- or post-natal exposure periods. Cox regression models were used to compute Hazard Ratios (HR) of suicide risk to compare the exposure groups, adjusting for confounding by gender, residential SES and history of psychiatric hospitalization. In the total population, only the partial direct exposure subgroup was at greater risk compared to the indirect exposure group (HR = 1.73, 95% CI, 1.10, 2.73; P < .05). That effect replicated in six sensitivity analyses. In addition, sensitivity analyses showed that exposure at ages 13 plus among females, and follow-up by years since immigration were associated with a greater risk; whereas in utero exposure among persons with no psychiatric hospitalization and early postnatal exposure among males were at a reduced risk. Tentative mechanisms impute biopsychosocial vulnerability and natural selection during early critical periods among males, and feelings of guilt and entrapment or defeat among females.

Design Population based cohort study. Setting England. Population More than 3.5 million registered patients aged 15-99 with a diagnosis of one of the 24 most common primary, malignant, invasive neoplasms between 1996 and 2013. Main outcome measures Age standardised net survival estimates by cancer, sex, year, and deprivation group. These estimates were modelled using regression model with splines to explore changes in the cancer survival trends and in the socioeconomic inequalities in survival. Results One year net survival improved steadily from 1996 for 26 of 41 sex-cancer combinations studied, and only from 2001 or 2006 for four cancers. Trends in survival accelerated after 2006 for five cancers. The deprivation gap observed for all 41 sex-cancer combinations among patients with a diagnosis in 1996 persisted until 2013. However, the gap slightly decreased for six cancers among men for which one year survival was more than 65% in 1996, and for cervical and uterine cancers, for which survival was more than 75% in 1996. The deprivation gap widened notably for brain tumours in men and for lung cancer in women. Conclusions Little evidence was found of a direct impact of national cancer strategies on one year survival, and no evidence for a reduction in socioeconomic inequalities in cancer survival. These findings emphasise that socioeconomic inequalities in survival remain a major public health problem for a healthcare system founded on equity.

This study characterized geographic access to parent and satellite NCI cancer center facilities nationally overall and by sociodemographics. Parent and satellite NCI cancer center facilities, which were geocoded in ArcGIS, were ascertained. Travel times from every census tract in the continental United States and Hawaii to the nearest parent and satellite facilities were calculated. Census-based population attributes were used to characterize measures of geographic access for sociodemographic groups. From the 62 NCI cancer centers providing clinical care in 2014, 76 unique parent locations and 211 satellite locations were mapped. The overall proportion of the population within 60 minutes of a facility was 22% for parent facilities and 32.7% for satellite facilities. When satellites were included for potential access, the proportion of some racial groups for which a satellite was the closest NCI cancer center facility increased notably (Native Americans, 22.6% with parent facilities and 39.7% with satellite facilities; whites, 34.8% with parent facilities and 50.3% with satellite facilities; and Asians, 40.0% with parent facilities and 54.0% with satellite facilities), with less marked increases for Hispanic and black populations. Rural populations of all categories had dramatically low proportions living within 60 minutes of an NCI cancer center facility of any type (1.0%-6.6%). Approximately 14% of the population (nâ=â43,033,310) lived more than 180 minutes from a parent or satellite facility, and most of these individuals were Native Americans and/or rural residents (37% of Native Americans and 41.7% of isolated rural residents). Racial/ethnic and rural populations showed markedly improved geographic access to NCI cancer center care when satellite facilities were included. Cancer 2017;123:3305-11.

To investigate the potential impact of treatment guidelines based on CVD risk thresholds at a national level requires individual level data representing the multi-variable CVD risk factor profiles for a countryâs total adult population. As these data are seldom, if ever, available, we aimed to create a synthetic population, representing the joint CVD risk factor distributions of the adult New Zealand population. Methods and results A synthetic population of 2,451,278 individuals, representing the actual age, gender, ethnicity and social deprivation composition of people aged 30â84 years who completed the 2013 New Zealand census was generated using Monte Carlo sampling. Each âsyntheticâ person was then probabilistically assigned values of the remaining cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors required for predicting their CVD risk, based on data from the national census national hospitalisation and drug dispensing databases and a large regional cohort study, using Monte Carlo sampling and multiple imputation. Where possible, the synthetic population CVD risk distributions for each non-demographic risk factor were validated against independent New Zealand data sources. Conclusions We were able to develop a synthetic national population with realistic multi-variable CVD risk characteristics. The construction of this population is the first step in the development of a micro-simulation model intended to investigate the likely impact of a range of national CVD risk management strategies that will inform CVD risk management guideline updates in New Zealand and elsewhere.

It is unclear which is the more vulnerable population according to the effect sizes of celebrity suicides to general population. All suicide victims in the general population verified by the Korea National Statistical Office and suicides of celebrity in South Korea were included for 7 years from 2005 to 2011. Effect sizes were estimated by comparing rates of suicide in the population one month before and after each celebrity suicide. The associations between suicide victims and celebrities were examined. Among 94,845 suicide victims, 17,209 completed suicide within one month after 13 celebrity suicides. Multivariate logistic regression analyses revealed that suicide victims who died after celebrity suicide were significantly likely to be of age 20-39, female, and to die by hanging. These qualities were more strongly associated among those who followed celebrity suicide with intermediate and high effect sizes than lower. Younger suicide victims were significantly associated with higher effect size, female gender, white collar employment, unmarried status, higher education, death by hanging, and night-time death. Characteristics of celebrities were significantly associated with those of general population in hanging method and gender. Individuals who commit suicide after a celebrity suicide are likely to be younger, female, and prefer hanging as method of suicide, which are more strongly associated in higher effect sizes of celebrity suicide.\n\nSleep Complaints in the Adult Brazilian Population: A National Survey Based on Screening Questions\n\nPubMed Central\n\nBittencourt, Lia Rita A.; Santos-Silva, Rogerio; Taddei, Jose A.; Andersen, Monica L.; de Mello, Marco T.; Tufik, Sergio\n\n2009-01-01\n\nStudy Objectives: The aim of the current survey was to investigate the prevalence of sleep complaints in a randomized cluster sample of the Brazilian population. Methods: A 3-stage cluster sampling technique was utilized to randomly select Brazilian subjects older than 16 years, of both genders and all socioeconomic classes. The final sample of 2,110 subjects from 150 different cities was enough to estimate prevalence in the Brazilian population with a sampling error of Â± 2%. Questions about sleep complaints were administered face-to-face by Instituto Datafolha interviewers on March 26 and 27, 2008. Data were expanded using a weighted variable. Results: Of all interviewed subjects, 63% reported at least one sleep related complaint. Sleep complaint prevalence increased with age and was similar among inhabitants of different Brazilian regions, as well as between metropolitan areas and smaller cities. Insomnia and nightmares were significantly more prevalent in women (40% and 25%, respectively), and snoring was more prevalent in men (35%). For sleep complaints with frequencies greater than 3 times per week, we found the following prevalence: 61% for snoring, 35% for insomnia, 17% for nightmares, 53% for leg kicking, and 37% for breathing pauses. Conclusions: Because sleep disorders are affect a high proportion of the population and are known to be correlated with decreased well-being and productivity, more detailed national surveys are necessary to provide relevant information to develop approaches to prevention and treatment.

It is unclear which is the more vulnerable population according to the effect sizes of celebrity suicides to general population. Methods All suicide victims in the general population verified by the Korea National Statistical Office and suicides of celebrity in South Korea were included for 7 years from 2005 to 2011. Effect sizes were estimated by comparing rates of suicide in the population one month before and after each celebrity suicide. The associations between suicide victims and celebrities were examined. Results Among 94,845 suicide victims, 17,209 completed suicide within one month after 13 celebrity suicides. Multivariate logistic regression analyses revealed that suicide victims who died after celebrity suicide were significantly likely to be of age 20-39, female, and to die by hanging. These qualities were more strongly associated among those who followed celebrity suicide with intermediate and high effect sizes than lower. Younger suicide victims were significantly associated with higher effect size, female gender, white collar employment, unmarried status, higher education, death by hanging, and night-time death. Characteristics of celebrities were significantly associated with those of general population in hanging method and gender. Conclusion Individuals who commit suicide after a celebrity suicide are likely to be younger, female, and prefer hanging as method of suicide, which are more strongly associated in higher effect sizes of celebrity suicide.

Variations in place of cancer deaths have previously been reported in the context of country-specific healthcare organization, but without differentiating between cancer types and national regional variations. Our aim was to examine, at a population level, where people with cancer diseases die in Sweden, and to investigate associations of place of death and cancer type with individual, socioeconomic and geographical characteristics of the deceased. This population level study is based on death certificate data (sex; age; underlying cause of death and place of death) and population register data (educational attainment, marital status, living arrangements, area of residence, degree of urbanization, and healthcare region) of all 2012 cancer deaths in Sweden, with a registered place of death (hospital, nursing home, home, other places). Data were explored descriptively. To investigate associations between place of death and cancer types, and individual, socioeconomic and environmental characteristics, a series of multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed. The most frequent type of cancer death occurring at home was upper gastrointestinal cancer (25.6%) and the least frequent was hematological cancer (15.2%). Regional variations in cancer deaths occurring at home ranged from 17.1% to 28.4%. Factors associated with place of death by cancer type were age, educational attainment, marital status, healthcare regions and degree of urbanization. Large healthcare regional variations in place of death among different cancer types were found. The socioeconomic inequality previously demonstrated for screening, diagnostic and treatment processes, rehabilitation and survival thus also seems to be reflected in the place of death.\n\nLong-term Mortality Risk After Hyperglycemic Crisis Episodes in Geriatric Patients With Diabetes: A National Population-Based Cohort Study.\n\nPubMed\n\nHuang, Chien-Cheng; Weng, Shih-Feng; Tsai, Kang-Ting; Chen, Ping-Jen; Lin, Hung-Jung; Wang, Jhi-Joung; Su, Shih-Bin; Chou, Willy; Guo, How-Ran; Hsu, Chien-Chin\n\n2015-05-01\n\nHyperglycemic crisis is one of the most serious diabetes-related complications. The increase in the prevalence of diabetes in the geriatric population leads to a large disease burden, but previous studies of geriatric hyperglycemic crisis were focused on acute hyperglycemic crisis episode (HCE). This study aimed to delineate the long-term mortality risk after HCE. This retrospective national population-based cohort study reviewed, in Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database, data from 13,551 geriatric patients with new-onset diabetes between 2000 and 2002, including 4,517 with HCE (case subjects) (ICD-9 code 250.1 or 250.2) and 9,034 without HCE (control subjects). The groups were compared and followed until 2011. One thousand six hundred thirty-four (36.17%) case and 1,692 (18.73%) control subjects died (P < 0.0001) during follow-up. Incidence rate ratios (IRRs) of death were 2.82 times higher in case subjects (P < 0.0001). The mortality risk was highest in the first month (IRR 26.56; 95% CI 17.97-39.27) and remained higher until 4-6 years after the HCE (IRR 1.49; 95% CI 1.23-1.81). After adjustment for age, sex, selected comorbidities, and monthly income, the mortality hazard ratio was still 2.848 and 4.525 times higher in case subjects with one episode and two or more episodes of hyperglycemic crisis, respectively. Older age, male sex, renal disease, stroke, cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and congestive heart failure were independent mortality predictors. Patients with diabetes had a higher mortality risk after HCE during the first 6 years of follow-up. Referral for proper education, better access to medical care, effective communication with a health care provider, and control of comorbidities should be done immediately after HCE.

The majority of epidemiological studies of tics have focused on children and youth, with few studies describing the prevalence of tics in adult populations. Canadian data on Tourette syndrome prevalence were derived from the Canadian Community Health Survey 2010 and 2011 cycles, a Statistics Canada population-based cross-sectional survey that collects information related to health status. We determined the prevalence of diagnosed Tourette syndrome and examined sociodemographic factors, including age, sex, education, income, employment, and birthplace. Overall, 122,884 Canadians participated in the surveys, with 122 participants diagnosed with Tourette syndrome. The prevalence of Tourette syndrome was higher in males in youth: 6.03 per 1000 (95% confidence interval: 3.24-8.81) in males versus 0.48 per 1,000 (95% confidence interval: 0.05-0.91) in females, with a prevalence risk ratio of 5.31 (95% confidence interval: 2.38-11.81). In adults, the prevalence of Tourette syndrome was 0.89 per 1,000 (95% confidence interval: 0.48-1.29) in males versus 0.44 (95% confidence interval: 0.16.0-0.71) in females, with a prevalence risk ratio of 1.93 (95% confidence interval: 1.21-3.08). After adjusting for age and sex, adults with Tourette syndrome had lower odds of receiving postsecondary education or being employed and higher odds of having income lower than the median and receiving governmental support. Data on the prevalence of Tourette syndrome in adults are scarce because most studies focus on children. Our data demonstrate a decreasing prevalence risk ratio for sex in adults compared to children. A diagnosis of Tourette syndrome is associated with lower education, income, and employment in adulthood. Â© 2016 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.

Design and baseline characteristics.\n\nPubMed\n\nRubin, Katrine Hass; Holmberg, Teresa; Rothmann, Mette Juel; HÃ¸iberg, Mikkel; Barkmann, Reinhard; Gram, Jeppe; Hermann, Anne Pernille; Bech, Mickael; Rasmussen, Ole; GlÃ¼er, Claus C; Brixen, Kim\n\n2015-02-01\n\nThe risk-stratified osteoporosis strategy evaluation study (ROSE) is a randomized prospective population-based study investigating the effectiveness of a two-step screening program for osteoporosis in women. This paper reports the study design and baseline characteristics of the study population. 35,000 women aged 65-80 years were selected at random from the population in the Region of Southern Denmark and-before inclusion-randomized to either a screening group or a control group. As first step, a self-administered questionnaire regarding risk factors for osteoporosis based on FRAX(Â®) was issued to both groups. As second step, subjects in the screening group with a 10-year probability of major osteoporotic fractures â¥15% were offered a DXA scan. Patients diagnosed with osteoporosis from the DXA scan were advised to see their GP and discuss pharmaceutical treatment according to Danish National guidelines. The primary outcome is incident clinical fractures as evaluated through annual follow-up using the Danish National Patient Registry. The secondary outcomes are cost-effectiveness, participation rate, and patient preferences. 20,904 (60%) women participated and included in the baseline analyses (10,411 in screening and 10,949 in control group). The mean age was 71 years. As expected by randomization, the screening and control groups had similar baseline characteristics. Screening for osteoporosis is at present not evidence based according to the WHO screening criteria. The ROSE study is expected to provide knowledge of the effectiveness of a screening strategy that may be implemented in health care systems to prevent fractures.\n\nAlcohol consumption and cardiorespiratory fitness in five population-based studies.\n\nPubMed\n\nBaumeister, Sebastian E; Finger, Jonas D; GlÃ¤ser, Sven; DÃ¶rr, Marcus; Markus, Marcello Rp; Ewert, Ralf; Felix, Stephan B; Grabe, Hans-JÃ¶rgen; Bahls, Martin; Mensink, Gert Bm; VÃ¶lzke, Henry; Piontek, Katharina; Leitzmann, Michael F\n\n2018-01-01\n\nBackground Poor cardiorespiratory fitness is a risk factor for cardiovascular morbidity. Alcohol consumption contributes substantially to the burden of disease, but its association with cardiorespiratory fitness is not well described. We examined associations between average alcohol consumption, heavy episodic drinking and cardiorespiratory fitness. Design The design of this study was as a cross-sectional population-based random sample. Methods We analysed data from five independent population-based studies (Study of Health in Pomerania (2008-2012); German Health Interview and Examination Survey (2008-2011); US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 1999-2000; NHANES 2001-2002; NHANES 2003-2004) including 7358 men and women aged 20-85 years, free of lung disease or asthma. Cardiorespiratory fitness, quantified by peak oxygen uptake, was assessed using exercise testing. Information regarding average alcohol consumption (ethanol in grams per day (g/d)) and heavy episodic drinking (5+ or 6+ drinks/occasion) was obtained from self-reports. Fractional polynomial regression models were used to determine the best-fitting dose-response relationship. Results Average alcohol consumption displayed an inverted U-type relation with peak oxygen uptake ( p-value<0.0001), after adjustment for age, sex, education, smoking and physical activity. Compared to individuals consuming 10âg/d (moderate consumption), current abstainers and individuals consuming 50 and 60âg/d had significantly lower peak oxygen uptake values (ml/kg/min) (Î² coefficientsâ=â-1.90, Î²â=â-0.06, Î²â=â-0.31, respectively). Heavy episodic drinking was not associated with peak oxygen uptake. Conclusions Across multiple adult population-based samples, moderate drinkers displayed better fitness than current abstainers and individuals with higher average alcohol consumption.\n\nEtiology and management of esophageal food impaction: a population based study.\n\nPubMed\n\nGretarsdottir, Helga M; Jonasson, Jon Gunnlaugur; BjÃ¶rnsson, Einar S\n\n2015-05-01\n\nEsophageal food impaction (FI) is a common clinical problem with limited information on incidence. Previous population based studies are lacking. The incidence, main etiological factors, recurrence and outcome of FI was determined in the present study in a population based setting. This was a study of consecutive adult patients who presented with FI from 2008 to 2013 at the National University Hospital of Iceland. The mean crude incidence rate of FI was calculated. Retrospective analysis was undertaken on relevant clinical data such as type of bolus, management, complications, recurrence rate, risk factors for recurrence, and outcome. Overall 308 patients had endoscopically confirmed FI, males 199/308 (65%), median age 62 years. The mean crude incidence was 25 per 100,000 inhabitants per year. The types of FI was meat (68%), fish (12%), vegetable (4%) and other food/objects (16%). Causes for the FI included: esophageal strictures (45%), hiatal hernia (22%), eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) (16%) and esophageal carcinoma (2%). Recurrence appeared in 21%, in which 24/48 (50%) had EoE vs. 40/260 (15%) in others (p = 0.0001). The removal of the foreign body was successful in 98% of the cases during the first endoscopy. Endoscopic associated complications included four (1.3%) aspirations, one (0.3%) esophageal perforation and one Boerhaave syndrome at presentation (both had EoE). The incidence of FI is the highest reported to date. EoE was strongly associated with recurrence of FI. In a population based setting endoscopy is a safe and effective procedure for removing FI.\n\nImportance of population-based studies in clinical practice\n\nPubMed Central\n\nRonnie, George; Ve, Ramesh Sathyamangalam; Velumuri, Lokapavani; Asokan, Rashima; Vijaya, Lingam\n\n2011-01-01\n\nIn the last decade, there have been reports on the prevalence of glaucoma from the Vellore Eye Survey, Andhra Pradesh Eye Diseases Survey, Aravind Comprehensive Eye Survey, Chennai Glaucoma Study and West Bengal Glaucoma Study. Population-based studies provide important information regarding the prevalence and risk factors for glaucoma. They also highlight regional differences in the prevalence of various types of glaucoma. It is possible to gather important insights regarding the number of persons affected with glaucoma and the proportion with undiagnosed disease. We reviewed the different population-based studies from India and compare their findings. The lacunae in ophthalmic care that can be inferred from these studies are identified and possible reasons and solutions are discussed. We also discuss the clinical relevance of the various findings, and how it reflects on clinical practice in the country. Since India has a significantly high disease burden, we examine the possibility of population-based screening for disease in the Indian context.

We examined long-term outcomes for pediatric HCM. Methods -The National Australian Childhood Cardiomyopathy Study is a longitudinal population-based cohort study of children (0-10 years) diagnosed with cardiomyopathy between 1987 and 1996. The primary study end-point was time to death or cardiac transplantation. Results -There were 80 patients with HCM with median age at diagnosis of 0.48 (Inter-quartile range [IQR] 0.1, 2.5) years. Freedom from death/transplantation (95% confidence interval [CI]) was 86 (77-92)% one year after presentation, 80 (69-87)% at 10 years and 78 (67-86)% at 20 years. From multivariable analyses, risk factors for death/transplantation included symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy at the time of diagnosis (hazard ratio [HR] 4.20 95%CI 1.60, 11.05 p=0.004), Noonan syndrome (HR 2.88, 95%CI 1.02, 8.08, p=0.045), higher posterior wall thickness z-score (HR 1.45, 95%CI 1.22, 1.73, p<0.001) and lower fractional shortening z-score (HR 0.84, 95%CI 0.74, 0.95, p=0.005) during follow-up. Nineteen (23%) subjects underwent left ventricular myectomy. At median 15.7 years' follow-up, 27 (42%) of 63 survivors were treated with beta-blocker and 13 (21%) had an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator. Conclusions -The highest risk of death or transplantation for children with HCM is within one year post-diagnosis, with low attrition rates thereafter. Many subjects receive medical, surgical or device therapy.\n\nSubsequent mortality after hyperglycemic crisis episode in the non-elderly: a national population-based cohort study.\n\nPubMed\n\nKao, Yuan; Hsu, Chien-Chin; Weng, Shih-Feng; Lin, Hung-Jung; Wang, Jhi-Joung; Su, Shih-Bin; Huang, Chien-Cheng; Guo, How-Ran\n\n2016-01-01\n\nHyperglycemic crisis episodes (HCEs)-diabetic ketoacidosis and the hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state-are the most serious acute metabolic complications of diabetes. We aimed to investigate the subsequent mortality after HCE in the non-elderly diabetic which is still unclear. This retrospective national population-based cohort study reviewed, in Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database, data from 23,079 non-elder patients (â¤65 years) with new-onset diabetes between 2000 and 2002: 7693 patients with HCE and 15,386 patients without HCE (1:2). Both groups were compared, and follow-up prognoses were done until 2011. One thousand eighty-five (14.1%) patients with HCE and 725 (4.71%) patients without HCE died (P < 0.0001) during follow-up. Incidence rate ratios (IRR) of mortality were 3.24 times higher in patients with HCE than in patients without HCE (P < 0.0001). Individual analysis of diabetic ketoacidosis and hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state also showed the similar result with combination of both. After stratification by age, mortality was significant higher in the middle age (40-64 years) [IRR 3.29; 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.98-3.64] and young adult (18-39 years) (IRR 3.91; 95% CI 3.28-4.66), but not in the pediatric subgroup (<18 years) (IRR 1.28; 95% CI 0.21-7.64). The mortality risk was highest in the first month (IRR 54.43; 95% CI 27.98-105.89), and still high after 8 years (IRR 2.05; 95% CI 1.55-2.71). After adjusting for age, gender, and selected comorbidities, the mortality hazard ratio for patients with HCE was still four times higher than for patients without HCE. Moreover, older age, male gender, stroke, cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, congestive heart failure, and liver disease were independent mortality predictors. HCE significantly increases the subsequent mortality risk in the non-elderly with diabetes. Strategies for prevention and control of comorbidities are needed as soon as possible.\n\nNeonatal morbidity in moderately preterm infants: a Swedish national population-based study.\n\nPubMed\n\nAltman, Maria; VanpÃ©e, Mireille; Cnattingius, Sven; Norman, Mikael\n\n2011-02-01\n\nTo determine the gestational age (GA)-specific risks for neonatal morbidity and use of interventions in infants born at 30 to 34 completed gestational weeks. A population-based Swedish study including 6674 infants born during 2004-2008. Risks for neonatal morbidity and use of interventions were investigated with respect to GA and birth weight standard deviation scores. Acute lung disorder was diagnosed in 28%, hypoglycemia in 16%, bacterial infection in 15% and hyperbilirubinemia in 59% of the infants. Thirty-eight percent had received antenatal steroid therapy, 43% nasal continuous positive airway pressure, 5.5% required mechanical ventilation, 5.2% were treated with surfactant, and 30% with antibiotic therapy. Neonatal morbidity rates increased with decreasing GA, with odds ratios for different outcomes ranging from 2.1 to 23 at 30 weeks compared with 34 weeks of GA. Low birth weight standard deviation scores was more common at lower GA and was associated with increased morbidity rates. Despite general advances in perinatal care, moderately preterm infants still have substantially increased risks for neonatal morbidity. Whereas the neonatal morbidity rate was similar to results of previous reports, management of respiratory problems differed markedly from other studies. Copyright Â© 2011 Mosby, Inc.

We describe the development and validation of a SASmacro tool that calculates population-based cancer site-specific relative survival estimates comparable to those obtained through SEER*Stat. The NPCR relative survival analysis SAS tool (NPCR SAS tool) was developed based on the relative survival method and SAS macros developed by Paul Dickman. NPCR cancer incidence data from 25 states submitted in November 2012 were used, specifically cases diagnosed from 2003 to 2010 with follow-up through 2010. Decennial and annual complete life tables published by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) for 2000 through 2009 were used. To assess comparability between the 2 tools, 5-year relative survival rates were calculated for 25 cancer sites by sex, race, and age group using the NPCR SAS tool and the National Cancer Institute's SEER*Stat 8.1.5 software. A module to create data files for SEER*Stat was also developed for the NPCR SAS tool. Comparison of the results produced by both SAS and SEER*Stat showed comparable and reliable relative survival estimates for NPCR data. For a majority of the sites, the net differences between the NPCR SAS tool and SEER*Stat-produced relative survival estimates ranged from -0.1% to 0.1%. The estimated standard errors were highly comparable between the 2 tools as well. The NPCR SAS tool will allow researchers to accurately estimate cancer 5-year relative survival estimates that are comparable to those produced by SEER*Stat for NPCR data. Comparison of output from the NPCR SAS tool and SEER*Stat provided additional quality control capabilities for evaluating data prior to producing NPCR relative survival estimates.\n\nThe Relationship between General Population Suicide Rates and Educational Attainment: A Cross-National Study\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nShah, Ajit; Bhandarkar, Ritesh\n\n2009-01-01\n\nSuicides are associated with both high and low levels of intelligence and educational attainment in both individual-level and aggregate-level studies.

We estimated prevalence in PERUDIAB study participants, a nationwide, stratified urban and suburban population selected by random cluster sampling. Between 2010 and 2012, questionnaires were completed and blood tests obtained from 1677 adults â¥25â years of age. Known diabetes was defined as participants having been told so by a doctor or nurse and/or receiving insulin or oral antidiabetic agents. Newly diagnosed diabetes was defined as fasting plasma glucose â¥126â mg/dL determined during the study and without a previous diabetes diagnosis. IFG was defined as fasting plasma glucose of 100-125â mg/dL. The estimated national prevalence of diabetes was 7.0% (95% CI 5.3% to 8.7%) and it was 8.4% (95% CI 5.6% to 11.3%) in metropolitan Lima. No gender differences were detected. Known and newly diagnosed diabetes prevalences were estimated as 4.2% and 2.8%, respectively. A logistic regression response surface model showed a complex trend for an increased prevalence of diabetes in middle-aged individuals and in those with no formal education. Diabetes prevalence was higher in coastal (8.2%) than in highlands (4.5%; p=0.03), and jungle (3.5%; p<0.02) regions. The estimated national prevalence of IFG was 22.4%, higher in males than in females (28.3% vs 19.1%; p<0.001), and higher in coastal (26.4%) than in highlands (17.4%; p=0.03), but not jungle regions (14.9%; p=0.07). This study confirms diabetes as an important public health problem, especially for middle-aged individuals and those with no formal education. 40% of the affected individuals were undiagnosed. The elevated prevalence of IFG shows that nearly a quarter of the adult population of Peru has an increased risk of diabetes.\n\nPrevalence of diabetes and impaired fasting glucose in Peru: report from PERUDIAB, a national urban population-based longitudinal study\n\nPubMed Central\n\nSeclen, Segundo N; Rosas, Moises E; Arias, Arturo J; Huayta, Ernesto; Medina, Cecilia A\n\n2015-01-01\n\nObjectives We aimed to estimate the prevalences of diabetes and impaired fasting glucose (IFG) in a national sample in Peru and assess the relationships with selected sociodemographic variables.

This study was based on the National Health Insurance Research Database of Taiwan, which contains data on all medical beneficiary claims from 22.72 million enrollees, accounting for almost 99% of the Taiwanese population. The Longitudinal Health Insurance Database 2005, a subset of the National Health Insurance Research Database, contains data on all medical benefit claims from 1997 through 2010 for a subset of 1 million beneficiaries randomly sampled from the 2005 enrollment file. For epidemiological analysis we selected subjects whose claims records included the diagnosis of upper urinary tract urolithiasis. The age adjusted rate of medical care visits for upper urinary tract urolithiasis decreased by 6.5% from 1,367/100,000 subjects in 1998 to 1,278/100,000 in 2010. There was a significantly decreasing trend during the 13-year period in visits from female and all subjects (r(2) = 0.86, p = 0.001 and r(2) = 0.52, p = 0.005, respectively). In contrast, an increasing trend was noted for male subjects (r(2) = 0.45, p = 0.012). The age adjusted prevalence in 2010 was 9.01%, 5.79% and 7.38% in male, female and all subjects, respectively. The overall recurrence rate at 1 and 5 years was 6.12% and 34.71%, respectively. Male subjects had a higher recurrence rate than female subjects. Our study provides important information on the epidemiology of upper urinary tract stone disease in Taiwan, helping to quantify the burden of urolithiasis and establish strategies to decrease the risk of urolithiasis.

However, after a large-scale national immunization initiative, Lebanon was able to prevent a potential outbreak of polio among nationals and refugees. In this work, we used a computational individual-simulation model to assess the risk of poliovirus threat to Lebanon prior and after the immunization campaign and to quantitatively assess the healthcare impact of the campaign and the required standards that need to be maintained nationally to prevent a future outbreak. Acute poliomyelitis surveillance in Lebanon was along with the design and coverage rate of the recent national polio immunization campaign were reviewed from the records of the Lebanese Ministry of Public Health. Lebanese population demographics including Syrian and Palestinian refugees were reviewed to design individual-based models that predicts the consequences of polio spread to Lebanon and evaluate the outcome of immunization campaigns. The model takes into account geographic, demographic and health-related features. Our simulations confirmed the high risk of polio outbreaks in Lebanon within 10Â days of case introduction prior to the immunization campaign, and showed that the current immunization campaign significantly reduced the speed of the infection in the event poliomyelitis cases enter the country. A minimum of 90% national immunization coverage was found to be required to prevent exponential propagation of potential transmission. Both surveillance and immunization efforts should be maintained at high standards in Lebanon and other countries in the area to detect and limit any potential outbreak. The use of computational population simulation models can provide a quantitative approach to assess the impact of immunization campaigns and the burden of infectious diseases even in the context of population migration.\n\nDevelopment of a Late-Life Dementia Prediction Index with Supervised Machine Learning in the Population-Based CAIDE Study\n\nPubMed Central\n\nPekkala, Timo; Hall, Anette; LÃ¶tjÃ¶nen, Jyrki; Mattila, Jussi; Soininen, Hilkka; Ngandu, Tiia; Laatikainen, Tiina; Kivipelto, Miia; Solomon, Alina\n\n2016-01-01\n\nBackground and objective: This study aimed to develop a late-life dementia prediction model using a novel validated supervised machine learning method, the Disease State Index (DSI), in the Finnish population-based CAIDE study. Methods: The CAIDE study was based on previous population-based midlife surveys. CAIDE participants were re-examined twice in late-life, and the first late-life re-examination was used as baseline for the present study. The main study population included 709 cognitively normal subjects at first re-examination who returned to the second re-examination up to 10 years later (incident dementia nâ=â39). An extended population (nâ=â1009, incident dementia 151) included non-participants/non-survivors (national registers data). DSI was used to develop a dementia index based on first re-examination assessments. Performance in predicting dementia was assessed as area under the ROC curve (AUC). Results: AUCs for DSI were 0.79 and 0.75 for main and extended populations. Included predictors were cognition, vascular factors, age, subjective memory complaints, and APOE genotype. Conclusion: The supervised machine learning method performed well in identifying comprehensive profiles for predicting dementia development up to 10 years later. DSI could thus be useful for identifying individuals who are most at risk and may benefit from dementia prevention interventions. PMID:27802228\n\nDevelopm"
