        "text": "[dropcap style=”style1″]N[/dropcap]iantic Labs has announced that they have received funding to the tune of $30 million from Google, The Pokemon Company, and Nintendo.\n\nVietgame.asia – Recently Google did that corporate restructuring of all their companies, creating a new top-tier company called Alphabet. When that happened, Niantic Labs actually was removed from being owned by Google, becoming their own true entity. Today the Ingress developer has announced that they have received funding to the tune of $30 million from Google, The Pokémon Company, and Nintendo. It is a pretty interesting mix.\n\nSo what is this funding for? Well the funding is split into a couple of parts. Niantic Labs gets $20 million upfront, with another $10 million to be dished out in parts as certain milestones are reached. Part of this funding is to push further and future development of Nintendo‘s and The Pokémon Company‘s upcoming Pokémon GO mobile game, which is Niantic Labs‘s current project. The funding is also for continued support of Ingress, increase Niantic Labs‘s location-based platform in general, and bring new games to market as well.”Pokémon’s strategic investment in Niantic paves the way for a social mobile experience the world has never seen before. The Pokémon Company is committed to partnering with companies like Niantic Labs that share the same spirit of community and innovation,” – Tsunekazu Ishihara, president and CEO of The Pokémon Company."
