Together, we aimed to inspire and empower the next generation of tech leaders. üó£Ô∏è As part of our collaboration, we hosted a career talk with a panel of Niantic employees, sharing insights and experiences from various roles within our company. Our team members were excited to connect with these bright, aspiring students, offering guidance and answering their questions about careers in technology. üöå In addition, we had the pleasure of welcoming Mission Bit students to our office for an immersive field trip. They explored our work environment, learned about our projects, and experienced life at Niantic. It was a fantastic opportunity for the students to see the potential career paths available to them and to envision themselves in the tech industry. ü§ù We believe in the power of education and mentorship to create meaningful opportunities for young people. Our partnership with Mission Bit is a testament to our commitment to fostering diversity and inclusion within the tech community. ‚ù§Ô∏è Thank you, Mission Bit, for your dedication to empowering youth and for allowing us to be part of this incredible journey.
