Patari also offers Premium Subscriptions, so users pay a small amount of money to hear music in higher quality, be able to download it and listen to it ad free. Finally they plan to have sponsored playlists.\n\nThe fact that Patari would hit a nerve with music lovers isn’t surprising.

Naweed I Syed\n\nPosted on by\n\nDr. Naveed I Syed is a world renowned scientist of Pakistani origin and the Head of the Department of Cell Biology and Anatomy at the University of Calgary’s Hotchkiss Brain Institute in Canada.He is the first scientist to connect brain cells to a silicon chip. Dr. Syed has travelled worldwide giving lectures and presenting presentations about the human mind and his mini chip. One of the most important contributions of Dr Naweed was to ‘connect brain cells to a silicon chip’, the first scientist to do so.\n\nThis opened up a field of unimaginable potential bringing artificial intelligence to the next stage. He estimates that science fiction type ‘Machine Men’ may be developed in one or two decades, with the use of his silicon chip.The discovery ‘Brain on a chip’ is a major step in the research of integrating computers with human brains to help people control artificial limbs, monitor people’s vital signs, correct memory loss or impaired vision.\n\nLive Stream on campus:\n\nBeing able to monitor the dialogue between cell and silicon chip is a crucial step toward one day manipulating it, raising the possibility of neurochip implants that can help restore sight or language after a stroke, or repair neurons that malfunction in a wide range of brain disorders, from Parkinson’s disease to Alzheimer’s.\n\nUntil now, the Calgary group had conducted most of its research on cells taken from rat and snail brains. Snail neurons, Dr. Syed said, are four to 10 times the size of human brain cells and easier to manipulate on a chip one millimeter square.\n\n“That’s what the dream really is all about .where a man made device can be integrated into living human tissue and become part of it,” Dr. Syed said.The humbling part, he said, has been the complex wiring of the human brain.”A lot of people still think bionics is science fiction,” Dr. Syed said. “It’s not. It’s already here.”\n\nMore in the feild of Neuro Genetics.

The first Pokémon games were released in 1996 on the Game Boy .Basically, the game takes place in a world full of Pokémon, monsters of various sizes that can be captured by tiny red balls and tamed by Pokémon trainers.The game, which marries a classic 20-year old franchise with augmented reality, has taken the world by storm despite having been launched in only five countries the United States, Australia, New Zealand, Britain and Germany.\n\nSo What’s Pokémon Go?\n\nLast week, Niantic Labs released a new augmented reality game featuring the monsters from the video game series, and it’s called Pokémon GO. The basic premise is the same as the normal games: players have to capture, train and fight Pokemon. The big difference is that thePokémon are now located in the real world, at least, sort of. Pokémon GO is a GPS enabled game that asks the players to walk around their neighborhoods and hunt down Pokémon. Allows you to take photos of Pokémon in all sorts of weird places and then share them.\n\nIt’s geocaching, basically, which you might be familiar with, just with game mechanics and visuals layered on top of it. The CEO of developer Niantic Labs is John Hanke, who is one of the original chief architects of Google Earth. The head of the developer behind Nintendo Co Ltd’s (7974.T) Pokemon GO said he wanted to launch the smash-hit mobile game in roughly 200 countries and regions “relatively soon” and was working on bolstering server capacity to enable the wider rollout.\n\nThe Fandom was perfectly set up for Pokémon Go:\n\nNintendo has something called the “same generation hypothesis,” which says that certain audiences stick with their childhood games even after they’ve grown out of the perceived target audience. Pokémon was one of those games, and Nintendo saw it in the data. Pokémon has been a hugely popular brand for two decades, and that recognition, combined with the novel idea of hunting in your backyard, has caught hold. So when Pokémon Go came out, it already had a massive built in audience of people who had devices that could play the game.\n\nPokémon GO: Tips, tricks and cheats :\n\nIf you’re looking to get an edge on other players, here are a few tips and tricks that you might find useful.The most common pokémon are found in the 2km eggs, with the rarest in the 10km eggs .which means you’re in for a lot of walking if you want to advance in the game. But that’s where Rusty Cage’s hack comes in. for more on the hacks visit. PokéStops and the world.\n\nFinding Gyms and Pokestops\n\nThe portals from Ingress and the Pokestops and gyms from Pokémon Go are at the same locations.Therefore, using the ingress intel map will provide you with your Pokémon Go map. I haven’t found an official map yet, but this has served the purpouse so far.\n\nOr just look for any of the following, as they are typically great hubs:\n\nShopping centers\n\nParks\n\nMuseums\n\nChurches\n\nCity Landmarks (city hall etc)\n\nHistorical Landmarks (statues etc)\n\nCollege Campuses\n\nAny other tourist location\n\nPokestops and Gyms in Pakistan\n\nStarted by Imdad Khan, a number of helpful Pokemon Go players have pooled their information together to plot all the known Gyms and Pokestops on a map. As of yet, it contains around 65 locations in Karachi, 35 in Lahore, 63 in Islamabad/Rawalpindi, 3 in Multan, 1 in Rahim Yar Khan, 3 in Bhera and 3 in Abbottabad. You can click on the link below to head over to the map.\n\n‘Pokémon Go’ Craze Raises Safety Issues\n\nAdvancing in the game involves collecting items such as “Poké Balls,” which are needed to catch monsters, and can be found at “PokéStops.” Players use captured creatures to fight other players at “gyms.” Social media is full of reports of players hurting themselves by tripping and falling while glued to their phone screens.The authorities have warned people not to drive while searching for characters .\n\nThe game “could be potentially leading people into areas where they don’t belong,” such as construction sites or shuttered storefronts.Which may lead to trespassing /breach. Law enforcement has warned people to be mindful while exploring. Pokemon Go app craze could be used by pedophiles to lure unsuspecting young players.\n\nDownload the App Here :\n\nPokemon Go (iOS):\n\nhttps://itunes.apple.com/nz/app/pokem…\n\nPokemon Go (Android):\n\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/de…\n\nSocial : Pokémon Go , @PokemonGoApp , Website : http://www.pokemongo.com/\n\nWukla.com Pakistan’s First Online Legal Solution’s Paltform.\n\nPosted on by\n\nPakistan’s First Online Legal Solution Portal .

Explore Faraday Future’s groundbreaking racecar.\n\nThe design features a glass roof, which offers a clear view of the white carbon fiber interior and some of the car’s more novel ideas, like a smartphone mount in the center of the steering wheel, the Halo Safety System that supports the driver’s head and neck, and a helmet that feeds the driver water and oxygen. The instrument panel is also designed to gather biometric data about the driver .The goal was to build a car with a sixth sense for its driver’s intentions and needs. One with adaptive personalization, seamless transfer of custom vehicle configurations, access to live images, and real tihina me data visualization.\n\nThe Mean machine looks more appropriate for a race track than a city street thanks to a claimed 1,000 horsepower, a 0-60 time under three seconds, and a top speed over 200 miles per hour. Of course, those are all purely theoretical numbers since this is just a concept, though the company teases that it could see “limited production.” . For the powertrain, they started from the ground up with the Variable Platform Architecture (VPA). It features a new battery structure that’s centrally placed for integrity and arranged into modular strings\n\nSculpted by aerodynamics for driving performance and efficiency, the smooth, flowing surfaces of the FFZERO1 Concept morph from one unique element to another, creating volumes that tightly embrace the driver—ultimately forming an ideal environment for high performance operation.\n\nSource : Faraday Future , FF\n\nProfiling: The Origami Micro bot.\n\nPosted on by\n\nAt the recent International Conference on Robotics and Automation Researchers from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and the Technische Universität München (TU Munich) . Have unveiled a small origami robot that can fold itself, walk around, and even self-destruct. Small enough to sit on a fingertip ,Weighing only a third of a gram, the robot can swim, climb an incline, traverse rough terrain, and carry a load twice its weight.\n\nThe robot’s design was motivated by a hypothetical application in which tiny sheets of material would be injected into the human body, navigate to an intervention site, fold themselves up, and, when they had finished their assigned tasks, dissolve.They also possess skills that may come in handy to combat human ailments. Experts believe this new technology can be used to help doctors perform key medical operations from within the patient’s body.\n\nA multi-stage folding process can also be achieved by heating the robot at varying degrees. Low heat can give the shape-shifting robot one form, but placing it back on the heating pad and raising the temperature can result in a secondary design. The Only component is a permanent magnet affixed to its back. Its motions are controlled by external magnetic fields. Its amazing self folding powers can be attributed to the sheet of polyvinyl chloride embedded within each of the several prototypes created by its inventors to find the optimal material. The commonly found plastic contracts when subjected to temperatures of about 150° F.\n\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript.\n\nInstead using a set of wires to make the robot move, it uses an external magnetic field made up of four coils to guide it along its path. These magnets power its movement by cycling on and off at 15 hertz. MIT graduate student Cynthia R. Sung, co-developer of the robot says unlike traditional robots, all these motions are “embedded into the mechanics of the robot body.” This means that it does not need external “legs,” motors, or other movement enabling appendages to be mobile.\n\nThis causes the magnet that the robot is attached to oscillate back and forth, and the robot oscillates as well. As this happens, the front and back legs of the robot alternately contact the ground, and the asymmetry of the design combined with the intentionally off-center balance point causes the robot to walk forward. None of this works with the robot in its unfolded, flat configuration: it has to be folded into this shape to walk at all. The Smaller robot could be inserted into an individual’s body, navigate through the bloodstream, perform medical tasks and then eventually dissolve in the stomach.\n\nThe technology could also be used for planetary explorations. The robot could be programmed to collect various soil samples or even journey through small cracks in the ground.\n\nAdapted : MIT\n\nThe Thiel Deal #ZerOtoOne.\n\nPosted on by\n\nPeter Thiel hardly needs an introduction; his name has been tied to some of the most successful companies of our time ,He is an American entrepreneur, venture capitalist,hedge fund manager, and social critic.He also co-founded Palantir, of which he is chairman. He was the first outside investor in Facebook .Over the span of his career, he has had the chance to watch companies make it and break it, he taught a class at Stanford University covering everything he knew about startups.The class,was developed out of Founders Fund and specifically, notes taken by a student led to the publication of his book, Zero to One.\n\nHere is its description of “zero to one”:\n\n“Zero to One” describes the process of creating something radically new and taking it to the first step (Horizontal or intensive growth). The phrase is used in contrast to the term “1 to n” (Vertical or extensive growth), which means creating incremental improvements to what is already familiar. The aim of the phrase is to encourage more “zero to one”, or entrepreneurial, behavior. There are Three kinds of innovation:\n\nPerformance-improving innovations that replace old products with new and better models.\n\nEfficiency innovations that help companies make and sell mature, established products or services to the same customers at lower prices.\n\nMarket-creating innovations that “transform complicated or costly products so radically that they create a new class of consumers, or a new market.”\n\nBy Contrast Market creating innovations are the most important of these, because they usually generate whole new industries, new jobs and new economic growth.\n\nThiel speaks from experience. He was involved in a number of successful market creating firms. He cofounded PayPal, which was sold in 2002 for $1.5 billion. The team that he put together at PayPal is known in Silicon Valley as the “PayPal Mafia.” It included a number of entrepreneurs who have gone on to launch successful startups. “Elon Musk has founded SpaceX and co-founded Tesla Motors; Reid Hoffman co-founded LinkedIn; Steve Chen, Chad Hurley , and Jawed Karim together founded YouTube; Jeremy Stoppelman and Russel Simmons founded Yelp; David Sacks co-founded Yammer. Thiel also helped fund the launch of Facebook.\n\nThe core philosophy of his book is ,If you do what has never been done and you can do it better than anybody else, you have a monopoly and every business is successful exactly insofar as it is a monopoly. But the more you compete, the more you become similar to everyone else. From the tournament of formal schooling to the corporate obsession with outdoing rivals, competition destroys profits for individuals, companies, and society as a whole.The next Bill Gates will not build an operating system. The next Larry Page or Sergey Brin won’t make a search engine. Tomorrow’s champions will not win by competing ruthlessly in today’s marketplace. They will escape competition altogether, because their businesses will be unique.Not all truly innovative design is completely “zero to one”, however. Facebook was not completely “Zero to One”, as it built on ideas that were improvements over Friendster and Myspace. But it is important to note that Facebook’s improvements were not incremental improvements rather it started doing things differently from a new zero ground.\n\nI think we can all agree that some types of work have more “zero to one” characteristics than other types of work. For example, the creation of the Thiel Fellowship was definitely a “zero to one” event, and Peter Thiel’s creation of the fellowship was partially inspired by the need to inspire more people to do truly “zero to one” work.\n\nSocio Economic Startups,Profiling The Latitude Project\n\nPosted on by\n\nThe two sisters Alanna & Jennifer Tynan grew up in the small mountainous town of Nelson, Canada BC .Causing trouble and playfulness of the mountains, rivers and lakes. As children they had spent many winters in small villages in latin America, Mexico seeing firsthand a reality much different from their own. Though the culture was vibrant and the people were jovial, it was impossible to ignore the poverty.\n\nThey came to understand that things are done differently around the world but we recognized that basic needs transcend physical borders. The need for clean water. Sanitary living conditions. Access to health services. Basic education. Basic human rights that people in many areas of the world do not have the means to access. This lead for them to start the Latitude Project so that they could partner with communities and do what they can to help.\n\nThere Adventurous personalities lead them to go on ventures the love for campfire, spontaneous road trips and being part of something much bigger than there selves. They clame not to be a couple of Mother Theresas there imperfect humans with a desire to leave the world a little better than it was when they got here. There lovers of this fragile and wonderful life and staunch believers in the sentiment that to improve and enjoy the world are not mutually exclusive. And luckily,There not the only ones.\n\nThey explore, listen and respond. Communities express what they need and they work together to achieve that change. This way, projects are locally embraced and sustained over time. Each unique project is reflective of differing customs, cultures, and ever-changing needs. 100% of public donations fund projects on the ground without trickling through administration fees: from education facilities to medical initiatives, roofs to clean water, Latitude helps people meet their basic needs so they can live their own adventures.\n\nSource: https://www.facebook.com/thelatitudeproject ,Email info@thelatitudeproject.com,\n\nE-Retail Jousting,Future of Mobile payements\n\nPosted on by\n\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript.\n\nIts here one of the biggest weekends for online retailers and eCommerce companies .Top Electronic retailers have launched cyber Warfare this weekend marking thanks giving .

At Sooam a technique known as the somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT), in it the nucleus of an oocyte (egg cell) is removed and replaced by that of a somatic (body) cell from the mature specimen being cloned. These cells are fibroblasted. They’re taken via skin biopsy from the abdomen and cultured in a lab. Once the cell nucleus is in place,electricity is used to fuse the nucleus and oocyte together into a reconstructed embryo that’s implanted into a surrogate mother. Dogs have some complicated reproductive traits that make the species difficult to clone; most problematic, the ovulation cycles are irregular, and the eggs are in a mature state and optimal for cloning for only a few hours.\n\nBioPremium K9, an another such startup making into the Clone animal market They provide premium grade canines that are able to protect and save the lives of our citizens.\n\nNotes:http://en.sooam.com/dogcn/sub01.html, https://www.facebook.com/sooambiotechhttp://www.boyalifegroup.com/english/introduction.aspx , http://premiumk9.com/\n\nTech Mela to hit the Shores. #TECHFEST\n\nPosted on by\n\nGoogle has initiated its support and has announced the largest web shopping festival in Pakistan,Referred to as the ‘Tech Mela’ or like i would say a TECH FEST!! , the online shopping fest will be ,the first of its kind in the country’s already gigantic e-commerce market.Tech Mela is scheduled to run for a duration of 10 days, starting by the September 11 and will end on September 20.

An application tool that has allowed people to connect to the web in the most remote of areas in order to improve and further there lives. Now, more people are getting online, using these free tools for health, education, jobs and communication putting an end to poverty, and discovering the value of the internet.\n\nAfter launching free basic services, mobile operators are seeing people adopt mobile data 50% faster than before. More than half the new people coming online through Internet.org choose to pay for data and access more internet services within the first 30 days. In June, people used Internet.org to access online health services more than one million times.\n\nStudies show that for every 10 people who gain access to the internet, around one person is lifted out of poverty. If we can connect the 4 billion people with internet access, we can help raise hundreds of millions out of poverty. An application for the free service can be found here for Android & IOS platforms .Alongside the app launch, Internet.org is also experimenting with drones and satellites to deliver internet to remote areas.\n\nTo continue making progress, we’re expanding free basic services to even more operators by making it easier for them to offer Internet.org. We also recently announced the Internet.org Platform to help any developer worldwide offer their services.\n\nNotes:\n\nHip New Chika’s shaping Technology\n\nPosted on by\n\nThis Article aims to encourage Women locally / Abroad to take up the Appropriate education,empowerment of women. which will lead to a prosperous Nation Pakistan.\n\nMany women have contributed to Pakistan’s technology industry and have made a name for themselves,The concept of Women in Technology or towards Entrepreneurship in Pakistan is a new one.

And eventually from the rain when it comes. So, despite the lack of rain (for the next 72 hours at least) it’s still worthwhile speaking to you about KAZbrella.\n\nThe Device was invented by 61-year-old Jenan Kazim from Hertfordshire ,UK . It is a one of a kind revolutionary design that has several benefits .Mr Kazim, is an aeronautical engineer,he came up with the idea after his mother in law complained her regular umbrella had dripped all over the floor of her house.The idea started as a mere concept seven years ago and in May 2015 the family run business launched a campaign through Kickstarter to fund the manufacturing process.\n\nSO WHAT’S EXACTLY IS A KAZBRELLA?\n\nKAZbrella has challenged an age long umbrella design and know it turns inside out, similar to how a flower opens vice versa to the original design of the umbrella.There are many benefits from the reverse folding mechanism .\n\nSome of the features discussed in the video above are:\n\nDrip free.\n\nDry to hold.\n\nOpens and closes easily in confined spaces.\n\nAvoids poking people in the eye.\n\nDoesn’t easily break in strong wind.\n\nTo close the umbrella you pull it up, instead of pulling it down as is the case with a normal brolly. The KAZbrella has been designed to operate for the user in the same way as a conventional umbrella. All you need to do is open and close the KAZbrella as you would a regular umbrella.But it has resolves some of the problems that have been lingering on with conventional umbrellas.\n\nThey successfully raised £265,397 and expect to deliver the first batch of KAZbrellas in October (2015) .The KAZbrella is currently being manufactured. It will be available to purchase from this website (www.kazbrella.com) in the second half of 2015.

Here is an updated list for 2015 .\n\nMost Entrepreneur visa schemes ask for entrepreneurs to show investments in the range of $40,000 to $100,000. Start-Up Chile is a program for those who want to accelerate and develop a world-class startup in Chile, while helping to shape the local culture and embrace entrepreneurship. Applicant to the Chilean visa with it comes a grants of 20 million pesos (approx $35K).\n\nFrench Minister of State for the digital economy Axelle Lemaire announced a new entrepreneur visa package called the French Tech Ticket. With this package,foreign entrepreneurs could get a work visa, a $14,000-$28,000 grant (€12,500-€25,000) for each team member, free office space in an incubator in Paris as well as an English-speaking administrative advisor. Announced at La French Touch Conference and limited to 500 applications for now, teams who want to apply need to be co-founders, with at most three co-founders and one French founder who lives abroad. They need to work on a startup, speak English and stay at least six months in France. The French Government is partnering with the city of Paris for the incubator part of the package.\n\nStart-up Visas programs spreading like mushrooms:\n\nSo far in 2015 Denmark, France and the Netherlands have already launched national programs to attract foreign entrepreneurs to start companies.Their visa schemes have a few things in common,which is to offer fast-track and specific processes to foreign entrepreneurs with special guidance from local incubators to navigate the system. Denmark and France have put quotas in place. The Netherlands (wisely) has not. Ireland just reformed their immigration system to lower the minimum funding requirement to apply to the visa, and have passed a law to make it easy to recruit foreign talents for startups in hope to better attract global global talent to its tech industry.\n\nGlobal trend of startup visas this year 2015 has attracted France, Denmark, Netherlands and South Korea; and more are to come (Israel and US). South Korea isn’t the first country in Asia to offer a visa or other type of residency permit specifically to entrepreneurs. Hong Kong’s investment visa, Singapore’s EntrePass, Japan’s visa extension for entrepreneurs, and the Philippines’ investor and employment generation visas all serve similar functions.\n\nIn the US, strong business and tech lobbies have been pushing for an immigration reform that would introduce a US start-up visa. President Obama announced that the US will make it easier and faster for entrepreneurs to come to the US and start businesses but nothing has yet happened.\n\nWhich countries have the easiest Entrepreneur Visa process?\n\nIt is difficult to say, as rules are not always matching reality. On paper, the Italian, Dutch and Spanish visa look very attractive. Both countries promise a quick processing turnaround (30 days maximum). In Spain, all documentations submitted have to be translated in Spanish. In Italy,the application is reduce to the strict minimum: sending electronically a CV and filling out an online application form. The application form can be filled in English.\n\nThe “cheapest” Entrepreneur visa is in Chile where you are not asked to bring investment to the country, quite the opposite: they provide you with funding! This said, it does not mean it is easy to get because you will have to get accepted in the very selective Startup Chile Accelerator.\n\nOnly Canada offers a permanent resident visa. All other countries provide only a temporary visa to Entrepreneurs. It positions Canada Entrepreneur visa as the most welcoming. For European countries such as France ,Spain or Italy, the visa is a temporary one but easily renewable.\n\nConclusion\n\nInterning or working at a startup overseas is a great way to hone your professional skills while immersing yourself in an exciting, new city. As we all know, in today’s post-recession world, a Bachelor’s degree no longer guarantees solid employment. But here’s the silver lining: Just as important as the piece of paper you receive upon graduation is your real-world experience, and international exposure can really set you apart.\n\nMost visas are easier to get if you have been accepted in an accelerator. Entrepreneurs have to prove their business and achieve the renewal requirements in terms of job created and revenue generated. It also has a flexible immigration system that makes it easy and simple for start-up to hire foreigners.The programs could well provide the spark for the US and or the EU to launch programs that attract talent, create jobs and foster innovation on a larger scale.\n\nOriginally published on Migreat Blog http://wp.me/p2rYvz-fE .\n\n24.861462 67.009939\n\nRed Hot : Iron Man-themed Galaxy S6 edge\n\nPosted on by\n\nSamsung has teamed up with Marvel and has launched the Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge Iron Man Limited Edition smartphone in select countries.

A Cyber crime is Any activity commissioned via computer, digital devices and networks used in the cyber realm, and is facilitated through the internet medium. It can include the distant theft of information belonging to an individual, government or corporate sector through criminal tress-passing into unauthorized remote systems around the world.\n\nIt includes from stealing millions of rupees from online bank to harassing and stalking cyber users. Cyber Crime also includes sending viruses on different systems, or posting defamation messages. Cyber crime has now surpassed illegal drug trafficking as a criminal moneymaker . Somebody’s identity is stolen every 3 seconds as a result of cyber crime . Staying on the identity theft organization such as AASHA which means “hope” are working , helping to root out harassment against women of all ages from the society . “It is unfortunate that people are not educated in respecting other people’s privacy, specifically of women,”\n\nGoverning Bodies:\n\nFIA under NR3C National Response Centre for Cyber Crimes has the exclusive authority to pursue cyber crimes under PECO, the Pakistan Electronic Crime Ordinance 2007, one of two laws that monitor Pakistan’s cyber space. The other is ETO, the Electronic Transaction Ordinance 2002, that provides for “legal sanctity and protection of e-commerce locally and globally”\n\nPakistan is one of the few countries where cyber crime laws are still in the pipeline waiting for implementation . Pakistan is currently facing the following types of cyber crimes .\n\nFinancial crimes\n\nCyber/Child pornography\n\nSale of illegal articles\n\nOnline gambling\n\nIntellectual property crimes\n\nEmail spoofing\n\nCyber stalking\n\nForgery\n\nUnauthorised access to computer systemsnetworks\n\nTheft of information contained in electronic form\n\nVirus/worm attacks\n\nLogic bombs\n\nTrojan attacks\n\nInternet time theft\n\nPassword cracking\n\nBuffer overflow\n\nThe offences appearing are triable by Court of Sessions, are non-bailable, compoundable and cognizable. Except the offences punishable with imprisonment of seven years or more. The punishment is for persons, groups or organizations who commit terroristic acts with terroristic intent using computers or computer networks.\n\nAll these offences are triable by the Information and Communication Technologies Tribunal whose principal seat would be at Islamabad and may hold sittings at other places. Till the time the tribunal is not established all the cases, proceedings and appeals offences appearing below will continue to be heard and decided by the competent forum existing under any law for the time being in force\n\nConclusion:\n\nIn the absence of Clearer Cyber Crime laws through which punitive action can be taken against those committing crimes on the cyber world in Pakistan, people are increasingly becoming victims of abuse on social media sites, internet frauds, etc. The complaint of fake Facebook profiles is the most rampant complaint where people created fake a profile of any person, in most cases of girls but men were no exception to this crime.\n\nPML-N legislator Anoosha Rehman Khan, who is a member of the parliamentary committee on technology, receives many complaints of misuse of social media and harassment of women.\n\n“I am very much on to address such concerns,” she said.\n\nShe admitted glaring loopholes exist in the legal field regarding child pornography, but said a select committee has been formed in the National Assembly to look into the revival of PECO 2007.\n\n“All un-addressed abuses against women and children and other segments of society, whether through social networking sites or any other form of electronic means, will be addressed in the new PECO,” she assured Dawn newspaper .\n\nHowever she could not provide a timeline for the urgent task.\n\nhttp://cyber-crime-law.com/cyber-crime-news-pakistan-it-security-internet-network-information/\n\nhttp://www.nr3c.gov.pk/faq.html\n\nhttp://www.nr3c.gov.pk/cybercrime.html\n\nhttp://www.aasha.org.pk/about_aasha.php\n\nCash In on the Bitcoin Boom Now\n\nPosted on by\n\nOne bitcoin, which doesn’t actually have a real, physical form, is worth at this moment upwards of $18,000 ,Bitcoin Cash is currently trading at $1,759 per pop, a decline of 5% in the last 24 hours. Its price hit a high of $2,080.41 at 06:59 UTC yesterday. It has a market capitalization of $1.4 billion in the markets.\n\nRipple is now the third biggest cryptocurrency, thanks to its surging prices. At 17:51 UTC, Ripple was trading at $0.78, up 4% in the last 24 hours. Yesterday its price shot up to as much as $0.89 before paring back its gains. Ripple’s market capitalization is $4.7 billion, as of this writing.\n\nBitcoin Cash and Ripple are completely different beasts. The former came into existence only this August after a hard fork in bitcoin’s blockchain. With a bigger transaction block size than its parent, the cryptocurrency is aimed at increasing the volume and speed of transactions on bitcoin’s blockchain. It is yet to develop a coherent business model or utility within the cryptocurrency ecosystem\n\nRight now, bitcoin looks increasingly like a tool for speculation rather than a viable, mainstream currency. And one scientific law that math, physics, and economics all share is this: Bubbles pop."
