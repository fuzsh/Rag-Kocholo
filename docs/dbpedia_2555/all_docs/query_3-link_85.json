        "text": "This no longer applies if you have Application Control as signatures have now been created to stop this\n\nAs I’ve been asked this a few times recently, I thought I’d share the method I’ve used to successfully block the Pokemon Go app from successfully connecting to the servers, effectively stopping it from connecting through the firewall.\n\nHowever, if users have 3/4G access, then this guide will not work.\n\nThere may be a cleaner way to do this, but as a quick solution, this works well.\n\nAssuming that the WG is licensed for Webblocking…\n\nUsing WebBlocker and HTTPS Proxy, how to block Pokemon Go…until they update their servers.\n\nThis is a quick and dirty method to blocking the game until either App Control is updated with signatures for this specific title, or the servers are updated. Whichever comes sooner.\n\nStep 1: Edit the Webblocker service that’s associated with a HTTPS proxy\n\nCreate an exception, and have a pattern match for .nianticlabs.com/ and set it to deny.\n\nThe ethics of allowing BYOD onto the corporate LAN are for another discussion.\n\nIt is easy to block games that connect to the internet through the network and almost all professional grade (and even consumer products) have blocking solutions ranging from “always” to “time specific.” If your employees are using company phones that are running Android, Google has device policies that are linked to company domain emails that alter an Android phone’s security settings when that email address is added to the phone. This can be used to block apps that fall under the “game” category. If you are talking about blocking apps on employees’ personal devices over their personal network, that is illegal. Aside from banning the use of personal devices at work or attaching metal plates and screens around your building the only thing you can do is use a cell phone jammer, and if you do… well, have fun in prison.\n\nAside from blocking it over your company network, this is an HR issue and I would dump it on them ASAP before your asked to do something that could end you up in jail.\n\nI hate blanket blocks based on keywords. I ran into this problem in IT when in television all the time. (I was not in IT at the time, just a user) GAMES was blocked, but if a reporter or producer wanted to research a legit story about GAMES on a GAMES NEWS SITE which featured no actual gaming, the site would be blocked.\n\nThis is the same IT that blocked Hulu and Netflix, but allowed less reputable streaming sites, even for live sports broadcasts. Almost nothing was blocked if you knew something other than American English. /shrug"
