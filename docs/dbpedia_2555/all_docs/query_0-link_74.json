        "text": "2. Overview ● Augmented Reality (AR) and how it is a form of Location Based Narrative ● Layar-ed ● Pokemon Go\n\n3. What is Location Based Narrative? “Audience members receive narrative elements as they physically navigate through a geographical story space”- Valentina Nisi ➔ Narrative A story that is told or written (Merriam- Webster) ➔ Physically Navigate Move through the world we live in ➔ Story Space Socially constructed reality (setting of a book, facebook timelines, etc)\n\n4. What is Augmented Reality? “Technology that mixes the real environment with the virtual, is registered in 3D, real time, and interactive”- Liao\n\n5. LAYAR What Is It? “Layar is a global leader in Augmented Reality and Interactive Print, helping to bridge the gap between the print and digital worlds. The Layar app has been downloaded over 46 million times. Brands are provided access to an expanding audience of tech-savvy consumers eager to unlock the physical world with a digital experience.” - Layar Website\n\n6. LAYAR-ED PLACES “All the informants who created layers reported that their practices of augmentation and the potential for augmentation changed their relationship with places around them” Technology today allows us to communicate with our surroundings in a mediated space, by controlling our experiences and practices. An application like Layar allows us to have a little power over this form of technology in any place. Thus, creating a unique relationship between a user and a location, in this case.\n\n7. LAYAR-ED PLACES Examples: ● Memorials ● Information ● Art ● Private communication\n\n8. Pokemon Go\n\n9. Pokemon Go And Location Based Narrative Pokemon Go brings the world of Pokemon into the “real” world Profiting from the game Pokeconomy article: ● Use game hotspots to increase foot traffic to local businesses Pokemon Trainer article: ● Pokemon Chauffeurs ● Pay someone to play for you The company profits through in app purchases as players train their pokemon."
