I spoke about these data points and many other useful insights last week in my keynote at the opening of the CEE Apps Summit in Cyprus. Three main takeaways I wanted to leave the audience with: (1)The importance of apps in business has grown significantly in recent years, and this trend is expected to continue. This is due to the increasing use of mobile devices by CEE consumers, as well as the benefits that apps can offer businesses, such as increased customer engagement, loyalty, and profitability. (2) In addition, apps can be used to collect and utilize first-party data, which is becoming increasingly valuable in the digital age where compliance to user consent and responsibility are key. (3) Finally, AI-powered solutions can help businesses to promote their apps more effectively and reach a wider audience. #apps #cee #AI #google"
