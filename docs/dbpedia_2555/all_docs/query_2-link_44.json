        "text": "Thames River Community Service, Inc. (TRCS) was established in 1992, dedicated to providing critical housing and support services to formerly homeless individuals and families primarily of New London County. We serve area youths ages 18-24 who are at risk of homelessness. We offer a range of comprehensive services include counseling referrals, job readiness, and transitional housing. Our mission is accomplished by promoting family and individual wellness, by empowering an achievable plan for successful independent living, to pursue significant employment, to acquire life skills and to maintain stability.\n\nAt Thames River Community Service, Inc., we believe that every person deserves the chance to thrive, and we are committed to ensuring that our clients have the support they need every step of the way. Whether you are a client, partner, or donor, we invite you to join us in making a positive impact in Southeastern CT.\n\nAdvocates and other supportive staff work closely with families coming from shelters to assist them in becoming employed and/or more employable, helping them to gain financial literacy by learning to budget and improve their credit, to acquire tenancy skills and to overcome criminal histories. There also is a great deal of effort to provide support and resources around the needs of their children by working collaboratively with other area social service providers and the educational system as well as mental health and wellness facilities. Staff works together with families to establish achievable goals in these areas so that they can leave TRFP for permanent housing in less than a year. Today, our families are parenting youth ages 18 to 24 years old. We are the only Youth Transitional Housing Program serving families in Connecticut.\n\nAs a transitional housing program with a length of stay of one year or less in Norwich, we serve new families as other families complete the program.\n\nImmediate access to permanent housing with no preconditions such as employment, income, absence of criminal record or sobriety,\n\nOnce housing is established, services will be offered according to the unique needs and choices of each youth, using a low barrier approach that emphasizes community integration, stability and recovery.\n\nGoals are individualized and client driven. They will have input and final decisions on action steps and timelines, as well as housing and service options.\n\nThere are three components of rapid rehousing: (1). Housing Identification, (2) Rent and Move-in Assistance, (3) Case Management and Services\n\nDiversity, Equity, and Inclusion Statement\n\nThames River Community Service, Inc. (TRCS) believes everybody deserves to live with dignity and respect, and we are committed to supporting policies and practices of racial, cultural, and economic equity that empower a just, inclusive, and equitable world.\n\nFundamental principles of diversity, equity, and inclusion arise from our inherent desire to care for all individuals in our community on a human level and we understand that feeling included is fundamentally essential to thrive both professionally and personally.\n\nThis commitment informs our mission to help low-income families and families experiencing homelessness reinforce family bonds by achieving stable housing and financial independence. Existing and historic systems of power in our society grant privilege and access unequally, based on factors such as race/ethnicity, age, religion, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, religion, marital status, socioeconomic status, involvement in the carceral system, geography, and ability.\n\nWe recognize that our community is directly impacted by these factors of exclusion, and we are committed to combating this inequality and working towards justice for all. TRCS aims to ensure that our organization embodies the values, policies, and practices that ensure that all people are represented in the development of our policies and programs, and in the fair distribution of programmatic, financial, and informational resources.\n\nAs an employer this means that we are examining policies and practices regarding hiring, professional development, internal advancement, wage equity, employee support, board recruitment, and internal communications. We engage in intentional dialogues that nurture respect and communication that encourage our staff, volunteers, and board members to reflect, listen to each other, and learn from one anotherâ€™s experience.\n\nAs a service provider this means we acknowledge that structural racism is intimately tied to the causes of homelessness. We are examining our outcomes to identify areas where we can improve our policies to combat bias and be more equitable and inclusive in our services. We aim for our staff, volunteers, and board members to be allies for each other and understand that vulnerability is needed in order to address the nuances and complexities of this work.\n\nThese are important reflections for us at TRCS as we continue to learn what it takes to fully implement our commitment to equity in all of our work, including the collective effort to end homelessness. We look forward to ongoing conversations with funder colleagues, nonprofit leaders and community members. It is critical to work together to change the systems driving homelessness. Only then will we begin to see an enduring transformation."
