In Variety's third annual Digital Entertainment Impact Report, we highlight 30 executives making waves at CES and beyond. (We do not repeat those included on prior lists, many of whom remain prime movers in this space.)\n\nTim Armstrong\n\nCEO\n\nAOL\n\nThe former top Google exec and entrepreneur sold AOL to Verizon for $4.4 billion in 2015, and now he's poised to get his hands on Yahoo, setting the stage for a scaled internet-ad player to challenge behemoths Facebook and Google. A big caveat: Verizon is reviewing Yahoo's massive data breach (disclosed after the deal with the telco was signed), which may shrink the $4.8 billion price tag. Analysts believe Armstrong has a track record that equips him to consolidate the sprawling operations of AOL and Yahoo into a more efficient unit. He's shown a willingness to trim ranks, eliminating 5% of AOL's workforce late last year, ahead of the Verizon integration. \"Assuming the Yahoo deal closes, we'll be bringing awesome brands to a billion consumers,\" says Armstrong. \"2017 is going to be a very busy year.\"\n\nRich Battista\n\nPresident/CEO\n\nTime Inc.\n\nThe TV industry veteran, who took the reins in September 2016, is pushing the publisher to exploit digital and video in a bigger way--and he wants to bring brands like Time, People, and Sports Illustrated to television. Battista, the former CEO of Mandalay Sports Media and ex-president of Fox's national cable networks group, led the launch this year of Time Inc.'s first over-the-top offering, the People/Entertainment Weekly Network, a free, advertiser-supported, streaming-video service. In a world awash with fake news, Battista is banking on Time Inc.'s nearly 100-year legacy to forge bigger opportunities online. \"Building trusted media brands is something that takes years to cultivate,\" he says. In 2017, he'll also be navigating the M&A waters: Battista and the Time Inc. board reportedly rejected a $1.8 billion bid by an investor group that included Len Blavatnik and Edgar Bronfman Jr.\n\nClay Bavor\n\nVP, Virtual Reality\n\nGoogle\n\nSince joining Google in 2005, Bavor has worked on a range of projects, including heading the product management and design teams that built Gmail, Google Docs, and Google Drive. He's led the internet company's virtual-reality push since 2014, as one of the original creators of the Google Cardboard viewer, and he oversaw the launch of the Daydream headset. More virtual-and augmented-reality content and devices are on tap for 2017. \"You can imagine traveling to faraway destinations, standing on stage with your favorite artists, or playing in new worlds,\" says Bavor, who created his first VR project when he was 12, using Apple's HyperCard and hundreds of scanned photographs to create a virtual version of his parents' house.\n\nJim Berk\n\nCEO\n\nPodcastOne\n\nHow big can the podcasting phenomenon get? It's no fad, says Berk, former CEO of indie entertainment company Participant Media (the studio behind Oscar winner \"Spotlight\"). PodcastOne currently hosts more than 200 podcasts, including shows from Adam Carolla, Shaquille O'Neal, Steve Austin, Dr. Drew, and Malcolm McDowell. In addition to growing its output of 320-plus hours of weekly content, Berk is looking to expand internationally. As the radio biz and others look to jump into internet-powered distribution of audio programming, PodcastOne is in a unique position to dominate the sector, he claims. \"The sheer volume of content has created so much noise in the marketplace, it's becoming increasingly difficult for content to find an audience,\" Berk says.\n\nLyor Cohen\n\nGlobal Head of Music\n\nYouTube\n\nThe world's biggest video platform has had tense relations with the music industry, sparring over royalty rates and piracy. So Google hired Cohen, a noted (and notorious) figure in the business, to mend fences. The former head of Warner Music Group's recorded music unit and CEO of indie label 300 Entertainment wants to ensure that YouTube's position in music--its biggest single segment--remains robust and growing. He points out that the company paid record labels $1 billion in ad revenue alone for the 12 months that ended October 2016. \"Everyone's focused on subscriptions, but ads are a huge opportunity for the music industry,\" Cohen says. \"Having the creative community work more collaboratively with Google and YouTube is also an enormous opportunity.\"\n\nTim Connolly\n\nSenior VP/Head of Distribution & Partnerships\n\nHulu\n\nAs Hulu gets set to launch a live \"skinny bundle\" of TV programming early this year, Connolly has played a critical role in what is the company's most significant new business initiative since launching subscriptions in 2010. He oversees Hulu's strategic relationships and carriage deals with TV networks. That includes local station groups, which the company and its media-conglomerate owners expect will mark a key difference from other OTT players like DirecTV Now, Sling TV, and PlayStation Vue. Local TV \"provides the best content experience, so that's what we want,\" Connolly said in an interview last year. \"You want to be able to watch the local game.\" Connolly, who ran digital distribution and new product development for Disney and ESPN TV networks before joining Hulu, also manages relationships with device-makers including Apple, Roku, and Google.\n\nJennifer Danielson\n\nPresident\n\nAbove Average\n\nThe internet devours comedy, and Danielson wants to feed that appetite. She worked for Broadway Video boss Lome Michaels for 15 years as a producer on \"Saturday Night Live\" and \"30 Rock\" before he tapped her to launch the Above Average short-form digital comedy studio four years ago. Now Danielson has more cash to pour into development and production, landing $15 million last year from Turner Broadcasting and Advance Vixeid Partners, the independent investment arm of Advance Publications and Conde Nast. \"One of our trademark strengths has been our ability to nurture IP with brilliant creators, no matter if they operate in front of or behind the camera,\" she says.\n\nDaniel Ek\n\nCEO\n\nSpotify\n\nFrom his base in Sweden, Ek has built the world's largest streaming-music service and is fighting with Apple for dominance in the sector. Spotify has more than 100 million listeners overall, including 40 million paying subscribers; that's become a major revenue stream for record companies. And Spotify is stepping up its expansion into original video programming (as is Apple). Ek is expected to take the company public this year, which stands to give the 33-year-old even more firepower in the streaming wars.\n\nSarnie Kim Falvey\n\nChief Content Officer\n\nAwesomenessTV-Verizon\n\nContent Venture\n\nWhat would HBO look like if you had to build it from scratch, and for a generation that isn't exactly electrified by traditional TV? That's the pivotal question for Falvey, who exited as head of comedy for ABC Entertainment last year. She's heading the premium content venture of AwesomenessTV and Verizon (which is as yet unnamed), with the idea that she can sell a bundle of short-form on the telco's Go90 mobile-oriented video platform. Hits that Falvey shepherded at ABC include \"Modern Family,\" \"The Goldbergs,\" \"The Middle,\" and \"Fresh Off the Boat.\" This year, she'll get the chance to put her creative stamp on an entirely new brand of youth programming.\n\nMike Farah\n\nCEO\n\nFunny or Die\n\nFarah, who oversaw production of FOD's viral internet hits like \"Between Two Ferns With Zach Galfianakis\" and TV shows including \"@midnight\" and \"Billy on the Street,\" is now running the entire show at the digital comedy outlet. In November, he secured a major pact with AMC Networks, which has taken a stake in Funny or Die, and the companies plan to collaborate on shows for AMC's IFC network. The deal is an opportunity to reach a bigger audience and pump out a bigger volume of funny stuff, Farah says. But, he adds, the content industry is the midst of a \"massive content bubble.\" The challenge for FOD, which was co-founded by Adam McKay and Will Ferrell, \"is to maintain our creative voice and our premium standards, because those are what really drive us.\"\n\nJordan Gilbert\n\nVP, Digital Production\n\nLionsgate\n\nGilbert's job objective: Bring the internet's biggest talent to movies and TV. As part of Lionsgate's digital studio initiative, he has played an integral role in securing first-look deals with such digital influencers as Grace Helbig, German DJ Flula Borg, and filmmaker Freddie Wong. \"With the rapid proliferation of buyers for premium digital content,\" says Gilbert, \"the challenge isn't finding a home, but finding exactly the right home.\" Before joining Lionsgate, he ran digital programming initiatives at MSN, Yahoo, and Universal Pictures, and was a writer for Funny or Die's \"Billy on the Street.\"\n\nKathleen Grace\n\nCEO\n\nNew Form\n\nAs the former head of creative development for YouTube Space LA, Grace thinks like a digital creator. She was tapped in 2014 by Discovery Communications, Brian Grazer, Ron Howard, and other showbiz execs to launch a next-generation digital studio. Since then, she has led New Form's production of 30 pilots and sold 20 to series, including the company's first linear TV deal: TBS is picking up animated interstellar comedy \"Final Space.\" She also recently raised $18 million in funding from the U.K.'s ITV and Discovery. The major challenge for 2017 and beyond, as Grace sees it, is content discovery. \"Fans are out there. The key is showing them who you are and where you are.\"\n\nAlex Hofmann\n\nPresident, North America\n\nMusically\n\nIn less than three years, the German software exec has helped build Musically into a global community of 160 million phenomenally engaged users. Its secret sauce? Musically makes creating short videos of lip-syncing, singing, dancing, or performing comedy, extremely easy and fun--and layers on social features tuned to its teen and young-adult audience. Hofmann has cultivated relationships with Musically's most popular stars, and in June the company released its live-streaming app, Lively, which quickly caught fire among the \"muser\" base for broadcasting to friends and fans. \"Those who typically considered themselves viewers of content are becoming the creators of it now,\" says Hofmann.\n\nJia Yueting\n\nCEO\n\nLeEco\n\nSeemingly overnight, the Chinese billionaire brought his media and hardware conglomerate to U.S. shores, and has made a splash. Jia announced a deal to buy TV maker Vizio for $2 billion last summer, then rolled out LeEco's line of low-priced smart-phones and TVs, coupled with a subscription service, EcoPass, which provides access to content services like Machinima and Dish's Sling TV. Jia, who goes by \"YT,\" started the company as streaming-video site LeTV.com in 2004 and has expanded into multiple lines of business, including a movie studio and electric cars. He has even more ambitious plans in the States, having acquired 48 acres of property from Yahoo in Santa Clara, Calif., and pledging to hire 12,000 workers for the campus. But can he pull it all off? The company disclosed in November that it may have overextended itself by moving too fast and burning too much cash. However it plays out, Jia and LeEco are worth watching in 2017.\n\nGeorge Kliavkoff\n\nPresident/CEO\n\nJaunt\n\nAfter spending years at Hearst hunting for the next big thing, Kliavkoff thinks he's found it in virtual reality. He joined Jaunt in September, looking to grow the company--whose backers include Disney and Google--from a maker of VR camera rigs into a content platform. Creating professionally produced content at scale, he says, \"will be a key component in accelerating VR's rise to a mass-market medium.\" At Hearst, he served as co-president of the Entertainment & Syndication division, which handles the company's cable networks partnerships and TV production, and was president of Hearst Ventures. A decade ago, when he was NBCUniversal's chief digital officer, Kliavkoff was part of the launch team for Hulu. Before that, he was an exec VP at MLB Advanced Media, overseeing the league's online and mobile subscription and licensing businesses.\n\nIsaac Lee\n\nChief News, Entertainment & Digital Officer\n\nUnivision Communications\n\nThe Colombian-born investigative journalist is spurring the Hispanic media company to forage for millennial digital audiences beyond its TV base. Sure, everyone in the television biz is doing the same. But Lee has made some bold bets, including snapping up six websites last year from Nick Denton's bankrupt Gawker Media (excluding the now-defunct Gawker.com) for $135 million. It's part of Lee's goal of reaching millions of \"young, cross-cultural influences,\" who aren't drawn to linear TV. In addition to his editorial oversight of Univision News and heading up Univision's digital initiatives, Lee manages the Fusion Media Group, which now encompasses the former Gawker sites and the Fusion news and lifestyle network, along with Univision's interests in El Rey, The Root, and The Onion, plus Flama, Univision Digital, and Univision Music. (Disclosure: Variety and Univision are partners in Variety Latino.) It hasn't been all smooth sailing. For example, Gawker editorial staffers bristled when Univision, after the sale, pulled down six blog posts for legal reasons. Meanwhile, the struggling Fusion network laid off staff late last year. One of Lee's strategies for 2017 is to develop shows from digital brands like Gizmodo and The Onion for the cable network, in a bid for cross-platform synergy.\n\nBen Lerer\n\nCEO\n\nGroup Nine Media\n\nLerer is taking the helm of a new digital rollup that pulls in some 3.5 billion video views monthly. But can he make it greater than the sum of its parts? Group Nine, funded with $100 million in cash from Discovery Communications, combines Lerer's Thrillist Group Media lifestyle website with two other startups backed by his father, venture capitalist Ken Lerer: social-news network NowThis Media and animal-focused The Dodo (founded by Ben's sister, Izzie Lerer). Group Nine also incorporates Discovery's Seeker digital network and SourceFed Studios. \"While we have a lot to figure out, the opportunity is massive,\" says Lerer. \"We will be stronger together with incredible scale, better opportunities for advertisers, and greater influence.\" What to look for: Lerer and Discovery envision TV shows potentially emerging from the venture.\n\nJoey Levin\n\nCEO\n\nIAC\n\nIs this the year Vimeo moves into high gear to capture its next big opportunity? Levin, currently interim CEO of the IAC-owned video platform business, has set a course for Vimeo to become a Netflix-style subscription VOD player--but at a fraction of what Reed Hastings shells out for content. Vimeo had 741,000 paying subscribers for its hosting and management services in the third quarter of last year, and Levin sees that loyal creator base, plus 240 million global monthly viewers, as fertile ground for a thriving SVOD service. According to Levin, it's potentially the biggest opportunity yet for Barry Diller's IAC. \"Our platform empowers the most imaginative video creators to disrupt the existing media infrastructure,\" he says. Levin has worked for Diller since 2003. Before his promotion to CEO of IAC, he ran the company's search and applications unit.\n\nJohn Najarian\n\nExec VP/GM of E! News and Digital\n\nE! Entertainment Television\n\nSince integrating the digital and linear divisions of NBCUniversal's E! News in 2015--with a new consolidated newsroom and studio --Najarian has focused on reinventing entertainment and celebrity news for a generation more inclined to tap into their phones than flip on their TVs. He led a deal with Snapchat for the weekly talk show \"The Rundown\" and has helped E! News launch a live-streaming slate that features original series airing each weekday on Facebook Live. Today, its social channels have a combined audience of more than 26 million fans. \"We live in a cluttered media market where content comes at us constantly from all sorts of places, credible or not,\" Najarian says. \"Brands like E! that can reliably deliver compelling, high-quality content matter tremendously in helping consumers, platforms, and advertisers cut through this maze.\"\n\nLisa Nishimura\n\nVP, Original Documentary and Comedy\n\nNetflix\n\nNishimura scored a one-two standup punch last fall. She led Netflix's $40 million pact with Chris Rock for two comedy specials, and a month later announced a deal with Dave Chappelle for an original special and rights to two unreleased older performances. Those were by all appearances the biggest-ticket items Nishimura has secured since launching Netflix's documentary division in 2013. To date, her team has released 19 documentary features, five documentary series, and two documentary shorts, along with multiple standup specials. The lineup includes Ava DuVernay's \"13th,\" Werner Herzog's \"Into the Inferno,\" Liz Garbus' \"What Happened, Miss Simone?,\" Chelsea Handler's talk show, and the Emmy-winning true-crime series \"Making a Murderer.\" Even so, Nishimura notes, Netflix is just entering its fourth year of original programming in documentary and comedy. \"On many fronts it feels as though we're just getting started,\" she says. What Netflix can uniquely provide is a worldwide launch pad for storytellers: \"This ability to spark a global conversation can be a gamechanger.\" Nishimura was hired by Netflix in 2007 to focus on acquiring international independent films. She previously served as GM at Palm Pictures, overseeing production, acquisition, and distribution of more than 75 indie, foreign, and documentary feature films.\n\nAnthony Noto\n\nCOO\n\nTwitter\n\nFor all its cultural influence, Twitter still isn't profitable. Noto, the CFO who stepped into the COO role after Adam Bain exited last fall, is trying to fix that, by cutting costs (Twitter is shedding 9% of its workforce) while boosting user engagement and ad revenue. A key prong in the strategy is adding live-streaming video to win a share of marketing dollars pegged for TV, and Noto led negotiations with the NFL to land rights to stream 10 \"Thursday Night Football\" games last year. The exec admits that to really move the needle, Twitter needs a daily lineup of live programming, and he's expecting more deals on that front in 2017. Twitter's biggest challenge in digital media? \"Convincing more content owners to commit to a new, innovative distribution strategy,\" says Noto, a former Goldman Sachs analyst who also served as CFO of the NFL. Even if Twitter resumes its bid to find a suitor and gets acquired, expect Noto to stay in the game.\n\nJustin Osofsky\n\nVP, Global Operations & Media Partnerships\n\nFacebook\n\nThe former McKinsey & Co. consultant joined Facebook in 2008. He now oversees the company's media partnerships and manages worldwide operations for the service, which counts about 1.2 billion daily active users. A big part of Osofsky's job is to bring aboard publishers and content providers and to provide tools for them to take advantage of Facebook's enormous scope. To jumpstart Facebook's live video initiative, Osofsky led the program to pay select celebrities and media partners--including CNN, Buzzfeed, and The New York Times --to use the feature, reportedly committing $50 million to the effort. (Of course, that's chump change for Facebook, which tallied $7 billion in third-quarter 2016 revenue.) Meanwhile, he's had to publicly address controversies over fake news circulating on Facebook and allegations that its trending-topics picks were biased. Chief Mark Zuckerberg has insisted Facebook isn't a media company, but Osofsky is the one who has to articulate its strategic positioning to partners.\n\nMichael Pauli\n\nVP, Digital Video\n\nAmazon\n\nDoes Amazon want to burrow its way further into the pay TV business with some kind of \"skinny bundle\" or live sports? If it does, Pauli would be the point man for those projects. The exec, who joined the e-commerce giant in 2012, oversees global content, operations, and marketing for Amazon Channels, the over-the-top streaming subscription program that lets Prime members purchase add-on packages from more than 100 providers, including HBO, Starz, Showtime, PBS Kids, and Acorn TV. \"The definition of TV has really changed over the last few years,\" says Pauli, who has held senior leadership positions at Sony Music Entertainment, Fox Entertainment, and Time Warner. He's not spilling the beans about what's next but adds, \"Looking ahead, we will continue to innovate with live streaming.\" Amazon rolled out Prime Video in 200-plus countries last month, giving Pauli a global playing field for launching new partnerships.\n\nScott Reich\n\nSenior VP, Programming\n\nFullscreen Media\n\nHitting the ground running, Reich joined Fullscreen in July, about three months after the company launched its subscription VOD service. The mandate for the exec, who was previously head of programming and originals at Vevo: Fill the pipeline with more content that will persuade Gen-Z and millennial audiences (or their parents) to keep paying the $5-a-month fee. Since then, he's greenlit more than a dozen new series, ranging from scripted long-form such as \"Magic Funhouse,\" an adult show about a fictional kids' show, to unscripted short-form series like \"Lady Bits With Lauren Giraldo\" and the cocktail-fueled talk show \"Apologies in Advance,\" hosted by social-media star Andrea Russett. \"With our platform and the social ecosystem these audiences thrive in,\" says Reich, \"viewers know they'll watch and have access to their favorite talent in unique and unfiltered ways.\"\n\nBen Schwerin\n\nVP, Partnerships\n\nSnap Inc.\n\nSchwerin has been a big part of Snapchat's move into media--which has made the company far more than an app for photos with a short lifespan. The exec oversees relationships with all U.S. and international media-rights holders, and since joining the company two years ago, he has cut deals with the NBA, NFL, MLB, NCAA, Live Nation, and NBCU for the Rio Summer Olympics (with content produced by Buzzfeed). \"Whether it's our community or our media and advertising partners that are storytelling,\" he says, \"we want the creation process, as well as the end result, to be immersive, surprising, and fun.\" Prior to joining Snapchat, Schwerin was co-founder of communications consulting firm Fenway Strategies. From 2003 to 2009, he served as an assistant to former President Bill Clinton and to Irish rock band U2.\n\nNeville Spiteri\n\nCEO\n\nWevr\n\nVirtual reality hasn't taken the world by storm, Spiteri acknowledges. \"The de facto killer app or consumer format for VR has yet to be cracked,\" says the head of VR studio Wevr. But he's optimistic 2017 will be an important year of evolution for the segment. Wevr has produced VR titles including ocean documentary series \"theBlu,\" \"Gnomes & Goblins\" with Jon Favreau, and Deepak Chopra's \"Finding Your True Self.\" The company, with investors that include HTC, Samsung Ventures, and Orange Digital Ventures, has also launched a dedicated VR network, Transport. \"We are convinced that VR is, without any doubt, a transformative new medium of epic scale,\" says Spiteri, who previously worked at Electronic Arts, James Cameron's Digital Domain VFX shop, and gaming company Square Enix.\n\nJohn Stankey\n\nCEO\n\nAT&T Entertainment Group\n\nA three-decade veteran of AT&T, Stankey is one of the most powerful execs in pay TV--and he's only gotten started on reshaping the landscape. After absorbing DirecTV in 2015, the telco serves more than 25 million U.S. customers. Stankey has used that perch to roll out DirecTV Now, an internet TV package that undercuts cable (and, by the way, satellite) on pricing for channel bundles. \"You should expect when a product has a lower cost of capital, it's going to cost less,\" he said in November at the company's launch event. How the economics of DirecTV Now affect TV programmers' revenue remains to be seen. But even more change will be coming to the sector if the government approves AT&T's big bid for Time Warner.\n\nVan Toffler\n\nCEO\n\nGunpowder & Sky\n\nAfter nearly three decades at Viacom and MTV, Toffler decided to set up his own digital-oriented studio last year, teaming with AT&T and Chernin Group's joint venture, Otter Media, and ex-Endemol head of strategy Floris Bauer to form Gunpowder & Sky. In the fall, the company acquired independent content sales and distribution firm FilmBuff, adding to its range of original content operations that include short-form viral videos, short-form series (including one sold to Spotify), and film adaptions of the zombie roadtrip novel \"Eat, Brains, Love\" and Sarah Benincasa's highschool misadventure \"DC Trip.\" In a hyper-cluttered media environment, says Toffler, \"our mission is to take risks on emerging, breakthrough and behind-the-camera talent.\"\n\nPete Vlastelica\n\nPresident/CEO\n\nMajor League Gaming\n\nVlastelica has traded a career in on-the-field sports for one in the virtual realm. He joined MLG last year, after Activision Blizzard acquired the e-sports league to create what execs said will be \"the ESPN of gaming.\" So they hired a digital guy from TV to run it: Vlastelica was previously exec VP of digital at Fox Sports, overseeing live-streaming of events including Super Bowl XLVIII. ESports has tantalizing potential, projected to grow from $493 million in revenue in 2016 to $1.1 billion in 2019, according to research firm NewZoo. Vlastelica says MLG's biggest opportunity as it builds out a new content channel is tapping the 500 million people who play Activision Blizzard's games. \"There's not another opportunity out there like it in all of media right now,\" he says.\n\nTim Westergren\n\nCEO\n\nPandora\n\nWhen Westergren co-founded the music-streaming service back in 2000, Pandora found a welcome audience for its personalized radio format. But consumers have gravitated toward on-demand services like Spotify and Apple Music, and now he's playing catch-up. Westergren took the CEO job in March 2016 after holding management positions throughout Pandora, and over the fall, he sealed deals with record companies large and small. That paves the way for Pandora to launch its Premium on-demand music service in early 2017. To Westergren, who's a composer and musician trained as a jazz pianist, the mission of the company remains the same: \"how to help listeners find what they want, and discover what they'll love, in a virtually infinite sea of digital music.\" Something else to watch for this year: SiriusXM--majority owned by John Malone's Liberty Media--has been seeking to acquire Pandora, which has reportedly been looking for other potential buyers.\n\nTrend to Watch\n\n2016 was clearly a coming-out party for virtual-reality headsets. What's going to become clear in the new year is how content companies have hopped on the bandwagon.\n\nProjected VR unit sales by end of 2016\n\n355k\n\nOculus Rift\n\nGoogle, Sony, and Samsung may be taking this market from the early-adopter niche to critical mass, but it's Hollywood that has put its chips on the VR table in the form of experimental content initiatives, VR-specific jobs, and investments in companies specializing in the space. Disney, Comcast, Time Warner, and HBO led investment rounds, while publishers like Conde Nast, Vice Media, and The New York Times felt their way around.\n\n450k\n\nHTC Vive\n\nFor now, hardware is moving much faster than content, so just what kind of traction VR is finding in the U.S. or abroad is dfficult to say. Estimates of unit sales for the market's first year range anywhere from six figures to $20 million.\n\n2.6m\n\nPS VR\n\nThere are five clear headset leaders: the so-called \"tethered\" VR experiences of Oculus Rift and Sony Playstation VR, and the mobile headsets Samsung Gear VR, Google Daydream, and HTC Vive. The tethered variety brings much better processing power than the mobile options, which essentially provides visor to hold smartphones. Because the latter is cheaper, they may pave the way to a mass market for VR.\n\nSOURCE: SUPERDATA RESEARCH, NOV 2016\n\nTip Sheet\n\nWhat: Variety Entertainment Summit at CES\n\nWhere: Aria, Bristlecone 10\n\nWhen: Jan. 6, 1 p.m.-5:30 p.m.\n\nVariety is back at CES with its popular Entertainment Summit on Jan. 6 at the Aria hotel in Las Vegas.
