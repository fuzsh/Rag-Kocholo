        "text": "Consultancy firm GaymerX, which operates similar to Sweet Baby Inc., consulted with Pokémon GO developer Niantic ahead of the company’s radical gender and avatar changes to the game.\n\nAs reported by former World of Warcraft Team Lead Mark Kern, GaymerX notes on their website they have consulted with Niantic, Volition, and Behaviour Interactive. And like Sweet Baby Inc. the company claims it “is proud to offer consulting and training services to the games industry. As part of our mission to support and celebrate LGBTQIA+ people and culture in games, we offer a selection of LGBTQIA+ centered training curricula as well as customized solutions designed to advance Diversity, Equity, Visibility, and Inclusion in gaming.”\n\nThe company adds, ” We serve individuals and businesses working in the video game and tabletop gaming industries, including independent game developers, game studios of all sizes, publishers, media outlets, and more.”\n\nREAD: ‘Pokémon GO’ Players Demand Niantic Reverse Newly Rolled Out Avatar Changes: “Why Y’all Make Everybody Ugly”\n\nSpecifically the company notes, “GaymerX will help you create more LGBTQIA+ inclusive games, workplaces, and events. We provide a wide variety of services utilizing our in-house experts and network of consultants with diverse and intersectional identities.”\n\nIt then lists off a number of services that it provides including sensitivity training, marketing, as well as multiple workshops that promote gender identity in the workplace and community management strategies for supporting LGBTQIA+ players.\n\nGiven Niantic is one of GaymerX’s clients, Kern questioned, “What’s behind the Pokemon GO gender erasure? Turns out the makers of Pokemon Go! consulted with a Sweet Baby Inc style consultancy firm, GaymerX! Did this lead to the changes? These firms need to go!”\n\nREAD: The Pokémon Company Doubles Down On Wokeness With Job Listing For Director Of Diversity, Equity, Inclusion & Social Responsibility\n\nKern previously reported that Niantic’s new avatar update for Pokémon GO completely removes sexed bodies.\n\nHe wrote on X, “The Pokémon GO App removed gender from all Pokemon Go! players yesterday in a sweeping change that left fans at Pokemon Go Hub Net furious. I took a look at the character creator myself.\n\n“Gender is GONE, replaced by a hodgepodge of androgynous options. Nothing can be too feminine or too male. Facial hair options gone,” he asserted. “Male faces had softened features. Female faces had masculine jaws or thin lips. Bodies are blobs. Everything is designed to blend together in some Frankenstein like gender-free utopia. The end result leaving no one satisfied.”\n\nIn another post, he explained, “Character creators in AAA games went from Male/Female to Body Type A and Body Type B. The next step, from AAA Studios I spoke with, says even body types are being erased in upcoming games. Instead you will be presented with a random mix of male and female parts, bodies, heads and faces. Pokemon Go! already did this yesterday. This is the future of AAA games.”\n\nIn response to one user claiming he would be fine with the changes if he could still create “an aesthetically pleasing character,” Kern replied, “The neat thing is, you can’t! You can’t create masculine or feminine. Everything is blended.”\n\nREAD: Elon Musk Describes Sweet Baby Inc. As “An Evil Blight On The Gaming Industry” After Employee Attempts To Cancel Asmongold\n\nAn alleged industry insider informed Sausage Roll back in 2020 that female characters were being made to look more like men in order to promote transgenderism. The insider stated, “It’s not really about the sexual objectification of women. Women, like men, come in all shapes and sizes; to say that having big busty women is unrealistic is untrue.”\n\nThis insider then added, “This is only true for trans people. A trans woman can’t naturally grow large breasts, and not all trans people can afford implants. If you see a game where the women are a little less curvy, it’s not to because the game designers are worried about receiving backlash for sexualising women, it’s because they are worried about offending the trans community.”\n\nHe then revealed, “From a design stand point, this is a really challenging problem. I’ve had many board meetings about how to tackle this. Trans people want ‘realistic’ representation in our games, but they feel excluded if they are represented as too masculine or too feminine. That’s why you will see a lot of designers ‘nerfing the female form’ so to speak so that the difference between trans women and cis women is a little less noticeable.”\n\nThis information was backed up by YouTuber Yellowflash who stated, “I was told it was done to be ambiguous, to make everybody feel okay and included. … They’re purposely trying to walk a line here so that they don’t offend queer people. That’s what I was told. Now, take that with a grain of salt.”\n\nREAD: Melonie Mac Calls Out ‘Pokémon GO’ For Pushing Transgender Ideology With New Female Character Designs\n\nYouTuber Melonie Mac also asserted the changes made by Niantic, which were being tested back in March, were done for the “trans gaze.”\n\nShe wrote on X, “None of this is about women, it’s the trans gaze. This update isn’t a relatable female frame. It’s straight up transgender.”\n\nREAD: Comedian Katt Williams Says Transgender Propaganda From Hollywood Comes At The Behest Of The Demon Baphomet\n\nTransgender ideology is not only evil, but extremely dangerous. Comedian Katt Williams revealed to Joe Rogan that the transgender propaganda pumped out by Hollywood and these video games studios is done at the behest of the demon Baphomet.\n\nWilliams said, “So 20 years ago I knew that transgenders was going to be a thing. It wasn’t because I was a prophet, it’s just I had gotten so much information that I understood that things are [cyclical] so I understood that the earliest I had seen that word transgender was Baphomet the transgender.”\n\n“So I knew that in the ritual of Baphomet, the transgender, to show allegiance to him you had to kiss his a** ring and it said both of those things. So I knew both of those things would become popular in the future. And that somehow calling people the goat would be normalized over the sheep being always the most popular reference,” he said.\n\nArchbishop Sample of the Archdiocese of Portland told Catholic Answers back in June 2022, “Personally, I think so many of the attacks on marriage and family life that we see in the culture today are the result of this sort of frontal attack the enemy has launched on marriage.”\n\nHe continued, “So, just the failure rate of marriages, today, the break down in marriage and family life, the efforts to even redefine what marriage is, these are all attacks of the enemy.”\n\nSpecifically discussing transgender ideology, Archbishop Sample said, “God did create, as I just said, and Genesis tells us, God created the first man and woman in his image and likeness. He created them male and female. He created them.”\n\n“And we are in the image of likeness of God. So the enemy despises the image of God in us as God made us. And I quite honestly think a lot of this insanity with the gender ideology today is, again, another attack on the image of God in each one of us, individually in each one of us,” he continued. “And the idea that we can redefine ourselves, and even redesign ourselves rather than accept that we have come from the hand of the creative God is indicative of this.”\n\nREAD: The Verge Reporter Ash Parrish Admits To Excluding Sweet Baby Inc.’s Cancellation Campaign In Order To Push Woke Narrative\n\nArchbishop Sample then shared a conversation he had with Pope Francis, “He said, ‘This is a direct assault on God Himself. It’s the ultimate rejection of God. That we don’t need God, we don’t need to accept God, we don’t need to accept our individuality, we don’t need to accept how God has made us. We just cast God aside and I will define myself.’”\n\nHe later added, “This ideology that’s in the culture today, now, that there’s no such thing as a binary gender, there’s multiple genders that we can define, nobody’s one or the other, we’re just in this gender fluidity. So that young people growing up are indoctrinated into this ideology. And this is what Pope Francis goes off after. It’s a terrible thing what’s happening.”\n\nIn his A Catholic Response to Gender Identity Theory, Archbishop Sample explained how the ideology is so dangerous, “To some, supporting aspects of social transition may seem benign, even humane, such as using someone’s preferred pronouns and actively affirming his or her perceived gender. However, while well-intentioned, this kind of endorsement may help shepherd a young person on a path of unnecessary medicalization.”\n\nHis Excellency continues, “Social transition is often the first step towards hormones and surgery. A 2020 survey of transgender and nonbinary youth found that 64% of respondents were either already receiving cross-sex hormones or desired to do so. Danish researchers who first used puberty blockers on gender dysphoric children found that social transition increased the likelihood that dysphoria would persist and result in medicalization.”\n\n“Social transition can also include practices such as breast-binding and genital tucking, both of which have been shown to have averse effects on physical health, like testicular torsion and reduced fertility in males, and abnormal lung function and back pain in females,” he notes. “Moreover, a 2020 study on the effects of social transition found that family and peer relations, but not social transition status, predicted psychological functioning.”\n\nWhat do you make of the fact that GaymerX consulted with Niantic and now the company has rolled out these changes that promote transgender ideology?"
