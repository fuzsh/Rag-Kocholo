This transmedia phenomenon has led to the burgeoning of transmedia studies in media, cultural studies, and communication departments across the academy. The Routledge Companion to Transmedia Studies is the ultimate volume for scholars and students interested in comprehending all the various aspects of transmediality. This collection, which gathers together original articles by a global roster of contributors from a variety of disciplines, sets out to contextualize, problematize, and scrutinize the current status and future directions of transmediality, exploring the industries, arts, practices, cultures, and methodologies of studying convergent media across multiple platforms.

Children had been playacting stories, creating their own costumes and props, for hundreds of years, probably longer. There had been movie tie-in products as long as there has been mass media. But the apparatus of the modern movie franchise was still taking shape and transmedia was not yet a concept that could be applied to what was happening. Action figures embody some of these shifts—a film franchise like Star Wars may release dozens, perhaps hundreds, of action figures over time, which not only represent core characters from the narrative but expand beyond the narrative to flesh out the fictional world (Gray 2010). The best contemporary action figures have costumes that often evoke particular scenes, they have props which suggest their relationship with other elements in the fictional worlds, they have capacities for action which tell us something about how they interact with the other characters (Jenkins 2017a). Action figures are authoring tools which encourage fans to dig deep into the mythology and then go beyond it. Contemporary action figures are bound up with the logic of the transmedia system. Rather than action figures, we had Soakies, a particular brand of bubble bath soap which licensed the likenesses of various media characters (from Hanna Barbera to Disney, from DC to Warner Brothers); we used the plastic containers as toys afterward to create our own stories. We lacked enough characters to flesh out any given fictional world so most of those stories involved crossovers. We had Colorforms—reusable vinyl stickers that could be stuck onto a fixed backdrop and used to stage character interactions. We had Viewmaster slides and board games and stuffed toys. And comic books deployed many of these same characters, but with little or no regard to the source material’s narrative continuity. So, yes, fictions moved across media but the focus was overwhelmingly on characters and rarely—if at all—about extending the narratives or expanding the worlds. We might say that the characters had amnesia since they did not seem to recall where they had been or what they had done before. There are cases, such as Carl Bark’s Duckberg comics, where these other media constructed worlds that were richer than could be found on screen but such examples were few and far between. For the most part, these spin-offs told fans little that they did not already know from the film or television series. Of course, serialization within television was still rare—Zorro comes to mind—with most shows following more episodic structures. And film franchises—Planet of the Apes being the exception— were also not yet common. As I grew older, I did find opportunities to consume works that extended the 30\n\nplotlines, revisited dramatic turning points, developed the subjectivity of secondary characters, deepened our understanding of fictional worlds, imagined characters that crossed over from one fictional world to another, and even explore multiple and contradictory interpretations of established stories. All of these were functions performed by fan fiction (see my discussion of different ways to rewrite a television series in Textual Poachers: Television Fans and Participatory Culture, Jenkins 1992). Fans understood television programs as serials even when the rest of the world saw them as episodic and their stories often represented extensions that expanded the timeline, explored secondary characters, or explored the fictional world. When I started to encounter works that meet a more contemporary understanding of transmedia storytelling, I read them as professional fan fiction—a term that gets applied with derision by some cultural critics, but I saw it as a compliment, since it implied that the writers of these secondary texts had a much deeper engagement with the storyworld than we had seen before. By the time I became a parent in the early 1980s, more and more media properties —especially for children—were organized into franchises, many of which involved a play with intertextuality, a pattern which Justin Wyatt discussed in High Concept (1994) in terms of “the book, the look, and the hook,” Marsha Kinder wrote about in Playing with Power (1991) as transmedia, and Roberta Pearson and William Uricchio (1991) or Tony Bennett and Marsha Woollacott (1987) explored in terms of the trajectories of popular heroes. All of these are pieces that I taught my students, that shaped how I thought about the media my son consumed, that informed how I and many others read new developments in popular entertainment. By 1999, there was more and more discussion of a shift in the ways that stories were being told, a shift marked by a cover story of Entertainment Weekly that defined 1999 as the “year that changed the movies” (Gordimer 1999). The shift in question indicated the level of innovation and experimentation taking place in genre films (The Matrix, The Blair Witch Project, The Sixth Sense), independent films (Magnolia), and art films (Run Lola Run). Jeff Gordimer began: You can stop waiting for the future of movies. It’s already here. Someday, 1999 will be etched on a microchip as the first real year of 21st-century filmmaking. The year when all the old, boring rules about cinema started to crumble. The year when a new generation of directors—weaned on cyberspace and Cops, Pac-Man and Public Enemy—snatched the flickering torch from the aging rebels of the 1970s. The year when the whole concept of “making a movie” got turned on its head. (Gordimer 1999) Some of it was hype, yet many of the films and filmmakers Gordimer identified are still central to the discussion two decades later. Critics explored what films were learning from computer and video games, embracing nonlinear or multi-perspectival 31\n\nstructures. Meanwhile, television narratives were growing ever-more complex, as Jason Mittell (2015) has noted, with more and more integration of storylines across episodes or development of ensemble casts of characters. But, something more was taking place, something many of us recognized but did not yet have the words to describe. Janet Murray (1997) talked about the encyclopaedic dimensions of digital narratives, Will Brooker (2001) discussed narrative “overflow,” Mimi Ito (2005) discussed the “hypersocial” dimensions of Japanese “media mix,” Frank Rose (2008) spoke about “The Art of Immersion,” P. David Marshall (2002) described “intertextual commodities,” and I expanded Kinder’s term, “transmedia,” to describe an emerging model where narratives and fictional worlds, not just characters, were extending across media platforms. By the time we started to write about transmedia storytelling, we were already soaking in it—not unlike the bubble bath from my old Soakies. We were playing catch up, responding to experiments taking place in various corners of the media industries—my chapter in Convergence Culture (Jenkins 2006) focused on The Matrix franchise, but sidebars suggested some other parallel examples such as Haxan’s promotion of The Blair Witch Project, transnational projects as American comics publishers responded to the growing popularity of manga, the Dawson’s Desktop project promoting the CW’s Dawson’s Creek, and “The Beast,” an alternate reality game linked to the release of the film A.I.: Artificial Intelligence. Here, juxtaposition of cases via sidebars substituted for an effort to develop a more coherent picture of the boundaries of transmedia storytelling. By this point, I had spent the past decade expanding my access to various mediamakers. I had consulted with Brenda Laurel (2001) when she was launching Purple Moon games and a section of her book, Utopian Entrepreneur, reflected her engagement with ideas from Marsha Kinder that I had introduced to her and her staff. I had run a Creative Leaders Program for Electronic Arts which brought me into contact with Neil Young, Will Wright, Danny Bilson, Bing Gordon, and others who were thinking about the ways that games might forge new relationships with Hollywood franchises. I drafted my first explanation of transmedia flying back from an intense meeting in Los Angeles between top games and film industry people. There were already people out there—Jeff Gomez, Mike Monello, Jay Bushman, Sean Stewart, Maureen McHugh, among them—who were trying to develop new models for richer storyworlds and cross-media extensions. McLuhan tells us that media are put out before they are thought out and a lot of people were putting out by the turn of the millennium. While I might never have anticipated the degree to which people across the media industries would embrace Convergence Culture, I wrote my chapter on transmedia storytelling with a strong awareness that I was entering a conversation which would challenge industry, fans, and academia to rethink how they engaged with contemporary entertainment. I refused to read these developments as purely motivated by commercial instincts, having a front-line perspective on the ways that these storytellers talked about the aesthetic potentials of an expanded canvas. Little did I know that transmedia storytelling would be a flag that people would 32\n\nrally behind. Convergence Culture came out in the midst of the Hollywood writers’ strike, which centered around how writers would be compensated for digital content that often extended television series: they saw it as part of the storytelling process and the studios saw it as promotion. Transmedia helped them make a case for the value of their contributions. I have since been told stories that people were passing copies up and down the picket lines and as people went off strike, transmedia production started to become more widespread as language for describing what was going on with Lost, Heroes, and other contemporary television programs. We heard less about 360-degree promotion, the word being pushed by the studios and the networks. Elsewhere, transmedia became language that was taken up by policy-makers, arts funding agencies, and government film bureaus as a way of justifying support for all kinds of digital content. From the start, then, our understanding of transmedia storytelling emerged at the intersection between theory and practice and through exchanges between academics and media-makers. Such exchanges often took place on the margins, through informal channels—face-to-face exchanges at conferences and local meet-ups, podcast interviews, blog posts, even exchanges on social media (such as Brian Clark’s “East Coast-West Coast Distinction”). Even understood in academic terms, it was a space where contributions by graduate students (Geoffrey Long, Ivan Askwith, Christy Dena, Sam Ford, Jeff Watson, among others) were as important as those of more established scholars. Production handbooks exist on our syllabi at the University of Southern California alongside theoretical tomes; our classes often ask students to combine thinking and making. It was an exchange that has become increasingly transnational (taking different shapes depending on whether the media ecology is shaped by commercial or public service logics). As the term has traveled, the concept of transmedia has expanded from an early focus on popular genres to more diverse media (publishing, music, location-based experiences), from entertainment to documentary and journalism, activism and mobilization, education, religion, diplomacy, sports, and branding (Jenkins 2017b). Each step along the way, we have had to both expand and sharpen our understanding of what we mean by transmedia, as critics and theorists raced to keep up with innovative new practices that often defy any simple, rigid or static definition. To me, transmedia was about a set of relationships across media, not a single model for how different media might “collide.” We need lots of different models for the forms that transmedia might take as different creative teams pursue different functions in relation to different stories for different audiences in different national contexts. When my students ask me whether something is or is not transmedia, I usually ask them in what ways it may be useful to read it as transmedia. So, there may be some circumstances where it makes sense to read fan fiction as part of a larger transmedia system while other times, it is important to maintain clear distinctions between canon and fanon, between continuity and multiplicity. I am often surprised when I and others get accused of ignoring the larger history of 33\n\ntransmedia practices in our early writing: my chapter in Convergence Culture draws multiple comparisons with earlier media practices. We were preoccupied with trying to figure out what was new about contemporary transmedia stories and with searching for antecedents. But the introduction of a new media ecology shifts how we understood what came before, and in this case, the availability of the concept of transmedia storytelling has sharpened our understanding of earlier media ecologies, changing how we read The Wizard of Oz, Walt Disney, Superman, or the Lone Ranger, to cite a few examples. All of this brings us to the volume you currently hold in your hands. The editors have assembled an international rogue’s gallery of some of the world’s top thinkers about transmedia. I love that attempts to develop a field theory of transmedia have given way to efforts to describe different configurations transmedia might take in different contexts or in the service of different goals. We have examples here from many different national media ecologies. The book explores the value of different theoretical traditions for analyzing examples of transmedia practices, further expanding the conceptual tools with which we conduct our discussions. I welcome the shift from discussing interactivity toward more nuanced consideration of participatory practices, bringing fandom studies more fully into the mix. I am excited to see some productive tensions here between perspectives that are grounded in claims of medium specificity (whether in terms of different media sectors or the contributions different media affordances offer). And it is wonderful to see such rich discussions of transmedia’s contributions beyond the realm of entertainment. These are just a few of the strengths of the current collection, which amply demonstrates the value of an expansive definition of transmedia, as we seek to continually make sense of a period of profound and prolonged media change.\n\nReferences Bennett, Tony, and Janet Woollacott. 1987.

The process of devising, compiling, and editing this volume has allowed us to re-understand what “transmedia” really is, what its overarching and underpinning characteristics are, how it works, where it works, and—perhaps most importantly of all—why we need it. Our hope is that the broad and expansive scope of this book allows for at least some of the deepest meanings and the fullest potentials of transmediality to be imagined, and for that we wholeheartedly thank each and every one of our contributors for their excellent and focused chapters. And an even bigger thank you must go to Henry Jenkins, whose generous support of this project—as is documented in his insightful foreword—is enormously valued.\n\n36\n\nIntroduction Transmedia Studies—Where Now? Matthew Freeman and Renira Rampazzo Gambarato\n\nLet’s start with a question: what is transmedia? Here, we mean this question not as a lead-in to presenting any kind of rudimentary, oft-cited definition, but rather as a genuine question. The transmedia phenomenon has led to the burgeoning of transmedia studies across media, film, television, cultural, and communication studies across the academy, not to mention the wider creative and cultural industries. The Routledge Companion to Transmedia Studies seeks to be the ultimate publication for scholars and students interested in comprehending all of the various aspects of transmediality, be it in terms of media industries and their platforms, digital and mobile communications, advertising and marketing sectors, audience behaviors and cultural practices, or socio-political forms like media activism, identity, literacy, and education. This collection, which gathers together original articles by a global roster of contributors from a variety of disciplines and industry backgrounds, sets out to contextualize, problematize, and scrutinize the current status and future directions of transmediality, exploring the industries, practices, cultures, arts, and methodologies of studying convergent media content across multiple media platforms. Now is the time to offer this ultimate publication about transmedia studies, given the central yet multifaceted ways in which transmediality has come to materialize in the media landscape. Marsha Kinder (1991) first used the term “transmedia” to describe the multiplatform and multi-modal expansion of media content. Henry Jenkins (2006) reintroduced the term within the context of digital change and “transmedia storytelling” has subsequently seen widespread adoption and interrogation. Jenkins’ (2007) definition of transmedia storytelling as “a process where integral elements of a fiction get dispersed systematically across multiple channels for the purpose of creating a unified and coordinated entertainment experience” has become one of the dominant ways by which the flow of entertainment across media is now understood, especially in a digital and commercial setting where the correlation between transmedia storytelling and the commerce of entertainment has been reinforced in industry. As Heroes creator Tim Kring once asserted, transmedia storytelling is “rather like building your Transformer and putting little rocket ships on the side” (Kushner 2008). By providing audiences with more and more content, it seems, transmediality— an umbrella term most fundamentally describing “the increasingly popular industrial practice of using multiple media technologies to present information … through a 37\n\nrange of textual forms” (Evans 2011, 1)—is characteristically understood as a commercial practice, enabling as it does for multiple revenue streams and numerous sites of engagement. Marie-Laure Ryan puts it plainly in her assertion that transmedia storytelling is essentially “a way to get us to consume as many products as possible” (2013, 384). But commercial transmedia storytelling is not the end of the story for transmediality. In fact, Jenkins’ description of transmedia storytelling (of a single narrative that is only truly complete when elements from multiple media forms are brought together into a coherent whole) has arguably rarely materialized in quite the fully integrated, plot-intertwining fashion that Jenkins envisaged. Further, as a mode of practice, transmedia storytelling is still most closely associated with what Benjamin Birkinbine, Rodrigo Gómez, and Janet Wasko refer to as the global media giants —“the huge media conglomerates such as Disney and Time-Warner, [which] take advantage of globalization to expand abroad and diversify” (2017, 15). Outside of the conglomerates, though, transmediality has evolved in other ways, namely into a brand development practice or as a way to support traditional media content through transmedia franchising systems (Johnson 2013), to name its other dominant commercial purposes. But transmediality has equally gained wider relevance as digital screen technologies have multiplied, with the so-called “old media” of film and television now experienced through online transmedia distribution practices (Evans 2015), whereby content becomes integrated with social media and other online platforms. Other terms such as “multiplatform” (Jeffery-Poulter 2003), “crossmedia” (Bechmann Petersen 2006), and “second screening” have joined it (Holt and Sanson 2014), but transmediality remains an important concept for understanding the fundamental shifts that digital media technologies have wrought on the media industries and their audiences. More than this, transmediality has since grown into a distinct subfield of scholarly investigation, one that relates to a range of studies across film, television, social media, gaming, marketing, literature, music, journalism, and beyond. However, the more that transmediality has broadened its definition and its practical use in recent years, the more that it has arguably become something else entirely. Let’s not forget that research has defined transmediality through very different disciplinary lenses, be it in terms of storytelling (Jenkins 2006; Evans 2011; Ryan 2013), marketing (Gray 2010; Grainge and Johnson 2015), journalism (Gambarato and Alzamora 2018), world-building (Wolf 2012); historical culture (Freeman 2016), activism (Scolari, Bertetti, and Freeman 2014), literacy (Scolari 2016), and so on. And these different sets of creative and disciplinary lenses should not be underplayed in our understanding of what transmediality is. Mapping the many faces of transmediality is an important task for researchers, for it hints at its multifaceted formations, functions, values, and roles across the wider media landscape. And yet an almost inevitable consequence of transmediality being approached via so many different disciplinary lenses is that the very definition of transmediality might 38\n\nremain decidedly in flux, meaning different things to different people at different times. In 2011, Brian Clark argued that the potential for transmediality to be (mis)understood as almost everything means that “transmedia,” as term, has possibly outlived its usefulness, insisting that only by refining the definition will scholars secure its long-term viability. Clark, we believe, was absolutely right in his critique, and simply because we live in “a digital media environment … [that] calls for a spread of media” (Brinker 2017, 209), it does not mean that everything is transmedial. Revising, refining, and clarifying our understanding of what does—and therefore what does not—constitute a form of “transmedia” is indeed crucial, both to the future of this avenue of study but more importantly to our collective abilities to make sense of how, why, and when media content flows, expands, and moves across multiple media platforms in particular ways, for particular reasons, and with particular effects. However, we posit that only by embracing the multiplicities and pluralities of transmediality as a cross-disciplinary phenomenon can one fully grasp its prominence. To paraphrase Christy Dena’s point from her chapter in this book, it may well make sense to create a simple definition of transmediality so that people understand and recognize it, but doing so is often at the cost of understanding the complete picture. A diverse and ultimate volume interrogating the status, the breadth, the developments, the themes, and the futures of transmediality is thus a timely opportunity for transmedia scholars to reflect on this subfield’s current status and to explore potential new directions for future research. Importantly, each contributor in this book has conducted leading research into a particular area of transmedia studies or has done widespread transmedia practice across the cultural industries. Together, our contributors thereby offer a unique perspective on the practices, cultures, arts, and methodologies of studying media across multiple platforms. Still, this cross-disciplinary approach based on embracing multiplicities and pluralities raises another notable question. If transmediality indeed means different things, in different parts of the globe (see Freeman and Proctor 2018), to different sets of industries, cultures, arts, and disciplines, then how can one go about classifying such different interpretations and divergent industrial practices as the same phenomenon? Doing this successfully—and responsibly—almost means reunderstanding transmediality, moving far beyond a set of narrow, discipline-specific definitions based on entertainment or storytelling or marketing alone. In effect, it means articulating a more overarching idea of transmediality, albeit one that still addresses the specificity of its workings in different contexts. As Henry Jenkins insists, “this does not mean that transmedia means everything to all people and thus means nothing to anyone. Rather, it means that we need to be precise about what forms of transmedia we are discussing and what claims we are making about them” (2016). This is where the breadth of this book comes in, and it is our embracing of the multiplicities and pluralities of transmediality that also drives the structure of this book. Looking across specific contexts of different industries, cultures, arts, practices, and methodologies of transmediality in turn, we will now use the remainder of this 39\n\nintroductory chapter to outline our overarching conceptual interpretation of what transmediality really means, argued in dialogue with the themes and ideas of the subsequent chapters. From there, we also speculate where transmedia studies could go next. And so now we return to our original question, meant with a sense of genuine reflection: what is transmedia?\n\nIndustries of Transmediality In her chapter on transmedia television, Elizabeth Evans claims that “these [digital] platforms, and the way they are being utilized by content creators and owners, are contributing to media culture becoming increasingly and inherently transmedial.” Similarly, Carlos A. Scolari argues elsewhere that, as of 2017, we are part of a media landscape where almost all content can in some way, shape or form be considered transmedial, meaning that “soon we will assume that all communication industries will be transmedial—it will be integrated into the DNA of media communication” (2017). Somewhat echoing the earlier sentiments of Clark, then, for Scolari (2017), the prevalence of transmedia across the contemporary media industries means that we no longer need to distinguish transmedia communication from other forms of communication. But transmedia’s prevalence is highly questionable and complex, and it is not particularly accurate to assume that transmediality exists across all creative and cultural industries. Indeed, as digital technologies and mobile devices continue to bring media interfaces into the workings of our daily lives, a salient question to consider is not only what is transmedia, but also where is transmedia? Jenkins’ more recent writings on transmediality have begun to consider ideas of transmedia location, meaning “the context from which transmedia products emerge” (Jenkins 2016). There is thus a question in terms of which industries transmediality is now an active part of, and what specific purposes it holds within and across them. The first section of the book comprises 13 chapters around those industries that we believe represent the most dominant transmedia industries today: Film, Documentary, Television, Telenovelas, Comics, Publishing, Games, Music, Journalism, Sports, Social Platforms, Celebrity, and Attractions. In terms of a focus on industries as a lens through which to better understand what transmediality really is, then, it is evident from this section’s configuration of chapters that transmedia industries necessarily embrace both fictional and non-fictional universes. Renira Rampazzo Gambarato’s chapter on transmedia journalism usefully reiterates the importance of characterizing transmediality as, first, multiple media platforms, second, as content expansion, and third, as audience engagement. The transmedia DNA of these characteristics is intertwined with fictional entertainment, as emphasized in Kinder’s (1991) and Jenkins’ (2003, 2006) original research, as much and as well as it is with non-fiction initiatives, as clearly demonstrated by Freeman’s (2016) historicized approach to transmedia studies previously. Transmedia 40\n\nphenomena, as a common ground, involve the richness of multiplatform media—it is, as Jenkins notes in his foreword, about a set of relationships across media. Particular media platforms can emerge and disappear, can be in vogue or be ostracized, can change and evolve. Nevertheless, we could not have transmedia dynamics without the support of multiple media platforms and the industries that align them together. Furthermore, this section posits that beyond the digital domain, transmediality can and should involve a variety of alternative combinations between both online and offline platforms. The Internet and all digital technologies unequivocally play a crucial role in (1) disseminating transmedia content, (2) making content easily available worldwide, (3) reaching a diversified range of audiences, (4) enabling audience engagement, and (5) contributing to a participatory culture, for instance. But the possibilities to enrich the audience experience via offline activities, live events, and analogue initiatives, are immense because they can dramatically contribute to (1) the feeling of immersion, (2) the sense of belonging, and (3) the emotional response of audiences, as discussed in the afterword of this collection. These immersive emotions and behavioral practices are key to definitions of transmediality, as is demonstrated in Helen W. Kennedy’s chapter on transmedia games, which shows the fruitfulness of applying “play theory” to understandings of transmediality. Looking across industries as diverse as journalism and the celebrity scene, moreover, it is clear that such playable online or offline transmedia strategies can contribute to a growth of these industries, with the proliferation of content across media platforms building both new storyworlds and new job roles. Chapters on transmedia sports, by Ethan Tussey, and transmedia social platforms, by Portia Vann, Axel Bruns, and Stephen Harrington, for example, both reinforce the globalism associated with transmediality, and particularly the idea that transmediality is partly a tool for enhancing the democratization of media content everywhere. And yet part of the future conceptual breakthrough for transmedia scholars must be to better understand how said democratization of content gels with the innate commerce of many transmedia production motives, as is demonstrated by Šárka Gmiterková’s study of the transmedia Kardashian brand and by Matthew Freeman’s look at the Warner Bros. Studio Tour in London as a commercially oriented brand extension of the Harry Potter storyworld. With any example of transmediality, where is the line between expansion-as-commerce and expansion-as-democratization—and if or when does that contradictory line become in any way problematic? Transmediality, in fact, is perhaps best understood as a series of conceptual contradictions, as the chapters in Part I show. Sarah Atkinson, positioning “film [as] arguably the most dominant instantiation of the transmedia storytelling phenomenon,” sees a tension between “the franchise and campaign binary”—that is, between notions of content and promotion—while Joakim Karlsen hints at the importance of conceptualizing transmedia documentary as a blend of fiction and non-fiction, experience and participation, all combined into a single package. Karlsen’s chapter shows the power of transmediality to embody the full potential of participatory media, 41\n\nand yet also points out the innate contradictions that arise when one begins to conceive of non-fiction as something that is itself participatory. Echoing this emphasis on combined tensions, Paola Brembilla explores transmedia music as a set of narrativized and visualized forms of artwork, cross-marketing, and branding. For Brembilla, transmediality is a “streaming of content” afforded by “synergy networks”—a streaming that builds a greater experience for audiences. Importantly, seeing transmediality—most broadly defined—as a stream of content “allows us to account for its versatility and ability to serve several purposes,” thus altogether suggesting that transmediality works to give media content greater “cultural and economic value in the contemporary mediascape.” Conceiving of transmediality as a mode of diversification across the cultural industries makes sense, tying in with William Proctor’s assertion in"
