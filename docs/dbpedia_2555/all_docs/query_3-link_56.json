Regarding to the game Pokémon GO we would like to block this game and i have searched online about the ports it is using but i got no results. dose anyone know what ports it uses or URLs to block it\n\nThank you and have a great day all of you\n\nThis looks like it has the answers:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/4sc9pw/been_asked_to_block_pokemon_go_for_your/\n\nFor those who don’t want to click the link, apparently the address to block is pgorelease.nianticlabs.com . This should work if your aim is to prevent overloading your network with Pokemon Go traffic. Although as this is primarily a mobile game, if the aim is to stop people playing it during work time, there’s nothing stopping them from just switching over to mobile data instead of wifi.\n\nHope that helps.\n\nSomething to note - unless you’ve got thousands of employees hooked up to your WiFi, I wouldn’t worry about it from a data perspective. I’ve had it since it launched and it’s only used 60MB~ of data despite me playing for 3-4 hours a day.\n\nIf you’re worried about it from a productivity standpoint, then Gwendolyn is right - they can just switch to 4G and carry on.\n\nYou are both right and yes they can use 4G to use but i think this caused by the social media and news … i think the management is only taking caution.\n\nGwendolynRose Thank you so much it worked.\n\nIt sounds like, when you posted the question, you marked it as for discussion only. If you go to the top of the thread, there should be a “drop-down” arrow allowing you to select the option “Need Answer”\n\nClick that, then you should have the option to “Manage” and then assign the “Best Answer”\n\nActually, you should be able to correct it now. I took that screen shot from one of my threads that I marked as not needing an answer, so you should be able to do the same with this thread. Just scroll to the top of the thread, click the drop-down arrow in the top right of the page, and you should see the “Need Answer” option. You’ll need to make sure you scroll all the way to the top of the page, though. Those management options don’t appear if you’re further down the page.If it’s not working for you for some reason (you can’t get to the drop-down arrow or the “Need Answer” option doesn’t show up), you might need to get a Spiceworker or mod involved."
