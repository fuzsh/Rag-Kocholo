Niantic

Join the Niantic team!\r\n\r\nNiantic, Inc. spun out of Google in October 2015 in partnership with Nintendo and The Pokemon Company with a mission to delight our customers with innovative entertainment experiences which blend works of the imagination with the real world to enable our users to have fun while visiting new places, learning about the world around them, and meeting new friends. Our latest product, Pokemon GO, has been downloaded over 500 million times and is the fastest growing mobile app of all time. We have inspired our players to collectively walk more than 4.6 billion kilometers (halfway to Pluto!). Our first product, Ingress, has been downloaded more than 14M times and has attracted a fan-base of highly active users in more than 200 countries around the world. Our systems utilize high throughput real-team geospatial querying and indexing techniques to process more than 200M game actions per day as people interact with real and virtual objects in the physical world. Interesting opportunities exist in developing the hosted platform for these and future products and in developing innovative client-side 3D and AR technologies.\r\n\r\nNiantic offers competitive salaries, stock options, medical and dental coverage for you and your family, generous vacation and holiday pay. We have game nights, outdoor adventures, and most importantly super fun and smart people! And yes - we offer healthy free lunches too!\r\n\r\nWe have conveniently located offices in several great locations: San Francisco, Sunnyvale, Seattle, & Los Angeles.\r\n\r\nWe look forward to seeing your resume.
