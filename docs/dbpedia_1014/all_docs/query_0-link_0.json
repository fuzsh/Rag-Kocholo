        "text": "Russian TV news channel\n\nTelevision channel\n\nRussia-24 (Russian: Россия-24, romanized: Rossiya-24) is a state-owned Russian-language news channel from Russia. It covers major national and international events as well as focuses on domestic issues. It is owned by VGTRK.[1][2]\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nThe broadcast began January 1, 2007 in Russia, February 7 on the West Coast of the United States, May 19, 2008 in Serbia, and October 9, 2008 in Kyrgyzstan. VGTRK Crimea started broadcasting on March 10, 2014.\n\nThe editor-in-chief of the channel is Evgeny Bekasov (since 2012).\n\nThe channel ostensibly aims to give a broad and impartial [2] outline of life in all of Russia’s regions from its European exclave of Kaliningrad to Vladivostok in the Far East. The channel was named Vesti until 1 January 2010, when the public-owned VGTRK rebranded its channels.\n\nRussia-24 was banned in Ukraine, Moldova, the United Kingdom, and the European Union as a result of the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine.[3] The channel falsely claimed that the Bucha massacre was staged and suggested that footage of actors placing mannequins on a film set in St. Petersburg were Ukrainian soldiers using the mannequins to \"pass it off as a corpse\".[4]\n\nThe United Kingdom and Australia imposed sanctions upon Evgeniy Poddubny, one of the top war correspondents and propagandists of Russia-24.[5][6]\n\nLogo history\n\n[edit]\n\nFirst logo (as Vesti, 2006–2007)\n\nSecond logo (as Vesti, 2007–2009)\n\nТhird logo (2010–2011)\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
