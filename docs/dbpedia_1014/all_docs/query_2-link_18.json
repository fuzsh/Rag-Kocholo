        "text": "Yevgeny Prigozhin, the leader of Russian mercenary group Wagner, said he told his forces to immediately halt their advance on Moscow and return to their bases in Ukraine as fear gripped the country about a potential deadly power struggle.\n\n\"We are turning our columns around and going back to field camps,\" Prigozhin said in an audio post on Telegram on June 24, adding that he did not want to \"spill Russian blood.\"\n\nPrigozhin said his troops, which he claimed numbered 25,000, were just 200 kilometers (120 miles) from the Russian capital when he made the decision. He did not say whether he had spoken with the Kremlin or the Russian military before announcing the move.\n\nThe insurrection, which began a day earlier, heralded the most serious challenge to Putin’s leadership during his nearly 24 years at the top of Russia's power structure and comes at a critical time for the Kremlin's war effort in Ukraine.\n\nWATCH: Our reporters captured events in Voronezh and Rostov-on-Don amid an armed rebellion by the Wagner mercenary group that rocked Russia on June 24.\n\nEmbed share\n\nEmbed share\n\nThe code has been copied to your clipboard.\n\nwidth px height px\n\nThe URL has been copied to your clipboard\n\nNo media source currently available\n\n0:00 0:03:26 0:00\n\nIn a sign of the gravity of the situation, Putin was forced earlier in the day to address the nation, saying in televised remarks that he would do \"everything to protect the country\" and called for national unity as Russia \"engaged in its heaviest struggle for its future.\"\n\nThe Kremlin must contend with the insurrection amid Ukraine's counteroffensive, a crucial endeavor that may shape the course of the conflict, including further opening the spigot of lethal Western military aid.\n\nAs the uprising unfolded, Putin called the leaders of Belarus, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and Turkey to inform them of the situation. Meanwhile, U.S. President Joe Biden spoke with the leaders of France, Germany and the United Kingdom.\n\n'Personal Ambition'\n\nPrigozhin's forces swept into Rostov-on-Don in Russia's south in the early morning hours where it easily seized key infrastructure.\n\nPutin described the private Wagner mercenary group's occupation of the city as an \"armed mutiny\" and said that \"decisive action\" would be taken to stabilize the situation in southwestern Russia. The Russian military reportedly fired on the Wagner forces later in the day as they advanced along the highway toward Moscow.\n\nPutin said Prigozhin had \"betrayed\" his country out of \"personal ambition.\"\n\nPrigozhin responded promptly to Putin's allegations of betrayal, saying in an audio message on Telegram after the speech that the Russian president was \"deeply mistaken\" and that he and his forces \"are patriots of the motherland.\"\n\nIn his address to the nation, Putin vowed to punish all \"traitors\" involved in the Wagner action, which he said was a \"stab in the back\" in the face of what he characterized as a Western threat to Russian sovereignty.\n\nLive Briefing: Russia's Invasion Of Ukraine\n\nRFE/RL's Live Briefing gives you all of the latest developments on Russia's full-scale invasion, Kyiv's counteroffensive, Western military aid, global reaction, and the plight of civilians.

And our actions to defend the fatherland against such a threat will be harsh,\" Putin said. \"All those who deliberately stepped on the path of betrayal, who prepared an armed insurrection, who took the path of blackmail and terrorist methods, will suffer inevitable punishment, will answer both to the law and to our people.\"\n\nPutin added that \"the entire military, economic, and information machine of the West,\" which has backed Ukraine following Russia's unprovoked all-out invasion in February 2022, was \"effectively aimed against us.\"\n\nTop Russian officials and personalities, including former President Dmitry Medvedev, Russian Orthodox Church head Patriarch Kirill, and Russian State Duma head Vyacheslav Volodin, echoed Putin's call for Russian citizens to rally and for Wagner troops to halt the insurrection.\n\nChechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov, a close Putin ally who has headed the republic in Russia's North Caucasus region since 2007, said he was deploying Chechen troops to \"preserve Russia's unity and protect its statehood.\"\n\n'Interesting Idea'\n\nPrigozhin began his march toward Moscow on June 23 after accusing the Russian Defense Ministry of launching rocket attacks on the rear camps of his forces in Ukraine using artillery and attack helicopters that allegedly killed many of his men.\n\n\"Those who destroyed our lads, who destroyed the lives of many tens of thousands of Russian soldiers, will be punished. I ask that no one offer resistance,\" Prigozhin said following the alleged attack.\n\nThe Kremlin called the mercenary leader's accusation a lie while some analysts said video of the alleged attack looked like a false flag operation and suggested Priogzhin had long been planning to seize power.\n\nPrigozhin’s insurrection comes on the heels of months of intense public fighting with Russia’s military leadership over the war strategy in Ukraine and ammunition supplies.\n\nOver the spring, he repeatedly accused Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu and Chief of the General Staff Valery Gerasimov of intentionally holding back supplies of ammunition to his troops in Bakhmut, the site of the war's bloodiest battle.\n\nSemon Pegov, a pro-Russia military blogger, said in an interview with Prigozhin on April 29 that there was speculation the military was withholding ammunition from Wagner for fear the mercenary leader would use it to storm Moscow and take power.\n\nPrigozhin responded by saying it was an “interesting idea” but claimed he hadn’t considered it.\n\nHowever, just a month later, after his troops took Bakhmut in the first Russian victory of the war in about 10 months, Prigozhin toured several Russian regions, giving interviews to local media in what some experts said was a clear sign of his political ambition.\n\nMeanwhile, Putin appeared to be siding with the Russian Defense Ministry in its spat with Prigozhin, appearing alongside Shoigu in a sign of support. The Russian Defense Ministry soon moved to take direct control of Wagner in what some experts said was a Kremlin attempt to sideline Prigozhin.\n\nPrigozhin went on the offensive, saying Russia's all-out invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 was justified based on \"lies.\" He was clear to avoid criticizing Putin for the poorly planned attack that has resulted in more than 200,000 Russian casualties.\n\n\"The war was needed...so that Shoigu could become a marshal...so that he could get a second 'Hero' [of Russia] medal,\" Prigozhin said. \"The war wasn't needed to demilitarize or 'denazify' Ukraine,\" Prigozhin said, referring to Putin's oft-stated reasons for launching the war against Kyiv.\n\nThe Defense Ministry responded by saying that the statements \"do not correspond to reality,\" calling them a \"provocation.\"\n\nWagner’s march toward Moscow sent shivers through the Russian capital as police blocked roads leading to the city.\n\nMoscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin announced he was putting \"anti-terror measures\" into effect, including increased traffic checks and restrictions on large events.\n\nHe called on residents to refrain from traveling around the city and declared Monday a non-working day. The events triggering a surge in demand for overseas flights departing Moscow on the weekend.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said the events demonstrate \"Russia's weakness.\"\n\n\"The longer Russia keeps its troops and mercenaries on our land, the more chaos, pain, and problems it will have for itself later,\" Zelenskiy added in a Telegram message.\n\nMykhaylo Podolyak, a senior adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, described Prigozhin's actions as a \"counterterrorist\" operation that clearly exposed the simmering feud among Russia's leadership.\n\n\"The split between the elites is too obvious. Agreeing and pretending that everything is settled won't work,\" Podolyak wrote in a tweet on June 24. \"Someone must definitely lose: either Prigozhin...or the collective 'anti-Prigozhin.'\"\n\n\"Everything is just beginning in Russia,\" Podolyak added.\n\nWith reporting by RFE/RL's Russian Service, Current Time, AP, AFP, dpa, Reuters, Interfax, and TASS\n\nDuring his entire imprisonment in Russia, Andrei Pivovarov yearned for one thing: freedom.\n\n\"To be released. You always count the days, hours, months. The only [desire] is to break free. Any person, politically oriented or not, sitting in prison, wants to be free,\" Pivovarov told Current Time.\n\nPivovarov, 42, was part of the biggest prisoner exchange between the West and Russia since the Cold War.\n\nIn the exchange on August 1, Russia got back eight prisoners held in the West, including a member of its FSB security service convicted of murder in Germany, and 16 people were released from Russian and Belarusian jails. They included Pivovarov, dissidents Vladimir Kara-Murza and Ilya Yashin, and U.S. citizens Evan Gershkovich, Paul Whelan, and RFE/RL journalist Alsu Kurmasheva.\n\nPivovarov, the former executive director of the now-defunct pro-democracy Open Russia movement, was detained in May 2021 after being taken off a Warsaw-bound plane just before takeoff from St. Petersburg and sentenced to four years in prison in July 2022 on a charge of heading an \"undesirable organization.\"\n\nThe \"undesirable organization\" law, adopted in 2015, was part of a series of regulations pushed by the Kremlin that squeezed many nonprofit and nongovernmental organizations that received funding from foreign sources, mainly from Europe and the United States.\n\nAfter his trial in Krasnodar, the St. Petersburg native was convicted and sentenced in July 2022, when Russia's full-scale war and Russian President Vladimir Putin's intensified crackdown on dissent were in full swing.\n\nFrom January 2023, Pivovarov was held in isolation at Penal Colony No. 7 in Russia's Karelia region.\n\nSince his release and transfer to Germany, Pivovarov has given numerous interviews but is hoping to find time now to rest and spend time with his family.\n\n\"I would like to exhale. Plus, during all this time I was deprived of the opportunity to communicate with my son, so I would really like to meet him, spend time with him,\" Pivovarov told Current Time, adding he has no plans to abandon his \"political work.\"\n\nPivovarov admitted that voicing opposition to Putin's regime is easier from abroad but with possible drawbacks.\n\n\"When you are in Russia, any unification, any coordination is automatically a criminal offense. At the same time, having a platform abroad, where we are now, on the one hand, to be honest, diminishes the weight of our words, because it is easy to say something while sitting outside in the sun and knowing that no policeman is coming for you,\" Pivovarov explained. \"On the other hand, this allows us to say more than what people in Russia can afford.\"\n\nBreathing life into Russia's opposition, largely silenced by Putin's repression and infighting, will be a formidable task, admitted Pivovarov, saying the goal should be \"not to unite but to establish a dialogue, contact.\"\n\n\"Of course, there will still be disputes,\" he said.\n\nPivovarov was also asked about comments he made at a Bonn press conference on August 2, when he appeared to suggest that Western sanctions against Russia were unfairly impacting ordinary Russians, triggering some criticism, especially among Ukrainians.\n\n\"There was no phrase about the unfairness of sanctions. I don't remember all the words verbatim, but there was no phrase about the unfairness of sanctions. Sanctions are effective, and they work. I'm talking about, for example, a housewife -- a stupid example -- but it seems typical to me. And she has, let's say, a small child, and she cooks at home. So that she has the opportunity to buy at least some more or less normal products, so that her small everyday world becomes a little simpler,\" Pivovarov offered.\n\nPivovarov said Russian opponents of Putin shared common goals with Ukrainians.\n\n\"Our goals are the same. We want to work together to ensure that the war ends, that the regime in Russia changes, and that, ultimately, Putin ends up in the dock. This is our main goal,\" he said. \"We just look at this from the perspective of Russian society, and in this regard we can be more useful.\"\n\nRussia has imposed what it called anti-terror measures in Kursk, the site of a Ukrainian military incursion, and two nearby regions as well as Bryansk and Belgorod.\n\nThe announcement was made early on August 10 by the National Anti-Terrorism Committee. In a statement, it said the decision had been made by Aleksandr Bortnikov, head of the FSB intelligence service, in response to Ukraine's \"unprecedented attempt to destabilize the situation in a series of regions.\"\n\nThe committee said the measures included the possible evacuation of residents, limits on transport, beefed-up security around sensitive sites, and wire taps.\n\nRussian media reported on August 10 that more than 76,000 people have been evacuated from border areas in the Kursk region since Ukraine launched the surprise cross-border offensive on August 6. TASS quoted Artem Sharov, an official from the regional Emergencies Ministry, as saying that those evacuated \"have been temporarily relocated to safe places.\"\n\nDozens of temporary accommodation facilities have been set up in Kursk and other regions, Sharov told journalists, according to TASS.\n\nThe Russian Defense Ministry said on August 10 that fighting was continuing region and that the army has conducted air strikes against Ukrainian forces.\n\nLive Briefing: Russia's Invasion Of Ukraine\n\nRFE/RL's Live Briefing gives you all of the latest developments on Russia's full-scale invasion, Kyiv's counteroffensive, Western military aid, global reaction, and the plight of civilians.

In the video, which was posted on Ukrainian media, one of the soldiers says that Sudzha and the Gazprom facility is controlled by Ukrainian forces.\n\n\"The news is as follows. The city is controlled by the armed forces of Ukraine. The strategic object of Gazprom in Sudzha is controlled by the 99th Mechanized Battalion,\" the fighters say in the video, which could not be immediately verified.\n\nSudzha Mayor Vitaly Slashchev denied the claim in a comment to TASS but said an evacuation of the city was under way.\n\nA Ukrainian member of parliament who spoke with RFE/RL on August 9 said the Ukrainian military was \"advancing and making an impression on the enemy\" and inflicting damage on Russian forces in the Kursk region.\n\n\"And the most important thing is that they are advancing quite professionally,\" lawmaker Roman Kostenko said, adding that they had managed to surprise the enemy at a place where the Russian forces were the weakest.\n\nEarlier on August 9 the Ukrainian military said it had hit the airfield in Russia's southern Lipetsk region overnight, damaging guided-bomb stockpiles.\n\n\"Several sources of ignition were recorded, a large fire broke out and multiple detonations were observed,\" Kyiv's military said on the Telegram messaging app.\n\nIt said Russian Su-34, Su-35 and MiG-31 aircraft were based at the airfield.\n\nSatellite images made available to RFE/RL by Planet Labs show the consequences of Ukrainian strikes on the Lipetsk airfield. The unverified images show completely destroyed buildings and evidence of a large fire. Two craters -- possibly the result of missile or drone strikes -- are also visible.\n\nThe head of the UN's nuclear watchdog, Rafael Grossi, has urged Ukraine and Russia to show restraint in the fighting in the Kursk region, the site of one of Russia's largest nuclear power stations.\n\n\"At this juncture, I would like to appeal to all sides to exercise maximum restraint in order to avoid a nuclear accident with the potential for serious radiological consequences,\" Grossi said in a statement.\n\nRussia's diplomatic mission in Vienna, quoted by Russian news agencies, said it had told the International Agency for Atomic Energy (IAEA) that fragments had been found at the station, possibly from downed missiles, but there was no evidence of any direct attack on the facility.\n\nElsewhere, unconfirmed reports spoke of a Russian column having been destroyed in the Kursk region with many casualties. Video circulating on social media showed what appeared to be many burned-out military transport vehicles on the side of a road in or near the town of Rylsk.\n\nTwo ethnic Armenians in Kursk who spoke with RFE/RL's Armenian Service by phone said the Russian authorities had banned large gatherings and mass events in the region through August 11.\n\n\"It can be said that we are at war now,\" said one of the men, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.\n\nHe said Ukrainian troops had captured two towns that are 60 to 70 kilometers away from the city of Kursk in addition to the Gazprom facility.\n\nJailed Iranian Nobel Peace Prize winner Narges Mohammadi and other women inmates in Tehran's Evin prison were injured earlier this week in clashes that erupted after a spate of executions, Mohammadi’s family says.\n\nMohammadi’s husband, Taghi Rahmani, said Mohammadi suffered breathing problems and severe chest pain after being punched in the chest and was transferred to the prison's clinic.\n\nRahmani, who spoke by phone to RFE/RL from Paris, said several women came under attack by guards during the clashes on August 6. Mohammadi was hit in her chest, and her arm was bruised, he said.\n\nThe injured women were later taken to the prison clinic for treatment and were returned to their ward.\n\nRahmani said the news agency of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps claimed the clash was a riot, but he said it should be made clear that it was a protest in which the women in Evin prison chanted in the prison yard against the death penalty.\n\nHe added that he and the rest of Mohammadi’s family were worried about her health especially because she was hit in the chest. Mohammadi had surgery for blocked arteries in 2022.\n\nRahmani added that Mohammadi, who is renowned as a staunch advocate for the Women, Life, Freedom movement, cannot contact her sister in Iran and she hasn’t been allowed to contact her children for 2 1/2 years. She also has had no contact with her lawyer.\n\n\"These restrictions make all of us worried about her situation in that ward where other women are also facing difficult conditions,\" Rahmani told RFE/RL.\n\nBefore Rahmani spoke with RFE/RL, Mohammadi's family issued a statement about the clash on August 8. It said several women who stood in front of the security forces were severely beaten.\n\nIt said the women in Evin prison had been actively protesting against executions in Iran, and following the execution of Reza Rasaei, several prisoners gathered in the prison yard to voice their dissent, chanting slogans against the death penalty.\n\nOne woman suffered a nervous breakdown and passed out and another prisoner also fainted from the emotional strain, the statement said, adding that Mohammadi and several other prisoners protested against the locked doors that were preventing the critically ill inmates from being taken to the prison clinic.\n\nIranian authorities acknowledged a confrontation took place on August 6 but blamed Mohammadi for a \"provocation\" and denied any of the prisoners had been beaten.\n\nTwo prisoners \"had heart palpitations due to the stress,\" but medical examinations determined that their general condition \"is favorable,\" Iran's prison administration said in a statement, according to the Tasnim news agency.\n\nMohammadi, 52, has been campaigning for human rights in Iran for decades and has been in and out of prison for the last 20 years. She has been convicted five times since March 2021 and is currently serving a 12-year prison sentence for \"spreading propaganda\" against the Islamic republic.\n\nThe executions that took place this week drew outrage from rights groups. The Norway-based Iran Human Rights group said 29 people were executed at two prisons in the Tehran satellite city of Karaj on August 7 alone.\n\nRasaei, 34, was the 10th man executed by Iran in connection with the \"Women, Life, Freedom\" protests that erupted after the death of a woman in police custody. The Iranian judiciary said Rasaei was executed on August 6.\n\nWith reporting by AFP\n\nThe United States and Britain unveiled new sanctions against Belarus on August 9 to mark the fourth anniversary of the country's disputed presidential election that returned authoritarian ruler Alyaksandr Lukashenka to power.\n\nThe U.S. Treasury Department imposed sanctions on 19 people and 14 companies involved in supporting Russia’s full-scale war in Ukraine by producing resources used by the military, shipping goods to Russia, evading sanctions, and generating revenue for Belarusian oligarchs in Lukashenka’s inner circle.\n\nIt also took aim at Lukashenka’s “luxury airliner,” a Boeing-767-300 owned by the Belarusian government that the Treasury Department said he uses “professionally and for his personal leisure.”\n\nPaval Latushka, head of the People's Anti-Crisis Directorate, said the sanctions meant the plane is barred from maintenance by authorized Boeing service providers, and this will create problems if it tries to land at airports outside Belarus.\n\nBradley Smith, the Treasury Department’s acting undersecretary for terrorism and financial intelligence, said in a statement that the sanctions were in response to the regime's \"blatantly corrupt, destabilizing, and anti-democratic acts -- along with its continued support for Russia's illegal invasion of Ukraine.\"\n\nThe U.S. designations followed fresh sanctions announced earlier on August 9 by Britain against four individuals and three businesses \"in response to human rights violations and ongoing facilitation of Russia's illegal invasion in Ukraine.\"\n\nThe Foreign Office noted that it issued the sanctions on the anniversary of \"the deeply flawed 2020 presidential elections in Belarus.\" It also noted that the action was taken in coordination with international partners and took the total number of sanctions imposed by Britain against Belarus to more than 200.\n\nAll four people sanctioned by Britain are present or former commanding officers of Belarusian prisons. The businesses sanctioned are involved in the country's defense and military sector.\n\nThe European Union targeted Belarusian authorities involved in human rights abuses earlier this week, and Canada on August 9 also announced additional sanctions on the Lukashenka regime.\n\nThe U.S. Treasury Department said that since the 2020 election, Lukashenka’s actions “have eroded Belarusian civil society and enabled Lukashenka, his family, and his inner circle to enrich themselves at the expense of Belarus’s citizens and sovereignty.”\n\nIt said the regime continues to support Russia’s invasion of Ukraine by hosting Russian military bases and allowing Russian forces to use Belarus as a staging point for military operations, the department said.\n\nAmong the 14 entities designated by the U.S. is Laboratory of Additive Technologies, which the department said provides Russia with components for satellite communications systems and optical equipment.\n\nThree other entities -- AlYurTekh, Diskoms, MOT, Grosver Grup, and Tochnaya Mekhanika -- were hit with sanctions for supporting what Washington said was a sanctions-evasion network supported by Peleng JSC, one of Russia’s most important industrial partners. Peleng was designated by for U.S. sanctions in December 2021.\n\nAmong the other entities are Aviakompania Rada and UE RubiStar, which the Treasury Department said are two private Belarusian cargo airline companies that have provided support to Russian defense activities, including transporting Wagner Group personnel to and from Africa.\n\nThe sanctions freeze any U.S.-based assets owned or controlled by the individuals and organizations. They also block financial transactions with those designated and prohibit the contribution of funds, goods, and services to them.\n\nThe U.S. State Department also took steps to impose visa restrictions on 19 regime officials and their affiliates for their involvement in undermining democracy in Belarus, the Treasury Department said.\n\nRussia declared what it described as a \"federal-level\" emergency on August 9 in the Kursk region, the site of a four-day incursion by Ukrainian forces. The announcement came hours after a Ukrainian military strike on an airfield there.\n\nIn response to the incursion, the Russian Defense Ministry said on August 9 that it was transferring extra forces to the region, including Grad multiple-launch rocket systems, artillery, and tanks, Interfax reported.\n\nState-run media reported on troops and armor being redeployed to Kursk, including video of Russian military on the move, much of it reposted on social media.\n\nThe cross-border action in Russia's Kursk region has been described as the biggest attack on Russian soil since Russian President Vladimir Putin launched his country's unprovoked, full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.\n\nWATCH: Scenes of destruction in Russia's Kursk region continue to be shared online following a surprise cross-border incursion.

The reports gave no cause for the blaze.\n\nThose reports came hours after regional Governor Igor Artamonov said on social media that Lipetsk had hit by a massive drone attack. He later added that a local power installation had been damaged and six people had been wounded.\n\nArtamonov first urged residents to ignore calls on social media to evacuate, saying they were being “spread by the enemy in order to sow panic.” Hours later, he said a state of emergency had been declared in the Lipetsk district and that four outlying settlements of Lipetsk city had been ordered to evacuate.\n\nSatellite images made available to RFE/RL by Planet Labs show the consequences of Ukrainian strikes on the Lipetsk airfield.

People have been evacuated from these areas. We are inside Kursk. And there is always a risk of missile attacks here. This is how we live.\"\n\nHe said that there had been no evacuation from the city of Kursk yet, but noted that air-raid alerts were frequent, entertainment venues were closed, and public transportation had been disrupted by missile and drone strikes.\n\n\"Warplanes, missiles are flying overhead. Air-raid alerts are issued every half-hour. But we are kind of used to it, given what has been going on for the past year or two. No one takes cover because every half-hour missiles or drones strike,\" he added.\n\nSeparately, the governor of the Russian-held city of Sevastopol on Ukraine's occupied Crimea Peninsula, Mikhail Razvozhayev, said on Telegram that Russian forces destroyed three drones and three drone boats near the city.\n\nThe Russian Defense Ministry said a total of 75 Ukrainian drones were destroyed over Russia overnight, according to the RIA Novosti news agency, most of them over the Belgorod and Lipetsk regions.\n\nWith reporting by AFP and Reuters\n\nHuman Rights Watch (HRW) has expressed concerns about the pressure faced by stand-up comedians over their performances in Kazakhstan.\n\nIn its statement on August 8, HRW said \"the crackdown on freedom of expression, including prosecutions of comedians, should end.\"\n\nIn recent months, many stand-up comedians in the tightly controlled former Soviet republic complained about the situation following the jailing of two stand-up performers over their performances.\n\nOn July 26, stand-up comedian Aleksandr Merkul, who often tells jokes about the Central Asian nation's current government and Russian President Vladimir Putin, was sentenced to 10 days in jail on a charge of hooliganism.\n\nThe charge stemmed from his performance in a restaurant in Astana in June, where he said, \"Kazakhstan is new, poverty is old,\" presumably referring to \"Zhana Qazaqstan\" (New Kazakhstan), a slogan that is used regularly by President Qasym-Zhomart Toqaev.\n\nMerkul, 31, was charged with swearing during the performance, a video of which went viral on the Internet. Merkul pleaded guilty.\n\nEarlier in May, another Kazakh comedian, Nuraskhan Basqozhaev, was also sentenced to 15 days in jail on the same charge after he joked about the authorities' efforts to tackle floods in spring caused by an abrupt wave of warm weather that led to a massive snowmelt.\n\nThe HRW statement also said that imposing pressure on comedians appears to be part of a wider crackdown on free speech in Kazakhstan.\n\nNoted Kazakh journalist Duman Mukhammedkarim, who has been known for his articles criticizing the government, was sentenced to seven years in prison on August 2 on charges of \"financing extremist activities\" and \"participating in the activities of a banned extremist group.\" Mukhammedkarim and his supporters have rejected the charges as politically motivated.\n\n\"People in Kazakhstan should be able to express critical opinions and commentary, not least through satire, without fear of retribution. Freedom of expression is not absolute, but international human rights law sets clear boundaries on legitimate government measures to regulate it. Kazakhstan is acting well beyond those boundaries, and it is past time it starts respecting them,\" the HRW statement said.\n\nDUSHANBE -- Tajikistan's Prosecutor-General Yusuf Rahmon has confirmed recent reports by RFE/RL's Tajik Service about a series of arrests of noted public figures and politicians.\n\nRFE/RL reported earlier, citing its sources close to the Central Asian nation's law enforcement, that former Foreign Minister Hamrohkhon Zarifi, former parliament speaker Akbarshoh Iskandarov, Democratic Party of Tajikistan deputy chairman Ahmadshoh Komilzoda, and Social Democratic Party deputy chairman Shokirjon Hakimov had been arrested on unspecified charges.\n\nThe arrests came after the state-run Khovar news agency cited the Prosecutor-General's Office in June, saying that the lawmaker and ex-chairman of the Democratic Party of Tajikistan, Saidjafar Usmonzoda, was arrested on suspicion of plotting to forcibly seize power.\n\nYusuf Rahmon said at the time at a parliamentary session that Usmonzoda was suspected of collaborating with the National Alliance of Tajikistan -- a group uniting self-exiled opposition politicians and activists that had been banned in the tightly controlled former Soviet republic.\n\nYusuf Rahmon, who is an in-law of President Emomali Rahmon, said on August 9 that all the arrests are linked to the case against Usmonzoda, adding that those arrested had been charged with high treason.\n\nHe declined to elaborate further, saying that details of the investigation are classified.\n\nIt is not clear how the arrested men pleaded as neither their relatives nor lawyers have made any public statements.\n\nSources told RFE/RL that only two of those arrested, Akbarshoh Iskandarov and Shokirjon Hakimov, had managed to get private lawyers, while the others are represented by state-appointed attorneys. However, none of the lawyers has ever been able to meet with their clients, the sources said.\n\nThe Tajik government has brutally cracked down on dissent over the years, jailing opposition politicians or forcing them into self-exile. Dozens of independent journalists, activists, and government critics were sentenced to lengthy prison terms.\n\nPresident Rahmon, who has run Tajikistan for almost 30 years, has been criticized by international human rights groups over his regime's stifling of political pluralism, independent media, religious freedoms, and civil society.\n\nIn recent years, several Tajik journalists, rights activists, and opposition politicians have been handed lengthy prison terms on charges seen by rights groups as trumped-up and politically motivated.\n\nVeteran Russian human rights defender Oleg Orlov said he hasn’t adjusted to freedom yet after being released last week from a Russian jail in the largest prisoner exchange between Russia and Western countries since the Cold War ended.\n\nOrlov, one of Russia’s most experienced and respected human rights activists, told RFE/RL that he’s done interview after interview since his release on August 1 and arrival in Germany and has had no time for reflection.\n\n“I haven't felt like anywhere yet. Neither in emigration completely, nor in freedom,” he said. “I have spent all day talking, talking, talking, [but] of course just walking down the street is happiness.”\n\nOrlov was one of 16 people released in the historic exchange that also saw eight Russians returned to their homeland. He spoke with RFE/RL from Berlin, where he is now living in exile and getting used to a life that is completely different from anything he thought it would be.\n\nWhen he imagined his freedom, it was always somewhere in Russia, where he pictured himself visiting a lake or another favorite place in nature, picking mushrooms, or lying down at his dacha and looking at the sky.\n\n“That was my idea of freedom,” he said, still imaging that he will someday go to the lakes of Karelia, a region in northwestern Russia, where he will sit and watch the sunset.\n\nHe said that he and fellow inmate Aleksei Malerevsky, whom he identified as a political prisoner, had several conversations in the prison cell they shared about the prospect of a prisoner exchange. They knew about calls for a prisoner swap but were dubious it would ever happen.\n\n“Yes, that's why, of course, no one really believed in the exchange,” said Orlov, who was convicted in February of repeatedly discrediting the Russian military and sentenced to 30 months in prison, a ruling that was upheld in July.\n\nHe recounted his refusal to sign a petition requesting a pardon from Russian President Vladimir Putin that was presented to him shortly before his release, saying this was “internally traumatic” for him because he believed that by refusing to sign he closed the door definitively on ever being released.\n\nHe explained that when the prison official asked if he was sure he wouldn’t sign the pardon request, he said he was, and he believed this meant he would have to serve out his entire sentence.\n\nAsked what he missed while in prison, he said there was a “great lack of movement” and it was colorless except for gray and brown. He added that the food could be “so tasteless, monotonous, and sometimes, apparently, prepared with bad oil, that it caused an upset stomach.”\n\nHe said he had good relations with fellow inmates and considered that lucky. They were “very different people,” but he was able to find a common language with them and it was always possible to talk about something or play board games.\n\nWhile cruel and rude treatment occurred often, this was not deliberate cruelty aimed at the prisoners, he said. It was a traditional “practiced cruelty dictated by the system itself.”\n\nThe system is not aimed at humane treatment, much less correction, he said. It is a correctional system, but “there is no correction there.”"
