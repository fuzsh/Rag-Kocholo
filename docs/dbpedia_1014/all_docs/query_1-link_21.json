        "text": "John Yang:\n\nGood evening. I'm John Yang. It has been a tumultuous day in Russia. Late this afternoon, Wagner mercenary group founder, Yevgeny Prigozhin ordered an about face in his advance on the capital city of Moscow. His forces were on the move earlier today after taking control of Rostov-on-Don a city near the Ukrainian border that's a Russian military headquarters.\n\nYevgeny Prigozhin said he stopped his forces just hours short of Moscow to save Russian lives. He explained in an audio message.\n\nJohn Yang:\n\nAs tensions between the two Russian factions escalated, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy posted a taunting tweet, today the world saw that the bosses of Russia do not control anything.\n\nLate today, the Kremlin said it will drop all criminal charges against Prigozhin and that he will move to Belarus. That country's president, Alexander Lukashenko brokered the deal that defused the rebellion.\n\nCandace Rondeaux is the senior director for the Future Frontlines Program at the think tank New American. She's writing a book on the Wagner group.\n\nCandace, what was it that Yevgeny Prigozhin wanted, and did he achieve any of it?\n\nCandace Rondeaux:\n\nWell, this has been just a non-stop drama from the moment that he made his declaration that apparently Russian forces had attacked a group of Wagner forces near the Southern Military District area near Ukraine and the border of Rostov-on-Don. And that was some sort of precipitating action. And then we saw him moving north with apparently thousands of troops, tanks, infantry, you know, fighting vehicles.\n\nI think what he achieved today was insulation from what would have been maybe his inevitable downfall had the Wagner group been brought under the control of the Ministry of Defense, which was another precipitating cause.\n\nJust last week, Sergei Shuigu, the Minister of Defense, called for complete unity command, and that is for all Wagner group and volunteer forces to be under the control of the Kremlin of the Ministry of Defense. And you know, Prigozhin immediately raised objections to that very loudly. And so this march seems to have been designed to forestall that.\n\nAnd he seems to have once again slipped the noose, so to speak, and moved to Belarus for safety. As for a safe harbor.\n\nCandace Rondeaux:\n\nAbsolutely. This is a guy who, as a young man, trained as a cross country Olympic skier, didn't luck out because of a couple of different things that happened. He had an injury as a young man, turned to a life of crime, spent 10 years behind bars, while most of the rest of his contemporaries actually fought on the front lines in the Soviet war in Afghanistan. So he has that in common with Putin. He did not go to the front lines of Russia's biggest war other than, of course, Chechnya and this war.\n\nAnd when he got out of jail, out of prison, he turned himself around and became an entrepreneur of upscale food restaurants, big bistros in St. Petersburg. He was, of course, often connected with Putin because there are a few places at that time in the 1990s in St. Petersburg where you could actually have a good and upscale meal and Putin became sort of a patron.\n\nBut there were other patrons that have been operating in the shadows for Prigozhin for many years that people forget, people close to Putin, like Gennady Timchenko, the head of Volga Group, Sergey Chemezov, the head of Rostec, Russia's largest arms dealer.\n\nSo that kind of relationship, those sets of relationships, have helped Putin give Prigozhin the path he needs to take the kinds of risk that he did over these last couple of days, as we've seen over the last year and a half.\n\nCandace Rondeaux:\n\nWell, it is hard to imagine a situation of this kind unfolding in any other country in the world other than Russia. The only maybe other comparisons, maybe North Korea, but even that seems a bit of a stretch.\n\nI think what we saw today was something nobody would have believed. First, Putin threatening to deal brutally with the mutineers who mounted this kind of rebellion, a revolt against his regime, these mercenary fighters, and then suddenly within 8 hours, there's kind of a turnaround. Doesn't matter, you're all good.\n\nJust, you know, move next door and wait to see what happens. I think there is something a little bit strange about this outcome and I don't think we've seen the last of Mr. Prigozhin and I don't think for Putin he comes out of this looking good or smelling like roses."
