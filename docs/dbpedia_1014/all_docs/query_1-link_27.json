        "text": "Russia sees no chance of Switzerland leading efforts to secure peace in Ukraine, a senior Russian diplomat said on Tuesday, after Bern said it planned to host a high-level Ukraine peace conference in the coming months.\n\nSwiss authorities have said that Russia is unlikely to take part, at least not at the outset of the talks.\n\n\"As of now, we don't see any possibility that Switzerland would take the lead and organise something,\" said Gennady Gatilov, Russia's Permanent Representative to the United Nations in Geneva.\n\nRussia, which launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine two years ago, has said the Swiss initiative is doomed to fail without Moscow's participation.\n\nGatilov said that while Moscow was not against negotiations to end the war, it would not take part in talks in Switzerland, a country he said had relinquished its neutrality with its stance on the conflict.\n\nSwitzerland has adopted the European Union's sanctions against Russia over the invasion and frozen some 7.7 billion Swiss francs ($8.53 billion) in financial assets belonging to Russians, which Gatilov described as \"stolen money\".\n\n\"That's why we believe that Bern unfortunately devaluated its status as a neutral state,\" he said.\n\n— Reuters\n\nThe head of Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB) on Tuesday said that the U.S., U.K. and Ukraine were behind a deadly terrorist attack in Moscow last week.\n\nFSB chief Alexander Bortnikov told pro-Kremlin journalist Pavel Zarubin claimed that the U.S., U.K. and Ukraine were responsible for the attack, claiming that the attack was beneficial to Western intelligence services and Ukraine to destabilize Russia.\n\n\"We believe that the action was prepared by the radical Islamists themselves, and naturally the Western intelligence services contributed to this, and the Ukrainian intelligence services themselves are directly related to this,\" Bortnikov said, RIA Novosti reported.\n\nUkraine has already vehemently denied any involvement in the attack and the White House has said Russian claims to the contrary are \"Kremlin propaganda.\" The U.K., U.S. and Ukraine have not commented on Bortnikov's latest claims.\n\nAlmost 140 people were killed in the Crocus City Hall concert hall, when gunmen entered the venue and opened fire, as well as set fire to the venue. The Islamic State militant group claimed responsibility, but Russia was quick to connect Ukraine to the outrage, without presenting evidence.\n\nSince then, Russian President Vladimir Putin has accepted that the attack was carried out by so-called \"radical Islamists,\" but continued to claim Ukraine was linked to the attack.\n\nBortnikov reiterated Russia's claim that the attackers were caught, as they tried to flee toward Ukraine, where, he said, they were expected and were going to be greeted \"as heroes.\"\n\n\"The bandits intended to go abroad. Precisely to the territory of Ukraine. According to our preliminary operational information, they were expected there,\" he told Zarubin, in an interview posted in Russian on his Telegram channel.\n\n— Holly Ellyatt\n\nOne of the most powerful and influential men in Russian President Vladimir Putin's inner circle claimed unequivocally on Tuesday that Ukraine was responsible for the Moscow terrorist attack carried out last Friday.\n\nNikolai Patrushev — the secretary of Russia's Security Council and in charge of issuing guidance and policy proposals on national security issues — was asked by Russian reporters whether Ukraine or the Islamic State militant group was behind the attack that killed 139 people. The Islamic State group said it had carried out the attack.\n\n\"Of course Ukraine,\" Patrushev answered reporters, according to a Google-translated article from news agency RIA Novosti.\n\nA former intelligence officer and an ideological Kremlin figurehead who is extremely close to Putin, Patrushev joins the ranks of several high-profile Russian officials pointing the finger of blame at Ukraine without presenting any evidence of Kyiv's involvement.\n\nUkraine itself denies any role in the attack. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said it was \"absolutely predictable\" that Moscow would try to pin the blame on Ukraine.\n\nPatrushev's comments could signal that Moscow is ready to double down on its allegations of a link between Kyiv and the terror perpetrators. Analysts say the Kremlin is likely to use the attack to its advantage, politically, in any case, perhaps to put Russian citizens on a firmer war footing and ahead of possible further mobilization.\n\nSo far, the Kremlin has been cautious about giving further details or evidence to back up its claims of a connection. Putin's press secretary refused to be drawn on the matter earlier on Tuesday.\n\nOn Monday, Putin conceded that the attack had been carried out by \"radical Islamists,\" but once again claimed there was a link with Ukraine, again without presenting proof.\n\n— Holly Ellyatt\n\nThe Kremlin refused to comment Tuesday on whether it believed there was a link between the Ukrainian government and the gunmen who killed 139 people in a terrorist attack on a Moscow concert hall last Friday.\n\nAsked during a call with reporters whether there was a direct link between Ukraine and the \"radical Islamists\" that were behind the attack, as President Vladimir Putin described the suspects on Monday, Kremlin Press Secretary Dmitry Peskov said he had \"nothing to add to what has already been said on this topic.\"\n\n\"As for whether it is possible to say 'one way or another': you can say it any way you want. And observers and analysts can probably afford this. But (...) while the investigation is underway, the official authorities cannot afford to do any statements on this matter,\" Peskov told reporters, news agency Interfax reported.\n\n\"Although I recommend that you very carefully reread President Putin's statements that he made over the last two days. In this context, they are very important,\" Peskov said.\n\nDuring a conference call with Kremlin officials on Monday, President Putin said the attack was carried out by \"radical Islamists\" but again claimed that there was a link to Ukraine, or a \"Kyiv trace,\" as Moscow has described it and that U.S. intelligence dismissing any link was unconvincing.\n\nRussia has presented no evidence that there was any involvement by Ukraine and Kyiv itself vehemently denies any role in the deadly attack on concertgoers.\n\nEight suspects, nationals of Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan, have been remanded in custody and charged with terrorism offenses ahead of trial.\n\n— Holly Ellyatt\n\n\"A terrorist act planned by a citizen of the Russian Federation, born in 1994, an accomplice of the terrorist organization Russian Volunteer Corps (RDK), operating under the patronage of the Ukrainian special services, was prevented on the territory of the Samara region,\" the intelligence service said, according to Interfax.\n\nThe FSB reported that the suspect was in possession of an improvised explosive device and planned \"to detonate it in the building of a humanitarian aid reception point for one of the volunteer organizations.\" It did not provide evidence for the claim.\n\nThe FSB said the suspect had detonated the device during his arrest and he had been killed. CNBC was unable to verify the claims in the report.\n\n— Holly Ellyatt\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin conceded on Monday that the deadly terrorist attack in Moscow last Friday was carried out by \"radical Islamists\" but insisted that there was a link to Ukraine, without presenting evidence.\n\nPutin told senior Kremlin officials Monday that an investigation into the attack on the Crocus City Hall concert venue, in which 139 people died when gunmen entered the building and shot indiscriminately, \"must be carried out in the most professional manner, objectively, without any political bias.\"\n\nThe Islamic State group said it was behind the attack on Friday and published footage of it. Four men appeared in a Moscow court on Sunday night and were charged with terrorism offenses. Three more men were charged Monday.\n\nPutin initially suggested the attack was linked to Ukraine, claiming that the suspects had fled toward the border and that \"a window had been prepared for them on the Ukrainian side to cross the border.\" He did not present any evidence for the claim. Kyiv denies any involvement.\n\nOn Monday, Putin appeared to accept that the IS group was responsible for the attack but insisted that there was a link to Ukraine.\n\n\"We know that the crime was committed by radical Islamists, whose ideology the Islamic world itself has been fighting for centuries,\" Putin said, according to comments translated by NBC.\n\n\"But we also see that the United States, through various channels, is trying to convince its satellites and other countries of the world that, according to their intelligence data, there is supposedly no Kyiv trace in the Moscow terrorist attack, that the bloody terrorist attack was carried out by followers of Islam, members of the ISIS organization banned in Russia.\"\n\nU.S. officials have dismissed any Ukrainian involvement in the attack, with White House spokesperson John Kirby telling reporters, \"There was no linkage to Ukraine. ... This is just more Kremlin propaganda.\"\n\n— Holly Ellyatt\n\nThe head of Ukraine' Security Service (SBU) said more \"special operations\" will be carried out this year as Ukraine looks to inflict more damage on Russian military hardware and infrastructure.\n\n\"The Russians should expect more blasts ... We never repeat ourselves and if they change their defense system against our naval drones, we, of course, are one step ahead. Everything needs to be done in the right time, you will see how it goes,\" Vasyl Maliuk said in an interview with ICTV that was reported by news agency Ukrinform.\n\nMaliuk claimed Ukrainian security agencies have destroyed 809 Russian tanks, as well as other armored vehicles and e-warfare systems since the start of the war. He also said the security service was operating attack drones both against Russian front-line positions and within Russia itself. Ukraine has had success attacking Russia's Black Sea Fleet around Crimea as well as its energy industry.\n\nThe SBU has attacked 13 oil refineries across different regions of Russia in a bid to deplete Russia's energy export revenues that fund its war machine. Maliuk said Russia's refining capabilities had been reduced by 12%; British intelligence also suggests that at least 10% of Russia's refining capacity has been disrupted by Ukrainian attacks.\n\nWhen asked whether Russian refineries will continue to burn, Maliuk replied, \"Of course, they should expect more blasts.\"\n\n— Holly Ellyatt\n\nThe Islamic State group said it was behind the attack on Friday, which left 137 people dead and 182 injured.\n\nFour men suspected of carrying out the attack were charged with terrorism at a pre-trial hearing in a Moscow court on Sunday evening. Two of the suspects admitted their guilt in the attack, the court said on Telegram, according to a Google translation.\n\nA debate is raging in Russia over whether a moratorium on the death penalty should be lifted, with several prominent lawmakers reportedly arguing for the reintroduction of the punishment for terrorism convictions.\n\nEarlier, Kremlin Press Secretary Dmitry Peskov told reporters that the Kremlin was \"not currently taking part in this discussion.\"\n\n— Holly Ellyatt\n\nThe parents of Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich have expressed optimism over the state of government-level talks over his release, as he approaches his one-year anniversary in Russian captivity.\n\n\"We have president Biden's promise, delivered to us personally and in the State of the Union [address], and we know that the U.S. government is taking the case very seriously, so we are optimistic,\" Gershkovich's mother, Ella Milman, said during a televised ABC News interview.\n\nGershkovich's father, Mikhail, added they were \"happy that both governments have expressed willingness to negotiate.\"\n\nGershkovich was apprehended by Russian authorities on March 29, 2023, while on assignment in Yekaterinburg. He has been accused, including by Russian President Vladimir Putin, on charges of espionage – which his employer, the Wall Street Journal, vehemently denies.\n\nPutin has previously signaled the possibility of swapping Gershkovich for a Russian prisoner detained abroad, but an agreement has yet to be reached.\n\n— Ruxandra Iordache\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin's next move is being watched closely after he linked Ukraine to the deadly terrorist attack that took place in a Moscow concert hall Friday, leaving at least 137 people dead.\n\nRussian officials and pro-Kremlin hawks continue to level blame at Kyiv for the attack at the Crocus City Hall venue, where gunmen killed concert-goers, including three children, and wounded at least 140.\n\nKyiv vehemently denies any involvement and Russian authorities are investigating the attack.\n\nPolitical analysts say that whatever the outcome of that investigation, Putin is likely to use the tragedy to his advantage as he looks to boost domestic support for the war in Ukraine and to \"advance its broader geopolitical objectives,\" as one analyst put it.\n\nRead more on the story here: Putin expected to use deadly Moscow attack to Russia’s advantage, whoever’s to blame"
