        "text": "Commercial district in central Moscow, Russia\n\n\"Moscow-City\" redirects here. For the Moscow Metro station, see Moscow-City (Moscow Metro). For the city itself, see Moscow.\n\nThe Moscow International Business Center (MIBC),[a] also known as Moscow-City[b] and Moskva-City,[1] is a commercial development in Moscow, the capital of Russia. The project occupies an area of 60 hectares,[2] and is located just east of the Third Ring Road at the western edge of the Presnensky District in the Central Administrative Okrug. Construction of the MIBC takes place on the Presnenskaya Embankment of the Moskva River, approximately 4 kilometers (2.5 mi) west of Red Square.\n\nThe complex is home to the highest numbers of skyscrapers in Europe. The Government of Moscow first conceived the project in 1992, as a mixed development of office, residential, retail and entertainment facilities.[3] An estimated 250,000 – 300,000 people will be working in, living in, or visiting the complex at any given time.[2] By 2016, twelve of the twenty-three planned facilities of the MIBC were already built; seven buildings were under construction; and four were in the design stage.[4]\n\nGeneral description\n\n[edit]\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nBefore construction began, the area was a stone quarry and industrial zone, where most of the buildings were old factories that had been closed or abandoned. A public company, CITY, was created in 1992, to oversee the initial creation and development of Moscow City as well as its subsequent usage. CITY is also a general contractor and both landlord and lessor. Overall responsibility for the architectural planning and design of Moscow City belongs to the architectural studio No. 6, which is a part of the large Moscow practice Mosproject-2 named after Mikhail Vasilyevich Posokhin. This group, headed by Gennady Lvovich Sirota, who is officially the Chief Architect of Moskva-Citi, is in charge of overseeing the design of the complex as a whole and agreeing the details of individual projects. Each building lot has its own investor and architect. By 2014, the volume of investments in Moskva-City was approximately $12 billion.[5]\n\nManagement\n\n[edit]\n\nEstablished in the spring of 1992, the PJSC City Company manages the creation and development of the MIBC. On 30 December 1994, the Government of Moscow authorized PJSC City to act as the managing company for the MIBC and to negotiate with third parties to help develop the MIBC. As of February 2014, the company was owned by the Solvers Group, led by Oleg Malis.[6][7]\n\nBuildings\n\n[edit]\n\nCurrent status of construction Completed Topped out Under construction On hold Project Unknown\n\nList of building complexes\n\n[edit]\n\nRoof height, max height, and floors apply to the tallest building of the respective complex.

It connects Tower 2000 and the rest of the MIBC complex.\n\nRoad\n\n[edit]\n\nMajor thoroughfares that connect to the MIBC are the Third Ring Road, 3rd Magistralnaya street, and the Presnenskaya Embankment.\n\nTo correspond with the growing MIBC, new highways and interchanges were built to connect the MIBC with the main transport arteries of the city. These projects include the ten-lane Dorogomilovsky Bridge of the Third Ring Road over the Moskva River, the Third Ring Road interchange with Kutuzovsky Avenue, and the extension of the Presnenskaya Embankment. Existing roads were reconstructed and rearranged.\n\nRapid transit\n\n[edit]\n\nThe MIBC is served by three metro lines, and four stations. Two of the stations are named Delovoy Tsentr (Russian for \"business center\"). Vystavochnaya (formerly also known as Delovoy Tsentr) and Mezhdunarodnaya are on the Filyovskaya line. The first Delovoy Tsentr is on Kalininsko-Solntsevskaya line since 2014, but was closed from early 2018 to late 2020. The second Delovoy Tsentr station is served by a branch of the Bolshaya Koltsevaya line which is expected to be transferred to the Rublyovo-Arkhangelskaya line, currently under construction.\n\nThe MIBC in addition is served by the Moscow Central Circle urban rail, with a station also named Delovoy Tsentr which opened in 2016. The Testovskaya station, part of the D4 line of the Moscow Central Diameters, began serving the MIBC in September 2023. Another station named Testovskaya, north of the MIBC, is served by the D1 and the Aeroexpress. The main platforms of the station were closed for reconstruction in October 2023, and temporary wooden platforms are currently in use.[51]\n\nThere are also plans to install a high-speed rail system between the MIBC and Sheremetyevo International Airport.[citation needed]\n\nIncidents\n\n[edit]\n\nThere were a total of 7 incidents that occurred in the Moscow International Business Center, most of them related to fires.\n\nOn 2 April 2012, a fire occurred on the 67th floor of Federation Tower East/Vostok while it was under construction. 25 fire-fighting units and 4 helicopters of the Moscow Aviation Center responded and took four hours to extinguish the fire. Nobody was injured.[52]\n\nOn 25 January 2013, a fire occurred on the 24th floor of one of the skyscrapers at the OKO complex while it was under construction.[53]\n\nOn 12 January 2014, a fire occurred on the 15th floor of a 17-story building on Testovaya Street while it was under construction. The fire was extinguished and nobody was injured.[54]\n\nOn 9 July 2014, a fire occurred on Evolution Tower. The fire was extinguished and nobody was injured.[55]\n\nOn 18:45 on 31 August 2015, a fire occurred on the 33rd floor of Federation Tower East/Vostok due to the ignition of construction materials.[56]\n\nOn 18 June 2017, builderer Sergey Delyashov climbed Eurasia/Steel Peak and was later rescued.[57]\n\nOn 30 July 2023, a drone explosion damaged the OKO-2 and IQ-quarter buildings and broke multiple windows, injuring 1.[58] Another attack on 1 August 2023.[59] According to Western media, the drones were launched by the Ukrainian military or secret service and, according to experts, are primarily used for psychological warfare in the Russo-Ukrainian war.[60]\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nHudson Yards, a skyscraper complex in New York City, similar in nature and reputation\n\nOther commercial districts in Russia:\n\nLakhta Center\n\nYekaterinburg-City\n\nBuilding comparisons:\n\nList of tallest buildings in Moscow\n\nList of tallest buildings in Russia\n\nList of tallest buildings in Europe\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]\n\nNotes\n\n[edit]"
