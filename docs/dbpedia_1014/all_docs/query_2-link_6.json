        "text": "MOSCOW, Idaho (July 26, 2019)—One of North Idaho’s largest tech employers is expanding its presence in Moscow, Idaho with a new 70,000-square-foot headquarters.\n\nLocated on the north end of Moscow’s downtown, Emsi’s new 3.7-acre campus will house over 500 employees—offering the rapidly growing data software company ample room to grow.\n\n“One of the first goals for Emsi was to employ 50 people earning over $50,000 because good jobs in our town drive prosperity for everyone. Through striving to bless our customers, employees and shareholders, Emsi has enjoyed market success and is now privileged to be a part of Strada Education Network. With Strada’s backing and the crucial support of many people in Idaho, we are grateful and excited to build this signature building in Moscow,” said Andrew Crapuchettes, Emsi CEO.\n\nWhen Emsi moved to its current downtown building in early 2014, it had 92 employees. Now, Emsi employs over 200 people, with 160 of them working in Moscow. The new building will allow Emsi to continue growing its team of software developers, engineers, data scientists, economists, sales representatives and more.\n\n“Idaho is so proud of the employees and leaders at Emsi for their continued growth and contributions to Idaho and the Moscow community,” said Idaho Gov. Brad Little. “Emsi’s growth means they can employ more and more people with excellent jobs. The company also helps other Idaho businesses by offering labor market information that employers need. Emsi is a true Idaho success story, and I appreciate them for the role they play in promoting economic development in Idaho.”\n\nBy staying in Moscow, Emsi will continue to have access to a strong talent pipeline. Between University of Idaho, Washington State University and New Saint Andrews College, more than 550 students graduate each year with the skills required for Emsi’s key occupations. Many of those students choose to stay in the area due to quality of life.\n\n“Over the past 20 years, Emsi has grown into a software company with a profound impact on the economic development industry across the United States. We are excited that Emsi has decided to remain in Idaho and expand its headquarters,” said Idaho Commerce Director Tom Kealey. “We are particularly delighted when our Idaho communities and state work together on a comprehensive, competitive approach enabling an Idaho-born business to expand within the state.”\n\nMoscow Mayor Bill Lambert praised the Partnership for Economic Prosperity, the City’s Community Development Department and Idaho Commerce for their work in helping to make the Emsi project happen.\n\n“The continuing economic development partnership among the City, Latah County, the University of Idaho and Moscow Chamber of Commerce has been instrumental in making Moscow a great place to locate a business,” said Lambert.\n\n“The Partnership for Economic Prosperity could not be happier about Emsi’s expansion. This is exactly the kind of company that exemplifies why Moscow is a great community in which to start and grow a business,” said PEP Executive Director Gina Taruscio. “High quality jobs, great wages and an employer of choice. PEP is proud to have played a part in helping one of our local businesses grow.”\n\nEmsi hopes to break ground on the new four-story building in October 2019, with an estimated move-in date of late 2020. Hummel Architects, the 123-year-old Boise firm that designed the current University of Idaho administration building, will lead design.\n\nContacts:\n\nTimothy van den Broek\n\nChief Financial Officer\n\nEmsi\n\n(208) 274-5236\n\ninfo@economicmodeling.com\n\nwww.EconomicModeling.com\n\nTaylor Walker\n\nPublic Information Specialist\n\nIdaho Commerce\n\n(208) 780-5152\n\ntaylor.walker@commerce.idaho.gov"
