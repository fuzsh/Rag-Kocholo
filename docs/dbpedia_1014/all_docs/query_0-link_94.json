        "text": "Russian President Vladimir Putin has accused Ukraine of a \"large-scale provocation\" after defence officials said Ukrainian troops crossed into the south-western Kursk region.\n\nRussian officials said forces had been fighting off cross-border raids for multiple days.\n\nUkrainian officials have so far remained silent about the scope of the operation, and Associated Press was not able to immediately verify the Russian claims.\n\nIf confirmed, the incursion would be one of Ukraine's largest since the war began in February 2022.\n\n\"In the last 24 hours, our region has been heroically resisting attacks\" by Ukrainian fighters, Kursk Acting Governor Alexei Smirnov said on Telegram.\n\nHe added all emergency services were on high alert, and urged residents to donate blood due to the intense fighting.\n\nMr Smirnov said authorities had evacuated more than 200 people from areas under threat, while several thousand others left in their own vehicles.\n\nMr Putin also met with his top defence and security officials to discuss what he called the \"indiscriminate shelling of civilian buildings, residential houses, ambulances with different types of weapons.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Ukraine has ordered the evacuation of 6,000 people from areas surrounding the Kursk region.\n\nAt least two dead in shelling, Russia says\n\nThe Russian Defense Ministry said Tuesday that up to 300 Ukrainian troops, supported by 11 tanks and more than 20 armoured combat vehicles, had crossed into Russia.\n\nIt added on Wednesday that military and border guard troops \"continued to destroy Ukrainian military units in the areas alongside the border in the Kursk region.\"\n\nRussian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said shelling killed at least two people — a paramedic and an ambulance driver — and injured 24.\n\nThe ministry said Russian forces stopped any advances deeper into Russian territory.\n\nCross-border foray could draw out Russian reserves\n\nKyiv's aim in the cross-border foray could be to draw Russian reserves to the area and potentially weaken Moscow's offensive operations in several parts of Ukraine's eastern Donetsk region, where Russian forces have increased attacks.\n\nBut it could risk stretching outmanned Ukrainian troops further along the front line, which is more than 1,000 kilometres long.\n\nGiven Russia's vast manpower and the relatively small number of Ukrainian forces engaged in the operation, a Moscow decision to commit reserves to stabilise the new front would likely have little long-term impact.\n\nHowever, the operation could boost Ukrainian morale at a time when Kyiv's forces are facing relentless Russian attacks and are expected to face more in coming weeks.\n\nResponsibility for previous incursions into Russia's Belgorod and Bryansk regions has been claimed by the Russian Volunteer Corps and the Freedom of Russia Legion which are made up of Russian citizens and have fought alongside Ukrainian forces."
