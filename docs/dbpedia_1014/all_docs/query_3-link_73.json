        "text": "E.O. 14024 establishes a new national emergency under which sanctions may be imposed against individuals and entities furthering specified harmful foreign activities of the Russian Federation. This national emergency is separate from the national emergency relating to the crisis in Ukraine, declared in E.O. 13660 and further addressed in E.O.s 13661, 13662, 13685, and 13849. E.O. 14024 addresses national security threats posed by specified harmful foreign activities of the Russian Federation, including: its efforts to undermine the conduct of free and fair democratic elections and democratic institutions in the United States and its allies and partners; engaging in and facilitating malicious cyber-enabled activities against the United States and its allies and partners; fostering and using transnational corruption to influence foreign governments; pursuing extraterritorial activities targeting dissidents or journalists; undermining security in countries and regions important to United States national security; and violating well-established principles of international law, including respect for the territorial integrity of states.\n\nLike any other blocking Executive order, E.O. 14024 permits the United States to impose blocking and short-of-blocking sanctions. The Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) issued several directives under E.O. 14024 specifying certain prohibitions relating to persons determined to be subject to the applicable directive. OFAC recommends reviewing the sanctions lists maintained by OFAC, including the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List (SDN List), the List of Foreign Financial Institutions Subject to Correspondent Account or Payable-Through Account Sanctions (CAPTA List), and the Non-SDN Menu-Based Sanctions List (NS-MBS List), to determine which sanctions are applicable.\n\nOn December 22, 2023, the President issued E.O. 14114, “Taking Additional Steps With Respect to the Russian Federation’s Harmful Activities,” which amended E.O. 14024 to further address the Russian Federation’s continued use of its military-industrial base to aid its effort to undermine security in countries and regions important to United States national security. See FAQ 1147 for information on how E.O. 14114 amended E.O. 14024.\n\nDate Updated: February 23, 2024\n\nEven prior to June 14, 2021, “U.S. banks” were prohibited from participating in the primary market for non-ruble denominated bonds issued by the Russian sovereign (including the Central Bank of the Russian Federation, the National Wealth Fund of the Russian Federation, and the Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation), and from lending non-ruble denominated funds to the Russian sovereign pursuant to the Russia-related Directive under Executive Order 13883 (“CBW Act Directive”), which was issued on August 2, 2019 and went into effect on August 26, 2019. However, the CBW Act Directive does not prohibit “U.S. banks” (as defined in the CBW Act Directive) from participating in the primary market for ruble denominated bonds issued by the Russian sovereign, or the lending of ruble denominated funds to the Russian sovereign.\n\nPursuant to Directive 1A under (E.O.) 14024 , “Prohibitions Related to Certain Sovereign Debt of the Russian Federation” (Russia-related Sovereign Debt Directive), after June 14, 2021, U.S. financial institutions (as defined in the Russia-related Sovereign Debt Directive) are prohibited from participating in the primary market for ruble or non-ruble denominated bonds issued by, or the lending of ruble or non-ruble denominated funds to, the Central Bank of the Russian Federation, the National Wealth Fund of the Russian Federation, or the Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation, unless otherwise authorized by OFAC or exempt. Pursuant to the Russia-related Sovereign Debt Directive, as of March 1, 2022, U.S. financial institutions are also prohibited from participating in the secondary market for ruble or non-ruble denominated bonds issued after March 1, 2022 by these entities.\n\nNote that the prohibitions found in the CBW Act Directive remain in effect and are separate from the prohibitions of the Russia-related Sovereign Debt Directive, or other directives under E.O. 14024. For more information on the CBW Act Directive, please see FAQs 673 - 678.\n\nDate Updated: March 02, 2022\n\nThe Russia-related CAPTA Directive prohibits U.S. financial institutions from: (i) the opening or maintaining of a correspondent account or payable-through account for or on behalf of foreign financial institutions determined to be subject to the prohibitions of the Russia-related CAPTA Directive; and (ii) the processing of transactions involving foreign financial institutions determined to be subject to the prohibitions of the Russia-related CAPTA Directive. Please see the Russia-related CAPTA Directive for the definition of the terms “U.S. financial institution” and “foreign financial institution” for purposes of this directive. Please see FAQ 969 regarding the applicability of OFAC’s 50 Percent Rule with respect to this directive.\n\nAnnex 1 to the Russia-related CAPTA Directive lists the foreign financial institutions determined to be subject to the prohibitions as of March 26, 2022. Foreign financial institutions determined to be subject to the prohibitions of the Russia-related CAPTA Directive, including the foreign financial institutions listed in Annex 1, can be found on the Office of Foreign Assets Control’s (OFAC) List of Foreign Financial Institutions Subject to Correspondent Account or Payable-Through Account Sanctions (CAPTA List). Relevant entries on the CAPTA List will denote when a foreign financial institution became subject to the prohibitions of the Russia-related CAPTA Directive, as well as when the prohibitions of the Russia-related CAPTA Directive come into effect with respect to that foreign financial institution.\n\nThe below table identifies the dates the prohibitions of the Russia-related CAPTA Directive take effect for (i) foreign financial institutions listed in Annex 1 to the Russia-related CAPTA Directive, and (ii) foreign financial institutions otherwise determined to be subject to its prohibitions and added to the CAPTA List.\n\nForeign Financial Institution Type Relevant Sanctions Effective Date Foreign financial institutions listed in Annex 1 to the Russia-related CAPTA Directive 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on March 26, 2022 Foreign financial institution otherwise determined to be subject to the prohibitions of the Russia-related CAPTA Directive 12:01 a.m. eastern time on the date that is 30 days after the date of such determination\n\nU.S. financial institutions must close any correspondent or payable-through account maintained for or on behalf of foreign financial institutions determined to be subject to the prohibitions of the Russia-related CAPTA Directive, or their property or interests in property, by the relevant effective date. Separately, as of the relevant effective date, U.S. financial institutions may not process transactions involving foreign financial institutions determined to be subject to the prohibitions of the Russia-related CAPTA Directive, or their property or interests in property, and must reject such transactions unless exempt or authorized by OFAC.\n\nAccordingly, after the relevant effective date, U.S. financial institutions must reject any transaction involving a foreign financial institution determined to be subject to the prohibitions of the Russia-related CAPTA Directive or involving that foreign financial institution’s property or interests in property. This includes rejecting transactions related to any securities (including depositary receipts) issued by a foreign financial institution determined to be subject to the prohibitions of the Russia-related CAPTA Directive, including secondary market trading. For certain authorized securities-related transactions, see GL 9C and FAQ 981. By virtue of the prohibition on the processing of transactions for or on behalf of foreign financial institutions determined to be subject to the prohibitions of the Russia-related CAPTA Directive, U.S. financial institutions are also prohibited from engaging in transactions with a covered foreign financial institution in connection with the foreign financial institution’s role as a local custodian for depositary receipt issuances.\n\nThe Russia-related CAPTA Directive does not impose blocking sanctions and, thus, does not require U.S. financial institutions (or other U.S. persons) to block the assets of foreign financial institutions determined to be subject to the prohibitions of this directive. However, U.S. persons should be aware that foreign financial institutions subject to the prohibitions of the Russia-related CAPTA Directive may also be subject to additional prohibitions under other sanctions authorities, such as additional directives under E.O. 14024 or E.O. 13662.\n\nOFAC issued several Russia-related general licenses (GLs) authorizing certain transactions involving the foreign financial institutions subject to the prohibitions of the Russia-related CAPTA Directive, including:\n\nGL 6B: authorizing transactions related to (1) the production, manufacturing, sale, or transport of agricultural commodities, agricultural equipment, medicine, medical devices, replacement parts and components for medical devices, or software updates for medical devices; (2) the prevention, diagnosis, or treatment of COVID-19 (including research or clinical studies relating to COVID-19); or (3) ongoing clinical trials and other medical research activities;\n\nGL 7A: authorizing overflight payments, emergency landings, and air ambulance services;\n\nGL 8C: authorizing transactions related to energy; and\n\nGL 27: authorizing transactions in support of nongovernmental organizations’ activities\n\nOn March 1, 2022, OFAC issued the Russian Harmful Foreign Activities Sanctions Regulations, 31 CFR part 587 (RuHSR), which incorporate GL 5 in section 587.510 of the RuHSR.\n\nFor additional information, please see FAQs 976, 977, 978, 979, 981, 982 and 990.\n\nDate Updated: July 14, 2022\n\nOn February 22, 2022, the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) designated specified Russian financial institutions pursuant to E.O. 14024 , including the State Corporation Bank for Development and Foreign Economic Affairs Vnesheconombank (VEB), Promsvyazbank Public Joint Stock Company, and many of their subsidiaries. OFAC designated additional Russian financial institutions on February 24, 2022, including VTB Bank Public Joint Stock Company, Public Joint Stock Company Bank Financial Corporation Otkritie (Otkritie), Sovcombank Open Joint Stock Company (Sovcombank), Joint Stock Commercial Bank Novikombank, and many of these financial institutions’ subsidiaries. As a result, all property and interests in property of these entities in the possession or control of U.S. persons, including U.S. financial institutions, or within U.S. jurisdiction, are blocked and must be reported to OFAC. In addition, all property and interests in property of any entity that is owned, directly or indirectly, individually or in the aggregate, 50 percent or more by one or more blocked persons are also blocked. Accordingly, U.S. persons, including U.S. financial institutions, are prohibited from transacting with these entities unless exempt or authorized by OFAC.\n\nOFAC issued several Russia-related general licenses (GLs) authorizing transactions involving specified blocked Russian financial institutions, including:\n\n• GL 2 : authorizing certain transactions involving VEB related to servicing obligations of certain Russian sovereign debt;\n\n• GL 3: authorizing the wind down of certain transactions involving VEB until 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time, March 24, 2022;\n\n• GL 11: authorizing the wind down of certain transactions involving VTB Bank Public Joint Stock Company, Otkritie, and Sovcombank until 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time, March 26, 2022; and\n\n• GL 12: authorizing the rejection (rather than blocking) of certain transactions involving VTB Bank Public Joint Stock Company, Otkritie, and Sovcombank until 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time, March 26, 2022.\n\nNote that these GLs do not authorize certain activities with all blocked Russian financial institutions; nor does each GL authorize certain activities with the same group of blocked Russian financial institutions. For example, the GLs listed above do not authorize any transactions involving Promsvyazbank Public Joint Stock Company or Joint Stock Commercial Bank Novikombank, and GLs 2 and 3 relate only to VEB.\n\nOther GLs that may be applicable to one or more of the Russian financial institutions blocked in February 2022 include:\n\n• GL 5: authorizing transactions related to the official business of certain international organizations and other entities;\n\n• GL 6: authorizing certain transactions related to the exportation or reexportation of agricultural commodities, medicine, medical devices, replacement parts and components, or software updates, or the prevention, diagnosis, or treatment of COVID-19;\n\n• GL 7: authorizing overflight payments, emergency landings, and air ambulance services;\n\n• GL 8A: authorizing transactions related to energy;\n\n• GL 9A: authorizing transactions related to dealings in certain debt and equity until 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time, May 25, 2022; and\n\n• GL 10A: authorizing certain transactions related to derivative contracts until 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time, May 25, 2022.\n\nPlease consult each GL for further information regarding its scope.\n\nOn March 1, 2022, OFAC issued the Russian Harmful Foreign Activities Sanctions Regulations, 31 CFR part 587 (RuHSR), which incorporate GL 5 in section 587.510 of the RuHSR.\n\nAdditionally, consistent with section 9 of E.O. 14024, transactions for the conduct of the official business of the Federal Government or the United Nations (including its specialized agencies, programs, funds, and related organizations) by employees, grantees, and contractors thereof are exempt from the sanctions prohibitions of E.O. 14024.\n\nDate Updated: March 02, 2022\n\nFor certain Russian financial institutions blocked in February 2022 pursuant to E.O. 14024, a short-term wind-down period is authorized. General License (GL) 3 authorizes a wind-down period of 30 days for transactions involving State Corporation Bank for Development and Foreign Economic Affairs Vnesheconombank (VEB), and GL 11 authorizes a wind-down period of 30 days for transactions involving VTB Bank Public Joint Stock Company, Public Joint Stock Company Bank Financial Corporation Otkritie, or Sovcombank Open Joint Stock Company. These authorizations also apply to any entity in which these financial institutions own, directly or indirectly, individually or in the aggregate, a 50 percent or greater interest.\n\nGLs 3 and 11 authorize U.S. persons to engage in transactions ordinarily incident and necessary to exit operations, contracts, or other agreements that were in effect prior to the date of blocking involving the specified blocked Russian financial institutions, provided that such transactions do not involve a debit to a blocked account on the books of a U.S. financial institution (see FAQ 990). For example, a U.S. financial institution may take steps necessary to collect on outstanding loans made to a blocked person, including exercising rights to any collateral related thereto, as authorized wind-down activity, provided the transaction does not involve a debit to a blocked account on the books of a U.S. financial institution (unless separately authorized). A U.S. financial institution may also take steps necessary to pay outstanding loans, provided that, if such payment is for the benefit of a blocked person, it must be transferred into a blocked account. Similarly, a U.S. financial institution may take steps necessary to close a correspondent account maintained for a blocked person; however, funds in the correspondent account may not be returned to the blocked person, and must remain blocked, absent separate authorization from OFAC.\n\nGLs 3 and 11 authorize only new or continued business activities that are ordinarily incident and necessary to wind-down activities. Wind-down activities do not include the continued processing of funds transfers, securities trades, or other transactions involving a blocked person that were part of ongoing business activities prior to the imposition of sanctions, unless separately authorized (see, e.g., GLs 8, 9, and 10). Moreover, GLs 3 and 11 do not apply to all Russian financial institutions blocked in February 2022, such as Promsvyazbank Public Joint Stock Company or Joint Stock Commercial Bank Novikombank, or transactions involving other persons blocked pursuant to E.O. 14024, other than the blocked Russian financial institutions specified in GLs 3 and 11.\n\nIn addition to GLs 3 and 11, OFAC issued GL 12 to authorize U.S. persons to reject, rather than block, prohibited transactions involving specified blocked Russian financial institutions for 30 days. This authorizes, for example, a U.S. financial institution to reject, rather than block, an attempted unauthorized funds transfer until the expiration of GL 12. The authorization provided in GL 3 expires at 12:01 eastern daylight time, March 24, 2022. The authorizations provided in GLs 11 and 12 expire at 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time, March 26, 2022.\n\nFor more information on the prohibitions that apply to Russian financial institutions blocked pursuant to E.O. 14024 in February 2022, or related authorizations, please see FAQ 974.\n\nFor guidance regarding transactions involving securities and derivatives contracts related to the blocked persons listed above, see FAQ 982.\n\nGeneral License (GL) 8J authorizes certain transactions “related to energy” (as defined in the GL; see also FAQ 977) involving the following entities (collectively, “Covered Entities”):\n\nState Corporation Bank for Development and Foreign Economic Affairs Vnesheconombank (VEB);\n\nPublic Joint Stock Company Bank Financial Corporation Otkritie;\n\nSovcombank Open Joint Stock Company;\n\nPublic Joint Stock Company Sberbank of Russia;\n\nVTB Bank Public Joint Stock Company;\n\nJoint Stock Company Alfa-Bank;\n\nPublic Joint Stock Company Rosbank;\n\nBank Zenit Public Joint Stock Company;\n\nBank Saint-Petersburg Public Joint Stock Company;\n\nNational Clearing Center (NCC);\n\nAny entity owned 50 percent or more, directly or indirectly, individually or in the aggregate, by one of the above entities; and\n\nThe Central Bank of the Russian Federation.\n\nGL 8J does not authorize any transaction prohibited by Directive 1A under E.O. 14024, “Prohibitions Related to Certain Sovereign Debt of the Russian Federation” (Russia-related Sovereign Debt Directive). In addition, GL 8C does not authorize any debit to an account on the books of a U.S. financial institution of the Central Bank of the Russian Federation. Further, GL 8J does not authorize a U.S. financial institution to maintain (or open) a correspondent account or payable-through account for or on behalf of foreign financial institutions subject to the prohibitions of Directive 2 under E.O. 14024, “Prohibitions Related to Correspondent or Payable-Through Accounts and Processing of Transactions Involving Certain Foreign Financial Institutions” (the “Russia-related CAPTA Directive”). Consequently, in order for a U.S. financial institution to engage in transactions authorized by GL 8C, all funds transfers related to energy involving one or more Covered Entities must be processed indirectly through a non-sanctioned, non-U.S. financial institution. Please see FAQ 978 for examples of authorized and prohibited transactions flows under certain GLs, including GL 8J.\n\nFor purposes of assessing whether certain transactions are authorized under GL 8J, U.S. persons may rely upon the information available to them in the ordinary course of business, including reasonable reliance on information about the underlying transaction provided by the parties thereto.\n\nGL 8J is valid until 12:01 eastern daylight time, November 1, 2024 unless renewed. Persons unable to wind down prohibited transactions with the Covered Entities by November 1, 2024 are encouraged to approach the Office of Foreign Assets Control, which may consider renewing GL 8J. Please see FAQs 977, 978, 1010, 1111, and 1012 for additional guidance related to GL 8J.\n\nGL 8J provides authorization solely under E.O. 14024. Therefore, U.S. financial institutions that rely on the authorization provided in GL 8J to process transactions related to energy must also comply with the prohibitions of E.O. 14066, E.O. 14068, and E.O. 14071 (see FAQs 1013, 1014 and 1015).\n\nUpdated: June 12, 2024\n\nOFAC evaluates a range of factors when developing sanctions targets, consistent with foreign policy and national security goals. In the context of blocking sanctions, non-U.S. persons may be exposed to sanctions risk in relation to activities with persons subject to blocking sanctions pursuant to E.O. 14024. Under E.O. 14024, non-U.S. persons may be designated if they have materially assisted, sponsored, or provided financial, material, or technological support for, or goods or services to or in support of, certain activities, a person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to E.O. 14024, or (in certain circumstances) a blocked government. Please see sections 1(a)(vi) and 1(b) of E.O. 14024.\n\nNon-U.S. persons generally do not risk exposure to U.S. blocking sanctions under E.O. 14024 for engaging in transactions with persons subject to the prohibitions of the directives under E.O. 14024. Moreover, non-U.S. persons generally do not risk exposure to U.S. blocking sanctions under E.O. 14024 for engaging in transactions with blocked persons, where those transactions would not require a specific license if engaged in by a U.S. person. Note, however, that E.O. 14024 and the directives under E.O. 14024 prohibit any transaction that evades or avoids, has the purpose of evading or avoiding, causes a violation of, or attempts to violate any of the prohibitions of those directives, as well as any conspiracy formed to violate any of the prohibitions of those directives. OFAC will not view as “evading or avoiding” efforts by non-U.S. persons to comply with U.S. sanctions by replacing sanctioned suppliers or service providers (including financial institutions) with non-sanctioned persons.\n\nGeneral License (GL) 9A authorizes U.S. persons, until 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time May 25, 2022, to engage in transactions prohibited by the Russian Harmful Foreign Activities Sanctions Regulations, 31 CFR part 587, that are ordinarily incident and necessary to dealings in debt or equity issued prior to February 24, 2022 of one or more of the following entities (“covered debt or equity”), provided that any divestment or transfer of, or facilitation of divestment or transfer of, covered debt or equity must be to a non-U.S. person:\n\nState Corporation Bank for Development and Foreign Economic Affairs Vnesheconombank (VEB);\n\nPublic Joint Stock Company Bank Financial Corporation Otkritie;\n\nSovcombank Open Joint Stock Company;\n\nPublic Joint Stock Company Sberbank of Russia;\n\nVTB Bank Public Joint Stock Company;\n\nAny entity owned 50 percent or more, directly or indirectly, individually or in the aggregate, by one of the above entities.\n\nThis authorization includes the facilitation, clearing, and settling of transactions ordinarily incident and necessary to divest covered debt or equity to a non-U.S. person, including on behalf of U.S. persons. Also, as part of a divestment transaction to a non-U.S. person, U.S. persons may engage in purchases of or investment in covered debt or equity if ordinarily incident and necessary to buy to cover a short position in such holdings.\n\nTo allow the closing of trades initiated before February 24, 2022, paragraph (b) of GL 9A authorizes all transactions that are ordinarily incident and necessary to facilitating, clearing, and settling trades of covered debt or equity through 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time May 25, 2022, provided such trades were placed prior to 4:00 p.m. eastern standard time on February 24, 2022, including debits to accounts on the books of U.S. financial institutions of certain blocked entities.\n\nGL 9A also authorizes U.S. persons to receive interest, dividend, or maturity payments on debt or equity of the Central Bank of the Russian Federation, the National Wealth Fund of the Russian Federation, and the Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation through 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on May 25, 2022. After May 25, 2022, U.S. persons would require a specific license to continue to receive such payments.\n\nCertain transactions otherwise prohibited by the Russian Harmful Foreign Activities Sanctions Regulations, 31 CFR part 587, are not authorized by GL 9A. Please see GL 9A for additional details. Please also see GL 10A with respect to authorizations related to certain derivative contracts.\n\nFor purposes of assessing whether certain transactions are authorized under GL 9A or GL 10A, U.S. persons—including financial institutions, registered broker-dealers in securities, securities exchanges, and other market intermediaries and participants—may rely upon the information available to them in the ordinary course of business, including reasonable reliance on information about the underlying transaction provided by the parties thereto. However, U.S. persons should also exercise caution in engaging in foreign exchange transactions on the Moscow Exchange given the current heightened risk that the Central Bank of the Russia Federation could be a counterparty to such transactions (see FAQ 1002).\n\nDate Updated: March 02, 2022\n\nThe Russia-related Entities Directive prohibits certain dealings by U.S. persons or within the United States in new debt of longer than 14 days maturity or new equity of Russian entities determined to be subject to the prohibitions of the directive or their property or interests in property. The prohibitions of the Russia-related Entities Directive are effective beginning on 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time, March 26, 2022 for entities listed in Annex 1 to the Russia-related Entities Directive, or their property or interests in property. For entities subsequently determined to be subject to the prohibitions of the Russia-related Entities Directive, the prohibitions are effective 12:01 a.m. eastern time 30 days following such determination.\n\nSpecifically, the Russia-related Entities Directive prohibits the following activities by U.S. persons or within the United States: all transactions in, provision of financing for, and other dealings in new debt with a maturity of greater than 14 days or new equity of entities listed in Annex 1 to the Russia-related Entities Directive or otherwise determined to be subject to the prohibitions of the Russia-related Entities Directive, or their property or interests in property, where such debt or equity is issued on or after the relevant sanctions effective date. Please see FAQ 985 regarding the applicability of OFAC’s 50 Percent Rule with respect to this directive.\n\nThese prohibitions apply to all new debt with a maturity of greater than 14 days and new equity irrespective of currency denomination.\n\nIn addition, the Russia-related Entities Directive prohibits: (1) any transaction that evades or avoids, has the purpose of evading or avoiding, causes a violation of, or attempts to violate any of the prohibitions of the Russia-related Entities Directive; and (2) any conspiracy formed to violate any of the prohibitions of the Russia-related Entities Directive.\n\nSome entities determined to be subject to the prohibitions of the Russia-related Entities Directive may also be subject to prohibitions in other sanctions authorities, such as prohibitions of other directives issued under E.O. 14024, or directives issued under E.O. 13662. It is important to note that each directive operates independently of the others. For example, if a transaction involves a person subject to two separate directives, a U.S. person engaging in that transaction must comply with both directives.\n\nThe Russia-related Sovereign Transactions Directive prohibits U.S. persons from engaging in any transaction involving the Central Bank of the Russian Federation, the National Wealth Fund of the Russian Federation, or the Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation (collectively, “Directive 4 entities”), including any transfer of assets to such entities or any foreign exchange transaction for or on behalf of such entities. Effective February 28, 2022, U.S. persons may not engage in any transactions involving these entities unless exempt or authorized by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC). This includes both direct and indirect transactions involving any Directive 4 entity. Prohibited transactions include trade or financial transactions and other dealings in which U.S. persons may not engage unless exempt or expressly authorized by OFAC.\n\nThe Russia-related Sovereign Transactions Directive also prohibits: (1) any transaction that evades or avoids, has the purpose of evading or avoiding, causes a violation of, or attempts to violate any of the prohibitions of the Russia-related Sovereign Transactions Directive; and (2) any conspiracy formed to violate any of the prohibitions of the Russia-related Sovereign Transactions Directive.\n\nThis action effectively immobilizes any assets of the Directive 4 entities that are held in the United States or by U.S. persons, wherever located, unless exempt or authorized by OFAC. Effective February 28, 2022, U.S. financial institutions must reject transactions involving any Directive 4 entity, unless exempt or authorized by OFAC, and file a report within 10 business days in accordance with 31 CFR § 501.604. OFAC issued general licenses that authorize certain limited transactions involving the Directive 4 entities (see FAQ 999).\n\nOn May 19, 2023, OFAC amended Directive 4 to require U.S. persons to submit a report to OFACreport@treasury.gov on or before June 18, 2023, and annually thereafter by June 30, regarding property in their possession or control in which any Directive 4 entity has an interest of any nature whatsoever, direct or indirect. This reporting requirement is intended to identify assets of Directive 4 entities held by U.S. persons as of May 31, 2023, and annually thereafter, and is separate from the above-noted requirement under 31 CFR 501.604 to file reports on rejected transactions involving any Directive 4 entity.\n\nEntities determined to be subject to the Russia-related Sovereign Transactions Directive are listed on OFAC’s Non-SDN Menu-Based Sanctions (NS-MBS) List.\n\nDate Updated: May 19, 2023\n\nThe energy sector of the Russian Federation economy itself is not subject to comprehensive sanctions. However, prohibitions or restrictions may apply to certain energy-related transactions under several sanctions authorities, including prohibitions issued pursuant to E.O. 13662, E.O. 14024, E.O. 14066, E.O. 14071, and E.O. 14068.\n\nPursuant to E.O. 14066, the import into the United States of crude oil; petroleum; petroleum fuels, oils, and products of their distillation; liquefied natural gas; coal; and coal products of Russian Federation origin is prohibited; and U.S. persons, wherever located, are prohibited from new investment in the energy sector in the Russian Federation, among other things.\n\nE.O. 14066 does not prohibit transactions such as the unwinding of contracts or other business-related activities by U.S. persons to comply with the import ban imposed under E.O. 14066. Likewise, E.O. 14066 does not prohibit U.S. persons from engaging in transactions to sell or re-direct shipments that were laden on or after March 8, 2022 and previously destined for the United States. The Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) has also authorized until April 22, 2022 certain transactions prohibited by E.O. 14066 (see FAQs 1013 – 1020).\n\nIn addition, pursuant to E.O. 14024, OFAC has imposed expansive sanctions on persons that operate or have operated in the financial services sector of the Russian Federation economy (see FAQ 966). To limit the degree to which these financial services sector sanctions may inhibit energy-related transactions, OFAC has issued Russia-related General License (GL) 8C authorizing U.S. persons to process energy-related transactions involving the sanctioned Russian financial institutions identified in GL 8C. GL 8C expires at 12:01 a.m. eastern standard time, December 5, 2022, unless renewed (see FAQs 976, 977, 978, 1011, and 1012).\n\nEnergy-related transactions authorized in GL 8C include payments connected with a variety of upstream and downstream activities, including the extraction, production, refinement, liquefaction, gasification, regasification, conversion, enrichment, fabrication, transport, or purchase of energy for import from the Russian Federation to countries other than the United States or for export to the Russian Federation, as well as financing, loading, or unloading related to such processes (see FAQ 977). However, transactions related to new investment in the energy sector in the Russian Federation are not authorized pursuant to GL 8C.\n\nUpdated: June 14, 2022\n\nYes. The Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) has imposed expansive sanctions actions against certain Russian entities and individuals pursuant to E.O. 14024, in addition to other authorities. All U.S. persons are required to comply with OFAC regulations, regardless of whether a transaction is denominated in traditional fiat currency or virtual currency (see FAQ 560).\n\nSanctioned Russian persons are known to employ a wide variety of measures in their efforts to evade U.S. and international sanctions. As such, U.S. persons, wherever located, including firms that process virtual currency transactions, must be vigilant against attempts to circumvent OFAC regulations and must take risk-based steps to ensure they do not engage in prohibited transactions. For additional information regarding sanctions compliance best practices for the virtual currency industry, please see OFAC’s Sanctions Compliance Guidance for the Virtual Currency Industry.\n\nU.S. persons, including virtual currency exchanges, virtual wallet hosts, and other service providers, such as those that provide nested services for foreign exchanges, are generally prohibited from engaging in or facilitating prohibited transactions, including virtual currency transactions in which blocked persons have an interest. U.S. persons are further prohibited from engaging in or facilitating any transaction by a non-U.S. person that would be prohibited if performed by a U.S. person or within the United States, including virtual currency transactions involving the Central Bank of the Russian Federation, National Wealth Fund of the Russian Federation, or the Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation. Among other activities, U.S. financial institutions are also generally prohibited from processing transactions, including virtual currency transactions, involving foreign financial institutions that are determined to be subject to the prohibitions of Directive 2 under Executive Order 14024, “Prohibitions Related to Correspondent or Payable-Through Accounts and Processing of Transactions Involving Certain Foreign Financial Institutions” (Russia-related CAPTA Directive). For additional information regarding the Russia-related CAPTA Directive, please see FAQ 967.\n\nNon-U.S. persons are also subject to certain OFAC prohibitions. Such persons, for example, are prohibited from causing or conspiring to cause U.S. persons to violate U.S. sanctions, as well as engaging in conduct that evades or avoids a violation of OFAC sanctions. Violations of OFAC regulations may result in criminal or civil penalties.\n\nE.O. 14024 further authorizes sanctions against persons determined to be responsible for or complicit in, or to have directly or indirectly engaged or attempted to engage in, deceptive or structured transactions or dealings to circumvent U.S. sanctions, including through the use of digital currencies or assets, or the use of physical assets. E.O. 14024 also authorizes sanctions against persons determined to operate or to have operated in the financial services or technology sectors of the Russian Federation economy, as well as persons that have materially assisted, sponsored, or provided financial, material, or technological support for, or goods or services to or in support of, blocked persons.\n\nOFAC is closely monitoring any efforts to circumvent or violate Russia-related sanctions, including through the use of virtual currency, and is committed to using its broad enforcement authorities to act against violations and to promote compliance.\n\nFor additional information regarding the application of sanctions to virtual currency, please see FAQs 559, 560, 561, 562, 563, 594, 646, 647, and 971, as well as OFAC’s Sanctions Compliance Guidance for the Virtual Currency Industry.\n\nFor additional Treasury guidance on Russia and sanctions evasion, please see FinCEN’s Alert on Increased Vigilance for Potential Russian Sanctions Evasion Attempts.\n\nFor the purposes of the respective E.O.s, the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) views “investment” as the commitment of capital or other assets for the purpose of generating returns or appreciation. OFAC interprets “new” investment as such a commitment made on or after the effective date of the respective E.O. prohibitions. As a general matter, new investment includes such commitments that are pursuant to an agreement entered on or after the effective dates of the respective E.O. prohibitions. New investment also includes such commitments pursuant to the exercise of rights under an agreement entered into before the effective dates of the respective E.O. prohibitions, where such commitment is made on or after the effective dates of the respective E.O. prohibitions. We note, however, that new investment does not include the maintenance of an investment made prior to the applicable effective dates of the respective E.O. prohibitions (see FAQ 1050).\n\nUnless exempt or otherwise authorized by OFAC, transactions that OFAC considers to be “new investment” for the purposes of the respective E.O. prohibitions include:\n\nThe purchase or acquisition of real estate in the Russian Federation, other than for noncommercial, personal use;\n\nEntry into an agreement requiring the commitment of capital or other assets for the establishment or expansion of projects or operations in the Russian Federation, including the formation of joint ventures or other corporate entities in the Russian Federation;\n\nEntry into an agreement providing for the participation in royalties or ongoing profits in the Russian Federation;\n\nThe lending of funds to persons located in the Russian Federation for commercial purposes, including when such funds are intended to be used to fund a new or expanded project or operation in the Russian Federation;\n\nThe purchase of an equity interest in an entity located in the Russian Federation (see FAQs 1054 and 1055); and\n\nThe purchase or acquisition of rights to natural resources or exploitation thereof in the Russian Federation.\n\nExamples of transactions that OFAC does not consider to be “new investment” for the purposes of the respective E.O. prohibitions include:\n\nEntry into, performance of, or financing of a contract, pursuant to ordinary commercial sales terms, to sell or purchase goods, services, or technology to or from an entity in the Russian Federation (e.g., a payment of an invoice for goods, where payment is made within the contracted time period and such payment does not involve participation in royalties or ongoing profits);\n\nMaintenance of an investment in the Russian Federation, where the investment was made prior to the effective date of the respective E.O. prohibitions, including maintenance of pre-existing entities, projects, or operations, including associated tangible property, in the Russian Federation (see FAQ 1050); and\n\nWind down or divestment of a pre-existing investment, such as a pre-existing investment in an entity, project, or operation, including any associated tangible property, located in the Russian Federation (see FAQs 1053 and 1054).\n\nEven if a transaction is not a prohibited form of “new investment” pursuant to the respective E.O.s, U.S. persons engaging in the transaction must comply with all other relevant sanctions prohibitions, including those pursuant to Ukraine-/Russia-Related Sanctions Regulations and Russian Harmful Foreign Activities Sanctions Regulations (see, e.g., FAQ 415). For example, the respective E.O.s include provisions prohibiting any approval, financing, facilitation, or guarantee by a United States person, wherever located, of a transaction by a foreign person where the transaction by that foreign person would be prohibited if performed by a United States person or within the United States. For more information, see FAQ 1053.\n\nFor the purposes of the respective E.O. prohibitions, “new investment” generally excludes the maintenance of investments in the Russian Federation that were made prior to the effective dates of the respective E.O. prohibitions (“pre-existing projects or operations”). “Maintenance” of investments includes:\n\nTransactions to ensure continuity of pre-existing projects or operations located in the Russian Federation, including payments to employees, suppliers, landlords, lenders, and partners;\n\nThe preservation and upkeep of pre-existing tangible property in the Russian Federation; and\n\nActivities associated with maintaining pre-existing capital investments or equity investments.\n\nAs a general matter, “maintenance” includes all transactions ordinarily incident to performing under an agreement in effect prior to the effective date of the respective E.O. prohibitions (“pre-existing agreement”), provided that such transactions are consistent with previously established practices and support pre-existing projects or operations. However, “maintenance” does not include the expansion of pre-existing projects or operations beyond those in effect prior to the effective dates of the respective E.O. prohibitions, even if pursuant to a pre-existing agreement, where such expansion occurs on or after the effective dates of the respective E.O. prohibitions. Nor does “maintenance” include commitments pursuant to the exercise of rights under a pre-existing agreement where such commitment is made on or after the effective dates of the respective E.O. prohibitions.\n\nIn connection with maintenance activity, U.S. persons also may modify or alter pre-existing agreements, or enter into new contracts or agreements, provided that any transaction under such contracts or agreements are consistent with previously established practices and support pre-existing projects or operations. For example, a pre-existing agreement may be modified, or new contract established, to substitute suppliers, conduct maintenance or repairs, or comply with new environmental or safety standards. In assessing whether activity is consistent with past practice, the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) will consider all relevant facts and circumstances, including the transaction history between contract parties prior to the effective date of the respective E.O.s.\n\nNote that maintenance activities must not involve blocked persons or other prohibited transactions unless exempt or otherwise authorized by OFAC.\n\nYes. Transactions related to the divestment or the facilitation of divestment of a pre-existing investment in a project or operation in the Russian Federation are not prohibited by the new investment prohibitions of the respective E.O.s. Such transactions may not involve a blocked person or otherwise prohibited transactions unless exempt or authorized by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC).\n\nThe respective E.O.s prohibit any approval, financing, facilitation, or guarantee by a United States person, wherever located, of a transaction by a foreign person where the transaction by that foreign person would be prohibited if performed by a United States person or within the United States. Such provisions do not prohibit U.S. persons from facilitating the wind down or divestment of an existing investment in a project or operation in the Russian Federation. For example, a U.S. financial institution is not prohibited from advising a client that seeks to divest from a project or operation in the Russian Federation (i.e., the seller in a transaction). However, a U.S. person is prohibited from providing any approval, financing, facilitation, or guarantee to a non-U.S. person that seeks to invest in a project or operation in the Russian Federation (i.e., the buyer in such a transaction).\n\nSuch provisions also do not prohibit U.S. persons from advising on the requirements of U.S. sanctions laws consistent with OFAC’s Guidance on the Provision of Certain Services Relating to the Requirements of U.S. Sanctions Laws.\n\nFor guidance related to divestment transactions in the secondary market involving debt or equity securities issued by an entity in the Russian Federation, please see FAQ 1054.\n\nUpdated: July 22, 2022\n\nNo, provided that (i) such funds are not specifically intended for new projects or operations in the Russian Federation and (ii) the entity located outside the Russian Federation derives less than 50 percent of its revenues from its investments in the Russian Federation.\n\nFor the purposes of assessing the foregoing, U.S. persons, including U.S. financial institutions, may reasonably rely upon the information available to them in the ordinary course of business, including publicly available information such as an entity’s most recent quarterly or annual report. For the purposes of determining the percentage of revenues derived from investments in the Russian Federation, revenues derived from the commercial sale of goods or services by an entity located outside of the Russian Federation to persons in the Russian Federation should not be included. This approach is consistent with the guidance provided by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) in FAQ 1049, which clarifies that OFAC does not consider the commercial sale of goods or services to persons in the Russian Federation by an entity located outside the Russian Federation to be new investment in the Russian Federation for purposes of the respective E.O. prohibitions.\n\nUnless exempt or otherwise authorized by OFAC, examples of transactions that OFAC considers to be “new investment” for the purposes of the respective E.O. prohibitions include:\n\nThe lending of funds to a special purpose vehicle established outside of the Russian Federation by a Russian entity for the purpose of raising funds intended to support new or expanded physical operations in the Russian Federation.\n\nThe purchase (including on the secondary markets) of a debt or equity interest in an entity located outside of the Russian Federation that derives 50 percent or more of its revenues from its ownership of a subsidiary located in the Russian Federation (e.g., through dividends paid up by the Russian subsidiary to the non-Russian parent company).\n\nThe purchase (including on the secondary markets) of a debt or equity interest in an entity located outside of the Russian Federation that derives 50 percent or more of its revenues from its ownership of real estate, a mine, or other physical property located in the Russian Federation.\n\nOFAC notes, however, the new investment prohibitions of the respective E.O.s do not prohibit U.S. persons from selling or divesting debt or equity securities issued by such entities to a non-U.S. person. Moreover, U.S. financial institutions may clear and settle, or otherwise serve as market intermediaries in, such divestment transactions on the secondary market — including transactions between non-U.S. persons. For the purposes of assessing whether certain purchases of debt or equity of an entity are permissible, U.S. financial institutions, including securities exchanges and other market intermediaries and participants, may reasonably rely upon the information available to them in the ordinary course of business.\n\nExamples of transactions that OFAC does not consider to be “new investment” for the purposes of the respective E.O. prohibitions include:\n\nThe purchase (including on the secondary markets) of a debt or equity interest in an entity located outside of the Russian Federation provided that the entity derives less than 50 percent of its revenues from its ownership of a subsidiary or physical operation located in the Russian Federation.\n\nThe purchase (including on the secondary markets) of a debt or equity interest in an entity located outside of the Russian Federation whose revenue is exclusively derived from the commercial sale of goods or services to persons located in the Russian Federation.\n\nActivities that would be considered “maintenance” pursuant to FAQ 1050.\n\nDate Updated: January 17, 2023\n\nRussia-related GL 46 authorizes transactions otherwise prohibited by section (1)(a)(i) of Executive Order (E.O.) 14071 related to the establishment, administration, participation in, and execution of an auction process, as announced by the EMEA Credit Derivatives Determination Committee, to settle credit derivative transactions with a reference entity of “the Russian Federation” (“the auction”).\n\nExamples of transactions that may be related to the auction include the submission and acceptance of bids and offers and physical settlement requests by auction participants and their customers, or the delivery and acceptance of the Russian Federation debt obligations and corresponding settlement amounts.\n\nTo promote the proper functioning of such auction, GL 46 also authorizes U.S. persons to purchase or receive Russian Federation debt obligations for the period beginning two business days prior to the announced date of the auction and ending eight business days after the conclusion of the auction.\n\nGL 46 also authorizes financial institutions, among others, to facilitate, clear, and settle transactions authorized by GL 46, including the transfer to, or purchase or receipt by, U.S. persons of Russian Federation debt obligations. GL 46 does not require the clearance and settlement of such transactions to be completed within eight business days after the conclusion of the auction. For example, a purchase by a U.S. person of Russian Federation debt obligations made on the seventh business day after the conclusion of the auction does not have to be settled or cleared by the eighth business day. Accordingly, U.S. financial institutions may continue settling or clearing such transactions after the eighth business day following the conclusion of the auction.\n\nFinancial institutions processing transactions pursuant to GL 46 may reasonably rely upon the information available to them in the ordinary course of business for the purposes of assessing whether a transaction is authorized by GL 46, provided that the financial institution does not know or have reason to know that a transaction is not in compliance with GL 46.\n\nSince Russia’s further invasion of Ukraine beginning in February 2022, OFAC has blocked a number of Russian financial institutions pursuant to E.O. 14024 for operating or having operated in the financial services sector of the Russian Federation economy (see FAQ 966). In addition, all property and interests in property of any financial institution that is owned, directly or indirectly, individually or in the aggregate, 50 percent or more by one or more blocked persons are also blocked. Accordingly, U.S. persons are prohibited from transacting with these financial institutions unless the activity is exempt or authorized by OFAC.\n\nIn practice, this means that accounts held by U.S. persons at any blocked Russian financial institutions generally are themselves considered blocked property, unless exempt. This includes, for example, checking and savings accounts, credit cards, CDs, loans, and mortgages. U.S. persons must stop utilizing such accounts and treat them as blocked, even if the designated Russian financial institution does not. Additionally, within 10 business days of the blocking of the account or other property, U.S. persons are required to file a blocking report with OFAC describing any property or interests in property (e.g., accounts, etc.). Information on the requirement to report blocked property, including accounts, and on filing initial and annual reports of blocked property with OFAC can be found at FAQs 49, 50, and 646, respectively, and 31 CFR § 501.603. Please note that the annual filing requirement for 2022 applies only to persons holding blocked property as of June 30 of this year.\n\nOn August 19, 2022, OFAC issued Russia-related General License (GL) 50 authorizing individuals, wherever located, to engage in all transactions ordinarily incident and necessary to close their individual accounts held at a financial institution blocked pursuant to E.O. 14024. GL 50 also authorizes the unblocking and lump sum transfer to the account holder of all remaining funds and other assets in the account at the blocked financial institution, including to an account held at a non-blocked financial institution. Individuals may avail themselves of GL 50 to terminate their accounts with Russian financial institutions blocked pursuant to E.O. 14024 and repatriate the proceeds of any account closures. Individuals who have filed a blocking report with OFAC and are availing themselves of GL 50 must file an unblocking report with OFAC within 10 business days of the unblocking in accordance with 31 CFR § 501.603(b)(3).\n\nYes. On September 23, G7 Leaders issued a statement condemning Russia’s sham referenda and noting their collective readiness to impose further economic costs on Russia, and on individuals and entities both inside and outside of Russia that provide political or economic support for Russia’s illegal attempts to change the status of Ukrainian territory.\n\nThe United States is prepared to more aggressively use its authorities under existing U.S. sanctions programs to target such persons whose activities may constitute material assistance, sponsorship, financial, material, or technological support for, or goods or services to, or in support of (together “material support”), sanctioned persons or sanctionable activity. Particular areas of targeting focus include entities and individuals in jurisdictions outside Russia that provide political or economic support for Russia’s illegal attempt to annex Ukrainian sovereign territory. Examples of activities that could be targeted include those related to:\n\nProviding material support for the organization of Russia’s sham referenda or annexation, as well as economic or other activity that seeks to legitimize Russia’s sham referenda or annexation;\n\nProviding material support to Russia’s military and defense industrial base, including significant transactions by entities in third countries that provide material support to Russia’s military, defense industrial base, and designated entities and persons operating in Russia’s defense industrial base;\n\nAttempting to circumvent or evade U.S. sanctions on Russia and Belarus; and\n\nProviding material support to Russian entities or individuals subject to certain blocking sanctions.\n\nMultiple Executive Orders (E.O.) — including E.O.s 13660, 14024, and 14065 — authorize the imposition of blocking sanctions on categories of persons — inside or outside Russia — who provide material support for Russia following its sham referenda, purported annexation, and continued occupation of the Kherson, Zaporizhzhya, Donetsk, and Luhansk regions of Ukraine.\n\nU.S. sanctions are not designed to target Ukraine or the Ukrainian people, including those living in areas occupied or purportedly annexed by Russia. In addition, as noted in OFAC’s Fact Sheet: Preserving Agricultural Trade, Access to Communication, and Other Support to Those Impacted by Russia’s War Against Ukraine and Frequently Asked Question (FAQ) 1007, OFAC sanctions do not target transactions related to the export of food or medicine, the response to the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the official business of an international organization, or the activities of nongovernmental organizations, as well as personal remittances, telecommunications, internet services, or mail.\n\nFinally, OFAC sanctions do not prohibit transactions related to the sale of or transport of crude oil; petroleum; petroleum fuels, oils, and products of their distillation; liquefied natural gas; coal; and coal products of Russian Federation origin, aside from the importation of such products into the United States. OFAC will generally not impose sanctions on non-U.S. persons that engage in transactions that would be authorized for U.S. persons. For additional information, please see Russia-related General License (GL) 8C, FAQ 980, and FAQ 1018. OFAC has issued preliminary guidance on the planned maritime services policy and related price exception for seaborne Russian oil and intends to issue additional guidance in coming weeks.\n\nYes. Multiple Russia-related sanctions authorities authorize sanctions against non-U.S. persons that provide goods, services, or other support for Russia’s military-industrial complex. For example, OFAC may block any person determined to operate or have operated in the defense and related materiel sector of the Russian Federation economy pursuant to Executive Order (E.O.) 14024 of April 15, 2021, “Blocking Property With Respect To Specified Harmful Foreign Activities of the Government of the Russian Federation.” In addition, pursuant to E.O. 14024, OFAC may block persons determined to have materially assisted, sponsored, or provided financial, material, or technological support for, or goods or services to or in support of certain sanctionable activities enumerated in E.O. 14024 or any person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to E.O. 14024. OFAC also has robust targeting authorities pursuant to the Ukraine-/Russia-Related Sanctions Regulations (URSR), 31 C.F.R. part 589, which implement multiple authorities that could provide for the blocking of persons who engage in the provision of ammunition or other military goods to the Russian Federation, including persons determined to operate or have operated in the arms or related materiel sector of the Russian Federation economy, or those who have materially assisted, sponsored, or provided financial, material, or technological support for, or goods or services to or in support of persons blocked pursuant to the URSR.\n\nFurthermore, E.O. 14024, as amended by E.O. 14114, authorizes the imposition of sanctions on foreign financial institutions that have conducted or facilitated certain transactions involving Russia’s military-industrial base. For more information, see OFAC’s Advisory to Foreign Banks on Russia Sanctions Risks, and FAQs 1147, 1148, 1149, 1150 and 1151.\n\nOFAC is prepared to use its broad targeting authorities against non-U.S. persons that provide ammunition or other support to the Russian Federation’s military-industrial complex, as well as private military companies (PMCs) or paramilitary groups participating in or otherwise supporting the Russian Federation’s unlawful and unjustified attack on Ukraine. OFAC will continue to target Russia’s efforts to resupply its weapons and sustain its war of aggression against Ukraine, including any foreign persons who assist the Russian Federation in those efforts.\n\nOFAC and the Department of State have imposed numerous targeted sanctions on the Russian Federation’s military-industrial complex, including on State Corporation Rostec, the cornerstone of Russia’s defense-industrial base, and multiple other key firms. In addition, the Department of State has identified persons that are part of, or operate for or on behalf of, the defense and intelligence sectors of the Government of the Russian Federation pursuant to Section 231 of the Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA) (CAATSA 231 List of Specified Persons). Persons determined to knowingly engage in a significant transaction with those identified on the CAATSA 231 List of Specified Persons are subject to five or more sanctions described in Section 235 of CAATSA. The Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) has also imposed highly restrictive controls on the export and reexport of U.S.-origin and certain foreign-produced commodities, software, and technologies to the Russian Federation to cut off its access to inputs and products needed to sustain its military capabilities. For more information on the impact of sanctions and export controls on Russia’s military-industrial complex, please see “OFAC-BIS Alert: Impact of Sanctions and Export Controls on Russia’s Military-Industrial Complex,” published on October 14, 2022 and BIS’s Common High Priority Items List.\n\nDate Updated: February 23, 2024\n\nNo, provided the oil is unloaded at the port of destination prior to 12:01 a.m., eastern standard time, January 19, 2023. Crude oil of Russian Federation origin that is loaded onto a vessel at the port of loading prior to 12:01 a.m., eastern standard time, December 5, 2022, and unloaded at the port of destination prior to 12:01 a.m., eastern standard time, January 19, 2023, is not subject to the price cap (also known as the “maritime services policy”). U.S. service providers can continue to provide services related to the maritime transport of crude oil of Russian Federation origin purchased at a price above the price cap, provided that the crude oil is loaded onto a vessel at the port of loading for maritime transport prior to 12:01 a.m., eastern standard time, December 5, 2022, and unloaded at the port of destination prior to 12:01 a.m., eastern standard time, January 19, 2023.\n\nThe following is an example of a permissible transaction in line with the maritime services policy:\n\nA U.S. commodities trader signs a contract on November 1, 2022, to purchase crude oil of Russian Federation origin for shipment to a jurisdiction that has not prohibited the import of such crude oil. The U.S. commodities trader arranges for the oil to be loaded onto a vessel at the port of loading. The vessel is loaded on December 1, 2022, and a bill of lading is issued. The oil is shipped and discharged at the port of destination on December 15, 2022. U.S. insurance companies provide cover for this shipment/voyage and pay out any related claims, as appropriate.\n\nAs noted in OFAC’s preliminary guidance, OFAC anticipates implementing the maritime services policy by publishing a determination pursuant to Executive Order 14071 that (i) permits the exportation, reexportation, sale, or supply, directly or indirectly, from the United States, or by a United States person, wherever located, of services related to the maritime transport of crude oil or petroleum products of Russian Federation origin, where the price of such crude oil or petroleum products of Russian Federation origin does not exceed the price cap and (ii) prohibits such services if the crude oil or petroleum products of Russian Federation origin are purchased above the price cap. This determination would take effect at 12:01 a.m., eastern standard time, December 5, 2022, with respect to maritime transport of crude oil of Russian Federation origin loaded on or after 12:01 a.m., eastern standard time, December 5, 2022.\n\nThe Directive 4 under Executive Order (E.O.) 14024, “Prohibitions Related to Transactions Involving the Central Bank of the Russian Federation, the National Wealth Fund of the Russian Federation, and the Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation,” as amended (Russia-related Sovereign Transactions Directive), prohibits the following activities by U.S. persons: any transaction involving the Central Bank of the Russian Federation, the National Wealth Fund of the Russian Federation, or the Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation, including any transfer of assets to such entities or any foreign exchange transaction for or on behalf of such entities (collectively, “Directive 4 entities”). As noted in FAQ 1002, this includes both direct and indirect transactions.\n\nOFAC issued the Russia-related Sovereign Transactions Directive with the explicit aim of preventing the Government of the Russian Federation from leveraging these institutions and their holdings of international reserves in ways that would undermine the impact of U.S. sanctions. Information currently available to OFAC suggests so-called “exit taxes” imposed by the Government of the Russian Federation involve payments to Directive 4 entities. Consequently, U.S. persons whose divestment from the Russian Federation will involve the payment of such an exit tax require a specific license from OFAC prior to the payment of such tax, unless otherwise authorized by OFAC.\n\nGL 13E authorizes U.S. persons, or entities owned or controlled, directly or indirectly, by a U.S. person, to pay taxes, fees, or import duties, and purchase or receive permits, licenses, registrations, or certifications involving Directive 4 entities that would otherwise be prohibited by the Russia-related Sovereign Transactions Directive, provided such transactions are ordinarily incident and necessary to such persons’ day-to-day operations in the Russian Federation. Payment of exit taxes is not considered ordinarily incident and necessary to day-to-day operations in the Russian Federation and, thus, is not authorized under GL 13E.\n\nTherefore, U.S. persons whose divestment of assets in the Russian Federation will involve a payment of such an “exit tax” should seek a specific license from OFAC. Such persons may submit a request for a specific license with OFAC’s Licensing Division online at https://ofac.treasury.gov/ofac-license-application-page. License applications related to these payments should include information regarding the amount of the exit tax, the amount of ongoing taxes that would otherwise be paid to the Government of the Russian Federation should divestment not occur, the impact of a failure to pay the tax on the employees of the exiting company, the specific economic activity in Russia of the exiting company, and the impact on the Russian Federation of the divestment. OFAC will expedite its review of such requests, which will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.\n\nWhile OFAC is aware that the Commission established by the Russian Federation to review such divestments may include individuals from entities subject to the Russia-related Sovereign Transactions Directive or individuals listed on the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List, U.S. persons do not need to seek authorization from OFAC for their Russian buyers to submit an application to the Commission regarding a divestment transaction.\n\nDate Updated: May 19, 2023\n\nThe United States generally supports the free flow of information globally as facilitated by telecommunications and certain internet-based communications. Accordingly, GL 25D authorizes — with certain exceptions and exclusions — (i) all transactions ordinarily incident and necessary to the receipt or transmission of telecommunications involving the Russian Federation that are prohibited by the Russian Harmful Foreign Activities Sanctions Regulations, 31 CFR part 587 (RuHSR); (ii) the exportation or reexportation, sale, or supply from the United States or by U.S. persons, wherever located, to the Russian Federation of services that are incident to the exchange of communications over the internet and that are prohibited by the RuHSR; and (iii) the exportation or reexportation, sale, or supply from the United States or by U.S. persons, wherever located, to the Russian Federation of software, hardware, or technology incident to the exchange of communications over the internet that is authorized for export to Russia by the Department of Commerce if it is subject to the Export Administration Regulations, 15 CFR parts 730-774 (EAR), or that would be eligible for a license exception or otherwise authorized for export to Russia by the Department of Commerce if it were subject to the EAR (see FAQ 1040).\n\nHowever, certain transactions related to Megafon PAO (Megafon) or Limited Liability Company Digital Invest (Digital Invest) — which were designated by the Department of State on April 12, 2023 pursuant to Executive Order 14024 — or any entity in which Megafon or Digital Invest owns, directly or indirectly, individually or in the aggregate, a 50 percent or greater interest (collectively, “Covered Entities”), may not involve the Russian Federation, and thus, may not be authorized by GL 25D. To ensure certain transactions related to telecommunications and internet-based communications involving the Covered Entities and Tajikistan or Uzbekistan can continue, OFAC issued GL 65. GL 65 authorizes — with certain exceptions and exclusions — (i) all transactions prohibited by the RuHSR that are ordinarily incident and necessary to the receipt or transmission of telecommunications involving the Covered Entities, and involving Tajikistan or Uzbekistan or (ii) the exportation or reexportation, sale, or supply, directly or indirectly, from the United States or by U.S. persons, wherever located, to the Covered Entities of services, software, hardware, or technology incident to the exchange of communications over the internet that is prohibited by the RuHSR. Please note that GL 65 does not relieve persons from compliance with other Federal laws, such as the export licensing requirements maintained by the Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security.\n\nUpdated: June 12, 2024\n\nSection 1(a)(i) of E.O. 14024 imposes sanctions with respect to any person determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, to operate or have operated in the technology sector or the defense and related materiel sector of the Russian Federation economy, or any other sector of the Russian Federation economy as may be determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State.

The prohibition applies to such services as they relate to residential, institutional, leisure, commercial, and industrial buildings and structures; recreational areas; transportation infrastructure; land subdivisions; and not necessarily related to a new construction project. The term also includes urban planning services (i.e., land use, site selection, and servicing of land for systemic, coordinated urban development) and landscape architectural services. OFAC intends to interpret this term consistent with UN Central Product Classification (CPC) Codes 86711-86704, 86719, and 86741-86742.\n\nEngineering services include assistance, advisory, consultative, design, and recommendation services concerning engineering matters or during any phase of an engineering project. Engineering design services may be for: the construction of foundations and building structures (i.e., structural engineering); mechanical and electrical installations for buildings; the construction of civil engineering works; industrial processes and production; or other engineering designs, such as those for acoustics, vibration, traffic control systems, or prototype development for new products. The term additionally includes geotechnical, groundwater, and corrosion engineering services; integrated engineering services, such as those for transportation infrastructure or other projects; engineering-related scientific and technical consulting services, including geological, geophysical, geochemical, surface or subsurface surveying, and map making services; testing and analysis services of chemical, biological, and physical properties of materials or of integrated mechanical and electrical systems; and technical inspection services. OFAC intends to interpret this term consistent with UN CPC Codes 86721-86727, 86729, 86731-86733, 86739, 86751-86754, 86761-86764, and 86769. Additionally, OFAC does not consider maritime classification services to be subject to the prohibition, as is consistent with the OFAC Guidance on Implementation of the Price Cap Policy for Crude Oil and Petroleum Products of Russian Federation Origin.\n\nCovered metals acquisition services means warranting services for aluminum, copper, or nickel of Russian Federation origin on a global metal exchange and services to acquire aluminum, copper, or nickel of Russian Federation origin as part of the physical settlement of a derivative contract. “Warranting services” refers to issuing, registering, accepting, or acquiring a warrant or the underlying metal on a global metal exchange (i.e., a commodities exchange that provides infrastructure and services for the international trading of base metal derivatives contracts). Examples of such global metal exchanges include, but are not limited to, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, the London Metal Exchange, and the Shanghai Futures Exchange. “Warrant” means an electronic record or physical document of title to, possession of, or rights in respect of a specified lot of metal (including where such metal is held in a third country within a global metal exchange-approved warehouse). A warrant is created or issued in accordance with the rules of a global metal exchange.\n\nUpdated: June 12, 2024\n\nOFAC expects to promulgate regulations that define or interpret these terms as follows:\n\nForeign Financial Institution: As defined in subsection 11(f) of E.O. 14024, foreign financial institution means any foreign entity that is engaged in the business of accepting deposits, making, granting, transferring, holding, or brokering loans or credits, or purchasing or selling foreign exchange, securities, futures or options, or procuring purchasers and sellers thereof, as principal or agent. It includes depository institutions, banks, savings banks, money services businesses, operators of credit card systems, trust companies, insurance companies, securities brokers and dealers, futures and options brokers and dealers, forward contract and foreign exchange merchants, securities and commodities exchanges, clearing corporations, investment companies, employee benefit plans, dealers in precious metals, stones, or jewels, and holding companies, affiliates, or subsidiaries of any of the foregoing. The term does not include the international financial institutions identified in 22 U.S.C. 262r(c)(2), the International Fund for Agricultural Development, the North American Development Bank, or any other international financial institution so notified by the Office of Foreign Assets Control.\n\nRussia’s military-industrial base includes all persons blocked pursuant to E.O. 14024, as well as any person operating in the technology, defense and related materiel, construction, aerospace, and manufacturing sectors of the Russian Federation economy (and other sectors as may be determined pursuant to E.O. 14024). For definitions of those identified sectors, see FAQ 1126. Russia’s military-industrial base may also include individuals and entities that support the sale, supply, or transfer, directly or indirectly, of critical items identified in determinations pursuant to subsection 11(a)(ii) of E.O. 14024, to the Russian Federation. See determination of December 22, 2023 pursuant to subsection 11(a)(ii) of Executive Order 14024 (Russia Critical Items Determination). See also FAQ 1150 for additional information.\n\nSignificant transaction or transactions: OFAC may consider the totality of the facts and circumstances when determining whether a transaction or transactions are “significant.” As a general matter, some or all of the following factors may be considered: (a) the size, number, and frequency of the transaction(s); (b) the nature of the transaction(s); (c) the level of awareness of management and whether the transactions are part of a pattern of conduct; (d) the nexus of the transaction(s) to persons sanctioned pursuant to E.O. 14024, or to persons operating in Russia’s military-industrial base; (e) whether the transaction(s) involve deceptive practices; (f) the impact of the transaction(s) on U.S. national security objectives; and (g) such other relevant factors that OFAC deems relevant.\n\nUpdated: June 12, 2024\n\nOn December 6, 2023, and February 24, 2024, the G7 Leaders issued statements signaling their intent to reduce Russia’s revenues from metals. On April 12, 2024, in coordination with the United Kingdom, the United States issued two new prohibitions that will further disrupt the revenue that Russia earns from its export of aluminum, copper, and nickel of Russian Federation origin, including through the use of U.S. global metal exchanges.\n\nTo implement this action, Treasury issued two determinations. The first, “Prohibitions Related to Imports of Aluminum, Copper, and Nickel of Russian Federation Origin” (the “Metals Import Determination”) pursuant to Executive Order (E.O.) 14068, as amended by E.O. 14114, prohibits the importation and entry into the United States, including importation for admission into a foreign trade zone located in the United States, of aluminum, copper, and nickel of Russian Federation origin. Per the determination, the importation into the United States of aluminum, copper, and nickel of Russian Federation origin that was produced prior to April 13, 2024 is not prohibited. See FAQ 1019 and 1170 for more information.\n\nThe second, “Prohibitions on Certain Services for the Acquisition of Aluminum, Copper, or Nickel of Russian Federation Origin” (the “Metals Services Determination”) pursuant to E.O. 14071, prohibits the exportation, reexportation, sale, or supply, directly or indirectly, from the United States, or by a United States person, wherever located, of the following categories of services to any person located in the Russian Federation: warranting services for aluminum, copper, or nickel of Russian Federation origin on a global metal exchange; and services to acquire aluminum, copper, or nickel of Russian Federation origin, as part of the physical settlement of a derivative contract (collectively, “Covered Metals Acquisition Services”). This determination does not apply to services related to aluminum, copper, or nickel of Russian Federation origin that was produced prior to April 13, 2024. See FAQs 1169, 1170, 1128, 1019, and FAQ 1058 for more information.\n\nThe Metals Services Determination prohibits the exportation, reexportation, sale, or supply, directly or indirectly, from the United States, or by a United States person, wherever located, of the following categories of services to any person located in the Russian Federation: warranting services for aluminum, copper, or nickel of Russian Federation origin on a global metal exchange; and services to acquire aluminum, copper, or nickel of Russian Federation origin as part of the physical settlement of a derivative contract (collectively, “Covered Metals Acquisition Services”). This determination does not apply to services related to aluminum, copper, or nickel of Russian Federation origin that was produced prior to April 13, 2024.\n\nTo ensure compliance with the Metals Services Determination, U.S. global metal exchanges should not accept aluminum, copper, or nickel of Russian Federation origin produced on or after April 13, 2024 (“covered Russian metals”). U.S. global metal exchanges can further comply with the Metal Services Determination by halting the warranting of covered Russian metals on the exchange; removing brands that produce covered Russian metals from their list of accepted brands; abstaining from adding additional brands of covered Russian metals to their list of accepted brands; ceasing providing clearing services for covered Russian metals; and halting acting as a central counterparty to the trade of covered Russian metals.\n\nU.S. persons are also prohibited from providing services to acquire covered Russian metals as part of a physically settled derivative contract (i.e., the expiration of the contract results in a transfer of ownership of the physical commodity, as opposed to a cash settled derivatives contract in which the derivative expires directly into cash on the maturity date of the trade). In addition, a U.S. trader that is a counterparty to a derivative contract cannot take physical delivery of covered Russian metals when it comes time to settle that contract, even if the importation of the metal would not be into the United States.\n\nAs noted above, the Metals Services Determination does not impose any prohibitions on services related to aluminum, copper, or nickel of Russian Federation origin that was produced prior to April 13, 2024. For example, aluminum, copper, and nickel of Russian Federation origin that is already warranted as of April 13, 2024 on a global metal exchange can continue to be traded, and new warranting and trading can continue for aluminum, copper, and nickel of Russian Federation origin that was produced prior to April 13, 2024, including through new derivatives contracts. Market participants and traders may reasonably rely on the Certificate of Analysis and Certificate of Origin of the relevant Russian metal, or other documentation available to them in the ordinary course of business, with respect to the date of production, but should exercise caution if they have reason to believe such documentation has been falsified or is otherwise erroneous.\n\nOn June 12, 2024, OFAC issued Russia-related general licenses (GLs) GL 99, GL 100, and amended GL 8J, authorizing certain transactions involving MOEX, NCC, NSD, or any entity in which one of these entities owns, directly or indirectly, individually or in the aggregate, a 50 percent or greater interest (collectively, “the Blocked Entities”).\n\nGL 99 authorizes the wind down of transactions involving the Blocked Entities, as well as certain transactions related to the divestment to non-U.S. persons of debt or equity issued or guaranteed by, or derivative contracts involving, the Blocked Entities. For example, GL 99 would authorize a U.S. person to divest their equity in MOEX to a non-blocked non-U.S. person. This authorization expires at 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time August 13, 2024. See GL 99 for more information.\n\nGL 100 authorizes certain transactions for the divestment to non-blocked, non-U.S. persons of debt or equity, or for the conversion of currencies, involving one or more of the Blocked Entities solely as a securities, trade, or settlement depository, central counterparty or clearing house, or public trading market. GL 100 is intended to cover the divestment of debt or equity of non-blocked companies that may be traded on or through one of the Blocked Entities in their capacity as a securities, trade, or settlement depository, central counterparty or clearing house, or public trading market. For example, GL 100 would authorize a U.S. person to divest their equity in a non-blocked Russian company that is being traded on MOEX to a non-blocked, non-U.S. person. This example would be distinct from the divestment of equity in MOEX itself, which would be covered by GL 99. GL 100 would also authorize U.S. persons to transact with one of the Blocked Entities to the extent ordinarily incident and necessary to convert U.S. dollars to another currency, or vice versa. This authorization expires at 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time August 13, 2024. See GL 100 for more information.\n\nGL 8J authorizes certain transactions related to energy involving NCC. See FAQ 976 for more information.\n\nIn line with G7 efforts to disrupt Russia’s defense industry’s reliance on western IT systems, on June 12, 2024, Treasury issued a determination that restricts the provision of certain IT and software-related services to Russia. The determination, “Prohibition on Certain Information Technology and Software Services,” issued pursuant to Executive Order (E.O.) 14071 (the “IT and Software Services Determination”), prohibits the exportation, reexportation, sale, or supply, directly or indirectly, from the United States, or by a United States person, wherever located, to any person located in the Russian Federation of: (1) IT consultancy and design services; and (2) IT support services and cloud-based services for the following categories of software: enterprise management software and design and manufacturing software (collectively, “Covered Software”). The IT and Software Services Determination will take effect at 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on September 12, 2024. See FAQs 1185, 1186, 1187, and 1188 for additional information.\n\nThe aim of this action is not to prohibit all activity relating to the provision of IT and software-related services to Russia. The United States strongly supports the free flow of information and communications globally as facilitated by telecommunications and the internet. These measures do not prohibit internet access or the delivery of internet-based communications services. Treasury already has in place General License (GL) 25D, which authorizes certain transactions ordinarily incident and necessary to the receipt or transmission of telecommunications involving the Russian Federation and the provision of certain services incident to the exchange of communications over the internet, subject to certain restrictions. For additional information, see FAQ 1040. Treasury has also amended GL 6D to authorize transactions related to certain agricultural and medical activities involving the provision of information technology and software-related services. Additionally, the importation from any country, or the exportation to any country of any information or informational materials, regardless of format or medium, is generally exempt from the scope of sanctions prohibitions under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. See 50. U.S.C. § 1702(b)(3).\n\nIn addition, the IT and Software Services Determination does not prohibit the following IT and software services, which are excluded from its scope: (1) any service to an entity located in the Russian Federation that is owned or controlled, directly or indirectly, by a United States person; (2) any service in connection with the wind down or divestiture of an entity located in the Russian Federation that is not owned or controlled, directly or indirectly, by a Russian person; and (3) any service for software that would be eligible for a license exception or otherwise authorized for export or reexport to Russia by the Department of Commerce.\n\nThe IT and Software Services Determination prohibits the exportation, reexportation, sale, or supply, directly or indirectly, from the United States, or by a United States person, wherever located, of both IT support services and cloud-based services for the Covered Software to a person located in the Russian Federation. IT support services include the provision of technical expertise to solve problems for the client in using software, hardware, or an entire computer system. Cloud-based services include the supply of software and associated services via the internet or the cloud, including through Software-as-a-Service (SaaS). See FAQ 1187 for more information on how OFAC intends to define “enterprise management software,” “design and manufacturing software,” “cloud-based services,” and “information technology support services.”\n\nThe following are examples of activities that would be prohibited by the IT and Software Services Determination if such services were provided to a company located in the Russian Federation that is not owned or controlled directly or indirectly by a U.S. person (Russian company):\n\nA U.S. company sells a cloud-based enterprise resource planning software subscription to a Russian company.\n\nA U.S. employee of a third country company provides customer support services to a Russian company that is experiencing technical difficulties with its human resources software.\n\nA U.S. company provides a software patch to a Russian company to fix a bug in its computer-aided design software.\n\nThe following are examples of activities that would not be prohibited by the IT and Software Services Determination:\n\nA U.S. company sells a cloud-based electronic health records software subscription to a Russian company.\n\nA U.S. company provides customer support services to a Russian individual who is experiencing technical difficulties with their publicly available cloud-based spreadsheet web application.\n\nA U.S. person working at a third country company provides customer support services to a Russian individual who is experiencing technical difficulties with their free-of-charge publicly available teleconferencing application.\n\nA U.S. company provides IT support services to a Russian individual to a non-covered software application.\n\nThe IT and Software Services Determination compl"
