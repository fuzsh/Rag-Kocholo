        "text": "100% start for Jong AZ\n\nJong AZ maintained their perfect start to the season with a 1-0 away win at VVV Venlo.\n\nIn quite an even game with chances at both ends, Fedde de Jong scored the only goal of the game in the 72nd minute, receiving the ball from a cut back by Yusuf Barasi and rifling a shot into the net from close range after taking a touch.\n\nThe hosts pushed for an equaliser and went close when Sem Westerveld spilled a shot but managed to recover before the rebound was tapped in.\n\nIt was the fourth win from four for Maarten Martens’ side, while VVV have just one win from their first four games.\n\nFC Oss and De Graafschap are three points behind the leaders after they beat Dordecht 3-0 and FC Emmen 2-0 respectively.\n\nSeven goal thriller at Roda\n\nThe most thrilling match of the weekend took place between Roda JC and Almere City where Jonas Arweiler scored a dramatic stoppage time winner to snatch a late 4-3 win for Almere.\n\nMaarten Pouwels gave the visitors the lead after seven minutes with a low drive that cannoned in off the post.\n\nPatrick Pflücke scored a dipping screamer from 30 yards out to put Roda level midway through the first half.\n\nJust over two minutes later, a mistake from Amir Absalem was capitalized by Bradly van Hoeven who volleyed into the net to give Almere the lead for the second time.\n\nIn an end-to-end match, Denzel Jubitana then struck the post with a brilliant curling effort.\n\nXian Emmers ran onto a through ball to slot home in the 64th minute and equalise for Roda.\n\nThe game took another drastic turn when a penalty was given to Roda for handball from a free kick.\n\nDylan Vente sent the goalkeeper the wrong way to put Roda in front after 73 minutes.\n\nBut with just under seven minutes remaining, there was time for more drama.\n\nJeffrey Germain Puriel’s cross was not dealt with by Rody de Boer and after a header was cleared off the line, Ramon Leeuwin managed to force his header over the line to equalise.\n\nTo fit the narrative of an incredible match, Almere scored a dramatic late winner. Germain Puriel’s shot fortuitously fell into the path of a forward who crossed for Jonas Arweiler to tap home."
