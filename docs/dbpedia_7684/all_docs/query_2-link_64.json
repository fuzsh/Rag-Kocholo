        "text": "In Netherlands, some Eredivisie clubs have a B team/reserves team that takes part of the Eerste Divisie games, although those reserves can't win promotion.\n\nI know that players over 18 yo would need competitive football to develop properly, so sensible thing to do would be to start looking for loan options if they've hit that age. However, in big clubs (such as Ajax) training facilities and coaching quality is far superior to any other Dutch club. And if the youngster is half-decent, most commonly Eerste Divisie clubs are interested, so they'd move to the same league that he played in Jong Ajax, just with worse training conditions.\n\nMy first question - do Eerste Divisie games that reserves play count as \"first team football\" in terms of player development?\n\nSecond question - what loan criteria should be met while deciding on loan? How good should training facilities be compared to my club or would it matter less than I think?\n\nTo be honest, having a B club in a competitive league, especially countries such as the Netherlands or Spain where the B quad can reach the second division, is a huge advantage in FM for youth development. Your club has likely better facilities and coaching than clubs in the same league as your B squad, and you can keep a tighter leash on how the youngsters train; especially since the AI isn't particularly good at developing youth at all. I wouldn't loan out the kids unless they require football at a higher standard than what your B team requires, but you cannot feasibly make the player part of the rotation of the main squad.\n\nSince you're Ajax, and having played in the Netherlands myself, there probably are some opportunities for you to play the kid in some matches and give him a dozen or plus appearances in the first team on top of his playing time in the B squad. Beyond that and as I said, only look for loan moves in clubs that 1) promise a Regular Starter status or better, 2) have decent enough facilities, 3) provide a higher standard of football than you can provide the kid with. But indeed, there's more often than not no point at all in loaning a player to a team in the same league as your B squad.\n\nWell, there can be a reason to loan anyway: the player is in the shadow of another in the B squad who is better. The AI coaches won't rotate both players properly, and I suggest you keep your Youth squads as slim as possible: 11 players is good enough if you strictly have one per position. Loan away, sell or release the rest: they're not going to see much action because bar catastrophic injuries, they're not going to see much action on the pitch. You can handle having a position filled by a grey player if there's an injury happen, and worst case scenario, you can still send a main squad player looking for match sharpness to the Youth squad for a match or two."
