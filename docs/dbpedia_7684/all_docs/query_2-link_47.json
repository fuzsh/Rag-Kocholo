        "text": "Roda JC fans might need to work on timing their celebrations.\n\nSupporters streamed onto the pitch at Parkstad Limburg Stadion after two second-half goals gave Roda a 2-0 win over Cambuur in the Dutch second division on Friday.\n\nFans twirled yellow scarves, ran in jubilation, and generally delighted in Roda’s climb out of the Eerste Divisie and into the top flight.\n\nJust one problem: Roda had not clinched promotion yet.\n\nDe Koempels had hit full time, but elsewhere in Eerste Divisie play, Groningen trailed its away match against Telstar. A Groningen loss would do the job for Roda, and at full time it seemed like that was going to happen.\n\nHowever, Thom van Bergen’s 95th-minute equalizer gave life to Groningen’s hopes of bouncing right back into the Eredivisie. To add to the drama, Telstar would go on to put the ball in the back of the net afterwards, only for the goal to be chalked off.\n\nIn an interview with Voetbal International, stadium announcer Wim Frijns put his hand up, saying that he had conveyed some incorrect information to fans at what turned out to be an awkward moment.\n\n“It started with supporters entering the field,” explained Frijns, who said he announced that Telstar and Groningen were still playing.\n\nStill, per Frijns everyone was ready to party. Fans clustered in one corner, ready to get out on the field, while players returned from the locker room to join the revelry.\n\n“Someone said to me, ‘Telstar has scored a goal,'” said Frijns. “People were crying next to me, players came out, everyone was celebrating. So I thought: it must be so.”\n\nFrijns got on the mic and announced the Telstar goal. Cue the scenes:\n\n“A little later I heard that the goal had been disallowed,” admitted Frijns.\n\nMuch to the chagrin of Roda fans, the results mean that there’s still work to do. Fortunately, this one isn’t too complicated, and all parties should have no trouble sorting out whether to party or not at full time.\n\nYou see, Roda is at Groningen on May 10, and the situation is very simple. Roda will be promoted — for real this time — with a win or a draw. A positive result could also see Roda win the league outright, as the club trails Willem II by a single point.\n\nHowever, should Groningen win, it’ll be Groningen fans wilding out instead. A win would get Groningen level with Roda on points, and since the former holds a two-goal edge on goal difference (the first tiebreaker in the Eerste Divisie), that would seal promotion for the hosts.\n\nIt’s just important for all parties to be absolutely sure the game is really, actually over before getting the champagne out."
