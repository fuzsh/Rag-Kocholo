To me it would seem that counter intuitive to have 'best placed' sides compete for relegation play-offs.\n\nCan anyone help explain to me what these crazy Dutch are up too?\n\nSpoiler\n\nQuote\n\nAt the end of each season, the champion of the Eerste Divisie is automatically promoted to the Eredivisie. Eight other clubs enter the Nacompetitie [ˈnaː.kɔm.pə.ˌti.(t)si], a promotion/relegation playoff that includes the 16th- and 17th-place clubs in the Eredivisie. The following teams qualify for the Nacompetitie:\n\nThe club with the best record in the \"first period\" of the season (after 8 rounds).\n\nThe club with the best record in the \"second period\" of the season (rounds 9–16).\n\nThe club with the best record in the \"third period\" of the season (rounds 17–24).\n\nThe club with the best record in the \"fourth period\" of the season (rounds 25–32).\n\nThe two remaining spots are filled at the season's end by the highest-placed clubs that have not already earned automatic promotion or qualified for the Nacompetitie.\n\nIf the club that wins a period has qualified for the Nacompetitie by winning a previous period, its place is filled by the next-best club in that period that has not already qualified. Usually, the clubs that qualify for the Nacompetitie turn out to be the 2nd- through 9th-placed clubs in the final table. Clubs in the Nacompetitie face each other in a knock-out system with the numbers 16 and 17 of the Eredivisie for two places in next season's Eredivisie.\n\n3 hours ago, BrianMunich said:\n\nSo, strangely enough, as the title may suggest, I'm managing in the Dutch Eerste Divisie...\n\nUpon wondering what the blue highlights all over the league table were, I took a look on Wiki to see if there was a top 6 split type thing going on, and come across this Nacompetitie part which I can't say I fully understand. To me it would seem that counter intuitive to have 'best placed' sides compete for relegation play-offs.\n\nCan anyone help explain to me what these crazy Dutch are up too?\n\nIt doesn't help that there's a mistake in the Wikipedia page! There are actually 10 teams that take place in the Promotion/Relegation Play-offs. The selection rules you found are correct except for the final point when it's actually the next 4 teams who take part, not the next 2.\n\nEasiest way to make sense of it is probably to look at a real life example, so we'll take the 2016/17 season.\n\n2016/17 Eredivisie\n\n2016/17 Eerste Divisie\n\n2016/17 Play-offs\n\nOpen up those three links and we'll take it from there working through the selection rules you posted.\n\nThe 1st and 3rd period were won by the league winners, and as a result of the league winners being automatically promoted we obviously cannot choose them for the play-offs. Instead these two spots are treated like the final category, they are given to the next best placed teams in the league who have not already qualified for the play-offs.\n\nHelmond Sport and Cambuur receive places for winning the 2nd and 4th period respectively.\n\nThe next 4 places, plus the two carried over from above, go to the next highest ranked teams. If we go back up to the league table. Youth teams cannot be promoted so Jong Ajax and Jong PSV cannot take place in the play-offs. So looking at the table we skip the champions, then Jong Ajax, then Cambuur who have already qualified for the play-offs, then Jong PSV, so the next team to get picked is NAC Breda in 5th place. We continue working down the table until we've filled all of the places.\n\nOnce the teams have been chosen some of them start in the 1st round and some of them in the 2nd. How this works is pretty simple. 4 teams start in the 1st round and they are the 4 lowest ranked selected teams in the Eerste Divisie.\n\nThe play-offs then proceed as you would expect them to, the same way every other play-off everywhere in the world works with the exception being that they essentially stop after the semi-finals, so rather than having 1 winner you have 2 winners. These 2 winners are the teams who will be in the Eredivisie next season.\n\nSo for last season you'll see that the two teams from the Eredivisie who are in the play-offs are Roda JC and NEC, if they make it through the play-offs and win their final match then they will stay in the Eredivisie next year, if they lose however they will be relegated.\n\nNow last year you can see that Roda JC won their final against MVV while NEC lost against NAC. So in this case Roda JC avoided being relegated and NAC got promoted.\n\nChrist, it's a system I know quite well and even attempting to explain it simply it's still complicated as all hell!"
