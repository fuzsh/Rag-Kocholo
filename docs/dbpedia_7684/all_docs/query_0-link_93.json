        "text": "üìè Form Guide\n\nDe Graafschap\n\nDWDLLD\n\nDe Graafschap go into this game following on from a 2-2 Eerste Divisie Play-offs draw against ADO Den Haag.\n\nFor De Graafschap, the goalscorers were Ralf Seuntjens (67') and Jeffry Fortes (74'). Alex Schalk (22', 36') was the scorer for ADO Den Haag.\n\nIt has been seldom in recent times that De Graafschap have kept a clean sheet. The reality is that De Graafschap have been scored against in 5 of their previous 6 games, giving up 10 goals in the process. That pattern won‚Äôt necessarily be continued into this game, of course.\n\nFC Volendam\n\nWLLLLL üîª\n\nAfter being beaten in their last game against Go Ahead Eagles in Eredivisie competition, FC Volendam and their fans will hope to get a better result this time.\n\nIn that match, FC Volendam had 46% possession and 14 shots on goal with 4 on target. The only player on the scoresheet for FC Volendam was Luke Le Roux (45'). For their opponents, Go Ahead Eagles had 21 shots at goal with 11 on target. Philippe Rommens (16') and Enric Llansana (88') scored for Go Ahead Eagles.\n\nThe numbers tell their own story, and FC Volendam have been scored against in 6 of their last 6 games, seeing opposing sides hit 20 goals in all. At the back, FC Volendam have been far from perfect.\n\nü§úü§õ Head to head\n\nLooking at their most recent head to head clashes going back to 23/08/2019 shows us that De Graafschap have won 2 of these games and FC Volendam 3, with the number of drawn matches being 1.\n\nThose games weren‚Äôt short on goals, either, with 28 in all at an average of 4.67 goals per match.\n\nThe last league fixture between these sides was Eerste Divisie match day 34 on 08/04/2022 which finished with the scoreline of FC Volendam 3-1 De Graafschap.\n\nIn that match, FC Volendam managed 41% possession and 11 shots at goal with 4 on target. The scorers were Robert M√ºhren (13'), Daryl van Mieghem (54') and Koen Blommestijn (95').\n\nDe Graafschap had 13 attempts on goal with 5 of them on target. Mees Kaandorp (23') scored.\n\nThe match was refereed by Martin van den Kerkhof.\n\n‚ÑπÔ∏è Team News: De Graafschap\n\nAvailability isn‚Äôt a big problem, with just the lone fitness concern for the De Graafschap manager Jan Vreman to be concerned with thanks to an otherwise robust group of players. Simon Colyn (Cruciate ligament surgery) misses out.\n\nüì∞ Team News: FC Volendam\n\nThanks to a largely available group of players, there is only the sole fitness worry for the FC Volendam boss Rick Kruys to contend with. Robin Maulun (unknown injury) won‚Äôt be playing here.\n\n‚ö° Prediction\n\nIn our view, De Graafschap will probably dominate possession and create several successful chances.\n\nConversely, FC Volendam won‚Äôt find it easy to score a goal of their own although we do reckon that they could well end up scoring as well.\n\nOur selection here is for a pretty comfortable 3-1 winning score for De Graafschap at the conclusion of the game.\n\nOur expert partners are tipping over 1.5 goals for this match. Check out their VIP predictions here.\n\nVictor Martins, 14:06 11/08/2024\n\nOdds correct at time of publishing. All odds subject to change."
