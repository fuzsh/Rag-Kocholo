        "text": "With the first season ending in disappointment, I set about revamping the squad ready for the next assault on the Eerste Divisie. I had settled on the general 4-3-3/4-5-1 shape for the side, but was a little uncertain about where to take the team. On the one hand, I considered modifying the attacking approach I’d adopted so far, and turning the team into a high intensity pressing side aiming to pin opponents into their own defensive third. However, I was skeptical of my players’ physical capacity to sustain such an approach and also felt that the pace in my squad was at the wrong end of the pitch for this system. I’d be leaving acres of space behind slow centre-backs, while giving my pacy wingers nowhere to run into.\n\nAt the other extreme, I considered scrapping the attacking approach completely and going very defensive. This was inspired by Cleon’s posts on defensive football on his excellent website and by the demonstration in Chris Anderson and David Sally’s ‘The Numbers Game’ that a clean sheet is worth a lot more in terms of points than a goal. My problem with this idea though is that I’m not sure I can successfully implement a defensive approach because what I ask it to do and what I want to see on the pitch (viewing through a fan’s eyes) are not always the same thing.\n\nIn the end, I have leaned towards the defensive side of things. Part of the reasoning behind this is that I am intending to get Volendam promoted, and the gap between us and the Eredivisie sides is quite significant. Therefore, I can’t expect to be able to play a gung-ho attacking tactic and not be ruthlessly exposed at both ends of the pitch. (I doubt that Brandley Kuwas’s pace alone will be enough to ensure he prospers against more intelligent defences…) I need to set my team up to play a system that prioritises clean sheets and thus increases the value of each goal we score. I don’t want to embark on a season in the Eredivisie trying to adapt my squad and players to a new system.\n\nThe tactics\n\nRather than switching the mentality straight from Attacking to Defensive, I thought I would try a Standard approach, with the idea being that the team would be more cautious than with the Attacking mentality, but hopfully would not lose too much going forward. It would also allow me to defend higher up the pitch than with the defensive mentality, while also keeping some space behind the opposition for my pacier players to run into. I’m aiming for a ‘medium block’ and an energetic but not exhausting pressing scheme. For the moment, I will be leaving the roles as they are, but I have considered switching my striker to a Defensive Forward to see how that affects things. The biggest changes will come with the team instructions. Gone will be the high tempo, direct passing game. In its place will come a lower-tempo, patient, possession based approach, heavily influenced by some of my summer recruits.\n\nThe summer transfers\n\nHaving lost out in the play-offs in season one due to losing my first-choice midfield as the season took its toll on the squad, I decided that this was the key area to strengthen.\n\nFirst of all, I sold Kevin Wattamaleo for €600,000. He’d been injury prone and the money was too good to turn down. I’ve decided to aim for transfer profit every summer. For those incoming, I targetted free transfers and loans to keep the expenditure down. I’ve made a point of offering one-year contracts with clauses which allow me to extend the contract without negotiating, either at the click of a button or after a certain number of games. This allows me flexibility with the squad without the risk of losing key players on free transfers at the end of a good season.\n\n(At this juncture, I should point out that these screenshots were taken at the end of the season, which will give away something of the way the season went…)\n\nIncoming were:\n\nWim De Decker, to provide experience and quality at the base of my midfield. I particularly liked his Determination, Leadership and Vision.\n\nSean Klaiber, on loan from FC Utrect. His all-round mental and physical stats looked good and he could tackle and pass.\n\nHenk Bos, a winger from Groningen, brought in to provide competition for Kuwas and Ludcinio Marengo\n\nDion Watson from Fortuna Sittard. After losing Henk Veerman mid-season I needed more cover up front, a fact that was made more pressing when Kevin Brands declined to renew his loan contract. Guyon Phillips did extend his, and I also signed Kevin van Kippersluis as backup (a decision I regretted in the long term).\n\nI also brought in a striker, Johan Plat who quickly revealed himself to be surplus to my requirements, along with Pete Jungschlager as cover for the creative midfield role and Bas Kuipers on loan from Ajax as competition at centre-back.\n\nThe Results – first half of the season\n\nThe season started pretty well, and I was up near the top of the table throughout the season. Defensively, things were improving as five consecutive clean sheets at the start demonstrates. Points kept coming with decent unbeaten runs but I still felt the team was lacking something so dived back into the transfer market.\n\nThe mid-season transfers\n\nAt this point I made three transfers which I think will stand the club in good stead for the future. First, I brought in an ageing Leon Osman to provide real creative quality in midfield. At 34 he isn’t one for the future and his physical attributes are in decline, but his mental and technical attributes are excellent for our level.\n\nThen, to cover the injured Guyon Phillips, I brought in Will Keane on a free:\n\nAnother excellent player for our level, and as you can see from the screenshot, he slotted in well.\n\nFinally, I brought in Abdoul Karim Sylla, also a striker, but rapidly retrained him as cover for Marengo on the left. Marengo had been struggling with injuries much more this season and I wanted someone with pace and finishing skills to fill in.\n\nThe Results – second half of the season\n\nThe second ‘half’ of the season was even more successful, with only two defeats and three draws in sixteen games, which left me top of the table by a point heading in to the final match, and a nervy 1-0 win brought me the Eerste Divisie title and promotion to the Eredivisie.\n\nObjective achieved! Now to retain my Eredivisie status and hopefully establish the club as a mid-table side whilst I upgrade the infrastructure. On that note, a planned expansion to the training facilities was cancelled after I signed Osman, Keane and Sylla as I invested a large amount on their wages. I’m hoping to get enough from promotion to restart that and develop the club off the field as much as on it.\n\nKuwas-watch!\n\nAn even better season for the so-bad-he’s-good winger, averaging 7.26 and contributing to a higher number of goals.\n\nJust a quick word of warning, this is going to be quite a long post…\n\nAs you may have read by now, I’ve decided to pause my Roma save and move on to a new one in the Netherlands. I wanted a new challenge most of all. Roma are a great club to manage, but when taking over a club near the top of their domestic pyramid there is virtually nowhere to take them. (I’m also the kind of guy who keeps an eye on his Steam achievements and so I was never going to get Roma promoted to earn ‘You’re Up!’ since that would involve me taking them down to Serie B in the first place.)\n\nThe Club\n\nI’ve opted to take control of FC Volendam. There are a number of reasons behind this, some stranger than others. The main one is that I had a brief save with Volendam on FM14, and so I have a small degree of familiarity with the squad. However, I also fancied managing a team sporting different colours from the usual range of reds, blues and whites, and opted against ADO Den Haag, Vitesse Arnhem and SC Cambuur because of their Eredivisie status. Finally, to seal the deal, I read a very interesting blog, Budget Airline Football, which mentioned that Volendam exist in the curious state of having no rivals, nor any antipathy towards Ajax. One of the things I find tiresome about football is the pantomime rivalry which rears its head on a regular basis, and its FM equivalent is equally dull – fans “devastated” by a narrow 2-1 defeat or similar – so to find a club without these distractions was a great place to start.\n\nThe League (and a quick guide to the Eerste Divisie)\n\nThe Eerste Divisie (or Jupiler League – I may well switch back and forth between the two names) is comprised of 20 teams, all described as professional, but most containing some amateurs too. Also included are the youth teams of Ajax, PSV and Twente who are excluded from the promotion race. On the subject of promotion, the team finishing top are promoted automatically and another eight teams take part in the play-offs at the end of the season. This isn’t simply the teams who finish from 2nd to 9th – instead there are four ‘Periods’ of seven matches, and the team finishing top of that seven match mini-league qualifies regardless of where they finish in the league. Should they finish outside the top nine, then the four highest-placed sides who haven’t already qualified for the play-offs are in.\n\nThe tactics\n\nTo be honest, nothing majorly new here. The squad is set up for a 4-3-3, and after fiddling around with 4-2-3-1, 4-1-4-1, 4-4-1-1 variations, I came to the conclusion that I should stop trying to be different for the sake of it and embrace the traditional Dutch style.\n\nThe system ended up as something very, very close to my Roma tactic with a couple of small differences. Instead of focusing on possession, I asked the side to play direct football, figuring that as they were less technically gifted it might be easier for them to dawdle on the ball less, and also I guessed that shifting the ball over larger distances might catch less capable defences out. I didn’t tell them to roam from positions as I thought that their weaker mental attributes might cause them to leave gaps in the team that the better players at Roma wouldn’t have left.\n\nI also asked them to play attacking football – I’m turning into Harry Redknapp – reasoning that we had decent attackers and so a score-one-more-than-you policy could bring rewards.\n\nIdeally, I would like to implement something more distinctive. I toyed with a 3-5-2 (inspired by Louis Van Gaal’s World Cup side), but lacking a quality creative no. 10, and possessing three good wingers meant this idea went out the window. I also (briefly) experimented with a 4-2-3-1 purely because I wanted to try out the Shadow Striker role, but I didn’t like the way the two defensive midfielders and the two centre-backs formed a square rather than a triangle, so I soon moved back to using one defensive midfielder. I also found that using Inside Forwards, a Shadow Striker and a Deep Lying Forward meant that my front four tended to converge on the same spot. This is something I will work on as transfers modify my squad, but for now I am sticking with the 4-3-3.\n\nThe transfers\n\nFinances are tight, so I anticipate that the general trend at first will be for the incoming players to be on loan or free transfers and one or two first-team players to be sold for fees. The first season illustrates this perfectly – I exploited my link with Ajax to sign Jairo Riedewald, Riechedly Bazoer and Anwar El Ghazi on loan in the summer and sold Henk Veerman to Sparta Rotterdam for a fee rising to 1.1m Euros in January. Aside from that, the squad stayed exactly as it was from the start.\n\nAll three loans played their part, with El Ghazi coming to prominence in the second half of the season, and Bazoer a key part of the side. Riedewald was missing with injury for a couple of months early on, but became a first-choice centre-back towards the end of the season.\n\nVeerman’s departure was probably the only regret I had from the first season (apart from missing out on promotion!) as I felt my attack was a little less potent after his departure. The player in the Deep Lying Forward role was certainly less successful.\n\nThe results\n\nThe season went pretty well, with the only slump of any sort coming in period 3 of the league. In the end, I finished a mere 5 points behind the eventual champions, De Graafschap, who had a fantastic season in which they completed an unlikely double, beating ADO Den Haag in the KNVB Beker final.\n\nI then faced FC Eindhoven in the promotion play-offs, and let a 1-0 lead from the away leg slip, losing 2-0 at home in the second leg to bring my season to an anticlimactic end. The main reason for the defeat was the fact that I had lost almost my entire central midfield to injury at this point and I was unable to take control of the game.\n\nDespite having the third best defence in the Jupiler League over the normal season, I still felt as though I conceded too many goals. I think that defending has deteriorated in FM since the post-January patch, but I digress, and it should affect the AI as much as it affects me. This may influence the course my save takes from season 2 onwards.\n\nFinally, When Bad Players Play Well!\n\nMeet Brandley Kuwas. By all possible measurements, he is a poor player. Normally, I wouldn’t pick this guy for a reserve team friendly, and yet look at his form over the first part of the season.\n\nThe Eerste Divisie is somewhere about lower-end Championship standard, and yet here we are with a guy with those attributes scoring for fun! This is something I find really hard to explain with FM. I can see that Kuwas has lightning pace, but there is very little else going for him. In fact, I would normally make a point of trying to offload someone with attributes as low as his, and yet here he is running rings around my opponents, keeping the far better-rated Anwar El-Ghazi out of the side for the first few weeks of the season. Players like him make me a little nervous, simply because I am constantly waiting for the moment at which they are found out and their performances revert to the mean and I’m left with a complete donkey on my hands. Therefore, as soon as a decent bid comes in for Kuwas, I’ll snap their hand off and invest the money in someone else, regardless of his form. Am I being irrational?"
