The facts show that Vitesse have seen their defence breached in 6 of their previous 6 clashes, leaking 15 goals on the way. We will just have to find out whether or not that trend will end up being continued on into this next match.\n\nTelstar\n\nWLLDDL\n\nAfter a loss in their previous game against Willem II in Eerste Divisie competition, Telstar and their fans will hope to get a better result this time.\n\nIn that game, Telstar managed 39% possession and 14 attempts on goal with 4 on target.
