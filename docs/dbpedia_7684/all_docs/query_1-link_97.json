        "text": "Almere City and AZ Alkmaar face each other at Yanmar Stadion in the opening match of their Eredivisie campaign. Almere were producing fine displays in pre-season, with the team winning each of their last three warm-up games, but they will have a much bigger fish to fry against AZ. A man to watch in the home team will be summer signing Baptiste Guillaume, who scored eight goals for Guingamp in the League Two last term.\n\nThe Cheese Farmers, on the other hand, aim to build on a hard-fought 1-0 win over Stoke City and seeing that Almere City suit them, we believe that there is a big value in betting on the visiting side. New signing Troy Parrott is widely expected to make his AZ debut in Saturday’s clash. Keep in mind, though, that the two sides played out a goalless draw in their last meeting at Yanmar Stadion.\n\nThis match will be played on 10/08/2024 at 20:00\n\nDespite playing for PSV during his youth career, Riechedly Bazoer made his Eredivisie debut with Ajax. The central midfielder who was born on 12 October, 1996 in Utrecht, scored his first goal for Ajax on 15 February, 2015 in a 4-2 victory over Twente.\n\nFour days later he made his European debut with the Amsterdammers, taking part in a 1-0 win over Legia in the Europa League. Bazoer scored five goals in 29 league appearances for Ajax in the 2015/2016 season, but he failed to win the domestic trophy with Frank de Boer’s troops.\n\nSpeaking of his international career, Bazoer has two caps for Netherlands U21 team and he made his debut for the first team on 13 November, 2015 against Wales. It has to be noted that he came as a late substitute in the 3-2 victory over the Dragons. Back in 2012 the right-footed midfielder won the UEFA U17 European Championship with the Dutch national team."
