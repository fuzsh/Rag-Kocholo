        "text": "Willem II 2 - 3 Emmen Highlights\n\nOne more point of criticism of yesterday's game: I am shark-sick of our \"supporters\" who are going to whistle their own players during the game (as with Michael Woud). That has never made a player better. My vision: you stand behind your team during the race. You give criticism afterwards.\n\nBut back to Michael Woud…. He is thrashed hard here by everything with a red-white-blue heart and I understand the frustration. I think it is badly wrong! The boy is 20 years old, his late father's inspiration and he wants to honor him by delivering top performances. And then he can participate once. He needs a lot of support from players and the public that he doesn't get (yet). So just start ... Good that he dares!\n\nJust a few snippets from Willem II fans on Woud, these were from a couple of fans that stuck up for him which is heartening. There is a lot more but it's not exactly glowing.\n\nHe's only 20 years old, it'll be a bit of a knock, especially hearing about the fans getting on his back with chants and whistling at him, but he'll bounce back, however he needs a season or two in the Eerste Divisie to get some experience and to get that confidence back. Willem II have 25 year old Mattijs Branderhorst on loan at NEC Nijmegen currently so will be interesting to see what happens when he comes back to the Willem II at season's end.\n\nFrom this week's Flying Kiwis, some interesting comments on Woud, after his game on the weekend. The Olympics will be a good stage for him, as he continues his development.\n\n\"Woud didn’t have to make many saves. Heracles were competitive in the first stanza, hitting the crossbar straight after Willem II had scored, but they were comfortably the second best on the park in the second 45 with all that was missing being another goal for W2. There was a header that went close for Heracles but it was off target. Nothing out of Woudy’s wheelhouse... but that was the impressive thing. He looked comfortable as though he knew he belonged, a big boost since the last times he played for this team – something that he spoke about after the game to the microphones (watch the vid in the hyperlink below).\n\nMichael Woud: “I look on that period [his four games last season] and I learned so much. I learned so much in those games and I knew that when I got another chance like today I’d be able to use those things I learned to help me and today I showed that I learned a lot of those in those games and I was more calm and more easy and yeah I’m happy with how I played. Those first for games were just me learning and getting used to the league, you know.”\n\nIt sounds like whatever malady laid Wellenreuther low was nothing too serious and he’s not expected to miss the game against Ryan Thomas and PSV next week, though it’ll depend how he comes through training. Speaking of PSV, Willem II are now four points clear of them and still in fourth place only behind Feyenoord on goal difference. Their 40 points is already more than they’ve accrued in 10 of their 12 completed top flight seasons. Also, James McGarry was an unused sub for this game same as he has been for every league game this season – playing once for six minutes as a sub against Emmen way back in August.\"\n\nFrom this week's Flying Kiwis\n\nhttp://theniche-cache.com/football/2020/5/7/flying-kiwis-curious-times-in-the-dutch-eredivisie\n\n\"Finally, we’ve gotta return to the fates of Willem II one last time now where the rollercoaster ride that’s been this whole Eredivisie yarn gets to take one last swoop... because starting goalie Timon Wellenreuther is also out of contract at the end of this season and by all reports is expected to leave the club. Willem’s technical director has been talking about contingency plans.\n\nWellenreuther, a former German youth international, has been one of their star players this season but he’s already rejected a new contract offer and as a pending free agent has been allowed to negotiate with foreign clubs since January. Thus Willem have been looking for his replacement since before the season was stopped but figuring that out during the coronavirus is not going to be easy and may well be impossible while travel bans remain in place. Which means that Michael Woud has a decent chance to start next season as the number one keeper at the club unless Wellenreuther changes course and re-signs.\"\n\nThis week's Flying Kiwis.\n\n\"DUTCH EREDIVISIE\n\nGot cancelled ages ago and nothing has changed since the last Flying Kiwis thing about that whole situation. Ryan Thomas is stuck in neutral having just gotten his PSV career really humming.\n\nJames McGarry got the negative as his contract ran down and he negotiated an early release to come back to Aotearoa before the lockdown.\n\nAnd Michael Woud has landed in the positive as Willem II got a Europa League qualifying spot thanks to their finishing position (which they seemed unlikely to hold on to had the season carried on to its natural conclusion) plus what’s more is that their first choice keeper, Timon Wellenreuther, is leaving the club and a suitable replacement will be tough to find in this transfer market with travel bans and all that so ol’ Woudy might get very lucky indeed.\n\nWellenreuther has been the starting keeper for the last three years but he’s confirmed the rumours in an instagram post that he’s off to take that next step in his career.\"\n\nFrom this week's Flying Kiwis.\n\n\"Michael Woud: “It is good for my development to arrive at Almere City FC and play some more minutes. I need that experience to grow. I'm excited to show what I can do in Almere.”\n\nInteresting move, this. Willem II did brilliantly to hang on to qualify for the early Europa League stages by virtue of their fifth placing at the time the Dutch league was abandoned for pandemic related reasons. Their top choice keeper, German Timon Wellenreuther, had long since been rumoured to leave though and sure enough he’s since signed with Anderlecht in Belgium leaving that number one gloveman role vacant.\n\nWoud was the backup keeper for the entirety of last season (after an injury break at the start, at least) and a good chunk of the season before but has only made five first team appearances for Willem II so far. The club never lied about the fact that they preferred to sign an imported keeper to fill Wellenreuther’s boots but with the state of travel in Europe what it is at the moment that wasn’t necessarily a simple task. Which might have been a fortuitous fall of the dice for Woudy but nah turns out he’s going out on loan instead. Pretty much the standard plan for a player in Woud’s position. He’s spent two years learning as a backup but he’s 21 years old and will learn more from playing regular first team footy.\n\nThus Willem II won’t have their top two keepers next season, while Greek third-stringer Giorgios Strezos (who is coming off contract) and 19-year-old academy grad Connor van den Berg have never played for the senior team. Safe to say they must be confident they’ve got a transfer or two lined up if Woud’s being allowed to leave on loan. It’ll be a full season loan, by the way, with reports suggesting they considered loaning him out in January too.\n\nhttps://t.co/W501pcHlvy\n\nAlmere City were ninth in the second tier when that all got canned... that’s one spot outside the promotion playoff spots. Their regular goalie was 27 year old Joshua Smits but he’s just left, confirmed literally a couple days before Woud’s arrival was announced, to have signed in Norway with 2019 runners-up FK Bodø / Glimt. Crazy thing is you’ll hear a little bit more about that club in a second. So that leaves the gloves free for Woudy to swoop in, although he will have competition for that spot.\n\nMore from Michael Woud: “This is a good step in my career. My goal is to become the first goalkeeper at Almere City FC and play many games. I want to get better here and fight with the team for promotion. That is the goal of Almere City FC and I would like to contribute to that.”\n\nAlmere City Technical Director Teun Jacobs: “Michael is a talented goalkeeper who has enjoyed part of his career at Sunderland and has already made his debut as an international. He is a physically strong boy, who therefore dominates in the penalty area and can also play well with his feet. We're glad we were able to capture him.”"
