        "text": "With 36 goals banged in last week, we saw 31 this week in just six games. As always, Will Burns is here with all the action.\n\nExcelsior and Almere City played out an amazing ten-goal game on Sunday morning but what was more amazing is that seven of those goals were scored in the first half… and three in three minutes at the end of the game.\n\nAlmere took a three minute lead through a Thomas Verheydt header although Excelsior responded in style with a Reuven Niemeijer goal just two minutes later. Last week’s player of the week Elias Mar Omarsson hit two first half goals on 16 and 18 minutes to give Excelsior a 3-1 lead.\n\nHowever, we saw a first half comeback from Almere as Faris Hammouti and Jearl Margaritha notched in 24th and 25th to level the game up. Six goals before the half-hour mark – crazy.\n\nThe first-half action was not finished as Verheydt added his second to give Almere a 4-3 lead at the break. The goals dried up until five astonishing minutes at the end of the game.\n\nXian Emmers added a fifth in the 86th minute to drive the nail in the coffin for Excelsior but from the kick-off Omarsson grabbed his hat-trick to give the socially distanced home fans some hope.\n\nHowever, from the resulting kick-off Almere finished the game off with their sixth goal from Tim Receveur. A truly crazy finish to a crazy game.\n\nSC Cambuur experienced a huge 7-1 win away to MVV Maastricht on Saturday evening. Goals from Robin Maulun, Mees Hoedemakers, Robert Muhren (2), Jamie Jacobs and Jarchino Antonia handed Cambuur their biggest win since defeating Jong Ajax 6-0 in April 2019.\n\nFull results below.\n\nRESULTS\n\nSaturday 5th September\n\nFC Eindhoven 2-3 SC Telstar\n\nMVV Maastricht 1-7 SC Cambuur\n\nRoda JC 3-0 TOP Oss\n\nSunday 6th September\n\nExcelsior 4-6 Almere City\n\nFC Den Bosch 2-1 FC Dordrecht\n\nHelmond Sport 0-2 NAC Breda\n\nPLAYER OF THE WEEK\n\nSo yeah let’s give him it again! Icelandic striker Elias Mar Omarsson added a hat-trick in the 6-4 loss to Almere City to the two goals he scored last week against Jong PSV. Five goals in the two games.\n\nWell done Elias."
