Let‚Äôs find out whether or not that trend will be continued on into this next match.\n\n‚ÜîÔ∏è Head to head\n\nAn examination of their most recent head-to-head meetings dating back to 25/04/2014 shows us that FC Oss have won 1 of them & Excelsior 4, with the number of drawn results being 1.\n\nA sum of 14 goals were yielded between them in these games, with 3 for TOP Oss and 11 netted by Roodzwarten. That‚Äôs an average goals per game figure of 2.33.\n\nThe last league game featuring these clubs was Eerste Divisie match day 31 on 18/03/2022 when it ended FC Oss 1-1 Excelsior.\n\nOn that occasion, FC Oss had 45% possession and 13 shots at goal with 3 on target.
