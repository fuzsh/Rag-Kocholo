        "text": "History\n\nThe Eerste Divisie, also known as the Keuken Kampioen Divisie because of sponsorship rights, is the second-highest football competition in the Netherlands that the KNVB organizes. It is the lowest division in Dutch football where professional football is played. The competition is officially called the Keuken Kampioen Divisie after the main sponsor. Until 2018 the division was called the Jupiler League. Want to get historic data on the Keuken Kampioen Divisie?\n\nStructure\n\nThe competition consists of 20 clubs. The clubs play each other once at home and once away, which means every team will play 38 matches in a season. The champion and the runner up of the Eerste Divisie will receive an automatic promotion to the Eredivisie. Seven other clubs enter ‘the Nacompetitie’. A promotion/relegation playoff that includes the 16th placed club in the Eredivisie. These playoffs also include 4 teams who have won a ‘period’ of a season. This is a small number of games of about 8 rounds. If the club that wins a period has qualified for the ‘Nacompetitie’ by winning a previous period, its place is filled by the next-best club in that period that has not already qualified. Usually, the clubs that qualify for the Nacompetitie are the 3rd- through 9th-placed clubs in the final table.\n\nMeticulous Eerste Divisie data\n\nKeep track of all the fixtures, statistics, standings and player information of all the Keuken Kampioen Divisie seasons.\n\n20,000 Happy API users\n\n7+ Years of historical data\n\n20 Keuken Kampioen Divisie teams with detailed season stats\n\nGet started\n\n2021/2022 Keuken Kampioen Divisie clubs\n\nBelow you can find some information about the teams currently competing in the Keuken Kampioen Divisie.\n\nADO Den Haag, also known as Alles Door Oefening Den Haag which translates into Everything Through Practice, was founded in 1905.
