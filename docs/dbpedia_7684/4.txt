PSV and Almere City have only played each other once before. That happened some time ago: in 2014, when the teams met in the third round of the TOTO KNVB Beker. In that cup encounter, which was also played in Almere, PSV drew the longest by winning 5-1. Luciano Narsingh, Georginio Wijnaldum (2x) and JÃ¼rgen Locadia (2x) crowned themselves goal scorers.

FC Omniworld

Almere City was founded in 2001 under the name FC Omniworld, the name held until the 2009-2010 season. It first competed in the Keuken Kampioen Divisie before 2005, and last season promoted to the Eredivisie for the first time in the club's history. Last week it took its first point in that competition, playing a 0-0 draw at home to Excelsior.

Keuken Kampioen Divisie

Psv U21 has played against 'De Zwarte Schapen' before. Last season the promising team took the lead in Almere (2-1) thanks to two goals from striker Jason van Duiven, Isaac Babadi was important with an assist. Almere City's captain Damian van Bruggen played all 36 games in the Keuken Kampioen Divisie for Young PSV in the 2016-2017 season.

Match five

With a win in the last match against NEC (4-0), the club has won its first four Eredivisie matches for the third consecutive season. With a win against the Almeren side, that is, game five, PSV can shake off a negative run. In the previous two seasons, 2021-2022 and 2022-2023, match number five was lost. The last season in which PSV won each of its first five Eredivisie games dates back to 2018-2019. In that edition, PSV 1 won the first thirteen league matches.

Noa goes after Dries

Noa Lang, one of the summer acquisitions, did not play in the game won on visit to Vitesse (3-1), but he did in the wins against FC Utrecht, RKC Waalwijk and NEC. He made his mark on every match by being important with a goal. Noa could become the second player in club history to score in each of his first four Eredivisie games for PSV, after Dries Mertens in 2011 (first five). At the time, the Belgian came over from FC Utrecht.

No losses

The last time PSV lost in the Eredivisie was on Jan. 24, visiting FC Emmen (1-0). Since then it has been unbeaten for 20 games (W16-G4-V0), which is the longest unbeaten streak for PSV since 2018 (20). The last time PSV remained unbeaten for more than 20 games in the Eredivisie was between September 2015 and March 2016. Back then, the Eindhoven natives, coached by Phillip Cocu, remained 21 duels without defeat.

Strong in away games

Head coach Peter Bosz 's team gives little away at its own Philips Stadium, but is also on a good run in away matches. It can win at least seven away games in a row in the Eredivisie for the first time since the 2015-2016 season (13, club record).

Commencement 8 p.m. at Yanmar Stadium.
