Two-way battle at top of Eerste Divisie could see Almere City move back ahead of Cambuur Leeuwarden Friday

There are six games Friday in the Netherlandsâ€™ number two league, which is number one in our betting hearts.

Almere City has an opportunity to move ahead of Cambuur Leeuwarden with a win, but both teams are starting to pull clear of the trailing pack for automatic promotion to the Eredivisie.

As always in this league, I will take the top clubs against the teams at the bottom of the table, so go with Volendam and Almere City.
