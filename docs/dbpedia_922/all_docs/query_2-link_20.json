The house is built in a long, comparatively narrow style, with galleries on the front and along one side of the house. In many cities, they tend to be built like row houses, but in New Orleans, they stand on their own lots with their own gardens.\n\nNew Orleans, like any other city, has several architectural styles that can be seen in the many historic homes still standing. A while ago, I found these charts that really come in handy when trying to imagine what a house would look like from a written description of it. The key vocabulary guides can help answer inevitable questions about a house's detail, usually, \"It's got a what?\"\n\nHouse Styles of New Orleans\n\nAmerican Townhouse\n\nKey Vocabulary 1\n\nKey Vocabulary 2\n\nHere are the websites these guides came from.

Another season of American Horror Story was Coven. New Orleans is no stranger to film crews, and this season in the American Horror Story series is no exception.\n\nUsed as Miss Robichaux’s Academy for Exceptional Young Ladies was the Buckner mansion. The mansion was built in 1856 for Henry Sullivan Buckner. It remained in the Buckner family until the mid 1920's, when it became Soule Business School, which operated there until 1983. Now, it is privately owned and a filming location.\n\nFun factoid (depending on your perspective): According to Atlas Obscura, Henry Sullivan Buckner had his mansion built to outdo the opulence of the home of a business rival, Frederick Stanton. Stanton Hall is in Natchez, Mississippi.\n\nStanton Hall, Natchez, MS Courtesy Expedia\n\nBack to Greek Revival in the Garden District\n\nA Tale of Two Plantations\n\nWhat makes this interesting is that something similar has been said about two plantation mansions, Nottoway and Belle Grove. Both were/are in White Castle, Louisiana. Nottoway Plantation's mansion was built by John Hampden Randolph, who named the plantation for the county in Virginia he had been from. Belle Grove was built by John Andrews, also from Virginia. There are at least two plantations in Virginia also named Belle Grove.\n\nYou see where this is headed?\n\nNottoway Resort~Nottoway Plantation\n\nApparently, Randolph and Andrews were rivals, and that meant they even wanted try to outdo each other by the opulence of their plantation mansions. They even commissioned the same architect, Henry Howard.\n\nThe White Ballroom at Nottoway Plantation\n\nToday, only Nottoway Plantation's mansion is still standing. As for Belle Grove...\n\nTake a Look Here\n\nBack to Greek Revival in the Garden District\n\nHouses Similar to the Brevard-Rice House\n\nAs you will see in the short video gallery, there are several houses built in the same basic style as the Brevard-Rice house in New Orleans. They all have their own unique little differences, from the columns to the iron lace New Orleans is famous for. Even the doors and windows are done in varying styles.\n\nThere are so many houses in New Orleans and in Louisiana that share architectural details while still maintaining a distinctive style all their own. These are houses that can be considered historic places for a number of reasons.\n\nItalianate Greek Revival in Old New Orleans\n\nClick Thumbnail Image to View on YouTube\n\nYou can read more about the houses featured here in the links below:\n\nCollinwood House\n\nThe home where NFL football stars Eli & Peyton Manning grew up\n\n1608 Governor Nicholls Street on Realtor.com\n\nOn YouTube-At Home In New Orleans With Jane Scott Hodges\n\nBack to Greek Revival in the Garden District\n\nThe house that is across Chestnut Street from the Brevard-Rice house is the Carroll-Crawford house at 1315 First Street, built in 1869 for cotton merchant Joseph Carroll. The architect, Samuel Jamison, is also credited with building the home below, the Morris Israel house...\n\nBack to Greek Revival in the Garden District\n\nThe Neighbors at 1331 First Street\n\nThis house seems to be quite well known in its own right, and it really is the third door down (whoops!) from the Brevard-Rice house. Well, across Chestnut Street and three doors down at 1331 First Street.\n\nThere is also a PDF document made available that shows images of the renovations that went on in the house. If ever there was a chance to see a house like this one or the Brevard-Rice house under renovation, this would be it.\n\nEach of these houses will also have interior details that are a little-or a lot-different from one another.

I understand she had cancer.\n\nMy extremely belated condolences to her family and friends.\n\nI read Julia Reed's book, The House on First Street, several years ago. One thing I remember about it is that there were multiple laugh-out-loud moments. Reed also described the state of things on First Street in New Orleans in the immediate aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. I wish all of the region hit by this hurricane had been as lucky.\n\nJulia Reed\n\nI was going to add some more homes that are similar to the Brevard-Rice house in the gallery above, but had a catching up moment. This has happened a lot, since, in 2020 and for a while afterwards, the pandemic definitely caught most of my attention. Especially when my mother was diagnosed with cancer during the pandemic. I am deeply blessed and fortunate that I still have her with me today.\n\nHowever, not everyone is so fortunate. When I learned Julia Reed had passed, I decided that instead, I would add a section about the First Street house she clearly loved renovating inside and out. I've wanted to do something like this for several years, ever since I read her book.\n\nWhat I'm going to start with here is a link to Reed's book on Amazon.com (click the book above), a picture of Reed's New Orleans house, and two links (so far) to articles about the house and the garden. The articles I've linked here have several beautiful photos of the house and the garden that I can easily sit and drool over for hours, I kid you not.\n\nBack to Greek Revival in the Garden District\n\nThe Terrace\n\nEntrance Hall\n\nThe Studio Garden\n\nRear Parlor\n\nPlease be sure to go back up to the video gallery of homes similar to the Brevard-Rice house, where you will find additional links.

Whichever year it was built, 2336 Esplanade Avenue is another New Orleans townhouse that features Greek Revival architectural details. In fact, there are several that are quite similar to the Brevard Rice house. Which ones jump out the most?\n\n2336 Esplanade Avenue\n\nThe most obvious ones first. These houses all seem to feature the same ornate cornices over the front galleries. The columns vary in style, but this one has similar ionic columns along the front galleries of the house. The difference is that the Brevard Rice house also has Doric and Corinthian columns in addition to the two Ionic columns fronting the first floor gallery along the front.\n\nFront of 2336 Esplanade Avenue (Very Large)\n\nAbove is an image you can right-click to open in a new tab. It is a very large file. When you look at the image up close, look carefully around the front door of the house. You will see the same basic pattern of windows framing the door. And while the outer frame is very similar to the one at the Brevard Rice house, it does not have the elaborate ornamentation that the Brevard Rice house's keyhole doorway has.\n\nYou can also see, running along the top above the front door and windows, the brick exterior construction.\n\nAnd finally, recall that the massive sash windows on these houses also seem to function as doors. The front windows on this house reflect this function...literally! Instead of lower sashes, these windows have in place of lower sashes double French doors!\n\nMuseum Display 2336 Esplanade Avenue\n\nLike the Brevard Rice house, the cutaway doors are similar to the outer frame of the front door of the house. They also have the same difference--they do not feature the ornamentation that is featured above the cutaway doors in the Brevard Rice house.\n\nFireplace 2336 Esplanade Avenue\n\nThese types of fireplaces seem to have been very popular in houses built during the period this house was built in. Indeed, this type of fireplace is also found in the Brevard Rice house. The double parlor, in particular.\n\nAbove the mantle is a large portrait of a woman. This portrait is displayed in this house because the house, as stated in the images above, is now Le Musée de f.p.c.--the Museum of the Free People of Color. Images of the museum's collection shows many portraits of the Free People of Color, whose history the museum is dedicated to preserving.\n\nMuseum of the Free People of Color\n\nI came across these images and Le Musée de f.p.c. when I was doing a little Merrick Mayfair-related research. Merrick had shown David Talbot and Aaron Lightner old photographs she had of her ancestors, whose history she gave some details about. Her line, she explained, was descended from Angelique Marybelle Mayfair and a white Mayfair who lived in the Garden District and had actually been the nephew of Angelique Marybelle Mayfair. Yes, Oncle Julien.\n\nAngelique Marybelle Mayfair was clearly not the Angelique Mayfair who had been born in Saint Domingue in 1725 and was the great-grandmother of Oncle Julien, born in 1828. This ancestor of Merrick's, whose picture was the oldest in her collection, was already a Free Person of Color despite her close relation to the white Mayfairs of the Garden District. The image of her was described by Merrick, and it was this description that led me to take a look at anything I could find on photographs of Free People of Color in that era of New Orleans history. That is how I came across Le Musée de f.p.c.\n\nTo learn more about Le Musée de f.p.c.:\n\nLe Musée de f.p.c. Official Website\n\nNew Orleans Museum of Pre-Civil War Free People of Color NOLA.com\n\nDocent, Le Musée de f.p.c.\n\nBack to Greek Revival in the Garden District\n\nThe Cornstalk Fence Mansion\n\nThe Cornstalk Fence Mansion, 1448 Fourth Street\n\nRobert Short House--SAH Archipedia\n\nThe Cornstalk Fence House at 1448 Fourth Street, New Orleans, is also known as \"Colonel Short's Villa\". The house got its Cornstalk Fence name from the detail of the fence that surrounds the property. The house was built in 1859-60 for Colonel Robert Short, who hired architect Henry Howard to design the house. According to the February 1, 2016 article in Architectural Digest linked below, federal forces confiscated the house in 1863, during the Civil War. Before it was returned to Colonel Short in 1865, the house served as the executive mansion of the federal governor.\n\nThe owners at the time of the article had purchased the house in 1994 for $100,000.00(?!). When I first saw this price, I wondered if the article had forgotten a 0, but then, I recalled something else mentioned in The Witching Hour. Homes in New Orleans, homes like this one, had been on the market in the late 1980's at about half of what they were worth, due to the local economy being affected by an oil bust at the time. Although the owners had purchased this house in 1994, and it's possible property values still felt the impact of this economic bust to some extent, $100,000.00 is still pretty...low.\n\nAn Iconic House in New Orleans--Architectural Digest\n\nColonel Short's Villa by Susan Rissi Tregoning\n\nClick Image for Susan Rissi Tregoning on Fine Art America\n\nWhen the owners bought the house in 1994, they began a renovation and restoration that lasted 10 years. Eventually, they sold the property.
