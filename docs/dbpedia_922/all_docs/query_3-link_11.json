The Bryan family was associated with Milford from its founding in 1639. Alexander and his son Richard Bryan were important figures in the local shipping industry and in the settling of the lands known as North Milford, which were to become Orange. Bryan's Farms, as it was known in 1700, would be one of several settlements reaching out into the area surrounding the Milford Colony. The first school was established here in 1750. Although 19 families have resided in the Bryan-Andrew House, the original character of the homestead endures, as do many of the materials used by Nathan Bryan when he began this house in 1739 upon his marriage to Elizabeth Whitman. Nathan died in 1766 and bequeathed one third of the house to his wife, in the custom of the day, and two thirds to his son Nathan. By 1775, son Nathan moved to New Milford, selling his share to Samuel and William Andrew and by 1795 he sold his mother's one third to William Andrew. With grants from the State of Connecticut, the Connecticut Trust for Historic Preservation, the Frederick DeLuca Fund, donations, and fundraisers, the Orange Historical Society is restoring the home. It is now open by appointment as a house museum and for local school tours to experience a day in the life of early Orange using Bryan's Farms as its historical location. We are now serving food in the 1740 hearth for dinners and hearth cooking classes. For details call us at 203-795-3106 or via email at orangehistorical@yahoo.com In the summer of 2001 and 2002, an archeological dig took place at the home and artifacts unearthed are now cataloged and available for viewing.
