Links are provided to photos and the history of the house.\n\nView as a simple list\n\nThe First Period of colonial American architecture was approximately 1626 through 1725. There are more remaining First Period houses in Essex County, MA than anywhere else in the country, and Ipswich has 59 (depending on who’s counting), more surviving First Period homes than any other town.\n\nFirst period houses have steeply pitched roofs, are asymmetrical due to having been built in phases, and feature large central chimneys. Exposed chamfered summer beams are almost always found, especially in the front rooms. First Period builders were often trained in English Medieval and post-Medieval techniques. The fronts of these houses ideally faced south to maximize heat from the sun’s rays, which explains why so many First Period homes line the north side of High Street in Ipswich. Many of the houses maintain their First Period characteristics, while many of those features are hidden or removed in other houses of that era.\n\nView a chronologial list of First Period houses in Ipswich.\n\nSOURCES and RESOURCES\n\nSusan Nelson’s detailed listing for the Ipswich Historical Commission\n\nMACRIS (the Massachusetts Cultural Resource Information System)\n\nColonial Society Inventory, 1974\n\nThe Framed Houses of Massachusetts Bay, 1625-1725\n\nArchitecture in Colonial Massachusetts: A Conference Held by the Colonial Society of Massachusetts\n\nSomething To Preserve\n\nIpswich in the Massachusetts Bay Colony by Thomas Franklin Waters\n\nFirst Period Buildings of Eastern Massachusetts., National Registry of Historic Places\n\nHistoric New England, Architectural Style Guide\n\nIpswich Patriot Properties assessors database\n\nMap of First Period houses in Ipswich\n\nIpswich First Period Houses\n\n69 S.
