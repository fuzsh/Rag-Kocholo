Koontz in 1882 and was added to the National Register in 1997, the building is a Greek Revival style. The building is currently vacant, while it is being renovated, but has been a popular restaurant & lounge until recently .\n\nThe porch and balcony in the historic photo (right) c. 1950 were pulled down by a runaway horse and wagon soon after the photo was taken. The building was also home to the undertaker, whose workshop was on the third floor.\n\nThe hotel closed in the late 1960s.\n\nSome former employees believe the building is haunted and it does have an interesting history, which included finding bullet holes in the wall that give credence to a local story from the 1920s.\n\nMaps\n\nCunha Farmstead\n\nNational Register of Historical Places\n\n33263 Oregon Trail Road\n\nEcho, Oregon\n\nInfo: (541) 376-8411\n\nThe Cunha Farmstead site consists of thirteen contributing buildings. A fourteenth, the original Umatilla County Jail building, can now be found in Fort Henrietta Park. The Queen Anne style home dates from 1902.\n\nThe owner, Joseph Cunha, was a Portuguese immigrant from the Azores, who came to America as a stowaway on a Boston-bound ship. Through hard work and intelligence he built up a ranch and business operation that was one of the largest in the county. He was instrumental in construction of St. Peter's Church and the Echo Bank Building.\n\nMaps\n\nEcho Bank Building and Historical Museum\n\nNational Register of Historical Places\n\n230 W. Main Street\n\nEcho, Oregon\n\nInfo: (541) 376-8411\n\nThe Echo Bank Building, constructed in 1920 by Joseph Cunha, was opened in 1921. It is an example of the Roman Classical style of the 20th century. Raymond W. Hatch designed the building. The exterior is glazed terra cotta and brick. The interior features marble flooring and iron-banking teller’s cages.\n\nThe bank is now a museum.\n\nThe bank as a business, was incorporated in 1905 by local ranchers and in 1933, though still solvent, was closed by its founders. Echo businessmen bragged that the bank survived the depression to be sold to First National Bank of Pendleton.\n\nThe building was used as a cash exchange and later as an insurance office. In 1980, Joseph C. Andrews purchased and donated it to the Echo Historical Museum, Inc.\n\nMaps\n\nEcho Methodist-Episcopal Church\n\nNational Register of Historical Places\n\n21 N. Bonanza Street\n\nEcho, Oregon\n\nInfo: (541) 376-8411\n\nThe Echo Methodist-Episcopal Church was built in 1886 on land donated by J.H. & Cynthia Koontz. The church was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1997. The church is a New England-Style Church with gothic and craftsman elements.\n\nBefore the church was constructed, services & revivals were held in a grove of trees called Spike's Grove, located south of town in a Cottonwood Grove along the Umatilla River owned at the time by Elvira Teel and later her daughter and son-in-law Elmer & Pamela Spike. The first minister of the new church was Rev. H.F. Williams, L.D.\n\nIn 1910 the Koontz family donated more land and a wing was added to accommodate the growing congregation. The old tower was removed and a new, larger tower with crenelated top was built which, with the added wing, resulted in an asymmetrical building. Two large windows were modified with an arched top light.\n\nMaps\n\nEdwards Building\n\nNational Register of Historical Places\n\n320 W. Main Street\n\nEcho, Oregon\n\nInfo: (541) 376-8411\n\nBuilt in the 1860s, this commercial building housed a number of businesses including the Echo News. W.H. Crary operated the newspaper from the ground floor and lived above for many years. It was also used as a second hand store, a Japanese restaurant and even a 1910 Sanborn Maps business. It is now an apartment building.\n\nThe building may have been moved from Umatilla City in the 1880s.\n\nThe Linden tree in front of the building is on Echo’s Heritage Tree List and was planted by W.H. Crary himself. A marker on the tree provides additional information.\n\nMaps\n\nKoontz Building\n\nNational Register of Historical Places\n\n141 N. Main Street\n\nEcho, Oregon\n\nInfo: (541) 376-0421; [email protected]\n\nBuilt in 1904-05 by J.H. Koontz, this beaux-arts styled building served as a general store and feed and seed. Son-in-law, Charles Miller, and F.T. George then operated the George & Miller Store until their new building was finished in 1910 on Bridge Street.\n\nThen came the O.B. & Bob Store. At some point the building was converted to a restaurant, then bowling alley. After the bowling alley was closed c. 1972, the building became a fiberglass factory for constructing satellite dishes and boats.\n\nThe city of Echo sold the building in 2009, Renovation was recently completed and building unveiled as the new home of Sno Road Winery and tasting room.\n\nMaps\n\nUmatilla Masonic Lodge Hall\n\nNational Register of Historical Places\n\n20 S. Dupont Street\n\nEcho, Oregon\n\nInfo: (541) 376-8411\n\nThe Masonic Lodge was built circa 1868 in Umatilla Landing, making it the second oldest Masonic Lodge in Eastern Oregon. When the railroad was constructed, Umatilla Landing followed the course of many boom towns and boosted. The county seat was shifted to Pendleton and many of the buildings were abandoned.\n\nThe Masonic Lodge as well as at least three other commercial buildings were relocated to Echo, where they remain today. As a result, two of these, the Masonic Lodge and Umatilla County Jail, are two of the oldest buildings in the county.\n\nThe Lodge was taken apart, the pieces marked, loaded on a railroad car, and moved to Echo in 1906 where it was reassembled. The total cost was approximately $160. The lower floor was rented to businesses (one was a pool hall that sold Near Beer) and the top floor used for lodge activities. In 1910, the lodge members paid to have a basement dug and the building was moved 50 feet south to its current location .\n\nMaps"
