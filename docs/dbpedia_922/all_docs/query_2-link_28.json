        "text": "EDWARD DURELL STONE, FAIA (1902-1978)\n\nStone was born in Fayetteville AR and attended the University of Arkansas studying Architecture. His older brother, James Hicks Stone, an architect in Boston, invited him to Boston where he attended the Boston Architectural Club (now Boston Architectural College), Harvard University, and MIT, but never received a degree. Eventually, he would receive five honorary degrees.\n\nBetween semesters at Harvard and MIT, Stone worked in the offices of Coolidge Shepley Bulfinch and Abbott, H. H. Richardson's successor firm. Henry R. Shepley, one of the firm's senior partners, mentored Stone and assisted him throughout his career. While at MIT, Stone won the prestigious Rotch Travelling Fellowship to Europe and North Africa for two years. In Europe he fell in love with Modernism. He was offered a job while in Stockholm at Schultze and Weaver and returned to New York City in October 1929, just before the Great Depression. He married Sarah Orlean Vandiver in 1931. They had two sons Edward Jr. and Robert.\n\nStone designed the main lobby and grand ballroom of the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in New York City. He then moved on to work in the offices of Reinhardt, Hoffmeister, Hood & Fouilhoux, who were among the architects associated on the Rockefeller Center project. Stone was the principal designer on the Radio City Music Hall and the Roxy Theater (later called the Center Theater), and he worked in conjunction with interior designers Donald Deskey and Eugene Schoen. His relationship with Deskey ultimately led to his first independent commission, a startling, volumetric 1933 house for Richard Mandel. The acclaim for the Mandel House led to other prominent residential commissions. Similarly, his work on the Rockefeller Center project also brought him the attention of Wallace Harrison and Nelson Rockefeller.\n\nWhen the time came to choose an architect for the new Museum of Modern Art, Stone's name was put forth by Harrison and Rockefeller over the objections of Alfred Barr Jr., the Museum's director. Stone was selected in association with Philip Goodwin, the only architect on the Museum board. It was at this point that Stone formally started his own architectural practice, opening an office in Rockefeller Center. Stone was in the Army during WWII from 1942 to 1945, stationed in Washington DC where he was the Chief of the Planning and Design Section. His principal responsibility was planning Army Air Force bases.\n\nStone reopened his office in late 1945 in New York City and got mostly residential commissions. His success as a practitioner of Modernist architecture and his prominence as an academic connected him with Walter Gropius, Pietro Belluschi, George Howe, and William Wurster. Stone designed the US Pavilion at the Brussels World's Fair. While it was under construction in 1958, Stone was featured on the cover of the March 31 Time Magazine. Through his relationship to Senator William Fulbright, he got the commission for the Kennedy Center in DC. For the next twenty years, Stone designed buildings intended to reflect what he considered more universal values rather than what he called the \"transient enthusiasms\" of Modernism. Stone attributed this shift to his second wife, Maria Elena Torchio, whom he met in 1953 and married in 1954. They had two children, Hicks and Maria, and in 1966 they had a very public divorce.\n\nMid 1950s - William Wesley Peters, Maria Stone, Frank Lloyd Wright, and Edward Durell Stone. Photo by Charles Rossi.\n\nStone and NCSU School of Design Dean Henry Kamphoefner did not get along. Kamphoefner was one of several critics in the architectural community who generally shunned Stone for veering away from the pure Modernist aesthetic towards more decoration.\n\nKamphoefner scholar David Brook wrote in his dissertation, \"According to a widely circulated story—often told by Kamphoefner himself—he and Stone ... had a run-in at an apartment party in New York City, hosted by Henry Haskell, editor of Architectural Record. Protagonist Stone was five years older than Kamphoefner and a native of Arkansas. He was described by interviewers as a 'big, informal, handsome man who was soft of speech and had a habitual expression of kindness.' Yet, that evening in the 1950s all his gentle traits went out the window. Sweeping into the party with a lady friend, Stone surveyed the crowd, spotted Henry Kamphoefner, and declared in a stentorian voice, 'Well, what do you know, Henry Kamphoefner is here. You know, there are three things in this world that are overrated: architecture, f**king, and Henry Kamphoefner!' There was dead silence; then Haskell turned to Kamphoefner and dryly said, 'Well, Henry, you're in pretty good company.' With that witty counterpoint everyone burst out laughing.\"\n\nHowever, Stone had the last laugh. Sometime afterwards, Stone met Tom White, Chair of both the NC Advisory Budget Commission and the NC Legislative Building Commission. The relationship led to a commission for the huge NC Legislative Building in downtown Raleigh and ten years later to the new NC Museum of Art on Blue Ridge Road. Both projects were in collaboration with Raleigh firm Holloway and Reeves.\n\nHis office was extremely successful and he won major architectural commission such as the Kennedy Center in Washington DC into the early 1970s. The public liked most of his buildings. He won five Honor Awards from the national AIA. Business Week called him \"the man with a billion on the drawing board.\"\n\nHe married his third wife, personal assistant Violet Moffat in 1972, had a daughter Fiona, and retired from active practice in 1974. His papers are at the University of Arkansas. Edward Durell Stone & Associates continued to exist in various forms until 1993. His son Hicks Stone published a book on his father in 2011. Bio adapted from Wikipedia. Many thanks to Hicks Stone and Catherine Westergaard Cramer for their extensive research.\n\nTime Magazine 1958\n\nThe Murphy Brinkworth Construction Corporation was the builder for several of Stone's houses. See their project list here. Stone appeared on the TV show \"What's My Line\" in August 1958.\n\n\"Another current fad in these individual dwellings, which I decry, is the so-called ranch house. This rage for informality in American life, I believe, is a lame excuse for laziness. It's obviously easier to feed the children hamburgers in the back yard in the manner of ranch hands from a chuck wagon than it is to have them sit at a table where they might conceivably acquire some dignity, manners and grace.\" — Edward Durell Stone, 1962\n\n\"They say people are fundamentally interested in only three things - food, sex and shelter. I can't say I'm authoritative on the first two, although I'm in favor of both. It's shelter that concerns me, and it's nice to be doing something people are interested in.\" — Edward Durell Stone\n\n1935 - The Rockefeller Apartments, 24 West 55th Street, New York NY. Next to the Museum of Modern Art. Designed by Wallace K. Harrison with Stone assisting. Bottom photo of the Garmey Apartment by Fred Conrad.\n\n1935 - The Richard M. Mandel House, 323 Haines Road, Bedford Hills NY. Many project lists place it at Mount Kisco NY which is nearby. Commissioned in 1933, it is often cited as the first International Style house on the East Coast. 10,000 square feet with 32 rooms, 7 bedrooms and 4.5 baths. Interiors by Donald Deskey. Designed with Thomas Williams of New York City. Sold in 1991 to Eric and Ana Brill. Added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1996. Sold in 2006 to William Sofield and Dennis Anderson, who have been working on a renovation ever since.\n\n1934 - The Ulrich Kowalski House, aka Early Dawn, aka the Fris House, 121 Old Roaring Brook Road, Mount Kisco NY. 3.24 acres. This was Stone's second International Style house in the Mount Kisco area. By then the community had enough of Modernism. They changed the local building codes to prevent further Modernist houses, or in their words, \"further desecration of the community.\" At some point the house was sold to the Fris family. The pool and adjacent gynasium was a major addition; not sure if designed by Stone. BW photos by Bill Maris/ESTO. Sold in 2007 to Richard and Laura Zandi.\n\n1936 - The A. J. Cole House, Greenwich CT. Designed with William H. Jackson, who probably did most of the work. Unbuilt.\n\n1936 - The Williams Raisch House, Stamford CT. 2-story International Style with curved ends, various schemes. Unbuilt. Raisch also had Stone design two weekend houses in 1938, house A in Stamford and house B in Nassau, Bahamas. Unbuilt.\n\n1936 - The Colliers Magazine House, aka the Colliers Model Home. Published in March 1936 in Colliers Magazine as part of a six-article series. The model was very popular and was built in several variations, as shown below, over the next decade.\n\n1936 - The E. T. and Tom Miller House, 8553 6th Street, Downey CA. Based on the Collier's Model Home, published in Colliers Magazine in 1936, the first time a mass-market American publication endorsed modern architecture. The large rectangular windows in the circular dining room were originally made of glass block, a favorite device of the architect. Bottom two photos by Michael Locke.\n\n1936 - The Warren R. Wynn House, Miami Beach FL. Unbuilt.\n\n1936 - Townhouse, location unknown. Six stories; usual NYC brownstone type with garage, 3 maids rooms, sitting room, projection room, butler, caretaker. Likely unbuilt.\n\n1936 - The Wayne V. Brown House, 614 Hollow Tree Ridge Road, Darien CT. Designed with Richard Boring Snow. Renovated in 2008. Sold in 2015 to Matthew and Melanie Dumas.\n\n1936 - The Frank Mandel House, Palm Springs CA. Unbuilt.\n\n1937 - The Doris Dockstader Rooney House, 1918 La Mesa Drive, Dodge City KS. Based on the Colliers Magazine House.\n\n1937 - The Aline Meyer Liebman House, aka the Mrs. Charles I. Liebman House, Mount Kisco NY. An extensive hilltop estate with carefully integrated gardens developed in collaboration with landscape architect Michael Rapuano. Unbuilt. Interviewing architects must have been fun for Aline Liebman - besides Stone, Le Corbusier and Raymond Hood were also in the running.\n\n1937 - The Ladies Home Journal Magazine House, aka PEDAC House, aka Garden House 1404, published November 1937. The model was on display at PEDAC, a decorating art center in New York City. Also published in the Ladies Home Journal, April 1938. Landscape architecture by Michael Rapuano. Unbuilt.\n\n1937 - The Edward Clifford Jones Jr. House, 912 Sylvan Avenue, Fairmont WV. Based on the Colliers Magazine House.

Remodeled. Sold in 2007 to Katherine A. Sherry.\n\n1937 - The Charles Augustus Wallace House, aka the Wallace-McGee House, 415 Harden Street, Columbia SC. Based on the Colliers Magazine House. Built by Weissinger and Stork. Sold in 1968 to H. Glenn McGee. Awarded National Register status in 1979. Sold to Denise and Vincent Degenhart.\n\n1937 - The David Armstrong McNeill Sr. House, 220 Lee Street, Thomson GA. Based on the Colliers Magazine House. Henry Hogan, a master craftsman, supervised construction of the house. Charles Blumquist, a master mason, did the terra cotta tile, brick, and glass block work. Carl Springer did the stucco and plaster work. The McNeills' younger son, Thomas O'Shea McNeill, inherited the house and did a yearlong renovation in 1989. Sold to Robert Flanders. Sold around 2019 to Diana Blackwell.\n\n1938 - The W. T. Holt House, aka Rockfalls Estate, 4009 Chellowe Road, Richmond VA. The land also includes a rock quarry. Based on the Colliers Magazine House. In 1968, architect Haigh Jamgochian purchased the lot and buildings and he and his then-wife opened a Montessori-type school, outfitting the home with classrooms. It operated for one year. There was an extensive fire in 1983 in which Jamgochian was badly burned. As of 2011, the Stone house was uninhabitable. Sold in 2014. There is also a Civil War-era cottage on the property, and Jamgochian lived there until his death in 2019.\n\n1938 - The William C. Ilfield house, aka the Blattman House, aka the Edward Durell Stone House, 1710 8th Street, Las Vegas NM. Based on the Colliers Magazine House.\n\n1938 - The Maurice L. Miller House, 500 Upland Road, Louisville KY. Samuel Calvin Molloy is listed as the architect of record, but the influence of Stone's 1936 Colliers design is evident. Sold to Charles Cash.\n\n1938 - The Albert Carl Koch House, 4 Buckingham Street, Cambridge MA. Commissioned in 1936.

Commissioned in 1936. Originally 1000 acres along the Cooper River. Interiors by Gladys Freeman. Stone designed several Modernist buildings including a guest house complex, a stable, worker houses, and a power plant. Included in the National Register of Historic Places. The property was donated to the Catholic Church in 1949 and has been owned by the Trappist Monks since the 1960s. Many other structures, not by Stone, were constructed in the 1960s and 1970s.\n\nBetween 1993 and 2001, W. G. Clark designed a Guest House, a 12 unit spiritual retreat center on the site. The complex is open for public tours.\n\n1938 - The A. Conger Goodyear House, 14 Orchard Lane, Old Westbury NY. Was originally on 114 acres. 5.5 acres. 6000sf. A 1950 bedroom addition for his new wife, Zaidee, designed by Stone, was built by the Murphy Brinkworth Construction Company. Goodyear was one of the founders of New York's Museum of Modern Art. When he died in 1964, the family left it unoccupied, a state it would remain in for most of the next 50 years. The family donated the house in 1970 to the New York Institute of Technology as a President's house. That group sold to Wheatley Construction Company which planned to raze it for new development. The World Monuments Fund campaigned to save it starting in 2001 and eventually bought it in 2005. Later that year they sold to Troy Halterman. He never moved in, however, and sold it in 2007 to Eric Cohler who did $2M in renovations. Sold to Aby Rosen and Samantha Boardman in 2011 who added a guest house and did a multi-year restoration ending in 2015. Top middle photos by Ezra Stoller and David Sundberg/ESTO.

Photos by Ezra Stoller/ESTO. Their 1928 main house, originally 450 acres, was not by Stone. Interiors by Virginia Connor. According to Robin Graham, Altschul's grandson, the Study was inspired by the World's Fair house. The one large room was primarily a study with wood paneled doors that concealed the bookcases. It had the largest sliding glass door known at that time. A mile of river bank was excavated for the landscaping. Robin Graham's uncle owned the house for several years and it was damaged by flooding. He wanted to bulldoze it but the family convinced him otherwise. He tarped the roof, basically \"moth-balling\" the home. Chuck and Ellen Scarborough bought the estate with the intention of restoring the study.

Designed with Stanley Reese.\n\nSeeking an efficient and economical way to build homes, architect J. Fletcher Lankton of Peoria IL designed a utility core that brought together all the plumbing pipes, wiring conduits, and other necessary electric and mechanical items in one unit that could be manufactured off-site and inserted into a house under construction. The design saved scarce metal, allowed the elimination of a basement, and since it could be installed on a prepared base in less than one day, it considerably sped up the construction process. Lankton persuaded Kalamazoo's Ingersoll Steel and Disc Division of Borg-Warner to build the prototype. To prove that houses could be designed around the utility core in a variety of styles, sizes and price ranges, eight nationally known architects were commissioned to design 12 houses. Other architects besides Stone who did houses were Alden Dow, Royal Barry Wills, L. Morgan Yost, George Fred Keck, Hugh Stubbins Jr., and Harwell Hamilton Harris. Landscape architect Michael Rapuano developed the site plan.\n\nIn 1945 the houses were built in the Hillsdale Park subdivision, north of West Main Street. The Miller-Davis Company of Kalamazoo served as General Contractor. They were collectively known as Ingersoll Village. They were to be occupied for at least a year by Ingersoll engineers and have economics experts to evaluate the functionality of the utility unit. Open houses were held to interest the public in the concept. Later sold to private owners. Although many have been modified, many of the original Ingersoll Village houses are still in active use.\n\n1946 - The R. Andreas de Muinck House, 38 Old Woods Road, Saddle River NJ.

He wrote Dad for permission to use the design. But he ultimately built something rather different. It has since been remodeled by a couple who tell the story of the renovation online. As you probably already know, Dad did do a pavilion for the Christian Science Church which was reconstituted in Poway CA for a time, but was ultimately destroyed. He also did a pavilion at the fair for the televangelist Billy Graham. He and my late brother, Ed Jr., worked jointly on a pavilion called Julimar Farms. What I will wager you don't know, is Dad apparently did an exploratory design for a pavilion for the Kingdom of Jordan at the fair. I suspect that it was a lead generated by Dad's friend of longstanding, John Fistere. Fistere worked for the Kingdom in their information office at the time.
