Fielding's novel Joseph Andrews provides a realistic representation of 18th century English society. It depicts various characters that exemplify the vanities, hypocrisies, and moral failings of the time. Through these characters, Fielding aims to satirize and critique different facets of the society, including what he saw as the amoral behavior and sensuality of women. The novel uses humor and irony to expose societal flaws while maintaining Fielding's control over the narrative and moral message. It offers insights not just into individuals but into the English community as a whole during this period.",
