There were seventeen acres of farm buildings, fields, woods, and lots of chickens. They wanted their four children to grow up in the country.  Ralph was a city boy and had no idea what he was getting into. It soon became apparent that the egg business was not going to feed six people. Claire and Ralph started a small offset printing business, Claral Studio. They printed business cards, tickets for events, report cards and schedule cards for the school system, church bulletins for many of the eight churches in Easton. They printed music for the Robert King Music Company. In 1955, they started publication of a bi-weekly shopper’s guide named Easton Green Flyer. Publishing the Green Flyer was a family event. Even the children were recruited to collate, staple, and bundle the flyers for distribution to each household in town. In the early days, the flyers were addressed individually. Stencils were typed, and the papers were run through the stenciling machine by hand to print the addresses. The later use of bulk mail was a welcome improvement. The paper was always free and was so popular that people complained if their copy did not arrive.  There was no news as the primary purpose was to advertise local merchants. There were a few extra features.  - This &amp; That - was a short list of reader ads to buy, sell, or trade merchandise or services. There was at least one children’s art contest. The address portion of the back page could be entered in a drawing at the William N. Howard Insurance Company to win a ten-dollar certificate to spend at participating Easton businesses. The most popular feature was - Easton in Pictures. -  Miss Irene Poirier, the librarian at Ames Free Library, was one of writers of articles, each a description of a significant building or location in Easton. She then sent it to Ralph, who took a picture of the article subject and published them in the next issue of the Green Flyer. The paper had an amusing effect on one of the town’s merchants. Every other week, Claire went around to the customers, gathering the copy for the next week’s advertisements. Sundells owned a Shell gas station and garage across from the Rockery. The copy was often not ready in time, requiring another visit. One week, she gave up, and the ad did not appear. On the Sundells’ copy only, in the margin next to the ad’s customary location, she wrote - Looking for something? - After some initial sputtering and fuming, Mr. Sundell saw the humor in it, and adopted it as his slogan, - Looking for something?  In Easton, it’s Sundells. - This appeared in ads from then on, and long after the Green Flyer ceased publication, it could be seen on a billboard next to the gas station. In 1965, Ralph decided to pursue an ambition to be a missionary to Africa by moving to Texas, where training was available. He sold the printing business, and it was moved to North Easton, in a basement on Main Street.  Both the Green Flyer and Claral Studio thus faded into history.\n\tClaral Studio and The Green Flyer, Ralph and Claire Carroll, 1955-1965, source, Jay Gipson, info, Easton Historical Society\n\t,\n\tThe development by Oliver Ames and Sons Corporation of the factory and village land use in a rather organic manner with a mix work-related classes created  an integrated geographic network.

On November 27, 1889, Charles Harrison Andrews married Laura Davis Hartwell in West Bridgewater, daughter of Josiah Quincy, and Hannah Hartwell. In 1889, the Easton Massachusetts City Directory listed Hannah M. Andrews as the widow of Jason W. Andrews residing on Main Street. In 1895, the map of North Easton Village shows the parcel at 72-76 Main Street as noted with the name of Jason W. Andrews' widow, - H.

In 1910, residing at 72 Main Street were Charles Harrison, commercial traveler oil, and his wife, Laura Davis Hartwell Andrews, and Charles' mother, widow Hannah M. Pettee Andrews. On April 27, 1915, Hannah M. Pettee Andrews passed away in North Easton at the age of seventy-nine, with her burial in the Village Cemetery. In 1917, the Easton Massachusetts City Directory listed Charles Harrison Andrews residing with his wife, Laura Davis Hartwell Andrews on Main Street working as a traveling salesman.

It began a little south of Joseph Crossman's (now Thomas Randall's), passed between the gravel bank and  the hill just west of it, came out where  the road now runs east of Frederick Lothrop Ames' farm-house, kept through the Village, and was continued nearly to  the Stoughton line just above the Solomon R. Foster place. Those residents  who had houses on this street in 1744 were Joseph Crossman, at the east end;  Eliphalet Leonard, near the Red Factory, where he had a forge; Samuel Randall, near the railroad bridge; John  Randall, near the machine shop, Richard  Williams, on the Unity Church location; James Stacy, at the now Simeon Randall place; and Daniel Manley, on the east side of the Sol, Foster Road, so  called.  In 1812 Main Street was straightened at its east end, and continued to the then new Stoughton Turnpike, this extension being continued in 1850 to the North  Bridgewater (now Brockton)  line. The Solomon Foster end has not fared well. Voted in 1744, voted again in 1772, it has had but little done to it. It is no longer  a thoroughfare to Stoughton, and was in fact very early superseded  in that respect by the other two roads to that town.\n\tsource: History of Easton, William L. Chaffin, 1886\n\t,\n\tMain Street\n\tAccording to local historian William Ladd Chaffin, Main Street was laid out in 1744 and had at that time at least seven dwellings on it. Its east end was  straightened in 1812 and extended to what is  now Washington Street, and in 1850 it was extended again to the Brockton (then North Bridgewater) town line.  The road curves north at Lincoln Street and becomes North Main Street north of Elm  Street. From the start it has been a mixed-use area of homes,  businesses, and some factories. Much of the land north of Lincoln Street was owned by members of the Ames family, which built its  world-renowned shovel  factory complex on the east side of Main Street and several of the family’s earliest estates on the west side. The Oliver Ames and Sons company store and  several  tenements were located on the east side of Main Street south of Pond Street, and on family land on the east side the Ames Free Library and Oakes  Ames Memorial Hall, designed for Frederick  Lothrop Ames by his Harvard classmate Henry Hobson Richardson, were built in the early 1880's. Between the  Rockery on the west where Lincoln, Barrows, Centre, and Main Streets meet and  where Williams and Mechanic Streets intersect it on the east, Main Street,  particularly its north side, is a commercial district.\n\tsource: Massachusetts Historical Commission\n\t,\n\tMain Street\n\tMain Street, in North Easton Village, was first laid out in 1744. It began at Dailey Corner, passing between the gravel bank and the hill just west of it, came out  where the road now runs east of   Frederick Lothrop Ames' farmhouse, kept going through the village and was continued nearly to the Stoughton line just  above the Solomon R.

Prior to the printing of the new map, the   1852  map did not show the extension east of Dailey's Corner. The 1855, 1871 and the 1895 maps showed Main Street with the extension to the Brockton line.\n\tsource: History of Unionville, Carl B. Holmander, 2014",
