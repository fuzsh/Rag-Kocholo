        "text": "Introduction:\n\nThe term picaresque is a Spanish-driven word from picaro which means rogue. So basically a picaresque novel is a story of the adventures of a roguish hero who is not from royalty or is facing problems like an ordinary man. A picaresque novel is an episodic novel in which the story is preceded by episodes. It is considered to be one of the early forms of novels. This form was introduced by the Spanish (Lazarillo de Tormes in 1554) first and then Cervantes borrowed its few elements into his writing called Don Quixote.\n\nA picaresque novel has the following characteristics:\n\n1. Picaro or the rogue hero.\n\n2. Episodic structure\n\n3. Variety of settings\n\n4. No definitive end\n\n5. Exact picture of the contemporary society\n\n6. Element of morality is absent.\n\n7. Satire\n\nJoseph Andrews as a picaresque novel:\n\nHenry Fielding’s affinity for the picaresque model can be seen in several different ways. It is first evident in the portrayal of rogue and villainous characters; second, in the humorous style, which frequently takes on a mock-heroic tone; third, in the portrayal of characters from specific lower classes of men and women; and fourth, in the humorous or satirical descriptions of the chapter contents and the inclusion of side stories or episodes into the main narrative. But it is not mainly a picaresque style as it has journeys more indulged within allegorical journeys and ethical pilgrimage. Not like the basic picaresque stories with the only purpose of introducing new adventure events.\n\n1. Picaro or the rogue hero:\n\nThe hero of the novel is not distinctively defined as the name of the novel itself says “the history of adventures of Joseph Andrews and of his friend Abraham Adams. But the story mainly revolves around Joseph who can be called a protagonist and is a lowborn or from a low-class family which fulfills the first check box of the list above of the characteristics of a picaresque novel.\n\n2. Episodic structure:\n\nA picaresque novel is divided into episodes that lead the story and incidents that interlinks within the story. Now, Joseph Andrews is a long narrative novel that has five books and every book is divided into further episodic chapters. Also, the story has leading events that enclose reality in a capsule that bursts at the right time as the encounter with Mr. Wilson and his mention of his long-lost son that ends up being Joseph. We get to know it at the right time when fanny and Joseph surprisingly became siblings but this burst of news makes them happy and leads to a happy ending for fanny and Joseph.\n\n3. Variety of settings:\n\nThe picaresque novel leads a story of the adventures of the rogue hero with multiple settings. Similar to Don Quixote and Panza, Parson Adams and Joseph embark on a voyage that takes them to a number of country inns or rural homes where they engage in a number of adventures, some of which are burlesque. Like the city of London, two-wouse inn carriage, countryside, etc were the settings in the novel.\n\n4. No definitive ending:\n\nGenerally, a picaresque novel has a vague ending but Joseph Andrews ends up with the happy ending of the protagonist with him getting married to his beloved fanny goodwill.\n\n5. Exact picture of the temporary society:\n\nHenry fielding has finely written the follies and the corruption within the society. He has characterized lust by the characters of lady booby, Mrs. Slipslop, and betty but virtues by the character of fanny. The pompous and stupid surgeon and the drinking parson provide a bleak image of heartless people in The Tow-wouse Inn.\n\n6. Element of morality is absent:\n\nMorality is rarely a subject of picaresque novels but Joseph Andrew has used the theme of moral values and morals of the society. Fielding has portrayed a morally strong character of Joseph and also an immoral character of lady booby. So, using morality as a theme is not likely to be a picaresque style.\n\n6. Satire:\n\nFeilding has used mock and comic elements to satire society and the follies they had by the character's callous behavior and pompous appearance he has satire the society. He has written in his preface that :\n\n“I describe not men, but manners, not individual, but specie”.\n\nJust by saying this, he has made it clear that the follies shown or the characteristics of any character are not subjected to a specific gender or individual but everyone. As the hero meets a gamut of characters from the country squire to the haughty aristocrat, from hypocrite to ill-tempered soldiers, the writer is able to introduce with the least possible incongruity, the saint and the sinner, the virtuous and the vicious. The writer has a chance to present the life, culture, and morality prevalent in his time, and to satirize the evils.\n\nCritical analysis:\n\nIn contrast to the picaresque tradition, the main voyage in Joseph Andrews is not primarily a quest for adventure. It is a sober return trip to their house. When Joseph and Lady Booby are escorted to London, the reader gets a peek at how society functions in that enormous metropolis. The picaresque aspect first appears in Chapter 10 of Book I, when Joseph travels home in a borrowed coat. The picaresque tradition is continued till Book III’s conclusion. When he is attacked by bandits, beaten, stripped, and dumped unconscious into a ditch, Joseph encounters his first misadventure. Joseph is transported to an inn by a passing stagecoach and its occupants with great reluctance. The incident provides Fielding with sufficient opportunity to parody the pretenses and affectations of a society that is fundamentally inhuman.\n\nConclusion:\n\nIn conclusion, Joseph Andrews’ narrative is quite diffuse and rambling, giving us the impression that it is a picaresque book. However, overall, it is not a picaresque novel; rather, he has used the picaresque form to assist him to establish his comedic idea"
