        "text": "It all started at Whitfield School in 2007 as friends. Fast forward to 2021 and by happy chance Jake and Rachel ran into each other at McGurck’s in St. Louis. After catching up for a while, Jake decided to ask her out on a date. She said yes in the moment but planned on not going on the date until Elizabeth convinced her that Jake was a hot commodity! Needless to say, Rachel was lucky as she was swept off her feet with a night filled with throwing axes and ninja stars. From there, a fun night turned into endless experiences together. From trips to Michigan, Hawaii, Italy and others, they discovered their love for experiences together and for each other. The day after Thanksgiving in 2023, Jake proposed in Arkansas at his Aunt Lindsay and Uncle Kevin's lake house. Rachel was totally surprised even though her nails were painted white!"
