My responsibilities for the hexapod platform included control by a microcontroller for all 18 DOF, with each joint consisting of an SMA wire for actuation, a sensor for angle measurement, and a resistance measurement circuit to prevent overheating. Team mate constructed custom 3d printed ABS plastic skeleton. Project culminated in successful feedback control of all 18-DOF, with future work to include onboard artificial intelligence leveraging previous project experience.\n\nImplemented an innovative simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) algorithm in a\n\nmodified COTS hexapod in a team of four. Project application would be to serve as a post-disaster, underground search and rescue platform. The pre-built hexapod was modified with contact sensors on the leg tips for sole input (vision-less navigation) and was controlled with an on-board PC program built with C++. The robot’s objective was to traverse and map border-less tables with holes and quickly return…\n\nImplemented an innovative simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) algorithm in a\n\nmodified COTS hexapod in a team of four.
