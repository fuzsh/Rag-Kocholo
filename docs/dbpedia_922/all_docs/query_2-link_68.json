        "text": "Current and Upcoming Exhibitions\n\nEntourage\n\nEntourage presents the work of contemporary architects who confront and expand the ways bodies serve as units of measure for architecture. The exhibition centers research-based practices and projects across multiple sites: in people drawn by architects, within the political space of restrooms, and through the commercial fixtures of our daily lives. The exhibition presents works and documentations by MOS (Michael Meredith and Hilary Sample), Your Restroom is a Battleground (Matilde Cassani, Ignacio G. Galán, Iván L. Munuera, Joel Sanders), and Strat Coffman.\n\nAlongside the radical visioning of buildings, architects have also re-envisioned the index of people, bodies, figures, and actors that populate their buildings. In Unfinished Encyclopedia of Scale Figures, Michael Meredith and Hilary Sample of MOS indexed over 2000 people found in architectural drawings, collages, sketches, and renders. “It is impossible to represent architecture without representing the human,” writes MOS. Their accompanying work Selfie Curtain is an interactive textile work that gathers these bodies into a playful procession.\n\nYour Restroom is a Battleground (YRIAB) is a collaboration between Matilde Cassani, Ignacio G. Galán, Iván L. Munuera, Joel Sanders examining bathrooms as sites of protest. Originally exhibited as a dioramic model in conjunction with the Restroom Pavilion in the 2021 Venice Biennale, YRIAB presents seven stories of bathrooms as contested spaces around the globe. Rather than treat restrooms as glorified utility closets, the project insists on acknowledging the entanglement of policy, finance, race, gender, ability, health and environment in those spaces. By examining toilets as technological sites, YRIAB show how design and policy deny, exclude, or overdetermine certain bodies that need to excrete.\n\nErotica Generica is an ongoing research project by Strat Coffman that examines commercial fixtures and standard codes of architecture as sites where bodily elements such as bacteria, oils, and heat are transferred. Queering our understanding of generic fixtures, Coffman explores how everyday objects such as stair handles, doorknobs, and grips can be re-envisioned as intimate sites of transfer between one body to another. By accommodating acts of touching, architecture relishes in, rather than represses, its capacity to open pathways for anonymous contact.\n\nCurated by MAK Center Director Jia Yi Gu, the exhibition takes place in the Schindler House, an early modernist experiment that married the body to the natural environment. By centering new definitions in bodily rights, experiences, and forms, the exhibition brings contemporary practices working on the architectural governance of the body into conversation with early modernist ideas at the Schindler House.\n\nArtists\n\nMOS\n\nMOS is a New York–based architecture studio, founded by principals Michael Meredith and Hilary Sample in 2005. An internationally recognized architecture practice, MOS was the recipient of the 2015 Cooper Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum National Design Award in Architecture, the 2010 American Academy of Arts and Letters Architecture Award, and the 2008 Architectural League of New York Emerging Voices Award. Individual works have similarly received numerous awards and distinctions, most notably: the 2015 Global Holcim Award for sustainable construction (Asia-Pacific Region) for Community Center No. 3 (Lali Gurans Orphanage); the cover of Abitare and an AIA NY State Award of Excellence for School No. 1 (Krabbesholm Højskole), the 2014 accession of both the firm’s modular, off-grid House No. 5 (Museum of Outdoor Arts Element House) into The Museum of Modern Art, Architecture and Design Collection; the acquisition of House No. 3 (Lot No. 6/Ordos) into the permanent collection of The Art Institute of Chicago; and the selection of Pavilion No. 4 (Afterparty) for the 2009 MoMA PS1 Young Architects Program. Recent work includes: House No. 10, a private residence in Upstate New York; an all-aluminum open-air school for children in Versailles, France; and the Laboratorio de Vivienda, a 9-acre master plan and welcome center in Apan, Mexico. Recent and forthcoming publications, both products of and surveys on MOS’s work, include MOS: Selected Works (Princeton Architectural Press, 2016); El Croquis No. 184 (2016); An Unfinished Encyclopedia of Scale Figures Without Architecture (MIT Press, 2019); and Houses for Sale (CCA/Corraini, 2019).\n\nYOUR RESTROOM IS A BATTLEGROUND\n\nYour Restroom Is A Battleground builds upon the collective experience of the four participating teams. Matilde Cassani addresses toilets in the framework of her interest in the spatial implications of everyday multiculturalism in the contemporary Western city. Ignacio G. Galán considers the relationship of architecture and politics and frames the study of restrooms in response to assimilationist and technocratic ideologies —following his work on nationalism and migration and his interest in critical access and anti-ableism. Ivan L. Munuera explores the intersection between culture, technology, politics, and bodily practices, understanding restrooms as collective embodiments, challenging their materiality to understand them as both infiltrating and being infiltrated by technologies, beings, regulations, and policies. The contribution of Joel Sanders, principal of JSA/MIXdesign is informed by Stalled!, a cross-disciplinary design/research project consisting of toolkits and prototypes for safe, accessible public restrooms that meet the needs of differently embodied and identified people regardless of age, gender, race, faith or disability.\n\nSTRAT COFFMAN\n\nStrat Coffman uses the multi-facing tools of architecture to explore how capital, institutions, and design discourses conspire to produce material, social, and epistemic bodies. They were a 2022-2024 Architecture Fellow at University of Michigan. They hold a BA from Wesleyan University and M.Arch from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where they received the Imre Halasz Thesis Prize and the AIA Henry Adams Medal. They have also received the 2024 Architectural League Prize. Their work has appeared in Log, the MIT List Visual Arts Center, and the Multimedia Anthropology Lab at University College London. They were previously an editor of Thresholds 48: Kin, a fellow at the MIT Transmedia Storytelling Initiative, and a 2023 artist-in-residence at the Goethe Institut.\n\nExhibition Guide\n\nPlease click here to download the exhibition guide to Entourage.\n\nOpening Reception Saturday, June 22, 2024\n\nRelated Event\n\nEntourage is made possible, with generous support from the Los Angeles County Department of Arts and Culture and the California Arts Council\n\nView Event →\n\nFinal Projects: Group LV\n\nThe MAK Center for Art and Architecture is pleased to announce Final Projects: Group LV, exhibiting bodies of work produced by our Artists and Architects-in-Residence, Uwe Brunner, Dominic Schwab, Karl Holmqvist, Michèle Pagel, and Kris Lemsalu. Final Projects: Group LV marks the culmination of the 55th iteration of the Artists and Architects-in-Residence Program at the Mackey Apartments.\n\nUwe Brunner and Dominic Schwab\n\nFor their Final Project, Uwe Brunner and Dominic Schwab, in collaboration with Bettina Katja Lange, reinterpret the Mackey Apartments as the pseudo-headquarters of the real estate media group Vapors to explore the correlations between the real estate market and the social media landscape in Los Angeles. Inspired by the city's commercial aesthetics and the prevalence of prop-tech platforms, they rebranded the property through both physical and digital interventions. The most prominent feature is a Vapors hot air balloon hovering above the property's courtyard, drawing attention as a landmark and a visual satire of LA’s eternal allure of sunset sales.\n\nAdditionally, the apartment building features a projection of their life writing process, undertaken during their residency. This interactive and spatial journal, composed of everyday fragments, offers a window into their lives and research at the Mackey Apartments, emphasizing the building's role as yet another Content House within the urban landscape of Los Angeles.\n\nUwe Brunner\n\nUwe Brunner is an architect, teacher, and researcher based in Vienna. He studied architecture at the Technical University of Vienna, at the School of the Arts Amsterdam, and received his master’s degree in arts and architecture from the Academy of Fine Arts in Vienna. From 2019 to 2024, he was a faculty member at ./studio3, Institute for Experimental Architecture at the University of Innsbruck. He is a co-founder of SOAP, an online architecture practice, and a co-founder of the Vienna Architecture Summer School. He is currently pursuing a PhD, focusing on the essay, its affective and cognitive modalities, and its potential for space-making within digital environments. His work has been widely screened and exhibited, including at the New Media Art Museum La Gaîté Lyrique in Paris, Centre d'Art Santa Mònica in Barcelona, CPH:DOX - Copenhagen International Documentary Film Festival, ETH Zurich, the Goethe-Institut in Beijing, and The Segal Center in New York, among many more.\n\nDOMINIC SCHWAB\n\nDominic Schwab is an architect, teacher and researcher based in Vienna. He studied architecture at Vienna University of Technology, and holds a master degree in arts and architecture from the Academy of Fine Arts in Vienna. Since 2020, he has been a faculty member at the ./studio3, Institute for Experimental Architecture at the University of Innsbruck. He is currently pursuing a PhD with a research focus on the spectrality of media-technologies and how they inform, constitute & alter the archival paradigm in the age of digital media abundance. His work has been widely screened and exhibited, including Ars Electronica Barcelona Garden 2021, AUT Innsbruck 2021, Greenwich Heritage Gallery London 2016, Wien Museum 2016, Rundgang Academy of Fine Arts Vienna 2016/17/18 amongst others.He is co-founder of SOAP, some online architecture practice, co-founder of the Vienna Architecture Summer School and co-founder and board member of PARABOL, an association that aims at advancing artistic research.\n\nKarl Holmqvist\n\nKarl Holmqvist will present a new film, Meshes of the Mackey Apts, a remake and a tribute to the classic Maya Deren 1943 silent b/w film Meshes of the Afternoon shown together with preparatory drawings and props from the shoot. Additionally during his stay, Holmqvist has been writing poetry as a kind of journal or Los Angeles city portrait that he will present as a mini booklet OCEAN’S 24/7ELEVEN and spoken word performance during opening night.\n\nKarl Holmqvist lives and works in Berlin. His work often includes writing in artist’s books, installations, video and performance. Recent one-person exhibitions include Laxart, Los Angeles, Fridericianum, Kassel, Centre d’Art Contemporaine, Geneva, Indipendenza, Rome (with Klara Liden).

Karl Holmqvist’s works can be found in the collections of Moderna Museet, Stockholm, Le Musée d’Art Moderna de la Ville de Paris, Paris, Fridericianum, Kassel and Kunstverein für die Rheinlande und Westfalen, Düsseldorf among many other public and private collections.\n\nMichèle Pagel and Kris Lemsalu\n\nDuring her residency, Pagel investigated current and local political issues like social justice, classism, nationalism, white suprematism, and cultural differentiations. Working with locally sourced objects, she focuses on the universality of human body images to highlight the contradictions of national pride. She uses painting and collage technique to reflect the ills of white supremacy on the nation.\n\nLemsalu presents two sculptures, Woundlicker and Amber Takes A Long Time. Woundlicker is constructed of ceramics, wood and special woven textiles. The woven structures are done in collaboration with local artists. Amber Takes A Long Time utilizes vintage traffic light from Hollywood film sets along with ceramics, wood, and mixed media. In both works Lemsalu incorporates the landscape of the inner psyche and the local communities.\n\nCollaboratively, Pagel and Lemsalu produced a cyanotype textile wall piece that looks to form solidarity amongst artists and all creative powers.\n\nFor the exhibition opening, Pagel invites the music composer Mariela Gutierrez with her project SITES to perform live as part of her underground Cassette-Label “RatRights”.\n\nMICHÈLE PAGEL\n\nMichèle Pagel has been working as a freelance sculptress in Vienna since 2012. In 2015, they started teaching sculpture as an University Assistant at the ceramics department at the Art University in Linz, Austria. Pagel continued this teaching job until 2019, and also ventured a three month field trip to Uganda, Afrika in 2018. In 2021, they established a self-employed company in order to professionalize their artistic career and to concentrate exclusively on their own projects and exhibitions. The same year, Pagel started collaborating with the Viennese Gallery, MeyerKainer which is representing their work in solo exhibitions and art fairs. Pagel has participated in various international group shows and showcased their artworks in several European Museums and Institutions.\n\nKRIS LEMSALU\n\nKris Lemsalu was born in 1985 in Tallinn, Estonia, and lives and works between Vienna and Tallin.

Berger devised a faux-scientific graph that connects clothing styles and dimensions with economic and moral qualities: length pertaining to relative wealth, width pertaining to relative propriety. In an initial series of graphic wall pieces, she labeled the roughly body sized line drawings based on her graph with corresponding word combinations such as “wealthy and lewd” or “poor and proper”.\n\nThe new series for her project in LA attempts the abstraction of these line drawings into graphic shapes applied in fabric based stitched wall panels and by consequence a blurring of their if purely fictional pretension at the legibility of clothing signs.\n\nAnna-Sophie Berger (b. 1989, Vienna, Austria) is an artist living and working in New York and Vienna. She has had solo exhibitions at MAK, Vienna (2023); Bonner Kunstverein, Bonn (2020); Cell Project Space, London (2019); MUMOK, Vienna (2016); Kunsthaus Bregenz (2016); Ludlow 38, NY (2015); White Flag Projects, St. Louis (2015); and Belvedere21, Vienna (2014); among others. She has recently participated in group exhibitions at the Pictures Collection of the Academy of Fine Arts, Vienna (2022); The Glucksman, Cork (2022); MACRO Museum, Rome (2021); MAK, Austria (2019); Kunsthalle Wien, Vienna (2019); Frans Hals Museum, Haarlem (2018); S.M.A.K., Ghent (2018); Contemporary Art Centre, Vilnius (2018); Kestnergesellschaft, Hannover (2017); Kunstverein Munchen, Munich (2017). She is the recipient of the 2017 Ars Viva Fine Arts Prize in Germany and the 2016 Kapsch Contemporary Art Prize, Austria and a 2023 recipient of the Pollock Krasner grant.\n\nBIANCA GAMSER\n\nUtilizing origin myths about the beginning of architecture, Bianca Gamser works to interrogate these supposed narratives, dating back to Vitruvius. At their core, this historical framing works in two parts, to separate humans from their natural environment; architecture as a shelter from weather; and to build a position to rebuke; the modernist incorporation of surroundings into the architecture itself. The latter can also be seen in R.M. Schindler’s writings, “The man of the future does not try to escape the elements. He will rule them.” Through the lens of contemporary construction practices and its harmful effects on the environment, the notion of architecture providing refuge from nature has turned into its active destruction of the natural environment. The effects can also be seen through unusual weather patterns, including recents years of heavy rainfall in Southern California, following years of drought.\n\nGamser ties these ideas together by making the architecture itself the collection site and source of rainfall. Rather than architecture as a protective force from the natural environment, R.M. Schindler’s Modernist Mid-City Mackey Apartments functions as the ecosystem which produces rain. Here the separations outlined in the origin myth dissolve to create a holistic architecture that works with the environment, rather than against it.\n\nBianca Gamser, is a Vienna-based architect and art historian who studied at both the Vienna University of Technology and the University of Vienna. Gamser's work aims to highlight potentials and grievances through the tools of architecture, often through interventions in public space.\n\nShe has participated in exhibitions and workshops in Europe, including the Lakeside Dancers Club, based on a design by Yoshiharu Tsukamoto, Atelier Bow-Wow for HORST arts & music festival in Holsbeek, at the Vienna Biennale with the installation Ephemeral Temporalities and the Vienna Design Week with the group work VEBSHTUL. Several of her works, including her latest installation STILL FRIEDEN were awarded with grants and special recognitions. Besides her artistic practice at the intersection of art and architecture, Gamser has been active in various Viennese collectives, works as a set designer and has taught at the Vienna University of Technology.\n\nEVAN IFEKOYA\n\nThursday, March 7, 6-8pm, Mackey Apartments\n\nFriday, March 8, 11am-2pm, Original Muscle Beach, Santa Monica\n\nSaturday, March 9, 11am-2pm, Original Muscle Beach, Santa Monica\n\nSunday, March 10, 2-6pm, Mackey Apartments\n\nThrough their engagement with the city, Evan Ifekoya traces the history of Los Angeles public exercise spaces and centers strength training as a physical and spiritual guide. As public spaces that focus on the development and presentation of the body, Ifekoya prioritizes bodies that are often marginalized from these spaces.\n\nConstructing an intervention over two sites, their live/work space at the Mackey Apartments and Original Muscle Beach, Santa Monica, Ifekoya brings ‘Calabash, Kettlebell and Cascarilla’ - an interactive installation and guided audio journey.\n\nAt the Original Muscle Beach, Santa Monica (the 1930s era outdoor gym, not to be confused with the later Muscle Beach Venice Beach) Ifekoya brings an interactive sound installation and provides guidance on pull up progressions and other ways of making use of the equipment. With an emphasis on the importance of good technique and form; this interactive installation offers affirmation, encouragement, and support within an intimidating environment for those not familiar.\n\nThrough these interventions, Ifekoya makes a ceremony of adaptation and strength, creating a dialogue between notions of health and harmony.\n\nEvan Ifekoya is an interdisciplinary artist seeking greater embodiment for all, through sound. Their work in community organizing, installation, performance, text and video is an extension of their calling as a spiritual practitioner. They view art as a site where resources can be both redistributed and renegotiated, whilst challenging the implicit rules and hierarchies of public and social space. Strategies of space holding through architectural interventions, ritual and immersive sonic installations enable them to make a practice of living in order not to turn to despair.\n\nThey established the collectively run and QTIBPOC (queer, trans*, intersex, black and people of color) led Black Obsidian Sound System (B.O.S.S.) in 2018. Upcoming presentations include immersive installations for ARoS Denmark (2023), Lagos Biennial and ICA VCU (both 2024). They have presented exhibitions, moving image and performances across UK, Europe and Internationally, most recently: Guest Artist Space Lagos (2023), a solo exhibition at Migros Museum, Zurich and a moving image commission with LUX in collaboration with University of Reading (2022); Herbert Art Gallery and Museum as nominees of the Turner Prize (with B.O.S.S. 2021); Gus Fischer New Zealand (2020); De Appel Netherlands (2019) and Gasworks London (2018).\n\nRelated Events\n\nThursday, March 7, 2024\n\n6-8 pm\n\nThe Artists & Architects-in-Residence Program at the Mackey Apartments is funded by the Federal Ministry for Arts, Culture, the Civil Service and Sport, in cooperation with the MAK — Museum of Applied Arts, Vienna.\n\nView Event →\n\nVALIE EXPORT: Embodied\n\nVALIE EXPORT’s work has redefined the fields of conceptual art, performance, and expanded cinema. Since the 1960s, her early projects have blurred the boundaries between photography and documentation, performance and action, often by utilizing the female body as prop and provocation to classical regimes of architecture. The ‘photo-graphic’ series, Body Configurations (1972-1976) captures direct interventions through bodily insertions into public space. VALIE EXPORT: Embodied presents select works from this seminal series, reflecting her early investigations into the politics of space, image-making, and the body as both an ideological and technological device. Accompanying the photographic series in the exhibition are two video works by VALIE EXPORT, Adjunct Dislocations (1973) and Syntagma (1984), which present the artist’s filmic inquiries into the real and the representational.\n\nWorking across the mediums of performance, film, photography, video, sculpture, and installations, EXPORT’s work engages with the construction and representation of the female body, confronting ideas of sexuality, intimacy, and transgression in both private and public arenas. Her first solo presentation in Los Angeles since 2001, the exhibition centers on EXPORT's early artistic explorations, expanding on the production of meaning and materiality in film, photography, and performance, while challenging the social function of women and the ideologies of space and the built environment.\n\nThe exhibition positions these influential works in dialogue with a contemporary performance program featuring Los Angeles-based artists responding to VALIE EXPORT’s work and the Schindler House.\n\nVALIE EXPORT\n\nA pioneer in film, video and installation art, VALIE EXPORT has produced one of the most significant bodies of feminist art in the post-war period. Her groundbreaking films and performances in the 1960s and 1970s introduced a new form of radical, embodied feminism to Europe, examining the politics of the body in relation to its environment, culture and society. The multi-disciplinary nature of EXPORT's 'Expanded Cinema' practice and use of her own body as an artistic medium positions her as one of the earliest performance artists alongside Joseph Beuys and Allan Kaprow.\n\nVALIE EXPORT lives and works in Vienna, where she co-founded the Austrian Filmmakers Cooperative. Since 1968, she has taken part in numerous international exhibitions, including documenta 6 and 12 (1977 and 2007) and the Austrian Pavilion at the Venice Biennale in 1980. In recent years, the Staatliche Kunsthalle Baden-Baden (2020); Neue Berliner Kunstverein (2018); Lentos Kunstmuseum Linz (2017); Kunsthaus Bregenz (2011); Belvedere Museum, Vienna (2010); Israel Museum, Jerusalem (2009); and Centre Pompidou, Paris (2007) have devoted major solo exhibitions to her work. EXPORT has taught at a number of international institutions, including the University of Wisconsin, San Francisco Art Institute and University of the Arts in Berlin. From 1995–2005 she was professor of multimedia and performance at the Academy of Media Arts in Cologne. In 2019, she was awarded the Roswitha Haftmann Prize in recognition of her outstanding contributions to the visual arts. VALIE EXPORT received the Max-Beckmann-Prize of the City of Frankfurt 2022.\n\nRelated Events\n\nWednesday, February 28, 2024\n\n6—8 pm\n\nSunday, March 10, 2024\n\n12—1 pm\n\nSaturday, March 23, 2024\n\n11 am—6 pm\n\nFriday, March 29, 2024\n\n7—9 pm\n\nSaturday, March 30, 2024\n\n7—9 pm\n\nVALIE EXPORT: Embodied is organized by MAK Center Director Jia Yi Gu with Seymour Polatin, Exhibitions and Programs Manager, Brian Taylor, Curatorial Assistant, and Maeve Atkinson, Education and Engagement Coordinator.\n\nThe performance program In Their Own Image is curated by Chloë Flores and features new work by performing artists Zackary Drucker, Sierra Fujita, Emily Lucid, Lara Salmon, Andrea Soto, and Dorian Wood.

Print Ready Drawings investigates the process behind these printed images. Emblematic of this period, composite and mechanical documents were produced from graphic supplies such as photographic papers, Letraset transfer sheets, Rapidograph pen sets, and other graphic templates. The exhibition features prints and reproductions, exploring a history of architectural authorship not via singular authors but through an examination and display of the material supplies and techniques of drawing production.\n\nFrom “instant pictures” to “rapidraw” systems, the items crowding the architect’s desk from the mid-century reflected a preoccupation with speed and efficiency. With a flourishing of supplies and materials that transformed the work of many in the graphic fields, this was a period in which architects engaged widely with technologies of printing and printmaking. Whether in the service of the distribution of working drawings, or in the making of carefully stamped lithographic multiples, architects worked to make their architecture print ready.\n\nThrough a selection of 12 case studies, Print Ready Drawings highlights these miniature paper landscapes. Across their surfaces are expressions of control: annotation marks, enlargement instructions, manufacturer tags, and watermarks, along with evidence of any number of unacknowledged contributors.\n\nDrawings in this exhibition are viewed as microcosms of the material world, and their convergence in each document tells a social and production history of architectural work. Their organization into technical affinities produces curious pairings, like Lina Bo Bardi and Roger Katan, whose magazine cover designs constitute parallel case studies of contextual and material appropriation. Other groupings include scientific illustrator Gloria Brown Simmons, Eames Office, and Herbert Bayer’s World Geo-Graphic Atlas.\n\nPrint Ready Drawings also includes a variety of production ephemera, technical manuals, and samples, alongside artist’s films that turned the camera inward towards the process itself, including Richard Serra’s Color-Aid film. Several drawings featured in the exhibition, considered too fragile to be exhibited, are replicated through a process of material and technical research in conservation labs, manufacturing workshops, eBay, and oral histories. This research is documented in films made by Julie Riley and Jenny Leavitt that interpret and translate historical materials and modes of making.\n\nThe site of architectural authorship has long been found in drawings. By anonymizing the technical and foregrounding original marks and signatures, drawings played a crucial role in prioritizing cognitive acts over material labor — thus obscuring their intersection. This exhibition examines the architectural drawing as the arena of architectural work—the mundane, the repetitive, and the documents that convey how architects navigate the borders between private work and what is destined to be public.\n\nGuest Curator: Sarah Hearne\n\nSaturday, November 11, 2023\n\n6–8 pm\n\nRelated Events\n\nSunday, January 21, 2024\n\n12—2:30 pm\n\nSaturday, February 3, 2024\n\n3—4:30 pm\n\nPrint Ready Drawings is curated by Sarah Hearne, with curatorial assistance by Arianna Borromeo and support from the MAK Center exhibitions team Seymour Polatin, Exhibitions and Programs Manager and Brian Taylor, Curatorial Assistant.

The residency ended and moved on to the subsequent groups of residents, but the palm tree remained, under the care of the institution, where it remains today.\n\nIn this exhibition, Christian Kosmas Mayer, joined by Los Angeles-based artist Gala Porras-Kim, revisits this living sculpture for an in-depth exploration of the functions and roles of the art institution. Both Mayer and Porras-Kim utilize the exhibition space as a site to foster discourse and critique how art institutions exercise forms of care within collecting practices. The MAK Center is a unique context as it is a non-collecting exhibition space, but it preserves and cares for three R. M. Schindler designed properties in Los Angeles. In this sense, the exhibition spaces are the collection.\n\nThis unique relationship between exhibition space and care practice forms the basis of and yet you grow. Porras-Kim's Forecasting Signal is a site-activated sculpture that extracts ambient water from the gallery environment and filters it through a hanging burlap sheet saturated with graphite, extended from the ceiling. As the water accumulates, it drips through the material onto a panel where it makes an image. This process occurs repeatedly through the duration of the exhibition, and turns the exhibition space itself into what could be considered a process-based drawing.\n\nIn dialogue with Forecasting Signal is Out of an instance of expiration comes a perennial showing, which also utilizes the environmental conditions of the space, introducing spores from the British Museum storage onto muslin fabric, encased within an acrylic shell. Over the course of the exhibition, a mold grows from these spores and becomes increasingly visible. While the spores originate from the British Museum, an institution with a long and fraught history of collecting practices, the mold grows in the exhibition at the MAK Center’s Mackey Apartment Garage Top Gallery, raising questions about the interconnectedness of art institutions.\n\nAlong with the palm tree, Mayer brings another tree into this exhibition, a sapling he grew in 2016 from the acorn of a majestic oak tree that lives in the yard of a small family house in Los Angeles’s Koreatown. This oak, one of the renowned 'Olympic Oaks' presented to all gold medal winners at the 1936 Olympic Games in Berlin, was planted by African American high jump champion Cornelius Johnson upon his return home. Over time, the historical significance of this tree was lost until Mayer uncovered this hidden history through his research.\n\nOver the course of two years, Mayer worked in collaboration with the MAK Center and the California African American Museum for the preservation of this tree, resulting in its designation as a Historic Cultural Monument by the City of Los Angeles in 2022. However, despite this achievement, the destiny of the Olympic oak remains uncertain as the tree has declined in health due to neglect from a new property owner. Now, the young potted oak included in this exhibition, may soon be the solitary living ancestor to this historic legacy.\n\nIn and yet you grow, Mayer and Porras-Kim work to reposition the roles of the artist as life givers, and question the traditional role of the curator as collection caretaker safeguarding inanimate objects. Both of these works by Porras-Kim have been exhibited before in other institutions, but each retain a site specificity based on the environmental conditions in which they are shown. Complementing these pieces, Mayer’s site-specific interventions continue his investigation of institutional responsibility and break down the traditional roles of artist practice, curatorship, and architectural intervention. In the context of the palm tree, which now has become a part of the Mackey Apartments, Mayer inverts the Modern critique of museums being places where art dies, and situates the art institution as a site for continued life. In this exhibition, the MAK Center becomes a nursery—birthing, feeding, and parenting artworks with a life of their own.\n\nABOUT GARAGE EXCHANGE\n\nGarage Exchange Vienna—Los Angeles seeks to foster relationships, conversations and collaborations in the arts between Los Angeles and Austria. In order to expand the cultural exchange at the core of the Artists and Architects-in-Residence program, the Austrian Federal Chancellery and the MAK Center invite Austrian and Vienna-based alumni residents to collaborate with L.A. artists and architects of their choosing at the Garage Top at the Mackey Apartments for the Garage Exchange Vienna-Los Angeles exhibition series.\n\nArtists\n\nChristian kosmas mayer\n\nChristian Kosmas Mayer (b. 1976, Sigmaringen, Germany) lives and works in Vienna, Austria. His work produces and preserves a constellation of narratives about historical remains and representations that are often on the verge of disappearing, or have already been rendered imperceptible. Mayer’s projects, which are the outcome of extensive artistic research and close collaborations with specialists across various disciplines, transform the minor, forgotten, and obsolescent into material artifacts, discursive objects, multi-media installations, and performances. Linking technology to memory and care, his practice explores the methods by which important issues can be approached in conceptually and aesthetically surprising ways: techniques of reversal, of compressing and stretching time, of looking at things from both ends at once.\n\nHe has had solo exhibitions at Vienna’s mumok – Museum moderner Kunst Stiftung Ludwig Wien, Austria ; Belvedere Museum, Vienna, Austria; Austrian Cultural Forum New York, USA; MAK Center, Los Angeles, USA; University Gallery of the Custody, Dresden, Germany; Zamek Culture Center, Poznan, Poland; Kunststiftung Baden-Württemberg, Stuttgart, Germany; Austrian Cultural Forum Warsaw, Poland; Galerie Nagel Draxler, Berlin, Germany; Galerie Mezzanin, Geneva, Switzerland and participated in biennales and group exhibitions such as the 26th Bienal de São Paulo, Brazil; Manifesta 7, Rovereto, Italy; Vienna Biennale 2019, Austria; Biennale Gherdëina 2016, Italy; Kunstmuseum Bonn, Germany; Kunstmuseum Stuttgart, Germany; Marta Herford, Germany; Leopoldmuseum, Vienna, Austria; Torrance Art Museum, Los Angeles, USA; ZKM I Center for Art and Media Karlsruhe, Germany; Kunsthalle Wien, Vienna, Austria; Secession, Vienna, Austria; and numerous other venues.\n\nGala Porras-Kim\n\nGala Porras-Kim (b. 1984, Bogotá) lives and works in Los Angeles and London. Her work is about the social and political contexts that influence how intangible things, such as sounds, language and history, have been framed through the fields of linguistics, history and conservation. The work considers the way institutions shape inherited codes and forms and conversely, how objects can shape the contexts in which they are placed.\n\nPorras-Kim received an MFA from CalArts and an MA in Latin American Studies from UCLA. She has had solo exhibitions at Museo Universitario de Arte Contemporáneo (MUAC), Mexico City, The Fowler Museum, Los Angeles, Centro Andaluz de Arte Contemporaneo, Seville, Kadist, Amant Foundation, Gasworks, London, and CAMSTL, and upcoming at Leeum Museum of Art and MMCA, Seoul, MCA Denver, and Carnegie Museum of Art. Her work has been included in the Whitney Biennial and Ural Industrial Biennial (2019), and Gwangju and Sao Paulo Biennales (2021) and Liverpool Biennial (2023). She was a Fellow at the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study at Harvard University (2019), the artist-in-residence at the Getty Research Institute (2020-22), and currently a fellow at Museo delle Civiltà in Rome.\n\nRelated event\n\nThursday, October 19, 2024\n\n6–8 pm\n\nThis exhibition series is made possible by The Austrian Federal Chancellery.\n\nInstallation images: Tag Christof.\n\nView Event →\n\nFinal Projects: Group LIII\n\nThe MAK Center for Art and Architecture is pleased to announce Final Projects: Group LIII, exhibiting three works produced by our Artists and Architects-in-Residence, Simona Ferrari, Céline Brunko, and Philipp Fleischmann.

The artists confront the legacy of Modernist idealism that Schindler considers in his architectural work alongside the proliferation of mass-produced materials.\n\nPlastic, Plastic, Plastic\n\nText by Angella d’Avignon\n\n“The German poet and playwright Bertolt Brecht hated the Westside. He hated Hollywood, the only part of Los Angeles he seemed to be familiar with. When he arrived in 1941, Santa Monica was flat while he lived there—nothing but manicured lawns and oil derricks in dust fields.\n\nThe Mackey Apartments are replicated* at Disney World in Florida to signify a modern California apartment—the platonic ideal of apartments, landmarked as classic Los Angeles architecture although they were built in the last eighty or so years. The idea that California held the dream of the mythic West itself in its \"empty\" landscape, that acreage could ensure legacy, that private property meant success. These precious places built by eccentrics and exiles, polished apartments made for one specific person, sit empty most of the time, while renters drift in and out of sublets and single family studios. These interiors hold other people's boring day to day existences, hovering together anachronistic in the psychic space of a room.\n\nIn Los Angeles, you can tell the time of the month by the amount of furniture on the sidewalk—entire sofa sets, wayward mattresses, coffee tables and glass cabinets. Recognizable objects from one's interior is a kind of body horror—I once spotted a stack of metallic plastic cups I'd bought for my first apartment in my twenties from a store I thought was expensive. No one else had party cups like mine at the time, yet here they are on someone else's stairs, outside someone else's apartment that looks replicable, like it could be anywhere in suburban Southern California.\n\nThe word polymer means ‘of many parts,’ and polymers are made of long chains of molecules. Polymers abound in nature. Cellulose, the material that makes up the cell walls of plants, is a common natural polymer. Synthetic polymers are made up of long chains of atoms, arranged in repeating units, often much longer than natural ones. The length of these chains, and the patterns in which they are arrayed, make polymers strong, lightweight, and flexible. In other words, it’s what makes them so plastic.\n\nPlastic ensured that human manufacturing would never be limited by the resources offered by the natural world. Roland Barthes called plastic ‘miraculous,’ writing that ‘plastic is the very idea of its infinite transformation,’ since any substance—ivory, tortoiseshell, glass—could be made from plastic. Barthes continues, ‘The hierarchy of substances is abolished: a single one replaces them all: the whole world can be plasticized, and even life itself since, we are told, they are beginning to make plastic aortas.’ The 21st century world is saran wrapped: by 2050, the ocean will be more plastic than water.\n\nWhile plastic wooed the mid-century U.S, long-chains of houses proliferated across Brecht's hellish flat fields, entire neighborhoods sprouting up like manicured weeds, filling with mass manufactured domestic housewares made in consumer-grade plastic, taunting the poet's former presence in Los Angeles, after he fled again for his native Germany after 15 years of exile in the U.S. during World War II. Layers of layers of daily life held forth in these houses and apartments, each one haunting the next generation while the plastic utensils, hair combs, high chairs, bed pans, and party cups outlive every vision of utopia that anyone's had about Los Angeles since.\n\nThe narrative of transience is scaled by class. The burdens of precarity and desire meet in the well-appointed interiors whose objects' total value will never outweigh the endlessly unaffordable exterior in which they're housed. We are not the objects we consume but rather the paths we tread through spaces anonymous to anyone who treads them in our absence.”\n\n* While the Prime Time Cafe at Disney World’s Hollywood Studios is not an exact replica of the Mackey Apartments, the Imagineers used it as inspiration to construct a general set of modern California apartments representing idealized mid-century living.\n\nKERSTIN VON GABAIN\n\nKerstin von Gabain, born 1979 in Palo Alto, California, lives and works in Vienna. She graduated from the Academy of Fine Arts Vienna (2003). Recent solo and duo exhibitions include Imitation, EXILE Vienna (2023); Compliments, Wieoftnoch, Karlsruhe (2021); Umeå, V.esch, Vienna (2021); I’ll see you when I see you, EXILE Vienna (2021); Dark Euphoria, Austrian Museum of Applied Arts, Vienna (2021); Happiness Machines (2020).

The exhibition takes as subject Zohn’s robust civic and commercial architecture built in Guadalajara from the 1950s to the 1990s, with an interest in how the city’s social, cultural, and material histories are interwoven with his structures.\n\nCommissioned photography and video by artists Adam Wiseman, Lake Verea, Onnis Luque, Sonia Madrigal, and Zara Pfeifer veer from the documentary conceit of architectural photography toward the subjective. This work is decidedly interpretive, seeking out the many narratives contained within parks, markets, collective housing, malls, and bureaucratic buildings. Zohn, a Jewish emigree who fled Vienna during World War II at the age of 8, dedicated his career to creating a modern Guadalajara. Through these photographs—acts of investigation and translation—we find glimpses of his utopian desire amidst the chaos, beauty, and violence of everyday life.\n\nSeeking Zohn is the first presentation of Zohn’s architecture in Los Angeles. The transposition of his work to L.A. places it in dialogue with R.M. Schindler’s designs. As both architects are Jewish émigrés, a parallel exists between the Austrian-Mexican and the Austrian-Angeleno’s experiences. The installation at the MAK Center creates a resonant triangulation between three cities: Vienna, Guadalajara, and Los Angeles. Billboards placed in the garden navigate between the urban scale of Zohn’s buildings and the intimacy of the Schindler House. Household objects designed by Studio Fabien Cappello and fabricated by artisans in Guadalajara build a bridge between the civic and domestic realms.\n\nAs a practitioner, Zohn is a lesser-known figure outside of Mexico, and his work has yet to be widely published or exhibited in the United States. A generation after fellow Guadalajara-born architect Luis Barragán and Mexican-Spanish architect Félix Candela, much of Zohn’s architecture aligns with late modernism, a period that’s recently come under re-evaluation. With this consideration comes an expansion of the conventional parallels drawn between Los Angeles and Mexico, which often focuses on designs and actors associated with midcentury modernism. While Zohn’s early career shows the influence of Candela’s thin-shell concrete arches, which he called “cascarones,” his later designs are marked by expressive structural gestures, forming a singular geometric vocabulary that carries from project to project and a sensitivity to the social conditions of the urban fabric.\n\nNotable projects in Seeking Zohn include his most famous building, Mercado Libertad­–San Juan de Dios (1958-9), an indoor public market first proposed as his thesis project; the bandshell Concha Acústica (1958) in Parque Agua Azul; Unidad Deportiva Adolfo López Mateos (1956-59) sports center; the mall and parking garage Edificio Mulbar (1973-74); CTM-Atemajac (1977-79), a collective housing project; and one of his final works, Archivo del Estado de Jalisco (1985-91), a state office building and archive. Artists were each assigned a site for photographic inquiry, and the results suggest an architecture bound to the stories and conditions of an evolving city. These works are accompanied by select images, publications, and artifacts from Zohn’s archive, courtesy of his daughter, Diana Zohn Cevallos.\n\nArtists\n\nonnis luque, mexico city\n\nOnnis Luque is an architectural photographer who studied architecture at The National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM). His work has been published in various magazines such as Domus, Arquine, MONU, Architectural Digest, and PLOT and has been included in several architectural biennials and competitions. His book, USF / DF Appropriation Tactics (CONACULTA / Ediciones Acapulco 2014), documents several years of photographing the Santa Fe Housing Unit in his native home of Mexico City.\n\nAdam Wiseman, Mexico City/London\n\nAdam Wiseman (Mexico City 1970) is a graduate of the International Center of Photography in New York and a former printer at Magnum Photos. His relationship to photojournalism has marked his distinctive career. Wiseman’s subjects are interposed with his understanding of image as something between document and intersubjectivity. He is a Senior Lecturer at the University of East London and divides his time between Mexico City and London, giving lectures and workshops while developing new work.\n\nLake Verea, Mexico City\n\nLake Verea is an artist duet formed in 2005 by Francisca Rivero-Lake and Carla Verea. Their work explores concepts of expanded photography through installation, textile, performance, sculpture, and video. By experimenting with photographic techniques and formats that blur questions of authorship, they build narratives that highlight their combined identity to create intimate portraits of architecture, artists’ archives, and people. They’ve poured through the archives of Mexican artist Frida Kahlo, architect Luis Barragán, and German émigrés Josef and Anni Albers, amongst others. Lake Verea’s 2011-2018 “Paparazza Moderna” project explores the idea of architecture as a living being through portraits of single-family houses designed by modernist architects Walter Gropius, Marcel Breuer, Richard Neutra, Rudolph M. Schindler, Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, and Philip Johnson.\n\nsonia madrigal, mexico\n\nSonia Madrigal lives and works in Ciudad Nezahualcóyotl. Her work explores different visual narratives that reflect on personal and collective concepts of gender, the body, violence, and territory, with a locational focus on the East Metropolitan Zone of Mexico City. She is part of the Sistema Nacional de Creadores de Arte/National System of Art Creators (FONCA). In 2018, she participated in the XVIII Biennial of Photography of the Centro de la Imagen. She was awarded a residency at the Encuentro de Colectivos de Geografía Crítica y Geografías Autónomas (Ecuador, 2019). Madrigal has participated in exhibitions across Latin America, Europe, and the US and published her work in Harper's, Aperture, and The Guardian.\n\nzara pfeifer\n\nZara Pfeifer is an artist based in Vienna and Berlin whose work is concerned with the social phenomena of large-scale infrastructure. Her documentation of the modernist housing project Alterlaa (“Du, meine konkrete Utopie,” 2013-17) and her series on truck drivers (“Good Street!,” 2018-2022) involves extended periods of immersion in the day-to-day life of her subjects. She has worked with institutions, including the MAK Center in Los Angeles and the Austrian Cultural Forum in Berlin. Her publications include Monocle, ZEITmagazin, and Monopol, and she has received a studio grant at ISCP New York from the Austrian Federal Government. Her book ICC Berlin was published in 2022 by Jovis Verlag. Pfeifer studied architecture at the Academy of Fine Arts Vienna and photography at the Friedl Kubelka School for Artistic Photography in Vienna. She holds lecturing positions at the Technical University Vienna and the Technical University Berlin.\n\nSTUDIO FABIEN CAPPELLO\n\nFabien Cappello (France, 1984) is a furniture and product designer. He studied at the University of Art and Design (ECAL) in Lausanne, Switzerland and obtained a master’s degree in Design Products at the Royal College of Art in London in 2009 under the tutelage of Martino Gamper and Jurgen Bey.

Using a cut-up technique he blends inspiration from Manet’s pictures of women in hats in the sun, the fractured imagery from early cubism as well as the ‘cheap’ quality in Fassbinder’s ‘Beware of a Holy Whore,’ these large-scale immersive portraits of Sunrise Ruffalo encapsulate the fleeting nature of the gaze inside everyday life.\n\nAlex Katz\n\nAlex Katz (b. 1927, Brooklyn, NY) is the preeminent painter of modern life. Acclaimed for his iconic portraits and impressionistic landscape depictions, the now 95-year-old Katz has inspired generations of painters.\n\nKatz's work has been the subject of numerous retrospectives and solo presentations over the course of his expansive career. His work is in the permanent collections of over one hundred museums worldwide, including the Museum of Modern Art, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York; the Smithsonian Institute, Washington, D.C.; the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston; The Alfond Collection of Contemporary Art, Cornell Fine Arts Museum, Rollins College, Winter Park, Florida; the Art Institute of Chicago; the Tate, London; Centre Georges Pompidou, Paris; el Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofia, Madrid; the Museum of Contemporary Art Tokyo; and the Nationalgalerie, Berlin.\n\nKatz lives and works in New York. He was the 2019 Honoree at TWO x TWO for AIDS and Art and had a solo survey exhibition at the Fosun Foundation in Shanghai in 2020. Recent exhibitions include a solo show at the Museo Nacional Thyssen-Bornemisza, Madrid, and a retrospective on view at The Guggenheim in New York until February 2023.\n\nRelated events\n\nWednesday, February 15, 2023\n\n7-9 pm\n\nThis exhibition is presented with support from Gladstone Gallery.\n\nAbove Image: Alex Katz , Sunrise 12, 2021. © Alex Katz / VAGA at Artists Rights Society (ARS), NY Courtesy of the artist and Gladstone Gallery.\n\nView Event →\n\nSubject Studies: Reorientations\n\nSubject Studies’ inaugural 2022 theme, Reorientations, developed by Jia Yi Gu and Rosario Talevi, directs perspectives and questions towards MAK Center’s own institutional habits, routines and practices. With the backdrop of the roof restoration of Schindler House, Subject Studies: Reorientations seeks opportunities to reorient our own institution through perspectives of care, repair and transformation.\n\nHow do we inhibit the spaces we inherit? As a contemporary institution stewarding three historic Schindler sites, MAK Center’s mission and work encompasses a broad set of approaches to our sites, spaces, and places, often entangled with both past and present concerns: critical and experimental exhibition-making, arts and architecture organizing and pedagogy, critical preservation practices, site stewardship and climate awareness.\n\nEvery institution is a proposition, on how we understand and define art and architecture, how we inhabit preservation and heritage sites, how we uphold cultural values, how we organize resources and relations across constituencies, and most importantly, how we engage with one another’s ideas and processes.\n\nYet institutions are also notoriously slow moving, bureaucratic machines. The act of changing perspectives, attitudes, and conduct runs counter to the longevity and repetition of systems often developed to make institutions work. Such systems also demand invisible forms of labor not evident in the economy of exhibitions and events that institutions put forward.\n\nReorientations invites dialogue between artists, architects, and cultural experts and MAK Center in order to address such forms of institutional labor and collaborative practice, beyond the public presentation of projects and work, with the aim of cultivating porosity and permeability within administrative and care-taking practices of the institution and its publics.\n\nABOUT SUBJECT STUDIES\n\nSubject Studies is a new annual program series offering practical and non-practical public engagements, initiated by the MAK Center for Art and Architecture. The program series brings together artists, architects, public intellectuals, scholars, students, and cultural and political leaders to exchange dialogue on social values, methods and thought relevant to contemporary issues in art and architecture. The term “subject” implies a topic or field of knowledge studied or taught in traditional educational settings such as schools, colleges, or universities; it also implies a personhood situated in systems of power, whether institutional, economic, or material, and a consciousness of experience. Subject Studies embraces this possibility of multiple definitions, asking how knowledge, institutions and personhood intersect and are negotiated.\n\nJIA YI GU\n\nJia Yi Gu is a curator, scholar, and exhibition-maker working at the intersections of art and architecture. Her work focuses on histories of knowledge production and display practices across disciplines, with an emphasis on objects, exhibitions, and representational histories. Over the past decade, she has developed a pedagogical and curatorial practice centering on research-based exhibitions and the production of situations and environments, alongside the critique and transformation of institutional practices. She is director of MAK Center for Art and Architecture and co-director of Spinagu.\n\nROSARIO TALEVI\n\nRosario Talevi is a Berlin-based architect, curator, editor and educator interested in critical spatial practice (Rendell), transformative pedagogies and feminist futures. Her work advances architecture as a form of agency – in its transformative sense and in its capacity for acting otherwise (Schneider) and as a form of care – one that provides the political stakes to repair our broken world (Tronto). Rosario is a founding member of Soft Agency, a diasporic group of female architects, artists, curators, scholars and writers working with spatial practices and Floating e.V., the non-for-profit association organising, programming and maintaining Floating University in Berlin. She was Guest Professor of Social Design (2021-22) at the Hochschule für bildende Künste (HFBK) in Hamburg. Currently, she is a fellow at the Thomas Mann Haus in Los Angeles, California.\n\nEvents\n\nThis program is supported in part by the Department of Cultural Affairs, Los Angeles (DCA), PICE AC/E's Programme for the Internationalization of Spanish Culture and Thomas Mann House.\n\nImage Credit: TAKK Architecture.\n\nView Event →\n\nGarage Exchange: Maruša Sagadin & Jacqueline Kiyomi Gork\n\nThe MAK Center for Art and Architecture is pleased to present the twentieth iteration of Vienna — Los Angeles Garage Exchange: Maruša Sagadin & Jacqueline Kiyomi Gork. Vienna-based artist Maruša Sagadin collaborates with Los Angeles artist Jacqueline Kiyomi Gork, responding to each other’s work to develop an exhibition for the Mackey Apartments’ Garage Top gallery.\n\nSagadin and Kiyomi Gork engage in a collaborative-method of work-creation and installation, presenting new responsive sculptural and sound works for Garage Exchange.\n\nSagadin produces a new series of wall-hung architectural paper works testing the spatial and symbolic relationship between two-and three-dimensional urbanism. Advertising posters are overpainted, glued and reinforced with aluminum foil. Paper is weathered and folded and hung into fixed shapes referencing elements of the city—blinds, curtains, air conditioning units, railings, rain gutters, or fountains. The shiny aluminum juxtaposed the old and weathered painted posters, mirroring the colors to amplify past visions of the future and rays of light for warmth. These text-less color fields obfuscate the poster’s informational function, drawing attention instead to recirculation, recycling, and impermanence. Small objects playfully emphasize the surrounding context.\n\nKiyomi Gork continues their attenuator series of soft sculptures, designed to absorb unwanted sound in a space. Previously the attenuator sculptures have taken the form of figurative and geological large scale objects. The new works take an architectural focus in the form of tall wool columns stretching from the floor to ceiling.\n\nThe sculptures’ material properties complement a responsive sound work Kiyomi Gork fabricated on-site for the exhibition. Microphones in the Garage Top’s stairwell record noises made by the outdoor environment and visitors entering the space. The sound is then projected and echoed into the shared gallery, further activating the site and interacting with both of the artist’s sculptural works– amplified and softened at the same time.\n\nABOUT GARAGE EXCHANGE\n\nGarage Exchange seeks to foster relationships, conversations and collaborations in the arts between Los Angeles and Austria. In order to expand the cultural exchange at the core of the Artists and Architects-in-Residence program, The Austrian Federal Chancellery, and the MAK Center invite Austrian and Vienna-based alumni residents to collaborate with L.A. artists and architects of their choosing at the Garage Top at the Mackey Apartments for the Garage Exchange Vienna-Los Angeles exhibition series.\n\nArtists\n\nJacqueline Kiyomi Gork\n\nJacqueline Kiyomi Gork (born: 1982, Long Beach, CA) has been working with the intersection of sound, sculpture and performance since 2002. She studied sound art, photography and new genres at the San Francisco Art Institute and researched the history of communication technologies, acoustics and computer music at Stanford University where she received an MFA.\n\nKiyomi Gork has had solo exhibitions at François Ghebaly, New York; Empty Gallery in Hong Kong; The Lab and Queens Nails Projects in San Francisco and 356 Mission Rd in Los Angeles. She has been a part of group exhibitions at the Hammer Museum, GES-VAC in Moscow, SFMOMA and Sculpture Center, New York. Kiyomi Gork has participated in residencies at Skowhegan, EMPAC, Mills College and Schloss Solitude in addition to receiving multiple grants from the San Francisco Arts Commission, Center for Cultural Innovation, Joan Mitchell Foundation and LACMA Art+Tech Grant.\n\nPerformances have included multiple collaborations with Laetitia Sonami, the collective 0th and solo projects.\n\nKiyomi Gork identifies as a mixed race queer fem (she/they) whose family came to the US, four generations ago from Okinawa (Ryukyu Islands), Japan and Eastern Europe. She was born and raised in Los Angeles and Long Beach.\n\nMaruša Sagadin\n\nMaruša Sagadin was born in 1978 in Ljubljana (Slovenia) and is based in Vienna (Austria). She studied architecture at TU Graz before transitioning to performative arts and sculpture at the Academy of Fine Arts Vienna. In 2015/2016, she participated in the ISCP Grant in New York City (USA), and in 2010, she was awarded the Schindler Grant at the MAK – Center for Art and Architecture in Los Angeles (USA). From 2011 – 2017 she was Assistant Professor at the Academy of Fine Arts Vienna, in the department for Performative Arts and Sculpture.\n\nHer recent and upcoming exhibitions include Schirn Kunsthalle (Frankfurt, Germany), Museum of Applied Arts (Vienna, Austria), Cukrarna Galleries (Ljubljana, Slovenia), Christine König Gallery in Vienna, Vestjyllands Kunstpavillon (Videbæk, Denmark), SPACE London (London, United Kingdom), NADA (NYC, USA), Austrian Cultural Forum New York (NYC, USA, Warsaw), Syndicate (Cologne, Germany), Kunsthalle Wien (Vienna, Austria), Neue Galerie (Innsbruck, Austria), Museum of Contemporary Art, Ljubljana (Ljubljana, Slovenia), Belvedere21 (Vienna, Austria), Grazer Kunstverein (Graz, Austria), and Room of Requirement/Horse & Pony Fine Arts (Berlin, Germany). Her both monographs „Maruša Sagadin - ©MMXV“ (Verlag für Moderne Kunst, Vienna), 2016 and „A Happy Hippie“ (Spector Books, Leipzig), 2021 were finalist for Schönste Bücher Österreichs, a prize for books made in Austria from any discipline.\n\nMaruša Sagadin's work is built on the connections and collisions between sculpture, architecture, urban space, gender and language.\n\nMaruša Sagadins sculptures touch on playfulness, imagination, and the pop-cultural accessibility of postmodern art, while working with the motif of the body, its form, its needs, and the care it requires – both the body of the particular viewer they are concerned about (and whom they provide with seating), and the human body as the universal measure of all sculpture. The nature of Maruša Sagadin’s work is neither typical nor unusual for feminist aesthetics – it is one of its many forms. (Vit Havránek)\n\nMaruša Sagadin roams through a pop-cultural canon of urban countercultures, feminist and queer theory and modernist architecture. The compact materiality of her sculptures might be anchored in the visual language of a macho legacy of 20th-century modernism, yet she casually juggles around with these seemingly heavyweight concepts as if they were weightless, not unlike DC Comics’ Wonder Woman. Her critical reappraisal of slacker and skater cultures in correlation to a feminist artistic identity seeks for visual representation within these urban constructs, visualizing the city as a container of architectural memory – a map formed of concrete that only fully reveals its meaning when read in direct relation to its respective communities.

Inverted Dome is an inquiry into the dynamics of light, technology, and perception generated by public architecture.\n\nThe exhibition’s central feature is an installation that reimagines the U.S. Capitol Dome as an inverted, open, and almost unrecognizable structure made of mirror, reflecting back both the environment and itself. Images of the Capitol Dome are continuously propagated by media organizations of all kinds—reproduced on web pages, news broadcasts, and social feeds—as if the building’s image has come to represent structures of power that are otherwise too abstract to locate. The room-sized installation is a container for holding and focusing light and its refractions, becoming a site for reflection on virtual mediation and transparency.\n\nInverted Dome references historical works of California light and space; augmented realities; architectures of the metaverse; considerations of public and private space; presence and absence; Monument to the Third International by Vladimir Tatlin; cryptography; information theory; and the mediation of power in daily life.\n\nThe exhibition includes an installation, a sequence of digital studies released online throughout the duration of the show, and a publication, which together suggest new spatial and experiential possibilities for public architecture.\n\nInverted Dome, 2022\n\nMirrored acrylic sheet\n\n71 x 70 x 70 in.\n\nDigital Study #1 (Mirror Chain), 2022\n\nDigital sculpture\n\nRelease date: February 10, 2022\n\nInstead of the inverted U.S. Capitol Dome currently installed within the physical gallery, in this virtual world we find a length of mirrored chain that stretches from floor to ceiling. Mirror Chain references both the concept of a blockchain first advanced by Satoshi Nakamoto in Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System, and the proliferation of cryptocurrencies that have followed in its wake. One is also invited to consider the phenomena of supply chains, chains that bind, and chains that are worn in popular culture to signal wealth and status.\n\nDigital Study #2 (Azimuth Wave)\n\nDigital sculpture\n\nRelease date: February 17, 2022\n\nAzimuth is a type of angular measurement. It establishes an orientation in relation to a point of interest within a spherical coordinate system. The concept is typically used in navigation, mapping, astronomy, and other disciplines.\n\nIn everyday speech, a mirror is a surface that reflects back an inverted image of its surrounding environment. Mirrors in our homes are used for self-reflection, in our cars for navigation, and throughout cities as exterior cladding for skyscrapers. More broadly, a mirror is a wave reflector—optical mirrors reflect light waves, but other types of mirrors reflect audio or even atomic waves.\n\nDigital Study #3 (Training Phantom)\n\nDigital sculpture\n\nRelease date: February 24, 2022\n\nThe following excerpt from an interview between exhibition curator Aurora Tang and artist Kristin Posehn accompanied the digital study release:\n\nTANG: How do you see these digital studies in relation to the physical exhibition?\n\nPOSEHN: It's been a back-and-forth evolution. As I was fabricating the sculpture, installing, and then documenting it, I was also 3D modelling the gallery. It was fascinating to be in the gallery and observe how light falls in the space at different times of day, and then go to my studio and juxtapose that with how light was being rendered in the 3D environment I was building. The conversations we've had in the gallery and responses from visitors have brought up new ideas that are filtering into the studies. It's been a way for the work to continue to unfold, respond, and reflect in real time.\n\nDigital Study #4 (Chimera)\n\nDigital sculpture animation\n\nRelease date: March 3, 2022\n\nA chimera is an organism composed of multiple tissues with different genetic composition. In Greek mythology, a chimera is a hybrid being — part lion, goat, and snake. As an animation, Digital Study #4 (Chimera) morphs between three states in an infinite loop, reflecting an otherwise unseen backdrop all the while.\n\nCasting Glances with Kristin Posehn: Inverted Dome\n\nAn informal listening event, featuring a playlist of audio tracks selected by artists, including: Kathryn Andrews, Scott Benzel.
