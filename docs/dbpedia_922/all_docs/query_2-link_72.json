        "text": "Calling it a “moving and historic day,” US Sens. Richard Blumenthal and Marsha Blackburn, R-Tennessee, are celebrating the Senate’s passage this week of their bipartisan Kids Online Safety Act, which was part of a package that also included the Children’s and Teens Online Privacy Protection Act.\n\nThe legislation’s passage through the Senate is a victory and step forward for parents and advocates who have been demanding changes from giant social media companies to better protect children from bullying, human trafficking, sexual exploitation, addiction, self harm, and suicide while also broadening privacy protections through the separate bill that was attached through a procedural vote last week.\n\nThe Kids Online Safety Act, which was originally introduced in February 2022, is the first significant reform for tech companies since 1998. It was written following news reports that led to a series of five subcommittee public hearings on repeated failures by the nation’s largest social media companies to protect children on their platforms. Blumenthal and Blackburn this week conducted a news conference along with parents holding photos of the children they’ve lost to suicide or viral challenges based on interactions with others on social media.\n\nThe bill still needs to pass through the Republican-controlled House of Representatives. It was uncertain Wednesday as to whether Speaker of the House Mike Johnson would call the legislation for debate or a vote. However, if the House passes the bill and President Joe Biden signs it, the new law will require social media companies to:\n\nEnable their strongest privacy settings by default;\n\nPrevent and mitigate specific dangers to minors;\n\nProvide parents and educators with new controls to help protect children, and;\n\nRequire independent audits and research.\n\nThe Senate voted 91-3 in favor of the bill.\n\nBlumenthal called it a major win for our children.\n\n“Anyone who doubted whether we’d reach this milestone has never met our advocates – the parents who have lost children and the young people who refused to be treated like Big Tech piggy banks,” Blumenthal said in a statement. “Through their shared grief, these families worked with grit and grace to be some of the most dedicated and devoted advocates my colleagues have ever seen.”\n\nBlumenthal and Blackurn both thanked Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and Minority Leader Mitch McConnell for moving the legislation through the Senate, as well as Commerce Committee Chair Maria Cantwell and Ranking Member Ted Cruz for their leadership getting the legislation through.\n\n“We are excited now to work with our champions in the House of Representatives,” Blumenthal said. “I am confident that the support of our large, diverse, determined coalition will get this bill across the finish line. It will be the first internet safety reform in nearly three decades – a resounding bipartisan achievement showing democracy still works.”\n\nBlackburn called it a major step forward in protecting children online.\n\n“This legislation provides young people and parents with the tools, safeguards, and transparency they need to protect against online harms,” Blackburn said.\n\nShe added that the bill’s passage through the Senate could not have been possible without the support of over 240 organizations that endorsed the legislation along with the hundreds of parents who flew to Washington “on their own dime” to lobby Congress and push the bill forward.\n\n“The 91 Senators from across the political spectrum that stood up to Big Tech and voted in favor of this legislation have helped save countless innocent lives from being exploited online,” Blackburn said.\n\nKatharina Kopp, Ph.D., the Center for Digital Democracy‘s Director of Policy, lauded the Senate’s vote.\n\n“Today is a milestone in the decades long effort to protect America’s young people from the harmful impacts caused by the out-of-control and unregulated social and digital media business model,” Kopp said. “The Kids Online Safety and Privacy Act, if passed by the House and enacted into law, will safeguard children and teens from digital marketers who manipulate and employ unfair data-driven marketing tactics to closely surveil, profile, and target young people. These include an array of ever-expanding tactics that are discriminatory and unfair.”\n\nKopp continued: “The new law would protect children and teens being exposed to addictive algorithms and other harmful practices across online platforms, protecting the mental health and well-being of youth and their families.”\n\nExecutive Director Michael Toscano of the Institute for Family Studies said the bill must be passed without delay.\n\n“Despite the fact that a huge portion of social media consumers are kids, these platforms have been totally exempted from any regulation for child safety whatsoever,” Toscano said. “And this is the sad result: America’s kids are suffering from a mental health crisis of epochal proportions, driven by social media platforms that are designed to be highly-addictive. The Kids Online Safety Act gives parents and young Americans effective tools to make their own experiences on these platforms more age-appropriate, granting them the freedom to disable the most addictive features. It also imposes upon these Big Tech companies what they should have taken up themselves long ago: a ‘duty of care’ to not design their platforms to exploit children.”\n\nHe added that it is time to pass the Kids Online Safety Act because social media companies “do not need or deserve the protection of lawmakers. America’s children do.”"
