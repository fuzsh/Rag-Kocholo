        "text": "The auctioneer David Redden remembers seeing the grand Joseph Pulitzer mansion on the Upper East Side from a client’s home in 2000 and thinking it was “the most beautiful house in New York City.”\n\n“It was a Venetian palace,” Mr. Redden, now retired as a vice chairman of Sotheby’s and its longest-serving auctioneer, said in an email. “I said to myself, I shall live there someday!”\n\nHis aspirations came to fruition in 2011, when he and his wife, Jeannette, an environmentalist, bought a penthouse on the top floors of the mansion, which was designed by Stanford White and built in 1903 at 7-11 East 73rd Street. The penthouse is on two floors that are set back atop the building."
