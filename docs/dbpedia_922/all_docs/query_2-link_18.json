        "text": "The Complex consists of the historic Water Tower built in 1859 by the Chestnut Hill Water Company, and a Recreation Center and public playground built on a former pumping station and reservoir site. Philadelphia Water Department took possession of the Chestnut Hill Works on January 20, 1873. The reservoir and Tower, originally capped with a wooden water tank, were built because Philadelphia’s water system did not extend to Chestnut Hill until 1904, at which point this pumping station became obsolete. The Water Tower Recreation Center was built in 1919 by architect Robert McGoodwin in memory of Henry M. Houston Woodward, the eldest son of Dr. George and Mrs. Gertrude Houston Woodward, who was killed in the line of duty during World War I.\n\nThe Woodwards ensured the plot’s future role as a recreation site through an earlier donation of property located at 22nd and Huntington Streets to the City as a public playground (now Cecil B. Moore Recreation Center). The bequest was contingent on the City’s agreement to redevelop the six-acre reservoir site as a public playground and to operate and maintain the site in perpetuity. In 1910, the City agreed to these conditions and the Woodwards financed the redevelopment of the site. Within two years, a modest facility known as the Gravers Lane Playground provided the children of upper Chestnut Hill with a place to exercise and play. In 1919, the City transferred ownership of the property from the Department of Public Works to the Bureau of Recreation under the auspices of the Department of Public Welfare. The Woodwards continued to support the Center, partially financing two additions in 1929 to house an auditorium, gymnasium, and public meeting space.\n\nBy the mid-twentieth century, the Water Tower Recreation Center site had expanded, with the addition of two parcels enclosed by East Hartwell Lane, Winston Road, and Ardleigh Street, totaling two acres now housing six tennis courts. The modern facility also includes a batting cage, a hockey rink, one general playing field, two ball fields, and three basketball courts.\n\nNearby, overlooking the site of the reservoir and playing fields, are two stone pillars constructed as a war memorial with bronze plaques dedicated to those who died during World War II and containing the names of 81 individuals from local families"
