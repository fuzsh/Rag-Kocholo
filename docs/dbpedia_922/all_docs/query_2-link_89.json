        "text": "A new waterfront home in Sag Harbor that was owned and designed by interior designer Bryan Graybill has sold for $15,518,174 — which is $568,174, or 3.8 percent, more than the last asking price — making it the second most expensive sale Sag Harbor Village has ever seen.\n\nIt was completed in 2023 and featured in Architectural Digest. Located at 8 John Street, it is named “the Claxton House.” Graybill wrote on Instagram in April about the decision to put the house on the market.\n\n“We bought the property before COVID, and since acquiring it, our needs have changed,” he wrote. “Claxton House was meant to be the forever home.”\n\nHe noted that the property sits on a point with broad views to the west and north.\n\n“The Sag Harbor Railroad traversed the property from 1880 to 1950,” Graybill wrote. “Originally, there was a warehouse on the property, which was torn down after the railroad was decommissioned.”\n\nHe hired Historical Concepts, an architecture and planning firm located in New York and Atlanta, to “recreate the spirit of the original warehouse and then challenged the firm to imagine that space translated into a residence.”\n\nThe front facade was designed with loading dock doors, which act as kitchen windows, and what might have been the front door is now the entrance into the boot room, according to Graybill.\n\nOcean Building Corp., based in Hampton Bays, was responsible for the construction, and Hooten Land Design, based in Atlanta, was responsible for the landscape.\n\nThe 4,211-square-foot home on 0.41 acre has five bedrooms and six and a half baths. It has three levels, with large first-floor windows that fill the rooms with natural light, “while glazed interior walls allow for the maximization of sunlight,” according to the listing.\n\nDesign features include wide plank white oak floors in the living spaces and the reclaimed cement tiles, “rumored to hail from Spanish stables,” on stone floors. There is radiant heating throughout the first floor, including in the covered porch and boot room. The boot room’s interior walls mirror the material of the exterior siding.\n\nA parlor has a fireplace, and multiple sitting areas overlook the water. Entertaining spaces include an eat-in kitchen, a deck with a dining area, and a screened porch.\n\nThe primary suite is on the second level and has a fireplace, a bathroom with a double vanity, a dressing room, a wet bar, a sleeping porch and a neighboring office with its own bathroom.\n\nOutdoor amenities include a heated gunite pool and spa, and multiple decks, patios and outdoor dining areas. The property also comes with a detached two-car garage.\n\nThe property has 110 feet of bulkhead, bordering Sag Harbor Cove.\n\nIt was co-listed by Noble Black & Partners, Douglas Elliman’s Erica Grossman and Hedgerow Exclusive Properties and went into contract in less than two weeks from its listing date. Elliman’s Rima Mardoyan Smyth brought the buyer to the deal.\n\n“Claxton House is an incredibly thoughtful design concept that truly relates to the history and charm of Sag Harbor Village,” said Preston Kaye, co-founder of Hedgerow Exclusive Properties. “Fully customized and curated by an A-plus team of professionals including Bryan Graybill, Historical Concepts, and Ocean Building Corp., every inch of the waterfront property was meticulously conceived and built to the highest standard.”\n\nHe added that based on how quickly the sale transpired, “it is evident that really great product is still in high demand and buyers are willing to pay pioneering prices.”\n\n“I feel blessed to have been included in the representation of this stunning home,” Grossman wrote on Instagram, extending congratulations to all involved in the deal.\n\nThe deal closed on May 21, according to Suffolk Vision Inc. The new owner is Love Sunsets LLC."
