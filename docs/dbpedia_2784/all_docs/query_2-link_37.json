        "text": "The Battle of Hattin in 1187 significantly altered the Crusades' course by leading to the loss of Jerusalem by the Crusaders.\n\nThe Battle of Hattin, fought on 4th July 1187, was a pivotal moment in the history of the Crusades. The battle was fought between the Crusader Kingdom of Jerusalem and the forces of the Ayyubid sultan Salah ad-Din, known in the West as Saladin. The Crusaders suffered a catastrophic defeat, which had far-reaching consequences for the course of the Crusades.\n\nThe Crusaders' loss at Hattin was primarily due to their strategic mistakes and Saladin's superior tactics. The Crusader army, led by Guy of Lusignan, King of Jerusalem, made the fatal error of marching through arid terrain without adequate water supplies. Saladin capitalised on this, harassing the thirsty and exhausted Crusaders with his mobile forces before launching a full-scale attack. The Crusaders were encircled and defeated, with many captured, including King Guy, and the True Cross, a revered Christian relic, was lost.\n\nThe defeat at Hattin had immediate and profound effects on the Crusades. Most significantly, it left the Crusader states defenceless, enabling Saladin to recapture Jerusalem in October 1187. This was a devastating blow to the Crusaders, as Jerusalem was the spiritual heart of the Crusades, the city they had fought so hard to capture during the First Crusade. Its loss was a significant setback and a blow to Crusader morale.\n\nThe loss of Jerusalem and the defeat at Hattin also had longer-term impacts. It led directly to the calling of the Third Crusade by Pope Gregory VIII, as the Christian world sought to respond to the loss of Jerusalem. This brought new forces to the region, including those led by Richard the Lionheart of England, and led to a new phase of conflict.\n\nIn conclusion, the Battle of Hattin was a turning point in the Crusades. It led to the loss of Jerusalem, a significant blow to the Crusaders, and triggered the Third Crusade. The battle demonstrated the strategic and tactical superiority of Saladin and marked a shift in the balance of power in the region."
