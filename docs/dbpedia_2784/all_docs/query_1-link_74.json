        "text": "\"In times of peace, the warlike man attacks himself.\" Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche\n\nKingdom of Heaven ultimately misses its mark because it tries too hard to be balanced, moderate, and inoffensive. Hollywood, a city where lawyers live in luxury off no fault divorces, tries to put that same template on the crusades.\n\nWatching Kingdom of Heaven reminded me of an old Spanish proverb about the self-destructiveness of trying to please everyone. An old man walks along a rural road, his son astride their donkey. Several passersby offer critiques. The elderly father should ride as well as the son, then that the donkey is overburdened with two aboard. Finally, an early Peta advocate, I’m sure, advises that they reverse things, and carry the beast of burden themselves. The hapless pair, ever willing to take well-meaning advice, actually rigs up a wooden device to hoist the uncooperative donkey, whose unwieldy load casts them so off balance they land in a ditch, lose their goods and lame the donkey.\n\nThat’s exactly what happens to Ridley Scotts well-meaning affair. He initially had the courage to tackle this touchy subject at a time when Muslim/Christian tension runs high, but he lets his twentieth century sensibilities blind his eyes. Working so hard not to offend, he robs his tale of verve and realism.\n\nThe tales takes place between the second and third crusades, when a fragile peace prevails in Jerusalem. Under the sage leadership of King Baldwin, members of all three great religions have freedom of worship in the Holy City, but certain over-zealous Christians mostly, as well as a few muted Muslims, lust for total conquest. These Christian zealots are Knights of the Templar, already given a bad rap in The Da Vinci Code. So ghoulishly bellicose are they that their white uniforms emblazoned with a blood- red crosses do not seem too different from the hooded robes of the Ku Klux Klan.\n\nBut for balance, there are the enlightened and nuanced Christians, too. Orlando Bloom’s Balian, as bastard son of enlightened knight Baron Godfrey, joins their ranks, after killing the local priest because he had taunted the young widower about the eternal damnation of his suicidal wife. Oh, and the offending priest had also robbed said dearly departed of her crucifix and had the audacity to wear it. When the local bishops arrive to arrest the fleeing murderer, the good knights fight for him. In the exchange several crusading knights die, and Godfrey is mortally wounded.\n\nBefore shuffling off his mortal coil, Sir Godfrey is able to knight his son and impart a few words about a knight’s duty to \"...defend the helpless and never lie, even if it means your death.\" I guess the part about not killing offensive priests or annihilating the forces of justice pursuing murders isn’t part of the ceremony.\n\nBalian goes to Jerusalem, not only to avoid a murderer’s hanging back in France, but also as a pilgrimage to for redemption, in particular, for his wife. He even ascends the hill of Golgotha, where Christ was crucified, to seek enlightenment, but alas comes away unfulfilled.\n\nIt is not too much longer before he meets Princess Sibylla, sister to King Baldwin, but unfortunately also wed (via a prearrangement at age fifteen) to dastardly Crusader Guy de Lusignan, one of the bad Christians. Here’s where more of the moral confusion comes in. Apparently, the newly widowed Balian, originally on the journey to find redemption for himself and his wife, doesn’t find it objectionable to know the princess in the carnal sense soon after his arrival in this holy city. . She speaks Hollywoodese as she enters his nighttime chamber, kind of medieval version of “If it feels good, do it.” And he, of course, does.\n\nHowever, when he is offered her hand in marriage, as the good King Baldwin urges a plan to nullify both her marriage and her warmongering husband, Balian’s honor will not allow it. So a little adultery on the side is okay, but marriage and a plan to save the kingdom from war makes his knight’s conscience ache. Go figure.\n\nBecause of mutual respect, and an act of chivalry performed earlier, Balian is able to ward off imminent battle between the people of Jerusalem and the hordes of Saracens under the leadership of Saladin, portrayed superbly by Syrian Ghassan Massoud. But when Balian refuses to get Guy out of the picture by marrying the Princess, certain events are set in motion that cannot be altered.\n\nBy this time, King Balwin has succumbed to leprosy, his shrewd duputy Tiberius has had enough, and the bad Christians have their curly locks perched on stakes like so many beauty school hair pieces on display. Though outlandishly outnumbered, Balian is all that stands between the invading Saracen hordes and the Holy City and its inhabitants. He figures well, showing us a practical use for high school calculus, and succeeds in making a bloody defeat into a bloody standoff.\n\nWhen Balian goes to the battlefield to negotiate, he comes back with what he thinks are good terms. Saladin guarantees the defenders of Jerusalem free passage out of the city they have vowed to fight to the death for, once they turn it over to the Muslim conquerors. For this “victory” Balian is lifted on battle-weary shoulders and hailed a conquering hero. Am I a little confused here, or couldn’t this turnover have happened without any blood or death if he had surrendered the city in the first place, and turned it over as the British did Hong Kong? And would the remaining troops, who had lost many a comrade and innocent child even, laud this “warrior?”\n\nBut that’s not the real corker in my eyes. As Saladin walks through his now Muslin city, he sees a golden crucifix lying in the dust. With infinite care and respect, he sets it upright on a table.\n\nSometime film critic Hal Linsey offers a different perspective on the Saracen leader. “The following is from en eyewitness account of Saladin’s at the Battle of Hattin in 1187, as recorded by Ernoul, a Frankish prisoner who survived the battle.”\n\nSaladin thrusts his sword through the body of captive Prince Raynald and his cohorts rush in to cut off the prince’s head. “Saladin took some of the blood and sprinkled it on his head in recognition that he had taken vengeance on him. Then he ordered that they carry the head to Damascus, and it was dragged along the ground to show the Saracens whom the prince had wronged what vengeance he had had.”\n\nQuestion: How many contradictions can there be in one movie?\n\nAnswer: Enough to please and offend everyone, regardless of the truth.\n\n—Kathy Borich"
