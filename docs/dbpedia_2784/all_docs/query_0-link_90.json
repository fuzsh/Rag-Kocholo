        "text": "\"A complex historical narrative that celebrates female agency and a tale of family intrigue spanning generations, this book sheds light on the silenced women of a fascinating medieval bloodline.\"\n\nâ Kirkus Reviews\n\nâUsing a good range of contemporary sources, Pangonis deftly weaves together the life stories of the dynasty of women who ruled the Latin East in the twelfth century. Perhaps the greatest strength of this work is that Pangonis situates these women in the landscape, architecture, and culture of the Near East, combining physical descriptions with a colourful and engaging narrative.â\n\nâ The Times Literary Supplement (London)\n\n\"Beautifully constructed, highly intelligent, perceptive, humane and empathetic, this wonderful book turns the forgotten women rulers of Jerusalem from powerless broodmares into complex actors with agency, ingenuity and fascinating lives.\"\n\nâ WIlliam Dalrymple\n\n\"Fascinating, intriguing, exciting and authoritative. Here are the female rulers of the crusader states as shrewd politicians, warrior queens and mothers and wives, holding their own against male crusader states and Islamic warlords in the ruthless arena of the Middle East. The female crusader potentates have long been neglected, so this is long overdue and it was worth waiting for.\"\n\nâ Simon Sebag Montefiore, New York Times bestselling author of Jerusalem\n\n\"The subjects of this important and inspiring book have regularly been resigned to the footnotes of history. But the Queens of Jerusalem are history-makers, game-changers. Delight in their company in this seminal and scintillating debut.\"\n\nâ Bettany Hughes\n\n\"In a refreshing shift of historical emphasis, these women, whether players or pawns, are brought to life on their own terms, their experiences and careers.\"\n\nâ Christopher Tyerman, Professor of History of the Crusades at Oxford University\n\n\"A simply fascinating, original, and detailed history that is especially and unreservedly recommended for personal, professional, community, college, and university library Crusader History & Medieval Palestine collections, \"Queens of Jerusalem: The Women Who Dared to Rule\" by Katherine Pangonis is a model of historical research. Exceptionally well written, organized and presented.\"\n\nâ Midwest Book Review"
