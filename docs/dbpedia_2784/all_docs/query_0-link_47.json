The Crusader states are marked above with red crosses\n\nEurope during the age of crusades\n\nAfter the successful siege of Jerusalem in 1099, Godfrey of Bouillon, leader of the First Crusade, became the first ruler of the Kingdom of Jerusalem.\n\nThe Latin Crusaders owned Jerusalem, Tripoli and Antioch along the coast of the Mediterranean; They were surrounded by the Muslim Seljuq Empire (in Green) on the east and the Muslim Fatimid Empire (Dark Green) on the South.\n\nThe Near East, c. 1190, at the outset of the Third Crusade.\n\n“In 1187 Jerusalem fell to the muslim forces of Saladin, and Frederik I, very conscious of his responsibilities as the secular head of Christiandom, determined to lead a (Third) Crusade for the recovery of the Holy Land. In so doing he demonstrated not only that he had interests of the Christian Church at heart, but also that he intended to perform all the functions pertaining to his office. Like Charlemagne he was determined ‘to defend the Holy Church of Christ with arm against the attack of pagans and devastation by infidels from without.’ he rallied the Germans to this plan, and on May 11 1189 set sail down the Daniube to join the main body of his army at Vienna and lead it to the Holy Land. The ensuing Crusade was in many ways a miniature of his whole carrrer. The hardships of the journey were stupendous, and in spite of Frederick’s heroic leadership, his army suffered enormous losses. At lat, when it had almost fought its way to Antioch and the greatest difficulties had been surmounted, Frederick was accidentally drowned in the River Saleph (10 June 1190) and his army was dispirited tahat it disintegrated.”\n\nThe Fourth Crusade 1204\n\nPope Innocent called for Christian crusades against Muslim Spain and the Holy Land.\n\nOne of Pope Innocent’s most critical decisions was organizing the Fourth Crusade. Originally intended to attack Jerusalem through Egypt, a series of unforeseen circumstances led the crusaders to Constantinople, where they ultimately sacked the city in 1204. Although the attack went against his explicit orders, Innocent reluctantly accepted this result, seeing it as the will of God to reunite the Latin and Orthodox Churches, but instead, it poisoned relations between the two churches.\n\nInnocent viewed the capture of Constantinople as a way to reunite the schismatic Western and Eastern Orthodox Churches. His goal was to install the Latin (Western) ideals into the main center of the Greek (Eastern) Church. He saw the invasion as a way of making the Greek Church submit to the views of those that occupied their city. His tactics ultimately failed due to the significant differences between the two churches. The crusade did lead to the start of the Latin Empire’s rule of Constantinople, which lasted for the next sixty years.\n\nKrak des Chevaliers, Syria.

It is among the largest and oldest European royal houses, consisting of Hugh Capet’s male-line descendants. It ruled in France as the House of Capet from the ascension of Hugh Capet in 987 until the death of Charles IV in 1328.

(Carthage: Tunisia)\n\n526: Justinian’s reign begins. He reconquers parts of the fallen Western Empire (Africa and Italy, Spain). He codifies the Previous Roman Laws into one document. Constantinople is the most glorious city in europe, with 500,000 inhabitants. The Hagia Sofia is constructed. Justinian is the last emperor to use the title “Caesar”.\n\nVandal was a Germanic people belonging to the family of East Germans. the Vandal warriors, a Germanic tribe, once established a kingdom in Tunisia North Africa as their base for raiding the Mediterranean Sea, and helped bring about the Roman Empire’s eventual fall in the fifth century.\n\nThe Franks were a confederation of Germanic tribes that was originally composed of a mix of groups settled between the Rhine and the Weser Rivers. The two most prominent of these tribes were the Ripuarians and the Salians who led the others.From the 5th century CE onwards, as Roman power declined in northern Gaul, the Franks expanded into Belgium and northern France. Later on, the Franks resumed their expansion process and, by the first half of the 6th century CE, they gained control over part of central and southern France and a small portion of northern Spain.\n\nByzantine Empire 526 AD\n\nByzantine Empire 565 AD\n\nJustinian, by 565, reconquered, the African province from the Vandals and most of Italy from the Goths. He so recovered the South Spain. After his death in 565AD, the greater part of his Italian conquests was lost to the Lombards. Italy was indeed at that time almost a desert; the Lombard historians assert they came into an empty country. The Avars and Slavs struck down from the Danube country towards the Adriatic, Slav populations establishing themselves in what is now Serbia, Croatia, and Dalmatia, to become the Yugo-Slavs of today. Moreover, a great and exhausting struggle began with the Sassanid Empire in Persia.\n\nByzantine Empire 1050\n\nByzantine Empire 867 CE to 1453 Animated\n\nThe Crusades [1]\n\nThe city of Jerusalem was the center of faith for three major world religions. For the Jews, it was their homeland. It had been promised to them by Jehovah, whom they believed had covenanted with Abraham to give him the land of Israel. To the Muslims, Jerusalem was the location where the Prophet Muhammad had ascended into heaven. After Makkah and Medinah, Jerusalem was Islam’s third most holy city. To the Christians, Jerusalem was both the location of Christ’s birth and the location of his death. It is also the location of much of the New Testament.\n\nThis Holy Land was conquered by Islam in the 600s A.D., and would remain in their control for many centuries to come. In 1095 A.D., Pope Urban II called for volunteers to travel to Jerusalem and fight to take it back from the Muslims. He called their mission a crusade. The word “crusade” comes from the word Crux, which means “cross” in Latin. Those who volunteered for the crusade would be called crusaders, meaning that they took the cross of Jesus upon them.\n\nThis crusade would be the first of nine total crusades that Christians would carry out as they attempted to control Israel territory.\n\nThe Lombards were a Germanic tribe that originated in Scandinavia and migrated to the region of Pannonia (modern-day Hungary). Their migration is considered part of “The Wandering of the Nations” or “The Great Migration”, which was a period roughly defined as lasting between 376-476 AD.\n\n568: Lombards invade Italy, eventually taking Northern Italy from the Byzantines.\n\n610: Heraclius becomes Byzantine emperor. Gets temporary possession of Mesopotamia. The theme system is installed. The Empire’s language changes to Greek from Latin. Eventual Lost of Syria, Palestine, and Egypt to Muslims.\n\n693: Muslims attack Constantinople.\n\n690: Loss of North Africa to Muslims.\n\nFrancia and neighbouring Slavic peoples ca. 650\n\n800: Charlemagne, king of the Franks, is crowned “Emperor of the Romans” by Pope Leo III in Rome. For the first time in 300 years, there is an emperor of the “East” and an emperor of the “West”.\n\n714-741 The Hammer – Charles Martel 751-768 “The Short” Pepin III – closer affinity between Rome and Frankish Gaul 768-814 “Charles The Great” Charlemagne – Empire of The Romans 814-840 Louis the Pious 843 Treaty of Verdun: Breakup of Frankish Kingdom into three parts – eastern, western and central 843-1000 Feudalism 1054 The Great Schism: The Latin Roman Church and the Greek Orthodox Church excommunicate each other. (See Great Schism (1054) in Youtube) 1095 Alexius appeals to Urban II at Council of Piacenza for help against the Turks. The First Crusade is proclaimed at Council of Clermont. 1096 Crusaders arrive at Constantinople. The Crusaders are successful, but eventually withdraw from cooperation with the Byzantines. 1204 Fourth Crusade captures Constantinople. The Latin Empire of Constantinople is formed as well as many Byzantine successor states. The capture of Constantinople in 1204 was a blow from which the Byzantines never fully recovered. 1453 Fall of Constantinople to the Ottomans. End of the Byzantine Empire.\n\nThe Ottomans and the Byzantine Empires in 1355\n\nAfter the fall of Rome in the 5th century, the Franks became the dominant ethnic group in the area, built several monasteries, and replaced the barbarism of the region with the civilization of the Carolingian Empire.\n\nIn 486 AD, Clovis of the Franks defeated the Romans in Gaul. And in 503 AD Clovis converted to Christianity. He Founded the Frankish kingdom. The Frankish expansion continued until the 8th century CE, during the time of Charlemagne, when the Frankish territory occupied most of Western Europe.\n\nIt was, indeed, the very strength of their own national characteristics that led to the failure of the Franks to acclimatise throughly in Gaul. They were always the most German of the Germans in their final conquest of the Saxons, and Allemans as in their early struggle with the Romans. Their domination in the west was largely due to the assistance of the Church, without which they would scarcely have been able to extend their borders to the Mediterranean and the Atlantic, and would certainly not have been succeeded in converting their kingdom into an empire. The Roman Church was the real victor. The Franks, it is true, became very good Christians; but they ended, as they became, by being essentially warriors, and they never ceased to cherish their German institutions, language and national traditions.\n\nThey were in Gaul for centuries, but of Gaul they never were, in any thorough and durable sense. The nostalgia which perpetually haunted them became an irrestible force. When they realised that the French could never be Germanised, and that on the Seine and loire and Rhone they must either become Gauls themselves or be content to live amongst a race alien in language, thought, and daily habit, then, by natural and inevitable gravitation, they practically reverted as a nation to their ancestral seats.\n\nBreakup of Frankish Empire – Treaty of Verdun 843 AD\n\nReferences\n\nTreaty Of Verdun\n\nhttps://subratachak.wordpress.com/tag/crusades/\n\nThe Frankish Empire – Audio\n\nThe Viking Invasion – Audio\n\nhttp://www.ancient.eu/Franks/"
