        "text": "In 1187, 88 years after the fall of the Jerusalem to the Crusaders, the Franks were defeated in a disastrous battle at Hattin. This battle pitted bitter rivals in Saladin and his Muslim army and the Frankish army under King Guy of Jerusalem. After several days of skirmishes and a day of intense fighting Saladin would emerge victorious. Almost all of Guy’s army of around 20,000 Christians would be killed or captured including Guy himself, though he would be released later. What caused this terrible defeat? Some historians believe that Count Raymond of Tripoli, a prominent Christian leader, was at fault for the Frankish defeat at Hattin, but King Guy of Jerusalem’s numerous mistakes were the real cause of the Frankish loss.\n\nThis defeat was not inevitable, but a major conflict between the two powers in the region, Saladin and Guy, certainly was. For years, Saladin had been provoked by the Christian leader Reynald of Chatillon. In 1181-2, Reynald led a raid into the Hijaz?, winning the support of local tribes and wreaking havoc. While the raid itself didn’t do all that much damage, it still posed a huge problem for Saladin. The ease in which Reynald was able to recruit the local tribes was bad news for Saladin were any serious invasion to come through. An even worse provocation followed the next year. Reynald led a naval expedition into the Red Sea, then landing and attempting to march on Mecca. This expedition was stopped a single day’s march from the city. This shocked the Muslim world, and shook their faith in Saladin and his ability to protect them from the infidels in the Latin Kingdom. The Muslim world demanded a response from Saladin, but when he invaded later that year he was unable to provoke the Christians under King Guy i...\n\n... middle of paper ...\n\n...lized now just how desperate their situation was, and made several charges to try and break out. Only one succeeded, a charge led by Balian of Ibelin enabled a few Christians to escape the deadly ring. The remaining Christians had no hope to win the battle, they were greatly outnumbered and dangerously dehydrated. They knew that the only escape was to kill Saladin himself. They launched two last ditch charges towards Saladin. This nearly worked, each time the Christians were close to reaching Saladin himself before they were finally turned back.\n\nAfter the failure of those charges, the Christians gave up. Many of them just laid on the ground, collapsed with exhaustion. The Muslims rounded up the Christians, killing the knights and Raynald, and selling into slavery many more. He let King Guy go free however, saying “It is not the wont of kings to kill kings”.\n\n."
