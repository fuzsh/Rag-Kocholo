        "text": "Saladin is remembered for commanding the Ayyubids at the Battle of Hattin, in which the Ayyubids decisively defeated the Kingdom of Jerusalem. The battle occurred on July 4, 1187.\n\nWhat does the Egyptian flag symbolize?\n\nThe colors of the Egyptian flag symbolize the struggle of the nation against tyranny and the strength of the people of Egypt. The flag has three horizontal stripes that are red, white and black. It also has an emblem of the eagle of Saladin on it.\n\nWhat does it mean when people say your elevens are up?\n\nIt is a reference to Mel Brook's movie \"life stinks\" I do not remember exactly, but I remember it from there.\n\nWhy do so many answers seem to come from completely clueless people?\n\nIf you want to put an answer and you say \"You can't trust other people.\" how can they trust you? We are all humans, so lets make some peace by trusting other people and yourself. Remember that. -- Because a lot of people are clueless or otherwise stupid. Remember, the average IQ is about 100."
