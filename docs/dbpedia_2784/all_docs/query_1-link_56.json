The organization lasted for two centuries in the Middle Ages. It was founded after the First Crusade of 1096, with its original purpose to ensure the safety of the many Christians who made the pilgrimage to Jerusalem after it was taken over.\n\nIt was officially endorsed by the Roman Catholic Church around 1129, and became a favored charity by many Christians and grew fast in membership and power. Templar knights wore white mantles quartered by a red cross and were among the most skilled fighting units of the Crusades.\n\nThose members of the Order that did not fight managed a large economic infrastructure throughout Christendom, innovating financial techniques that were an early form of banking, and building many fortifications throughout the Mediterranean and the Holy Land.\n\nThe Templars' success was tied closely to the Crusades; when the Holy Land was lost, support for the Order faded.\n\nRumors about the Templars' secret initiation ceremony created mistrust, and King Philip IV of France, deeply in debt to the Order, began pressuring Pope Clement V to take action against the Order.\n\nIn 1307, many of the Order's members in France were arrested, tortured into giving false confessions, and then burned at the stake.\n\nIn 1312, Pope Clement, under continuing pressure from King Philip, disbanded the Order.\n\nNo precise numbers exist, but it is estimated that at the order's peak there were between 15,000 and 20,000 Templars, of whom about a tenth were actual knights.\n\nBattles\n\nThe Crusades\n\nSiege of Ascalon (1153)\n\nBattle of Montgisard (1177)\n\nBattle of Marj Ayyun (1179)\n\nBattle of Hattin (1187)\n\nSiege of Acre (1190–1191)\n\nBattle of Arsuf (1191)\n\nSiege of Al-Dāmūs (1210)\n\nBattle of Legnica (1241)\n\nSiege of Acre (1291)\n\nReconquista\n\nOther pages\n\nTeutonic Knights\n\nImages for kids\n\nThe first headquarters of the Knights Templar, on the Temple Mount in Jerusalem.
