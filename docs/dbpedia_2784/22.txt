The Battle of Hattin in 1187 was an important victory for Saladin and a major defeat for the crusader states. The Holy Cross was lost, the King of Jerusalem captured and much the Knights Templar decimated. It is also a battle which serves as a great case study for mounted archers. This subject is the focus of much research and experimental archaeology. Historians always stress the importance of mounted archers for oriental warfare and the subject is picked up again and again, mostly because it is so spectacular. Sources from the crusades mention the mounted archers in different contexts, both as the fearsome enemies of Christians and as the strength of Muslim armies. They probably appear in the European sources unusually often, because their fighting techniques were so different from what was known to the crusaders and it remained obscure until the Ottoman conquest of southern Europe in the later Middle Ages. The term ‘Turcoman’ or ‘Turcopole’ can define various types of troops, but are generally used for light mounted archers of Turkish or Kurdish tribes from the Caucasus and Asia Minor1. This special type of warfare required a special weapon; the composite bow. In this essay I will look at the general tactics of Turkish mounted archers and use the Battle of Hattin as an example of their effectiveness on the battlefield. Finally I will outline the importance and features of the composite reflex bow.
