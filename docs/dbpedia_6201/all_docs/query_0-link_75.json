        "text": "What happened on X tonight? After lengthy unexplained tech delays, it wasn't quite clear whether Elon Musk thought he was the one running for President or if he was trying to learn how former President Trump felt about the issues, but minutes after the end of the live discussion between Elon Musk and former President Trump hosted on Trump‚Äôs official X account, Mercury Analytics reviewed and analyzed the full discussion using MercuryAI ‚Äî all at the touch of a button. The ‚Äúlive conversation‚Äù was billed by Musk as one ‚Äúunscripted with no limits on subject matter,‚Äù who said the conversation ‚Äúshould be highly entertaining.‚Äù In fact, it included a lot more Musk than Trump, with clear explanations by Musk of his views of what's wrong with America and what needs to change. Donald Trump agreed with most and repeated most of the gripes Musk has had for some time. To access the full summary and analysis, check out https://lnkd.in/g-hanbBe\n\nCatch MercuryAI in action tonight... Get complete, in-depth analysis of tonight‚Äôs talk between former President Donald Trump and Elon Musk. Within minutes following the event, Mercury will release complete MercuryAI analysis of the event that summarizes all key points made, picks out the best and worst aspects of the talk, adds fact checking, and weighs in on whether the talk seemed more like a campaign ad or a balanced conversation aimed at providing substantive answers to the issues that matter most to U.S. voters as the election nears. Check back later tonight! MercuryAI AI Done Right.\n\nüá∫üá∏As the fallout from the US debate continues, we‚Äôre returning to our overnight research among 2,402 likely voters on the evening. At the time, 35% of participants indicated that they would vote for Donald Trump, while 32% said they would vote for current President Joe Biden. Even after an eventual 90-minute debate, 8% were undecided. The question remains: how has support shifted in the last two weeks?
