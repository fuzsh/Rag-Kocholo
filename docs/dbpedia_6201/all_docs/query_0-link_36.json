        "text": "Sunnyvale, CA — Mercury Interactive Corporation, the world’s leader in enterprise application testing, announced that its testing tools are an essential part of a current effort at Siemens Telecom Networks’ (STN) to successfully implement a one-time, across-the-board switchover from its existing mainframe system to a full-scale SAP system. The company is currently performing automated load tests using Mercury Interactive’s testing solutions.\n\nSTN, a subsidiary of Siemens AG, designs and manufactures telecommunications equipment and solutions. It plans to replace existing mainframe applications with an efficient, integrated SAP R/3 system spanning all critical areas of business in order to maximize profitability in its competitive business. To get the full-scale SAP system running at optimum levels prior to “flipping the switch,” STN has conducted automated load tests using Mercury Interactive’s LoadRunner for R/3.\n\n“By using LoadRunner for R/3 to closely emulate actual business transactions, Siemens gains greater confidence for the ultimate test — when they actually switch over from their old mainframe to the new SAP system,” said Jim Hare, senior product manager for packaged applications at Mercury Interactive. “By employing testing early in the process, Siemens is taking every precaution to ensure they have a SAP system running at optimal efficiency and performance — lowering the financial risk and raising the expected return on investment.”\n\nBecause the new SAP system will run STN’s business, every precaution is being taken ahead of time to mitigate the risk involved. It is absolutely essential to ensure — before deployment — that the system will operate at optimum performance, be supported quickly and effectively, and handle the traffic volume involved in STN’s everyday business operations. Manual testing proved to be too time-consuming and undependable for this critical system.\n\n“Automated testing was the only logical option to identify and resolve potential problems,” said Bob Shepardson, IT director for applications at STN. “LoadRunner was the only testing solution we saw that provides the features needed to perform volume testing in our specific setting.”"
