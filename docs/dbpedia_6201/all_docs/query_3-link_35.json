        "text": "SHORT TAKES\n\nIBM, XILINX ANNOUNCE MULTI-MILLION DOLLAR MANUFACTURING DEAL\n\nEast Fishkill, NY and San Jose, CA — IBM and Xilinx announced a two-year, multi-million dollar agreement under which IBM will manufacture Xilinx’s newly-announced Virtex-II semiconductor products.\n\nIBM plans to manufacture the parts for Xilinx using IBM’s most advanced 0.13 and 0.10 micron (a micron is a thousandth of a meter) copper-based chip-making technology. This is the first time IBM will manufacture high-volume parts for a foundry customer using its most advanced processes, normally used in high-end microprocessors, custom chips and memory products.\n\nThe Xilinx products will be manufactured at IBM facilities in Burlington, Vermont and East Fishkill, New York.\n\nThe Virtex-II products are the result of a collaborative design effort between the two companies, integrating IBM’s PowerPC microprocessor with Xilinx field programmable gate array (FPGA) technology to form a new type of hybrid chip for use in communications, storage, and consumer applications.\n\nIBM and Xilinx had originally announced in July, 2000 their plans to develop a hybrid approach to developing custom chips, combining Xilinx FPGA and IBM PowerPC microprocessor technology. The intent was to enable customers who choose FPGA solutions from Xilinx to more easily migrate to IBM PowerPC-based ASIC and standard product solutions over time.\n\nWith Xilinx’s announcement of the resulting Virtex-II products, backed by this manufacturing agreement with IBM, customers can now take advantage of this unique platform.\n\nMERCURY INTERACTIVE AND CITRIX SYSTEMS TEAM UP\n\nSunnyvale, CA and Fort Lauderdale, FL — Mercury Interactive Corporation and Citrix Systems, Inc. announced an expanded relationship whereby the two companies will combine Citrix technology with Mercury Interactive’s LoadRunner(R) and Topaz(TM) to enable organizations to emulate, test and monitor the performance of applications deployed with Citrix(R) MetaFrame(R). Specifically, the two companies have jointly developed technology to allow LoadRunner and Topaz to emulate, test and monitor Citrix-based application serving environments. The alliance enables Mercury Interactive and Citrix customers to optimize the performance and scalability of their Citrix-based applications and ensure availability, reliability and performance of their deployed systems. In addition, the agreement provides customers who meet certain qualifications with Citrix-certified consulting engagements to assist in the design of a Citrix infrastructure.\n\nIn addition, Mercury Interactive has become a Premier Member of Citrix Business Alliance(TM) (CBA) program in a newly created category for Testing and Performance Management, and Citrix is now a Validated Integration Partner (VIP) in Mercury Interactive’s Open Architecture Program (OAP).\n\nLoadRunner for Citrix will be available from Mercury Interactive in 60 days and starts at $52K USD for 50 concurrent Citrix users. Topaz for Citrix will be available from Mercury Interactive in 60 days and starts at $60K USD.\n\nWeb site: http://www.citrix.com\n\nWeb site: http://www.mercuryinteractive.com\n\n============================================================"
