        "text": "Some of the worldâ€™s most innovative software, e-commerce and financial services companies rely upon our software and information technology group for targeted, timely IP law services.\n\nWe assist start-up companies in developing procedures and strategies for protecting their innovations. We provide domestic and international patent prosecution, counsel regarding strategic development of products and indemnification issues, extensive licensing services (both outbound and inbound), and comprehensive programs for pre-litigation, licensing and litigation for enforcement purposes. We also defend our clients in patent infringement litigation brought by competitors and non-practicing entities.\n\nOver 25 of our attorneys and scientists hold degrees in Computer Science and other computer-related areas, with several having worked as examiners at the USPTO in the data processing and business methods areas. Given the rapid pace of change within our industry, we work closely with our clients to help them quickly identify and prioritize potentially patentable inventions, and advise them regarding such important topics as divided infringement, extraterritorial infringement and portfolio management."
