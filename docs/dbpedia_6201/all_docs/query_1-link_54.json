        "text": "Mercury emissions know no national or continental boundaries. Mercury emitted into the air can travel thousands of miles in the atmosphere before it is eventually deposited back to the earth in rainfall or in dry gaseous form.\n\nHow does mercury threaten our health?\n\nTypes of Sources\n\nWorldwide Emissions\n\nLearn More\n\nHow does mercury threaten our health?\n\nExposure to mercury threatens our health, with many often irreversible toxic effects. Developing fetuses and young children are most at risk. Mercury pollution also harms wildlife and ecosystems.\n\nMercury occurs naturally in the earthâ€™s crust, but human activities, such as mining and fossil fuel combustion, have led to widespread global mercury pollution. Mercury emitted into the air eventually settles into water or onto land where it can be washed into water. Once deposited, certain microorganisms can change it into methylmercury, a highly toxic form that builds up in fish, shellfish and animals that eat fish. Most human exposure to mercury is from eating fish and shellfish contaminated with methylmercury, both in the United States and worldwide.\n\nAlmost all people in the world have at least trace amounts of methylmercury in their tissues, reflecting its pervasive presence in the environment. Some communities eat significantly more quantities of fish than the general population, and thus may be exposed to much greater mercury contamination than the general population. It is estimated that more than 75,000 newborns in the United States each year may have increased risk of learning disabilities associated with in-utero exposure to methylmercury.\n\nLearn more about the toxic effects of mercury.\n\nLearn more about mercury exposure in the United States.\n\nPress release: FDA and EPA issue updated draft advice for fish consumption\n\nTypes of Sources\n\nNatural sources of mercury include volcanic eruptions and emissions from the ocean. Anthropogenic (human-caused) emissions include mercury that is released from fuels or raw materials, or from uses in products or industrial processes.\n\nSome of the mercury circulating through today's environment was released years ago. Land, water, and other surfaces can repeatedly re-emit mercury into the atmosphere after its initial release into the environment. We know that anthropogenic emissions continue to add significantly to the global pool of mercury.\n\nGlobally, artisanal and small-scale gold mining (ASGM) is the largest source of anthropogenic mercury emissions (37.7%), followed by stationary combustion of coal (21%). Other large sources of emissions are non-ferrous metals production (15%) and cement production (11%). (United Nations Environment Programme, Global Mercury Assessment, 2018)\n\nGlobal sources of mercury, 2018 Source Amount (kg) Artisanal and Small Scale Mining 837,658 Stationary Combustion of Coal 473,777 Nonferrous Metals Production 326,657 Cement Production 233,168 Waste from Products 146,938 Vinyl Chlorine Monomer 58,268 Biomass Burning 51,860 Ferrous Metals Production 39,903 Chlor-alkali Production 15,146 Waste ininceration 14,944 Oil Refining 14,377 Stationary Combustion of Oil and Gas 7,130 Cremation 3,768\n\nWorldwide Emissions\n\nHow much mercury is emitted worldwide each year? Estimates of annual global mercury emissions from anthropogenic sources are approximately 2220 metric tons per year. These estimates include mercury that is re-emitted. The world map below provides information about the worldwide distribution of anthropogenic mercury emissions.\n\nLearn More\n\nFor more information on regulatory and policy measures that EPA is taken to reduce mercury pollution, see the EPA Mercury Portal.\n\nLearn about EPA's International Actions Reducing Mercury Emissions and Use.\n\nContacts\n\nFor additional information on EPA's work with mercury, contact:\n\nRodges Ankrah\n\nU.S. Environmental Protection Agency\n\nOffice of International and Tribal Affairs (2670R)\n\n1200 Pennsylvania Ave., NW\n\nWashington, DC 20460\n\n(202) 564-0280"
