        "text": "It seems like all the big pre-built gaming PC companies are being aquired one by one. Alienware was aquired by Dell back in March, and now HP is aquiring Voodoo PC. Like Dell, HP hopes to increase it's share in the gaming computer industry, and hopes to learn more about building good gaming computers. Voodoo PC is well known for making high-end computers with very nice cases. The deal is expected to close in November, and HP has announced buying Mercury Interactive and Peregrine Systems, in addition to smaller acquisitions. HP has also started a partnership with Yahoo, like Dell has partnered with Google, which means HP will include alot of Yahoo's software on their computers.\n\nView at TechPowerUp Main Site\n\nthe question is do many ppl really buy from voodoo and falcon? i know they have really good comps but is it really that profitable? ive seen voodoos go for like 10G's\n\nthe question is do many ppl really buy from voodoo and falcon? i know they have really good comps but is it really that profitable? ive seen voodoos go for like 10G's\n\nFNW averages 100 boxes a month (which is alot more than it sounds) IDK about VPC though.\n\nthe question is do many ppl really buy from voodoo and falcon? i know they have really good comps but is it really that profitable? ive seen voodoos go for like 10G's\n\nOddly enough, people buy from voodoo, alienware, fnw, a lot\n\nHowever, This is a very good thing. Alienware will no longer be able to just give their prices a slight bump- the buying power of HP will keep voodoo's prices lower, making alienware lower theirs.\n\nWin:Win\n\nNot very often companys do good things!\n\nGO HP!"
