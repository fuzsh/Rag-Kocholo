        "text": "North Canton, Ohio – Like his customers, the president of Mercury Document Imaging Co., Inc., Joel Volk, cares most about the end result. So much so that he has a bird feeder and bird bath outside of his office window to remind him of that daily.\n\n“I don’t care about the feeder, the bath, or the seeds. I just want the birds,” says Volk. “The same goes for our customers. They don’t want machines. They don’t want software. They just want their operations to work effortlessly, and they want to grow without having to add resources.”\n\nWanting the same prosperity for his company, Volk has joined the likes of other independent dealerships nationwide with the recent sale of Mercury Document Imaging to Visual Edge Technology, Inc. The deal marks the 31st acquisition for Visual Edge.\n\nWith three locations in Southern California and one in Chicago, Mercury Document Imaging is a total office automation provider of multifunctional equipment, document management software, managed print, and shredding solutions.\n\nVolk says that when he started looking at acquisition companies to partner with, he found Visual Edge to be a community of talented and successful business leaders all working together in the industry that he loves.\n\n“My goal is for all of us to grow together as we learn new and better ways to make it easy for our clients,” added Volk.\n\nA self-proclaimed family man, Volk got into the business 33 years ago while working as a temp at his father’s typewriter repair company. Since then, he has never looked back. Volk will continue leading Mercury as president and general manager while receiving advisory support from Visual Edge. The sales and service operations for Mercury’s customers and employees will also remain the same.\n\n“We may not be selling the most sexy items on earth, but it’s the way that we do it that makes buying from us an easy decision for our customers,” says Volk. “By gaining the support of a larger organization, our good work will be augmented with greater resources, including a brain trust of seasoned and talented industry executives who will help forge a bright future for my staff and my clients.”\n\nAbout Mercury Document Imaging Company, Inc.\n\nFounded in 1985, Mercury Document Imaging is a holistic document management company specializing in all areas of office automation, from creation (laser printers, copiers, fax, plotters, and multifunctional devices) to document management (electronic filing, file sharing, audit trail, multiple use, remote access, and redundancy) to destruction (file encryption and paper shredders). The company was founded with a focus on building long-term relationships with everyone involved—customers, vendors, staff, and business community members of Southern California and Chicago.\n\nAbout Visual Edge Technology, Inc.\n\nVisual Edge Technology, Inc., a family of Office and IT Solutions Companies, incorporates a strategy of operating through established dealerships across the U.S., focused on providing a broad line of office solutions, including the sale and service of automated multifunction products, wide-format solutions, managed print services, document management software, network management services, and IT solutions. Visual Edge sells products supplied by Konica Minolta, Canon, Xerox, HP, Kyocera, Sharp, Samsung, Muratec, Okidata, Toshiba, Kip, Lexmark, Ricoh, Epson, and Panasonic. Through its acquisition strategy, Visual Edge will continue to identify successful companies that focus on providing simple solutions to complex challenges.\n\nhttp://www.visualedgetechnology.com"
