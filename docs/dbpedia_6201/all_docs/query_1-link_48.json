Sasha saw how many enterprises were frustrated with critical business systems going down or underperforming, repeatedly seeing how complexity and gaps in IT operations created problems that no technology filled. Looking at these issues from a new perspective, he envisioned a revolutionary approach for handling the overwhelming and dynamic data that IT teams confront in maintaining performance and availability of their business operations. Sasha founded Evolven to apply a new analytics approach to resolve these chronic change & configuration challenges and dramatically minimize the risk of downtime and slash incident investigation time.
