        "text": "Cloud-based Performance Testing in an Agile World\n\nWeds. April 29, 2:00-3:00 ET\n\nContrary to popular perception, occasional spikes in demand for online services aren’t just a concern for retailers. The same story plays out across virtually all industries. From insurance to entertainment, from government to higher education, organizations have to prepare their websites and apps for massive volumes of concurrent users. Sometimes they can see the deluge coming in the form of predictable seasonal spikes in demand, but often they can’t.\n\nWhen peak traffic hits, both external applications and internal applications are impacted, causing losses in revenue, brand reputation, and employee productivity. The right preparation and tools can help to make sure that organizations don’t suffer catastrophic scalability or stability issues under high-traffic situations.\n\nWithout question, continuous performance testing is critical to the success of your apps. If you don’t test until the end of the cycle, you risk production issues, user complaints, poor reviews, and damage to your brand. So in Agile development/DevOps environments, performance testing must be integrated with the whole development process, including open-source frameworks such as Jenkins, Azure DevOps, Bamboo and Git. This integration lets you initiate performance tests to check that new code you’ve pushed out hasn’t caused any regressions or broken your compliance with performance SLAs.\n\nYour users are coming from all over the world, so to gain a realistic view of performance you need to test from all over. Because of this, cloud-based load testing is essential for testing performance against spikes in demand."
