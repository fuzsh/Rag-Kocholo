        "text": "The first of a series of three buildings we designed for the pioneer of Hi-Tech industry in Israel – Arye Fingold, founder of Mercury Interactive Corp., later became part of global HP. This R+D office building features 10,000 sqm in 5 floors, including 250 work stations in open space areas, cafeteria, workout room and underground parking.\n\nThe design vocabulary presents a contrast between the heavy stone-claded walls and the light aluminum cornice hovering above, with the all glass top floor in between. This feature has made this project an iconic building and a milestone in the emerging Hi-Tech architecture in Israel.\n\n“Smart Building”: The central core contains a 5 floor high atrium aith steel stair connecting all levels. The exterior wall are made of two layers, with all infrastructure installed in between. in each floor a central computer room stacked vertically serves all stations."
