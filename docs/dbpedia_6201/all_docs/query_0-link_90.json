It provides a base for individuals in different areas of information technology and provides the basis for further training and specialist preparation.\n\nJava\n\nJava is a language that has always been in the top 3 of the most used programming languages for many years. Due to its Object Oriented Programming feature, it allows you to use your code again and again, and can run on different computers. Also, the wide range of Java tools helps you test your code quickly and find bugs. If you learn Java, you can do better tests and perform better as a software tester.\n\nLambda\n\nIn Java, a lambda expression is a short way to show a function that doesn’t have a name and can be used as a value. This was added in Java 8 to make functional programming better.\n\nSDLC\n\nSDLC (Software Development Life Cycle) is the process developers follow to create and maintain software. Test Automation is the process of automating manual tests. In SDLC, Test Automation is typically used in the testing phase to check that software is functioning well. It saves time and effort by running tests and repeating them automatically.\n\nManual Testing\n\nManual testing is a basic software testing method where a tester applies test cases by hand, without the help of automated tools. Its primary goal is to discover bugs, issues, and faults in the application software. As the earliest form of testing, manual testing remains crucial in identifying critical issues in software.\n\nGit-Github\n\nGit and GitHub are increasingly popular tools that play an essential role in software development processes. Git is known as a distributed version control system, while GitHub is a Git-based code hosting platform where professionals can work together.\n\nAfter Git and Github training, you will be able to use these tools easily in your business life. GitHub offers several features that help developers manage their projects more effectively. For example, it provides tools for project management, such as monitoring issues, monitoring bugs, and wiki pages. It also helps professionals to work together with features such as a pull request mechanism where different developers can suggest changes and contribute to a project.\n\nUsing Git and GitHub makes software development processes more efficient and organised. It enables several developers to work on the same project, helps with rollbacks, and enables rapid bug fixing. It also increases community engagement and makes code sharing simpler in open-source projects.\n\nResumé - LinkedIn\n\nA resumé is a short description of personal, educational, and professional qualifications and experience used for job applications.\n\nLinkedIn is the world's largest professional business network on the Internet. You can use LinkedIn to find the right job or position as an intern, build and strengthen professional relationships, and learn the skills you need to succeed in your career.\n\nTechPro Education offers you career support to create the proper resume and build an effective LinkedIn profile until you find a job.\n\nSQL\n\nStructured Query Language (SQL) is used to communicate with a database. According to ANSI (American National Standards Institute), it is accepted as the standard language for relation-based database management systems.\n\nSQL is used for tasks such as data control, querying, data definition, and database management through database management systems. Its popularity and use have played a significant role in developing database technologies.\n\nAdvanced SQL\n\nAdvanced SQL refers to more complex and powerful features and techniques beyond the basic elements of SQL. It includes advanced query making, data manipulation, and improvment techniques that allow for more sophisticated and efficient database operations.\n\nJDBC\n\nJDBC (Java DataBase Connectivity) is an application programming link that allows applications written in Java to interact with the database. With JDBC, we can connect to databases such as MySQL, Oracle, and MS SQL Server and easily handle our operations, such as extracting, updating, deleting, and adding data from these databases.\n\nHTML - CSS\n\nHTML sets the structure and content, while CSS decides on the style and visual organization of a web page. You will learn structures and the necessary features of both languages in our course.\n\nSelenium\n\nSelenium is a test automation tool used for testing web applications. It enables the automation of test scenarios performed on web browsers. A large user community widely adopts it because it is compatible with several programming languages and support for different web browsers.\n\nIn the early 2000s, Mercury Interactive dominated the world of test automation with its test tool, Astra Quick Test. Despite its wide adoption, this test tool was not particularly successful. It only supported testing on the Windows platform, had limited browser support, and could only be used with the VBScript programming language.\n\nIn 2004, Jason Huggins came up with a revolutionary idea. He developed a tool in response to the limits of Astra Quick Test, and Mercury Interactive's increasing popularity despite those limits. He named it Selenium, after the element used in the treatment of Mercury Poisoning. The birth of the Selenium Test Library occurred in this way.\n\nAPI\n\nApplication Programming Interface is a protocol that connects two software elements and a server. APIs are devices that allow two software elements to communicate with each other through specific definitions and protocols. In the context of APIs, “application” refers to any software with a separate function. An interface is a service contract between two applications. This contract defines how the two will communicate using requests and responses.\n\nAPI architecture is usually described in terms of clients and servers. The application that sends the request is called the client, and the application that sends the response is called the server. So in an example based on the weather, the government’s weather database is a server, while the mobile app is a client.\n\nAWS ( Amazon Web Services ) ( Recording )\n\nAWS is a cloud service offered by Amazon that allows users to rent computer power, storage space, and other technical assistance over the Internet.\n\nAWS includes many services, such as hosting websites, database services, artificial intelligence and machine learning applications.\n\nThese services allow users to perform technical operations at lower costs and with greater flexibility without using complex systems and software that users must install and manage on their computers or servers.\n\nDocker ( Recording )\n\nDocker is a platform that puts software in a \"container\" and makes it run the same way on different computers and servers. These containers hold all of the software's parts (code, system tools, libraries, settings, etc.) so that the software always works as expected and there are no problems like “it was running badly on my computer.”\n\nJmeter ( Recording )\n\nApache JMeter is a tool that tests and measures the performance of websites and services in Java code. It monitors these results and creates graphs to represent them in a visual way.\n\nJenkins ( Recording )\n\nJenkins is a Continuous Integration (CI) tool that makes the structural processes in a software project automatic in a dynamic way. This allows for quick and easy reporting, testing, and fixing within the project.\n\nJira / Xray\n\nJIRA is a software development tool engineers use to monitor and manage tasks. Xray is the leading Quality Assurance and Test Management app for Jira.\n\nAppium ( Recording )\n\nThis course teaches you about Appium, an open-source testing tool on several platforms. Appium allows test cases for native, hybrid, and web apps, including Android and iOS, to be run automatically.\n\nDuring the course, you'll learn how to set up and use the Appium server to make testing on mobile devices easier. You will learn the basic elements of Android automation testing using Appium and get hands-on experience writing and running automated test scripts for mobile apps.\n\nKey topics covered include:\n\n- Understanding the basic ideas and structure of Appium;\n\n- Using the power of UIAutomator2 to interact with Android apps;\n\n- Using Appium Inspector to examine and analyse the user interface elements of mobile apps;\n\n- Step-by-step instructions for installing and setting up Appium on your machine;\n\n- Integrating Appium with Java for smooth automation; and more.\n\n- Appium 2.0's newest features and improvements will be looked at.\n\n- Using Appium and Selenium to improve web and mobile testing will also be covered.\n\nBy the end of this course, you'll know a lot about mobile testing with Appium and be able to automate test cases and make sure your Android apps are good.\n\nSelenium Grid ( Recording )\n\nSelenium Grid is a part of Selenium Suite, designed to run several tests simultaneously on different browsers, machines, and operating systems.\n\nCypress ( Recording )\n\nCypress is a testing system designed for web applications, making it simpler for developers to script test cases, to make tasks automatic, and to run tests without the need for a separate browser. Equipped with a range of tools, it makes the testing process simpler and faster. As an effective and user-friendly solution, Cypress significantly improves the quality of existing web applications. Recognizing this, TechPro Education has improved its course content by including Cypress training together with Selenium. This improvement promises to provide you with all the necessary skills for a successful career in Test Automation.\n\nMicroservices ( Recording )\n\nThe microservice architecture breaks down software into many small pieces. These pieces are independent services that can communicate and work together. This allows a team to develop and use their service independently from others. It means there are fewer dependent elements in the code, which enables developers to develop their services without being limited by users. Additionally, it hides extra complex elements from users.\n\nInternship project\n\nIn the internship project, you can use Java, Selenium, GitHub, Jira, SQL, Jenkins, HTML, SDLC, and other applications that you have learnt about during the course in real projects.\n\nTimetable\n\nTurkish Course Day Time Timetable\n\nDay\n\nEST\n\nCET\n\nTSI\n\nMonday\n\n04:00 am - 06:50 am\n\n10:00 - 12:50\n\n11:00 - 13:50\n\nTuesday\n\n04:00 am - 06:50 am\n\n10:00 - 12:50\n\n11:00 - 13:50\n\nWednesday\n\n04:00 am - 06:50 am\n\n10:00 - 12:50\n\n11:00 - 13:50\n\nThursday\n\n04:00 am - 06:50 am\n\n10:00 - 12:50\n\n11:00 - 13:50\n\nFriday\n\n11:30 am - 04:20 pm\n\n17:30 - 22:20\n\n18:30 - 23:20\n\nSaturday\n\n11:30 am - 04:20 pm\n\n17:30 - 22:20\n\n18:30 - 23:20\n\nSunday\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\nEST : Eastern Standard Time\n\nCET : Central European Time\n\nTSI : Turkish Time\n\nTurkish Course Night Time Timetable\n\nDay\n\nEST\n\nCET\n\nTSI\n\nMonday\n\n01:30 pm - 04:20 pm\n\n19:30 - 22:20\n\n20:30 - 23:20\n\nTuesday\n\n01:30 pm - 04:20 pm\n\n19:30 - 22:20\n\n20:30 - 23:20\n\nWednesday\n\n01:30 pm - 04:20 pm\n\n19:30 - 22:20\n\n20:30 - 23:20\n\nThursday\n\n01:30 pm - 04:20 pm\n\n19:30 - 22:20\n\n20:30 - 23:20\n\nFriday\n\n11:30 am - 04:20 pm\n\n17:30 - 22:20\n\n18:30 - 23:20\n\nSaturday\n\n11:30 am - 04:20 pm\n\n17:30 - 22:20\n\n18:30 - 23:20\n\nSunday\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\nEST : Eastern Standard Time\n\nCET : Central European Time\n\nTSI : Turkish Time\n\nEnglish Course Day Time Timetable\n\nEST : Eastern Standard Time\n\nCET : Central European Time\n\nTSI : Turkish Time\n\nEnglish Course Night Time Timetable\n\nEST : Eastern Standard Time\n\nCET : Central European Time\n\nTSI : Turkish Time\n\nNote: Please note that schedules may change due to daylight saving time in summer and winter.\n\nFAQ\n\nWhy Test Automation is needed?\n\nHere are the reasons why test automation is needed:\n\n- All work schedules, all areas, and manual testing of all negative scenarios take time and money,\n\n- It is hard to test websites that are in different language versions,\n\n- Automatic tests do not need human particpation.
