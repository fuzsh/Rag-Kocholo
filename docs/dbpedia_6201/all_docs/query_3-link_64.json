        "text": "Professional and Career Development\n\nWe promote a culture of lifelong learning. Our work is driven by our passion to learn and grow in a collaborative environment that leads to innovative solutions. Our goal is to attract, develop, and retain talent and inspired by our commitment to provide an exceptional employee experience. Centered around the 4 \"E\"s of development—Education, Experience, Exposure, and Evaluation—our development philosophy propels a blended learning experience which supports the professional and career development of One Mercury team members scalability. Our program of offerings includes digital, innovative solutions to empower growth and development:\n\nAccess to LinkedIn Learning\n\nFormal mentoring programs\n\nCareer development roadmaps\n\nLeadership development programs and external coaching\n\nFormal and informal cohort discussions and learning\n\nJust-in-time informational webinars\n\nTuition reimbursement\n\nIntern and co-op programs\n\nOur development offerings are listed and available through a robust development portfolio for all team members on our Learning & Development Portal.\n\nUpon joining Mercury, each team member is given a LinkedIn Learning account that enables them to access over 16,000 online courses to learn business, creative, and technology skills to achieve their personal and professional goals. Team members leverage this resource to set and reach their career goals and develop skills, as well as explore new interests. LinkedIn Learning also offers certification programs in certain discipline areas. Each month we promote timely, curated content to our team members to support their growth and development.\n\nThere are several opportunities to learn from fellow team members at Mercury, including through our mentoring programs. Mentoring at Mercury fosters connection between team members across the organization and we have developed programs aligned with key focus areas, including career development, leadership, and general and discipline-specific knowledge sharing.\n\nTeam members also engage with each other through formal and informal cohort discussions, including Fireside Chats and Coffee Talks. These events foster a sense of belonging among the One Mercury community, connecting team members with each other and leaders to promote sharing of diverse thought and perspectives.\n\nOur Leader Success Model is at the foundation of our highly rated leadership development programs. Leaders are developed through a blended learning experience which includes programming, 360° Assessments, executive coaching, and exposure to the C-Suite. Our leadership programs are targeted towards high performing team members across the matrix who are interested pursuing the management career path.\n\nWe offer a two-year engineering rotational program to recent college graduates in electrical, firmware, software, RF, and systems engineering disciplines. During the program, team members gain insight and experience rotating through multiple business units and engineering disciplines. Upon program completion, these team members will be matched with a role at Mercury aligned with their skills, interests, and career development goals.\n\nWe have a pay-for-performance culture, and we pride ourselves on giving timely, honest and respectful feedback. This is why we encourage employees to engage in multiple talent talks with their leaders each year.\n\nWe encourage our employees to take advantage of higher education and professional development opportunities. We reimburse employees 100% for tuition and lab fees for up to the IRS non-taxable limit.\n\nWe value the feedback of our team members. Our listening strategy includes the deployment of our Culture and Engagement Survey twice per year, which enables us to gather anonymous feedback from the One Mercury team about what we’re doing well and the areas in which we can improve. Over the past three years, we’ve had strong participation—on average, over 80% of our team members contribute to each survey, which is above the global benchmark. We prioritize taking action based on the insights provided by our team members—in addition to action taken on the organization-level, teams across the company engage in an action planning process after each survey in order to drive positive change. Team members participate in a dialogue about their survey results and select focus areas on which to collaborate.\n\nEmployee Demographics and Statistics\n\nGender Diversity\n\nThe gender diversity of our U.S. employees is provided below for the three most recent fiscal years.\n\n2021 2022 2023 Women Employees 30% 29% 29% Managers 18% 19% 21% Technical Employees 11% 11% 11% Men Employees 70% 71% 71% Managers 82% 81% 79% Technical Employees 89% 89% 89%\n\nWe have a focused strategy to attract women engineers and women in leadership and technical roles.\n\nRace/Ethnicity Diversity\n\nThe racial/ethnic diversity of our U.S. employees is provided below for the three most recent fiscal years.\n\n2021 2022 2023 Black or African American 4.0% 4.0% 4.0% Asian 19% 19% 19% Hispanic/Latino 15% 15% 16% Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islander/Native American/Alaska Native 1.0% 1.0% 1.0% White 58% 58% 57% Two or More Races 2.0% 3.0% 2.0% Not Specified 0.4% 0.2% 0.1%\n\nVoluntary and Involuntary Termination Data\n\nOur voluntary and involuntary termination data for the three most recent fiscal years is reported below.\n\ncalendar year involuntary terminations voluntary terminations 2023 4% 12% 2022 6% 14% 2021 9% 13%\n\nOur attrition rates are consistent with the defense and technology sectors.

We value the diversity of the people with whom we work and the contributions they make. We do not tolerate discrimination or harassment. We are committed to equal opportunity and to maintaining a workplace that is free from discrimination or harassment on the basis of race, color, gender, sex (including pregnancy, childbirth and related medical conditions), national origin, ancestry, age, religion, physical or mental disability, medical condition, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, genetic information, military or veteran status, marital status, a person’s request for family care leave, pregnancy disability leave, or leave for an employee’s own serious health condition, or any other characteristic protected by applicable law.\n\nWe expect our employees, suppliers, customers and other stakeholders to share a similar commitment to equal opportunity, diversity and inclusion.
