        "text": "Total Resource Management, Inc (TRM), a leading asset management consulting and technology company, announced today that it has joined the Mercury Alliance Program. The agreement allows TRM the capability to extend its portfolio of products and services to include Mercury’s business technology optimization (BTO) products.\n\nThe alliance agreement supports TRM’s dedication to the delivery of fully integrated, enterprise-wide information technology solutions that are aligned with business process improvements, organization performance and its clients’ overall business strategies. TRM’s professional services, when combined with Mercury’s products, offer customers a method to help accelerate application delivery, improve quality, optimize solution performance and better meet service level agreements. Engagements are staffed with highly qualified and trained personnel from both organizations, who execute functional and regression testing and conduct performance benchmarking and tuning.\n\n“We created this approach from the lessons learned during the implementation of a large-scale enterprise asset and maintenance management system involving the consolidation and integration of many systems, locations and business processes into one centralized system,” explained Don Omura, executive vice president of Pacific Operations for TRM. “Our project team has worked closely with Mercury to mitigate risks and to ensure a quality delivery and end-user satisfaction.”\n\n“Mercury was a key part of the success of this project, and we at TRM are delighted to have the opportunity to formalize our partnership,” Omura said. “We believe that the products and services we can make available this way will ensure that all of our clients’ system applications – many of which are vital to the operation and maintenance of facilities and plants – maintain optimum application uptime, availability and performance.”\n\nAbout TRM\n\nTotal Resource Management, Inc. (TRM) delivers consulting and information technology solutions that help organizations improve the management and performance of their enterprise assets (facilities, infrastructure and production). Over the past decade, TRM has supported nearly 200 clients with enterprise asset management expertise, professional services and productivity enhancement products that result in significant improvements to their business operations. TRM was founded in 1993. Its headquarters are located in Alexandria, VA, and supporting offices are located across the U.S. TRM’s Advanced Technology Centers are located in Virginia, California, Washington and Hawaii.
