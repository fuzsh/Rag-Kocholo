        "text": "The Suricata Open Source Manifesto\n\nOpen source means different things to different people. Here is what it means to us.\n\nFreedom\n\nSuricata is dedicated to and aligned with what we believe is the truest form of open source. That starts with our GPLv2 license, which is issued by GNU to organizations that offer free software (software that is free to use, not free in price).\n\nOpen source software awards you with four specific freedoms:\n\nThe freedom to run the program as you wish\n\nThe freedom to copy the program and give it away to others\n\nThe freedom to change the program as you wish, by having full access to source code\n\nThe freedom to distribute an improved version and thus help build the community\n\nIn abiding with this code, Suricata is truly open to use and tailor in the most meaningful ways to support threat detection.\n\nNonprofit Organization\n\nUnlike many open source projects today, Suricata’s operations and support are also open. The copyright for the code is owned by the Open Information Security Foundation (OISF), a nonprofit organization specifically created to protect the interests of Suricata’s open source community. Without interference from a commercial enterprise, Suricata will remain open source, governed equally by the community and vendors who rely on and help maintain the engine.\n\nTransparency\n\nTrue to our open source roots, transparency is integral to our philosophy. Suricata’s bug tracker, development roadmap and code are available for all to see at any time. Project management and decisions are made by the community in the open. And true to the spirit of open source, if you have a need or an opinion, you have a voice. We welcome the input of our entire community.\n\nCollaboration\n\nSuricata supports and integrates with some of the world’s leading commercial solutions. Our non-GPL licensing, offered through OISF, empowers these organizations to use Suricata in their products without violating GPL. To inquire about a non-GPL license and join the OISF consortium, please contact info@oisf.net.\n\nCurious if you are GPL compliant?\n\nReference:\n\nOur GPL Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) page\n\nhttps://suricata.io/gpl-faqs/\n\nGNU General Public License, version 2\n\nhttps://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.html\n\nFAQs about version 2 of the GNU GPL\n\nhttps://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0-faq.en.html"
