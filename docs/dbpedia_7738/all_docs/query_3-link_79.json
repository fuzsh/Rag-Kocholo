        "text": "I am completely new to entware and I would like to run it on my Voxel Frimware Orbi. Is there a beginner guide on how to set this up? I tried reading Voxel’s readme file with no luck. I tried searching forums but it was a bit complex for me. If anyone can point me in the right direction, I would really appreciate it. Thanks!\n\nThere is QuickStart.txt instruction included into ZIP with firmware for RBR and RBS. IMO it is simplified as much as possible:\n\n. . .\n\n4. Entware.\n\nYou can use Entware prepared by me for R7500/R7800/R9000. It works fine with Orbi.\n\n(1) Prepare new USB stick or disk with ext2 or ext3 or ext4 filesystem from telnet/ssh\n\nconsole. Label it “optware”. ext4 is highly recommended for USB HDD. Example how\n\nto create ext4 filesystem with label “optware”:\n\nmkfs.ext4 -L optware /dev/sda1\n\nor\n\nmkfs.ext4 -L optware -O ^metadata_csum /dev/sda1\n\nto provide compatibility for routers having kernel < 3.6, such as R7500/R7800.\n\n(2) Unpack entware-cortexa15-3x-initial.tar at the root of your stick/disk:\n\ncd /mnt/sda1\n\nwget https://www.voxel-firmware.com/Downloads/Voxel/Entware/entware-cortex-a15-3x-initial-generic.tar.gz\n\ntar xf entware-cortexa15-3x-initial.tar\n\n(3) Run the command from telnet/ssh console:\n\nnvram set nocloud=1\n\nnvram commit\n\n(4) Create the file /overlay/root/ .profile to set PATH for Entware:\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#!/bin/sh\n\nexport PATH=/opt/bin:/opt/sbin:/bin:/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/sbin\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n(5) Reboot the router/satellite. Check that “ls -l /opt/*” shows entware directories\n\nor symlinks (bin, usr, share, var etc.)\n\n. . .\n\nAfter that you may install the package you want. List of packages is available from:\n\nhttps://voxel-firmware.com/Downloads/Voxel/html/entware.html\n\nBriefly how to use Entware:\n\nhttps://github.com/Entware/Entware/wiki\n\n[Edited]:\n\nFound the place in instruction what I need to change because of upgraded version mkfs.ext4. In example. Should be:\n\n. . .\n\n(1) Prepare new USB stick or disk with ext2 or ext3 or ext4 filesystem from telnet/ssh\n\nconsole. Label it “optware”. ext4 is highly recommended for USB HDD. Example how\n\nto create ext4 filesystem with label “optware”:\n\nmkfs.ext4 -L optware -O ^64bit /dev/sda1\n\nor\n\nmkfs.ext4 -L optware -O ^metadata_csum -O ^64bit /dev/sda1\n\nto provide compatibility for routers having kernel < 3.6, such as R7500/R7800.\n\n. . .\n\nVoxel.\n\nI have now thanks to @Voxel and @kamoj (for their great firmware) and a beginner book for Linux been able to test Suricata IDS/IPS.\n\nI bluntly stole @rgnldo set up for the Asus guys. It seems to work pretty good I have allot more learning to do about Suricata to tell for sure how good it is working.\n\nBut I can see in the logs that it at least is giving me output on some of what is happening in the network.\n\nSuricata - Suricata - IDS on AsusWRT Merlin\n\nSuricata is a free and open source, mature, fast and robust network threat detection engine. The Suricata engine is capable of real time intrusion detection (IDS), inline intrusion prevention (IPS), network security monitoring (NSM) and offline pcap processing. Suricata inspects the network...\n\nWith my r9000 running with always updated Voxel and updated Kamoj, Wireguard, DNS-crypt defended with Aegis and now also Suricata I checked with netdata how the router seem to handle the extra load.\n\nThe router is besides the extra programs used to download and to watch plex and work with the daily activites of a household in Corona times.\n\nCPU is steady around 7-12 percent and at a peak time 60 percent.\n\nRam is about 60 percent used and no heat spikes in the router that worry me. Wifi-speed dont seem to have taken any noticeably hit ether. It is to early to tell for me but it is possible I lost some percent in output.\n\nIf anyone else on the Netgear side will be playing around with Suricata it would be really fun to know how you set it up.\n\nTo fully trust the system is set up correctly it would be wonderful if if some of our Netgear experts here started to dig in this program.\n\nWell just wanted to share some possibilities with Voxel/Kamojs firmware.\n\nI have humble question about the Suricata. I am now confident I have it up and running. Thanks so much Voxel and Kamoj for the opportunity to play around with this and make it possible.\n\nBut as always the grass is greener on the other side and suricata have a newer version. On the entware list its 4.1.8.1. The newest version is 5.0.3 and I want that one. Tried to install it myself but when I got to the installation of .config it didn't work out.\n\nIs it possible to get that 5 version in the entware list as a ipk file for our netgear routers? If it is that would make my day.\n\nEdit: Suricata v5 config.log\n\nCode:\n\n$ ./configure ## --------- ## ## Platform. ## ## --------- ## hostname = R9000 uname -m = armv7l uname -r = 3.10.20-al-5.0-ga_na uname -s = Linux uname -v = #1 SMP Fri Jul 24 08:05:54 UTC 2020 /usr/bin/uname -p = unknown /bin/uname -X = unknown /bin/arch = unknown /usr/bin/arch -k = unknown /usr/convex/getsysinfo = unknown /usr/bin/hostinfo = unknown /bin/machine = unknown /usr/bin/oslevel = unknown /bin/universe = unknown PATH: /bin PATH: /sbin PATH: /usr/bin PATH: /usr/sbin ## ----------- ## ## Core tests. ## ## ----------- ## configure:2764: checking whether make supports nested variables configure:2781: result: no configure:2841: checking for a BSD-compatible install configure:2909: result: ./install-sh -c configure:2920: checking whether build environment is sane configure:2975: result: yes configure:3126: checking for a thread-safe mkdir -p configure:3165: result: ./install-sh -c -d configure:3172: checking for gawk configure:3202: result: no configure:3172: checking for mawk configure:3202: result: no configure:3172: checking for nawk configure:3202: result: no configure:3172: checking for awk configure:3188: found /usr/bin/awk configure:3199: result: awk configure:3210: checking whether make sets $(MAKE) configure:3236: result: no configure:3328: checking whether UID '0' is supported by ustar format configure:3331: result: yes configure:3338: checking whether GID '0' is supported by ustar format configure:3341: result: yes configure:3349: checking how to create a ustar tar archive configure:3360: tar --version tar (GNU tar) 1.32 Copyright (C) 2019 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
