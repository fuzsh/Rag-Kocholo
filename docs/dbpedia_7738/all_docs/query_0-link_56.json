Short Name Change When a particular license short name is changed and released as part of an electronic update, the short name is not automatically propagated to the inventory items with that selected license. For example, when we change the short name of license id 343 from \"GPL-1.0” to “GPL-1.0-only” in an electronic update, the existing inventory items names with that selected license will not be updated. 2. Component to License Mapping Change When the component to license mapping is changed, let’s say jquery is mapped with \"Apache-2.0\" in the electronic update, then this new mapping wouldn’t be propagated to existing inventory items. This results in inconsistency between the license mapping, existing inventory items, and future inventory items using the new license mapping. 3. Duplicate entry cleanup After running the cleanup scripts, there are possibility of having duplicate entries for the licenses which had mappings in component table and versions table. In our case, we have mappings for 3 licenses, i.e LGPL-2.1-or-later(License_id=704), AGPL-1.0-only(License_id=1654) and AGPL-3.0-only(License_id=229). Note: Around 16 GPL-AGPL-LGPL related licenses are updated and workaround has been provided for necessary scenarios.

Issues/Bugs Addressed The following issues were addressed in the Update: MIT License Cleanup There are two licenses in Code Insight for MIT – MIT License and MIT-Style License. While most licenses declared by open-source developers fall into the MIT License, the MIT-Style License is more of a template license consisting of various ways of how MIT license can be declared. We noticed that the license mapping to majority of components are mapped incorrectly to the MIT-Style License. This is being resolved via an electronic update where the mappings are corrected and for existing projects that need mappings change a script will be provided. Note: Please refer the article on MIT License Cleanup for detailed information and workarounds: https://community.flexera.com/t5/Code-Insight-Knowledge-Base/Code-Insight-MIT-License-Data-Cleanup-Project/ta-p/214451/jump-to/first-unread-message Known issue: A script \"MIT-CleanupQueries.sql\" is provided which has to be run after the PDL update. This script updates the license names and the incorrect license mappings in the existing system-generated inventories with the updated data changes as mentioned above. There is a known issue for a particular set of inventories which have comma separated license names. This is observed in the inventories generated by AutoWriteup. Ex: jQuery (MIT, MIT License) In this case, the script provided to update the existing inventory names would not work. This causes a duplicate inventory on rescan.
