Are they allowed to distribute it to others under the terms of the GPLv2? If no, you need a license from the OISF.\n\nIf your end-user replaced the Suricata binary as shipped by you, with one compiled from the unmodified source code, would your device continue to work? If no, you likely need a license.\n\nYes, I have modified Suricata.\n\nIf you have modified Suricata you may still be able to distribute it without a license provided all your modifications are made available with the Suricata source code and licensed in a GPLv2 compatible manner. The source code plus your modifications must be made available to your end-users upon request. And they are allowed to redistribute it under the terms of the GPLv2.\n\nIf you want to, or need to keep your modifications proprietary you must contact the OISF regarding licensing.\n\nYes, I have modified Suricata and/or am linking to libraries developed by us.\n\nThis is pretty much the same as having modified Suricata, as you most likely have modified Suricata to call functions in the libraries you have developed.\n\nThis will require redistribution of the modified Suricata source code along with any linked to library source code under the terms of the GPLv2.\n\nIf you cannot distribute your libraries under the GPL you will need to contact the OISF.\n\nIâ€™m confused, can you tell me what to do?\n\nWe can likely provide some guidance even if that guidance is to recommend you seek legal advice. If reaching out to us, please provide the following information:\n\nHave you modified Suricata in any way?\n\nAre you linking Suricata against any libraries NOT included in your software distribution?\n\nIf yes, what are they?\n\nIf in doubt, please contact the OISF â€“ info@oisf.net\n\nReference\n\nGNU General Public License, version 2\n\nhttps://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.html\n\nFrequently Asked Questions about version 2 of the GNU GPL\n\nhttps://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0-faq.en.html"
