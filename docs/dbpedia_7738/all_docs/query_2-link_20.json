        "meta_description": "Stratiomyomorpha (soldier flies and allies) is an ingroup of Diptera, with a fossil record stretching back to the Early Cretaceous (the Barremian, about 125 MYA). Stratiomyomorpha includes at least 3,000 species in the modern fauna, with many species being crucial for ecosystem functions, especially as saprophages. Larvae of many stratiomyomorphans are especially important as scavengers and saproxyls in modern ecosystems. Yet, fossil larvae of the group are extremely scarce. Here we present 23 new records of fossil stratiomyomorphan larvae, representing six discrete morphotypes. Specimens originate from Cretaceous amber from Myanmar, Eocene Baltic amber, Miocene Dominican amber, and compression fossils from the Eocene of Messel (Germany) and the Miocene of Slovenia. We discuss the implications of these new records for our understanding of stratiomyomorphan ecomorphology in deep time as well as their palaeoecology.",

        "text": "General shared appearance\n\nHabitus. Small to medium-sized larva with slightly dorsoventrally flattened, spindle-shaped body. The body is fully covered with oval pellets, supposedly of calcium carbonate composition (although it is impossible to ascertain this aspect for the fossil forms) (Figs. 1A, 1B, 2A–2C, 3A-3C and 4A).\n\nBody length from 2 mm to slightly less than 20 mm. The body differentiated into presumably 20 segments, ocular segment plus 19 post-ocular segments (Figs. 1A, 1B, 2A–2C and 4A–4C). Anterior segments are forming a distinct head capsule.\n\nThe head capsule sclerotized anteriorly, posterior part (one third to one half) reduced to several longitudinal structures, retracted into the anterior trunk (prothorax). The head capsule is formed by an ocular segment plus five post-ocular segments.\n\nOcular segment recognizable by its appendage derivative, clypeo-labral complex. The clypeus (clypeal sclerite) is longer than it is wide. Labrum is roughly triangular, much longer than wide, strongly sclerotized (Figs. 2A–2C, 3B and 3C). The segment with small stemmata (“eye prominences”), anteromedially.\n\nPost-ocular segment 1, with a pair of antennae [antennulae in generalized terminology]. The antenna of Stratiomyomorpha larvae stout, comprising two elements, sitting in dorsoanterior position, or more towards the center of the dorsal surface of the head capsule. In many fossil specimens not preserved or not visible (Figs. 4B and 4C).\n\nPost-ocular segment 2 (intercalary segment) without externally recognizable structures, not identifiable in the post-embryonic development of most larvae of Diptera. It might be argued that discussion of such seemingly absent structure in the description is unnecessary, or mixing conjectures with observed structures. We will say, on the contrary: there is the knowledge and hence expectation of the presence of this segment based on prior experience. Yet, we do not see it. In broader comparison, this is, in fact, informative and needs to be included in the taxa description.\n\nPost-ocular segments 3 and 4 were recognizable by their appendages: mandibles and maxillae [maxillula in generalized terminology]. Mandibles and maxillae form a single compound, the mandibular-maxillary complex (autapomorphy of Stratyomyomorpha), comprising elements largely indistinguishable, apart from the distal parts of the maxillae (maxillary palp). Maxillary palps quite stout, but prominent (Schremmer, 1951). The proximal portion of the mandibular-maxillary complex, fully sclerotized; with strong, multi-branched setae on its dorsodistal surface, as well as laterally. Distal part or palp conical, with two elements (palpomeres). The apical part of the mandibular-maxillary complex bears an arrangement of the setae (“brush”) of varying complexity (autapomorphy of Stratyomyomorpha). Basal part bearing a ventral \"grinder\", which is heavily sclerotized (Figs. 3A–3C, 4B and 4C). On the ventral side, the mandibular-maxillary complex forms ventral plates, occupying the ventral side of the head capsule (Sinclair, 1992).\n\nTrunk (thorax + abdomen) with eleven visible units, interpreted as three thorax segments, seven abdominal segments and a trunk end (abdomen unit 8). Cuticle covered with round deposits of calcium carbonate pellets, forming a honeycomb-like pattern (autapomorphy of Stratyomyomorpha). Remark: It is difficult to ascertain that the cuticle of the fossils is indeed covered in calcium carbonate pellets. It cannot be excluded that such cuticle scales are simple chitin as in larvae of the Ephydridae or Oestridae (Marshall, 2012).\n\nTrunk units are without any parapods, creeping welts or protuberances. Different arrangements of spiracles possible: (1) Trunk bears nine pairs of spiracles (openings of the tracheal system): one pair of spiracles on thr prothorax, and eight pairs on the posterior trunk (abdomen). This type of tracheal system is called peripneustic (Hennig, 1952). (2) Most spiracles reduced, amphipneustic (spiracles present on prothorax and trunk end) or (3) methapneustic (spiracles on trunk end only) (McFadden, 1967) (Figs. 2A–2C; Figs. S4A–S4D).\n\nThe anterior trunk or thorax has three segments, pro-, meso- and methathorax. Armament represented by the calcium carbonate pellets and large rhombic sclerites on the sternites, occasionally with some modified, spike-like setae. Prothorax with 2–3 pairs of anterodorsal setae.\n\nMesothorax and metathorax have numerous dorsal and ventral setae as well as multiple pellets of calcium carbonate (Figs. 1A and 2B). All three units (= segments in this case) of the anterior trunk (thorax) are having very uniform setation. Each of the thoracic segments bears three pairs of dorsal setae (D1–D3), one pair of dorsolateral setae, and one pair of ventrolateral setae. Additionally, each thoracic segment bears two pairs of ventral setae (Figs. 1A and 2B). The inner pair of ventral setae simple; the outer pair contains several branched setae. The latter also is known as “thoracic leg group” setae.\n\nPosterior trunk (abdomen) units 1–7 with setae arranged in a uniform pattern. This pattern includes three pairs of dorsal setae, in addition to a single pair of dorsolateral and a pair of ventrolateral setae on each of the abdominal units. Each of these units also bears one or two pairs of lateral setae. These lateral setae can be quite prominent. Additionally, three (sometimes four) pairs of ventral setae arranged in a transverse row on the sternites of abdominal units 1–7. The trunk end (abdomen unit 8) bears two pairs of lateral setae, which are often quite long. Additionally, the trunk end bears one pair of subapical setae, and one pair of apical setae. The setae of both groups are usually relatively short. Dorsal setae are present but rarely prominent on the trunk end. A large anal cleft (anus) present on the ventro-terminal part of the trunk end. Around this cleft, the ventral setae arranged in five pairs, situated along and behind the anal cleft (Fig. 1B).\n\nSummary of main results\n\nIn total, we can distinguish six different morphotypes among the studied fossil larvae.\n\nMorphotype 1 (Stratiomyomorpha)\n\nMaterial examined: 13 specimens (PED-0025, PED-0031_1, PED-0031_2, PED-0031_3, PED-0031_4, PED-0041, PED-0113, PED-0152_1, PED-0152_2, PED-0152_3, PED-0243, PED-0349, PED-0362) in 8 amber pieces (see Table 1; Fig. S1).

Prothorax has several small setae on the dorsal surface (Figs. 10A and 10B; Figs. S12A, S12B, S13A and S13B).\n\nMesothorax is 300 µm long, ring-shaped, bearing no spiracles, with lighter area in the center of the sternite (probably due to the sediment filling the depressions of the fossil).\n\nMetathorax is 250 µm long, ring-shaped, with the lighter area in the center of the sternite (probably due to the sediment filling the depressions of the fossil).\n\nPosterior trunk (abdomen) with eight distinct units. Anterior seven units representing proper segments. Posterior trunk mostly oval with rounded posterior hind-end (Figs. 10A and 10B; Figs. S12A, S12B, S13A and S13B).\n\nAbdomen units 1–7 are 320–610 µm long. Cuticle is split along the lateral side, medio-laterally; therefore units 5–7 (and the trunk end) are folded over the ventral parts of the units 1–4. This damage reveals the inner dorsal surface of the abdomen units 5–7 (and the trunk end) for direct observation.\n\nTrunk end (abdomen unit 8, undifferentiated abdomen segments 8–11?) semicircular in general shape (dorsoventral view). The trunk end has an anus on ventroterminal part. No cuticular “teeth” are present along anal opening (Figs. 10A and 10B; Fig. S13C).\n\nMorphotype 5 (Stratiomyomorpha: Stratiomyidae: Stratiomyinae)\n\nMaterial examined: a single fossil larva in a piece of Baltic amber from the PED collection (collection number PED-0464). The larva is poorly preserved, covered with air bubbles and cracks in amber; only rear end of the trunk visible well enough to provide any distinguishable features (Figs. 12A and 12B). The piece of amber contains several syninclusions: non-biting midge male (Diptera, Chironomidae), window-gnat (Diptera, Anisopodidae), two dark-winged fungus gnats (Diptera, Sciaridae), large spider (Araneae).\n\nDescription:\n\nHabitus. Medium-sized larva with spindle-shaped body in dorsoventral view, end of the trunk has prominent coronet of large setae. The body mostly obscured by cracks and bubbles in the amber; only rear end is clearly visible. Total length is 4.3 mm. Body differentiated into presumably 20 segments, ocular segment plus 19 post-ocular segments (Figs. 12A and 12B).\n\nTrunk (thorax+abdomen) spindle-shaped, parallel sided, rounded at the hind-end in dorsoventral view. Anterior part of the trunk entirely obscured by cracks. Subdivision of the units unclear. Posterior trunk has densely arranged strong setae. The trunk end (undifferentiated abdominal segments 8–11?) rounded in general shape, carries strong coronet formed by 19 unbranched setae (Figs. 12A and 12B). Additionally, the trunk end bears a pair of large spiracles, surrounded by the coronet of setae and upper and lower sclerotized “lips”.\n\nMorphotype 6 (possibly Stratiomyomorpha: Stratiomyidae)\n\nMaterial examined: two fossil larvae on one slab from the Grube Messel, stored in the S.F. collection (collection number SF-MeI 4666; Figs. 13A and 13C). The fossils are originating from the Messel Formation. Specimens were collected in the year 1994 in grid square E8, 0.9 m to 1.1 m below local stratigraphic marker horizon alpha. The larvae are poorly preserved, only traces of the head capsules and the rest of the bodies can be seen; no traces of any setae are preserved; nevertheless, both specimens show a well-preserved coloration pattern of the tergites.\n\nDescription:\n\nHabitus. Medium-sized larva with spindle-shaped body. Accessible only in dorsal aspect.\n\nBody length is 3.0–3.5 mm (n = 2). Body differentiated into presumably 20 segments, ocular segment plus 19 post-ocular segments (Figs. 13A–13C). Anterior segments forming a distinct head capsule.\n\nHead capsule is partially sclerotized, longer than wide, posterior part of the head capsule retracted into the anterior trunk (prothorax). Head capsule visible only in vague outlines, with several longitudinal structures (unpaired—metacephalic rod, paired—tentorial arms). These structures are heavily sclerotized. Posterior part of the head capsule is more heavily sclerotized (Figs. 13A–13C). Width of head capsule is ca. 270 µm. Other units of the body are difficult to measure due to the poorly visible borders between the segments.\n\nAnterior segments not apparent, without prominent structures.\n\nPost-ocular segment 5 is recognizable by an internally located pharyngeal grinding mill (visible in both fossil specimens; Fig. 13C).\n\nTrunk (thorax+abdomen) spindle-shaped, parallel-sided, rounded at the hind-end. With eleven units: three thorax segments, seven abdomen segments plus trunk end. Units of the trunk are much wider than long. No setae preserved. No traces of spiracles or a distal coronet of setae present (Fig. 13C).\n\nAnterior trunk, thorax, consisting of pro-, meso-, and metathorax.\n\nProthorax with general outlines visible. Prothorax is heavily sclerotized; posterior part of the head capsule can be seen retracted into the prothorax (Figs. 13A–13C).\n\nMesothorax has two distinct pigment dots at the hind edge (Figs. 13A and 13C).\n\nMetathorax has no spiracles (Figs. 13A–13C).\n\nPosterior trunk (abdomen) with 8 units (Figs. 13A–13C).\n\nAbdomen units 1–6 are bearing distinct lines of pigmentation, two medially on all tergites, and two laterally on most tergites (Figs. 13A–13C).\n\nAbdomen unit 7 has no details preserved; only general outlines can be seen (Figs. 13A–13C).\n\nTrunk end (Abdominal unit 8) with only general outline can be seen: the trunk end square in general shape, with a rounded posterior edge, when viewed in the dorsoventral view (Figs. 13A and 13B). No spiracles or anus can be discerned.\n\nSystematic interpretation\n\nAll specimens can easily be identified as larval forms of Diptera. This interpretation can be based on the general body shape of the specimen, the absence of walking (“ambulatory”) legs on the thorax, as well as the spiracle arrangement. The six morphotypes differ in numerous characters; their systematic relationships are discussed.\n\nMorphotype 1: This morphotype is interpreted to be a representative of the group soldier and timber flies (Stratiomyomorpha) based on the following combination of characters (see Figs. 1A–1C, 2A–2C and 3A–3C; Figs. S1–S7): larva elongated and flattened, with head, thorax and eight abdominal units; body with oval pellets or scales, resembling calcium carbonate scales ; presence of such scales is a synapomorphy of Stratiomyidae+Xylomyidae (Figs. 2A–2C, 3A–3C and 4A–4C; Figs. S1–S7). The thorax of these specimens bears oval pellets or scales, rather than hardened sclerites as in Xylomyidae (Fig. 2B). Mandibles and maxillae are conjoined into a mandibular-maxillary complex (Figs. 4B and 4C). Larvae possess a large molar grinder and a setal brush at this mandibular-maxillary complex (Figs. 4B and 4C). The brush of the mandibular-maxillary complex, as indeed complex itself, is substantially reduced and simplified (Figs. 4B and 4C). This condition is, however, not uncommon among extant representatives of Stratiomyidae, for example in mature larvae of Hermeteiinae and Sarginae.\n\nDespite the overall similarity with larvae of Stratiomyidae, the fossil larvae of morphotype 1 exhibit several traits unknown among any modern forms of Stratiomyomorpha in general. (1) The head capsule of the fossil larvae is extremely elongated with tentorial arms and metacephalic rod reaching back up to the posterior edge of the prothorax (Fig. 3B). (2) The larvae possess long triangular spines on the tergites of the trunk, as well as smaller rounded spines on the sternites of the trunk. This condition is unique among known larvae of Stratiomyomorpha and probably represents an autapomorphy of the morphotype (Fig. 3C).\n\nThis new morphotype clearly differs from two other types of stratiomyomorphan larvae recently reported from the Burmese amber (Liu et al., 2019) by the presence of the extremely long and strong spines on the trunk in the new form, as well as by the absence of the long setae on the posterior trunk (abdomen) and anterior trunk (thorax) (Figs. 2A–2C).\n\nWhile the combination the features is, so far, unknown for Stratiomyomorpha, some of the characters are similar to the other larvae of Diptera. Extremely elongated head capsules and large tergal spines are known in larvae of Asiloidea, especially in the groups Mydidae and Bombyliidae (Marshall, 2012). An elongated metacephalic rod is in particular common in larvae of Mydidae, Xylophagidae, Thervidae and Scenopidae (Hennig, 1952; James, 1981; Irwin & Leneborg, 1981; Kelsey, 1981; Wilcox, 1981). This makes the interpretation of morphotype 1 larvae relatively challenging, due to the “chimaera-like” combination of the traits, as a probable result of the “push of the past” effect (Baranov, Schädel & Haug, 2019; Haug & Haug, 2019). This effect seems quite common among fossil representatives of Holometabola, representing phenomena occurring when initial diversification events in extant hyperdiverse groups lead to a number of “experimental” morphologies (Budd & Mann, 2018; Haug & Haug, 2019). In total we have found 13 larvae of this morphotype, with seven of them being preserved in just two amber pieces (four in PED-0031 and three in PED-0152). Almost all larvae (except PED-0031_1 and PED-0031_2) show signs of severe, most probably pre-mortem damage, such as squashing, full-body piercing, and splitting the body medially (along the pleural region). In some cases, we even see complete mutilation with entire parts of the body (i.e., thorax) being absent from some specimens. The high abundance of this morphotype, as well as their high incidence of damage indicates that these larvae were both frequent, and probably a preferred prey to the other inhabitants of the amber forest in Myanmar. We discuss further aspects of the ecology further below.\n\nMorphotype 2: This morphotype is featuring prominent oval pellets or scales, similar to calcium carbonate nodules of modern larvae of Stratiomyidae. Therefore, we consider this morphotype as a likely ingroup within Stratiomyidae (Figs. 5A, 5B and 6A–6D; Figs. S9A and S9B). A further interpretation within Stratiomyidae is more challenging, due to the relatively poor preservation. Yet, the absence of a coronet of so-called “hydrofuge” setae on the terminal end and a relatively short body both point towards a terrestrial mode of life (McFadden, 1967). Yet such autecological generalizations should be approached with caution. There are species with terrestrial larvae in groups that otherwise have mostly aquatic larvae (e.g., Oxycera (Oxycera) leonina (Panzer & Wolfgang, 1798; Rozkošný, 1997). Also, the other way round, there are species with aquatic larvae in groups that generally have terrestrial larvae (e.g., Ptecticus; Jung et al., 2012). Therefore, morphology of the fossil alone can be an indication, but never a proof of the autecological affinities of an animal.\n\nAlso, this new morphotype clearly differs from two other types of Stratiomyomorpha larvae recently described from amber from Myanmar (Liu, Hakim & Huang, 2020), by the much longer head capsule (in relation to the body), absence of the any spines on the tergites, as well as by the absence of long setae on the trunk.\n\nMorphotype 3: This morphotype clearly has closer relationships with Stratiomyidae based on the presence of a honeycomb pattern formed by oval pellets or scales, presence of a mandibular-maxillary complex and presence of brushes on this complex. Additionally, the habitus of the larva is highly reminiscent of extant terrestrial larvae of the group Stratiomyidae (see below). Within Stratiomyidae, the specimen can be interpreted as an ingroup of Pachygastrinae based on the following combination of characters: absence of a coronet of so-called “hydrofuge” setae on the trunk end; larva uniformly colored; trunk tergites with transversal rows of six setae each; labium not sclerotized and weakly developed; dorsal part of the mandibular-maxillary complex sclerotized; small larva, less than 10 mm (Rozkošný, 1982). Within Pachygastrinae the specimen appears most similar to larvae of the group Gowdeyana Curran, 1928 in lacking cuticular “teeth” along the anal opening; thoracic leg group setae paired; all setae in the dorsal transversal row are subequal (Figs. 7A, 7B and 9).\n\nIn general, the larva is relatively unusual for Pachygastrinae, as it is larger than most last-stage Pachygastrinae larvae (9.5 mm vs. 3–8 mm) and has a peculiar trunk end, elongated, ending with two large spines around the anus. It is possible that this larva belongs to an extinct lineage of Pachygastrinae, and large spines on the trunk and trunk end could represent an autapomorphy of this lineage. Yet, one should bear in mind that larvae for less than 10% of extant species of Pachygastrinae are known (Bucánková, Kovac & Rozkošný, 2009). Hence the possibility remains that the larva may also belong to an extant ingroup of which the larvae are not yet known.\n\nCurrently there are two species of Pachygastrinae known as adults from Dominican and Mexican amber: Pachygaster hymenaea Grund & Hauser (2005) (Figs. S11A and S11B) and P. antiqua James, 1971. The new fossil larva does not fit into the group Pachygaster, as in contrast to larvae of Pachygaster, the new larva does not have three setae in the “thoracic leg group” of setae. Also, the new larva is notably larger than any known larva of Pachygaster (Grund & Hauser, 2005). It is important to note however, that the specimen is rather poorly preserved, and identification should be seen rather as approximation of the phylogenetic affinity rather than final conclusion.\n\nMorphotype 4: This morphotype clearly has closer relationships with Stratiomyidae based on the presence of a honeycomb pattern formed by oval pellets or scales, presence of a mandibular-maxillary complex and presence of brushes on this complex. Additionally, the habitus of the larva is highly reminiscent of extant terrestrial larvae of the group Stratiomyidae (see below). Within Stratiomyidae, further identification is impossible, due to the insufficient preservation of the specimen. The habitus in general is reminiscent of terrestrial larvae of Stratiomyidae, that is, from the ingroup Pachygastrinae.\n\nConsidering the exceptional preservation of this cuticle fossil, it is important to remember the possibility of contamination of the geological record by modern day holometabolan larvae, in particular fly larvae (Rasnitsyn, 2008). Fly larvae are known to crawl into narrow fissures within shales and other types of rocks, effectively creating a hard to spot contamination in the fossil record. The specimen in question has its cuticle interlaced with numerous grains of the sedimentary matrix. In this aspect it is similar to the contamination of late Cretaceous sandstone by an extant fly Protophormia terranovae, as reported by Rasnitsyn (2008: p. 249, figs. 96–97).\n\nYet, the fossil in general seems not to be entirely dissimilar from other euarthropodan fossils known from the same formation, in terms of its preservation (Gašparič & Hyžný, 2015). Additionally, the specimen was collected from a fresh split rock sample and an imprint was observed on the negative (unfortunately not collected). Still, we cannot entirely rule out that this larva is an extant contamination of the shale (Gašparič & Hyžný, 2015).\n\nMorphotype 5: This morphotype seems to be a representative of Stratiomyidae, probably of the ingroups Stratiomyinae, Raphiocerinae or Nemotelinae, based on the presence of a coronet of “hydrofuge” setae (Pujol-Luz, De Xerez & Viana, 2004). The apical position of this coronet on the trunk end is not compatible with an interpretation as an ingroup of Nemotelinae (Hauser, Woodley & Fachin, 2017).\n\nNot much more information could be gained from the larva, except that the “hydrofuge”setae coronet indicates an aquatic, rather than a terrestrial habitat of the animal.\n\nMorphotype 6: This morphotype is represented by two very poorly preserved fossils; therefore, no definitive statement on its phylogenetic affinity can be made. Nevertheless, we decided to include it here, due to the overall similarities in the body shape and presence of the coloration patterns of cuticle, like those in larvae of the group Odontomyia or other representatives of Stratiomyidae (Fig. S14). For these reasons we think that it is prudent to consider this as a probable fossil of the Stratiomyidae, though there are no definite ways to further support this. This morphotype is too poorly preserved for any detailed systematic interpretation. Not much more information could be gained from the larvae, since the poorly preserved body falls into the “unknown” habitat category of the morphospace.\n\nThe fossil record of Stratiomyidae\n\nGiven the important role of larval dipterans, their numerous ecosystem functions and their often very specific association with certain microhabitats (Baranov, Schädel & Haug, 2019), their fossil records can provide a wealth of paleo-ecological information. Hence these new larval stratiomyomorphan specimens widen our understanding of the respective paleo-ecosystems from which they originated. Even on the adult side, representatives of Stratiomyidae are rare in the fossil record, with only 73 occurrences (specimens) having ever been recorded (according to PBDB, for the search parameters see Methods). This number is however excluding representatives of a unique, extinct group of flies with long proboscides (Zhangsolvidae), known from the Early Cretaceous of China and Brazil, as well as Late Cretaceous of Myanmar (Peñalver et al., 2015). These flies have emerged as important pollinators of the gymnosperm plants in the Cretaceous (Peñalver et al., 2015).\n\nIt is common for many organisms living in water to leave traces of their activity. Hence it should not be surprising that in the deep past ichnofossils provide most of the geological record of larval activity of Stratiomyidae, rather than body fossils. The most common example is the Jurassic “ichnogenus” Helminthopsis Heer, 1877. It was interpreted as originally caused by larvae of soldier flies of the group Stratiomys Geoffroy, 1762 or at least a closely related species (Mángano, Buatois & Claps, 1996). This expands the potential range of the geological record of the group from the Barremian (Cretaceous) to the mid Jurassic (Mángano, Buatois & Claps, 1996; Pickerill, Han & Jiang, 1998). Body fossils of stratiomyomorphans, as mentioned, are rare. All known larval fossil records are listed in Table 1, together with the material used in this contribution. Myanmar amber seems to be particularly rich in stratiomyomorphan larvae, as the number of morphotypes known from this deposit now has reached four. Liu, Hakim & Huang (2020) have described two morphotypes of stratiomyomorphan larvae from this amber. Both morphotypes are characterized by features intermediate between two stratiomyomorphan ingroups, Stratiomyidae and Xylomyidae (Liu, Hakim & Huang, 2020). Such chimera-like characteristics are also apparent in the one of the new morphotypes, namely morphotype 1. It can be interpreted as a result of the “Push of the past” phenomenon (Budd & Mann, 2018). In contrast to morphotype 1, morphotype 2 from Myanmar amber has a much less conspicuous morphology, and seemingly is a representative of Stratiomyidae s. str. as characterized by Hauser, Woodley & Fachin (2017).\n\nThe record from Dominican amber, morphotype 3, is only the third record of the group Stratiomyomorpha from this otherwise very productive deposit (Grund & Hauser, 2005). Only two specimens of the species Pachygaster hymenea Grund & Hauser, 2005 and a single specimen of Nothomyia sp. (Poinar & Poinar, 1999) has so far been reported from Dominican amber. This could indicate that representatives of Stratiomyidae were either very rare in the Miocene of Hispaniola, or alternatively their autecology was precluding them from being preserved in amber (Solórzano Kraemer et al., 2018).\n\nThe modern fauna of the isle of Hispaniola includes 13 species of Stratiomyidae (Perez-Gelabert, 2008). This relationship of fossil specimens to extant species is quite different from the situation with another ingroup of Diptera: Chironomidae (non-biting midges). For Chironomidae, there are more fossil species known from Dominican amber than there are extant species on the entire island of Hispaniola (Grund, 2006). The situation of Chironomidae in Dominican amber can be explained by the fact that more attention was given to fossils of Chironomidae of Hispaniola than to the extant ones. The same explanation cannot be applied to the discrepancy in species richness of fossil and extant species of Stratiomyidae. Soldier flies are mid-sized or even large flies; hence, they have a much lower chance of being overlooked in the amber records than Chironomidae. Modern representatives of Stratiomyidae in the Neotropics and other tropical regions are associated with open areas in the forests or forest canopy (Woodley, 2009; Hauser, Woodley & Fachin, 2017). We can therefore hypothesize that Dominican amber was capturing primarily animals associated with tree trunks, rather than canopy fauna or fauna of the open meadows within the forest. A similar capture pattern was shown for the Madagascar copal (Solórzano Kraemer et al., 2018).\n\nThe cuticle fossil from Činžat (morphotype 4) originates from deep-water, low energy sedimentary environment (Gašparič & Hyžný, 2015). It is difficult to explain how a larva of seemingly terrestrial Stratiomyidae ended up there. One possible explanation could be that the specimen drowned with driftwood and other terrestrial debris (which are present in the deposit) after a storm event.\n\nThe larva from Baltic amber is poorly preserved, and only identifiable as a larva of a soldier fly by the presence of the coronet of setae on the rear end. Overall, the fossil resembles extant aquatic larvae of the group Odontomyia (Figs. S14A and S14B), however, there are not enough diagnostic characters for a conclusive identification (also see “Discussion” above). It is still conceivable that this specimen represents a species of Stratiomyidae with an aquatic larva. There are several larval forms of Insecta that have an aquatic lifestyle and have been recorded from Baltic amber. This includes immature of Odonata (damselflies), Ephemeroptera (mayflies), Plecoptera (stoneflies) and Trichoptera (caddisflies) (Wichard, Gröhn & Seredszus, 2009). Martínez-Delclòs, Briggs & Peñalver (2004) suggested that aquatic larvae of Insecta can well be entrapped by still sticky resin pouring into water. This was probably the case for the larva from Baltic amber. This further supports that at least part of the Baltic amber deposits was formed directly next to water, probably in a swampy environment (Wichard, Gröhn & Seredszus, 2009).\n\nThe possible record of larvae of Stratiomyidae from the Eocene of the former maar Lake Messel might represent a rare find of aquatic insect larvae from this deposit. Unfortunately, the larvae are too poorly preserved for the detailed interpretation. Aquatic insects are generally rare in the oil shale of Messel and in other maar lake deposits, because the fossil-bearing sediments (the so-called oil shale) formed only in the deeper parts of the former maar lake, not in its shore-region (Wedmann, 2018). Aquatic insects, such as some larvae of Stratiomyidae were living in the shallow water in the shore region, and they could be only preserved as fossils when they drifted into the deeper, anoxic parts of the meromictic lake where the oil shale was formed.\n\nEco-morphological consideration\n\nThe ecomorphotype, or a shape of an organism adapted to a certain ecological condition, is used here as a proxy for the diversity of forms within a group of organisms (Haug et al., 2020b). Outlines of the entire body, or parts of it have been shown as superior proxies for the shape of an organism in many cases, when landmarks are hard to define, or when such landmarks do not reflect the shape of the organisms well enough (Tatsuta, Takahashi & Sakamaki, 2018). One of the most often used methods for the outline capture in geometric morphometry is a Fourier Elliptical Transformation (Tatsuta, Takahashi & Sakamaki, 2018; Polášek et al., 2018). This method allows accessing the diversity of ecomorphotypes of a group of organisms by examining body outlines. Here we used all available fossil and extant Stratiomyomorpha larvae to trace the changes in the larval morphospace occupancy of the group and, consequentially indirectly, ecological diversity throughout its history.\n\nEcomorphology of extant stratiomyomorphan larvae\n\nNew material examined in this study has shed a light on the far greater larval diversity of the group Stratiomyomorpha in deep time than was expected from the previously known geological records. We analyze the diversity of the ecological morphotypes of stratiomyomorphan larvae through time comparing it to modern ecomorphotype diversity. Here we use ecomorphotypes as a stable shape of an organism that evolved in response to certain ecological conditions (Rotheray, 2019).\n\nStratiomyomorphan larvae are occupying three main types of habitats: (1) aquatic, (2) terrestrial, mostly upper soil, leaf litter, and lower vegetation, and (3) living in wood, hence a saproxylic lifestyle. Many of the extant larvae of Stratiomyomorpha, in particular larvae of Pachygastrinae, are terrestrial saprotrophic and live under the bark of dead wood (McFadden, 1967; Marshall, 2012).\n\nLarvae of Pantophthalmidae are saproxylic, inhabiting living wood (Marshall, 2012). Many other larvae of Stratiomyidae (i.e., not those of Pachygastrinae), are occupying aquatic habitats. In the fossil record, we have some indisputably aquatic larvae, that is, larvae Odontomyia sp. from Randecker Maar (Kühbander & Schleich, 1994) or larvae of Stratiomyia from the Holocene of Germany (Karl & Bellstedt, 1989). The original habitats of other fossil larvae are less clear (Whalley & Jarzembowski, 1985; Liu, Hakim & Huang, 2020).\n\nWe have attempted to compare ecomorphotypes of the extant aquatic, terrestrial and saproxylic stratiomyomorphan larvae with the morphotypes of the fossil larvae. In doing so we hoped to elucidate the changes in the stratiomyomorphan larval morphospace through deep time, as a response to the changing environmental conditions. Our analysis has shown that stratiomyomorphan larvae are showing essentially four main morphotypes: (1) elongated aquatic larvae, roughly circular to oval in the cross-section, as larvae of Stratiomyia, Oxycera, Odontomyia, (2) terrestrial and saproxylic larvae with spindle-shaped or cylindrical bodies (Figs. 14A and 14B). Analyses of the shape distribution in morphospace have shown that thickness of the body and shape of the body at the ends are determining separation of the morphotypes. These two characteristics of shape are of predominant importance, as they are making major contributions into the principal components (P.C.) 1 and 2. These two P.C.s are explaining 36.1% and 21.2% of the shape variability respectively (Figs. 14A and 14B). It is important to note however, that no significant separation between the morphotypes exist, as ascertained by a MANOVA test. P.C.1 and P.C.2 components have p > 0.05, when the type of the habitat is used as an independent variable for morphotypes separation. This is also not surprising as “aquatic” and “terrestrial” groups of the larvae are overlapping broadly in the general shape, and the “saproxylic” larvae morphotype is deeply nested in the “terrestrial” morphospace (Figs. 14A and 14B).\n\nEcomorphology of fossil stratiomyomorphan larvae\n\nThe fossil larvae are widely distributed in the stratiomyomorphan morphospace (Figs. 14A and 14B). Most Cenozoic larvae (from Slovenian shale, Messel, and Baltic amber) fall within the area occupied by modern forms. Also, some of the Cretaceous forms fall within the area occupied by modern forms.\n\nMorphotypes 2, 3, 4 as well as the larvae from Liu, Hakim & Huang (2020) firmly fell into the part of the morphospace occupied by modern terrestrial ecomorphotypes (Fig. 14A). The larva from Baltic amber plots into the “aquatic” type habitats, as did the specimens from morphotype 1, due to their elongated body (Fig. 14A). Despite that, we are hesitant to claim that morphotype 1 larvae are aquatic. Specimens of this morphotype are lacking the tell-tale characteristics of (most) extant aquatic stratiomyomorphan larvae, the coronet of “hydrofuge” setae (Rozkošný, 1997). Additionally, the extremely high abundance of morphotype 1 larvae (at least by the standards of the dipteran larvae in an amber deposit) can be explained by a possible close association with tree trunks. It is possible that these larvae lived under the bark of trees, as seen in many extant larvae of Stratiomyidae (McFadden, 1967; Marshall, 2012). It is well known, that organisms associated with tree trunks in the amber forests had a higher chance of being preserved in amber (Solórzano Kraemer et al., 2018). On top of that, a rich set of the syninclusions present in the amber piece PED-0031 together with morphotype 1 larvae is pointing towards the terrestrial environment (Fig. S2 and S3). Such syninclusions include: a mite, a possible scale insect, parts of other representatives of Insecta, a fly of the group Bibionomorpha, a beetle larva, a spider and a millipede. This strongly indicates a terrestrial environment for morphotype 1 larvae.\n\nOnly one of the morphotypes described by Liu et al. (2019) falls outside of the morphospace occupied by the extant Stratiomyomorphan larvae (Figs. 14A and 14B).\n\nOur analysis has shown that the morphospace of stratiomyomorphan larvae has become significantly larger over time. Only a small part of the occupied area of the morphospace was lost, when we consider the general body shape. We think that increase in the morphospace size of the Stratiomyomorpha can be explained by the gradual diversification of the group from the Late Cretaceous onwards as it was shown by Wiegmann et al. (2011)."
