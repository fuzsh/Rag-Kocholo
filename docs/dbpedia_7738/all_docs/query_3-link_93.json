Part 2 consists of projects that can be done in a group or individually on a semi-semester or on a semester basis. Projects in Part 3 may demand a great deal of work and may require extensive research to be done. Some of the projects in this part may fulfill a Masterâ€™s or even Ph.D. degree project requirements. We have tried as much as possible throughout these projects to encourage instructors and students to use open source as much as possible. This will decouple the content of the Guide from the rapidly changing proprietary software market."
