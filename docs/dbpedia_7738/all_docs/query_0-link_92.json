SELKS can be installed via docker-compose on any Linux or Windows OS. Once installed it is ready to use out of the box solution. SELKS ISOs are also available for air-gapped environments or bare metal or VM installation. SELKS is a showcase of what Suricata IDS/IPS/NSM can do and the network protocol monitoring logs and alerts it produces. As such any and all data in SELKS is generated by Suricata. The usage of Suricata data is further enhanced by Stamus' developed Scirius, a threat-hunting interface. The interface is specifically designed for Suricata events and combines a drill-down approach to pivot for quick exploration of alerts and NSM events. It includes predefined hunting filters and enhanced contextual views.\n\nFeatures\n\nSuricata IDPS/NSM\n\nDocumentation available\n\nIt includes preconfigured dashboards\n\nExamples available\n\nAdditional visualizations and dashboards\n\nThe minimal configuration for production usage is 2 cores and 9 Gb of memory\n\nHTTPS access\n\nBroad-Spectrum Threat Detection\n\nProject Samples\n\nSee All Activity >\n\nCategories\n\nSecurity\n\nLicense\n\nGNU General Public License version 3.0 (GPLv3)\n\nFollow SELKS\n\nSELKS Web Site\n\nYou Might Also Like\n\nUnified ERP Software for Business\n\nCRM and Business Management Software Manage Your Entire Organization with an All-In-One Solution\n\nSuiteMaster is a fully-integrated business platform.
