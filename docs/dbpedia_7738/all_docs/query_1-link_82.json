It does this by storing the frequently used blocks on the faster LV. LVM refers to the small fast LV as a cache pool LV. The large slow LV is called the origin LV. Due to requirements from dm-cache (the kernel driver), LVM further splits the cache pool LV into two devices - the cache data LV and cache metadata LV. The cache data LV is where copies of data blocks are kept from the origin LV to increase speed. The cache metadata LV holds the accounting information that specifies where data blocks are stored (e.g. on the origin LV or on the cache data LV). Users should be familiar with these LVs if they wish to create the best and most robust cached logical volumes. All of these associated LVs must be in the same VG.''\n\nLVM: : ''{{man|8|lvm}} RAID is a way to create a Logical Volume (LV) that uses multiple physical devices to improve performance or tolerate device failures.

The suspend-to-disk mechanism will do its best to ensure the image size will not exceed that number. However, if this turns out to be impossible, it will try to suspend anyway using the smallest image possible. In particular, if \"0\" is written to this file, the suspend image will be as small as possible.

And there is no Alt key used in this! And according to documentation it seems be appropriate for 8-bit encodings, so it should be pretty useless in UTF-8. I reported this bug when it was introduced, but the bug seems to be classified as a feature ... Maybe it's just because the file is auto-loaded though pretty useless.

Hardware RAID controllers are expensive and proprietary. To fill this gap, cheap \"RAID controllers\" were introduced that do not contain a RAID controller chip, but simply a standard disk controller chip with special firmware and drivers. During early stage boot-up, the RAID is implemented by the firmware. When a protected-mode operating system kernel such as Linux or a modern version of Microsoft Windows is loaded, the drivers take over.''\n\nInstalling_with_Fake_RAID: :''These controllers are described by their manufacturers as RAID controllers, and it is rarely made clear to purchasers that the burden of RAID processing is borne by the host computer's central processing unit -- not the RAID controller itself -- thus introducing the aforementioned CPU overhead which hardware controllers do not suffer from. Firmware controllers often can only use certain types of hard drives in their RAID arrays (e.g. SATA for Intel Matrix RAID, as there is neither SCSI nor PATA support in modern Intel ICH southbridges; however, motherboard makers implement RAID controllers outside of the southbridge on some motherboards). Before their introduction, a \"RAID controller\" implied that the controller did the processing, and the new type has become known in technically knowledgeable circles as \"fake RAID\" even though the RAID itself is implemented correctly. Adaptec calls them \"host RAID\".''\n\nJHBuild: :''JHBuild allows you to build and run GNOME platform and applications building the required modules in a sandbox environment, isolating the installation; so there is no need to build and run GNOME inside a virtual machine.''\n\nJumbo_frames: :''In computer networking, jumbo frames are Ethernet frames with more than 1,500 bytes of payload (MTU).

SDDM was written from scratch in C++11 and supports theming via QML. KDE chose SDDM to be the successor of the KDE Display Manager for KDE Plasma 5.''\n\nSubtle: :''Subtle is a manual tiling window manager with a rather uncommon approach of tiling: Instead of relying on predefined layouts, Subtle divides the screen into a grid with customizable slots (called gravities).''\n\nSxhkd: :'' sxhkd is a simple X hotkey daemon with a powerful and compact configuration syntax.''\n\nSystemd: :''systemd'' is a suite of basic building blocks for a Linux system. It provides a system and service manager that runs as PID 1 and starts the rest of the system. systemd provides aggressive parallelization capabilities, uses socket and [[D-Bus]] activation for starting services, offers on-demand starting of daemons, keeps track of processes using Linux [[control groups]], maintains mount and automount points, and implements an elaborate transactional dependency-based service control logic. ''systemd'' supports SysV and LSB init scripts and works as a replacement for sysvinit. Other parts include a logging daemon, utilities to control basic system configuration like the hostname, date, locale, maintain a list of logged-in users and running containers and virtual machines, system accounts, runtime directories and settings, and daemons to manage simple network configuration, network time synchronization, log forwarding, and name resolution.\n\nSystemd-timesyncd: :''systemd-timesyncd'' is a daemon that has been added for synchronizing the system clock across the network. It implements an SNTP client. In contrast to NTP implementations such as chrony or the NTP reference server this only implements a client side, and does not bother with the full NTP complexity, focusing only on querying time from one remote server and synchronizing the local clock to it. Unless you intend to serve NTP to networked clients or want to connect to local hardware clocks this simple NTP client should be more than appropriate for most installations. The daemon runs with minimal privileges, and has been hooked up with networkd to only operate when network connectivity is available. The daemon saves the current clock to disk every time a new NTP sync has been acquired, and uses this to possibly correct the system clock early at bootup, in order to accommodate for systems that lack an RTC such as the Raspberry Pi and embedded devices, and make sure that time monotonically progresses on these systems, even if it is not always correct. To make use of this daemon a new system user and group \"systemd-timesync\" needs to be created on installation of systemd.\n\nSysVinit: :''A runlevel is a software configuration of the system which allows only a selected group of processes to exist. The processes spawned by init for each of these runlevels are defined in the /etc/inittab file.''\n\nThunderbird: :''See upstream Wiki: [http://kb.mozillazine.org/Using_webmail_with_your_email_client Using webmail with your email client].''\n\nTransmission: :''transmission-daemon'': starts the daemon.\n\nTransmission: :''transmission-remote'': invokes the [[Wikipedia:Command-line interface|CLI]] for the daemon, whether local or remote, followed by the command you want the daemon to execute.\n\nTransmission: :''transmission-show'': returns information on a given torrent file.\n\nTransmission: :''transmission-create'': creates a new torrent.\n\nTransmission: :''transmission-edit'': add, delete, or replace a tracker's announce URL.\n\nTransmission: :''transmission-cli'': ([https://github.com/transmission/transmission/commit/950387ab5a443629598f93c057f41150707866ab deprecated]) starts a non-daemonized local instance of ''transmission'', for manually downloading a torrent.\n\nTransmission: :''tremc'': (requires {{AUR|tremc-git}}) starts the [[Wikipedia:curses (programming library)|curses]] interface for the daemon, whether local or remote.\n\nUdev: :''udev'' is a device manager for the Linux kernel. As the successor of ''devfsd'' and ''hotplug'', ''udev'' primarily manages device nodes in the {{ic|/dev}} directory. At the same time, ''udev'' also handles all user space events raised while hardware devices are added into the system or removed from it, including firmware loading as required by certain devices.\n\nUnbound: :''Set {{ic|num-threads}} equal to the number of CPU cores on the system. E.g. for 4 CPUs with 2 cores each, use 8.''\n\nUnity3D: :''Unity is a flexible and powerful development platform for creating multiplatform 3D and 2D games and interactive experiences. It's a complete ecosystem for anyone who aims to build a business on creating high-end content and connecting to their most loyal and enthusiastic players and customers.''\n\nVifm: :'' Vifm is an ncurses based file manager with vi like keybindings/modes/options/commands/configuration, which also borrows some useful ideas from [[mutt]].\n\nWebcam_setup: :''Motion is a program that monitors the video signal from cameras. It is able to detect if a significant part of the picture has changed; in other words, it can detect motion.''\n\nWvdial: :''See main article: [[sudo]]''\n\nXDM: :''Xdm manages a collection of X displays, which may be on the local host or remote servers. The design of xdm was guided by the needs of X terminals as well as The Open Group standard XDMCP, the X Display Manager Control Protocol. Xdm provides services similar to those provided by init, getty and login on character terminals: prompting for login name and password, authenticating the user, and running a \"session.\"''\n\nXen: :''Xen is an open-source type-1 or baremetal hypervisor, which makes it possible to run many instances of an operating system or indeed different operating systems in parallel on a single machine (or host). Xen is the only type-1 hypervisor that is available as open source. Xen is used as the basis for a number of different commercial and open source applications, such as: server virtualization, Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), desktop virtualization, security applications, embedded and hardware appliances.''\n\nXvidcap: :''\"Xvidcap is a small tool to capture things going on on an X-Windows display to either individual frames or an MPEG video. On Windows machines there are commercial tools like Lotus ScreenCam or Camtasia which do a very good job esp. for the purpose I was needing such a tool for: Software documentation, esp. installation procedures and such.''\n\nXvidcap: :''On UNIX machines I have searched for a comparable tool for a long time with little luck. Some day, I came across a program written by Rasca Gmelch which went a good way, just not quite there. It was able to capture to individual frames and save them in indivdual screenshots (which can be converted into a video with tools like transcode.)''\n\nXvidcap: :''This approach for me required more storage than I had available, so I added an on-line encoding facility using FFMPEG's libavcodec/libavformat. And since Rasca no longer has the time to maintain his code, I took over and the code to sourceforge.''\n\nXvidcap: :''Today, I suppose xvidcap does its basic job, though I find bugs and possible improvements every day. If you are a developer, appreciate a tool like xvidcap, and want to help improve it, contact me at the sourceforge site.\"''\n\nZsh: :''To activate the menu, press tab twice.''\n\nsystemctl start\n\n3D_Mouse: On a systemd-only system the following service script can be used to start the daemon with {{ic|sudo systemctl start spacenavd.service}}\n\nAcer_Travelmate_4750: systemctl start acpid\n\nAltera_Design_Software: # systemctl start systemd-networkd.service\n\nAMD_Catalyst: # systemctl start catalyst-hook\n\nASUS_Zenbook_Prime_UX31A: # systemctl start asus-kbd-backlight.service\n\nAutofs: {{Style|\"New\" compared to what?
