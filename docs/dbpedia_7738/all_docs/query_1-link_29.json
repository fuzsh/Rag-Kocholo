        "text": "This Partner Solution was created by Amazon Web Services (AWS). Partner Solutions are automated reference deployments that help people deploy popular technologies on AWS according to AWS best practices. If you’re unfamiliar with AWS Partner Solutions, refer to the AWS Partner Solution General Information Guide.\n\nThe Partner Solution provides AWS CloudFormation templates for deploying Suricata on a single Amazon Linux 2 EC2 instance for limited scale deployments or behind a Network Load Balancer in an Auto Scaling group for highly available larger deployments.\n\nThis Partner Solution installs Suricata on an Amazon Linux 2 EC2 instance. The Suricata source code is licensed under version 2 of the GNU General Public License.\n\nThere is no cost to use this Partner Solution, but you will be billed for any AWS services or resources that this Partner Solution deploys. For more information, refer to the AWS Partner Solution General Information Guide.\n\n* The template that deploys this Partner Solution into an existing VPC skips the components marked by asterisks and prompts you for your existing VPC configuration.\n\nThis Partner Solution provides separate templates for these options. It also lets you configure Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) blocks, instance types, and Suricata on Amazon Linux 2 settings.\n\nAfter you deploy a Partner Solution, confirm that your resources and services are updated and configured—including any required patches—to meet your security and other needs. For more information, refer to the Shared Responsibility Model.\n\nTo submit feature ideas and report bugs, use the Issues section of the GitHub repository for this Partner Solution.
