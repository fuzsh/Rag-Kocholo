It has a rich and powerful feature set and runs on most computing platforms including Windows, OS X, Linux, and UNIX. Network professionals, security experts, developers, and educators around the world use it regularly. It is freely available as open source, and is released under the GNU General Public License version 2\n\nThe Suricata Engine is an Open Source Next Generation Intrusion Detection and Prevention Engine. This engine is not intended to just replace or emulate the existing tools in the industry, but will bring new ideas and technologies to the field.\n\nThis tool acts much like a standard Ethernet network sniffer. However, unlike a traditional packet sniffer it doesn’t attempt to capture and decode all traffic but instead is geared toward discovering useful infrastructure and security-related data from the network, often from traffic not sent to or from the host system i.e. general broadcast network traffic. This data can reveal all manner of useful information, ranging from live systems on the network, hostnames, Ipv6 systems, routers and name servers, user names and passwords.\n\ntcpdump is a common computer network debugging tool that runs under the command line. It allows the user to intercept and display TCP/IP and other packets being transmitted or received over a network to which the computer is attached.\n\nWireshark is the worldâ€™s most popular network protocol analyzer.

Sniff-n-Snip is a very useful utility in such scenarios. It sniffs for HTTP packets from the client to server and forwards them to your favorite proxy (Burp, WebScarab, Paros etc).\n\nWireshark is the worldâ€™s most popular network protocol analyzer.
