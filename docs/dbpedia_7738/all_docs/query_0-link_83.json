        "text": "Daemonlogger™ is a packet logger and soft tap developed by Martin Roesch. The libpcap-based program has two runtime modes:\n\nIt sniffs packets and spools them straight to the disk and can daemonize itself for background packet logging. By default the file rolls over when 2 GB of data is logged.\n\nIt sniffs packets and rewrites them to a second interface, essentially acting as a soft tap. It can also do this in daemon mode.\n\nThese two runtime modes are mutually exclusive, if the program is placed in tap mode (using the -I switch) then logging to disk is disabled.\n\nMake SURE you read the included COPYING file so that you understand how this file is licensed by Cisco, even though it's under the GPL v2 there are some clarifications that we have made regarding the licensing of this program.\n\nOfficeCat™ is a command line utility developed by Talos that can be used to process Microsoft Office Documents to determine the presence of potential exploit conditions in the file. OfficeCat is available for Windows and Linux. While this software has been incorporated into Razorback, you can still find the officecat download in the nuggets section.\n\nbProbe is a Snort IDS that is configured to run in packet logger mode. It can be installed on a pc and inserted at a key juncture in a network to monitor and collect network activity data. The data collected is sent to a central \"receiver\" server (not included), which is any software capable of interpreting IDS data such as Snort or its variants.\n\nbProbe uses Snort, Barnyard2, and Pulled_Pork, which are provided pre-configured on a Linux Centos 64-bit cd to save you time and maintenance."
