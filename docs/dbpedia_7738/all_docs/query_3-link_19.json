the changes described in the following sections.\n\nIssues/Bugs Addressed\n\nThe following issues were addressed in the Update:\n\nGPL-AGPL-LGPL License Cleanup\n\nThere are three issues we are addressing as part of this GPL-AGPL-LGPL License data cleanup project:\n\nExample: jquery 6.2.0 (GPL-1.0)\n\nHere GPL-1.0 is the license with the short name associated with the component jquery.\n\n1. Short Name Change\n\nWhen a particular license short name is changed and released as part of an electronic update, the short name is not automatically propagated to the inventory items with that selected license. For example, when we change the short name of license id 343 from \"GPL-1.0” to “GPL-1.0-only” in an electronic update, the existing inventory items names with that selected license will not be updated.\n\n2. Component to License Mapping Change\n\nWhen the component to license mapping is changed, let’s say jquery is mapped with \"Apache-2.0\" in the electronic update, then this new mapping wouldn’t be propagated to existing inventory items. This results in inconsistency between the license mapping, existing inventory items, and future inventory items using the new license mapping.\n\n3. Duplicate entry cleanup\n\nAfter running the cleanup scripts, there are possibility of having duplicate entries for the licenses which had mappings in component table and versions table. In our case, we have mappings for 3 licenses, i.e LGPL-2.1-or-later(License_id=704), AGPL-1.0-only(License_id=1654) and AGPL-3.0-only(License_id=229).\n\nNote: Around 16 GPL-AGPL-LGPL related licenses are updated and workaround has been provided for necessary scenarios.\n\nPlease refer the article on GPL-LGPL-AGPL License Cleanup for detailed information and workarounds: https://community.flexera.com/t5/Code-Insight-Knowledge-Base/Code-Insight-GPL-LGPL-AGPL-License-Data-Cleanup-Project/ta-p/240679\n\nEnhanced License Detection Capability for Components\n\nLicense detection capability and license evidence mechanism for GPL-LGPL-AGPL related licenses (part of GPL-AGPL-LGPL license cleanup activity) was updated/added for the following

While most licenses declared by open-source developers fall into the MIT License, the MIT-Style License is more of a template license consisting of various ways of how MIT license can be declared.\n\nWe noticed that the license mapping to majority of components are mapped incorrectly to the MIT-Style License. This is being resolved via an electronic update where the mappings are corrected and for existing projects that need mappings change a script will be provided.\n\nNote:\n\nPlease refer the article on MIT License Cleanup for detailed information and workarounds: https://community.flexera.com/t5/Code-Insight-Knowledge-Base/Code-Insight-MIT-License-Data-Cleanup-Project/ta-p/214451/jump-to/first-unread-message\n\nKnown issue:\n\nA script \"MIT-CleanupQueries.sql\" is provided which has to be run after the PDL update.\n\nThis script updates the license names and the incorrect license mappings in the existing system-generated inventories with the updated data changes as mentioned above.\n\nThere is a known issue for a particular set of inventories which have comma separated license names. This is observed in the inventories generated by AutoWriteup.\n\nEx: jQuery (MIT, MIT License)\n\nIn this case, the script provided to update the existing inventory names would not work. This causes a duplicate inventory on rescan.\n\nThe detailed issue description and workaround are provided in the jira: https://jira.flexera.com/browse/SCA-40194\n\nAddition of Missing Vulnerability Mappings\n\nMissing vulnerability mappings for the following components were added:\n\nItop\n\nMupdf\n\nAnchrome\n\nAddition of License Detection Capability and License Evidence Mechanism\n\nLicense detection capability and license evidence mechanism was added for the following licenses:\n\nCNRI-Jython\n\nCNRI-Python\n\nCNRI-Python-GPL-Compatible\n\nCrossword\n\nCrystalStacker\n\nPSF-2.0\n\nPython-2.0\n\nChanges in Update Released on 13-Jan-2022\n\nThis Update includes the changes described in the following sections.\n\nIssues/Bugs Addressed\n\nThe following issues were addressed in the Update:\n\nUpdates to log4j Component\n\nAdded component detection capabilities to identify log4j components in \"ivy.xml\".\n\nIssue ID Issue Summary SCA-39360 Fixed the license evidence mechanism to eliminate false positive findings.
