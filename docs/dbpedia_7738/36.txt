This tool acts much like a standard Ethernet network sniffer. However, unlike a traditional packet sniffer it doesn’t attempt to capture and decode all traffic but instead is geared toward discovering useful infrastructure and security-related data from the network, often from traffic not sent to or from the host system i.e. general broadcast network traffic. This data can reveal all manner of useful information, ranging from live systems on the network, hostnames, Ipv6 systems, routers and name servers, user names and passwords.

During Penetration testing it can be seen that thick-clients sometimes communicate with a server whose IP address is hardcoded in to it.The HTTP communication between such client and server is harder to intercept and test. Sniff-n-Snip is a very useful utility in such scenarios. It sniffs for HTTP packets from the client to server and forwards them to your favorite proxy (Burp, WebScarab, Paros etc).
