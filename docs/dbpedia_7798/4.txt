Celia Cruz wasn’t the only Afro-Cubana to become a star in Cuba, and then bring her talent to the United States, and beyond. La Lupe, who is known as The Queen of Latin Soul, is also a superstar who we should all know about. She is remembered for her emotive, energy-laden performances, and her great, powerful voice.

Born in Santiago de Cuba in 1939, Guadalupe Victoria Yoli Raymond was supposed to be a teacher (and studied for that profession). But she had other plans. After escaping from school to compete in a singing competition, which she won, her family moved to Havana, where her epic and iconic career began.

La Lupe’s career would see her release over 20 albums (over 10 in five years!), perform in different parts of the world, shock and amaze television viewers with her performances, and earn her spot as Latinx music royalty. In an effort to give her the shine she truly deserves, we are going to fill you in on 15 interesting facts about La Lupe. After you read this, you should go and listen to some of her legendary music!

We mentioned this earlier, but La Lupe was born and raised in Cuba. Born in Santiago de Cuba, her family moved to Havana. This is where her career started, and where she first became a star. She was part of the group Los Tropicuba, with her then-husband and another female singer, and later performed on her own at the Havana nightclub La Red. It was in Cuba that La Lupe recorded and released her very first album, in 1960, entitled Con el diablo en el cuerpo. She was later exiled to Mexico in 1962.

She Was Known for Her High-Energy Performances

Other than her voice, what La Lupe, who was also known as “La Yiyiyi,” was best known for her emotional, frenetic live performances. She would flail her arms in the air, kick, scratch her face, and pull her hair. She told The New York Times in 1973, she “gets involved.” This is what helped set La Lupe apart, and showed that she really felt the music, and the emotion of the lyrics she was singing. And she made everyone else around her see that visibly and feel the feelings with her. She was raw, and she was real — exactly what you want a singer to be.

She Studied to Be a Teacher Before Singing Professionally

Just like fellow Cubana Celia Cruz, who La Lupe knew, Lupe was supposed to be a teacher. It was the profession her parents had wanted her to pursue and a safe and respected career choice for women. La Lupe followed her parent’s advice and received her degree in teaching from the University of Havana, in Cuba. As we all know, that career path didn’t last long, however, as her true calling singing music was waiting in the wings.

She Became a Star in Havana

Before leaving Cuba for good, La Lupe became a star on the island. She recorded her first album there and gained fans like Tennessee Williams, Ernest Hemingway, Jean-Paul Sartre, and Marlon Brando, who went to La Red nightclub in Havana and watched her perform. La Lupe caused such a stir with her over-the-top performances, that she managed to piss off Fidel Castro, who didn’t accept her bold ways and was threatened by the attention she was getting. He took it upon himself to take away her nightclub, her car, and her money, as punishment. However, La Lupe ended up leaving Cuba and became a big star in New York.

La Lupe influenced many people and left a lasting mark in many who have heard her music and seen her perform. One such person is the actress Luna Lauren Velez. In what she calls her “passion project,” Velez played La Lupe in the biopic They Call Me La Lupe. On the Kickstarter page to raise money for the production of the film, Luna said: “I’ve always felt a deep connection with the person, known as ‘La Lupe.’ The first time I heard her sing and she sang one of her most famous songs, “Que Te Pedi,” it went straight into my soul. The sound of her voice was unlike anything I had ever heard. The passion, pain, the raw quality of it mesmerized me. Even her laugh was unique — a laugh I never heard before or since — and yet I felt like I always understood her. Even as a young girl I identified with her…”
