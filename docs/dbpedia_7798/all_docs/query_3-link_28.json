        "text": "On stage, the Cuban singer La Lupe appeared to be possessed: she tore at her hair, flung herself at walls, collapsed onto the floor, threw clothing and jewelry into the crowd, and beat her stiletto heels on the head of her piano player so often that he started wearing a helmet.\n\nHer fans called her La Yiyiyi, for her volcanic yelps and cries. One of her hit records was ''La Lupe Con el Diablo en el Cuerpo'' (''La Lupe With the Devil in Her Body''). Another was ''Puro Teatro'' (''Pure Theater''). Her sexuality and emotional directness made her more demure contemporaries, like Peggy Lee and Celia Cruz, look like debutantes at a tea dance.\n\nLa Lupe came to New York from Cuba in the early years of Castro's government. In America, throughout the 60's and 70's, she sang with the band leaders Tito Puente and Mongo Santamaria, had hit records and gained an international following. But in 1992, dogged by a string of bad record deals, waning popularity and personal misfortunes, La Lupe died at 53, broke and forgotten, in the South Bronx. Toward the end, she had found God and transformed herself into a gospel singer.\n\nIt has taken 10 years for La Lupe to be honored by her adopted city. But last Wednesday, several hundred fans, many from the city's Puerto Rican, Dominican and Cuban neighborhoods, gathered right below the window of La Lupe's old apartment, on 140th Street and St. Ann's Avenue, across from a hilly churchyard and a grassy lot of rusting cars, for the renaming of this stretch of road as La Lupe Way.\n\nThe noonday sun beat down, and there was no shade, but the crowd didn't seem to mind. Politicians, including Fernando Ferrer, the former borough president, and Adolfo Carrión Jr., the current borough president, along with Latin music stars and members of La Lupe's family, gathered on a makeshift green-and-white Parks Department stage.\n\nA choir made up of Bronx middle school students, in red and white uniforms, sang the national anthem, sweetly off key.\n\nLa India, a Puerto Rican singer singer from the Bronx, belted out La Lupe's ''Que Te Pedí.'' An old woman wearing a Puerto Rican flag backpack jumped up and down and beat her hand against her heart.\n\nFinally, Mr. Ferrer and Mr. Carrión tugged at the string meant to unwrap the new street sign. The string snapped; the sign was still covered. The politicians looked uncomfortable.\n\nThe crowd began to shout: ''Climb up the post! Climb up the post!'' A minute or two passed. The politicians looked even more uncomfortable. Then a young man in a sleeveless jersey that resembled a Puerto Rican flag shinnied up the lamppost. The crowd roared. He hugged the lamppost, then leaned out and ripped off the sign's wrapping. He shook his shoulders, looked out at the crowd and pumped his fist."
