        "text": "Ozomatli\n\nOzomatli\n\nAlmo (www.almosounds.com)\n\nCombining disparate elements in a fashion that reveals an unexpected, mutual enrichment is a time-honored formula for music that is at least interesting, sometimes innovative, and often ear-poppingly enjoyable. From its roots in reggae toasting, through its mid-eighties conjunction with funk and soul, to its contemporary dalliances with pop sampling and dumbed-down rhythmic brutality, the rap vocal style has prospered or stagnated artistically to the extent that it has been able to exploit such stylistic reciprocity. On their debut recording, the ten-piece Los Angeles based Ozomatli flawlessly integrates the raps of Chali 2na into a lively mix of musical influences, Mexican cumbia, African highlife, flamenco, funk, hip-hop, rumba, tablas, anything within reach and hearing in the broader cultural maelstrom. The result is a characteristically North American version of the crazed diversity of such Brazilian acts as Karnak, a fitting tribute to the Aztec god of the dance for whom the band is named.\n\n\"Como Ves\" starts in a party atmosphere with whistles and rhythmic shouts of \"go, go, go!\", then breaks into a quick, tripping beat featuring tight lively brass, soukous-style electric guitar, and call-response vocals. \"Cumbia de los Muertos\" has the slight percussive hesitation of classic Colombian cumbia, rich harmony vocals accentuated by saxophones, a traditional performance which suddenly accelerates into hyperspace with Cut Chemist's turntable scratch, loopy dub reverb, and a brief, spirited rap by Chali 2na, all carefully coordinated. \"¿Dónde De Fueron?\" initially adheres to the law of Cuban rumba, with calm, complex percussion with tuned claves behind a tight male vocal duet, then segues into a strutting salsa featuring Ozomatli's precision brass section.\n\nThe stylistic mixing pushes into high gear with \"Eva,\" a flamenco guitar and a quick, shuffling beat, part castanets, part hip-hop scratch, driven by bass, enlivened by the brass, supporting rich multi-part male vocals. And just when you think it can't get any better, Ozomatli pitches \"Chango\" at you, quick percussion, lively galloping brass, a lead vocal that seems to wink conspiratorially as a feline chorus chants \"meow, meow,\" slowing into a teasing reggae beat before finally speeding into a demented swirl. Naturally, Ozomatli follows this with the tabla and sitar-like fretless guitar introduction of \"Super Bowl Sundae,\" which evolves into swinging reggae-inflected rock behind a Chali rap. David Hidalgo of Los Lobos joins on accordion and requinto doble on \" Aquí No Será,\" a traditional-style tune featuring sinuous violin and harmony vocals, leading seamlessly into \"Chota,\" with more traditional sounds meandering in and out of another rap by Chali, who seems at home in the low-riding funk context of \"Coming War.\"\n\nThe band's high spirits and musical virtuosity will keep you listening and dancing to the record, rendering the wait for their next recording not only tolerable, but positively enjoyable. - Jim Foley\n\nWayne Gorbea's Salsa Picante\n\nCógele el Gusto\n\nShanachie (www.shanachie.com)\n\nSalsa Picante, a solid nine-piece working dance band, taps the Bronx legacy of such Cuban and Puerto Rican notables as Machito, Noro Morales, Tito Puente, Arsenio Rodríguez, Tito Rodríguez, Ray Barretto, Jerry Gonzalez, Manny Oquendo, Charlie Palmieri and Eddie Palmieri. The band's contemporary arrangements reflect the enduring convergence of jazz, Afro-Cuban rhythms and Latin dance influences in New York. Salsa Picante's sonorous brass bones and tight polyrhythmic sound articulate seamlessly with Frank Otero's consummate vocal lead and Wayne Gorbea's pulsing piano montuno, with no concession to \"salsa romantica,\" the industry's latest denatured global marketing category. By contrast, and as manifest here, traditional salsa's crossover resurgence confirms the vitality of a genre true to its cardinal mission: To power the dance floor through the midnight hour. Short of a club crawl through Brooklyn and the Bronx, where Salsa Picante's most passionate fans reside, this CD will propel the most sedate gathering into the dancing groove. - Michael Stone\n\nHolding Up Half The Sky: Voices Of Latin Women\n\nShanachie (www.shanachie.com)\n\nSince World War Two, the changing status of women worldwide has registered in popular music as in every other sphere of social life. This release is part of a series focusing on female artists from around the globe. Compilations lend themselves to second-guessing: Why this artist and not that one? Adequate coverage of an entire region on a single disc is an impossible task, certainly. Indeed, individual treatment is warranted for each highlighted locale: Colombia, Cuba, the Dominican Republic, Mexico, Peru, Puerto Rico and the United States. Nor is the anthology universally representative - it overlooks Argentina, Chile, Brazil (the largest nation in Latin America) and the non-Spanish-speaking Caribbean (e.g., Haiti, Jamaica, Trinidad). But on its own terms, this is a practical introduction to thirteen female singers of indisputable influence (e.g., Albita, Lola Beltrán, Celia Cruz, La India, La Lupe, Lydia Mendoza, Omara Portuondo, María Teresa Vera) and a variety of traditional and popular genres (Afro-Peruvian, bolero, bomba, cumbia, guajira, merengue, ranchera, salsa, son, Tex-Mex and vallenato). The superb choice of tracks is strictly uptempo, with informative bios for each artist (but a discography would aid those wishing to hear more). In any case, the new listener could do worse than begin with this primer on women's manifest contributions to Latin American and Caribbean music. - Michael Stone\n\nJohnny Polanco y su Conjunto Amistad\n\nL.A. Amistad\n\nTonga\n\nSomeone asked me, \"Is it from Amistad?\" To set things straight, L.A. Amistad has nothing to do with the movie. L.A. Amistad is the new album from one of the flagship dance bands of the growing Los Angeles salsa movement. Johnny Polanco's group Amistad is a regular feature at El Flordita, a Cuban restaurant and salsa nightclub on Vine Sreet in Hollywood, California, playing there every Monday night since 1993. He has also been featured at many venues along the West Pacific coast.\n\nHis first album on Tonga is a business card, produced to establish name recognition and, perhaps land some big label contract. But unlike any basement demo tape, Polanco's group puts out a well-crafted salsa album that aims far beyond the novelty market. Here are original compositions by Ray Ramos, Jesus Perez, as well Polanco himself. Flashy arrangements are highlighted with funky brass and Afro-centric rhythms. It's contemporary music that clings to the Latin roots, but not buried in tradition. Most distinctive are the bantering solos of Karen Brigg's violin and Artie Webb's flute, especially on \"Que Lio\" and \"Karina.\" Polanco provides the finishing touches as arranger and producer, assembling a product that's full of energized syncopation. For those who want their salsa music more on the kitsch side, look elsewhere. This is the real stuff, no matter that it comes from California. - Wayne Whitwam\n\nGustavo Santaolalla\n\nRonroco\n\n(Soluna/Island/Europe; Nonesuch/US)\n\nGustavo Santaolalla is best known as the producer of such raucous Rock en Espanol groups as Cafe Tacuba, Caifanes and Maldita Vecindad, but on Ronroco he veers in a different direction. Here he explores the quiet, shimmering sounds of Andean instruments such as the charango, panpipes and the ronroco. The result is unique, a quiet album of lightly plucked strings elegantly interwoven -- think of the delicate sounds of harps and mandolins and you're on your way to understanding what is going on here.\n\nA ronroco is a large charango, itself a ukelele-like instrument originally made of an armadillo shell. Though it is a traditional instrument, Santaolalla takes a non-traditioinal approach to the music on the album, creating spare, elegant tunes that are neither new-age spacey nor rustic.\n\nAn Argentine native now based in Los Angeles, Santaolalla has created an album that has the delicacy of chamber music, the open-heartedness of traditional music, and the sophistication of contemporary music. Here's hoping it finds its audience. --Marty Lipp\n\nLos Pleneros de la 21/ El Quinteto Criollo\n\nPuerto Rico Tropical\n\nMusic of the World/ Latitudes CD LAT 50608 (www.musicoftheworld.com)\n\nThroughout Latin America, the region's diverse folk music traditions have given way to such popular and increasingly international idioms as salsa, merengue and hip-hop, and Puerto Rico is certainly no exception. Yet island performers have also found inspiration in the daunting musical legacy of nearby Cuba in forging several uniquely Puerto Rican styles, most notably the percussive, African-derived bomba and plena, and the country or jíbaro genres known as seis and aguinaldo. This recording is a rare recorded introduction to these cardinal Puerto Rican folk traditions.\n\nLos Pleneros de la 21, formed in a San Juan neighborhood in 1983, carried the bomba and plena to New York. There these forms (and the competitive dance tradition associated with them) have undergone a renaissance as signifiers of Puerto Rican cultural identity. Indeed, these energetic and picaresque styles - sprung from the African experience in the sugar plantations and refineries of coastal Puerto Rico - have inspired a new generation of enthusiastic street-corner ensembles that today can be heard in virtually every nuyorqueño neighborhood.\n\nJíbaro music shows more pronounced Spanish influences, characterized by a solo vocal line based on the décima lyric structure, and accompanied by guitar, cuatro, and sundry hand percussion. The urbanizing, emigrating population of postwar Puerto Rico largely dismissed the seis and aguinaldo as unsophisticated and overly sentimental \"hick\" music. But El Quinteto Criollo, founded in the early 1950s by standout Puerto Rican guitarist Israel Berrios, has played a key role in reviving this music on the island and in New York alike, where jíbaro tunes (alongside the more popular international forms that once threatened to displace the seis and aguinaldo) are now obligatory markers of Puerto Rican heritage at weddings, baptisms, and holiday celebrations. - Michael Stone"
