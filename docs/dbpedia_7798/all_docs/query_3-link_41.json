        "text": "It began as a dream for Tito Puente.\n\nWhen Tito was alive, he and I would talk about using museums or building a cultural institute to let the world know about our rich Hispanic musical culture, especially the music that became known as salsa.\n\nWell, a big part of that dream has come true via the Tito Puente Legacy Project Phase One, which will be showcased in the Hostos Library at Hostos Community College in the Bronx (475 Grand Concourse). Eventually, all of Puente's works will be housed in the building that the college has purchased; part of it will be known as the Tito Puente Museum.\n\nThis is the first time a school of higher learning in New York, and possibly in the U.S., will permanently house the complete works of a musician. And Tito is the first Puerto Rican musician in the U.S. to have an exhibit of this type.\n\nHere's another tidbit about Tito: On Sept. 10, he will become the first Puerto Rican musician in the history of the U.S. Postal Service to have a post office named after him. It will be at 124th Street in Spanish Harlem between Lexington and Third avenues. And on Thursday, I will be traveling to Berlin's Haus Der Kulturen Der Welt (House of World Cultures) to give a lecture on Tito and the history of Latin music and its influences from the early 1950s to the present in New York, as part of an exhibition called \"New York — States of Mind\" (through Nov. 4).\n\nYOU MIGHT WONDER why the Tito Puente exhibit at the Hostos Library is so important. Today's young people have little sense of history when it comes to music. The radio doesn't play the music of our heroes or the pioneers of the music in general. Little or no history of Latin music or Latin jazz is taught in our schools or colleges.\n\nWhen it comes to Latin music, you ask young people who were Tito Puente, Machito, Tito Rodriguez, Celia Cruz, La Lupe, etc., and they don't know. They know J.Lo or Marc Anthony — and by the way, Marc is the only Latin artist who gives credit or thanks to his heroes on award shows and he especially thanks Tito Puente, who gave him his start.\n\nWhen the so-called superstars of today thank the stars of yesteryear, it educates the youth of today by making them curious about those stars. And much of what is being taught is based on distorted facts that have been published in books. A perfect example is a book that was just written on Puente, in which I uncovered more than 90 mistakes, and I'm still counting. In many lectures that I've given, there will always be someone to challenge or tell me that a certain book said this about Tito or Machito, and I would tell them it is not true. That is why this exhibit will be so important.\n\nFROM THE STREETS OF SPANISH HARLEM to numerous music halls of fame, his career made possible the careers of so many others. His life story of the American dream of success was brought on by hard work and determination. He is a true legend, teacher, genius. We should teach our children to live their lives in honor of his life and the lives of other heroes of the past, because we have few heroes today.\n\nIn this exhibit, you will get to see pictures of Tito in the Boy Scouts, never-before-seen pictures in World War II, pictures of him performing at the world-famous Palladium Ballroom, fliers of certain venues that he played at, posters, 78-rpm records, eight-tracks, 10-inch LPs, his star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame and rare live performances shown on a monitor, plus many other things never before seen in public.\n\nThe Tito Puente Legacy exhibit is open to the public, beginning Sept. 14. So visit the Bronx and learn about one of the greatest — if not the greatest — Latin musicians of the 20th century."
