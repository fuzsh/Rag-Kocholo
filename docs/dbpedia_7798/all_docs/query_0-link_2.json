        "text": "She was such an amazing performer and talent. Its very sad to me how she faded into obscurity. When Fania bought the record label she and Celia Cruz were with, Tito records, they decided to concentrate on Celia because she was less controversial. La Lube had a history of torrid love affairs, drug abuse(some say untrue), and mental illness(bi-polar disorder). She was banned from performing on Puerto Rican T.V. after she took her clothes off during an award show on National Television. She retired in the 80's destitute and homeless.\n\nI absolutely love watching her on stage. She was so passionate, she so deeply loved and felt the music, you can see it move through her body. She would take her shoes off, items of clothing, even jewelry. And what a voice she had! She was a great talent that should never be forgotten.\n\nLa Yi Yi Yi!! What a power house of raw talent sensuality and passion.\n\nDidn't she become very religious at the end?\n\nTotally...Born-again...She had a terrible accident and claimed that an evangelist healed her. She left Santeria for the Evangelical church.\n\nShe was amazing..\n\nPicasso said she was a musical genius.. some great compliment!\n\nShe had a great following, which included Ernest Hemingway, Tennessee Williams, Jean Paul Satre, Simone de Beauvoir and Marlon Brando.\n\nfunny you mention the religious thing, cause when I saw the first clip, my impression was \"It is that she seems like a very fiery female Pentecostal worship leader, or that fiery female worship leaders are copying her?\"\n\nKnowing sloppy, porous Caribbean culture, its probably both.\n\nShe was deeply involved with Santeria until the end of her life.\n\nBut maybe it is similar in that she seems to become possessed by the music\n\nShe was just very passionate and expressive...starting out a song calmly and when the rhythm kicks up so does she! Off comes the clothes and shoes! sometimes a ring or two\n\nGroove make you know..Didnt she have an affair and child with Tito Puente?\n\nI don't think so - the book Mambo Diablo mentions her a bit, with no reference to this, although they do say that TP was able to get her to focus in the studio.\n\nApparently she was a nightmare to work with (possibly due to mental health issues), so record labels eventually chose more professional female singers - I imagine they assumed that there was only a limited demand for female singers so she was dispensable. More info here:\n\nhttp://www.salsaforums.com/threads/put-your-palladium-ballroom-stories-here.19906/page-3\n\nIncidentally this is a great album (although La Lupe is not on every single track):\n\nI don't think so - the book Mambo Diablo mentions her a bit, with no reference to this, although they do say that TP was able to get her to focus in the studio.\n\nApparently she was a nightmare to work with (possibly due to mental health issues), so record labels eventually chose more professional female singers - I imagine they assumed that there was only a limited demand for female singers so she was dispensable. More info here:\n\nhttp://www.salsaforums.com/threads/put-your-palladium-ballroom-stories-here.19906/page-3\n\nIncidentally this is a great album (although La Lupe is not on every single track):\n\nI remember hearing that they had a child and it died. She had a lot of hot affairs apparently. I will try to find something on it if possible.\n\nGroove make you know..Didnt she have an affair and child with Tito Puente?\n\nThat I don't know about... I do recall someone telling me how she was with Mongo Santamaria and that love affair did not end well for her and she wrote a song about the breakup, but I can't recall which song it was.\n\nLa Lupe was very talented, in my opinion one of the best voices but her career and her life had a very sad ending... both Celia Cruz and La Lupe had privileged voices, and also at the beginig of their careers in cuba Celia had more luck, Celia was a singer for La Sonora Matancera and had international fame in the 1950s... when both left Cuba in the 1960s La Lupe had a great start in NYC but like we all know alcoholism and drugs ended the life of this great artist\n\nbest regards all\n\nThat I don't know about... I do recall someone telling me how she was with Mongo Santamaria and that love affair did not end well for her and she wrote a song about the breakup, but I can't recall which song it was.\n\nYou know how drug dealers have rule number 1: \"never get high on your own supply\" ?\n\nMongo, from what you describe, ran afoul of producers' rule #1: \"Don't try to **** the artist.\"\n\nLooking at both rules a bit philosophically, they're not terribly different.\n\nLa Lupe was indeed a very talented and unique artist. A few incorrect statements here - no child with Tito Puente, no drugs, abandoned Santeria later in life - there has been a lot written about her so it's not hard to find out. PBS Independent Lens had an excellent documentary about her, with some amazing footage. You'll enjoy watching it:\n\nLa Lupe.Queen Of Latin Soul. Documental 2007:\n\nLa Lupe was indeed a very talented and unique artist.
