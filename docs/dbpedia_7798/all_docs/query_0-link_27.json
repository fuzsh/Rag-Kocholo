        "text": "was born Úrsula Hilaria Celia de la Caridad Cruz Alfonso on in the working-class, racially diverse neighborhood of Santos Suárez in Havana, Cuba. Her father, Simón Cruz, worked shoveling coal on the railroads, and her mother, Catalina Alfonso, was a homemaker. Cruz was the second of four surviving children, and she grew up among an extended family of aunts and cousins. She began singing at a very young age, entertaining family and friends, and was drawn to Afro-Cuban popular music when her maternal aunt brought her to watch and dance in comparsas, neighborhood-based groups that paraded and danced in Havana’s annual Carnival competition, accompanied by African-derived percussion. Cruz’s father was opposed to her entering the entertainment field and encouraged Cruz to pursue teaching, which he felt was a more respectable profession that did not carry the connotations of prostitution attached to female performers at the time.\n\nIn Cruz enrolled in the Escuela Normal de Maestros (Teachers’ College) in Havana, but she also began to enter amateur singing contests on local radio stations, where she won recognition from both listeners and professional musicians. After graduating in , Cruz enrolled in Havana’s National Conservatory of Music, where she took classes until . She did not graduate from the conservatory, however, because she soon joined La Sonora Matancera and her professional career took off.\n\nCruz began her professional career in the late 1940s as a singer for the local radio station CMQ, subsequently working for Mil Diez and other commercial stations in Havana. She credited her experiences on the radio with helping her develop a sense of professionalism, noting that because the performances were live, one had to be prepared for anything and be able to improvise in order to cover a mistake. In Cruz expanded her venues of performance to the theater and cabarets when she met the famed choreographer Roderico Neyra, known as “Rodney,” and was cast as the lead singer in an all-female song and dance group called Las Mulatas de Fuego (The Fiery Mulatas). As the name suggests, the scantily clad dancers performed sexualized routines, thus playing into the widely held stereotypes of exoticized female blackness that were pervasive at the time. Nonetheless, the group offered Cruz her first opportunity to tour abroad, in Mexico and Venezuela. In she appeared at the famed Tropicana nightclub in Rodney’s Afro-Cuban musical revue called Sun Sun Ba Baé celebrating the Afro-Cuban religion known as Santería, in which she sang in Lucumí, a Yoruba-derived language.\n\nCruz’s first commercial recordings in Cuba—made in —were songs dedicated to the Orishas (Yoruba-derived deities) Changó and Babalú-Ayé. They incorporated choral refrains in Lucumí and the double-headed batá drums used in Santería ceremonies. Nonetheless, as Cruz often asserted, although many people assumed she practiced Santería—because of the subject material of her recordings and the fact that she was black—she never considered herself to be a devotee of this or any other Afro-Cuban religion; like most Cubans at the time, she was raised Catholic. She recounted that, as a child, she found the Santería rituals performed by neighbors frightening, although she was drawn to the music. In sum, she viewed and performed Afro-Cuban sacred music as “folklore”—significant for its contributions to national culture and influences on popular music—and not as an expression of her own religious beliefs.\n\nThe woman who would later come to be known as the “queen of salsa” gained national prominence in , when she joined the dance band La Sonora Matancera. The group, which was founded in in Matanzas, a small city on Cuba’s northwestern coast, moved to Havana during the 1930s and subsequently became one of the most popular bands on the island. Like all dance bands of the time, their repertoire was varied, including son (traditional dance music), bolero (ballad-style song), and the most popular Cuban genres of the mid-twentieth century, mambo and cha-cha. La Sonora Matancera was also known for working with many different singers, including non-Cubans such as the Puerto Rican–born Daniel Santos, the group’s star singer before Cruz joined the band. In fact, Cruz was hired as a replacement for a Puerto Rican female singer, Myrta Silva, when Silva decided to return to her native island. Cruz was soon recording major hits with the band, including “Cao cao maní picao,” “Mata Siguaraya,” and “Changó ta’ vení,” and she subsequently became known as the “Guarachera de Cuba.” She and La Sonora Matancera toured internationally to Haiti, Colombia, the United States, and other sites in the Americas. Her success as a female star of a dance band was rather rare, as suggested by the fact that the owner of the Seeco label, with which La Sonora Matancera was recording at the time, originally did not believe that female singers were marketable. As the Cuban music scholar Ned Sublette (2004) states, “to see a girl singing kinetic, rhythmic music in front of a band was unusual in Cuba” (pp. 575–576). Cruz’s time with La Sonora Matancera was also significant in terms of her personal life: the man she would eventually marry, Pedro Knight, had been playing trumpet with the band since . Although they met in , they did not marry until , after defecting to the United States.\n\nIn , shortly after the triumph of the Cuban Revolution, Cruz and La Sonora Matancera traveled to Mexico for a tour and decided not to return to Cuba. While in Mexico, Cruz appeared in several films and television programs, and recorded with various Mexican orchestras. The band moved to the United States the following year, and Cruz stayed on as their principal singer until . As part of the nascent Cuban exile community, she came to be considered one of most outspoken critics of the Castro regime in the United States, an ironic twist given the overwhelmingly white composition and generally racist mentality of the early waves of Cuban migrants. On the island, Cruz’s songs were subjected to absolute censorship, banned from radio and all public media circulation. However, tapes of her music continued to circulate clandestinely, and despite her political orientation, she was held in high esteem by Cubans of all ages, who claimed her as their own. In addition to the ban on her music on state-controlled media outlets (which was not lifted until , years after her death), Cruz asserted that the Revolutionary government punished her family in various ways as retribution for her defection, such as impeding her brother’s success as a musician and not allowing Cruz to return to Cuba for her mother’s funeral in .\n\nCruz was one of the earliest popular musicians to extol the virtues of Santería and Afro-Cuban religion more generally. During her early career in the United States, she recorded several albums dedicated to the Orishas (also known in Cuba as santos, or “saints”), including Homenaje a Los Santos (Homage to the Saints, ), Homenaje a Los Santos, Volume 2 ( ), and Homenaje a Yemayá ( ). Cruz has, perhaps more than any other Cuban artist of the twentieth century, consistently paid homage to Santería in popular song. Thus, despite the fact that her politics were regarded as reactionary (because of her well-known opposition to the socialist Cuban Revolution), Cruz contributed in significant ways to the valorization of Afro-Cuban culture.\n\nUltimately, Cruz is remembered more for her role in the popularization of New York–based salsa than for her anti-Castro political beliefs. In she joined Tito Puente’s band, recording numerous albums with him until . However, as had been the case with La Sonora Matancera, she also continued to record as a solo artist and with other orchestras during this period, particularly in Mexico. Some of her most enduring hits were recorded in the 1960s, including “Bemba Colorá” ( ) and her version of the Cuban traditional song “Guantanamera.”\n\nThe year marked the beginning of Cruz’s long and fruitful association with Fania Records, the label formed in by the Dominican-born Johnny Pacheco and the Italian American Jerry Masucci that was inextricably tied to the birth and popularization of salsa. While a Fania artist, she collaborated with the leading pioneers of salsa—including the New York Puerto Ricans Willie Colón and Ray Barreto—and recorded major hits, such as “Quimbara” ( ) and “Usted abusó” ( ). The “Fania All-Stars”—which included the most successful salsa stars on the label, such as Cruz and the celebrated salsa singers Hector Lavoe and Rubén Blades—traveled all around the world in the 1970s, including Europe, Japan and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (then called Zaire). Notably, Cruz was the only woman in the group, in part due to the gendered associations of salsa in its early decades—the African-derived improvised singing that characterizes the genre and its antecedent, the Cuban son, was thought to be the exclusive purview of male singers.\n\nBy Cruz was recognized as “the queen of salsa” and held a unique place as salsa’s only female ambassador. Furthermore, as Christina Abreu (2007) asserts, Cruz distinguished herself from the male Fania stars in terms of the subject material of her songs: while many 1970s salsa songs concerned the daily struggles of life in the barrio, or issued social critiques of institutional racism, poverty, and US imperialism in Latin America, Cruz avoided overt political statements in order to appeal to a more mainstream audience. In addition, her strong anti-Communist sentiments likely put her at odds with her leftist-leaning peers who openly supported the Castro government, such as Rubén Blades.\n\nCruz is remembered by many for her professionalism and seriousness in rehearsals, shows, and recording sessions. She often mentioned her deep dedication to her fans, attributing most of the credit for her success to them, and feeling that they deserved the best performances and records she could possibly offer. Thus, although her musicality and technical ability were key factors in her popularity, she also took great pains with the visual aspect of her performances, employing elaborate makeup and unique, flamboyant costumes and shoes. Her strong sense of professionalism was linked to her well-known aversion to drinking, marijuana, and hard drugs. In contrast to her antidrug stance, many of her male counterparts in the salsa world—such as Hector Lavoe—struggled with or eventually succumbed to addiction.\n\nCruz continued an impressive rate of productivity during the 1980s, although the popularity of Fania-style salsa dura (“hard” salsa, which features a more rhythmic, driving sound) waned during this decade, giving way to salsa romántica (a “softer” style featuring love-themed lyrics) and other Latin genres such as merengue. In she switched labels, going to RMM, the recording company founded by the Latino entrepreneur Ralph Mercado, considered to be the most important promoter of Latin music during the 1980s and 1990s. Mercado began his music industry career in the 1970s managing some of salsa’s biggest stars—including Cruz and Tito Puente—and in later decades he played a huge role in developing salsa’s new generation of talent, including the New York Puerto Ricans La India and Marc Anthony.\n\nScholars have often viewed Cruz’s lyrics and commanding stage performance as empowering for women, especially because there were so few female salsa performers during the 1960s and 1970s. An even stronger testament to her musical virtuosity and charisma is that she maintained her popularity without playing on her sexuality. Although songs like “Usted abusó”—in which Cruz chronicles the emotional abuse she suffers at the hands of a (male) lover—do not display an explicitly feminist agenda, they arguably paved the way for more aggressive stances against patriarchy, such as La India’s “Ese Hombre.” In fact, Cruz championed and mentored younger Latin female singers, such as La India and Gloria Estefan.\n\nOne of the most significant facets of Cruz’s legacy was her ability to remain musically relevant throughout five decades. She recorded several major hits in the last years of her life—including “La vida es un carnaval” and the techno-flavored “La negra tiene tumbao”—and was performing and recording up until the last few months of her life. On , Cruz died in Fort Lee, New Jersey, from brain cancer, and was survived by her longtime husband, Pedro Knight. Honoring her request, two funerals were held—one in New York, and the other in Miami. Each one drew more than 100,000 fans, musicians, and dignitaries. In addition, Union City, New Jersey, dedicated a park—named Celia Cruz Plaza—to the singer in . In Cuba, although the state-controlled press made almost no mention of her death (she was still a blacklisted artist at the time), numerous informal wakes were held for Cruz.\n\nCelia Cruz has been the subject of several biographies in English and Spanish and many academic articles and book chapters. In addition to her autobiography, coauthored by the Mexican journalist Ana Cristina Reymundo, Cruz published several children’s books. She earned countless accolades and awards, including five Grammy awards, the National Medal of Arts (presented to her by President Bill Clinton), and honorary doctorates from three universities: Yale University in , Florida International University in , and the University of Miami in ."
