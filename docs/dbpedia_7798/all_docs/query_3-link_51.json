With eight Grammys, 189 albums, and a career that spanned five decades, he was known for bringing Latin music to new audiences and as the composer of such hits as ”Oye Como Va’ and “Ran Kan Kan.” With an influence on the entire music field, he helped to promote the careers of many artists, including singers Celia Cruz and La Lupe.
