The infrastructure was fundamental to the success of the network â which currently has more than 2,000 Smart S+ UCO Containers installed in more than 100 municipalities in mainland Portugal.\n\nThis equipment is installed on the streets of the various municipalities, in commercial retail surfaces, gas stations, among several other locations.\n\nThe Smart S+ UCO Containers designed by Hardlevel are equipped with IoT â Internet of Things technology; on the one hand, a sensor system that allows you to know the filling status of the equipment in real time, on the other hand, interacting through an App (RENOÂ®) with the citizen, thus allowing him to count his deposits of Used Cooking Oil and qualify for prizes during the campaigns and sweepstakes that are carried out in partnership between Hardlevel and its partners.\n\nThis is the future, known as PAYT â Pay as you Throw â that is, pay effectively for the waste you produce. Join us on this mission to achieve Carbon Neutrality!"
