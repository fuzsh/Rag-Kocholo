Shared egg donation: comparison of pregnancy rates in fresh or thawn embryo transfers between donors and recipients\n\nVinicius Alves de Oliveira1, Rodopiano de Souza Florencio1, Waldermar Naves do Amaral2\n\n1 Humana Medicina Reprodutiva - Goiânia - GO - Brasil.\n\n2 Grupo Fértile - Goiânia - GO - Brasil.\n\nObjective: Determine the chances of clinical pregnancy and live births in donors and recipients in the first fresh or thawed embryo transfer.\n\nMethods: Retrospective, cross-sectional study where 211 egg donation cycles and 211 egg reception cycles were studied, from January 2016 to December 2020, at the Humana Medicina Reprodutiva Clinic, in Goiânia - GO. The study investigated pregnancy-related rates in donors and recipients, as well as evaluating pregnancy rates in fresh and thawed embryo transfers. Variables that could interfere with the chance of pregnancy in both donors and recipients were also evaluated.\n\nResults: Between donors and recipients there was no statistical difference for clinical pregnancy (p=0.7585) and live births (p=0.5786). The index of clinical pregnancy and live births in donors showed no statistical difference (p=0.6701 and p=0.2056) for fresh and thawed transfers. There was also no statistical difference for recipient patients. Among the variables studied that could interfere with the results, only the blastulation index showed a statistical difference in the chance of clinical pregnancy in donors and recipients (tale 1).\n\nConclusion: The studied variables that could interfere in the results showed statistical difference only for the blastulation index in both donors and recipients. The clinical pregnancy rate in the donors was 37.70% and 36.10% in the recipients. There was no difference in the chances of pregnancy between donors and recipients, and there was also no difference in pregnancy rates between fresh and thawed transfers. The results showed no statistical difference in clinical pregnancy and live births when comparing D4 versus D5-D6 transfers.\n\nP-02. Alloimmune abortion and the immunopathological mechanisms through a literature review\n\nManuella Amlid Pimenta de Castro Cavalcanti Silva1, Alexandre Antônio de Lima Júnior1, Fálba Bernadete Ramos dos Anjos1, Adriana Fracasso2, Karollyne Skarlet Gomes da Silva1, Evandro Valentim da Silva1\n\n1Universidade Federal de Pernambuco - Recife - PE - Brasil.\n\n2Faculdade Integrada de Pernambuco - Recife - PE - Brasil.\n\nObjective: Perform a literature review on what alloimmune abortion is and what specific characteristics can cause alloimmune abortion.\n\nMethods: For this review, searches were conducted using Pubmed, Google Scholar, and Scielo, using the keywords: 'alloimmune abortion,' 'in vitro fertilization,' and 'assisted reproduction.' The research criteria included selecting articles in both English and Portuguese, published between the years 2004 and 2022.\n\nResults: Abortion is a public health problem and one of the leading causes of maternal morbidity and mortality (MARIUTTI, 2009). Abortions are considered cases occurring before 20 weeks of gestation, with the fetus measuring less than 16 centimeters and weighing less than 500 grams (MINISTRY OF HEALTH, 2005). There are different types of abortions, such as chemical abortions resulting from abortive medications, and spontaneous abortions resulting from organic disorders that occur in the second or third month of pregnancy (MARIUTTI, 2009). Alloimmune abortion falls under spontaneous abortions, characterized by recurrent cases, involving three or more consecutive spontaneous losses and representing approximately 40% to 60% of spontaneous abortion cases (CAETANO, 2006).\n\nThere is a difference between autoimmune factors and alloimmune factors. Autoimmune factors are correlated with the action of autoantibodies in the presence of the embryo, influenced by autoimmune factors such as anti-thyroglobulin (TGO) and anti-nuclear factor (FAN). On the other hand, alloimmune factors are correlated with maternal rejection due to the presence of paternal genetic material from the embryo, with Natural Killer cells (NK) being involved as alloimmune factors. Alloimmune abortion is a result of blastocyst implantation, leading to a highly complex and specialized immune response involving both the embryo and the endometrium (THIENGO). The blastocyst is covered by the trophoblast, a cellular layer responsible for the formation of the embryonic placenta (MOORE and PERSAUD, 2008). The trophoblast acts as a semi-allograft, as a part of the genetic material comes from the father, which is unknown to the maternal immune system, increasing the chances of rejection. Some of the immune mediators involved are cytokines, and the maternal endometrium expresses cytokines essential for blastocyst implantation. Trophoblastic cells express human leukocyte antigens (HLA), ensuring maternal-fetal immunotolerance by interacting with NK cells. HLA-G plays a vital role in preventing cell lysis induced by NK cells by interacting with inhibitory death receptors (KIRs), preventing NK cell activation (THIENGO). Recent studies have indicated a correlation between Natural Killer cells (NK) and alloimmune abortion (NIEKERK, 2013). Some studies associate a high concentration of NK cells in the endometrium and peripheral blood with a higher risk of recurrent abortion, while other results suggest that patients undergoing in vitro fertilization (IVF) with a history of recurrent abortion should be investigated for the presence of factors associated with loss. IVF could reduce recurrent abortion cases by up to 29% (BILIBIO, 2020).\n\nConclusion: Alloimmune abortion is one of the main causes of spontaneous abortion, but it still requires further study as its causes are not yet fully understood. The most probable cause is the presence of NK cells that cause cell lysis, contributing to the failure of blastocyst implantation. IVF is a method that needs further improvement to ensure better results in blastocyst implantation, as one of the reasons for IVF failure is the maternal immune response's deficiency, affecting processes from blastocyst nidation to placental formation, thus preventing the progression of pregnancy. This indicates that it is essential to study the mechanisms of immune-modulatory tolerance that occur in natural gestation to replicate them in assisted reproduction.\n\nP-03. Influence of maternal age on the blastocysts rate and implantation associated with the number of oocytes\n\nKaren Melissa Goncalves Oliveira1, Aline de Cássia Azevedo1, Manuela Baldave Carli Dias1, Lilian Pagano Mori1, Vitor Armenio Scontre1, Luis Roberto Louzada Balducci1, Edson Guimarães Lo Turco2, Bernardo Rodrigues Lamounier de Moura2\n\n1InVentre Centro Avançado de Medicina Reprodutiva - Santo André - SP - Brasil.\n\n2Embriológica - São Paulo - SP - Brasil.\n\nObjective: Analyze maternal age related to the number of recovered oocytes as a prognosis factor directly associated with the results of in vitro fertilization treatments.\n\nMethods: Was performed observational, retrospective and descriptive study was carried out, in which the medical records of patients who underwent In Vitro Fertilization (IVF) treatment during the period from January 2018 to September 2022 were evaluated, carried out at the InVentre Assisted Reproduction Clinic, located in Santo André in the state of São Paulo. The variables and proportions analyzed were: number of oocytes collected, mature oocytes, fertilization rate, number of blastocysts, number of transfers and implantation rate.\n\nResults: 150 autologous IVF cycles were evaluated. Three groups of different maternal ages were compared: up to 35 years old (67 cycles), 36-39 years old (50 cycles) and 40 years old or more (33 cycles).\n\nNo significant differences were found in the rates of mature oocytes and fertilization between the different groups.\n\nThe average number of oocytes recovered and of embryos that reached the blastocyst stage was significantly lower (p<0.05) in the group of patients aged 40 years or older, when compared to the other two younger groups.\n\nThe implantation rate after embryo transfer (fresh or frozen-thawed cycle) was significantly higher (p<0.05) in the groups of women who underwent treatment before 40 years of age. In the groups of patients up to 35 years old and 36-39 years old, the implantation rate was 68.5% and 52.4%, respectively, while in patients aged 40 years or more, this rate was 36%.\n\nIn addition, the existence of a high relationship between the number of oocytes and blastocysts was observed, so that for each 1 more oocyte produced by each patient, regardless of the group, there was a mean increase of 0.304 blastocysts (95% confidence interval).\n\nFinally, it was observed that for every 1 more blastocyst available for transfer, the probability of implantation increased 1.198 times (95% confidence interval), while for every 1 year of age, this probability decreased 0.909 times (interval of 95% confidence).\n\nConclusion: In conclusion, the number of recovered oocytes, degree of maturation and fertilization rate did not show significant differences between the groups, however, based on the analyzed samples, the rate of embryos that reached the blastocyst stage and resulted in an implantation after embryo transfer was significantly lower in patients aged over 40 years. This idea reinforces that a woman's age is an important indicator of the success rate of assisted reproductive technology.\n\nP-04. Chemically defined 3D matrix for in vitro maturation (IVM) of human oocytes\n\nAdriana Bos-Mikich1, Gabriella Mamede Andrade2, Luis Alberto Loureiro dos Santos1, Nilo Frantz2\n\n1 Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul - Porto Alegre - RS - Brasil.\n\n2 Nilo Frantz Medicina Reprodutiva - Porto Alegre - RS - Brasil.\n\nObjective: We reported earlier the use of a nontoxic PVA-based hydrogel modified with BTCA, for fibroblasts and stem cells culture. The objective of the present study is to test the use of a PVA-based/BTCA gel for the culture of human immature oocytes to improve in vitro conditions that may enhance present oocyte maturation rates. Also, there is the need to find easily manufactured, safe, and economical materials for human IVM, particularly for fertility preservation in cancer patients.\n\nMethods: Immature human oocytes and cumulus cells were obtained with informed consent from patients undergoing conventional IVF cycles after superovulation and hCG priming. Cumulus cells and oocytes were cultured in CSC medium supplemented with 10% SSS in a 10% PVA (Mw 130,000, 99% degree of hydrolysis, Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO) and BTCA (1,2,3,4-butanetetracarboxylic acid, Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO, 99%) matrix for 24hrs. PVA was added to 30 mL deionized water at 100ºC. After dissolution, 0.3g of BTCA was added and stirred for 20 minutes at 60ºC.The solution was placed in polystyrene Petri dishes. Films were obtained by solvent evaporation. Cumulus cells obtained before hyaluronidase exposure were placed in culture onto PVA-BTCA hydrogel for cytotoxicity and cell attachment test. Eleven GV and 4 denuded oocytes and cumulus cells were added to PVA-BTCA culture system for IVM, at 38ºC and 5%CO2\n\nResults: Two replicates of cumulus cells exposure to PVA-BTCA culture system showed that the hydrogel allows for cell survival and adhesion to the substrate, after gentle swirling of the culture dish and change of the medium with the unattached cells, as observed under contrast phase microscopy. Having confirmed the hydrogels supported cell survival, 11 GV and 4 MI oocytes obtained from five different patients were added to the culture system together with cumulus cells isolated from oocytes of the same women. Eight GV and 2 MI oocytes reached MII (73% and 50%, respectively), after 24h culture in the PVA-BTCA /cumulus cells culture system.\n\nConclusion: The PVA/BTCA gel represents a promising new approach to improve IVM culture conditions, particularly for Fertility Preservation. The system may enhance the number of mature oocytes collected after superovulation or during ovarian tissue fragmentation for cryopreservation, when small follicles and immature oocytes are released. PVA-BTCA culture system may also be used for individual follicle growth.\n\nP-05. Autologous platelet-rich plasma for thin endometrium treatment: a case report\n\nAna Carolina de Souza Mangrich1, Thomas Gabriel Miklos1\n\n1 Santa Casa de São Paulo - São Paulo - SP - Brasil.\n\nObjective: The aim of this case report is to share a satisfactory outcome on the use of intrauterine infusion of PRP (platelet-rich plasma) in a patient with thin endometrium and refractoriness to other therapies.\n\nMethods: Data from medical records were used to base this case report, as well as scientific studies and other case reports published worldwide. PubMed and Embase were the data base used for the literature review.\n\nResults: Patient J.O.R.C, 41 years-old, female, diagnosed with premature ovarian failure, married to E.A.C., male, 40 years-old, healthy and with an unchanged spermogram. The couple had a frozen blastocyst stored, product of an intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) carried out with egg donation and E.A.C.’s sperm. During the cycle, endometrium was permanently thin and some attempts to thicken were made with both estrogen gel and low-dose aspirin, achieving the maximum thickness of 5mm. Administration of intrauterine PRP was attempted twice in the same cycle, with the gap of three days, in order to magnify the chances of a satisfactory outcome. Endometrial thickness was 7mm by the time of the transfer, after two intrauterine infusions of PRP. The stored frozen blastocyst was transferred, with the outcome of a healthy pregnancy and a child born and alive.\n\nConclusion: Assisted reproduction treatments (ART) may sometimes be challenging. Unsatisfactory endometrial growth (less than 7mm) is considered a bad prognostic factor, with lower chances of a successful implantation and pregnancy. Some embryo transfer cycles are cancelled due to a thin endometrium, leading to a extended treatment and increasing the anxiety which is inherent in the process. Numerous treatment modalities have been proposed, such as estrogen gel, low-dose aspirin, vitamin E, vaginal sildenafil and G-CSF (granulocyte-colony stimulating factor) intrauterine infusion. Nevertheless, in addition to the weak evidence level of those therapies, some patients remain non-responsive. PRP made with autologous blood plasma was tested in some pilot studies with a satisfactory response. It is already used for nerve repair and for multiple regeneration therapies in the Orthopaedic field, but in Gynaecology, studies with a higher number of patients are still needed in order to enrich evidence. It seems to work on proliferation and migration of endometrial cells, also enhancing the expression of regeneration and repairing factors and increasing local blood supply. Studies suggest a higher success rate in IVF (in-vitro fertilization) with the use of PRP, which could be a suitable alternative in cases of low-response to other methods. In addition, there is no risk of contracting infectious diseases or activating the immune system - the blood plasma enriched with platelets is autologous.\n\nP-06. Treatment of cervical ectopic pregnancy with methotrexate in a patient with recurrent ectopic pregnancy: a case report\n\nGaia Costa Pou1, Juan Carlos Pou Florentino1\n\n1 Gaia Centro de Reprodução Assistida - Criciúma - SC - Brasil.\n\nObjective: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of the treatment of cervical ectopic pregnancy with the use of methotrexate (MTX) in a patient with recurrent ectopic pregnancy.\n\nMethods: Report of a patient who had three ectopic pregnancies, the last being a cervical ectopic pregnancy. The diagnosis was made based on clinical examination and confirmed by ultrasonography, which identified the presence of a gestational sac with an embryo in the cervix. The treatment adopted for this patient was the use of MTX, a drug that interferes with the growth and development of embryonic cells, inducing the termination of ectopic pregnancy. In this case, the administration of MTX was chosen as a non-surgical alternative, aiming to avoid invasive procedures and preserve the patient's fertility. Regular follow-ups of beta-hCG levels to prepregnancy values were performed.\n\nResults: Cervical ectopic pregnancy is regarded as an exceptional location, accounting for less than 1% of ectopic pregnancies. Although rare, this is the most serious and dramatic obstetric pathology. E.V.M., a 28-year-old female patient with no previous history of pathology sought gynecological care due to complaints of infertility after six years of unsuccessful attempts. The patient reports having had two miscarriages in the year 2020, the first being an ectopic pregnancy in May 2019, which required a right salpingectomy, and the second an abortion with curettage performed in August 2019 at 5 weeks gestation. Despite the previous abortions, the patient had no changes on physical and gynecological examination. However, laboratory tests revealed altered anti-cardiolipin antibody and the presence of positive antinuclear factor, indicating possible immunological or autoimmune disorders. In June 2022, the patient returned to the clinic to undergo an in vitro fertilization cycle. After the transfer of two devitrified embryos, the patient presented with a twin pregnancy, with one intrauterine gestational sac and the second right ectopic gestational sac with a positive fetal heartbeat. As a result, the patient needed to undergo a right total salpingectomy to remove the ectopic gestational sac. The intrauterine pregnancy proceeded without complications, resulting in a full-term delivery. In March 2022, the patient returned to the service with the desire to perform a second embryo transfer. However, this pregnancy resulted in an abortion. In April 2022, the patient returned again for her last embryo transfer of her last embryo, resulting in a single pregnancy with cervical implantation. The treatment performed to induce the abortion was with three cycles of MTX. After the use of the medication, there was a regression of beta-hCG to pre-pregnancy values, indicating the resolution of the cervical ectopic pregnancy.\n\nConclusion: The use of MTX is an effective alternative treatment for cervical ectopic pregnancy. This non-surgical approach has the advantage of preserving the patient's fertility while avoiding the need for invasive procedures.\n\nP-07. Implantation potential when transferring morula stage embryos\n\nAndrea Mesquita Lima1, Eduardo Gomes Sá1, Fábio Eugenio Magalhaes Rodrigues1, Marcus Aurelio Bessa Paiva1, Sebastiao Evangelista Torquato1, Tulius Augustus Ferreira Freitas1, Ellayne Cavalcanti Queiroz1, Renata Reis Pimentel Castro1, Gleicyane Sousa Santos Alam1\n\n1BIOS - Fortaleza - CE - Brasil.\n\nObjective: To evaluate the implantation rate when embryo transfer was performed at the morula stage.\n\nMethods: 30 cases were analyzed, from February 2022 to May 2023, in which 30 transfers were performed, with an average of 1.7 embryos per transfer. The mean age of the patients was 37.7 years. In the study, only transfers with embryos in the morula stage were considered.\n\nResults: Among the analyzed cases, there was a 48% implantation rate for transfers performed on D4. Patients younger than 36 years had a higher implantation rate (66.7%) when compared to the group of patients older than 36 years (35.2%), who also transferred morulas, regardless of the number of embryos transferred. The embryos had been previously vitrified on the third day of culture after ICSI (INTRA CYTOPLASMIC SPERM INJECTION), and the transfer was performed 24 hours after devitrification.\n\nConclusion: The transfer of embryos in the morula stage, that is, in the stage that precedes the blastocyst stage, can be considered a viable option, as it demonstrates good results. It is noteworthy that the conduct regarding the stage of the embryo for transfer is a clinical decision, which should take into account the couple's history, based on individual circumstances.\n\nP-08. The importance of the Quality Management program in an Assisted Reproduction clinic\n\nAndrea Mesquita Lima1, Sebastião Evangelista Torquato1, Fabio Eugenio Magalhães Rodrigues1, Marcus Aurelio Bessa Paiva1, Tulius Augustus Ferreira Freitas1, Socorro Maria Pontes Parente Torquato1, Louise Studart Figueiredo1\n\n1BIOS - Fortaleza - CE - Brasil.\n\nObjective: On December 26, 2022, the new Collegiate Board Resolution (RDC) No. 771 was published, which provides for Good Practices in Germ Cells, Germ Tissues and Human Embryos for therapeutic use. This new Resolution replaces RDC No. 23, of May 27, 2011. One of the main changes in this new RDC was the need to implement a QMS (quality management system) in Assisted Human Reproduction (AHR) clinics. The objective of this work was to evaluate the points that showed improvements after the implementation of a QMS in the clinic.\n\nMethods: After the publication of the new RDC 771, in December 2022, the implementation of the QMS at the BIOS Clinic began. The clinic's quality management system is still being implemented, and in the present study some points initially implemented were evaluated, and in parallel, the improvements that the changes brought about were analyzed.\n\nResults: A thorough validation of the equipment, following a specific standard operating protocol (SOP), demonstrated that their useful life improved considerably, a fact that minimized costs and avoided fluctuations in working conditions, providing a better environment for patient samples. A quality control inspection of the materials and means used, with the implementation of standardized protocols before releasing them for use, increased the safety and reliability of the technical team in using a given lot. The control of non-conformities was a differentiating issue, because when management encountered any non-compliance, this was duly documented, and in the event of an imminent recurrence, a solution was promptly found, so that non-compliance could be avoided, carrying out preventive measures in a timely manner, when necessary. The QMS began to play a key role in ensuring patient safety, which involved establishing an adequate sample tracking system, maintaining ideal laboratory conditions for handling gametes and embryos, with due prevention of cross-contamination and due compliance with biosafety practices, with strict serological screening, meeting all the requirements of the new RDC. The implementation of the QMS solidified its quest for continuous improvement, which involved reviewing and analyzing performance indicators, identifying areas for improvement, and monitoring results.\n\nConclusion: The quality management system plays an extremely important role within an assisted human reproduction clinic. The new Resolution of the collegiate board RDC 771 came to emphasize the complexity of the processes involved in an in vitro fertilization treatment. A quality management system is essential to ensure process quality assurance, and in addition to reducing costs, it minimizes failures and maximizes process efficiency.\n\nP-09. The Correlation between KIDScore™ generated for each embryo grown in the Embryoscope Plus incubator and body mass index of patients undergoing assisted human recovery treatments\n\nAndrea Mesquita Lima1, Sebastião Evangelista Torquato Filho2, Tulius Augustus Ferreira Freitas1, Gleicyane Sousa Santos Alam1, Eduardo Gomes Sá1, Renata Reis Pimentel Castro1, Ellayne Cavalcanti Queiroz1\n\n1BIOS - Fortaleza - CE - Brasil.\n\n2Sollirium - Fortaleza - CE - Brasil.\n\nObjective: The aim of this study was to correlate the score of KIDScore (artificial intelligence software, which provides a score for embryos grown in the Embryoscope Plus incubator) with the BMI of patients undergoing in vitro fertilization treatment.\n\nMethods: From August 2022 to May 2023, 91 patients were analyzed, a total of 277 embryos. Patients were divided into 4 groups: Group 1 (low weight); Group 2 (normal weight); Group 3 (overweight) and Group 4 (obesity). All analyzed embryos were cultured in the Embryoscope incubator, so that they could be evaluated by KIDScore, an artificial intelligence software, which provides a score for the analyzed embryos.\n\nResults: Patients in groups 1 and 4 received the lowest scores according to the KIDScore analysis. Patients in Group 3 received intermediate scores, and patients in Group 2 received the highest score.\n\nConclusion: Thus, there is an influence of BMI on embryonic quality, with a significant difference in the values of the scores received by the embryos by the artificial intelligence program of Embryocope Plus, KIDScore.\n\nP-10. Adenomyosis - the Radiologist's Perspective\n\nFrancisco Sardinha1, Catarina Janicas2, Teresa Margarida Cunha3\n\n1 Hospital Garcia de Orta - Portugal.\n\n2 Centro Hospitalar de Lisboa Ocidental - Portugal.\n\n3 Instituto Português de Oncologia de Lisboa Francisco Gentil - Portugal.\n\nObjective: This poster presents an overview of adenomyosis from the radiologist's perspective, emphasizing the significance of non-invasive diagnostic techniques. It offers an in-depth analysis of transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings, reviews their respective attributes, and discusses potentially associated conditions.\n\nMethods: Adenomyosis is a benign condition characterized by the presence of heterotopic endometrial tissue within the myometrium, most probably due to invagination of the basal endometrial layer. These heterotopic endometrial cells continuously express high levels of estrogen receptors and apoptosis-suppressing mediators, leading to smooth muscle cell hypertrophy and hyperplasia. The prevalence of adenomyosis is highly variable due to demographic factors and non-uniform diagnostic criteria. Nevertheless, several risk factors, such as estrogen exposure, parity, and prior uterine surgery, have been identified. Patients most frequently present with menorrhagia, dysmenorrhea, and chronic pelvic pain, as well as increased risk of infertility and adverse pregnancy outcomes, including miscarriage. Given its significant prevalence and associated complications, determining an accurate non-invasive diagnostic approach is paramount. The accuracy of TVUS and MRI in diagnosing adenomyosis has been demonstrated, exhibiting specificities of 78% and 88%, respectively, and an equal sensitivity of 78%. However, since TVUS is highly operator-dependant and these results are primarily derived from expert-led studies, its performance is possible overestimated. Notwithstanding, TVUS widespread accessibility, lower cost, and shorter acquisition times make it the preferred initial imaging method. MRI, on the other hand, is mainly used as a secondary diagnostic technique due to its higher cost, longer acquisition times, and potential discomfort for certain patients, namely with claustrophobia. Yet, it remains relevant, as its superior soft tissue contrast resolution and multiplanar reconstructions allow for a better definition of the junctional zone and the diagnosis of potential estrogen-dependent conditions, such as fibroids and endometriosis. Using illustrative images from our institution's TVUS and MRI scans, we showcase a variety of adenomyosis manifestations discernible through both imaging methods.\n\nResults: Multiple authors have proposed classification systems for reporting adenomyosis on TVUS and MRI. However, they have yet to achieve validation and universal acceptance. Our approach emphasizes a classification from a histopathological perspective, distinguishing signs as either direct, correlating to ectopic endometrial foci, or indirect, corresponding to secondary myometrial hypertrophy. Direct signs tend to increase specificity, while indirect signs enhance diagnostic sensitivity. We detail and depict the distinct imaging manifestations and signs, establishing a correlation between TVUS and MRI.\n\nConclusion: Over the last few decades, advancements in non-invasive imaging techniques have facilitated the diagnosis of adenomyosis without requiring a surgical-histopathological procedure. This progress has enhanced physicians' understanding of the true incidence of adenomyosis within the general population and its clinical manifestations. Concurrently, comprehending the key imaging findings is vital for performing a non-invasive adenomyosis diagnosis. Understanding these findings' histopathological background and diagnostic value allows for better interpretation, identifying potential pitfalls, and detecting frequently associated conditions. The resulting comprehensive imaging assessment not only detects adenomyosis, but also guides the therapeutic strategy.\n\nP-11. Does elevated progesterone on day of trigger associate with blastocyst ploidy in egg donor cycles?\n\nPriscilla Lopes Caldeira1, Aline Rodrigues Lorenzon2, Ana Paula Aquino2, Bruna Barros2, Eduardo Leme Motta2, Thais Sanches Domingues Curry2, Pedro Augusto Araujo Monteleone1, Edmund Chada Baracat1, Jose Maria Soares Junior1\n\n1 Faculdade de Medicina da USP - São Paulo - SP - Brasil.\n\n2 Huntington - São Paulo - SP - Brasil.\n\nObjective: Evaluate if high progesterone levels on day of trigger influences blastocyst ploidy and laboratory outcomes in egg donors cycles.\n\nMethods: This retrospective cohort study, performed between April/2013 and February/2019 at Huntington Medicina Reprodutiva Clinic, analyzed laboratory data from ICSI cycles using frozen donated oocytes that underwent embryo biopsy (PGT-A) at blastocyst stage. Patients were divided into two groups according to serum progesterone (P4) on trigger day: group A if P4 <1.5 ng/mL and group B if P4 ≥1.5 ng/mL. Only euploid embryos were transfer on FET cycles. Primary outcome was embryo euploidy and aneuploidy rate. Secondary outcomes were number of blastocysts, number of top quality embryos, number of euploid/aneuploid embryos and clinical pregnancy rate. These parameters were compared between groups A and B. T and Fisher tests were used for statistical analysis.\n\nResults: 259 egg donors cycles with PGT-A were analyzed. Group A included 75 cycles (57 donors; 69 recipients) and group B 184 cycles (115 donors; 163 recipients). Group A donors`mean age was 25.15±3.59 and group B 24.46±3.73 years old (p=0.19). Total gonadotropins used and basal FSH were not different between the two groups (2777.83±526.02 vs 2814.54±538.78, p=0.7363; 5.19±1.51 vs 5.22±1.47, p=0.3035). Group B had a significantly higher number of antral follicular count (22.95±10.65 vs 19.60±7.08, p= 0.0301) and estradiol at trigger (5255.00±6405.77 vs 5252.83±4346.33 vs, p=0.0340). Number of eggs retrieved and number of MII were higher in group B than A (33.96±1.76 vs 28.01±11.78, p=0.0014; 24.84±11.74 vs 21.12±10.56, p=0.0082). There were no difference between groups in oocytes post-thaw survival rate and fertilization rate (0.95±0.10 vs 0.98±0.17, p=0.2626; 0.83±0.14 vs 0.82±0.13, p=0.854). The number of blastocysts (3.60±1.52 vs 3.68±1.52, p=0.667), number of top-quality embryos (2.27±1.59 vs 2.28±1.43, p=0.802), number of euploid embryos (1.92±1.25 vs 1.92±1.13, p=0.954) and number of aneuploid embryos (1.23±1.01 vs 1.14±0.94, p=0.593) were not significantly different between the two groups. Euploid embryo rate (0.31±0.20 vs 0.30±0.18, p=0.626) and aneuploidy embryo rate (0.21±0.19 vs 0.18±0.15, p=0.436) did not significantly differ. There was also no difference in clinical pregnancy rate (0.73 vs 0.82, p=0.476). Seminal parameters were similar between groups.\n\nConclusion: Our data showed that elevated progesterone levels on trigger’s day is not associated with blastocyst aneuploidy rates or worst laboratory outcomes in egg donor’s cycles, in which the cofounder of maternal age is excluded from the analysis.\n\nP-12. Impact of the use of the Zymot plate on the outcomes of Assisted Reproduction procedures at an in vitro fertilization clinic in Northeastern Brazil\n\nRenata Reis Pimentel Castro1, Andrea Mesquita Lima1, Sebastião Evangelista Torquato1, Tulius Augustus Ferreira Freitas1, Gleicyane Sousa Santos Alam1, Fábio Eugênio Magalhães Rodrigues1, Marcus Aurélio Bessa Paiva1\n\n1BIOS - Centro de Medicina Reprodutiva do Ceará - Fortaleza - CE - Brasil.\n\nObjective: To analyze and relate the use of the Zymot technique in assisted reproduction procedures, as well as its influence on parameters such as the rate of fertilized oocytes and quality of embryonic development, associating these data with the performance indicators of the Vienna Consensus.\n\nMethods: This is a retrospective study that used a pre-formed data sheet from a private Assisted Reproduction clinic in northeastern Brazil, using data from October 2020 to June 2023, totaling 69 cases, 1 of which was excluded from the research because calcium was used in the eggs. The mean age of women was between 38 years and normal weight, and the mean age of men was between 46 years and overweight. The seminal processing technique used in all cases was the Zymot.\n\nResults: After analyzing the data, it was possible to observe that the results of the parameters of the rates of the clinical indicators using the Zymot technique to process the semen, in order to obtain spermatozoa with better motility and with low levels of sperm DNA fragmentation, presented a good correlation with the quality indicators of the Vienna Consensus. The fertilization rate was 74.8%, the cleavage rate was 100%, and blastulation was 57.9%.\n\nConclusion: Female age may have an influence on the maturity rate parameter, while our findings suggest that male age has a greater impact on sperm DNA fragmentation and due to this, the Zymot technique was used to minimize fragmentation and this way to improve the quality of fertilization and embryonic development. Thus, we can state that the rates of the indicators were close with the use of the Zymot technique when compared with the rates of the Vienna Consensus.\n\nP-13. The relationship between KIDScore™ score generated for each embryo and implantation rates\n\nGleicyane Sousa dos Santos Alam1, Andrea Mesquita Lima1, Renata Reis Pimentel de Castro1, Eduardo Gomes Sá1, Ellayne Cavalcanti1, Sebastião Evangelista Torquato1, Tulius Augusto de Freitas1\n\n1Sollirium Health Group - Fortaleza - CE - Brasil\n\nObjective: The advancement of artificial intelligence within Assisted Human Reproduction is quite remarkable, and the implementation of Time-lapse technology added more values on the development and evaluation of the quality of embryos, without compromising the culture conditions. Due to the high amount of data generated for each embryo, several predictive implantation models based on morphokinetic parameters were developed. Among these models, KIDScore™ Day 5 stands out, considered a predictive model of implantation after embryonic transfer on the fifth day, developed for Embryoscope™ devices. The KIDScore™ system assigns a score that increases with the embryo's implantation potential, and aims to classify embryos from the same cohort to select the one with the greatest implantation potential for transfer. This study aims to present the relationship between the scores generated by KIDScore™ and the implantation rates for embryo transfer cases.\n\nMethods: 180 patients who transferred 1 or 2 embryos from February 2022 to November 2022 were analyzed. The KIDScore™ score of each embryo was recorded and, based on these scores, comparisons were made with the implantation rates. Inclusion criteria to determine implantation rates were: positive Beta HCG result, presence or absence of a gestational sac, and fetal heartbeat. The results of genetic analysis of transferred embryos were considered exclusion criteria for this study.\n\nResults: The grades presented on KIDScore day 5 range from 0 to 9.9. Of the embryos analyzed in the study, there was no pattern of notes, as a variation between the Scores was observed, but without significantly affecting the result of the implantation rates. Embryos with high scores, such as 9.5, 8.7, 7.7, showed high implantation rates, but also embryos with low scores, 6.4, 5.8, 4.2, obtained satisfactory results in relation to the implantation rate. However, some parameters were observed, such as: the transfer of 2 embryos, when an embryo has a Score much lower than the first, the result of positive Beta HCG was reported, and the presence of a gestational sac, with a single embryo and with heartbeats heart defects, which may predict that the embryo with the lowest score did not have implantation potential compared to the one with the highest score. About 5% of the analyzed cases that transferred two embryos, the twin pregnancy was confirmed, with the observation that the scores of the embryos had notes with very close values. It was also described in 10% of cases confirmation of positive Beta HCG and presence of gestational sac, but absence of heartbeats, being observed that there is no relationship with a KIDScore™ grade pattern, as the grades of these specific cases vary between 4.5 and 9.1.\n\nConclusion: After analyzing the KIDScore™ scores for the transferred embryos compared with the implantation rates, it is possible to understand that the score that the predictive method determines for each embryo may not interfere with the implantation, since in cases of low scores there were satisfactory implantation results, although it was also observed that the higher the grade, the greater the chance of implantation. A highlight would be the fact of transferring two embryos, which, one has a lower score than the other, the chance of only the one with the highest score implanting is greater than the two embryos implanting.\n\nP-14. Correlation between the number of pregnancies and abortions and the cause of infertility in patients at a public center for Assisted Human Reproduction (RHA) in Brazil\n\nUaska Bezerra e Silva1, Lívia Christina Alves da Silva1, José Roberto Izídio Lopes1, Pryscila Cynara Soares Vieira1, Hosana Fausto de Sousa1, Mychelle de Medeiros Garcia Torres2, Kelley Rossana do Nascimento Barbosa1, Carla Simone Medeiros Silva1, Marcela Queiroz Lopes de Melo Martins1, Beatriz de Araújo Cruz2, Edualeide Jeane Pereira Bulhoes da Nóbrega2\n\n1 EBSERH - Natal - RN - Brasil.\n\n2 UFRN-Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Norte - Natal - RN - Brasil.\n\nObjective: To analyze the correlation between the number of pregnancies and abortions and the infertility factor of couples who underwent assisted human reproduction (AHR) procedures in a public center in Brazil.\n\nMethods: The cause of infertility and the female age group of 155 couples who had pregnancy by Human Artificial Insemination (HAI) and Intracytoplasmic Sperm Injection (ICSI) between December 2013 and March 2023 and the incidence of missbirth in 123 couples were analyzed. who obtained pregnancy between the years 2013 to 2018 by RHA procedures, according to the cause of infertility and female age group.\n\nResults: The highest number of ICSI pregnancies occurred among couples whose cause of infertility was male factor (75), followed by tubal factor (53), ovarian factor (22), endometriosis (14), smaller numbers were found for infertility without apparent cause (ISCA) (5), female age factor (3) and female hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (1). Greater numbers of pregnancies by HAI occurred in couples with ISCA (14), followed by ovarian factor (4), male factor (3) and endometriosis (1). There was no occurrence of abortions in patients who underwent HAI. The number of abortions in couples who underwent ICSI was higher for those with infertility factor male (11) and tubal (11), followed by ovarian factor (4) and female age factor. The female age group with the highest incidence of pregnancy was 31 to 37 years (52%), followed by ≥ 38 years (30%) and ≤ 30 years (18%). And the incidence of abortion accompanied the number of pregnancies, being higher in the female age group from 31 to 37 years (55%), followed by the group ≥ 38 years (32%) and ≤ 30 years (14%).\n\nConclusion: A greater number of pregnancies by ICSI were identified in couples whose cause of infertility was a male factor. Thus, the analysis proves what is already evidenced in the literature, that ICSI has allowed couples in which the partner has some seminal alteration to develop a pregnancy that would not be possible naturally. The second highest number of pregnancies was identified in couples with tubal factor as the cause of infertility, this result was expected because, in vitro fertilization allows external fertilization, this overcomes the limitations of tubal alterations. Pregnancies by HAI occurred in greater numbers in couples with an undetermined cause of infertility. An important result to be emphasize is absent of abortion among couples who underwent HAI between the years 2013 to 2018.In the same period, the highest abortion rate was correlated with the male infertility factor, once to the low genetic quality of spermatozoa can induce miscarriage. The female age group with the highest incidence of pregnancies and also abortions was between 31 and 37 years, significantly higher proportion than for the group of 38 years or older. For patients aged 30 years or less, the number of pregnancies was lower, mainly due to the low demand for AHR treatments in this age group. This work presented an overview of the number of pregnancies and abortions related to the infertility factor and female age group within a group of patients who underwent AHR treatment at a Center of the public helth system.\n\nP-15. Non-conformances management in IVF laboratories\n\nPatricia Giffron Rodrigues1, Rodopiano Souza Florêncio1\n\n1 Humana Medicina Reprodutiva - Goiânia - GO - Brasil.\n\nObjective: The purpose of this study is to guide laboratory teams to structure effective approaches to managing non-conformances.\n\nMethods: Analyzes were performed from the NCBI and Pubmed database. The search keywords were “quality management in IVF laboratory”, “IVF errors”, “non-conformance in IVF laboratory”, “cost of non-conformance”, “risk assessment in laboratory” and “corrective action”.\n\nResults: The scarcity of published data regarding non-conformances shows that the phrase “to err is human” may not be applicable in the IVF (in vitro fertilization) context. This lack of information is directly associated with the scenario of the infertility treatment journey itself, which tends to be challenging, stressful and decisive for families. In this circumstance, the activities in IVF laboratories must be performed in a standard way, with monitoring and control.\n\nThe literature portrays that the standardization of procedures drastically reduces the possibilities of error, in this sense, the concept of non-conformance was established as the non-fulfillment of a previously established requirement. In general, two types of non-conformances can occur in the IVF laboratory: active errors and latent errors. Active errors are generated by insecurity that can cause harm to patients or the system, such as human errors and communication errors. Latent errors arise due to inefficiencies in the system, such as understaffing, ineffective management, poorly maintained equipment, and inaccurate protocols. The non-conformances management requires the implementation of several actions with the objective of solving occurrences, avoiding rework, waste and loss. Structured dynamics must be able to identify and address the root cause and propose actions to minimize the risk of recurrence. The culture of identifying the root cause, implemented by the institutions, has proven to be an effective strategy for managing the quality of laboratories. Studies highlight the importance of recording non-conformances, both to show, in audits, the actions that were carried out and to track opportunities for improvement. After registration, the team will be able to use tools capable of identifying the causes of problems, such as: Ishikawa diagram, 5 whys and Pareto chart. From the identification of the root cause, it is necessary to structure an action plan to deal with occurrences with corrective and preventive actions. As evidenced in the Deming cycle (PDCA), the steps that promote continuous process improvement are based on “plan’, “do”, “check” and “act”. This tool is also widely used in the treatment of non-conformances. In this way, the search for the root cause and the elaboration of action plans are inserted in the planning phase (P) according to the PDCA. Once the root cause analysis has been well structured it will be possible to plan assertive actions so that recurrences do not occur. According to the literature, one of the most used strategies for the elaboration of action plans is the 5W2H. This tool is capable of structuring all the necessary actions to deal with a non-conformance through the following criteria: what to do, where to do it, why, when, who, how, how much. After preparing the action plan, it is necessary to implement it in the institution, this phase corresponds to “doing” (D), later, it will be essential to check (C) whether the processes are working as planned so that actions can be taken (A) adapting to routine.\n\nConclusion: Despite the diversity of non-conformities faced by institutions, it is possible to define a general basis of approaches that prove to be effective when using specific management tools. Therefore, the management of non-conformances is based on the identification, registration, classification, analysis, implementation of corrective actions, monitoring and continuous improvement.\n\nP-16. The pregnancy outcomes of a good morphology embryos transfer: a comparison between transfer of one euploid embryo versus two morphologically selected embryos\n\nAmanda Amorim Araújo1, Patrícia Giffron Rodrigues1, Gustavo Cardoso Borges1, Rodopiano Souza Florêncio1\n\n1 Humana Medicina Reprodutiva - Goiânia - GO - Brasil.\n\nObjective: To compare the transfer of an euploid embryo in relation to two thawed embryos not genetically tested and to correlate with gestational parameters per transfer.\n\nMethods: A retrospective observational study was conducted with 383 patients recruited from a single clinical center. Data were obtained from thawed embryo transfers between January 2020 and December 2021. Two groups of thawed embryo transfers were analyzed: Biopsy Group - patients who underwent transfer of 1 euploid blastocyst of good morphological quality [≥3BB, Gardner e Schoolcraft (1999)]; Control Group - patients who underwent transfer of 2 blastocysts of good morphological quality without genetic study (≥3BB). Exclusion criteria were: oocyte recipient patients, change in the patient's or partner's karyotype previously detected that predisposes the couple to aneuploidy. The clinical data of the patients were collected, as well as the follow-up of those who had a confirmed pregnancy and we evaluated gestacional parameters such as: Implantation rate, chemical pregnancy rate (β-hCG > 40mIU/ml); Clinical pregnancy rate (confirmation of gestational sac on ultrasound); live birth rate (≥ 22weeks); chemical miscarriage rate (β-hCG >40mIU/ml without visualization of gestational sac); Clinical miscarriage rate (pregnancy loss after visualization of gestational sac); and miscarriage rate per gestational sac.\n\nResults: We identified that the Biopsy group has significantly lower values than the Control Group when comparing the chemical pregnancy rate (59% vs. 70%, p=0.0302) and live birth rate (42% vs. 54%, p=0.0405). Implantation rate, clinical pregnancy, chemical and clinical miscarriage did not show statistical difference (not shown). Gestational parameters distinguished by patient age are shown in table 1. When comparing abortions due to gestational sacs in the Biopsy group and the Control group with multiple pregnancies, no differences were found when evaluating all patients. Comparing miscarriages per gestational sacs in the Biopsy group versus the Control group with multiple pregnancies, no differences were found when evaluating all patients (22% vs. 22%, p=1.000), in patients <35 years (9% vs. 21%, p=0.3683) and those aged ≥35years (28% vs. 28%, p=1.0000)(not shown).\n\nConclusion: We observed that, when the objective is to have a baby at home, the transfer protocol of two good quality embryos still has an advantage in our clinical center in relation to the transfer of a single euploid embryo, resulting in higher rates of chemical pregnancy and live births. Although the transfer of two embryos provides a lower implantation rate in patients aged ≥35 years, this group has lower rates of clinical abortion, providing values of live births equivalent to the Biopsy group. High rates of multiple pregnancies are highlighted, however, the rates related to abortion do not seem to interfere when we transfer 2 embryos.\n\nP-17. Evaluation of the use of dydrogesterone in the suppression of luteinizing gonadotropic hormone elevation during ovarian stimulation in in vitro fertilization cycles: a comparative analysis\n\nDaniela Fink Hassan1, Karina Fattori1\n\n1 Centro de Reprodução Humana Wahib Hassan - Penápolis - SP - Brasil.\n\nObjective: During the in vitro fertilization (IVF) process, controlled ovarian stimulation has been considered one of the most critical steps. Ineffective suppression of the sudden rise in gonadotropic luteinizing hormone (LH) before the trigger moment accounts for 20 to 50% of the reasons for cycle cancellation. Drug protocols for pituitary blockade during ovarian stimulation are scarce, antagonist analogs of gonadotropin-releasing hormone are the most used, reducing the impact of premature luteinization on IVF cancellation rates. The primary objective of this study was to establish the incidence of premature LH surge by determining early ovulation the pituitary blockade, with one group using oral dydrogesterone and the other using a gonadotropin-releasing hormone antagonist, resulting in cancellation of the IVF cycle. The secondary objective was to analyze the time from ovarian stimulation to the moment of triggering of oocyte maturation, correlating with age group and with ultrasonographic evaluation and counting of ovarian antral follicles.\n\nMethods: This is a retrospective study carried out in a cohort of patients at the Human Reproduction Center between January 2021 and July 2023. Oocytes from 182 women underwent intracytoplasmic sperm injection and were divided into two groups. We established a descriptive comparative analysis between the group of ovarian stimulation with recombinant gonadotropin (GonalF/Pergoveris®) and flexible suppression with the injectable antagonist (Cetrotide 0.25 mg®) starting when one of the follicles reached 14 mm in average diameter, remaining until the day of onset and the other group using corifolitropin alfa (Elonva®)/recombinant gonadotropin (Pergoveris®) associated with an oral dose of 30 mg of dydrogesterone (Duphaston®), from the second day of the menstrual cycle until triggering.\n\nResults: A comparative analysis of the results between the two protocols was determined. A total of 182 patients aged between 26 and 49 years were allocated, 89 in the antagonist group and 93 in the dydrogesterone group. In the antagonist group, the mean age was 36.9 years, with a previous antral follicle count of 5.8 follicles and a duration of ovarian stimulation of 11.31 days. In the dydrogesterone group, the mean age was 34.3 years, with 9.9 antral follicles evaluated and an ovarian stimulation period of 11.31 and 13.96 days. Premature luteinization with early ovulation was observed in 5.37% of women in the antagonist group and none of the women in the dydrogesterone group (0%). However, we observed that women who ovulated early were of advanced maternal age, with a low ovarian reserve and a low response to ovarian stimulation (Poseidon 4). We observed an extension of time in days from ovarian stimulation to the trigger moment, adding another 3.3 days in the dydrogesterone group, making a total of 12 to 14 days of ovarian stimulation\n\nConclusion: The use of dydrogesterone becomes a possible and effective option to prevent premature LH surges during the pituitary block in ovarian stimulation cycles for IVF. Associated with the benefits of reducing financial costs, ease of oral administration, and especially when the transfer of fresh embryos is not intended.\n\nP-18. Male infertility and the relationship of seminal viscosity and sperm DNA fragmentation\n\nDarlete Lima Matos1, Karla Rejane Oliveira Cavalcanti1, Fabricio Sousa Martins1, Daniel Paes Diogenes de Paula1, Lilian Maria da Cunha Serio1, Ana Normelia Pereira Morais1\n\n1 Nucleo de Medicina Reprodutiva do Ceara - Fortaleza - CE - Brasil.\n\nObjective: Our objective was to evaluate the existence of a relationship between sperm DNA fragmentation and seminal hyperviscosity.\n\nMethods: In our study population, all patients were instructed to maintain a period of abstinence between 48 and 72 hours and perform semen collection using the masturbation method. Patients were divided into groups of samples with normal and altered viscosity parameters, correlated with the sperm DNA fragmentation index test. The samples were conditioned at 37°C for 30 minutes to determine the state of liquefaction. The semen parameters analyzed followed the guidelines protocol of the World Health Organization (WHO). Thus, the parameters of seminal volume, percentage of sperm motility, and total concentration of motile spermatozoa were evaluated. For the evaluation of sperm fragmentation, the chromatin dispersion test was used, where the spermatozoa were fixed in agarose gel and washed in lysis solutions for DNA exposure. Spermatozoa with intact DNA had an expressive halo formed around the head, while spermatozoa with fragmented DNA had no or reduced halo. For statistical analysis, results were expressed as mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM), and the two groups were compared using Student's t-test for independent samples. A significance level of 0.05 (a = 5%) was adopted.\n\nResults: The results showed among patients a sperm concentration and progressive motility greater than 16x106 spermatozoa/mL and 30%, respectively. Furthermore, strict Kruger morphology was greater than 4%, with spermatozoa being considered normal according to the analysis reference standard. Samples with increased viscosity (60%) did not show sperm fragmentation above normal. When analyzing the relationship between seminal viscosity and the fragmentation index, it was observed that sperm DNA fragmentation was higher in normal samples without alteration in viscosity (57%) when compared to patients with semen with increased viscosity (above 40%). According to literature data, DNA damage would be associated with low natural pregnancy rates, intrauterine inseminations (IUI), and results obtained from in vitro fertilization (IVF), in addition to the association with increased risk of miscarriages in couples who have undergone assisted reproduction techniques (for example, IVF and Intracytoplasmic Sperm Injection - ICSI). On the other hand, methods for evaluating the status of cellular DNA do not exclude the presence of a subpopulation without damage to the sperm's genetic material. Thus, in order not to justify the incorporation of fragmentation tests into the seminal analysis routine by reaffirming the low performance due to the test sensitivity.\n\nConclusion: In conclusion, this study showed the relationship between sperm viscosity and the fragmentation rate. In our results, no association was found when analyzing these parameters in isolation, which reinforces the hypothesis that this is a transient condition for the patient. In addition, seminal parameters may enable better results over time (collection of new samples), not necessarily associated with the evaluation of hyperviscosity. It is also important to correlate all standard results and additional seminal evaluation tests in an attempt to minimize the direct risks of low pregnancy rates and inappropriate medical management.\n\nP-19. Ex vivo mature oocyte retrieval resulting in healthy singleton pregnancy and live birth\n\nBruno Ramalho Carvalho1, Iris Oliveira Cabral2, Taise Moura Franceschi1, Georgia Fontes Cintra3, Janina Ferreira Loureiro Huguenin3, Leandro Santos Araújo Resende4, Andrea Tatiane Oliveira Silva Barros5\n\n1 Bruno Ramalho Reprodução Humana - Brasília - DF - Brasil.\n\n2 Genesis Centro de Assistência em Reprodução Humana - Brasília - DF - Brasil.\n\n3 Instituto Brasileiro de Controle de Câncer - São Paulo - SP - Brasil.\n\n4 Oncoclínicas Aliança Asa Sul - Brasília - DF - Brasil.\n\n5Centro de Tratamento do Câncer Medradius - Maceió - AL - Brasil.\n\nObjective: To report the first pregnancy (surrogate) and live birth from the intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) of ex vivo retrieved mature oocytes, in a woman with bilateral ovarian carcinoma.\n\nMethods: Case report\n\nResults: A 34-year-old nulliparous woman with bilateral ovarian tumor, with a risk of malignancy at 96.1%, according to IOTA-ADNEX. Controlled ovarian stimulation was performed with corifolitropin alfa 150mcg, complemented by follitropin beta 100IU/day from day 5 to day 7, and followed by follitropin beta 200IU/day, the latter from the day 8 onwards, in a GnRH antagonist cycle. A single dose of choriogonadotropin alfa 250 mcg was used as trigger on stimulation day 12. Surgery was programmed to occur ~36 hours after the trigger. Follicular aspiration was proceeded in the operating room, guided by ultrasound applied directly to oophorectomized specimens, yielding 12 metaphase II oocytes, which were vitrified. After remission of the disease, the patient returned, counting on her 33-year-old sister for surrogacy. ICSI with donor sperm was performed in the 12 vitrified-thawed oocytes, resulting in the normal development of 9 cleavage-stage embryos, two of which were chosen for transfer to the surrogate mother, according to KIDScore D3. Surplus embryos were cryopreserved. A positive pregnancy test was achieved 12 days after embryo transfer, evolving to a normal healthy singleton pregnancy, an uneventful prenatal follow-up, and the live birth of a healthy 46,XX baby.\n\nConclusion: Ex vivo retrieval and cryopreservation of mature oocytes is a viable and efficacious approach for fertility preservation in women with ovarian cancer, mitigating the risk of tumor cells spillage into the pelvis. This is the first report of pregnancy and live birth resulting from ICSI of ex vivo retrieved mature oocytes.\n\nP-20. Overlapping doses of corifollitropin alfa in a progestin-primed regimen may be an interesting advance towards a patient-extremely friendly controlled ovarian stimulation: a case report\n\nJuliana Késia Araújo Fonseca1, Bárbara Veloso Avila Chaves1, Maria Júlia Ferreira de Carvalho Mariano Rodrigues Cunha1, Nayara Santos Soares2, Estella Thaisa Sontag Reis2, Bruno Ramalho Carvalho2\n\n1 Centro Universitário de Brasília - Brasília - DF - Brasil.\n\n2 Bruno Ramalho Reprodução Humana - Brasília - DF - Brasil.\n\nObjective: To report the results of controlled ovarian stimulation using ovelapped doses of corifollitropin alfa, in a progestin-primed cycle, for social egg freezing.\n\nMethods: Case report\n\nResults: Nuligesta, 37 years old, with regular menstrual cycles, 57kg, body mass index 20.19 k/m2, sought the private clinic for social egg freezing. No alterations were identified in pre-treatment complementary exams and the ultrasonographic antral follicle count was 17. The patient was stimulated following a progestin-primed ovarian stimulation protocol, using corifolitropin alfa (CFA), 100 mcg, on the third day (D3) of the menstrual cycle. A new 100 mcg dose of CFA was administered on treatment day 5 (D5), according to the observation of pharmacokinetic curves described in CFA validation studies. Pituitary supression was also initiated on D5, using desogestrel (DSG), 75 mcg/day. On D11, follicular maturation was triggered with triptorelin acetate, 0.2 mg (two injections of 0.1 mg).Abdominal distention and edema of the lower extremities were the only adverse effects reported, but they were well tolerated without specific medication. Follicular aspiration was performed 36 hours after trigger, yielding 12 oocytes, of which 10 in metaphase II (vitrified), 1 in metaphase 1 and 1 in prophase I (discarded).\n\nConclusion: Overlapped doses of CFA in a DSG-primed ovarian stimulation protocol demonstrated to be a safe, efficacious, well-tolerated, and cost-effective, being an extremely friendly treatment option for social egg freezing. Further well-designed studies are necessary for validation.\n\nP-21. Assisted Reproduction Techniques for same affective couples: A literature review\n\nFernanda Kunrath Robin1, Bruna Andrade da Silva2, Gissele Nardini Artigas de Oliveira2, Nilo Frantz1\n\n1 Nilo Frantz Medicina Reprodutiva - Porto Alegre - RS - Brasil.\n\n2 Centro Universitário Ritter dos Reis - Porto Alegre - RS - Brasil.\n\nObjective: The main objective of this research was to identify the main assisted reproduction techniques that can be used by same-sex couples.\n\nMethods: This is a narrative review, based on scientific productions published between 2015 and 2021. The search was carried out in the Virtual Health Library (VHL) database. The descriptors “reproduction techniques” and “homosexuality” were consulted on the Health Sciences Descriptors website (DECS) and applied in the VHL, generating the respective search code: reproduction techniques AND homosexuality AND (year_cluster:[2015 TO 2021] As inclusion criteria for the research, full and original texts with publications in the years 2015 to 2021, in the languages: English, Portuguese, French, Spanish and German that fit the subject studied were chosen. publications that did not answer the question to be discussed in this study were defined.\n\nResults: The search resulted in 40 publications that were carefully organized and read, remaining in the study 08 articles that answered the guiding question of the research. The studies presented demonstrated that there are several treatment possibilities for same-sex couples to fulfill their desire to build their families through the use of their own gametes and a solidary uterus. Among the possibilities are intrauterine insemination and in vitro fertilization treatments. In Brazil, it is possible to use heterologous gametes, and we have some national and international semen banks, where it is possible to choose the most appropriate characteristics and purchase the material. In the case of eggs, we rely on international banks or on the RHA clinics' own egg banks. Furthermore, there is the possibility for homosexual couples to carry out in vitro fertilization treatments, donating part of their gametes and receiving discounts on their treatments. In addition to the possibility of using a replacement uterus, mainly necessary for male homoaffective couples.\n\nConclusion: This study showed that in Brazil there are several possibilities for same-sex couples to build their families through their own gametes, however, the complexity of treatments combined with high costs are still factors that make access difficult for the population. In addition, even though same-sex unions are recognized in Brazil, there are still many taboos on this subject and many have the vision and defend the concept of traditional family, that is, the one composed of father and mother, of different genders. opposites.\n\nP-22. The Power of Interdisciplinary Collaboration: Integrating Mental Health Professionals in Multidisciplinary Care of Transgender Individuals\n\nHelena Prado Lopes1, Flávia Assis Silva Giacon2\n\n1 Pró-Fértil Medicina Reprodutiva - Rio de Janeiro - RJ - Brasil.\n\n2 Mater Prime Clínica de Reprodução Humana - São Paulo - SP - Brasil.\n\nObjective: This study aimed to analyze narratives of transgender patients received at the primary care clinic for transgender people by the multidisciplinary team of the State Institute of Diabetes and Endocrinology (IEDE) in Rio de Janeiro. Our interest in undertaking this study stemmed from observing narratives of transgender patients, which provided us with a broader understanding of the intricate issues they face, particularly pertaining to the reconfiguration of their roles within society, as well as the profound consequences encountered within familial and social contexts. As researchers, we participated as listeners in team meetings comprising a psychologist, endocrinologist, nurse, social worker, and psychiatrist, engaged in patient screenings at the clinic, and, based on that, noticed that most patients shared past experiences being subjected to discriminatory behavior by healthcare teams in other care centers. In this context, based on the analysis of the psychological interviews conducted during patient screening, we observed that the vast majority of individuals reported experiencing anxiety, insecurity, feelings of worthlessness, family/social isolation, and distress arising from the fear of not being able to access medical treatment for gender affirmation. It is important to highlight that patients’ negative perceptions towards medical care, regardless of the intentions of the healthcare professionals, may lead to feelings of discomfort and mistrust, ultimately discouraging transgender individuals from seeking specialized medical assistance, for example. Numerous patients reported perceiving insensitivity towards their gender identity from the medical staff at care centers, including the use of incorrect pronouns (for example, referring to a transgender woman as “he”). Nevertheless, our experience as listeners during patient screenings and team meetings highlighted the dedicated and respectful approach towards the patients demonstrated by the IEDE team. Our findings suggest that the thoughtful and considerate approach adopted by the multidisciplinary team at IEDE, which incorporates mental health professionals, empowers patients to shape their coping strategies and pursue more adaptive means to mitigate both potential challenges and anxiety experienced during treatment. Furthermore, we highlight the importance of fostering collaborative efforts between healthcare professionals and mental health practitioners within assisted reproduction centers. Finally, it is imperative to recognize and address inherent anxieties associated with medical care while also ensuring the availability of collaborative psychosocial support networks. Such initiatives are vital in enhancing the overall quality of life for transgender individuals.\n\nMethods: The methodology used in this study encompassed literature review and data collection from research articles pertaining to the topic. A systematic review of national and international literature was carried out between March and December, 2022 on databases such as the Scientific Electronic Library Online (SciELO), Google Scholar, and PubMed. After the application of inclusion and exclusion criteria, 12 articles were identified. Most studies were international, qualitative in nature, with a specific emphasis on evaluating the quality of care delivered to transgender individuals by multidisciplinary teams.\n\nResults: The literature review consistently revealed that transgender individuals often perceive inadequate support from healthcare professionals, which has also been identified based on the patient reports from the IEDE healthcare clinic.\n\nConclusion: We emphasize the importance of establishing collaborative efforts between healthcare professionals and mental health practitioners within assisted reproduction centers, as done at the IEDE. This integration is crucial for effectively addressing the unique needs of the transgender population. The extensive healthcare experience provided to transgender individuals at the aforementioned clinic highlights the vital importance and need for effective interdisciplinary teamwork in facilitating and delivering comprehensive care for these patients.\n\nP-23. Correlation between the time of disappearance of pronuclei and blastulation rate\n\nAndrea Mesquita Lima1, Sebastião Evangelista Torquato Filho2, Tulius Augustus Ferreira Freitas1, Gleicyane Sousa Santos Alam1, Eduardo Gomes Sá1, Ellayne Cavalcanti Queiroz1\n\n1BIOS - Fortaleza - CE - Brasil.\n\n2Sollirium - Fortaleza - CE - Brasil.\n\nObjective: The objective of this study was to correlate the blastulation rate of embryos cultured in a Timelapse incubator, with the time in which the pronuclei disappeared.\n\nMethods: After verification of fertilization, patients whose zygotes had two pronuclei were grouped according to the time of disappearance of the pronuclei. 303 zygotes whose pronuclei disappeared before 22 hours after intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) and 170 zygotes whose pronuclei disappeared after 22 hours of ICSI.\n\nResults: It was observed that the embryos with the best morphokinetic Evolution and higher rate of blatulation were those in which the pronuclei disappeared less than 22 hours after ICSI (78,2%) when compared to zygotes whose pronuclei disappeared after 22 hours after ICSI (48%).\n\nConclusion: The time-lapse technology is very useful, as it allows the monitoring of events that would not be possible to be evaluated in conventional cultivation. In the present study, it was evidenced that the time of disappearance of the pronuclei seems to be a predictive value for blastulation rate.\n\nP-24. Definition of a protocol of seminal cryopreservation for Rio de Janeiros’s Sperm Bank\n\nLincoln Bastos Farias Junior1, Mariana Duque Mello1, Marcel Frajblat2, Paula Fontoura1\n\n1 Banco de Sêmen do Rio de Janeiro (BSRJ) - Rio de Janeiro - RJ - Brasil.\n\n2 Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ) - Rio de Janeiro - RJ - Brasil.\n\nObjective: The aim of this study is to compare the crioprotetors Spermfreeze™, Ingá Spermfreezing™ and Spermfreeze SSP™ and define a standard operating procedure (SOP) for sperm freezing at Rio de Janeiro’s Sperm Bank\n\nMethods: Samples of patients of Rio de Janeiro Sperm Bank were used. The patients signed a Free and Informed Consent Form, which informs the possibility of using their data in scientific studies. Patients with azoospermia and severe oligospermia were excluded from the study. Before the freezing, the parameters motility, morphology and vitality of the samples were analyzed. The freezing was carried out according to the protocol of each kit and the samples were frozen for a period of one month. After one month, they went through the thawing process to analyze the rates of motility, vitality and sperm morphology.\n\nResults: After the analysis before and after freezing the sample of 13 volunteers, the mean of recovery of sperm motility was 59.211±5.027 using Spermfreeze™, 61.15±4.562 using Ingá Spermfreezing and 61.86±6.134 using Spermfreeze SSP™; the mean of recovery of sperm morphology was 91.59±3.299 using Spermfreeze, 86.01±5.536 using Ingá Spermfreezing and 91.20±4.452 using Spermfreeze SSP™, the mean of recovery of sperm vitality was 60.06 ± 4.940 using Spermfreeze, 58.88±6.512 using Ingá Spermfreezing and 56.16±7.275 using Spermfreeze SSP™. No significant difference was found between cryoprotectants in the parameters of survival, motility and sperm morphology.\n\nConclusion: Aiming the reduction of the use of components of animal origin in the laboratory at Rio de Janeiro’s Sperm Bank and considering the cost-effectiveness of each cryopreservation medium, Fertipro® Spermfreeze™ medium was chosen as the SOP of choice for seminal cryopreservation at Rio de Janeiro’s Sperm Bank.\n\nP-25. TikToking infertility in Brazil\n\nRenata Lima Bossi1, Raquel Lanna Cerqueira1, Debora Alvarenga1, Ana Carolina Xavier1, Marcos Sampaio1, Marcia Mendonça Carneiro1\n\n1 Origen Medicina Reprodutiva - Belo Horizonte - MG - Brasil.\n\nObjective: To determine the prevalence, authorship, and types of fertility-related information shared on TikTok (TT) in Brazil using hashtag and content analysis. Analysis of post content accordingto author type (healthcare professional versus lay people) and the identification of the topics that prevailed in those interactions were secondary outcomes.\n\nMethods: We hypothesized that there is a high volume of fertility/infertility health related\n\ncontent on TikTok (TT) in Brazil and that the accuracy of this content is generally poor. As such, we sought to characterize the presence of fertility/infertility -related information on TT in two ways.\n\n1.quantify the volume of fertility/infertility related content on TT using the following hashtags: maternity, TTC (trying to conceive), IVF, endometrisis and infertility.\n\n2.Classify the health-related content contained on these posts. Post content classification was determined by a single author . In instances where post characterization or accuracy were equivocal, a third author reviewed the post for adjudication.\n\nEach post was characterized by type into:\n\n1.educational/ scientific\n\n2.promotional,\n\n3.testimonial\n\n4.entertainment.\n\nThe account from which the post was created was further characterized by account type: (personal, creator, business/clinic/industry, healthcare professional (HCP) and, physician. We also determined the number of followers, likes, comments, and shares for each post on TT.\n\nResults: Overall we found 46 accounts that published on the topics searched: #maternity (n=10), #TTC (n=10), #endometriosis (n=10),#IVF (n=10) and infertility (n=10). Content analysis showed that the majority focused on personal testimonials (n=25), educational/scientific (n=20) and entertainment (n=5). As for authroship, most were lay individuals (n=23), followed by those reporting on their personal experience (n=11), medical doctors (n=10), healthcare professionals (n=6) and one clinic. The number of followers ranged from 89 to 4.4 milion with a mean of 3012. The account with most followers (n=4.400.000) belongs to a medical school student talking about infertility , followed by a creator account (n=1.800.000 ) on endometriosis, and third one by another medical school student (n=1.500.000 ) focused on infertility. Engagement measured by the number of likes and comments revealed that the 3 most popular topics were: (1)TTC :entertainment vídeo by a creator (1.7 milion likes, 24.700 comments, 21.900 saved, 14.900 shares; (2)maternity: entertainment vídeo by a creator (1.6 milion likes, 12.700 comments, 63.900 saved, 14.400 shares,; (3)infertility a scientific vídeo by a creator (637.900 likes, 24.300 comments, 16.500 saved, 23.900 shares, type educational.\n\nConclusion: The majority of infertility related TikTok posts are authored by lay people and discuss infertility and endometriosis with millions of followers. Entertainment vídeos on TTC and maternity engaged the most attention followed by a scientifc vídeo. Despite the availability of various scientific vídeos, those with personal content engaged more attention. Official healthcare presence was lacking and healthcare professionals are still a minority. TikToki s an extremely popular social media especially among young people and may represent a great opportunity to educate on relevant themes such as infertility and endometriosis. Increased healthcare professional participation is advisable. More studies examining the volume, reach and accuracy of reproductive health information available on social media such as TikTok are necessary.\n\nP-26. Surrogacy: a 20-year experience in a Reproductive Medicine clinic in Brazil\n\nCássia Cançado Avelar1, Natalia Silva1, Leticia Eto1, Catharina Cançado Avelar2, Ricardo Mello Marinho1, Erica Becker Sousa Xavier1, Joao Pedro Junqueira Caetano1\n\n1 Clínica Huntington Pró-Criar - Belo Horizonte - MG - Brasil.\n\n2 Faculdade de Medicina UNIFENAS - Belo Horizonte - MG - Brasil.\n\nObjective: To demonstrate through numbers the main indications of surrogacy, multidisciplinary approach and the outcomes in the treatments of surrogacy.\n\nMethods: Retrospective analysis of the psychological follow-up of patients who sought an in vitro fertilization treatment with surrogacy, highlighting aspects related to medical indication, psychological assessment and ethics discussion.\n\nResults: A total of 88 patients had the indication of surrogate between April 2003 and April 2023 in a private reproductive medicine clinic in Belo Horizonte/Brazil. The average age of people who underwent treatment was 36 years. The main medical indications for surrogacy were following hysterectomized women for benign diseases in 24 cases (27.3%); serious medical conditions in 19 (21.6%); 16 (18.2%) homosexual patients; 2 (2.3%) single men; congenital absence of uterus in 11 cases (12.5%); cancer surgery in 8 patients (9%); recurrent miscarriage in 6 cases (6.8%) and repeated IVF failures in 2 cases (2.3%). 37 (42%) couples/patients underwent treatment, we had incomplete data from 9 (10,2%) patients, 4 patients (4.5%) underwent oocyte cryopreservation for future treatment and another 38 (43.3%) did not undergo treatments after the indication. Of the 37 (42%) couples/patients underwent treatment, 3 (8.1%) are pregnancy and 14 (37.8%) had a live birth;13 (35.2%) were negative results; 5 (13.5%) progressed to abortion and 2 (5.4%) had a canceled cycle. Of the 38 (43.3%) patients/couple did not undergo treatments after the indication, the main reasons were: 21 (55.3%) had a first medical and psychological evaluation, but chose not to undergo the treatment; 10 (26.3%) was considered unfit by the doctor; 4 (10.6%) were considered psychologically unfit; 1 (2.6%) gave up the treatment, due to the couple broke-up; 1 (2.6%) would have to use donated eggs with surrogacy and this was not authorized in CFM Resolution number 2.013/2013 and 1 (2.6%) was not authorized by the CRM/MG, as the patient was a single man and there was no inclusion of single people in chapter VII of Substitute gestation at CFM Resolution no. 2.121/2015. In these 20 years, we have offered systematic psychological listening - whether individual, couple or in groups - that allows us pay attention to the unique dimension of the experience of people who experience surrogacy treatment. Thus, we can evaluate and follow up the patient/genetic couple, as well as the surrogate and their family, to identify the affective bonds and possible psychological factors that may predispose to treatment, in addition to optimize the conditions of the family environment that will receive the unborn child. In Brazil, the CFM, in its resolution no. 2.320/2022, determines that the patient's medical record must contain a medical report, with a psychological profile, attesting the clinical and emotional adequacy of all those involved, and this has been the practice at our clinic since the first case of surrogacy in 2003.\n\nConclusion: The surrogacy is an alternative treatment that gives patients, unable to conceive, a chance to get a biological child, on the condition that everyone involved in the process must be well evaluated from a medical, psychological and ethical point of view.\n\nP-27. Female throuple seeking Assisted Reproduction Treatment: Report of desires and reproductive possibilities\n\nCassia Cançado Avelar1, Leci Veiga Caetano Amorim1, Cristiane Araujo Oliveira1, Ana Luisa Mendes Campos1, Laura Maria Almeida Maia1, Ricardo Mello Marinho1, Erica Becker Sousa Xavier1, Joao Pedro Junqueira Caetano1\n\n1Clinica Huntington Pró-Criar - Belo Horizonte - MG - Brasil).\n\nObjective: To evaluate desires and possibilities of an assisted reproduction treatment in a female throuple relationship, highlighting aspects related to medical indication, psychological assessment and ethics discussion.\n\nMethods: Follow up Female throuple (3 women), who looked for treatment in a private reproductive medicine clinic in Belo Horizonte/Brazil, in January 2023.\n\nResults: Case report: Patient 1 (39 years) and patient 2 (38 years) - stable union for 10 years and intended to have children. Patient 3 (34 years old), had heterosexual; transgender and homoaffective relationships. In 2019, patient 3 met patient 1. Later, patient 3 met patient 2 - they had a great identification and began a throuple relationship. They sought the clinic for treatment. After a favorable medical evaluation, the throuple had a psychological evaluation, with individual and group consultation, where they could talk about their desires and treatment possibilities. The case was presented to the Ethics Committee of the clinic (composed by physicians, psychology, nurse and embryologist). Considering the determination of Federal Council of Medicine (CFM) Resolution No. 2.320/2022, that all capable person who have requested the procedure and whose indication does not deviate from the limits of this resolution, may be recipients of assisted reproduction techniques; and in the event of embryos formed from different donors, embryo transfer should be performed with embryos of a single origin for the safety of offspring and traceability, the Ethics Committee determined that there was no contraindication for the treatment involving the throuple. In the psychological sessions, they expressed their desires and expectations regarding the treatment and with the medical advice, they decided by an in vitro fertilization with heterologous semen, using the oocyte of the three, but patient 2 does not want pregnancy.\n\nConclusion: New family arrangements represent a challenge for assisted reproduction treatments. It is necessary a good listening by the multidisciplinary team and adequate guidance on the available treatments, respecting the norms in the Resolution of the Federal Council of Medicine (CFM).\n\nP-28. Comparative report of psychological care of two cases of transgender men undergoing assisted reproductive techniques\n\nCassia Cançado Avelar1, Leci Veiga Caetano Amorim1, Laura Maria Almeida Maia1, Ricardo Mello Marinho1, Erica Becker Sousa Xavier1, Joao Pedro Junqueira Caetano1\n\n1 Clínica Huntington Pró-Criar - Belo Horizonte - MG - Brasil.\n\nObjective: To evaluate the history and experiences of two cases of transgender men in an assisted reproduction treatment.\n\nMethods: Psychological follow up two couples, with transgender men married with cisgender women, who sought treatment at a private reproductive medicine clinic in Belo Horizonte/Brazil, in January 2021.\n\nResults: Cases report:First case: Transgender man (34 years) in a relationship with a cisgender woman (36years). She looked for a treatment in 2020, when single, and she was diagnosed with low ovarian reserve. She reported her anguish at this diagnosis, so she did not do the treatment. After that, she met an old friend (a transgender man) and they had been together ever since. He started the reassignment process seven years ago and he has been using testosterone since then. He underwent a mastectomy and was preparing to have his uterus and ovaries removed, when the Covid pandemic came and he had to postpone the surgical procedure. He spoke about his desire to have children, but that it was not in their plans to carry out the treatment, which changed given the situation of his partner. In 2021, they did a treatment with ovulatory induction on him. He said that the treatment was intense, as he had to stop testosterone and use female hormones, which brought intense symptoms. He was very irritated; in addition, it greatly affected his physical strength, which reflected in his work. He had two blastocysts and they had two transfers into his wife’s uterus, with an anembryonic pregnancy and another a negative result. They decided not to continue the treatment, as he revealed was not willing to undergo hormone treatment again. Second case: Transgender man (37 years) married a cisgender woman (43 years) with altered karyotype and low ovarian reserve. She did treatment when single with donor semen with anembryonic pregnancy and negative result. She returned in 2021, in a relationship with a transgender man. He transitioned eight years ago, but ever had a strong desire to be a father. He did intend to remove the uterus, tubes and ovaries, but first he was willing to perform the ovulation induction treatment. He did need double stimulation and said that the use of the hormone was less impactful than he had imagined and his desire to have a child was bigger than that. He had an embryo transferred to his wife with a positive result. The couple's daughter was born in 2022. The question in this case was she has not told anyone that he is a transgender man and they are in therapy.\n\nConclusion: The psychological approach in these cases was before starting treatment, with follow-up during the treatment and all the implications of the technical demand on the transgender patient's body and emotion and follow-up after the result - grieving the negative outcome and decisions about the way forward and the experience of pregnancy and childbirth. This made it possible to provide the necessary support in view of the psycho-emotional demands of each couple.\n\nP-29. Effect of body mass index on blastocyst morphokinetics in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS): a time-lapse analysis of embryos obtained after progestin primed ovarian stimulation cycles\n\nLuciana Campomizzi Calazans1, Camila Cruz Moraes1, Leci Caetano Amorim1, Ana Luisa Menezes Campos1, Erica Becker Souza Xavier1, Ricardo Melo Marinho1, João Pedro Junqueira Caetano1\n\n1 Huntington Pró-Criar - Belo Horizonte - MG - Brasil.\n\nObjective: To demonstrate if there are differences in blastocyst morphokinetics between normal weight and overweight/obese women with PCOS after controlled ovary hyperstimulation with progestin primed ovarian stimulation (PPOS) protocol.\n\nMethods: PCOS is a common endocrine disorder associated with overweight and obesity in women of reproductive age. An increasing number of PCOS women are seeking for assisted reproduction techniques (ART) and the impact of overweight and obesity on the reproductive outcome of PCOS women who undergo IVF/ICSI have yielded conflicting results. PCOS obese women require higher doses of gonadotropin for a longer duration to achieve ovarian hyperstimulation, and overweight and obesity are associated with higher miscarriage rate in IVF/ICSI patients. However, the effect of overweight and obesity in PCOS on the morphokinetics parameters of blastocysts is yet to be determined. This was a retrospective cohort study on blastocyst morphokinetics from February/2021 and January/2022, in a single ART center. One-hundred twenty-three blastocysts from 24 PCOS patients submitted to PPOS protocol were included and classified into three groups: normal weight (n=86), overweight (n=20) and obese (n=17), according to the World Health Organization (WHO) classification. There were no underweight women in this cohort. Embryos from patients with endometriosis, previous ovarian surgery diabetes, autoimmune diseases and male factor were excluded from this analysis. Embryos were cultured in Embryoscope Plus incubator and classified according to KIDScore (Vitrolife) morphokinetic-based algorithm in good (7.0-9.9), fair (4.0-6.9) and poor quality (1.0-3.9). We performed two-by-two comparisons between the average scores obtained from the quality of the embryos fornormal x overweight; normal x obese; overweight x obese and normal x overweight + obese groups.\n\nResults: The normal and obese groups had a mean age statistically higher than the overweight group (36.7±4.0; 38.5±2.7 and 33.2±2.8 respectively, p<0.0001). The number of oocytes retrieved was significantly higher in the normal weight and overweight groups (20.0±7.3 and 22.3±8.1), when compared to the obese group (10.6±5.0, p<0.0001). As for the blastocyst formation rate, the normal and overweight groups had rates statistically higher than those in the obese group (0.6±0.2; 0.6±0.1 and 0.5±0.2, p=0.0114). The embryos generated by patients in the normal BMI group had a mean score of 6.3(±1.8); the overweight group had a mean score of 6.1(±1.9) and the obese group had a mean score of 7.0(±1.71). There was no significant difference in relation to the average quality score obtained between the three groups analyzed (p>0.05), according to the Tukey Test for multiple comparisons. In the analyzes two by two (normal x overweight; normal x obese; overweight x obese and normal x overweight + obese groups), there was also no statistical significance (p>0.05), according to the unpaired T test. Limitations, reasons for caution:\n\nWe found no relation between BMI and embryo morphokinetics scores, despite the obese group having higher mean age.\n\nConclusion: Many studies have shown a detrimental effect of obesity on IVF/ICSI and obstetrics outcomes in PCOS women, but a few have focused on the embryo quality. Our study found no relation between BMI and embryo morphokinetics scores in PCOS women who underwent PPOS IVF/ICSI cycles.\n\nP-30. Increased Anti-Mullerian Hormone secretion per antral follicle is linked to decreased ovarian response after controlled stimulation for IVF\n\nJoão Sabino Cunha-Filho1, Rita Chapon1, Vanessa Genro1, Rafaela Donato1, Camila Bessow1, Tatiane Souza1\n\n1 Insemine - POA - RS - Brasil.\n\nObjective: The main objective of this study is to investigate if the anti-Mullerian Hormone secretion per antral follicle is linked to ovarian response after controlled stimulation in infertile patients undergoing IVF.\n\nMethods: We did a retrospective study with 483 patients submitted to IVF with 24 - 45 years of age, during 2015-23. All of the studied patients presented both ovaries, with no morphological abnormalities (such as cysts, endometriomas, etc.), no history of past surgery and adequately visualised in transvaginal ultrasound scans; regular menstrual cycle lengths ranging between 25 and 35 days; no current or past diseases affecting ovaries or gonadotrophin or sex steroid secretion, clearance or excretion; no clinical signs of hyperandrogenism and BMI ranging from 16 to 30 kg/m2. The controlled ovarian stimulation protocol was initiated with recombinant FSH therapy, the individual dosage was according to the physician’s option and continued until the day of hCG administration. All included patients received GnRH antagonist (flexible protocol) and daily FSH doses were adjusted according to the number of growing follicles. Patients were divided into two groups according to the AMH/AFC ratio. Group 1 (n=359) 0.39 and group 2 (n=124) when this ratio reaches the 75th percentile (>0.39). The primary outcome was determined by the number of mature (MII) oocytes after pickup. p was considered significant when < 5%.\n\nResults: Groups were comparable in age (mean±SD) 35.6 ± 4 for group 1 and 35.1±5 for group 2, p=0.293. However, AMH (2.1±1.8 versus 7.6±2.8) and AFC (11±6 versus 9±5) were significantly different between both groups (p<0.05). Moreover, the group with a higher AMH secretion per AFC presented a lower number of collected oocytes (5±3 versus 4±2, p=0.003) and a decreased number of mature oocytes (4±3 versus 3±2) compared to the group with AMH per AFC less than 0.4, p<0.05. Considering the AMH secretion per AFC (higher than 0.39) and the individual chance to present, after controlled ovarian stimulation, less than 5 mature oocytes, the odds were 2.10, 95%CI(1.30-3.45) in this group of patients.\n\nConclusion: Anti-Mullerian Hormone is an essential tool for the ovarian response after gonadotropin administration. This hormone is largely used to predict and decrease the incidence of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome. However, this anti-gonadotrophic action could be detrimental when this secretion (per AFC) is above the 75th percentile cut-off.\n\nP-31. Endometriosis does not affect Antral follicle responsiveness to follicle stimulating hormone administration in patients undergoing to IVF\n\nJoão Sabino Cunha Filho1, Rita Chapon1, Rafaela Donato1, Tatiane Souza1, Camila Bessow1, Vanessa Genro1\n\n1 Insemine - POA - RS - Brasil.\n\nObjective: The main objective of this research is to investigate if the presence of endometriosis in patients undergoing IVF affects the Antral Follicle responsiveness to exogenous gonadotropins for controlled ovarian stimulation.\n\nMethods: We retrospectively studied 806 patients submitted to IVF with 24 - 45 years of age, during 2015-22. All of the studied patients met the following inclusion criteria: (i) both ovaries present, with no morphological abnormalities (such as cysts, endometriomas, etc.), no history of past surgery and adequately visualised in transvaginal ultrasound scans; (ii) regular menstrual cycle lengths ranging between 25 and 35 days; (iii) no current or past diseases affecting ovaries or gonadotrophin or sex steroid secretion, clearance or excretion; (iv) no clinical signs of hyperandrogenism; (v) BMI ranging from 16 to 30 kg/m2. Recombinant FSH therapy was then initiated, at an individual dosage according to the physician’s option and continued until the day of hCG administration. From the 6th day of recombinant FSH therapy onwards, daily FSH doses were adjusted according to the number of growing follicles and GnRH antagonist was administered. The main outcome was determined by the Follicular Output RaTe (FORT) that was calculated by the ratio between Peri-ovulatory Follicular Count on day-hCG × 100/Antral Follicular Count at baseline. We compared endometriosis x non-endometriosis patients in terms of baseline and some reproductive outcomes. p was considered significant when < 5%.\n\nResults: The mean age of the patients was (mean±SD) 35.1±4 for endometriosis and 35.3±5 for the control group, p=0.722. Moreover, AMH (3.88±3.4 versus 3.45±3.3), AFC (10±5 versus 11±6), and the number of mature oocytes (3.6±2 versus 3.9±3) were similar between both groups (p>0.05). Furthermore, the responsiveness to gonadotropin measured by FORT was also similar between endometriosis and non-endometriosis: 43% x 42.9%, p=0.957.\n\nConclusion: Endometriosis did not affect the follicular responsiveness to follicle-stimulating hormone during controlled ovarian stimulation for IVF. Moreover, some reproductive outcomes after COS were also similar between both groups.\n\nP-32. Endometriosis is associated to an increased serum progesterone level during late follicular phase in controlled ovarian stimulation for in vitro fertilization\n\nTatiane Oliveira de Souza1, Rita Chapon1, Rafaela Donatto1, Camila Bessow1, Vanessa Krebs Genro1, João Sabino Cunha Filho1\n\n1 Centro Reprodução Humana Insemine - Porto Alegre - RS - Brasil.\n\nObjective: To investigate the serum progesterone, LH and estradiol levels during late follicular phase in infertile patients with endometriosis submitted to controlled ovarian stimulation for IVF.\n\nMethods: We prospectively studied 102 infertile patients undergoing the first IVF cycle using the same controlled ovarian stimulation protocol (hMG + GnRH antagonist), during 2021-22. All of the studied patients met the following inclusion criteria: (i) both ovaries present, with no morphological abnormalities (such as cysts, endometriomas, etc.), no history of past surgery and adequately visualised in transvaginal ultrasound scans; (ii) regular menstrual cycle lengths ranging between 25 and 35 days; (iii) no current or past diseases affecting ovaries or gonadotrophin or sex steroid secretion, clearance or excretion; (iv) no clinical signs of hyperandrogenism; (v) BMI ranging from 16 to 30 kg/m2. Patients were divided into two groups. Study group: peritoneal endometriosis diagnosticated using laparoscopy, n=27 and control group: tubal or masculine infertility etiology, n=72.Progesterone, estradiol and LH were collected on hcg-day and analyzed using chemiluminescence immunoassay. We also compared some important reproductive outcomes. Our data were analyzed using parametric and non-parametric correlation tests and multivariable analysis (Linear regression). P was considered significant when < 5%.\n\nResults: Mean age (35.4±4 x 35.7±4), Antral Follicle Count (10±5 x 8.5±5), AMH (2.33±1.9 x 2.33±2.3), number of MII oocytes (6±4 x 6±5) and number of embryos (5±1 x 5±1) were not different between control and endometriosis groups, respectively (P>0.05). Furthermore, serum estradiol (2743±222 x 3046±278) and LH (2.54±3 x 2.53±4) levels did not differ also. However, serum progesterone levels on the HCG-day were increased in endometriosis patients compared to controls (1.12±0.6 x 0.87±0.5, P=0.026). Using the cutoff of serum progesterone above 1.5 ng/ml to freeze embryos and transfer in another cycle, 50% of endometriosis patients reached that criterion versus 33% of the control group (P=0.09).\n\nConclusion: Patients with endometriosis demonstrated a granulosa cell secretion of progesterone after controlled ovarian stimulation for IVF different if compared to tubal or male fector. Those endometriotic patients are at risk of premature progesterone increase during the late follicular phase and need to be closely monitored.\n\nP-33. Incubation time to ICSI does not affect laboratory results\n\nBruna Campos Galgaro1, Luiza da Silva Rodrigues1, Lisiane Knob de Souza1, João Sabino Lahorgue Cunha-Filho1\n\n1 Insemine - Porto Alegre - RS - Brasil.\n\nObjective: To evaluate whether incubation time from oocyte collection to ICSI fertilization affects laboratory results.\n\nMethods: A retrospective study which included all fresh ICSI cycles from January to June 2023. The fertilization procedure was performed between three to six hours after ovarian aspiration (i.e. 39 to 42 hours after hCG trigger). Cycles were divided in two groups according to the incubation period until ICSI: group 1 [≤ 4 hours (or 180-240 minutes)] and group 2 [>4 hours (or 241-360 minutes)]. Age of patients, AMH (ng/mL) and the number of oocytes retrieved were assessed. The primary laboratory outcome compared was good quality blastocyst rate, and the secondary were: fertilization rate, good quality cleavage embryo rate, and blastulation rate. Statistical analysis was conducted by paired test and results, expressed as mean ± standard deviation, were considered significant if p<0.05.\n\nResults: There were 96 ICSI cycles included, 77 of which were performed up to 4 hours and 19 after 4 hours of oocyte collection. The average time to ICSI was 215 (minimum 180 and maximum 348 minutes). The mean age of patients [36.13 ± 4.48 vs 35.94 ± 4.80 (p=0.876)], AMH [2.72 ± 2.71 vs 2.47 ± 1.97 (p=0.707)] and number of oocytes retrieved [8.82 ± 6.33 vs 10.58 ± 13.06 (p=0.396)] were not significantly different for groups 1 and 2 respectively. Moreover, no statistical difference were observed in relation to all laboratory results evaluated between groups: good quality blastocyst rate [40.0% ± 0.33 vs 31.4% ± 0.36 (p=0.439)], fertilization rate [83.9% ± 0.23 vs 86.5% ± 0.16 (p=0.639)], good quality cleavage embryo rate [53.3% ± 0.30 vs 52.4% ± 0.28 (p=0.912)] and blastulation rate [55.2% ± 0.27 vs 60.9% ± 0.35 (p=0.548)].\n\nConclusion: IVF laboratory results are not affected by the incubation time to ICSI. Therefore, embryologists can perform the fertilization safely from three to six hours after ovarian aspiration.\n\nP-34. Does the air temperature of IVF laboratory affect good quality blastocyst rate?\n\nBruna Campos Galgaro1, Luiza da Silva Rodrigues1, Lisiane Knob de Souza1, João Sabino Lahorgue Cunha-Filho1\n\n1 Insemine - POA - RS - Brasil.\n\nObjective: To evaluate the influence of IVF laboratory air temperature at the time of ICSI on embryo culture.\n\nMethods: Retrospective study including all fresh ICSI cycles from January to June 2023. The temperature of the IVF laboratory was measured with a thermometer at the time of ICSI and the cycles were splitted in two temperature range groups: control (22-25.9ºC) and study (<22ºC or ≥26ºC). Mean age of patients, AMH (ng/mL) and the number of oocytes retrieved were assessed. The primary "
