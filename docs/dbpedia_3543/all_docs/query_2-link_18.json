        "text": "Rulers\n\nIndex Pi-Py\n\nPianna, Oswaldo, Filho (b. Feb. 27, 1949, Porto Velho, Guaporé [now Rondônia], Brazil), governor of Rondônia (1991-95).\n\nPiasi, Jackson (b. 1955), justice and legal affairs minister of Solomon Islands (1994). He was also minister of lands and housing (1997-2000).\n\nPiatkowski, Jan (b. Oct. 4, 1935, Gnieszowice, Poland - d. July 22, 2016), justice minister and prosecutor-general of Poland (1993).\n\nPiazza Tangüis, Walter (b. Feb. 22, 1924, Lima, Peru - d. May 7, 2015), economy and finance minister of Peru (1977).\n\nPibulsongkram, Nitya (b. June 30, 1941, Bangkok, Thailand - d. May 24, 2014, Bangkok), foreign minister of Thailand (2006-08). He was also ambassador to the United States (1996-2000).\n\nP. Pibulsongkram\n\nPibulsongkram, (Luang) Plaek, also spelled Pibulsonggram, Phibunsongkhram, etc., original name Plaek Khittasangkha (b. July 14, 1897, Nonthaburi province, near Bangkok, Siam [now Thailand] - d. June 11, 1964, Tokyo, Japan), prime minister (1938-44, 1948-57), foreign minister (1939-41, 1941-42, 1949), defense minister (1934-41, 1941-43, 1949-57), interior minister (1938-41, 1948-49, 1955-57), and finance minister (1949-50) of Thailand. While taking advanced military training in France (1924-27), he became involved with Thai students who were plotting to overthrow the absolute monarchy. He took the name Pibulsongkram (\"ready for war\") and in 1928 he received the title Luang. He took a leading part in the bloodless revolution of 1932 which obliged King Prajadhipok to grant a constitution, and subsequently he and his civilian associate Pridi Banomyong wielded the power behind the throne. He came to public prominence by suppressing the 1933 royalist insurrection of Prince Boworadet. As defense minister he worked to popularize military values in the fashion of Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany. After becoming premier in 1938, he changed the name of the country from Siam to Thailand in 1939 and espoused ultranationalist and irredentist views. With the rank of field marshal, he fought a Japanese attack on Dec. 8, 1941, but soon concluded an alliance with Japan, declaring war on the United States and Britain on Jan. 25, 1942. Increasing dissatisfaction with his cultural reforms forced him to resign in 1944 and a civilian government took power. But the army seized the government in 1947, and he resumed the premiership in 1948, winning the support of the West by his efforts to contain the spread of Communism in Thailand. In 1957 he was ousted by disgruntled military colleagues. Thereafter he lived in retirement in Japan.\n\nPicado Michalski, Teodoro (b. Jan. 10, 1900, San José, Costa Rica - d. June 1, 1960, Managua, Nicaragua), president of Costa Rica (1944-48). He was also minister of education (1932-36) and president of Congress (1941-44).\n\nPicanon, Édouard (b. Sept. 2, 1854, Chemilly, Allier, France - d. June 27, 1939), lieutenant governor of Cochinchina (1898-1901) and governor of New Caledonia (1902-05) and French Guiana (1906-07).\n\nPicard, (Louis Joseph) Ernest (b. Dec. 24, 1821, Paris, France - d. May 13, 1877, Paris), finance minister (1870-71) and interior minister (1871) of France. He was also minister to Belgium (1871-73).\n\nPicardo\n\nPicardo, Fabian (Raymond) (b. Feb. 18, 1972, Gibraltar), chief minister of Gibraltar (2011- ).\n\nPiccioni, Attilio (b.

Nov. 8, 1962, Monaco), Monegasque diplomat. She has been permanent representative to the United Nations (2009- ).\n\nPiccoli\n\nPiccoli, Flaminio (b. Dec. 28, 1915, Kirchbichl, Austria - d. April 11, 2000, Rome, Italy), Italian politician. He became an officer in one of Italy's Alpine regiments and saw action in World War II in Albania and Greece. Captured by the Nazis after Italy's capitulation in 1943, he escaped and was taken prisoner by the Germans but escaped again from a train deporting him to Poland and made his way back to Italy. Once described as \"the most Christian Democrat of Christian Democrats,\" Piccoli took over as party president in July 1978 when the party was reeling from the murder by Red Brigades terrorists of former prime minister Aldo Moro. He also held the post of party secretary (1969, 1980-82) during a political career spanning 40 years and was three times Italian minister for state participation in industry in the 1970s. He remained active in politics until his death and was still president of the Christian Democratic Party, which emerged from the wreckage of the Democrazia Cristiana (DC) when it collapsed in 1992 under the weight of corruption scandals. He never succeeded in his ambition to become prime minister. He was once derided by Moro, one of his many opponents within the DC, as \"a mixture of abnegation and opportunism.\"\n\nPicek\n\nPicek, Vlastimil (b.

He entered political life as a Democrat, serving in the New Hampshire legislature (1829-33), the U.S. House of Representatives (1833-37), and the Senate (1837-42). Except for a brief stint as an officer in the Mexican War (1846-48), he remained out of the public eye until the Democratic convention of 1852, when he was nominated for president as a \"dark horse\" after the leading candidates, Lewis Cass, Stephen A. Douglas, and James Buchanan, were deadlocked. The ensuing presidential campaign was dominated by controversy over the slavery issue. Both the Democrats and the Whigs were too badly split internally to stake out strong stands on the issue; the chief question was the finality of the Compromise of 1850, and while both parties declared themselves in favour of it, the Democrats were more thoroughly united in its support. As a result, Pierce, though almost unknown nationally, won the November election, defeating Whig candidate Winfield Scott by 254 to 42 in the electoral college. He then tried to promote sectional unity by naming people from both sides of the slavery debate to his cabinet. He also sidestepped the domestic antagonisms by aggressively promoting the extension of U.S. territorial and commercial interests abroad. An attempt to buy Cuba from Spain failed, but almost 78,000 sq km of territory were acquired from Mexico (Gadsden Purchase, 1853) for $10,000,000. In 1854 he signed the Kansas-Nebraska Act, by which the settlers of those territories were to decide by themselves whether to permit slavery. It led to a wild rush of pro- and anti-slavery adherents into Kansas, where they began a civil war. Denied renomination by the Democrats, he retired from public life in 1857.\n\nPierce, Gilbert A(shville) (b. Jan. 11, 1839, East Otto, N.Y. - d.

Dec. 5, 1867, Zulów, Russia [now Zalavas, Lithuania] - d. May 12, 1935, Warsaw, Poland), Polish statesman. Arrested on a false charge of plotting the assassination of Emperor Aleksandr III, he was banished to eastern Siberia in 1887-92; after his return, he joined the Polish Socialist Party and edited an underground newspaper. He was again arrested in 1900 but feigned insanity to secure his transfer to a military hospital, from which he escaped in 1901. In World War I, Germany and Austria-Hungary proclaimed the independence of Poland, and he was appointed head of the military department of the newly created Polish Council of State. But he refused to comply with German demands that Polish units should swear \"fidelity in arms with the German and Austrian forces,\" and was arrested in July 1917. Released after the German collapse, he arrived in Warsaw on Nov. 10, 1918, and four days later was head of state and commander in chief of the Polish army. In the Russo-Polish war of 1919-20, he led the Polish forces far to the east into historic Polish lands. A counteroffensive by the Red Army forced the Poles to retreat, but Pilsudski, made marshal of Poland on March 19, 1920, won the culminating battle in August that brought victory to Poland. He remained head of state until the adoption of a new constitution and a general election in 1922; he refused to stand for the presidency. Becoming disillusioned with the parliamentary system, he led a coup with the aid of the army on May 12, 1926. On May 15 he became defense minister, a post he held until his death. The parliament elected him president on May 31, but he refused the office again. In October he accepted the premiership, which he held until 1928 and again in 1930. Regardless of his official posts he was the major influence behind the scenes, controlling foreign affairs in particular.\n\nPimen I, secular name Sergey (Mikhailovich) Izvekov (b.

He earned the Croix de Guerre for heroism during World War I and began his career in politics in 1929, when he was elected mayor of Saint-Chamond, a position he held until he retired in 1977. He was a deputy in 1936-38 and a senator in 1938-40. He supported Marshal Philippe Pétain in 1940 but later joined the resistance. In 1946 he was again elected to the National Assembly, where he served as leader of the Independents in 1956-58. He was secretary of state for economic affairs (1948-49) and minister of public works, transportation, and tourism (1950-52) before becoming premier and finance minister (1952-53), in which post he introduced successful austerity measures and issued the \"emprunt Pinay,\" a bond that allowed citizens to convert gold and cash hidden during the war into legal, tax-exempt savings. He adamantly pursued an anti-inflationary policy, a stance that was unpopular among economists of his day. He resigned after losing his parliamentary majority, but returned to the cabinet as foreign minister in 1955-56. In 1958 he helped bring Charles de Gaulle back to power and was given the finance portfolio again. He pursued a policy of limiting inflation even if it meant curtailing industrial expansion. He introduced a new franc, deflating the standard franc by removing the last two zeroes, a monumental deed for which he earned the moniker \"the man who saved the franc.\" After a disagreement with de Gaulle, he left the government in 1960. He was president of regional economic development for Rhône-Alpes in 1964-73 and was then named France's first ombudsman (1973-74).

Feb. 25, 1746, Charles Town [now Charleston], South Carolina [now in U.S.] - d. Aug. 16, 1825, Charleston), U.S. statesman. Becoming a member of the South Carolina Assembly in 1769, he served in the first South Carolina Provincial Congress in 1775, on the Council of Safety, as chairman of the committee that drafted the plan of government for the colony, and later in both houses of the state legislature. During the war of independence he was an aide to Gen. George Washington (1777) at Brandywine and Germantown, Pa., and later commanded a regiment at Savannah, Ga.; he was taken prisoner in 1780 at the fall of Charles Town, exchanged in 1782, and promoted to brigadier general in 1783. In the Constitutional Convention of 1787, where he served along with his cousin Charles Pinckney (1757-1824), he opposed religious tests for office, suggested 1808 as the date to end the slave trade, and favoured Senate ratification of treaties as a check on the executive. He accepted appointment as minister to France in 1796 but was refused recognition by the French Directory and left France for Amsterdam in 1797. He returned to Paris later that year on a mission (with John Marshall and Elbridge Gerry) to head off hostilities between the two countries. The mission failed when one of the group of French negotiators (later referred to in the correspondence as \"X, Y, and Z\"; hence, \"XYZ affair\") suggested that the U.S. representatives offer a gift and Pinckney is said to have replied, \"No! No! Not a sixpence!\" He returned home and was made a major general. In 1798, when war seemed likely, he accepted command of all forces in the South, but the crisis passed. He was an unsuccessful Federalist candidate for vice president in 1800 and for president in 1804 and 1808.\n\nT. Pinckney\n\nPinckney, Thomas (b. Oct. 23, 1750, Charles Town [now Charleston], South Carolina [now in U.S.] - d. Nov. 2, 1828, Charleston), U.S. politician; brother of Charles Cotesworth Pinckney. During the war of independence, he participated in the Florida campaign (1778) and the siege of Savannah (1779) and was captured at Camden (1780). After the war he turned to politics. As governor of South Carolina (1787-89), he helped restore order to the war-torn state and improved the lot of the Loyalists. He was president of the state convention that ratified the U.S. Constitution in 1788. As U.S. minister to Great Britain (1792-96) he failed to resolve Anglo-American differences, but as envoy extraordinary to Spain in 1795, he negotiated the Treaty of San Lorenzo, or Pinckney's Treaty (Oct. 27, 1795), by which the United States was granted navigation of the Mississippi River through Spanish territory for three years with a provision for renewal, and the boundary with Spanish Florida was fixed at the 31st parallel. He was the Federalist candidate for vice president in 1796 but was defeated when some Federalist electors voted against him. He was a member of the U.S. House of Representatives in 1797-1801 and a major general in the War of 1812.\n\nPind, Søren (b. Nov. 20, 1969, Herning, Denmark), justice minister of Denmark (2015-16).

Pindling\n\nPindling, Sir Lynden O(scar) (b. March 22, 1930, Nassau, Bahamas - d. Aug. 26, 2000, Nassau), premier (1967-69) and prime minister (1969-92) of The Bahamas. He helped found the Progressive Liberal Party in 1953 as a grassroots opposition to the mostly white, colonial-run United Bahamian Party. He became party treasurer and was chosen parliamentary leader soon after being elected to parliament in the 1956 elections. He became his party's first premier after the 1967 elections and formed an all-black government. Pindling, known as \"Black Moses,\" headed the government for 25 years, winning the elections of 1968, 1972, 1977, 1982, and 1987 and leading The Bahamas to independence from Britain in 1973. He was knighted in 1983. His policies helped create a large black middle class and widened educational opportunities. But The Bahamas also became a major drug trafficking haven in the late 1970s and 1980s, largely as the result of government inaction. A series of scandals in which Pindling was alleged to have covered for drug lords in the 1980s and taken bribes as chairman of the state-run Hotel Corporation clouded the country's relations with the United States and contributed to Pindling's defeat in the 1992 elections by Hubert Ingraham. In January 1997 a government commission investigating the Hotel Corporation condemned Pindling for accepting more than $750,000 in loans from Bahamas developers. The commission did not recommend further action. After his party won only 6 of the 40 seats in the National Assembly in the March 1997 elections, he agreed to step down to \"give the party a new face.\"\n\nM.

Under the terms of a new constitution that went into effect in March 1981, a plebiscite was held on Oct. 5, 1988, resulting in a \"no\" vote of 55% to a \"yes\" vote of 43% for his continuation as president.

Nov. 15, 1708, London, England - d. May 11, 1778, Hayes, Kent, England), British statesman; grandson of Thomas Pitt. In 1735 he entered Parliament, where he showed oratorical power and a readiness to appeal to public opinion, a novelty in English political life. In February 1746 he was appointed joint vice treasurer of Ireland, and two months later he became paymaster general of the forces. Because of his attacks on the Duke of Newcastle's ministry, he was dismissed from the pay office in 1755, but with the outbreak of the Seven Years' War the popular demand for Pitt became irresistible. In 1756 he formed a ministry with the Duke of Devonshire as its nominal head; in 1757 Newcastle returned to office on the understanding that he should control all the patronage while Pitt was responsible for the conduct of the war. His resolute and concerted policy led to a \"year of victories\" over France in 1759, notably in Canada. As a result of the war, Britain reigned supreme in North America and India and gained preeminence as an imperial power. But, before the war ended, Pitt had been forced to resign in 1761 when the new king, George III, and the cabinet objected to his plan to declare war on Spain. In 1766 the king asked him to form a ministry drawn from all sections of Parliament. His judgment and wisdom were impaired at this time and his ministry (in which he held the secondary post of lord privy seal, for which he was created Earl of Chatham) proved disastrous. From May 1767 until his formal resignation in October 1768, he withdrew completely, leaving the operations of government to others. His health subsequently improved again; in the House of Lords, he championed the cause of the American colonies, while opposing independence.\n\nPitt the Younger\n\nPitt, William, the Younger (b. May 28, 1759, Hayes, Kent, England - d. Jan. 23, 1806, London, England), British prime minister (1783-1801, 1804-06); son of William Pitt the Elder. In 1780, he failed to secure election to Parliament for Cambridge University, but in 1781 a patron provided him with a seat for Appleby in Westmorland. He made a successful maiden speech and displayed astonishing self-confidence. In 1782, he became chancellor of the exchequer under Lord Shelburne, and in December 1783, at age 24, King George III asked him to form a government. Many of the reforms he sought were frustrated by his lack of a strong political base in the Commons, but due to the support of the king he became the longest-serving British prime minister. He clung to neutrality in the French Revolutionary Wars as long as possible, but on Feb. 1, 1793, the French declared war on England, confident of victory after their successes against the Austro-Prussian forces and believing that England was ripe for revolution. Pitt's fiscal policies enabled the country to weather the long conflict with France. The French Revolution also had disastrous repercussions in Ireland, creating new hatreds to exacerbate the old religious feuds and a rebellion in 1798, convincing Pitt that a union of the two countries was necessary. This was realized, but Catholic emancipation was opposed by the king; Pitt resigned over the issue in 1801. He was reappointed in 1804. The Third Coalition against France, engineered by Pitt, collapsed after the battles of Ulm and Austerlitz, but Admiral Nelson's victory at Trafalgar in October 1805 ensured Britain's naval supremacy for the rest of the war. Pitt's health failed, and he died in office.\n\nPitta (de Castro), Laurindo (b. Nov. 22, 1854, São Fidélis, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil - d. Dec. 21, 1904, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil), president of Espírito Santo (1885).\n\nPittermann\n\nPittermann, Bruno (b. Sept. 3, 1905, Vienna, Austria - d. Sept. 19, 1983, Vienna), Austrian politician. He was first elected to parliament in 1945. When the Socialist leader Adolf Schärf became federal president in 1957, Pittermann succeeded him as party chairman and as vice chancellor. In 1966 the Conservatives won a majority in parliament, the Socialists were forced out of the coalition, and Pittermann lost his place in the government. In 1967 he was succeeded as party leader by Bruno Kreisky. He left parliament in 1971. From 1964 to 1976 he was president of the Socialist International. He was a staunch opponent of rightist dictatorships as well as Soviet-bloc Communist regimes.\n\nPittman, Vail (Montgomery) (b. Sept. 17, 1883, Vicksburg, Miss. - d. Jan. 29, 1964, Reno, Nev.), governor of Nevada (1945-51).\n\nPittner, Ladislav (b. May 18, 1934, Malacky, Czechoslovakia [now in Slovakia] - d. Aug. 15, 2008, Bratislava, Slovakia), interior minister of Slovakia (1990-92, 1994, 1998-2001).\n\nPius VI\n\nPius VI, original name Giovanni Angelo Braschi (b. Dec. 25, 1717, Cesena, Papal State [now in Italy] - d. Aug. 29, 1799, Valence, France), pope of the Roman Catholic Church (1775-99). He served in various administrative capacities in the church before being ordained priest in 1758. Appointed treasurer of the apostolic chamber by Pope Clemens XIII in 1766, he was made cardinal in 1773 by Pope Clemens XIV, after whose death a four-month conclave elected Braschi pope. The papacy at the time was almost completely bereft of power and influence due to the forces of the Enlightenment and nationalism. The Holy Roman emperor Joseph II applied Febronianism, an ecclesiastical doctrine that advocated restriction of papal power. A visit by Pius to Vienna in 1782 secured no concessions. The situation in France was equally overwhelming. The revolutionary government turned to the church's wealth, which it confiscated as a direct backing for its paper currency. In 1790 the French National Assembly passed the Civil Constitution of the Clergy, causing a major conflict between Rome and the Revolution. Pius explored possibilities of modifying the plan, but when an oath of fidelity to the new regime was demanded from the clergy, he formally denounced the Civil Constitution and the Revolution itself on March 10, 1791. The French church was completely split, half accepting, half defying the new regime. In 1796 the pope's territory was invaded by Napoléon Bonaparte. A peace treaty was signed at Tolentino on Feb. 19, 1797, by which the pope yielded five states of the church. A riot in Rome (December 1797), in which a French general was killed, led to French occupation of that city (Feb. 15, 1798) and the proclamation of a republic. In March 1799 he was seized by the French; he died a prisoner.\n\nPius VII\n\nPius VII, original name Giorgio Barnaba Niccolò Luigi Chiaramonti, in religion Gregorio Chiaramonti (b. Aug. 14, 1742, Cesena, Papal State [now in Italy] - d. Aug. 20, 1823, Rome, Papal State [now in Italy]), pope of the Roman Catholic Church (1800-23). He took his vows as a Benedictine at Cesena in 1758 (when he took the name Gregorio) and in 1785 was made bishop of Imola and cardinal by Pope Pius VI, who died in French captivity in 1799. Under Austrian protection at Venice, a conclave lasting 14 weeks elected Chiaramonti on March 14, 1800. Napoléon Bonaparte, the first consul of France, approached him about a settlement of the religious question in France, and the historic Concordat of 1801 provided for a complete reorganization of the dioceses and declared Roman Catholicism France's chief religion. Pius renounced the ecclesiastical property that had been secularized; on the other hand the church hierarchy was to be salaried by the French state. In 1804 he agreed to come to Paris to consecrate Napoléon emperor, but he failed in his effort to get a modification of the \"organic articles,\" appended to the Concordat by a French unilateral action in 1802, which forbade the exercise of any papal jurisdiction in France without the permission of the government. Relations deteriorated, and Rome was occupied by French troops in 1808, followed by Napoléon's annexation of the Papal State to France (1809). After Pius excommunicated the invaders on June 10, 1809, he was taken prisoner in July, remaining in exile until the defeat of Napoléon in 1814. The Congress of Vienna (1814-15) restituted nearly all of the Papal State, including Rome, to the papacy. Disavowing his earlier liberal leanings, he then sought to reestablish the church on its old foundations.\n\nPius VIII\n\nPius VIII, original name Francesco Saverio Castiglioni (b. Nov. 20, 1761, Cingoli, Papal State [now in Italy] - d. Nov. 30, 1830, Rome, Papal State [now in Italy]), pope of the Roman Catholic Church (1829-30). He studied canon law, was ordained in 1785, and became vicar-general at Anagni and later at Fano. Made bishop of Montalto in 1800, he was imprisoned in 1808 during the French domination of Italy for refusing to take the oath of allegiance to Napoléon. In 1816 he was made bishop of Cesena and cardinal. Appointed grand penitentiary, a leading role in the Curia, he was made bishop of Frascati in 1821; later that year he became prefect of the Congregation of the Index. At the conclave of 1823 he was already a candidate, but was considered too moderate. Despite his poor health, Castiglioni, the candidate of France, was elected Pope Leo XII's successor on March 31, 1829, and was crowned on April 5. He was generally broad-minded and conciliatory. Although the July Revolution (1830) in France was anticlerical in spirit, Pius encouraged French ecclesiastics to support the new king, Louis-Philippe. At the beginning of his pontificate the Catholic Emancipation Bill, which made it possible for Catholics to sit in Parliament and to hold public offices, was passed in England. On the other hand, the situation of the Catholics in the new Rhineland possessions of Protestant Prussia caused some concern; he allowed priests to assist passively at mixed marriages in which promises of Catholic education of the children had not been given, a concession that did not satisfy Prussia.\n\nPius IX\n\nPius IX, original name Giovanni Maria Giambattista Pietro Pellegrino Isidoro, conte Mastai-Ferretti (b. May 13, 1792, Senigallia, Papal State [now in Italy] - d. Feb. 7, 1878, Rome, Italy), pope of the Roman Catholic Church (1846-78). Ordained in 1819, he became archbishop of Spoleto in 1827, bishop of Imola in 1832, and cardinal in 1840. He was not the most prominent liberal candidate likely to succeed Gregorius XVI in 1846, but it took the conclave only two days to determine his election and so prevent that of the conservative Luigi Lambruschini. However, in 1848, the year of revolutions, he was faced with demands much beyond what he had been prepared to grant. Having granted a constitution for Rome in March 1848, a radical ministry was appointed in November; when the Swiss Guards were disbanded the pope was a virtual prisoner. On November 24-25, he fled to Gaeta in the kingdom of Naples. A new constituent assembly on Feb. 9, 1849, declared the temporal power at an end and a democratic republic to be established. The papacy thereupon appealed to the rulers of France, Austria, Spain, and Naples for assistance. This resulted in the restoration of papal rule, and he returned on April 12, 1850, repudiating his former liberalism. Notable events of his reign (the longest in history) included the declaration of the dogma of the Immaculate Conception (1854) and the first Vatican Council (1869-70), during which the doctrine of papal infallibility was defined. On Sept. 20, 1870, Italian troops occupied Rome, and in October a plebiscite was held in which an overwhelming majority voted for the incorporation of Rome in the kingdom of Italy. He refused to recognize this and for the rest of his days regarded himself a prisoner in the Vatican. His beatification in 2000 was controversial because of his alleged anti-Semitism.\n\nPius X\n\nPius X, Saint, original name Giuseppe Melchiorre Sarto (b. June 2, 1835, Riese, Venetia [now in Italy] - d. Aug. 20, 1914, Rome, Italy), pope of the Roman Catholic Church (1903-14). Ordained in 1858, he acted as parish priest at various places in Venetia until his appointment in 1875 as canon of the cathedral and superior of the episcopal seminary at Treviso. Pope Leo XIII made him bishop of Mantua in 1884 and cardinal and patriarch of Venice in 1893. Elected pope in succession to Leo, he had little interest in the latter's social reforms, laying his emphasis rather upon the spiritual work of the church. In 1910, he ordered that all teachers in seminaries and clerics before ordination take an oath denouncing Modernism, a contemporary intellectual movement seeking to employ secular disciplines to reinterpret traditional Catholic teaching; he had earlier condemned Modernism in the encyclical Pascendi dominici gregis (1907). He ceased to pursue actively the quarrel with the Italian government and allowed individual Catholics to enter Italian politics. He opposed Christian social movements independent of the church hierarchy. On his accession, there was already a growing anticlericalism in France, and in 1905 the French formally separated church from state, an act he condemned on Feb. 11, 1906. He issued decrees easing the regulations governing daily communion and reformed the liturgy, reviving Gregorian plainsong and recasting the breviary and the missal. A revision of canon law was begun in 1904 and brought to virtual completion shortly before his death. He also strengthened the church's central administration by the apostolic constitution Sapienti consilio (1908). He was beatified on June 3, 1951, and canonized May 29, 1954.\n\nPius XI\n\nPius XI, original name Ambrogio Damiano Achille Ratti (b. May 31, 1857, Desio, Lombardy [now in Italy] - d. Feb. 10, 1939, Vatican City), pope of the Roman Catholic Church (1922-39). Ordained in 1879, he became prefect of the Vatican Library in 1914, nuncio to Poland in 1919, archbishop of Milan and cardinal in 1921, and was elected to the papacy on Feb. 6, 1922. Soon Benito Mussolini came to power in Italy, with whom he signed (Feb. 11, 1929) the Lateran Treaty that allowed the existence of the independent Vatican City state ruled by the pope, with the papacy in turn recognizing the kingdom of Italy and its lawful rule of Rome and announcing permanent neutrality in military and diplomatic conflicts of the world. At the same time, a concordat established the validity of church marriage in Italy, provided compulsory religious instruction for Catholic schoolchildren, and declared Roman Catholicism to be Italy's state religion. He also concluded concordats that strengthened Catholicism in other European countries, including Latvia (1922), Poland (1925), Romania and Lithuania (1927), Prussia (1929), and Austria and Germany (1933). He wrote several protests against the Third Reich in 1933-36, as well as the encyclical Mit brennender Sorge (1937), and denounced the introduction of Nazi racial attitudes into Italy in 1938. He also spoke out against atheistic Communism and against persecution of Catholics in Mexico and Spain. He required every religious order to engage actively in overseas missionary work, with the result that the number of missionaries doubled during his pontificate. In 1926 he consecrated the first Chinese bishops. In his encyclical Quadragesimo anno (1931), he elaborated the theses of Leo XIII's Rerum novarum on social and economic matters.\n\nPius XII\n\nPius XII, original name Eugenio Maria Giuseppe Giovanni Pacelli (b. March 2, 1876, Rome, Italy - d. Oct. 9, 1958, Castel Gandolfo, near Rome), pope of the Roman Catholic Church (1939-58). He was ordained in 1899 and passed into the Vatican Secretariat of State in 1901; in 1911 he became a monsignor and in 1917 he was made archbishop and sent as nuncio to Bavaria to negotiate a concordat. In 1920 he was appointed nuncio to the German republic with the same aim; his discussions with the Berlin government failed, but he signed agreements with Bavaria in 1924 and Prussia in 1929. He was named cardinal in 1929 and became secretary of state in 1930 and additionally camerlengo (chamberlain) in 1935. After 9 years as secretary of state, during which he travelled on papal missions to North and South America and to France, he was elected pope in the shortest conclave since 1623. During the few months between his election and the outbreak of World War II, he turned his diplomatic gifts to preventing the catastrophe, but not in the spirit of appeasement - the Vatican had disliked the Munich Agreement (1938), by which Czechoslovakia was sacrificed to expanding German power by Britain and France. Pius especially strove to keep Italy neutral and was deeply saddened when he failed. In a notable series of Christmas broadcasts (1939-48), he looked firmly toward the postwar future and to the opportunities it would offer for a new order in which the international community would be given real expression, replacing the egoistic nationalism that had bred war. Regarding his conduct in relation to the war itself, he has been charged with neglecting, in the interests of a calculated neutrality, to raise an authoritative voice in defense of the persecuted, Christian or Jewish. In 1946 he enacted severe measures against Catholics collaborating with Communists.\n\nPivic, Nezir (b.

In 1941 she joined the Communist Youth Union of Yugoslavia, and in 1943 she was accepted as a soldier of the Yugoslav Liberation Army. After the war she joined the Yugoslav Communist Party (in 1952 renamed League of Communists). In 1963 she became secretary for education and science of the republic of Croatia. She established her political reputation as a loyal supporter of Tito, whom she helped to overcome the outbreak of Croatian nationalism in 1971. A member of the Central Committee of the Croatian branch of the League of Communists since 1959, she became its chairman in 1971 and also a member of the federal Executive Committee. She became Eastern Europe's first woman head of government when she was appointed president of the Federal Executive Council for a four-year term in 1982. Because of the active role she played in Croatia, she had the reputation of being something of an \"iron lady.\" Once in office, she acted to increase the federal government's effectiveness in combating Yugoslavia's mounting economic problems. Among these were an inflation rate of approximately 30%, a per capita foreign indebtedness greater than that of Poland, and an unemployment rate exceeding 13% of the work force. Her measures included the introduction of a greater number of technocrats, particularly economists, into the new government; the raising of the price of gasoline, for the third time in a year, to the highest in Europe; and a price freeze affecting all goods and services apart from privately grown fruit and vegetables. However, the situation remained unfavourable at the end of her term, with an inflation rate of over 80%.\n\nPlant, George (b.
