F.; Li, M.; Luo, X.; Wang, Y. F.; Yu, Q. F.; Hassanien, R. H. E.\n\n2016-08-01\n\nThe static ice refrigeration air conditioning system (SIRACS) driven by distributed photovoltaic energy system (DPES) was proposed and the test experiment have been investigated in this paper. Results revealed that system energy utilization efficiency is low because energy losses were high in ice making process of ice slide maker. So the immersed evaporator and co-integrated exchanger were suggested in system structure optimization analysis and the system COP was improved nearly 40%. At the same time, we have researched that ice thickness and ice super-cooled temperature changed along with time and the relationship between system COP and ice thickness was obtained.\n\nPotential Evaluation of Solar Heat Assisted Desiccant Hybrid Air Conditioning System\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nTran, Thien Nha; Hamamoto, Yoshinori; Akisawa, Atsushi; Kashiwagi, Takao\n\nThe solar thermal driven desiccant dehumidification-absorption cooling hybrid system has superior advantage in hot-humid climate regions. The reasonable air processing of desiccant hybrid air conditioning system and the utility of clean and free energy make the system environment friendly and energy efficient. The study investigates the performance of the desiccant dehumidification air conditioning systems with solar thermal assistant. The investigation is performed for three cases which are combinations of solar thermal and absorption cooling systems with different heat supply temperature levels. Two solar thermal systems are used in the study: the flat plate collector (FPC) and the vacuum tube with compound parabolic concentrator (CPC). The single-effect and high energy efficient double-, triple-effect LiBr-water absorption cooling cycles are considered for cooling systems. COP of desiccant hybrid air conditioning systems are determined. The evaluation of these systems is subsequently performed. The single effect absorption cooling cycle combined with the flat plate collector solar system is found to be the most energy efficient air conditioning system.\n\nStudy toward high-performance thermally driven air-conditioning systems\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMiyazaki, Takahiko; Miyawaki, Jin; Ohba, Tomonori; Yoon, Seong-Ho; Saha, Bidyut Baran; Koyama, Shigeru\n\n2017-01-01\n\nThe Adsorption heat pump is a technology for cooling and heating by using hot water as a driving heat source. It will largely contribute to energy savings when it is driven by solar thermal energy or waste heat. The system is available in the market worldwide, and there are many examples of application to heat recovery in factories and to solar cooling systems. In the present system, silica gel and zeolite are popular adsorbents in combination with water refrigerant. Our study focused on activated carbon-ethanol pair for adsorption cooling system because of the potential to compete with conventional systems in terms of coefficient of performance. In addition, activated-ethanol pair can generally produce larger cooling effect by an adsorption-desorption cycle compared with that of the conventional pairs in terms of cooling effect per unit adsorbent mass. After the potential of a commercially available activated carbon with highest level specific surface area was evaluated, we developed a new activated carbon that has the optimum pore characteristics for the purpose of solar or waste heat driven cooling systems. In this paper, comparison of refrigerants for adsorption heat pump application is presented, and a newly developed activated carbon for ethanol adsorption heat pump is introduced.\n\n[Microbial air purity in hospitals. Operating theatres with air conditioning system].\n\nPubMed\n\nKrogulski, Adam; Szczotko, Maciej\n\n2010-01-01\n\nThe aim of this study was to show the influence of air conditioning control for microbial contamination of air inside the operating theatres equipped with correctly working air-conditioning system. This work was based on the results of bacteria and fungi concentration in hospital air obtained since 2001. Assays of microbial air purity conducted on atmospheric air in parallel with indoor air demonstrated that air filters applied in air-conditioning systems worked correctly in every case. To show the problem of fluctuation of bacteria concentration more precisely, every sequences of single results from successive measure series were examined independently.\n\nVariable speed gas engine-driven air compressor system\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMorgan, J. R.; Ruggles, A. E.; Chen, T. N.; Gehret, J.\n\n1992-11-01\n\nTecogen Inc. and Ingersoll-Rand Co. as a subcontractor have designed a nominal 150-hp gas engine-driven air compressor utilizing the TECODRIVE 8000 engine and the Ingersoll-Rand 178.5-mm twin screw compressor. Phase 1 included the system engineering and design, economic and applications studies, and a draft commercialization plan.

The system is characterized in particular in that ice can be produced and stored in the air conditioning system whereby the time of supplying cooled air can be effectively extended with the merit that the operation cycle of the on and off of the compressor can be prolonged, extending the operation lifespan of the compressor in one aspect. In another aspect, ice production and storage in great amount can be performed in an off-peak period of the electrical power consumption and the stored ice can be utilized in the peak period of the power consumption so as to provide supplemental cooling capacity for the compressor of the air conditioning system whereby the shift of peak and off-peak power consumption can be effected with ease. The present air conditioning system can lower the installation expense for an ice-storing air conditioning system and can also be applied to an old conventional air conditioning system.\n\nDesign and demonstration of a storage assisted air conditioning system\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nAvril, F.; Irvine, T.F.\n\n1982-04-01\n\nThe report describes the design and demonstration of a storage-assisted air conditioning system for residential central air conditioning applications. The system was designed to reduce peak air conditioning loads by storing coolness to fulfill daytime air conditioning requirements. The system design analyses, as well as performance data obtained from a residential installation on Long Island, are presented, along with an economic evaluation of the system. The results of the study indicate that such a system can reduce air conditioning peak load requirements while maintaining house temperature and humidity within prescribed limits. However, further system optimization is required, as well asmoreÂ Â» either equipment costs reduction or increased incentives, to make this system economically attractive for use in New York State.Â«Â less\n\nThe microbiological quality of air improves when using air conditioning systems in cars.\n\nPubMed\n\nVonberg, Ralf-Peter; Gastmeier, Petra; Kenneweg, BjÃ¶rn; Holdack-Janssen, Hinrich; Sohr, Dorit; Chaberny, Iris F\n\n2010-06-01\n\nBecause of better comfort, air conditioning systems are a common feature in automobiles these days. However, its impact on the number of particles and microorganisms inside the vehicle--and by this its impact on the risk of an allergic reaction--is yet unknown. Over a time period of 30 months, the quality of air was investigated in three different types of cars (VW Passat, VW Polo FSI, Seat Alhambra) that were all equipped with a automatic air conditioning system. Operation modes using fresh air from outside the car as well as circulating air from inside the car were examined. The total number of microorganisms and the number of mold spores were measured by impaction in a high flow air sampler. Particles of 0.5 to 5.0 microm diameter were counted by a laser particle counter device. Overall 32 occasions of sampling were performed. The concentration of microorganisms outside the cars was always higher than it was inside the cars. Few minutes after starting the air conditioning system the total number of microorganisms was reduced by 81.7%, the number of mold spores was reduced by 83.3%, and the number of particles was reduced by 87.8%. There were no significant differences neither between the types of cars nor between the types of operation mode of the air conditioning system (fresh air vs. circulating air). All parameters that were looked for in this study improved during utilization of the car's air conditioning system. We believe that the risk of an allergic reaction will be reduced during use also. Nevertheless, we recommend regular maintenance of the system and replacement of older filters after defined changing intervals.\n\nThe microbiological quality of air improves when using air conditioning systems in cars\n\nPubMed Central\n\n2010-01-01\n\nBackground Because of better comfort, air conditioning systems are a common feature in automobiles these days.

Comparison for cooling capacity and energy consumption between IHX air conditioning system and traditional tube air conditioning system are conducted. The suction temperature and discharge temperature of compressor is also recorded. The results show that IHX air conditioning system has higher cooling capacity, the vent temperature decrease 2.3 Â°C in idle condition. But the suction temperature and discharge temperature of compressor increase 10Â°C. IHX air conditioning system has lower energy consumption than traditional tube air conditioning system. Under the experimental conditions in this paper, the application of IHX can significantly reduce the energy consumption of air conditioning system. At 25Â°C of environment temperature, AC system energy consumption decrease 14%, compressor energy consumption decrease 16%. At 37Â°C of environment temperature, AC system energy consumption decrease 16%, compressor energy consumption decrease 13%.\n\nSmall photovoltaic setup for the air conditioning system\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMasiukiewicz, Maciej\n\n2017-10-01\n\nThe increasing interest in air conditioning systems for residential applications in Poland will certainly increase the demand for electricity during the summer period. Due to this fact a growing interest in solutions that help to lower the electricity consumption in this sector is observed. The problem of increased energy demand for air conditioning purposes can be solved by transfer the consumption of electricity from the grid system to renewable energy sources (RES). The greatest demand for cooling occurs during the biggest sunlight. This is the basis for the analysis of technical power system based on photovoltaic cells (PV) to power the split type air conditioner. The object of the study was the commercial residential airconditioning inverter units with a capacity of 2.5kW. A network electricity production system for their own use with the possibility of buffering energy in batteries (OFF-GRID system). Currently, on the Polish market, there are no developed complete solutions dedicated to air conditioning systems based on PV. In Poland, solar energy is mainly used for heat production in solar collectors. The proposed solution will help to increase the popularity of PV systems in the Polish market as an alternative to other RES. The basic conclusion is that the amount of PV energy generated was sufficient to cover the daily energy requirement of the air conditioner.\n\nElectromagnetic Properties Analysis on Hybrid-driven System of Electromagnetic Motor\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nZhao, Jingbo; Han, Bingyuan; Bei, Shaoyi\n\n2018-01-01\n\nThe hybrid-driven system made of permanent-and electromagnets applied in the electromagnetic motor was analyzed, equivalent magnetic circuit was used to establish the mathematical models of hybrid-driven system, based on the models of hybrid-driven system, the air gap flux, air-gap magnetic flux density, electromagnetic force was proposed.

However, asthma attacks due to long-distance inhalative exposure to organic solvents, transmitted via an air condition system, have not been reported so far. The present case illustrates the possibility of air conditioning systems as non-infectious health hazards in occupational medicine. So far, only infectious diseases such as legionella pneumophila pneumonia have commonly been associated to air-conditioning exposures but physicians should be alert to the potential of transmission of toxic volatile substances via air conditioning systems. In view of the events of the 11th of September 2001 with a growing danger of large building terrorism which may even use air conditioning systems to transmit toxins, facility management security staff should be alerted to possible non-infectious toxic health hazards arising from air-conditioning systems.\n\nDesign and demonstration of a storage-assisted air conditioning system\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nRizzuto, J. E.\n\n1981-03-01\n\nThe system is a peak-shaving system designed to provide a levelized air conditioning load. The system also requires minimum air conditioner and thermal storage capacity. The storage-assisted air conditioning system uses a Glauber's salt-based phase change material in sausage like containers called CHUBS. The CHUBS are two (2) inches in diameter and 20 inches long. They are stacked in modules of 64 CHUBS which are appropriately spaced and oriented in the storage system so that air may pass perpendicular to the long axis of the CHUBS. The phase change material, has a thermal storage capacity in the range of 45 to 50 Btu/lb and a transition temperature of approximately 55 F.\n\nApplication of solar energy to air conditioning systems\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nNash, J.

The working refrigerant was R-113. The design of an ejector operating in an air-conditioning and refrigerating system with a low thermal source (70 C to 100 C) is presented. The influence of three major parameters--boiler, condenser, and evaporator temperature--on ejector efficiency is discussed. Experimental results show that the condenser temperature is the major influence at a low evaporator temperature. The maximum ejector efficiency was 31%.\n\nAir conditioning system and component therefore distributing air flow from opposite directions\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nObler, H.

A plurality of outlets such as registers or auxiliary or branch ducts communicate with the supply duct and valve means are disposed in the supply duct at at least some of the outlets for automatically channelling a controllable amount of air from the supply duct to the associated outlet regardless of the direction of air flow within the supply duct. The valve means comprises an automatic air volume control apparatus for distribution within the air supply duct into which air may be introduced from two opposite directions. The apparatus incorporates a freely swinging movable vane in the supply duct to automatically channel into the associated outlet only the deflected air flow which has the higher relative pressure.\n\nREACH.

The CENVA compressor applies the foil bearing technology used in all modern aircraft, civil and military, air conditioning systems. The CENVA compressor will enhance the efficiency of water and air cooled chillers, packaged roof top units, and other air conditioning systems by providing an 18% reduction in energy consumption in the unit capacity range of 25 to 350 tons of refrigeration ThemoreÂ Â» technical approach for CENVA involved the design and development of a high-speed, oil-free foil gas bearing-supported two-stage centrifugal compressor, CENVA encompassed the following high technologies, which are not currently utilized in commercial air conditioning systems: Foil gas bearings operating in HFC-134a; Efficient centrifugal impellers and diffusers; High speed motors and drives; and System integration of above technologies. Extensive design, development and testing efforts were carried out. Significant accomplishments achieved under this program are: (1) A total of 26 builds and over 200 tests were successfully completed with successively improved designs; (2) Use of foil gas bearings in refrigerant R134a was successfully proven; (3) A high speed, high power permanent magnet motor was developed; (4) An encoder was used for signal feedback between motor and controller. Due to temperature limitations of the encoder, the compressor could not operate at higher speed and in turn at higher pressure. In order to alleviate this problem a unique sensorless controller was developed; (5) This controller has successfully been tested as stand alone; however, it has not yet been integrated and tested as a system; (6) The compressor successfully operated at water cooled condensing temperatures Due to\n\n[Air quality control systems: heating, ventilating, and air conditioning (HVAC)].\n\nPubMed\n\nBellucci Sessa, R; Riccio, G\n\n2004-01-01\n\nAfter a brief illustration of the principal layout schemes of Heating, Ventilating, and Air Conditioning (HVAC), the first part of this paper summarizes the standards, both voluntary and compulsory, regulating HVAC facilities design and installation with regard to the question of Indoor Air Quality (IAQ). The paper then examines the problem of ventilation systems maintenance and the essential hygienistic requirements in whose absence HVAC facilities may become a risk factor for people working or living in the building. Lastly, the paper deals with HVAC design strategies and methods, which aim not only to satisfy comfort and air quality requirements, but also to ensure easy and effective maintenance procedures.\n\nDoes the air condition system in busses spread allergic fungi into driver space?\n\nPubMed\n\nSowiak, MaÅgorzata; Kozajda, Anna; JeÅ¼ak, Karolina; Szadkowska-StaÅczyk, Irena\n\n2018-02-01\n\nThe aim of this study was to establish whether the air-conditioning system in buses constitutes an additional source of indoor air contamination with fungi, and whether or not the fungi concentration depends on the period from the last disinfection of the system, combined with replacement of the cabin dust particle filter. The air samples to fungi analysis using impact method were taken in 30 buses (20 with an air-conditioning system, ACS; 10 with a ventilation system, VS) in two series: 1 and 22Â weeks after cabin filter replacement and disinfection of the air-conditioning system. During one test in each bus were taken two samples: before the air-conditioning or ventilation system switched on and 6Â min after operating of these systems. The atmospheric air was the external background (EB). After 1Â week of use of the system, the fungi concentrations before starting of the ACS and VS system were 527.8 and 1053.0Â cfu/m 3 , respectively, and after 22Â weeks the concentrations were 351.9 and 1069.6Â cfu/m 3 , respectively. While in the sample after 6Â min of ACS and VS system operating, the fungi concentration after 1Â week of use was 127.6 and 233.7Â cfu/m 3 , respectively, and after 22Â weeks it was 113.3 and 324.9Â cfu/m 3 , respectively. Results do not provide strong evidence that air-conditioning system is an additional source of indoor air contamination with fungi. A longer operation of the system promoted increase of fungi concentration in air-conditioned buses only.\n\nStudy on the design schemes of the air-conditioning system in a gymnasium\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nZhang, Yujin; Wu, Xinwei; Zhang, Jing; Pan, Zhixin\n\n2017-08-01\n\nIn view of designing the air conditioning project for a gymnasium successfully, the cooling and heating source schemes are fully studied by analyzing the surrounding environment and energy conditions of the project, as well as the analysis of the initial investment and operating costs, which indicates the air source heat pump air conditioning system is the best choice for the project. The indoor air conditioning schemes are also studied systematically and the optimization of air conditioning schemes is carried out in each area. The principle of operating conditions for the whole year is followed and the quality of indoor air and energy-saving are ensured by the optimized design schemes, which provide references for the air conditioning system design in the same kinds of building.\n\nPerformance analysis of an air drier for a liquid dehumidifier solar air conditioning system\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nQueiroz, A.G.; Orlando, A.F.; Saboya, F.E.M.\n\n1988-05-01\n\nA model was developed for calculating the operating conditions of a non-adiabatic liquid dehumidifier used in solar air conditioning systems. In the experimental facility used for obtaining the data, air and triethylene glycol circulate countercurrently outside staggered copper tubes which are the filling of an absorption tower. Water flows inside the copper tubes, thus cooling the whole system and increasing the mass transfer potential for drying air. The methodology for calculating the mass transfer coefficient is based on the Merkel integral approach, taking into account the lowering of the water vapor pressure in equilibrium with the water glycol solution.\n\nThe Integrated Air Transportation System Evaluation Tool\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nWingrove, Earl R., III; Hees, Jing; Villani, James A.; Yackovetsky, Robert E. (Technical Monitor)\n\n2002-01-01\n\nThroughout U.S. history, our nation has generally enjoyed exceptional economic growth, driven in part by transportation advancements. Looking forward 25 years, when the national highway and skyway systems are saturated, the nation faces new challenges in creating transportation-driven economic growth and wealth. To meet the national requirement for an improved air traffic management system, NASA developed the goal of tripling throughput over the next 20 years, in all weather conditions while maintaining safety. Analysis of the throughput goal has primarily focused on major airline operations, primarily through the hub and spoke system.However, many suggested concepts to increase throughput may operate outside the hub and spoke system. Examples of such concepts include the Small Aircraft Transportation System, civil tiltrotor, and improved rotorcraft. Proper assessment of the potential contribution of these technologies to the domestic air transportation system requires a modeling capability that includes the country's numerous smaller airports, acting as a fundamental component of the National Air space System, and the demand for such concepts and technologies. Under this task for NASA, the Logistics Management Institute developed higher fidelity demand models that capture the interdependence of short-haul air travel with other transportation modes and explicitly consider the costs of commercial air and other transport modes. To accomplish this work, we generated forecasts of the distribution of general aviation based aircraft and GA itinerant operations at each of nearly 3.000 airport based on changes in economic conditions and demographic trends. We also built modules that estimate the demand for travel by different modes, particularly auto, commercial air, and GA. We examined GA demand from two perspectives: top-down and bottom-up, described in detail.\n\nThermal storage HVAC system retrofit provides economical air conditioning\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nSmith, S.F.\n\n1993-03-01\n\nThis article describes an EMS-controlled HVAC system that meets the ventilation and cooling needs of an 18,000-seat indoor ice hockey arena. The Buffalo Memorial Auditorium (affectionately referred to as the Aud) was built in 1937 under the Works Project Administration of the federal government. Its original configuration included a 12,000-seat arena with an ice skating rink. By the late 1980s, the city was unsuccessfully attempting to attract events and tenants to the auditorium, which lacked air conditioning and other modern amenities. Thus, it was decided to renovate the facility to make it marketable. The first phase of the renovation includedmoreÂ Â» installing an air-conditioning system in the arena and repairing the existing building systems that were inoperable because of deferred maintenance. After considering the existing conditions (such as size of the space, intermittent usage, construction restrictions, operating budgets and the limited operations staff), the engineering team designed an innovative HVAC system. The system's features include: a carbon dioxide monitoring device that controls the intake of outside air; an ice storage system that provides chilled water and shifts electrical demand to off-peak hours; and a design that uses the building mass as a heat sink. A new energy management system (EMS) determines building cooling needs based on the type of event, ambient conditions and projected audience size. Then, it selects the most economical method to obtain the desired arena temperature.Â«Â less\n\nHeating, Ventilation and Air-Conditioning Systems, Part of Indoor Air Quality Design Tools for Schools\n\nEPA Pesticide Factsheets\n\nThe main purposes of a Heating, Ventilation, and Air-Conditioning system are to help maintain good indoor air quality through adequate ventilation with filtration and provide thermal comfort.

The aim of this study was to analyze the concentrations of biological agents in office buildings, dependending on ventilation/air conditioning system and season. The study covered office buildings (different in the system of ventila-tion/air conditioning). Air samples for assessing the levels of inhalable dust, endotoxins and (1-->3)-beta-D-glucans, were taken at the selected stationary points of each building during summer and winter. The air was sampled for 6 h, using portable sets consisting of the GilAir 5 pump and the head filled with a filter of fiber glass. The samples for the presence of airborne bacteria and fungi were collected twice during the day using the impaction method. Average concentrations of inhalable dust, bacteria, fungi, endotoxins and (1-->3)-beta-D-glucans in office premises were 0.09 mg/m3, 6.00 x 10(2) cfu/m3, 4.59 x 10(1) cfu/m3, 0.42 ng/m3 and 3.91 ng/m3, respectively. Higher concentrations of the investigated agents were found in summer. In premises with air conditioning concentrations of airborne fungi, (1-->3)-beta-D-glucans and inhalable dust were significantly lower in winter. In summer the trend was reverse except for (1-->3)-beta-D-glucans. Concentrations of biological agents were affected by the season and the presence of air conditioning. Concentrations of inhalable dust, bacteria, fungi, endotoxins and (1-->3)-beta-D-glucans, observed inside the office buildings, were significantly higher in summer than in winter. The presence of the air conditioning system modified in various ways the levels of biological agents. Its influence was greater on the concentration of fungi and (1-->3)-beta-D-glucans than on that of bacteria and endotoxins.\n\nThermal conditions and perceived air quality in an air-conditioned auditorium\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nPolednik, Bernard; Guz, Åukasz; SkwarczyÅski, Mariusz; DudziÅska, Marzenna R.\n\n2016-07-01\n\nThe study reports measurements of indoor air temperature (T) and relative humidity (RH), perceived air quality (PAQ) and CO2, fine aerosol particle number (PN) and mass (PM1) concentrations in an air conditioned auditorium. The measurements of these air physical parameters have been carried out in the unoccupied auditorium with the air conditioning system switched off (AC off mode) and in the unoccupied and occupied auditorium with the air conditioning system switched off during the night and switched on during the day (AC on/off mode). The average indoor air thermal parameters, CO2 concentration and the PAQ value (in decipols) were elevated, while average PM1 concentration was lower in the AC on/off mode. A statistically significant (p < 0.001) positive correlation has been observed between T and PAQ values and CO2 concentrations (r = 0.66 and r = 0.59, respectively) in that AC mode. A significant negative correlation has been observed between T and PN and PM1 concentrations (r = -0.38 and r = -0.49, respectively). In the AC off mode the above relations between T and the particle concentrations were not that unequivocal. These findings may be of importance as they indicate that in certain AC operation modes the indoor air quality deteriorates along with the variation of the indoor air microclimate and room occupation. This, in turn, may adversely affect the comfort and productivity of the users of air conditioned premises.\n\n[Assessment of the air quality improment of cleaning and disinfection on central air-conditioning ventilation system].\n\nPubMed\n\nLiu, Hongliang; Zhang, Lei; Feng, Lihong; Wang, Fei; Xue, Zhiming\n\n2009-09-01\n\nTo assess the effect of air quality of cleaning and disinfection on central air-conditioning ventilation systems. 102 air-conditioning ventilation systems in 46 public facilities were sampled and investigated based on Hygienic assessment criterion of cleaning and disinfection of public central air-conditioning systems. Median dust volume decreased from 41.8 g/m2 to 0.4 g/m2, and the percentage of pipes meeting the national standard for dust decreased from 17.3% (13/60) to 100% (62/62). In the dust, median aerobic bacterial count decreased from 14 cfu/cm2 to 1 cfu/cm2. Median aerobic fungus count decreased from 10 cfu/cm2 to 0 cfu/cm2. The percentage of pipes with bacterial and fungus counts meeting the national standard increased from 92.4% (171/185) and 82.2% (152/185) to 99.4% (165/166) and 100% (166/166), respectively. In the ventilation air, median aerobic bacterial count decreased from 756 cfu/m3 to 229 cfu/m3. Median aerobic fungus count decreased from 382 cfu/m3 to 120 cfu/m3. The percentage of pipes meeting the national standard for ventilation air increased from 33.3% (81/243) and 62.1% (151/243) to 79.8% (292/366) and 87.7% (242/276), respectively. But PM10 rose from 0.060 mg/m3 to 0.068 mg/m3, and the percentage of pipes meeting the national standard for PM10 increased from 74.2% (13/60) to 90.2% (46/51). The cleaning and disinfection of central air-conditioning ventilation systems could have a beneficial effect of air quality.\n\nFeedback linearization based control of a variable air volume air conditioning system for cooling applications.\n\nPubMed\n\nThosar, Archana; Patra, Amit; Bhattacharyya, Souvik\n\n2008-07-01\n\nDesign of a nonlinear control system for a Variable Air Volume Air Conditioning (VAVAC) plant through feedback linearization is presented in this article. VAVAC systems attempt to reduce building energy consumption while maintaining the primary role of air conditioning. The temperature of the space is maintained at a constant level by establishing a balance between the cooling load generated in the space and the air supply delivered to meet the load. The dynamic model of a VAVAC plant is derived and formulated as a MIMO bilinear system. Feedback linearization is applied for decoupling and linearization of the nonlinear model. Simulation results for a laboratory scale plant are presented to demonstrate the potential of keeping comfort and maintaining energy optimal performance by this methodology. Results obtained with a conventional PI controller and a feedback linearizing controller are compared and the superiority of the proposed approach is clearly established.\n\nNo-reheat air-conditioning\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nObler, H.

A form of this material containing salts to adjust the transition point to approximately 55/sup 0/F and a gelling agent to prevent segregation of the salts has been developed. This material is packaged in the form of a CHUB, (a cylinder two inches in diameter and twenty inches long) having a weight of 3.25 pounds and a thermal storage capability of 50 Btu per pound. Under this project, a storage-assisted (partial storage) air conditioning system was designed, installed, monitored and evaluated in a typical residential application. ThismoreÂ Â» feasibility demonstration was conducted under the direction of the Long Island Lighting Company in a single family residence in Melville, Long Island, New York. The demonstration system consisted of a CHUB thermal storage system utilized in conjunction with a one and one-half ton air conditioning unit to cool a house that would normally require a two and one half ton air conditioning unit.Â«Â less\n\nTotal environmental warming impact (TEWI) calculations for alternative automative air-conditioning systems\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nSand, J.R.; Fischer, S.K.\n\n1997-01-01\n\nThe Montreal Protocol phase-out of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) has required manufacturers to develop refrigeration and air-conditioning systems that use refrigerants that can not damage stratospheric ozone. Most refrigeration industries have adapted their designs to use hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC) or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerants; new automobile air- conditioning systems use HFC-134a. These industries are now being affected by scientific investigations of greenhouse warming and questions about the effects of refrigerants on global warming. Automobile air-conditioning has three separate impacts on global warming; (1) the effects of refrigerant inadvertently released to the atmosphere from accidents, servicing, and leakage; (2) the efficiency of the cooling equipmentmoreÂ Â» (due to the emission of C0{sub 2} from burning fuel to power the system); and (3) the emission of C0{sub 2} from burning fuel to transport the system. The Total Equivalent Warming Impact (TEWI) is an index that should be used to compare the global warming effects of alternative air-conditioning systems because it includes these contributions from the refrigerant, cooling efficiency, and weight. This paper compares the TEWI of current air-conditioning systems using HFC-134a with that of transcritical vapor compression system using carbon dioxide and systems using flammable refrigerants with secondary heat transfer loops. Results are found to depend on both climate and projected efficiency of C0{sub 2}systems. Performance data on manufacturing prototype systems are needed to verify the potential reductions in TEWI. Extensive field testing is also required to determine the performance, reliability, and ``serviceability`` of each alternative to HFC-134a to establish whether the potential reduction of TEWI can be achieved in a viable consumer product.Â«Â less\n\nDesign of a solar energy assisted air conditioning system\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nVarlet, J.L.P.; Johnson, B.R.; Vora, J.N.\n\n1976-03-24\n\nEnergy consumption in air conditioning systems can be reduced by reducing the water content of air before cooling. This reduction in humidity can be accomplished by contacting the humid air with a hygroscopic solution in a spray tower. The hydroscopic solution, diluted by water from the air, can be reconcentrated in a solar evaporator. A solar evaporator for this purpose was evaluated by formulating simultaneous energy and mass balances for forced air convection through the evaporator. Temperatures in the evaporator were calculated by numerical integration of the mathematical model. The calculations indicated that the salt solution cannot be reconcentrated inmoreÂ Â» a forced convection evaporator because of the large energy losses associated with the air stream passing through the evaporator.Â«Â less\n\nComputational model of collisional-radiative nonequilibrium plasma in an air-driven type laser propulsion\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nOgino, Yousuke; Ohnishi, Naofumi\n\nA thrust power of a gas-driven laser-propulsion system is obtained through interaction with a propellant gas heated by a laser energy. Therefore, understanding the nonequilibrium nature of laser-produced plasma is essential for increasing available thrust force and for improving energy conversion efficiency from a laser to a propellant gas. In this work, a time-dependent collisional-radiative model for air plasma has been developed to study the effects of nonequilibrium atomic and molecular processes on population densities for an air-driven type laser propulsion. Many elementary processes are considered in the number density range of 10{sup 12}/cm{sup 3}<=N<=10{sup 19}/cm{sup 3} and the temperaturemoreÂ Â» range of 300 K<=T<=40,000 K. We then compute the unsteady nature of pulsively heated air plasma. When the ionization relaxation time is the same order as the time scale of a heating pulse, the effects of unsteady ionization are important for estimating air plasma states. From parametric computations, we determine the appropriate conditions for the collisional-radiative steady state, local thermodynamic equilibrium, and corona equilibrium models in that density and temperature range.Â«Â less\n\nSilver zeolite antimicrobial activity in aluminium heating, ventilation and air conditioning system ducts.\n\nPubMed\n\nRizzetto, R; Mansi, A; Panatto, D; Rizzitelli, E; Tinteri, C; Sasso, T; Gasparini, R; Crovari, P\n\n2008-03-01\n\nAir pollution in confined environments is a serious health problem, in that most people spend long periods indoors (in homes, offices, classrooms etc.). Some people (children, the elderly, heart disease patients, asthmatic or allergic subjects) are at greater risk because of their conditions of frailty. The growing use of air-conditioning systems in many public and private buildings aggravates this health risk, especially when these systems are not correctly installed or regularly serviced. The aim of our study was to verify the capacity of Ag+ ions to stop the growth of bacteria and moulds inside the ducts of Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning system ducts (HVAC) systems when these ducts were lined with active Ag+ ions zeolite-coated panels. A Y-shaped HVAC model with two branches was used; one branch was made of traditional galvanized iron, as was the whole system, while the other was lined with active Ag+ zeolite-coated polyurethane panels. During the test, samples of dust present inside both ducts were collected and seeded in liquid and solid media to detect bacteria and moulds. The presence of bacteria was also sought in the air emerging from the outlets of both ducts. Tests made on samples of particulate collected from the two different ducts revealed a lower total bacterial load in the samples collected from the Ag+ zeolite-coated duct than in the samples from the traditional Zn galvanized duct. In addition, the values of bacterial load found in the air emerging from the Ag+ ions zeolite-lined duct were 5 times lower than those found in the air from the traditional galvanized iron duct. The utilization of Ag+ zeolite-coated panels in air-conditioning systems could improve the quality of the emerging air in comparison with traditional installations in galvanized iron. This innovation could prove particularly advantageous in the event of accidents during the installation of air-conditioning systems or of contaminated aerosols coming from outside.\n\nPhysiological and subjective responses in the elderly when using floor heating and air conditioning systems.\n\nPubMed\n\nHashiguchi, Nobuko; Tochihara, Yutaka; Ohnaka, Tadakatsu; Tsuchida, Chiaki; Otsuki, Tamio\n\n2004-11-01\n\nThe purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of a floor heating and air conditioning system on thermal responses of the elderly. Eight elderly men and eight university students sat for 90 minutes in a chair under the following 3 conditions: air conditioning system (A), floor heating system (F) and no heating system (C). The air temperature of sitting head height for condition A was 25 degrees C, and the maximum difference in vertical air temperature was 4 degrees C. The air and floor temperature for condition F were 21 and 29 degrees C, respectively. The air temperature for condition C was 15 degrees C. There were no significant differences in rectal temperature and mean skin temperature between condition A and F. Systolic blood pressure of the elderly men in condition C significantly increased compared to those in condition A and F. No significant differences in systolic blood pressure between condition A and F were found. The percentage of subjects who felt comfortable under condition F was higher than that of those under condition A in both age groups, though the differences between condition F and A was not significant. Relationships between thermal comfort and peripheral (e.g., instep, calf, hand) skin temperature, and the relationship between thermal comfort and leg thermal sensation were significant for both age groups. However, the back and chest skin temperature and back thermal sensation for the elderly, in contrast to that for the young, was not significantly related to thermal comfort. These findings suggested that thermal responses and physiological strain using the floor heating system did not significantly differ from that using the air conditioning system, regardless of the subject age and despite the fact that the air temperature with the floor heating system was lower. An increase in BP for elderly was observed under the condition in which the air temperature was 15 degrees C, and it was suggested that it was necessary for the elderly\n\nEvaluation of Rankine cycle air conditioning system hardware by computer simulation\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nHealey, H.

The multifunctional cabins' dynamic loads for a ship navigating in a typical Eurasian route were calculated based on Simulink. The model can predict changes in full voyage load. Based on the simulation model, the effects of variable air volume and variable water volume on the energy consumption of the air-conditioning system are analyzed. The results show that: When the VAV is coupled with the VWV, the energy saving rate is 23.2%.

At the beginning of the 15-month investigation period, the first filter stages of both HVAC systems were equipped with new unused air filters. The number of airborne bacteria and molds before and behind the filters were determined simultaneously in 14 days-intervals using 6-stage Andersen cascade impactors. Under relatively dry (< 80% R. H.) and warm (> 12 degrees C) outdoor air conditions air filters led to a marked reduction of airborne microorganism concentrations (bacteria by approximately 70% and molds by > 80%). However, during long periods of high relative humidity (> 80% R. H.) a proliferation of bacteria on air filters with subsequent release into the filtered air occurred. These microorganisms were mainly smaller than 1.1 microns therefore being part of the respirable fraction. The results showed furthermore that one possibility to avoid microbial proliferation is to limit the relative humidity in the area of the air filters to 80% R. H.

The system is required to condition and cool down ambient air for a small residential space with the reduction in the use of electricity and eliminating the use of commercial refrigerants. This project can operate at its optimum performance in remote areas like oil diggers and other projects that run in the desert or any site that would not have a very high relative humidity level. The Maisotsenko cycle is known as the thermodynamic concept that captures energy from the air by using the psychometric renewable energy available in the latent heat in water evaporating in air. The heat and mass exchanger design was based on choosing a material that would-be water resistant and breathable, which was found to be layers of cardboard placed on top of each other and thus creating channels for air to pass through. Aiming for this design eliminates any high power electrical equipment such as compressors, condensers and evaporators that would be used in an AC system with the exception of a 600 W blower and a 10 W fan, thus making it a more environmentally friendly project. Moreover, the project is limited by the ambient temperature and humidity, as the model operates at an optimum when the relative humidity is lower.\n\nBi-level Optimization Method of Air-conditioning System Based on Office Building Energy Storage Characteristics\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nWang, Qingze; Chen, Xingying; Ji, Li; Liao, Yingchen; Yu, Kun\n\n2017-05-01\n\nThe air-conditioning system of office building is a large power consumption terminal equipment, whose unreasonable operation mode leads to low energy efficiency.

The main experimental results are as follows. The discharge in the pulsed mode occurs repetitively despite of the dc input, and the pulsed mode transfers to the continuous mode as the current exceeds a threshold. The measured emission spectrum from the arc column of the air discharge reveals that most energy of activated electrons is used for the excitation of N2 (second positive system bands) and part of the energy for the dissociation of O2. The length of the plasma torch depends on the tube length, inner gap distance, and flow rate. The maximum torch length of about 40 mm is obtained under certain conditions. The spatial distributions of plasma gas temperature are measured and confirmed by the visualization of the gas flow using Schlieren images. Furthermore, surface treatment and decolorization using the generated plasma torch are carried out, focusing on industrial applications.\n\nPreliminary design package for residential heating/cooling system: Rankine air conditioner redesign\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\n1978-01-01\n\nA summary of the preliminary redesign and development of a marketable single family heating and cooling system is presented.

The primary aim of the present work is to design an air-conditioning system based on vapour absorption cycle that utilizes a renewable energy source for its operation. The building under consideration is a classroom of dimensions 18.5 m Ã 13 m Ã 4.5 m located in Hamirpur district of Himachal Pradesh in India. For this purpose, cooling load of the building was calculated first by using cooling load temperature difference method to estimate cooling capacity of the air-conditioning system. Coefficient of performance of the refrigeration system was computed for various values of strong and weak solution concentration. In this work, a solar collector is also designed to provide required amount of heat energy by the absorption system. This heat energy is taken from solar energy which makes this system eco-friendly and sustainable. A computer program was written in MATLAB to calculate the design parameters. Results were obtained for various values of solution concentrations throughout the year.

The current solar Air Conditioners (A/C)s suffer from low Coefficient of Performance (COP) and performance degradation in hot and humid climates. By investigating the possible ways of utilizing solar energy in air conditioning applications, the bottlenecks in these approaches were identified. That resulted in proposing a novel system whose subsystem synergy led to a COP higher than unity. The proposed system was found to maintain indoor comfort at a higher COP compared to the most common solar A/Cs, especially under very hot and humid climate conditions. The novelty of the proposed A/C is to use a concentrating photovoltaic/thermal collector, which outputs thermal and electrical energy simultaneously, to drive a hybrid A/C. The performance of the hybrid A/C, which consists of a desiccant wheel, an enthalpy wheel, and a vapor compression cycle (VCC), was investigated experimentally. This work also explored the use of a new type of desiccant material, which can be regenerated with a low temperature heat source. The experimental results showed that the hybrid A/C is more effective than the standalone VCC in maintaining the indoor conditions within the comfort zone. Using the experimental data, the COP of the hybrid A/C driven by a hybrid solar collector was found to be at least double that of the current solar A/Cs. The innovative integration of its subsystems allows each subsystem to do what it can do best. That leads to lower energy consumption which helps reduce the peak electrical loads on electric utilities and reduces the consumer operating cost since less energy is purchased during the on peak periods and less solar collector area is needed. In order for the proposed A/C to become a real alternative to conventional systems, its performance and total cost were optimized using the experimentally validated model.

A liquid refrigerant accumulator-heat exchanger is placed in the system to provide a heat exchange relationship between hot liquid refrigerant discharged from condenser and a relatively cool mixture of liquid and vaporous refrigerant discharged from the evaporator. This heat exchange relationship substantially sub-cools the hot liquid refrigerant which undergoes little or no evaporation across the expansion device and provides a liquid over-feeding operation through the evaporator for effectively using 100 percent of evaporator for cooling purposes and for providing the aforementioned mixture of liquid and vaporous refrigerant.\n\nNatural convection liquid desiccant loop as an auxiliary air conditioning system: investigating the operational parameters\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nFazilati, Mohammad Ali; Alemrajabi, Ali Akbar; Sedaghat, Ahmad\n\n2018-03-01\n\nLiquid desiccant air conditioning system with natural convection was presented previously as a new generation of AC systems. The system consists of two three-fluid energy exchangers namely absorber and regenerator in which the action of air dehumidifying and desiccant regeneration is done, respectively. The influence of working parameters on system performance including the heat source and heat sink temperature, concentration of desiccant solution fills the system initially and humidity content of inlet air to regenerator is investigated experimentally. The heat source temperatures of 50 Â°C and 60 Â°C, heat sink temperatures of 15 Â°C and 20 Â°C and desiccant concentrations of 30% and 34%, are examined here. The inlet air to regenerator has temperature of 38.5 Â°C and three relative humidity of 14%, 38% and 44%. In all experiments, the inlet air to absorber has temperature of 31 Â°C and relative humidity of 75%. By inspecting evaluation indexes of system, it is revealed that higher startup desiccant concentration solution is more beneficial for all study cases. It is also observed although the highest/lowest temperature heat source/heat sink is most suitable for best system operation, increasing the heat source temperature should be accompanied with decreasing heat sink temperature. Using drier air stream for regenerator inlet does not necessarily improve system performance; and the air stream with proper value of humidity content should be employed. Finally after running the system in its best working condition, the coefficient of performance (COP) reached 4.66 which verified to be higher than when the same air conditioning task done by a conventional vapor compression system, in which case the COP was 3.38.\n\nApplication of solar energy to air-conditioning\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nHarstad, A.

The system is used to shift air-conditioning load of residential and commercial buildings from on-peak to off-peak period. Demand-side load management can thus be achieved if many buildings are equipped with such storage devices. In the design of this system, a lumped-parameter circuit model is first employed to simulate the heat transfer within the air-conditioned building such that the required capacity of the storage tank can be figured out. Then, a set of desirable parameters for the temperaturemoreÂ Â» controller of the system are determined using the parameter plane method and the root locus method. The validity of the proposed mathematical model and design approach is verified by comparing the results obtained from field tests with those from the computer simulations. Cost-benefit analysis of the system is also discussed.Â«Â less\n\nAir-Flow-Driven Triboelectric Nanogenerators for Self-Powered Real-Time Respiratory Monitoring.\n\nPubMed\n\nWang, Meng; Zhang, Jiahao; Tang, Yingjie; Li, Jun; Zhang, Baosen; Liang, Erjun; Mao, Yanchao; Wang, Xudong\n\n2018-06-04\n\nRespiration is one of the most important vital signs of humans, and respiratory monitoring plays an important role in physical health management. A low-cost and convenient real-time respiratory monitoring system is extremely desirable. In this work, we demonstrated an air-flow-driven triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) for self-powered real-time respiratory monitoring by converting mechanical energy of human respiration into electric output signals. The operation of the TENG was based on the air-flow-driven vibration of a flexible nanostructured polytetrafluoroethylene (n-PTFE) thin film in an acrylic tube. This TENG can generate distinct real-time electric signals when exposed to the air flow from different breath behaviors. It was also found that the accumulative charge transferred in breath sensing corresponds well to the total volume of air exchanged during the respiration process. Based on this TENG device, an intelligent wireless respiratory monitoring and alert system was further developed, which used the TENG signal to directly trigger a wireless alarm or dial a cell phone to provide timely alerts in response to breath behavior changes. This research offers a promising solution for developing self-powered real-time respiratory monitoring devices.\n\nSystem and method for conditioning intake air to an internal combustion engine\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nSellnau, Mark C.\n\nA system for conditioning the intake air to an internal combustion engine includes a means to boost the pressure of the intake air to the engine and a liquid cooled charge air cooler disposed between the output of the boost means and the charge air intake of the engine. Valves in the coolant system can be actuated so as to define a first configuration in which engine cooling is performed by coolant circulating in a first coolant loop at one temperature, and charge air cooling is performed by coolant flowing in a second coolant loop at a lower temperature. ThemoreÂ Â» valves can be actuated so as to define a second configuration in which coolant that has flowed through the engine can be routed through the charge air cooler. The temperature of intake air to the engine can be controlled over a wide range of engine operation.Â«Â less\n\nApplication of acoustic agglomeration to enhance air filtration efficiency in air-conditioning and mechanical ventilation (ACMV) systems.\n\nPubMed\n\nNg, Bing Feng; Xiong, Jin Wen; Wan, Man Pun\n\n2017-01-01\n\nThe recent episodes of haze in Southeast Asia have caused some of the worst regional atmospheric pollution ever recorded in history. In order to control the levels of airborne fine particulate matters (PM) indoors, filtration systems providing high PM capturing efficiency are often sought, which inadvertently also results in high airflow resistance (or pressure drop) that increases the energy consumption for air distribution. A pre-conditioning mechanism promoting the formation of particle clusters to enhance PM capturing efficiency without adding flow resistance in the air distribution ductwork could provide an energy-efficient solution. This pre-conditioning mechanism can be fulfilled by acoustic agglomeration, which is a phenomenon that promotes the coagulation of suspended particles by acoustic waves propagating in the fluid medium. This paper discusses the basic mechanisms of acoustic agglomeration along with influencing factors that could affect the agglomeration efficiency. The feasibility to apply acoustic agglomeration to improve filtration in air-conditioning and mechanical ventilation (ACMV) systems is investigated experimentally in a small-scale wind tunnel. Experimental results indicate that this novel application of acoustic pre-conditioning improves the PM2.5 filtration efficiency of the test filters by up to 10% without introducing additional pressure drop. The fan energy savings from not having to switch to a high capturing efficiency filter largely outstrip the additional energy consumed by the acoustics system. This, as a whole, demonstrates potential energy savings from the combined acoustic-enhanced filtration system without compromising on PM capturing efficiency.\n\nApplication of acoustic agglomeration to enhance air filtration efficiency in air-conditioning and mechanical ventilation (ACMV) systems\n\nPubMed Central\n\nXiong, Jin Wen; Wan, Man Pun\n\n2017-01-01\n\nThe recent episodes of haze in Southeast Asia have caused some of the worst regional atmospheric pollution ever recorded in history.

By detailed calculating the space moisture load and the fresh air volume required for dehumidification in 120 selected major cities in China, it can be inferred that the minimum fresh air volume required for dehumidification in THIC is mainly determined by the local outdoor air moisture and the outdoor wind speed; Then the mathematical fitting software Matlab was used to fit the three parameters, and a simplified formula for calculating the minimum per capita fresh air volume required for dehumidification was obtained; And the indoor relative humidity was simulated by the numerical software Airpak and the results by using the formula data and the data for hygiene were compared to verify the relibility of the simplified formula.\n\nHigh Efficiency Variable Speed Versatile Power Air Conditioning System for Military Vehicles\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n2013-08-01\n\nMOBILITY (P&M) MINI-SYMPOSIUM AUGUST 21-22, 2013 - TROY , MICHIGAN High efficiency variable speed versatile power air conditioning system for...power draw was measured using a calibrated Watt meter.

One such variant, air-cooled RCCS, uses natural convection to drive the flow of air from outside the reactor building to remove decay heat during normal operation and accident scenarios. The Natural convection Shutdown heat removal Test Facility (NSTF) at Argonne National Laboratory (âArgonneâ) is a half-scale model of the primary features of one conceptual air-cooled RCCS design. The facility was constructed to carry out highly instrumented experiments to study the performancemoreÂ Â» of the RCCS concept for reactor decay heat removal that relies on natural convection cooling. Parallel modeling and simulation efforts were performed to support the design, operation, and analysis of the natural convection system. Throughout the testing program, strong influences of ambient conditions were observed in the experimental data when baseline tests were repeated under the same test procedures. Thus, significant analysis efforts were devoted to gaining a better understanding of these influences and the subsequent response of the NSTF to ambient conditions. It was determined that air humidity had negligible impacts on NSTF system performance and therefore did not warrant consideration in the models. However, temperature differences between the building exterior and interior air, along with the outside wind speed, were shown to be dominant factors. Combining the stack and wind effects together, an empirical model was developed based on theoretical considerations and using experimental data to correlate zero-power system flow rates with ambient meteorological conditions. Some coefficients in the model were obtained based on best fitting the experimental data. The predictive capability of the empirical model was demonstrated by applying it to the new set of experimental data.

G.; O'Bryan, L.\n\n2010-12-01\n\nThe direct use of geothermal energy from Hot Sedimentary Aquifer (HSA) systems for large scale air-conditioning projects involves many tradeoffs. Aspects contributing towards making design decisions for such systems include: the inadequately known permeability and thermal distributions underground; the combinatorial complexity of selecting pumping and chiller systems to match the underground conditions to the air-conditioning requirements; the future price variations of the electricity market; any uncertainties in future Carbon pricing; and the applicable discount rate for evaluating the financial worth of the project. Expanding upon the previous work of Horowitz and Hornby (2007), we take an optimal control approach to the design of such systems. By building a model of the HSA system, the drilling process, the pumping process, and the chilling operations, along with a specified objective function, we can write a Hamiltonian for the system. Using the standard techniques of optimal control, we use gradients of the Hamiltonian to find the optimal design for any given set of permeabilities, thermal distributions, and the other engineering and financial parameters. By using this approach, optimal system designs could potentially evolve in response to the actual conditions encountered during drilling. Because the granularity of some current models is so coarse, we will be able to compare our optimal control approach to an exhaustive search of parameter space. We will present examples from the conditions appropriate for the Perth Basin of Western Australia, where the WA Geothermal Centre of Excellence is involved with two large air-conditioning projects using geothermal water from deep aquifers at 75 to 95 degrees C.\n\nAir conditioning system\n\nDOEpatents\n\nLowenstein, Andrew; Miller, Jeffrey; Gruendeman, Peter; DaSilva, Michael\n\n2005-02-01\n\nAn air conditioner comprises a plurality of plates arranged in a successively stacked configuration with portions thereof having a spaced apart arrangement, and defining between successive adjacent pairs of plates at the spaced apart portions a first and second series of discrete alternating passages wherein a first air stream is passed through the first series of passages and a second air stream is passed through the second series of passages; and said stacked configuration of plates forming integrally therewith a liquid delivery means for delivering from a source a sufficient quantity of a liquid to the inside surfaces of the first series of fluid passages in a manner which provides a continuous flow of the liquid from a first end to a second end of the plurality of plates while in contact with the first air stream.\n\nSimulation of a solar-assisted absorption air conditioning system for applications in Puerto Rico\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nKhan, A.Y.; Hernandez, H.R.; Gonzalez, J.E.\n\n1995-11-01\n\nRegions without conventional fuel sources have felt the need for the development of new technologies for air conditioning applications as cost of electrical energy production has continually risen the cost of air conditioning by conventional means. This paper deals with the simulation of a solar-assisted absorption system for air conditioning application in Puerto Rico. A simple thermodynamic model for the solar assisted absorption system has been developed. A solar energy based thermal storage system along with an auxiliary heater is used to provide the required energy in the generator of this absorption system. Results from a parametric analysis to studymoreÂ Â» the influence of the absorber, generator, condenser and evaporator temperatures, on the COP of the system are presented in this paper. The influence of two different refrigerant/absorbent pairs, water/lithium bromide and water/lithium-chloride have also been studied. A sub-system consisting of an array of flat plate solar collectors along with a hot water storage is modeled and verified with the data from an already existing system operating in Sacramento. Finally, off-design performance of a 35 kW solar-assisted absorption system is simulated to report the auxiliary heating requirement for a typical summer day operation in southern Puerto Rico.Â«Â less\n\nLegionella species colonization of water distribution systems, pools and air conditioning systems in cruise ships and ferries\n\nPubMed Central\n\nGoutziana, Georgia; Mouchtouri, Varvara A; Karanika, Maria; Kavagias, Antonios; Stathakis, Nikolaos E; Gourgoulianis, Kostantinos; Kremastinou, Jenny; Hadjichristodoulou, Christos\n\n2008-01-01\n\nBackground Legionnaires' disease continues to be a public health concern in passenger ships.

Strategic concepts for the supply of one or more operating suites with a modular based air handling system were discussed. The operating theatre ceiling itself, as a major part of the whole integrated system, is no longer a simple air outlet: additional functions have been added in so-called media-bridges, so that it has changed towards a medical apparatus serving as a daily tool for the physicians and the operating staff. Last and not least, the servicing of the whole system has become an integral part of the facility management with remote access to the main functions and controls.

Membrane separation is an emerging technology for air dehumidification and it is based on the solution diffusion mechanism. Water molecules are preferentially permeating through the membranes due to its smaller kinetic diameter and higher condensability than the other gases. Compared to other dehumidification technologies such as direct cooling or desiccation, there is no phase transition involved in membrane dehumidification, neither the contact between the fresh air stream and the desiccants. Hence, membrane dehumidification would not only require less energy consumption but also avoid cross-contamination problems. A pilot scale air dehumidification system is built in this study which comprises nine pieces of one-inch PAN/PDMS hollow fiber membrane modules. A 150 h long-term test shows that the membrane modules has good water vapor transport properties by using a low vacuum force of only 0.78 bar absolute pressure at the lumen side. The water vapor concentration of the feed humid air decreases dramatically from a range of 18â22 g/m3 to a range of 13.5â18.3 g/m3. Most importantly, the total energy saving is up to 26.2% compared with the conventional air conditioning process.
