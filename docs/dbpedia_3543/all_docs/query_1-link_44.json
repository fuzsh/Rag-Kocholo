Each group included 20 patients. Both groups were similar by age-at-disease-onset, clinical appearances during the disease course and dynamics of psychopathological syndromes. The theta-rhythm is common for CEA and RS at the disease stage with marked signs of disease acuity, autism, regress and, therefore, may be regarded as a marker of severity and development delay. The universality of autism phenomenon in its severe forms was confirmed both at the clinical and neurophysiological levels.\n\nClinical Epidemiology of Buruli Ulcer from Benin (2005-2013): Effect of Time-Delay to Diagnosis on Clinical Forms and Severe Phenotypes.\n\nPubMed\n\nCapela, Carlos; Sopoh, Ghislain E; Houezo, Jean G; FiodessihouÃ©, RenÃ©; Dossou, Ange D; Costa, PatrÃ­cio; Fraga, Alexandra G; Menino, JoÃ£o F; Silva-Gomes, Rita; Ouendo, Edgard M; Rodrigues, Fernando; Pedrosa, Jorge\n\n2015-01-01\n\nBuruli Ulcer (BU) is a neglected infectious disease caused by Mycobacterium ulcerans that is responsible for severe necrotizing cutaneous lesions that may be associated with bone involvement. Clinical presentations of BU lesions are classically classified as papules, nodules, plaques and edematous infiltration, ulcer or osteomyelitis. Within these different clinical forms, lesions can be further classified as severe forms based on focality (multiple lesions), lesions' size (>15 cm diameter) or WHO Category (WHO Category 3 lesions). There are studies reporting an association between delay in seeking medical care and the development of ulcerative forms of BU or osteomyelitis, but the effect of time-delay on the emergence of lesions classified as severe has not been addressed. To address both issues, and in a cohort of laboratory-confirmed BU cases, 476 patients from a medical center in Allada, Benin, were studied. In this laboratory-confirmed cohort, we validated previous observations, demonstrating that time-delay is statistically related to the clinical form of BU. Indeed, for non-ulcerated forms (nodule, edema, and plaque) the median time-delay was 32.5 days (IQR 30.0-67.5), while for ulcerated forms it was 60 days (IQR 20.0-120.0) (p = 0.009), and for bone lesions, 365 days (IQR 228.0-548.0). On the other hand, we show here that time-delay is not associated with the more severe phenotypes of BU, such as multi-focal lesions (median 90 days; IQR 56-217.5; p = 0.09), larger lesions (diameter >15 cm) (median 60 days; IQR 30-120; p = 0.92) or category 3 WHO classification (median 60 days; IQR 30-150; p = 0.20), when compared with unifocal (median 60 days; IQR 30-90), small lesions (diameter â¤15 cm) (median 60 days; IQR 30-90), or WHO category 1+2 lesions (median 60 days; IQR 30-90), respectively. Our results demonstrate that after an initial period of progression towards ulceration or bone involvement, BU lesions become stable regarding size and focal\n\nHigh Levels of Plasmodium falciparum Rosetting in All Clinical Forms of Severe Malaria in African Children\n\nPubMed Central\n\nDoumbo, Ogobara K.; Thera, Mahamadou A.; KonÃ©, Abdoulaye K.; Raza, Ahmed; Tempest, Louisa J.; Lyke, Kirsten E.; Plowe, Christopher V.; Rowe, J. Alexandra\n\n2010-01-01\n\nPlasmodium falciparum rosetting (the spontaneous binding of infected erythrocytes to uninfected erythrocytes) is a well-recognized parasite virulence factor. However, it is currently unclear whether rosetting is associated with all clinical forms of severe malaria, or only with specific syndromes such as cerebral malaria. We investigated the relationship between rosetting and clinical malaria in 209 Malian children enrolled in a case-control study of severe malaria. Rosetting was significantly higher in parasite isolates from severe malaria cases compared with non-severe hyperparasitemia and uncomplicated malaria controls (F2,117 = 8.15, P < 0.001). Analysis of sub-categories of severe malaria (unrousable coma, severe anemia, non-comatose neurological impairment, repeated seizures or a small heterogeneous group with signs of renal failure or jaundice) showed high levels of rosetting in all sub-categories, and no statistically significant differences in rosetting between sub-categories (F4,67 = 1.28, P = 0.28). Thus rosetting may contribute to the pathogenesis of all severe malaria syndromes in African children, and interventions to disrupt rosetting could be potential adjunctive therapies for all forms of severe malaria in Africa.

Against this information, literature data show that the state of Pernambuco presents significant percentage of deaths and hospitalizations due to schistosomiasis, and occurrence of severe clinical forms as schistosomiasis myeloradiculopathy and persistence of localities with high parasite loads. This scenario justified this research which seeking to update the morbidity and mortality of schistosomiasis in Pernambuco. To conduct a temporal analysis on the evolution of deaths, hospital admissions and severe forms of Manson's schistosomiasis over the last 16 years in Pernambuco, Brazil. It was performed a gathering secondary data on schistosomiasis, from healthcare information systems and from the records of Hospital das ClÃ­nicas, Federal University of Pernambuco (HC-UFPE), covering the period from 1999 to 2014. From 1999 to 2013 were registred 2578 deaths due to schistosomiasis and between 2008 and 2014 were recorded 473 hospitalizations for this disease. Among 1999-2014 were identified 1943 cases of schistosomiasis treated at the Hospital das ClÃ­nicas of Pernambuco. Among these cases, 72.6% (n. 1411) of the individuals presented the hepatosplenic clinical form (HE), 60.8% (n. 858) were at the age group 30-59 years (adults) and 58% were female. Among the HE cases, 4.6% (n. 58) had ascites, 43.2% (n. 556) had upper gastrointestinal bleeding and 39.1% (n. 489) had collateral circulation. The pattern of fibrosis in the liver E/EC (advanced fibrosis) and F/FC (very advanced fibrosis) occurred in 65.5% (n. 793) of cases. Between 1999-2014 the evolution curve of severe clinical forms of schistosomiasis remained stable, showing a tendency to decline from 2012. When compared to other states\n\nDevelopment of an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for the serodiagnosis of several clinical forms of sporotrichosis.\n\nPubMed\n\nBernardes-Engemann, A R; Costa, R C Orofino; Miguens, B R; Penha, C V L; Neves, E; Pereira, B A S; Dias, C M P; Mattos, M; Gutierrez, M C; Schubach, A; Oliveira Neto, M P; LazÃ©ra, M; Lopes-Bezerra, L M\n\n2005-09-01\n\nWe performed a serological study with sera from 92 patients with confirmed sporotrichosis registered between 1999 and 2004 in two hospitals in Rio de Janeiro State, Brazil. The clinical presentation of sporotrichosis was distributed as follows: lymphocutaneous, 67%; fixed cutaneous, 23%; disseminated cutaneous, 8%; and extracutaneous, 2%. Sera were assayed by ELISA against a cell wall antigen of Sporothrix schenckii, SsCBF, that we have previously described. The cross-reactivity was determined with 77 heterologous sera. The serological test showed a sensitivity of 90% and a global efficiency of 86%. A group of 55 patients with several clinical presentations of sporotrichosis was clinically and serologically followed-up for at least 6 months. We observed by ELISA data a decrease in the antibody serum titers which correlated with the progress in healing. An HIV-positive patient with meningeal sporotrichosis was serologically followed-up for over 2 years. Serum and cerebrospinal fluid specimens were examined and significant antibodies levels against the antigen SsCBF were detected. Our results strongly suggest that this serological test is valuable for the differential diagnosis and follow-up of all clinical forms of sporotrichosis.\n\nClinical Forms of Chikungunya in Gabon, 2010\n\nPubMed Central\n\nCaron, MÃ©lanie; Grard, Gilda; Mombo, Illich; BikiÃ©, Branly; Paupy, Christophe; Becquart, Pierre; Bisvigou, Ulrich; Leroy, Eric Maurice\n\n2012-01-01\n\nBackground Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) has caused multiple outbreaks in tropical and temperate areas worldwide, but the clinical and biological features of this disease are poorly described, particularly in Africa. We report a prospective study of clinical and biological features during an outbreak that occurred in Franceville, Gabon in 2010. Methodology/Principal Findings We collected, in suspect cases (individuals presenting with at least one of the following symptoms or signs: fever, arthralgias, myalgias, headaches, rash, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, bleeding, or jaundice), blood samples, demographic and clinical characteristics and outcome. Hematological and biochemical tests, blood smears for malaria parasites and quantitative PCR for CHIKV then dengue virus were performed. CHIKV+ patients with concomitant malaria and/or dengue were excluded from the study. From May to July 2010, data on 270 laboratory-confirmed CHIK patients were recorded. Fever and arthralgias were reported by respectively 85% and 90% of patients, while myalgias, rash and hemorrhage were noted in 73%, 42% and 2% of patients. The patients were grouped into 4 clinical categories depending on the existence of fever and/or joint pain. On this basis, mixed forms accounted for 78.5% of cases, arthralgic forms 12.6%, febrile forms 6.7% and unusual forms (without fever and arthralgias) 2.2%. No cases of organ failure or death were reported. Elevated liver enzyme and creatinine levels, anemia and lymphocytopenia were the predominant biological abnormalities, and lymphocytopenia was more severe in patients with high viral loads (pâ=â0.01). Conclusions/Significance During CHIK epidemics, some patients may not have classical symptoms. The existence of unusual forms and the absence of severe forms of CHIK call for surveillance to detect any change in pathogenicity.

Using a prospectively maintained database of patients with acute pancreatitis admitted to a tertiary medical center between 2003 and 2016, those with evidence of persistent OF were classified to renal, respiratory, cardiovascular, or multi-organ (2 or more organs). Data regarding demographics, comorbidities, etiology of acute pancreatitis, and clinical outcomes were prospectively recorded. Differences in clinical outcomes after development of isolated RF in comparison to other forms of OF were determined using independent t and Mann-Whitney U tests for continues variables, and Ï 2 test for discrete variables. Among 500 patients with acute pancreatitis, 111 patients developed persistent OF: mean age was 54 years, and 75 (67.6%) were male. Forty-three patients had isolated OF: 17 (15.3%) renal, 25 (21.6%) respiratory, and 1 (0.9%) patient with cardiovascular failure. No differences in demographics, etiology of acute pancreatitis, systemic inflammatory response syndrome scores, or development of pancreatic necrosis were seen between patients with isolated RF vs isolated respiratory failure. Patients with isolated RF were less likely to require nutritional support (76.5% vs 96%, P = 0.001), ICU admission (58.8% vs 100%, P = 0.001), and had shorter mean ICU stay (2.4 d vs 15.7 d, P < 0.001), compared to isolated respiratory failure. None of the patients with isolated RF or isolated respiratory failure died. Among patients with SAP per the Revised Atlanta Classification, approximately 15% develop isolated RF. This subgroup seems to have a less protracted clinical course compared to other forms of OF. Isolated RF might be weighed less than isolated respiratory failure in risk predictive modeling of acute pancreatitis.\n\nCorrelation between clinical severity and type and degree of pectus excavatum in twelve brachycephalic dogs.\n\nPubMed\n\nHassan, Elham A; Hassan, Marwa H; Torad, Faisal A\n\n2018-05-18\n\nThe aim of the study was to correlate the clinical severity of pectus excavatum with its type and degree based on objective radiographic evaluation. Twelve brachycephalic dogs were included. Grading of the clinical severity was done based on a 6-point grading score. Thoracic radiographs were used to calculate the frontosagittal and vertebral indices at the tenth thoracic vertebra and the vertebra overlying the excavatum. Correlation between the clinical severity score and frontosagittal and vertebral indices was evaluated using Pearson's correlation coefficient. Typical pectus excavatum was recorded in the caudal sternum in seven dogs, with a mean clinical severity score of 1.7 Â± 1.4, whereas in five dogs, atypical mid-sternal deviation was recorded with a mean clinical severity score of 3.8 Â± 0.7. A strong correlation (r=0.7) was recorded between the clinical severity score and vertebral index in the atypical form, whereas a weak correlation (r=0.02) was recorded in the typical form (P<0.05). The clinical severity and degree of pectus excavatum was poorly correlated (r=0.3) in the typical form of pectus excavatum, whereas it was strongly correlated (r=0.9) in the atypical form. Pectus excavatum in dogs is associated with compressive cardiopulmonary dysfunction, which depends mainly on the site/type of deviation rather than the degree of deviation.\n\nSevere Cutaneous Drug Reactions: Do Overlapping Forms Exist?\n\nPubMed\n\nHorcajada-Reales, C; Pulido-PÃ©rez, A; SuÃ¡rez-FernÃ¡ndez, R\n\n2016-01-01\n\nAcute generalized exanthematous pustulosis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms are all severe hypersensitivity reactions to medications. While each of these reactions is a well-established entity with specific diagnostic criteria, clinicians see cases that fulfill criteria for more than one form, prompting discussion on the possibility of combined forms. Such overlapping clinical pictures meeting the criteria for 2 conditions have thus become a topic of debate in dermatology in recent years. We describe 2 patients with cutaneous drug reactions having the characteristics of both acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis and Stevens-Johnson syndrome -toxic epidermal necrolysis. We also review previously published cases and current thinking on such overlapping conditions. Copyright Â© 2015 Elsevier EspaÃ±a, S.L.U. and AEDV.

Search in the Medline database using the terms \"severe food allergy,\" \"anaphylaxis and food allergy,\" \"generalized urticaria and food allergy,\" and \"food protein-induced enterocolitis syndrome\" in the last ten years, searching in the title, abstract, or keyword fields. Food allergy can be serious and life-threatening. Milk, eggs, peanuts, nuts, walnuts, wheat, sesame seeds, shrimp, fish, and fruit can precipitate allergic emergencies. The severity of reactions will depend on associated cofactors such as age, drug use at the onset of the reaction, history and persistence of asthma and/or severe allergic rhinitis, history of previous anaphylaxis, exercise, and associated diseases. For generalized urticaria and anaphylaxis, intramuscular epinephrine is the first and fundamental treatment line. For the treatment in acute phase of food-induced enterocolitis syndrome in the emergency setting, prompt hydroelectrolytic replacement, administration of methylprednisolone and ondansetron IV are necessary. It is important to recommend to the patient with food allergy to maintain the exclusion diet, seek specialized follow-up and, in those who have anaphylaxis, to emphasize the need to carry epinephrine. Severe food allergy may occur in the form of anaphylaxis and food-protein-induced enterocolitis syndrome, which are increasingly observed in the pediatric emergency room; hence, pediatricians must be alert so they can provide the immediate diagnosis and treatment.

Since these analyses are unavailable in routine clinical practice, the aim of this study was to assess clinical, laboratory and radiographic findings associated with clinical presentation of disease severity. A total of 30 patients (27 men and 3 women), average age 40 +/- 14.9 years, treated for hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome from January 1, 1999 to December 31, 2009 in Clinical Center of Serbia, were included in the study. Nine patients (30%) had mild, 14 (46.7%) moderate and 7 (23.3%) severe form of the disease; 24 (800%) recovered, 6 (20%) died in the acute phase of the illness, and 19 patients (63.3%) required hemodialysis. The average titer of antiviral antibodies in patients infected with Belgrade serotype virus were significantly higher in those with severe clinical presentation. Hypotension, anuria, macrohaematuria, pulmonary infiltration, pleural effusion, hepatomegalia and positive meningeal signs were more frequent in the patients with severe form of the disease. Statistically significant differences between groups with mild, moderate and severe clinical picture were found in serum total protein, albumin, calcium, glutamate pyruvate and glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase on admittance; serum creatinine and phosphorus concentration on day 14 and day 21; serum sodium and calciums on day 14; hemoglobine concentration on day 21. A statistically significant correlation was found between clinical presentation of the disease severity and platelet count, white blood cell count, hemoglobine concentration, serum calcium and serum transaminases on admittance. Multivariate analysis identified variables' combinations associated with clinical presentation of the disease. Our study confirmed that we can distinguish patients who will manifest different severities of the disease on the basis of careful\n\nPhenotypic analysis of hemochromatosis subtypes reveals variations in severity of iron overload and clinical disease.\n\nPubMed\n\nSandhu, Kam; Flintoff, Kaledas; Chatfield, Mark D; Dixon, Jeannette L; Ramm, Louise E; Ramm, Grant A; Powell, Lawrie W; Subramaniam, V Nathan; Wallace, Daniel F\n\n2018-05-09\n\nThe clinical progression of HFE-related hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) and its phenotypic variability has been well studied. Less is known about the natural history of non-HFE HH caused by mutations in the HJV , HAMP or TFR2 genes. The purpose of this study was to compare the phenotypic and clinical presentations of hepcidin-deficient forms of HH. A literature review of all published cases of genetically confirmed HJV, HAMP and TFR2 HH was performed. Phenotypic and clinical data from a total of 156 subjects with non-HFE HH was extracted from 53 publications and compared with data from 984 subjects with HFE -p.C282Y homozygous HH from the QIMR Berghofer Hemochromatosis Database. Analyses confirmed that non-HFE forms of HH have an earlier age of onset and a more severe clinical course than HFE HH. HJV and HAMP HH are phenotypically and clinically very similar and have the most severe presentation, with cardiomyopathy and hypogonadism being particularly prevalent findings. TFR2 HH is more intermediate in its age of onset and severity. All clinical outcomes analyzed were more prevalent in the juvenile forms of HH, with the exception of arthritis and arthropathy which were more commonly seen in HFE HH. This is the first comprehensive analysis comparing the different phenotypic and clinical aspects of the genetic forms of HH and the results will be valuable for the differential diagnosis and management of these conditions. Importantly, our analyses indicate that factors other than iron overload may be contributing to joint pathology in subjects with HFE HH.

R.; Gesztesi, J.-L.; del Negro, G. M. B.; Benard, G.; Sato, J.; Santos, M. V. B.; AbrahÃ£o, T. B.; Lopes, J. D.\n\n2000-01-01\n\nParacoccidioidomycosis (PCM) is the most prevalent systemic mycosis in Latin America. Patients with PCM show a wide spectrum of clinical and pathological manifestations depending on both host and pathogen factors. Two clinical forms of the disease are recognized: the acute or juvenile form and the chronic or adult form. The major antigenic component of the parasite is a glycoprotein of 43 kDa (gp43). All patient sera present antibodies against gp43 (anti-gp43) and, as demonstrated before by our group, spontaneous anti-idiotypic (anti-Id) antibodies (Ab2) can be detected in patient sera with high titers of anti-gp43. Since it has been postulated that anti-Id antibodies may have a modulating function, we decided to purify and characterize anti-Id antibodies in this system. The possible correlation of Ab2 titers with different clinical forms of disease was also verified. Results showed that purified human anti-Id antibodies (human Ab2) recognized specifically the idiotype of some murine monoclonal anti-gp43 (17c and 3e) but not others (40.d7, 27a, and 8a). Spontaneous anti-Id antibodies were found in all clinical forms of disease. The majority of patients (88%, n = 8) with the acute form of PCM had high titers of Ab2. However, among patients with the multifocal chronic form of the disease, only 29% (n = 14) had high titers of Ab2; 70% (n = 10) of patients with the unifocal chronic form had low titers of Ab2. A correlation between Ab2 titers and anti-gp43 titers was observed before and during antimycotic treatment. Our results suggest that titers of anti-Id antibodies correlate with the severity of PCM in humans.

Clinical and pathological findings were compatible with a fixed and dynamic obstruction of the left ventricular outflow tract. Gross and microscopic pathological findings were consistent with the most severe form of SAS, described previously in Newfoundland dogs over six months of age. These observations demonstrate that very young asymptomatic puppies may suffer a severe complex form of SAS.\n\n[Clinical forms of secondary syphilis in Cameroun].\n\nPubMed\n\nKoueke, P; Mvele, E D\n\n1978-01-01\n\nClinical lesions of Secondary Syphilis in Negroes are similar to classical descriptions which confirm what Montel postulated (1972) according to which \"Syphilis is almost the same all over\"; the essential difference we discovered lies in the frequencies of clinical forms met.\n\nValidity and Reliability of the Turkish version of DSM-5 Social Anxiety Disorder Severity Scale- Child Form.\n\nPubMed\n\nYalin Sapmaz, Åermin; Ergin, Dilek; Åen Celasin, Nesrin; Karaarslan, Duygu; ÃztÃ¼rk, Masum; Ãzek Erkuran, Handan; KÃ¶roÄlu, ErtuÄrul; Aydemir, Ãmer\n\n2017-12-01\n\nThis study aimed to assess the validity and reliability of the Turkish version of the Diagnostic and statistical manual of Mental Disorders. (5 th ed.) (DSM-5) Social Anxiety Disorder Severity Scale- Child Form. The scale was prepared by carrying out the translation and back translation of the DSM-5 Social Anxiety Disorder Severity Scale - Child Form. The study group consisted of 31 patients that had been treated in a child psychiatry unit and diagnosed with social anxiety disorder and 99 healthy volunteers that were attending middle or high school during the study period. For the assessment, the Screen for Child Anxiety and Related Emotional Disorders (SCARED) was also used along with the DSM-5 Social Anxiety Disorder Severity Scale - Child Form. Regarding reliability analyses, Cronbach's alpha internal consistency coefficient was calculated as 0.941, while item-total score correlation coefficients were measured between 0.566 and 0.866. A test-retest correlation coefficient was calculated as r=0.711. As for construct validity, one factor that could explain 66.0 % of the variance was obtained. As for concurrent validity, the scale showed a high correlation with the SCARED. It was concluded that the Turkish version of the DSM-5 Social Anxiety Disorder Severity Scale - Child Form could be utilized as a valid and reliable tool both in clinical practice and for research purposes.\n\nSevere hyperthyroidism: aetiology, clinical features and treatment outcome.\n\nPubMed\n\nIglesias, P; DÃ©vora, O; GarcÃ­a, J; Tajada, P; GarcÃ­a-ArÃ©valo, C; DÃ­ez, J J\n\n2010-04-01\n\nSevere hyperthyroidism (SH) is a serious medical disorder that can compromise life. There have not been systematic studies in which SH has been evaluated in detail. Here, our aims were: (1) to analyse both clinical and analytical features and outcome in patients with SH and (2) to compare these data with those found in more usual forms of hyperthyroidism. Patients and methods All patients diagnosed of SH (free thyroxine, FT4 > 100 pmol/l, NR: 11-23) seen in our endocrinology clinic in the last 15 years were studied and compared with a sample of patients with mild (mH; FT4, 23-50 pmol/l) and moderate (MH; FT4, 51-100 pmol/l) hyperthyroidism. Aetiology, clinical analytical and imaging data at diagnosis, therapeutic response and outcome were registered. Results A total of 107 patients with overt hyperthyroidism (81 females, mean age +/- SD 46.9 +/- 16.1 years) were evaluated. We studied a historic group with SH (n = 21; 14 females, 40.9 +/- 17.2 years) and, as a comparator group, we analyszed the data of 86 hyperthyroid patients (67 females, 48.4 +/- 15.5.6 years, NS) comparable in age and gender. The comparator group was classified in MH (n = 37, 26 females, 47.2 +/- 16.6 years) and mH (n = 49, 41 females, 49.4 +/- 14.8 years). In comparison with mH group, SH patients were significantly (P < 0.05) younger and showed a greater proportion of first episode of thyroid hyperfunction (P < 0.05). Graves' disease was the main aetiology in the three groups, but patients with SH showed the highest titre of TSH-receptor antibodies (TRAb) (P < 0.001).

The scale was prepared by translating and then back-translating the DSM-5 Dissociative Symptoms Severity Scale. The study groups included one group of 30 patients diagnosed with posttraumatic stress disorder who were treated in a child and adolescent psychiatry unit and another group of 83 healthy volunteers from middle and high schools in the community. For assessment, the Adolescent Dissociative Experiences Scale (ADES) was used in addition to the DSM-5 Dissociative Symptoms Severity Scale. Regarding the reliability of the DSM-5 Dissociative Symptoms Severity Scale, Cronbach's alpha was .824 and item-total score correlation coefficients were between .464 and .648. The test-retest correlation coefficient was calculated to be rÂ =Â .784. In terms of construct validity, one factor accounted for 45.2% of the variance. Furthermore, in terms of concurrent validity, the scale showed a high correlation with the ADES. In conclusion, the Turkish version of the DSM-5 Dissociative Symptoms Severity Scale-Child Form is a valid and reliable tool for both clinical practice and research.\n\nPlasma Biomarkers Discriminate Clinical Forms of Multiple Sclerosis\n\nPubMed Central\n\nTejera-Alhambra, Marta; Casrouge, Armanda; de AndrÃ©s, Clara; Seyfferth, Ansgar; Ramos-Medina, RocÃ­o; Alonso, BÃ¡rbara; Vega, Janet; FernÃ¡ndez-Paredes, Lidia; Albert, Matthew L.; SÃ¡nchez-RamÃ³n, Silvia\n\n2015-01-01\n\nMultiple sclerosis, the most common cause of neurological disability in young population after trauma, represents a significant public health burden. Current challenges associated with management of multiple sclerosis (MS) patients stem from the lack of biomarkers that might enable stratification of the different clinical forms of MS and thus prompt treatment for those patients with progressive MS, for whom there is currently no therapy available. In the present work we analyzed a set of thirty different plasma cytokines, chemokines and growth factors present in circulation of 129 MS patients with different clinical forms (relapsing remitting, secondary progressive and primary progressive MS) and 53 healthy controls, across two independent cohorts. The set of plasma analytes was quantified with Luminex xMAP technology and their predictive power regarding clinical outcome was evaluated both individually using ROC curves and in combination using logistic regression analysis. Our results from two independent cohorts of MS patients demonstrate that the divergent clinical and histology-based MS forms are associated with distinct profiles of circulating plasma protein biomarkers, with distinct signatures being composed of chemokines and growth/angiogenic factors. With this work, we propose that an evaluation of a set of 4 circulating biomarkers (HGF, Eotaxin/CCL11, EGF and MIP-1Î²/CCL4) in MS patients might serve as an effective tool in the diagnosis and more personalized therapeutic targeting of MS patients.

These are essential components in substance abuse treatment for offender populations. This study evaluated a flexible set of 1-page modular assessments known as the TCU Short Forms and compared them with the measures of global domains contained in the Addiction Severity Index (ASI). The sample was based on 540 adult males and females in corrections-based substance abuse treatment services located in Arkansas and Missouri. Results suggest the set of TCU forms and ASI both reliably represent core clinical domains, but TCU Short Forms explained more variance in therapeutic engagement criteria measured during treatment.

The aim of this research was to study distribution patterns and morphological features of AK histological types. Materials and Methods: The study included skin biopsy material from 68 patients with different clinical forms of AK. The diagnosis of AK was histologically confirmed in 100% of cases. Results: There were 63.21% of men and 36.8% of women among all patients with AK. The average age of patients was 73.3 Â± 8.3.The most common clinico-histological forms of actinic keratosis were typical (41.2%), hypertrophic (16.2%), atrophic (14.7%) and pigmentary (11.7%), bowenoid (8.8%), acantholytic (7.4%). Among the rate of epidermal dysplasia there diagnosed cases of KIN Ð (50%), KIN ÐÐ (36.8%) and KIN III (13.2%). Conclusions: It was found a direct correlation between KIN I and typical and pigment forms of AK, KIN II and hypertrophic and bowenoid forms of AK.\n\nInteraction of malaria with a common form of severe thalassemia in an Asian population\n\nPubMed Central\n\nO'Donnell, A.; Premawardhena, A.; Arambepola, M.; Samaranayake, R.; Allen, S. J.; Peto, T. E. A.; Fisher, C. A.; Cook, J.; Corran, P. H.; Olivieri, Nancy F.; Weatherall, D. J.\n\n2009-01-01\n\nIn many Asian populations, the commonest form of severe thalassemia results from the coinheritance of HbE and Î² thalassemia. The management of this disease is particularly difficult because of its extreme clinical diversity; although some genetic and adaptive factors have been identified as phenotypic modifiers, the reasons remain unclear. Because the role of the environment in the course of severe thalassemia has been neglected completely and because malaria due to both Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax has been prevalent in Sri Lanka, we carried out a pilot study of patients with HbE Î² thalassemia that showed high frequencies of antibodies to both parasite species and that 28.6% of the children had DNA-based evidence of current infection with P. vivax. Malarial antibodies then were assessed in patients with HbE Î² thalassemia compared with those in age-matched controls. There was a significant increase in the frequency of antibodies in the thalassemic patients, particularly against P. vivax and in young children. There was also a higher frequency in those who had been splenectomized compared with those with intact spleens, although in the latter it was still higher than that in the controls. The thalassemic patients showed significant correlations between malaria antibody status and phenotype. Patients with HbE Î² thalassemia may be more prone to malaria, particularly P. vivax, which is reflected in their clinical severity. Because P. vivax malaria is widespread in Asia, further studies of its interaction with HbE Î² thalassemia and related diseases are required urgently as a part of ongoing thalassemia control programs.

S.; Pasaribu, S.; Wijaya, H.; Pasaribu, A. P.\n\n2018-03-01\n\nDengue fever is one of the most important emerging vector-borne viral diseases. Approximately 500,000 out of 100 million cases develop to severe dengue infection. Patient with severe dengue (SD) can be predicted by clinical profile, laboratory and warning sign which could be saved by early interventions.This was a retrospective descriptive-analytic study to investigate clinical manifestations, laboratory and warning signs ofchildren with dengue infection in Haji Adam Malik hospital during January 2014âMay 2016. Through medical records, we had selected 140 cases which fulfilled research criteria.Cases were classified as SD (n=28) and NSD (n=112). Most common clinical manifestations for NSD were abdominal pain (39.3%), myalgia (39.3%), headache (37.1%), mucosal bleeding (36.4%) while for SD were shock (15.7%), mucosal bleeding (15.7%), clinical fluid accumulation (15%), shortness of breath (14.3%). SGPT >1000IU/L (5 cases), SGOT >1000IU/L (9 cases), PT (10 cases) and aPTT (16 cases) were abnormal in SD. Severe dengue was frequently found in the range of white cell count 1000-4000/L and platelet count 20,000-50,000mm/uL. Clinical manifestations, warning sign, and laboratoryfinding, were different between SD and NSD.\n\nSub-clinical assessment of atopic dermatitis severity using angiographic optical coherence tomography\n\nPubMed Central\n\nByers, Robert A.; Maiti, Raman; Danby, Simon G.; Pang, Elaine J.; Mitchell, Bethany; CarrÃ©, Matt J.; Lewis, Roger; Cork, Michael J.; Matcher, Stephen J.\n\n2018-01-01\n\nMeasurement of sub-clinical atopic dermatitis (AD) is important for determining how long therapies should be continued after clinical clearance of visible AD lesions. An important biomarker of sub-clinical AD is epidermal hypertrophy, the structural measures of which often make optical coherence tomography (OCT) challenging due to the lack of a clearly delineated dermal-epidermal junction in AD patients. Alternatively, angiographic OCT measurements of vascular depth and morphology may represent a robust biomarker for quantifying the severity of clinical and sub-clinical AD. To investigate this, angiographic data sets were acquired from 32 patients with a range of AD severities. Deeper vascular layers within skin were found to correlate with increasing clinical severity. Furthermore, for AD patients exhibiting no clinical symptoms, the superficial plexus depth was found to be significantly deeper than healthy patients at both the elbow (p = 0.04) and knee (p<0.001), suggesting that sub-clinical changes in severity can be detected. Furthermore, the morphology of vessels appeared altered in patients with severe AD, with significantly different vessel diameter, length, density and fractal dimension. These metrics provide valuable insight into the sub-clinical severity of the condition, allowing the effects of treatments to be monitored past the point of clinical remission.

Clinical characteristics and therapeutic management.\n\nPubMed\n\nMasson, Walter; Rossi, Emiliano; Siniawski, Daniel; Damonte, Juan; Halsband, Ana; Barolo, Ramiro; Scaramal, Miguel\n\n2018-05-19\n\nThe therapeutic management of severe hypertriglyceridaemia represents a clinical challenge. The objectives of this study were 1) to identify the clinical characteristics of patients with severe hypertriglyceridaemia, and 2) to analyse the treatment established by the physicians in each case. A cross-sectional study was carried out using the computerised medical records of all patients>18 years of age with a blood triglyceride levelâ¥1,000mg/dL between 1 January 2011 and 31 December 2016. Clinical and laboratory variables were collected. The behaviour of the physicians in the 6 months after the lipid finding was analysed. A total of 420 patients were included (mean age 49.1Â±11.4 years, males 78.8%). The median of triglycerides was 1,329mg/dL (interquartile range 1,174-1,658). No secondary causes were found in 34.1% of the patients. The most frequent secondary causes were obesity (38.6%) and diabetes (28.1%). Physical activity was recommended and a nutritionist was referred to in 49.1% and 44.2% of the patients, respectively. Secondary causes were identified and attempts were made to correct them in 40.7% of cases. The most indicated pharmacological treatments were fenofibrate 200mg/day (26.5%) and gemfibrozil 900mg/day (19.3%). Few patients received the indication of omega 3 fatty acids or niacin. This study showed, for the first time in our country, the characteristics of a population with severe hypertriglyceridaemia. The therapeutic measures instituted by the physicians were insufficient. Knowing the characteristics in this particular clinical scenario could improve the current approach of these patients. Copyright Â© 2018 Sociedad EspaÃ±ola de Arteriosclerosis.

Secondary analysis of a large prospective observational cohort study. Twenty-five emergency departments participating in the PECARN. Children with minor blunt head trauma and Glasgow Coma Scale scores of at least 14. Treating clinicians completed a structured data form that included injury mechanism (severity categories defined a priori). Clinically important TBIs were defined as intracranial injuries resulting in death, neurosurgical intervention, intubation for more than 24 hours, or hospital admission for at least 2 nights. We investigated the rate of clinically important TBIs in children with either severe injury mechanisms or isolated severe injury mechanisms. Of the 42,412 patients enrolled in the overall study, 42,099 (99%) had injury mechanisms recorded, and their data were included for analysis. Of all study patients, 5869 (14%) had severe injury mechanisms, and 3302 (8%) had isolated severe injury mechanisms. Overall, 367 children had clinically important TBIs (0.9%; 95% CI, 0.8%-1.0%). Of the 1327 children younger than 2 years with isolated severe injury mechanisms, 4 (0.3%; 95% CI, 0.1%-0.8%) had clinically important TBIs, as did 12 of the 1975 children 2 years or older (0.6%; 95% CI, 0.3%-1.1%). Children with isolated severe injury mechanisms are at low risk of clinically important TBI, and many do not require emergent neuroimaging.\n\nVisual form-processing deficits: a global clinical classification.\n\nPubMed\n\nUnzueta-Arce, J; GarcÃ­a-GarcÃ­a, R; Ladera-FernÃ¡ndez, V; Perea-BartolomÃ©, M V; Mora-SimÃ³n, S; Cacho-GutiÃ©rrez, J\n\n2014-10-01\n\nPatients who have difficulties recognising visual form stimuli are usually labelled as having visual agnosia. However, recent studies let us identify different clinical manifestations corresponding to discrete diagnostic entities which reflect a variety of deficits along the continuum of cortical visual processing. We reviewed different clinical cases published in medical literature as well as proposals for classifying deficits in order to provide a global perspective of the subject. Here, we present the main findings on the neuroanatomical basis of visual form processing and discuss the criteria for evaluating processing which may be abnormal. We also include an inclusive diagram of visual form processing deficits which represents the different clinical cases described in the literature. Lastly, we propose a boosted decision tree to serve as a guide in the process of diagnosing such cases. Although the medical community largely agrees on which cortical areas and neuronal circuits are involved in visual processing, future studies making use of new functional neuroimaging techniques will provide more in-depth information. A well-structured and exhaustive assessment of the different stages of visual processing, designed with a global view of the deficit in mind, will give a better idea of the prognosis and serve as a basis for planning personalised psychostimulation and rehabilitation strategies.

Current pharmacogenomic studies of SCARs have made important strides, as the prevention of SCARs, to some extent, appears attainable with the identification of genetic variants for genes encoding drug-metabolizing enzymes and human leukocyte antigens (HLAs). Despite the improvement of incidence, a treatment guideline for this devastating condition is still unavailable, highlighting the inadequacy of contemporary accepted therapeutic interventions. As such, prompt withdrawal of causative drugs is believed to be a priority of patient management. In this review, we discuss recent cutting-edge findings concerning the discovery of biomarkers for SCARs and their clinical utilities in the better prediction and early diagnosis of this disease. The knowledge compiled herein provides clues for future investigations on deciphering additional genetic markers for SCARs and the design of clinical trials for the prospective identification of subjects at genetic risk for this condition, ultimately personalizing the medicine.

Target triglyceride levels associated with clinical benefit for patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia are not currently known. This study evaluates the association between lower follow-up triglyceride levels and incidence of clinical events for patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia. By using claims data from 2 large US healthcare databases, we conducted a retrospective cohort study and identified 41,210 adults with severe hypertriglyceridemia (triglycerides â¥ 500 mg/dL) between June 2001 and September 2010. The date of the first severe hypertriglyceridemia laboratory result was the index date. Patients were categorized into 1 of 5 triglyceride ranges (<200 mg/dL, 200-299 mg/dL, 300-399 mg/dL, 400-499 mg/dL, and â¥ 500 mg/dL) based on a follow-up triglyceride level assessed 6 to 24 weeks after initial triglyceride levels were measured. Adjusted Cox regression models were developed to evaluate the impact of follow-up triglyceride levels on rates of pancreatitis episodes and cardiovascular events. The mean age of patients was 50 years, 72% were male, and the mean follow-up was 825 days. Patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia with follow-up triglyceride levels <200 mg/dL experienced a lower rate of pancreatitis episodes (adjusted incidence rate ratio, 0.45; 95% confidence interval, 0.34-0.60) and cardiovascular events (adjusted incidence rate ratio, 0.71; 95% confidence interval, 0.64-0.78) with some clinical benefit in adults with severe hypertriglyceridemia with follow-up triglyceride levels 200 to 299 mg/dL and 300 to 399 mg/dL (P < .001 for trend). We observed the greatest impact on clinical events among patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia with the lowest follow-up triglyceride levels. Copyright Â© 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Cognitive-mnestic functions, brain MRI (lesion load, cella media index) and clinical severity of ten patients with MELAS syndrome were examined. All patients carried the m.3243A>G mutation. The detailed neuropsychological assessment revealed cognitive deficits in attention, executive function, visuoperception, and -construction. There were significant correlations between these cognitive changes, lesion load in MRI, disturbances in everyday life (clinical scale), and high scores in NMDAS. Patients with MELAS syndrome showed no global neuropsychological deficit, but rather distinct cognitive deficits. Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier B.V. and Mitochondria Research Society.

Existing CRF-related standards encompass structural features of forms and data items, content standards, and specifications for using terminologies. This paper reviews existing standards and discusses their current limitations. Because clinical research is highly protocol-specific, forms-development processes are more easily standardized than is CRF content. Tools that support retrieval and reuse of existing items will enable standards adoption in clinical research applications. Such tools will depend upon formal relationships between items and terminological standards. Future standards adoption will depend upon standardized approaches for bridging generic structural standards and domain-specific content standards. Clinical research informatics can help define tools requirements in terms of workflow support for research activities, reconcile the perspectives of varied clinical research stakeholders, and coordinate standards efforts toward interoperability across healthcare and research data collection.\n\nNoise Maps for Quantitative and Clinical Severity Towards Long-Term ECG Monitoring.\n\nPubMed\n\nEverss-Villalba, Estrella; Melgarejo-Meseguer, Francisco Manuel; Blanco-Velasco, Manuel; Gimeno-Blanes, Francisco Javier; Sala-Pla, Salvador; Rojo-Ãlvarez, JosÃ© Luis; GarcÃ­a-Alberola, Arcadi\n\n2017-10-25\n\nNoise and artifacts are inherent contaminating components and are particularly present in Holter electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring. The presence of noise is even more significant in long-term monitoring (LTM) recordings, as these are collected for several days in patients following their daily activities; hence, strong artifact components can temporarily impair the clinical measurements from the LTM recordings. Traditionally, the noise presence has been dealt with as a problem of non-desirable component removal by means of several quantitative signal metrics such as the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), but current systems do not provide any information about the true impact of noise on the ECG clinical evaluation. As a first step towards an alternative to classical approaches, this work assesses the ECG quality under the assumption that an ECG has good quality when it is clinically interpretable. Therefore, our hypotheses are that it is possible (a) to create a clinical severity score for the effect of the noise on the ECG, (b) to characterize its consistency in terms of its temporal and statistical distribution, and (c) to use it for signal quality evaluation in LTM scenarios. For this purpose, a database of external event recorder (EER) signals is assembled and labeled from a clinical point of view for its use as the gold standard of noise severity categorization. These devices are assumed to capture those signal segments more prone to be corrupted with noise during long-term periods. Then, the ECG noise is characterized through the comparison of these clinical severity criteria with conventional quantitative metrics taken from traditional noise-removal approaches, and noise maps are proposed as a novel representation tool to achieve this comparison. Our results showed that neither of the benchmarked quantitative noise measurement criteria represent an accurate enough estimation of the clinical severity of the noise.

Retrospective case study of records from Thoroughbred foals aged less than 3 months presenting to an ICU as medical emergencies in 2002-12; foals with severe hyponatraemia (serum sodium <122âmmol/L) on admission laboratory data were identified. Data retrieved included signalment, clinical findings, laboratory results, primary diagnosis, treatment and outcome. Severe hyponatraemia was identified in 69/1718 Thoroughbred foals (4%) presenting to the ICU during the study period. Of the 69 foals, 11 (15.9%) presented with neurological signs attributable to hyponatraemic encephalopathy and 7 of these foals had seizures; other neurological signs included obtundation, ataxia and apparent blindness. The three most common primary diagnoses of the 69 foals with severe hyponatraemia were renal disease (18/69, 26.1%), enterocolitis (16/69, 23.2%) and uroperitoneum (15/69, 21.7%). Treatment was directed at the primary disease and correction of the hyponatraemia. A total of 50 of the 69 foals (72.5%) with severe hyponatraemia survived to hospital discharge and 38 of them (76%) survived at least 12 months following discharge. The prevalence of severe hyponatraemia in this study population was 4%. The majority of foals with severe hyponatraemia did not demonstrate direct clinical manifestations as a result of the low serum sodium concentration. The outcome of foals with severe hyponatraemia was mostly favourable.

We cast the task of discovering body site and severity modifiers as a relation extraction problem in the context of a supervised machine learning framework. We utilize rich linguistic features to represent the pairs of relation arguments and delegate the decision about the nature of the relationship between them to a support vector machine model. We evaluate our models using two corpora that annotate body site and severity modifiers. We also compare the model performance to a number of rule-based baselines. We conduct cross-domain portability experiments. In addition, we carry out feature ablation experiments to determine the contribution of various feature groups. Finally, we perform error analysis and report the sources of errors. The performance of our method for discovering body site modifiers achieves F1 of 0.740-0.908 and our method for discovering severity modifiers achieves F1 of 0.905-0.929. Results indicate that both methods perform well on both in-domain and out-domain data, approaching the performance of human annotators. The most salient features are token and named entity features, although syntactic dependency features also contribute to the overall performance. The dominant sources of errors are infrequent patterns in the data and inability of the system to discern deeper semantic structures. We investigated computational methods for discovering body site and severity modifiers in clinical texts.

The immune response against Plasmodium spp. is complex and remains unclear. The present report aimed to better understand the humoral immune response in severe malaria and analyse new immunodominant antigen candidates as possible serological marker in severe malaria in children. This study included children aged 0-16 years from Guinea-Bissau with clinical signs of severe malaria. Serological and immunochemical characterisation of different anti-P. falciparum antibodies were made by ELISA and immunoblotting using a crude protein extract of P. falciparum. Sera from 12 children with severe malaria were analysed. Nine samples were positive for total anti-P. falciparum antibodies, seven for IgM and eight for total IgG anti-P. falciparum. There was a predominance of IgG1 response, suggesting a cytophilic action in severe malaria and a major role of IgG1 over other immunoglobulins. The antigenic profile of P. falciparum showed a consistent immunoblotting pattern of approximately 180â¯kDa, 100â¯kDa and around 50-40â¯kDa. The serological reactivity found in protein bands makes them as immunodominant antigens and promising candidates for serological markers in the context of severe malaria.

This research involved 239 referrals of 11- to 18-year-old youth and their dual-parent families to a non-profit, private community mental health center in a semi-rural Midwest community. Multiple informants (i.e., adolescents and mothers) were used to assess parental aggression and adolescent behavior problems. More than half of clinic-referred adolescents (51%) experienced severe physical aggression and/or high verbal aggression from one or both parents. A pattern of interactive effects of mother-to-adolescent severe physical aggression and verbal aggression on adolescent behavior problems emerged, indicating that when severe physical aggression was present, mother-to-adolescent verbal aggression was positively associated with greater adolescent behavior problems whereas when severe physical aggression was not present, the links between verbal aggression and behavior problems was no longer significant. No interactive effects were found for father-to-adolescent severe physical aggression and verbal aggression on adolescent adjustment; however, higher father-to-adolescent verbal aggression was consistently linked to behavior problems above and beyond the influence of severe physical aggression. The results of this study should promote the practice of routinely assessing clinic-referred adolescents and their parents about their experiences of verbal aggression in addition to severe physical aggression and other forms of abuse.

This approach allows clinical experts, who lack the programming expertise needed to write CGI scripts, to construct and maintain domain-specific knowledge and ordering capabilities within WizOrder, the order-entry and decision support system used at Vanderbilt Hospital. The clinical knowledge base maintainers use HTML editors to create forms and spreadsheet programs for rule entry. A test environment has been developed which uses Netscape to display forms; the production environment displays forms using an embedded browser.

This form of PHPT represents 80% in developed countries. Although PHPT patients are asym-ptomatic, target organ (bone and kidney) involvement is frequently observed. Mild PHPT is associated with a reduction of bone mineral densityand, moreover, with increased risk of vertebral fractures. The extent of a patient evaluation and indications for parathyroidectomy are based on expert guidelines from 2014. Normocalcemic variant of PHPT has been recently recognized, possibly with higher prevalence in general population than the hypercalcemic form of PHPT. Normal but with respect to hypercalcemia inadequately high parathormon levels characterize normohormonal PHPT. If a hereditary form of PHPT is suspected, genetic testing is recommended. Although there are new clinical forms of PHPT, parathyroidectomy still represents the only curative approach to PHPT followed by substantial osteoprotective effect.Key words: asymptomatic form - normocalcemic form - normohormonal form - parathyroidectomy - primary hyperparathyroidism - recent guidelines for the management PHPT.\n\nDiscovering body site and severity modifiers in clinical texts\n\nPubMed Central\n\nDligach, Dmitriy; Bethard, Steven; Becker, Lee; Miller, Timothy; Savova, Guergana K\n\n2014-01-01\n\nObjective To research computational methods for discovering body site and severity modifiers in clinical texts. Methods We cast the task of discovering body site and severity modifiers as a relation extraction problem in the context of a supervised machine learning framework. We utilize rich linguistic features to represent the pairs of relation arguments and delegate the decision about the nature of the relationship between them to a support vector machine model. We evaluate our models using two corpora that annotate body site and severity modifiers. We also compare the model performance to a number of rule-based baselines. We conduct cross-domain portability experiments. In addition, we carry out feature ablation experiments to determine the contribution of various feature groups. Finally, we perform error analysis and report the sources of errors. Results The performance of our method for discovering body site modifiers achieves F1 of 0.740â0.908 and our method for discovering severity modifiers achieves F1 of 0.905â0.929. Discussion Results indicate that both methods perform well on both in-domain and out-domain data, approaching the performance of human annotators. The most salient features are token and named entity features, although syntactic dependency features also contribute to the overall performance. The dominant sources of errors are infrequent patterns in the data and inability of the system to discern deeper semantic structures. Conclusions We investigated computational methods for discovering body site and severity modifiers in clinical texts. Our best system is released open source as part of the clinical Text Analysis and Knowledge Extraction System (cTAKES).

Diabetes insipidus is a clinical syndrome characterized by the excretion of abnormally large volumes of diluted urine (polyuria) and increased fluid intake (polydipsia). The most common type of diabetes insipidus is caused by lack of the antidiuretic hormone arginine vasopressin (vasopressin), which is produced in the hypothalamus and secreted by the neurohypophysis. This type of diabetes insipidus is referred to here as neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus. The syndrome can also result from resistance to the antidiuretic effects of vasopressin on the kidney, either at the level of the vasopressin 2 receptor or the aquaporin 2 water channel (which mediates the re-absorption of water from urine), and is referred to as renal or nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. Differentiation between these two types of diabetes insipidus and primary polydipsia can be difficult owing to the existence of partial as well as complete forms of vasopressin deficiency or resistance. Seven different familial forms of diabetes insipidus are known to exist. The clinical presentation, genetic basis and cellular mechanisms responsible for them vary considerably. This information has led to improved methods of differential diagnosis and could provide the basis of new forms of therapy.\n\nSevere forms of fibromyalgia with acute exacerbation of pain: costs, comorbidities, and length of stay in inpatient care.\n\nPubMed\n\nRomeyke, Tobias; Noehammer, Elisabeth; Scheuer, Hans Christoph; Stummer, Harald\n\n2017-01-01\n\nAs a disease of the musculoskeletal system, fibromyalgia is becoming increasingly important, because of the direct and indirect costs to health systems. The purpose of this study of health economics was to obtain information about staff costs differentiated by service provider, and staff and material costs of the nonmedical infrastructure in inpatient care. This study looked at 263 patients who received interdisciplinary inpatient treatment for severe forms of fibromyalgia with acute exacerbation of pain between 2011 and 2014. Standardized cost accounting and an analysis of additional diagnoses were performed. The average cost per patient was â¬3,725.84, with staff and material costs of the nonmedical infrastructure and staff costs of doctors and nurses accounting for the highest proportions of the costs. Each fibromyalgia patient had an average of 6.1 additional diagnoses. Severe forms of fibromyalgia are accompanied by many concomitant diseases and associated with both high clinical staff costs and high medical and nonmedical infrastructure costs. Indication-based cost calculations provide important information for health policy and hospital managers if they include all elements that incur costs in both a differentiated and standardized way.\n\nPartial clinical response to anakinra in severe palmoplantar pustular psoriasis.\n\nPubMed\n\nTauber, M; Viguier, M; Alimova, E; Petit, A; LiotÃ©, F; Smahi, A; Bachelez, H\n\n2014-09-01\n\nPalmoplantar pustular psoriasis is a clinical psoriasis variant characterised by a high impact on quality of life and poor response to biologics approved for plaque type psoriasis.The recombinant interleukin-1 (IL-1) receptor antagonist anakinra has been recently used for the treatment of isolated refractory cases of generalised pustular psoriasis with contrasted results. To report the clinical response in two patients treated with anakinra as salvage therapy in two patients with severe palmoplantar pustular psoriasis refractory to currently available antipsoriatic systemic therapies. Anakinra was given subcutaneously at the daily dose of 100 mg, and clinical response was evaluated using the palmoplantar psoriasis area and severity index (PPPASI). Only partial and transient responses were observed in both patients, who had to stop anakinra due to lack of efficacy and to side effects. Anakinra appears to provide only partial clinical improvement in refractory palmoplantar pustular psoriasis. Prospective clinical studies on larger populations are warranted to investigate more accurately both efficacy and safety of IL-1-inhibiting strategies in pustular psoriasis.

Here, we assess its correlation with clinical grading using slit-lamp biomicroscopy across varying levels of severity. Methods Retroillumination photographs were conducted of 95 affected corneas with slit-lamp flash photography after pupillary dilation. Individual guttae were counted manually and the position of individual points recorded. Clinical grading using the Krachmer scale was documented for each eye during examination, and regression analyses were performed to identify the strength of association with number of guttae. We assessed range at each stage of clinical grading, and utilized the Mann-Whitney U test to assess whether clinical grading levels demonstrated successively higher numbers of guttae. Results Krachmer score ranged from 1 to 5, with mean of 2.6. Mean numbers of guttae at each level of severity were 289 (1+), 999 (2+), 2669 (3+), 5474 (4+), and 7133 (5+). Each stage demonstrated significantly higher numbers of guttae than its preceding level except from 4+ to 5+ (p=0.30), consistent with the definition of 4+ as the highest level defined by presence of guttae. Higher levels of clinical grading were associated with larger ranges of guttae (p<0.01). A linear regression model resulted in a strong fit between RPA and Krachmer score (r=0.81). Conclusion In this largest study of RPA data and comparison with subjective clinical grading of FCD severity, RPA correlates strongly and demonstrates enhanced definition of severity at advanced stages of disease.

Clinical characteristics and factors of influenza virus contributing to the severity and mortality of pneumonia have not been fully elucidated. Objective : The objective was to clarify clinical characteristics and factors contributing to the severity and mortality of influenza-associated pneumonia ( flu-p ). Methods : We retrospectively analyzed patients with flu-p . Results : From December 1999 to March 2016, 210 patients with a median age of 69 (range, 17 to 92) years with flu-p based on positive rapid antigen tests, increased antibody titers of paired sera, or positive results of reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction were admitted to our institution. A multivariate analysis found that advanced age (â¥ 65 years), pneumonia subtypes (unclassified), diabetes mellitus, and acute kidney injury complicated with flu-p were independent factors associated with disease severity, whereas pneumonia subtypes (mixed viral and bacterial pneumonia and unclassified), healthcare-associated pneumonia, acute kidney injury complicated with flu-p , and severity on admission (severe) were independent factors associated with non-survival. Conclusion : The clinical characteristics of flu-p are varied, and the contribution of several factors to the severity and mortality of flu-p suggest their importance in either preventing flu-p or managing flu-p after it develops.\n\nClinical Characteristics of Influenza-Associated Pneumonia of Adults: Clinical Features and Factors Contributing to Severity and Mortality\n\nPubMed Central\n\nIshiguro, Takashi; Kagiyama, Naho; Uozumi, Ryuji; Odashima, Kyuto; Takaku, Yotaro; Kurashima, Kazuyoshi; Morita, Satoshi; Takayanagi, Noboru\n\n2017-01-01\n\nBackground: Pneumonia is a major complication of influenza that contributes to mortality.

This is despite the fact that past research has indicated some of the relationship behaviors exhibited by insecurely attached individuals represent behaviors indicative of either the perpetration or victimization of less severe forms of sexual coercion. The aim of this study was to conduct a systematic review on the association between attachment style and less severe forms of sexual coercion. Our search, which included published journal papers, book chapters, and theses published between January 1970 and October 2014, yielded 1091 records. Examination of these records against exclusion criteria yielded 11 studies that focused on the associations between attachment orientation and perpetration of sexual coercion (nÂ =Â 3), sexual coercion victimization (nÂ =Â 3), or both perpetration and victimization (nÂ =Â 5). Findings revealed that attachment anxiety appeared to be more consistently associated with being the victim of sexual coercion than attachment avoidance. In terms of perpetration, attachment avoidance was more consistently associated with sexual coercion. These findings were observed when examining the association between attachment dimensions and motives for sexual coercion. The findings also revealed gender to be a moderator for victimization. This review provides insights into how attachment style may influence the perpetration and victimization of sexual coercion.\n\nHow novice, skilled and advanced clinical researchers include variables in a case report form for clinical research: a qualitative study\n\nPubMed Central\n\nChu, Hongling; Zeng, Lin; Fetters, Micheal D; Li, Nan; Tao, Liyuan; Shi, Yanyan; Zhang, Hua; Wang, Xiaoxiao; Li, Fengwei; Zhao, Yiming\n\n2017-01-01\n\nObjectives Despite varying degrees in research training, most academic clinicians are expected to conduct clinical research. The objective of this research was to understand how clinical researchers of different skill levels include variables in a case report form for their clinical research. Setting The setting for this research was a major academic institution in Beijing, China. Participants The target population was clinical researchers with three levels of experience, namely, limited clinical research experience, clinicians with rich clinical research experience and clinical research experts. Methods Using a qualitative approach, we conducted 13 individual interviews (face to face) and one group interview (n=4) with clinical researchers from June to September 2016. Based on maximum variation sampling to identify researchers with three levels of research experience: eight clinicians with limited clinical research experience, five clinicians with rich clinical research experience and four clinical research experts. These 17 researchers had diverse hospital-based medical specialties and or specialisation in clinical research. Results Our analysis yields a typology of three processes developing a case report form that varies according to research experience level. Novice clinician researchers often have an incomplete protocol or none at all, and conduct data collection and publication based on a general framework. Experienced clinician researchers include variables in the case report form based on previous experience with attention to including domains or items at risk for omission and by eliminating unnecessary variables. Expert researchers consider comprehensively in advance data collection and implementation needs and plan accordingly. Conclusion These results illustrate increasing levels of sophistication in research planning that increase sophistication in selection for variables in the case report form. These findings suggest that novice and intermediate\n\nUpper gastrointestinal bleeding caused by severe esophagitis: a unique clinical syndrome.\n\nPubMed\n\nGuntipalli, Prathima; Chason, Rebecca; Elliott, Alan; Rockey, Don C\n\n2014-12-01\n\nWe have recognized a unique clinical syndrome in patients with upper gastrointestinal bleeding who are found to have severe esophagitis. We aimed to more clearly describe the clinical entity of upper gastrointestinal bleeding in patients with severe esophagitis. We conducted a retrospective matched case-control study designed to investigate clinical features in patients with carefully defined upper gastrointestinal bleeding and severe esophagitis. Patient data were captured prospectively via a Gastrointestinal Bleeding Healthcare Registry, which collects data on all patients admitted with gastrointestinal bleeding. Patients with endoscopically documented esophagitis (cases) were matched with randomly selected controls that had upper gastrointestinal bleeding caused by other lesions. Epidemiologic features in patients with esophagitis were similar to those with other causes of upper gastrointestinal bleeding. However, hematemesis was more common in patients with esophagitis 86% (102/119) than in controls 55% (196/357) (p < 0.0001), while melena was less common in patients with esophagitis 38% (45/119) than in controls 68% (244/357) (p < 0.0001). Additionally, the more severe the esophagitis, the more frequent was melena. Patients with esophagitis had less abnormal vital signs, lesser decreases in hematocrit, and lesser increases in BUN. Both pre- and postRockall scores were lower in patients with esophagitis compared with controls (p = 0.01, and p < 0.0001, respectively). Length of hospital stay (p = 0.002), rebleeding rate at 42 days (p = 0.0007), and mortality were less in patients with esophagitis than controls. Finally, analysis of patients with esophagitis and cirrhosis suggested that this group of patients had more severe bleeding than those without cirrhosis. We have described a unique clinical syndrome in patients with upper gastrointestinal bleeding who have erosive esophagitis. This syndrome is manifest by typical clinical features and is associated with\n\nGenetic Susceptibility to Cardiac and Digestive Clinical Forms of Chronic Chagas Disease: Involvement of the CCR5 59029 A/G Polymorphism\n\nPubMed Central\n\nde Oliveira, Amanda Priscila; Bernardo, CÃ¡ssia Rubia; Camargo, Ana VitÃ³ria da Silveira; Ronchi, Luiz SÃ©rgio; Borim, Aldenis Albaneze; BrandÃ£o de Mattos, Cinara CÃ¡ssia; de Campos JÃºnior, Eumildo; Castiglioni, LÃ­lian; Netinho, JoÃ£o Gomes; Cavasini, Carlos EugÃªnio; Bestetti, Reinaldo Bulgarelli; de Mattos, Luiz Carlos\n\n2015-01-01\n\nThe clinical manifestations of chronic Chagas disease include the cardiac form of the disease and the digestive form.

There was a higher frequency of the AA genotype in patients with CCHD compared with patients with the digestive form of the disease and the control group. The results also showed a high frequency of the AG genotype in patients with the digestive form of the disease compared to the other groups. The results of this study show that the CCR5Î32 polymorphism does not seem to influence the different clinical manifestations of Chagas disease but there is involvement of the CCR5 59029 A/G polymorphism in susceptibility to the different forms of chronic Chagas disease. Besides, these polymorphisms do not influence left ventricular systolic dysfunction in patients with CCHD.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between the coffee consumption and clinical severity of psoriasis in a sample of patients stratified according to the presence of the metabolic syndrome (MetS) and smoking. This cross-sectional case-control observational study was conducted on 221 treatment-naÃ¯ve psoriatic patients. Lifestyle habits, anthropometric measures, clinical and biochemical evaluations were obtained. Clinical severity of psoriasis was assessed by Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) score. Data on energy caloric intake and coffee consumption were collected using a 7-day food diary record. The coffee consumption was analyzed as coffee intake (consumers and non-consumers) and daily servings (range 0-4 servings/day). Coffee consumers have a lower PASI score vs non-consumers (pâ<â0.001). The lowest PASI score and MetS prevalence were found in patients consuming 3 cups of coffee/day (pâ<â0.001), which was also the most common daily serving (34.8%), whereas the highest PASI score was found among those drinkingââ¥â4 cups/day. Grouping the case patients according to smoking and MetS, the best odds of PASI score was observed in those drinking 3 cups of coffee per day and no smokers, after adjusting for total energy intake (OR 74.8; pâ<â0.001). As a novel finding, we reported a negative association between coffee intake, MetS prevalence and clinical severity of psoriasis. The evaluation of the anti-inflammatory effect of coffee on clinical severity of psoriasis, whose metabolic risk increases along with its clinical severity, could be of great importance from a public health perspective.\n\nWhat Is Asked in Clinical Data Request Forms? A Multi-site Thematic Analysis of Forms Towards Better Data Access Support\n\nPubMed Central\n\nHanauer, David A; Hruby, Gregory W.; Fort, Daniel G.; Rasmussen, Luke V.; MendonÃ§a, Eneida A.; Weng, Chunhua\n\n2014-01-01\n\nMany academic medical centers have aggregated data from multiple clinical systems into centralized repositories. These repositories can then be queried by skilled data analysts who act as intermediaries between the data stores and the research teams. To obtain data, researchers are often expected to complete a data request form. Such forms are meant to support record-keeping and, most importantly, provide a means for conveying complex data needs in a clear and understandable manner. Yet little is known about how data request forms are constructed and how effective they are likely to be. We conducted a content analysis of ten data request forms from CTSA-supported institutions. We found that most of the forms over-emphasized the collection of metadata that were not considered germane to the actual data needs. Based on our findings, we provide recommendations to improve the quality of data request forms in support of clinical and translational research.

However, no studies have explored whether dysphagia severity has an impact on the success of the session or its outcomes. The current study examined how dysphagia severity impacted on either (a) clinical decision making for safety of oral intake or (b) clinician perceptions of CSEs conducted via telerehabilitation. Subjects and Methods: One hundred patients (25 nondysphagics and 25 mild, 25 moderate, and 25 severe dysphagics) were assessed using a telehealth system and methodology reported in prior research. For each assessment, the online and face-to-face (FTF) clinicians simultaneously completed a structured CSE. On session completion, the online clinician indicated level of agreement with two statements regarding the level of rapport and ability to competently assess the patient. Results: In each of the four groups, acceptable levels of agreement were observed between raters for the three primary outcomes (decisions regarding oral/nonoral intake and safe food and fluids) as well as over 90% of the CSE items. Clinicians agreed they could develop good rapport with the majority of patients in all groups. However, for a small but significant (p<0.5) proportion of patents in the severe dysphagic group, clinicians disagreed they were able to satisfactorily and competently assess to the best of their abilities using the telerehabilitation system. Conclusions: Clinical decisions made during and as an outcome of the total CSE were found to be comparable to those made in the FTF environment regardless of dysphagia severity. Clinicians noted some difficulty assessing patients with greater complexity, which occurred in greater numbers in the group with severe dysphagia.

Likelihood ratio (LR+) and 95% confidence interval (CI): for a clinical score of 0, the LR+ was 2.2 (95% CI = 0.9-5.3); for a clinical score of 1 to 4, the LR+ was 1.3 (95% CI = 0.90-1.74); for a clinical score of 5 to 8, the LR+ was 5.2 (95% CI = 2.2-12.8); for a venous pH <7.32, the LR+ was 7.2 (95% CI = 2.4-21.9); and for serum bicarbonate <18 mmol/L, the LR+ was 11.6 (95% CI = 3.5-38.0). Clinicians may find it useful to incorporate the Clinical Dehydration Scale and laboratory measures into clinical decision-making algorithms to assess dehydration severity in children with acute gastroenteritis.\n\nPoint Prevalence, Clinical Characteristics, and Treatment Variation for Infants with Severe Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia\n\nPubMed Central\n\nGuaman, Milenka Cuevas; Gien, Jason; Baker, Christopher D.; Zhang, Huayan; Austin, Eric D.; Collaco, Joseph M.\n\n2015-01-01\n\nObjectives Despite improvements in survival of preterm infants, bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) remains a persistent morbidity. The incidence, clinical course, and current management of severe BPD (sBPD) remain to be defined. To address these knowledge gaps, a multicenter collaborative was formed to improve outcomes in this population. Study Design We performed a âsnapshotâ in eight neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) on December 17, 2013. A standardized clinical data form for each inpatient born at < 32 weeks was completed and collated centrally for analysis. sBPD was defined as receiving â¥ 30% supplemental oxygen and/or receiving positive pressure ventilation at 36 weeks postmenstrual age (PMA). Results Of a total census of 710 inpatients, 351 infants were born at < 32 weeks and 128 of those (36.5%) met criteria for sBPD. The point prevalence of sBPD varied between centers (11â58%; p < 0.001). Among infants with sBPD there was a variation among centers in the use of mechanical ventilation at 28 days of life (p < 0.001) and at 36 weeks PMA (p = 0.001). We observed differences in the use of diuretics (p = 0.018), inhaled corticosteroids (p < 0.001), and inhaled Î²-agonists (p < 0.001). Conclusion The high point prevalence of sBPD and variable management among NICUs emphasizes the lack of evidence in guiding optimal care to improve long-term outcomes of this high-risk, understudied population.

We retrospectively investigated how to use data from the International Network for Strategic Initiatives in Global HIV Trials, a global clinical influenza research network, to make more accurate case fatality ratio (CFR) estimates early in a future pandemic, an essential part of pandemic response. We estimated the CFR of medically attended influenza (CFRMA) as the product of probability of hospitalization given confirmed outpatient influenza and the probability of death given hospitalization with confirmed influenza for the pandemic (2009-2011) and post-pandemic (2012-2015) periods. We used literature survey results on health-seeking behavior to convert that estimate to CFR among all infected persons (CFRAR). During the pandemic period, 5.0% (3.1%-6.9%) of 561 pH1N1-positive outpatients were hospitalized. Of 282 pH1N1-positive inpatients, 8.5% (5.7%-12.6%) died. CFRMA for pH1N1 was 0.4% (0.2%-0.6%) in the pandemic period 2009-2011 but declined 5-fold in young adults during the post-pandemic period compared to the level of seasonal influenza in the post-pandemic period 2012-2015. CFR for influenza-negative patients did not change over time. We estimated the 2009 pandemic CFRAR to be 0.025%, 16-fold lower than CFRMA. Data from a clinical research network yielded accurate pandemic severity estimates, including increased severity among younger people. Going forward, clinical research networks with a global presence and standardized protocols would substantially aid rapid assessment of clinical severity.
