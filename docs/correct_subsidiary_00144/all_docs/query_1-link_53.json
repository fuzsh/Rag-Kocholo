        "text": "Companies license their technologies to gain a competitive advantage, to bring products to market faster, and to enter new industries. Sometimes, companies also employ technology licensing to simplify the process of building international market share. Companies uses intellectual property, such as patents, to support business and technology objectives by (i) enabling new business opportunities; (ii) driving adoption of standardized technology; (ii) protecting intellectual property holders’ ability to enter new markets and deterring new entrants; and (iii) slowing obsolescence or commoditization of products and technology.\n\nThere are numerous reasons why a company might choose to license its technologies to a foreign firm instead of expanding its presence outside of its home country. Setting up an entity or a business unit in another country requires an understanding of that country’s business and tax laws, as well as a significant outlay of capital. In addition, tariffs between the two countries or other barriers to entry may make it relatively expensive for the company to expand internationally.\n\nTechnology licensing involves fewer restrictions. Instead of dealing with the complexity of setting up a foreign subsidiary or affiliate, companies may simply enter into contractual arrangements to exploit its technology,, product or other IP with a company based in the other country. Such an agreement will need to consider antitrust and tax laws in both nations, as well as differences in intellectual property (IP) laws and regulations, and government attitudes toward expatriation of assets. Technology licensing, however, tends to be less onerous than setting up and operating a foreign subsidiary or affiliate in another country.\n\nCompanies considering an international licensing agreement do need to take a few extra precautions, however. While domestic licensing agreements are formed predominantly for the purposes of developing a synergistic, win-win relationship, international licensing often centers on expanding market share. As such, the two parties may be in direct competition with each other in their respective countries.\n\nConsequently, provisions need to be put in place to protect the interests of both firms. These may include restrictions on how the licensed IP is used, or agreements that any improvements or enhancement to the licensor’s IP will be allocated and granted back between parties. Keep in mind, however, joint ownership is fraught with pitfalls from a legal perspective. For example, to enforce a U.S. patent, all the joint owners must join the suit. If one joint owner wants to sue to enforce the patent, any other joint owner can cut off the suit by granting a license, or by refusing to join. Also, each joint owner can exploit the patent with no duty to share royalties with any other joint owners. One of the simplest alternative to joint ownership involves assigning the foreground IP assets to one party with a field of use license back to the other. You may want to consider including a ownership structure allocating the background IP of each party and the foreground IP (typically refers to the new IP created by one party under the agreement). In the case of a collaborative joint development deal, ownership of the foreground IP could initially vest in the party who develops the foreground IP during the deal. If one party is undertaking most of the development work, it would be appropriate for such party to own the foreground IP, and then grant a license to the other party. The license grant back could be a catch-call broad license, or an “item-by-item” license by field of primary relevance.\n\nDespite the need for some caution, technology licensing continues to form an attractive alternative to international expansion, particularly for smaller businesses. It poses fewer risks, both financially and legally, and allows a company to quickly enter new markets.\n\n—"
