        "text": "Company Highlights:\n\nThe explosive growth of text messages, wireless subscribers and pre-paid services require telecom operators to support increasing amounts of traffic on their networks - and to make sure it gets where it needs to go.

Moat also offers heatmap analytics and resources for creative. Online ads tend to be transient: visible one second and gone the next. Whether you want to see the ads from a particular brand, discover new advertisers, or get inspiration from innovative creative campaigns, the need for a centralized ad search is evident. Enter: Moat. Moat Ad Search is a search engine that focuses entirely on ads instead of other kinds of online content. Similar to traditional search engines, its results are compiled using a web crawler that is specifically tuned to look for ads on the web and index them for later retrieval. Moat also accepts submissions from advertisers and agencies that wish to have their ads included.\n\nShow More\n\nCompany Highlights:\n\nEventus Solutions Group is a nationally recognized consulting and managed services firm made up of experienced professionals that are 100% focused on customer engagement. From the ground up, they have built their firm to fuse strategic planning, technology sourcing and implementation, and day-to-day operational execution exclusively in the contact center and customer engagement arena. With over 200 successful contact center consulting projects delivered, their client list includes some of the most well known brands in healthcare, insurance, retail, communications, government and other industries. The popularity of their services and unique business model has earned us recognition on the Inc. 500 list of the nation's fastest growing private companies. Much of this growth has come from repeat business with existing clients. Their single biggest strength at Eventus is the blend of talent and expertise they offer to their clients. Eventus senior engagement resources have a minimum of 15 years experience in their fields. Most have served at the C-Level or VP-Level in large firms, and most have managed P&L responsibility in customer engagement oriented roles including sales, marketing and service. Their employees hold numerous relevant industry certifications including project management, Six Sigma, CRM, marketing automation and contact center management. When they engage in projects, the teams they deploy are consistently much smaller and much more senior than those typically provided by other firms. Instead of their clients having to teach their consultants about their business, their consultants share insights with their clients about the most cost effective business strategies, implementation methodologies and management practices. This 'special forces' style outcome-focused client delivery model consistently produces on time and on budget projects with no change requests. Finally, since the founding of Eventus, they have maintained a philosophy of being easy to do business with. They are very flexible in terms of contract models and pricing. While they prefer fixed price contracts, they are perfectly willing to work on a time and materials basis when that is their client's preference. Furthermore, they make sure their senior executives create 'high touch' relationships with their clients.\n\nShow More"
