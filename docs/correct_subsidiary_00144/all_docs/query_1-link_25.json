He has over 15 years of consulting experience in IT and Project Management. He has over 75 published papers and presentations and holds two patents. His experience spans manufacturing, supply chain management, industry and national laboratory experience as well as several years focused on electrical utilities. John Simmins holds a B.S. and Ph.D. in engineering. 2\n\n3. About SMECO Southern Maryland Electric Cooperative provides electric service to all of Charles and Our service Territory St. Mary's counties, all but the northern tip of Calvert County, and the southern portion of Prince George's County. The past few years have presented numerous challenges to SMECO – some related to weather, others resulting from technology and operational upgrades. In 2002, SMECO and its customers endured the worst tornado in recent history, and 2003 brought Hurricane Isabel which devastated the communities in SMECO’s service territory. Although there were no natural disasters in 2004, SMECO still had its share of challenges to overcome. Many of those challenges provided opportunities to improve the way SMECO does business. New corporate goals were developed for 2005. These new goals focus on improving customer service, employee performance, and SMECO’s use of technology. 3\n\n4. SMECO Growth 135,000 Southern Maryland is the fastest growing area in Maryland. This reflects SMECO’s steady increase in the number of customers. 130,000 125,000 120,000 115,000 110,000 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 Customers 4\n\n5. SMECO Growth 300 The following chart of the number of meters per employees demonstrates that SMECO is attempting to compensate for growth though improved employee productivity rather than simply 290 increasing employee head-count. 280 270 260 250 240 230 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 Meters per Employee 5\n\n6.

SMECO CIS Project Initial Steps  Evaluate SMECO’s strengths and weaknesses.  Evaluate SMECO’s weaknesses  Develop project management structures, processes and tools that would build on strengths and offset weaknesses. 12\n\n13. SMECO Strengths  Excellent work ethic  Eagerness for change from old CIS system (buy in)  Highly educated employee base  Computer literate managers  Executive buy-in on project management methodology 13\n\n14. SMECO Weaknesses  Communications – tendency toward silos and geographically dispersed departments  Requirements definition – traditionally SMECO has been poor in articulating our requirements  History of owning highly customized software and changing software as perceived requirements changed.  Poor contract negotiation skills 14\n\n15. Project Management Tools  Established a PMO and structure to facilitate control and communication.  Co-located resources to one area.  Established several communications media:  Website  Weekly reports  Weekly status meetings with stakeholder, sponsors and project team leaders 15\n\n16. Project Management Tools  Established and communicated the roles and responsibilities (these changed for each phase of the project).  Pushed much of the configuration, data definition, reports specification and writing to the team leads.  Put the “A” team on the project – the best and brightest managers and employees were used.  Established a rigorous change management process for the project. 16\n\n17. Project Management Tools  Established a numerically based rating system for choosing vendors (procurement partners, software, implementation and integration).  Used a procurement partner in requirements analysis, vendor selection and contract negotiation. 17\n\n18. SMECO Engaged Advisory Services  Key success factors:  Must fill in where SMECO is weak  Adequately determine SMECO’s requirements  Adequately convey SMECO’s requirements to vendors  Establish correct rating structure of requirements  Accurately rate vendors to show differences 18\n\n19. Engaged Advisory Services – CIS Selection Criteria  Large client base  Demonstrated competence in ELECTRICAL utilities  Come to the table with a methodology  Come to the table with typical requirements  Can meet the tight time frames  Vendor independence 19\n\n20. Product RFP Process  Survey the current market  Only deal with Tier 1 vendors  Requirements analysis  Requirements rating  RFP solicitation  RFP response  “Trade Show” multiple vendor demonstrations  Vendor scoring  Short list  Vendor demonstrations  Reference checks/site visits  Selections/communication to vendors 20\n\n21. Integration RFP Process  Survey the current market  Only deal with Tier 1 vendors  RFP solicitation  Vendor scoring  Technical capabilities  Track record  Comfort/fit with the organization  Reference checks/site visits  Selections/communication to vendors 21\n\n22. Product Key Success Factors  Ability to perform on time  Work within established budget  Ability to comply with retail choice requirements 22\n\n23.

Current Wide Area Network SMECO’s current WAN is as shown. SMECO's WAN is comprised of four nodes with the Hughesville campus serving as the data center. Each Regional office has its own domain controller / file server, but relies on the WAN to provide access to SMECO's business applications. 25 1\n\n26.

Primary Business Drivers SMECO had six primary drivers that influenced the team’s decisions and selections as they progressed through the CIS selection process. 1. The new CIS will be a customer-centric product software solution. 1. The new solution will be technically and functionally upgradeable. 1. The project would procure all necessary hardware, software and services required for a successful installation effort. 1. SMECO would minimize product modifications allowing SMECO to quickly implement the new product and take advantage of regular product releases. All non-critical go-live enhancements/interfaces will be placed into subsequent project phases. 1. Retail Choice may require some modifications to ensure compliance with Maryland laws, with the goal that the system be flexible and the vendor be responsive to requests for changes. 1. SMECO will initiate a Business Process Redesign or change management effort as part of the installation process focusing on the redesign of critical business functions. 27\n\n28.
