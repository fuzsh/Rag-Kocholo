He says it will combine meter data management, load profiling, pricing, marketing, sales, customer care, billing, analytics and management of the networks, work force, assets and business-to-business transactions. “Oracle is putting utilities in control by simplifying their infrastructure, enabling greater business insight, aiding process improvement and increasing customer satisfaction and loyalty” he adds. “We expect our combined solutions will help facilitate the transformation of utilities to leading-edge infrastructure that creates operational efficiencies and competitive advantage for our customers.”\n\nComments"
