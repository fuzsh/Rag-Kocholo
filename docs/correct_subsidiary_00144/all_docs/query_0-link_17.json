Larry Hagewood will lead the unit as General Manager.\n\nSPL was purchased from private equity funds managed by GFI Energy Ventures LLC. Terms of the transaction were not disclosed.\n\nWorking with systems-integration and technology partners around the world, SPL (www.splwg.com) delivers software applications that help utilities achieve competitive advantage and excellence in business performance, while ensuring a lower total cost of technology ownership. SPL solutions in customer care and billing, enterprise asset and work management, mobile workforce management, and outage and distribution management are specifically designed for energy, water, and service companies.\n\nOracle (www.oracle.com) is one of the world's largest enterprise software companies.\n\n---\n\nAlso see:\n\n-- \"Oracle Buys Stellent: Accelerates Enterprise Content Management Strategy with Industry Leading Products\"\n\n-- \"Finalists in Leading Analyst Firm's CRM Excellence Awards are Oracle Customers: Customer BNSF Wins Honors for Excellence in Enterprise CRM\""
