        "text": " Up to 98% energy recovery efficiency. The PX device achieves high efficiency by minimizing energy loss. The tight fit between the ceramic components in a PX device minimizes leakage inside the device. In addition, the flow paths through the device are relatively open such that losses due to friction are minimized. Because losses are minimized, the energy output of the PX device is only slightly less than the energy input. This ratio is measured in terms of efficiency.  Proprietary design employing only one moving part. The only moving part in the PX device is the ceramic rotor, which is surrounded by a ceramic sleeve and two end covers. The narrow gap between the rotor and surrounding components fills with high-pressure water which serves as a nearly frictionless hydrodynamic bearing. The combination of the extreme durability of ceramic and the low-friction bearing design results in very little wear over time.  Corrosion resistant, highly durable ceramic composition. The advanced ceramic material used in the PX device is corrosion resistant, rigid and three times stronger than steel. This allows us to design the rotor and the sleeve to have and maintain narrow clearances despite the high operating pressures to which these devices are exposed and speeds at which they operate. These narrow clearances allow sea water to act as a lubricant, minimizing wear and leakage losses.  Small footprint, modular design and system redundancy. Our PX devices are available in a range of standard product sizes. Higher capacities are achieved by arranging multiple devices in parallel. Customers specify the number of devices necessary for a given application, and additional capacity is provided by adding units. Further, due to the parallel arrangement of the PX devices, if one PX unit in an array should fail, the desalination plant can continue to operate.  Lower life cycle cost versus competitors. Some of our competitors may price their energy recovery devices below that of our product. However, because of the PX devices high efficiency, durability, corrosion resistance, and modular design that allows for system redundancy, resulting in minimal plant shutdowns for PX device maintenance, we believe our product is the most cost effective energy recovery device alternative in the long term.\n\n Unique and efficient product. Our uniquely designed product offers several significant benefits to our customers and advantages over competing products. We manufacture the only commercially available rotary isobaric energy recovery device, which we believe is more effective at recovering and recycling energy than any other commercially available energy recovery device. The PX device incorporates highly-engineered corrosion resistant ceramic parts and a modular design that minimizes product maintenance and helps prevent plant shutdowns. Our rotary device has only one moving part and a continuous flow design, which complements the continuous flow of the SWRO process. This contrasts with competing isobaric energy recovery devices that utilize an alternating flow process with various moving parts more susceptible to wear, and which may require plant shutdowns for maintenance and part replacement. We believe these unique benefits lead to lower life cycle costs than competing products.  Leading position in a rapidly growing industry. The combination of decreasing fresh water supplies, increasing fresh water demand and declining SWRO desalination costs is driving growth in the SWRO desalination industry. We believe we are the largest global supplier of energy recovery devices for SWRO, the fastest growing segment of the desalination market. According to GWI, the share of total new contracted sea water desalination capacity using SWRO has increased from approximately 42% in 1999 to approximately 71% in 2006.  Rapid growth. Our net revenue increased from $4.0 million in 2003 to $35.4 million in 2007, representing a compound annual growth rate of 72%, driven by the rapid growth of the SWRO desalination industry and our increased penetration of this market. Our sales growth has enabled us to leverage our existing manufacturing cost base. We are developing several new products to provide additional cost and performance advantages. Additionally, as our installed base of PX devices ages and the number of installed units increases, we expect sales of replacement PX parts and services to increase.  High barriers to entry. Historically, there has been a slow adoption rate for new technologies in the desalination industry. We have spent the last 11 years penetrating the market and establishing our company and product with major industry participants. Over this period, our PX device has been increasingly adopted into the standard plant specifications of many of the leading SWRO desalination plant designers. We have five U.S. and nine international counterpart patents covering specific design features of the PX device. In addition, we have developed significant know-how related to ceramic processing methods essential to the manufacturing, reliability and performance of the PX device.  Diversified international blue chip customer base. Currently, most of our revenue has been derived from sales to large EPCs such as Acciona Water, Doosan Heavy Industries, Geida and GE Ionics. In addition, we are specified in plant designs by over 60 OEMs and EPCs worldwide and have sold PX devices to approximately 250 other customers, including small and mid-tier OEMs, hotel operators, power plants and municipalities.  Strong, experienced management team. Our senior management team has significant industry experience in the design, construction and operation of SWRO desalination plants and the filtration industry. Our chief executive officer, G.G. Pique, joined us in 2000 after serving for seven years as the group vice president Latin America of US Filter Corporation (subsequently acquired by Vivendi) and has over 30 years of experience in the water treatment industry. He has built the management team, driven the customer first corporate culture and engineered the strategy leading to global acceptance of PX technology.\n\n Continue to broaden our product portfolio. We are developing new products that should continue to grow our market share and meet the increasing demands of our clients. As the SWRO market moves towards increasingly larger desalination plants, we are developing products designed to address these larger volume plants. Specifically, we have developed a product, the PX-1200 Titan, that is expected to provide a five-fold increase in water flow capacity from that of our largest current PX device. For customers who are more sensitive to up-front costs and who operate smaller plants, we are developing the Comp PX device. We also intend to expand our product portfolio to include additional circulation/booster pumps (internal or private label) and a bundled turnkey solution for customers that would include both a PX device and pump.  Increase our aftermarket sales. Over time, components of our PX device will need to be repaired or replaced. Thus, as our installed base of PX devices ages and the number of installed units increases, we expect aftermarket sales of replacement PX parts and services to increase. We are also considering formulating a service contract model and strategic stocking centers to help drive additional aftermarket sales.  Capitalize on growth opportunities in alternative power and other emerging sectors. We are diversifying our energy recovery offerings to capitalize on growth opportunities in emerging sectors. For example, osmotic power generation utilizes a process similar to that of SWRO and is a clean, alternate source of power currently under development. We are participating in an osmotic power pilot test facility being designed by a European utility company that may use PX technology. In addition, the PX device could potentially be applied in any process that has a high-pressure waste stream including chemical and petroleum processing. Also, participants in the growing brackish water reverse osmosis desalination market are increasingly interested in reducing energy consumption through the use of energy recovery devices such as our PX device.\n\n Cross-training. Our manufacturing employees are cross-trained in different functionalities. This practice reduces downtime while creating a knowledge buffer to ensure a reliable production flow. As needed, additional personnel can be focused on specific time-sensitive tasks.  Collaboration. We emphasize new product development to keep us on the cutting edge of pressure exchange technology while continuously improving existing products.  Outsourcing. Outsourcing allows us to concentrate on the final in-house finishing and grinding of ceramic components. Key proprietary information is kept in-house, preventing technology from passing outside of our company. Our manufacturing capacity can increase throughput without requiring additional units of labor and equipment.  Multiple-vendor Strategy. To prevent supply chain disruption, improve supplier pricing concessions and ensure timely customer order fulfillment, we have expanded the scope of our vendor relationships. We utilize three outside ceramic vendors and are currently qualifying a fourth to establish an additional supplier of unfinished, PX-220/PX-260 rotors and sleeves. Because the ceramic components of our products are vital to the operation of our business, our selection of ceramic vendors entails a rigorous qualification process.  Quality Control. Purchased materials must conform to our design specifications, go through a thorough receiving inspection as specified in our quality procedures and be delivered with material certifications. A quality assurance inspection report is completed and accepted prior to any material being placed into inventory. Ceramic components are inspected for cracks and defects, as well as to ensure they meet exacting size and dimension specifications, following any in-house production operation. Critical components such as housings, ports and ceramic components are marked with serial numbers for traceability. Assembled PX and booster pump models and ceramic cartridges are subjected to specific performance testing to ensure they comply with our standards and customer requirements.\n\n(1) This option was granted under the 2006 Stock Option/Stock Issuance Plan, or the 2006 Plan, on December 9, 2006 and vests for a period of four years beginning December 9, 2006.

Furthermore, the branch profits tax discussed above may also apply if the non-U.S. holder is a corporation;  the non-U.S. holder is an individual and is present in the United States for 183 days or more in the taxable year of disposition and certain other tests are met, in which case a non-U.S. holder will be subject to a flat 30% tax on any gain realized upon the sale or other disposition, which tax may be offset by United States source capital losses (even though the individual is not considered a resident of the United States); or  we are or have been a United States real property holding corporation (a USRPHC) for United States federal income tax purposes at any time within the shorter of the five-year period preceding the disposition and the non-U.S. holders holding period. We do not believe that we are a USRPHC, and we do not anticipate becoming a USRPHC. If we are or were to become a USRPHC at any time during this period, generally gains realized upon a disposition of shares of our common stock by a non-U.S. holder that did not directly or indirectly own more than 5% of our common stock during this period would not be subject to United States federal income tax, provided that our common stock is regularly traded on an established securities market (within the meaning of Section 897(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code). Our common stock will be treated as regularly traded on an established securities market during any period in which it is listed on a registered national securities exchange or any over-the-counter market.\n\n Stabilizing transactions permit bids to purchase the underlying security so long as the stabilizing bids do not exceed a specified maximum.  Over-allotment involves sales by the underwriters of shares in excess of the number of shares the underwriters are obligated to purchase, which creates a syndicate short position. The short position may be either a covered short position or a naked short position. In a covered short position, the number of shares over-allotted by the underwriters is not greater than the number of shares that they may purchase in the over-allotment option. In a naked short position, the number of shares involved is greater than the number of shares in the over-allotment option. The underwriters may close out any covered short position by either exercising their over-allotment option and/or purchasing shares in the open market.  Syndicate covering transactions involve purchases of the common stock in the open market after the distribution has been completed in order to cover syndicate short positions. In determining the source of shares to close out the short position, the underwriters will consider, among other things, the price of shares available for purchase in the open market as compared to the price at which they may purchase shares through the over-allotment option. If the underwriters sell more shares than could be covered by the over-allotment option, a naked short position, the position can only be closed out by buying shares in the open market. A naked short position is more likely to be created if the underwriters are concerned that there could be downward pressure on the price of the shares in the open market after pricing that could adversely affect investors who purchase in the offering.  Penalty bids permit the representatives to reclaim a selling concession from a syndicate member when the common stock originally sold by the syndicate member is purchased in a stabilizing or syndicate covering transaction to cover syndicate short positions.  In passive market making, market makers in the common stock who are underwriters or prospective underwriters may, subject to limitations, make bids for or purchases of our common stock until the time, if any, at which a stabilizing bid is made.\n\n it has not offered and will not make an offer of the common stock to the public in the United Kingdom prior to the publication of a prospectus in relation to the common stock and the approval of the offer by the Financial Services Authority, or, FSA or, where appropriate, approval in another Member State and notification to the FSA, all in accordance with the Prospectus Directive, except that it may make an offer of the stock to persons who fall within the definition of qualified investor as that term is defined in Section 86(1) of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000, or FSMA, or otherwise in circumstances which do not result in an offer of transferable securities to the public in the United Kingdom within the meaning of the FSMA;  it has only communicated or caused to be communicated and will only communicate or cause to be communicated any invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity (within the meaning of Section 21 of the FSMA) received by it in connection with the issue or sale of any stock in circumstances in which Section 21(1) of the FSMA does not apply to us or to persons who have professional experience in matters relating to investments falling within Article 19(5) of the FSMA; and  it has complied and will comply with all applicable provisions of the FSMA with respect to anything done by it in relation to the stock in, from or otherwise involving the United Kingdom.\n\n(1) to legal entities which are authorized or regulated to operate in the financial markets or, if not so authorized or regulated, whose corporate purpose is solely to invest in securities; (2) to any legal entity which has two or more of (a) an average of at least 250 employees during the last financial year; (b) a total balance sheet of more than 43,000,000 and (c) an annual net turnover of more than 50,000,000, as shown in its last annual or consolidated accounts; or (3) in any other circumstances which do not require the publication by the issuer of a prospectus pursuant to Article 3 of the Prospectus Directive. For the purposes of this paragraph, the expression an offer of common stock to the public in relation to any common stock in any Relevant Member State means the communication in any form and by any means of sufficient information on the terms of the offer and the common stock to be offered so as to enable an investor to decide to purchase or subscribe the common stock, as the same may be varied in that Member State by any measure implementing the Prospectus Directive in that Member State and the expression Prospectus Directive means Directive 2003/71/EC and includes any relevant implementing measure in each Relevant Member State.\n\n The registrant shall indemnify its directors and officers for serving the registrant in those capacities or for serving other business enterprises at the registrants request, to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law. Delaware law provides that a corporation may indemnify such person if such person acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the registrant and, with respect to any criminal proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe such persons conduct was unlawful.  The registrant may, in its discretion, indemnify employees and agents in those circumstances where indemnification is not required by law.  The registrant is required to advance expenses, as incurred, to its directors and officers in connection with defending a proceeding, except that such director or officer shall undertake to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such person is not entitled to indemnification.  The registrant will not be obligated pursuant to the bylaws to indemnify a person with respect to proceedings initiated by that person, except with respect to proceedings authorized by the registrants board of directors or brought to enforce a right to indemnification.  The rights conferred in the bylaws are not exclusive, and the registrant is authorized to enter into indemnification agreements with its directors, officers, employees and agents and to obtain insurance to indemnify such persons.  The registrant may not retroactively amend the bylaw provisions to reduce its indemnification obligations to directors, officers, employees and agents.\n\nExhibit\n\nDescription 1 .1* Form of Underwriting Agreement 3 .1** Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Registrant, as currently in effect 3 .1.1 Form of Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of Registrant, to be in effect upon the completion of this offering 3 .2** Bylaws of Registrant 3 .2.1** Amendment to Bylaws of Registrant 3 .2.2 Form of Amended and Restated Bylaws of the Registrant, to be effective upon closing of the offering 4 .1* Specimen Common Stock Certificate of the Registrant 5 .1* Opinion of Baker & McKenzie LLP 10 .1 Form of Indemnification Agreement between Registrant and its directors and officers 10 .2** 2001 Stock Option Plan of Registrant and form of Stock Option Agreement thereunder 10 .3** 2002 Stock Option/Stock Issuance Plan of Registrant and forms of Stock Option and Stock Purchase Agreements thereunder 10 .4** 2004 Stock Option/Stock Issuance Plan of Registrant and forms of Stock Option and Stock Purchase Agreements thereunder 10 .5** 2006 Stock Option/Stock Issuance Plan of Registrant and forms of Stock Option and Stock Purchase Agreements thereunder 10 .5.1** Amendment to 2006 Stock Option/Stock Issuance Plan of Registrant 10 .5.2** Second Amendment to 2006 Stock Option/Stock Issuance Plan of Registrant 10 .6 2008 Equity Incentive Plan of Registrant, to be in effect upon the completion of this offering, and form of Stock Option Agreement thereunder 10 .7** Employment Agreement dated March 1, 2006 between Registrant and G.G.
