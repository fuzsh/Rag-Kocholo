        "text": "Oracles annual OpenWorld conference and exhibition organized at Moscone\n\nCenter in downtown San Francisco made big headlines in November. Not without\n\nreasons. One, 2007 marks the 30th anniversary of Oracle (founded by Bob Miner,\n\nLarry Ellison and Ed Oates as Software Development Labs in 1977). Also, as\n\nEllison reminisced on a 30-year flashback tour, it marks the 10th death\n\nanniversary of Miner (widely regarded as the heart of Oracle).\n\nAdvertisment\n\nMore importantly, even by the gargantuan standards of the worlds second\n\nlargest software company, this years OpenWorld with nearly 43,000 attendees was\n\nmassive. It probably is the worlds largest event targeted at enterprises and\n\nhow they can harness the powers of IT to facilitate their business performances.\n\nNot just managing the 43,000 attendees, Oracle also managed to rope in most\n\nof the large tech vendors as co-sponsors. Thus, not only did AMD, Dell, Intel,\n\nSun, HP, NetApp, EMC sponsor the show, among others, industry leaders like\n\nHector Ruiz (AMD), Mark Hurd (HP), Michael Dell (Dell), Paul Otellini (Intel)\n\nand Jonathan Schwartz (Sun) delivered keynote sessions, besides senior Oracle\n\nexecutives.\n\nThe exhibitor list virtually included the entire Whos Who of the tech world.\n\nSurprise, surprise, the exhibition hall even included a stall by SAPlooks like\n\nthe software leaders mutually acknowledge and appreciate each others strengths.\n\nAdvertisment\n\nEven by the gargantuan standards\n\nof the worlds second largest software company, this years Oracle OpenWorld\n\nwith nearly 43,000 attendees was massive\n\nA large portion of the Indian presence was Indian employees of Oracle and its\n\nsponsor partners in the US, a number of Indian partners and customers of Oracle\n\ntoo turned up. The likes of Infosys, Zensar, TCS, Satyam, Cognizant, Systime had\n\nexhibition stalls while large customers like Genpact, Hindalco, Jindal Steel and\n\nL&T were present too.\n\nOracle pronounced its commitment to greener IT also through OpenWorld. To\n\nreduce carbon emission, it took small but significant measures like not\n\nproviding plastic water bottles to every attendee. Instead, every participant\n\nwas provided an empty bottle of recyclable material and sufficient numbers of\n\nwater containers put up at the venue. Paper press releases and conference\n\nagendas were reduced; from next OpenWorld it would be completely transferred\n\nonline. One of the participants, Deloitte Consulting, was specifically lauded\n\nfor putting up a paperless show.\n\nAdvertisment\n\nVertically Challenging!\n\nNot content with just gaining expertise in different applications, Oracle is\n\ndoing it across multiple verticals through acquisitions.\n\nSpeaking at the Oracle Industry Leaders Media Roundtable at the sidelines of\n\nOracle OpenWorld, Rajesh Hukku, general manager and senior VP of Oracles FSGBU\n\nand chairman, i-flex hinted that the i-flex brand would probably be subsumed by\n\nthe stronger Oracle brand in the near future. Though brand change is a\n\nmarketing decision, ultimately it makes sense to maintain the bigger umbrella\n\nbrand. However, individual i-flex product brands like Flexcube, Revelus and\n\nothers would continue to exist, added Hukku.\n\nOracle currently holds 83% of i-flexs shares and has been consistently\n\ntrying to acquire the rest in a bid to delist i-flex from the Indian bourses. It\n\nwould require a little over 90% of shares to do so. The move will help it to\n\nintegrate i-flex with its business worldwide. Hukku, however, declined to\n\ncomment on the open offer issue or timing.\n\nAdvertisment\n\nLarry Ellison reminiscing on 30 years of Oracle:\n\nOracle was founded by Bob Miner, Larry Ellison, and Ed Ontes as Software\n\nDevelopment Labs in 1977\n\nFSGBU Flexes Muscle\n\nToday, Oracles FSGBU is present in 120 countries, including a large number\n\nof developed markets. It boasts of marquee clients in first world markets like\n\nAllied Irish Bank, Barclays Bank, Deutsche Bank and UBS amongst others.\n\nIn North America too it is particularly strong with its Revelus product for\n\nRisk and Compliance; four out of Top 10 banks including Wells Fargo and Wachovia\n\namongst others are its customers.\n\nAdvertisment\n\nIn line with Oracle president Charles Philips assertion earlier in the day\n\nabout the importance of the Application Integration Architecture, Hukku agreed\n\nthat FSGBUs prime mandate at present is to integrate the best-of-breed\n\nsolutions. While the Oracle Fusion Middleware would provide the horizontal\n\napplication stack, we are providing applications that incorporate the business\n\nprocesses.\n\nA Tale of Retail\n\nOracle Retail has come a long way with 1,900 customers, incorporating\n\nmerchandise and supply chain solutions from Retek; profit optimization solutions\n\nfrom ProfitLogic; enterprise applications; middleware and database technologies\n\nfrom Oracle; store solutions from 360Commerce; human capital management from\n\nPeopleSoft; and transportation management and logistics from G-Log.\n\nThe continuing depreciation of the US dollar and rising oil prices could soon\n\nhit the retail market, even though the impending festival season is almost there\n\nstarting from Thanksgiving.\n\nAdvertisment\n\nThe challenge for our solution would be to help retailers better manage\n\ntheir businesses in such a scenario, especially to help them cut corners with\n\nmore efficient management of their supply chain and other business processes,\n\nreminded Angove.\n\nTelecom, Utilities Gain Ground\n\nBhaskar Gorti, senior VP and general manager, Oracles Communications GBU and\n\nQuentin Grady, senior VP and general manager, Oracles Utilities GBU were also\n\npresent in the interaction.\n\nWhile Gorti welcomed the boom in telecom sector worldwide contributing to the\n\nbusiness, he mapped the differing growth patterns in distinct geographies. In\n\ndeveloped markets like North America, where mobile penetration itself is much in\n\nexcess of 100%, Oracle applications help telcos and related communications\n\ncompanies to manage the complexities created thereof.\n\nAdvertisment\n\nWhile eight of the worlds top ten mobile operators run Oracle applications,\n\nin India too 90% of telecom operators including the likes of Bharti are\n\npartnering Oracle.\n\nAccording to Grady, on the other hand, the biggest challenge for Oracle\n\napplications in the utilities sector has been to successfully mitigate the\n\nvarious challenges of different deregulations in the last few months. Oracles\n\npursuit for excellence in the utilities sector (here it lagged behind SAP)\n\nstarted with the acquisition of SPL WorldGroup, known for its revenues and\n\noperations management expertise in utilities and gained further thrust with the\n\nacquisition of Lodestar earlier this year."
