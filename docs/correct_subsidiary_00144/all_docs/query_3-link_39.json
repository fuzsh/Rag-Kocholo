        "text": "Oracle, working with other technology vendors, has launched an open-framework initiative to develop software to protect identity-related employee, customer and partner information, the company said Wednesday.\n\nOracle is inviting technology vendors and customers to review plans for the Identity Governance Framework (IGF) and contribute to key draft specifications, the company said in a news release. Five technology vendors, including CA, Sun Microsystems and Novell, have already reviewed a draft of the framework and plan to work with Oracle to develop full specifications, Oracle said.\n\nThe project, based on XML, comes as security vendors look for ways to help businesses and government agencies avoid adding to a rash of security breaches during the past two years. Oracle rolled out a piece of its own identity management software suite, called Oracle Identity Manager 10g R3, in May.\n\nIGF will be designed to protect identity information as it flows across several applications, the company said. Identity-related information is often embedded in numerous applications across organizations, placing the information at risk and creating potential privacy violations, Oracle said.\n\nThe goal of IGF will be to establish a standard way of defining organization-wide policies to share sensitive personal information securely between applications, Oracle said.\n\nOracle understands the challenges its customers face in trying to manage and secure identity-related information and knows that it is increasingly important to establish policies regarding such information, said Hasan Rizvi, Oracleâ€™s vice president of identity management and security products, in a statement."
