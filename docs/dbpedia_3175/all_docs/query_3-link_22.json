        "text": "Thanks for bringing this up with Microsoft. Again. I did vote for your request.\n\nWhile you’re waiting for MS to update PowerPoint rendering code older than every current programmer maintaining it, try the free LibreOffice Impress. Once you select the font, add a colon, followed by feature tags delimited by ampersands, such as\n\nAdobe Caslon Pro:onum&smcp&c2sc&pnum\n\nand behold!\n\nThis also works in LibreOffice Calc, if you like your spreadsheets to use tabular oldstyle figures, for example.\n\nI agree Microsoft should expose this capability in PowerPoint already.\n\nMicrosoft is a big company. In one part, PowerPoint developers are dragging their feet with the text rendering, or even just the interface to the text rendering. In another part of Microsoft, someone who cares about OpenType is adding swashes to the Times New Roman italics and not announcing it anywhere.\n\nIn the meantime, while we wait for it, you can still tell your customers that oh by the way, LibreOffice Impress is free and can open most PowerPoint files. From there they can turn on the OpenType features, if a bit clumsily without a pleasant UI for doing so, then save the slideshows in native Impress format, export to PDF, et cetera.\n\nI just did a quick test, and including &kern in the feature string turns on class kerning rendering in Impress, and it even appears smart enough not to make the kerning additive between class kerning and legacy kerning.\n\nInteresting that Apple's Keynote application has not garnered even one mention in this thread.\n\nThat’s because it works when you know where to look. But Keynote only runs in macOS, and there is a Whole Other World of users who are trapped in a Windows ecosystem by other real constraints, but who could appreciate good microtypography if it were available to them. Ideally by default."
