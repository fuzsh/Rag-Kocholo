        "text": "Most prolific does not constitute best. Marketing, price, and scratching the right itch normally determine “best selling”, but rarely determine “best”. Take a look at Beta vs VHS. Beta was the best format for many reasons, but did not win the VCR wars because of poor decision-making at Sony. Wal-Mart is top dog because they sell cheap products, not because they sell the best.\n\nWindows IS the best for some things (i.e. ease of installation, availability of software, general usability, etc.), but to say it is the “best OS ever” is like saying the hammer is the “best tool ever”. Realistically, a hammer is great for pounding nails, but sucks when it comes to cutting wood. So, the BEST depends on what you need.\n\nMACs can’t be beat for clean, simple power and ability to handle graphics and colors properly. Now that their OS is Linux and processor Intel, I suspect the best is yet to come. (I am eyeing a powerbook as my next purchase…) Atari (remember them?) still does a great job handling digital video media, while a light version of Linux runs great on an old 486 with just 16 MB of RAM as a firewall.\n\nWindows has some of the best-featured office productivity tools (this includes WordPerfect et al as well as MS Office) and is by far the easiest to use wrt install, upgrade, etc. Even though I find Outlook lacking wrt customer relationship management features, Linux has yet to come up with a viable competitor to Outlook for handling mail, contacts, to-do lists, and calendar. Once they do, I may never need to spend money on Windows again.\n\nAlthough not always true, Linux is rarely at the forefront in the design of new products, more often Linux software is just something ported or copied from another OS. Yet in some ways, it is lightyears ahead. Linux allows unheard of customization of your system (as long as you take the time to learn how to use it), but the plethora of options and possibilities (not to mention the various distributions) is what keeps Linux out of mainstream. Many boards I have surfed about Linux have all the code monkeys saying they don’t want to dumb down Linux. That’s fine, but if that is the case, it will never be mainstream, and Windows will always be the dominant choice, since the average user can easily jump onto a Windows machine and do many things in a much more simple manner, making it appealing to them. Even for a veteran Linux guru, double-clicking an executable on a windows box is significantly easier than trying to install software on a Linux.\n\nSo, best is relative.\n\nThis fella has to be a troll, but just in case anyone is gullible enough to believe him:\n\nInsecure, unstable, unreliable, bloated, expensive. Windows summed up in 5 words.\n\nInsecure: I regularly have to run anti-virus and anti-spyware programs in Windows or suffer the consequences. My wife’s Windows XP PC needed a nuke and reinstall because of malware finally overcoming it (despite all attempts to save the thing). My Linux laptop hasn’t caused me any of that grief or wasted time, oddly enough.\n\nUnstable: I have to reboot my work PC (Windows XP) every night before I leave, otherwise it loses the plot entirely after a few days uptime. My Linux laptop has seen heavy usage and uptimes measured in weeks without going soft in the head. The Linux server I administer at work currently shows 64 days uptime (that’s longer than any install of Windows 98/ME I ever owned lasted before needing a reinstall, by the way). I’ve had my home server running Linux with uptimes of > 6 months.\n\nUnreliable: I freshly installed Linux on my laptop in February 2004, almost 2 years ago. I haven’t had to reinstall since. Even Windows 2000, which is a reasonably good product IMO, never lasted that long without forcing me to nuke and reinstall (and no, I don’t go hacking around in the registry – my linux box takes much more low-level abuse and sucks it up without fuss).\n\nBloated: C:\\WINDOWS\\ on my XP box in work takes up around 2.5GB all by itself. I have a fully functional Linux-based server at home which doesn’t even have that much total disk space. I’d love to see a Windows-based server run in that much space and still have room to spare.\n\nExpensive: this one’s self-explanatory. Don’t believe everything MS try to tell you about TCO – do your own research tailored to your own situation. And if you really think Windows has universally low TCO, kindly don’t complain when you have to ditch your current hardware and replace it with high-end, high-cost stuff to be able to run Windows Vista in any meaningful way.\n\nThere are bugs in every system, and yes, they get fixed. The open source development model makes this a whole lot more efficient, anyone can submit a code patch to the developers, who in turn actually care about the code they work on.\n\nYou say Windows is the “wheel which we use to drive our PCs”. Sadly, the wheel on your PC is wobbly and has a flat tire. And Microsoft reserve the right to replace it with a square one without notice. Or take it away entirely and leave your PC on axle-stands, unable to operate.\n\nDon’t get me wrong, there’s some things that windows does quite well, like Plug & Play hardware (thanks to hardware manufacturers for drivers and not to windows). Even then, not all. Try installing an Iomega parallel port zip drive without manually downloading a driver. Linux recognizes it right away. Networking in windows, however, is excellent and easier than Windows.\n\nI have used Microsoft’s OSes since early versions of DOS through Windows 3.1, 3.11, Win95, 98, 98SE, 2000, XP Home and XP Pro SP2. I can’t count the amount of frustating hours trying to get stuff working right, from CD Writers in Win98, Zip drives and anti-virus programs. I’ve spent thousands of dollars on Windows software. If Linux, as it has developed in the past couple of years, was available when Win95 came out, I would have gladly paid twice the amount just to avoid the frustrations of Windows.\n\nWith the exception of a few problems, Linux is fantastic. I compile my own kernels to get the functionality I need. I have 10 kernels to choose from on boot-up. I compile programs from source when necessary. I can’t remember the last time I had to reboot after installing a program or changing a configuration. There are only a couple of programs that I require that do not have a Linux version. Some will run quite well using Wine and only two require Win4Lin, which allows me to run Win98 in an X-Window. Guess what, Win98SE runs like a scalded cat in a Linux window, boots in 15 seconds and never BSDs. Vulnerability to viruses is there but will never affect the Linux OS underneath. A tarred backup of the windows OS restores things to pristine conditions in a few seconds if something goes wrong. And, I can run several Linux programs while Windows is running.\n\nDVD and CD burning is built-in and virtually fool-proof. 500 CD-Rs without a single dud. Media players, like MPlayer leave WMP in the dust. Rip CDs? Built-in. Word processing, spreadsheets, image viewers are at least as good as anything available for windows. I can create pdf files without Adobe Acrobat. Wget is probably the best downloader and web-site replicator available. Period. Command line (bash) is fantastic, nothing like it built-in in Windows. Writing bash scripts is fun (and Im not a geek). Far easier to run a program from the command line than from the GUI. I’ve got 2910 programs / utilities available, not including built-in bash commands. I can see the last 100,000 commands used. Web browsers: Konquerer, Opera, Firefox and two text-based web-browsers (Links and Lynx) which are lightning-fast to load pages. Many choices of mail clients but Evolution knocks the socks off Outlook. Gimp is at least as good as Photoshop. I have opened a 80 Mb image file in Gimp without problems. Try that in Photoshop. Or ACDSee if you want to reboot your PC.\n\nDon’t like the GUI interface? I have a choice of 4 to boot into.\n\nYes, there are frustrations, like setting-up printers or winmodems (what a ripoff). But, if you stick to HP LaserJet and external modems, works just fine.\n\nRe-install the OS once a year like you have to do for Windows when it slows to a crawl? I’ve got a notebook running Mandrake 9 for 3 years now and it boots just as fast as when it was installed and also a PC with Redhat 7.2 for 5 years now with no problems. It’s been running continuously, with shutdowns once every 3 or 4 months.\n\nBTW, the Internet has nothing to do with Windows OS. Try Unix for the backbone of the Internet. Even Microsoft uses Unix and Linux for servers. Apache web servers running under Linux are used by far more web sites than Microsoft servers. Our company used to use a Win2000/Novell server as a proxy server. Switched to Linux/Apache and got rid of the problems.\n\nBut, for people who can’t or won’t utilize a bit of the gray matter between their ears and are willing to waste time, Window is really their only choice. Both are terrible things to waste.\n\nI’ll bet you’ve faithfully paid M$ every few\n\nyears to keep your MCP current and bought every\n\nversion of Windows starting with Win95. Heck,\n\nI’ll bet you even were one of the people who\n\nwaited in line for it when it first showed up in\n\nstores.\n\nI was sort of like you once, too. Then, in 2003,\n\nI bought a copy of SuSE 8.2 and installed it. My\n\nfirst reaction was “Wow!” Basically, I put the\n\ndisk in, watched the installation work, rebooted\n\nthe system when it was done, and then had a\n\ncomplete system with an office program\n\n(OpenOffice), several e-mail clients (both\n\ngraphical and shell-based), three web browsers,\n\nand just about anything else I would need — all\n\ndone in a little over two hours. So, for $90\n\nU.S., I got a complete system that would have\n\ncost up to $1,000 had I stuck with Microsoft\n\nproducts. SuSE has been my primary OS ever\n\nsince.\n\nHave you tried buying SuSE 10.0 online? If not,\n\nthe installation via FTP isn’t that hard.\n\nDownload the boot ISO image from SuSE, boot from\n\nthe CD, and follow the installation “wizard”\n\nalong. The only difference is that you’ll have\n\nto change your software source installation\n\nlocation in YaST (the set-up tool) to their FTP\n\nlocations instead of the CD-ROM drive. Other\n\nthan that, it works the same.\n\nRecently I had a chance to visit a company that’s\n\ninvolved in e-commerce transaction processing.\n\nThis company is ALL LINUX & UNIX except for the\n\ndesktop. Why? It’s because they can’t afford\n\ndowntime, high costs, security holes, and having\n\nbloat (needless GUIs mainly) sucking up valuable\n\nsystem resources. If Windows truly was the best\n\nOS, you would think it would be used universally,\n\nbut it isn’t.\n\nAnd as for the Mac having sub-standard\n\nfunctionality, take a look at the Aqua interface\n\nand the Mach kernel. Oh, and did I mention that\n\nyou can pretty much run most all Unix programs on\n\nit? This includes running it as a mail server\n\nusing Sendmail and a database server using MySQL.\n\nYou may now explain to us how your copy of WinXP\n\ncan do those things — including serving over two\n\nconcurrent users.\n\nI must say, the level of ignorance demonstrated\n\nby your post is profound. I would hope that, if\n\nyou work in IT and hope to advance in your\n\ncareer, that you develop some knowledge of other\n\noperating systems because sooner or later you\n\nwill encounter them — either at your employer or\n\nby way of an organization that does business with\n\nyour employer. Obviously it would not help if\n\nyou dumbfounded at the sight of one of these\n\nother OS’s.\n\nAre you out of your everloving mind. Microsoft was still farting\n\naround with dos hell when Apple was given the GUI by Zerox.\n\nQuote” Nothing will ever come of that” UnQuote.\n\nEVERY FEATURE THAT IS IN WINDOWS WAS STOLEN FROM\n\nMACINTOSH.\n\nThat dude is flat out fact.\n\nMicrosoft had weathered lawsuits out the wazoo to steal and\n\nkeep the inovations that were stolen from Mac.\n\nOh yea! If Mac is so crude, why did Bill Gates invest $150 million\n\nin Apple several years back.\n\nI have used Dos since the ’60’s and bought my first Mac in the\n\nlate ’80’s.\n\nI service Mac and Windows customers in my business. If it wasn’t\n\nfor Windows I would starve. I get a Mac related call about once\n\nevery 2 months. I usually can handle that over the phone.\n\nNo the bugs don’t get fixed. They get reborn. Every patch that\n\nmicrosoft does will cripple or damage some application or part\n\nof their own system. Have you ever read the post that are\n\nincluded with every patch.\n\nSub standard. Sheeze, Windows is as close to a carbon copy of\n\nthe Mac GUI as windows can get it without bring down the wrath\n\nof the all mighty attorneys.\n\nEvery hosting isp offers windows, linux, and Macintosh based\n\nservers.\n\nThere are programmers that code windows software using\n\nMacintosh computers because they can stand the crashing that\n\ngoes on with Dos based machines.\n\nYea thats right, Dos based. Think it’s not still there. Go to start\n\nrun and type cmd and see what comes up. I still have to drop to\n\ndos to fix some of the crazy things that happen is windows.\n\nGo in to almost any Elementary or Jr High School and see what is\n\nin their computer labs.\n\nIf windows died right now Apple would pick up the slack and the\n\nweb would keep rignt on trucking, only just a little more stable.\n\nYou want to play a lot of games get windows. You want to do\n\nsome heavy graphics work without rebooting or waiting forever,\n\nget a Macintosh. What do you think is in Industrial Light &\n\nMagics workstations. It Dang shure ain’t Windows.\n\nMacintosh is porting to the Intel platform not because their\n\nhardware is getting tired. But because the windows users can’t\n\neven begain to understand why a 2.5gig RISC processor will tear\n\nup a 4gig Pentium.\n\nWindows is a pox on mankind. If it is a wheel it has a flat spot.\n\nThe only reason I want it to stay around is it puts food on my\n\ntable from fixing all of the “undocumented features” that they\n\nkeep putting in their software. NOTE: that’s technician slang for\n\nBUGS!\n\nGood luck in life. Ya gonna need it.\n\nLee\n\nMicro Support Technologies\n\nComputer Engineer since 1974\n\nMr Justice, when I read your message I couldn’t help but follow through and read some of the other replies. The response you got is all very interesting. It is also obvious that you are a devoted MS supporter. Good on you I say. But just take a moment and listen to this true story.\n\nI am neither a computer expert or very technical, but I have been using a home desktop computer for over 20 years. One of my first compters was an Apple compatible running on dual floppy. There was no gui and it was pretty much used for word processing. I would have upgraded to another Apple but priority hardware put an end to that and the real thing cost too much. The next machine was an IBM compatible XT. Well this had a hard disk. Soon I was using a word processor, printing, spreadsheet, home accounting, games, educational software and dialing up to bulleton boards. (This was the precurser to the internet). There was still no gui but I was using a neat text based menu system to easily select my programs. This was about my third computer and I still hadn’t heard of windows yet and I was doing just fine.\n\nThen I was introducted to windows 3.11. Whow you could use a mouse and wait for it, ‘you could run multiple programs at once’! But I am not exactly jumping up and down yet. It was a memory hog and extra RAM was expensive. The response time was slow and rebooting became a way of life. None of my other other programs worked and I wonder how much time I really saved?\n\nWell I really got excited when I bought my next PC and this time it had come pre-installed with windows 98 and a licensed copy of MS office. Now we are really talking. I could now play music, print beautiful color pictures, scan, fax, e-mail, burn CD’s, digital photos and surf the net. In all fairness this was a lot of fun. But it wasn’t exactly easy. I experienced lots of trouble getting the printing right, my wife never worked out the scanner, fax or burn CD’s. There were plenty of times I would install a driver and the PC wouldn’t boot up. I rebuilt the computer a number of times due to virus problems and I became very afraid of how secure the internet was. Plug and play didn’t always work and installing new drivers was a nightmare. I couldn’t block popup windows and some web pages would highjack my PC. There was heaps of help on the internet but everything had a price. I was paying for winzip, fax, virus, music and firewall software just to name a few. MS office is a very advanced product but I just find it too hard to get my head around it – even with hours of training.\n\nWell you could say I was overdue for an upgrade. I shopped around 2 years ago and I was pleasantly surprised that the hardware was now one third the cost I once paid for it. Strong competition in this area has really benefited the end user. I know XP is a good product because I use it at work (not that I need it for what I do with it). I get the blue screen sometimes and I have to unplug the usb mouse all the time because it just doesn’t get it. These are minor problems I just deal with but like I said I don’t really work this PC very hard.\n\nThen they told me how much it cost. The microsoft package and all the extras over shadows the cost of the hardware. It just goes to show that any corporation will charge what they like if they can get away with it.\n\nThis time I didn’t fall for it. I installed Red Hat 7.1 a little while ago and I wasn’t overly impressed but I thought I would give it a go anyway. Then it happended. My next machine was installed with Red hat 8. I must say I was very impressed with the improvement from version 7. E-mail, internet and printing was all very easy. No problems with the camera and faxing either. Oh there was one thing, I did have some trouble converting outlook to a linix compatible format. Watch out windows users if you think your own data belongs to you.\n\nWith the money I saved I was able to buy a second machine. One for each member of the family. Over the next two years I have upgraded to RH9, and then Fedora core 1, 2, 3 and now FC4. I have never looked back. Installation is easy enough and there are some good sites to tweak extra functionality.\n\nUsing Fedora core 4 I can email using thunderbird and there are some great plugins such as weather and dictionary etc. I am extremely happy with the firefox web brouser – no popups by default and the tabs do help with organising your windows. I can now surf the internet safely. Not even those bank fraud messages work here. I am already a pro with openoffice 2.0 so I gave MS office 2000 away. I have a laser and color printer connected to a network and you can print from any computer in the house. I didn’t even set this up, it worked this out automatically. I can play my collection of compressed music files, watch DVD’s and my wife can scan my old photos by clicking one mouse button. (A shell script I downloaded does it all for me). I also bought a cheap palm pilot which works well.\n\nThis all happened very easily, but wait there is more. Like I said I am not very smart, but when there are help files and web sites available to help you step by step. Just by finding the correct documentation (written for dummies), I built my own web site and installed a photo gallery, a chat room, email forms and a forum. This site is password protected and I got a free domain name from no-ip. This is all setup on my home computer. I have also turned my wife’s PC into a file server using NFS. This shares all our music, photo and e-mail data across to the other computers. I can logon to my home computer from work using secure shell. If I want to capture the gui over the network I use VNC viewer. This is also great for training purposes and spying on my daughter surfing the net. Also keep in mind that I have dual layers of firwall protection and I implement filesystem, password and network security. Backups to DVD are also automated. Don’t forget the fun networking games either.\n\nI didn’t spend hours and hours doing this. It was really easy. And it still doesn’t stop there. How about trying to make your own movies, creating a personal Video recorder with MythTV, automating home lights using X10 devices and your own internet radio station using Iceast. But that would be bragging now.\n\nI will give you one example of simplicity with linux. The other day my wife wanted to print some buisness cards – Hmm. I stopped off at the stationary shop on the way home from work and bought some bsuiness card labels for the printer. When I got home I searched on google/linux for a program to print business cards – 10 minutes. I then downloaded and installed this program called glabals using the ‘yum’ utility – 5 minutes. I could also use a graphical installer called synaptic but often the command line is easier and quicker. I started up the program, designed and printed business cards with photo id in 30 minutes. I found out later that openoffice has the capabability to print business cards but this utility turned out simplier to use anyway. Have you ever tried to convert you photos to a managable size for web or e-mail transport. I can run a simple command to convert and copy the entire directory in one stroke. I could go on but that will be enough for now.\n\nThe bottom line here is that although I think Microsoft have reasonably good products, I think we all could agree that we all would benefit from cheaper and better software if there was more competition out there, eg Apple, Linux etc. I know in the linux world there is plenty of strong competition producting good software and it is moving from strenght to strenght. Open source software means that we don’t have to keep reinventing the wheel all the time.\n\nMr Justice, if you are keen on trying linux then I would be happy to send you a copy of Fedora, Suse or knoppix to try out. The reason I would do this is because the real spirit of Linux is about community support.\n\nNot only is our house Microsoft free, but we don’t drink coke either….Jeffmate.\n\nThe title of your discussion does not match the verbiage you provide. A good/better/best operating system is graded or defined by its kernel, the nucleus or soul of the OS. Windows started dirty and still has a great and heavy load of baggage which does nothing except require more and more hardware to make any advance in performance.\n\nIn 1992/3 OS/2 was on my 40mhz, 128meg, 30gig machine which built on my bench because no factory could assemble systems with that cpu since it was the latest, fastest cpu for an IBM PC and had not passed FCC validation. I was dismayed by the time-to-boot; it went from 46 seconds then later to 1.5 minutes and beyond.\n\nMy currrent 3.1+ghz PC takes 25 to 40 seconds to boot-up under WinXP, S/R 2. It has nearly no use of virtual storage while the 1993 configuration was quite heavily thrashing hd during boot. It ran a real-time data acquisition from a 3/4 meter satellite dish which gathered information from the futures pits in several cities, plus all of the SPX movements, NYSE and Nasdaq markets. Several several programs were actively building, auditing, and reporting from three major and two minor files. At the end of the trading day for each of the markets, hands off, several things happened; creation of market reports, validation and archiving of history, elimination of invalid data, and compression of history files to minute-to-minute level, and weekly files to five-minute granularity then backup all to tape. These programs were self-written and were very austere by today’s standards. Gui does cost a lot, but to extrapolate to today’s configuration on a machine which is just about 100 times the core speed I remain totally unimpressed with Win.\n\nThere is a concept of “the model” having truth when matched to the actual kernel. In this area, MS fought with IBM to do things the expedient way; this gets out today’s project, but builds baggage and invariably creates gaps in security and the ability to scale upward. Windows has a terrific load of baggage, even after the upgrade to 32 bit processing, now 64.\n\nFurthermore, most of the gloss of the O/S which is the supporting reports, file services, drivers, and the like, have been created by companies that were subsequently bought out by M/S. Their coding was also expedient… more baggage.\n\nEnough for now. I could have addressed the early op-sys which were better technically than Windows; CPM certainly comes to mind, Dr DOS was also well regarded, and either could have cleaned M/S’s clock when compared on technical merit. Currently, take a close look at the Linnux systems, any, and take a very close look at Apple’s fine O/S.\n\nCase closed, Win is in fourth, fifth, or sixth place. Financially, strategically, and promotionally, however, M/S exceeds the sum-total of all of its contenders, in the past and now.\n\nThanks for your consideration, in advance,\n\nWarren Hall\n\nOk Microsoft is a big evil bloodsucking entity and a necessary evil at the same time. I will give old Bill this, what other company in the world can get away with selling a product that is still clearly in BETA phases and people buy it up figure out the problems and then let MS fix it in a service pack. THE MAN IS A MARKETING GENIUS.\n\nI actually like it when people find the problems in the OS. It boils down to Microsoft is letting people DEBUG their problems and then comes up with a solution to fix it. (MOST OF THE TIME) At the end of the day Microsoft still has some of the best offerings for Home User, Business Users, and sometimes debatable when it comes to Graphic Arts (THIRD PARTY SOFTWARE IS IN CONSIDERATION HERE).\n\nPersonally, I like the fact that MS listens to what people would like to see and tries to give it to them free within the OS. It shows that they have some compassion about not charging us out the butt for things like media player or browsers. However, what happens to them when they do this the get NAILED for trying to create a monopoly. Now there are grumblings about them even adding a Anti-Virus Light in the OS. Who knows? (LET US SEE WHAT THIS WILL STIR UP)\n\nI use Mac?s, Linux, and Microsoft to do my daily job at an Engineering firm and I will have to say all of them have their good points and all of them SUCK at the same time. It is all a matter of personal preference.\n\nIf you are a coder and do not care for eye candy and like to live in the command line world then use Linux. If you want to do graphics or open up a digital recording studio, use a Mac. You want Games, decent productivity products (Office, Money, ETC…), easy networking use Microsoft.\n\nMicrosoft got here by what every successful company and business model shows you to do. Create a product that people want, if someone does it better figure out how to one up them, listen to what your public wants, and try to make it as cost effective for society while still making a profit for your self. Which I can clearly say they have done all of the above.\n\nNot to mention MS gives countless amounts of money back to charities, education organizations, and other areas of society.\n\nThey are not all bad. The OS has flaws but hell we are human we make mistakes. Computers are only as smart as we make them.\n\nAs a side, note Word Perfect has sucked since it left the DOS days. Corel trashed them as well as most of the things it touches.\n\nThen on a final point if it was not for Microsoft most IT people in the world would not have a job. My bets are with Microsoft. Whether we like it or not the are the best choice and the best OS for 90% of the people on this planet"
