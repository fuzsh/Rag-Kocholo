        "text": "Conrad writes, edits, and illustrates a wide range of books and training materials with a focus on digital imaging, helping you create your best work with Adobe Creative Cloud (formerly Adobe Creative Suite).\n\nConrad has authored or co-authored books and videos about Adobe Photoshop and Lightroom, color management, Adobe Creative Cloud/Creative Suite, Adobe Illustrator, video editing, and Adobe InDesign/Aldus PageMaker.\n\nReal World Adobe Photoshop for Photographers\n\nConrad revised the three most recent editions of the classic series Real World Photoshop, which is focused on the needs and demands of professional digital photographers. He worked to preserve and update the pioneering and influential Photoshop best practices originally authored by the late Bruce Fraser, with David Blatner.\n\nOther Books about Adobe Photoshop and Lightroom\n\nAn avid photographer, Conrad has authored or co-authored numerous Adobe Photoshop books and tutorials for over 10 years. He combines his knowledge of Adobe Photoshop, Lightroom, and digital photography with photographic experience that reaches back to when he developed his film and paper in a darkroom.\n\nIn additional to the books below, as a technical editor and writer Conrad contributed to Adobe Photoshop 6.0 Studio Techniques (and the Photoshop 7.0 edition) by Ben Willmore, and the Photoshop 7 Visual QuickStart Guide by Peter Lourekas and Elaine Weinmann.\n\nColor Management\n\nThe complexity of setting up color management options and color profiles can be intimidating, especially to non-technical artists, designers, and photographers. Working with color expert Bruce Fraser on the Real World Photoshop series of books, Conrad gained an understanding of color management systems. He greatly appreciated that Bruce’s explanations of color to creative professionals were both understandable and accurate, inspiring Conrad to continue that work.\n\nConrad’s experience with vector drawing applications goes back to his first software industry job at Aldus Corporation as a technical support lead for Aldus FreeHand 1.0, an early direct competitor to Adobe Illustrator 1.0. Conrad wrote much of the user guide for Aldus FreeHand 2.0.\n\nAs a technical editor and writer, Conrad also contributed to Real World Adobe Illustrator 10 by Deke McClelland, and the Illustrator 10 Visual QuickStart Guide by Peter Lourekas and Elaine Weinmann.\n\nVideo editing, visual effects, and animation\n\nConrad helped write user guides for early versions of Aldus (now Adobe) After Effects and Adobe Premiere. After leaving Adobe, he wrote Adobe marketing materials for Adobe Creative Suite video applications such as Premiere Pro, After Effects, Adobe Media Encoder, and Adobe Story.\n\nIn addition to his work on the books below, Conrad is also the technical editor of Adobe Premiere Pro CC Classroom in a Book (2017 Release) by Maxim Jago, and Techniques of Visual Persuasion: Create Powerful Images That Motivate by Apple Final Cut Pro expert Larry Jordan."
