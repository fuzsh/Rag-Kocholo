        "text": "Graphic Design and Illustration and Medical and Scientific Illustration\n\nIA provides design and illustration services for researchers and scientists as well as training and communication specialists. In addition to current software, we maintain a catalog of older software (for example, Aldus FreeHand, Aldus Persuasion, and CorelDRAW) to support the historical work of our clients.\n\nIA artists have years of experience working with scientists to create graphics that accurately present their research data, concepts, and processes. These artists have more than 50 years of combined experience in illustrating cellular structures, chemical processes, signal pathways, and other biological and toxicological processes. IA’s illustrations appear as part of journal articles, poster sessions, and PowerPoint presentations. Our recent projects include covers and figures for e-books and on-line publications.\n\nDocument Layout and Design\n\nSuccessful document publishing projects have a well-thought-out plan that uses creative design techniques. The IA staff consults with the client to build a comprehensive understanding of the size and scope of the project. The factors considered as part of the planning process include the theme and content, the intended audience, methods of publication and distribution, and the number of deliverables if a hard copy is part of the project. For printed pieces, IA reviews printing methods, paper types, and binding options. Document products range from table tent cards and single sheet flyers to tri-fold brochures and bound brochures or booklets.\n\nScientific Posters\n\nThe creation of scientific posters is another frequently requested project from our research clients. Clients typically provide us with content in the form of Word documents, as well as figures that originate from a range of software including Excel, PowerPoint, ChemDraw, Illustrator, Photoshop, or GraphPad Prizm. We combine their data into a large format poster and deliver a printed product on either fabric or paper.\n\nFor clients who choose to create the posters themselves, we develop poster templates that are custom designed for each client.\n\nQuality Control, Proofreading, and Copy Editing\n\nIA employs two staff members whose sole responsibility is to provide quality control (QC) and proofing of all materials, electronic or printed, including video presentations, posters and display output. Our QC personnel are experienced and follow the Associated Press Stylebook. Our QC staff also ensures that client edits and updates are completed quickly and accurately and that all projects follow the client’s guidelines for style and format."
