We will read works from authors who have played dominant roles in shaping the English literary tradition; these authors include William Wordsworth, Elizabeth Barrett Browning, James Joyce, Virginia Woolf, Salman Rushdie and many others. In lecture, we will learn about some of Great Britain’s dramatic social and political transformations over the last two hundred years as the nation became the first modern, industrialized imperial power in the nineteenth century and then, in the twentieth, faced crises arising from the crumbling of its colonial holdings, its economic decline and the effects of radically new technologies. Perhaps more importantly, the lectures will aim to show how those historical transformations influenced writers’ creativity as British literature moved from the idealism of the Romantic movement to the subdued pragmatism of the Victorian age, to the conceptual challenges brought on by the modern and postmodern eras. During recitation, students will explore the historical and artistic issues covered in lecture in more detail; recitation will also help students increase their understanding and appreciation of the assigned literary works.\n\nPotential Assignments: Quizzes, midterm, final exam\n\nEnglish 2202: British Literature, 1800 to Present\n\nSection 20 Instructor: Bethany Geiger\n\nSection 30 Instructor: Lauren Colwell\n\nSection 40 Instructor: Bethany Geiger\n\nSection 50 Instructor: Lauren Colwell\n\nAn introductory critical study of the works of major British writers of the 19th and 20th centuries.\n\nGEL: Literature and Diversity Global Studies\n\nGEN Theme: Foundation Literature, Visual and Performing Arts\n\nEnglish 2202H: British Literature: 1800 – Present\n\nInstructor: Jill Galvan\n\nThis course will introduce you to major British literary trends of the last two centuries. Class meetings will include both lecture and lots of discussion. Our texts will cover the Romantic, Victorian, modernist and contemporary periods, including a bit of the twenty-first century. We’ll talk about many major artistic forms and movements—for example, the lyric, the Gothic, the dramatic monologue, aestheticism, World War I poetry, postcolonial literature and magic realism. We’ll also cover the cultural and historical phenomena that inform our texts, including the Haitian Revolution, French Revolution, slavery and abolitionism, gender roles and “separate spheres,” major scientific discoveries, challenges to religious faith, imperialism, anti-imperialism, sexuality’s expression/oppression and burgeoning modern views about art. Finally, besides teaching you literary and cultural history, English 2202H will help you to become a better critical reader and literary analyst, either for future classes or for your own enjoyment. You’ll practice reading texts with an eye for fine detail (a.k.a. close-reading or explicating) in order to construct logical, complex interpretations based on textual evidence.\n\nPotential Texts: Some of our authors: William Blake, Mary Prince, Mary Wollstonecraft, Henry Derozio, John Keats, Charles Dickens, Toru Dutt, Christina Rossetti, Olive Schreiner, Oscar Wilde, Wilfred Owen, Virginia Woolf, Una Marson, Ngugi wa Thiong’o, and Mohsin Hamid.\n\nPotential Assignments: Regular, active participation; two exams (midterm and final); three brief analytical responses, designed to build your skills in literary interpretation; and a final critical or creative project.\n\nEnglish 2220: Introduction to Shakespeare\n\nInstructor: Luke Wilson\n\nStudy of selected plays designed to give an understanding of drama as theatrical art and as an interpretation of fundamental human experience.\n\nGEL: Literature and Diversity Global Studies\n\nGEN Theme: Foundation Literature, Visual and Performing Arts\n\nEnglish 2220H: Introduction to Shakespeare, Honors\n\nInstructor: Alan Farmer\n\nIn this course we will read several plays written by Shakespeare and consider how they both conform to and work against the genres of comedy, tragedy, history, and romance. Looking at the plays as works to be both performed and read, we will pay particular attention to the politics of gender, religion, and kingship in the plays, topics that Shakespeare returned to again and again and that were vitally important, and indeed controversial, in the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries. Students will view and write a review of a performance of a Shakespeare play, and in addition to some critical and historical essays on the early modern theater and culture, we will read some combination of the following plays: Richard II, Much Ado About Nothing, Twelfth Night, Julius Caesar, Othello and The Tempest.\n\nPotential Texts: I will order editions from the New Cambridge Shakespeare, but any modern edition with glosses, notes, and line numbers of the above plays is fine. Good editions of single plays are published by Folger, Pelican, Norton, Oxford, Bedford, Arden, Bantam, and Signet. Reputable one-volume editions of Shakespeare’s plays are published by Longman, Oxford, Pelican, Riverside, and Norton. You will need to have physical copies of the plays we read, so do not buy any electronic editions.\n\nPotential Assignments: Requirements include a midterm exam, final exam, an academic performance review, two critical essays (one shorter, one longer), regular attendance, and active participation.\n\nEnglish 2260: Introduction to Poetry\n\nInstructor: Kayla Probeyahn\n\nThis course will teach students how to unravel the meanings of poems through close-reading skills and understanding poetic form and historical context. We will read a selection of poems, ranging from Ancient Greece to 2013 Tumblr, with authors varying from Sylvia Plath to ChatGPT, from William Wordsworth to Kendrick Lamar, all while considering their ideological, aesthetic, and experimental aims. This course is designed for students new to the study of poetry, but will be worthwhile for students at any stage who want to read poetry and improve their close-reading and writing skills.\n\nPotential Assignment: Short essays and quizzes\n\nEnglish 2261: Introduction to Fiction\n\nSection 10 Instructor: Sandra Macpherson\n\nSection 30 Instructor: Matthew Cariello\n\nSection 70 Instructor: Sean Yeager\n\nSection 80 Instructor: Matthew Cariello\n\nThis course will introduce students to the study of fiction. Examination of the elements of fiction -- plot, character, setting, narrative, perspective, theme, etc. -- and their various interrelations; comparisons with nonfictional narrative may be included.\n\nGEL: Literature\n\nGEN Theme: Foundation Literature, Visual and Performing Arts\n\nEnglish 2261: Introduction to Fiction: Literature of Metamorphosis – Tales of Trickery and Transformation\n\nSection 20 Instructor: Shaun James Russell\n\nIn this online asynchronous Intro to Fiction course, titled Literature of Metamorphosis: Tales of Trickery and Transformation, we will be reading a wide range of literary works spanning from antiquity to (almost) present day, and will have a few oddities sprinkled in with some generally canonical work. All of the works included will engage with the course theme to a large extent, but an open question we will be exploring throughout the course is: what constitutes transformation? Sometimes the answer will be clear: if an enchantress turns sailors into pigs, or if a man wakes up as a cockroach, that is a quite literal transformation. But what about when a boy has a pivotal moment in which he arguably becomes a man? Or when a woman realizes that she can only be herself when she dons the guise of others? Amid these and other thematic questions, we will also explore some of the building blocks of fiction, such as plot, character, setting, symbolism etc., and form our own educated opinions and analyses about what makes these literary works effective (or not).\n\nPotential Texts: Apuleius's The Golden Ass; Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream; Ovid's Metamorphoses; Kafka's The Metamorphosis; Heywood's Fantomina; and several other works of short fiction.\n\nPotential Assignments: Discussion posts, mid-term exam, comparative analysis paper, final paper and likely one creative option\n\nGEL: Literature\n\nGEN Theme: Foundation Literature, Visual and Performing Arts\n\nEnglish 2261H: Introduction to Fiction\n\nInstructor: Jill Galvan\n\nThis course has two goals. The first is to familiarize (or re-familiarize) you with literary concepts associated with fiction, as well as to introduce new concepts that will allow you to see this genre in more sophisticated terms. The second is to teach you how to come up with persuasive, thought-provoking interpretations of literature. My goal is to help you feel confident analyzing fiction on your own (whether in books or in other media). Each class will include some lecture, but most of the course will be conducted as an open discussion. We will likely end with a unit that considers: how does learning about fiction help someone to become a better critical thinker about texts, voices, and stories overall—even stories that are technically nonfiction? Our readings will span time periods and cultural and social perspectives.\n\nPotential Texts: (Tentative) Novels: Robert Louis Stevenson’s Jekyll and Hyde, Jennifer Egan’s A Visit from the Goon Squad, Justin Torres’s We the Animals, Iain Reid’s I’m Thinking of Ending Things, Mohsin Hamid’s Exit West. Short story authors: Herman Melville, Charlotte Perkins Gilman, Toni Morrison, Ursula K. Le Guin, Ted Chiang, Curtis Sittenfeld, Carmen Machado, and others. Plus at least one film.\n\nPotential Assignments: Regular and enthusiastic participation, three short response papers (1 ½-2 pp. each), a final project (5-7 pp.) and two exams.\n\nGEL: Literature\n\nGEN Theme: Foundation Literature, Visual and Performing Arts\n\nEnglish 2262: Introduction to Drama\n\nInstructor: Samantha Trzinski\n\nThis course will provide a broad overview of theatre and its historical development from ancient Greece to the modern day. It will place emphasis on nineteenth-century British drama and the material history of theatrical productions and the rise of celebrity culture. In addition to reading plays such as Bluebeard, Macbeth, and East Lynne, we will learn about the actors and set designs that brought these shows to life on the stage in the 1800s. The nineteenth century witnesses the rise of celebrity culture, with people like Sarah Siddons and Lord Byron becoming household names with countless fans. As we read and analyze dramas from this period, we will also consider concepts of fame and how they are connected to the literary and theatrical market.\n\nPotential Texts: Lord Byron, Manfred; George Colman, Bluebeard; William Shakespeare, Macbeth; Ellen Wood, East Lynne.\n\nPotential Assignments: Weekly discussion boards, reading quizzes, short essays (1.5-2 pages), biography of a playwright/actor, performed monologue\n\nGEL: Literature\n\nGEN Theme: Foundation: Literary, Visual and Performing Arts\n\nEnglish 2263: Introduction to Film\n\nSection 10 Instructor: Jesse Schotter\n\nSection 30 and 50 Instructor: Sam Risak\n\nSection 60 and 80 Instructor: Caleb Hays\n\nThis course offers an introduction to the language and aesthetics of cinema, familiarizing students with the basic building blocks of film, the forms that movies use to tell stories, communicate complex ideas, and dramatize social conflicts. It also introduces students to significant developments in film history and ways of approaching film interpretation. We will use each week’s film as both a case study in the strategic deployment of certain cinematic techniques, and as a specific set of images and sounds that combine to create a unique cinematic expression. Throughout the term, we will focus on detailed analysis of films, analyzing closely the ways in which the multiple elements of moviemaking come together to make, and complicate, meaning. Our primary goal in this class is to become skilled at thinking, talking, and writing critically about movies and, in the process, to deepen our appreciation and understanding of the film medium.\n\nPotential Texts: Films may include: Top Gun: Maverick, His Girl Friday, Rear Window, In the Mood for Love, The Conversation, Killer of Sheep, Do the Right Thing, Cleo from 5 to 7 and more.\n\nPotential Assignments: Close analysis response, final paper, final exam\n\nGEL: Visual and Performing Arts\n\nGEN Theme: Foundation: Literary, Visual & Performing Arts\n\nEnglish 2264: Introduction to Popular Cultures\n\nInstructor: Rachel Stewart\n\nThis course introduces students to the interdisciplinary field of Popular Culture Studies through a variety of methods and case studies. The specific focus will be on the entanglement of race, ethnicity, and gender in popular cultures.\n\nGEL: Cultures and Ideas\n\nGEN Theme: Foundation - Historical and Cultural Studies\n\nGEN Theme: Foundation - Race, Ethnicity & Gender Diversity\n\nEnglish 2265: Introduction Fiction Writing\n\nSection 10 Instructor: Megan Jones\n\nSection 30 Instructor: Gianna Gaetano\n\nSection 40 Instructor: Cat McMahan\n\nSection 50 Instructor: Porter Yelton\n\nAn introduction to the fundamentals of technique, craft, and composition; practice in the writing of fiction; and analysis and discussion of student work as well as published stories by masters of the genre.\n\nEnglish 2266: Introduction to Poetry Writing\n\nSection 10 Instructor: Hannah Nahar\n\nThe word \"poem\" comes from the Greek \"poeisis,\" meaning to make. A poem is a \"made thing.\" A thing made out of words, out of images, out of lines, out of thoughts, out of feelings, out of time! In this introductory poetry writing course, we will make poems and talk about them. We'll read lots of published poems and consider how they work, how they sing and move us. Together, we will define craft elements such as meter, rhyme, form, repetition, syntax, lineation, field of page, metaphor, image, etc. How do poems work, and what differentiates this strange, slippery genre from others? Why, across human history, do we keep making poems?\n\nPotential Assignments: Creative work, reflection papers on published poems, thoughtful notes on classmate work.\n\nEnglish 2266: Introduction to Poetry Writing\n\nSection 20 Instructor: Alexandra Smereka\n\nAn introduction to the fundamentals of technique, craft, composition, and prosody; practice in the writing of poetry; and analysis and discussion of student work as well as published poems by established poets.\n\nEnglish 2267: Introduction to Creative Writing\n\nInstructor: Claudia Owusu\n\nAn introduction to the writing of fiction, poetry, and creative nonfiction. Analysis and discussion of student work, with reference to the general methods and scope of all three genres.\n\nEnglish 2268: Introductory Creative Nonfiction Writing\n\nInstructor: Danielle Ola\n\nWe all have stories to tell. This is a class that’s interested in nonfiction writing that defies convention and blurs genres. Be prepared to encounter essays that veer into poetry, pop culture critique that delves into memoir, and memoir that uses the tools of fiction to speculate what might have been. In our time together, we will develop a writing practice that captures the little wonders of our lives, become acquainted with the various forms our stories can take on the page, and expand our notions of what nonfiction can be.\n\nPotential Texts: Body Work, Melissa Febos; Letters to a Writer of Color, Ed. Deepa Anappara and Taylor Soomro; Craft in the Real World, Matthew Salesses; Excerpts from The Little Devil in America, Hanif Abdurraqib; “No Name Woman,” The Woman Warrior, Maxine Hong Kingston; \"Ground Zero\", The Undocumented Americans, Karla Cornejo Villavicencio.\n\nPotential Assignments: Weekly writing exercises, one presentation on a class reading, one creative essay submitted for workshop, feedback letters written for their peers\n\nGuiding Questions: How has the nonfiction genre evolved in modern literature? What form(s) does it take today?\n\nEnglish 2269: Digital Media Composing\n\nSection 10 Instructor: Elizabeth Velasquez\n\nSection 40 Instructor: Luke Van Niel\n\nA composition course in which students analyze and compose digital media texts while studying complex forms and practices of textual production.\n\nGEL: Visual and Performing Arts\n\nGEN Theme: Foundation - Literary, Visual & Performing Arts\n\nEnglish 2270: Introduction to Folklore\n\nSection 10 Instructor: Zahra Abedi\n\nSection 20 Instructor: Daisy Ahlstone\n\nA general study of the field of folklore including basic approaches and a survey of primary folk materials: folktales, legends, folksongs, ballads, and folk beliefs.\n\nGEL: Cultures and Ideas\n\nGEN Theme: Foundation - Historical and Cultural Studies\n\nGEN Theme: Foundation - Race, Ethnicity & Gender Diversity\n\nEnglish 2276: Arts of Persuasion\n\nSection 10 Instructor: James Fredal\n\nIntroduces students to the study and practice of rhetoric and how arguments are shaped by technology, media, and cultural contexts.\n\nGEL: Cultures and Ideas\n\nGEN Theme: Citizenship for a Diverse & Just World\n\nEnglish 2276: Arts of Persuasion\n\nSection 20 Instructor: Kay Halasek\n\nHow do citizens engage a public to express their interests, to right wrongs, urge fairness, enact justice and awaken compassion? How can citizens critically interpret and engage with public texts and arguments as members of a common political body? We’ll explore these questions and others through the lens of rhetoric as the art of public argumentation, persuasion and interpretation. We’ll learn about the elements of rhetorical interactions, including audience and rhetorical effects, texts and meanings, genres and situations, forms and structures, authors and authorial purposes, argumentation schemes, narrative and myth, tropes and metaphors, as well as cultural and ideological frameworks.\n\nPotential Texts: Our main course text will be Atilla Hallsby's Reading Rhetorical Theory: Speech, Representation, and Power. It's available online as an open access text that can be downloaded as a pdf.\n\nPotential Assignments: Assignments tentatively include ungraded quizzes (to determine students’ degree of understanding of key terms and concepts), three short (2-page) papers, two unit exams and a take-home final exam in which students identify and analyze a rhetorical problem in terms of one of the three thematic situations set out by Hallsby: settler, secrecy, or digital rhetoric. For example, they may analyze the rhetoric of a contemporary perspective on the (1) rights of indigenous groups, (2) conservative or liberal conspiracy theory, or (3) racialized implications of digital algorithms.\n\nGuiding Questions: Because rhetoric (which includes basically every message you send or receive) has this world-building ability, it’s an appropriate tool to investigate questions of citizenship, diversity, and justice: Who counts as a citizen? What does it mean to be a citizen? How do we organize and maintain a just and diverse society? Through applying rhetorical concepts to historical and contemporary texts asserting people’s right to belong, this course teaches students to identify rhetorics of citizenry and justice, to analyze their effects and to understand their implications.\n\nEnglish 2277: Introduction to Disability Studies\n\nSection 10 Instructor: Staff\n\nSection 20 Instructor: Katelin Anderson\n\nFoundational concepts and issues in disability studies; introduction to the sociopolitical models of disability.\n\nGEL: Cultures and Ideas\n\nGEN Theme: Health and Well-being\n\nEnglish 2281: Introduction to African-American Literature\n\nInstructor: Cynthia Young\n\nThis course introduces students to key African American writers and cultural movements of the last two and half centuries. Central questions for the class include: how are community, power, race, gender, and sexuality represented and experienced in and through the texts we will read? How are these texts shaped by the audience to whom they may be addressed? How do these texts relate to struggles for racial justice, including anti-slavery, anti-colonial, and prison abolition movements? We will read work by writers including Phyllis Wheatley, David Walker, Harriet Jacobs, Frederick Douglass, Charles Chesnutt, Langston Hughes, Zora Neale Hurston, Malcolm X, James Baldwin, Audre Lorde, June Jordan, Toni Morrison, and Octavia Butler, and we will examine literary and political movements including the Harlem Renaissance and the Black Arts Movement.\n\nGEL: Literature\n\nGEL: Diversity: Social Diversity in the US\n\nGEN Theme: Foundation - Literary, Visual & Performing Arts\n\nGEN Theme: Foundation - Race, Ethnicity & Gender Diversity\n\nEnglish 2282: Introduction to Queer Studies\n\nSection 10 Instructor: Julia Applegate\n\nSection 20 Instructor: Peyton Del Toro\n\nIntroduces and problematizes foundational concepts of the interdisciplinary field of queer studies, highlighting the intersections of sexuality with race, class, and nationality.\n\nGEL: Cultures and Ideas\n\nGEL: Diversity - Social Diversity in the US\n\nGEN Theme: Foundation - Historical and Cultural Studies\n\nGEN Theme: Foundation - Race, Ethnicity & Gender Diversity\n\nEnglish 2290: Colonial and U.S. Literature to 1865\n\nSection 10 Instructor: Molly Farrell\n\nSection 20 Instructor: Soyoo Park\n\nSection 30 Instructor: Erin Temple\n\nSection 40 Instructor: Mica Edmiston\n\nSection 50 Instructor: Erin Temple\n\nSection 60 Instructor: Soyoo Park\n\nSection 70 Instructor: Mica Edmiston\n\nIntroductory study of significant works of U.S. literature from its Colonial origins to 1865.\n\nGEL: Literature\n\nGEN Theme: Foundation - Literary, Visual & Performing Arts\n\nEnglish 2367.01: Language, Identity, and Culture in the US Experience\n\nSection 10 Instructor: Mary Gibaldi\n\nSection 120 Instructor: Rebecca Thacker\n\nExtends & refines expository writing & analytical reading skills, emphasizing recognition of intertextuality & reflection on compositional strategies on topics pertaining to education & pop culture in America.\n\nGEL: Diversity - Social Diversity in the US\n\nGEL: Writing and Communication: level 2\n\nEnglish 2367.01: Popular science writing and the American public's STEM literacy\n\nSection 50 and 140 Instructor: Garrett J Cummins\n\nFrom the standard course description, English 2367/01 extends and refines expository writing and analytical reading skills, emphasizing recognition of intertextuality and reflection on compositional strategies on topics pertaining to education and pop culture in America.\n\nThe particular popular culture and education topics we will be looking at focus on how STEM(science, technology, engineering, and math) relates to writing in our majors and/or future professions, open to all majors. In the instance of things like climate change denial intersects with all kinds of majors in all kinds of ways, from business majors to education majors; from humanities majors to sports management, and STEM majors to just name a few majors.\n\nFor both STEM and non-STEM majors, we will focus on how popular American STEM writing and communication intersect with STEM literacy, i.e. the American public’s understanding, misunderstanding, use, and misuse of STEM-related facts, such as climate change denial, flat-earth conspiracy, COVID denial, etc.\n\nHowever, these topics and the related readings only work as a springboard for your own writing and research. As a composition course, we focus on the writing process, research, and using OSU’s libraries online resources, along with Google Scholar.\n\nPotential Texts: Potential excerpt readings from the following books, which I will supply: The War on Science by Shawn Otto; The Life-Changing Science of Detecting Bullshit by John V. Petrocelli; Not a Scientist by Dave Levitan; Merchants of Doubt by Naomi Oreskes and Erik Conway; Unscientific America by Chris Mooney.\n\nWe will also read various scholarly and popular articles about popular STEM writing, American STEM literacy, and issues with STEM information and misinformation in online spaces, like social media. For the writing textbook, we will use an Open Educational Resource, called English Composition 2, which I will supply to you.\n\nPotential Assignments: Smaller, weekly discussion board posts that work to help you create writing for the larger assignments. These discussion board posts can be summaries, reading responses to course readings, or reflections on what we wrote. In turn, the class has the following assignment sequence for the larger assignments: Literature review/exploratory essay that connects American STEM literacy, popular STEM writing, and a topic from your major A critical analysis of a popular piece of STEM writing A piece of original writing that appeals to a public audience, arguing how STEM literacy is vital for understanding the topic related to your major. Reflection on what learned over the source of the semester.\n\nGuiding Questions: Potential questions for the course include: How does the American public’s STEM literacy affect how scientists and nonscientists compose and present STEM information in public forums, such as in online and popular publications? How does STEM literacy and popular information affect nonscientific disciplines, such as business, humanities, the arts, etc.? How does popular STEM writing and American STEM literacy affect policymakers’ decisions, which impacts all Americans’ lives--especially Americans from historically underrepresented populations?\n\nGEL: Diversity - Social Diversity in the US\n\nGEL: Writing and Communication: level 2\n\nEnglish 2367.02: Literature in the U.S. Experience\n\nInstructor: Kayla Goldblatt\n\nDiscussion & practice of the conventions, practices, & expectations of scholarly reading of literature & expository writing on issues relating to diversity within the U.S. experience.\n\nGEL: Literature\n\nGEL: Diversity - Social Diversity in the US\n\nGEL: Writing and Communication: level 2\n\nGEN Theme: Foundation: Literary, Visual & Performing Arts\n\nEnglish 2367.05: Writing About the U.S. Folk Experience\n\nInstructor: Mintzi A Martinez-Rivera\n\nThis section of 2367.05 is designed to employ the core concepts and methods of the field of folklore as the basis for reading assignments and writing projects. Because the theme of this course is the U.S. Folk Experience, we will begin with a brief introduction to basic concepts of American folklore and ethnography, including folk groups, tradition, and fieldwork methodology, focusing on how these concepts and methodologies contribute to the development of critical reading, writing, and thinking skills. Along the way, we will explore the diversity of experiences of different groups in the U.S. both through course readings and through your writing assignments and projects.\n\nGEL: Diversity - Social Diversity in the US\n\nGEL: Writing and Communication: level 2\n\nGEN Theme: Lived Environments\n\nEnglish 2367.06: Composing Disability in the U.S.\n\nInstructor: Lauren Chivington\n\nExtends & refines expository writing & analytical reading skills, emphasizing recognition of intertextuality & reflection on compositional strategies on topics pertaining to education & pop culture in America.\n\nGEL: Diversity - Social Diversity in the US\n\nGEL: Writing and Communication: level 2\n\nEnglish 2367.08: The U.S. Experience: Writing About Video Games\n\nSection 10 Instructor: Christoffer Turpin\n\nSection 20 Instructor: Ryan Helterbrand\n\nSection 30 Instructor: Ryan Helterbrand\n\nSection 40 Instructor: Lauren Cook\n\nSection 50 Instructor: Liz Miller\n\nSection 60 Instructor: Liz Miller\n\nSection 70 Instructor: Lauren Cook\n\nEmphasizes persuasive and researched writing, revision, and composing in various forms and media. Focusing on digital literacy, development of critical thinking skills and skill in producing analytical prose, students explore key conversations in the field of game studies and analyze a variety of types of video game writing. No prior knowledge of video games or game studies is required.\n\nGEL: Writing and Communication: level 2\n\nGEN Theme: Lived Environments\n\nEnglish 2367.08: The U.S. Experience: Writing About Video Games\n\nSection 80 Instructor: Calvin Olsen\n\nThis semester, our work will be situated around the theme of “Whose Game Is It Anyway?” In less pithy terms, we’re going to spend a lot of time playing, discussing, and writing about games that make decisions (conscious and unconscious) about who is depicted in them (and how). We’ll taking into consideration the way that many games were built by and for what digital humanities scholar Roopika Risam called the “exclusionary universal subject” (white dudes…like your professor…), and we will look at the presence and absence of diverse characters in the games. In order to ensure we devote plenty of time to the writing portion of the course, we’ll focus mostly on the two types of identifiers people think of when we consider diversity—race and gender/sexuality—but we’ll also work together to find and highlight games that make use of a wide a range of interesting characters that might guide us toward an inclusionary universal subject. The more the merrier, as they say.\n\nPotential Texts: Who Says? by Deborah H. Holdstein and Danielle Aquiline. Third Edition. Oxford University Press. ISBN 9780197525494.

We will develop a definition of citizenship that emphasizes a citizen?s relationship to their local, national, and global environments.\n\nGEN Theme: Citizenship for a Diverse & Just World\n\nEnglish 3020: Writing About Sustainability\n\nInstructor: John L. Seabloom-Dunner\n\nWriting about Sustainability is an advanced-level writing course that fulfills the GE requirements for the Sustainability Theme by asking students to consider their place in the natural world through the following learning activities: conducting primary and secondary research, analyzing data, composing and revising written arguments, and becoming more proficient with the conventions of academic discourses.\n\nPotential Texts: Graff + Birkenstein’s They Say, I Say: The Moves That Matter in Academic Writing. New York: WW Norton & Co. (5th Edition)\n\nGEN Theme: Sustainability\n\nEnglish 3031: Rhetorics of Health, Illness and Wellness\n\nInstructor: Eduardo Mabilog\n\nStudents examine rhetorical concepts and how rhetorical devices construct our understanding of our bodies, health and wellness. Students learn how power structures and ideologies enable commonplace rhetorical devices to structure normative beliefs about bodies, health, and wellness and how rhetoric shapes perceptions of health and wellness and makes and unmakes healthy bodies, including your own.\n\nGEN Theme: Health and Well-being\n\nEnglish 3110: Citizenship, Justice, and Diversity in Literatures, Cultures, and Media: [Specific Topic: Law, Literature, and Contested Citizenship in the Long Nineteenth Century]\n\nInstructor: John Rooney\n\n“It is emphatically the province and duty of the judicial department to say what the law is.”\n\n—Marbury v. Madison (1803)\n\n“Poets are the unacknowledged legislators of the world.”\n\n—Percy Bysshe Shelley, A Defence of Poetry (1821)\n\nIt is an odd fact: literary writers have, since the nineteenth century, imagined themselves as the unacknowledged legislators of the world. In short, they have maintained, sometimes in earnest and sometimes in jest, that literature might have the force of law. Since that time, the institutions of the law have, for their part, adopted the techniques of literary writers to lend their pronouncements gravity and authority, as if the force of law were at bottom a creation of literary style. In this course, we will examine the ways in which literature sought to read itself as law, and law as literature, at the time when both literature and law came to hold the meanings we now commonly associate with them—the nineteenth century, when both Anglo-American jurisprudence and literature were exercised over fundamental questions of citizenship and justice. In imagining who might be a citizen, and in excluding others from this newly and direly important category, the discourses of law and literature, borrowing from each other, created many of the assumptions, and much of the prejudice, surrounding questions of citizenship with which we still grapple to this day. In this class, we will read poetry, plays, short stories, philosophical treatises, and judicial opinions from both sides of the Atlantic authored in the century whose ways of imagining citizenship, community, and justice still haunt our contemporary moment. This course will be of special interest to pre-law students and to others considering a career in legal or law-adjacent professions, but all interests are welcome.\n\nPotential Texts: Edmund Burke, Reflections on the Revolution in France (1790); Mary Wollstonecraft, A Vindication of the Rights of Woman (1792); William Godwin, From An Enquiry Concerning Political Justice (1793, 1796, 1798); Percy Bysshe Shelley, Prometheus Unbound (1820); Mary Prince, The History of Mary Prince, a West Indian Slave, Related by Herself (1831); Additional Readings Posted to Carmen.

This course examines how various horror genres use monsters to explore issues of wellbeing and citizenship, and debates about race, gender, sexual orientation, mental health, social justice, and personal responsibility.\n\nGEN Theme: Citizenship for a Diverse & Just World\n\nGEN Theme: Health and Well-being\n\nEnglish 3264: Monsters Without and Within\n\nSection 20 Instructor: Calvin Olsen\n\nBy writing Frankenstein (and publishing it in 1818), Mary Shelley brought a monster into the world (and birthed the science fiction genre). The novel’s creature has been a part of pop culture ever since, to the point that we conflate it with the word Frankenstein. One of the many interesting questions at the core of Frankenstein has to do with the monster’s humanity. It was made of (mostly) human parts, but is it human? This is an unanswerable question based on what we’ll encounter in the text, but one certainty is that the creature’s body is what makes it monstrous—or, better, what made humans label it monstrous.\n\nThis course will examine a handful of literary monsters whose monstrosity is deeply rooted in and possibly inseparable from the human-ish bodies they inhabit. As we read and discuss these novels, we will examine how notions of monstrous corporeality (monstrous body-ness) push readers to explore fundamental issues of wellbeing and citizenship. We’ll stitch these texts together with ideas (and sometimes debates) about race, gender, sexual orientation, mental health, social justice, and national and/or personal responsibility. Each writer’s monster gives us a different angle from which to examine ourselves and our interactions with other humans, and each will push us to confront monsters without and within as we take a long look in the proverbial mirror.\n\nPotential Texts: Frankenstein by Mary Shelley; The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde by Robert Louis Stevenson; The Haar by David Sodergren\n\nGEN Theme: Citizenship for a Diverse & Just World\n\nGEN Theme: Health and Well-being\n\nEnglish 3264: Monsters Without and Within\n\nSection 30 Instructor: Christopher A. Jones\n\nWhy have vampires gripped the popular imagination for so long? How does the figure of the vampire reflect changing attitudes about health and disease, or community and alienation? Addressing such questions, this section of English 3264 will focus on the evolving figure of the vampire in nineteenth- and twentieth-century literature. After a preliminary consideration of vampire legends from folkloric and scientific perspectives, we will focus on representations of the vampire across a series of texts including Stoker’s Dracula (1897), Matheson’s I Am Legend (1954), Rice’s Interview With the Vampire (1977) and Lindqvist’s Let Me In (2004), along with the film adaptations of each of these. There will be reading quizzes at least weekly, a final short paper, a take-home midterm exam, and a final research or creative project. This class is in person and attendance is required.\n\nGEN Theme: Citizenship for a Diverse & Just World\n\nGEN Theme: Health and Well-being\n\nEnglish 3264: Monsters Without and Within\n\nSection 40 Instructor: Hannibal Hamlin\n\nThe Devil, Satan, Lucifer, Old Nick, the Prince of the Power of the Air. For millennia, humans have attributed the evil in the world, even the evil that men do, to an external supernatural agent, a fallen angel, a demon, the Lord of Hell, the enemy of God and the Good. After exploring the origins of Satan, we’ll read a variety of works in different genres (plays, novels, films) featuring the Devil or characters like him. In Ben Jonson’s The Devil is an Ass, Satan sends a demon to corrupt London, but the city is already so corrupt that the demon ends up in prison. Norman Mailer’s last novel, The Castle in the Forest, is the story of Hitler’s childhood, told by the demon assigned to put him on the wrong path. Particularly influential is the legend of Faust, the man who sold his soul for knowledge and power. We’ll read the influential play by Johann von Goethe, Germany’s Shakespeare, James Hogg’s Faustian Private Memoirs and Confessions of a Justified Sinner, and watch Istvan Szabo’s brilliant Nazi-era Faust film, Mephisto. But is the Devil just a projection of evil inclinations that are all too human? We’ll discuss devilish sociopaths and serial killers in Muriel Spark’s The Ballad of Peckham Rye, Patricia Highsmith’s The Talented Mr. Ripley, and Sherman Alexie’s Indian Killer.\n\nGEN Theme: Citizenship for a Diverse & Just World\n\nGEN Theme: Health and Well-Being\n\nEnglish 3271: Structure of the English Language\n\nSection 10 Instructor: Clarissa Surrek-Clark\n\nSection 30 Instructor: Clarrissa Surek-Clark\n\nStudents learn basic characteristics of English linguistics focusing on the basic building blocks of language; the sounds of English and how they are put together, word formation processes, and rules for combining words into utterances/sentences. Students investigate and explore linguistic variation, accents of American English, and the implications of language evaluation in educational settings.\n\nGEL: Cultures and Ideas\n\nGEN Foundation: Historical and Cultural Studies\n\nEnglish 3271: Structure of the English Language\n\nSection 20 Instructor: Elise Robbins\n\nThis course is an introduction to English linguistics. You will gain the analytical tools to scientifically analyze any language, and apply those tools to English. We?ll learn about the basic characteristics of language: the sounds of English and how they?re put together, word formation processes, and rules for combining words into utterances/sentences. While studying how the basic building blocks of language work, we will also investigate linguistic variation, accents of American English, and language and education. We?ll also consider how standard and non-standard varieties of English get evaluated in the US, and the implications of such evaluations in educational settings.\n\nGEL: Cultures and Ideas\n\nGEN Foundation: Historical and Cultural Studies\n\nEnglish 3304: Business and Profesional Writing\n\nSection 10 Instructor: Julianna Crame\n\nSection 20 Instructor: Adrian Salgado\n\nSection 30 Instructor: Angel Evans\n\nSection 40 Instructor: William Spriggs\n\nSection 50 Instructor: William Spriggs\n\nSection 60 Instructor: William Spriggs\n\nThe study of principles and practices of business and professional writing.\n\nEnglish 3305: Technical Writing\n\nSection 10 Instructor: Irma Zamora\n\nSection 30 Instructor (Session 2): Susan Lang\n\nStudy of principles and practices of technical writing. Emphasis on the style, organization, and conventions of technical and research reports, proposals, memoranda, professional correspondence, etc.\n\nEnglish 3305: Technical Writing\n\nSection 20 Instructor: John Seabloom-Dunne\n\nTechnical Writing is designed to improve the communication skills and career prospects of three groups: (1) science and engineering majors preparing for technology-focused careers, (2) humanities majors interested in exploring career options in technical communication, and (3) students of any major who want to enhance their marketability by learning about workplace writing\n\nEnglish 3360: Ecopoetics\n\nInstructor: David Ruderman\n\n'Ecopoetics' is a thematic literature course focused on interpretation and analysis of literary texts that represent interactions between humans and the natural world within specific cultural and historical settings, through a contextual examination of how human activity has impacted the environment, how social and natural systems interact, and the long-term impact of human choices.\n\nGEN Theme: Lived Environments\n\nEnglish 3364: Special Topics in Popular Culture: Gaming and Playing\n\nInstructor: Misha Grifka Wander\n\nWhat do you think about when you hear the word “game”? Is it video games? Board games? Games of pretend? Maybe it’s TTRPGs like Dungeons & Dragons, or game shows, or card games, or gambling games. Maybe it’s improv games or LARP. Maybe it’s something else entirely. Gaming and play are an important part of every human culture, throughout the millennia, but many people don’t think about them in depth. In this class, we will be diving into the depth and breadth of the world of games. What makes something a game? Do games have to be fun? How does the type of game influence what it’s like to play? How are some people encouraged or discouraged from playing games? We’ll look at board games, video games, tabletop games, and more. You’ll be introduced to game theories and theories of play, and produce both critical and creative writing on the class themes. This class will involve play, of course, but also serious thought about how games affect us, from the personal to societal level. You do not need to have experience with any specific type of game, so self-identified gamers and non-gamers alike are welcome!\n\nPotential Assignments: Papers, quizzes and creative work\n\nGEL: Cultures and Ideas\n\nGEN Foundation: Historical and Cultural Studies\n\nEnglish 3372: Special Topics in Science Fiction or Fantasy\n\nSection 10 Instructor: Robert Hughes\n\nSection 30 Instructor: Andrew Romriell\n\nIntroduction to the tradition and practice of speculative writing. Provides students the opportunity to examine and compare works of science fiction and/or fantasy.\n\nGEL: Literature\n\nGEN Foundation: Literary, Visual & Performing Arts\n\nEnglish 3372: Special Topics in Science Fiction or Fantasy\n\nSection 20 Instructor: Zoe Thompson\n\nWhen we hear the term, “science fictions,” we might immediately think of the word, “future,” and the genre certainly does look forward to fifty years from now, a hundred, a thousand or even ten thousand. Science fiction often speculates looking at everything from our intimate relationships to our social lives and how technology might change the way we live. Such stories, however, are always rooted in the present; reflections. on love, sex, community, and lifestyle are very often actually reflections on our lives in the present moment.\n\nIn this class, we are going to focus on two short forms: the short story and the TV episode. The short story is a brief but intense snapshot of an interlude, a specific chapter in a story. Because it does not have the room of the novel, it cannot tell an epic or give every detail of a character’s life story. Instead we have a glimpse and very often this might include an epiphany, a surprise, a twist, a revelation (unless writers are going against conventions). Frank O’Connor in The Lonely Crowd talks about how in a short story, “an iron bar must be bent, and it must be seen to be bent”.\n\nThe TV episode is slightly different, though it can sometimes stand alone, like a short story. Often however it is part of an interlinking story that takes up a whole series. The TV episode has an art to it however, and its brevity means that it has particular demands on it, as well the build-up of suspense and intrigue if it is part of a longer series. Your research project will be to explore these short forms and to discover and compare what the short story and the TV episode have in common and how they differ.\n\nPotential Texts: We will look at specific stories from these anthologies, but I would recommend reading these collections widely to get a strong sense of the variety of the genre.\n\nMasterpieces: The Best Science Fiction of the Twentieth Century ed. Orson\n\nScott Card.\n\nDark Matter: A Century of Speculative Fiction from the African Diaspora, ed.\n\nSheree R. Thomas.\n\nTV Episodes: Electric Dreams, limited series, episode 3, ‘Human Is’. Electric Dreams, limited series, episode 9, ‘The Commuter’. Stranger Things, season 2, chapter 3 ‘The Pollywog’. Westworld, series 2, episode 5, ‘Akane no mai’. (This episode does have some spoilers – so binge-watch the rest beforehand if this bothers you.)\n\nOptional: The Walking Dead series 1, episode 1. The Man in the High Castle, series 1, episode 1. Raised by Wolves, series 1, episode 1.\n\nPotential Assignments: Online participation, essay plan, annotated bibliography, essay.\n\nGuided Questions: Could the TV episode be akin to the short story? And if so how are both the story and the episode used in science fiction storytelling? When science fiction stories present future worlds, to what extent are they reflecting back on our present, asking questions about how we want to live and what it is to be human?\n\nEnglish 3372: Special Topics in Science Fiction or Fantasy\n\nSection 40 Instructor: Jesse Schotter\n\nThis class will survey some of the most important children's fantasy novelists of the 20th century, from E. Nesbit and C.S. Lewis and J.R.R. Tolkien up through Lloyd Alexander, Ursula K. LeGuin, J.K. Rowling, Diana Wynne Jones, and N.K. Jemisin. We will examine how these two genres--fantasy and children's lit--grew up together, and will explore the varying influences on these writers, from myth and folklore to Christianity and Taoism and Existentialism to feminism and critical race theory.\n\nCourse requirements include a paper, two responses, a final exam, reading quizzes, and, active participation in class discussions.\n\nEnglish 3372: Special Topics in Science Fiction or Fantasy: Fantasy Set in Our World\n\nSection 60 Instructor: David Brewer\n\nWhen most people think of fantasy, they think of fantastic other worlds: Middle Earth, Narnia, Westeros, or at least fantastic worlds hidden away within our own (Hogwarts). But there is a persistent strain of fantasy set squarely in our own world: past, present, or future. This course will investigate the difference it makes to locate fantasy within a world we know and can visit (or at least study the history of or speculate about the future of, based on our current knowledge). What happens when magic, supernatural beings, or any of the other stock elements of fantasy are combined with people and places that, at least in other situations, have seemed quite solid and mundane? It's something of a truism in the study of narrative that what happens depends in large part on where it happens. What sorts of fantastic stories are made available by (or foreclosed by) being set in, say, Seattle or provincial France or at the Target at Easton?\n\nPotential Texts: Leigh Bardugo’s Ninth House, Roshani Chokshi’s The Gilded Wolves, Susanna Clarke’s Jonathan Strange and Mr Norrell, Neil Gaiman’s Neverwhere, and N. K. Jemisin’s The City We Became.\n\nPotential Assignments: A weekly reading journal; a recommendation of a fantastic story set in our world that we are not reading together; a response to one of your colleagues' recommendations; a few short writing exercises; active participation in our discussions; and a significant contribution to a group project in which you sketch out a fantasy narrative set in Columbus, Ohio.\n\nEnglish 3378: Shakespeare and Film\n\nInstructor: Alan Farmer\n\nIn this course, we will study some of the most innovative and influential films ever made of Shakespeare’s plays. We will both read specific plays (probably RICHARD III, A MIDSUMMER NIGHT’S DREAM, MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING, ROMEO AND JULIET, HAMLET, TITUS ANDRONICUS, and MACBETH) and view films that cut across dramatic genres, time periods, countries, and cinematic styles, by such directors as Max Reinhardt (Austria and Germany), Laurence Olivier (England), Akira Kurosawa (Japan), Baz Luhrmann (Australia), Michael Almereyda (U.S.), and Al Pacino (U.S.). We will focus on how directors and actors have chosen to adapt Shakespeare for performance, but also consider how these films have shaped, and continue to shape, the cultural meaning of “Shakespeare” for modern audiences. This course can satisfy various requirements: an upper-level (4000-level) or lower-level (3000-level) course for the English Major and Minor; a course for the Film Studies Minor; a course for the Popular Culture minor; a film course for the Pre-Education Major; and a Historical and Cultural Studies course for the new GE.\n\nPotential Assignments: Requirements will include two essays, several quizzes, a midterm exam, a final exam, regular attendance, and active participation.\n\nGEL: Cultures and Ideas\n\nGEN Foundation: Historical and Cultural Studies\n\nEnglish 3379: Methods for the Study of Writing, Rhetoric and Literacy\n\nSection 10 Instructor: Susan Lang\n\nThis course will introduce students to a continuum of research methods used by scholars in such fields as writing, rhetoric, literacy studies, composition studies, and technical communication. We will focus primarily on empirical research methods. You will learn techniques of these various methods and apply them to a series of activities throughout the semester. During the last month, we will shift focus to writing research in writing, rhetoric, and literacy studies.\n\nEnglish 3395: Literature and Leadership, Reluctant Leaders\n\nInstructor: Shaun James Russell\n\nLeadership is an intrinsic part of the human condition, and is often seen as a defining character trait. Someone can be a \"born leader\" or a \"natural leader,\" and when we think about real-world concerns like politics, social justice, and career development, we place a high value on \"leadership skills,\" broadly defined. It is often said that art imitates life, and the world of literature is full of stories of great leaders and conquering heroes who are much beloved by their followers. But not everyone is born to a leadership role, and the truth is that almost all of us have had to pivot from being supports to being leaders as situations require. Despite what we see in much historic literature, the human who does naught but lead is a rare bird indeed. Instead, when most people take a leadership role, it is often done reluctantly and out of necessity, with little thirst for the glory of command. This idea governs the theme of this course on Literature and Leadership: who are the reluctant leaders in literature and history, and how might we assess their character? Does one kind of \"good leadership\" easily transition to another? Can a group of people in a terrible predicament be a sort of leadership collective? Can a child ever lead, and if so, is it ethical for them to do so? All of these questions are directly connected to some of our readings.\n\nPotential Text: Orson Scott Card, Ender's Game; Robert Graves, I, Claudius; William Shakespeare, Coriolanus; John Steinbeck, The Moon is Down. We will also watch two films, and potentially some other shorter videos/episodes\n\nPotential Assignments: Two reflection papers, a mid-term exam, and a final essay, along with several low-stakes reading quizzes\n\nEnglish 3398: Methods for the Study of Literature\n\nSection 20 Instructor: Clare Simmons\n\nEnglish 3398, Methods for the Study of Literature, is designed to help develop the reading, analytical, research, and writing skills appropriate to the English major. We will read and discuss a variety of texts and practice developing responses both to the text itself and to what others have written about it. The loose topic for the course is nature and the environment, and how people have responded to the natural world in literature through the centuries.\n\nPotential Texts: Readings will likely include Shakespeare’s Tempest, Emily Brontë’s Wuthering Heights, a variety of poetry and short stories representing the natural world and the human impact on it from medieval to current times, and some ecocriticism. In addition we will use a writing handbook.\n\nPotential Assignments: Active engagement with the text and participation in discussion is important to the success of the class. There will be some short discussion prompts, three shorter papers and final research project.\n\nEnglish 3398: Methods for the Study of Literature\n\nSection 30 Instructor: Jacob Risinger\n\nIn this gateway course, we’ll take our cue from one of George Orwell’s famous lines: “If people cannot write well, they cannot think well, and if they cannot think well, others will do their thinking for them.” Over the course of the semester, our weekly readings, discussions, and informal exercises will work to annihilate old patterns of complacent reading—leaving in their place the analytical skills and rhetorical strategies you need to establish your own critical/original perspective on literary texts. We’ll attend to the practical work of conducting literary research and writing solid, well-argued essays—but we’ll also practice using literary theory and various methods of criticism to identify new levels of meaning, even in familiar or (seemingly) straightforward texts. The hard work of writing and analysis will be supplemented by an array of engaging texts by writers like Mary Shelley, Elizabeth Bishop, Kazuo Ishiguro, Claudia Rankine, Jesmyn Ward, and others.\n\nEnglish 3398: Methods for the Study of Literature\n\nSection 40 Instructor: Christopher Jones\n\nSection 60 Instructor: Luke Wilson\n\nServes as the \"Methods\" course for the Literature and Creative Writing concentrations within the English major. Its purpose is to familiarize students with literary studies in such a way as to prepare them for advanced courses in all literary fields and the genres of Creative Writing.\n\nEnglish 3405: Special Topics in Professional Communication: Automating Professional Communication through Interactive Documents, Structured Authoring, and Artificial Intelligence\n\nInstructor: Jonathan Buehl\n\nIn this section of English 3405, you will learn about and practice using technologies that automate different aspects of professional writing. After initial discussions of the history and ethics of automating professional communication, we will explore how to automate writing through different composing tools—including desktop publishing platforms, XML editors, content management systems, and generative AI. Major assignments will be project-based and culminate in a portfolio of samples that demonstrate your ability to automate writing for different contexts.\n\nPotential Assignments: Major assignments will be project-based and culminate in a portfolio of samples that demonstrate your ability to automate writing for different contexts.\n\nEnglish 3465: Intermediate Fiction\n\nInstructor: Trista Koehler\n\nIn this class, we will be exploring the reading, writing, and interpreting of genre fiction. Genre fiction--such as sci-fi, fantasy, romance, or horror--is still regarded in many academic circles as simplistic and non-literary. In this course we will work to break down those barriers and learn to write not only what we know, but what we love, and what we can only imagine\n\nEnglish 3465: Special Topics in Intermediate Fiction Writing: Chapter. One\n\nSection 30 Instructor: Katheryn LeMon\n\nIn the matter of a few pages, a good novel immerses you in a world, introduces you to characters, makes you care about them, and then plunges those characters into a plot that will play out over the course of however many hundred pages. But how, exactly, do they do all that? Together we will explore how published authors have crafted compelling first chapters and use what we?ve learned to draft the openings to our own novels. Later on, we?ll read a few novels in their entirety to see how the promises of their first chapters are developed and expanded into a full novel. We?ll explore different models of plotting and produce an outline that cultivates the seeds we planted in Chapter One.\n\nEnglish 3466: Special Topics in Intermediate Poetry Writing\n\nInstructor: Aline Resende Mello\n\nFor students who have experience with the basic elements of writing poetry. Special topics focus on particular aspects of the genre; advanced techniques are explored.\n\nEnglish 3467S: Issues and Methods in Tutoring Writing\n\nInstructor: Allison Kranek\n\nWelcome to “Issues and Methods in Tutoring Writing”! English/CSTW 3467S focuses on theories and practices in tutoring writing. Whether you’re coming to this class with an interest in tutoring or teaching writing in the future, or are working to better understand how to work with others in individualized ways, this course seeks to equip you with tools to work productively with diverse writers across a variety of contexts. To that end, this course is guided by practical, pedagogical, and scholarly goals. We will use a range of resources to facilitate our learning, including in-class discussion of scholarly texts; observations of writing center sessions; and reflective reading and writing outside of class. These resources and activities are designed to intertwine and inform one another. At the beginning of the semester, we will invite your input on the course themes and shape of the course, but you can generally expect that we will discuss research on writing center theories and pedagogies that help us think about practical best practices for tutoring writing, including tutoring writing across disciplines, inclusive tutoring practices, and tutoring online, to name a few. Finally, we will also work toward an understanding of the writing center as a site of scholarly inquiry, a space where a myriad of forms of writing and research are created, cultivated, and nurtured. Our class will culminate in a research project related to the tutoring of writing.\n\nEnglish 3468: Special Topics in Intermediate Creative Nonfiction Writing\n\nInstructor: Kurt Ostrow\n\nFor students who have experience with the basic elements of writing creative nonfiction. Special topics focus on particular aspects of the genre; advanced techniques are explored.\n\nEnglish 3662: An Introduction to Literary Publishing\n\nSection 10 Instructor: Sappho Stanley\n\n*POETRY FOCUSED LITERARY PUBLISHING* In this course, we will be focusing on the methods and practices a poet may inhabit in relation to publishing. Topics will include writing practices, literary journals, contests, MFA programs, chapbooks, full length collections, how to read in front of an audience, & meetings with people experienced in the industry. We will take a week to discuss practices related to prose writing, as well.\n\nPotential Texts: “Ordinary Genius” by Kim Addonizio\n\nPotential Assignments: Class meetings, collecting poems into a document (10-20 pages)\n\nEnglish 3662: An Introduction to Literary Publishing\n\nSection 20 Instructor: Sophia Huneycutt\n\nAn introduction to the theory and practice of editing and publishing literature.\n\n4000-Level\n\nEnglish 4150: Cultures of Professional Writing\n\nSection 10 Instructor: Christiane Buuck\n\nThis class will offer you a chance to explore to a range of types of workplace writing. Many of our course assignments are designed to help you compile a writing portfolio that will be useful if you apply to the Minor in Professional Writing, and/or in future job searches. Additionally, you will find and interview two professionals in your field of interest. You will hone your editing skills by practicing AP style, reviewing common usage mistakes and how to avoid them, giving and receiving feedback in peer review, practicing repurposing content and drafting for different audiences and revising for clean, professional copy in every deliverable. Throughout the term, you will work individually and collaboratively to explore a professional writing field of your choice, culminating in an engaging group presentation and panel discussion.\n\nPotential Texts: We will read many real world samples of the kinds of writing we'll work on in class.\n\nPotential Assignments: A variety of professional writing genres to help build your professional writing portfolio and your confidence as you anticipate professional spaces.\n\nEnglish 4150: Cultures of Professional Writing\n\nSection 20 Instructor: Jennifer Patton\n\nExamine writing in various workplaces. Analyze writing discourse that shapes professional organizations. Explore ongoing technological and cultural shifts required of workplace writers and the role of digital media.\n\nEnglish 4189: Professional Writing Minor: Capstone Internship\n\nInstructor: Jennifer Patton\n\nStudents work onsite in an organization doing writing-related work and meet weekly to discuss related topics.\n\nEnglish 4515: Chaucer\n\nInstructor: Ethan Knapp\n\nThe aim of this course will be to introduce students to the poetry of Geoffrey Chaucer, starting with his early works and leading up to a reading of large sections of his most famous poem, The Canterbury Tales. Chaucer's poetry offers a window onto an unusually exciting moment of political, cultural and philosophical transformations, and we will consequently read these poems with close attention to the society and culture that produced them, the turbulent end of the fourteenth century. Students should also acquire a familiarity with Chaucer's Middle English and with the literary culture of the time.\n\nPotential Texts: Dream Visions and Other Poems and The Canterbury Tales\n\nPotential Assignments: Two exams and one paper\n\nEnglish 4522: Renaissance Poetry: John Milton\n\nInstructor: Amrita Dhar\n\nIn this course, we will read the major works of the seventeenth-century poet and polemic John Milton, especially Milton's magnificent epic, Paradise Lost. Reading Paradise Lost will be one of the grandest and most surprising and most rewarding literary/readerly/poetic experiences of your lives. Readers who have encountered Milton before are welcome, and even more welcome are those who have not. People who like poetry are welcome, and even more welcome are those who do not. Prepare to be challenged, amazed, and just possibly, to fall in love.\n\nDoing this class in 2024 is special. 2024 will see the 350th anniversary of Paradise Lost, A Poem in Twelve Books, published in 1674.\n\nPotential Texts: Lycidas, Areopagitica, Paradise Lost, Paradise Regained, Samson Agonistes\n\nPotential Assignments: Reflection papers, close reading papers, creative-critical work, and final essay.\n\nEnglish 4533: The Early British Novel, 1688-1808\n\nInstructor: Roxann Wheeler\n\nENG 4533 introduces the modern novel through a deep dive into the cultural and literary history that shaped it. We will focus on eighteenth-century novelists’ experiments in creating a new genre that came to be the preeminent literary form for representing the main character’s interiority at the same time it fostered a robust criticism of the ills of eighteenth-century society, including unchecked patriarchal privilege, especially landowning men’s behavior. As we study the ways that the novel is the middle class genre, we will focus on novelists’ experiments in formal elements of narration, character, tone, setting, plot, and structure: both first and third person narration are undergoing rapid transformation in this era.\n\nI have selected novels that dramatize the cultural debates and literary pleasures on which the early novel hinged. Tales of unrequited love and lethal lust; stories of shipwreck and enslavement on the fringes of the Ottoman and growing European empires in the Americas; representations of the hazards of courtship and marriage; and, depictions of overwrought emotions are the main topics of the early novel that we will study. These novels also explore philosophical issues, including the relationships among property, race, and enslavement; the emergence of individualism and modernity; and gendered and rank-specific behavior that becomes the hallmark of a “civilized people,” freighted with the implications for situating Englishness in a global world both sexually and otherwise. Contemporary counterparts to the novels we will read in literature and film include the interracial male buddy film/police TV show (Robinson Crusoe), the detective novel (Caleb Williams), the Gothic horror/terror film/novel (Caleb Williams and The Wrongs of Woman), the stage musical and soap opera (Pamela), the lives of the rich and famous celebrity exposé (The Fair Jilt and Fantomina), the coming of age novel/film (pretty much everything we are reading in one way or another), the courtship novel/film (Pamela, Evelina, The Woman of Color).\n\nObjectives for the course include your learning influential theories of the eighteenth-century novel, understanding the distinctive kinds of characters, plots, and aesthetics of the early novel, and recognizing the various modes in which the novel is written, including Romance, didacticism, satire, realism, and sensibility, all of which dramatized contemporary social ills distinctively but in ways we still see today (e.g., the #MeToo Movement).\n\nPotential Texts: Aphra Behn's, Oroonoko or The Royal Slave (1688); Daniel Defoe, Robinson Crusoe (1719); Samuel Richardson, Pamela or Virtue Rewarded (1741); Frances Burney, Evelina or A Young Lady's Entrance into the World (1778); Anonymous, The Woman of Color (1808)\n\nPotential Assignments: Short Analytical Papers\n\nEnglish 4542: The Nineteenth-Century British Novel\n\nInstructor: Amanpal Garcha\n\nIn this course, we will study how the novels of the 1800s, in their ways of representing characters and events, reveal some of the major conflicts in nineteenth-century English society. The five works of fiction we will read – by Jane Austen, Emily Bronte, Charles Dickens, Thomas Hardy, and H. G. Wells – try to embrace seemingly irreconcilable ideas: of the aristocracy's age-old cultural power and the new middle class's increasing influence; of a Romantic emphasis on individual passion and freedom and a growing emphasis on social conformity and productivity; of traditional, religious concepts of truth and a new embrace of rationality and science, including Darwin's theory of evolution; of male power and women's changing roles; and of small community identities and the expansion of populous urban cities and of British bureaucratic, capitalist, and imperial power. The class will provide some instruction in how to write critically about the texts we read.\n\nPotential Assignments: Requirements include regular class attendance and participation, the completion of periodic reading quizzes, a few short papers, and a comprehensive final exam.\n\nEnglish 4554: English Studies and Global Human Rights: Trafficking Rhetoric: Human Rights and Modern-Day Slavery\n\nInstructor: Wendy S. Hesford\n\nTrafficking in human beings is a complex, global phenomenon. Human trafficking can be approached as an issue of migration or organized crime that affects state security, and/or from a human rights perspective, since trafficking encompasses a spectrum of human rights abuses. Increasingly, scholars, journalists, and activists classify human trafficking as a form of modern-day slavery. While the analogy between the contemporary problem of human trafficking and the Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade may bring greater attention to human trafficking, it also runs the risk of obscuring the afterlives of racial slavery in the post-civil rights era. In addition to considering both the scholarly promise and limits of the analogy between modern trafficking in humans and the slave trade of the past, this course will examine the formal elements of modern slave narratives, such as raid and rescue motifs, as well as the political role that such narratives play in anti-trafficking campaigns, legislation, and nation-state reports.\n\nPotential Texts: Michelle Alexander, The New Jim Crow: Mass Incarceration in the Age of Colorblindness; Uzodinma Iweala, Beasts of No Nation; Zana Muhsen, Sold: One Woman’s True Account of Modern Slavery; Louise Shelley, Human Trafficking: A Global Perspective\n\nPotential Assignments: Two essays and one visual project (photoshop)\n\nEnglish 4563: Contemporary Literature\n\nInstructor: Jessica Prinz\n\nA study of poetry and prose written since approximately 1960.\n\nEnglish 4565: Advanced Fiction Writing\n\nSection 10 Instructor: Nick White\n\nSection 20 Instructor: Christopher Vanjonack\n\nAdvanced workshop in the writing of fiction. This is a class for serious students of creative writing. Admission is by portfolio submission to the instructor.\n\nEnglish 4566: Advanced Poetry Writing\n\nInstructor: Zoe Thompson\n\nAdvanced workshop in the writing of poetry. This is a class for serious students of creative writing. Admission is by portfolio submission to the instructor.\n\nEnglish 4568: Advanced Creative Nonfiction\n\nInstructor: Elissa Washuta\n\nThe advanced creative nonfiction workshop is devoted to furthering your development of the craft of creative nonfiction. Through studying published nonfiction pieces and craft texts, developing new work, responding to peers’ manuscripts, and revising your essays, you will continue to refine your individual approach and further your understanding of how to most effectively use craft elements to shape your work.\n\nPotential Texts: No textbook will be required. Various essays and craft texts will be provided via Carmen. The bulk of students’ reading will consist of their peers’ workshop essays.\n\nPotential Assignments: Workshop essays, peer responses, writing exercises, and brief reading responses\n\nEnglish 4569: Digital Media and English Studies\n\nInstructor: Calvin Olsen\n\nStudents in 4569 will use the programable Arduino platform to explore the rhetorical possibilities of interactive digital objects, paying particular attention to the new forms of digital creativity these tools are enabling. In this way, students will not only analyze digital objects but become makers themselves, thinking about new relations between people and the physical world that are enabled by our devices and the new forms of writing they can support.\n\nPotential Texts: Massimo Banzi and Michael Shiloh, Getting Started with Arduino: The Open Source Electronics Prototyping Platform, 3rd Edition Readings supplied by the instructor\n\nPotential Assignments: Students will create multiple interactive design projects, a short paper, and take occasional quizzes.\n\nEnglish 4572: English Grammar and Usage\n\nSection 10 and 20 Instructor: Daniel Seward\n\nIn this class, we will explore English grammar as both a natural phenomenon and as an artificial collection of usage rules traditionally taught as the Standard, all while considering the social and ethical implications of using (or not using) and teaching (or not teaching) the Standard. Alongside lessons on English syntax and pragmatics, we will consider the affordances of non-standard English usage associated with particular discourse communities, as well as the ways spoken and written expression contribute to our personal, social, and cultural identities. Finally, we will consider what it means to be a good \"citizen-grammarian\": that is, someone who can offer accurate, pragmatic, and socially conscientious guidance about usage, all without simplistically privileging standardized forms, which tend to reflect the preferences of already-privileged discourse communities.\n\nPotential Texts: Required textbook: Louise Cummings, Working with English Grammar (Cambridge UP, 2018). This is available in print or electronic formats. Other readings on writing style will be distributed on Carmen as PDF documents or through URLs.\n\nPotential Assignments: Three online, open-resource exams; a Lexical Field Guide focusing on usage in a particular discourse community; weekly participation postings in various forms\n\nEnglish 4572: English Grammar and Usage\n\nSection 30 Instructor: Lauen Squires\n\nIn this class you will learn to describe and analyze the structure of English sentences. You will become familiar with the concepts and patterns of grammar from a linguistic—a scientific—perspective. We will seek to understand the linguistic principles that underlie all speaking and writing in English. Importantly, this is not a writing course, an editing course, or a course designed to teach people how to speak/write in English. However, our enhanced understanding of how English grammar is structured will ultimately equip you with the skills to more critically understand speaking and writing styles, including effective writing and products designed to encourage it, such as usage handbooks and language-learning pedagogical materials.\n\nPotential Texts: Online open-access (free) textbook\n\nPotential Assignments: Midterm; final; journal; final assignment\n\nGuiding Question: How do English sentences work?\n\nEnglish 4577.02: Legend, Superstition, and Folk Belief\n\nInstructor: Merrill Kaplan\n\nHave you heard? Rumors and conspiracy theories, spooky stories and superstitions, fake news and folk belief: folklorists study all these things and more as legendry. Societies work through their most pressing fears, beliefs, and doubts in just-might-be-true tales that spread like wildfire in every medium. Take this course for a deep dive into how we crystalize cultural anxieties into stories, memes, and TikToks and use them to debate the nature of our world. Your social media feed is already full of this stuff. Get the tools to understand it.\n\nPotential Texts: McNeill, Lynne S. Folklore Rules: A Fun, Quick, and Useful Introduction to the Field of Academic Folklore Studies. Utah State University Press, 2013.\n\nPotential Assignments: Students will identify examples legendry \"in the wild,\" document and interpret them as cultural expressions.\n\nEnglish 4578: Special Topics in Film: The Musical\n\nSection 20 Instructor: David Brewer\n\nThis course will investigate what is perhaps simultaneously the most beloved and the most mocked of all film genres: the musical. We’ll explore the enduring appeal of characters bursting into song and dance when their emotions swell. We’ll investigate the perennial (and perhaps perennially flawed) attempts of filmmakers to make musicals edgier or cooler in some way. And we’ll consider why such an inherently ridiculous and unrealistic form should persist, despite all of the changes to both society and the film industry over the past century.\n\nPotential Texts: Singin' in the Rain; The Wizard of Oz; West Side Story; Cabaret; The Rocky Horror Picture Show; Grease; The Little Mermaid; Hedwig and the Angry Inch; Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street; Across the Universe; and Hamilton.\n\nPotential Assignments: A weekly viewing journal; a recommendation of a musical we are not watching together; a response to a colleague's recommendation; a few short writing exercises; active participation in our discussions; and a significant contribution to a group project in which you collectively sketch out a new film musical.\n\nEnglish 4578: Special Topics in Film: FILM AND AMERICAN SOCIETY AFTER WORLD WAR II\n\nSection 30 Instructor: Ryan Friedman\n\nThis course examines the history of the American cinema in the years immediately following the Second World War, covering the period from 1945 to 1960. We will view and discuss significant Hollywood films from a variety of genres (e.g., comedy, musical, film noir, western, melodrama, social problem film), contextualizing them by reading articles and excerpts from a variety of sources (e.g., popular magazines, film-trade publications, books of popular sociology, design treatises, political speeches) published during the era in which these films were produced and released. These textual primary sources will serve to illustrate historical discourses describing, reinforcing, and/or critiquing what were conceived of as significant social issues and shifts—from the “veterans problem,” to the “housing crisis,” to “juvenile delinquency,” to sexism, and racial segregation in schools. In our discussions, we’ll be interested in how the assigned films reflected, responded to, and inflected the print debates happening around these issues and shifts—even and perhaps especially when the films are not overtly working in the “social problem” genre. We’ll also approach the films in the context of the upheavals happening in the American film industry during this period, as a result of the Paramount decree, the HUAC hearings, suburbanization, and declining movie theater attendance. In particular, we’ll examine the ways in which the rise of television as a competing medium of mass entertainment shaped the stories that Hollywood movies told and the visual devices that they used to dramatize these stories.\n\nPotential Texts: Genre films and supporting primary texts from the postwar era.\n\nPotential Assignments: Weekly quizzes, group presentation, analytical essay, take-home final exam.\n\nEnglish 4581: Special Topics in U.S. Ethnic Literatures\n\nInstructor: Pranav Jani\n\nStudy of selected issues or forms in U.S. ethnic literatures and cultures. Topic varies. Examples: Native American autobiography, Asian American poetry; Latino/a novel.\n\nEnglish 4583: Special Topics in World Literature in English\n\nInstructor: Pranav Jani\n\nStudy of literatures written in English and produced outside of the U.S. and Britain; topics include colonial/postcolonial writing, regional literature, theoretical and historical approaches, genres.\n\nEnglish 4588: Introduction to Latinx Literature and Culture\n\nInstructor: Mintzi A Martinez-Rivera\n\nThrough the study of oral narratives (such as legends, corridos, and wordplay), novels (including Children and YA novels), poetry, short stories, musicals, and films, this course offers a broad introduction to the study of U.S. Latinx Literature and Culture. Moving among and away from the canon, we will explore issues of race and ethnicity, citizenship and belonging, ideologies of gender and sexuality, revolution and social movements, growing up in the U.S., among other topics, as they relate to the experience of Latinx communities living in the U.S. Through different assignments, students will have the opportunity to investigate a topic of their choice and create their own (non)creative project.\n\nEnglish 4590.06H: The Modern Period\n\nInstructor: Jessica Prinz\n\nIntensive study of The Modern Period.\n\nEnglish 4592: Special Topics in Women, Literature, and Culture: Women’s Sonnets\n\nSection 10 Instructor: Jennifer Higginbotham\n\nWomen played an influential role in the development of the sonnet. When the Italian poet Petrarch popularized the form in the fourteenth century, he started an ongoing literary tradition, and women have been at the forefront of its innovation almost from the start. Initially present only as love objects, women quickly adapted the form to their own poetic voices. The Protestant exile Anne Locke was responsible for getting the first sonnet sequence in English published in 1560 when she appended Thomas Norton’s paraphrases of Psalm 51 to her translation of one of Calvin’s sermons, while women like Elizabeth Carey, Lady Berkeley participated in the translation of Petrarch’s original Canzoniere in the 1590s. After we dive into the mechanics of what makes a sonnet “a sonnet,” we’ll apply our knowledge to trace the history of women’s sonnets from the sixteenth century to today. In addition to gaining mastery of poetic form, students will engage with feminist and queer theory to explore what sonnets help us understand about gender and sexuality, and what gender and sexuality can help us understand about sonnets.\n\nEnglish 4592: Special Topics in Women's Literature: Artists and Artistry in U.S. Women's Writing\n\nSection 20 Instructor: Susan Williams\n\nSome of the most popular fiction by U.S. women, both in the 19th century and today, has featured characters and plots that focus on women writers and artists. From the March sisters' dreams of acting, painting, writing, and playing the piano in *Little Women* to the photographer Mia Warren in Celeste Ng's *Little Fires Everywhere*, best-selling authors have explored both the power of and barriers to artistry faced by amateur and professional practitioners. In this class, we will think about the enduring interest in the figure of the artist for U.S. women writers from both an historical and cultural perspective. We will also consider how and why these texts have inspired adaptations across a number of genres. Along the way, we will examine the nature of creative practice; the relation between craft and art; the evolving nature of \"genius\"; and the enduring power of art in U.S. culture.\n\nPotential Texts: Louisa May Alcott's, Little Women; Elizabeth Keckley, Behind the Scenes; Rebecca Harding Davis, Life in the Iron Mills; Tracy Chevalier, Girl with a Pearl Earring; Celeste Ng, Little Fires Everywhere\n\nPotential Assignments: Assignments will likely include one brief research paper; short in-class and homework exercises; a midterm exam; and a final project.\n\nEnglish 4592: Special Topics in Women in Literature and Culture: \"The Surplus Woman Debate and the Beginnings of Feminism.\"\n\nSection 30 Instructor: Clare Simmons\n\nEnglish 4592 fulfills an upper-level literature requirement for any English major; it is a requirement for the Pre-Education concentration.\n\nThe British Census of 1851 revealed that there were perhaps half a million more women in Britain than there were men, leading to the conclusion that many women would never be wives. If marriage could no longer be assumed to be the ultimate goal of women’s lives, this raised the question of what women’s roles in society should be. Modern feminism owes much of its origins to debates over the so-called “Surplus Woman Question,” so in this course we will read examples of nineteenth-century women’s writing that challenge earlier notions of womanhood and that present a variety of answers as to how women might find personal fulfillment. Most of the texts that we will read provide insight not only into women’s lives but also into representations of race and colonialism in the nineteenth century.\n\nPotential Texts: Louisa May Alcott, Work; Charlotte Brontë, Jane Eyre; Elizabeth Barrett Browning, Aurora Leigh; Lydia Maria Child, Hilda Silfverling; Diana Mulock Craik, The Half-Caste; Florence Nightingale, Cassandra; Christina Rossetti, Goblin Market; Mary Seacole, Wonderful Adventures in Many Lands.\n\nPotential Assignments: Presentation; short paper; longer research paper; reading preparation questions\n\nEnglish 4597.01: The Disability Experience in the Contemporary World: Disability Poetry, Milton and Beyond\n\nInstructor: Amrita Dhar\n\nThis advanced undergraduate seminar on critical disability studies will centre the disability poetics of John Milton, the seventeenth-century poet and polemic who is to this day credited with creating the greatest epic poem in the English language, Paradise Lost, a poem he composed while completely blind. Here are some of the questions we will consider: how does one write a poem that is 10,500+ lines long (and that is so beautiful that it is read hundreds of years on and celebrated in languages across the world) while blind, and In a time before assistive technology, before Braille, before even electricity? What does that composition look like--and where does it come from? What has the poem meant to generations of disabled writers, and what does it mean today in our world?\n\nReaders who have encountered Milton before are welcome, and even more welcome are those who have not. Those who enjoy poetry are welcome, and even more welcome are those who do not. Paradise Lost, which is often regarded as one of the most difficult and most allusive poems ever written, is also one of the most accessible poems ever written. It is a poem of genuine access and accommodation—matters which have become even more current and urgent in our day than they were in Milton’s. But Milton will always remain one of those who started the conversation to get us here.\n\nDoing this class in 2024 is special. 2024 will see the 350th anniversary of Paradise Lost, A Poem in Twelve Books, published in 1674.\n\nPotential Texts: Paradise Lost, Contemporary afterlives of Paradise Lost, Sonnets responding to Milton/Milton's sonnets\n\nPotential Assignments: Reflection papers, close reading papers, creative-critical work, final project.\n\n5000-Level\n\nEnglish 5191: Internship in English Studies\n\nSection 30 Instructor: Staff\n\nSection 40 Instructor: Elizabeth Falter\n\nThis internship opportunity will offer students experience in creating timely, relevant and compelling short-form promotional media (primarily video and audio) for the Department of English. Students will work closely with their supervisor as well as with key communications personnel to develop projects and set priorities and deadlines. English 5191, Promotional Media Internship, will be intensely hands-on and focus almost exclusively on digital media production and related work-management skills in professional settings. This internship opportunity is especially applicable to students across majors who would like to develop their digital media skills in a workplace setting and for those who have digital media skills with nowhere to apply them. Media skills are NOT a pre-requisite for this internship; students will have the opportunity to learn all media skills necessary for the class. (This internship fulfills the digital media requirement for the Writing, Rhetoric and Literacy concentration in the English Major.)\n\nPotential Assignments: YouTube videos, podcasts.\n\nGuiding Questions: How can a promotional media internship opportunity help students across majors develop their digital media skills in a workplace setting?\n\nEnglish 5664: Studies in Graphic Narrative: Graphic Memoir\n\nInstructor: Robyn Warhol\n\nA course designed for both advanced undergraduates and graduate students, “Graphic Memoir” will introduce the styles, structures, and strategies of autobiographical life stories told in comics form. Beginning with the insights we can gain about the form from how-to books drawn by comics artists Scott McCloud (Making Comics) and Matt Madden (99 Ways to Tell a Story: Exercises in Style), we will read graphic memoirs in a range of genres and media, asking what it means to put the “graph” in “autobiography.”\n\nThe class will tour the collection at the Billy Ireland Cartoon Library and Museum on the OSU campus, which will be the focus of students’ research projects.\n\nPotential Texts: Among author graphic memoirs we will read \"Maus\" by Art Spiegelman, \"Fun Home\" by Alison Bechdel, \"One! Hundred! Demons!\" by Lynda Barry, \"Diary of a Teenaged Girl\" by Phoebe Gloeckner, \"Vietnamerica\" by G. B. Tranh, \"Hyperbole and a Half\" by Allie Brosh, \"Epileptic\" by David B, \"Cancer Vixen\" by Marisa Acochella Marchetto and others.\n\nPotential Assignments: Assignments will include an in-class oral critique of a critical article on graphic memoir; an in-class oral presentation on a short passage from a graphic memoir; weekly 250-word reading responses that answer a question posted after each class on Carmen; a one-page “snippet” of graphic memoir; and a research paper or an extended graphic memoir project.\n\nEnglish 5711: Intermediate Old English\n\nInstructor: Staff\n\nStudents with intermediate or advanced reading knowledge of Old English will continue their study of Old English to strengthen translation skills, explore scholarship in the field, and learn discipline-specific research tools.\n\nEnglish 5721.01: Graduate Studies in Renaissance Drama: Religion on Stage\n\nInstructor: Hannibal Hamlin\n\nSo what will a course on Renaissance Drama and Religion cover? Easy answer: the dramatic representation of everything that matters. Life, death, and what (?) comes next. Love, sex, and desire. Sin, corruption, and evil. Grace, forgiveness, and salvation. Politics and power, free will and fate, conflict and violence, martyrdom and conversion, plagues and earthquakes, gardens and games. It’s been argued that atheism was impossible in Renaissance Europe, but even if that’s not true, every man, woman, and child in England was required by law to attend church on Sundays and holidays, and most everyone did. Even among those few who didn’t, most risked punishment only to worship in a different way, Catholics persisting secretly in their faith in the midst of a Protestant nation, and a tiny number of Jews persisting in theirs even more secretly, Jews having been banished from England in the 12th century. Early moderns would not understand our word “religion” since everyone was in a basic sense religious, “religion” pervaded and influenced every aspect of daily life, and the Bible (the basis of Christian) was popular culture to an extent nothing in modern culture can approach.\n\nPotential Texts: We’ll begin with some popular medieval plays, whose influence lasted long after their last performances. Sixteenth- and seventeenth-century plays will include Marlowe’s Doctor Faustus, about the legendary scholar who sells his soul to the devil, and the team-written The Witch of Edmonton, about an old woman who sells her soul to a black dog named Tom, who also happens to be the devil. We’ll look at the collision and conflict of Protestants and Catholics, Christians, Jews, and Muslims, in Shakespeare’s Hamlet, Massinger’s The Renegado, Dekker’s The Whore of Babylon, and Marlowe’s Jew of Malta. Peele’s David and Bethsabe and Greene and Lodge’s Looking Glass for London and England adapt biblical stories for the London stage, telling stories of sin and punishment, prophecy and repentance. Many plays reflect popular religious belief and practice as well as church orthodoxy, but only Jonson’s Bartholomew Fair features a Bible-based debate about gender and cross-dressing between a Puritan and a puppet.\n\nPotential Assignments: Evaluation will based on participation in discussion, a seminar presentation, and shorter and longer essays\n\n**English 5721 is open to graduate students and also experienced undergraduates, with the permission of the instructor.**\n\n1000-Level\n\nEnglish 1110.01: First Year English Composition\n\nInstructor: Staff\n\nPractice in the fundamentals of expository writing, as illustrated in the student's own writing & in the essays of professional writers.\n\nGEL: Writing and Communication, Level 1\n\nGEN: Foundation - Writing and Information Literacy\n\nEnglish 1110.02: First Year English Composition\n\nInstructor: Staff\n\nPractice in the fundamentals of expository writing, as illustrated in the student's own writing & in the essays of professional writers.\n\nGEL: Writing and Communication, Level 1\n\nGEN: Foundation - Writing and Information Literacy\n\nEnglish 1110.03: First Year English Composition\n\nInstructor: Staff\n\nPractice in the fundamentals of expository writing, as illustrated in the student's own writing & in the essays of professional writers.\n\nGEL: Writing and Communication, Level 1\n\nGEN: Foundation - Writing and Information Literacy\n\nEnglish 1193: Individual Studies\n\nInstructor: Christiane Buuck\n\nIntensive practice in the fundamentals of expository writing.\n\n2000-Level\n\nEnglish 2201: British Literature, Medieval-1800\n\nInstructor: Karen Winstead\n\nThe readings and lectures will introduce you to trends, authors and works from each of the four major periods of pre-1800 British literature and explore the contexts—social, historical, political, cultural—within which works were written and read. You will discover important forerunners of today’s popular genres, including horror, romance, comics and science fiction.\n\nPotential Texts: Students will read a free online textbook I that developed specifically for this course.\n\nPotential Assignments: Weekly quizzes will help consolidate your knowledge, while weekly writing assignments and discussions will challenge you to apply what you learned and to grow intellectually from your colleagues’ insights. The final portfolio project encourages you to channel your knowledge and thinking in creative ways.\n\nGEL: Literature\n\nGEL: Diversity - Global Studies\n\nGEN: Foundation - Literary, Visual and Performing Arts\n\nEnglish 2220: Introduction to Shakespeare\n\nSection 10 Instructor: Jennifer Higginbotham\n\nStudy of selected plays designed to give an understanding of drama as theatrical art and as an interpretation of fundamental human experience\n\nGEL: Literature\n\nGEL: Diversity - Global Studies\n\nGEN: Foundation - Literary, Visual & Performing Arts\n\nEnglish 2220H: Honors Introduction to Shakespeare\n\nInstructor: Luke Wilson\n\nShakespeare continues to astound us over 400 years after his death. What's that all about? Why does he still occupy the top spot in the hierarchy of the literary - especially when what he wrote was not considered high literature at the time he wrote it? Our aim in this course will be to increase your understanding and enjoyment of Shakespeare’s plays; to give you a sense of the kinds of critical debates that surround the plays, and enough historical context to make clear how the times in which Shakespeare lived both differed from and resembled our own; and to lodge in your mind for future reference at least a bit of Shakespeare’s language. Our primary concern will be with Shakespeare’s text, but we will also spend some time discussing theatrical performances as well as film adaptations. We'll read about five plays, and possibly some of Shakespeare's sonnets. Plays may include Twelfth Night, Measure for Measure, King Lear, Coriolanus and The Winter's Tale.\n\nPotential Texts: The Norton Shakespeare, ed. Stephen Greenblatt, et al. 3rd ed. Norton, 2015. Vol. 1: Early Plays and Poems; Vol 1: Early Plays; Vol. 2: Later Plays.\n\nPotential Assignments: A paper, a group presentation, a critical article review, several short, informal writing assignments.\n\nGuiding Questions: What's the big deal about Shakespeare? How can we read Shakespeare in light of and as an expression of the period in English history in which he wrote? What would going to the theater have been like during his lifetime? How have filmmakers tapped into and transformed his texts? Why is he still a big box office draw at the movies?\n\nGEL: Literature\n\nGEL: Diversity - Global Studies\n\nGEN: Foundation - Literary, Visual and Performing Arts\n\nEnglish 2221: Introduction the Shakespeare, Race and Gender\n\nInstructor: Sarah Neville\n\nThis course explores the historical roots of our ideas about race and gender by way of Shakespeare and the culture in which he wrote. Students will learn how Shakespeare's formulations of issues of race and gender are products of a time when both categories were undergoing significant conceptual development and how Shakespeare's ways of imagining this turbulence continues to resonate today.\n\nGEN: Foundation - Race, Ethnicity & Gender Diversity\n\nEnglish 2260: Introduction to Poetry\n\nInstructor: Shaun Russell\n\nWhen you think of poetry, do you think of old, dead white guys? You would be forgiven for thinking so, and British poetry largely started out that way; but even in history, this form of literature is not the monolith it is sometimes made out to be. With that idea in mind, this Intro to Poetry course has the thematic subtitle of \"The Renaissance and Everything After.\" While this course is a true survey, we will also explore the idea that much of the poetry that came after the Renaissance (also known as the early modern era) is both directly and indirectly indebted to the Renaissance in many ways. As a result, we will start the course with several weeks of early modern poetry before we segue into transhistorical and transatlantic poetry to see if we can make connections between the poems written in different centuries on different continents, and the poems written in 16th- and 17th-century Britain. In addition to many of the key figures of Renaissance poetry, such as Spenser, Shakespeare, Donne, Herbert and Milton (i.e. the traditional \"canon\"), we will also spend considerable time on women poets and poets of color, all with a view toward exploring the interconnectedness of influence across eras and areas.\n\nPotential Texts: Norton Anthology of Poetry, 6th edition\n\nPotential Assignments: Regular short reading quizzes, a close-reading assignment, a mid-term exam and a final research essay.\n\nGuiding Question: How did poetry of the English Renaissance influence the poetry that came after it?\n\nGEL: Literature\n\nGEN: Foundation - Literary, Visual & Performing Arts\n\nEnglish 2261: Introduction to Fiction\n\nSection 20: Jessica Prinz\n\nSection 70: Roxann Wheeler\n\nSection 80: Sandra MacPherson\n\nExamination of the elements of fiction -- plot, character, setting, narrative, perspective, theme, etc. -- and their various interrelations; comparisons with nonfictional narrative may be included.\n\nGEL: Literature\n\nGEN: Foundation - Literary, Visual & Performing Arts\n\nEnglish 2261 (30): Introduction to Fiction\n\nInstructor: Jill Galvan\n\nThis course has two goals.
