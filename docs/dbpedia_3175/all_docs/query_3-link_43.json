As students read foundational works of literature and other historical documents written between 1600 and 1900, they’ll review and extend skills in five domains: analyzing literature, analyzing informational text, writing, speaking and listening, and language study, which includes word knowledge and grammar skills. Each module or unit begins with a lesson that provides historical context for the era and introduces themes that emerged in the literature of that era. Each lesson provides students with an opportunity to review basic analysis skills before applying those skills to works of literature or key historical documents. Lessons focused on more difficult historical documents include activities that help students comprehend the complex ideas in these works. The Honors level of the course provides additional challenging assignments aimed at preparing college-bound students for advanced work in the study of literature and language arts.\n\nWriting modes addressed in Semester A of this course include narrative, reflective, persuasive, and analytical modes. Assignments emphasize the use of details, evidence, and reasoning to support ideas; writing lessons include model essays that demonstrate key features of each mode. The speaking and listening lessons in Semester A cover rhetoric, the peer review or writing workshop process, and performance skills. Vocabulary development instruction is integrated into literature and informational text lessons. Each unit ends with an authentic assessment that presents students with a real-world scenario requiring some of the skills they learned in the unit.\n\nCourse Description Semester B\n\nSemester B of Honors English 11 consists of units focused on historical eras and literary movements of the 20th and 21st century, such as Naturalism, Imagism, the Harlem Renaissance, and Post-Modernism. Literature analysis lessons in semester B focus on the forms of literature that were most commonly written during the Twentieth Century and how the forms, styles, and techniques of that century inform literature written today. Students will also evaluate various modes and forms of language expression, including single media and multimedia messages. Writing and informational text lessons guide students through the stages of a rigorous research process and demonstrate how to evaluate, integrate, and share the information gathered during research. Students are required to share their ideas and analysis using several different modes, including oral and multimedia presentations. As in Semester A, the second semester of Honors English 11 provides additional challenging assignments aimed at preparing college-bound students for advanced work in the study of literature and language arts.\n\nGrade Level\n\n11-12\n\nMaterials\n\nThe Scarlet Letter\n\nThe Great Gatsby\n\nDuration\n\n2 semesters/1.0 credit\n\nCourse Description Semester A\n\nThe science of biology must begin with cell theory, including the structure, function, and chemistry of the cell. Cells form the primary level of organization of all living things. The chemistry and function of each cell shapes the lifestyle of the organism, from feeding to reproductive patterns. This first course in biology focuses on the life of the cell, dealing with issues of structure, transport, genetics, protein synthesis, energy production, and usage. The tools of science are explained and then focused on the living systems in the cell. In the case of genetics, the molecular behavior of DNA is elaborated to show how it determines the visible traits of the organism and population. Thus, students are led on a tour of living systems from the tiniest to the broadest levels of organization. During this tour, students will employ text, computer simulations, and hands-on investigation to verify each concept and make them relevant to what they see each day. The aim of this course is to guide the student to see the world in biological terms and then to expand their vision to contemplate current topics in biological research and application.\n\nStudents work through and complete several self-check activities and quizzes for practice, and they participate in self-reflection. In each unit, students complete the unit exam. Teacher feedback is provided throughout the course.\n\nHonors students are expected to complete additional assignments throughout the course that build on the content provided. These assignments allow students to go above and beyond the curriculum content in creativity and application.\n\nCourse Description Semester B\n\nBiology B is a continuation of the basic course in biology, Biology A. The major concepts covered are population dynamics and evolution. Students explore population dynamics through the study of mutualism, predation, parasitism, and competition. The theory of evolution is presented, along with the many evidences and details that make evolution the backbone of modern biology. From biochemistry to evolution, biology fascinates people. Biochemists first astounded the world by showing that life obeys the same chemical principles as all creation, but that life engineers chemistry to its own needs. Decades later, Darwin shocked the world by suggesting that life evolves according to the conditions of the environment it inhabits. Evolution, often debated and derided, has survived to become a key concept of biology. This second course in biology examines the wonder of life and its mechanisms.\n\nStudents work through and complete several self-check activities and quizzes for practice and participate in self-reflection.

The three major themes of this course are the cell, the molecular basis of heredity, and the interdependence of organisms. Students who take this class will have a deeper appreciation for the complexities of living organisms. Life on this planet, unlike anywhere else in the observable universe, is complex and highly organized. Whether examining life on the molecular or the planetary level, it exhibits a highly organized structure that inspires awe by its genius and complexity. In the last 50 years, discoveries have launched new branches of biology that have transformed the daily routine, from conception to death. New challenges await, such as the current crisis in ecology, global warming, and the resurgence in viral disease. To make rational choices in the 21st century, the citizen must have a basic understanding of biological concepts and the reasoning behind them. Biology A is presented in a multimedia format using interactive modules, labs, narrated animation, text, and videos to present the study of life on this planet.\n\nStudents work through and complete several self-check activities and quizzes for practice and participate in self-reflection. In each unit, students complete the unit exam. Teacher feedback is provided throughout the course.\n\nCourse Description Semester B\n\nBiology B is a continuation of the basic course in biology, Biology A. The major concepts covered are population dynamics and evolution. Students explore population dynamics through the study of mutualism, predation, parasitism, and competition. The theory of evolution is presented, along with the many evidences and details that make evolution the backbone of modern biology. From biochemistry to evolution, biology fascinates people. Biochemists first astounded the world by showing that life obeys the same chemical principles as all creation, but that life engineers chemistry to its own needs. Decades later, Darwin shocked the world by suggesting that life evolves according to the conditions of the environment it inhabits. Evolution, often debated and derided, has survived to become a key concept of biology. This second course in biology examines the wonder of life and its mechanisms.\n\nStudents work through and complete several self-check activities and quizzes for practice and participate in self-reflection.

Early lessons in the course guide students to build a conceptual framework for studying ethnicity and ethnic groups, based on the relationships among identity, ethnicity, race, and nationality. At the beginning of the course, students will analyze how cultural assumptions and biases influence both individual identity and people’s perceptions of others. Additionally, lessons about the origins of culture in early civilizations and the ways that humans organized themselves socially as populations increased will provide background knowledge that students need to study ethnicity in the United States.\n\nLater lessons introduce the histories and cultures of specific ethnic groups in the United States and help students understand how identity and experience are sometimes shaped by belonging to these groups. Students will then investigate factors that lead members of different ethnic groups to immigrate to the United States and consider how these groups and their cultures have shaped American society. Students will also analyze the power structures that impact the lived experiences of Americans in various ethnic groups, identifying patterns of oppression and resistance throughout each group’s history.\n\nThroughout the course, students are encouraged to identify and appreciate aspects of their own identity as well as the cultures, strengths, achievements, and values of the major ethnic groups in the United States. A key feature of the course is the emphasis given to the perspectives of individuals from historically marginalized groups that are rarely represented in textbooks. The goal is to add these voices to the larger historical narrative so that students can see themselves and all of their classmates as vital parts of the American story.\n\nMajor Concepts\n\nEthnicity, Culture, and Nationality\n\nBuilding Community\n\nRegional Focus: North & South America\n\nRegional Focus: Africa & the Middle East\n\nRegional Focus: Australia & Oceania\n\nRegional Focus: Europe & Asia\n\nGrade Level\n\n9-12\n\nMaterials\n\nNone\n\nDuration\n\n1 semester/0.5 credit\n\nCourse Description: Semester A\n\nThis course covers the discovery, development, and growth of the United States.
