        "text": "by J. BRETT MIKETTA, Assistant Professor and DEBORAH LUDFORD, Assistant Professor Glendale Community College Glendale, Calif. For this research, the term \"multimedia\" was limited to the development of strategies and tools to supplement existing in-class presentation methodologies. Funding for the tools used in this effort came from our Title III grant. \"Tools,\" in this case, refers to hardware, software and peripheral equipment used to provide a mixture of sound, text, voice, full-motion video, photos, graphics, exercises and animation for instructor-controlled presentations. Our basic strategy was to define an instructor-friendly multimedia environment that was interactive and would facilitate the integration of multimedia elements into classroom teaching. The interactivity of this environment was a key factor; it was defined as \"the ability of the instructor to control the delivery of the multimedia elements, presented on separate monitors, independently of the presentation software displayed on the central screen.\" This function enabled an instructor to select a multimedia element at will and correlate it to the ongoing lecture. The hardware we used included: videodisc player, CD-ROM drive, VCR, Macintosh IIci and Macintosh SE, 44MB removable cartridge drive, overhead projector (4,000 lumen), an LCD panel, stereo speakers and a remote mouse. Software included System 7.0, Persuasion (formerly by Aldus, which has since been acquired and merged with Adobe Systems), PowerPoint and HyperCard. Focus of Research: Creating a Template Our efforts focused on developing an interactive courseware template that could be readily implemented and evaluated in our Computer Science/Information Science 101 classes. This template had to be generic in format, user friendly and work on a cart-based portable multimedia station. We quickly discovered that due to processing constraints, seamless integration required using two computers. The first would be loaded with appropriate presentation software and used to deliver the text-based slides that would be shown during a particular lecture. The second computer would be loaded with a scripting language that would provide the instructor with a graphical user interface to control the delivery of various multimedia elements to the television monitors. We wanted to develop a highly user-friendly method that could be used across campus to implement multimedia in the classroom. If faculty became familiar with this approach, they might be more receptive to implementing multimedia in their classes. Many publishers, for example, now provide multimedia resources with the adoption of a text. Finally, we undertook this project in order to explore potential increases in student retention, comprehension, participation and academic success.\n\n1-3654\n\nThis article originally appeared in the 08/01/1995 issue of THE Journal."
