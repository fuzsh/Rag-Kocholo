        "text": "Aldus Corporation released a number of desktop publishing software titles until the buyout/merger with Adobe in 1994.\n\nWhen Aldus president Paul Brainerd joined forces with four software engineers in 1984, their goal was to redefine the way people communicated. Their vision was embodied in PageMaker, the premiere desktop publishing package that allowed people to easily combine text and graphics on a page. \"We faced many challenges in the early days, not the least of which was finding a name for our company. We were introducing a new form of publishing and in the process creating a new market. Our name needed to reflect that. We considered a hundred or more names, but nothing worked for us,\" recalls Brainerd. Eventually a reference librarian at the Oregon State University library in Corvallis located a book on the history of publishing that explained the contributions of Aldus Manutius, a 15th-Century Renaissance printing pioneer who introduced the small book format, italicized type, and standardized punctuation. \"The parallels were immediately evident,\" states Brainerd. \"Like Aldus, we were basing our new approach to publishing on the recent technological advancements of our time. For us these were the microcomputer and the laser printer rather than the Gutenberg press.\"\n\nProducts\n\nAldus SuperPaint\n\nAldus PageMaker\n\nAldus FreeHand\n\nAldus Persuasion\n\nAldus HomePublisher\n\nAldus Gallery Effects\n\nAldus Personal Press\n\nAldus Fetch\n\nAldus IntelliDraw\n\nPromotional Items"
