        "text": "THE newly-reorganised Adobe, the result of the recent merger between graphics software giants Adobe Systems and Aldus, formally introduced three of its products in Hong Kong last week as the company worked to define its strategy for the region.\n\nThe three products, released within the last month, include a Chinese and Korean version of Aldus PageMaker 5.0 for the Macintosh, version 3.0 of Adobe Photoshop and Aldus Persuasion version 3.0 for the Power Macintosh.\n\nThis launch appears to be the start of increased focus on Asia for Adobe which, historically, has not had as aggressive a localisation programme as some companies such as Lotus.\n\nAccording to Rebecca Gross, the company's Far East marketing manager, Adobe plans local versions of PageMaker 5.0 for Windows, Photoshop 3.0 for Windows and the Macintosh platform, and Illustrator 5.0 for the Macintosh in 1995. These will include Chinese, Korean and Japanese versions.\n\nStill, Adobe does not have a blanket localisation policy covering its entire product range.\n\n'We put a lot of effort into localisation,' Ms Gross said. 'We will look at the needs of the market and then decide [which products to localise] based on that.' Adobe is also considering establishing an office in the region.\n\n'We're looking at different ways to support the market,' Ms Gross said, adding that Adobe is evaluating the choice of opening an office against relying strictly on channels.\n\n'We are evaluating which will give the users the best support,' she said.\n\nEven if Adobe does not open an office here, Ms Gross said the company would continue to focus on the Asia-Pacific region as a large growth market.\n\nFor China, Adobe is working to establish distribution channels on the mainland. Previously the company had worked though Hong Kong to reach China.\n\nIn Hong Kong, Adobe products are distributed by PacRim Technologies while SystemPro handles Aldus products. According to Deepa Swaminathan, marketing communications manager at PacRim, Adobe will decide on a single channel towards the end of this year.\n\nThe launch of the three products highlights the fact that the merger has created a half-billion dollar graphics software giant with a range of packages that covers not only the traditional print publishing industry but also the digital authoring field with applications for video and film production, presentation graphics and information retrieval.\n\nAccording to Ms Gross, while the print publishing industry is 'the bread and butter of the company', Adobe is increasingly focusing on electronic distribution of information.\n\n'We are focusing a certain amount of our energies on creating products that will help people distribute their information."
