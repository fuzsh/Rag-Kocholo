Unable to read the dictionary of the application or extension because it is not scriptable.\"+\n\n+Then it quits and the Tiger version of Script Editor starts up with nothing in the box.+\n\n+Getting info on the file says that it is a Unix executable file. Say what?+\n\nStarting with the last issue (Unix executable) that really just means that the OS doesn't know what program created the file.\n\nIt sounds like OSX and Classic no longer are tracking the creator info on those Persuasion files.\n\nQuestion: If you double-click on the Persuasion program, does it run?\n\nIf so, if you do a Get Info on one of the Persuasion files, is there an option to tell it what program you want to use to open it? Can you set it to Persuasion?\n\nLink"
