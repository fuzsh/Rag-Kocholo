Then I remember that I haven’t touched oils in years. These days I make everything in digital media. There is no more cleaning brushes, no more waiting for paint to dry, and best of all no more picking stray dog hairs out of my work.I started out my art career in traditional media. My wheelhouse was charcoal, pastels, and my beloved oil paint. After going to school for graphic design I found a way to merge my love of creating and the ease of the digital world. There is never a dull moment when working with clients, and with each project being different from the last it is hard to feel burnt out.\n\nThrough my work in graphic design I have been fortunate to have found a large group of talented creatives who have helped me grow as a designer and artist. They set a high bar for design and mentorship, which I found myself wanting to emulate both professionally and personally. This lead me to teaching, something that I never really thought about in my early life, but has been one of the most rewarding experiences. There is nothing that moment when someone grabs a particularly hard concept, and I am blown away at the creativity of students. I have found that people are far more capable than they give themselves credit for. The truth is anyone can create, and I want to be there want to be there when students realize that for themselves.\n\nKristina Robbins: Since she started her journey back in 2000, Kristina enjoys working many roles in the multimedia industry.
