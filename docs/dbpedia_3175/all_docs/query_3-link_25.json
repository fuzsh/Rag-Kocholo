        "text": "Quicktime, one of Apple Computer Inc.'s most exciting recent innovations, holds the promise of making video, animation and sound almost as easy to use in computer programs as text and graphics. A flood of products designed to take advantage of Quicktime will be demonstrated at the Macworld Expo trade show, which begins today in San Francisco.\n\nQuicktime, which is invisible to the average user, is essentially a set of standards and tools for software developers who are expected to use it to make spreadsheets, data bases, graphics programs, word processors and other applications capable of working with sound and video along with text and standard graphics. It was sent to software developers last month as an extension of the Macintosh operating system.\n\nIn a way, Quicktime follows the footsteps of Quickdraw, a set of system rules that allowed the integration of text and graphics on the Macintosh screen -- which made possible desktop publishing.\n\nVideo clips, stereo sound and animated sequences can be stored on a floppy disk (in small snippets) or hard drive just as text and graphics can be stored -- except that video requires much more disk space than plain text or graphics. Quicktime enables the Macintosh user to \"cut and paste\" those new data forms in a document just as one would insert a paragraph of text or a scanned photograph.\n\nAccording to Apple's design, an executive using a Macintosh can paste a short video segment into a box in a Wordperfect or Microsoft Word word-processing document, create animated graphs and charts in an Aldus Persuasion slide show, add a company jingle and a soundtrack to a computer-based training document for new workers, and otherwise introduce \"dynamic\" elements to common business applications.\n\n\"Apple's approach with Quicktime is to give people the opportunity to create multimedia on a human level,\" said Ray Kingman, president of Deltapoint Inc. of Monterey, Calif., which makes a Macintosh program for business graphics called Deltagraph Professional that can use Quicktime technology. (The program has a list price of $295.)\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
