        "text": "On the eve of WWDC 2017, Iâm starting a new series of posts looking back at past WWDCs. My aim is to make original slides/videos publicly available for the sake of preservation, add historical context, and to find interesting tidbits: undelivered promises, unrealized possibilities, presenters who would later rise through the ranks, etc. First up: WWDC 97.\n\nFrom May 13th through 16th, 1997, Apple held its Worldwide Developers Conference in San Jose, CA. Five months after the purchase of NeXT, Apple demoed Rhapsody, a new NeXT-based operating system that would eventually replace the classic Mac OS. Apple would also continue to develop the classic Mac OS, including the release of Mac OS 8 that summer.\n\nI think itâs fascinating to examine this transition point in Appleâs history, in the context of the changes that transpired over the next year:\n\nGil Amelio was fired in July, and Steve Jobs replaced him as CEO in September. In the following months Jobs ended the clone program, killed the Newton and other underperforming products, and introduced the Power Mac/PowerBook G3.\n\nThe Rhapsody strategy would also be overhauled. As shown at WWDC 97, Rhapsody would require Mac applications to be largely rewritten for the Yellow Box (later renamed Cocoa) APIs in order to take full advantage of Rhapsodyâs protected memory, preemptive multitasking, and other modern features. Mac developers (particularly large ones including Adobe and Microsoft) were not excited about this. At WWDC 98, Apple introduced Mac OS X, based on Rhapsody but including a much cleaner migration path (the Carbon APIs) for existing Mac apps. Although Mac OS X shipped almost 2 years late and the transition to it was sluggish, history has proven Mac OS X (and its derivative OSes including iOS) to be a massive success.\n\nWhile doing research for this post, I came across a WWDC 97 trip report written by noted Mac developer John Norstad (of Disinfectant and NewsWatcher fame). Itâs a very interesting read: like nearly all Mac developers at the time, Norstad is bitter and skeptical from seeing Appleâs continual engineering failures in the preceding years. But after seeing the Rhapsody strategy and the engineering management changes led by Steve Jobs, Norstad leaves the conference cautiously optimistic about Appleâs future.\n\nAs Norstad states, for Mac developers who felt ââ¦burned too many times by promises that went unfulfilledâ, WWDC 97 was Appleâs first step at regaining their trust.\n\nnot my CD, thanks to appletechlab.jp\n\nThese presentations come from the â97 WWDC Presentations CD, and were originally saved as .ppf files (Aldus/Adobe Persuasion Presentation Files). Hat tip to Steve Troughton-Smith for pointing out that theyâre just animated GIFs. I used Preview to export them to PDFs, and Adobe Acrobat to optimize by recompressing the images with ZIP (since each slide is a 640x480 image).\n\nMy notes below are in italics.\n\nUpdate: I found a CD set containing session videos, those are posted at WWDC 1997 Videos.\n\nOpening Keynote\n\nSeries 100: Mac OS\n\n100: Mac OS Overview\n\n101: Mac OS-Core OS Changes\n\n102: Mac OS User Experience Enhancements\n\n103: Mac OS User Experience Enhancements II\n\n104: Apple Information Access Toolkit\n\n105: Unicode in Mac OS\n\n106: Color: The Mac OS Advantage\n\n107: Game Sprockets\n\n108: Mac OS Networking Update\n\n109: Advanced Mac OS Networking & Communication\n\n110: MacApp Release 13\n\n111: Building Network Savvy Applications with MacApp Release 13\n\n196: AppleScript Language\n\nSeries 200: Rhapsody\n\n200: Rhapsody Technical Strategy and Overview\n\nâUnified Releaseâ of Rhapsody, targeted for high-end Mac users, was slated for a mid-1998 release!

Steve Jobs would effectively kill the licensing program once he became CEO in September 1997, and the products in this roadmap (Mac OS for CHRP, new CHRP logic boards) never saw public release.\n\nFireside Chat with Steve Jobs (captured from VHS by Jason Molenda)\n\nThis is Steve Jobsâ famous âfireside chatâ, which took place on the Friday of the conference as the first part of the closing keynote. I feel itâs the single best explanation of the principles that Jobs followed in turning around Apple, and itâs always worth a re-watch.
