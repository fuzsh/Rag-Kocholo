        "text": "Are you interested in a class about the fundamentals of two dimensional drawing using a computer?\n\nI am starting to learn Inkscape for using the laser cutters and have found it fairly easy going. My prior experience consists of several years of intense use of Aldus Persuasion along with some PageMaker and find the skills to be applicable. I also have several years of very casual Photoshop use and found the transition to GIMP to be easy.\n\nI will cover the difference between vector and bitmap (or raster) editing, then present basic usage of the Inkscape vector graphics editor and the GIMP image editor.\n\nI also have tried (am trying) Lynda.com through another conduit than DMS.\n\nBut I never friggin’ learn. Coming to a class means I MIGHT pay attention. It’s something I’m struggling to change, but so far, not so good.\n\nSo I guess this means I’m VERY interested…\n\nPlease schedule for any day that is not Tuesday or Thursday after 6PM unless Saturday or Sunday\n\nIs the Lynda.com 2 weeks free an automatic thing or do you need some kind of code? I’m a hands-on learner so somebody showing me how they do what they already know how to do as a presented class is no where near as useful to me as an interactive class where I do it myself along with an instructor. I’ve pretty much crapped out of learning Adobe and I tried to self teach Inkscape & GIMP, too with no luck. Back to tracing my patterns by hand again for now since the laser can’t just read my mind…silly thing! If it’s an interactive class where we follow along on our laptops, maybe I could learn to wrangle that bleeping bezier took!!\n\nThank you for the interest and the encouragement.\n\nIs 7 PM on Wed Nov 4 or Wed Nov 18 better for everybody? If there enough demand, I can repeat in December and maybe once every couple of months thereafter.\n\nMy intent is for a short presentation at the beginning, then a follow-along demo of Inkscape, then GIMP. Definitely bring your computer and please download and install before the class.\n\nFor those who were not at the member meeting on Thursday, Alex said that changes in the terms by Lynda/LinkedIn may make it impossible to pass access around like we have been doing. They will honor the original terms for the duration of our current subscription. If the new terms turn out as bad as they appear, we will probably not renew. So get your Lynda time in by June.\n\nJust a quick reminder that the class is this coming Wednesday at 7 PM.\n\nIf at all possible, bring your computer so that you can follow along during the hands-on demo part of the class. Please download and install Inkscape and GIMP before the class. DMS has a few laptops you can use and they have Inkscape installed, but no GIMP.\n\nInkscape may be found at https://inkscape.org/en/download/\n\nand GIMP at GIMP - Downloads"
