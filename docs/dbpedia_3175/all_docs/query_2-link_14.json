        "text": "Anybody old enough to remember the days before the personal computer is also old enough to remember when Paul Brainerd, founder and chairman of the Aldus Corporation, coined the term \"desktop publishing\" and helped turn every marketing assistant, account manager and college student into a self-styled publisher. Ten years later, desktop publishing is a $2 billion industry.\n\nNow, with Aldus expecting to complete a $500 million stock-swap merger next week with another leader in the field, Adobe Systems Inc., the companies hope together to achieve similar success in the emerging market of \"electronic publishing.\"\n\nArmed with an arsenal of techniques that would enable computer users to create, edit and distribute documents over networks, the combined companies want to make their software the standard method for publishers to make information worthy of the information highway. Adapting to Digital World\n\nThe merger, creating the fourth-largest PC software company, will give Adobe \"the tools required to help our customers move from today's paper-based information infrastructure to tomorrow's digital world,\" said Adobe's chairman, John E. Warnock, who will run the merged companies as Adobe Systems.\n\nMr. Warnock sees an era not too far off when distributing advertisements, sales brochures and other documents over the Internet or other computer networks becomes as routine a task for companies as mass-mailing corporate documents is today. Newspapers and magazines, which are also venturing into the on-line world, might be other candidates for Adobe's products.\n\nAdobe has already ventured into on-line distribution with software called Acrobat, which endeavors to solve the sticky problem of exchanging documents among incompatible computer systems, and Aldus is a leading supplier of the software used to create documents on screen.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
