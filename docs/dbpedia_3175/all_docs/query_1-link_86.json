        "text": "After a long discussion with my lecturer and course friends I decided it was best to go down the route of one of the other concepts instead of the animation storyboard I had created. They connected more with that ideas straight away and even though I spent time on the storyboard I felt this was the right decision to take. I’m learning that it is often the pieces of work you create along the way to the final one which shape your outcome and all of that research and development is not wasted but used to increase the ideas and delivery.\n\nI then decided to illustrate the posters so I could then animate them on after effects. I wanted to make them simple gifs that could be used around public transport locations which would create annoying noises and hopefully irritate people but show them that noise pollution is a problem that we all must change to help.\n\nAbove is the initial poster that I created with natural colours however I did not think that this looked very good. I wanted to keep them simple and cartoon like but just felt that they did not pop enough. I think thought about how the colour scheme could be designed using sound and this brought the idea of music streaming apps. They all have different colours and distinct colours which together makes a nice eye-catching design. This is something you are less likely to see colour wise and hopefully would draw more attention.\n\nOnce I had applied these to the posters, I felt that they worked a lot better. Next was to animate them and include sounds.\n\nAbove is shown how I animated them, simply creating 2 copies of each with distinct differences where something moves and then placed these in repetition like a gif.\n\nNext, I added sounds which are of the man-made sound which ruins their habitat and lives and at the end with the closing text this disappears, and the animal’s sounds play.\n\nThis shows in audio how things can change and once again we can listen to wildlife if we stop creating our own noise.\n\nFinally, they were done, and I placed them into different contexts I felt were appropriate for the piece.\n\nWhere people are present, waiting and can get annoyed by the sounds created by ourselves. I think that this outcome works a lot better than the initial and it hopefully gets people to start thinking about changing how much noise they create and also consume in music and transport. I do think that this isn’t one of my best pieces of work this year and for that I am disappointed but I feel as though I have learned a lot about changing your ideas if they are not right and with more time feel that this outcome would have been better. Next time I am going to do more development and idea creation to ensure I have chosen the best ideas going forward.\n\nThis was the next part of the project ensuring that the game would work and that the process of cutting it out was easy enough for the teachers to do. I was very happy with printing the A3 page as it came out exactly as planned and the size of the cards is really good for the game. I was afraid if they were too big it would look childish for the teenagers and too small would be hard to read and also easily rip and tear.\n\nThis is the game as it printed and then I quickly used the guillotine to cut out the pieces themselves. One change I might make is to take away the black outline because you actually don’t need this and also the red cutting lines could be slightly thinner so that the edges look even neater once they are all cut. Below is a picture of one of my peers putting together the lines with no prior knowledge of the project. It was really interesting to see her reaction and how well she would pick it up.\n\nI was really happy at how quickly Maria got the game and she really liked the use of emojis in the work and understood the concept once I had explained to her the first few slides of the presentation. Next is the presentation of our final work to the client and some of our peers.\n\nAfter the last feedback on the presentation I have tidied up some spelling, kerning and also adding some imagery to the ‘Symptoms Game’ slide. I feel that the presentation is now to ready to present and I am looking forward to presenting this to the client on Thursday. I understand that they may have changes that they would look and will be more than happy to discuss them but for the time being I don’t know what else I can do within this presentation.\n\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript.\n\nSomething which was raised during discussion was by taking away text on the screen the teachers still need to be informed and have something they can use as a guide. Therefore, I decided the best way to do this is to create simple PDF document which simple outlines what to say for each slide and does hold a lot of information. It is up to the teachers how much they want to share information wise and this allows flexibility in the way it will be delivered rather than having to read everything off the screen. Ensuring the teachers are informed as well as the children is actually very important so that the teachers know how to deal with symptoms within the classroom and be more aware of people with different disorders which can affect how they are in class.\n\nI decided to keep it simple and more professional is because this document is targeted at teachers in how to deliver the presentation and not the children. Therefore, it does not need to be colourful and full of imagery as this is not vital. Ensuring all the correct information is on the page and details explaining Ectodermal Dysplasia is the importance.\n\nI think it looks and works well keeping to the colour scheme and style of our group’s outcomes once again, it will be good to get feedback on this piece also to ensure that it is easy to understand and follow when delivering the presentation.\n\nNext, I need to print out the game and ensure that it is the right size and easy to play and then get ready for the client presentation on Thursday.\n\nCreating Emojis I knew was going to be time consuming as it is a tedious task however needed to be done so that I was not taking them off another designer or company. Also, this means that the ED Society can use them for other materials in the future. I am able to create imagery that will work together for this campaign but also be available to apply to other material in the future. Closely using the designs that have already been used by other companies [1] This allows me to have designs which the children will be familiar to and can connect better to. Giving them something they are familiar with already like emojis but applying it to an educational game teaching them something new.\n\nFor the first emoji this is what is on the website however, in my creation of this emoji I will not be including the water droplet because one of the most common and dangerous symptoms is that people with ED do not have sweat glands.\n\nAbove is my flat shape version of the emoji which I created in Adobe Illustrator. I think it is a better reflection of the symptom compared to what is currently out there for mobile phones as they all have water droplets.\n\nI then went on to create all of the others and these were my final outcomes which I decided to display on one page which will be one of the documents I send over to the ED Society when I am finished.\n\nMy next job was to now create the game using the emojis created. I had already from my first draft discussed the + and = idea but with feedback people wanted more information in the game so I felt it was necessary to include limited text which aids all the emojis. Here is the outcome with 5 symptom lines and the new emoji designs. I really like how it looks and decided to include the colour scheme to the outsides of the lines to make it easier to complete the games but also if the teacher wanted to make it harder for the students they could cut down below those lines.\n\nFinally, this needed to display in an easy to understand way and I felt that it needed to be displayed on one sheet of A3 paper which could easily be printed out at the school. Also, create cutting lines so the teachers would find it easier and to know how to play the game by including some text which guides them to what they have to do.\n\nI think that this makes it a lot easier to understand and be confident that the schools can teach the subject to the students. I now need to print this out myself and ensure any final changes are made before presentation day including ensuring the game size is okay.\n\nSources\n\n[1]https://unicode.org/emoji/charts/full-emoji-list.html\n\n2nd draft presentation\n\nUsing the feedback from the group and peers I when back to the first draft of the presentation and changed it considerably so that it is much more appealing for younger people and also more fun to view using imagery and more colour.\n\nOn the second and third slides from the feedback there was way too much text on these and so I stripped it right back to some simple questions and figures. This is direct and allows the teacher to describe these pages with some information rather than just reading off the board. I chose to use teeth and sunglasses as the two pieces of imager as they relate directly to some of the symptoms which this presentation teaches the children to help.\n\nOn the ‘what have we learned?’ slide I inserted a glass of water as this is one of the solutions to overheating is giving someone some cold water to help cool down. The correlation between the question on the slide and imagery works well. I also think that the imagery used minimally does not distract viewers from the information or topic discussion either.\n\nAlso, on the last two slides the same ideas were applied. I think that with this minimal work I also now need to include a PDF document which guides teachers through the presentation. This will allow them to learn about Ectodermal Dysplasia and be able to teach the children about it with confidence. I think I am going to use some of the imagery created for the game too so that it links up together. There are some Emojis which are not exactly how I want for the game and so instead of compromising so that they look like what Apple iPhone’s do I am going to make my own.\n\nNext, I need to work on the emojis of the game and finish the PDF document with information to aid this presentation and the delivery from the teachers to the students.\n\nFor my first draft of the presentation I wanted to nail down the content and the colours to ensure that I had got them right before moving on and use more imagery and the game. I really like the colour scheme that as a group we decided on because it works so well for block colours and especially for backgrounds and the typefaces that we have chosen too. It will only aid my presentation going forward.\n\nLooking at what I have included in the first draft I wanted to keep the information within the presentation and feel that there is room to improve to make it better for younger people. There is a lot of text and I need to work on the balance of imagery and text a lot more. Currently it would be very boring to sit through and if the teacher is unable to deliver it well then, the kids will be very quickly disinterested.\n\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript.\n\nThe feedback that I got off my fellow group members was that they liked the balance of informative and also with the game that I will be making it will balance it. The good part of the presentation is that it is minimal so for different age groups the length of the lesson presentation could be adjusted for the class.\n\nMoving forward I need to add more imagery to each of the slides and also now look to work on the game as I have a rough idea of how to lay them out, but I need to create my own emojis and ensure they all relate to the symptoms correctly. I am happy with where this is at for the moment but understand that there is a lot of room for improvement.\n\nToday we took a trip to Cheltenham again to meet with the Client and show our progress up to this point with our initial ideas. It is vital to keep communicating with your client during the project to ensure you’re on the right page but also so that they can provide you with any feedback on what you are working on. This was also a good time to see where everyone else was at and what ideas as a collective we had come up with.\n\nI pitched the idea of short animations which could be used on social media and also in schools or public spaces to educate and inform people of the symptoms and how to deal with them. I also pitched my other two ideas because I felt even though I didn’t like them as much that it would be good to get Diana’s feedback.\n\nShe loved the idea of using emojis because she felt it would not just connect with teenagers but others as well and that this is something that can be used worldwide. She was also impressed about concept two which uses a question on a PowerPoint slide which could be used in registration time at school for a short informative exercise. While in this meeting I came to the idea of combining the two so that the informative short lesson could use emojis which in turn would simplify and engage teenagers and it would be able to be spread across schools all over the UK.\n\nThe other ideas of the group were social media campaigns, animations and lots of digital content but I felt like I needed to do something for the school. This means all four of our pieces would be effective in different areas and would still tie together well. Also that by creating a teaching lesson for registration it would be informing the teachers of how to deal with ED in class at the same time but generalising and normalising the symptoms so that all children feel they can change their actions and help themselves and others.\n\nFrom this meeting the client was very happy with our choice of colours and imagery collectively and we all came out of it pretty happy with where we are at. I am now going to develop the three concepts for my tutorial with my lecturer tomorrow but also start to think more about what the lesson concept would actually include and how maybe best this would be able to inform children.\n\nPoster campaign in schools\n\nEmoji animation to explain symptoms\n\nEveryone is and looks different and that is okay\n\nI Am __ posters idea where kids can fill it in\n\nAsking teenagers questions\n\nInstagram posts of Ectodermal Dysplasia symptoms\n\nTypographic motion graphic\n\nPersuade teenagers to cool down, sun lotion up etc.\n\nPersuade teens to help others.\n\nAsking teens what they would do if they were warm? Sunny outside? Thinking about themselves and then others\n\nTeaching material\n\nLooking at the list above there is a range of potential outcomes and ways in which I can reach the target audience. I think that using language like emojis which are so ingrained in teenagers these days will allow me to connect with them more than imagery of people with ED and scaring people with some of the images to see when typing it on google. Portraying them as normal people and not outsiders is key.\n\nLooking thinking a lot about the ideas above I decided on four concepts to take further to a sketching stage to just get my ideas down on paper and hopefully try and decide whether they were actually worth pushing forward.\n\nAfter getting my initial ideas down on paper and these concepts drawn up, I think that I prefer concept 1 the best which is a series of short animations describing Ectodermal Dysplasia (ED) symptoms and how to deal with them. It’s simple, to the point and hopefully engaging with the use of digital media which teenagers these days love. I then decided to develop this concept further to see what it looks like and to show Diana when we would go see her for another meeting.\n\nAs a group we decided the typefaces and colours below. We chose them because they work really well with the current website and brand identity of the EDS already. It was really important to stick to that because then they can use our outcomes much more easily and do not have to change any of their colours to fit our outcomes.\n\nBringing colour and text to it works and from this I can see that the collective colour scheme and Fonts work really well. I am happy with this at the moment and looking forward to seeing what Diana says and the feedback that she gives when we all go see her on Monday.\n\nFirstly, I decided to create a mind map of various parts of the idea generation process looking largely at some possible ways I can connect with teenagers and what the best ways are to target people of that age range.\n\nMost of the information from the mind map is from the sources at the bottom of the blog using a wide range of articles online which discuss what teenagers are into, how they interact and what they connect with the most. In order to ensure that I connect with them best I need to research and find out what they like and find where best to situate the outcome. From the research I confirmed my initial idea that social media and mobile phones are a huge platform which teenagers are always on and interacting with. One statistic shows that 85% of teenagers with a smartphone in America are on Instagram and also the article talked about the decline of Facebook. From the chat with Diana she expressed how she had tried to connect with teenagers on Facebook but did not have much success. I think this is largely due to how Instagram is more popular but also that on Facebook people can see what you like and interact with more which means teenagers are less inclined to reach out and connect with groups like the EDS afraid that friends may see.\n\nInitially I was also looking at the ideas of bullying however when looking back at the brief which Diana sent back and had amended, she wanted us to look less at anti bullying content and more at informing and persuading people to look at how to deal with and help people overcome the symptoms.\n\nWhen researching into languages used to communicate to teenagers or how teenagers communicate emojis were often mentioned as these are common place in conversations now. Using emojis can be a way in which teenagers and everyone in general can describe a feeling or emotion by including an emoji and this can change the tone of a message massively. They hold so much power and often charities and companies have been known to create and take emojis into their branding or promotion of the company’s products.\n\nAbove is one example of a campaign for anti-bullying where an eye emoji was created and used for the promotion of the campaign.\n\nAnother point I picked up on is that the attention spans of teenagers is very small, therefore you cannot create outcomes with too much information, or they can become very bored and disengaged. I need to ensure that my message is short and memorable which is hard to do but if I am able to use imagery like emojis to also help communicate the message then I have a better chance of teenagers remembering it.\n\nSelecting a few of the ideas from the mind map and starting to generate outcomes to hold this information I will start to make some concepts up for the project. Also, to discuss these with the other three members of the group to gain feedback as they are working so closely on similar topic areas.\n\nSources\n\nhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/steveolenski/2015/05/26/5-things-your-brand-needs-to-know-about-marketing-to-teens/#5d4181f96248\n\nhttps://www.huffpost.com/entry/9-tips-for-marketing-to-k_b_4682018\n\nhttps://www.positivediscipline.com/articles/how-do-you-motivate-teen-yes-it-possible\n\nhttps://www.wired.com/story/children-emoji-language-learning/\n\nhttps://www.businessinsider.com/how-teens-use-emojis-to-talk-2013-10?r=US&IR=T\n\nhttps://www.adweek.com/brand-marketing/first-emoji-ever-made-social-cause-launches-today-its-eye-bullying-167699/\n\nNext, I need to carry out some research into what attracts teenagers in 2019. With the rise of social media so much of what they consume is online and no longer through books or other forms of material which was used 20 years ago. The Ectodermal Dysplasia Society have not got as much of a presence on social media as you may want in order to be seen by the audience of younger and older teenagers.\n\nOn Small Biz Trends the number one suggestion to market to teens is to connect with them on social media. Sadly, we live so much of our lives online and this is where we can be influenced but also influence others. I can look to add to this traffic but be positive about people instead of scrutinising like the media does. However, I could also think about making an outcome which is not online that will take teenagers off their phones even for 5 minutes. Weighing up which will be most effective and looking at the reach of both with regards to pushing the understanding and awareness of Ectodermal Dysplasia. Taking teenagers opinions into consideration when creating or developing something is also a good way of getting them engaged because they feel they have a say in something and also making them feel unique and special celebrating differences allows people to feel a sense of inclusion. I feel this could be a really good way in connecting with them.\n\nThe centre for parent and teen communication wrote an article on learning to listen and not reacting. This is really important as teenagers start to have opinions at this age and it is really important to keep them engaged in conversations and allow their voice to be heard. By creating something that allows them to have a voice and give their opinion or at least asking them questions opens up a new wave of communication, rather than just relaying information to them. I need to also remember to use suitable speech when designing for a specific age group. If you use simplified words, they may find it annoying and childish but using hard, complicated words will disinterest them. By using the correct vocabulary will be more approachable for them.\n\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript.\n\nSpotify are one company that has done a great job attracting the younger market through their advertising. They have used a colour scheme which seems childlike and simple shapes mixed with photographs of artists which is simple and tasteful. This can look cool and attractive to younger children but also to adults as the product ‘music’ is for all ages and so are the artists.\n\nUsing insight with younger markets works well for example, VOXI, a branch of Vodafone that caters for younger people with phone contracts, uses opinions and messages to inform their content. This allows their target audience to see work that in a sense has been generated by people their age. For ED this could be using a question or quote which pushes their feelings or maybe positive messages, but these can be built upon with interaction from the audience and not just a single voice from the society itself. This obviously in the future relies on the audience to interact and if not can fail badly.\n\nBullying is a huge problem for teenagers as this the age they start to notice their bodily changes as they grow up with hormones, acne can occur, and they begin to notice their own imperfections very quickly. This can lead to anxious times as teenagers want to be seen cool by peers. Also, teenagers start noticing others and this can lead to bullying especially in school. For teens with ED this can be an issue when moving to high school you can get picked on for how you look especially if you have sparse hair or missing teeth for example. Pushing a message of anti-bullying and awareness that everyone is equal and amazing to people who don’t have ED but also support for those who do and to also let them know that they are just as normal and amazing as their peers. Pushing a positive message to all including rather than pointing out faults in each other is what I feel would best help teenagers learn even a little about how to treat peers with ED in the classroom. The fact is we will never be able to get rid of bullying completely, but we can certainly limit it and attempt to push for a more inclusive and welcoming classroom environment by lifting all teenagers up.\n\nOne way you best to communicate is through stories of people like you. Grant Keene who grew up with ED shows others that just because you have Ed does not meant that you can’t fulfil your dreams do what you want. Even though Keene is unable to sweat he just packs extra water while mountain biking and exercising. Everyone in life sometimes have to pack extra help with them whether that’s glasses to see clearly or packing extra water to help yourself cool down. It’s not the differences that define you but how you move past them and live life to the fullest.\n\nPersuading teenagers with ED that there is support available to help and for them to take the help is hard when they don’t want to be seen as different and may refuse. But this can help them live with a smile on their face and know they are different but reminding them that everyone has differences, and everyone has struggles, they can just come in different forms, shapes and sizes.\n\nInitial ideas for educating teenagers of their differences:\n\nTop Trump cards to be used in class or home\n\nPosters/digital artwork asking questions to teenagers\n\nPositive messages of differences and that everyone’s unique\n\nAnti-bullying in school\n\nAnimation explaining ED to teenagers\n\nAnimation explaining that everyone deals with things, different sizes, shapes, forms\n\nI feel that looking into social media and pushing a positive message on that could be a good way in connecting or at least starting to connect with the younger generation of teenagers like Instagram. Pushing positive messages to people with ED rather than informing them of their differences. Educating and persuading teenagers within classrooms through digital media like animations and top trumps that it’s okay to be different and that everyone has struggles and differences. To look at yourself before bullying someone else, building each other up.\n\nSources\n\nhttps://smallbiztrends.com/2015/04/marketing-to-teens.html\n\nhttps://parentandteen.com/keep-teens-talking-learn-to-listen/\n\nhttps://www.voxburner.com/blog-source/02/06/18/awesome-youth-ad-campaigns\n\nhttps://kidshealth.org/en/parents/no-bullying.html\n\nhttp://www.dailycamera.com/lifestyles/ci_31681938/grant-keene-boulder-ectodermal-dysplasia"
