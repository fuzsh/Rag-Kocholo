        "text": "Weber State University became an Adobe Creative Campus in February of 2021. We are now part of a select group of colleges and universities that are driving the future of digital literacy within the global higher education community. This distinction recognizes top institutions that are dedicated to transforming education through creative digital empowerment. By increasing access to digital literacy, this partnership with Adobe allows Weber State to set a higher standard in academia and lead the future of education.\n\nAs an Adobe Creative Campus, WSU faculty, staff, and students have full access to Adobe Creative Cloud, a set of applications and services that gives users access to a collection of software for graphic design, video editing, web development, photography, and much more."
