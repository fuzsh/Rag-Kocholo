        "text": "Remember, we're all in this ... alone.\" - Lily Tomlin\n\nThank heaven, we don't have to be in this all alone. We have the option of going it together. One of the goals of the SOMEDAY is Not a Day in the Week book is to catalyze conversation about what really matters.\n\nToo often, we get busy and weeks (months? years?) go by without us talking about long-term goals or dreams that get pushed aside. It's easy for our values and priorities to get buried in the day-to-day and for resentments to start building up.\n\nThat's why I ended every chapter in my new book with 3-4 questions you can discuss with friends or a family member so you can go deep into the insights and talk about how they pertain to your personal and professional life.\n\nDid you relate to the story that opened each chapter? When has that happened to you? What did it bring up for you? Whether it's \"driving into hurricanes\" or \"watering dead plants,\" how did the real-life examples from myself and others prompt a fresh perspective?\n\nWhat about the insights, exercises and quizes? Were they relevant for you? How so? What changes will you make - what action will you take - on something that's important to you?\n\nThe ten hacks and action steps are designed to elicit epiphanies around your health and happiness. Are you leading a meaningful, purposeful life? If so, how will you continue to do what puts the light on in your eyes? If not, what will you start, stop or do differently?\n\nYou might want to work through the book chapter by chapter with a friend, walking group, or book club. Assign a chapter a week (feel free to adapt that to suit your timeline) and lead a discussion where everyone has opportunities to share personal and professional AHA's. You might want to rotate who facilitate's the discuussion so everyone gets a chance.\n\nMany people have told me these questions have led to some of the most honest conversations they've every had. One couple said filling out the Happiness Box together put the affection and romance back in their marriage. She said, \"Little resentments had started piling up because we weren't talking honestly about the sacrifices we were making. We posted our Happiness Boxes on the frig so we can see them, update them every week, and figure out how to \"swap time off\" so we can each do one thing we enjoy.\"\n\nAnd if you live or work by yourself and don't have anyone to discuss these questions with, reach out. Maybe there's a college friend you haven't talked to in awhile, a neighbor you used to live next to that you miss, a colleague at a previous job you really enjoyed.\n\nStudies show we're \"lonier\" than ever. A February 9, 2019 New York Times article IsLoneliness a Health Epidemic? said it's a \"sad reality of modern life.\"\n\nBut you can change that. Who is someone you know who would welcome a weekly opportunity to work through these structured questions together? It's an opportunity to talk honestly about what's working in your life, what's not, and what you plan to do about it with people who care, with people who have your back and front.\n\nResearch done by Harvard shows that \"Relationships are THE key to enduring happiness.\" A primary point of the book is that meaningful conversation and connection about what matters is what will matter in the long run. WAITING for someone else to make the first move is a prescription for procrastination.\n\nThe goal of the SOMEDAY book is to be proactive, not passive, to take responsibility for our own happiness. One way to do that is to create a community you'd like to be part of. Discussing these questions can create a closeness that counteracts the isolation our culture.\n\nOne more suggestion? If you've read the book, you know it has more than 200 thought-provoking quotes on how we can create the quality of life we want now, not later.\n\nIn addition to answering the questions in this Readers;' Guide, you might also want to select a favorite quote from each chapter and share that with your group. Whether it's Esther Hicks' \"My happiness is on me, so you're off the hook,\" or John Legend's \"The future is already here and we're already late,\" theese inspiring quotes also have the power to provide insight.\n\nAnd you might want to get the SOMEDAY is Not a Day in the Week Journal(which features a quote a day) so you can hold yourself accountable for reflecting on - and acting on - your intentions so you can turn them into a rewarding reality.\n\nReaders’ Guide for Sam Horn's SOMEDAY is Not a Day in the Week\n\nLIFE HACK 1: EVALUATE Your Happiness History\n\nChapter 1.

When is a time you didn’t wait to do what was important to you? What gave you the clarity and confidence to act instead of procrastinate? How did it make you feel?\n\n4. Who do you know who you think of as “happy?” Who is a shining example of someone who DOES what they want now, not someday? What can you learn from their example?\n\nLIFE HACK 2: GENERATE a Today Not Someday Dream\n\nChapter 4: Clarify What You Want\n\n1. Were you fortunate enough to have a calling, mission or passion project downloaded to you? What was it? Did you act on it? Why or why not? How has that affected your life?\n\n2.

How do you feel when you walk into your home? Where would your home rate on the Clutter (1) to Clean (10) Scale? How does that affect you? Do you feel guilty, stressed or frustrated with how things have piled up? Or do you feel proud, at peace with how well-designed, organized and beautiful things are?\n\n2. How much time do you spend cleaning, repairing, buying, renovating your stuff? Is that a source of enjoyment, a burden and chore, or something in between? Explain.\n\n3. Are you ready to down-size your home and/or release some belongings? How will you do that? Who else is impacted by this? How will you negotiate this with them? What could you do with the resources that would be freed up when you have less to take care of?\n\nChapter 8. Stop Driving into Hurricanes\n\n1. Can you relate to the “Why am I driving into a hurricane” story? What commitments are you keeping because you said you would? What are the consequences of that?\n\n2.

Do you think this is a lot of hooey? Does your intellect over-ride your instincts? Or, do you agree that if we have a sixth sense that alerts us to what’s wrong, we also have a sixth sense that alert us to what’s right? What are your beliefs about this?\n\n3. How will you honor the instincts that have your best interests at heart?

Quit Watering Dead Plants\n\n1. Is the majority of your life out of your control and not to your liking? How so? Does this challenging time have a timeline?

Would you describe your life, career or long-term relationships as an aircraft carrier? How so? Is it a successful carrier? Are people counting on you to stay on the carrier?\n\n2.

What is a local place that could be your Utah, the Third Place where you could go to work on a priority project? When will you go there? What will you work on there?\n\nLIFE HACK 10: RELOCATE to Greener Pastures\n\nChapter 26. Give Yourself a GFS - Geographic Fresh Start\n\n1. Would you say you’re a roots person or a wings person? What does that mean to you?\n\n2. Are you happy where you are in your current home? In your neighborhood, city and state? If so, what do you like about it? If not, what don’t you like about it?\n\n3. If you could move, where would you go? What would it take for you to move? Imagine it in full detail. Write out the steps to move this from being a vague idea to a vivid reality.\n\nChapter 27. Come Full Circle\n\n1. When was the last time you were in your hometown? What memories did it bring back? Did you reconnect with people that influenced you? Did it catalyze a new creative direction that could be a satisfying full-circle way to come home to who you truly are?\n\n2. What used to light you up, but it feels like it might be a retreat or regression to “go back there?” Do you worry it’s thinking small instead of thinking big? Could it actually be you’re going “home” to who you are at your core, your best self?\n\n3. Do you agree with Ram Dass that we can be “at home” wherever we are and that “home” is a mindset, not a location? Where do you feel most at home?\n\nChapter 27. Welcome What’s NEXT\n\n1. Are you ready for a fresh start, for a new adventure? What NEXT could put the light on in your eyes?\n\n2. Do you agree with philosophers that living in the now is the miracle – or do you believe happiness can be a balance of the past, present and future?\n\n3. How will you keep your antenna up for a NEXT that’s in alignment with your values and priorities? What will you say to yourself when that opportunity arises so you act on it?\n\nHope you're found these questions inspiring, insightful and useful. Even more importantly, I hope they've motivated you to get crystal clear on your values and priorities, and that you've taken steps to create a life that is in alignment with them now, not someday.\n\n- - -\n\nSam Horn, CEO of The INTRIGUE AGENCY and TEDx speaker, is the author of POP! , Tongue Fu! and Washington Post bestseller Got Your Attention? which have been endorsed by Tony Robbins, Seth Godin, Dan Pink, Marshall Goldsmith, quoted in New York Times, Forbes and Fast Company and presented to National Geographic, NASA, Intel, Cisco, Capital One, YPO. This Readers Guide is from her latest book SOMEDAY is Not a Day in the Week, endorsed by Geneen Roth, Dorie Clark, Kamal Ravikant and Sheri Salata (fomer Executive Producer of The Oprah Winfrey Show) who says Sam is \"one of the brighest lights and most accessible wisdom-sharers in our culture today.\"\n\n\"You're not alone. I will stand by you, I will help you through when you’ve done all you can do.” – Rascal Flatts\n\nDo you wish you could talk about things that matter with people who:\n\nare going through the same things you are and can relate?\n\nlisten without interrupting and who genuinely care?\n\noffer support and encouragement and stand by you?\n\nIf so, like the Rascal Flatts lyrics say, you’re not alone.\n\nA study by healthcare provider Cigna found that “most Americans suffer from strong feelings of loneliness. Nearly half say they feel ‘left out,’ and 13% say that zero people know them well.” Zero!\n\nThat’s why I’m sharing guidelines on how to facilitate a salon, book club or accountability group – in the hopes you’ll take the initiative and choose to organize and host one in your area.\n\nBusiness advisors told me I should charge for this process.\n\nI understand why they're suggesting that. I did that with Tongue Fu!® We certified people around the world and taught them how to offer workshops on our trade-marked process and get paid for it - so I’m well aware that’s a viable option.\n\nAfter thinking about it, I’ve decided to make these step-by-step instructions available to EVERYONE for free. Here’s why.\n\nI am a woman on a mission to counteract the loneliness and isolation that are epidemic in our country.\n\nWe all want, need and deserve opportunities to have honest, meaningful conversations with people about what really matters in life. We all crave opportunities to gather with like-minded souls and be part of a community where everyone has opportunities to connect and contribute.\n\nAnd someone's got to take the lead. Someone's got to go first. Someone's got to say, \"I know how much I would like this, so instead of waiting for someone else to take the inititiative, I will ... now not someday.\"\n\nMy hope is that these guidelines help you gather people together - whether it's 3 or 30 - and facilitate a “rising tide” experience that elevates all involved.\n\nAll I ask is that you credit the SOMEDAY book and help spread the word about its message. That might include taking a picture of your group (with people’s permission) and posting it on social media. Sharing a review of the book or TEDx talk. Arranging for me to speak to your organization or at your industry conference. Anything you do is appreciated.\n\nPlease note: people asked me to please provide step-by-step instructions so this document is, shall we say, comprehensive.\n\nPlease understand, you don’t have to do all of this or any of this.\n\nThe goal is simply to create a supportive, interactive gathering where eveyone has opportunities to talk honestly about what’s going on in their world that’s working - what’s not - and what they're going to do about it.\n\nPlease feel free to adapt these guidelines so they congruent with your voice, vision and values, so they're in alignment with your group's goals.\n\nSam Horn’s Guidelines for Hosting a Book Club, Salon or Accountability Group\n\nFill out a W5 Form to clarife your W’s. This will serve as your North Star and help you plan an event that's rewarding for all involved.\n\nWhat? Do you want this to be a:\n\n30-45 minute virtual conversation on Zoom, Skype, Go to Meeting?\n\n45-60 minute brown bag lunch discussion?\n\n90 minute book club on a weeknight?\n\n2-3 hour relaxed brunch or afternoon “salon” on a weekend?\n\nWhere and When? Do you want this held:\n\nIn an open board room at work or a conference room at your office?\n\nIn your home or on a friend’s patio or living room?\n\nIn the meeting room of your condo or neighborhood association?\n\nIn a private room at a restaurant, community center or library?\n\nOn what month and day? What is the start and ending time?\n\nDo you have the exact address on the invitation with driving directions, public transit directions and parking suggestions?\n\nWho? Who do you want to invite? Who would you like to attend?\n\nPersonal friends, neighbors and family members?\n\nPeople from work or your industry who have a similar type of job?\n\nBoomers? Millennials? Retirees? People of all ages?\n\nWomen only? Men only? Couples? Jobseekers? Diverse mix?\n\nHalf people you already know – half people who are new to you?\n\nAn ideal group is between 3-30 people. Smaller groups allow for intimate conversations. :arger group allows for more meet & greet.\n\nWhy will it be a win for attendees? What will motivate them to show up? Will they have an opportunity to:\n\nBypass chit-chat and discuss topics that really matter?\n\nconnect with long-time friends they don’t get to see very often?\n\nsocialize, make new friends and grow their community?\n\nGain insight into what could make them happier now, not someday?\n\nHear stories and insights about life and share some of their own?\n\nWhy will it be a win for you? Why will it be worth you initiating, organizing and hosting this?\n\nDoes it give you satisfaction to bring people together who might be feeling disconnected, isolated or way too busy?\n\nDo you know SOMEONE has to take the first step – or it won’t happen – so you're that someone who is going to make it happen?\n\nDo you want to put together an interactive event where everyone has a voice and gets to contribute and connect – instead of a standard “sage on the stage” format?\n\nAre you tired of small talk and want to give people a chance to go deep and tell the truth about what’s really going on in their life?\n\nAre you ready to be a servant leader who is appreciated because you’re a convener who creates a “rising tide” communitys?\n\n2. Create a one-page invitation to the event.\n\na. Why one page? Because the shorter and clearer this is, the more likely it is people will conclude it’s well-organized and want to participate.\n\nThis can be an email you send out – or a paper announcement you pass out. You might want to feature a photo and description of the book (this is available on Amazon so people know the purpose of the gathering).\n\nb. Make this warm and welcoming so people know why you’re excited about this event and believe it will be time well spent for everyone in the room.\n\nc. You're welcome to use the W5 Form as your format. It quickly communicates the W’s (What, When, Where, Who, and Why) so people are clear about “the flow of the show” and feel they’ll be in “good hands.”\n\nd. You might want to use EVENT BRITE so you have a system and site to promote the event, collect registrations and track RSVP’s. https://www.eventbrite.com/organizer/overview/\n\ne. Feature your contact info so people can get in touch to ask questions.\n\nf. Indicate if there any costs, how and when to make payment, and to whom. Cash? Check? Credit card? In advance? By a cut-off date? Pay at the door?\n\ng. What should they bring? Their copy of the book? A notebook? Food or drinks? People often want to contribute so give them something to bring.\n\n3. Determine Costs and Expenses:\n\nWill you be providing refreshments? If so, plan a sufficient variety to suit people’s different dietary needs and requests.\n\nDo you have enough plates, glasses, forks, napkins, serving trays?\n\nDo you want to make this potluck? If so, how will you ensure people bring a range of items – main dish, veggies, salads, beverages, drinks - instead of 10 desserts or ten bags of chips?\n\nIf you’re catering this, what are the projected costs per person? Charge an appropriate fee so you are not “out of pocket.”\n\nIf this is at a restaurant, indicate whether people will pay for their own meal, how so, or if that is included in the cost of the ticket.\n\nIs there a room rental, bartending, cleaning fee or other expenses that will be incurred that need to be included/covered in the ticket fee?\n\nWill books be provided? If so, who is paying for them? Or do attendees need to purchase books in advance and bring them?\n\nWill books be for sale at the event? If so, Amazon often sells books for $10 off and no shipping. If you want, you can buy the books at a discount from them or other major retailers like Barnes & Noble, 800 CEO READ or your favorite independent bookstore, and sell them for a small profit to offset and help cover expenses.)\n\nDo you have a sponsor – an organization or a generous donor – who is covering the costs of the event? If so, how will you publicly acknowledge and thank them?\n\n4. Provide an agenda and suggest how people can prepare in advance to make the most of the event. You might want to:\n\n\"Sandwich\" the discussion in between a \"free to mingle\" opening and close. For example, a two hour event might start with 30 minutes for refreshemnts, a 1 hour discussion, and wrap up with 30 minute of refreshments and \"open networking.\" This gives people the freedom to meet who they want and continue conversations in greater depth.\n\nAsk people to read two specific chapters beforehand and be ready to discuss a specific story or insight that resonated with them.\n\nRecommend people watch Sam’s TEDx talk and be ready to share their reactions to the “We’re here to go in” story from Walden Pond. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5NDSUjYgFY\n\nProvide a link to the Happiness Box so they can fill it out in advance. https://www.intrigueagency.com/serendestinycom/2019/4/1/the-happiness-quiz-from-sam-horns-someday-is-not-a-day-in-the-week\n\nProvide a link to the Happiness Interview and ask people to select a specific questions they found particularly intriguing/relevant. https://www.intrigueagency.com/serendestinycom/2019/4/2/the-happiness-interview-from-sam-horns-someday-is-not-a-day-in-the-week\n\n5. Tips for Facilitating a Fun, Focused Conversation\n\nLet people know in advance they can TRUST you to honor your time commitments.\n\nIf you say you’ll start at 6:30, start at 6:30 even if some people are late. If you don’t, the agenda goes down the drain and people feel short-changed and frustrated. Honor people who are on time, not the ones who aren't. This sets a precedent for future meetings because your reputation is you ALWAYS start and end on time.\n\nIf you said you’ll stop at 8 pm, stop at 8 - even if people are in the midst of fascinating conversations. Graciously tell people they are welcome to stay longer if they choose to - however the event is officially over for those who need/want to leave.\n\nAsk people to keep their comments to 3 minutes or less so EVERYONE has a chance to talk and enforce that rule. If you let ONE person ramble or dominate the discussion, the event will quickly go off the rails. If necessary, interrupt and say, “Thanks Bob for bringing that up. Who else has a story they’d like to share?” or “I’m so glad you pointed that out, Bev. Who has a different perspective or a similar experience?”\n\nAppoint a timekeeper to give people a heads-up 15 seconds before their time is up. Speak up if they go over and direct the conversation to someone else. The group will appreciate you being fair and holding everyone accountable for honoring time limits.\n\nThink of yourself as a conductor and the group as an orchestra. The goal is for EVERYONE to participate. Look around the room. Who hasn’t spoken up yet? Let quiet people know you want to hear what they have to say. You might ask, “Sue, what did you have in Square 1 of your Happiness Box?” Everyone looks to you as the leader to make everyone feel included, not just the extroverts or vocal few.\n\nEstablish ground-rules up front so people are treated with respect and feel emotionally safe.\n\nFor example, you might want to agree everything that is discussed in the group is PRIVATE. No sharing what’s said with others outside the room unless you ask for and are given permission.\n\nNo arguing. People have the right to share their experience without being told they’re WRONG.\n\nNo coaching. This is not about giving ADVICE or trying to FIX people. This is an opportunity to share what’s really going on in our life and get support.\n\nWhat other ground-rules would ensure people can talk openly?\n\nPost these ground-rules on a wall or poster board, or pass them out to everyone at the outset.. There are rules of the road that ensure everyone can drive safely. These rules ensure people can converse safely. Reference them at the beginning of the event so everyone agrees to honors them.\n\nAs a convener and conductor, it's also your role to keep the pace of the event moving forward. Have a variety of questions planned out in advance. If, for some reason, a question doesn’t elicit enthusiasm or the discussion and energy “sag,” switch to to a different subject to maintain momentum and keep interest high.\n\nHow to come up with intriguing questions? Review the SOMEDAY Readers’ Guide at the link below. Select 5-10 questions you think are relevant and timely that could catalyze an interesting conversation.\n\nhttps://www.intrigueagency.com/serendestinycom/2019/4/1/readers-guide-for-sam-horns-someday-is-not-a-day-in-the-week\n\nIf you have people fill out the Happiness Box, follow-up questions might be: What did you put in Squares 1 and 4? What did you put in Squares 2 and 3? What surprised you? What didn't? Any epiphanies? What is ONE thing you could change in Square 3 that could open up time, energy and resources for something in Square 2?\n\nOr ask, “What’s your favorite adventure from Sam's Year by the Water? Why did you relate to it? What did it inspire you to do?”\n\nBe sure your last question is action-oriented. “So, what is ONE dream you will set in motion – or ONE priority or passion project you will spend more time on – starting today, not SOMEDAY?\n\n6. Bonus Tips for Hosting Events That are a Success For All Involved\n\na. Have a sign-in sheet and name tags at the door to facilitate people getting to know each other. Ask a friend to stand at the door, greet people and make introductions, so people feel welcome as soon as they arrive.\n\nb. You might want to start by asking everyone to give a 1 minute intro (and when you say 1 minute, you mean 1 minute.) Announce you’re “putting your schedule where your values are.” The goal is to set up meaningful connections and sharing personal introductions will help do that.\n\nc, If you don’t want people to give “boring” introductions where they simply explain “what they do,” suggest they share something surprising about themselves or something they’re looking forward to. You might want to go first, or ask someone to kick things off who will model an intriguing into.\n\nd. People are usually so appreciative of the connections they've made, they want to stay in touch and \"continue the converesation.\" If so, invite people to exchange business cards, or you can circulate a “Contact” sheet where people share their email or phone number and send that list to everyone with your follow-up thank you note.\n\nIt’s very important to make this voluntary. Clarify it is NOT okay for anyone to automatically add attendees to their mailing list and/or to market their business or sell their services without permission and unless someone specifically requests it.\n\ne. Provide paper, pens and flat surfaces to write on. You might want to print a “hand-out” with favorite quotes from the book on one side - and white space to take notes and do the exercises on the other side. This gives people a \"tangible takeaway\" they can post on their refrigerator to keep their insights in-sight, in-mind and their intentions top-of-mind.\n\nf. Many groups have told me this was one of the most enjoyable events they've ever been part of and they don't want it to end. If that’s the case with you and your group, SET UP A NEXT MEETING in the last ten minutes of your event. Agree to a follow-up date IN THE ROOM so everyone can put it on their calendar. Set up a pipeline instead of this being a \"one-off.\"\n\ng. Provide a stamped envelope so attendees can write a personal note to themselves of what they will start, stop or do differently. Mail these to attendees 4-6 weeks later. It’s a thoughtful “gift” people appreciate.It often re-ignites their commitment to act on their intentions and hold themselves accountable for turning a someday into a today.\n\nh. You might want to play upbeat music when people are entering the room, leaving and during refreshment breaks. Whether it’s Brandenberg Concertos, Herbie Hancock or Dianna Krall, music can establish an instant good mood. Be sure not to play it too loud. The goal is to energize the room, not make it difficult for people to hear each other talk.\n\ni. Stock plenty of toilet paper and guest towels in the bathroom(s). If this is a public place, give instructions how to find the bathroom at the outset.\n\nj. If people ask, “How can I help?” give them a job😊 Studies show that people who are shy are much more comfortable if they’re given something to do – whether that’s taking coats, offering drinks, cleaning up after the party, distributing hand-outs, or signing people in at the door.\n\nk. You might want to provide a feedback form. Let people know you will read every comment and use it to make the next event you host (you ARE hosting more events, right??) even more valuable. What did people like about the event? What could make it even better? What did they find most relevant or inspiring? Any other comments or suggestions?\n\nAnd did I mention having FUN? If you have fun, they’ll have fun.\n\nRobert Frost said, “No joy in the writer, no joy in the reader.”\n\nWell, no joy in the host, no joy in the group.\n\nWhat matters is that you’re bringing people together in an isolated world, You are creating community. Center yourself before the event in how glad you are to be doing this and how grateful you are the group is there.\n\nIn the long run, intent transcends logistics. ENJOY!\n\nKatherine Graham said, “To do what you love and feel that it matters, how could anything be more fun?”\n\nThe only thing that could be more fun is to do something you love, feel that it matters, and do it with people you enjoy and respect.\n\nThat is what you get to do when you organize and host a \"rising tide raising all involved\" salon, book club or accountability group.\n\nPlease let me know how it goes.\n\nIt makes my day when people take the time to get back in touch and let me know what a rewarding experience this was for them - and why.\n\nDid you meet people you otherwise would never have met?\n\nCreate an event where people felt connected instead of alone?\n\nAre you reveling in the meaningful discussions about shared challenges and successes that everyone in the room appreciated?\n\nHave people already gotten back in touch to thank you for giving them the encouragement and accountability to take action on their dreams?\n\nI look forward to hearing from you.\n\nUntil then, best wishes and onward.\n\n- - -\n\nSam Horn, CEO of the Intrigue Agency and 3 time TEDX speaker, is on a mission to help people create the life, work and relationships of their dreams.

I have Utah.\" - Robert Redford One of the most important epiphanies from my Year by the Water was that we don't have to be anti-social to be pro-solitude.\n\nWhat do I mean by that?\n\nWell, last April I was driving out in the middle of nowhere listening to the Audible version of Gloria Steinem’s memoir, My Life on the Road.\n\nI had always pictured Texas as hot, flat and barren. But this was spring. Much to my surprise, everything was green, rolling, vibrant. I didn't know what was over the next knoll, all I knew was it was going to be something interesting I'd never seen before.\n\nI was driving at golden hour - that blessed hour right before the sun goes down and the air shimmers with special light. I came over a rise and there, stretched out to the horizon, were golden fields. I gasped out loud at the sheer beauty of it, pulled over, shut off the car engine and stepped outside to bask in its splendor. The only sound was a slight breeze through the leaves of a nearby tree.\n\nI will always remember that exquisite experience. I can still see it in my mind's eye months later.\n\nI got back in the car and resumed driving while listening to Gloria share stories and insights from her life. She quoted Virginia Woolf who believed, \"Every woman needs a room of her own.\"\n\nI laughed out loud as I realized, \"I have a ROAD of my own.\"\n\nI truly revel in my independence. To me, an open road means freedom, autonomy, the opportunity to go anywhere I want when I want to. It's esstential to life feeling right.\n\nI stopped at a steak house that night for dinner. The waiter asked where I was from, and I told him about driving cross-country visiting bodies of water and writing about them. He was intrigued and asked where I'd been that day. I told him about my experience with the golden fields.\n\nHe said, somewhat incredulous, \"You're doing this by yourself? Aren't you lonely??\n\nI told him, \"I'm never lonely as long as I'm paying attention.\"\n\nHe persisted, \"I wouldn't want to drive cross-country unless I had someone to share it with. It seems like it'd be kind of an empty experience.\"\n\nI smiled because, to me, that experience wasn't empty, it was alive. There wasn't absence, there was presence.\n\nI told him, \"Connection isn't just with people. I was connected to those fields and with that moment. I've found that as long as I'm appreciating what I'm seeing, feeling, thinking and hearing, I'm never really alone.\"\n\nI could tell he didn't relate to what I was saying. When I got back on the road, I asked myself, \"Why is it that I crave space? Why is that I don't feel \"bereft\" when I'm by myself?\"\n\nI think part of it is I feel connected to loved ones even when we're not together. The connection I have with my loved ones exists even when we're miles apart. They're with me ... even when they're not with me.\n\nThe fact is, I am an ambivert. I enjoy being with people and I enjoy not being with people. I am both a public person and a private person.\n\nBeing around smart, talented, interesting people energizes me. And exploring new places and spaces on my own energizes me. It's not an either-or, it's both. Socialization and solitude are two sides of the coin of a creatively productive life.\n\nWhat I know fur sure is that I need time and space to \"mull and muse.\"\n\nWhat do I mean by \"mull and muse?\" Time and space to reflect on what I've seen, heard, read. Time to roll thoughts around in my head. To observe the world around me from all angles. To savor ideas and insights like you would a ripe piece of fruit. To connect dot thoughts in new ways.\n\nPerhaps my favorite example of someone who also seemed to operate best with a mix of socialization and solitude was ... Abraham Lincoln.\n\nSeveral years ago, I was hired to train the board of Entrepreneurs Organization in public speaking. As a special treat, they arranged for a private group dinner at Lincoln’s Cottage in Washington DC following our day-long training.\n\nI got there an hour before the others arrived. The first thing I noticed as I walked in was how \"spare\" the cottage was. Each room had only a few items. A desk. A chair. A small table with a lamp. It was as if the walls were whispering, \"Space to think. Space to think.\"\n\nI instantly got it. This was where Lincoln came to be alone with his thoughts. Where he escaped the pressures of the White House and found much-needed solitude to reflect upon our history and create a visionary document that changed the course of our nation.\n\nI don't imagine Lincoln felt \"lonely\" while writing that magnum opus. I imagine his mind and soul were on fire. I imagine he welcomed the opportunity to write without distractions.\n\nI had a great life before I took off for my Year by the Water. However, like many people, I was going, going, going. There weren't many opportunities to be alone with my thoughts ... much less to reflect on them or write about them. I now have that time ... and I honor it.\n\nMany creatives talk about their need for head space so they can do original work. Being alone is when they are able to dig deep - without interruption - and envision new ideas, original art, innovative break-throughs. It is where they access the exquisite state of flow.\n\nYet in today's \"crazy busy\" world, too few of us have time for contemplation. That's why I'm sharing these inspiring quotes about the importance of making time and space for ideation.\n\nI hope these quotes catalyze insight - maybe even a conversation with friends and family members - about why you crave a room or road of your own to connect with your creativity.\n\nAnd I hope you never again feel a need to apologize for needing space. It's not selfish, it's smart. Solitude and socialization are not mutually exclusive; they are the best of both worlds.\n\n1. \"The only time we waste is the time we spend thinking we're alone.\" - Mitch Albom\n\n2. ”We need society, and we need solitude, as we need summer and winter, day and night, exercise and rest.” – Phillip G. Hamerton\n\n3. ”Being solitary is being alone well: luxuriously immersed in doings of your own choice, aware of the fullness of your own presence rather than of the absence of others.” Alice Koller\n\n4. ”To go out with the setting sun on an empty beach is to truly embrace your solitude.” – Jeanne Moreau\n\n5. ”The more powerful and original a mind, the more it will incline towards the religion of solitude.” - Aldous Huxley\n\n6. ”It is only in solitude that I ever find my own core.” – Anne Morrow Lindbergh\n\n7. ”When you acknowledge the integrity of solitude, and settle into its mystery, your relationships with others take on a new warmth, adventure and wonder.” – John O’Donahue\n\n8. ”Women need real moments of solitude and self-reflection to balance out how much of ourselves we give away.” – Barbara de Angelis\n\n9. ”Who hears music feels his solitude peopled at once.” – Robert Browning\n\n10. \"Loneliness expresses the pain of being alone; solitude expresses the glory of being alone.\" - Paul Tillich\n\n11. \"Alone had always felt like an actual place to me, as if it weren't a state of being, but rather a room where I could retreat to be who I really was.” —Cheryl Strayed\n\nWhere and what is your Utah? Where do you retreat to be yourself by yourself?\n\nPablo Picasso said, \"The meaning of life is to find your gift. The purpose is to give it away.\"\n\nPlease understand that part of of your legacy is contributing your gifts - your writing, startup, art, songs, screenplay, painting, sculpture, art, music, solutions, vision.\n\nHow, when and where will you give yourself a room - or road - of your own?\n\nWhen will you temporarily \"escape\" from people and schedule in time for creative solitude so you can muse and mull your reflections, experiences, insights, stories?\n\nIt's not a luxury, it's a necessity. It's not indulgent, it's an investment."
