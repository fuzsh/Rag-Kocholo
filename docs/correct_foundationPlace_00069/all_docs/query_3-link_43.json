        "text": "COLORADO SPRINGS, CO / March 11, 2024 â The Come and See Foundation, which exists to ensure all seven seasons of THE CHOSEN are completed and translated into 600 languages, today announced the release of the first two episodes of Season 4 for churches and prisons to host a promotional screening beginning Wednesday, March 13, 2024.\n\nTHE CHOSEN is the first-ever multi-season TV show about the life of Jesus that allows men, women, and children worldwide to see Him through the eyes of those who knew Him. Come and See is able to make THE CHOSEN possible due to the generosity of supporters around the world joining in the mission to translate all seven seasons of the show into 600 languages, distribute it globally, and keep it free for all in The Chosen app.\n\n\"For the first time, a full season of The Chosen will be made available to churches and prisons before it starts streaming. This is exactly why we're working with Come and See. They share our hearts to get this show free to as many people as possible, and they are willing to try new things to do it. We can't wait to see people experience this in community,â said Dallas Jenkins, creator and director of THE CHOSEN.\n\nâThe energy this groundbreaking series is bringing worldwide is electric â we hear stories every day of people engaging with the humanity of Jesus as their lives are transformed,â said Stan Jantz, CEO of the Come and See Foundation. âBy making the first two episodes of Season 4 available to churches, weâre leveraging technology and resources right at our fingertips. By collaborating with our ministry partners, we are creating a new resource for discipleship so that fans of the show can experience it together in their own church communities. In addition, through our partnership with Prison Fellowship, we are able to bring Season 4 to incarcerated individuals, bringing hope only found through the authentic Jesus. Weâre thrilled to give back to our devoted fans and serve as a catalyst for global impact, helping people come and see the life change that can come from knowing Jesus.â\n\nâThe Chosen has become a cultural phenomenon, giving fresh insight into Jesusâ implausible selection of the least, the last, and the lost as the leaders of the greatest spiritual awakening the world has ever known,\" said Heather Rice-Minus, president and CEO of Prison Fellowship. \"At Prison Fellowship, we are proud to partner with the Come and See Foundation to bring The Chosen to incarcerated men and women, so that the modern-day âleast of theseâ not only personally encounter the authentic Jesus, but catch a vision for the role they have to play in building the Kingdom in and out of prison.â\n\nFor churches, promotional screening access to Season 4 is available for free through Outreach Media and Sermon.net. Please visit www.comeandseefoundation.org/church-preview for instructions on access, church promotional material, and post-screening discussion guides. All screenings are free to attend and are in person only. Episodes 3-4 will be available beginning March 24, and the remaining episodes shortly following.\n\nThe content available for promotional screening access in prisons is time-restricted and for in-person groups only. Episodes 3-4 will be available beginning March 24th, and the remaining episodes shortly following.\n\nâ"
