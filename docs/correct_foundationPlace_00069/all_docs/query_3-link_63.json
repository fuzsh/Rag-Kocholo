        "text": "Aspen, CO, March 22, 2023 — Best Buddies International, a nonprofit founded in 1989 by Anthony K. Shriver to establish a global volunteer movement that creates opportunities for one-to-one friendships, integrated employment, leadership development, and inclusive living for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD), is excited to announce a generous grant from The Diane & Bruce Halle Foundation to further our mission of inclusion by launching friendship programs in Aspen, CO.\n\nBest Buddies is built upon four key mission pillars: one-to-one friendships, integrated employment, leadership development, and inclusive living. With the grant provided by The Diane & Bruce Halle Foundation, Best Buddies will focus on furthering our mission of inclusion through launching Friendship programs with a goal of opening 4-6 school chapters and opening an Adult Citizens’ program with monthly activities. These programs will help people with IDD form meaningful one-to-one connections with their peers, gain self-confidence and self-esteem, and share interests, experiences, and activities with peers both with and without IDD.\n\nCurrently, Colorado has Best Buddies programs at 15 schools. Each chapter is supported by a Faculty Advisor and/or Special Education Advisor plus a Chapter President, in addition to the Program Manager. The grant provided by The Diane & Bruce Halle Foundation will make it possible to serve more individuals with IDD in Aspen.\n\nFor more information about Best Buddies in Aspen, please contact Director, Mission Advancement Rachael Fischer at RachaelFischer@bestbuddies.org, or 317-339-4540.\n\nABOUT BEST BUDDIES INTERNATIONAL:\n\nBest Buddies® is a nonprofit 501(c)(3) organization dedicated to establishing a global volunteer movement that creates opportunities for one-to-one friendships, integrated employment, leadership development and inclusive living for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities.
