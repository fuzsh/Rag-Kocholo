        "text": "September 1939\n\nThe German army occupies Krakow.\n\nOctober 26, 1939\n\nGerman-occupied Poland, with the exception of the provinces directly annexed to the so-called Greater German Reich, is placed under civilian rule and becomes known as the Generalgouvernement. Hans Frank becomes Governor General. Krakow becomes both the administrative capital of the Generalgouvernement and of District Krakow within the Generalgouvernement.\n\nGerman authorities issue a decree requiring Jews and Poles residing in the Generalgouvernement to perform forced labor.\n\nDecember 1, 1939\n\nGerman authorities require Jews residing in the Generalgouvernement to wear white armbands with blue Stars of David for purposes of identification.\n\nJanuary–March, 1940\n\nGerman authorities require Jews residing in the Generalgouvernement to register all property and assets.\n\nMay, December 1940\n\nGerman authorities expel some 55,000 Krakow Jews out of the city into the surrounding countryside.\n\nMarch 21, 1941\n\nGerman authorities establish a ghetto in which they require the remaining Jews living in the city to reside. Located in the Podgorze section of Krakow, the ghetto houses between 15,000 and 20,000 Jews.\n\nJune 1941\n\nThe SS and Police Leader for Krakow establishes a forced-labor camp for Jews in Krakow-Plaszow. During the next year, the SS and police establish eight other forced-labor camps for Jews in Plaszow, with the central camp on Jerozolimska Street. Among these camps is the forced-labor camp for Jews deployed in the German Enamel Products firm owned by Oskar Schindler.\n\nMarch 23–24, 1942\n\nThe Gestapo (German secret state police) arrests 50 Jewish intellectuals residing in the Krakow ghetto and deports them to Auschwitz, where all of them are registered as prisoners.\n\nMARCH 1942\n\nThe SS and police deport 1,500 Jews from the Krakow ghetto via Plaszow to the Belzec killing center.\n\nJune 1 and 6, 1942\n\nThe SS and Police deport up to 7,000 Jews from the Krakow ghetto via Plaszow to the Belzec killing center. The Plaszow camp staff kills nearly 1,000 of these Jews before the train resumes its journey to Belzec.\n\nOctober 28, 1942\n\nThe SS and Police deport approximately 6,000 Jews to Plaszow. They kill at least 600 during the operation in the ghetto, 300 of them children. After a selection to determine individuals suited for labor, the SS sends the overwhelming majority of Jews on this transport to the Belzec killing center.\n\nDecember 23, 1942\n\nMembers of the Jewish Fighting Organization, the underground resistance group in the ghetto, and partisans from the Communist People's Army attack the Café Cyganeria, an establishment catering to German military personnel, and kill several Germans.\n\nMarch 13–16, 1943\n\nSS and police authorities liquidate the Krakow ghetto. During the operation the SS kill approximately 2,000 Jews in the ghetto and transfer another 2,000 Jews, the members and families of the Jewish council, and the Krakow ghetto police force to Plaszow. The SS and Police transport approximately 3,000 more Krakow Jews to Auschwitz-Birkenau, where the camp authorities select 499 men and 50 women for forced labor. The rest, approximately 2,450 people, are murdered in the gas chambers.\n\nSeptember–December 1943\n\nThe camp authorities and guards at the Plaszow forced-labor camp for Jews murder virtually all of the Jewish prisoners in a series of mass shootings.\n\nJANUARY 1944\n\nThe SS Economic and Administration Main Office takes over the Plaszow camp and converts it into the Krakow-Plaszow concentration camp. The SS liquidates the remaining forced-labor camps for Jews in the Krakow and Radom Districts of the Generalgouvernement and concentrates the Jewish forced laborers in Krakow-Plaszow. In spring 1944, the SS also transports Hungarian Jews to Krakow-Plaszow.\n\nJanuary 14, 1945\n\nThe SS guards evacuate the last 636 Jews from Krakow-Plaszow in the direction of Auschwitz.\n\nJanuary 17, 1945\n\nHans Frank and his administration flee Krakow."
