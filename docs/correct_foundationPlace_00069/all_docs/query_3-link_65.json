The Comarch product employs the model-driven (catalog-driven) concept, which enables the order orchestration of hybrid networks in telecoms, where virtual network functions and network services are modeled consistently, with physical network functions and legacy network services employing the TMF SID model. SFO (using ETSI NFV ISG terminology) can implement end to end service and MANO orchestration, and manage the VNF instantiation process. Comarch Service Fulfillment & Orchestration can implement this process either as one solution or in a federation model orchestrating third-party domain orchestrators. This means that SFO can play the role just of the orchestrator and/or manage end-to-end order orchestration in telecom within the domains.\n\nIntegrations\n\nNo integrations listed.\n\nRatings/Reviews\n\nOverall 0.0 / 5\n\nease 0.0 / 5\n\nfeatures 0.0 / 5\n\ndesign 0.0 / 5\n\nsupport 0.0 / 5\n\nThis software hasn't been reviewed yet.
