        "text": "IoT consortium honors member companies and other exemplary individuals contributing to its mission of ensuring secure interoperability for consumers, businesses and industries\n\nBEAVERTON, OR – August 14, 2017 – The Open Connectivity Foundation (OCF), a leading Internet of Things (IoT) standards body, today announced the winners of its first annual Outstanding Contributor Awards. These awards highlight OCF’s member companies as well as individuals who have made exemplary contributions to OCF and its work toward advancing IoT standardization.\n\n“The Open Connectivity Foundation and its members believe that secure and reliable device discovery and connectivity is a foundational component to enable IoT,” said John Park, Executive Director of the Open Connectivity Foundation. “We are grateful to have the support from these influential companies and individuals who are committed to helping us achieve our goal.”\n\nBelow is a full list of companies and individuals recognized by the OCF Outstanding Contributor Awards:\n\nMember Companies:\n\nComarch – Comarch created the OCF test system and continuously works to create new tools and maintain the existing code. As a member of OCF, Comarch takes on an active role by extensively working with OCF standard developers to solve any ongoing issues and refine OCF requirements.\n\nIntel – Intel leads the Strategy, Certification Work Group and Liaison work groups, as well as a number of individual contributions, and has played an imperative role in the development and release of the OCF specification and implementation requirements.\n\nQualcomm – Qualcomm was instrumental in the demonstration of a highly optimized implementation of IoTivity-Constrained at Computex 2017 in Taiwan. The implementation has since been further optimized to reduce code-size by 20 percent.\n\nRuntime IO – Runtime IO worked in concert with Qualcomm on the IoTivity-Constrained implementation demonstrated at Computex 2017. Specifically, Runtime has enabled a temperature sensor, a humidity sensor, and a magnetometer on the development board with Qualcomm’s QCA4020 SoC.\n\nSamsung Electronics – Samsung Electronics is one of OCF’s key contributors in terms of specifications, open source, promotional activities and membership recruitment. Samsung released some of the first OCF-certified products.\n\nIndividuals:\n\nCableLabs:\n\nBrian Scriber – Nominated for his leadership of the Security Work Group, Brian was instrumental in the release of the OCF 1.0 specification.\n\nComarch:\n\nJacek Hryszkiewicz, Comarch – Jacek is a project manager responsible for overseeing the creation of the OCF test app.\n\nCisco\n\nWouter van der Beek – Wouter performed a pivotal lead role in creating the tooling and the necessary support that brought the OCF 1.0 specification to market.\n\nETRI:\n\nHongki Cha – Hongki is the vice-chair of the OCF healthcare project and has contributed significantly to the development of the healthcare device specifications and data models.\n\nHoneywell:\n\nDavid Kaufman – David played an instrumental role in the creation and release of the OCF 1.0 specification.\n\nIntel:\n\nDavid Brenner – As the OCF events chair, David built an ecosystem of OCF proof-of-concept demonstrations to promote OCF’s value within the industry.\n\nEd Agis – Ed helped solidify a certification program that is inclusive of both members and staff, elevating the visibility of certification-readiness within the OCF organization.\n\nGeorge Nash – George played a crucial role in enabling generic Java support for Linux and Windows and addressed static code analysis issues exposed by Coverity code scans.\n\nKishen Maloor – Kishen is a lead engineer on the IoTivity-Constrained project, which he introduced and promoted at the OpenIoT Summit in Europe and North America.\n\nNathan Heldt-Sheller – Nathan helped coordinate development efforts and implementation of IoTivity for OCF 1.0, developing code and contributing to the Open Source Work Group and the Security Work Group.\n\nRichard Bardini – Richard played an imperative role in the release of OCF 1.0 and has been vital to its success within the IoT market.\n\nKistler Instrumente AG\n\nOndrej Tomcik – Ondrej is responsible for the Dockerization of IoTivity, which has simplified testing and implementation for new members.\n\nMicrosoft:\n\nDave Thaler – Dave made significant contributions to OCF 1.0, particularly in the areas of core development, bridging, and security, and contributed to the design of several specification features for both OCF 1.0 and IoTivity.\n\nSamsung:\n\nDwarka Dayama – Dwarka was a key author in the first version of the OCF certification procedure requirements as well as the OCF 1.0 specification.\n\nJinHyeock Choi – JinHyeock worked on the overall OCF structure to develop architecture, functional block diagram and core framework, and designed several features such as the resource model and transaction procedures.\n\nMark Trayer – Mark was a key player in the development of the smart home and resource type specification and the development of OCF’s core code and bridging specification.\n\nMoonki Hong – Moonki is a core contributor to the success of the OCF specification demonstrations previewed at CES 2016 and Mobile World Congress 2016.\n\nPhilippe Coval – Philippe is an active member of the OCF Automotive Project and helped integrate IoTivity on numerous platforms.\n\nSanjeev BA – Sanjeev is responsible for the initial collaboration between OCF and GENIVI Alliance, defined use cases and requirements for the OCF Automotive Project and contributed to the success of the OCF specification demonstrations previewed at CES 2017.\n\nUze Choi – Uze helped lead the initial release of IoTivity and delivered the open source code with feature enabling and verification.\n\nZiran Sun – Ziran actively contributes to OCF by reviewing IoTivity patches and maintaining IoTivity’s core code base while introducing new features, fixing bugs and reviewing the code.\n\nWichmann Consulting:\n\nMats Wichmann – Mats led the team that launched the OCF certification program and assisted in the development of certification procedure requirements.\n\nVIA Technologies:\n\nRichard Brown – Richard was instrumental in the growth of OCF and standardization awareness across Asia, working to demonstrate the value of OCF through trade shows, OCF-hosted events, speakerships and press.\n\nAbout the Open Connectivity Foundation\n\nBillions of connected devices (phones, computers and sensors) should be able to communicate with one another regardless of manufacturer, operating system, chipset or physical transport. The Open Connectivity Foundation (OCF) is creating a specification and sponsoring an open source project to make this possible. OCF will unlock the massive opportunity in the IoT market, accelerate industry innovation and help developers and companies create solutions that map to a single open specification. OCF will help ensure secure interoperability for consumers, business, and industry. The AllSeen Alliance now operates under the Open Connectivity Foundation.
