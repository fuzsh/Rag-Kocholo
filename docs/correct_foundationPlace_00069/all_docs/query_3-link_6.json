They join seven other new members from Europe announced earlier this month and are coming together to collaborate this week at the first-ever LinuxCon Europe taking place in Prague, Czech Republic.\n\nToday’s new Linux Foundation members include:\n\nAbove IT is a Dutch ICT integrator that implements the newest open source technology while optimizing business processes for the Small and Medium Business (SMB), enterprise, government, education and embedded systems markets.\n\n“Linux is the foundation for all of our open source software development and business in general. The choice for open source technology is driven by the market demand for innovation, agility, and continuity of services in sectors like SMB, education, industry and government institutions. Above IT recognizes the innovative power of technologies like open virtualization and open standards as enablers of business agility. By joining The Linux Foundation, we will be able to push our technology to the edge with more direct collaboration with a worldwide community of developers, vendors and IT users,” said Dimitri van der Spek, CEO, AboveIT.\n\nComarch has been an active player in the mobile and embedded software domains since 2001. Through a variety of projects in the area of mobile software development, integration, quality assurance, interoperability and cross-platform consulting services, Comarch has proven its deep technical knowledge, know-how and market understanding. With more than 3,500 employees, Comarch can offer flexibility and scalability in building business partnerships and expertise alliances.\n\n“Linux-based solutions have always been an important part of Comarch’s offering since the company was created in 1993. We want to share our experience in virtually all Linux flavors, including desktops, servers, clusters, mobile/embedded and automotive platforms,” said Dariusz Filipski, R&D Director, Open Source, Mobile Solutions & Services, Comarch. “Membership in The Linux Foundation will bring us closer to our business partners as well as open source communities to streamline our efforts for providing what’s best in open technologies.”\n\nCSR is a leading global provider of personal wireless technology, including Bluetooth, GPS, FM and Wi-Fi to industry leaders in consumer electronics, mobile handsets and the automotive industry. Its technology has been adopted by market leaders in a wide range of mobile consumer devices. With close to 3,000 employees and a longstanding Bluetooth market leadership position, CSR brings a wealth of knowledge to the Linux community,\n\n“Linux is at the heart of networking and wireless technologies,” said Ahmet Alpdemir, SVP Mobile, CSR. “Our Linux Foundation membership will inform our Linux and open source strategies and allow us to collaborate on advancing Linux in this area.”\n\nSymbio is a global software R&D company providing software product engineering to industry leaders in mobile phones, consumer electronics, automotive In-Vehicle-Infotainment (IVI), industrial systems, and internet and cloud services. The backbone of Symbio’s expertise for consumer devices is a deep understanding of Linux architecture and system performance. Symbio utilizes a Design Centric Development (DCD) approach paired with agile programming methods to help its clients meet the ever-increasing demand for more consumer-friendly, user-experience driven device software. Symbio’s main locations are in China, Finland, Sweden and the USA.\n\n“Linux plays a central role in the work we do for our clients developing consumer devices, automotive IVI or industrial systems. Let’s face it, most of the projects we carry out are pretty demanding, and Linux provides the flexibility, accessibility and technical feasibility for us to meet those high demands,” said Konsta Hansson, VP & General Manager, Symbio. “We’re looking forward to fruitful collaboration with the Linux community and contributing to the promotion, protection and advancement of the Linux operating system.”\n\nTieto is based in Northern Europe and provides IT and product engineering services.
