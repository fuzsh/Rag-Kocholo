        "text": "POLAND Advertis has designed and prepared friendly office space for the Comarch group in the Beta building at Eurocentrum Office Complex on Al. Jerozolimskie in Warsaw.\n\n“Following an analysis of the layout of rooms and the profile of Comarch’s activities we came up with a number of approaches for changing the appearance of the offices. The scope of the work included the preparation of the design, its implementation as well as the assembly of decorative, information and navigation elements. The reception area has been given a modern character with a logo made of spatial letters as well as photo wallpaper that covers the opposite wall.

The passageways have been lined with ten prints on matte, aluminium slabs as well as three different photo wallpapers covering the entire surface of the corridor walls.
