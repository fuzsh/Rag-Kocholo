Its reputation is founded on tradition, the outstanding achievements of the faculty and the attractive curriculum. The mission of the University is to advance knowledge through high quality research and teaching in partnership with business, professions, public services and other research and learning providers.\n\nThe University\n\nIt is a centre of academic excellence where research and teaching are mutually sustaining, and where the context within which research is conducted and knowledge is sought and applied is international as much as regional and national. The University continuously extends and updates research programs and contents of study curricula, with a special emphasis on their interdisciplinary and international nature. 613 projects are currently being carried out by international and national research teams.\n\nStudy at AMU\n\nThe University is organized into 20 Faculties where mostly training-through-research is offered together with high quality supervision according to the HRS4R policy adopted at AMU. Each fellow may take advantage of the supervisor’s experience or contacts. AMU has received the \"HR Excellence in Research\" award and has implemented the principles of the European Charter for Researchers and the Code of Conduct for the Recruitment of Researchers."
