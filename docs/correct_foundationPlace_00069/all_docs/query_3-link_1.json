        "text": "The Symbian Foundation today took time out from the Mobile World Congress to present the variety of ways in which members have been contributing to the success of the open source platform, while simultaneously boosting their own business.\n\n- Symbian is the only mobile open source project in which active members truly determine the future of mobile. - stated Lee M. Williams, Executive Director of the Symbian Foundation - Members are raising their profile in the ecosystem and generating new business opportunities for themselves through the diverse methods in which they are engaging with the project. These range from making major technical contributions in code to platform direction and organizational governance. We have active member representatives from all over the industry leading platform evolution on the four technology Councils, and many companies sponsoring and leading regional events and developing new web-based services that serve the Symbian community.\n\nAn example of one of these services is the Collaborative Test Database, currently being developed by foundation member Comarch SA. It will offer a web-based interface for accessing test suites for the Symbian platform, saving developers both time and money.\n\n- At Comarch, we are very proud of the fact that we are delivering world-class expertise through the design and implementation of the Collaborative Test Database â€“ a potent web-based tool that will increase collaboration, sharing and innovation throughout the Symbian community - states Pawel Bieryt, EVP, Telecommunications Business Group, Comarch SA. - Comarch experts are devoting their time and extensive know-how to ensuring the continued growth of the most recognized community in the mobile world.\n\nSymbian has also begun holding member events around the world that are planned and sponsored by member companies. The purpose of these events is to update members on the latest innovations in the Symbian roadmap and provide unparalleled regional networking opportunities.\n\nThe Symbian Foundation manages the release of the platform source code, but the foundation itself has no development resources, and so members are wholly responsible for creating and contributing feature enhancements to the Symbian platform.\n\nAbout the Symbian Foundation\n\nThe Symbian Foundation is an independent, non-profit organization whose mission is to enable an open ecosystem dedicated to creating the most innovative user experiences on mobile devices. Symbian maintains the code for an open source software platform based on Symbian OS and software assets contributed by Nokia, NTT DOCOMO, and Sony Ericsson, including the S60 and MOAP(S) user interfaces. The Symbian platform is now a fully open source. The foundation promotes collaboration, contributions and active participation, and operates as a meritocracy. Symbian's board of directors comprises: AT&T Mobility LLC, Fujitsu Limited, Nokia Corporation, NTT DOCOMO, INC., Qualcomm Innovation Center, Ltd., Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd., Sony Ericsson Mobile Communications AB, ST Microelectronics NV, Texas Instruments Inc., and Vodafone Group Services Ltd. The Symbian Foundation has offices in the UK (London), US (Foster City), Japan (Tokyo), Finland (Helsinki), China (Beijing) and South Korea (Seoul)."
