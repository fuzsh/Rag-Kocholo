The Faculty offers over 20 philologies but teaches as many as 50 languages! It was granted the A category by the Ministry of Science and Higher Education, study programmes conducted at the Faculty lead in rankings prepared by the Education Foundation “Perspektywy”, and talented students join the prestigious Diamond Grant program winners.\n\nStudies at the Faculty of Philology have enjoyed unflagging popularity for years, allowing graduates to work, among others, as a translator, editor in publishing houses, teacher in schools, journalist, or employee of diplomatic or special services. Internships and paid internships offered by companies cooperating with the Faculty together with vocational courses and certified training, available to all interested students, can help in smooth entry to the labour market.

Many research societies and student organizations operate at the Jagiellonian University, including faculty- and university-wide ones. These societies allow students to spend their free time actively, gain knowledge, develop their talents, participate in engaging, unconventional projects, go on research and team-building trips, participate in conferences, and meet fellow students outside the lecture halls. There are more than 20 student associations at the Faculty of Philology, f.e. Slavist Students Academic Association.\n\nSlavist Students Academic Association has conducted its work for several decades, acting in favour of extending knowledge, developing interests in Slavonic issues, and integrating students’ environment. The operation of the Association covers mostly organising academic meetings (sessions, conferences), travels to linguistic training and campuses, providing younger colleagues with culture and habits of Slavonic countries. The association organises as well national contests in translations from Slavonic languages. Students may publish their research papers in “Students’ Academic Journal of the Institute of Slavonic Studies”, and other texts in the online journal IMAGINARIA (the journal accepts popular and scientific texts, commentaries, reportages, essays, reviews, portraits as well as poetry).\n\nStudents interested in the international dimension of studying can participate in a wide variety of exchange programmes, such as Erasmus+, Utrecht Network, bilateral exchange programmes, European university Una Europa, or the domestic mobility programme called MOST.\n\nMore than just studies\n\nStudent Government of the Faculty of Philology\n\nFrom our students\n\nJessica, Czech Philology\n\nHow to use your study time properly?

It’s freedom. At the University you are not treated as a child which gives you flexibility but also requires responsibility!\n\nGabriela, Croatian Philology\n\nSlavonic Philology is exceptional and unique. We study in small groups, what involves a very individual approach toward each student, making communication with our teachers easier. Interaction with people involved in Slavonic Philology is the best experience.\n\nMateusz, Slovakian Philology\n\nStudying Slavonic Philology gives me the possibility to learn about cultures which remain unknown to us although they are geographically close. One of these cultures is the culture of Slovakia. The programme gives me the opportunity to learn Slovakian as well as acquire knowledge of Slovakian culture.\n\nNatalia, Bulgarian Philology\n\nI love the academic atmosphere! It is full of kindness and friendly. Thank’s to my Slavonic Philology programme I have experienced unforgettable moments and felt united with other Slavonic specialists.\n\nFrom our lecturers\n\nDominika Kaniecka, PhD, Chair for Croatian and Slovenian Philology\n\nStudying is firstly an intellectual adventure. At Slavonic Philology, we support the development of individual humanistic interests, create sensibility and teach openness to the unknown.\n\nGraduates\n\nGraduates of the Slavonic Philology are going well in the labour market and find employment in institutions and companies which, due to the international character of their operation – are looking for people with very good knowledge of languages and cultures of Western and Southern Slavs. Fluent knowledge of at least one Slavonic language (Bulgarian, Croatian, Czech, Serbian or Slovakian), good knowledge of another Slavonic language together with English, German, Russian or French (which are taught during the study programme), as well as specialist knowledge of the culture of Slavonic countries – these factors ensure finding good and satisfying employment.\n\nOutsourcing companies (Kraków has become recently a real headquarters of them) like Shell, Deloitte, IBM, Comarch, Capgemini, Heineken or Philip Morris give employment to our graduates (translations, accountancy, projects and logistics management). Since many years our graduates find employment in the touristic sector, publishing houses, diplomacy, cultural institutions related to Bugaria, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Serbia and Slovakia as well as international companies operating in these countries’ markets.
