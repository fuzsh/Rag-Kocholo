It was a fulfilling experience that laid a strong foundation for my teaching career\n\nFive years ago, I embraced a new adventure and moved to China, where I found my first opportunity to teach young learners in an international setting.

I enjoy talking to them about things that matter to them and learning about their experiences and feelings. My classroom is like a friendly community where we share ideas and learn from each other together\n\nQualifications:\n\nMasters Degree in Education\n\nProfessional Background:\n\nI worked for the British Council in Krakow for 5 years before joining ESTI school but I have been teaching in Krakow since 2011. I started teaching English to travel, to learn languages and learn about cultures around the world and this journey has taken me to China, Costa Rica, Spain and Slovakia. I have also taught in the International School of London. I now live in Krakow with my Polish wife and son who is aged 7.\n\nMy approach to work:\n\nI like to use a communicative method of teaching as much as possible, where the class learns from each other as well as the teacher and we share information about our experiences and knowledge on the subjects we are studying. This allows the students to progress at their own speed and means that they build on their strengths and understand where they need to improve and allows me to help them with this growth.\n\nAbout me:\n\nIn my spare time I enjoy reading and theatre when I have the chance. As a family we like to go to the countryside and we enjoy cycling and exercise. We have recently acquired a dog, so I donât think this will change any time soon. I enjoy playing a range of sports but now I usually play with my son and we often play tennis or go to the local park to practise hoops.\n\nSylwia Biskup\n\nPolish teacher\n\nQualifications:\n\nMaster of Linguistics, teacher of English, Spanish and foreign literature\n\nProfessional Background:\n\nTeaching has been my lifelong passion, and I feel incredibly fortunate to have 22 years of experience in this rewarding field.

My classroom is like a friendly community where we share ideas and learn from each other together\n\nQualifications:\n\nMaster's degree in Pedagogy, majoring in pedagogy with a specialisation in care and behaviour pedagogy. I am currently expanding my knowledge and qualifications by studying Sensory Integration at the Krakow Institute of Development and Education.\n\nProfessional Background:\n\nI have gained experience working with children in childcare institutions, and working as a teacher-educator at the Polish Mother Tongue School has enriched me with the experience of being in a multicultural environment. At Esti school I teach Early Childhood Education in Polish.\n\nMy approach to work:\n\nIn my work, I aim to create a caring and inclusive environment where each child feels motivated to discover their potential. I understand that every child learns in their own time and I believe in the importance of recognising successes, even the smallest ones. To me, education is not only about imparting knowledge, but also about instilling values, developing creativity and shaping character.\n\nAbout me:\n\nI am deeply passionate about exploring the world through travel and immersing myself in various activities that enrich my experiences. Whether it's cycling through picturesque landscapes or embarking on exhilarating mountain hikes, I find joy and fulfilment in the outdoors."
