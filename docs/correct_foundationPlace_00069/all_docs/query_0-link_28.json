        "text": "Capitalism driven by private enterprise and self-balancing markets, as world history shows, has evolved over centuries and has been flexible enough to fit various cultural systems. Centrally controlled economies were established in Eastern Europe and in parts of Asia as a brutal political experiment in the late 1940s.\n\nAt the foundation of this economic system lay the suppression of private enterprise and the exile of capital owners. For almost half a century industrial private property was banned in all Eastern European states, yet in some countries, including Hungary and Poland, small craftsmanship and small plot farming were tolerated.\n\nEven if initially nobody said it: freeing entrepreneurial initiatives and granting legal guarantees to private property meant restoring the basic preconditions for capitalism. When in 1989 the first post-communist government declared the freedom of economic life, thousands of Poles launched their enterprises investing their savings and borrowings in start-ups. Soon the number of private enterprises increased almost from zero to 0.5m entities and in the late 1990s it reached 2,5 m registered firms which, for obvious reasons, predominantly were small and very small. The number of firms in Poland oscillates around 3 mio creating a relatively dense entrepreneurial tissue.\n\nInitially, most of these newly founded enterprises were active in retail and whole-sale trade. They have dominated this sector easily as the government policy dismantled the large state owned internal and foreign trade companies. Small trade firms were facilitated by the privatization of real estate in urban centers and other localities.\n\nAfter a period of rapid expansion of the private sector, the beginning of the 21st century brought a time of qualitative growth and differentiation of private business activities with larger privately founded companies active in all areas of the economy.\n\nIt is not an exaggeration to say that family firms have been crucial in the successful rebirth of Polish capitalism, although this fact has not been widely recognized. In fact, in a traditional society such as that of Poland, the family is the main source of financial and manpower support for almost all entrepreneurial activities. Thus, if 97% of all existing businesses are small firms created by entrepreneurs with the support of their families, they are in nuce family firms. Being de facto family firms, the Polish private enterprises have learned to recognize themselves as such. If in 2001 just 13% of small firms defined themselves as family firms. By now this percentage approaches 40%, being still smaller than the EU average with 71% of small firms calling themselves family firms.\n\nThe growing visibility of family firms in Poland has three drivers: Firstly, some large privately owned companies (like Fakro of the Florek family, Koral of the Koral family or Wisniowski of the Wisniowski family), have started to identify their family legacy which has encouraged others to follow suit. Secondly, the passage of time has forced the founders to prepare the enterprises for the succession of management and ownership and these circumstances have required taking into consideration the relationship between family and enterprise. Thirdly, the Polish government supports awareness programs aimed to encourage entrepreneurs to anticipate their retirement or exit in such a way as to preserve the public value of the company. The combination of these factors provides an increasing visibility to the reality of family firms in Poland.\n\nThe number of family firms in Poland and their economic weight is largely a matter of definition, but one can say, following the estimates of Lukasz Sulkowski that “family businesses are about 50% of all business entities, and that they generate about 40% of GDP, generating about 50% of all workplaces”.\n\nThe importance of family firms becomes apparent when one looks at the leading businesses in all sectors of the economy, except in energy production. For instance, Comarch - the leading software engineering firm is a property of the founder Janusz Filipiak and his family, Mokate – a leader in the production of cocoa and coffee drinks is the business of Mokrysz family; ES-System K – the fast growing refrigeration equipment producer was founded and is controlled by the Konsor family; Inglot cosmetics was launched and is developed by the Inglot family; InPost - the biggest independent nationwide postal service provider was found by the Brzóska family; the largest producer of windows in plastics Oknoplast, was created and developed by the Placek family. And these are only a few of many examples.\n\nIf small family firms are omnipresent, the new and important economic phenomenon in Poland are medium- and large-sized family-owned companies. Their performance has become an important consideration to the country’s economy. These companies have acquired some scale, organizational complexity, became professionalized in management and are capable of becoming important players in larger business operations. Some of them, like for instance Buma Construction Group and Inglot, have smoothly passed through the succession of management and ownership although hit by the sudden deaths their founders and main shareholders.\n\nIn one generation the principles and the main actors of the Polish economy have been entirely reversed and the country has moved from the central command and impersonal state ownership to the market rules with family-faced identity capital.\n\nPoland: the Bright Spot on the Old Continent\n\nAleksander Surdej Email: [email protected] Posted: May 2015\n\nWhen the communist system collapsed in 1989 Poland was not an obvious candidate to become the post-communist economic transition star. It is true that its Solidarnosc movement was credited for its role in subverting the Soviet domination, but the country at large was perceived as economically backward with a large share of population living in the country side, working in private, but fragmented agriculture and with large industrial factories dominated by strike prone trade unions.\n\nAnd yet Poland is now internationally recognized as the success story. Starting from the position of a poor country whose GDP per capita amounted in 1992 to 30% of Euro-area countries in 2013 it reached 62% of this benchmark. Between 1990 and 2011 Poland’s GDP per capita increased 119% outpacing such traditional growth champions as Hong Kong and Singapore. Poland’s economy continued to grow even during the recent global financial crises making the country one of rare cases of successful resistance to external shock factors.\n\nThe reforms introduced in Poland in the beginning of 1990s were of rather radical character with price deregulation, trade liberalization, budget balancing and privatization of state owned companies. These reforms freed market mechanisms and made entrepreneurship and private companies the basic engine of economic growth.\n\nThe pro-market orientation of economic policies has rapidly improved the efficiency of resource allocation. Instead of poor quality goods typical of the communist era foreign investors, domestic producers and importers opened to 38 million Polish citizens the possibility of a broad range of consumer goods and fast improvements of the level of living. Between 1990 and 2011 household consumption in Poland grew by 146 percent, an increase similar to that of South Korea. In Poland there are now more cars per person than in the United Kingdom and the number of registered vehicles in Krakow is larger than in Berlin. The 1.24 per person ratio mobile phones is higher than in several West European countries. The distance between Poland’s and Western Europe’s level of income, quality of life, and perceived happiness now seems to be the shortest ever.\n\nAbandoning the command economy, Poland has created a regulatory framework more market friendly than the average of the world. By 2013, Poland scored 7.14 on the index of economic freedom generated annually by the Fraser Institute, close to France – 7,38, and higher than Italy 6,85 or Greece – 6,83.\n\nThe proof of the country’s institutional maturity was its entry to the European Union in 2004. The membership in “the club of Europe” has strongly anchored Poland to legal and political standards of advanced economies. Together with the membership card Poland has been receiving from the EU large modernization funds amounting to 70bl euro in the period 2007-2013 and 80bl euro in the period 2014-2020. The government of Poland has used these resources to predominantly build modern airports and new highways. Poland has now 12 modern airports, with the Warsaw aspiring to the role of the regional hub and other three large international airports located in Krakow, Gdansk and Katowice. The airports together with the network of highways whose length increased to almost 2000 kilometers offer easy access to Poland as a site of investments, businesses and tourism.\n\nThe proximity of the markets of Western Europe and the abundance of well educated and relatively young labor force have made of Poland an attractive place for foreign investors. For more than a decade the country has been receiving yearly more than 10bl euro of foreign investments. Foreign direct investments are concentrated in such sectors as car industry with the presence of Fiat, General Motors, Volkswagen, Toyota, Isuzu, Man, Volvo; home electronics - Sharp, LG Electronics, Toshiba; home appliances like refrigerators - Bosch, Siemens, Electrolux, Whirlpool, LG and Samsung; software engineering – Google, Motorola, Indesit, but many more, small and large are present, especially in real estate or food sector.\n\nThe inflow of foreign investors has been the vote of confidence in the future of the Polish economy, but its success depended on the entrepreneurial spirit, energy and commitment of millions of Poles who a generation ago boldly embraced the freedom and the principles of market economy. They can pick now merited fruits of their work.\n\nFamily Firms in Poland: Identity Capital that Boosts Economic Development\n\nCapitalism with private enterprise and self-balancing markets, as the World history shows, has evolved over centuries and has been flexible enough to fit various cultural systems. The centrally controlled economies were established in Eastern Europe and in parts of Asia as a brutal political experimentation in the late 1940s. At the foundation of this economic system was the suppression of private enterprise and the exile of owners of the capital. For almost half a century in all Eastern European states industrial private property was banned, but in some countries, including Hungary and Poland, small craftsmanship and small plot farming were tolerated.\n\nEven if initially nobody said it: freeing entrepreneurial initiatives and granting legal guarantees to private property meant restoring the basic preconditions for capitalism. When in 1989 the first post-communist government declared the freedom of economic life thousands of Poles launched their enterprises investing their savings and borrowings in start-ups. Soon the number of private enterprises increased almost from zero to 0.5m entities and in the late 1990s it reached 2,5 m registered firms which, for obvious reasons, predominantly were small and very small. Since then the number of number of firms in Poland oscillates around 3m creating a relatively dense entrepreneurial tissue.\n\nInitially most of newly founded enterprises were active in retail and whole sale trade. They have dominated this sector easily as the government policy dismantled the large state owned internal and foreign trade companies. Small trade firms were facilitated by the privatization of real estates (building, apartments) in centres of towns and other localities.\n\nAfter the period of quantitative explosion of private businesses since the beginning of XXIth century the Polish economy has entered the period of qualitative growth and differentiation of private business activities with larger private founded companies active in all areas of the economy.\n\nIt is not an exaggeration to say that family firms have been the crucial factor in the successful rebirth of the Polish capitalism, although this fact has not been widely recognized. It is so because in a traditional society such as the Polish one the family is the main source of financial and manpower support for almost all entrepreneurial activities. Thus, if 97% of all existing businesses are small firms created by entrepreneurs with the support of their families, they are in nuce family firms. Being de facto family firms Polish private enterprises learn to recognize them selves as such. If in 2001 just 13% of small firms perceived them selves as family firms, by now this percentage approaches 40%, being still smaller than the EU average with 71% of small firms perceiving them selves as family firms.\n\nThe growing visibility of family firms in Poland comes from three sources. Firstly, some large privately owned companies (like Fakro of Florek family, Koral of Koral family or Wisniowski of the same name family) have started to identify them selves as such encouraging others to use this concept. Secondly, the passage of time has forced the founders to prepare the enterprises for the succession of management and ownership and these circumstances have required taking into an open consideration the relationship between family and enterprise. Thirdly, the Polish government supports awareness raising programs aimed to encourage entrepreneurs to anticipate their retirement or exit in such a way as to preserve the public value of the company. The combination of these factors gives an increasing visibility to the reality of family firms in Poland.\n\nThe number of family firms in Poland and their economic weight is largely a definitional matter, but one can say, following the estimates of Lukasz Sulkowski that “family businesses are about 50% of all business entities, and that they generate about 40% of GDP, generating about 50% of all workplaces”.\n\nThe importance of family firms becomes easily noticed when one looks at the leading businesses in all sectors of the economy, except energy production. Thus, for instance, Comarch - the leading software engineering firm is a property of the founder Janusz Filipiak and his family, Mokate – a leader in the production of cacao and coffee drinks is a business of Mokrysz family; ES-System K – the fast growing produced of refrigeration equipment has been founded and is controlled by Konsor family; Inglot cosmetics has been launched and is developed by Inglot family; Inpost - the biggest independent nationwide postal service provider has been found by Brzóska family; the largest producer of windows in plastics Oknoplast has been created and developed by Placek family. More examples in abundance.\n\nIf small family firms are omnipresent, the new and important economic phenomenon in Poland are medium and large size family owned companies whose fate becomes important to the country’s economy. These companies have acquired some scale, organizational complexity, became professionalized in management and capable of being an important player in larger business operations. Some of them (eg. Buma Construction Group and Inglot) have smoothly passed through the succession of management and ownership although hit by fatal accidents of their founders and main owners.\n\nIn one generation the principles and the main actors of the Polish economy have been entirely reversed and the country has moved from the central command and impersonal state ownership to the market rules with family faced identity capital.\n\nThe economic growth must go on! A likely scenario Poland.\n\nTwo decades of a steady growth of the Polish economy has been the result of the positive coincidence of domestic and external factors. Against some predictions Poland has been able to create a political system which offers the democratic alternation of the government without endangering the economic stability. This fact offers a good business climate for international investors and encourages their inflow. In addition, internal institutional maturity has been facilitated by a good timing of the European Union membership. When in the late 1990s the prospects of the EU membership credibly emerged. Poland benefited from a surge of foreign investors willing to settle in the country and to take advantage of the single European market. Later, after the entry to the EU in 2004 investors and businesses continued to come since they got a credible assurance that doing business in Poland is not a high risk exercise.\n\nBy late 2014 the immediate and medium term prospects for the Polish economic seem positive. The country has a low level of public debt amounting to 43% of GDP and enjoys positive ratings as the sovereign borrower (A-/A/Stable in Fitch's categories). This allows the Polish government to conduct flexible budgetary policies and to have capacity to finance large projects in the energy sector.\n\nIn the period of centrally controlled economy Poland became an industrialized country with an overgrown heavy industry. Since 1990 the industry sector has been downscaled, but Poland still has industrial traces with the share of employment in industry (22%) higher than EU average and an important latent industrial potential thanks to the presence of cheaper, but qualified labor. For this reason the costs of energy are an important factor to preserve the country’s place as a producer of mid-processed industrial goods and an important regional supplier to the German economy. Furthermore electricity and heat are produced in Poland predominantly by power and heat plants alimented with hard coal, since Poland has abundant resources of hard and brown coals. These factors explain why the Polish government tries to slow down the European Commission’s attempts to rapidly and radically reduce the emission of CO2. Besides the struggle to prolong coal extraction the Polish government has decided to build a liquefied natural gas terminal in Swinoujscie at the Baltic Sea to get an extra degree of freedom, if the imports of natural gas from Russia become unstable. The crude oil and fuel sea terminal in Gdansk fulfill the similar role of enabling the import of fuels from the Gulf Countries and other sources.\n\nCheaper but cleaner energy will remain the constant worry for subsequent governments, but in the short term the investment attractiveness of Poland is based chiefly on a large domestic market and availability of educated employees and workers. As all modern economies Poland has a large export sector (exports of goods and services amounts to 48% of GDP – large share for a medium-size economy), but its growth dynamics to date has been predominantly dependent of domestic consumption with trade deficits balanced by the inflow of foreign capital and European Union cohesion funds.\n\nIn last two decades Poland has undergone an educational revolution with massive expansion of higher education. The share of young entering higher education colleges increased from 7 to almost 50% of each year cohort. This educational acceleration offers a large pool of well educated employees with a relatively good command of English and other foreign languages. This fact has been rapidly caught by international companies managing business process outsourcing (BPO) services. Only in the Krakow area BPO companies such as Cap Gemini or Accenture employ 35,000 and the total BPO employment in Poland exceeds 120,000 employees as the BPO sector has been growing yearly at a pace of 20%. Besides general business education Poland has an increasing number of trained software engineers and they seem competitive enough to attract investors such as Google, Microsoft or Motorola and to get employed in large domestic software firms such a Asseco or Comarch.\n\nThe demand for office spaces has boosted the investment in this type of buildings in large cities such as Krakow, Wroclaw or Katowice. Most large international construction groups have been active in Poland and, despite fast growth, this sector, together with housing construction, fortunately avoided the real estate bubble that had shaken the economies of Ireland of Spain.\n\nOne of reasons of this fortuitous but fortunate fact was the earlier decision to delay the entry to Euro-zone and to keep the national currency in the period of the global financial turmoil. As recently stated by the report of the National Bank of Poland the membership in Euro-zone would have led to macro-economic imbalances and likely to real estate bubble due to the increased inflow of investment money and easiness in getting loan mortgages. Now it seems that Poland will continue with the national currency, as the Polish zloty increases economic policy flexibility to a greater degree than internal devaluation through downwards wage adjustments and budgetary cuts imposed on Euro-zone countries in the period of the recent crisis.\n\nWhat about the future of private enterprise in Poland? It will stay dominated by family firms. They will keep maturing organizationally and plan in advance scenarios for the succession of ownership. In-family succession will be the favorite option, but short of such alternatives smaller family firms will be sold to other family owners, and the large ones will likely become publicly traded and family owned companies ad the Warsaw Stock Exchange authorities prepare to open for such type of companies.\n\nThis short enumeration of basic economic factors seems to justify good forecasts for the Polish economy at least in the horizon of 2025. What would happen beyond this date depends on multiplicity of factors including the speed of the society’s ageing and the development in the European Union and in border states such as Ukraine or Russia and is largely beyond the grasp of any empirical analysis."
