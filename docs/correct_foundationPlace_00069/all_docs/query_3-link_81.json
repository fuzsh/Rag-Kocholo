        "text": "Being sensible can get you far as an investor. But can we go beyond common sense to get even farther?\n\nCommon sense investing is a widely accepted approach by the wealth management industry. All those who stay patient and expect returns over a long term, as opposed to instant gratification, usually get awarded. For decades, this approach has proved worthy despite market ups and downs worldwide. If youâre betting on it for the future, youâre probably going to be fine.\n\nBut can we do better that that in terms of portfolio management? May artificial intelligence be a âhidden senseâ that is going to be discovered by investment managers?\n\nTo address this question, whatever the answer will be, it doesnât hurt to formulate the foundation or background for a common sense. It comprises of 3 basic rules which presumably stay true no matter if the investment decision is made by a human or by âsomeoneâ else:\n\n- Investing with low cost in products that give appropriate exposure â this can be easily achieved through ETFs, which brings a plethora of possibilities, risk factors and opportunities at reasonable and justified cost. From wide index funds to thematic vehicles - selection options are overwhelming, which sometimes doesnât actually help.\n\n- Taking care of diversification and proper asset allocation - be prepared for various market regimes and make the most of the risk one may accept in the portfolio. Itâs like Ray Dalioâs All Weather Portfolio solution that takes lessons of past decades and brings real value.\n\n- Rebalancing from time to time to monetize your decisions and look for arising opportunities. Being disciplined in investing sounds a good choice even if you cannot avoid turning to heuristics from time to time.\n\nIs that fair enough? Simple rules work for simple strategies and make sense for most investors. What if one likes to do a bit better? At least since 1952, certain models work to help your portfolio be more immune to market volatility. Taking advantage of Modern Portfolio Theory, simplifying life with CAPM or embedding intuition from Black and Litterman model bring a certain remedy although here come some problems, typical for all portfolio optimization methodologies. They simply fail to assume the right return model. Predicting market returns over the next year is much more difficult that predicting weather. Actually, the latter one is quite cyclical over time. Thank God, âall weatherâ portfolio may be a solution in the former challenge. The right risk model is crucial. We may choose between popular, but far-from-perfect, sample covariance, add time decay factor, or look for clustering nature of asset volatility and correlations plausibly explained by Marcos LÃ³pez de Prado with hierarchical risk parity model.\n\nSo how about artificial intelligence in investing?\n\nThey say history does not repeat itself, so there is no hope in trying to predict the future. Indeed, it never happens to be the same, the swans are not as black as before, the news are always new but â¦coincidences and results are conceivable â at least in most cases. Of course, itâs not easy to predict exactly the scale of market reaction, the length of cycle, the main âactorsâ on the upper and lower side. But still some rules are there â trends that last and change, mean reversion over time, economic dependencies, cycles and signs.\n\nThis is where AI may help. Not each and every time, but the evidence is there, in the data and models. While you cannot be sure about single stock return, a broader picture of relative strength of asset classes and products may improve your portfolio results. And this is the rule number 4 of common sense â if something seems to work, why not try it out? When you keep the basic rules in place, you are safe in the end â or in a long run, if you will.\n\nClick here to learn about how machine learning models work in practice to help recommend mutual funds and build portfolios with higher Sharpe ratio\n\nGrzegorz Prosowicz Ph.D., Consulting director, asset & wealth management, Comarch"
