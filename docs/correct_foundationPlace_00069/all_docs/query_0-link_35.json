Julian is an early UK pioneer of organic farming methods, commencing the conversion of his UK farm in 1975 and joining the board of the Soil Association in 1984. He started out as an actor and teacher in holistic thinking, co-founding the Institute for Creative Development, in Belgium (1976) before taking on the management of the Hardwick Estate, a family farming property in South Oxfordshire. His farm went on to win a number of national awards for the quality of its organic foods. Julian has served on many national committees concerned with the British rural economy. These include the BBC Agricultural and Rural Economy Advisory Committee; the South East England Agricultural and Rural Economy Advisory Board and the Country Land Owners Association Rural Committee. He has advised the British government's 'No 10 Policy Unit' and founded three organisations specifically related to helping protect and advance the needs of family farms, quality foods and the rural economy. He broadcasts and writes extensively and is the author of the book entitled \"Changing Course for Life - Local Solutions to Global Problems\". Julian is President of the International Coalition to Protect the Polish Countryside and divides his time between the UK and Poland.\n\nGabriela and Uwe von Seltmann\n\nGabriela and her husband Uwe von Seltmann are the authors of the project \"The Future of the Past\" which aims to emphasize the importance of the knowledge of our ancestors' past, especially when it is truly tragic (Uwe's grandfather was an SS man in Cracow and Gabriela's grandfather was murdered in Auschwitz). They have spent a few years meeting Poles, Germans and Jews discussing how the families of victims and perpetrators can coexist in today's world. Together they asked questions: How does the third-after-war generation relate to the family's difficult past which overshadows their present? And how to shape the future in order to secure peaceful being together? The research they have been doing is a challenge of social and political importance with an international dimension. Families of victims and perpetrators have to meet again and again, no matter if it is in Ruanda, the Balkan states, or in Germany/Poland. Former German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt once said it was better to speak of the \"future of the past\" rather than the \"presence of the past\". The project is future-oriented in this very sense. It is only if we succeed in processing the past in an open way that a process of mutual understanding can set in, thus bringing about peaceful interaction in the present and the future.

He is coordinator of the COSY-11 international collaboration conducting experiments on meson production at the Cooler Synchrotron COSY in Germany and vice-coordinator of the WASA-at-COSY experiment, which comprises about 200 physicists testing fundamental symmetries in nature by means of the decays of mesons. Paweł Moskal is a member of the KLOE-2 collaboration board conducting experiments at electron-positron collider DAFNE in Italy. The experiments aim at tests of quantum mechanics and searching for phenomena beyond the standard models of particle physics. He is the coordinator of the International Consortium carrying out International PhD Studies in Applied Nuclear Physics and Innovative Technologies funded by the Foundation for Polish Science. Paweł chairs the scientific and organizing committees of six international symposia and workshops devoted to meson physics and editor or co-editor of the proceedings books.\n\nJacek Paszkowski\n\nAfter graduating from the Academy of Physical Education in Warsaw, Jacek Paszkowski spent eight years working and studying in the US. Not fully satisfied with traditional physiotherapy education and the outcomes it offered, Jacek began his search for alternative approaches. At that point he got involved with Feldenkrais Method® of Somatic Education, which he studies and teaches extensively. After returning to Poland he established the Academy of Conscious Movement, promoting development of human potential through conscious movement and guided movement of awareness. This approach (using the Feldenkrais Method) helps people to gain tools to learn more efficiently, enhances wellbeing and develops awareness as a mean to live a happier, healthier life. Jacek is promoting this approach to education among healthcare practitioners, psychologists, musicians and teachers and a whole array of people who want to enrich their lives.\n\nJohn Scherer\n\nIn 1973 John joined the Leadership Institute of Spokane (LIOS), serving as Co-Founder and Core Faculty for the nation’s first competency-based Masters Program in the Applied Behavioral Sciences.
