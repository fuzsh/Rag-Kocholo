        "text": "AURORA, CO – MARCH 28, 2024 – Women in Plumbing & Piping (WiPP) is excited to announce its latest founding sponsor; IAPMO. This significant sponsorship is amplified by a strategic MOU and partnership with IAPMO’s charity, IWSH – the International Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene Foundation – uniting efforts to elevate the presence of women in the trades and address critical global water and sanitation issues.\n\nIAPMO’s backing of WiPP is a testament to a shared vision of fostering diversity, equity, and inclusion within the plumbing and mechanical sectors, mirroring IAPMO’s commitment to enhancing public health and safety worldwide.\n\n“By investing in and supporting women in plumbing, we are not only elevating the industry but also contributing to a more inclusive, resilient, and skilled workforce ready to meet the challenges of the future,” says Dave Viola, CEO of IAPMO. “It's not just about adding diversity for diversity's sake; it's about enriching our workforce with individuals who understand the stakes, the needs, and the best ways to meet them. Supporting diversity within the plumbing sector is not merely a matter of equality but a strategic imperative to enhance our industry’s collective expertise and creativity.”\n\nExpanding on this relationship, WiPP and IAPMO’s IWSH Foundation will further collaborate on initiatives that align with their mutual objectives. This partnership will concentrate on developing educational programs, mentorship opportunities, and international projects aimed at raising standards for water, sanitation, and hygiene globally.\n\n“Through the IWSH mission to deliver essential water and sanitation services to underserved communities, we recognize the critical role women play in not just utilizing these services but in their delivery and management. Women offer valuable insights, dedication, and approaches to problem-solving that are indispensable for the innovative and sustainable solutions communities deserve,” says Robyn Fischer, senior director, IWSH Foundation. “Supporting women in plumbing creates ripple effects—promoting gender equality, providing economic opportunities, and inspiring the next generation of female leaders in the trades.\n\nThis collaborative effort between WiPP, IAPMO, and the IWSH Foundation is a pivotal advancement towards creating a more inclusive and equitable environment within the plumbing and piping industry. Moreover, it underscores the critical role these sectors play in improving global health and environmental sustainability.\n\n\"We are incredibly proud to partner with IAPMO and the IWSH Foundation. Their support not only propels our mission to empower women in the plumbing and piping industries but also highlights the vital importance of our trade in advocating for public health and environmental stewardship,\" said Kim Gill, Executive Director of WiPP.\n\nFor more details about WiPP’s partnership opportunities, please visit: https://www.womeninplumbandpipe.org/opportunities."
