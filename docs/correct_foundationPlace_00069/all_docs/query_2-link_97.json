        "text": "The City of Oświęcim (Poland)\n\nCoordinates: 50º02'N 19º16'E\n\nThe existence of the city dates back at least to 12th century. Following the partition of Poland in 1772, the city was annexed to the Habsburg Austrian Empire, returning to Polish rule only after the end of WWI. During that time, Oświęcim became an industrial center and an important railroad junction. Jewish population in 1921 was 4,950. On the eve of World War II, there were about 8,000 Jews in the city, over half the whole population. Oświęcim was occupied immediately at the beginning of WWII. By October 1939, it was annexed into Greater Germany.\n\nLocated in and near the town of Oświęcim, the Auschwitz camp system was the largest of the concentration and death camp complexes built by the Germans in occupied Poland during World War II. The camp complex included Auschwitz I, Auschwitz II-Birkenau, Auschwitz III-Monowitz (Buna), and over 45 subcamps. It is estimated that between 1.1 and 1.6 million predominantly Jewish men, women, and children were murdered at Auschwitz, nearly all of them in the gas chambers at Auschwitz II-Birkenau.\n\nThe city of Oświęcim and the Auschwitz camp system were liberated by Soviet Army on January 27, 1945.\n\nBrief biographies\n\nMark Bader\n\nWas born in Oświęcim in 1927.
