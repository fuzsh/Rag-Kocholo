        "text": "Description\n\nWe are looking for 2 volunteers from different countries ready to join our team in the beginning of September 2024 for 10 months. Volunteers working in the office tasks are connected with the whole group of hosted volunteers and focused on organizing meetings and workshops, preparing posts for the blog \"ESC teaches me something\" and for Tik Tok, organising language course in your mother tongue, supporting ESC coordinator, preparing documentation from meetings, helping in different projects in IB Polska in different locations in Krakow and Tychy. Tasks in the office are various and shared among different project, so volunteers work in all our offices around the city, supporting coordinators or running own workshops for local community (seniors, youth or children). We encourage volunteers to try new things and to learn as much as possible. We also built the working plan together, basing on the volunteer's interests and skills.\n\nAccommodation, food and transport arrangements\n\nVolunteer's are placed in the flat rent by Ib Polska for ESC volunteers. We also provide monthly cards to move easily around the city. In the beginning of each month volunteers receive pocket money (150 €) and food allowance (70€). We always transfer money to the volunteers bank account opened in Polish bank or Revolut. Foundation IB Polska rents flats for volunteers. There is up to 4 people in one flat, 1 or 2 people in a room. They share bathroom and kitchen. Volunteers get travel costs back to the amount based on the distance calculator.\n\nTraining during the activity\n\nIB Polska coordinators provide all important information about the project during recruitment and even more practical information shortly before volunteer's arrival to Krakow. Sending organisation from the volunteer's country is responsible for preparation for the project and volunteer's task is to participate in the metting (online or face to face). During the project volunteers participate in obligatory trainings provided by the Polish National Agency. The part of the project is also Polish course on-line. IB Polska also provides different trainings for volunteers.\n\nParticipant profile\n\nIt's good if volunteers know communicative English, because it will be the project language for the whole time. We are looking for open-minded young people between 18 and 30 years old from different countries. Sex, religion and orientation don't count for us, but creativity, interpersonal skills and knowledge about social media would be useful. We will mail back only people whom filfill the form for candidates here: https://ib-polska.pl/aktualnosci/esc-2024/"
