        "text": "The Kosciuszko Foundation’s Teaching English in Poland Program is currently recruiting American teachers and American teaching assistants as volunteers for its 2024 Summer Camps.\n\nDo I have to be of Polish descent to participate?\n\nAbsolutely not! One of the things we love about the TEIP Program is teaching participants about the amazing country of Poland! We welcome all participants, whether they have Polish roots or know nothing about Poland. Our students appreciate getting to know the diversity of the United States.\n\nDo I need to speak Polish to participate?\n\nNo! It’s actually beneficial to our students if you don’t speak Polish (although we certainly welcome you if you do)! We try to give our campers a fully immersive English experience, and sticking to English the whole time makes the camp experience even more beneficial and authentic for them. At times when we’re not with students, we travel with a translator who will make sure you understand and are understood in all situations.\n\nDo I need to be a licensed, K-12 teacher to participate?\n\nWe have two types of participants: teachers and teaching assistants. Our teaching assistants come to us from all walks of life and all ages–from college students to retirees and everything in between! Teaching assistants offer their life experiences and cultural knowledge while they are assisting in classrooms. Our teachers come from all fields and kinds of instruction. We have had successful teachers in our program who were preschool teachers, university professors, corporate trainers, dance instructors, guidance counselors, military officers, and many more. If you know how to deliver an engaging, student-centered lesson, we’d love you on our team!\n\nIf I’m accepted, what does the “registration and insurance fee” cover?\n\nSince we are a non-profit, the registration and insurance fee helps us to cover our insurance and administrative expenses both in the U.S. and in Poland. With this fee, we purchase insurance for every staff member while in Poland. The insurance we purchase covers emergency medical situations and evacuations.\n\nThe Kosciuszko Foundation\n\nIs this a for-profit program?\n\nThe TEIP Program is fully non-profit! The program is administered by the non-profit, 501(c)(3) Kosciuszko Foundation. Since 1925 the Kosciuszko Foundation has been dedicated to promoting educational and cultural exchanges between the United States and Poland, and to increasing American understanding of Polish culture and history.\n\nPoland\n\nIs Poland safe?\n\nYes! Poland is a member of the European Union and a modern, European country. Overall crime rates in Poland (both violent and nonviolent) are significantly lower than in the United States.\n\nIs Poland expensive?\n\nMost things in Poland are at least a little cheaper than in the U.S. You will find your dollar stretches just a little farther in Poland. Once you are in Poland, meals, tours, and accommodations will be provided at no charge to you. You may want to bring some pocket money for things like snacks and souvenirs, however.\n\nIs the program free?\n\nWhat do you pay for/what do I pay for? The host camps pay for all of your basic needs once you’re in Poland: lodging, food, tours, entrance fees, transportation, etc. for the duration of the camps and for the three-day tour after camps.\n\nYou pay for your airfare to Poland as well as the insurance fee through the Kosciuszko Foundation.\n\nAccompanying persons will be asked to pay for their portion of the after-camp tours, this usually amounts to between $250-$500. The amount will be calculated by the Polish camp director prior to camp and will be communicated to the volunteer traveling with the accompanying person.\n\nDo I need a visa to enter Poland?\n\nNo. You only need a passport to enter Poland for camp. You will need a passport that expires January of 2025 or later to be given entry into Poland.\n\nOur Camps\n\nDo I meet you at camp? How do I get to Poland? How do I get around Poland?\n\nOur camps designate a central meeting area and time in a major city/airport (usually Warsaw, Kraków, Gdańsk, or Rzeszów) near the camp for the American staff to gather in Poland. You book your own transportation to Poland/the meeting point, and then the camp will provide all transportation, lodging, and food in Poland from that time until the time of departure.\n\nWhat does a typical day look like for American staff?**\n\nA typical day for all staff starts with breakfast provided by the camp. Classes typically start somewhere between 8 and 9 depending on the camp. The major meal of the day in Poland is lunch, provided by the camp, somewhere between 1 and 2 p.m. A light dinner is then served in the evening after camp is over. In the evenings, your hosts may provide a small activity, or you may be given free time to explore your new surroundings.\n\n**All camps’ schedules vary slightly. Olsztynek has a very different format. See Olsztynek section below for more information.\n\nA teacher’s typical day starts with classes in the morning. Class sizes are typically around 15 students. After lunch, teachers have time to plan and organize for the next day’s lessons. All necessary materials (within reason) will be provided by the camp organizers if requests are made ahead of camp. Teachers are welcome (although not required) to participate in afternoon activities in most camps.\n\nA teaching assistant’s(TA’s) typical day starts with assisting with class activities as needed in the morning and setting up for afternoon activities and games with the students. After lunch, the teaching assistants run English-based games, activities, crafts, and sports for the campers. This is a great time for the campers to practice their English in a low-pressure setting, and a wonderful opportunity for the TAs to get to know the campers even more.\n\nHow is the Olsztynek Camp different?\n\nThe Olsztynek Camp’s format is different in that teachers conduct shorter workshops at different times throughout the camp. During these workshops, teachers share an area of expertise with the students in English (American architecture, karate, and dance are just a few that have been given in the past). When they are not teaching, teachers are participating in activities in English with the campers. Olsztynek is a very active camp! Activities can range from hiking to kayaking and sailing.\n\nWhere do we stay during camp?\n\nAccommodations are usually hostel-style at or near the camp. Families/family members will be housed together (or separately on request). Some locations house staff at the school where camp takes place, while others will house teachers in a nearby hostel. All facilities will have Wi-Fi, linens, laundry capabilities or services, and at least a small kitchen for preparing and storing snacks and coffee.\n\nWhat do my weekends look like? While this varies from camp to camp, weekends are usually your time to explore the local area. Host camps typically offer a couple of small activities on the weekends but give you time to relax or explore. We have had staff members who use the weekend to go visit an ancestral village, do some shopping, or simply relax around camp.\n\nWhat does the end-of-camp tour look like? The purpose of the tour is to introduce American staff to the culture and history of the local region in Poland. Travel for the tour is typically done by chartered motor coach or train/bus, depending on the size of the group. The tours visit castles, museums and other historical locations as well as sites that introduce program participants to the unique culture and handicrafts of the region. Accommodations will be provided in hostels along the way, and meals during the tour will be provided by the Polish hosts.\n\nI have a special diet–can you accommodate me?\n\nIn short, if you can find food to eat when dining out at restaurants in the US, your diet can most likely be accommodated in Poland. Our Polish hosts try their hardest to meet your dietary needs, and common diets like vegetarian, vegan, and gluten-free are not a problem. Combination diets such as gluten-free AND vegan may be harder to accommodate and may require some flexibility or pre-planning on your part.\n\nHaven’t found what you were looking for. E-mail us with your questions. We will be happy to assist!\n\nteip@thekf.org\n\nSummer camps\n\nIn 2024 we plan to organize 9 camps. Besides Miłakowo, Olsztynek, Kraków, Cieszanow, Rakszawa, Basznia and Zab we will have two new location – Mikolajki and Zakopane. You will find location descriptions below.\n\nTEIP offers two types of camps: residential camps and day camps. Teachers are encouraged to teach English through their areas of expertise. We have taught conversational English via STEM, cooking, art, American sports, music, history, and folklore just to name a few. Teaching assistants share their knowledge of American sport, arts, and activities.\n\nCAMP LOCATIONS & DATES\n\nMIŁAKOWO\n\n(NORTHERN POLAND)\n\nCamp Dates: 07.01.2024 — 07.12.20024\n\nVolunteers: arrival date and departure date-TBA\n\nNumber and age of participants : 85 students (45 Ukrainian students and 40 Polish students).

Since then, it has been known locally as a place that celebrates both individualism and diversity.\n\nBy educating future citizens of a united and democratic world, we strive to equip our students with skills and knowledge which will allow them to enter adulthood fully aware of their rights and responsibilities. We wish to help shape open-minded individuals, who are able to appreciate cultural diversity and successfully face the challenges of the 21st century.\n\nWith this in mind, we have created a curriculum which focuses not only on teaching children English, but also on boosting their culture awareness. To achieve the former, we offer a variety of ESL classes taught both by Polish instructors and native speakers, so that by the age of 10 our students’ language proficiency allows them to function in English in everyday situations on a communicative level.\n\nWe build culture awareness by:\n\nextending the learning experience beyond the school year by hosting the TEIP English Language – American Culture camp during the summer holidays;\n\norganizing British and American celebrations (Halloween, Thanksgiving, Christmas);\n\nconducting British and American history and literature classes;\n\nparticipating in student exchange programs abroad;\n\nfostering international friendships among students by organizing Skype lessons and pen pal exchange with schools all over the world.\n\nIn recognition of our achievements to date, in 2016 we became a member of the UNESCO Associated Schools Network.\n\nOur school is part of the umbrella organization called Prywatne Akademickie Centrum Kształcenia (PACK, for short). It includes a Polish and an international primary school, an IB school and a Polish high school. It was the high school which was formed first in 1993 under the direction of Jerzy Waligóra, who is still the principal.\n\nFor the past five years, our school has had the honor of hosting the Kosciuszko Foundation TEIP camp, which has proved a great success among students and parents.\n\nEvery year, an amazing team of Americans comes to Cracow to teach Polish children about various aspects of American culture and the English language, such as:\n\nAmerican history;\n\nAmerican symbols and sights;\n\nAmerican animals and habitats;\n\nEnglish language through drama;\n\nAmerican celebrations and holiday traditions;\n\nAmerican sports and outdoor games.\n\nThe camp has now grown to 100 students who are eager to embark on their American experience in Cracow.\n\nThe old medieval city of Krakow is a great place to be with its imposing castle, many ancient monuments and churches, intriguing little streets and museums and the beautiful Vistula river flowing through the center of the city. It also has the largest and the most remarkably well preserved medieval square in Europe. Cracow is also a center of education with 200,000 students attending its 27 institutes of higher education. It is a very friendly place, with English being very widely spoken.\n\nFind more at:\n\nhttp://worldaroundschool.edu.pl/\n\nhttp://academos.krakow.pl/\n\nRAKSZAWA SUMMER CAMP (SOUTH-EASTERN)\n\nCamp Dates: 06.27.2024 — 7.10.2024\n\nVolunteers: arrival date and departure date-TBA\n\nNumber and age of participants: 50 Polish students.

No doubt you will understand why our motto is: professionalism and passion 🙂\n\nIn 1991, the Polish National Commission for UNESCO and the Polish Ministry of National Education invited the Kosciuszko Foundation to cooperate in meeting the growing English language needs of Polish youth after the fall of communism. The Kosciuszko Foundation developed the Teaching English in Poland Program (TEIP) to provide Polish high school students with vibrant and enriching interactive English language immersion experiences and practice in conversational English within an American cultural context at summer camps throughout Poland. It also incorporated principles of democracy, entrepreneurship, business etiquette and volunteerism to provide Polish students with the basic tools needed to ease the transition from communism to national independence and prepare them for participation in international arenas. From its inception the program was intended to give American teacher and student volunteers the opportunity to become acquainted with the people, history, language, culture and educational system of Poland.\n\nThe Polish National Commission for UNESCO bestowed its prestige and patronage to the project. It offered nationwide publicity for the program and would become an important vehicle for recruiting Polish students as evidenced by its record of promoting and sponsoring foreign language camps in Poland since the 1950’s.\n\nThe role of the Polish Ministry of National Education (MEN) was to fund the boarding school campuses and educational centers designated as camp sites, to compensate the Polish staffs required to work with the students and Americans, and to cover the costs related to the operation of the camps. Polish camp Directors (Administrators) would also receive funds to provide the American participants with a small stipend, classroom and extra-curricula facilities, room and board, experiences in Polish culture and life, complimentary excursions to local places of historical and cultural interest and an end-of-program tour.\n\nIt was determined that in order to execute the TEIP Program effectively, the Kosciuszko Foundation would have to rely on outside resources to financially support its role in the project. Its primary responsibilities for this program were to recruit, select and organize the American staff for each camp, arrange group flights to Poland, provide a program and curriculum guide and accident-medical insurance for its American participants and raise funds to cover basic costs related to launching the program. The TEIP Program was implemented by volunteer staffs of certified/experienced American teachers and student assistants recruited on a nationwide basis by the Kosciuszko Foundation.\n\nThe Western New York Chapter of the Kosciuszko Foundation recruited ten American teachers to implement the 1991 pilot program at a boarding school in Bydgoszcz. One hundred Polish students enrolled in the program that summer. In 1992, Christine B. Kuskowski, Kosciuszko Foundation member and Colorado and New York state educator and curriculum specialist, authored and presented the first official Teaching English in Poland Program and Curriculum Guide as a volunteer in preparation for leading an American staff and implementing the TEIP Program for high school students in Łomża. The Guide was also used by an American staff from the Western NY Chapter for launching the program at a camp in Ustka. This Guide was afterwards revised annually to accommodate the needs of American volunteers and Polish students and to keep in step with changing times and venues.\n\nIn 1993, the President of the Kosciuszko Foundation, Joseph E. Gore, Esq., appointed Christine B. Kuskowski as the Director of TEIP. As Director, Mrs. Kuskowski was responsible for publicity, communicating with Polish camp Directors, recruiting, selecting and notifying American participants, organizing camp staffs, updating the Program and Curriculum Guidelines, obtaining accident and medical insurance for KF participants, securing group flight accommodations, raising funds, and supervising the camps on-site. Under her vision and leadership, the program expanded rapidly reaching a record high of nine camps per year in 1995-1997 at various locations including boarding schools in: Gdańsk, Iława, Kraków, Limanowa, Łomża, Myślenice, Olsztyn, Płock, Przytok at Żielona Góra, Puławy, Tczew, Ustka, Warszawa and Zakopane.\n\nAt that time, it was presumed that the program would serve Polish high school students for only a few years. As studying the English language became a popular option in Polish schools, the TEIP Program grew in demand and was also opened to upper elementary and junior high school students. The curriculum and model for the upper elementary group was developed by Dr. Mary Kay Pieski in 1997 and was implemented at the Warsaw camp. For the first time, peer tutors were partnered with Polish students. The curriculum focused on assisting the students in refining their English language conversational skills, on motivating them to develop self-confidence while applying those skills, and on preparing them to engage in international endeavors.\n\nAs the English language became a popular foreign language in Polish schools, parents eagerly sent their children to TEIP camps. From 1998-2001, the Kosciuszko Foundation staffed six camps per summer. In 2001, the Educational Enterprise Foundation of Poland funded the program with 40,000 PLN enabling expansion to seven camps in 2002-2003 and four in 2004-2008. In 2003, the NIDA Foundation organized a six-day workshop for forty-one Polish teachers of English in cooperation with the Kosciuszko Foundation. Two American TESOL-ESL teacher-trainers were recruited by Mrs. Kuskowski to introduce current methodology in teaching English and in resolving contemporary classroom challenges. Mrs. Kuskowski and Anna Utecht, a former teacher certified in Poland who served as the assistant Director of TEIP, supervised the sessions held at a conference center near Warsaw. That year, Kent State and Marywood Universities offered graduate credit to American participants. During these later years, the Polish Ministry of National Education gradually reduced the number of camps in anticipation of possible budget cuts in 2009.\n\nThe Polish National Commission for UNESCO nominated Christine to be awarded the “Commission of National Education Medal of the Republic of Poland,” the highest award that the Ministry of Education of the Republic of Poland can bestow on an individual person for outstanding merit in the field of education… in appreciation for (her) personal contribution and devotion to the Kosciuszko Foundation Teaching English in Poland Program… for considerable accomplishments to promote educational and cultural relations between the United States and Poland…with thanks for that long-lasting collaboration”. She received the award at a ceremony that took place at the Polish Ministry of National Education in Warsaw on October 14, 2007.\n\nDuring the program’s foundation years, Mrs. Kuskowski was assisted by Regional Coordinators United States Army Colonel Anthony J. Smaczniak (Retired) and Mrs. Theresa Rivard of the Western New York Chapter; Mr. Walter J. Kuskowski, a former Social Studies teacher in the New York City public schools and co –founder Polish American Teacher’s Association; and by several teachers including veteran Camp Staff leader Mary Kay Pieski who contributed valuable volunteer service. The efforts of the staff of the Kosciuszko Foundation Warsaw office Robert Kirkland, Agata Kwinto and Joseph Herter, were invaluable in facilitating the program’s pre-camp arrangements and on-going implementation at all TEIP locations in Poland.\n\nIn 2009, the Polish Ministry of National Education withdrew its financial support from all summer foreign language camps. As a result, The Kosciuszko Foundation accepted the invitation of two administrators of former camps, who were able to find independent support to organize camps at their sites in 2009 and 2010. In 2009, through the initiative of Mary Kay Pieski, the Foundation introduced the Arts Enriched English Language Camp for students thirteen to fifteen years of age at the Polish Scouts Organization’s (ZHP) educational, environmental, and recreational center, “Nadwarciański Gród”, located in Załęcze Wielkie. The Delta Kappa Gamma Educational Foundation supported the development of the Arts Enriched camp by providing over $14,000 in grant monies to purchase musical instruments. The traditional TEIP language and American culture program was also conducted simultaneously at that site for upper elementary school students. A camp for senior high school students was held at the Ks. Janusz St. Pasierb Associated Schools for Economics Campus in Tczew near the Baltic city of Gdańsk for the thirteenth consecutive year.\n\nIn 2010, the Arts Enriched English Language Camp at the ZHP site was expanded to accommodate students twelve through eighteen years of age. A camp for senior high students was held for the fourteenth consecutive year in Tczew. The NIDA Foundation of Poland (Nidzicka Fundacja Rozwoju) supported the program at both camps by enrolling sixty scholarship students.\n\nIn 2011, the fifteenth annual Camp at Tczew that was scheduled to continue did not take place. The Arts Enriched English Language Camp at Załęcze was conducted for the third consecutive year but for two separate groups of young people: twelve through fourteen and those fifteen through eighteen.\n\nIn 2012, the Arts Enriched English Language Camp was held at Załęcze for the fourth year. Dr. Pieski secured a new English Language-American Culture Camp at the Internat Zespołu Szkół Zawodowych im. Stanislawa Staszica in Barlewiczki with the support of the non-profit group Kwidzyńskie Towarzystwo Pływackie and under the patronage of the local city government of Kwidzyń and the Polish National Commission for UNESCO. The elementary camp enrolled Polish students ages nine through twelve in a session lasting two weeks. The Arts Enriched English Language Camp took place in Załęcze for Polish students ages 12-18 and lasted for three weeks. The NIDA Foundation did not support any students in 2012. Mrs. Kuskowski withdrew as active Director in 2012 to care for her ill husband but continues to assist as consultant. Dr. Mary Kay Pieski, Ph.D. founder of the Ohio Chapter of the Kosciuszko Foundation, was appointed as the new Director of the TEIP Program and Dr. Teresa G. Wojcik, Ph.D. President of the Philadelphia Chapter as Assistant Director.\n\nThe year 2013 marked the seventh anniversary of collaboration with the Ośrodek Szkoleniowo-Wypoczynkowego, ZHP “Nadwarciański Gród” at Zalecze Wielkie. It also marked the fifth consecutive year that the Arts Enriched English Language Camp had been active at the same site. As we celebrated these accomplishments, two new camps were introduced through the efforts of Dr. Pieski and Dr. Wojcik one Arts Enriched English Language Camp at Otwock and one traditional TEIP Program in Pińczów. The Kosciuszko Foundation was grateful that the NIDA Foundation supported the students at the ZHP site once again. It should also be noted that UNESCO offered its honorary patronage to the camps in Załęcze.\n\nIn 2014, the TEIP program witnessed continued growth and new opportunities to expanded numbers of Polish students and American teachers. A new program was introduced for Polish high school students (15-18 years old) at the Otwock Camp with emphasis on conversational English in addition to continuing the Arts-Enriched English camp model for the younger students, aged 10 to 13. A site at Pińczów, secured for the program by Mr. Joseph Herter of the Warsaw Office, established a new cooperation with the local high school that will now offer its students the opportunity to attend the camp in addition to those students traveling from Przemyśl. The dates for the program in Załęcze were altered with the two-week camp for younger students taking place in early July and the three-week Arts Enriched camp occurring in late July. To accommodate requests made by our American and Polish teachers and students, the TEIP Program has embraced flexible scheduling regarding camp dates that would attract a greater number of participants. A new day camp was added in Mińsk Mazowiecki for local elementary students ages 10-13.\n\nEnthusiasm and praise for TEIP and its benefits continued to spread both in the United States and Poland with recruitment sessions taking place throughout the fall in the United States. In anticipation of the twenty-fifth anniversary of the TEIP Program, Drs. Mary Kay Pieski and Teresa G. Wojcik presented a session on the program to an international scholarly audience at the World Congress of the Polish Institute of Arts and Sciences in America, which took place in June 2014 at the University of Warsaw.\n\nSix camps were offered in 2015: two at Załęcze Wielkie, and one each at Otwock, Pińczów, Siennica, and Kraków.\n\nThe Teaching English in Poland Program grew to a record seven camps in 2016. Załęcze Wielkie offered a two-week overnight English Language American Culture Camp for students ages 10-13 and a three-week Arts Enriched English Language Camp for students ages 14-18. Otwock, Minsk Mazowiecki, Krakow Elementary, Krakow Middle and Krynica Zdroj held day camps.\n\nThe following camps operated in 2017: Zalecze Arts Enriched English Language overnight camp, Otwock Arts Enriched English Language day camp, Krakow Elementary English Language American Culture day camp, Krakow Middle/High English Language American Culture day camp, Krynica Zdroj English Language American Culture day camp ,Minsk Mazowiecki English Language American Culture day camp, and Zalecze English Language American Culture day camp.\n\nParticipation in the TEIP Program under the aegis of The Kosciuszko Foundation presents a unique opportunity for American volunteer teachers, their assistants (American college/university students), and Polish educators and students. As experienced educators and cultural representatives of the United States, members of the volunteer American teaching staff offer their cumulative professional expertise and collective personal commitment to the youth of Poland.\n\nIn its first quarter century, the TEIP program under the aegis of the Kosciuszko Foundation has hosted 130 camps throughout Poland at twenty two locations: Łomza, Utska, Kraków, Płock, Gdańsk, Iława, Olsztyn, Zakopane, Puławy, Przytok at Żielona Góra, Myślenice, Tczew, Warsawa, Goldap, Gorzów Wielkopolski, Limanowa, Załęcze Wielkie, Barlewiczki, Otwock, Pińczów, Mińsk Mazowiecki , Krynica, and Siennica. More than 13,500 Polish students and almost 2100 Americans have benefited from this program.\n\nThe American volunteer participants in the TEIP program are vital in effecting the Kosciuszko Foundation’s mission of promoting educational and cultural exchanges between the United States and Poland and of increasing American understanding of Polish culture and history. Under the present leadership of the Kosciuszko Foundation President and Executive Director, Mr. Marek Skulimowski, Dr. Mary Kay Pieski, Director of TEIP, Assistant Director of TEIP, Dr. Teresa Wojcik, and Dr. Grazyna Czetwertynska, of the Warsaw Office, TEIP continues to be dedicated to furthering its long-standing tradition of commitment to excellence, intercultural exchange, and educational innovation.\n\nHeartfelt thanks to our partners in Poland who have participated in and supported the Teaching English in Poland Program: The Polish National Commission for UNESCO for promoting the program under its patronage and the Polish Ministry of National Education for providing funds in Poland for camp sites (1991-2008) and their operation, for hiring Polish staffs, and for providing funds for the stipends and end-of-program tours for American participants. The following foundations and organizations in the United States and Poland that contributed to the functioning and development of the TEIP program include the following: Foundation for the Development of the Education System, Educational Enterprise Foundation, The Kosciuszko Foundation Wysocki and Frees Funds, The Polish American Teachers Association, Marie Sklodowska Curie Professional Women’s Association, Nidzicka Fundacja Rozwoju, Delta Kappa Gamma Educational Foundation, The Chicago, Ohio and Philadelphia of the Kosciuszko Foundation, Polish National Youth Baseball Foundation, the Cleveland Society of Poles, The Pulaski Association of Professional Men etc. and individual donors.\n\nWe extend warmest thanks to the Polish Directors and staffs for their hospitality and efforts in introducing Kosciuszko Foundation American volunteers to “everything Polish”; and soliciting funds to make the camps affordable for Polish students by partnering with community leaders and organizations.\n\nWe applaud Mrs. Christine Kuskowski for her visionary leadership and steadfast commitment to the program’s success, and Dr. Mary Kay Pieski and Dr. Teresa G. Wojcik for continuing and growing the program from 2012 to 2018.\n\nSince September 2018 the Teaching English in Poland has been administered by the Kosciuszko Foundation Poland under the auspices of the Kosciuszko Foundation in New York.\n\nWe look to the future, building on the achievements of the first twenty-five years to even greater successes in years to come."
