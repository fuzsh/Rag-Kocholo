Based on customer requirements, we design, develop, test and maintain software dedicated for specific needs. Our key customers are manufacturers of consumer electronics, semiconductors, and other electronic components. We are experts in wireless connectivity (Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, Z-Wave, proprietary protocols) and audio solutions.\n\nMobile application development and maintenance experience include iOS, Android, Tizen and cross-platform solutions. Deep knowledge of each platformâ€™s capabilities allows us to develop complex applications with deep system integration features and wireless connectivity. We develop applications for newer and older generation phones and tablets. Our testing background includes about 200 models of phones and tablets, which we use to develop, test, and verify our mobile applications.\n\nOur mission is to provide system architecture dedicated for the needs of each client and product. We always do our best to build tailored solutions that will conform to current and future system requirements. We are very flexible and always recommend architecture for current needs with possibilities for further extension. Not only that, but we apply monitoring to see how the created services are being used, and to make reasonable decisions based on real results.\n\nOver the years, Comarch has worked with various organizations and gained knowledge of how to support certification entities at each step of the creation of certification programs. Cooperation with leading standardization alliances has helped us to build our own portfolio of products and services for certification alliances, and to position our team as an equal partner in standardization-related projects such as test tool development, test development automation, and cybersecurity-related projects.\n\nDiscover more about certification products here.\n\nIn every project, we act in a planned and systematic way to ensure that the quality requirements of the final product are met in the process of its creation. Quality assurance is a critical and crucial element of every project, which is why we place particular emphasis on the quality of the products and services in order to meet increasing client expectations during the whole life of the project. As a result of our collective efforts to improve and develop the company's own quality management system, Comarch has been awarded a number of certificates. We provide QA services as part of the software, firmware, and hardware projects we run, and as a separate service to ensure quality for projects provided by customers.\n\nWe use our expertise in DevOps and the cloud to carry out administrative work, including tasks related to cloud structure management. This involves handling, compiling and configuring cloud solutions for projects, and managing these projects and configurations. We're equipped with the knowledge to handle cloud technologies from different vendors, but we can also provide appropriate supervision and support of Comarch Cloud."
