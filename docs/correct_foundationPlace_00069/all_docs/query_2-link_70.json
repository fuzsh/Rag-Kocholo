Focusing around its address at ul. Św. Jana 12 (previously at the headquarters of the National Archives at ul.

The Society is the oldest Polish member of this international organisation, and the president, Professor Jacek Purchla is also its vice president.\n\nThe Society is located in a historic tenement house – kamienica Krauzowska – at ul. Św. Jana 12, in the heart of the World Heritage listed centre of Krakow. The house was buit in 14th century in Gothic style. Its name comes from Krzysztof Krauze, city councilor who owned it in the 17th century. His efforts resulted in placing the eagle in the coat of arms of Kraków. The founding member of the Society, Klemens Bąkowski, who died in 1938, bequeathed the tenement house to the Society in his will. The Society regained the rights to it after the war in 1947, and its seat has been located here since 1972 (previously it functioned in the building of the Archives of Historical Records of the City of Krakow at ul. Sienna 16).\n\nHub’s activities are conducted in two representative rooms on the first floor, which in 2022 regained their former splendour after major conservation works that lasted several years."
