        "text": "Old Town\n\nThe Old Town is a magical place. For many centuries kings and their important guests used to come to Kraków through the St. Florian’s Gate, passed through the Main Square and continued along Grodzka and Kanonicza streets to the Wawel castle. Today the royal route is vibrant with life and crowded with tourists – even though a lot has changed, the place has retained its splendour typical of a royal residence. In 1978 the perfectly preserved medieval architectural arrangement, one of the most magnificent in this part of Europe, as well as the unique complex of historic sites from different periods, became the basis for the inscription of the former Polish capital on the UNESCO list. Tenements in various styles, beautiful residences, centuries-old churches, majestic university buildings, as well as the unforgettable Wawel, make you forget about the modernity. The Old Town, which includes the town from the period of the foundation of Kraków (1257), was closed with a ring of defensive walls as early as in the 14th century. At the beginning of the 19th century the walls had 47 towers and 7 main gates. The fragment of the fortifications with the aforementioned Florian’s Gate and three adjoining towers proves how mighty the fortifications were. At the end of the 15th century, another impressive defensive structure was built: the Barbican (once called the ‘Saucepan’ by the Cracovians). It used to be indestructible, and it even resisted the 19th century city cleaning-up campaign, during which the city fortifications were torn down. The Planty city park, a green ribbon now encircling the historic town centre, was created in place of the city walls.\n\nThe Old Town is also famous for a large number of historic churches (nearly 30), considering its size. On the Main Square stands the Romanesque Church of St. Adalbert. It is one of the oldest churches in Kraków. It dates back to the turn of the 11th and 12th centuries and was raised on the foundations of an older structure. Even though it was rebuilt the 17th century in Baroque style, it retained traces of the Romanesque style – both inside and outside. Other magnificent examples of sacred architecture include the church of St. Andrew (Grodzka 56) and the Baroque Church of Sts. Peter and Paul (Grodzka 54) from the 17th century, with characteristic figures of 12 apostles that decorate the temple’s fence. Gothic and Renaissance tenements also add charm to Grodzka street.\n\nOne of the Old Town quarters is occupied by the Jagiellonian University, the inheritor of the Kraków Academy founded in 1364 by king Casimir the Great. The university library, which boasts the largest book collection in Poland, is the university’s treasure. Originally it was located in Collegium Maius, one of Europe's few preserved medieval university buildings. Today, the building houses a museum with interesting and precious collections of items, among which you will find one of the world’s oldest globes with the name “America” on it.\n\nThe Main Square was marked out in the middle of 13th century. It was one of the largest squares in Europe and played the role of a commercial, administrative and judicial centre. The enormous square (200 x 200 m) was designed in such a way that it would meet the needs of merchants travelling along trade routes. The taverns and inns that used to surround the square are now replaced by restaurants and coffee shops. Colourful umbrellas, cabs awaiting guests, as well as pigeons, which perch on the historic buildings, lend the place a unique artistic and ludic atmosphere.\n\nThe Sukiennice Cloth Hall, reigning supreme in the middle of the square, reminds of the Main Square’s commercial role. The market stalls stood here as early as in the 13th century, but the elegant building we can admire now dates back to the 16th century (the earlier Gothic building burnt down, and what remains, among other things, are the pointed-arch arcades).\n\nSukiennice Cloth Hall, the pearl of the Polish Renaissance, still fulfils its functions: it contains stalls with various souvenirs, works of art and jewellery. The first floor houses the Gallery of 19th-Century Polish Art, a branch of the National Museum.\n\nThe most valuable building on the square is the Gothic St. Mary Basilica, which contains a unique monument: a 15th century wooden multi-panelled altar made by the famous sculptor, Veit Stoss. Apart from visiting the church, you can also climb one of its towers and delight in the beautiful view of the city."
