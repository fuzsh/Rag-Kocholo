Kraków is the most beautiful and alluring city in Poland. It was once the seat of the Polish Kings and escaped WWII with minimal damage. As a result, medieval streets, buildings and monuments are intact and surrounded by bars, pubs, clubs and restaurants. It has world-class museums and many universities, providing a rich cultural environment amidst a college-town atmosphere.

While Polish people are quite aware of the city’s appeal and visit in huge numbers, foreign visitors are relatively few for such an incredible place. Most non-Europeans have little idea of the city’s treasures and lively atmosphere. This is changing but everyone should see Kraków with their own eyes!

Most attractions are in the Old Town (Stare Miasto) and the adjacent Kazimierz (Jewish Quarter), so it makes sense to stay in one of these two sections.

We stayed in the boutique Hotel Indigo – Kraków Old Town, which occupies an interestingly renovated, old building and has a small gym (a big plus for me).

The center of Old Town, where most attractions are, is pedestrian only. Kazimierz (Jewish Quarter) and the parts of Podógrze of interest are within a 30-minute walk.

The tram is a good alternative. You can get a 20-minute tram ticket for just 2.8 Złoty (about US$0.65) for Zone 1 which is for the city. Zone 2 is for locations outside of the city which few tourists go to. There are longer periods for single rides, as well as 24-hour, 48-hour, 72-hour and 7-day cards. Preschool children, adults 70 years or older and people with disabilities can ride for free. You can buy tickets at the stations.

Kraków traffic is congested and not fun to drive in. Our car remained parked except when we went to the Wieliczka Salt Mine. You can take a bus there which includes the admission ticket.

Kraków has many free walking tours (tips expected) in English. We took two from Kraków City Tours, one of the Old Town and another to the Jewish Quarters with our informative guide Magda.

Many stalls sell amber stones and jewelry, a legacy of Kraków being on a busy trade route with the Baltic Sea, where sea amber is mined. Under the building is a dimly lit museum of excavated medieval merchant stalls and exhibits on the city’s history. It’s certainly worth spending an hour here.

Perhaps the most striking building in the Old Town is St. Mary’s Basilica. The foundation was constructed in the 13th century and the initial church was built in the next century. It has been expanded and modified ever since and the two-tower church is a UNESCO World Heritage Site

The Princes Czartoryski Museum has a superlative collection of paintings by European masters and numerous items from Polish history. The museum’s highlight and pride of Kraków is Leonardo da Vinci’s Lady with an Ermine, one of his only four female portraits (one being Mona Lisa).

I liked this amazingly decorated clock.

Kraków was once surrounded by a defensive wall and the Barbican was the main entrance. It’s the most preserved one in Europe and a common meeting point for walking tours. Normally, the inside is open from April to October, but was closed when we were there.

Kazimierz, formally established in 1335, was an independent town bordering Kraków. By the end of the 15th century, it became home to Jews who were being expelled from Kraków. In the mid-17th century, invasions, floods, famine and anti-Jewish riots decimated the town into a crumbling shadow of its former self. In 1800 Kazimierz, then under Austrian control, was incorporated into Kraków and rebuilt. Austria mandated all of Kraków’s Jews resettle here and eventually the population exceeded 60,000 between WWI and WWII. When the Nazis took over, the population was moved either to camps or to the ghetto across the river in Podgórze. With this history, it’s obvious why this is known as the Jewish Quarter.

During WWII, he dangerously entered the Warsaw Ghetto and Nazi concentration camps in order to record the horrific crimes against Jews. In 1942 he met with many Allied leaders, including US President Franklin Roosevelt to warn them about the Nazi’s actions, but to no avail. After the war, he taught at Georgetown University in Washington DC for 40 years.

In September 1939, Nazis entered Kraków and immediately began persecuting the Jewish population. They made Jews wear Star of David armbands, confiscated their property and belongings and closed all synagogues. In 1941, they forced the remaining 3,000 Jews who hadn’t been shipped away or allowed to emigrate to the newly designated ghetto in Podgórze. It was one of five major, metropolitan Jewish ghettos in Poland under the Nazis. Four families were forced to live in one small apartment and many were homeless. Windows to the “Aryan” side were bricked up. The area was surrounded by a wall, a remnant still exists with a memorial plaque in Hebrew and Polish.

This UNESCO World Heritage Site is a short drive or bus ride from the center of Kraków and was a working salt mine until 2007. From the beginning of operations in the 13th century, workers and artists decorated the mine with statues and embellishments.

We saw many of the highlights of Kraków, but just scratched the surface of what it offers. It definitely merits another trip when in the region.

I will always associate the city with Pope John Paul II (given name is Karol Wojtyla) who had lived there for four decades until he became Pope. His image is everywhere in Poland but particularly in Kraków, including this one on Bishop’s Palace in the Old Town.

He was a humanitarian and an inspiration to millions, able to relate to the poor and rich alike, fluently in eight languages. Based upon our week of travel and my study of Polish history and arts, I believe he wasn’t an anomaly for the Polish people, but a reflection of the richness of their culture.
