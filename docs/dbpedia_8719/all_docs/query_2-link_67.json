According to Alamgir Hashmi (1991) Faiz has long been \"a darling of both Marxist and liberal critics and translators\" (p 58). But Hassan has enunciated that translating Faiz has been a problematic task because some of the translations don't make justice to the original verse. Hassan recalled his conversation with Faiz in which he had expressed the inadequacy of the English translations of his verses and he had said in a genial style, Bhai tum kar do na..."
