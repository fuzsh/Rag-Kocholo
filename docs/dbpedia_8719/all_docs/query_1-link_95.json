The founders of the movement made sure that parallel movements in different languages took place by visiting diverse regions and talking to writers and poets whose expertise was in Hindi, Bengali, Marathi, Gujarati, and many more.",

        "text": "Hindi regional writers were already engaging with socio-political issues that dominated the lives of the masses in the 1930s, even before PWA came into being. Writers like Bhartendu Harishchandra and Mahavir Prasad Dwivedi were moving away from the world of fantasy and Chhayavaad (romanticism) and entering the realms of realistic writing, critical realism, and social realism. They attacked superstitions, religious traditions, and hierarchical oppression that took place in society."
