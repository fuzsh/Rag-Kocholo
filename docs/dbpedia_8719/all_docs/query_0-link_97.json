        "text": "Maata-e-loh-o-qalam chin gayi to kya ghum hai , K khun-e-dil men dubo li hain ungliyan meine\n\nZuban pe muhar lagi hai to kya ke rakh di hai , Har ek halqa-e-zanjeer men zubaan mene.” –\n\nFaiz Ahmed Faiz\n\nTr. – “What if my pen and paper have been snatched away?\n\nI have dipped my fingers in the heart’s blood,\n\nWhat if my lips are sealed?\n\nI’ve lent my tongue to each link in the chain.”\n\nFaiz Ahmad Faiz ( February , 1911 – November 1984) was a Pakistani poet, and author in Urdu and Punjabi language. He was one of the most celebrated writers of the Urdu language in Pakistan. Outside literature, he has been described as “a man of wide experience” having been a teacher, an army officer, a journalist, a trade unionist and a broadcaster. Faiz, a communist like neruda, was the son of a lawyer. He joined the newly formed progressive writers Movement in the 1930, served in the Indian army during the Second World War and became a lieutenant Colonel. After partition he moved to Pakistan, where he became editor of the Pakistan times, and English language daily. He also worked as managing editor of the Urdu daily imroz, and was actively involved in organising trade unions. In 1951 Faiz was accused of plotting a coup with a group of Pakistani army officers, after 4 years on death row, was released in 1955 after worldwide pressure from such stars as Paul Robeson. In 1962 he was awarded the Lenin peace prize by the Soviet Union. He went into exile in Moscow, London and Beirut, eventually returning to Pakistan.\n\nMuch of his poetry follows the conventions of Ghazal, the classical form of traditional Urdu poetry, which has been influenced by Persian literature. But Faiz’s work revolutionises the conventions, extending the meanings of many traditional terms. For instance, fairs of an addresses poems to his “Beloved” Central word in the ghazal vocabulary. In his hands, it refers to both a person and also to the people as a whole, even to Revolution. He sees the individual as existing within a wider context; “The self of a human being, despite all its loves, troubles, Joys and pains, is a limited and humble thing.” Faiz belonged to the Progressive Movement, a collective of writers and poets who, in the decade leading up to the 1947 independence of India and Pakistan, embodied a revolutionary aesthetic. This group of writers and thinkers believed suffering could be done away with through action. What’s more, their community couldn’t disentangle art from responsibility. Each line they wrote was an active commitment to the issues of the time and also an attempt to empower their audiences. Art took on an activist sentiment; readers implicated in the progressives’ writing couldn’t look on silently as spectators to injustice. Faiz spent four long years in different jails of Pakistan. But this. period proved very fruitful to his literary career because he. produced some of the great poetry during incarceration, he. himself has called this period as “second adolescence” or “another adolescence”. He wrote Dast-e-Saba (Hand of the Wind) and Zidan Nama (Prison Narrative) , the most famous collection of prison poetry in world literature. Faiz is regarded as the iconic voice of Pakistan and the world as well. Most of the time he was kept in solitary confinement where he was even deprived of reading and writing material and was not allowed meeting anyone. Faiz started writing poetry on the. prison walls with burned coal. His poetry expresses the struggle. against all kinds of tyranny. Both Prison Narrative and Hand of. the Wind are fully packed with a genuine sense of optimism and. brave confidence. He was of the view to never bow against the oppression and not to surrender your will and to speak the truth to the world as he did in his poetry. The aesthetic, imagination and hope for better dawn to come are always seen in his poetry. His poetry shows sympathy not only for Pakistan but for the whole world. Being a through Marxist he has a love for the common masses and the people who are suffering under the oppressive regimes of the government. His poetry is a testimony to the fact that the tyranny won’t last long and the day of freedom will come soon where everyone will be freed from the clutches of oppression. His first collection of prison poems titled Daste Saba (Hand of the Wind) was published in 1952; the collection is about the impact of imprisonment on his life. The poems are packed with rebelliousness, remembrance, longings, loneliness, and despair. His poems are not only for subjugation of his own county but against other rulers of the world who are very oppressive to common masses .\n\nFaiz’s works and underlying symbolism:\n\nFaiz was a “committed” poet who regarded poetry as a vehicle of serious thought, and not a mere pleasurable pastime. Faiz was honored by Soviet Russia with the prestigious Lenin Award for Peace and his poems have been translated into the Russian language. His poetical collections include Naqsh-e-Faryadi (1943), Dast-e-Saba (1952), Zindan-Nama (1956) and Dast-e-Tah-e-Sang (1965).\n\nAs a poet, Faiz began writing on the conventional themes of love and beauty, but soon these conventional themes got submerged in the larger social and political issues of the day. The traditional grieves of love get fused with the travails of the afflicted humanity, and Faiz uses his poetry to champion the cause of socialistic humanism. Consequently, the familiar imagery of a love-poet acquires new meanings in the hands of Faiz. This turning away from romance to realism, from Eros to Agape, is beautifully suggested in his poem (a nazm), “mujh se pehli si mohabbat meri mahboob na maang”,”Do Not Ask”. Faiz was a poet of humanity so there is not a single theme in his poetry but his poetry encompasses all the human emotions, he shared it with all classes of readers. There we find unique expressions of feelings, sentiments and sensations in Faiz’s poetry.\n\n“Of the long days when I knew you could not come,\n\nDon’t ask if I thought of you or missed you very much.\n\nYour memory alone fills the wellspring of my mind\n\nBut it is not the same as your lips, your arms, and your touch.”\n\nEven here, the imprisoned lover instructs his beloved not to ask of his longing, because – he implies – he refuses to long for her on the days when he knows that she is impossibly separated from him, and thinking of her only reminds him of his forced isolation. Also , the themes of isolation , patriotism, optimistic. etc are clearly understood,\n\nAdding to this ,\n\n“Maqam, Faiz, koi raah mein jacha hi nahi/Jo kuu-e-yaar se nikle to suye-e-daar chale\n\n(No other stage on the way was suitable, Faiz/Emerging from the street of the beloved, I climbed the scaffold)”.\n\nThe couplet showcases both passionate motifs – romance and revolution – that can be found in Faiz Ahmed Faiz’s poetry but there is much more too. Like , Another example includes ,\n\n“ Bol, ke lab azaad hai tere:\n\nBol, zabaan ab tak teri hai,\n\nTera sutwan jism hai tera –\n\nBol, ke jaan ab tak teri hai. “\n\nThese words by Faiz resemble pain , agony and revolution.\n\nOne of the most famous nazm of Faiz , Hum dekhenge ( we shall see ) : Inevitably, we shall also see the day\n\nthat was promised to us, decreed\n\non the tablet of eternity……..\n\nThis nazm employs the metaphor of traditional Islamic imagery to subvert and challenge fundamentalist interpretation of them; Qayamat, the Day of Reckoning is transformed into the Day of Revolution, wherein. military government would be ousted by the people and democracy will be re-installed.\n\nRelevance of Prison poetry of Faiz Ahmed Faiz , with reference to ‘For your lanes, my country’ (Nis̲ār main̲ terī galiyon̲ pih) in Partition Literature:\n\nLiterature is the most constructive representation of society. Literature has played a significant role in bringing the changes in society: the clements of revolution in literature and especially in poetry have played a vital part in society. Literature deals with so many diverse records. Poetry is regarded as the most beloved genres of literature dealing with diverse dimensions and vicissitudes of society. There are a number of poets who had filled the spirit across the world with their poetic genius, Pablo Neruda from Africa ,Seamus Heaney from Ireland, Ahmeo Fouad Negm from Egypt, and Agha Shahid from India, and several other poets writing in different languages of the world had remained active in presenting the bursa realities of their society. But Faiz Ahmad Faiz occupies a unique place in the world of revolutionary poets. The name Faiz itself is synonymous with protest, struggle, freedom, and revolution. hope, ete. His art is not just for amusement, there are certain realities, and above all the social realities that make the way for social progress.\n\nAccording to Faiz , Prison itself was, nevertheless, a fundamental experience in which a new window of thought and vision opens itself. Prison was. like another adolescence when all the sensation became sharp and one experienced once again that same original astonishment at feeling the dawn breeze, at seeing the shadow of evening, the blue of the sky, the feeling of the passing breeze.” Thus all the humiliation, suffering, hardships and turmoil prison brought to his life; Faiz faced all this with confidence and optimism and used this incarceration to produce many of the best. prison poetry. Faiz is regarded as the greatest revolutionary poet struggling against all odds and difficulties but moving ahead. courageously towards the heroic dreams of freedom to realize. In prison, his poems had been smuggled out or sent out with his. letters and circulated widely. Faiz’s poetry has long reflected a syncretic spirit, both across place and across time. It found a place among many local cultural traditions and also beyond. He not only navigated the space between Hindu and Muslim, but was also deeply influenced by British poets like W.H. Auden. Faiz’s poetry merged styles across centuries, weaving together classical forms like the 14th-century ghazal (notably drawing from Punjabi poetic ideals like loss and longing, as well as from Sufi philosophy) with 20th-century forms like free verse that the British had been importing into the subcontinent since the Raj took hold of it a century earlier.\n\nWith the help of the poem, For your lanes my country , Faiz wants to convey his love,devotion and respect for his nation but also points toward the. flows of today’s society. He believes his nation’s streets to be sacred and in his poem he salutes it. He. also explains his nation as a place where there is a ritual that no one shall walk with his head high and the devotee should go to the pilgrims with their eyes lowered and body crouched in fear. He doesn’t understand the logic beside humans being prisoned inside brick and stone sculptures while stray dogs are free to roam everywhere. Here, he compares the life of humans with a dog where humans are restricted with rules and customs whereas dogs are breathing freely. He doesn’t understand today’s society’s rules. He says those few standing up with power to speak and bring changes are the same person who give protection as well as prosecute and judge. He is confused to whom shall he expect protection and from whom shall he expect judgements. Although this doesn’t affect the people who know how to be happy by living their memories day and night. He also explains. the beauty of his nation by comparing the stars with sparkle in the hairs. He says when the windows of the same prisons made up of bricks and stones where humans are bound to live become dark that is when sun sets and moon rises stars in the sky look like they are beautifully crafted in his nation’s hairs and he also explain the beauty of sun rise by saying that he know when the prison’s windows will be lighted again he could see his nation’s face bathed in dawn. And then he said that he lives in the memories of beautiful days and nights while being imprisoned in the walls made of bricks and stones. This is how people fight oppression by their memories. The rituals are not new neither is poet’s ways .\n\nOn critically examIning the works of Faiz , we find that the social relevance of his poetry is even today.Faiz heard the voice calling to him from the other world as in the words of V. G Kiernan ‘the voice heard by Faiz was that ofKarl Marx.’ He thought poetry must be a servant of the cause, a beacon to the ‘poor humanity’s afflicted will’ not a mere display of oriental skill. Faiz has written poetry in different phases/chapters of his life, like his early poetry,before his association with Progressive writers association, after the influence ofMarxism, pre-prison poetry, in-prison poetry, post-prison poetry, or poetry written in exile. Yet his prison lyrics are among his best. Faiz himself accepted that ‘going to jail was like falling in love again’. Albeit, he was known as a poet before incarceration, but prison made him cross the line of fear, and begin to say openly what he believes. It was behind the impregnable fortress-like wall, that he achieved inner freedom in which there seemed no discord in what you think and what you say and do. And indeed, it was in prison that he gained the level of moral clarity and courage that was impossible to achieve in any other situation. Faiz’s departure from that of his predecessors was that he shifted the traditional metaphors of poetry keeping the taste intact. Faiz‘s poetry is deeply rooted in its antecedents of Persian-Arabic, English, Panjabi and Urdu traditions. The distinctive feature of Faiz’s poetry is that he presents his argument or any idea of revolution not in a direct voice, which is often the mark of resistance poetry, but he used the metaphors, and images of an ongoing tradition of Urdu and Persian and made them relevant to the immediate context. For example, beloved/Mahboob becomes thelong-pending freedom, longing/visal is seen as the long struggle for freedom and if i quote other examples like morning/dawn becomes the symbol of both union and freedom of people; night\\shaam is seen as the reflection of darkness not only of unrequited love but ignorance of people. So we can see Faiz at its core is a broken lover\\majnoon and struggle for union with Laila is transposed from personal ambition to the collective dream of oppressed people, and the light/roshni which will break through the darkness/anadera. Thus, poetry and politics become one with the same weapon of form and content recurrent in romantic as well as the poetry of witness. Injustice, inequality are key issues Faiz dealt with in his poems. His poetry inspires the society to combat capitalism, and fight against the oppressive ruling class. For Faiz, he is the poet who nurtures the ideology of revolution in people’s minds and inspires the urge to fight and culminates in external actions. Moreover, for him to promote the revolution it is the moral duty of every individual.His translations by great scholars like Naomi Lazard, V G Kiernan, Agha Shahid Ali,and Shiv K Kumar offers substantial material for English loving readers that how his poetry sounds and appeals. These translators loved him and wanted to take his poetry to the English world. Naomi Lazard’s bilingual translation The True Subject,V G Kiernan’s Poems by Faiz, Agha Shahid Ali’s translation The Rebel’s. silhouette and Shiv K Kumar’s The best of Faiz are remarkable examples of passionate engagement with Faiz Ahmad Faiz. These translations have made enough potential to cherish the tablet and penI will go on writing down what passes over the heart,I will go on collecting the attributes of the grief of love,I will go on pouring bounty on the desolation of the age. Moreover, Faiz’s work responded to contemporary moments of crisis and made his poetry distinctively critical in two ways. His verses both challenged structures of power and the failure of governments to heed the concerns of the downtrodden, and they reflected a new direction for poetry itself – a revolutionary one. Most importantly, Faiz adopted and adapted the forms, images, and themes of Urdu poetry to criticize and galvanize readers against the oppressive political regimes threatening the subcontinent while the British were drawing their line in the sand and splitting the land apart.Conclusively we can say that Faiz is one of the most celebrated, revolutionary, witnesses and. the protest poet of the twentieth century, He had a deep sense of. love and compassion for his people and country, and he is the poet who speaks for the lonely and oppressed. Being a through. Marxist there is universality in his poetry. In fact, he is a voice. for the voiceless. The world will remember and miss him always. His prison poetry has acclaimed much recognition in the entire world, reading his prison poetry gives strength and power to. stand up against all the odds of life and to change these. adversities into prosperities.\n\nHence. There are no qualms, in stating that Faiz Ahmad Faiz is the voice of the revolution, one of the greatest and renowned Urdu poets of the subcontinent in the twentieth century. He is often credited as the poet of protest, resistance and the iconic voice. He felt the pain of his people, was several times incarcerated for his ideological beliefs and open criticism to the government, but even the prison couldn’t seize his imagination, aesthetics and commitment. Faiz used his lyrics as a powerful tool in the articulation of anger, inequality,and also for peace and love. The cultural expression of resistance, in fact, has been a refrain in his poetry. Reading Faiz’s poetry is to address a void that has come to be linked to the understanding of cultural protest, of raising a concern,being angry or anxious, but having a better hope for tomorrow. As Faiz became aware of the colonial game and exploitation, so political and resistance tones played a major role in his lyrics. Faiz is the voice to the voiceless and marginalized sections of society. it is the poet who prompts the ideology of revolution in people’s mind and inspires the urge to fight and culminates the external actions. Moreover, for him to promote the revolution it is the moral duty of every individual. His poetry has a virile voice and message that deserves to be heard in the complex socio- political scenario of the modern world. His translations by great scholars like Naomi Lazard, Agha Shahid Ali,and Shiv K Kumar Offers substantial material for English loving readers that show his poetry’s sounds and appeals. These translators loved him and wanted to transcend his poetry to the English world. NaomiLazard’s bilingual translationThe True Subject, V. G. Kierna Poems by Faiz , and Agha Shahid Ali’s translation The Rebel’s Silhouette are remarkable examples of passionate engagement with Faiz Ahmad Faiz. His latest translation of Baran Farooqi The Colours of My Heart. makes it clear how his poetry remains relevant in every age and for society’s prosperity. These translations had made enough potential to attract English Readership for his socio-political poetic oeuvre. To conclude, Faiz conforms to the hallmarks of good writing as set by Nietzsche:\n\n“Of all that is written , only what a person hath written with his blood.\n\nWrite with blood, and thou wilt finds that blood is spirit. “"
