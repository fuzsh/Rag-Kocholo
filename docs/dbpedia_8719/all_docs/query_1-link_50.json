        "text": "PROGRESSIVE WRITERSâ MOVEMENT\n\nIN\n\nURDU LITERATURE\n\nA\n\nLECTURE\n\nDELIVERED\n\nBY\n\nJAVED AKHTAR\n\nTRANSLATED\n\nBY\n\nHUMAYUN ZAFAR ZAIDI\n\nThe Progressive Writersâ Association â as soon as one hears these four words, oneâs mental horizon is illumined with a myriad of stars â Faiz, Majaz, Krishan Chander, Sardar Jafri, Ismat Chughtai, Sahir, Kaifi, Jan Nasar, Ahktar, Rajender Singh Bedi, Majrooh, there are innumerable names which shine like a galaxy and leave us wonderstuck.\n\nâThere was a time when all lived togetherâ!\n\nOh what memories come flooding - the fading evening light through the small chink in the prison cell, the beautiful caressing hand of the moonlight on the lonely terrace, the abject poverty of a youth, the ravishing beauty of a widow, the pain writ large on the face of Kalu, the scavenger, the haphazard life of Shamman inching ahead in a crooked line, the Punjab in flames, wounds and scars on the fair and flowery body of Kashmir, a girl squatting all alone in the untiled courtyard of her motley abode staring longingly at her wedding dress whose fate has been sealed forever thanks to the politics of partition, homeless and destitute shoeshine boys and newspaper hawkers, slogan shouting revolutionaries banging their head against the walls of stone ; the bodies of martyrs burning like wax, someone beholding the Taj from a unique perspective ; someone embarks on a journey all alone, soon to find himself to be part of a caravan.\n\nWe need to ponder over this movement- who were the people associated with it? What did they set out to do? What could they achieve? To what extent were they successful, if they failed what were the reasons for it? We have to ponder.\n\nWe are told that the publication of âAngarayâ and later the meeting of a few forward looking young writers in a London restaurant could be seen as the starting point of the movement. I feel nothing gets started unless there are conditions for it to happen. If we wish to comprehend the genesis of its tone and temper, we will have to turn pages of history and identify conditions and circumstances that brought about the birth of the movement. On the one hand, we will have to look carefully at the impact of the British stranglehold on India and on the other, the changing economic system in Europe and how it was affecting the world.\n\nIn England, as a result of the Industrial revolution, the feudal system was loosing its grip. Capitalism had become the new order of the day; new changes were coming about in the equations between capitalism, production and labour. Though the basis of the erstwhile feudal system rested on exploitation, in the new Industrial society as well, exploitation touched a new nadir.\n\nNovel and innovative ways of exploitation were employed. The feudal system despite its attendant evils was still a system in which the peasants and farmers were responsible for production and thus however tenuous, a relationship existed. The industrial system brought this affinity to an end. In the feudal system whose mainstay was agriculture there were only two classes of people â the landowner and the peasant. Exploitation was simple and direct. But the capitalist society in order to run its economic exploitative enterprise needed some literate and educated people as well. Consequently between the capitalist and the workers a new class of people emerged - the educated middle class. Thatâs another matter that in days to come it was the same middle class from whose ranks there arose people who espoused the cause of the worker. But this happened much later!\n\nAt the beginning of the industrial era, there were no laws to safeguard the interest of the workers, and the capitalists were dead against enacting any. A worker would work upto 18 hours a day and was paid a paltry amount that could only help him survive and the 6 hour break was given so that he could work for another 18 hours!.\n\nObviously there was no question of pension or any other kind of fund, no off days and on top of it this blatant exploitation was being justified phisophically! Adam Smith ( 1723 â 1790) has argued in his world famous book âthe wealth of nationsâ that the economic matters be absolutely delinked from political. He thought that it would be best if business and other economic activity were free of political interference.\n\nAnother economics expert, David Ricardo ( 1772- 1823) put forth the view that a capitalist should have the freedom to produce only those goods for which he had sufficient resources and labour. This way production would cost less. The capitalist should also be free to sell his goods to any country without any let or hindrance. Ricardo favoured open markets throughout the world. Todayâs globalization seems akin to his view! Herbert Spencer , another economic thinker was totally against state interference in business. He has vehemently opposed all such laws, which sought to protect the right of the worker.\n\nThus not only labour was being exploited unashamedly but all such exploitative measures were being defended with unabashed vigour. Such a situation was bound to have repercussions. When a booklet first made its appearance in 1848, little did anyone realize that it was destined to have far reaching impact on all spheres of human life and civilization and that each and every nation of the world would either accept it or reject it but there would be no escape from being affected by it. Who could imagine that the words of this booklet would echo for centuries to come. This was the c\n\nCommunist Manifesto!\n\nSome ninety years later a young Urdu poet who used to write romantic verse read the same communist manifesto. This is what his reaction was in a letter,\n\nâOne day Sahabzada Mahmuduzzafar gave me a thin booklet and asked me to go through it and advised caution since it was declared unlawful. It was the communist manifesto and I read it in a single sitting. I felt as if someone had given me the key to the treasure trove of mystery. Thatâs how my interest in Socialism and Marxism was initiated. Then I read Leninâs works. Later I read books about the Soviet society by revolutionary writers. About that time the Indian Progressive Writers Association came into beingâ.\n\nThe incident Faiz Ahmed Faiz has referred to in his letter took place in 1935. Post World War I, the long shadow of fascism in Italy and Nazism in Germany could be clearly discerned. In the last phase of the war the Bolshevik Revolution had already taken place. There can be opposing points of view about it being inherently fraught with contradiction but the fact that the Russian revolution gave a new courage to the helpless laborers caught in the stranglehold of capitalism. It gave them a new daring to dream about a better life free from all shackles, which enslaved them. The PWA was an offshoot of such noble and lofty ideals.\n\nLadies and gentlemenâ. Understanding this International background of the PWA is all important but we need to put it in perspective and view it in the context of the historical, social, political and economic conditions of our own country.\n\nBecause of the British hold on India, the countryâs intellectuals and reformers adopted two differing, albeit, opposite viewpoints. One view, whose proponent were the likes of Raja Ram Mohan Roy, Jyoti Baphule and later reformers, was that English education is all too essential and hence they advocated it with fervour. One thing we should be clear about at this point is that Raja Ram Mohan Roy stressed the importance of English at a time when our rulers had not even thought about it. Lord Macaulay âs Minutes of Education appeared full two years after Raja Ram Mohan Royâs passing away. There was a world of difference between the two. While Raja Ram Mohan Royâs espousal of English education was for the propagation of a scientific and objective temperament and eradication of religious superstition and other social evils, Macaulay through English education desired to create a middle class which could become part of the ruling administrative machinery.\n\nThe other school of thought comprised orthodoxy. They opposed Raja Ram Mohan Roy tooth and nail. On a close appraisal it seems that they neither despised the British nor the English language but were bitterly opposed to the reform that Raja Ram Mohan Roy was endeavoring to introduce.\n\nRaja Ram Mohan Roy had pleaded for Modern English education in the early part of the 19th century. On the other hand Muslims didnât spare a thought for it till 1857. It was only after 1857 that Sir Syed and his friends initiated the Aligarh movement. In turn, they met with stiff resistance from Muslim revisionists who drew inspiration from the Wahabi Movement.\n\nSir Syedâs movement also had its share of opponents. Contemporaries like the satirist Akbar Allahabadi made him the butt of jokes in many of his verses:\n\nKya janiye Saiyyed the khudagah kahan tak\n\nSamjhe na key sidhi hai meri rah kahan tak\n\n(Who knows how far Sir Syed saw the truth?\n\nThe end of his straight road was out of sight)\n\nAkbar wrote a famous quatrain for his son Ishrati:\n\nIshrati Ghar ki Mohabbat ka maza bhool gaye,\n\nKha key London ki hawa e-ahde wafa bhool gaye\n\nPahonche hotel mein to phir Id ki parwa na rahi\n\nCake ko chakh ke siwayyon ka maza bhool gaye\n\n(Ishrati forgot all the joys of home and family love.\n\nOnce in London he broke all his promises and vows.\n\nHis new taste for cake and restaurants of London\n\nMade him forget the festival of Eid and the home-made vermicelliâ)\n\nI would like to pose a question here which I failed to answer you too give it a thought. Akbar, who had so many suspicions and doubts about western education and in fact worked down upon it, here was his son enjoying and having a pleasurable time in London devouring cake and developing a taste for the traditional homemade vermicelli? Why did Akbar allow his son to go to the West? This kind of dichotomy in attitude is not confined to Akbar alone. Even today, in our country the flag bearers of Hindi, who denounce English in the strongest terms and consider it to be the last symbol of enslavement, send their own children to English medium schools and later to the US, UK and Australia. Even those who are not willing to effect any changes in the syllabi of madrasas, their children study not in madrasas but other main line schools. I beg your pardon for this digression, letsâ now go back to the Aligarh Movement.\n\nApart from arousing consciousness for education, Sir Syed and his dedicated band of followers, also initiated the process of a rethink on certain Islamic principles. The writings of people like Sir Syed, Mohsin-ul Mulk and Chiragh Ali contain a liberal and scientific interpretation of Islamic beliefs. However, the Aligarh Movement did not meet with any success on this front, but it did manage to create a mindset among upper and middle classes which later on proved to be congenial for progressive thinking and ideas.\n\nHali is also a part of Sir Syedâs band. His Preface to Poetry is a document of great importance. Some of his arguments did not find favour with some people but the historical significance of this treatise cannot be denied; Hali has talked about Urdu poetry and the need for reform in it particularly in Ghazal. He was sternly against hackneyed and oft repeated cliches in the classical Urdu ghazal- the candle and the moth; the flower and the nightingale; the cup and the goblet, the lover and the beloved. He advocated the need for purpose and social value norms in literature. This way Hali and his close associate Mohd Husain Azad can be termed as the precursors of the progressive Movement. The duo had settled in Lahore after 1857 and there they organized Mushairas not on a give verse or metre but on a specific subject on which the poet had to compose poems. The first of these symposia was held in 1874. Thus subjects, diction, imagery and idioms enriched Urdu verse. The poet was enabled to look beyond his own personal longings and desires.\n\nSo that there is no misunderstanding on this score, too things need to be clearly stated. Hali and Azad may be considered to be precursors of the PWM but were in no way its founders. We will dwell upon the marked difference between form and temper of the Natural poetry of Hali and Azad and that of the PWM. Secondly the social concerns voiced by Hali and Azad were not new to Urdu poetry. Each and every significant poet from Qul Qutub Shah to Ghalib has written about the social conditions of his time. In fact, there is a form in Urdu poetry Shaher Aashoob in which contemporary issues of social concern were versified. Most classical poets have written Aashoob, but Nazeer and Sauda earned unparalleled fame. One of Saudaâs pentagons runs thus:\n\nKharab hain wo imaraat kiya kahon khuch tujh paas\n\nKi jin key dekhe se jati rahi bhook aur piyaas\n\nAur ab jo dekho to dil hoi zindigi se udaas\n\nBajaye gul chamano mein kamar kamar hai ghaas\n\nKahi sutoon para hai kahin marghol\n\n(How shall I tell you of the miserable plight of those buildings, the very sight of which made the famishing person forget his hunger and thirst! You look at them now and feel sick at heart to see the grasses growing waist high in what was once a garden full of flowers. Here lies a broken column and there an arch.)\n\nNazeer Akbarabadi has also left behind many such verses which are replete with issues that were adversely affecting society:\n\nMarey hain hat hat pe sab yahan ke dastkar\n\nAur jitne peshadar hain rotey hain zar zar\n\nKootey hai tan lohar to peetey hai sar sunar\n\nKhuch ek do key kam ka rona nahi hai yar\n\nChattees peshey walon ka hai karobar band\n\n(All the craftsmen are sitting idle\n\nand all artisans are in tears\n\nboth the ironsmith and the goldsmith weep inconsolably\n\nits not a problem affecting one or two\n\nthe business of thirty six professionals is at a standstill)\n\nApart from satires, Urdu poetry is replete with peoms on social occasions, celebrations and festivals like holi, diwali and basant. Breadth of vision and the feeling of national oneness have been the hallmarks of Urdu. Even classical poetry has not remained unaffected by political developments.\n\nMir Taqi Mir cried over the dethronement and blinding of Ahmad Shah thus:\n\nShahan ko kohle jawhar thi khake pa unki\n\nUnhin ki aakhon mein phirti salayan dekhin\n\n(Yes, Monarch were they\n\nYes, dust under their feet was valued more than the powdered pearls\n\nYes, I have been a witness\n\nTheir glittering eyes being pierced with needle)\n\nDil ki barbadi ki es had hai kharabi ke na pooch\n\nJana Jata hai es rah sey lashkar guzra\n\n(Oh how brutally the domain of heart has been devastated\n\nit seems it was trampled by a marching army.)\n\nThe above two couplets graphically describe the plunder death and destruction unleashed upon Delhi by Nadir Shah. Another couplet by Ghalib is in the background of 1857:\n\nQado geesu mein qais o kokan ki aazmaaish hai\n\nJehan hum hain wahan daro rasan ki aazmaaish\n\n(Qais the lover and Farhad the stone cutter\n\nare competing with one another to excel in statore and style\n\nbut the arena we are in the contest is for the gallose and the noose)\n\nMany progressive poets like Majroh and Jafri have also echoed these thoughts express by Ghalib who said:\n\nLikhtey rahay junoon ki hikayate khoon chakan\n\nHar chand es mein haath hamarey qalam huai\n\n(What if our hands were chopped off\n\nnothing could stop us from writing tales of frenzy)\n\nFaiz when faced with imprisonment where there was restriction on free expression,boldly declared:\n\nMatae Lauho qalalam chin gayee to kya gham hai\n\nKi khoon-e dil mein dubolin hain ugliyan maine\n\nZaban pe mohr lagi hai to kya ki rakhdi hai\n\nHar ek halqa-e zanjeer mein zaban maine\n\n(If ink and pen are snatched from me shall I\n\nWho have dipped my finger in my heartâs blood complain-\n\nOr if they seal my tongue,when I have made\n\nA mouth of every round link of my chain)\n\nA moot question can be raised that if tradition of poetry has been handed down from generation to generation why should only the Progressive Movement be given the credit of binding literature to society and why should not Haliâs Natural poetry? To answer this question satisfactorily, the difference between the two movements needs to be understood. One, Hali and Azad though their literary movement sought to create educational and social consciousness and their writing had a sense of purpose and reform, it never included political awakening in its agenda. It did not challenge he rulers while the Progressive Movement opposed British imperialism openly. Its protagonists even suffered incarceration for their daring.\n\nTwo, Hali and Azadâs movement addressed those among the uppar and middle classes which farmed the elite. There was nothing in this movement for the ordinary folks, the barber, the baker, the Tonga wallah, the farmer, peasants and the ordinary labour classes. On the contrary in the Progressive Movement the problems and issues affecting the poor, backward, downtrodden became subjects to write about.\n\nThree, Hali and Azadâs movement did tell the women folk that they were the source of pride to the world but did not tell the world how to treat and respect mothers, sisters and daughters and give them their rights. Respect and pride without any rights is meaningless. The progressives on the other hand took up the issue in right earnest. Way back in 1937 progressive writers Majaz had a strong message for the women of the country:\n\nAnother young progressive writer Kaifi addressed the womenfolk thus:\n\nNabze hasti ka lahu kanptey aansu mein nahin\n\nUrney khulney mein hai nakhat khame gesu mein nahin\n\nJannat ek aur hai jo mard key pehlu main nahin\n\nUski aazad ravish par bhi machalna hai tujhe\n\nUth mere jan mere saath hi chalna hai tujhe\n\n(Lifeâs veins have blood, not trembling tears only\n\nin what opens and flies lies frangrance, not in tresses only\n\nThere is a paradise too, beyond the maleâs view point only\n\nTo its free rhythm you have to dance in ecstacy\n\nRise my love! You have to walk along with me.\n\nIn Europe and America womenâs liberal and womenâs empowerment movements came to the fore in the sixth decade of the last century largely as a result of the writings of two courageous women Germane Green and Belly Friedman, itâs a pity that the world has no knowledge of the fact that 20 years prior to this an Indian woman short story writer had been fearlessly raising these issues and had been to court many a time accused of blasphemy and obscenity but the power of her pen showed no relenting. This woman writer was Ismat Chugtai â one of the most formidable pillars of strength of the PWM.\n\nAnother striking difference between Hali and Azadâs Natural poetry movement and the PWM was that the former was never an organized initiative. Having read the Urdu translation of English poetry, Hali and Azad advised Urdu poets to write in a simple language about natural scenery and deal with social subjects with reformist zeal. This movement had a very limited following Apart from Lahore and a few poets of Delhi, it did not attract many votaries. The sphere of influence of PWM was not confined to any one language or any one nation. It was a universal movement. In India almost all the languages came under its sphere of influence . In Urdu the strength with which this movement became a force to reckon with can be gauged from the fact that in all the major centres â Delhi, Lucknow, Bombay, Lahore, Hyderabad and Aligarh almost all prominent poets and writers were influenced by it.\n\nIn the light of these facts, distinction between the Natural poetry movement and the PWM becomes amply clear.\n\nOn November 24th 1934 some young writers and intellectuals met in a Landon restaurant to ponder over document prepared by Sajjad Zaheer, the purpose being to familiarize literature of Indian languages with new subjects and him aesthetics. From among those present some became famous writers in their respective languages. Apart from Sajjad Zaheer, Jyotimur Ghosh, Mulk Raj Anand and Mohammad Deer Taser were in atendence and each one of them earned a name for themselves in their respective languages f Bengali, English and Urdu. It was decided in the meeting that a body called All India Progressive Writers Association be formed and Sajjad Zaheer was asked to give it a practical shape. By mid 1935 the manifesto of the movement was prepared and Sajjad Zaheer came back to India and discussed it with leading litterateurs. Munshi Premchand, the top most writer in Urdu and Hindi not only praised the manifesto but also published its Hindi translation in his magazine âHansâ.\n\nThe first conference of Progressive Writers Association was held in Lucknow on 13th April 1936 and this manifesto as adopted. This manifesto spelt out the social responsibility of writers in the following words â It is the duty of Indian writers to give full expression to the changes taking place in Indian life and promote scientific and radical outlook and set such critical standards that could adequately combat outdated ideas and beliefs about family, religion, sex, war and society. It is incumbent upon them to check the growth of such ideas and trends, which advocate communalism, racial prejudice and human exploitation.â\n\nMunshi Premchand had presided over this conference, and in his presidential address he had said, â literature is not a pastime, it shoed does not deal with love and romance but also addresses problems and issues of life, our body of writers does not want literature to be at the mercy of those who only talk about banal subjects of love and beauty and intoxication. Literature should become the medium to send strong messages across and use it as a tool to initiate action, it is not bothered about language with the loftiness of the ideal, and breadth of vision, language itself strives towards simplicity, the beauty of meaning can be retained without employing ostentatious and verbose expression. The writer who writes for the classes employs a style which is appreciated by the targeted readers but the ones who write for ordinary folks use a language which is easily comprehended by the massesâ.\n\nMost of Premchandâs address became the salient features of the Progressive Movement. for all time to come this address while stressing the need for literature to reflect the realities of life, also wanted the parameters of beauty to be redefined. A progressive writer besides appreciating the beauty of his beloved also shows his concern for other aspects of this fast paced and stressful life and it gives its forceful expression in his works. Premchandâs advise finds sublime poetic expression in the following poem of Faiz Ahmed Faizâ¦â¦\n\nMain ne samjha tha ke too hai to darakshan hai hayat\n\nTera gham hai to ghame dehar ka jhagra kya hai\n\nTeri soorat se hai aalam me baharon ko sabat\n\nTeri aankhon ke siwa dunya mein rakh kya hai\n\n(Once I thought:\n\nLife would be all lustre\n\nIf you were with me ,\n\nThe vexing world would not distract\n\nIf I made your grief my own\n\nYour beauty lent permanance to spring\n\nWhat did the whole world hold out for me;\n\nAll this once I thought)\n\nAfter talking about the rich attributes of the belovedâs beauty, certain other images seize the eye of the poet the dark mysterious and spells that countless centuries have cast, the bodies just being traded in the market place, it moved the poet ( mujhse pehli si muhabbat)no end and he criesâ¦â¦â¦..\n\nLot jat hai ukhar ko bhi nazar kya kahiye\n\nAb bhi dilkash hai tera husan kya kahiye\n\nAur bhi gam hain zamane mein mohabbat ke siwa\n\nRahatein aur bhi hain wasl ki rat key siwa\n\n(There are many pains other than love\n\nand many pleasure are there in the world\n\nother than the pleasure of love\n\nDark-brutal spells of countless centuries,\n\nBodies woven into brocade, satin and silk\n\nUp for sale in streets and lanes â\n\nBodies besmeared with dust and bathed in blood â\n\nBodies, as if emerging out\n\nOf flaming ovens of disease untold,\n\nPuss oozing out of festering wounds â\n\nAll these sights too catch the eye, how can I ignore?\n\nBut your beauty remains winsome still,\n\nHow can I help?\n\nSome detractors of the Progressive Movement considered it to be a movement of certain poets and writers affiliated to the Communist Party. They refused to consider it as a separate movement and dubbed it as a part of the propaganda machinery of the Communist Party- no more no less. To form such an opinion about the PWM a person should either be completely ignorant or untruthful and if fortunately heâ both then he could hold on to this misconceived notion for the rest of his life.\n\nThere is no doubt that Sajjad Zaheer and his other friends who had wanted literature to be concerned with social issues, problems and especially backward and weaker sections were affiliated to the Communist Party. Being a communist is neither a crime nor a vice but it is also free that there were many others had no connection with the Communist Party. Premchand himself was ideologically a Gandhian and his presidential address at the first conference is an immensely valuable document which gave firm direction to its aims and objectives, language and style of the Progressive Writers Association. This movement was also blessed by Rabindranath Tagore , in his message he had said , â â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦.\n\nI feel that no one can deny the fact that Tagore was much above petty political parties. Hasrat Mohani, an active Congress leader who was jailed where he underwent rigorous imprisonment was a great supporter of the movement.\n\nBesides Tagore, Premchand and Hasrat Mohini the Progressive movement found favour with countless writers and intellectuals who were not communists. Pandit Nehru, Maulvi Abdul Haq, Josh, Firaq, Aziz Ahmed, Hayatullah Ansari, Ahmed Nadeem Qasami, the Telegu poet Sri Sri , Gujrati poet Uma Shanker Joshi, Punajbi writer Gurbux Singh, Marathi literate Anna Bahu Sathe were great votaries of progressive writing though their political ideology was different. Even among the prominent progressive writers of Urdu not all were members of the Communist party. Sardar Jafri, Kaifi, and Janissar Akhtar were cardholders of the Communist Party but many others like Khawaja Ahmed Abbas, Rajender singh Bedi, Sahir Ludhanwi, Ismat Chughtai were not members of the communist party yet their involvement with the movement was as deep as any one elseâs. However, itâs a fact that in the Progressive Movement there were such people who lacked flexibility in the ideological beliefs. They natural endeavoured to make others fall in line but it did not happen.\n\nIn an assembly of Progressives a woman progressive writer during the course of her enthused address said â Our flag is red, our aims and objectives are red, our pen is red, our ink should be red, our short stories should be red, our ghazals too need to be red.â Among the audience was Majaz known for his wit and ready repartee pleaded with the lady to at least allow the use of pink. I donât know if the lady condescended or not but in the progressive movement along with red there were many lighter and thin shades of pink as well. The poetry of Naiz Haider, Faiz, Majaz, Kaifi, Janesar Akhtar, Majrooh, Makhdoum and Sahir has not bear the hallmark of a single uniform colour, each had their own peculiarity and distinctive quality. Similarly the short stories of writers like Krishen Chandra, Bedi and Ismat Chughtai were not cast in the same mould.\n\nThe problem is that if you raise the issue of minorities or womenâs rights, speak against communalism and religious frenzy or about the economic exploitation of peasants and farmers, and liberals aboures you are immediately dubbed as a communist though in actual fact you may not be one. I think my communist friends can take pride in the fact that to be a progressive you neednât be a communist but a communist has to be progressive!\n\nIt is impossible for a communist not to be progressive. Here the question can be asked as to what in reality can be the definition of progressivism. In the light of what Premchand said and what transpired in the many conferences of the PWM addressed by Krishan Chandra and many other eminent writers, it can be said that progressivism is not negating tradition altogether. Instead of being enslaved to tradition, it insists upon drawing lessons from ones own experiences. To accept change can no way be construed as insult to tradition. Progressivism consists of a radical and scientific approach to the problems of the society, to create such literature, which is useful and purposeful. Art and literature should not just give pleasure and enjoyment but they should be a means to inculcate positive values. In the name of abiding by social norms and rituals, women are still subjected to oppression and injustice. Raising your voice against such issues is progressive, to make the problems that plague the socially deprived classes the subject of literature to question the on going exploitation of labour by the capitalist is to be progressive. The question that arises is whether the work of progressive writers is an indicator of their fulfillment of the writerâs social obligations. Progressive short story writers have played an important role in disseminating progressive values. Besides Premchandâs Path-breaking stories there are innumerable stories like Ali Abbas Husainiâs âMela Ghoomniâ,Krishan ChanderâsâKalu Bhangiâand Zindagi Ke Mor Parâ,Ismat Chughtaiâs Genda,Chauthi ka Jora,and Nannhi Ki Naani,Bediâs âLajwantiâ,âApne Dukh Mujhe Dedoâ,Hayatullah AnsariâsâAakhri Koshishâ,Ghulam AbbasââAnandiâ,Balwant Singhâs âJaggaâAhmad Nadeem QasimiâsâGandasaâ,Khwaja Ahmad AbbasâAbabeelâand Tiddiâ,Upendra Nath AshkâsKakran Ka Teliâwho have fulfilled the requirements of social responsibilities asked for by PremChand and the advice proferred by Gurudev Tagore in his message to the 1936 Coference of the PWA.\n\nThe list is endless but in the interest of brevity only a few have been mentioned. These short stories are an index of the manner in which the writers have met their social responsibilities as enumerated by Pemchand in his famous address of 1936, and endorsed by Tagore in his message to the conference. Perhaps taking his cue from the two stalwarts, Krishna Chandra said in a session of the PWA:\n\nâ Its seems that our stories and poems barring few have not come down from the high pedestal. Poetry in particular has not yet outgrown feudal underpinnings. It continues to be in tune with the subdued and melancholic temper of old. It is not firmly rooted in the soil, nor does it contain the sweat and soil of the peasant (nor does it exude the sweat of the peasantâs toil). I do not find in poetry or other literary genres, the home and hearth of the poor nor the songs of the peasant, nor the workers endless travails. Our poetry does not refer to the working womanâs broken comb with wisps of hair entangled in it ; nor does it refer to Dabbo Manoharâs pet that accompanies him every morning when he sets out to plough the fields ; it does not reverberate with the sprightly and hold bold love songs which the rural women humm for their menfolk while carrying food for them across the uneven pathways. It does not allude to their clothes that smell of dung. Our literature has no reference to bathwa â it does not need to dwell upon the whiff of perfume emitted by the musk-deer nor the locks and tresses of Tataari beauties, and that is its major lacuna. I do not find the humble abodes of my country, its flora and fauna nor a familiar image that would enchant one even after a 100 years! Till such time that we do not come down to earth, and study the life lived by peasants and workers in their homes and paint its true picture with utmost sincerity and effort, till then our literature will not attain literary heights that will compel a reader in the world to conclude that Indians are the same as them. Though the task is difficult we have to accomplish itâ.\n\nKrishna Chandra alone could have alone said such things. I am convinced that there are innumerable people in India who have deeply felt the anguish of class struggle, social exploitation and inequality not as a consequence of a political leaderâs statement or an economistâs discourse or a sociologistâs thesis, but as an outcome of those progressive short stories that have shaped the readersâ social consciousness.\n\nA large number of novels and short stories and novels written by Manto,Krishan Chander,Ramanand Saagar and many other progressive writers in the aftermath of the partition of India and the riots that followed still take the imagination by storm. Ghaddar by Krishan Chander deserves special mention here. The central character Dina Nath belongs to a feudal Hindu household in a village near Lahore. His âHaveliâ is burnt down and all family members are put to death. However he manages to survive and flees to Amritsar witnessing the acts of savagery and bloodshed. The scene remains the same even there- humanity is under fire. Haunted by barbarism, death and destruction, Dina Nath ponders over the hollowness of the pride that man takes in civilization, which is like a veil torn apart by a freak event in history. laying bare the primeval forests of human instincts. Towards the end of the novel, Dina Nath stands alone in a field where a group of Muslims was massacred earlier in the day. Corpses lie all over the place. Dina Nath hears the cry of a child and detaches it from its dead mother. He embraces the child and says to himself â Dina Nath, you are not following the logic of mutual hatred between the two nations. Where do you go from here?â.\n\nNow I would like to acquaint you with the views of the opponents of progressive literature. Those of us who know a little about these opponents must have heard the name of Gopal Mittal who was the arch enemy of progressive movement. In the silver jubilee issue of his journal, TAHREEK, Anwar Sadeed of Pakistan has this to say about the progressive short story writers â These writers lost sight of their literary obligations and out of political compulsions exploited the tragedy of partition as padding material before it could become part of the human consciousness. To enhance the effect of the story, events that had not taken place were super â imposed into the story lines. I wish I could ask Anwar Sadeed whether after the barbarism of 1947 there was any need for exaggeration to create effect. Anwar Sadeed further says that progressive writers used the theme of riots consciously to highlight their objectivity but their hypocrisy and partisanship could not remain concealed.â\n\nIt is easier to see Anwar sadeedâs comments and I donât need to delve deeper into it. In a famous story by Ahmed Nadeem Qasimi entitled âParmeshwar Singh â a childless Sikhâ chances upon a Muslim child of seven or eight years during the riots. He thinks of bringing him up as a Sikh but he is jolted by his conscience and feels compelled to restore the child to its family near the border. The child crosses the border but the border Police kills Parmeshwar Singh. Reacting to this story Anwar Sadeed comments âAhmed Nadeem Qasimi in Parmeshwar Singh has tried to create the effect of objectivity but has only succeeded in falsifying true human emotions, which means that in other words, had Parmeshwar Singh killed the child or successfully changed his religion, that would have appeared natural to Anwar Sadeed. And if Ahmed Nadeem Qasimi would have Parmeshwar Singh restored the child to its parents, it would appear unbelievable to Anwar Sadeed because it was contrary to human nature. Thus it seems Anwar Sadeed has a poor opinion not only of progressive movement but also of human beings at large. I find it difficult to explain but Iâll ask my brother Dr Salman Akhtar who is psychologist. to do that for me!\n\nThe progressive movement has given poets of such eminent stature to Urdu that remains unequalled in the annals of literary history. The history of Urdu poetry would be considered incomplete without the poets like Faiz,Majaz,Jafri,Majrooh,Jan Nisar Akhtar,Makhdoom,,sahir and a host of others..\n\nFrom 1935 to 1975 poetry has given effective expression to a range of social experiences longings, desires, dissent and aspirations to successive generations. This poetry is not of luxury and indulgences. It is about the common man- peasants, factory workers whose hands are smeared with mud on their hands and sweat on their brows. This poetry is a declaration of war against upper class exploiters. It is about the fast receding night and the impending dawn.\n\nProgressive poets are generally accused of dealing with exclusive themes of an agitational nature. Sometimes political discourses have been versified to pass as poetry. Sometimes propaganda and slogan mongering have been taken recourse to, thereby stifling literary and aesthetic considerations.\n\nIâll speak the truth and nothing but the truth. It is not that all the accusations are entirely baseless. At the same time they are not wholly true. There is no doubt that barring a few most progressive poets can be faulted one way or the other. At the same time it can be asserted that most progressive writers have produced works that have become the valuable part and legacy of Urdu literature. Poetry, good and bad is a commonplace in all eras but a poet is remembered for its contribution of a lasting value â the weaker parts of his works are either ignored or forgotten or forgiven.\n\nIf Mir could say:\n\nDoor baitha Ghbar-e Mir us se\n\nIshq bin yeh adab nahin aata\n\n(Even my dust settled at a distance from her\n\nThis repect can only be borne out of intense love)\n\nThe same great poet also composed the following couplet;\n\nSuna jaata hai ai ghatiye tere majlis nashinon se\n\nKi tu daru piye raat ko milkar kaminon se\n\n( It is being said by the people whose company you keep\n\nThat you go about drinking at night with undesirable ruffians)\n\nBut we adore Mir for such couplets as:\n\nChashme khoon basta se kal raat lahoo phir tapka\n\nHum to samjhe the ki ai mir yeh azaar gaya\n\n(Last night my blood-soaked eyes oozed drops of blood yet again\n\nOh! The delusion Mir that I forever was rid of this malaise!)\n\nWill we judge Ghalibâs greatness from the following couplet:\n\nPartaw-e khor se hai shabnam ko fana ki taleem\n\nHam bhi hain ek inayat ki nazar hone tak\n\n(A mere glance of favour cast over my hapless self\n\nMight have been what the fatal rays of the sun teach the dew drops unseen)\n\nOr from the couplets written in lighter and jocular vein like\n\nDhaul dhappa us sarapa naaz ka shewa nahin\n\nHum hi kar baithe the Ghalib peshdasti ek din\n\n(She was not accustomed to fight and fisticuffs\n\nIt was me Ghalib who started it all)\n\nMajrooh is accused of composing non-poetic verses like :\n\nAmn ka jhanda is dharti p-ar kisne kaha lahrane na paye\n\nYeh bhi koi Hitler ka hai chela marle saathi jane na paye\n\n(Who stopped the flag of peace being raised on earth\n\nHe seems to be follower of Hitler get him before he escapes)\n\nLook at the profundity and sublimity of Majroohâs poetic qualities in the the following couplet:\n\nDekh zindan se pare rang-e chaman josh-bahar\n\nRaqs karna hai to paon ki zanjeer na dekh\n\n(Look beyond the prison walls what flowers have bloomed look at the exuberance and fervour of spring\n\nIf you want to dance donât pay heed to shackles that bind your feet)\n\nOr\n\nRok sakta hamen zindan-bala kya Majrooh\n\nHum to awaz hain deewar se chan jate hain\n\n(Majrooh how could I be imprisoned in a looney citadel\n\nMy cries flilter through the stony walls )\n\nSardar Jafri who is often accused of just praising and eulogizing Russia and Stalin,has also given very memorable poems to Urdu literature:\n\nSafed ata siyah chakki se raag bankar nikal raha hai\n\nSunehri chulhon mei aag ke phool khil rahe hain\n\nPatiliyan gunguna rahi hain\n\nDhuen se kale tawe bhi chingariyon ke honton se hans rahe hain\n\nDupatte aangan mein doriyon par tange hue hain\n\nAur unke aanchal se dhaani\n\nSunehri pagdandiyon ke dil par\n\nSiyah lahengon ki srkh gotein machal rahi hain\n\nYeh saadgi kis qadar hasin hai\n\n(White flour pours forth like a melody\n\nfrom hand-driven mills.\n\nFlowers of fire spring into bloom\n\nFrom golden hearths\n\nPots are singing.\n\nHot plates charred with smoke\n\nAre laughing with cinder-black lips\n\nScarves are hanging\n\nOn clothes-lines in the courtyard,\n\nAnd they are dripping dhani drops.\n\nRead hems of black skirts\n\nAre dancing on the heart\n\nOf golden bypaths.\n\nHow beautiful is this simplicity!\n\nOne can apply the strictest norms of aesthetic standards and can not but be enchanted by the following stanzas composed by Sardar.\n\nPattiyon ki palkon par\n\nOos jagmagati hai\n\nImliyon key peron par\n\nDhoop par sukhati hai\n\nMuskuratey hain tarey\n\nChand key katorey sey\n\nChandni chirakti hai\n\nJail ki fizaaon mein\n\nPhir bhi ek andhera hai\n\nJesey ret mein gir kar\n\nDoodh jasb ho jai\n\nRoshni key gallon par\n\nTirgi key nakhoon ki\n\nSekron kharashen hain\n\n(Dewdrops shine\n\nOn the eyelashes of leaves.\n\nSunlight dries its feathers\n\nOn tamarind trees\n\nThe sun laughs\n\nStars smile\n\nMoonlight spills from\n\nThe cup of the moon.\n\nThe compound of the prison\n\nIs still bathed in darkness;\n\nAs if milk is absorbed\n\nIn a vast expanse of sand.\n\nNails of darkness\n\nHave left countless scratches\n\nOn the cheeks of the light.\n\nEvery Progressive writer has contributed some poems and some pieces of verse that have made Urdu literature proud. âHam Jo Tareek Rahon Mein Mare gayeâ, Zindan Ki ek Subhâ, âtanhaiâby Faiz; âChand Taron Ka banâ and âAndhera by Makhdoomiâ âTaj Mahal and âParchaiyanâ by Sahir; âmera safaâ and âpathar ki Dewaarâ by Jafri; âKhak-e-dil and Aakhri Mulaqaatâ by Jan Nisar Akhtar, âMeena Bazaarâ and âZameenâ by Wamiq; âIbn-e-Maryamâ and âAuratâ by Kaifi; âMautâ by Jazbi and several pieces by him and Majrooh which have become aphorism and proverbs in Urdu. The words of all these poets bear a stamp of their love of human beings, their faith in the destiny of man, and the greatness of human life. I am reminded of a few couplets of Jan Nisar Akhtar which celebrate the beauty and greatness of life thus:-\n\nJeeney ki har tarah sey tamanna hasin hai\n\nHar shar key bawajood yeh duniya hasin hai\n\nDariya ki tund barh bhayanak sahi magar\n\nToofan sey khelta hua tinka hasin hai\n\nSehra ka har sukoot darata rahay to kiya\n\nJangal ko kat-ta hua rasta hasin hai\n\nDil ko hilaye lakh Ghataon ki ghan garaj\n\nMitti pey jo gira wohi qatra hasin hai\n\nRaton ki teergi hai jo purhaul gham nahin\n\nSubhon ka jhankta hoa chehra hasin hai\n\nLakhon saubaton ka agar samna bhi ho\n\nHar jehad har amal ka taqaza hasin hai\n\n(The desire to remain alive is beautiful\n\nDespite all evil this world is beautiful\n\nThe awful flow of the river may be terrifying\n\nBut the lonely straw battling with the storm is beautiful\n\nThe silence of the desert may be intimidating\n\nBut the path which cuts across the wild is beautiful\n\nThe sound and fury of dark skies may cause commotion in the heart\n\nBut the tiny drop that falls down is beautiful.\n\nNever mind if the darkness of the night is fearsome\n\nThe face of the dawn peeping through it is beautiful.\n\nEven if scores of challenges stare in the face\n\nThe will to toil and labour is beautiful.\n\nThough the shade, temper and diction of all progressive poets is distinct, they have all dedicated their works to the common cause which Faiz has so masterfully delieuated in the following poem."
