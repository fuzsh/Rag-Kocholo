        "text": "By S.Rashid Ahmed\n\ns.rashidahmed@hotmail.com\n\nFaiz Ahmad Faiz\n\nPatriotism, Partition and Pakistan,\n\nHere’s how Faiz Ahmed Faiz became a poet\n\nBy 1939, Faiz Ahmed Faiz had made a name for himself in poetic circles. By that time he was also spending his time mingling with the working class, teaching them how to read and write and also refining their political sensibilities.\n\nFaiz’s early poems had been conventional, light-hearted treatises on love and beauty, but while in Lahore he began to expand into politics, community, and the thematic interconnectedness he felt was fundamental in both life and poetry.\n\nThe struggle against poverty and the fight against the forces of capitalism gave young Faiz’s poetry a sense of direction.\n\nThe fight against political and social exploitation provided a common platform for poets who did not recognize the Hindu–Muslim divide, a divide which could have been a concern in Faiz’s poetic imagination.\n\nBut a common platform for the larger struggle for freedom and social change made communal consciousness irrelevant and superficial.\n\nThe Marxist ideology, which gave primacy to economic and social forces governing human life in history, and which regarded the struggle for emancipation through revolution an imperative of history rather than a transcendental view of time and change, served the cause of communal harmony well, leading to the rejection of parochial concerns which seemed to be fanning the fires of communalism in those times.\n\nThe Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union gave the Progressives the opportunity to express their sense of shock and dismay and protest by joining the British Indian Army.\n\nBy doing so, Faiz had joined the war against fascism, fighting the oppressors, siding with the oppressed.\n\nThen came Indian independence.\n\nHis poem Subh e Azaadi, August 1947 records the disappointment that he personally, and the communists as a party, felt with the way things ultimately turned out for the Indian subcontinent.\n\nThe Partition served a massive blow, not just too leftist ideals but also to the Progressive Writers’ Movement.\n\nWhen Gandhi was assassinated by a Hindu fanatic, Faiz expressed his sense of deep loss by actually attending Gandhi’s funeral in Delhi, despite the fact that Hindu–Muslim relations at that time were more fraught with tension than ever before in history.\n\nThe desire for freedom, to rid the country of the foreigner, was everywhere in the air.\n\nSo was, unfortunately, the feeling of “communal” conflict between the two main communities of Hindus and Muslims.\n\nLeft wing thought was making its presence felt, but it was generally side by side with the nationalist struggle and was mixed with it, not alien to it.\n\nThe Communist Party of India had been founded in 1925, but its identity was often the same as the Indian National Congress, the main political party in the country at that time.\n\nThe poem Subh e Azaadi, expresses disappointment and sorrow on two levels:\n\nThe Partition and the carnage that accompanied it, and the disappointment that the freedom that came that morning was not a freedom brought by an armed revolution by the people and was therefore incomplete.\n\nTrue to his poetic voice, Faiz expressed his meaning through metaphors which are ambiguous in their nature anyway and seemed even more ambiguous in the context\n\nIf the beginning was accusatory and melancholy, its end was some sort of a call to continue the struggle for the revolution:\n\nThings seemed to be going well for Faiz for a while until he was arrested in March 1951 in connection with the Rawalpindi Conspiracy case.\n\nHe was held in solitary confinement for three months in Sargodha and Lyallpur, where he was even deprived of writing material. It was during this period that he composed the following poem:\n\nDenied pen and paper, Faiz had to commit this verse to memory even as he composed it.\n\nThis poem exhibits a successful mingling of the classical flavour and revolutionary fervour with which Faiz infused his poetry. It was eventually published later in his collection Dast-e Saba\n\nIn 1953, Faiz was transferred to Hyderabad jail.\n\nHe was released in April 1955 on bail and acquitted in September that year.\n\nFaiz’s years in prison have been described the account to construct the image of Faiz as the great revolutionary poet, struggling against odds but moving unflinchingly towards the realization of heroic dreams.\n\nDuring the period of his imprisonment, Faiz’s poems had been ingeniously smuggled out of prison or else sent out with his letters and circulated widely.\n\nHence, by the time of his release, Faiz Ahmed Faiz had become a local celebrity, rather, a “people’s hero”, with his verses being recited in almost every household across Pakistan.\n\nFaiz Ahmed Faiz was again imprisoned during the period of Ayub Khan’s martial law in 1958.\n\nHowever, it was not easy to keep him in jail this time as many in the military regime itself had become admirers of his poetry, and he was released after five months.\n\nHe was awarded the Lenin Peace Prize in 1962. This prize, regarded as the equivalent of the Nobel Peace Prize, was widely acclaimed in the Indian subcontinent.\n\nAccording to Faiz himself, this was a humbling experience for him. I quote a major part of the latter part of his acceptance speech here.\n\nToday, when the Word is in danger at the hands of the demagogue, the traducer of the reality of loneliness and pain, when the dignity of the individual is at stake and the freedom of speech much at risk of fast becoming an obsolete concept, we need the poetry of Faiz more than ever before.\n\nFaiz Ahmed Faiz stood for the dignity of man, the holiness of pain, the constructive power of the word and the sanctity of individual belief. He will always be needed, and that is his triumph and our tragedy.\n\nThroughout his tumultuous life, Faiz continually wrote and published, becoming the best-selling modern Urdu poet in both India and Pakistan.\n\nWhile his work is written in fairly strict diction, his poems maintain a casual, conversational tone, creating tension between the elite and the common, somewhat in the tradition of Ghalib, the renowned 19th century Urdu poet.\n\nFaiz Ahmed is especially celebrated for his poems in traditional Urdu forms, such as the ghazal, and his remarkable ability to expand the conventional thematic expectations to include political and social issues.\n\nFaiz Ahmed Faiz uses romanticism to propagate revolutionary ideas. He lends voice to the down trodden people.\n\nFaiz Ahmed Faiz's poetry touches mind & brain and compels you to think. His poetry is full of agony but keeps you optimistic.\n\nIt changes away from romance to realism, beautifully defined in his poem \"Mujh se Pehli si Mohabbat meri Mehboob na maang”.\n\nHis poetical collections include Naqsh-e-Faryadi (1943), Dast-e-Saba (1952), Zindan-Nama (1956) and Dast-e-Tah-e-Sang (1965).\n\nFaiz Ahmad Faiz was born on February 13, 1911 in Kala Kader, Sialkot, & died on November 20, 1984 in Lahore, Punjab Province."
