        "text": "Today we pay tribute to a legendry Pakistani poet who combined in his poetry the themes of love, beauty and political ideas with a clear vision for a better world. Faiz Ahmed Faiz was an avant-garde poet and a progressive journalist. A legend in his life time and a paragon of sincerity,the Pakistan People Party government has declared 2011 as the year of Faiz to celebrate his centennial birthday with the hope to spread his message of hope and peace among the masses.\n\nAs a poet, Faiz started writing on the conventional themes of love and beauty, but soon submerged these conventional themes got into the larger social and political issues of the day. The traditional themes of love got fused with the travails of the afflicted humanity, and Faiz used his poetry to champion the cause of socialistic humanism – …Raat yun dil mein teri khoi hoi yaad Aeei… Consequently, the familiar imagery of a love-poet acquired new meanings in the hands of Faiz.\n\nIn the 1930s Faiz came under the influence of the leftist Progressive Movement under the leadership of late Sajjad Zaheer. After the Second World War, he turned to journalism and distinguished himself as the editor of The Pakistan Times. He was charged in the infamous Rawalpindi conspiracy case and awarded four-year imprisonment in 1951. The jail term gave him first hand experience of the harsh realities of life. Two of his books, Dast-e-Saba and Zindaa’n-Naama are the products of this period of imprisonment. Initially, Faiz’s poetry was politically motivated which includes some of his famous poems based on his prison experience. In 1962 he was awarded the Lenin Peace Prize by the Soviet Union. During his exile, he was editor of the magazine Lotus in Moscow, London and Beirut.\n\nDuring Ayub Khan’s martial law, the pathos of the poetry Faiz wrote are characterised by a lack of civil liberties and his personal experiences in jail and exile.He loved his soil and was a true patriot – Subh-i-Azadi. Faiz’s tone was full of optimism after Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto came to power in early 1970s. Bhutto appointed him as Chairman of the National Council of the Arts. Faiz conceived and authored Pakistan’s Cultural Policy. This new cultural discourse broke the hegemony of the state-imposed definition of Pakistani identity that had excluded its rich pre-Islamic cultural heritage and had marginalised its regional cultures. Before the goals of the 1972 policy were realised, Bhutto was overthrown and martyred by the military junta. General Zia’s dark rule reversed whatever policy shifts were made in the 1970s. A symbol of resistance, Faiz went into self- exile in Beirut.\n\nDuring this period, Faiz went from country to country and wrote poems which highlight his pain away from homeland. Faiz believed in a practical struggle for the things he loved… Nisar main teri galion ke ay watan… Most of his works were banned during the military dictatorship of General Zia. These included ‘Hum Dekhenge’, an anthem for liberty from tyranny, with its lines ‘Sab taaj uchale jayenge, Sab takht giraye jayenge (all crowns will be tossed , all thrones will be brought down)’. These lines are emotionally charged. In every poem, there is a message of hope and optimism, the message which we want to spread across the world. Faiz passed away in 1984 and did not live to see the full extent of the destruction of Pakistani society scripted by Gen Zia.\n\nFaiz’s humanity transcends geographical, cultural and religious boundaries. He wrote about the plight of Palestine, students of Iran and the people of Africa. In the book “Poetry East”, Carlo Coppola calls him ‘a spokesperson for the world’s voiceless and oppressed people’. In spite of his Marxist beliefs, Faiz did not burden his poems with ideological rhetoric. He fused classical traditional form of poetry with new symbols derived from the Western political ideas. Faiz Ahmed Faiz has introduced revolutionary changes in poetry with the sweetness of Urdu language.\n\nHis poetry is a beacon of light for the oppressed. It is the voice of poor people’s conscience. Faiz used the medium of poetry to create awareness among the masses about the importance of independence and individual identity for which he suffered immensely but never gave up. His poetry gives the message of patriotism and struggle. His love for humanity is free from the prejudices of race, colour or creed.\n\nFaiz’s poetry has been translated into many languages including English and Russian. The name of Faiz Ahmed Faiz is immortal in the annals of history due to his contributions to Urdu language. Legends like him are born in centuries. He will always be remembered for standing up against tyrant rulers.\n\nThe people’s government is committed that Faiz’s poetic and political legacy is reiterated and disseminated to the younger generations. Progressive and patriotic Pakistanis will continue to sing ‘Hum Dekhenge’ until they achieve civilian democratic ascendancy and a socially just redistributive economic system."
