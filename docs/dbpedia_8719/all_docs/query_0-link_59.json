        "text": "“Radical changes are taking place in Indian society…We believe that the new literature of India must deal with the basic problems of our existence to-day– the problems of hunger and poverty, social backwardness, and political subjection. All that drags us down to passivity, inaction and un-reason we reject as reactionary. All that arouses in us the critical spirit, which examines institutions and customs in the light of reason, which helps us to act, to organize ourselves, to transform, we accept as progressive.”\n\nMulk Raj Anand, On The Progressive Writers Movement\n\nThe 1947 Partition catapulted the Indian subcontinent into a bloody epoch of religious, ethnic, gender, and political violence that has been adequately chronicled in fiction and non-fiction by the likes of Salman Rushdie, Urvashi Butalia, Amrita Pritam, and Yasmin Saikia, among others. There is, however, a dearth of scholarship on the tumultuous period of cultural transformation, particularly in literary production, that followed the former colonies into their newfound independence. The aforementioned excerpt is from the 1936 manifesto of the Progressive Writers Movement, an anti-imperialist and left-wing literary movement in the Indian subcontinent that traces its origins to the publication of a notoriously scandalous anthology, Angarey (Live Coals). Angarey heralded a radical shift in North Indian literary production towards what Ahmed Ali, one of the founding members of the Progressive Writers’ Movement, called ‘critical realism.’\n\nAhmed Ali’s conception of ‘critical realism’ can be understood as a form of narrative writing that ventures beyond the accurate representation of mundane realities of everyday life that ‘literary realism’ identifies itself with to also integrate a scathing critique of said realities, thus offering the possibility of transformation at the individual and communal level. This incipient literary practice, borne out of Angarey, occupied itself with the project of self-criticism or self-reflection that propelled Indian writers to rethink the dyadic conventional model of imperial conflict; a homogenous native Indian ‘self,’ the colonized, pitched against a homogenous foreign ‘Other,’ the colonizer. Since such a model obscures the possibility of interrogating the ‘self,’ and situating it as a target of criticism along with the ‘Other,’ the ‘critical realism’ propounded by Angarey, and the Progressive Writers’ Movement subsequently, sought to introduce a literary proclivity of looking within and locating the ‘self’ as both a subject of criticism and reformation. As Priyamvada Gopal states; “If the Angarey writers had chosen their natal religious community and class as the target of critique, in the radical literature that was to follow, such acts of identification and self-criticism would take place along other axes, including gender and caste.” The writer, therefore, is compelled to take on an activist role and locate his/her literary sensibilities in service of the social transformation of a vulnerable colony traversing through a political transition, by identifying, critiquing, and potentially reforming the native subject ‘self.’ 1For more on Angarey see Ahmad, Aijaz. In Theory: Classes, Nations, Literatures. London, Verso 1992.\n\nThe evolution of radical literary writing in Urdu from a critique of the colonial ‘Other’ to a “more comprehensive, multifaceted critique of ourselves: our class structures, our familial ideologies, our management of our bodies and sexualities, our idealisms, our silences” therefore originated from the Progressive Writers’ Movement project of bringing about social reformation through literature. This teaching tool seeks to explore the evolving trajectory of Urdu literary writing following the 1947 Partition by analyzing selected articles and poems from the third issue from the year 1948 of a left-wing, revolutionary Urdu literary magazine, Savera, (Morning). The tool will illustrate how by dissecting and critiquing native perceptions of nationalist and linguistic idealisms, national culture, and literary reimagination in the immediate aftermath of the Partition, Savera partakes in the self-reflective literary production, or ‘critical realism’ popularized by Angarey and the Progressive Writers’ Movement 2For more on ‘critical realism’ and literary traditions of Progressive Writers Movement see Gopal, Priyamvada. Literary Radicalism In India: Gender, Nation, And The Transition To Independence. Routledge, 2005.\n\nA left-wing literary magazine, Savera started in 1946 and was published quarterly in Lahore, the epicenter of anticolonial organizing. Savera was published by Naya Idara Publications under the editorship of Ahmad Nadeem Qasmi, Zaheer Kashmiri, and Arif Abdul Mateen, all of whom had spearheaded the Progressive Writers Movement 3For more on the background of Savera see Usmani, Irfan, Waheed. Print Culture and Literary Radicalism in Lahore. University of Singapore, 2016. They, along with writers of similar radical and anticolonial commitments such as Syed Sibt-e-Hasan, Hajra Masroor, Khadija Mastoor, Abdullah Malik, A.A Mateen, Zaheer Kashmiri, Mumtaz Hussain were known as the ‘Savera Group,’ and through their contributions to the magazine, produced ‘critical realist’ literature that sought to reform the nascent colony-turned-states of India and Pakistan following the Partition 4For more on the literary traditions of Progressive Writers see Nazir, Sadia, Hayat, Mazhar. “Politics of Resistance in Pakistan through Progressive Poetry: A Neo-Gramscian Study”, Sir Syed Journal of Education & Social Research, 2020.\n\nWhile the pre-Partition issues of Savera sustained a liberal editorial policy, the post-Partition issues saw a pronounced shift with respect to the radical, anti-imperialist Left. Issues 3 to 11, which appeared between August 1947 and 1952, represent the most radical phase of this magazine’s editorial policy after which it mitigated its radical convictions, but nevertheless retained its identity as a liberal magazine, committed to a progressive literary and social cause. As pressures from the establishment mounted, it was forced to adopt a moderate editorial policy. In 1948, it was among the progressive magazines banned under the Public Safety Act for six months. Upon resuming publication, it continued to be regulated by Pakistan’s stringent censorship laws 3For more on the background of Savera see Usmani, Irfan, Waheed. Print Culture and Literary Radicalism in Lahore. University of Singapore, 2016.\n\nThe main editors of Issue 3 of 1948, being analyzed in this tool, were Ahmad Nadeem Qasmi, Nazir Chaudhry, and Sahir Ludhianwi. Radical Urdu writers like Saadat Hassan Manto, Ismat Chugtai, and Faiz Ahmed Faiz were some of the most notable contributors of this issue who sought to consolidate the emergent literary tradition of reformative ‘self-criticism.’ In doing so, they catapulted to the forefront the ‘revolutionary’ or ‘activist’ role of the literary writer who was no more supposed to produce literature merely for art’s sake. Rather, according to the Progressive Writers’ Movement, the writer was to assume the moral responsibility of creating literature that had the potential to transform a colony across the axes of caste, gender, class, race, ethnicity, and language.\n\nNote: All translations from Urdu to English in this tool are done by the authors unless otherwise stated.\n\nAll scans of the Savera magazine used in the creation and compilation of this tool have been obtained from the online Urdu archives of ‘Rekhta.’\n\nEik Tawaif ka Khat (A Letter from a Prostitute): Reconstituting the Politics of Gender and Nationalism\n\nThis sentence serves as a disclaimer for the triggering content of the story ahead.\n\nBelow are selected excerpts from the story translated in English:\n\nTo Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru and Quaid-e-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah,\n\nI am sure you haven’t received a letter from a prostitute before. I am sure you haven’t even seen the faces of women like me before either. I also know how reprehensible you will find my writing a letter to you. And that too such an open letter. But what can I do? The circumstances are such. And the demand of these two girls is so crucial that I cannot live without writing this letter. I am not writing this letter. Bella and Batool are making me write this letter. So excuse a fallen woman for having the audacity to write a letter to you…\n\nYou might be thinking that Bela and Batool are my daughters. That is not true. I don’t have a daughter. I have bought these two girls from the market in the days when the Hindu-Muslim rioting was in full swing, and human blood was flowing like water on Grant Road and Faris Road and Madanpura. In those days, I had bought Bela from a Muslim pimp for three hundred rupees. The Muslim pimp had brought the girl from Delhi, where another Muslim pimp had brought her from Rawalpindi, where Bela’s parents lived. It was a middle class family; nobility and simplicity were their hallmarks. Bela was the only daughter of her father. And when the Muslims in Rawalpindi started slaughtering the Hindus, Bela was studying in the fourth grade. This is the story of 12 July. Bela was returning home after studying in her school. She saw a mob in front of her house and the houses of other Hindus. These people were armed and were lighting houses on fire. They were driving children and women out of homes and murdering them, while chanting the slogan ‘Allah is Great.’\n\nBela saw her father being killed before her own eyes. Then she saw her mother dying before her own eyes. The barbaric Muslims had cut off her breasts and thrown them away. The breasts from which a mother, any mother, a Hindu or Muslim mother, a Christian mother, or a Jewish mother, breastfeeds her child. And it opens a new door in the creation of the vastness of the universe. Those milky breasts were cut off with chants of ‘Allah is Great.’ Bela is with me now…She is not more than twelve years old, but she seems very old…The bitterness of humanity that is in her eyes, the thirst for death in them; Mr. Quaid-e-Azam, maybe if you could see it you would know of its intensity…\n\nBela and Batool are not sisters; Batool is a Muslim girl, whereas Bela is from a Hindu family. Today, both are rotting in a whorehouse at Faris Road. While Bela came from Rawalpindi, Batool is the daughter of a Pathan from Jalandhar. Batool’s father had seven daughters; five married and two maidens…Batool is only eleven years old. A Hindu pimp brought her to me. I bought her for five hundred rupees. This Hindu pimp had bought her from a Jat pimp in Ludhiana. Where was she before that? I do not know. But the Lady Doctor told me enough to drive you mad if you listen to it. Batool herself is also semi-mad now. Her father was killed by the Jats with such brutality that the skins of the last six thousand years of Hindu culture have come off. First, they gouged his eyes out. Then they urinated in his mouth. Then they ripped his throat and took out his intestines. And then they raped his married daughters. In front of their father’s dismembered body, Rehana, Gul, Derakhshan, Marjana, Susan Begum one by one, the savage men desecrated their bodies…\n\nPandit Nehru, I want you to make Batool your daughter. Mr. Jinnah, I want you to adopt Bela as your daughter. Just once free them from the clutches of Faris Road and keep them in your house. And listen to the lamentation of these millions of souls. This lamentation which is echoing from Akhali to Rawalpindi and from Bharatpur to Bombay. Is this voice not heard only in the Government House? You will hear this voice!\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nA prostitute from Faris Road"
