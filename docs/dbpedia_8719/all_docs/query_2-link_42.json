The poet conveys his deep solitude and anxiety about the state of affairs in his country via powerful imagery and metaphors. This poem is a call to action to his compatriots to stand up for their rights and work towards a more just and equal society.\n\nFaiz interweaves the themes of love, sacrifice, oppression, tyranny, hope, and resilience throughout the poem. He points out the sacrifices ordinary people have made and emphasizes their resilience amid adversity. Ultimately, the poem conveys a message of determination and hope, reminding readers that even in the darkest of times, there is always hope for a better future.\n\nSummary\n\n‘For Your Lanes, My Country’ depicts the struggle of people against oppression and tyranny. The poet is ready to sacrifice for his country.\n\nThe poem begins with the poet’s willingness to sacrifice everything he has for his country, but he laments that in today’s society, no one walks with their head held high. The lovers in the country have to sneak out to meet each other due to the fear of the consequences. The new order of the day is that bricks and stones are imprisoned while the stray dogs are free to roam.\n\nThe apologists of tyranny find solace in the fact that a few of the poet’s friends have turned into power-seekers, judges, and plaintiffs. This makes it hard to find someone to represent them or seek justice from. However, people manage to survive away from their country and worry about it day and night.\n\nThe poet finds hope in the darkness of the prison gratings as he sees stars sprinkled in the hair of his beloved country. He believes that when he sees light through the gratings, he knows that his country’s face would be bathed in the dawn.\n\nThe poet understands that fighting oppression is not new, and people have always grown flowers in a fire. He doesn’t complain to Heaven or make himself sad thinking about his country’s plight. He believes that separation for one night isn’t much, and his rivals’ reign of a few days isn’t much either. Those who remain true to their country understand the daily turmoil and struggles that it faces.\n\nIn essence, ‘For Your Lanes, My Country’ poem depicts the poet’s unshakable affection and loyalty towards his nation and his conviction that its fight against oppression will eventually result in success.

The lovers in the country have to sneak out to meet each other due to the fear of the consequences, and the new order of the day is that bricks and stones are imprisoned while the stray dogs are free to roam. The apologists of tyranny find solace in the fact that a few of the narrator’s friends have turned into power-seekers, judges, and plaintiffs.\n\nHope and Resilience\n\nBut the custom these days is\n\nNo one walks with head held high.\n\nThe lovers looking for each other must sneak out\n\nAfraid of life and limb, and\n\nFor them, a new order of the day now:\n\nThe bricks and stones are imprisoned and the stray dogs free to roam.\n\nDespite the challenges and difficulties faced by the country, the poet remains hopeful and steadfast in his dedication to his homeland. He sees stars sprinkled in his country’s hair even in the darkness of prison gratings and believes that his country’s face will be bathed in the dawn when he sees the light through the gratings. He understands that fighting oppression is not new, and people have always grown flowers in the fire.\n\nIn any case, I live in imagined days and nights, I exist in the shadow of the prison walls.\n\nOverall, the themes of love, sacrifice, oppression, tyranny, hope, and resilience are interwoven throughout the poem, and the narrator presents a poignant and powerful reflection on the struggles of his country and its people.\n\nLiterary Devices\n\nFaiz Ahmad Faiz employs a range of literary devices in his poem ‘For Your Lanes, My Country‘ to convey his message effectively. Here are some examples:\n\nMetaphor: The poet uses metaphor to describe the oppression faced by the people of his country. For instance, he says, “The bricks and stones are imprisoned, and the stray dogs free to roam.” Here, bricks and stones represent the people who are imprisoned, while stray dogs symbolize those in power who are free to do as they please.\n\nImagery: The poet employs vivid imagery to create a visual picture of the situation in his country. For example, he describes how his heart sees stars sprinkled in his country’s hair even in the darkness of prison gratings and how he imagines his country’s face will be bathed in the dawn when he sees the light through the gratings.\n\nPersonification: Faiz Ahmad Faiz personifies the country in several instances in the poem. For example, he writes, “For your lanes, my country,” implying that the country has its own identity and personality.\n\nRepetition: The poet uses repetition to emphasize his message. For instance, he repeats the phrase “I can sacrifice all I have” to underscore his willingness to do whatever it takes to serve his country.\n\nAlliteration: The poet employs alliteration to create a musical quality in the poem. For example, he uses the phrase “lovers looking” and “shadow of the prison walls” to create a rhythmic effect.\n\nIrony: Faiz Ahmad Faiz uses irony to criticize the apologists of tyranny who find solace in the fact that a few of his friends have turned into power-seekers, judges, and plaintiffs. He writes, “For the many apologists of tyranny, it’s enough that a few of your dear friends have turned into power-seekers, judges, and plaintiffs.” This statement is ironic because these friends were originally fighting against tyranny but have now become part of the problem.\n\nDetailed Analysis\n\nLines 1-4\n\nFor your lanes, my country, I can sacrifice all I have\n\nBut the custom these days is\n\nNo one walks with head held high.\n\nNo one walks with head held high.\n\nThese lines introduce the poem’s main theme of sacrifice for the country. Faiz Ahmad Faiz asserts his willingness to give up everything for his country but notes that it is no longer fashionable for people to walk with pride and dignity. The phrase “head held high” creates a vivid image of confidence and self-respect, highlighting how the people in the country are losing their sense of pride and identity.\n\nThe repetition of “my country” emphasizes the speaker’s deep attachment and loyalty to their homeland. The use of “lanes” instead of “streets” or “roads” implies a more intimate connection to the place, perhaps indicating a smaller, more personal community within the country. The phrase “I can sacrifice all I have” also speaks to the idea of patriotism and the willingness to make personal sacrifices for the greater good of the country.\n\nHowever, the phrase “the custom these days” suggests a shift in societal values, where pride and confidence are no longer celebrated or encouraged. This could be interpreted as a commentary on the current state of affairs in the country, where corruption and inequality have eroded the people’s sense of pride and self-respect. The contrast between the speaker’s willingness to sacrifice and the lack of pride in the people around them sets up a tension between personal loyalty and societal decay. Overall, these lines capture the complex relationship between an individual’s love for their country and the societal forces that shape their sense of identity and belonging.\n\nLines 5-9\n\nThe lovers looking for each other must sneak out\n\n(…)\n\nand the stray dogs free to roam.\n\nThese lines illustrate the harsh realities of life under an oppressive regime. People cannot freely express their love or even meet without fear of persecution. The use of the phrase “life and limb” emphasizes the danger they face. Faiz contrasts the plight of ordinary people with that of those in power, who are free to do as they please. The metaphorical description of “bricks and stones” as imprisoned and stray dogs as free, emphasizes the injustice of the situation.\n\nFaiz also uses imagery to contrast the lovers who must sneak out with the stray dogs who roam freely. The image of stray dogs represents society’s chaos and lawlessness, while the lovers represent humanity’s desire for connection and love. By juxtaposing these two images, Faiz highlights the ruling regime’s distorted priorities, which have stripped people of their basic human rights and instead promote a culture of fear and oppression.\n\nOverall, these lines convey the message that people’s basic rights and freedoms are restricted under an oppressive regime, and they are forced to live in constant fear. The metaphor of imprisoned bricks and stones and free-roaming stray dogs is a powerful critique of the unjust nature of the current order. In these lines, Faiz’s use of vivid imagery and strong metaphors effectively conveys the pain and suffering of those living under such conditions, making the poem a powerful commentary on the human experience of oppression.\n\nLines 10-14\n\nFor the many apologists of tyranny.\n\n(…)\n\nWho can you ask justice from?\n\nIn these lines, the narrator criticizes those who defend tyranny, suggesting that they are complicit in its perpetuation. He points out how those who were once advocates for justice have now become part of the oppressive regime. The rhetorical questions highlight the lack of justice and representation for the people in the country.\n\nFaiz emphasizes the people’s betrayal by those who were once their allies and have now become part of the oppressive system. The phrase “dear friends” emphasizes the sense of betrayal felt by those who trusted and supported these people. Faiz also implies that those in power are uninterested in justice, leaving the people with nowhere to turn. The phrase “who can you ask for justice from?” emphasizes the despair felt by those who have been abandoned by their former allies and by their fellow citizens.\n\nFurthermore, Faiz suggests that tyrants are content with the few friends who have turned into power-seekers, judges, and plaintiffs because they provide them with a sense of security and power. The word “enough” emphasizes their complacency in the face of oppression, emphasizing their willingness to ignore the suffering of others. Faiz challenges them to question their own morality and values, asking if their support for tyranny is worth sacrificing their fellow citizens’ rights and dignity.\n\nLines 15-36\n\nBut people do survive, away from you,\n\n(…)\n\nunderstand what the daily turmoil really means\n\nThese lines expose how people endure and resist oppression. The poet highlights the resilience of ordinary people who manage to survive despite the odds. He emphasizes that the struggle against oppression is not new, and people have been fighting it for generations. The line “That’s why I don’t complain to the Heaven” suggests that Faiz has accepted the situation and is not looking for divine intervention. Instead, he is focused on using his own means to resist and fight back.\n\nIn a nutshell, Faiz Ahmad Faiz’s ‘For Your Lanes, My Country’ employs emotive language to condemn tyranny and oppression, highlighting ordinary people’s sacrifices and perseverance in the face of adversity. Ultimately, the poem’s message is one of hope: people can withstand and resist even the darkest of times, and their quest for justice and liberty will eventually triumph.\n\nFAQs\n\nSimilar Poetry\n\nThose who enjoyed this poem by Faiz Ahmed Faiz may also get interested in the following others:"
