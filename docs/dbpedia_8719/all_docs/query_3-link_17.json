        "text": "Mana ke yeh sunsan ghadi sakht badi hai ,\n\nlekin mere dil ye to faqat ek ghadi hai ,\n\nhimmat karo jeeene ko abhi umr padi hai.\n\nBefore I can explain what Faiz Ahmad Faiz, means to me and how his poetry has changed and more importantly helped me in time of grief, I wonder what should I write about such a personality, how to justify the situation where a novice writer like me whose blog is read by handful of people tries to encapsulate work and life of a great socialist poet admired by people across the world, specially in Asian subcontinent.\n\nFaiz is the most famous contemporary Urdu poet of twentieth century. His poetry appeals to both common men as well as elite critics of poetry. Faiz was a committed poet who regarded poetry as a vehicle of serious thoughts rather than a pleasurable pastime and often used it to the cause of socialistic humanism.\n\nFaiz was born in upper middle class society in West Punjab (now in Pakistan) in 1911. In Contrast to the vogue of upper middle class society in those days of travelling to Europe for college education, Faiz gained his education from famous college of Lahore, where many other renowned poets like Ahmad Faraz also studied. He breathed the air of his country and knew its people more intimately than most others. Faiz was found of poetry of Mir Taqi, Ghalib and Daagh. He was voracious reader of the novels of Dickens and Hardy.\n\nIn his prime age Faiz was a part of time when Anti-British, or nationalistic sentiment, the desire for freedom, to rid the country of the foreigner, was in the air and so were the Left-wing or Communist thoughts. The struggle against foreigners, poverty and the fight against the forces of capitalism gave young Faiz’s poetry a sense of direction and home to his political spectrum. Faiz as a poet was not alone who was influenced by The Marxist ideology and who wanted to bring a social difference through his poetry. Some other well-known names were Sajjad Zaheer, Rashid Jahan, Kaifi Azmi, Sardar Jafri, Muhammad Ashraf.\n\nThese intellectuals belonged to different regions but shared the same ideology and the same dream: the world needed to be changed, and Marxism was the force that could bring about the change. The Progressive Writers’ Movement, founded in 1935 in London by Sajjad Zaheer, and Mulk Raj Anand, among others, was the literary form of that dream.\n\nFaiz deepen his bond with progressiveness and socialism by marrying Alys George, an English socialist.\n\nHis life took a steep turn in 1951, almost ten years after his marriage when Faiz along with Sajjad Zaheer, both part of Progressive Writers’ movement were arrested on charges to overthrow the government of Pakistan. He was sentenced to four years of vigorous imprisonment.\n\nguloñ meñ rañg bhare bād-e-nau-bahār chale\n\nchale bhī aao ki gulshan kā kārobār chale\n\nqafas udaas hai yaaro sabā se kuchh to kaho\n\nkahīñ to bahr-e-ḳhudā aaj zikr-e-yār chale\n\nAbove lines are extract from Faiz’s famous gazal, which he wrote during his imprisonment days.\n\nThese years of incarceration, however turned out to a blessing in disguise. Creatively, they were the most fruitful years of his life.\n\nIn below lines, Faiz talks about the good side of imprisonment\n\nfikr-e-sūd-o-ziyāñ to chūTegī\n\nminnat-e-īn-o-āñ to chūTegī\n\nḳhair dozaḳh meñ mai mile na mile\n\nshaiḳh-sāhib se jaañ to chūTegī\n\nfikr-e-sūd-o-ziyāñ :- Anxiety of loss and gain\n\nminnat-e-īn-o-āñ :- pleasing everyone\n\nKhair:- Wine\n\nDozakh:- Hell\n\nDue to his revolutionary and progressive poetry and statement, Faiz suffered imprisonment and exile from Pakistan even in later stages of his life. He finally returned to Pakistan in 1982. Couple of years later he passed away after suffering from asthma.\n\nSoon after his death, both progressive and conservatives were keen to own him up and show that Faiz was their poet. In this context one is reminded of Kabir, after whose death both Hindus and Muslims argued with each other to claim that he belonged to them.\n\nThroughout his life as a poet, Faiz had a firm believe that poetry must serve a cause, that it should serve as a “beacon to poor humanity’s afflicted will”. However he has also written lot on love and the sadness born with it.\n\naur kyā dekhne ko baaqī hai\n\naap se dil lagā ke dekh liyā\n\nwo mere ho ke bhī mere na hue\n\nun ko apnā banā ke dekh liyā\n\nit is hard to choose one, so I am posting one more"
