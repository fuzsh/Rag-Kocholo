        "text": "Profile of Rowan Williams, Archbishop of Canterbury\n\nDr Rowan Williams was nominated as the 104th Archbishop of Canterbury in July 2002 and officially confirmed in the post at a ceremony in St Paul's Cathedral in London on 2nd December 2002.\n\nDr Williams announced his resignation in March 2012, to step down on 31 December 2012, putting his time in the post at just over ten years.\n\nRowan Williams's life\n\nRowan Williams was born in 1950 and was brought up in Swansea, where his father was a mining engineer. His academic ability became apparent at an early age, and he went from grammar school to Cambridge, and then to Oxford for his doctorate. He then went to lecture at Mirfield Theological College near Leeds, before returning to Cambridge and Oxford. First he was Dean and Chaplain of Clare College, and then, aged 36, he become the youngest professor at Oxford. Seven years earlier his first book had been published.\n\nIn 1992 he surprised colleagues by accepting the post of Bishop of Monmouth, seen as a backwater by the Oxford elite. The post spoke to his pastoral calling, and his Welsh roots. Plus it was a good place for Rowan Williams and his wife, Jane, a lecturer in theology, whom he met while living and working in Cambridge, to bring up their daughter Rhiannon and son Pip.\n\nIn 1997, Dr Williams came close to be offered the post of Bishop of Southwark. There were fierce wrangles at the time between anti and pro-gay lobbies in the diocese. When George Carey, the former Archbishop of Canterbury, asked Rowan Williams to distance himself from his pro-gay writings on the subject, he declined. In 2000 he was enthroned as Archbishop of Wales.\n\nIn order to see this content you need to have both Javascript enabled and Flash installed. Visit BBC Webwise for full instructions\n\nRowan Williams is regarded as a liberal, even a radical. But in general, his theology is orthodox. It's been nurtured by Anglo-Catholicism, Russian mysticism, and scores of encounters with other traditions. Many of his ethical positions are orthodox too. For example, he is opposed to abortion and believes consumerism exploits, corrupts and causes a premature sexualisation of children.\n\nHomosexuality has been the cause of recent criticism by fellow priests. Several years ago he employed a priest he knew to be living in a homosexual relationship. It is this, coupled with his conviction that the Church should reassess its approach to faithful gay partnerships, that has alarmed conservative evangelicals. However, many groups think he will modernise, or certainly bring a new face to, the Church of England.\n\nWilliams is sympathetic to the proposal that the Church of England should lose its established status and become a church on an equal footing with the Catholics, the free churches and all the other Christian denominations. This is not a view likely to endear him to traditionalists.\n\nRowan Williams is expected to be a formidable presence on the political stage too. Before very long in office he had already spoken out against war with Iraq, critcised military action in Afghanistan as \"morally tainted\" and challenged the Government's asylum policy.\n\nHe is a fan of the television programme Father Ted and was the first Archbishop for many generations to have children of school age.\n\n10 things you didn't know about Rowan Williams\n\nRowan Williams is unable to drive. His chaplain used to drive him everywhere, so the chauffeur-driven world of Lambeth must have come naturally\n\nHe is hard of hearing in one of his ears\n\nHe was a keen actor at Oxford, starring as Thomas More in A Man for All Seasons\n\nHe learnt Russian in six months. He speaks seven languages, including Welsh\n\nHe has had curious fashion tastes with a particular fondness for black berets\n\nHe insists on always travelling second-class\n\nHe is married to the daughter of the the Rt Rev Geoffrey Paul. Jane Williams' father is the former Bishop of Bradford and a highly respected evangelical leader\n\nAlthough he taught at a number of theological colleges, he is the only bishop never to have gone through training for ordination\n\nAt school, he had a permanent note excusing him from sports\n\nHe is very fond of classical music, particularly Renaissance Baroque and Bach\n\nEnthronement\n\nThe enthronement of the 104th Archbishop of Canterbury, Dr Rowan Williams, took place in Canterbury Cathedral on 27th February 2002 and marked the start of Dr. Williams' public ministry as Archbishop of Canterbury.\n\nBishops from the 38 provinces of the Anglican Communion were joined by representatives of other denominations, senior members of the Royal family, foreign ambassadors, political and civic leaders and staff from Canterbury Cathedral.\n\nLike the guests, the musical influences came from around the world: traditional English church music sung by the choir of Canterbury Cathedral, a Celtic anthem commissioned from the Scottish Roman Catholic composer James Macmillan, music from Africa, a Penillion (duet between a singer and harpist) and an anthem from Newport Cathedral Choir.\n\nThe Canterbury Gospels were used during the service as the Archbishop took his oath. Traditionally this book is thought to have been given by Pope Gregory the Great to St Augustine for his mission to England at the end of the 6th century and is one of the oldest manuscripts in the UK. The office of the Archbishop of Canterbury dates back to St. Augustine who was the first Archbishop of Canterbury in AD 597.\n\nThe Archbishop was first enthroned by the Archdeacon of Canterbury in the Diocesan throne in the Cathedral Quire - his seat as head of the Diocese. He was then be enthroned by the Dean of Canterbury in St Augustine's Chair - his seat as Primate of All England and Leader of the Anglican Communion with its 70 million members across the globe.\n\nThe Archbishop of Canterbury today has six main roles:\n\nDiocesan Bishop of Canterbury\n\nMetropolitan for the Southern Province of the Church of England\n\nPrimate of All England\n\nLeader of the Anglican Communion\n\nEcumenical role - The Archbishop of Canterbury takes the lead in respect of Anglican relationships with other Christian churches in the United Kingdom and abroad\n\nInterfaith role - The Archbishop of Canterbury leads in respect of Anglican relationships with other faiths"
