        "text": "This article analyses the conversion to Islam of indigenous chiefs in North Cameroon. The chiefs studied belong to the Mundang ethnic group. Their islamisation is interpreted as the outcome of the ambivalence brought about by their intermediary role between local society and the wider society. This approach offers insights in (a) the connection between conversion and political careers; (b) the relation between Islam and ethnic identities; and (c) the popular legitimacy of conversion.KEY WORDS: Cameroon, Mundang, chiefs, Islam, ethnicity, cosmology\n\nThis article questions the role of the moral and religious actors in the emergence of homosexuality as a political object in Cameroon. It situates the genealogy of a moral sexual panic by the Catholic Bishop of Yaound√© and the Cardinal of the same tendency as the key actors of the public debate that also included the private press. It shows 'opposing movements' engaging those two religious actors with same-sex people's organizations. It calls for a contextualized analysis of 'religious homophobia' by taking into account the opposition between the moral actors and the State.\n\nThis article sets out to present Joshua Dibundu and Lotin Same, two clergymen and contemporaries of John Chilembwe of Nyasaland and Simon Kibangu of the Congo, who stood out against European missionary pressure and colonial administrative oppression in an effort to establish and sustain the first African Independent Church (AIC) in Cameroon: the Native Baptist Church (NBC). I argue in this article that unlike the Cameroon kings and chiefs who resisted European occupation of the territory, and nationalists who fought for independence, the leaders of the Native Baptist Church represent another type of early nationalist and change-oriented agents who deserve their place in the historiography of the country. I have privileged the use of archival documents, structured interviews and some critical empirical literature to establish this account."
