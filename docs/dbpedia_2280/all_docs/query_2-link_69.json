        "text": "The congress was to lay the groundwork for the life of the association. Members therefore deliberated the Church’s mission to encourage all men to be involved in the affairs of the Church and society by realizing and acknowledging their role, capability and dignity in promoting the human and spiritual growth of men in different parishes and dioceses .\n\nEmphasis was laid on the church’s mission to encourage the creation and fostering of Catholic Action and prayer groups in the Church so that members, well formed in the teachings of the Church and professions be faithful witnesses of the Gospel in the world. On these bases the following resolutions were taken:\n\n1) to form a lay private, apolitical, non-profit making, non tribal national association of men in the Catholic Church in Cameroon called the « Catholic Men Association, Cameroon. This association that admits all baptized Catholic men and youths aged 20 years and above, single or married, and who shall be dedicated upon at least one year probation. The CMA has as primordial objectives:\n\n– to enable members model their lives after the life-style of St. Joseph, husband of Mary and Foster Father of our Saviour Jesus Christ and\n\n– a rallying force (instrument) for the evangelization of Catholic men in Cameroon.\n\n– To put in place a Caretaker Committee to continue with the foundation already laid in this congress for a period of two years and whose end of mandate will give way to organized elections of the national bureau. The functioning of this caretaker committee will be facilitated by free will donations already started by the delegates present, notwithstanding the appeal that contributions of national dues of 500frs per member go operational immediately.\n\n– The draft Statute of the Catholic Men Association, Cameroon just worked out by a constitutional committee be sent back to the dioceses for thorough examination and the proposal made to be examined in the next general assembly, the convening of which is at the behest of the caretaker committee.\n\n– That any report to be presented in such a forum by any group or groups of people must be sanctioned by the prelate in place and/or the local ordinary\n\n– That priests should not only be sympathizers and/or supervisors of CMA but should concretely participate by being members\n\n– That there will be a great need for the various Diocesan Chaplains of the CMA to meet after the final draft is made by the General Assembly to examine it before forwarding it to the Bishops for approval.\n\n– That all CMA activities should be built on three Cardinal principles viz, the Moral principles of the Church; the Ten Commandments and the Church laws in order to enhance its spiritual upliftment.\n\n– To form a National Communication Structure to ease the flow of information through networking (Website, chat groups, database, Newsletters, Magazines, etc) and the adoption of a comprehensive directory for every member.\n\n– That the seat of the National CMA is in Bamenda and Bamenda will be required to open a Post Box and Email Address.\n\n– That the CMA National Account shall be in the Archbishop’s House of Bamenda and the account number communicated to all dioceses.\n\n– That a foundation fee of 500frs per member is hereby instituted\n\n– That its uniform should be registered with a trade mark (OAPI) Yaoundé.\n\nThe congress ended by putting in place a care-taker committee to oversee the affairs of the association by ensuring the smooth execution of the resolutions taken.\n\nThe CMA until now has existed as isolated organs in the various dioceses and this congress has placed an important mark on the history of the association. The CMA in Bamenda was dedicated and commissioned by Archbishop Emeritus, Fr. Paul Verdzekov in March, 2003."
