Augustine arrived in 597 and was well received by Aethelberht I, king of Kent, who gave him a place to live in Canterbury and permitted him to preach. The Reformation caused no break in the continuity of the office. Thomas Cranmer (archbishop 1533–56) accepted the Act of Supremacy (1534) that made the English sovereign, rather than the pope, the head of the Church of England.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nChristianity Quiz"
