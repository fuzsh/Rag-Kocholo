        "text": "It has now been eight years since the pope appointed Christophe Pierre as apostolic nuncio to the United States. It was April 12, 2016 when Francis chose the lifelong Holy See diplomat, then serving as his ambassador to Mexico, to take up the post in Washington. The French archbishop was already 70 years old and most observers surmised that he'd be in the US capital for no more than the five years it would take him to reach the normal retirement age for bishops (even if papal diplomats have the option of stepping down at 70).\n\nHeading the Holy See's nunciature to the United States has long been seen as a plum post. Though there have been a couple of notable exceptions, the pope's man in Washington usually returns to the Vatican after several years of service, where he is given another prestigious position and made a cardinal. But in Pierre's case, the red hat arrived last September when he was still the Holy See's ambassador to the United States. And to this day, the cardinal-nuncio, already 78 years of age, remains on the job.\n\nLittle success in re-shaping the US hierarchy\n\nSome believe Francis made Pierre a cardinal last year, instead of waiting for later, in order to give him more heft among a US hierarchy that has done very little to embrace the pastoral priorities the pope has set before the worldwide Church. There are 196 Catholic dioceses and archdioceses in the United States and it is no secret that many of the bishops who lead them are uncomfortable with the current pontificate. Some of them can barely hide their contempt for the Jesuit pope and the way he has tirelessly tried to change the black-and-white, follow-the-rules, pray-pay-and-obey mentality that continues to dominate so many sectors and individuals in the Church. The US Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB), the body that collectively represents these hierarchs, has shown little enthusiasm for the paradigm shift that Francis has begun implementing. Cardinal Pierre has hardly been able to budge the men in its ranks.\n\nThere are two fundamental aspects to the work of an apostolic nuncio. First, he functions as the Holy See's ambassador to other sovereign states. But, secondly, he is a liaison between the Roman Pontiff and a country's Catholic hierarchy. In this role, he has the grave responsibility of helping the pope (and the Dicastery for Bishops) find able candidates for episcopal ordination. And, even more importantly, he helps identify those bishops most suitable to be ordinaries (leaders) of dioceses, especially the more important and influential sees such as the archdioceses. Church analysts generally agree that the success of a nuncio in this area is best gauged by how he has been able to \"shape\" a country's hierarchy in the image of the reigning pope.\n\nLooking for bishops in the mold of Pope Francis\n\nJohn Paul II, in the course of nearly 27 years in office, certainly found the nuncios that helped him remake the worldwide hierarchy. And Benedict XVI, though less than eight years as pope, may have been even more successful in promoting men of his mindset to the top rungs of the ecclesiastical ladder. This was certainly true in the United States where, during his albeit brief pontificate, he was able to replace most of the archbishops (and heads of other important places) with men of a more doctrinally inflexible mindset. These Church \"conservatives\" or traditionalists, in turn, took over the leadership posts of the USCCB. The fact that they continue to hold on to the episcopal conference's key positions and stubbornly cling to the same cultural warrior priorities that they set during Benedict's pontificate stands as a strong indictment against the current papal nuncio to Washington.\n\nCardinal Pierre has not been able to move the dial, as it were, in the US hierarchy. Yes, there may be exceptions, but there do not seem to be many. The most prominent \"pro-Francis\" bishops in the United States -- men like the Franciscan Bishop John Stowe of Lexington (KY) and Cardinals Blase Cupich (Chicago) and Joseph Tobin (Newark) -- were appointed to their posts before he arrived in Washington. Yes, Pierre was nuncio when Wilton Gregory was transferred from Atlanta to the US capital and perhaps he will still be nuncio when Cardinal Robert McElroy, who now heads the Diocese of San Diego, is promoted to a more prominent see. In fairness to Cardinal Pierre, it cannot be easy trying to find men who are likely to be bishops in the mold of Pope Francis, especially given the generally more traditional mentality of clerics in the required age group -- that is, priests under the age of seventy-five!\n\nUrgent need to replace aging bishops and fill empty dioceses\n\nThere are currently seven Latin Rite dioceses and one eparchy in the United States that do not have a bishop. Fifteen other sees -- 8 of them archdioceses -- are being led by men who are already 75 years of age or older. Who will the nuncio help find to be the next archbishop of Boston? Cardinal Sean O'Malley, the current one, will soon be 80. Who will take over from Cardinal Gregory in Washington? He's now 76 and has slowed considerably. Cardinal Cupich is now 75 but is not likely to be going anywhere soon. Nonetheless, that is also a key post that will eventually have to be filled with someone else. The ordinaries of 11 more dioceses and archdiocese will reach the retirement age by the end of this calendar year. Add them all up, and it comes to 33 places that will soon be in need of new episcopal leadership. If the current pope, now in the final stages of his pontificate, is to have any chance of steering the US hierarchy to a place more in line with his vision for the Church, it is imperative that he begin filling those slots now.\n\nThe USCCB has become an uninspiring and, at times, embarrassing organization representing the more than 400 bishops -- including auxiliaries and retirees -- that are supposed to be the spiritual leaders of Catholics in the United States. The most senior member of the US hierarchy, until his death on April 4, was Thomas Gumbleton, whom Paul VI named auxiliary bishop of Detroit in 1968. As this is being written -- just hours before his May 13 funeral Mass in the Cathedral of the Blessed Sacrament, presided over by Cardinal Tobin, another Detroit native -- the USCCB has not even mentioned Bishop Gumbleton's death, let alone pay any sort of tribute to him. And you'll be hard pressed to find more than just a very few of these more than 400 American bishops who have publicly acknowledged Gumbleton's many years of ministry to the poor, the outcast, and people on the margins, or his efforts to promote justice and peace.\n\nWhen you pray for Pope Francis, say a little prayer for Cardinal Pierre, too. By now, it should be clear to anyone in the United States who has been energized by this pontificate that finding better bishops for the Church in their country is more urgent than ever."
