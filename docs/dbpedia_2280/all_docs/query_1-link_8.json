        "text": "Roman Catholic diocese in Cameroon\n\nThe Roman Catholic Diocese of Kumbo (Latin: Dioecesis Kumboënsis) is a Roman Catholic diocese in the Ecclesiastical Province of Bamenda in Cameroon. The first German settlers were Missionaries of the Sacred Heart who arrived in 1912 and established their mission in 1913. The Diocese of Kumbo was erected by Pope John Paul II on Thursday, 18 March 1982, with territory taken from the then Diocese (now Archdiocese) of Bamenda. It is a suffragan diocese of the Metropolitan See of Bamenda along with the Roman Catholic Dioceses of Buea, Kumba (not to be confused with Kumbo), and Mamfe.\n\nThe Diocese of Kumbo is made up of two civil administrative units, namely, Bui and Donga-Mantung Divisions in the North West Region of the Republic of Cameroon. Bui Division is further divided into 6 subdivisions: Kumbo Central, Jakiri, Oku, Mbven, Nkum and Noni, while Donga-Mantung Division is divided into 5 subdivisions, viz: Nkambe Central, Ndu, Ako, Misaje and Nwa.\n\nThe territory of Bui and Donga-Mantung Divisions situated in the Bamenda grassfields area of the North West Region of Cameroon covers a surface area of 8,000 square kilometers (3,090 square miles) with a population of approximately 789,000 of whom over 202,543 (25.7%) are Catholics. There are 11 ethnic groups: Nso’ tribe, the Oku tribe and the Noni tribe in Bui Division, and the Wimbum, Mbembe, Jukum, Nchanti, Mfumte, Yamba, Mbaw and Mambila tribes in Donga-Mantung Division. Each of these tribes has its own language and dialects.\n\nConsidering the fact that the average annual population growth is about 2.36%, the total population of the diocese has grown from 653,244 in 1998 to 734,052 in 2003. Since the area of the territory is about 8,000 km2, the population density is about 92 people per km2. This is one of the densely populated Catholic dioceses in Cameroon.\n\nThere are three main religious groups in the Diocese of Kumbo, namely, the Christians, the Muslims and the adherents of the African Traditional Religion. The present statistics reveal that the adherents of the African Traditional Religion are still the majority, followed by the Christians in the second place and then the Moslems.[citation needed] The Christians are further regrouped into Catholics, Presbyterians, Baptists and some Evangelical and Pentecostal Communities like the Churches of Christ and the Deeper Life Church. The population of this latter group is very insignificant, made up mainly of drop-outs from the other Christian groups.\n\nThe Catholic population has continued to grow steadily, with an average of about 4,140 baptisms per year, and about 5,429 catechumens per year.\n\nThere are no available statistics from the main Protestant Churches, namely, the Presbyterian Church in Cameroon (PCC) and the Cameroon Baptist Convention (CBC).\n\nThe evangelical groups, like the Churches of Christ and Deeper Life Church, which can be considered as sects, recruit their followers from the mainline Protestant Churches. They are very active among students and young people.\n\nThere are also no available statistics about the Muslims. In the Kumbo urban area there are two Islamic secondary schools and a Teacher Training College.\n\nThe Moslem population is made up of the traditionally Islamic tribes, the Hausa people, the Fulanis and the Wodaabe or the Bororo people, who are mostly grazers, and those from the local tribes who have been Islamized. The greater bulk of this category and of the Moslems in general is found among the Nso Tribe. They win some of their converts, especially women, through marriage and by giving cows as bait to the young people who want to get rich overnight.[citation needed]\n\nThe adherents of the African Religions still constitute the bulk of the population. As with Islam, there are no statistics about them.\n\nThe cathedral is Saint Therese of the Child Jesus Cathedral in Kumbo. Below is a full list of Deaneries and Parishes in the two civil administrative units that make up the Diocese of Kumbo.\n\nBishops of Kumbo (Roman rite), in reverse chronological order\n\nBishop George Nkuo (since 8 July 2006)\n\nBishop Cornelius Fontem Esua (10 September 1982 – 7 December 2004), appointed Coadjutor Archbishop of Bamenda\n\nAgapitus Enuyehnyoh Nfon, appointed Auxiliary Bishop of Bamenda in 2011\n\nThe diocese of Kumbo is led by\n\nThe Bishop\n\nThe Vicar-General\n\nTwo Episcopal Delegates or Vicars\n\nThe Vicar for Catechists\n\nThe Vicar for Laity\n\nThe Council of Priests\n\nThe Chairman for the Association of Diocesan Priests (ADP)\n\nAdditionally, there is a Presbyteral Council, various consultative Committees and Commissions and each Deanery has a Dean or a Vicar Forane.\n\nMALE CONGREGATIONS\n\nPriests\n\nSaint Joseph's Society for Foreign Missions, (Mill Hill Missionaries), MHM\n\nOrder of Friars Minor Capuchin, O.F.M.

The Diocese also operates Pilot Agricultural Training Projects at Mfumte, Mbiame and Misaje.[citation needed]\n\nThe Diocese is also runs the FACTS Project for Catholic schools and colleges.
