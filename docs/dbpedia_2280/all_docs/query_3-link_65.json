        "text": "Mary As Our Model\n\nArchbishop Riordan High School is an Archdiocesan Catholic school in the Marianist tradition. Blessed William Joseph Chaminade founded the Society of Mary (the Marianists) in France in 1817. The order is distinguished by certain charisms, or gifts given by God for the benefit of the Christian community, that guide all Marianist ministries and programs in the U.S. and around the world. These charisms are to be People of Faith, Followers of Mary, People of Community, Discipleship of Equals, and Leaders in Mission. Education is the principal work of the Society, though a large number of religious are in other works of the apostolate such as preaching, parish work, orphanages, missions, and directing lay groups.\n\nA Catholic Marianist high school fosters the premise of education as a transformative process. Rooted in the courage, spirit and compassion of our Blessed Mother, graduates of Archbishop Riordan High School become leaders and mentors in society.\n\nCharacteristics of Marianist Education\n\nThe Marianist spirit holds dearly the principle of the Golden Rule where students become scholars who embrace diversity, embody mutual respect, and lead by example. To accomplish this task, Marianist educators are entrusted to educate in five characteristics that guide the mission and philosophy of our school:\n\nFaith Formation\n\nIntegral Quality Education\n\nFamily Spirit\n\nService, Justice, Peace & the Integrity of Creation\n\nAdaptation & Change\n\nMarianist Integration Team (MIT)\n\nMembers of the Marianist Integration Team (MIT) facilitate the school community’s understanding of the Characteristics of Marianist Education, integrating these ideals in all aspects of school life, including our boarding program.\n\nDrawing on internal feedback, experience, assessment, and a variety of Marianist resources—including the Northern American Center for Marianist Studies, Office of Sponsorship, teacher education workshops, and networking with other Marianist schools—the team creates and implements detailed long-term and short-term strategic plans to enhance the Marianist spirit at Riordan."
