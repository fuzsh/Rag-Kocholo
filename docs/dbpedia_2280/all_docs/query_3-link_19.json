        "text": "About the Book\n\nMonasticism is a religious way of life in which a person renounces worldly pursuits to devote themselves completely to a celebration of spirituality. Monasticism is important in many Christian churches, especially in Catholic and Orthodox traditions. There are similar forms of religious life in other faiths, for example, in Buddhism, Hinduism and Jainism. In some other religions monasticism is shunned, as in Islam and Zoroastrianism, or is marginal, as in Judaism.\n\nAlso in this Book\n\nWithin Christianity, worship is reverent honor and homage that is paid to God. Throughout Christianity's history, communal Christian worship has been liturgical, with by prayers, hymns, and texts rooted in Scripture, particularly the Psalter. Sacramental and ceremonial worship continues to be practiced by the Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, and Anglican churches, as well as by several Protestant denominations including Lutherans and Methodists. On the other hand, within Evangelism, worship is viewed more as an act of adoration of God, with a more informal, spontaneous framework.\n\nAnd in this Book\n\nThe history of Christianity concerns the Christian religion, with its various denominations, from the life of Jesus Christ in the 1st century to the present. Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox Christianity spread to all of Europe in the Middle Ages, and since the Renaissance, has expanded throughout the world and become the world's largest religion (with over 2 billion faithful). At first persecuted, but later embraced by the Roman Empire, the East-West Schism, or Great Schism of 1054, separated the Church into Western (Latin) and Eastern (Greek) branches, i.e., Western Catholicism (based on Rome) and Eastern Orthodoxy (based on Constantinople). The rise of Islam resulted in a number of Crusades fought by Christian Armies from Europe, whose aim was to re-capture and hold Jerusalem. In 1453, Constantinople fell to the Ottoman Empire, and Christianity was almost completely removed from the territory that now comprises Turkey. The three most important traditions that emerged from the Protestant Reformation (1521-1610) were the Lutheran, Reformed (Calvinist, Presbyterian, etc.), and Anglican traditions.\n\nAbout us\n\nLeopold Classic Library has the goal of making available to readers the classic books that have been out of print for decades.
