        "text": "Founded in 1396 and fully constituted in 1411, the over 600 years old Nso dynasty has stood tall, holding close to its nucleus, its long standing culture and pride; the throne. It has a well-organized system of government often described as an ideal democracy for its participatory nature. It’s designated 25+ sub fondoms, traditional cults, notables and the common people have specialized roles that culminate into the central strength of its paramount throne seated in Kimbo (Kumbo).\n\nFon of Nso, Sehm Mbinglo I\n\nIts might has not been known by its age alone, lest about its is formidable culture, but much so for the great minds it produced to the world in the likes of Cameroon’s Socrates, Bernard Fonlon, West Cameroon’s first priest Fr. Aloysius Wankuy, first bishop, Mgr Paul Verdzekov, the lone cardinal for central Africa, Christian Cardinal Tumi, and a host of intellectuals and upright men who raise its flag high.\n\nSince the start of the impasse ravaging the Anglophone part of Cameroon, Nso has suffered many losses in life and material including the first ever death recorded due to the crisis. Whereas its paramount ruler, fon Sehm Mbinglo I had echoed in November of 2017, that he needs his people safe from all forms of violence and oppression, and opted for pacific solutions to the crisis, violence finally got the best of his land and Nso finally becoming one of the most affected zones of Anglophone Cameroon due to the close to four years conflict.\n\nLike most villages in this war-thorn-zone, the Nso experienced a cultural recess, a huge blow to a people known to hold strong to their ways. This was heightened over the months leading to the abduction of the fon on three different events, feebly denounced by Nso sons, and especially the royal folk, leading to the assassination of two princes and the subsequent evacuation of the fon for medical attention in Bamenda, then Foumban and Yaounde.\n\nAll of these, seen to be the worst that could be, were only a start, as the dreaded monarch, accompanied by his “eldest son,” Cardinal Tumi, met with Separatist Fighters in Baba, Ngoketuna Division in the North West region, after a triumphant reception in Bamenda town, which drew much attention from onlookers in the conflict hit town. While he was awaited by several other crowds at several villages along the Bamenda – Kumbo corridor, he was, on that November 5th, at about 5.30pm, abducted alongside Christian Cardinal Tumi and several others within his entourage. While the cardinal got released the following day, the fon regained his freedom on November 11, exactly six days later.\n\nThis has come as a surprise to many, after Nso’s major cult, called “nwerong,” had on October 14th, decreed after offering various appeasement sacrifices, that all enemies should take their hands off the throne and that Nso should stay united behind their leader to ensure a return normal life even within the war rid of hatred.\n\nThe videos released by separatist fighters portraying the fon allegedly interviewed by some of theirs during the period of the abduction were received with mixed feelings and huge condemnation as the interviewers bypassed several elements of royal protocol upheld by the longstanding tradition and also, the respect for royalty, central to the values borne in the heritage of the British Southern Cameroons, purportedly thought to be protected by the fighters.\n\nHaving had their fon stay in captivity for over 144 hours has been the most traumatizing event for Nso sons and daughters across the globe much so for their fear of the unknown given the eerie context characterizing the Anglophone regions.\n\nThe close to ten thousand people who had left Kumbo on November 6th and several hundreds of others from Bamenda in search of the fon in Baba village, demonstrated that after all, the people stand with their supreme leader. In the wake of it all, albeit the frustrations and abuse of a longstanding culture and desecration of the sacred throne of Nso, coupled with the conditional release of the monarch, there seems to be great hope.\n\nJudging from the mobilization offline and on ground; one could not, but tell that the Nso people still have a uniting factor, the throne. It has no doubt been echoed on social media that the recent abduction, claimed to have been caused by the appearance of the fon’s name on an electoral list, was largely influenced by some Nso indigenes who hold differences with the throne.\n\nWhereas the humiliating turn of events frustrated most Nso sons and daughters thereby raising tensions and suspicion, it now seems to be a great opportunity for Nso to grow stronger based on two observed indicators:\n\nFirst, the millions of people from its kin and beyond who came out to condemn the abduction of the fon, and their resilience through difficult topography in search of their fon tells of deep hearted regard and love they have for their throne.\n\nSecond, the social media hype which brought about the spread of controversial and largely unfounded claims, unhelpful to the short impasse, were successfully controlled by the tribe's social front, Nso Development Association and Nso's most respected secret cult, the6 Nwerong, bringing Nso to one voice.\n\nThe biggest challenge however, remains the question of keeping politics away from the throne. Whereas the separatist fighters mentioned that the throne must be seen to be clear of state politics, the Nso man has generally expressed the desire to be its fons eyes and shields.\n\nIn an interview with a Nso notable in Yaoundé who opted for anonymity, he said \"we are more resolved to be our fon's 800 eyes as well as his 800 shields. We desire neither state protection nor cover from the separatist fighters.\" He further mentioned that \"the fon of Nso must be allowed to his people, and not tossed about just like anyone.\"\n\nThis position has been expressed by many others who think politicians from both sides of the warring camps should stay off the throne. In fact, in its outing of October 14th 2020, the Nwerong had decreed that the palace is for everyone, however, that everyone coming close to the throne must do so as natural persons, keeping away their political affiliations or ideologies.\n\nThe current dispensation puts the fon on a hot seat as leader, to cement the unity amongst his people, a thing he was seen to initiate when he spoke to his people on 5 November. “let us forge on as one, in a true covenant of love.” True collaboration from all sons of Nso could well put this through. And like Bernard Fonlon questioned: “Shall Nso MAKE of MAR?"
