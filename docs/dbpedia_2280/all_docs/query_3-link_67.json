        "text": "For his personal arms, Archbishop Naumann has selected a design that reflects his service as priest and bishop.\n\nOn a single blue field, the design is composed of two main sections reflecting the two most significant aspects of Archbishop Naumann's life. In the lower portion of the design are displayed two stalks of wheat coming forth from three loaves of golden bread. This symbol is employed first to acknowledge the primacy of the Eucharist in the life of the Church and in the ministry of the priest, and secondly because Archbishop's great-grandfather, two great-uncles and a grandfather were all bakers. This charge is placed above a silver carpenter's square to honor his baptismal patron, St. Joseph, and in combining the square with the loaves, His Excellency honors the heritage of his parents, Fred and Louise (Lukens) Naumann.\n\nIn the upper portion of the design known as the \"chief\" is seen a cross fleuretty, a cross with arms that end in fleur-de-lis. This symbol of the faith is taken from the arms of the Archdiocese of St. Louis which His Excellency has served as a priest and an auxiliary bishop. On this cross is placed a red rose, representing Mary, Mother of the Church as well as model and guardian for priests, and the symbol of the Pro-Life movement to which Archbishop Naumann has dedicated a good part of his life and ministry.\n\nThis theme of life is carried forward in the choice of Archbishop Naumann's motto, taken from the encyclical of Pope John Paul II, Evangelium vitae—The Gospel of Life. The Latin Motto, VITAE VICTORIA ERIT translates LIFE WILL BE VICTORIOUS. By use of this phrase, His Excellency expresses the conviction that Jesus' triumph over death is absolute, and that, despite the trials and challenges faced by the Christian, the victory is assured.\n\nThe arms are completed with the external ornaments which include a gold processional cross placed behind the shield which extends above and below the shield, and the pontifical hat, the gallero, with its ten tassels in four rows on either side of the shield, all in green. These are the heraldic insignia of a prelate of the rank of archbishop. The coat of arms was designed and created by Deacon Paul J. Sullivan.\n\nCoat of Arms — Archdiocese of Kansas City in Kansas\n\nThis coat of arms was established shortly after the Diocese of Kansas became an Archdiocese. Originally the Diocese of Kansas City was known as the Diocese of Leavenworth. The heraldic tower, the heraldic equivalent of a fortress, refers to the fact that Leavenworth was originally a fort. The crescent, the symbol of the Blessed Virgin under the title of the Immaculate Conception, expresses the title of the Cathedral when the see city was Leavenworth. Under this same title Our Lady is Patroness of the United States.\n\nThe \"wavy chevron couched\" emanates from the left side of the shield and represents the junction of the Kansas and Missouri rivers in the See City of Kansas City in Kansas. The Missouri river forms the northeastern boundary of Kansas and of the Archdiocese, while the Kansas river comes from the west and traverses the center of the Archdiocese.\n\nThe reversed cross is the instrument of the martyrdom of St. Peter and it is appropriately placed on a field of red, the liturgical color for the spilling of one's blood for Christ; the martyr Peter is also indicated by the crossed keys, the symbol of the Power of the Keys: \"And I will give to thee the Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven. And whatsoever thou shalt bind upon earth, it shall be bound also in Heaven: (Matthew 16:19). The Petrine chief (upper compartment) designates St. Peter the Apostle as the titular of the Cathedral of the Archdiocese of Kansas City in Kansas."
