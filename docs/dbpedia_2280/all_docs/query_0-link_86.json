        "text": "BPSR recommends: new article published THE AFRICAN AGENDA OF EVANGELICAL CHRISTIANS IN BRAZILIAN FOREIGN POLICY: THE CRISIS OF THE UNIVERSAL CHURCH OF THE KINGDOM OF GOD IN ANGOLA Authors: Magno Klein, Henrique Rabello de Carvalho ABSCTRACT: This paper analyzes the incidence of Evangelical groups in contemporary Brazilian foreign policy, in particular in the search for government support for their missionary presence on the African continent. The paper argues that Evangelicals assumed an important part of Brazil‚Äôs African policy during the Jair Bolsonaro government and that it is necessary to analyze the profile of their activities in order to understand the trajectory of relations between Brazil and African nations in recent decades and the growing influence of non-state actors, especially religious groups. The text addresses the recent crisis experienced by the Universal Church of the Kingdom of God in Angola in 2019 as a case study of the work of evangelical sectors and their influence on Brazil‚Äôs foreign policy for the African continent. Available at: https://lnkd.in/dp6A5AGA\n\nEvery non-Islamic world leader SHOULD be saying this: ‚ÄúMuslims who want to live under Islamic Sharia law should be told to get out of the countries they are occupying, & return to the places they were born. Spy agencies should have the full support of their governments to monitor all of the nation's mosques. 'IMMIGRANTS MUST ADAPT.. Take It Or Leave It. Why should citizens of western nations have to worry about whether we are offending some individual or their culture? It is widely reported that 99% of terrorist attacks worldwide are committed by Shiite Muslims - they need to be removed from Western countries if they cannot learn to behave like normal humans. Western cultures have been developed over many centuries of struggles, trials and victories by millions of men and women who have sought freedom' Culture where mainly ENGLISH, is spoken need to make it clear that if you wish to become part of these societies you must learn the language. For many Western nations there is a belief in God. This is not some Christian, right wing, political push, but a fact, because Christian men and women, on Christian principles, founded these nations, and this is clearly documented. It is certainly appropriate to display it on the walls of schools in Western nations. If God offends you, then you should consider another part of the world as your new home, because God is part of those cultures. We will accept your beliefs, and will not question why. All we demand is that you accept ours, and live in harmony and peaceful enjoyment Western countries & Western lifestyles should not be required to bend to the requirements of immigrants & they need to stop complaining, whining & griping about the host country‚Äôs Flag, Christian beliefs, or way of Life. If you aren't happy here then LEAVE. Nobody forced you to go & live in another country. You asked for it.‚Äù\n\n#luo #hebrew Name Jeje Abraham Even Minister of Foreign Affairs of Uganda shares the name 'Jeje' Odongo; Jeje is a Saphadic surname which have been erased e.g; 'jeje' is the Spanish version of: 'haha'. The Portuguese spread anti ibra sentiments to Asia; e.g; in Philippines 'Jeje' is short for jejemon, which is a term that describes a particular subculture in the Philippines, it is often used in a degoratory manner. Compaign of Hate against the Luo has been going on since the Inquisition. Jeje tells a story; there's a family the Jejeebhoy Baronetcy (sometimes spelled Jeejeebhoy), of Bombay, a title in the Baronetage of the United Kingdom. It was created 6 August 1857 for Sir Jamsetjee Jejeebhoy,a prominent Parsee merchant and philanthropist who was the first Parsi and first Indian to be knighted (1842) and the first to be made a baronet (1857). When Sir Jamsetjee Jejeebhoy was made a baronet, it was realised that the Parsee custom was for a change of names for each generation. This conflicted with the British tradition of using consistent surname for a particular baronetcy. In 1915, the Imperial Legislative Council passed the Sir Jamsetjee Jejeebhoy Baronetcy Act, providing that all the male heirs should take these names and no other. Similar provision was made for subsequent Parsee baronets. All holders of the title relinquish their own names and assume that of the first Baronet. Parsee (also Parsis); there difference with Iberian Peninsula Jews or Saphadic, is that Saphadic are Sons of Sudan; primarily from ancient Egypt and Luo origin people now settled in East Africa. Parsis are originally from Persia similar to certain Luos clans who arrived from present IRAN.They are FIRE WORSHIPERS and as Islam overran Persia they fled Persia and a small group landed on the Gujarat coast and took refuge in India. It is likely that today's Parsis took up the Luo identity following the Luos migration; similar to how Ashkenazim got to be. Jeje either arrived to Africa through west following the expulsion of Luos in Spain and Portugal in 1496, or with a group that arrived fleeing Britain following the defeat of JACOBITES. Battle of Culloden, (April 16, 1746), the last battle of the ‚ÄúForty-five Rebellion,‚Äù when the Jacobites, under Charles Edward, the ‚ÄúBonnie Prince Charlie‚Äù, were defeated by British forces under William Augustus, duke of Cumberland. Charles eventually escaped to France and then Rome, and died in Kenya buried in Luoland. Many of his followers were captured and some executed. Others were forced into exile and had their lands forfeited.The government was determined to eliminate the Jacobite cause once and for all. The Hanoverian victory at Culloden put an end to Jacobitism.‚ÄúBonnie Prince Charlie‚Äù is not the only one buried in Kenya; even Genghis Khan, the Former Khagan of the Mongol Empire. jeje From Yoruba √†j√®j√¨ (‚Äústranger‚Äù); similarly the Dinka in South Sudan call the Luo's as Jur Chol; which means a 'black stranger'\n\nTo all individuals who advocate for the cause commonly referred to as \"free Palestine\": It is pertinent to note that historically, Gaza has been under the jurisdiction and ownership of Egypt, rather than being part of any region considered \"disputed.\"(and was offered back to Egypt as part of the peace accord, witch they declined to take back‚Ä¶) Addressing my acquaintances - encompassing Americans, Europeans, educators, and individuals within the realm of Hollywood who uphold moral principles: I hold profound esteem for those who champion principles of equality, justice, and the safeguarding of lives, irrespective of the individual involved. Nevertheless, it appears that you have become embroiled in a meticulously orchestrated and financially backed \"movement,\" necessitating a comprehensive comprehension of the cause you are endorsing. This knowledge does not stem from clandestine intelligence sources or governmental espionage. It is openly articulated by the leaders of these protests. I urge you to lend an ear, not to the unwitting participants manipulated on college campuses, but to the genuine instigators of discord who have orchestrated this agenda over an extended period and received remuneration from the most nefarious alliances and entities globally. The primary aim of this movement is to institute a transformation towards a regime characterized by religious extremism, all governed by Islamic law, commonly referred to as \"Sharia law.\" Your current actions are propelling us towards a future fraught with obscurity, where the female progeny of your descendants may be compelled to don burkas and forfeit their fundamental rights. I implore you not to solely rely on my assertions. I urge you to undertake the following: - Conduct a simple inquiry into the declarations made by the genuine leaders of this movement. - Familiarize yourself with the historical accounts detailing the prevailing circumstances in the majority of countries governed by Islamic principles. Should you genuinely espouse this trajectory, then so be it. Nevertheless, it will be you and your progeny who will be etched in history as advocates for malevolence. ü§∑üèº‚ôÇÔ∏è\n\nHISTORICAL facts alignment üí° When people demand ‚ÄúFREE PALESTINE‚Äù, they base on the fact that there was a Palestinian STATE conquered by Israel. Was it?? Let‚Äôs align on HISTORICAL facts: 1) Before the modern state of Israel, there was a British mandate, NOT a Palestinian state. 2) before the British mandate The Ottoman Empire existed, NOT the Palestinian state. 3) Before the Ottoman Empire, there was the Islamic Mamluk state of Egypt, NOT the Palestinian state. 4) Before the Islamic state of Mamluk of Egypt, the Ayyubid empire existed, NOT the Palestinian state. Gopher IV of Bolanski, known as Godfrey de Bouillon, conquered Jerusalem in 1099. 5) Before Ayyubid's empire there existed the Christian Kingdom of Jerusalem, NOT the Palestinian state. 6) Before the Kingdom of Jerusalem there were Umayyad and Fatimid empires, NOT the Palestinian state. 7) Before the Umayyad and Fatimid empires, there was the Byzantine Empire, NOT the Palestinian state.

In fact, this corner of the earth had everything but the Palestinian state. Thank you @Aviv Kantor for sharing this history review. #history #middleeast"
