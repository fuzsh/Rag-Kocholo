        "text": "Topline\n\nThe Vatican excommunicated Archbishop Carlo Maria Viganò—an ultraconservative critic of Pope Francis—after finding him guilty of schism for refusing to recognize Francis’ authority, the church said in a statement Friday, following years of Viganò criticizing the pope in harsh terms—and accusing the pope in 2018 of being aware of sexual misconduct.\n\nKey Facts\n\nMembers of the Vatican’s doctrinal office said it imposed the penalty Thursday after finding Viganò guilty of schism, which occurs when someone refuses to submit to the pope or to communion with other Catholics under the pope.\n\nViganò was informed of the decision Friday, according to the doctrinal office’s statement.\n\nBeing excommunicated means Viganò is formally outside of the Roman Catholic Church and can no longer partake in its sacraments, and can only be reversed if the pope issues a high ruling with the doctrinal office.\n\nViganò, one of Pope Francis’ most vocal critics, was put on trial late last month—but he said it was “an honor” to be accused of rejecting the Second Vatican Ecumenical Council, a set of church reforms in the 1960s controversial among some conservatives, in a lengthy and defiant statement on June 28.\n\nThe former archbishop notably called on Pope Francis to resign in 2018 after accusing him of being aware of sexual misconduct in the church.\n\nKey Background\n\nViganò was appointed by Francis’ predecessor Pope Benedict XVI to serve as the Vatican’s ambassador to the U.S. in 2011, reportedly siding with conservatives against same-sex marriage until he retired in 2016. His hardline stance clashed at times with Francis, who has eased some of the church’s positions on LGBTQ issues and clashed with more conservative church leaders—though Francis has not backed same-sex marriage and reportedly used a homophobic slur on at least two occasions. The former ambassador also alleged in a 2018 bombshell letter former Pope Benedict and Pope Francis, as well as other top officials, knew about the sexual misconduct of former D.C. archbishop Cardinal Theodore McCarrick prior to his resignation, calling on Pope Francis to resign. Pope Francis said he would “not say a single word” in response to Viganò’s resignation call, CNN reported. Viganò reportedly went into hiding in 2019. In recent years, Viganò has increasingly become more conservative, according to the Associated Press, namely for refusing to recognize Pope Francis and endorsing conspiracy theories about Covid-19 vaccines.\n\nFurther Reading\n\nPapal arch enemy Archbishop Vigano found guilty of schism and excommunicated (Reuters)\n\nItalian archbishop says he faces Vatican trial over Pope Francis criticism (The Guardian)\n\nFormer Vatican ambassador says Popes Francis, Benedict knew of sexual misconduct allegations against McCarrick for years (The Washington Post)\n\nHe called on the pope to resign.
