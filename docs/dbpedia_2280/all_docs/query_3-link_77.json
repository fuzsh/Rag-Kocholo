Comiskey submitted his resignation to Pope John Paul II in April 2002, two weeks after the BBC aired \"Suing the Pope,\" a documentary about Comiskey's protection of serial sex offender Sean Fortune and that priest's rape of Colm O'Gorman and other boys in the 1980s. Despite learning of allegations against Fortune almost as soon as he took the helm of Ferns in 1984, Comiskey kept the priest in ministry until 1995, when O'Gorman went to the police, and the priest was criminally charged with 66 counts of molesting eight children. The state-commissioned investigation of the Ferns diocese later would show that even before Fortune's ordination in 1979, the Church had received reports from multiple victims. (Fortune committed suicide, leaving a note that claimed Comiskey had sexually abused him.) In a public statement immediately following Comiskey's resignation, the Vatican cited canon 401, paragraph 2, an indication that the bishop's departure wasn't voluntary. That canon says: \"A diocesan bishop who has become less able to fulfill his office because of ill health or some other grave cause is earnestly requested to present his resignation from office.\"\n\nComiskey's Career History, catholic-hierarchy.org\n\nSuing the Pope, BBC News, 03.19.2002\n\nTranscript of \"Suing the Pope,\" BBC News, 03.19.2002\n\nBishop Resigns over Handling of Sex Case, BBC News, 04.01.2002\n\nComiskey's Statement of Resignation, 04.01.2002, RTÉ\n\nJoint Statement of Archbishop Sean Brady and Desmond Cardinal Connell, Irish Catholic Bishops' Conference, 04.05.2002\n\nVatican Announcement Regarding Diocese of Ferns, Irish Catholic Bishops' Conference, 04.06.2002\n\nIrish Bishop Was Forced to Quit by Vatican, by Nicola Byrne, The Observer, 01.26.2003\n\nThe Ferns Report, by Francis D.

Along with his fellow auxiliary bishop Eamonn Walsh, Field submitted his resignation under pressure on Christmas Eve, 2009, one month after the Murphy Report implicated him in the Dublin archdiocese's cover-up of child sexual abuse by priests and religious. In a joint written statement with Walsh, Field said, \"It is our hope that our action may help to bring the peace and reconciliation of Jesus Christ to the victims/survivors of child sexual abuse. We again apologise to them.\" In August 2010, Archbishop Diarmuid Martin announced that Pope Benedict XVI had refused to accept the resignations of Field and Walsh. (However, Benedict did accept the resignations of James Moriarty and Donal Murray, the two other bishops to resign in the wake of the Murphy report.) As of 2015, Field is still auxiliary bishop of Dublin.\n\nField's Career History, catholic-hierarchy.org\n\nCommission of Investigation: Report into the Catholic Archdiocese of Dublin [\"Murphy Report\"], by Judge Yvonne Murphy, Ms. Ita Mangan, and Mr. Hugh O'Neill, 11.26.2009\n\nTwo Irish Catholic Bishops Resign over Church Cover-Up of Child Abuse, Associated Press [appearing in The Guardian], 12.25.2009\n\nBishops' Statement, The Irish Times, 12.28.2009\n\nIreland Confronts Its Sex Abuse Crisis, by Tom Roberts, National Catholic Reporter, 12.30.2009\n\nBishop Resignations: Timeline of Events, Irish Times, 08.11.2010\n\nPope Declines Resignation of Dublin Auxiliary Bishops, by Michael Kelly, Catholic News Service [appearing in NCR], 08.12.2010\n\nBishop Robert Finn\n\nJul 1979 Ordained priest Mar 2004 Appointed Coadjutor Bishop of Kansas City-Saint Joseph, Missouri, USA May 2005 Succeeded Bishop of Kansas City-Saint Joseph, Missouri, USA Apr 2015 Resignation accepted by Pope Francis (Finn was age 62.0)\n\nUnited States. In September 2012 Finn was convicted of violating the state of Missouri’s mandatory child abuse reporting statute . Finn had chosen not to report the diocese’s December 2010 discovery of sexually graphic photographs of little girls found on the laptop of diocesan priest Shawn Ratigan. (Of the hundreds of photos, only four or five had been downloaded from the Internet; the rest apparently had been taken by Ratigan himself with a personal camera.) Finn removed Ratigan from his parish but did not tell parishioners why. He sent the priest to Pennsylvania to be evaluated. When Ratigan returned in February 2011, he was made chaplain for the Franciscan Sisters at the Franciscan Prayer Center in Independence MO. Finn placed Ratigan under seven restrictions, including avoiding contact with children, but he also allowed the priest to say Mass for youth groups \"on a 'trial' basis.\" Finn did not assign anyone to monitor Ratigan. Ratigan’s unwitting former parishioners reached out to him, and some invited him to gatherings which included children. On one such occasion Ratigan took upskirt pictures of a 10-year-old girl with his cell phone underneath the table during dinner with her family.\n\nThe police finally were notified in May 2011 by Finn’s vicar general, Msgr. Robert Murphy. Murphy later testified that the bishop was “upset” when he learned that law enforcement had been contacted; Murphy said he told his sister, “I think I made a decision that will not make the bishop happy.” In August 2012 Ratigan pleaded guilty to producing and attempting to produce child pornography and subsequently was sentenced to 50 years in prison.\n\nA month after Ratigan's conviction, Finn was convicted, and sentenced to two years' court-supervised probation. He remained in place as Kansas City-Saint Joseph bishop, resulting in a firestorm of criticism, protest and persistent calls for his resignation. In September 2014 the Vatican's Congregation of Bishops sent a representative (Ottawa archbishop Terrence Prendergast) to Missouri to investigate Finn's leadership. In April 2015 Pope Francis accepted Finn's resignation. While no specific reason was given, canon 401, paragraph 2 was cited . It says \"A diocesan bishop who has become less able to fulfill his office because of ill health or some other grave cause is earnestly requested to present his resignation from office.\"\n\nIn December 2015 Finn assumed the role of chaplain for the School Sisters of Christ the King in the Diocese of Lincoln, NE. He had been appointed by Lincoln Bishop James Conley.\n\nFinn's Career History, catholic-hierarchy.org\n\nAssignment Record - Rev.

Galván's resignation was accepted by Pope Francis in June 2015, per canon 401, paragraph 2 . His resignation came the day after Autlán priest Francisco Javier García Rodriguez was arrested and charged with raping an 11-year-old girl and fondling five others. Galván had received reports in 2013 regarding García, but did nothing until restricting his ministry in January 2015. Galván is said to have also protected another one of his priests, Rev. Horacio López, who was accused in 2009 of raping an 11-year-old boy in 2002. Galván moved López in 2010 to a parish in Tecolotlán, Jalisco, and again in 2013 to the Diocese of Leon. López was still in active ministry in August 2015.\n\nAfter resigning, Galván relocated to Leon, where he was officiating Mass in the Parish of the Holy Spirit.\n\nGalván's Career History, catholic-hierarchy.org\n\nGonzalo Galván Castillo Será Nombrado Obispo “El Obispo Renunció por Cuestiones de Salud”: Asegura Vicario General Interino, Por Carmen Aggi Cabrera, 06.25.2015\n\nPriest, 'family friend,' accused of abuse, Mexico Daily News, 06.29.2015\n\nThe Vatican Shakeup Continues: Two More Bishops Resign, By Ruth Gledhill, Christian Today\n\n07.16.2015\n\nPope Francis has Removed Some Bishops Immersed in Sex Abuse Scandals, but He’s Also Offered Them Comfort and Called Accusers Dumb, By Mary Duan, Monterey County Weekly, 10.27.2015\n\nDaily Press Bulletin Announcing Galván's Removal and Replacement, Vatican, 06.25.2015\n\nInvestigan si ex Obispo Encubrió a Pederastas, por Jesús García, 02.20.2016\n\nCode of Canon Law, Canons Pertaining to Diocesan Bishops, Vatican website (see 401.2)\n\nBishop Seamus Hegarty\n\nJun 1966 Ordained priest Feb 1982 Appointed Bishop of Raphoe, Ireland Oct 1994 Appointed Bishop of Derry, Ireland Nov 2011 Resignation accepted by Pope Benedict XVI (Hegarty was age 71.8)\n\nIreland. Pope Benedict XVI accepted Hegarty's resignation in November 2011, shortly before the publication of a church-commissioned report on clergy sex abuse in the diocese of Raphoe. The church had received the report several months earlier. It revealed Hegarty's mishandling of pedophile priests while bishop of Raphoe from 1982 to 1994. Four of Hegarty's priests were eventually convicted. While acknowledging \"deficits\" in his response to allegations, Hegarty denied ever being told of the abusive behavior of the most notorious of the four, Rev. Eugene Greene, who molested at least 26 children and was sentenced to prison in 2000. The Vatican's brief announcement on Hegarty's resignation said it was in accordance with canon 401, paragraph 2 : \"A diocesan bishop who has become less able to fulfill his office because of ill health or some other grave cause is earnestly requested to present his resignation from office.\" Hegarty said it was due to an \"irreversible and progressive\" illness.

In a January 2002 investigative report, the Boston Globe revealed extensive clergy sexual abuse of children and cover-up by the Boston archdiocese under Law's leadership. The report showed Law's awareness in 1984 that Rev. John Geoghan was a child molester, including of 7 young boys in one family; Geoghan was allowed to remain in ministry. (Geoghan was convicted in 2002 of the abuse of one boy, and was murdered in prison.) Documents showed Law kept Rev. Paul Shanley in ministry, despite knowledge that he was a danger to children, and that he advocated sex between men and boys. (Shanley was convicted in 2005 of sexually abusing a boy in the 1980s.) Public reaction was explosive and led to a tumultuous year of protests, with attempts at damage control by the archdiocese. Calls for Law's removal by Catholic laity and wealthy donors grew in momentum through the year. On December 3, 2002 the lawyer for a Shanley victim made public eight priest files which showed particularly egregious abuse by Boston priests and cover-up by Cardinal Law. In the next nine days Law was served a subpoena, more files were released, protesters thronged the cathedral, and 58 Boston priests signed a letter calling for their archbishop to step down. Law fled to Rome, where he announced on December 13 that Pope John Paul II had accepted his resignation. The Vatican did not link Law's removal to his cover-up of child sexual abuse. A brief Vatican announcement said only that Law's resignation had been accepted in accordance with canon 401, paragraph 2 . Law was appointed archpriest of Rome's Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore in May 2004. He retired in November 2011, and died December 20, 2017.\n\nLaw's Career History,\n\ncatholic-hierarchy.org\n\nChurch Allowed Abuse by Priest for Years.

Opus Dei member. Livieres promoted Rev. Carlos Urrutigoity to vicar general even after having been warned by the priest's previous bishop, Joseph Martino of Scranton PA, that Urrutigoity was \"a serious threat to young people.\" The Scranton diocese settled a lawsuit against Urrutigoity in 2004. The ultra-conservative Livieres long clashed with his fellow his fellow bishops. Pope Francis sent a delegation to Paraguay to investigate in July 2014, and Livieres was removed in September of that year. The termination of Livieres differs in two interesting respects from others cited in this report: the canon law typically cited in these situations -- canon 401, paragraph 2 -- was not invoked; and the Vatican took the unusual step of issuing an explanation. The Vatican notice said \"This was a difficult decision on the part of the Holy See, taken for serious pastoral reasons and for the greater good of the unity of the Church in Ciudad del Este and the episcopal communion in Paraguay.\" Plano died August 14, 2015 in Buenos Aires.\n\nLivieres' Career History, catholic-hierarchy.org\n\nDaily Press Bulletin Announcing Livieres' Removal and Replacement, Vatican, 09.25.2014\n\nPress Bulletin Explaining the Pope's Reasons for Replacing Livieres, Vatican, 9.25.2014\n\nFrancis Removes Bishop Under Cloud in Paraguay, by Gaia Pianigiani and Laurie Goodstein, 09.25.2014\n\nBreakaway Opus Dei Bishop Removed by Pope, by Nicole Winfield, Toronto Star\n\n09.25.2014\n\nParaguayan Bishop Who Shielded Priest Abuser Removed From Office, by Dennis Coday, National Catholic Reporter, 09.25.2014\n\nVatican says Paraguayan Bishop's Dismissal Not the Result of Sex Abuse, Francis X.

Moriarty was one of four current or former Dublin bishops who resigned in the wake of the November 2009 publication of the Murphy Report, the state-run investigation that found decades of systematic cover-up of sexually abusive priests by the Dublin archdiocese. Moriarty was implicated in the case of Fr. Edmondus, a pseudonym for the serial abuser who molested current papal commission member Marie Collins and many other children. In 1993, as auxiliary bishop of Dublin, Moriarty received a complaint that Fr. Edmondus had sexually abused sick children at a hospital 30 years earlier. Moriarty chose neither to investigate nor ask the archbishop if he could check the priest's file, which contained prior complaints. Fr. Edmondus remained in ministry for years. In interviews immediately after the release of the Murphy Report, Moriarty said he would not resign, explaining that the fault rested with his then-superior, Archbishop Desmond Connell, to whom Moriarty had conveyed the complaint. But by the end of December 2009, Moriarty submitted his resignation, stating that he \"should have challenged the prevailing culture.\" Pope Benedict XVI accepted his resignation in April 2010. (The three other Dublin bishops to resign in response to the Murphy Report were Field, Murray, and Walsh; Murray's resignation was also accepted, but Benedict rejected the resignations of Field and Walsh.) In announcing the pope's acceptance of Moriarty's resignation, the Vatican cited canon 401, paragraph 2 : \"A diocesan bishop who has become less able to fulfill his office because of ill health or some other grave cause is earnestly requested to present his resignation from office.\"\n\nMoriarty's Career History, catholic-hierarchy.org\n\nCommission of Investigation: Report into the Catholic Archdiocese of Dublin [\"Murphy Report\"], by Judge Yvonne Murphy, Ms. Ita Mangan, and Mr. Hugh O'Neill, 11.26.2009\n\nNo Grounds to Resign, Says Bishop Moriarty, by Patsy McGarry, The Irish Times, 12.11.2009\n\nUnder Pressure Bishop Moriarty Rules Out Resignation, Offaly Express, 12.16.2009\n\nSecond Catholic Bishop Resigns, UTV, 12.23.2009\n\nResignation Letter \"A Step Forward\", Says Victim Acceptance of Collusion \"Huge\", by Genevieve Carbery\n\nThe Irish Times\n\n12.24.2009\n\nBishop Moriarty Outlines Reasons for Resignation, Offaly Express, 12.30.2009\n\nIrish Bishop Resigns, Says He Didn't Report Abuse, by Nicole Winfield, Associated Press, 04.22.2010\n\nCode of Canon Law, Canons Pertaining to Diocesan Bishops, Vatican website (see 401.2)\n\nBishop Ronald Mulkearns\n\nJul 1956 Ordained priest Sep 1968 Appointed Coadjutor Bishop of Ballarat, Australia May 1971 Succeeded Bishop of Ballarat, Australia May 1997 Resignation accepted by Pope John Paul II (Mulkearns was age 66.5)\n\nAustralia. Mulkearns submitted his resignation to Pope John Paul II at age 66 in 1997, two years after he was investigated by police for covering up the crimes of pedophile priest Gerald Ridsdale, who raped and sexually abused more than 50 children, some as young as age four. Investigators found that Mulkearns had known of Ridsdale's crimes since 1975 but kept the priest in ministry for years and did not report him to the police. In his resignation statement, Mulkearns cited the \"draining effect\" of the public uproar over his handling of Ridsdale and other abusers. It is not known whether the Vatican forced Mulkearns' departure. In 2013, his successor, Bishop Peter Connors, conceded Mulkearns' wrongdoing to a Victorian parliamentary inquiry on child sexual abuse, adding, “He retired early before his time because of being over-burdened by all this.\" During the Royal Commission's hearings on child sexual abuse in Ballarat, convicted priest Paul Ryan said Mulkearns knew he was abusing children in 1977, but did nothing. Ryan was removed from ministry in 1993.

Pope Benedict XVI accepted Murray's resignation in December 2009 in accordance with canon 401, paragraph 2 . A month earlier, the Murphy Report had been published. It called Murray's failure as Dublin auxiliary bishop to address suspicions of abuse by Rev. Tom Naughton in the 1980s \"inexcusable.\" Naughton was sent to prison in 1998 and again in 2009 for sexually abusing boys in the 1980s.\n\nMurray's Career History, catholic-hierarchy.org\n\nCommission of Investigation: Report into the Catholic Archdiocese of Dublin [\"Murphy Report\"], by Judge Yvonne Murphy, Ms. Ita Mangan, and Mr. Hugh O'Neill, 11.26.2009\n\nDaily Press Bulletin Announcing Murray's Resignation, Vatican, 12.17.2009\n\nIrish bishop Donal Murray Resigns over Abuse Report, BBC, 12.17.2009\n\nCode of Canon Law, Canons Pertaining to Diocesan Bishops, Vatican website (see 401.2)\n\nArchbishop John Clayton Nienstedt\n\nUnited States. In April 2013 Nienstedt's Chancellor for Canonical Affairs, Jennifer Haselberger, resigned after her warnings to Nienstedt and other archdiocesan officials about problem priests were ignored. Haselberger had sent Nienstedt copies of what appeared to be child pornography found on Rev. Jonathan Shelley's computer; Nienstedt did not call police. Nienstedt is also said to have prior knowledge of inappropriate sexual behavior by Rev. Curtis Wehmeyer, who was convicted in 2012 of child sexual abuse and possession of child pornography. Further, Rev. Kenneth LaVan was allowed to remain an active priest despite accusations that he sexually assaulted a 16-year-old girl, engaged in sexual misconduct with married parishioners, spent lavish amounts of money on lovers, and had a diagnosis of \"compulsive sexuality.\" Nienstedt later would deny that he knew LaVan was still in public ministry; however, archdiocesan files show that he had approved LaVan for ministry yearly, including the previous year. See Haselberger's affidavit for detailed accounts of alleged mismanagement by Nienstedt and others.\n\nWhile facing pressure to resign because of cover-up, Nienstedt himself was accused publicly in December 2013 of touching a boy's buttocks in 2009. Calling the allegation \"entirely false,\" he temporarily stepped aside. He resumed duties March 2014 after the prosecutor said there would no charges due to insufficient evidence. In July 2014, news media revealed that Nienstedt had commissioned an internal investigation of his alleged sexual misconduct toward adults. The investigators reportedly found that Nienstedt made \"sexual advances\" toward at least two priests. Nienstedt kept the findings secret and, according to the MPR report, authorized a new investigation by a second law firm.\n\nOn June 5, 2015, County Attorney John Choi announced criminal charges against the Archdiocese of St. Paul and Minneapolis on six gross misdemeanor counts of failure to protect children in the Wehmeyer case. On June 15, 2015 Pope Francis accepted the resignations, in accordance with canon 401, paragraph 2 , of both Nienstedt and Auxiliary Bishop Lee Piché. The pope did not issue any explanation for the resignations. Nienstedt's new title is Saint Paul and Minneapolis MN archbishop emeritus.\n\nIn January 2016 it was announced at St. Philip's in Battle Creek MN, a parish in the Diocese of Kalamazoo, that Nienstedt would be assisting there for about six months while St. Philip's pastor, a friend of Nienstedt, underwent treatment for some health issues. Diocesan officials said Nienstedt was a priest in good standing and was welcome in the diocese. Parishioners, community members and survivors of clergy sexual abuse immediately and loudly objected; two weeks later Nienstedt left the diocese, and Kalamazoo bishop Paul Bradley publicly expressed regret that he had not anticipated the public's reaction to Nienstedt's presence.\n\nNienstedt's Career History, catholic-hierarchy.org\n\nUnder Fire, Archbishop Nienstedt Scrambles to Respond, by Jean Hopfensperger, Star Tribune, 10.06.2013\n\nLetter from Archbishop Nienstedt Regarding Allegation, Roman Catholic Archdiocese of St. Paul and Minneapolis\n\n12.17.2013\n\nNienstedt, Facing Claim He Touched Boy, Steps Aside during Investigation, Denies Allegation, by Tom Scheck, Laura Yuen, Mike Cronin, Minnesota Public Radio, 12.17.2013\n\nArchbishop Nienstedt Will Not Be Charged after Being Accused of Touching Boy, by Chao Xiong, Star Tribune\n\n03.11.2014\n\nStatement Regarding Archbishop John\n\nNienstedt , archspm.org,\n\nTuesday, 03.11.2014\n\nInsufficient Evidence to Charge Archbishop John Nienstedt in Alleged Groping Incident Reported by Priest, by Dennis Gerhardstein, Office of the Ramsey County Attorney\n\n03.12.2014\n\nDeposition of Archbishop John Nienstedt, Deposition Taken 04.02.14, Released 04.22.14 by Jeff Anderson & Associates\n\nArchbishop Nienstedt Under Investigation, by Grant Gallicho, Commonweal Magazine\n\n07.01.2014\n\nAffidavit of Jennifer M.

Pagotto was the subject of a Vatican investigation in 2015 after charges he accepted into the archdiocese priests and seminiarians rejected by other dioceses for suspected pedophilia. During the investigation he was banned from ordaining new deacons and priests or taking in new seminarians. Pagotto had also been accused of sexual misconduct with an 18-year-old male.

In 1990 the Winter report, which was the result of St. John's Archdiocesan inquiry into child sexual abuse by clergy, commissioned by Penney, revealed that Penney knew of and failed to prevent abuse of children in the archdiocese for years. Within a 2 1/2-year period more than 20 priests and religious brothers were charged with or convicted of child sexual abuse; their victims included altar boys and boys living at the Christian Brothers' Mount Cashel orphanage. Penney announced his resignation the day the printed Winter report became public, on July 18, 1990. He had been under public pressure to step down since 1988. The Vatican sent two representatives to the archdiocese in October 1990 to investigate - Bishop Roger Ebacher, Bishop of Gatineau-Hull, and Rev. James Weisgerber, secretary of the Canadian Conference of Catholic Bishops. The representatives commented that the Pope did not think the Winter report was enough to warrant Penney's resignation; Catholics of the archdiocese responded with public protests. Pope John Paul II accepted Penney's resignation February 2, 1991.\n\nPenney's Career History, catholic-hierarchy.org\n\nWinter Report, 06.1990\n\nArchbishop Resigns Over Sexual Abuse Report, United Press International\n\n07.18.1990\n\nCanadian Prelate Quits In Clerics' Sex Scandal,\n\nby John F.

Piché served as Vicar General of the Archdiocese of St. Paul and Minneapolis from May 2008 until July 1, 2009. He was appointed Auxiliary Bishop in May 2009. Prior to his promotions, as a parish pastor in 2001, Piché was placed in charge of newly ordained priest Rev. Curtis Wehmeyer, who was assigned to Piché's parish and about whom there had already been concerns. In 2004 Wehmeyer received a police citation for loitering in a park that was known as a place where men engaged in anonymous sex. That same year there were complaints to Piché that Wehmeyer was spending a lot of time in the parish school's bathroom. Further, Piché was told by one priest that Wehmeyer had taken two boys camping and said, \"I think you have a predator on your hands.\" Piche's response was that he thought Wehmeyer could be a good priest. Another reported to Piché in August 2010 that in he found Wehmeyer in bed with a boy at a campsite. Piché responded, \"Father Curt Wehmeyer has many skeletons in his closet.\" Wehmeyer was convicted in 2012 of child sexual abuse and possession of child pornography.\n\nOn June 5, 2015 County Attorney John Choi announced criminal charges against the Archdiocese of St. Paul and Minneapolis on six gross misdemeanor counts of failure to protect children. On June 15, 2015 Pope Francis accepted the resignations, in accordance with canon 401, paragraph 2 , of both Lee and Archbishop Nienstedt. The pope did not issue any explanation for the resignations.

In the early 1990s one of Rey's priests, Mario Napoleón Sasso, was diagnosed with pedophilia. Rev. Sasso was sent to a treatment center in Rey's diocese of Zarate-Campana for two years in the mid-1990s; he was released in 1998 with strict orders never to be in the company of children.\n\nIn 2001, despite knowing Sasso's problem, Bishop Rey assigned Sasso to work at an impoverished parish in the city of Pilar, where Sasso was the sole priest and in charge of a community soup kitchen which was frequented by children. In 2003 a soup kitchen worker reported to the diocesan vicar that Sasso had sexually abused a girl there. The vicar reportedly told Rey, who did nothing. The kitchen worker and priest-psychiatrist, Luiz Guzmán, then went to law enforcement; on December 1, 2003 an order was issued for Sasso's arrest. Aided by the vicar and another priest, Sasso fled the country, but was captured in January 2004. The two priests who abetted his escape were charged with aggravated concealment; they eventually admitted partial guilt and were given probation. Bishop Rey was not charged by civil authorities, but in February 2006, his resignation at age 72 (three years before normal retirement age) was announced by the Vatican. The brief notice said that Pope Benedict XVI had accepted his resignation in accordance with canon 401, paragraph 2 . Sasso was convicted in 2007 of first-degree sexual abuse of five girls, ages 5 to 12, and sentenced to 17 years in prison.\n\nRey's Career History, catholic-hierarchy.org\n\nDaily Press Bulletin Announcing Rey's Resignation, Vatican, 02.03.2006\n\nPedophile Priest: Church Assures that It Already Removed a Bishop, by Sergio Rubín Clarín\n\n11.14.2007\n\nCode of Canon Law, Canons Pertaining to Diocesan Bishops, Vatican website (see 401.2)\n\nPope Francis and Clergy Sexual Abuse in Argentina, [Sasso entry], bishopaccountability.org\n\nBishop Eamonn Oliver Walsh\n\nApr 1969 Ordained priest Mar 1990 Appointed Auxiliary Bishop of Dublin, Ireland Dec 2009 Submitted resignation Aug 2010 Resignation rejected by Pope Benedict XVI Apr 2015 Remains Auxiliary Bishop of Dublin, Ireland\n\nIreland.

Walsh was implicated in the Murphy Report in 2009, which detailed the Dublin archdiocese's cover-up of child sexual abuse by priests and religious. In a public response to the report, Archbishop Diarmuid Martin called the abuse accounts \"revolting\" and the failures of supervisors, including Walsh, \"devastating.\" Along with his fellow auxiliary bishop Raymond Field, Walsh submitted his resignation on Christmas Eve, 2009, one month after the Murphy Report was released. In a joint written statement with Field, Walsh said, \"It is our hope that our action may help to bring the peace and reconciliation of Jesus Christ to the victims/survivors of child sexual abuse. We again apologise to them.\" In August 2010, Archbishop Martin announced that Pope Benedict XVI had refused to accept the resignations of Walsh and Field. (However, Benedict did accept the resignations of James Moriarty and Donal Murray, the two other bishops to resign in the wake of the Murphy report.) In 2013 Martin made Walsh the head of the Office for Clergy in the Dublin Archdiocese.\n\nWalsh's Career History, catholic-hierarchy.org\n\nCommission of Investigation: Report into the Catholic Archdiocese of Dublin [\"Murphy Report\"], by Judge Yvonne Murphy, Ms. Ita Mangan, and Mr. Hugh O'Neill, 11.26.2009\n\nComments of Archbishop Diarmuid Martin in Response to the Murphy Report, 11.26.2009\n\nJump or Get Pushed: After Murphy, Martin Declares War, by Rocco Palmo, Whispers in the Loggia, 12.22.2009\n\nTwo Irish Catholic Bishops Resign over Church Cover-Up of Child Abuse, Associated Press [appearing in The Guardian], 12.25.2009\n\nBishops' Statement, The Irish Times, 12.28.2009\n\nIreland Confronts Its Sex Abuse Crisis, by Tom Roberts, National Catholic Reporter, 12.30.2009\n\nBishop Resignations: Timeline of Events, Irish Times, 08.11.2010\n\nPope Declines Resignation of Dublin Auxiliary Bishops, by Michael Kelly, Catholic News Service [appearing in NCR], 08.12.2010\n\nBishop Criticised after Murphy Report Gets Additional Responsibilities, RTE News, 09.11.2013\n\nBishop Daniel Francis Walsh\n\nMar 1963 Ordained priest Jun 1981 Appointed Auxiliary Bishop of San Francisco, California, USA Jun 1987 Appointed Bishop of Reno-Las Vegas, Nevada, USA Mar 1995 Appointed Bishop of Las Vegas, Nevada, USA Apr 2000 Appointed Bishop of Santa Rosa in California, USA Jun 2011 Resignation accepted by Pope Benedict XVI (Walsh was age 73.7)\n\nUnited States.

By the time Walsh reported the abuse to Child Protective Services, Ochoa had fled to his native Mexico. Walsh avoided criminal charges by agreeing to participate in a four-month counseling program. In 2007, Walsh settled with 10 victims of Ochoa for more than $5 million. In January 2011, the Vatican appointed Robert Vasa to be co-adjutor bishop of Santa Rosa, and in June 2011, the Vatican announced that Pope Benedict XVI had accepted Walsh's resignation.
