        "text": "St Augustine established the See of Canterbury in 597 after coming to Britain from Rome; bringing the Christian faith to southern England.\n\nAs senior bishop of the Church of England, the Archbishop of Canterbury has crowned most monarchs over the past 1,000 years.\n\nThe first detailed coronation service is thought to have been drawn up by St Dunstan, Archbishop of Canterbury, for the grand coronation of Edgar, first King of All England, at Bath Abbey in 973.\n\nThere have been occasions when someone other than the Archbishop of Canterbury has crowned the sovereign, normally when the Archbishop has been indisposed or the See was vacant, but this has not happened in recent times.\n\nThe Archbishop is senior bishop of the Church of England, Primate of All England and spiritual leader of the worldwide Anglican Communion."
