He has previously been the Auxiliary Bishop of Auckland since March 2020.\n\nBishop Michael was born in Cambridge and raised in Tokoroa, the son of Henk and Maureen Gielen and the oldest of six siblings.\n\nAfter studying at Holy Cross College in Mosgiel he was ordained as a priest in 1997 in Tokoroa by Bishop Max Mariu, SM, (the first Māori Catholic bishop of New Zealand). He has been a priest for 24 years serving in Gisborne, Hamilton, Steubenville – USA, Mt Maunganui, Rome – Italy, and Director of Formation at Holy Cross Seminary before being appointed Auxiliary Bishop of Auckland in 2020. The deacon at his Auckland ordination Mass in March 2020 was his father, Deacon Henk Gielen.\n\nBishop Michael counts his Catholic faith and his family as the greatest blessings of his life; through them he has come to know Jesus in the most profound way. Sharing this Good News is his life’s work.\n\nHe is also a keen cyclist. In 2015 he and eight seminarians of Holy Cross Seminary cycled for 33 days from Cape Reinga to Bluff to promote vocations for the priesthood. His other passions included rugby and cricket, which he played, and just about all sports going.\n\nHe always has a book “on the go”, covering most genres, latterly he has enjoyed NZ historical novels. He loves journeying with people from every walk and background of life; they have made him who he is.\n\nBishop Michael’s Latin motto is Totus Tuus: “All Yours.\"\n\nThe Bishop’s personal coat of arms is blazoned in heraldic terms: Or, a fess wavy Azure; between, in chief the Christogram Chi & Rho Gules and in base upon a trimount issuant in base Vert a Tui (Prosthemadera novaeseelandiae) statant Proper.\n\nIn plain English, the arms may be described: A wavy blue band bisects a gold shield with the Christogram Chi Roh in red in the upper part of the shield and, in the lower part, a Tui in its proper colours standing on the central of three green hillocks. The various elements in the arms make the following references:\n\n• The blue and gold are the principal colours of the arms of Pope Saint John Paul II.\n\n• The blue central wavy band also references the Virgin Mary, to whom Bishop Michael has always had a deep devotion, and the Waikato River which he has lived close to for much of his childhood.\n\n• The trimount or green hillocks in the base reference the rolling hills that have featured in Bishop Michael’s life: Maungatautari, Pirongia and Rangitoto.\n\n• The Tui bird is another personal element, the Bishop having a spiritual connection with the bird and its magnificent voice from his earliest days.\n\nBishop Michael's motto Totus Tuus, translated All Yours, is in reference to the commitment of his life to Jesus through the intercession of Mary.\n\nIt is significant this motto was also that of Pope Saint John Paul II of blessed memory. The Bishop’s arms were designed by Richard d’Apice AM of the Australian Heraldry Society and Father Guy Selvester and were rendered by Roger Barnes of the Heraldry Society of New Zealand.\n\nDate of Birth: 2 June 1971\n\nPlace of Birth: Cambridge, New Zealand\n\nBaptised: 27 June 1971, St. Peter’s, Cambridge\n\nPriestly Ordination: 29 November 1997 ; Diocese: Hamilton\n\nEducation:\n\nForest View High School, Tokoroa 1985-1989:\n\nSeminary formation at Holy Cross College, Mosgiel 1992-1995:\n\nBachelor of Theology, University of Otago 2005-2007:\n\nMaster in Theology, Franciscan University of Steubenville, USA 2012-2014:\n\nLicentiate in Theology, St. Peter Favre Centre for Formators to the Priesthood and Religious Life, Gregorian University, Rome\n\nPriestly Ministry:\n\n1997-2002: Assistant Priest, St. Mary’s Star of the Sea, Gisborne\n\n1999-2002: Member, Priests Council, Diocese of Hamilton\n\n2001-2002: Chair, Gisborne Ministers Association\n\n2002-2005: Parish Priest, St. Columba, Frankton and Holy Name, Raglan\n\n2007-2012: Parish Priest, St. Thomas More, Mt.
