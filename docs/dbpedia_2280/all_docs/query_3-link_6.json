        "text": "Notable Archbishops\n\nLearn more about some of the previous Archbishops of York:\n\nLancelot Blackburne 1724-1743\n\nDuring the 1680's and following his ordination, Lancelot went to the West Indies and obtained a position as a ship's chaplain. He received a payment of £20 for discharging his duties diligently. The payment, a considerable sum at the time, was due to the fact he was aboard a privateer (pirate ship!)\n\nCardinal Thomas Wolsey 1514-1530\n\nOne of the most unusual Archbishops of York as he never came to the city! After failing to negotiate a divorce for Henry VIII with the Pope, he travelled to Cawood Castle and spent the night there prior to his enthronement. Thomas Wolsey had been the Archbishop of York for 16 years without ever so much as visiting York, but when he finally travelled to York he was arrested the morning of his enthronement by Henry VIII men. He died on his return to London in the custody of the King's men.\n\nRichard le Scrope 1398-1405\n\nBeheaded on the Knavesmire following his trial for treason in the Great Hall during Henry IV reign. He asked the executioner to strike him five times with the sword. Each strike was to represent the five wounds on Christ's body on the cross. Richard Le Scrope was interred at York Minster.\n\nEdward Venables Vernon Harcourt (1807-1847) and Walter de Grey (1215-1255) were also notable as each served for a period of 40 years.\n\n20th & 21st Century Archbishops\n\nWilliam Maclagan 1891-1908\n\nResponsible for the renovation of the Chapel. Buried alongside his wife at St Andrews Church, Bishopthorpe\n\nCosmo Gordon Lang 1909-1928\n\nThe first Archbishop ever to have a motor car, he went on to become Archbishop of Canterbury and confirmed a young Princess Elizabeth.\n\nWilliam Temple 1929-1942\n\nA great social reformer and keen on working classes having basic rights. Moved to Canterbury in 1942 but died only three years later.\n\nCyril Garbett 1942-1955\n\nKnown as a strong, often ruthless character who was respected rather than loved. Worked hard for the Diocese of York, transforming its ministry and mission. Preached at the Royal Wedding in 1947. Died whilst in office.\n\nMichael Ramsey 1956-1961\n\nWent on to become the 100th Archbishop of Canterbury but enjoyed his six years at Bishopthorpe and was much loved in the village. He was a great teacher, particularly on key spiritual issues. He and Lady Ramsey returned to live at Bishopthorpe for some months not long before he died in Oxford.\n\nDonald Coggan 1961-1974\n\nAnother Archbishop of York who went on to Canterbury. An evangelical by tradition he was a great teacher and will always be remembered for his great Call to the North Mission in the seventies. He was a poignant preacher and pastorally very sensitive to issues which people faced in the reality of their lives.\n\nStuart Blanch 1975-1983\n\nDuring the Second World War Blanch was a Navigator in the Royal Air Force and Blanch was undoubtedly a man of the people. He brought a softer touch to the post than Coggan - not in his theology but in his warm, friendly smile and wonderful personality.\n\nJohn Habgood 1983-1995\n\nA well-respected scientist, Lord Habgood was an intellectual heavyweight who guided the Church Of England through some difficult times with the help of his colleagues Lord Runcie and George Carey at Lambeth Palace. Shy and retiring he was a superb speaker and lecturer.\n\nDavid Hope 1995-2005\n\nTogether with the Archbishop of Canterbury wrote to Tony Blair expressing deep concern about Government policy and criticised the coalition troops' conduct in Iraq. Former Bishop of Wakefield and London he retired as Archbishop in 2005 to serve as Priest-in-Charge of St Margaret’s, Ilkley.\n\nJohn Sentamu 2005-2020\n\nArchbishop Sentamu’s priorities included the renewal of discipleship in the church, advocacy for the poor and the need for a living wage, investment in young people and equipping the church to rediscover its confidence in talking about Jesus. Combined with this have been public acts which have sought to draw attention to injustice and highlight its remedies. From December 2015 for six months he walked the length and breadth of York Diocese on a ‘pilgrimage of prayer, witness, and blessing’ sharing the Gospel with all he met."
