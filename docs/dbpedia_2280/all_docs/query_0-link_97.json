        "text": "BY MILDRED NDUM WUNG KUM\n\nCornelius Fontem Esua passed possession of Bamenda Archdiocese to his successor. The sacred moment to induct Andrew Fuanya Nkea as third metropolitan of Bamenda Archdiocese ignited jubilation, leaving imprint on the archdiocese’s history as the time of episcopal transition.\n\nThe high point was presentation of the bull of appointment, the handing of the Crosier and the cathedra. This was witnessed by hundreds including bishops, priests, religious, consecrated men and women, civil, political and religious leaders who all turned out at the St Joseph Centenary Piazza, 22nd February 2020.\n\nIt took place during a Holy Mass in the presence of His Grace Julio Murat, the Nuncio to Cameroon and Equatorial Guinea representing Pope Francis, while Cameroon’s president was represented by Paul Atanga Nji, Minister of Territorial Administration.\n\nAt the ceremony, Andrew took the crosier, a symbol of his pastoral ministry being Chief Shepherd. He was handed the cosier from Cornelius in the presence of the Nucio.\n\nAndrew then sat on the cathedra, the chair made from furniture that symbolises his teaching role.\n\nAt the accomplishment of the rites, bishops and priest at the event come in fraternity kissing the ecclesiastical ring of the most Reverend Andrew Fuanya Nkea. This is followed by a mood of conviviality with the newly installed archbishop blessing each and every segment of the crowd witnessing the occasion.\n\nAndrew aided by the Nuncio takes the crosier from Cornelius\n\nHis Lordship George Nkuo, bishop of Kumbo Diocese enjoined the new Archbishop to his call “The purpose of a bishop is to be a father to his people, a brother to his Priests and consecrated men and women and wife to his witness of Jesus to the world. That is the duty entrusted to Andrew as he assumes duty as Archbishop of Bamenda”\n\nThe incoming Archbishop in a statement to the press pledged commitment to the needs of his flock “I am going to do everything within my powers so that the hatred, the killing, the violence should stop”\n\nAs he signed out from the office of Archbishop, emeritus archbishop Cornelius Fontem Esua thanked the people for their collaboration. He also called on the flock to support his successor whom he described as young, dynamic and wise.\n\nAndrew Fuanya Nkea takes over from Cornelius Fontem Esua as the third chief shepherd of Bamenda after his predecessors Cornelius Fontem Esua and late Paul Verdzekov.\n\nThe Diocese is currently being plagued by a socio political crisis diffused into the Church from the country’s unjust social and political trend.\n\nAll eyes are raised to His Grace Andrew Fuanya Nkea as he comes into the embattled Archdiocese.\n\nThe Archdiocese of Bamenda is conterminous with five divisions of the Northwest region; Boyo, Mezam, Momo, Menchum and Ngoketunjia. It has an area of, 11000000 square meters, a population of 1.5000000 persons with about 600,000 Catholics.\n\nThere are about 156 diocesans and religious priests, currently saving across the parishes of the archdiocese.\n\nIt has the pastoral, presbyterial, laity, health and education councils."
