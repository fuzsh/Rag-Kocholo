        "text": "His last two movies – Stuber and Coffee & Kareem may not scored much love from critics or audiences, but that apparently isn't stopping director Michael Dowse from scoring new movies to make. He's now aboard the adaptation of best-selling game title Just Cause.\n\nThe film will follow the video game’s blueprint, with agent Rico Rodriguez is on a race-against-time mission to stop the mercenary group The Black Hand. His is a chaotic style of taking out the bad guys, which no doubt means lots of explosions. And, according to Deadline, it'll feature a female co-lead and aim for a Romancing The Stone feel.\n\nThis is one that has been in development for a while – Jason Momoa was attached to playRodriguez back in 2017, with Brad Peyton in the director's chair. Whether Momoa is offered the lead again is unknown for now."
