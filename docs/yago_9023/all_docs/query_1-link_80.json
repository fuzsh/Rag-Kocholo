        "text": "ELORA – Arnold Schwarzenegger is in downtown Elora this week, filming scenes for the Netflix series FUBAR.\n\nWhile signs around Hoffer Park and on Geddes Street identified the production as “Oink,” an area business owner said production staff had visited nearby businesses in advance to discuss the project, and she was told they were filming FUBAR.\n\nA crew member on site on April 30 declined to provide her name but confirmed it was day one of filming for the second season of the action comedy series.\n\nThe series stars Schwarzenegger as a CIA operative on the verge of retirement who ends up working with his daughter who, unbeknownst to him, is also a CIA operative.\n\nSchwarzenegger’s character, Luke Brunner, is described on imdb.com as the first main role in a TV series for the actor.\n\nWhile nothing was shared about the star’s anticipated presence in town, a notification provided to local businesses stated filming for an unnamed production would take place April 30 and May 1 at 1 MacDonald Square.\n\nThe Centre Wellington Township office has been transformed into a “Heritage Museum and Cultural Center” for filming.\n\nElsewhere, American flags and New York licence plates added to the transformation of the area.\n\nAssistant location manager Andrew Bezuk-Greig, who had been on site waiting for crews to arrive on April 26, spoke to the Advertiser, saying the scene to be filmed required “nice weather.”\n\nRainy weather dampened the site on Tuesday morning, but skies cleared sufficiently by midday for filming to take place, and Schwarzenegger was part of the action.\n\nFilming was expected to continue on May 1, and production vehicles were expected to be gone by May 2 at 7am."
