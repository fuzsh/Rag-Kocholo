        "text": "Rating: 2 out of 5 stars\n\nGenre: Comedy, Sports\n\nRun Time: 1 hour 32 minutes, Rated R\n\nStarring: Seann William Scott, Jay Baruchel, Live Schreiber, Alison Pill, Marc-Andre Grondin\n\nDirected by Michael Dowse (Take Me Home Tonight, Fubar)\n\nâ€‹From the opening shot of Goon (really? A gargantuan black hockey player??? [Note: It was later pointed out that this was a cameo from real NHL enforcer Georges Laraque]), there is not a single shred of authenticity. On the surface, it will appear to be a hockey movie, and it isn't, really. It appears to be a comedy, but it isn't very funny. And for those that may say it is authentically a Canadian movie may want to re-consider...our neighbors in the north should be wary of a film like this being associated with them."
