        "text": "The raucous R-rated hockey comedy Goon has racked up significant international distribution deals for Myriad Pictures. Starring Sean William Scott, the movie has been sold in the UK, Australia, France, Germany, Russia Scandinavia, Latin America, Turkey, the Middle East, Indonesia and South Africa, and several other markets. Magnolia’s Magnet picked up Goon for US distribution at Toronto and plans a March theatrical release. Scott plays a onetime bouncer who ends up vying with Liev Schrieber for the distinction of being the hockey league’s biggest goon. Jay Baruchel, Eugene Levy and Allison Pill co-star. The movie was directed by Michael Dowse (Take Me Home Tonight, FUBAR I and II, It’s All Gone Pete Tong). Jay Baruchel and Evan Goldberg (Superbad, Pineapple Express) wrote the script. Goon was produced by Don Carmody (Resident Evil, Silent Hill, Boondock Saints), David Gross and Jesse Shapira. Myriad’s other movies include Mike Figgis-directed Seconds of Pleasure, from a script by Neil LaBute starring Matt Dillon and Kristin Scott Thomas, A Common Man with Ben Kingsley and Ben Cross, as well as Edwin Boyd, Knife Fight and Chained.\n\ndeadline-logo-svg Deadline\n\nSignup for Breaking News Alerts & Newsletters\n\nYour Email\n\nBy providing your information, you agree to our Terms of Use and our Privacy Policy.
