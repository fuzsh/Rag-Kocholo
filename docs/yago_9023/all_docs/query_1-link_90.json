        "text": "Arnold Schwarzenegger thanked fans for their support Thursday following his pacemaker surgery earlier this month. The action star also assured audiences his recovery would not delay the upcoming second season of FUBAR.\n\n“Thank you! I’ve gotten so many kind messages from all over the world, but a lot of people have asked if my pacemaker will cause any problems with FUBAR Season 2,” Schwarzenegger wrote on social media. “Absolutely not. I will be ready to film in April, and you can only see it if you’re really looking for it.”\n\nAttached to the post was a picture of the actor, with his pacemaker depicted as a cartoon ticking bomb atop his chest.\n\nSchwarzenegger first shared he had undergone surgery on Monday’s episode of his Arnold’s Pump Club podcast, when he told fans the operation had allowed him to become “a little bit more of a machine.”\n\n“First of all, I want you to know I’m doing great! I had my surgery on Monday, and by Friday, I was already at a big environmental event with my friend and fellow fitness crusader Jane Fonda,” he continued, praising Fonda as someone who is “healthy” and “looks fantastic.”\n\nHe added: “Nobody would ever have thought I started the week with a surgery. I want to thank my whole team at the Cleveland Clinic. All of the doctors and nurses took amazing care of me and made the surgery as painless as possible.”\n\nFUBAR stars Schwarzenegger as a CIA operative who discovers that his daughter (Monica Barbaro) also works for the agency. They’re forced into a reluctant partnership in the action comedy created by Nick Santora (Reacher, Scorpion). Season one released in May 2023, and the series was renewed a month later in June."
