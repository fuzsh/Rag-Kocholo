        "text": "1. Film Studies Week Lucky Thirteen Special Effects and Bad Movie Day. Features: FUBAR , Director: Michael Dowse and Ed Wood , Director: Tim Burton\n\n2. Discussion about Spirited Away?\n\n3. Special Effects We will be looking at examples of in-camera mechanical SPX (production-phase) and digital SPX (post production). The duties of SFX are fulfilled by the “special-effects unit” who is charged with preparing and executing process shots, miniatures, matte work, computer-generated images (CGI), and other technical shots. According to Barsam: Special Effects (SPX) is a term reserved for technology that creates images that would be too dangerous, too expenseive or impossible to achieve with ordinary cinematographic materials.\n\n4. Special Effects Other TOPICS See Barsam pages 188 - 192 The goal of SFX -- Verisimilitude. First SFX , The Execution of Mary Stuart, in 1895. Metropolis, (Fritz Lang, 1927). Otto Hunt, designer. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrYd4- YbXrE Production phase effects, In Camera, Mechanical, and Laboratory Effects. Example, Alien (Ridley Scott, 1979). CGI. Kubrick’s 2001, first film to seamlessly link footage shot by the camera with that prepared by the computer. Example, Terminator 2 (James Cameron, 1991) The Uncanny Valley.\n\n5. . “ Bad” (ie cheap) Movies as Cult Classics\n\n6. Michael Dowse — FUBAR (Fucked Up Beyond All Recognition) . What do we know about Dowse? Michael Dowse was born (1973) and raised in Calgary. He has worked as a film editor on John Hazlett's BAD MONEY (1999) and Matt Bissonnette and Steven Clark's LOOKING FOR LEONARD (2002). His short film 237 (2000) was followed by his feature debut, the cult hit FUBAR (2002), which premiered at the 2000 Sundance Film Festival. IT'S ALL GONE PETE TONG (2004) is his second feature, and has already garnered praise, winning the City Award at the 2004 Toronto International Film Festival . As Dowse puts it, with his second film he really wanted to, “Rip cinema a new asshole.” Michael Dowse has listed some of his creative influences that have nuanced his work:• Franz Kafka “One of the most influential writers of this century. Virtually unknown during his lifetime, the works of Kafka have since been recognized as symbolizing modern man's anxiety-ridden and grotesque alienation in an unintelligible, hostile, or indifferent world.” Bad Movies as Cult Classics\n\n7.
