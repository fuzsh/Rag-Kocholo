From director Michael Dowse comes Stuber, a film about an Uber driver called Stu. Stu is played by Kumail Nanjiani, and he picks up a passenger played by Dave Bautista. Thing is, said passenger turns out to be a cop, and he’s a cop on the trail of a killer, played by the brilliant Iko Uwais. Events go forth from that point.\n\nKaren Gillan is also in the ensemble for this one, and the film arrives in cinemas on July 12th of this year. Here’s the red band trailer that’s just been released (thus, don’t watch this if you’re easily influenced and sensitive and stuff)…\n\nHere’s the tamer original trailer for the movie…\n\nAnd here’s the latest international trailer for the movie too.\n\nTripper Clancy has penned the script for the film. And one last thing: here’s the official synopsis, too…\n\nWhen a mild-mannered Uber driver named Stu (Kumail Nanjiani) picks up a passenger (Dave Bautista) who turns out to be a cop hot on the trail of a brutal killer, he’s thrust into a harrowing ordeal where he desperately tries to hold onto his wits, his life and his five-star rating. Directed by Michael Dowse, this action-comedy from 20th Century Fox also stars Iko Uwais, Natalie Morales, Betty Gilpin, Jimmy Tatro, Mira Sorvino and Karen Gillan."
