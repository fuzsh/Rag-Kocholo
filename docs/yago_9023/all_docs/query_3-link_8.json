        "text": "The sequel to the 2002 cult hit about two irrepressible Alberta metal heads, Terry (David Lawrence) and Dean (Paul Spence), picks up from the first film as Terry celebrates five years of health following his bout with \"nut cancer.\"\n\nAt the party, their old buddy Tron (Andrew Sparacino), flashes his new bling and brags about the easy money to be made working on the pipelines near Fort McMurray. And after the house gets spectacularly trashed, the now-homeless boys head north in their vintage Cutlass Supreme to the oil fields.\n\nWith its smokestacks, peeler bars and industrial squalor, the boomtown gives the movie a memorably gritty context and the characters some unfamiliar cash. Terry starts blowing his earnings on a gold-digging waitress (a very funny Terra Hazelton) and Dean contrives an injury that will get him on workers' compensation.\n\nDirector Mike Dowse and the actors walk a line here between comedy that's both cheerfully asinine and dark as bitumen. Though the energy flags a little in the film's second half, overall the comedy feels nervy and original.\n\nDean, aka Deaner (Paul Spence) Lawrence and Spence first created the characters of Dean and Terry on Calgary's Loose Moose stage. Dean, with his muscle shirts and 1970s' porn-star 'stache, is the yang to Terry's yin, swinging to more manic highs and self-destructive lows than his buddy. There's also something of the philosopher about Dean: \"Knowledge of non-knowledge is power,\" he proclaims, a sort of strength-through-ignorance message that sounds as though it were hatched in a right-wing think-tank. It fits with his rude handling of a do-gooder, environmentally minded hitchhiker. At heart, Dean is a poet and, like Arthur Rimbaud, he seeks to arrive at the unknown through the disordering of all the senses. Mostly, though, he just ends up senseless.\n\nTerry (David Lawrence) Fubar is a comedy about aspects of masculinity - sterility, testicle cancer, manly labour, paternity, sexual faithfulness and hunting - and the sensitive Terry sticks to an old-fashioned chivalric male code, a sure recipe for disappointment. With his shaded glasses and baseball cap, Lawrence's Terry looks like a man trying to hide, possibly from the memory of long-ago high school teachers, or just out of embarrassment at being with Dean. Terry's the kind of incorrigible idealist who will max out his credit cards for love and is a more loyal friend than Dean deserves. The best part of Lawrence's performance is his mouth, which fixes somewhere between a pout and a defensive fighting posture when he feels offended, which is most of the time.\n\nMike Dowse (director) Though it's apparently a mockumentary, Fubar II differs from the original because it has no onscreen director. That's a mark of how quickly the documentary techniques, from shaky cameras to direct-to-camera monologues, have been absorbed into conventional television and movie storytelling ( The Office, Modern Family, Trailer Park Boys). With a bigger budget, Dowse's style is confident, offering a combination of deft one-on-one improvised sequences and more messily complex set-pieces - the party that turns into a house fire, a montage of a shopping trip in the West Edmonton Mall and a strange Christmas story that brings the story to a close.\n\nFort McMurray, aka The Mac The mayor of Fort McMurray recently announced she will be seeking a third term, in part to correct the city's image as an environmental disaster area. Fubar II won't help her cause. The extraordinary image of the belching smokestacks is enough to make any tree-hugger shudder. Reportedly, the filmmaking team had considered a sequel which took Dean and Terry to Hollywood, or placed them in a vampire film, but it's clear that the oil-sands location was a master stroke: The backdrop is so pervasively god-awful, it makes the humour and hope all the more welcome.\n\nFubar II"
