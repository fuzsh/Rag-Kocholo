        "text": "The following is an excerpt from Dave Crenshaw’s interview with Orion Jean from The Dave Crenshaw Success Project, a new podcast. You can subscribe to Dave’s new podcast here.\n\nOrion Jean is a young man with a mission to spread kindness worldwide. He started by donating toys to a local children’s hospital and has since gone on to help hundreds of thousands of families in need. He shared how he got started with the help of his parents, Kherri Jean and McDonald Jean , and a small monetary prize he won. He talked about the unexpected struggles they worked through in the early stages of their mission. Orion and his parents detailed how they designed a more efficient system to expand their reach. Orion also talked about his experience being TIME Magazine’s Kid of the Year and how the title has helped him reach even bigger goals.\n\nGrowing Up in Service\n\nOrion's parents, Kherri and McDonald Jean were raised in a service-oriented household. They met in college while serving others and helping their community. They raised Orion and his brother in the same environment.\n\n\"Orion would come to projects and things on the weekend, whether it be helping out the community in some small way or partnering up with an existing nonprofit that's doing some work in the community,\" McDonald said.\n\nThrough his parents' desire to help others, Orion created connections within the nonprofit community at an early age. These relationships helped make his current mission successful.\n\n\"[Orion] understood the importance of not being a selfish person and to think of others first.\" - McDonald Jean\n\nOrion shared how his parents' daily actions also instilled the virtue of kindness into him. He talked about how he witnessed them choosing to be kind to everyone, regardless of their title.\n\n\"It was those small examples that they always put into motion that made me think,\" Orion explained, \"When I grow up, or when I come across the situation, again, I'm going to choose to be kind, because they were able to set that example for me.\"\n\nThe Catalyst Competition\n\nIt all started when Orion was encouraged to enter a speech competition by his teacher. At first, he thought it might not be possible, with only 24 hours to enter.\n\n\"My mom told me, 'You can't win if you don't enter,\" Orion said, \"I was scared of failure, but if I didn't give myself the chance, how would I ever know if anything was going to come out of it?\"\n\nDespite his fears, Orion decided to push through and enter the competition. \"If I had just walked away that day and said that I don't have enough time and it's not going to work, then none of this would have been able to happen,\" he shared.\n\n\"The speech contest, which I ended up winning, was the catalyst to something that had been building up for longer than I knew.\" - Orion Jean\n\nThe First Mission\n\nAfter winning the competition, Orion knew he wanted to use his $500 prize to help others somehow. At first, he and his family weren't sure what cause to support.\n\n\"When we were able to finally decide on donating toys, then it was like okay, which hospital,\" Orion explained, \"and then where are we going to buy the toys?\" The logistics of their first project were more complicated than they first thought.\n\n\"We needed to not only figure out a hospital that was willing to, because everyone was a little bit standoffish because of COVID,\" McDonald shared, \"There were also a lot of restrictions about who can come to the hospital, what you can donate to the hospital.\"\n\nThe Jean family sat down to plan out their first project together. Kherri said, \"We sat down, and we kind of talked about, okay, well, how are we going to get the message out?\"\n\nThe first action they agreed on was building a website. They decided to create it on their own to save money.\n\n\"It certainly could be drastically improved. But for a novice, it got our message out there,\" Kherri said. Orion was able to use the website to share videos and messages with the community to help expand their toy drive.\n\n\"I think one of the things that people take for granted is the end result,\" McDonald said, \"And they don't see the late nights. They don't see the logistics, the work, the planning, and giving up your weekends. Giving up time you could be spending with your family.\"\n\nOrion found that focusing on his purpose made the work and planning worth it. The desire to help others motivated him and his parents to push through the challenges.\n\n\"There's purpose in planning.\" - Orion Jean\n\nThe Race to Kindness\n\nDuring the first project, Orion and his parents learned many hard lessons about what not to do logistically.\n\n\"At the beginning of the race to kindness, for the race to 500 toys, we decided that it was a good idea to keep all of our toy donations in our dining room,\" Orion shared, \"So, at one point in time, it looked like a UPS storage facility.\"\n\n\"Sometimes things would work out. We took the good with the bad, and we decided to learn from it and grow with it.\" - Orion Jean\n\nThe next mission Orion chose was a huge jump. He set a goal to feed 100,000 families in need.\n\n\"The amount of time that it would take for us to try to do that on our own would mean that there are so many people out there who aren't able to get the food because the four of us can't do it on our own,\" Kherri explained. They knew it was time to ask for help.\n\nThrough an existing relationship with a non-profit organization named TangoTab , Orion assembled a large enough team to make his goal realistic.\n\n\"Tango Tab already had an infrastructure in place that is operational,\" McDonald shared, \"They had drop-off times, they had the volunteers, they already had the mechanism that we were going to adopt and just scale.\"\n\nUltimately, Orion didn't just meet his goals—he exceeded them.\n\n\"We did the race to 500 toys, but we ended up collecting 619 new toys, we did the race to 100,000 meals, and we collected 100,984,\" Kherri shared.\n\nOrion’s Next Move\n\nThe most recent mission Orion tackled is his race to 500,000 books for children. They’ve grown their system by leaps and bounds since that first toy project.\n\n“We try to make them bigger and better every time.” - Kherri Jean\n\n“Countless people have been impacted by the joint services coming together for these projects,” Kherri shared.\n\nOrion wants to continue using this opportunity to help others. He has more plans in the works already.\n\n“Right now, I am talking to educators,” Orion said, “...I think where the ripple effect can begin is with the parents or the teachers who are teaching that to their kids or their students so that they can continue to go on and spread that message.”\n\nToday, Orion continues to use the recognition from TIME Magazine’s Kid of the Year title to grow his platform for The Race to Kindness. He has written a book, A Kid’s Book about Leadership, and has started a speaking career!\n\nAs Orion said, when you have a goal, always persevere and always be determined. If you don’t give up, and you plan ahead, you’ll succeed.\n\nAction Principles\n\nPick one to do this week:\n\nBe optimistic. When you adopt a mindset that “everything’s going to work out,” you’re more likely to be successful. One action you could take: When you feel yourself thinking negatively, stop and look for something positive instead and focus on it.\n\nSeek out partnerships. It’s not only okay to get help, it’s encouraged! Strategic partnerships can make a big difference in your success. One action you could take: Research people or companies that have succeeded at what you’re trying to do, and reach out to them for help.\n\nAcquire new skills as you go. Learn new skills needed to keep moving forward instead of giving up. One action you could take: Take an online course on a skill you need to reach your goal.\n\nFocus on your why. When you know the reason why you’re doing something, it’s easier to push through opposition. One action you could take: Write your “why” down and place it somewhere you’ll see it regularly."
