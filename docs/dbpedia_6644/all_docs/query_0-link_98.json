One, it hoped to meet a “seriously felt” need for a means of communication between the Board of Management, the Chapters, and individual members of the DAR. Two, it aspired to “open to issue a magazine devoted especially to the cause of a true and liberal Americanism.”",

        "text": "Have you ever wondered, “Why does the DAR have a magazine?” In 1892, the National Board of Management approved a resolution for the creation of a periodical that would serve two purposes. One, it hoped to meet a “seriously felt” need for a means of communication between the Board of Management, the Chapters, and individual members of the DAR. Two, it aspired to “open to issue a magazine devoted especially to the cause of a true and liberal Americanism.”\n\nAt the time of its creation, multiple periodicals had reached out to the DAR about publishing information on its works and causes. The ladies had a steadily growing membership and were gaining broader attention, and they had recently established a fund for what would become the DAR’s home in Washington, D.C. Instead of occupying a regular column in someone else’s publication, they decided that the creation of their own magazine would allow them to dedicate it to subjects that mattered to its membership. Its first Editor, Ellen Hardin Walworth, wrote, “The patriotic, historical and educational objects which the National Society has in view will be advanced by a large circulation of the magazine.”\n\nSince that first issue was published in July 1892, the DAR has continuously produced a magazine devoted to the work of the Society and American history. We now have three full-time magazine staff at our headquarters, a robust DAR Magazine Committee, and a publications partner to help us publish our beloved American Spirit.\n\nDid you know the DAR Magazine has had several title changes during its history? It was first named the American Monthly Magazine, followed by the Daughters of the American Revolution Magazine and National Historical Magazine. It was finally separated into two publications in 2001. American Spirit became the new title of the magazine, featuring professionally written articles on American history from the Colonial period through the 1820s, and genealogy. The Daughters newsletter, published and mailed to DAR members with the magazine, is entirely devoted to the work and goals of the Society.\n\nTo borrow a quote from that very first issue, “It is desired and expected that every member of the Society will encourage and sustain this magazine, which belongs essentially to the Society as a whole.” What a beautiful aspiration! Today, our magazine is a great tool to help the public get to know our mission and organization, and our newsletter is an instrument for our members to stay connected to national and state DAR happenings.\n\nIf you are interested in learning more about the history of the magazine, I would encourage you to visit our Digital Magazine Archive through the DAR Members’ Website. How wonderful it is to have more than 125 years of DAR and American history to explore at your fingertips! I personally like to read the editors’ notes in some of the earlier years, which show the independence and intelligence of these women who were truly ahead of their time.\n\nNot yet subscribed to our magazine?
