They rely on editors to determine the suitability of contributed works, rather than a peer-review process. Magazine articles are written by journalists or contributing writers, and they do not have to cite sources.\n\nNewspapers\n\nFor the general reader. Newspaper articles are written by journalists, but may reflect reporting, investigative reporting, or opinion. While newspapers may be focused on authoritative and quality news reporting, journalists rely on different types of evidence than scholars. They do not necessarily have to cite sources, but some do.\n\nTrade Journals\n\nThese are specifically created for particular professions, or trades. They also have advertisements directed to that profession. For example, a trade journal for dentists may advertise and discuss new dental technologies."
