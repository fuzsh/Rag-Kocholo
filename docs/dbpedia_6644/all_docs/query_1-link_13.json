The attacks targeted immigrants, and broke out in predominantly English towns and cities as well as Northern Ireland. Far-right groups were recorded looting, attacking police and locals, and performing Nazi salutes. Mobs chanting “Send them home” and “Islam out” destroyed mosques and graffitied racial slurs on homes. In some of the more violent instances, rioters stormed hotels housing asylum seekers. In one case, a fire was set while guests and staff were inside. Prime Minister Keir Starmer condemned the violence as “far-right thuggery” and later called on large social media companies to police hate that is “whipped up online.” Following an…\n\nSheikh Hasina Wazed was proud of her house. When the Bangladeshi Prime Minister welcomed TIME to her Ganabhaban official residence in Dhaka last fall, she spent half an hour giving a personal tour of the manicured grounds, stippled with pomelo trees and swing sets for her grandchildren. But on Aug. 5, with furious protesters closing in, Hasina was forced to flee her palatial home in a helicopter. Jubilant crowds clambered onto the Ganabhaban’s roof and carried away spoils including furniture, pets, and Hasina’s own silk saris. In a televised address, the army chief, General Waker-uz-Zaman, confirmed that Hasina, 76, had resigned and that he would form an interim government. “I am taking full responsibility,” he said. PEOPLE’S UPRISING What was effectively a coup d’état had been driven by a popular uprising…\n\nRELEASED Prisoners of Putin Evan Gershkovich and 15 others, finally free Though President Joe Biden did the honors when it came time to announce the news, the historic Aug. 1 swap that resulted in the release of more than 20 Russian-held prisoners—including Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich and two other American citizens—relied on the cooperation of seven countries. At a time of deepening global tensions, the rare moment of collaboration was not just a cause for celebration among the prisoners and their families, but also a significant diplomatic achievement. For Biden, who has long pledged both to secure the release of imprisoned Americans and to support pro-democracy movements abroad, the sweeping exchange was a meaningful victory at a moment when, amid the drama of the presidential election, his capacity to lead had been…\n\nOne of the first checks ever recorded was written in the 11th century in a marketplace in Basra, in what is today Iraq. There, a merchant issued a sakk: written instructions to his bank to make a payment from his account. A thousand years later, this form of payment is finally disappearing. Target in July became the latest retailer to stop accepting checks. It’s just the latest sign that the check is nearing obsolescence: the average American writes just one check a month, down from three in 2016, according to a Federal Reserve survey. In 1995, the year of peak usage, Americans wrote 49.5 billion checks, which was 15 checks each month by every man, woman, and child in the U.S. “I absolutely think that we are moving to a world of…\n\nEvery morning when Libbey Castle wakes up, she strips her bed and chucks her sheets into the washing machine. It doesn’t matter if it’s a weekday or the weekend, if she has a light or a busy day ahead, if she slept well or tossed and turned all night. The sheets will be washed. “I let them do their thing, and I go make coffee feeling happy,” says Castle, 30, who lives in Washington, D.C. “Then I throw them into the dryer before I go work out. I come back, I grab a shower, and the sheets are done. I throw them on the bed, and then I start my day.” Knowing fresh sheets await her boosts her spirits straight through to bedtime. Health experts agree that Castle is onto something: most…"
