        "text": "These media sources have a slight to moderate liberal bias. They often publish factual information that utilizes loaded words (wording that attempts to influence an audience by using appeal to emotion or stereotypes) to favor liberal causes. These sources are generally trustworthy for information but may require further investigation. See all Left-Center sources.\n\nOverall, we rate Time Magazine Left-Center biased based on story selection that mostly favors the left and High for factual reporting due to proper sourcing and a clean fact check record. This update moves Time further to the left, with their bias rating score increasing from 3.75/10 to 4.75/10, which is on the cusp of Left and Left-Center Bias.\n\nDetailed Report\n\nBias Rating: LEFT-CENTER Factual Reporting: HIGH\n\nCountry: USA\n\nPress Freedom Rank: MOSTLY FREE\n\nMedia Type: Magazine\n\nTraffic/Popularity: High Traffic\n\nMBFC Credibility Rating: HIGH CREDIBILITY\n\nHistory\n\nFounded in 1923, Time is an American weekly news magazine published in New York City. The current managing editor is Edward Felsenthal. Since 2000, Time has undergone several ownership changes and mergers. In 2000, Time Inc. became a part of AOL Time Warner and then in 2017 was purchased by the Meredith Corporation. After only 6 weeks, the Meredith Corporation sold Time Magazine to Marc Benioff and his wife Lynne for $190 million. Benioff is the billionaire founder of Salesforce.com and is an activist related to left-leaning causes such as equal pay for equal work, affordable health care, and support for a livable wage.\n\nRead our profile on the United States government and media.\n\nFunded by / Ownership\n\nTime Magazine is owned by Marc and Lynne Benioff and is funded through subscriptions, sponsored content, and advertising sales.\n\nAnalysis / Bias\n\nIn review, Time a is a journalism magazine that covers current events and politics. Time utilizes loaded language in headlines such as this: President Trump Is Making Baseless Claims About the Migrant Caravan. Here Are the Facts. The information contained in articles is generally well-sourced and linked to credible factual sources. Story selection mostly favors the left with articles such as this: Obama Rails Against Republicans in Fiery Nevada Rally.\n\nWhile Time Magazine is clearly biased in favor of left-leaning causes, they display a strong anti-Trump bias with daily articles denigrating his policies and actions. It is important to note that holding an anti-Trump bias is not necessarily a pro-left bias, as many centrist and right-center sources also report against President Trump’s character and policies.\n\nFailed Fact Checks\n\nNone in the Last 5 years\n\nOverall, we rate Time Magazine Left-Center biased based on story selection that mostly favors the left and High for factual reporting due to proper sourcing and a clean fact check record. This update moves Time further to the left, with their bias rating score increasing from 3.75/10 to 4.75/10, which is on the cusp of Left and Left-Center Bias. (5/18/2016) Updated (D.
