Find out here.\n\nWhy it matters: Politics in the 21st century has been defined by the Democratic Party's growing appeal amongst voters with college degrees while a Republican Party, once seen as representing the elite, has built support among working class voters who did not attend college. Of the 35 percent of Americans with a college degree, 61 percent voted for Biden in 2020, according to the Pew Research Center, while 53 percent of those without a college degree favored for Trump.
