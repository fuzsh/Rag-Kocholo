        "text": "The Times, founded in 1785 as the Daily Universal Register, is the oldest national daily newspaper in the UK and holds an important place as the “paper of record” on public life, from politics and world affairs to business and sport.\n\nIn his first edition, John Walter I explained that “like a well-covered table, it should contain something suited to every palate” including politics, foreign affairs, matters of trade, legal trials, advertisements and “amusements”. In its tone and political neutrality, Walter reserved the right of the newspaper “to censure or applaud either [political party]” and to cover contending issues with respectful “fair argument”. More than 200 years later, these founding principles hold true today. The Times has supported both New Labour and the Conservatives in recent times and supported Remain in the 2016 EU referendum.\n\nIn an age when world leaders routinely dismiss unwelcome reports as “fake news”, readers need a source they can trust for honest journalism that informs, entertains and analyses without bias. In The Times they can find agenda-setting investigations and exclusives, unrivalled coverage of politics and business at home and abroad, and a range of columnists from across the political spectrum showcased on our digital platforms and in print. Leading news reporting and analysis are complemented by an incisive Comment section, featuring columnists from across the political spectrum and the best satirical cartoonists. Other prominent fixtures include obituaries, business, sport, culture and puzzles (The Times introduced Sudoku to the nation in 2004).\n\n1830 — The nickname The Thunderer is first established after The Times criticises a coroner’s verdict on the death of Lord Graves.\n\nJanuary 3, 1841 — William Howard Ainsworth’s Old St Paul’s is serialised in The Sunday Times and runs in the paper until December 26. This is widely believed to be the first novel serialised in a British newspaper.\n\nAugust 6, 1844 — The Times reports the birth of Queen Victoria’s second son, Prince Alfred, at Windsor. It’s the newspaper’s first story received by telegraph.\n\n1848 — John Walter II’s son, John Walter III, takes over The Times.\n\nOctober 12, 1854 — The Times launches the Soldiers’ Sick and Wounded Fund after reports of suffering during the Crimean War come from the newspaper’s Constantinople correspondent. The money raised funds the work of Florence Nightingale and her nurses in the Scutari and Therapia hospitals.\n\nApril 6, 1864 — Queen Victoria writes a letter in The Times defending her semi-retirement from public life after the death of Prince Albert.\n\nJanuary 1, 1868 — The Times is first printed with the Walter Press. It is a rotary printing press which uses cylinders to print and is designed by the newspaper.\n\nJanuary 1, 1870 — The Times becomes the first London daily newspaper to be typeset mechanically after Kastenbein composing machines are introduced. The machine could set up 298 lines of The Times and nearly 17,000 separate types in an hour.\n\nJuly 13, 1878 — The Times Paris correspondent Henri de Blowitz obtains the text of the Treaty of Berlin. It is published in a second edition on the day it was signed.\n\nOctober 17, 1878 — The Rapieff electric light system is installed at the Printing House Square machine room. It becomes one of the first places in England where electric light is in regular and constant use.\n\nJune 1, 1880 — The Times instals a telephone line between the Reporter’s Gallery and the composing room at its Printing House Square offices. This allows debates in the House of Commons to be reported up to 45 minutes later.\n\nNovember 2, 1887 — Alice Cornwell buys The Sunday Times for £3,000 and becomes its first female proprietor.\n\nJune 1, 1890 — Flora Shaw becomes the first woman staff correspondent of The Times when she is appointed colonial correspondent. She was the highest-paid female journalist at the time.\n\nCampaigners and philanthropists who have used the platform of The Times to generate support for their causes include Charles Dickens, William Morris, Lord Baden Powell, Rudyard Kipling, Sir John Betjeman and beyond. Some of the notable campaigns and funds are listed here.\n\n1803: The modern press gallery in the House of Commons owes its existence largely to a leading article in The Times, complaining about the difficulty reporters had had getting into the house to hear the debate about the declaration of war against France under Napoleon Bonaparte. The Speaker responded by making a ruling guaranteeing access to the press.\n\n1854: In 1828 and 1830 The Times had raised money from its readers for sufferers in Spain and France, but its first major campaign came about in 1854, in response to dispatches from the Crimean War. Thomas Chenery filed reports from the hospital at Scutari describing the appalling conditions for wounded soldiers, which were followed by a leading article berating the government and the publication of a letter from Sir Robert Peel starting a fund with a donation of £200. The Soldiers’ Sick and Wounded Fund was reinforced by vivid reports from the field written by the paper’s great foreign correspondent, William Howard Russell, and within a month had reached £12,000. The fund, and the paper’s almoner who went to the Crimea to administer its donations locally, was crucial in the success of the work of Florence Nightingale.\n\nSome years after the war The Times published a letter from a Crimea veteran appealing for help for Mary Seacole, who had run a boarding house at Balaclava but had fallen on hard times since her return. Donations poured in from old soldiers who remembered her with affection and gratitude and ensured that her last years were passed in comfort.\n\n1858: Closer to home, The Times instigated a campaign in support of “our homeless poor”. What became known as the Field Lane Ragged School Fund raised thousands to provide food and shelter for London’s destitute.\n\n1913: The Times Crystal Palace Fund. The Lord Mayor of London appealed to The Times to support the campaign to buy the Crystal Palace and its grounds and make them public property. After an appeal to its readers, the donations, which were led by the King and Queen, allowed the full amount to be raised and Crystal Palace to be saved for the nation.\n\n1914: The Times fund on behalf of the British Red Cross Society was opened on the outbreak of war in response to an appeal by Lord Rothschild, The Times committing itself to acknowledge all contributions in its columns. Some astonishing donations were received, and altogether by 1919, when the fund closed, more than £21 million had been raised, £16.5 million in cash through The Times fund. Donations even included motor cars and personal treasures which were auctioned for the cause.\n\n1920: An appeal for structural repairs to Westminster Abbey received donations from all over the English-speaking world.\n\n1925: The Dean and Chapter of St Paul’s Cathedral launched an appeal in conjunction with The Times to save the endangered structure of the building, especially the dome, which was threatening to collapse. The progress of the appeal was reported in The Times every day from its launch in January and by September more than £250,000 had been raised.\n\n1926: In recognition of their work during the general strike, The Times launched a National Police Fund. Within a month £223,000 had been raised, which rose to more than £1 million by the next year. The money went to build a clubhouse for the Metropolitan Police at Imber Court in Surrey.\n\n1929: After George V recovered from a serious illness The Times appealed for the establishment of a National Radium Fund. The £250,000 raised allowed the trustees to acquire radium for the treatment of cancer patients.\n\n1934: HG Wells wrote a letter to The Times appealing for donations for the setting up of a special unit for diabetes sufferers at King’s College Hospital in London. The response was so successful that he wrote again the following year proposing the formation of an association which “would bring together people with diabetes”. The Diabetic Association was developed into the British Diabetic Association in 1954 and in 2000 it was renamed Diabetes UK.\n\n1938: By carrying lists of donations, reports and associated letters and leaders, The Times was involved in Lord Baldwin’s Fund to raise money for refugees from Germany.\n\n1956: Roger Bannister wrote to The Times launching an appeal to raise funds to enable paraplegics to participate in sport — an important forerunner of the Paralympics.\n\n1999: £100,000 was raised by Times readers towards building of a bridge at Río Hondo, Honduras (after the devastating floods which hit the country in late February and early March). The bridge was opened in July 1999.\n\n1999: Millennium Appeal launched to restore St Ethelburga’s church which had been reduced to rubble by the “Bishopsgate bomb” planted by the IRA on April 24, 1993, that killed Edward Henty, a News of the World photographer, and injured 51 people."
