One page letter dated August 24, 1959 to a Miss Madge Rogers discussing South Pacific and Porgy & Bess. Letter has normal mail folds otherwise in FINE condition. Letter states, \"Yes, the Porgy and Bess film has been released in this country. It is quite beautiful and I think it will be very well liked when it reaches England, but I doubt that it will reach London before the end of the South Pacific run as Mr. Goldwyn believes the theatre that film is in is the best for the Todd-AO precess. As for my book of lyrics: This will be out toward the end of October. For technical copyright reasons it will not be published in England, but I shall be happy to send you a copy which you should receive sometime in November. With very best wishes, Ira Gershwin.\" Ira Gershwin was born on December 6, 1896, in New York City. Ira and his brothers' first collaboration came in 1918, with \"The Real American Folk Song.\" In 1932, Ira shared the honor of a Pulitzer Prize for the score, \"Of Thee I Sing.\" Over the course of their careers, the Gershwin brothers collaborated on more than 20 musicals and songs.
