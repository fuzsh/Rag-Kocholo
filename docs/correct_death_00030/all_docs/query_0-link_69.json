        "text": "George Gershwin and\n\nIrving Berlin\n\nEdward Jablonski\n\nGershwin\n\nA Biography,\n\nNew York: Doubleday, 1987 (paper-bound Ed. shown)\n\nAn early (c. 1918) meeting between Berlin and Gershwin, their second, came about when Berlin, who had been in the Army and aside from has Army show \"Yip, Yip, Yaphank\" hadn't been writing much, brought a song to the renowned music publisher Max Dreyfus. Dreyfus liked the song so Berlin asked him to call in someone to note it down. Dreyfus called in one of his song pluggers, George Gershwin. After writing it down, Gershwin immediately played his own arrangement. According to Gershwin biographer, Edward Jablonksi, Berlin said of Gershwin's arrangement of \"Revolutionary Rag,\" \"it was so good I hardly recognized it.\" The very young Gershwin recognizing the opportunity to hitch his coattails to the star songwriter Irving Berlin proposed that Berlin hire him as his \"musical secretary.\" \"Berlin's opinion was that [Gershwin] was too talented to subordinate his talent to that of another songwriter, even Irving Berlin. 'Stick to writing your own songs kid' (Jablonski, pp. 35-36).\n\ncast recording by the Houston Grand Opera, 1990\n\nAmazon iTunes\n\ncast recording for the 2011-2012 Production of\n\nThe Gershwins'\n\nPorgy and Bess\n\nAmazon iTunes\n\nFor a broad selection of Porgy and Bess recordings, click here.\n\nThe following bibliography of articles from the New York Times (and other publications) appearing during the summer and fall of 2011 and winter of 2012, chronicles a discussion about new productions of the George Gershwin, Ira Gershwin, and Dubose Heyward opera Porgy and Bess.\n\nThe excerpted passage below serves as an introduction to the discussion:\n\nIn a letter to The Times [see below], Mr. Sondheim declared his opposition to filling out the backstory of the characters of the show and changing its ending. His tone was angry, even mean, and while some speculated about ulterior motives, anyone who has read Mr. Sondheimâs opinionated book âFinishing the Hatâ knows this argument stems from strongly-held beliefs about âPorgy and Bess.â\n\nMs. [Diane] Paulus [the show's director] will have her chance to prove him wrong, and while she was surely not pleased with this feedback, I suspect it will only increase interest in her production and debate about the show. What was startling about Mr. Sondheimâs letter was its disregard for the diplomatic etiquette usually practiced by artists in the press. It suggested there are things in the theater more important than hurt feelings.\n\n(from a column titled \"Theater Talk-back: The Good That Comes From Bad Reviews\" by Jason Zinoman that appeared in The New York Times, April, 5, 2011.)\n\nThe citations below are in chronological order from earliest date to most recent and the links will take you to the articles themselves at NYTimes.com and the sites of other publications.
