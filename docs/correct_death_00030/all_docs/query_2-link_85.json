        "text": "By Steve ZALL and Sid FISH\n\nApril 2023\n\nIt’s great to see that more of the theatres we feared had been lost during the pandemic closure are opening their doors again with new shows. COVID protocols continue to be dictated by each individual venue so bring a facemask to wear during the show in case the venue requires it. It’s a good idea to check with the theatre before attending an event to find out what is their current policy.\n\nThe information presented in this column is the latest available at the time of printing; however, it should be verified with the theatre before making definite plans.\n\nHere are the shows that have announced opening dates for this month, or are already running:\n\nOPENING\n\n“Dark of the Moon: A New Musical” follows John, a witch boy from the Smoky Mountains, who falls in love with Barbara Allen, a beautiful and rebellious mortal girl who longs for more life than she finds in the fictitious Appalachian town of Buck Creek. John is willing to give up anything to be with Barbara Allen and makes a deal with the conjure people to give up his immortality and become mortal if Barbara and he can stay true to each other for a year. Based on the classic stage play of the same name, this new musical adaptation is the sexy, soulful tale of young lovers torn apart by prejudice and fear – a modern melding of “Twilight” and “Romeo and Juliet” loosely based on a centuries-old ballad. Heart wrenchingly beautiful, and profoundly poetic, “Dark of the Moon” features a dual score by an award-winning songwriting team with a bluegrass/folk sound voiced by the humans juxtaposed with a rock/soul sound from the witches.\n\nWritten by Jonathan Prince, with music by Lindy Robbins, Dave Bassett and Steve Robson, and directed by James O’Neil, it runs through April 16 at the Rubicon Theatre Company in Ventura. For tickets, call (805) 667-2900 or visit www.rubicontheatre.org.\n\n“Kiss of the Spider Woman” Set in a South American prison cell in a country under authoritarian rule, two polar opposites discover that love may spring in the most unlikely of places. Poignant, chilling, funny and sensual, this intimate two-hander is the story of Valentin, a macho political prisoner whose commitment to the Marxist cause takes precedence over everything else, and queer, movie-loving Molina, who escapes the harsh reality of prison life by retelling beloved film noir classics and emulating their glamorous leading ladies. Forced to share a cell in Buenos Aires’ notorious Villa Devoto prison during Argentina’s “Dirty War,” the two forge an unlikely relationship.\n\nWritten by Manuel Puig and directed by Michael Michetti, it runs through April 23 at A Noise Within in Pasadena. For tickets, call (626) 356-3100 or visit www.anoisewithin.org.\n\n“Accomplice” A woman, having an affair with her husband’s junior business partner, contrives to seize control of a significant portion of her husband’s company assets and dispose of her annoying spouse by poisoning his drink. Of course, if the plot were this simple this would be a remarkably short entertainment. However, the play manipulates our perceptions of who will be the perpetrator and who will be the victim with plot twists that occur with increasing frequency and velocity. Central to the action is the fact that there’s an accomplice in there somewhere whose participation ensures the success of the whole criminal undertaking. Just exactly who is the accomplice? Unless you’re already a dedicated mystery buff, you won’t see this one coming.\n\nWritten by Rupert Holmes and directed by Trace Oakley, it runs April 7 through April 29 at the Sherry Theatre in North Hollywood. For tickets, visit www.eventbrite.com/e/accomplice-tickets,-591780299807.\n\n“The Pilot Who Crashed the Party” An off-beat homage to the drawing room dramas of the ’30s, this unique and entertaining new play is set in the Santa Monica Mountains on a violent, stormy night filled with rain, lightning and thunder. The streets outside the mansion where Sally is celebrating her 50th birthday are narrow, winding and newly full of mud – when a pilot in a small, single engine plane literally crashes the party. Who, exactly, is this surprise guest?\n\nWritten and directed by Paul Sand, it runs April 8 through May 7 at the Broadwater Theatre Main Stage in Los Angeles. For tickets, visit www.onstage411.com/Pilot.\n\n“Battlesong of Boudica” The legions of conquering Rome have swept across the mist-shrouded island of Britannia and subdued most of its warring, disunified tribes. On the advice of his consort Boudica, Chief Prasutagus of the Iceni tribe has forged an alliance with the occupying Romans in hope of preserving his people’s liberty. But when Prasutagus is conscripted by Rome and killed in battle, Roman law refuses to recognize Boudica or her young daughters as the deceased chief’s heirs. For resisting the confiscation of her family’s ancestral home by the Romans, Boudica is flogged and her daughters brutally assaulted. Savaged, dishonored and discarded for dead, Boudica seeks a bloody revenge. Securing the chiefdom of her tribe by trial of fight, Boudica sends word across Britannia: Rise up, unite and push the Romans out. Soon all of Celtic Britannia is in revolt, rallied beneath the banner of War Chief Boudica. But the steeled force of Rome intends neither surrender nor retreat. And so, the stage is set for an epic battle, the subject of legends and songs sung across two millennia.\n\nWritten and directed by Christopher William Johnson, it runs April 9 through April 30 at the Hudson Backstage in Hollywood. For tickets, visit www.school-of-night.ticketleap.com/battlesong-of-boudica.\n\n“Ava: The Secret Conversations” “I either write the book or sell the jewels. I’m kinda sentimental about the jewels.” So says legendary Hollywood icon Ava Gardner to her ghostwriter Peter Evans as they begin work on her tell-all biography that will shock Tinseltown. But as Peter attempts to glean the juicy details about her life story, her marriages to Mickey Rooney, Artie Shaw and Frank Sinatra, and her turbulent relationship to Howard Hughes, an altogether different and unexpected journey unfolds in this theatrical glimpse into the private life of Hollywood’s original femme fatale.\n\nWritten by Elizabeth McGovern and directed by Moritz von Stuelpnagel, it runs April 13 through May 7 at the Gil Cates Theater at the Geffen Playhouse in Westwood. For tickets, call (310) 208-2028 or visit www.geffenplayhouse.org.\n\n“George Gershwin Alone: Final Farewell Performances of Gershwin” This exploration of Gershwin’s short but extraordinary life illuminates the master tunesmith whose work shaped a distinctly American style of music. “George Gershwin Alone” spotlights this brilliant composer’s prolific partnership with his brother, lyricist Ira Gershwin, and incorporates beloved songs ranging from the popular hits “Fascinating Rhythm,” “I Got Rhythm,” “’S Wonderful” and “They Can’t Take That Away from Me” to excerpts from ground-breaking musicals “Porgy and Bess” and “An American in Paris” and a complete performance of “Rhapsody In Blue.”\n\nWritten by Hershey Felder, with music by George Gershwin and Ira Gershwin, and directed by Joel Zwick, it runs April 13 through April 16 at the Wallis Annenberg Center for the Performing Arts Bram Goldsmith Theater in Beverly Hills. For tickets, call (310) 746-4000 or visit www.TheWallis.org.\n\n“An American In Paris” Originally a jazz-influenced orchestral piece by American composer George Gershwin that was first performed in 1928, this version of the “An American in Paris” musical is inspired by the Academy Award-winning hit 1951 movie of the same name that starred Gene Kelly and Leslie Caron. An American soldier, an alluring French woman and an indomitable European city each yearn for a new beginning in the aftermath of World War II. MTW’s “An American in Paris” will feature an enchanting score by George and Ira Gershwin, a fresh, sophisticated book by Tony nominee and Pulitzer Prize finalist Craig Lucas, and stunning choreography from tap to ballet that will sweep audiences off their feet!\n\nWritten by Craig Lucas, with music by George and Ira Gershwin, and directed by Jeffry Denman, it runs April 14 through April 30 at the Carpenter Performing Arts Center in Long Beach. For tickets, call (562) 856-1999 or visit www.musical.org.\n\n“The Laramie Project” In 1998, Matthew Shephard, a college student at the University of Wyoming was kidnapped, beaten, tied to a fence and left to die. His crime? Being gay. Kaufman, Fondakowski and members of the Tectonic Theater Project made six trips to Laramie over the course of a year and a half. They conducted more than 200 interviews with the people of the town. The breadth of the reactions to the crime is fascinating. They have constructed a deeply moving theatrical experience from these interviews and their own experiences in Laramie. This play is a breathtaking collage that explores the depths to which humanity can sink and the heights of compassion of which we are capable.\n\nWritten by Moises Kaufman, Ms. Leigh Fondakowski and The Techtonic Theater Project, and directed by Kathleen Delaney, it runs April 14 through May 21 at the Lonny Chapman Theatre Main Stage in North Hollywood. For tickets, call (818) 761-8838 or visit www.roadtheatre.org.\n\n“Moose on the Loose” The Tappino family left their impoverished existence in Calabria, Italy decades ago for America in search of a better life, like generations of immigrant families before them. They got as far as Way Up Bay, a remote little town somewhere in a frosty part of Ontario, Canada and they stayed there. And they had kids. And then they had grandkids. Daughter Gina left home to establish herself in the professional world of marketing and now she’s coming home to Way Up Bay to take a year off from work. It’s not a simple vacation. She has a hidden agenda. What could it be? Ironically, the day she arrives a moose wanders into the Tappinos’ residential neighborhood and, in a town where the most popular television station is The Weather Channel, a moose on the loose is big news. This arouses some concern as moose can be wild, unpredictable and are downright enormous. So, Daddy Giuseppe decides to go after it with a gun. And the local police go after him. Because this is a comedy about a large and loving albeit chaotic Italian extended family (sister Carmela has an Anglo husband, brother Bruno has an indigenous girlfriend), the action will sooner or later wind up at the dinner table. What’s Gina’s big secret? What will happen to Giuseppe? What will happen to the moose? How long will it take the Tappinos to discover that the moose is not the only one who is displaced and confused?\n\nWritten by Dina Morrone and directed by Peter Flood, it runs April 14 through May 21 at Theatre West in Los Angeles. For tickets, call (323) 851-7977 or visit www.theatrewest.org.\n\n“Scintilla” Michael and Nora travel to visit his mother Marianne, a reclusive artist who lives at the edge of the woods in California’s Wine Country.

The rising tension exposes a complicated family history erupting into a larger question about our very survival on this planet.\n\nWritten by Alessandro Camon and directed by Ann Hearn Tobolowsky, it runs April 14 through June 4 at the Road Theatre in North Hollywood.

The indelible music, created from the 1998 musical, is based on the 1984 film and has truly stood the test of time. Not only is “Footloose” a coming-of-age story or a struggle to fit in, but one that digs far deeper into the impact of death on people’s lives and how they choose to move on from it or, in this case, how they choose not to move on from it. The show tells the story of a city-slicker outsider Ren McCormack and his mother Ethel as they move from fast-paced Chicago to a much slower Beaumont, Texas in search of a change of pace and hopefully a better life.\n\nWritten by Dean Pitchford and Walter Bobbie, with music by Tom Snow, lyrics by Dean Pitchford and Kenny Loggins, and directed by Barry Pearl and Michelle Elkin, it runs April 22 through May 14 at the Simi Valley Cultural Arts Center in Simi Valley.
