        "text": "When George Gershwin died on July 11, 1937, he left behind a rich musical legacy that was celebrated by people around the globe. “Gather Ye Rosebuds,” also known as “Gershwin Melody #107,” was a different part of his musical legacy – one that almost no one ever had a chance to hear: his music that got no further than his musical notebooks. Those are the songs that I celebrate here at Gershwin 100.\n\nI found “Gather Ye Rosebuds” recently on a trip to the Library of Congress (LOC). It seems a fitting tribute to commemorate the anniversary of Gershwin’s death. Ira Gershwin used a line from Robert Herrick‘s 17th century poem “To the Virgins, to Make Much of Time” as his title and thematic inspiration. It impressive to me how Ira is able to write sentimental lyrics for the dulcet music of stanzas 1, 2, and 4 (see lyrics below), while the scherzo music of stanza 3 receives a coarser lyric which still ties in well with the overall theme of the song.\n\nOn my trip to the LOC, I was fortunate to be able to spend some time with piano player extraordinaire Alex Hassan. As a devotee of the Great American Songbook written between the World Wars, Alex along with his wife Sara are sagacious collectors of sheet music of the era, and they’ll even sell you some of their finds on eBay. He was happy to give this song a quick run-through which I recorded live on low-fi equipment, but it certainly is a welcome respite from my typical GarageBand renditions. I hope you enjoy his playing as much as I do (see SoundCloud file below).\n\nDownload the PDF of the simplified sheet music to here: Gather Ye Rosebuds – Gershwin Melody #107\n\nOscar Hammerstein II’s Eulogy for George Gershwin\n\nIn keeping with the “Gather Ye Rosebuds” theme, here is what friend and Gershwin collaborator (Song of the Flame) Oscar Hammerstein II had to say on September 8, 1937 at the Gershwin Memorial Concert in Hollywood, two months after Gershwin’s death:\n\n“Our friend wrote music, and in that mould he created gaiety and sweetness and beauty. And 24 hours after he had gone, his music filled the air and in triumphant accents proclaimed to this world of men that gaiety and sweetness and beauty do not die.\n\nA genius differs from other men only in that his immortality is tangible. What he thought, what he felt, what he meant has been crystallized in a form of expression, a form far sturdier than the flesh and sinew of the man. But lesser beings than geniuses leave their marks upon this earth, and it is as a lesser being that George Gershwin’s friends knew him and loved him.\n\nWe remember a young man who remained naive in a sophisticated world. We remember a smile that was nearly always on his face, a cigar that was nearly always in his mouth. He was a lucky young man, lucky to be so in love with the world, and lucky because the world was so in love with him. It endowed him with talent. It endowed him with character. And rarest of all things, it gave him a complete capacity for enjoying all his gifts.\n\nIt was a standing joke with us that George could not be dragged away from a piano. He loved to play the piano. He played well, and he enjoyed his own playing. How glad we are now that some divine instinct made him snatch every precious second he could get at that keyboard, made him drink exultantly of his joy-giving talent, made him crowd every grain of gratification he could get into his short, blessed life.\n\nMaybe the greatest thing he left us is this lesson: Maybe we take the good things of life too much for granted. Maybe we took George too much for granted. We loved him. Should we not have loved him more? Have we ever loved him so much as we do now? Have we ever said so as we do now? We are all inadequate, muddling humans with hearts and minds woefully unequipped to solve the problems that beset us. We are eloquent in the recognition of our troubles. Why are we not equally eloquent in the recognition of our blessings as George was?\n\nSome will want a statue erected for him. He deserves this. Some will want to endow a school of music in his name. He deserves this. But his friends could add one more tribute: In his honor they could try to appreciate and be grateful for the good things in this world. In his honor they could try to be kinder to one another, and this would be the finest monument of all.”\n\nLyrics to “Gather Ye Rosebuds” by Ira Gershwin:\n\nPuritans there are who say, “It is sinful to be gay.”\n\nBut I cannot share that view. Life’s too short to be blue.\n\nThere’s no one can stand the gaff, ‘less they learn the way to laugh.\n\nI’m for the poet who said one day, “Gather ye rosebuds while you may.”\n\nThe thing to do from every Monday to Sunday is to make of every one day a fun day.\n\nWhat’s the use of taking time out for sorrow? You’re here today and gone tomorrow.\n\nWhy turn down the sun and watchfully wait for the well-known rainy day?\n\nRather – gather rosebuds while ye may.\n\nNow Lincoln liked to have his little joke. And Grant was never seen without a smoke.\n\nWhen Bobbie Burns and Edgar Allen Poe were asked to have a drink, did they say, “No”?\n\nYou’ll find the famous men from A to Z were somehow always ready for a spree.\n\nThose names have never faded and anything that they did,\n\nI’m here to tell the world, is good enough for me."
