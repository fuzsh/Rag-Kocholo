        "text": "If you’re a fan of George Gershwin’s music, you may want to head over to a once-in-a-lifetime exhibition of his visual artwork at the Baker Museum in Naples, Florida, now through June 16, 2024. (Or experience it a bit vicariously here as a second-best option.)\n\nThe show titled George Gershwin and Modern Art—A Rhapsody in Blue is a 6-room collection of around 60 Gershwin-related works of art gathered from around the world (including from the Vatican!), that was the brainchild of guest curator and musicologist Dr. Olivia Mattis and her 20 years of research on the topic. The show is comprised of Gershwin’s original paintings, drawings, and photographs; paintings from his valuable art collection; Gershwin-themed art by Andy Warhol among others; and even a Rhapsody manuscript page in his hand.\n\nThe Baker Museum in Naples is uniquely qualified to host this exhibition which has also included Gershwin concerts and lectures that celebrate his Rhapsody’s centennial this year, as the museum is in the Artis—Naples art campus which is also home to the Naples Philharmonic orchestra as well as various performance and lecture halls. A schedule of Gershwin events can be found here.\n\nFor those geographically able to attend, Naples is driveable from Tampa (1 hr.), Fort Myers (40 min.), and Miami and Ft. Lauderdale (3 hr.)—your times vary. Open till 4pm Tuesday through Sunday, admission is $10 for adults, and free from 6-9pm on March 27, 2024, so even the most mildly intrigued locals really have no excuse to stay home (except maybe for the rare medical emergency or book club meeting where you actually read the book this month!).\n\nGershwin’s Art Collection and Originals Reunited for the 21st Century\n\nBringing together such a comprehensive look at Gershwin’s non-musical art is no simple task, but it was a true labor of love for guest curator Dr. Olivia Mattis, who specializes in links between music and the visual arts. The co-curator for the exhibition is the Museum Director Courtney McNeil, who joined Mattis on several research trips, in the search for Gershwin’s gold.\n\nMattis kindly sat to speak with me about the exhibition and her forthcoming book which delves deeper into the subject and is due to be released on April 24, 2024.\n\nMy first thought about this exhibition and the accompanying book was that it would have been a rather burdensome undertaking. As someone who does plenty of Gershwin research, I was a bit surprised that the first word that Mattis used to describe this culmination of 20 years of her research and all the effort involved in obtaining the artworks for display was the word “fun”! Maybe that’s because she was “certain it would never happen” at one point in time.\n\nMattis’ relief and excitement over the fact that the Baker Museum’s show actually came to be is clear when speaking to her about it. She is especially proud of the artworks from George’s personal collection by Modigliani, Chagall, Noguchi, Max Weber, and Burliuk, though she and museum director Courtney McNeil were somehow unable to get Gershwin’s Picasso painting, though a high-quality reproduction of it is featured.\n\nAnother highlight of the collection is Mattis’ discovery of a basically unknown and quite revelatory treasure trove of correspondence between Gershwin and his cousin, the artist Henry Botkin, who taught George to paint and was his European art advisor and buyer. Botkin described Gershwin’s array of works as “One of the most significant collections of modern art in America.” I read once that George’s mother Rose advised her children to buy a few precious stones when they were flush because they were easy to pawn for cash when times got leaner. Instead of diamonds, Gershwin preferred to invest (wisely it turns out) in painted gems of Picasso, Modigliani, Kandinsky, etc.\n\nWhen I asked Olivia Mattis which piece from the collection would be the most cherished to have hanging on her walls at home, she chose the photograph that George took of himself and Irving Berlin, as she has a deep appreciation for Gershwin’s own photography, with many examples on display at the Baker.\n\nFortunately, Mattis was not going to let people walk through the installation in silence, as three of the six rooms play a variety of Gershwin songs, and the Porgy and Bess room features the voices of John W. Bubbles and Ruby Elzy, who was one of the fortunate few to have her portrait painted by Gershwin.\n\nEven though the Gershwin family did sell off plenty of George’s valuable art collection, Mattis was able to locate images of many of those works in order to feature them in the upcoming book, which shares the same name as the exhibition: George Gershwin and Modern Art—A Rhapsody in Blue. She has found wonderful quotes regarding color in painting and color in music that give insights into the connections Gershwin made between his music and his art.\n\nAs I am on the opposite coast of the US, I will have a harder time than some to drive on over to the exhibition, but to a Gershwin admirer like myself, it looks incredible, and my only lament would be that I would never want it to end.\n\nThe Gold Mine that Is Gershwin’s Artistic Achievement\n\nAs always, I like to feature a rare Gershwin song in my blog posts, and Gershwin Melody #106 seems the perfect song because of its alternate title, “Gold Mine.” (I had initially contemplated using the song “Oh, What She Hangs Out,” but as you may see in a future posting, nothing but the title seemed right about that pairing.\n\nThe Baker Museum exhibition reveals the gold mine that is Gershwin’s visual artistic legacy, and the Library of Congress (LOC) holds Gershwin’s known and little-known musical legacy.\n\nThis song from the LOC’s Gershwin collection was arranged by Kay Swift, likely from a Gershwin musical manuscript sketch. The most glaring oddity of her arrangement is how the song ends on an unresolved dominant chord tone which desperately wants to be followed by the tonic chord. It ends with a double bar line, though not an end bar line, possibly suggesting this was intended to be a verse to a chorus that she never got around to.\n\nWhen performed, the musical structure sounds a bit off-putting. The first three 4-bar sections have the same basic melodic formula, followed by 4 bars of a new melody, and then 4 bars of a slow grand ending. So, if Kay Swift interpreted Gershwin correctly, the form appears to be a quite unusual AAABC, at the 4-bar-unit level. I can’t rule out that Gershwin planned it this way, as subverting expectations is a Gershwin strong suit. My sheet music version below adds two measures of resolution to the end in order to un-subvert expectations and make for more enjoyable listening and playing. I also added a lyric by adapting Ira Gershwin’s song “Honeymoon,” and I even shoehorned in a reference to a gold mine for fun.\n\nMy YouTube demo of the song varies from the sheet music I created. I transposed from E-flat major to F major on the sheet music, and the demo has a repeat of the entire song and the ending melodic phrases are different."
