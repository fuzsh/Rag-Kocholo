        "text": "What he has achieved was not only to the benefit of a national American music, but also a contribution to the music of the whole world.\n\nArnold Schoenberg's eulogy of George Gershwin , July 12, 1937\n\nAfter their long train ride from New York through Chicago and across the West, Arnold, Gertrud , and Nuria Schoenberg arrived at the Pasadena Train Station in mid September in 1934 and headed for a hotel. They found a room at the Hotel Constance , a seven-story structure on Colorado Boulevard in downtown Pasadena. The building was still standing into the twenty-first century, rising in neo-Italian Renaissance splendor, towering above everything around it. Built in 1928 near the end of the resort era, it belonged to the legacy of Pasadena 's Eastern, health-seeker past.1 Perhaps the hotel's name reminded the Schoenbergs of the Europe they left behind. Within two weeks of their arrival, a friend from Vienna with whom Schoenberg had played string quartets in their youth, film composer Hugo Riesenfeld , found a furnished house at 5860 Canyon Cove that they could rent in his neighborhood in the Hollywood Hills , a little over two miles north of Paramount Pictures . They settled in, and obtained a car (see Figure 2.1). For the next 1½ years of the Schoenbergs’ life in California, Hollywood was their home.2\n\nCourtesy Arnold Schönberg Center.\n\nFew institutions held a fascination for the exiles like Hollywood . In scholarship on the exiles, perhaps no other single institution in the West has garnered as much attention.3 “Arnold Schönberg and Igor Stravinsky ,” wrote contemporary composer/conductor René Leibowitz , “the two most important composers of today…have settled down in Hollywood, which is about as far as a European can ‘go West.’”4 Although almost all seemed to hold it in contempt, many exiles nonetheless saw the entertainment industry as a lifeline during the Great Depression. One of the few places in the United States in the 1930s where American- and foreign-born artists had a chance of doing exceedingly well, Hollywood was also a rare site of religious toleration: a city where Jews and Gentiles intermingled relatively freely.5 The multiple advantages of living near Hollywood intrigued Schoenberg, and while he hardly had plans of becoming a serious film composer, he hoped to profit from the film industry in another way: by teaching music theory and composition to musicians in Hollywood. The film industry thus became an early and important source of income and connections, where he found not only students but also friends and colleagues.\n\nThis means that we should be careful in creating borders between classical and popular music, and between classical and popular musicians, in Southern California. Such borders increasingly had less of a place in the diversified environment of modern music in the region. Out of necessity, many art music composers used the film industry to support themselves and their families, which thus enabled them to do the art music projects or compositions they wanted to achieve. Although Schoenberg never completed a film score for a studio, it is impossible to discuss his life and work in Southern California without reference to Hollywood, either in terms of the works he created or the people with whom he associated. On a level perhaps even he would have been astounded at prior to his immigration, Schoenberg maintained ties to Hollywood until the end of his life.\n\nLike many of the exiles, Schoenberg had a strong interest in the medium of film well before he immigrated to the United States. When talking pictures first appeared in 1927, he wrote on the power and potential of film as a means of communication, pointing to one of his idols, Charlie Chaplin , as an example of what filmmakers could, and should, achieve. “One should not consider the talking film to be simply a coupling of picture, language, and music,” he declared. “On the contrary, it is a completely new and independent instrument for innovative artistic expression.” The future was bright, he wrote, because “the application of overall standards will become the rule, standards that up to now could only be reached by exceptionally gifted personalities like Chaplin.”6\n\nHow did Schoenberg, the preeminent modernist composer, hope to achieve his goals in Hollywood? What network of students and colleagues in the entertainment world did he benefit from? And how did the presence of other émigré composers in Hollywood – among them Igor Stravinsky , Ernst Toch, and Hanns Eisler – shape modernism in Southern California? The film industry proved to be a major factor in enticing Schoenberg to the West Coast, although he insisted on meeting that industry on his own terms."
