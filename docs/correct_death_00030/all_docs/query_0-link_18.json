His parents eventually changed the family name to Gershvin, and still later to Gershwin.\n\nGershwin, along with his brother, George, was said to have help the American musical find, \"its native idiom.\"\n\nAmong his best known songs are: Someone to Watch Over Me, I Got Rhythm, and They Can't Take That Away From Me. He also wrote the libretto for his brother's Opera Porgy and Bess.\n\nIra Gershwin died on August 17, 1983 in Beverly Hills, California, and was interred at Westchester Hills Cemetery in Hastings-on-Hudson, NY."
