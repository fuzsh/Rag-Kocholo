        "text": "On November 15, 2004, The New York Times ran an obituary headlined ROBERT KOCH WOOLF, 81, decorator for the stars. David Colman, a style columnist for the paper, wrote, “Robert Koch Woolf, the Los Angeles decorator who with his partner, the architect John Elgin Woolf, created a new style of luxury in Hollywood in the 1950’s and 1960’s, died on Nov. 3 at his home in Montecito, Calif.… The cause was complications of surgery, according to Gene Woolf, his adopted brother, and William Woolf, his companion, who are his only survivors.” According to the obituary, Robert and John Woolf “established a new vocabulary for glamorous movie-star living; they synthesized 19th-century French, Greek Revival and Modernist touches into a heady mixture that has since been christened Hollywood Regency, which foreshadowed aspects of postmodernism. They designed houses for, among others, George Cukor, John Wayne, David O. Selznick and Barbara Hutton.”\n\nI was familiar with the work of John and Robert Woolf. In fact, I had had an interview with Robert Woolf just weeks before he died, when he completed telling me his life story, an up-from-nothing tale that brought him from rural Texas to the heart of bygone glitter in Hollywood, where, as the partner, lover, and adopted son of the architect John Woolf, he circulated at the highest levels for decades. John Elgin Woolf, or Jack, as he was known, had died in 1980. Along with Wallace Neff, who designed Pickfair for Mary Pickford and Douglas Fairbanks, and Paul R. Williams, who did Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz’s house and an addition to the Beverly Hills Hotel, he was a top architect to L.A.’s carriage trade. Though less well known today than Neff and Williams, Woolf had more big names on his client list than the other two combined, and he was a frequent subject of articles in House and Garden and Architectural Digest.\n\nIn 2002, I had received the catalogue for an upcoming exhibition at the University of California at Santa Barbara’s art museum called “The Art of Luxury: 9 Hollywood Homes by John Elgin Woolf.” At the back of the catalogue was a four-page list of Woolf’s clients and the houses he had designed for them. The list included:\n\n• Cary Grant, 9966 Beverly Grove Drive, Los Angeles.\n\n• Errol Flynn, 7740 Mulholland Drive, Los Angeles.\n\n• Vincente Minnelli and Judy Garland, 8850 Evanview Drive, Los Angeles.\n\n• Barbara Stanwyck, 273 South Glen Boulevard, Los Angeles.\n\n• Ira and Leonore Gershwin, 1021 North Roxbury Drive, Beverly Hills.\n\n• Fanny Brice, 312 North Faring Road, Los Angeles.\n\n• Bob Hope, 10346 Moorpark Street, North Hollywood.\n\n• Agnes Moorehead, 1023 North Roxbury Drive, Beverly Hills.\n\n• Ronald Colman, 1003 Summit Drive, Beverly Hills.\n\n• Charles Feldman and Jean Howard, 2000 Coldwater Canyon, Los Angeles.\n\n• Lillian Gish, Trancas Beach, Malibu.\n\n• Mervyn LeRoy, 332 St. Cloud Road, Bel Air.\n\n• Paul Lynde, 103 Robin Drive, Los Angeles.\n\n• Ray Milland, 10664 Bellagio Road, Los Angeles.\n\n• Ricardo and Georgiana Montalban, 9256 Robin Drive, Los Angeles.\n\n• Loretta Young, 8313 Fountain Avenue, Los Angeles.\n\n• Katharine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy, 9191 St. Ives Drive, Beverly Hills.\n\nNear the bottom of the list was a Beverly Hills real-estate agent I knew, Bruce Nelson. I called him and asked what he could tell me about John Woolf. He said that, bizarre as it might sound, Jack had adopted his young partner, Robert Koch, and later brought two other young men, Gene Oney and William Capp, into their household. “I just got off the phone with Robert, the oldest of his adopted sons, five minutes ago,” he said. “They all live together in Montecito.” I asked if he would introduce me. “I’ll call Bob back right now,” he said. Five minutes later, Nelson phoned to say, “Bob is waiting for your call.”\n\nWhen I punched in the number, a man with a rather weak voice answered. “Is this Bob Woolf?,” I asked. “This is Robert Woolf,” he said with cool emphasis. By the end of our conversation, however, he seemed pleased that someone was interested in writing about his late father, whom he referred to throughout our talk as Papa. I asked if I could drive up to Montecito to visit him and his brothers, and we set a date for later that week.\n\nMy introduction to John Woolf’s work had come much earlier, in 1994, when I went to his most famous house, the Pendleton house, on North Beverly Drive, in Beverly Hills, to interview its owner, the producer Robert Evans, for a Vanity Fair profile timed to the publication of his autobiography, The Kid Stays in the Picture.\n\nI had studied a bit of the history of the house and learned that on a rainy day in 1942, the year it was completed, the young architect had had a chance encounter in the gravel entry court. The place was so unusual that two women had stopped to admire the gray-painted stucco façade with a mansard roof, tall black lacquered double front doors, and a rounded portico supported by slender Greek Revival columns. It seemed unique: a mix of delicate design features that evoked the Petit Trianon of Marie Antoinette, the French and English Regency periods, and the stylized look of a Hollywood stage set. The hodgepodge of design idioms should have been unsettling to the eye, but somehow it all came together to form a pleasing whole.\n\nThe house was also a major departure from the white stucco haciendas, half-timber Tudor-style homes, and Churrigueresque villas that were standard on the big lots north of Sunset Boulevard, where movie stars and studio chiefs built in the days before the income tax and the Depression dictated more sober dwellings. It was a perfect example of what would come to be called Hollywood Regency.\n\nWoolf’s clients, the prominent art dealer and interior decorator James Pendleton and his wife, Mary Frances, had plucked the handsome architect from near obscurity and given him the break of a lifetime. They told him to design a house for entertaining, with a pool and pool house, set among a grove of eucalyptus and gardens of lilacs and roses. Because Mary Frances had a deformed hip and couldn’t climb stairs, the house had to be on one level. Woolf was given only 10 days to produce finished plans, and a year to get the place built. The Pendletons, whose home base was in Manhattan, were eager to move into their new retreat, set on four acres of land they had bought for $10,000 (the equivalent of $140,000 today) from the writer Dorothy Parker.\n\nWhat awaited the architect, then 34, in the Pendletons’ driveway that day could only be construed as a good omen. The two women he encountered were Greta Garbo and her friend Gladys Belzer, one of the most prominent interior decorators in Los Angeles and the mother of the movie star Loretta Young. The ladies were attempting to get an early peek at their wealthy friends’ new house, and they were happy to meet the bright new architect in town and introduce him around.\n\nVogue featured the house in its November 1942 issue. Later, Slim Aarons photographed it. One of his pictures, taken from the back patio, looking toward the folly-like pool pavilion, shows a white-jacketed butler serving the Pendletons and their guests tea in front of an oval pool. It would become one of the iconic images of Hollywood luxury.\n\nThe house today appears little changed. It is low-slung and darkly handsome, and is now covered with vines. Two urns stand in niches on either side of the portico, and French windows beside the niches are concealed by shutters. The lack of visible windows makes the façade somewhat blank and mysterious. At the time the house was built, this kind of façade was rare in Los Angeles, where the grander homes—the big mansions fronting Sunset Boulevard, for example—tried hard to impress from the outside.\n\n“People had simply never seen a house like the Pendletons’ before,” I was told by Kurt White, a decorator and longtime friend of Woolf’s who had worked with him in the 1940s and 1950s. “After the couple were in that house, Jack was a made man, because people didn’t know that a house could look like that—be so top-to-bottom glamorous. After they saw it, they simply had to have one themselves. Remember, these were people who were in the theatrical and movie business, who wanted to live their daily lives in settings like those in their movies.\n\n“A Woolf house is a kind of a mystery house,” White continued. “Very plain on the outside, but you know that there are courtyards and all sorts of views and tricks. Jack was great at that. I mean, you’d come into an octagonal foyer, and from there you’d go into a gallery. At either end of the long gallery would be circular hallways that dropped you into various rooms. His floor plans were always full of surprises. They were the kinds of houses you dressed up to go to. I remember the first time I went to the Pendleton house. The swimming pool was surrounded with a little pipe that had small openings in it, and Jimmy Pendleton flicked a switch and the fountains that went around the swimming pool went on. Inside the living room, you looked down through a fireplace that had a window over it, and the flues were on either side. It was spellbinding. Perfect scale. Jack was a master of scale.”\n\nIf anyone has ever used a Woolf house to its full potential as a showplace, it is Robert Evans, who treats his home like a stage set on which he is the leading man. When I interviewed him in 2006, he told me about the day he fell in love with the house. He was brought to see it by the great film star Norma Shearer, who had discovered him in 1956 at the Beverly Hills Hotel swimming pool and spontaneously cast him to play her late husband, MGM production chief Irving Thalberg, in a film called Man of a Thousand Faces. “When we walked in the gate, Norma said, ‘It’s so unlike Los Angeles. You feel like you’re in the South of France when you’re here,’” Evans recalled. “We walked through the front, and there before me were thousands of roses. I looked around the house and I was mesmerized—not by its size, but by its beauty. And I said to myself, One day I’m going to own this. Ten years passed, and Charlie Bluhdorn [the C.E.O. of the parent company of Paramount Pictures, where Evans had become head of production] told me he wanted me to buy a house in Los Angeles, because he wanted me to build a screening room so that he could see films when he came out from New York.\n\n“So the first house I went to was the Pendletons’, and I just rang the guy’s doorbell. It was not for sale. But, as they say, in Los Angeles everything is for sale. I said, ‘You know, I’ve only seen your home once, but I’ve fantasized about it for a decade. And I don’t wish to be presumptuous, but I’m moving here. If you have any desire to sell your house, you’ll be turning it over to someone who appreciates the work that went into it.’ Pendleton’s wife had died, and he was living here alone. He said, ‘Actually, I’ve been thinking of moving to Palm Springs.’ Which he did. And, to make a very long story short, I bought it for $290,000. I put over a million dollars into it, including a state-of-the-art projection room.”\n\nAs we toured the house, Evans reminisced: “It’s a strange thing—there were more deals made here than at Paramount. Charlie Bluhdorn used to use it every weekend for meetings. The deal for The Godfather was made here; the deal for Chinatown was made here. Orson Welles loved to come here, and Alain Delon stayed here for six months. Roman Polanski lived here after [his wife Sharon Tate’s] murder. Laurence Olivier lived here for six months when he was making Marathon Man. Some very famous women stayed here, but I can’t—let me just phrase it that I’ve had at least three dozen above-the-title female stars stay here. I don’t mean for the night—I mean they resided here for a while. Mario Puzo and I met here, and figuratively fell in love, and he used to be here all the time, playing tennis. Johnny Carson played tennis here; so did Merv Griffin. Jack Nicholson gave me a great line: ‘Let me tell you something, kid. Since the fire in your screening room’—it burned down in 2003—‘I haven’t had any pussy!’”\n\nOne of the houses Woolf built in the Pendleton style was for Alphonzo Bell Jr., the son of the founder of Bel Air and in the 1960s a U.S. congressman from the Beverly Hills area. Today the house, which is a stone’s throw from the Pendleton house, is owned by the witty former top Hollywood talent agent Sue Mengers, who said when I visited her, “Have you seen Bob Evans’s house? Well, that’s the real one, if you know what I mean. I feel like this is the little guesthouse of Bob’s.” Mengers holds court in her living room, which has a bowed picture window that looks out onto an egg-shaped swimming pool, surrounded by a peristyle of Doric columns. When the Bells owned the house, the nursery had doors that led to the pool. Not long after they moved in, their two infant sons crawled through the open doors and fell into the pool, and one of them drowned. The Bells sold the house after living in it for less than a year, and Mengers and her late husband bought it from the subsequent owner. As she told me with a gesture, “We really did nothing structural to this house, except add the bookcase, there on the wall.” The house has an oval dining room where Mengers entertains with small dinners only, of “10 people—max. That’s the most I’ve ever had in almost 15 years.”\n\nBefore visiting the Woolfs in Montecito, I had lunch with Bruce Nelson, who briefed me on the relationship of Robert, Gene, and William. John Woolf, who died in 1980 from an accidental Valium overdose administered at the hospital where he was being treated for Parkinson’s disease, had adopted Robert and Gene in 1971. Nelson said the three men, who were about 80, 60, and 40, still lived together as brothers, though William was never officially adopted. At one point they had owned the largest house in Montecito, on Park Lane, built in the 1930s for a Union Carbide heir and designed by the Palm Beach architect Addison Mizner. Robert, who had been John Woolf’s business partner, had sold the house on Park Lane in the early 1990s for $10 million. (He had paid $1.5 million for it in 1980, just before John Woolf died.) He and his brothers were living in a grand, Spanish-style house. Robert, Nelson emphasized, was the dominant member of the family.\n\n“When Jack Woolf was alive, he was the star,” Nelson said. “Robert was a decorator—and an extremely talented one—but then, when Jack died, Robert didn’t close up shop. He went on with the formula they had developed—and they developed it together. And the money that was made was really made by Bob buying and selling houses. He had a golden touch. Jack was pure talent, but Bob was a business genius.”\n\nMontecito, in the foothills of the Santa Ynez Mountains, east of Santa Barbara, is among the wealthiest areas in the United States in terms of per capita income. The estates are large, and the houses are rarely visible from the winding roads, which are lined with low, sandstone walls. On the appointed day, I pulled into the driveway of the Woolfs’ mansion. Two gold Jeep Cherokees were parked head-to-head, one with the license plate woolf1. In the garage were a blue Rolls-Royce and woolf2—a red Bentley.\n\nThe front door was answered by Julio, a houseboy, whose name was embroidered on his white waiter’s jacket. Two barking standard poodles, Honey and Sweetie, were behind him, and behind them Robert Woolf was coming slowly toward me, smiling broadly. At 80 he was still handsome, with short-clipped white hair, great presence, and piercing blue eyes.\n\nIn the entry hall, after our introductions, there was a moment of confusion. Robert pointed to a Regency commode, originally from the Pendleton house. “That’s Jack Woolf,” he said. I thought for a moment he meant that Woolf’s ashes were inside. But then he pointed to the carpet in the hall and said, “That’s Jack Woolf also. Custom-made.” Later I learned that Jack Woolf is buried in the Garden of Remembrance at Forest Lawn, Glendale. “We have a beautiful mausoleum in the important area, near Mary Pickford,” Robert said. “It’s for six people—room for Papa, Gene, William, and me.”\n\nWe went into the sunroom, and Julio brought glasses of beer with ice in them. Indicating some Mylar helium balloons floating near the ceiling, Robert said, “They’re from a party we had here the other day. You see, I almost died. I was very sick with peritonitis, and Gene and William thought I was gone, and then, suddenly, after the doctor told them I had only a few days to live, I came back to life! So, we had a big party, and all our friends came to welcome me back.”\n\nAs I took out my tape recorder, Gene Woolf made his entrance, with a glass of scotch in his hand. In his 60s, he was very tall, with a full head of dark hair. Robert informed me that when he met Gene, in 1963, the younger man was the top hairdresser at Elizabeth Arden in Beverly Hills, where his clients included a number of the wives of Ronald Reagan’s “Kitchen Cabinet.” Robert said that their younger brother, William, was at a meditation retreat in the mountains.\n\n“Did you tell him Tab Hunter was here yesterday, Robert?” asked Gene. Both men were raised in Texas, Robert in Temple and Gene in Harleton.\n\n“Tab is an old friend,” said Robert. “He’s writing his memoir [it was published by Algonquin Books in 2005], and he stopped by to see if we could help him remember any good stories from the old days.”\n\n“He told us that he is telling all, because he doesn’t have anything to hide,” said Gene. “No one cares anymore!”\n\n“I suppose that’s right,” Robert said, and I sensed that he was in much the same state of mind.\n\n“Come here,” he said, struggling to get up, “and look at the picture of Papa.” He led me over to a painting in a nearby hallway. In the portrait, from the early 60s, John, with soft blue eyes, is wearing an ascot and a dark suit.\n\n“And now come look at me.” We made our way to Robert’s bedroom, with butter-yellow walls and an enormous baldachin bed, covered with a fur throw. Facing the door was a full-length portrait of Robert at about 30, looking like a proto–Ralph Lauren model, with a standard poodle seated next to him. Robert Koch, as he was called then, was blond and very good-looking.\n\n“I have been double-gated in my life,” Robert told me. He gestured with his wrist to indicate a gate that swings both ways. “I suppose that had a lot to do with everything. I got married right before the Second World War, in which I served as a tail gunner on a B-17. But marriage wasn’t for me. After the war, when I was serving out my tour on a base near Palm Springs, I used to take the bus to L.A. on weekends. It would drop me off right on the Sunset Strip outside La Rue, a fine restaurant at the time.\n\n“One night, I had just got off the bus, and I was looking in the window of the Allan Adler store, at the silver, and a man came by and picked me up. He was an old-time Hollywood decorator named Virgil Johnson, and he brought me right into La Rue, where I was seated between [the actress] Faye Emerson and [her husband] Elliot Roosevelt, the president’s son. When you are young and good-looking, especially in war days, wearing a military uniform, there is no place you can’t get into. That was my introduction to Los Angeles.” He paused and added, “Now, what can I tell you about Papa? He was the kindest, sweetest man I ever met. And he was a genius. I learned everything I know about design from Jack Woolf, and I don’t want him to be forgotten.”\n\nRobert Koch met John Woolf in 1948, when Robert was 25 and Jack was 40. By then the younger man had settled in Los Angeles. “I worked in a decorator shop called Design for Living, on Melrose Place, owned by Robert De Beauville,” said Robert.\n\nDesign for Living was located across the street from the office of John Woolf, which was housed in the Woolf-designed building at 8448 Melrose Place. “It was very much in Papa’s style, with a tall lacquered double front door—he called it the Pullman door, because it shot through the roofline, like doors at the ends of a Pullman car.\n\n“I just noticed Jack right off,” he continued. “I already knew his work. Everyone knew the Pendleton house. Before I ever met him, I had done a house up in his style, on Queens Road. I did the layout of the architecture, which looked like Jack Woolf did it, and soon I made sure I met him, which actually was through the boyfriend I had at the time. My boyfriend had just built a new house out in Van Nuys and wanted me to live there. So I did.” One night he got invited to John Woolf’s for dinner. “I drove him, but I wasn’t invited. When I went to pick him up, about 10:30 or so, I made sure I was asked to have a drink. That is how I met John Woolf, and things started changing.”\n\nAt that point John Woolf had lived in Los Angeles for almost 11 years. He had built or remodeled houses for Fanny Brice, George Cukor, Ira Gershwin, David O. Selznick, Loretta Young, Clifton Webb, Lillian Gish, Mervyn LeRoy, producer Charles Feldman, and Elsie de Wolfe, the inventor of modern interior decoration. But, for all of his high-end clients, he was bad at business, and his financial situation was a disaster. “Jack Woolf had talent, but he didn’t have any money, and he didn’t care about money or know how to make it,” said Robert.\n\nWoolf had come to L.A. from Atlanta in 1937. “That’s when they were making Gone with the Wind, and he thought that he could get a part in it, being southern,” said Robert. “It was the Depression, and he had studied architecture at Georgia Tech and was working for the Georgia forest department. Both his parents were schoolteachers. He didn’t get the part in Gone with the Wind, but I guess that’s when he met George Cukor, the director, who hadn’t been fired off the film yet.”\n\nThe introduction to Cukor, then one of the top directors in Hollywood and a leader of the powerful homosexual social set in town, brought many important breaks for Woolf. He attended Cukor’s lavish parties, which were on Wednesday and Sunday. Wednesdays featured a mix of very influential men and women. Sundays were for men only. Eventually John and Robert began showing up at Cukor’s together, and soon Robert was also folded into Cukor’s circle, which included Somerset Maugham, Katharine Hepburn, Greta Garbo, and Mae West.\n\nCommissions from Cukor’s friends launched John Woolf and helped shape his aesthetic. For the comedienne Fanny Brice, he built a red-brick guesthouse as a companion piece to her Georgian Holmby Hills mansion, designed by Paul R. Williams. For Elsie de Wolfe, who had helped revitalize the French town of Versailles before World War I, and who was a major proponent of the French Regency revival, he designed a mirrored pool pavilion for After All, her Beverly Hills home. Woolf clearly learned a few tricks from de Wolfe, who had invented the idea of mirrored garden follies for her Villa Trianon, in Versailles. In the 40s and early 50s, Cukor hired Woolf for a series of projects, including an outdoor kitchen. Ten years later, John and Robert together did some renovations on Cukor’s house, which had been designed by James Dolena, another prominent architect of the time, and furnished by the famous decorator Billy Haines.\n\n“First, George had Papa re-do a nice room for his mama downstairs. We didn’t fool around with the upstairs, which was pure Billy Haines, including an oval dining room with suede walls. Later we built three small houses [on Cukor’s property], one of which was for Katharine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy. Tracy was very nice, very likable. But Papa didn’t like her. The only person I knew that Jack Woolf didn’t like was Katharine Hepburn. They had a big fight over a fireplace. She wanted one, and he didn’t want to put one in. She insulted him by saying, ‘Mr. Woolf, I think your mother must have been a fireplace!’”\n\nWoolf’s office was already well established in 1948, when, just weeks after they had met, Robert and John moved into a small apartment upstairs. “We shared a three-quarter campaign bed because that is all we could afford,” recalled Robert. “He had just finished the office on Melrose Place with a loan from a wonderful old maiden lady named Elsa Schroeder, who was George Cukor’s business manager. She lent Jack the money to build it, and he put in an apartment on the second floor on each side—very Woolf, with an oval window in a little bedroom, a proper entrance hall, and big living rooms looking onto a walled garden in the back. They were charming and very high-ceilinged, with fireplaces.”\n\nKurt White, who was an apprentice in the Woolf office and a close friend of John’s, recalls Robert Koch’s sudden arrival and the changes that took place soon after. “Bob did a hell of a lot for Jack,” he says. “I hate to say ‘marriage made in heaven,’ but it was one of those things where Jack was not the strongest person in the world. In character, he was a charming, wonderful guy. But if he was led the wrong way, he would follow. Thank God Bob led him the right way. When I first met Bob, I thought, Oh, God—poor Jack. But Bob got him off drinking too much; he got him into the right kind of cars. When I first met Jack, he had a 1941 Ford convertible, and it was one of those convertibles that had a plastic dashboard, and the plastic had gone to heaven. In the old days, we’d go to the grocery store and cash checks for $10—that was all Jack had in his account. You’d buy a bottle of gin and some lettuce, and that was about it.”\n\nAfter Bob, “it was a whole different routine,” says White. “He got him out of his ramshackle Ford and into a Jaguar sedan, and moved him into the building on Melrose Place. There were dinner parties, and there you would find Loretta Young and Agnes Moorehead and Joan Fontaine. I mean, I am still slightly staggered by it, because you just don’t meet those people in your normal existence.”\n\nThe money began to flow in, not just from clients but from side ventures engineered by Robert. “Bob was really very astute,” White recalls. “For example, he found that George Cukor had nobody to wrap his Christmas presents for him, and he had to give presents to a zillion people. Guess who wrapped the packages for a price? Bob was a sharp cookie. He wasn’t just sitting around looking pretty.”\n\n‘We worked at it,” said Robert. “We entertained the Frawleys, who owned Technicolor and Schick Eversharp; Puddin’ and Dr. Henry Dodge, who were Maxwell House coffee; Adolph and Kay Spreckels, Spreckels Sugar; the Pendletons. Here we are, doing beautiful houses for people, so I wanted a beautiful house, too. I helped make him a very successful man.”\n\nOnce Robert was running the show, according to Kurt White, the Woolf office began to turn a profit. “‘You tell them it’s got to be 35 percent, and that’s it. Don’t start saying, “Oh, I could do it for 18.”’ That’s how Robert was with Jack,” according to White. Eventually, they worked it so that Jack wowed the wives with his drawings while Robert would be in the next room telling the husband the amount he should write on the check.\n\nBob, says White, was also able to seduce the wives. “I thought Kay Gable was going to try to eat him alive. She was married to Adolph Spreckels at the time.” With Puddin’ Dodge, it went further. “She and I were going to be married,” Robert told me. “What did John Woolf think of that?,” I asked him. “Well, we spent all our time with Puddin’ anyway, traveled the world with her in her private plane. So we were like a little family—Papa, Gene, Puddin’, and I. I never loved anyone more than Papa. He knew that, so why did it matter?”\n\n“Why didn’t you marry Puddin’?,” I asked.\n\n“It was all planned. I got her an emerald ring. But gay people shouldn’t get married like that. I guess that’s why.”\n\nIn the years following World War II, the Woolfs were the right men in the right place. The Depression had lessened the demand for large houses with servants’ quarters and ostentatious façades, but the wealthy were still migrating to Los Angeles and building second homes there. At the same time, the modern movement was taking hold in the city. Richard Neutra, John Lautner, and A. Quincy Jones were building untraditional homes for the carriage trade. Woolf, however, did not change his course or style.\n\n“The new money who came out here wanted formal homes, but on a smaller scale,” says Jeff Hyland, a top real-estate agent in Beverly Hills. “The Pendleton house became a sort of show house for the Woolf office. As soon as you saw it, you’d say to your wife, ‘I want one of these.’”\n\n“In our day you could not get rid of big houses,” Robert told me. “We did houses for people whose families had gone. They wanted one bedroom and a guest room. They were pavilions. We even took the second story off some big old houses.”\n\nWhile modernism in L.A. has gotten a good deal of deserved attention in recent years—Richard Neutra’s, Rudolph Schindler’s, and Frank Lloyd Wright’s houses are considered prizes—innovators in the traditional styles have been somewhat neglected. The master of this innovation of the traditional, in the opinion of many, was Woolf. With his neoclassical style and perfect sense of scale, he most successfully catered to Hollywood’s upper caste and most effectively captured the elegance of a golden era. According to David Gebhard, the late dean of California architectural historians, the film world of Hollywood and the physical world of Hollywood were merged by Woolf in a way that they never had been before.\n\nThere also arose a school of Woolf copycats. “If you go to West Hollywood, just east of Doheny Drive and near Santa Monica Boulevard, you’re going to find all these knockoffs,” says Jeff Hyland. “Contractors copied his style, his signature look, the mansard roof, the leaded oval window, and semi-circular portico. But some of the small Woolf houses that you think are fakes are actually Woolf, because he and Bob were very smart. They could take a Spanish house of no distinction and, for fairly little money, put a mansard on it and give it the Woolf look.” In L.A. real-estate lingo, such a project became known as “a regal re-do.”\n\nThe most famous of these was a house the Woolfs remodeled for themselves. Case Study House No. 17, built in 1955 by Craig Ellwood, was one of the largest of the houses commissioned as a showcase for modern design by Arts and Architecture magazine. Among the Case Study Houses are the Eames House and Case Study No. 21, by Pierre Koenig, two of the most famous modern houses in the world. The Case Study program is among the key moments in the promotion of 20th-century modern architecture. John and Robert’s re-structuring of Case Study No. 17 became a symbolic incident in the annals of development culture in L.A. “When we bought it, it looked like a school—worse, a prison,” said Robert. “It was terrible, so we re-did it as a Roman pavilion and made it beautiful.”\n\n“The purists were so mad: How dare he!” notes Mark Bennett, an L.A. artist, who curated the U.C. Santa Barbara exhibition on Woolf. “Well, yeah. But in ’68 nobody wanted these houses. It was the biggest Case Study House ever built. Big garden. They slapped on a double-height entry with a kind of *faux-*tent top. Inside there’s flocked wallpaper and huge curtains with pom-poms. And it’s like every kind of design pattern going. Big, fake blue flowers everywhere. The modernists said, ‘Sacrilege!’ The Beverly Hills crowd said, ‘Thank God!’”\n\nWhen Robert Woolf died, Gene phoned to let me know. He was sobbing. Robert had confided to me that Gene and William had not gotten along consistently over the years, “but as soon as I got sick they came together real close,” he said. It was unclear if that was Robert’s wishful thinking. From what I saw, the two younger brothers had rallied in Robert’s time of need, but the household had long centered on Robert, and he was now gone.\n\nThe day the Times obituary ran, I got an angry call from Gene. “I was disappointed in that article. It just got too personal for me,” he said. The Times reporter had written, “The Woolfs’ own unorthodox living arrangements, known to friends as the ‘Woolf pack,’ grew out of efforts in the 1970’s to give legal standing to gay relationships. John and Robert had grown apart romantically but continued to live together. In the early 1960’s, Robert met Gene Oney, who moved in with both men. In 1971, after John Woolf learned he had Parkinson’s disease, he adopted both Robert and Gene, who changed their names to Woolf. Later in the decade, Gene and Robert also grew apart, and Robert brought home a new man, William Capp. After John Woolf died in 1980, Robert, Gene and William moved to a large estate designed by Addison Mizner in Montecito, which Robert devoted himself to restoring in his later years.”\n\n“It sounded like Robert just picked up William on the street. That is not what happened at all,” said Gene.\n\nWilliam, a former navy sailor, recalled for me exactly how he had met Robert and John: “I was working at a gym and Robert had been scoping me for weeks before he introduced himself. Robert asked, ‘Do you know anyone who needs a job?’ I said no. ‘Have you ever wanted to be a decorator?’ I said no. ‘Can you type?’ I said no. He said, ‘O.K., you’ll do.’ And he hired me.”\n\nWhat led to the Woolfs’ coming together as an unorthodox family was a complicated playing out of relationships over the years. Robert, in our conversations, had made the true nature of his love affair with the man he called Papa ambiguous. “I loved Jack Woolf. I never loved anyone more in my life,” he told me on several occasions. “And that’s why Papa adopted Gene and me,” he added. “When I met Gene, in 1963, and he moved in, Papa, being much older, loved Gene like he was a son. So he adopted us, and we both became his sons. And then I met William, and he thought of William as his son as well. We lived as brothers, and Papa was our father. That’s just the way it was.” Robert often spoke to me of William as a kind of reincarnation of John Woolf. “They are the same person. The same character exactly,” he’d say.\n\nOn the eve of Robert’s funeral at Forest Lawn I tracked down the other love of Robert’s life, Puddin’ Dodge DeWitz, who was living in Palm Beach. She was clearly distraught at the news of the death of her old friend. “When I met [Robert], he looked like he should have been Alexander the Great. And he had great taste. He had taste of his own before he met Jack. He was an achiever. He wasn’t any dead piece of nothing hanging on to Jack. They were partners. And not in the sense of sex. I’m not talking about that. They had great admiration for each other, and they really worked well together.” Puddin’ seemed to imply that her lover and his lover had not in fact been lovers at all.\n\n“Bob and Jack were very, very together [when I lived with them]” in a two-bedroom apartment, said Kurt White when I told him what Puddin’ had had to say. “I had my own room, and they had theirs. So there was no business about them just being amicable friends.”\n\n“Was it a love affair?,” I asked him.\n\n“Oh, yes.”\n\nThree years after Robert’s death, Gene and William sold the family house, and they have become estranged. “It’s lonely these days,” Gene tells me when I reach him on the phone at what he describes as a “small cottage on the edge of Montecito.” Death taxes took a huge toll on the Woolf fortune. “Millions and millions,” says Gene, who, like William, was heir to the John and Robert Woolf estate. “We sold almost everything off, and William and I had bloody fights over all of Papa and Robert’s furniture. Now he’s gone off and got a face-lift, and he’s riding his motorcycles, like Robert never existed.” Virtually all that remains are the portraits of John and Robert, which Gene keeps in a corner of his cottage.\n\n“I knew it was going to happen,” says Gene. “Robert wanted us to be a family. He really didn’t want us to be alone. But it wasn’t meant to be. Even the dogs split up. I kept Honey, and he kept Sweetie. The whole thing has been a nightmare. As soon as Robert went, the civilizing went, too. It’s a sad ending. No, it’s a tragedy. But I guess nothing lasts forever.”\n\nWilliam, who now lives in San Francisco, has a last word: “Everything has changed. I don’t have a Big Daddy to go to anymore. Robert was very giving. Once, years ago, he was in the bedroom paying bills, and he said, ‘William, do you know how much you spend?’ And I said no. And he never told me how much I spent, and I never asked. Gene and I were competitive for Robert’s affection. In the end, there was enough to go around, but there were little things. I remember one Christmas, Robert got Gene a red-fox coat that was really spectacular. I got a raccoon coat, and I said, ‘You give him a fox and I get a coon?’ But those were just little things. As I said, things have changed, because taxes ate up the money. I still have a handsome income, because of the trust, but I will never live the way we did again unless I win the lottery.”\n\nMatt Tyrnauer is a Vanity Fair special correspondent."
