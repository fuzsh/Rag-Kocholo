        "text": "CONCERT SPONSOR\n\nGUEST ARTIST SPONSOR\n\nAbout Richard Glazier\n\nEvery artist has an epiphany. For classically-trained, award-winning pianist Richard Glazier, it happened at age nine, when he saw the film “Girl Crazy” with a score by George & Ira Gershwin. He was so excited by the music he heard, he was prompted to write a fan letter to famed lyricist Ira Gershwin. After corresponding with each other for three years, Gershwin invited his young friend, then 12, to meet him in Beverly Hills. During their visit, Ira asked Glazier to play a Gershwin tune on the piano that once belonged to his brother, legendary composer George Gershwin. Fueled by Ira’s encouragement and interest, Glazier dedicated himself to the Gershwin repertoire and the American Popular Songbook, eventually becoming one of the genre’s leading authorities. Over the years he has also developed a keen interest in contemporary music standards from the Broadway stage and the Hollywood screen.\n\nBorn in Indianapolis, Indiana, Glazier began studying piano when he was six years old. Glazier earned his Bachelor and Master degrees in Piano Performance from Indiana University School of Music and a Doctorate of Musical Arts from the Cleveland Institute of Music. In 2007, CIM awarded him its prestigious Alumni Achievement Award for his contributions to American Popular Song.\n\nAbout Jonita Lattimore\n\nJonita Lattimore made her Lyric Opera of Chicago debut in Kurt Weill’s The Rise and Fall of the City of Mahagonny, and was also seen on Lyric’s stage as Micaela in Bizet’s Carmen. She recently performed the role of Countess Almaviva in Le Nozze di Figaro with Tulsa Opera, and debuted in the title role in the world premiere and recording of James Niblock’s Ruth at Blue Lake Fine Arts Festival. With Houston Grand Opera she appeared as Marguerite in Faust and presented the world premieres of Harvey Milk, The Book of the Tibetan Dead, and Jackie O, which was recorded on Decca. She made her Paris debut at the Bastille Opera as Serena in Porgy and Bess. She is an adjunct professor on the faculties of the Chicago College of Performing Arts of Roosevelt University and Columbia College.\n\nAbout Dwayne Clark\n\nDwayne Clark is a celebrated actor, singer, educator, performance coach and motivational speaker.
