        "text": "Ira \"painstakingly and brilliantly crafted the lyric to \"The Man That Got Away,\" the song many consider Ira's \"'last great standard,' coming thirty years after the first, 'The Man I Love'.\" Feinstein goes on to write that he does not believe that the lyric to this song, as others have suggested, was inspired by Ira's \"well of personal of suffering,\" especially with regard to his brother's death some seventeen years earlier. Feinstein says,\n\nI asked Ira if he'd suffered writing that song and he said, \"I was doing my job.\" I pressed a little: \"But it's so deeply emotional and so connected to very dark feelings.\" He said, \"Then I did my job well\" (p. 102).\n\nWilfred Sheed agrees with Feinstein that in the lyric for \"The Man That Got Away\" in lines like \"The road gets tougher. / It's lonelier and rougher,\" Ira \"was not really writing about himself, but coming from the author of \"Do, Do, Do\" and 'S Wonderful,\" the voice is unrecognizable and would not be heard again in a musical score [of his] (Wilfred Sheed, The House That George Built: With a Little Help from Irving, Cole, and a Crew of About Fifty ,\n\nNew York: Random House, 2007, p. 72).\n\nAlso Feinstein notes that when George died, Ira's life changed so much not only because it was his brother who died so prematurely but because his brother was also his \"work partner.\" Feinstein goes on: \"Of all the legendary people whom Ira worked with after George's death--Kurt Weill, Jerome Kern, Aaron Copeland, and Harold Arlen, among others--Geroge was the only one he considered a true genius\" (p. 103).\n\nCredits for Videomakers of videos used on this page:\n\nVideo documentary on George and Ira: jazzgirl1920s\n\n\"That Moment of Moments\" and \"Harlem Serenade\": petermintunmusic\n\nBorrowed material (text): The sources of all quoted and paraphrased text are cited.
