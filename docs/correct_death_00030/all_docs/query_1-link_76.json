        "text": "This George Gershwin song sketch dated 2/1/23 and only described as “Brightly” seemed to call out for an Ira Gershwin lyric.\n\nFortunately, the book The Complete Lyrics of Ira Gershwin contains at least 75 Ira song lyrics with unfortunately lost or missing music. Admittedly, I am taking liberties with the Gershwins’ work, but I do it with what I believe is the proper trepidation and best of intentions. As Ira once said:\n\n“A song without music is a lot like H2 without the O.”\n\nSo I sometimes attempt to add an Ira lyric to a George song sketch, but only if it helps give a sense of what an Ira lyric could have added to the tune. It is an approximation only. In this case I had about six Ira songs that I thought could fit the tone and meter of the melody, and I chose “Let It Rain! Let It Pour!” which Ira wrote around 1939 with music by Harold Arlen (“It’s Only A Paper Moon,” “Stormy Weather”).\n\n“Let It Rain! Let It Pour!” only exists as a recording of Arlen singing it at the piano. (If anybody knows where this recording can be found, I’d love to hear it!) Ira had written lyrics for Arlen from as far back as 1934. Here’s the recap of shows by Harold Arlen and Ira Gershwin (a complete list of their songs is below):\n\nLife Begins at 8:40 (1934)\n\nThe Country Girl (1954)\n\nA Star Is Born (1954)\n\nSo it would appear that Harold and Ira only wrote three songs that were not part of the shows listed above. So what was the occasion for this rare collaboration?\n\nAfter George Gershwin died in 1937, Ira’s lyric output slowed to some degree. He wrote a handful of songs with composers Vernon Duke, Johnny Green, Jerome Kern, and Harold Arlen during 1938 and ’39, none of which are well-known today.\n\nIn 1939, Harold Arlen had just written the music to The Wizard of Oz with lyrics by Ira’s middle school pal, Yip Harburg. Many of the creators of the great American songbook who were living in Hollywood at that time would visit Ira (and George while he was alive) at 1019 N. Roxbury Dr, in Beverly Hills (and later Ira at 1021 Roxbury), playing their latest creation, getting feedback, and generally feeling the pressure to up their game in the competitive world of songwriting.\n\nMaybe the 1939 songs that Arlen and Gershwin wrote were just a case of a couple of friends having fun and weren’t meant as great masterworks. Ira’s lyric to one of those collaborations, “I’ll Supply the Title (You’ll Supply the Tune),” suggests a playfulness between composer and lyricist and less of a concern about writing a lyric for the ages:\n\n“I’ll supply the title. You’ll supply the tune.\n\nBut it’s oh so vital that we get together soon.\n\nLook at time advancing. Why should music wait?\n\nWhat a song we two can sing if we collaborate.”\n\nIt’s an interesting peek into the mind of a man who was still mourning the loss of his beloved brother/collaborator and was deciding it was time to get back into writing with the other world-class composers who were in and out of his house each week.\n\nDownload the PDF of the simplified sheet music to “Brightly” here: Brightly\n\nNote about the sheet music: I doubled the time of each note, so 16th notes are now 8th notes for ease of play. I added an intro based on the end of the song and then a bit of a vamp based on Gershwin’s opening chords. It is my understanding that there is no page two to this music, so I added a repeat. And lastly, it was transposed into C, again for ease of play. (See the original manuscript below.)\n\nIra Gershwin’s lyrics to “Let it Rain! Let It Pour!”\n\nLet it rain! Let it Pour!\n\nWith a song in my heart,\n\nWho cares if there’s rain at my door?\n\nWith your smile lighting my way,\n\nHow can anything ever darken up my day?\n\nAll is fair here in your eyes,\n\nAnd I don’t care\n\nWhat happens up there\n\nIn the skies.\n\nLet it rain! Let it pour!\n\nOh, I’m out of the shadows now\n\nForevermore.\n\nNo more dreading cold December–\n\nNow December is July.\n\nThings are growing.\n\nBuds are blooming.\n\nBecause why?\n\nFound the one I adore,\n\nLet it rain! Let it Pour!\n\nSongs co-written by Harold Arlen and Ira Gershwin from haroldarlen.com:"
