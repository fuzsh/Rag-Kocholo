        "text": "Today in Music History for July 11:\n\nIn 1889, \"Leo the Royal Cadet,\" described as a military opera, premiered at Martin's Opera House in Kingston, Ont. The performance took place under the patronage of the nearby Royal Military College.\n\nIn 1937, George Gershwin, one of the world's greatest composers of popular music, died in Beverly Hills, Calif., of a brain tumour. He was only 38. Gershwin wrote his first hit, \"Swanee,\" in 1918 for the Broadway show, \"Sinbad,\" starring Al Jolson. Gershwin's other hits included \"The Man I Love,\" \"S'Wonderful,\" \"Summertime\" and \"Love is Here to Stay.\" The lyrics for many of his songs were provided by his brother Ira. George Gershwin wrote the scores for such Broadway shows as \"Funny Face,\" \"Porgy and Bess\" and \"Of Thee I Sing,\" which in 1932 became the first musical to win a Pulitzer Prize. Gershwin played the piano at the premiere of his widely acclaimed \"Rhapsody in Blue\" in 1924, accompanied by the Paul Whiteman Orchestra. \"Rhapsody in Blue\" was also the title of a 1945 movie biography, starring Robert Alda as Gershwin.\n\nIn 1947, Jeff Hanna, guitarist with \"The Nitty Gritty Dirt Band,\" was born in Detroit. Formed in California in 1966, the country-rock group's commercial breakthrough didn't come until 1970 with the album \"Uncle Charlie and his Dog Teddy.\" From the LP came a top-10 single, a cover version of Jerry Jeff Walker's \"Mr. Bojangles.\" In 1971, \"The Nitty Gritty Dirt Band\" recorded a critically-acclaimed three-LP set of traditional country tunes, \"Will the Circle Be Unbroken,\" with such country music elders as Roy Acuff, Mother Maybelle Carter and Doc Watson. A second \"Circle\" volume was issued in 1989. Most of the \"Dirt Band's\" other recent records have also been in a country vein.\n\nIn 1949, Canadian Liona Boyd, one of the world's leading classical guitarists, was born in London, England. Boyd has performed around the world, both as a soloist and with symphony orchestras. She has also recorded with the likes of Gordon Lightfoot, Eric Clapton and Chet Atkins. Her 1976 North American tour with Lightfoot helped introduce classical guitar to a wider audience. Boyd has won several Juno Awards and is a member of the Order of Canada.\n\nIn 1957, Alan McCartney of the Montreal techno-rock trio \"Men Without Hats\" was born.\n\nIn 1959, singer Joan Baez performed a duet with Bob Gibson at the Newport Folk Festival.

The digital recording process had been used for some time for classical LP's, but this was the first time it had been employed for rock.\n\nIn 1981, Hubert Johnson, a member of the Motown group \"The Contours,\" committed suicide in Detroit. Johnson was a cousin of Jackie Wilson, who introduced \"The Contours\" to Motown head Berry Gordy Jr. \"The Contours\" took their feverish dance tune \"Do You Love Me?\" to No. 3 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1962.\n\nIn 1987, an unusual collaboration between British rock star Sting and U.S. jazzman Gil Evans opened the Umbria Jazz Festival in Perugia, Italy. Evans's orchestra backed Sting during the performance, which included such \"Police\" tunes as \"Shadows in the Rain\" and \"Roxanne.\"\n\nIn 1993, Irish singer Sinead O'Connor pulled out of her planned stage debut in Dublin at the last moment, complaining of emotional exhaustion. She was to have opened four days later in \"Hamlet's Nightmare,\" playing the part of \"Death.\"\n\nIn 1993, Mario Bauza, a pioneer in Afro-Cuban jazz, died in New York of cancer at age 82. Bauza helped launch the career of Ella Fitzgerald with \"The Chick Webb Orchestra\" in the 1930s. But his major contribution to jazz was combining Cuban rhythms with jazz-oriented brass, a style that heavily influenced Dizzy Gillespie.\n\nIn 1995, \"R.E.M.\" bassist Mike Mills underwent abdominal surgery in Germany. The band was forced to cancel several shows for the second time in a year. The earlier cancellations came after drummer Bill Berry suffered a brain aneurysm.\n\nIn 1996, Lou Gottlieb, the frontman for the 1960s folk group \"The Limeliters,\" died in Sebastopol, Calif., of cancer at age 72. Gottlieb also played bass with the trio, whose other members were Glenn Yarbrough and Alex Hassilev. \"The Limeliters\" had 10 albums on the Billboard chart between 1961-64. The most popular was \"Tonight: In Person,\" which reached No. 5 in 1961. Gottlieb retired from music in 1966, but revived \"The Limeliters\" seven years later and the group performed until shortly before his death.\n\nIn 2008, \"Barenaked Ladies\" frontman Steven Page was charged with possession of cocaine and marijuana. He avoided jail time in an October trial by agreeing to follow court stipulated orders for the next six months. The charges were formally dismissed in May 2009.\n\nIn 2009, Paul McCartney played his lone Canadian concert of the year for an estimated 50,000 people who gathered on the Halifax Common.\n\nIn 2010, pop star Shakira headlined a closing ceremony in Johannesburg for the 2010 World Cup.\n\nIn 2010, a free Jimmy Buffett concert, with proceeds going to help the Gulf Coast through the oil spill crisis, drew tens of thousands of people to Gulf Shores, Ala.

He sang on such hits as \"Midnight Confessions,\" ''Temptation Eyes,\" and \"Let's Live for Today.\"\n\nIn 2011, singer-songwriter Jewel gave birth to her first child, a boy, Kase Townes Murray.\n\nIn 2014, Tommy Ramone, drummer of the seminal punk band The Ramones and the last surviving member of the original group, died at age 65. He co-founded the group in 1974 in New York along with singer Joey Ramone, bassist DeeDee Ramone and guitarist Johnny Ramone. All four band members had different surnames, but took the common name Ramone. The band influenced a generation of rockers, and their hit songs \"I Wanna be Sedated\" and \"Blitzkrieg Bop,\" among others, earned them an induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2002.\n\n-----\n\nThe Canadian Press"
