        "text": "Ira Gershwin (born Dec. 6, 1896, Manhattan, New York, N.Y., U.S.—died Aug. 17, 1983, Beverly Hills, Calif.) was an American lyricist who collaborated with his younger brother, George Gershwin, on more than 20 Broadway musicals and motion pictures until George’s death (1937) and who later collaborated on films and plays with others—Moss Hart, Kurt Weill, Jerome Kern, Harry Warren, and Harold Arlen—and contributed to Gershwin revivals.\n\nGershwin was born on New York’s Lower East Side of Russian-Jewish immigrant parents. He early showed literary talent and attended City College of New York for two years (1914–16). Thereafter, he did odd jobs until his brother, already becoming known as a composer and musician, asked him to write lyrics; their first song of collaboration was “The Real American Folk Song,” which appeared in Ladies First (1918). During the early years, Ira Gershwin used a pseudonym, Arthur Francis, in order not to capitalize on his brother’s reputation."
