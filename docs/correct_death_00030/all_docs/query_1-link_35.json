        "text": "Ira Gershwin has long lived in the shadow of his younger brother George Gershwin, undoubtedly one of the greatest of all American composers.\n\nGeorge wrote the music, and though he died young, his reputation has soared. Ira wrote lyrics, and though he outlived George by more than 40 years, he is still in that shadow, and probably would be happy with that.\n\nBut for many, Ira is the better brother. He wrote a dozen musicals with George, but also musicals and lyrics with Yip Harburg and Kurt Weill, songs for memorable films (including Judy Garland’s “A Star Is Born”) and he lived long enough to pass his legacy on as one of the leading creators of what is now called “The American Songbook.”\n\nCome to the Colony Theatre in Burbank for “Words by Ira Gershwin,” which opened Saturday, and decide for yourself.\n\nYou’ll meet Ira Gershwin himself, so convincingly played by Jake Broder with such simplicity and modesty that you’ll completely forget Broder is there. This musical play by Joseph Vass is an evening at Gershwin’s Beverly Hills home, and you are hearing him reminisce about his life. Sure, there is a four-piece combo on stage, and two very delicious and delightful singers as well (Elijah Rock and Angela Teek), but that doesn’t diminish the feeling that you are privileged to hear from the master himself in an old-fashioned tweed suit, sitting in an armchair and, a little reluctantly at first, joining in with the singing. (Broder also has played Louis Prima with distinction; he is a real chameleon.)\n\nThere are 26 songs on the extensive program, most by George, of course, but also selections by Vernon Duke, Harold Arlen and Weill, and plenty of informative talks about how both Gershwins lives began, how they became stars (though most is about George, Ira’s beloved brother) and how using the American language, the language of slang and vitality, informed Ira’s lyrics. Ira’s rhyming is always a delight: In one song he rhymes “panties” with “aunties” and “Dante’s”; in “It Ain’t Necessarily So” from the opera “Porgy and Bess,” one notable line goes: “He made his home in/ That fish’s abdomen.” That’s genius, even if Ira wanted to be in the background.\n\nThis is a show about music, and music director Kevin Toney, who leads from the piano, has a great jazz combo to make the music swing: guitarist Terry Wollman (who also doubles as the fourth man in “Quartet Erotica” from “Life Begins at 8:30” by Arlen), the big double-bass sound of John B. Williams and Gene Krupa-like drummer Greg Webster. (Linger as the crowd leaves at show’s end to hear them jam.)\n\nTeek is wonderful as the Chanteuse, singing in a variety of styles, from Judy Garland at her torchiest to sexy numbers to just plain fun, like “Let’s Call the Whole Thing Off” (which Ira says was based on his marriage). Rock is the Crooner, and he sings deliciously and dances even better: He is given a chance to tap against drummer Webster and he scampers around the stage, steps and everywhere else.\n\nGeorge Gershwin was always the star, playing the piano at any party for hours at a time. Ira was the shy brother, and Broder conveys that shyness in his performance: He is just a nice man who happens to have interesting friends he works with. You’ll want to get to know him, and once you see this show, you’ll never forget how important the words are to these great songs, and how great Ira’s talent was for the perfect phrase, for the perfect emotion.\n\nJohn Farrell is a Los Angeles-based freelance writer."
