        "text": "From 1924 to 1937, there was no Broadway songwriting team as potent as George and Ira Gershwin. Growing up on the streets of New York at the dawn of the 20th century, the Gershwins were among the first to infuse popular song with an undeniably American flavor. Gershwin tunes strutted, swaggered, and sparkled with emotions ranging from desperate loneliness to unbridled enthusiasm. In this lecture, we will trace this remarkable partnership on Broadway, which ended tragically with George Gershwin's death from a brain tumor in 1937. Shows discussed will include Lady, Be Good!, Girl Crazy, Strike Up the Band, Of Thee I Sing, Porgy and Bess, and more, featuring rare vintage recordings as well as modern interpretations.\n\nCary Ginell is a Grammy-nominated writer and author of 12 books on American music.
