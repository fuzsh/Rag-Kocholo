        "text": "Footnotes\n\n'THE LEFT HAND PLAYS THE MELODY UPSIDE DOWN, WHILE THE RIGHT PLAYS IT STRAIGHT, ON THE THEORY THAT YOU SHOULDN'T LET ONE HAND KNOW WHAT THE OTHER IS DOING' (George Gershwin, Music by Gershwin radio broadcast, 19 February 1934).\n\nThis publicity photograph of legendary composer George Gershwin was taken for his little-known 1934 radio programme, Music by Gershwin which, according to Sarah Sisk, was '...crucial to the existence of one of Gershwin's greatest works, Porgy and Bess... It highlights an important aspect of Gershwin's popularity in his own lifetime – his penchant for being at the forefront of music technology... public broadcast radio...'. Conceived as a way to raise funds for Porgy and Bess, his first full-length opera, the programme aired for the first time on the NBC Blue Network on 19 February 1934, running twice a week until the following May and revived again in September to December. It was sponsored by Feen-a-mint, a chewing gum laxative, and Gershwin selected and introduced the numbers for each programme, his informal dialogue peppered with jokes and anecdotes. The New York Times wrote after his death in July 1937: '...his genius freshened the life blood of radio... his growth and triumphs paralleled the magic advances of broadcasting which in a flash introduced his popular melodies to the entire nation...' (Sarah Sisk, 'Music by Gershwin' University of Michigan School of Music, Theatre & Dance online blog, 2017). The photograph, book and accompanying letters were sent to Mrs Margaret ('Peggy') Dunne, an avid fan of the Gershwins, and have remained in the family since then.\n\nProvenance: Peggy Dunne (d.1992); thence by descent to the present owner."
