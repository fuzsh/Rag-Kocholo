        "text": "Background information\n\nBirth name Israel Gershowitz\n\nAlso known as Israel Gershvin\n\nArthur Francis\n\nBorn December 6, 1896(1896-12-06)\n\nNew York City, USA\n\nDied August 17, 1983(1983-08-17) (aged 86)\n\nBeverly Hills, California, USA\n\nGenres Popular\n\nClassical\n\nOccupations Lyricist\n\nYears active 1910s-1980s\n\nIra Gershwin (December 6, 1896 – August 17, 1983) was an American lyricist who collaborated with his younger brother, composer George Gershwin, to create some of the most memorable songs of the 20th century.[1]\n\nWith George he wrote more than a dozen Broadway shows, featuring songs such as \"I Got Rhythm\", \"Embraceable You\", \"The Man I Love\" and \"Someone to Watch Over Me\", and the opera Porgy and Bess.\n\nThe success the brothers had with their collaborative works has often overshadowed the creative role that Ira played. However, his mastery of songwriting continued after the early death of George. He wrote additional hit songs with composers Jerome Kern (\"Long Ago (and Far Away)\"), Kurt Weill and Harold Arlen.\n\nHis critically acclaimed book Lyrics on Several Occasions of 1959, an amalgam of autobiography and annotated anthology, is an important source for studying the art of the lyricist in the golden age of American popular song.[2]\n\nContents\n\n* 1 Biography\n\n* 2 Awards and honors\n\n* 3 Legacy\n\n* 4 Personal life\n\n* 5 Notable songs\n\n* 6 References\n\n* 7 Sources\n\n* 8 External links\n\nBiography\n\nGershwin was born Israel Gershovitz in New York City to Morris (Moishe) and Rose Gershovitz who changed the family name to Gershvin well before their children rose to fame (it was not spelled \"Gershwin\" until later). Shy in his youth, he spent much of his time at home reading, but from grammar school through college, he played a prominent part in several school newspapers and magazines. He graduated from Townsend Harris High School in 1914, where he met Yip Harburg. He attended the City College of New York but dropped out.[3][4]\n\nWhile his younger brother began composing and \"plugging\" in Tin Pan Alley from the age of eighteen, Ira worked as a cashier in his father's Turkish baths.[5] It was not until 1921 that Ira became involved in the music business. Alex Aarons signed Ira to write the music for his next show, Two Little Girls in Blue (written under the pseudonym \"Arthur Francis\"), ultimately produced by Abraham Erlanger, with co-composers Vincent Youmans and Paul Lannin. Gershwin's lyrics were well received and allowed him to successfully enter the theatre world with just one show.[4]\n\nIt was not until 1924 that Ira and George Gershwin teamed up to write the music for their first Broadway hit Lady, Be Good!. Once the brothers joined together, their combined talents became one of the most influential forces in the history of American Musical Theatre. \"When the Gershwins teamed up to write songs for Lady, Be Good, the American musical found its native idiom\".[6] Together, they wrote the music for more than twelve shows and four films. Some of their more famous works include \"The Man I Love\", \"Fascinating Rhythm\", \"Someone to Watch Over Me\", \"I Got Rhythm\", and \"They Can't Take That Away from Me\".[2] Their partnership continued until George's sudden death from a brain tumor in 1937. Following his brother's death, Ira waited nearly three years before writing again.\n\nAfter this interlude, he teamed up with such accomplished composers as Jerome Kern (Cover Girl); Kurt Weill (Where Do We Go from Here? and Lady in the Dark); and Harold Arlen (Life Begins at 8:40; A Star Is Born).[4] Over the next fourteen years, Gershwin continued to write the lyrics for many film scores and a few Broadway shows. But the failure of Park Avenue in 1946, a \"smart\" show about divorce, co-written with composer Arthur Schwartz, was his farewell to Broadway.[7] As he wrote at the time, \"Am reading a couple of stories for possible musicalization (if there is such a word) but I hope I don't like them as I think I deserve a long rest.\"[8] In 1947, eleven songs he and George had written but never used were incorporated into the Betty Grable film The Shocking Miss Pilgrim and he later wrote comic lyrics for Billy Wilder's movie Kiss Me, Stupid.\n\nAmerican singer, pianist, musical historian Michael Feinstein worked for Gershwin in the lyricist's latter years, helping him with his archive. Several lost musical treasures were unearthed during this period, and Feinstein performed some of the material.[9]\n\nAwards and honors\n\nThree of Gershwin's songs (\"They Can't Take That Away From Me\" (1937), \"Long Ago and Far Away\" (1944) and \"The Man That Got Away\" (1954)) were nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Song, though none won.[10]\n\nGershwin, along with George S Kaufman and Morrie Ryskind, was a recipient of the 1932 Pulitzer Prize for Drama for Of Thee I Sing.[11]\n\nThe George and Ira Gershwin Lifetime Musical Achievement Award was established in 1988 by UCLA to honor the brothers for their contribution to music and for their gift to UCLA of the fight song \"Strike Up the Band for UCLA\". Past winners have included Angela Lansbury (1988), Ray Charles (1991), Mel Torme (1994), Bernadette Peters (1995), Frank Sinatra (2000), Stevie Wonder (2002), k.d. lang (2003), James Taylor (2004), Babyface (2005), Burt Bacharach (2006), Quincy Jones (2007), Lionel Richie (2008) and Julie Andrews (2009).[12]\n\nLegacy\n\nThe work of Ira and George Gershwin runs deep in the American consciousness. The opening clarinet glissando from George's Rhapsody in Blue, the taxi horn theme from his An American in Paris and the brothers' songs – \"I Got Rhythm\", \"Embraceable You\", \"The Man I Love\", \"Someone to Watch Over Me\", \"Fascinating Rhythm\", and many others – are instantly recognizable.\n\nIra Gershwin was a joyous listener to the sounds of the modern world. \"He had a sharp eye and ear for the minutae of living.\" He noted in a diary: \"Heard in a day: An elevator's purr, telephone's ring, telephone's buzz, a baby's moans, a shout of delight, a screech from a 'flat wheel', hoarse honks, a hoarse voice, a tinkle, a match scratch on sandpaper, a deep resounding boom of dynamiting in the impending subway, iron hooks on the gutter.\"[13]\n\nIn 1987, Ira's widow, Leonore Gershwin, established the Ira Gershwin Literacy Center at University Settlement, a century-old institution at 185 Eldridge Street on the Lower East Side, New York City. The Center is designed to give English-language programs to primarily Hispanic and Chinese Americans. Ira and his younger brother George spent many after-school hours at the Settlement.[14]\n\nThe George and Ira Gershwin Collection is at the Library of Congress Music Division.[15] The Edward Jablonski and Lawrence D. Stewart Gershwin Collection at the Harry Ransom Humanities Research Center at the University of Texas at Austin holds a number of Ira's manuscripts and other material.[16]\n\nIn 2007, the Library of Congress named its Prize for Popular Song after him and his brother George. Recognizing the profound and positive effect of popular music on the world's culture, the prize will be given annually to a composer or performer whose lifetime contributions exemplify the standard of excellence associated with the Gershwins. On March 1, 2007, the Library of Congress announced that Paul Simon, one of America's most respected songwriters and musicians, was the first recipient of the annual Library of Congress Gershwin Prize for Popular Song.[17] The second Gershwin Prize for Popular Song was awarded to Stevie Wonder by U.S. President Barack Obama on February 25, 2009.[18]\n\nPersonal life\n\nHe married Leonore (née Strunsky) in 1926.[19] He died in Beverly Hills, California, and is interred at Westchester Hills Cemetery, Hastings-on-Hudson, New York.\n\n[edit] Notable songs\n\n* \"But Not For Me\"\n\n* \"Embraceable You\"\n\n* \"I Can't Get Started\"\n\n* \"I Got Rhythm\"\n\n* \"The Man I Love\"\n\n* \"They Can't Take That Away From Me\"\n\n* \"Someone to Watch Over Me\"\n\n* \"'S Wonderful\"\n\n* \"The Man That Got Away\"\n\n* \"Strike Up the Band\"\n\nReferences\n\n1. ^ Obituary Variety, August 24, 1983.\n\n2. ^ a b Ira Gershwin biography pbs.org, March 17, 2009\n\n3. ^ Furia, pp.3-4, 11\n\n4. ^ a b c Ira Gershwin biography allmusic.com, accessed March 17, 2009\n\n5. ^ Furia, p. 26\n\n6. ^ Furia, p. 45\n\n7. ^ The Stage\n\n8. ^ Ira Gershwin quoted by Edward Jablonski in Gershwin: A Biography, New York: Simon & Schuster (1988) ISBN 0-671-69931-8\n\n9. ^ Feinstein biography musicianguide.com, accessed March 17, 2009\n\n10. ^ Gershwin (1959)\n\n11. ^ Brennan, Elizabeth A., \"Who's who of Pulitzer Prize winners\" (1999), Greenwood Publishing Group, ISBN 1573561118, p. 100\n\n12. ^ Gershwin Award Winners uclalumni.net, accessed May 11, 2009\n\n13. ^ Rosenberg, p.31\n\n14. ^ Staff.Widow of Ira Gershwin Endows Literacy Center\",The New York Times, March 25, 1987\n\n15. ^ The Library of Congress Gershwin Collection The Library of Congress, accessed March 17, 2009\n\n16. ^ Harry Ransom Humanities Research Center at the University of Texas at Austin\n\n17. ^ LoC: \"Paul Simon To Be Awarded First Annual Gershwin Prize for Popular Song by Library of Congress\"\n\n18. ^ LoC: \"President Obama Gives Gershwin Prize for Popular Song to Stevie Wonder Feb. 25\"\n\n19. ^ Brennan, p.100\n\nSources\n\n* Gershwin, Ira (1959).
