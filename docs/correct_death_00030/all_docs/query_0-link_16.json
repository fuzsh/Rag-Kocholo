        "text": "Gershwin’s song “Hollywood” once had lyrics by Buddy DeSylva, though they appear to be lost. What I found was the rather obvious spot in the melody where the word “Hollywood” likely appeared. After that, I find a little-known Ira Gershwin lyric with a Hollywood theme and adapt it to the melody, and voilà!: a quasi-George-and-Ira song. Or a George song with placeholder or “dummy” lyrics that approximate Ira’s general approach. But definitely stay tuned for the biggest party on wheels in Hollywood of 1937!\n\nMy lyric above is adapted from two different Ira Gershwin lyrics: The verse was adapted from “Make the Best of It” and the chorus was adapted from “I’m Tickled Silly.” Gershwin’s song “Hollywood did not seem to even make it into rehearsals as it is rarely if ever mentioned in Gershwin biographies. Why it got rejected, I don’t know, as it is a quite pleasant little tune.\n\nThe Roller Skating King Goes for One Last Spin\n\nIt was March of 1937, and 300-400 of Ginger Rogers’ (and Alfred Vanderbilt’s) closest Hollywood pals received this invitation in the mail:\n\nOne of those invitees was Ginger’s friend George Gershwin, who was living in Beverly Hills with his brother Ira, and they had written songs for the Astaire and Rogers picture called Shall We Dance which featured a roller skating dance number. As a teetotaler, Rogers sought a wholesome way to throw a party and found the perfect setting in Culver City, CA’s Rollerdrome (not Rollerdome as it was often reported).\n\nThe party was held a month after Gershwin had lost consciousness for 10-20 seconds while playing his Concerto in F with the Los Angeles Philharmonic, which Ginger and Alfred attended. How exactly he was feeling that night, I haven’t heard, and we might only have these photos of him to speculate on the matter.\n\nThe guest list was comprised of so many of her costars and associates from her 35 films (as of 1937) and featured George Gershwin, Larry Adler, Ben Alexander, Elizabeth Allen, Lucille Ball, Constance Bennett, Joan Bennett, Humphrey Bogart, Mary Brian, Frances Brokaw, Johnny Mack Brown, Tom Brown, Bob Burns, Frances Cagney, James Cagney, Claudette Colbert, Joan Crawford, Delmar Daves, Andy Devine, Dorothy Devine, Natalie Draper, Jack Dunn, Sally Eilers, Douglas Fairbanks Jr., Henry Fonda, Kay Francis, Phyllis Fraser (Ginger’s cousin), Betty Furness, Skeets Gallagher, Cary Grant, Johnny Green, Vinton Hayworth, Libby Holman, Phillips Holmes, George Jessel, Arthur Lake, Florence Lake, June Lang, Mervyn LeRoy, Harold Lloyd, Anita Louise, Edmund Lowe, Frederic March, Una Merkel, Mayo Methot, Frank Morgan, Chester Morris, Lela Rogers (Ginger’s mother), George Murphy, Jack Oakie, Hermes Pan, Lloyd Pantages, Cole Porter, Cesar Romero, Eddie Rubin, Anne Shirley, Simone Simon, Jimmy Stewart, Heather Thatcher, Franchot Tone, Claire Trevor, Toby Wing, Loretta Young, photographer John Miehle, and a Gershwin who somehow avoided the cameraman: Ira Gershwin. (See below for AI photo illustr-AI-tions of Ira busting moves on wheels.)\n\nSome highlights of the evening include:\n\nJoan Crawford’s blue and white sailor get-up was adorable, but it belied her overall very serious demeanor that night.\n\nRefreshments were served at 11, which was too late for Simone Simon who had to go out to eat and come back.\n\nRogers and Vanderbilt hired a dance band for the evening, and the food served consisted of spaghetti, chili, tamales, baked beans, ham, cheese, hot dogs, hamburgers, and NO alcohol.\n\nThose who couldn’t skate, like Kay Francis, could get pulled around on a “sled-on-wheels.” But despite being pulled around the rink (by Hollywood’s leading men?), Kay claimed the party was dull.\n\nInstructors were hired for the night to help the uninitiated.\n\nSally Eilers pinned a pillow to her “where it would do the most good.”\n\nMixing roller skating with musical chairs (once called “Going to Jerusalem” evidently) out on the rink, was a perfect recipe for mayhem and fun. Jimmy Stewart got so into the game that Lucille Ball had to straighten his mussed-up hair for a photo afterward.\n\nJimmy Stewart had to be treated later for water on the knee from his skating exploits. File under “The Bigger They Are …”?\n\nChampion skaters of the night were said to be James Cagney, Joan Bennett, Jack Oakie, Joan Crawford, Jack Dunn, George Murphy, Loretta Young, Henry Fonda, Una Merkel, Douglas Fairbanks Jr., Cesar Romero, and Harold Lloyd.\n\nLibby Holman was said to have fallen down the most—and it showed on her white outfit!\n\nHeather Thatcher skated in a monocle while Claire Trevor skated with ice cream in hand.\n\nWhen a bunch of balloons were dropped from the ceiling, the skaters proceeded to stomp them into oblivion. More mayhem ensued when a food fight broke out with sandwiches as the weapon of choice.\n\nIf reports are to be believed, June Lang had to plead with George Gershwin to get him out on the rink with her. This was just four months before his passing, so how up for the physical challenge the former roller skate champion was is definitely in question.\n\nThe party lasted “until the early hours of the morning.”\n\nCan you guess which of these celebrities decided to drag three chairs out onto the rink and jump them in succession? If you guessed Ira Gershwin, you need to read more about Ira on this website. The first two of the jumps were successful, but the third one involved landing right on the backside. After the fall, that celebrity said, “I used to travel with a circus and did this for a living. I was pretty good at it then. I just haven’t done it in a little while.” [Answer at bottom of this article.]\n\nSpeaking of skating falls, Ginger admitted that she and Fred Astaire had not really roller skated since they were about eight years old, so they had a lot of practice ahead of them when the Shall We Dance roller skating number was called for. During rehearsals, Ginger “skinned her knee, broke six fingernails, and permanently injured her little finger.” And despite all that, she threw her skating extravaganza anyway!\n\nEven with her new-found skating prowess, Ginger claimed that she fell 19 times during the party! Her and her cohost’s opinion was that “There never was a better party! Alfred and I agreed on that. Everyone dressed very casually and had a great time.”\n\nThe theme of the party gives the initial impression of a publicity stunt for Ginger Rogers’ movie Shall We Dance, but that does not appear to be her (only) angle. Reportedly, in deference to the wishes of her cohost Alfred Vanderbilt, only select movie studio photographers were allowed in. The news service photographers complained, but they were told they would get access to those photos. Ginger then held off releasing those photos until they were old news.\n\nAnd Since There Were No ACTUAL photos of Ira Gershwin at the All Skates Day Party\n\nThough the AI image generator certainly got plenty wrong, this is pretty state-of-the-art in 2024 and will only get better from here. I generated an initial image by feeding the AI actual photos of the party and of Ira in that era, and then I took the best of those and did a face swap with different software for these results. I did swap out one woman’s face with Lee Gershwin’s face, though I know her hairstyle doesn’t match her hair in 1937.\n\nAnswer: Our mystery roller-skating daredevil was none other than Humphrey Bogart."
