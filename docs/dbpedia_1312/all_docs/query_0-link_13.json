        "text": "Kirsten Caroline Dunst is an American actress, who also holds German citizenship. She was born on April 30, 1982 in Point Pleasant, New Jersey, to parents Inez (née Rupprecht), who owned an art gallery, and Klaus Dunst, a medical services executive. She has a younger brother named Christian Dunst, born in 1987. Her father is German, from Hamburg, and her mother, who is American, is of German and Swedish descent.\n\nHer career began at the age of 3 when she started modeling and appearing in commercials.

She received her first film credit in Fegefeuer der Eitelkeiten (1990). Her family moved to Los Angeles in 1993, where her film career took off.\n\nIn 1994, she made her breakthrough performance in Interview mit einem Vampir (1994), alongside such stars as Brad Pitt and Tom Cruise. Her performance earned her a Golden Globe nomination, the MTV Award for Best Breakthrough Performance and the Saturn Award for Best Young Actress. In 1995, she was named one of People Magazine's 50 Most Beautiful People. Over the next few years, she made a string of hit movies including Betty und ihre Schwestern (1994), Jumanji (1995) and Small Soldiers (1998).\n\nIn 2000, she received rave reviews for her role as \"Lux Lisbon\" in Sofia Coppola's independent film, The Virgin Suicides - Verlorene Jugend (1999) and proved her status as a leading actress in the comedy hit, Girls United (2000). She also graduated from Notre Dame High School in Los Angeles in June of that year.\n\nIn 2002, she landed one of her best known roles as Peter Parker's love interest, Mary Jane Watson, in Spider-Man (2002).

He is the son of Ata Johnson (born Feagaimaleata Fitisemanu) and professional wrestler Rocky Johnson (born Wayde Douglas Bowles). His father, from Amherst, Nova Scotia, Canada, is black (of Black Nova Scotian descent), and his mother is of Samoan background (her own father was Peter Fanene Maivia, also a professional wrestler). While growing up, Dwayne traveled around a lot with his parents and watched his father perform in the ring. During his high school years, Dwayne began playing football and he soon received a full scholarship from the University of Miami, where he had tremendous success as a football player. In 1995, Dwayne suffered a back injury which cost him a place in the NFL. He then signed a three-year deal with the Canadian League but left after a year to pursue a career in wrestling.\n\nHe made his wrestling debut in the USWA under the name Flex Kavanah where he won the tag team championship with Brett Sawyer. In 1996, Dwayne joined the WWE and became Rocky Maivia where he joined a group known as \"The Nation of Domination\" and turned heel. Rocky eventually took over leadership of the \"Nation\" and began taking the persona of The Rock. After the \"Nation\" split, The Rock joined another elite group of wrestlers known as the \"Corporation\" and began a memorable feud with Steve Austin. Soon the Rock was kicked out of the \"Corporation\". He turned face and became known as \"The Peoples Champion\". In 2000, the Rock took time off from WWE to film his appearance in Die Mumie kehrt zurück (2001). He returned in 2001 during the WCW/ECW invasion where he joined a team of WWE wrestlers at The Scorpion King (2002), a prequel to Die Mumie kehrt zurück (2001).\n\nDwayne has a daughter, Simone Alexandra Johnson, born in 2001, with his ex-wife Dany Garcia, and daughters, Jasmine, born in 2015, and Tiana Gia, born in 2018, with his wife, singer and songwriter Lauren Hashian.\n\nWelsh actor John Rhys-Davies was born in Ammanford, Carmarthenshire, Wales, to Mary Margaretta Phyllis (nee Jones), a nurse, and Rhys Davies, a mechanical engineer and Colonial Officer. He graduated from the University of East Anglia and is probably best known to film audiences for his roles in the blockbuster hits Jäger des verlorenen Schatzes (1981) and Indiana Jones und der letzte Kreuzzug (1989). He was introduced to a new generation of fans in the blockbuster trilogy \"The Lord of the Rings\" (Der Herr der Ringe: Die Gefährten (2001), (Der Herr der Ringe: Die zwei Türme (2002), and (Der Herr der Ringe: Die Rückkehr des Königs (2003)) in the role of Gimli the dwarf. He has also had leading roles in Victor/Victoria (1982), James Bond 007 - Der Hauch des Todes (1987) and Quatermain - Auf der Suche nach dem Schatz der Könige (1985).\n\nRhys-Davies, who was raised in England, Africa and Wales, credits his early exposure to classic literature for his decision to pursue acting and writing. He later refined his craft at London's Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (of which he is now an Associate Member). His television credits include James Clavell's Shogun (1980) and Noble House (1988), Große Erwartungen (1989), Feuersturm und Asche (1988) and Archaeology (1991). An avid collector of vintage automobiles, Rhys-Davies has a host of theater roles to his credit, including \"The Misanthrope\", \"Hedda Gabler\", and most of Shakespeare's works. He divides his time between Los Angeles and the Isle of Man.\n\nSeth Woodbury MacFarlane was born in the small New England town of Kent, Connecticut, where he lived with his mother, Ann Perry (Sager), an admissions office worker, his father, Ronald Milton MacFarlane, a prep school teacher, and his sister, Rachael MacFarlane, now a voice actress and singer. He is of English, Scottish, and Irish ancestry, and descends from Mayflower passengers.\n\nSeth attended and studied animation at the Rhode Island School of Design and, after he graduated, he was hired by Hanna-Barbera Productions (Now called Cartoon Network Studios) working as an animator and writer on the TV series Johnny Bravo (1997) and Cow and Chicken - Muh-Kuh und Chickie (1997). He also worked for Walt Disney Animation as a writer on the TV series Die Dschungelbuch Kids (1996). He created The Life of Larry (1995) which was originally supposed to be used as an in-between on MADtv (1995). Unfortunately the deal fell through but, a few months later, executives at FOX called him into their offices and gave him $50,000 to create a pilot for what would eventually become Family Guy (1999).\n\nSince Family Guy's debut, MacFarlane has gone on to create two other television shows-American Dad (2005) and The Cleveland Show (2009). MacFarlane began to establish himself as an actor, voice actor, animator, writer, producer, director, comedian, and singer throughout his career. MacFarlane has also written, directed and starred in Ted (2012) and its sequel Ted 2 (2015), and A Million Ways To Die In The West (2014). He voiced the mouse, Mike, in the animated musical Sing (2016).\n\nOne of the hottest stars of the mid-1980s, Virginia Madsen has since played a variety of roles that have cemented her reputation as a fantastic actress who can adapt to any part.\n\nVirginia was born in Chicago, Illinois, and belongs to an acting family -- with her brother, Michael Madsen, also an actor, and her mother, Elaine Madsen (née Melson), an Emmy-winning writer, poet, and producer. Her paternal grandparents were Danish, and her father, Calvin Madsen, was a firefighter. Audiences first caught a glimpse of her as \"Princess Irulan\" in the 1984 science fiction epic Der Wüstenplanet (1984). She followed that up with Electric Dreams (1984); however, it was in 1986 that Virginia captured the hearts of the audience with an intense portrayal of a Catholic school girl who fell in love with a boy from a prison camp in Duncan Gibbins' Fire with Fire - Verbotene Leidenschaft (1986). Virginia played the role of \"Lisa\" and her co-star was Craig Sheffer, who played Lisa's love interest, \"Joe Fisk\". Kari Wuhrer also made an appearance as Virginia's best friend, \"Gloria\". Fire with Fire - Verbotene Leidenschaft (1986) was a low-budget production, starring a bunch of fresh faces who were till then-unknown to Hollywood. However, the movie was a success and elevated its three young stars overnight. Virginia has never looked back since.\n\nNot only did she receive amazing reviews for her Academy Award and Golden Globe nominated performance in Alexander Payne's hit film, Sideways (2004), but this Independent Spirit Award-winning actress has an illustrious resume of roles alongside the most notable and respected actors in the business.\n\nAlso on Virginia's slate is her production company, with partner Karly Meola, called \"Title IX Productions\". Their first project was the documentary I Know a Woman Like That (2009), which previewed at the Phoenix Film Festival in April 2009 and premiered at the Chicago Film Festival in October 2009. The doc was directed by Virginia's mother, Elaine Madsen, about the lives of extraordinary women ages 64-94. Next in the company's lineup is the documentary Fighting Gravity (2010), about women ski jumpers' ongoing battle for the right to compete in the 2010 Winter Olympics. Title IX will team up with \"Empire 8 Productions\" and Vancouver-based \"Screen Siren\" on the project. The duo also has several projects in development that they're shopping around for financing including screenwriters Sebastian Gutierrez's screen adaptation of Martha O'Connor's novel \"The Bitch Posse\" and a remake of the 1984 film Electric Dreams (1984), in which Virginia appeared.\n\nSarah Silverman was most recently the host of the two-time Emmy-nominated weekly topical series, I Love You America, which streamed on Hulu and also received a Writers Guild Awards nomination.\n\nSilverman is currently working on a musical adaptation of her 2010 memoir and New York Times Bestseller called The Bedwetter: Stories of Courage, Redemption, and Pee. The musical, The Bedwetter, will premiere Off Broadway at the Atlantic Theatre Company in April 2020.\n\nOn-stage, Silverman continues to cement her status as a force in stand-up comedy. In May 2017, she released her latest standup special A Speck of Dust on Netflix, which culminated in two Emmy Award nominations and a Grammy Award nomination. In 2013, she debuted her hour-long HBO standup special Sarah Silverman: We Are Miracles, which earned her the 2014 Primetime Emmy Award for \"Outstanding Writing for a Variety Special.\" The special received an additional Primetime Emmy Awards nomination that year for \"Outstanding Variety Special\" in addition to a Writers Guild Awards nomination. In September 2014, Silverman released the special as an audio album through Sub Pop Records, which went on to receive a 2015 Grammy Awards nomination for \"Best Comedy Album.\" Previously, Silverman made an impressive splash with her concert-meets-comedy film Sarah Silverman: Jesus is Magic, which garnered major attention at the Toronto Film Festival.\n\nIn the film world, Silverman was most recently seen opposite Emma Stone and Steve Carell in the critically-acclaimed film Battle of the Sexes, which was based on the true story of the 1973 tennis match between Billie Jean King and Bobby Riggs. She also starred in I Smile Back, the film adaptation of the Amy Koppelman novel. The drama premiered at the 2015 Sundance Film Festival and was later released in theaters by Broad Green Pictures. Silverman received much praise for her role as \"Laney Brooks,\" culminating in a 2016 Screen Actors Guild Award nomination for \"Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Leading Role.\" Her additional film credits include The Book of Henry, Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping, Ashby, A Million Ways to Die in the West, Take This Waltz, Gravy, Peep World, I Want Someone to Eat Cheese With, The School of Rock, There's Something About Mary, The Way of The Gun. Silverman also lent her voice as \"Vanellope\" in the Oscar-nominated smash hit Wreck It Ralph and Golden Globe nominated Wreck it Ralph 2: Ralph Breaks the Internet.\n\nSilverman was nominated for a 2009 Primetime Emmy Award for \"Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series\" for her portrayal of a fictionalized version of herself in her Comedy Central series The Sarah Silverman Program. This marked Comedy Central's first ever Emmy nomination in a scripted acting category. Silverman also received a Writers Guild Award nomination for her work on the show. In 2008, Silverman won a Primetime Emmy Award for \"Outstanding Original Music and Lyrics\" for her musical collaboration with Matt Damon. Additionally, she was honored with a Webby Award for \"Best Actress\" for her online video \"The Great Schlep,\" in which she persuaded young kids to encourage their grandparents in Florida to vote for President Obama prior to the 2008 Presidential Election.\n\nSilverman has made memorable guest appearances on a number of acclaimed and notable television shows, including Monk, which earned her a 2008 Primetime Emmy Awards nomination for \"Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series.\" Silverman also lends her voice to Emmy Award-winning FOX animated series Bob's Burgers. Her additional television work includes buzzed-about roles on HBO's Crashing, Masters of Sex, The Good Wife, The Larry Sanders Show, Seinfeld, and Mr. Show with Bob and David. Silverman has hosted a number of major awards shows, including the 2007 MTV Movie Awards and the Independent Spirit Awards.\n\nSilverman grew up in New Hampshire and attended one year of New York University. In 1993 she joined Saturday Night Live as a writer and feature performer and has not stopped working since.\n\nShe currently lives in Los Angeles.\n\nTeri Hatcher is an American actress, writer, presenter, and former NFL cheerleader. She is known for her television roles, portraying Lois Lane on the ABC series Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman (1993-1997), and as Susan Mayer on the television series Desperate Housewives (2004-2012), for which she won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Musical or Comedy, three Screen Actors Guild Awards, and a Primetime Emmy nomination for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series.\n\nTeri Lynn Hatcher was born in Palo Alto, California, the only child of Esther (Beshur), a computer programmer, and Owen Walker Hatcher, Jr., a nuclear physicist and electrical engineer. She has Syrian (from her immigrant maternal grandfather), Frisian, English, and Irish ancestry. Teri grew up in Sunnyvale, California, and spent her childhood dancing, and fishing with her father. While at Fremont High School, she was captain of the Featherettes, a dance team that had the look of regular cheerleaders, with the exception of the large headdresses they wore. She was voted \"Most Likely to Become a Solid Gold (1980) Dancer\" by her graduating class in 1982. Hatcher studied acting at the American Conservatory Theater in San Francisco while taking a degree course in mathematics and engineering at De Anza College in Cupertino, California. She became a member of the 1984 Gold Rush, the name of the professional cheer leading squad of the American football San Francisco 49ers.\n\nHatcher went to Hollywood to lend moral support to a friend during a open casting call. She, however, auditioned and won the role of the singing and dancing mermaid for the television series Love Boat (1977). She went on to play \"Penny Parker,\" a ditsy but sweet-hearted struggling actress on Macgyver (1985). When that show ended, she auditioned for and won the role of smart and savvy \"Lois Lane\" on Superman: Die Abenteuer von Lois & Clark (1993), saying that she didn't want to be stuck with the pretty airhead image she had acquired as \"Penny Parker.\"\n\nShe married actor Jon Tenney in May 1994. She gave birth to daughter Emerson Tenney on November 10, 1997. Later, she signed to play \"Sally Bowles\" in a road tour of Cabaret. The tour debuted in Los Angeles on March 2, 1999. Her final show was on September 4, 1999. She stayed out of the industry for a little bit before nabbing a role on the darkly comedic soap opera Desperate Housewives (2004), which could have been a huge mistake. The show turned out to be a mega-hit, which skyrocketed Hatcher to the A-list. Her portrayal of a divorced mother, \"Susan Mayer,\" was consistently named as America's favorite \"Desperate Housewife.\" Hatcher won both a Golden Globe for Lead Actress in a Comedy Series and the SAG Award for Female Actor in a Comedy Series before the show's first season was even over.\n\nA six-time Emmy Award winner, Kelsey Grammer was born in Saint Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands, to Sally (Cranmer), a singer, and Frank Allen Grammer, Jr., a musician and restaurateur, who were from the mainland. He was raised in New Jersey and Florida. Grammer was drawn to the works of William Shakespeare and spent two years at the prestigious Juilliard School. He then dove into the world of regional theater, eventually making the leap to Broadway with roles in \"Macbeth\" and \"Othello.\" He joined the cast of the situation comedy Cheers (1982) in 1984.\n\nGrammer is the first actor in television history to receive multiple Emmy nominations for performing the same role on three series. He received two nominations for his original portrayal of Dr. Frasier Crane on Cheers (1982), another for his guest appearance in that role on Überflieger (1990), and nine nominations (earning four awards) as Outstanding Actor for his work on Frasier (1993). Over the years, Dr. Frasier Crane has become one of television's most endearing and enduring characters. In addition to his Emmy Awards, Grammer has won two Golden Globe Awards, two American Comedy Awards and a People's Choice Award for his portrait. Grammer's distinctive voice has been heard in several hit animated features, including the voice of Stinky Pete in Disney's hit Toy Story 2 (1999) and a role in Anastasia (1997). On television, he has also been seen in several mini-series and movies. In 1996, he hosted an hour-long salute to Jack Benny for which he served as executive producer. He also starred in HBO's award-winning comedy Krieg im Pentagon (1998). Grammer's autobiography, \"So Far,\" was published in fall 1995.\n\nPeter Frederick Weller was born in Stevens Point, Wisconsin, to Dorothy Jean (Davidson) and Frederick Bradford Weller, a federal judge and career helicopter pilot for the United States Army. He traveled extensively as his father literally flew around the world. Before he was out of his teens, he had attended high schools in Heidelberg, Germany and San Antonio, Texas, then enrolled the University of North Texas -- attracted by the chance of playing trumpet in one of the college's celebrated jazz bands. Music is in his family. Three generations on his mother's side were piano players and jazz is still his overriding interest. Ask him who his favorite performer in any art form is and he will say Miles Davis. It was with a B.A. in Theatre and a scholarship to the American Academy of Dramatic Arts that he left Texas for New York. Two weeks after graduating, he made his first appearance on Broadway as David in Joseph Papp's New York Shakespeare Festival production of David Rabe's \"Sticks and Bones\", a role he repeated on the London stage.\n\nWhile a student of legendary actress and drama coach, Uta Hagen, Weller appeared on and off Broadway in works like William Inge's \"Summer Brave\", Thomas Babe's \"Rebel Women\" and \"Full Circle\", one of the last plays directed by Otto Preminger. He began garnering critical acclaim with his portrayal of Billie Wilson in \"Streamers\", directed by Mike Nichols for Joseph Papp at Lincoln Center. He continued that success with his performances as Cliff in \"The Woolgatherer\" and as Nick in the first American production of David Mamet's \"The Woods\". During this period, he became a member of the highly respected Actor's Studio, under the aegis of Elia Kazan and Lee Strasberg.\n\nWeller's film debut was in Richard Lester's Butch und Sundance - Die frühen Jahre (1979). He then co-starred with Alan King and Ali MacGraw in Sidney Lumet's Sag mir, was Du willst (1980) and, with Albert Finney and Diane Keaton, in Alan Parker's Der Konflikt - Du oder Beide (1982). Other film credits include Moving in - Eine fast intakte Familie (1984) with Teri Garr, the HBO made-for-TV Apology - Tödliches Geständnis (1986), co-starring Lesley Ann Warren, and Of Unknown Origin (1983), the film which won Weller the Best Actor award at the Paris International Film Festival for his performance as an upwardly mobile bachelor with a serious rat problem. That same film also marked his first association with Leviathan (1989) director George P. Cosmatos.\n\nVanessa Lynne Williams was born on March 18, 1963 in Tarrytown, Greenburgh, New York and raised in Millwood, New Castle, New York to Helen Williams & Milton Williams, both music teachers. Vanessa and her brother grew up in suburban New York in comfortable surroundings. Vanessa sang and danced in school productions and signed her high school yearbook with a promise to \"see you on Broadway\". After winning a performing scholarship to Syracuse University, she left school and tried to make it in New York show business. She began entering beauty contests in 1984, eventually winning Miss New York and then becoming the first African-American Miss America. During her reign, some nude girl-girl photos, taken while she was in New York, surfaced in Penthouse magazine. Although the photos were taken before her beauty contest victories, she was forced to resign her crown. Many predicted that her future in show business was over. She went on to land a recording contract and released several albums, including \"The Comfort Zone\" and \"The Sweetest Days\".\n\nVanessa made her film debut in 1986 in Geschäft mit dem Tod (1987) and appeared in the films Jack, der Aufreißer (1987), Das andere Ich (1991) and Harley Davidson and the Marlboro Man (1991). She starred opposite Arnold Schwarzenegger in Eraser (1996), opposite Laurence Fishburne and Andy Garcia in Hoodlum (1997) and the box office hit, Soul Food (1997). She also starred in Dance with Me (1998), Light It Up (1999), Shaft - Noch Fragen? (2000), opposite Samuel L. Jackson and Johnson Family Vacation (2004). She starred recently in the independent features, My Brother (2006) and And Then Came Love (2007) (aka \"Somebody Like You\"). On television, Vanessa starred in such movies and mini-series as Eine Nacht im Savoy (1992), Der Brief an den Weihnachtsmann (1990), Die Jacksons - Ein amerikanischer Traum (1992), ABC's revival of Bye Bye Birdie (1995), Ärztinnen - Auf Leben und Tod (1995), Die Abenteuer des Odysseus (1997), Don Quichotte (2000) and Keep the Faith, Baby (2002), and she executive-produced and starred in Lifetime's The Courage to Love (2000) for Lifetime and the VH1 Original Movie, Ein ganz besonderes Weihnachtsfest (2000).\n\nHer albums \"The Right Stuff\", \"The Comfort Zone and \"The Sweetest Days\" earned multiple Grammy nominations and have yielded the Academy Award-winning single \"Colors of the Wind\", from Disney's Pocahontas: The Musical Tradition Continues (1995). Her recordings also include two holiday albums, \"Star Bright\" and \"Silver & Gold\", \"Vanessa Williams Greatest Hits: The First Ten Years\" and \"Everlasting Love\", a romantic collection of love songs from the 1970's. In 1994, Vanessa took Broadway by storm when she replaced Chita Rivera in \"Kiss of the Spider Woman\", winning the hearts of critics and becoming a box-office sensation. She garnered rave reviews and was nominated for a Tony Award for the 2002 revival of \"Into the Woods\". She also headlined a limited special engagement of the classic, \"Carmen Jones\", at the Kennedy Center and starred in the Encore! Series staged concert production of \"St. Louis Woman\".\n\nShe stars in ABC's critically-acclaimed hit series, Alles Betty! (2006), for which she has won or been nominated for numerous individual and ensemble awards, including the Emmy, SAG Award, Golden Globe and NAACP Image Awards. Vanessa achieved a career pinnacle, with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for her accomplishments as a performer. Her charitable endeavors are many and varied, embracing and supporting such organizations as Special Olympics and many others.\n\nTerrance Quinn (born July 15, 1952), known professionally as Terry O'Quinn, is an American actor. He played John Locke on the TV series Lost (2004), the title role in Kill, Daddy, Kill! (1987) and Stepfather II (1989), and Peter Watts in Millennium: Fürchte deinen Nächsten wie dich selbst (1996), which ran for three seasons (1996-1999). He has also hosted Mysteries of The Missing on The Science Channel.\n\nO'Quinn was born at War Memorial Hospital in Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan, one of 11 siblings, and grew up in nearby Newberry, Michigan. He is of Irish and English descent, and was raised Roman Catholic. He attended Central Michigan University in Mount Pleasant, Michigan, and the University of Iowa in Iowa City. He changed his surname from Quinn to O'Quinn as another registered actor already had the name Terrance Quinn.\n\nIn the 1970s he came to Baltimore to act in the Center Stage production of Tartuffe. He remained at Center Stage for some years and often appeared with the late Tana Hicken, most notably as Benedick to her Beatrice in Much Ado About Nothing. His first movie role was in Heaven's Gate.\n\nO'Quinn began acting in the 1970s during his time at Central Michigan University. He not only was an actor but also playwright/director. He wrote and directed the musical Orchestrina. This musical featured five main characters: The Man (played by Jeff Daniels), The Boy (Harold Downs), The Woman (Ann O'Donnell), The Girl (Debbie Penwarden), and The Drunk (James Hilliker), plus a female and a male chorus. He was roommates at CMU with actor Brad Slaight.\n\nStarting in 1980, O'Quinn has appeared in various feature films such as Silver Bullet, Tombstone, Heaven's Gate, Young Guns, alongside Rutger Hauer in Blind Fury, and as Howard Hughes in The Rocketeer.\n\nO'Quinn also appeared in the Canadian horror movie, Pin (1988) alongside British-born Canadian actor, David Hewlett.\n\nHis early television roles include guest appearances on Miami Vice (episode \"Give a Little, Take a Little\"), Moonlighting, Star Trek: The Next Generation (episode \"The Pegasus\"), The Twilight Zone (1985 revival; episode \"Chameleon\"), Homicide: Life on the Street (episode \"Hate Crimes\"), a recurring role on Earth 2, another recurring role as Captain (& later Rear Admiral) Thomas Boone on JAG, as well as Colonel Will Ryan in episode 15 of season 1 on the JAG spin-off series NCIS (episode \"Enigma\").\n\nAround 1995, O'Quinn made guest appearances in The X-Files and Harsh Realm, produced by Chris Carter, who also cast him in the film The X-Files: Fight The Future and then once again in the final season. In 1996 O'Quinn started acting in the television series Millennium as Peter Watts, also produced by Chris Carter. O'Quinn held this role for all three seasons of the series. O'Quinn holds the distinction of having played four different characters within the extended X-Files/Millennium continuum (the two shows being classed together since both Lance Henriksen's character of Frank Black and Charles Nelson Reilly's character of Jose Chung have appeared in both shows).\n\nHe was the eldest son of the Jordanian royal couple: King Ibn Talal Hussein (1935-1999) came to the throne in 1952 and was married to the British Toni Gardiner for the second time until 1971. Thanks to his British mother, Abdullah was able to attend school in England and then college in the USA. After school, he trained at US and British military academies. In this context, he also stayed temporarily with the British occupying troops in the Federal Republic. He dropped out of a political science course that Abdullah was pursuing at the universities of Oxford and Georgetown without graduating. After returning home, Abdullah pursued a career in the Jordanian military.\n\nIn 1994 he was promoted to major general. Although Abdullah's uncle, Hassan Ibn Talal, had previously been appointed crown prince, the cancer-stricken king named his eldest son as heir to the throne in January 1999. When his father succumbed to his illness on February 7, 1999, the crown prince was proclaimed King of Jordan as Abdullah II on the same day. A month later, the new head of state expressed his desire for renewal by appointing a new government. As a result, Abdullah II demonstrated unusual assertiveness on the issue of the Palestinians, from whom at least 60% of the population comes: the new king banned the controversial \"Hamas\" movement, deported its leaders and arrested many members.\n\nAfter Jordan had supported neighboring dictator Saddam Hussein during the Iraqi occupation of Kuwait in the early 1990s, the country now sought to adopt a self-confident attitude towards Iraq and to move closer to the Western world as well as to Kuwait and Saudi Arabia. Internally, however, Abdullah II was unable to initiate the urgently needed economic and administrative reforms. A democratic opening and revitalization of the country's political culture was neglected. Immediately after the terrorist attack on the USA on September 11, 2001, controlled by Osama bin Laden, Abdullah II represented to the West in February 2002 the demand for comprehensive economic aid for the Arab-Muslim countries.\n\nIn contrast, Jordan remains subject to police-state conditions in the political sphere, which foreign media also feel: In the summer of 2002, the station of the TV channel \"Al Jasira\" was closed because of critical reporting on the Israel policy of Abdullah II's predecessors to the throne and the journalists expelled. Abdullah II has been married to Rania Al-Jassin, a native of Palestine, since 1993, with whom they have four children: Prince Hussein (1994), Princess Iman (1996), Princess Salma (2000) and Prince Hashim (2005).\n\nDean Robert Stockwell grew up in North Hollywood, the son of Broadway performers Harry Stockwell and Elizabeth \"Betty\" Stockwell (née Veronica). His vaudevillian father was a replacement Curly in the original production of \"Oklahoma!\". He was also a decent tenor whose voice was used for the part of Prince Charming in Disney's Schneewittchen und die sieben Zwerge (1937). Dean's mother was a one-time Broadway chorine who used the stage moniker \"Betty Veronica.\" His older brother was the actor Guy Stockwell.\n\nAt the age of seven, Dean made his stage debut in a Theater Guild production of Paul Osborn's The Innocent Voyage, in which his brother was also cast. The play ran for nine month. Dean was eventually spotted by a talent scout, and, on the strength of his performance, was signed by MGM in 1945. Under contract until 1947 (and again from 1949 to 1950), Stockwell became a highly sought-after child star in films like Urlaub in Hollywood (1945), with Gene Kelly and Frank Sinatra, Das Vermächtnis (1946) and Das Lied des dünnen Mannes (1947). His impish, dimpled looks and tousled brown hair combined with genuine acting talent kept him on the box office front line for more than a decade. Having won a Golden Globe Award as Best Juvenile Actor for Tabu der Gerechten (1947) (on loan-out to 20th Century Fox), Stockwell went on to play the title role in an adaptation of Rudyard Kipling's Kim - Geheimdienst in Indien (1950). He came to admire his co-star Errol Flynn as a sort of role model. Thereafter, Stockwell segued into television for several years until resurfacing as a mature actor in Richard Fleischer's Der Zwang zum Bösen (1959), (based on the infamous Leopold & Loeb murder case), co-starring with Bradford Dillman as one of the two young killers, and Orson Welles. He had already played the part on Broadway in 1957, on this occasion partnering Roddy McDowall. His last film role of note in the early 60s was as Edmund Tyrone in Eugene O'Neill's Long Day's Journey Into Night (1962). Despite developing a drinking problem on the set (for which he was chastised by Katharine Hepburn), Stockwell gave a solid performance which he later described as a career highlight.\n\nStockwell dropped out of show biz for some time in the 60s to join the hippie scene at which time he befriended Neil Young and Dennis Hopper. Later in the decade, he made a gleeful comeback in low budget psychedelic counterculture (Psych-Out (1968)) biker films (The Loners (1972)) and horror comedies (Der Werwolf von Washington (1973)). Keeping a considerably lower profile during the 70s, he became a frequent TV guest star in popular crime dramas like Mannix (1967), Columbo (1971) Die Straßen von San Francisco (1972) and Police Story - Immer im Einsatz (1973). By the early 80s, work opportunities had become scarcer and Stockwell was compelled to briefly sideline as a real estate broker. He nonetheless managed to make a comeback with a co-starring role in the Wim Wenders road movie Paris, Texas (1984). New York Times reviewer Vincent Canby wrote of his performance \"Mr. Stockwell, the former child star, has aged very well, becoming an exceptionally interesting, mature actor.\" Stockwell subsequently enjoyed high billing in David Lynch's noirish psycho-thriller Blue Velvet (1986) and received an Oscar nomination for his Mafia don Tony \"The Tiger\" Russo in Die Mafiosi-Braut (1988). His television career also flourished, as cigar-smoking, womanizing rear admiral Al Calavicci in the popular science fiction series Zurück in die Vergangenheit (1989). The role won him a Golden Globe Award in 1990 and a new generation of fans. When the show ended after five seasons, Stockwell remained gainfully employed for another decade, still frequently seen as political or military authority figures (Navy Secretary Edward Sheffield in J.A.G. - Im Auftrag der Ehre (1995), Defence Secretary Walter Dean in Air Force One (1997)) or evil alien antagonists (Colonel Grat in Star Trek: Enterprise (2001), humanoid Cylon John Cavil in Battlestar Galactica (2004)).\n\nOutside of acting, Stockwell embraced environmental issues and exhibited works of art, notably collages and sculptures. In 2015, he was forced to retire from acting after suffering a stroke. Stockwell died on November 7, 2021 due to natural causes at the age of 85."
