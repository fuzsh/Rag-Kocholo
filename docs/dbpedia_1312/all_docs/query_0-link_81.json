        "text": "PART I: The Eye in the Pyramid\n\nTo Gregory Hill and Kerry Thornley\n\nBOOK ONE: VERWIRRUNG\n\nThe history of the world is the history of the warfare between secret societies.\n\n—Ishmael Reed, Mumbo-Jumbo\n\nTHE FIRST TRIP, OR KETHER From Dealey Plaza To Watergate …\n\nThe Purple Sage opened his mouth and moved his tongue and so spake to them and he said:\n\nThe Earth quakes and the Heavens rattle; the beasts of nature flock together and the nations of men flock apart; volcanoes usher up heat while elsewhere water becomes ice and melts; and then on other days it just rains.\n\nIndeed do many things come to pass.\n\n—Lord Omar Khayaam Ravenhurst, K.S.C., “The Book of Predications.” The Honest Book of Truth\n\nIt was the year when they finally immanentized the Eschaton. On April 1, the world’s great powers came closer to nuclear war than ever before, all because of an obscure island named Fernando Poo. By the time international affairs returned to their normal cold-war level, some wits were calling it the most tasteless April Fool’s joke in history. I happen to know all the details about what happened, but I have no idea how to recount them in a manner that will make sense to most readers. For instance, I am not even sure who I am, and my embarrassment on that matter makes me wonder if you will believe anything I reveal. Worse yet, I am at the moment very conscious of a squirrel—in Central Park, just off Sixty-eighth Street, in New York City—that is leaping from one tree to another, and I think that happens on the night of April 23 (or is it the morning of April 24?), but fitting the squirrel together with Fernando Poo is, for the present, beyond my powers. I beg your tolerance. There is nothing I can do to make things any easier for any of us, and you will have to accept being addressed by a disembodied voice just as I accept the compulsion to speak out even though I am painfully aware that I am talking to an invisible, perhaps nonexistent, audience. Wise men have regarded the earth as a tragedy, a farce, even an illusionist’s trick; but all, if they are truly wise and not merely intellectual rapists, recognize that it is certainly some kind of stage in which we all play roles, most of us being very poorly coached and totally unrehearsed before the curtain rises. Is it too much if I ask, tentatively, that we agree to look upon it as a circus, a touring carnival wandering about the sun for a record season of four billion years and producing new monsters and miracles, hoaxes and bloody mishaps, wonders and blunders, but never quite entertaining the customers well enough to prevent them from leaving, one by one, and returning to their homes for a long and bored winter’s sleep under the dust? Then, say, for a while at least, that I have found an identity as ringmaster; but that crown sits uneasily on my head (if I have a head) and I must warn you that the troupe is small for a universe this size and many of us have to double or triple our stints, so you can expect me back in many other guises. Indeed do many things come to pass.\n\nFor instance, right now, I am not at all whimsical or humorous. I am angry. I am in Nairobi, Kenya, and my name is, if you will pardon me, Nkrumah Fubar. My skin is black (does that disturb you? it doesn’t me), and I am, like most of you, midway between tribalism and technology; to be more blunt, as a Kikuyu shaman moderately adjusted to city life, I still believe in witchcraft—I haven’t, yet, the folly to deny the evidence of my own senses. It is April 3 and Fernando Poo has ruined my sleep for several nights running, so I hope you will forgive me when I admit that my business at the moment is far from edifying and is nothing less than constructing dolls of the rulers of America, Russia, and China. You guessed it: I am going to stick pins in their heads every day for a month; if they won’t let me sleep, I won’t let them sleep. That is Justice, in a sense.\n\nIn fact, the President of the United States had several severe migraines during the following weeks; but the atheistic rulers of Moscow and Peking were less susceptible to magic. They never reported a twinge. But, wait, here is another performer in our circus, and one of the most intelligent and decent in the lot—his name is unpronounceable, but you can call him Howard and he happens to have been born a dolphin. He’s swimming through the ruins of\n\nAtlantis and it’s April 10 already—time is moving; I’m not sure what Howard sees but it bothers him, and he decides to tell Hagbard Celine all about it. Not that I know, at this point, who Hagbard Celine is. Never mind; watch the waves roll and be glad there isn’t much pollution out here yet. Look at the way the golden sun lights each wave with a glint that, curiously, sparkles into a silver sheen; and watch, watch the waves as they roll, so that it is easy to cross five hours of time in one second and find ourselves amid trees and earth, with even a few falling leaves for a touch of poetry before the horror. Where are we? Five hours away, I told you—five hours due west, to be precise, so at the same instant that Howard turns a somersault in Atlantis, Sasparilla Godzilla, a tourist from Simcoe, Ontario (she had the misfortune to be born a human being) turns a neat nosedive right here and lands unconscious on the ground. This is the outdoor extension of the Museum of Anthropology in Chapultepec Park, Mexico, D.F., and the other tourists are rather upset about the poor lady’s collapse. She later said it was the heat. Much less sophisticated in important matters than Nkrumah Fubar, she didn’t care to tell anybody, or even to remind herself, what had really knocked her over. Back in Simcoe, the folks always said Harry Godzilla got a sensible woman when he married Sasparilla, and it is sensible in Canada (or the United States) to hide certain truths. No, at this point I had better not call them truths. Let it stand that she either saw, or imagined she saw, a certain sinister kind of tight grin, or grimace, cross the face of the gigantic statue of Tlaloc, the rain god. Nobody from Simcoe had ever seen anything like that before; indeed do many things come to pass.\n\nAnd, if you think the poor lady was an unusual case, you should examine the records of psychiatrists, both institutional and private, for the rest of the month. Reports of unusual anxieties and religious manias among schizophrenics in mental hospitals skyrocketed; and ordinary men and women walked in off the street to complain about eyes watching them, hooded beings passing through locked rooms, crowned figures giving unintelligible commands, voices that claimed to be God or the Devil, a real witch’s brew for sure. But the sane verdict was to attribute all this to the aftermath of the Fernando Poo tragedy.\n\nThe phone rang at 2:30 a.m. the morning of April 24. Numbly, dumbly, mopingly, gropingly, out of the dark, I find and identify a body, a self, a task. “Goodman,” I say into the receiver, propped up on one arm, still coming a long way back.\n\n“Bombing and homicide,” he electrically eunuchoid voice in the transmitter tells me. I sleep naked (sorry about that), and I’m putting on my drawers and trousers as I copy the address. East Sixty-eighth Street, near the Council on Foreign Relations. “Moving,” I say, hanging up.\n\n“What? Is?” Rebecca mumbles from the bed. She’s naked, too, and that recalls very pleasant memories of a few hours earlier. I suppose some of you will be shocked when I tell you I’m past sixty and she’s only twenty-five. It doesn’t make it any better that we’re married, I know.\n\nThis isn’t a bad body, for its age, and seeing Rebecca, most of the sheets thrown aside, reminds me just how good it is. In fact, at this point I don’t even remember having been the ringmaster, or what echo I retain is confused with sleep and dream. I kiss her neck, unselfconsciously, for she is my wife and I am her husband, and even if I am an inspector on the Homicide Squad—Homicide North, to be exact—any notions about being a stranger in this body have vanished with my dreams into air. Into thin air.\n\n“What?” Rebecca repeats, still more asleep than awake.\n\n“Damned fool radicals again,” I say, pulling on my shirt, knowing any answer is as good as another in her half-conscious state.\n\n“Um,” she says, satisfied, and turns over into deep sleep again.\n\nI washed my face somewhat, tired old man watching me from the mirror, and ran a brush through my hair. Just time enough to think that retirement was only a few years away and to remember a certain hypodermic needle and a day in the Catskills with my first wife, Sandra, back when they at least had clean air up there … socks, shoes, tie, fedora … and you never stop mourning, as much as I loved Rebecca I never stopped mourning Sandra. Bombing and homicide. What a meshuganah world. Do you remember when you could at least drive in New York at three in the morning without traffic jams? Those days were gone; the trucks that were banned in the daytime were all making their deliveries now. Everybody was supposed to pretend the pollution went away before dawn. Papa used to say, “Saul, Saul, they did it to the Indians and now they’re doing it to themselves. Goyische narrs.” He left Russia to escape the pogrom of 1905, but I guess he saw a lot before he got out. He seemed like a cynical old man to me then, and I seem like a cynical old man to others now. Is there any pattern or sense in any of it?\n\nThe scene of the blast was one of those old office buildings with Gothic-and-gingerbread styling all over the lobby floor. In the dim light of the hour, it reminded me of the shadowy atmosphere of Charlie Chan in the Wax Museum. And a smell hit my nostrils as soon as I walked in.\n\nA patrolman lounging inside the door snapped to attention when he recognized me. “Took out the seventeenth floor and part of the eighteenth,” he said. “Also a pet shop here on the ground level. Some freak of dynamics. Nothing else is damaged down here, but every fish tank went. That’s the smell.”\n\nBarney Muldoon, an old friend with the look and mannerisms of a Hollywood cop, appeared out of the shadows. A tough man, and nowhere as dumb as he liked to pretend, which was why he was head of the Bomb Squad.\n\n“Your baby, Barney?” I asked casually.\n\n“Looks that way. Nobody killed. The call went out to you because a clothier’s dummy was burned on the eighteenth floor and the first car here thought it was a human body.”\n\n(Wait: George Dorn is screaming….)\n\nSaul’s face showed no reaction to the answer—but poker players at the Fraternal Order of Police had long ago given up trying to read that inscrutible Talmudic countenance. As Barney Muldoon, I knew how I would feel if I had the chance to drop this case on another department and hurry home to a beautiful bride like Rebecca Goodman. I smiled down at Saul—his height would keep him from appointment to the Force now, but the rules were different when he was young—and I added quietly, “There might be something in it for you, though.”\n\nThe fedora ducked as Saul took out his pipe and started to fill it. All he said was, “Oh?”\n\n“Right now,” I went on, “we’re just notifying Missing Persons, but if what I’m afraid of is right, it’ll end up on your desk after all.”\n\nHe struck a match and started puffing. “Somebody missing at this hour … might be found among the living … in the morning,” he said between drags. The match went out, and shadows moved where nobody stirred.\n\n“And he might not, in this case,” Muldoon said. “He’s been gone three days now.”\n\n“An Irishman your size can’t be any more subtle than an elephant,” Saul said wearily. “Stop tantalizing me. What have you got?”\n\n“The office that was hit,” Muldoon explained, obviously happy to share the misery, “was a magazine called Confrontation. It’s kind of left-of-center, so this was probably a right-wing job and not a left-wing one. But the interesting thing is that we couldn’t reach the editor, Joseph Malik, at his home, and when we called one of the associate editors, what do you think he told us? Malik disappeared three days ago. His landlord confirms it. He’s been trying to get hold of Malik himself because there’s a no-pets rule there and the other tenants are complaining about his dogs. So, if a man drops out of sight and then his office gets bombed, I kind of think the matter might come to the attention of the Homicide Department eventually, don’t you?”\n\nSaul grunted. “Might and might not,” he said. “I’m going home. I’ll check with Missing Persons in the morning, to see what they’ve got.”\n\nThe patrolman spoke up. “You know what bothers me most about this? The Egyptian mouth-breeders.”\n\n“The what?” Saul asked.\n\n“That pet shop,” the patrolman explained, pointing to the other end of the lobby. “I looked over the damage, and they had one of the best collections of rare tropical fish in New York City. Even Egyptian mouth-breeders.” He noticed the expressions on the faces of the two detectives and added lamely, “If you don’t collect fish, you wouldn’t understand. But, believe me, an Egyptian mouth-breeder is pretty hard to get these days, and they’re all dead in there.”\n\n“Mouth-breeder?” Muldoon asked incredulously.\n\n“Yes, you see they keep their young in their mouths for a couple days after birth and they never, never swallow them. That’s one of the great things about collecting fish: you get to appreciate the wonders of nature.”\n\nMuldoon and Saul looked at each other. “It’s inspiring,” Muldoon said finally, “to have so many college graduates on the Force these days.”\n\nThe elevator door opened, and Dan Pricefixer, a redheaded young detective on Muldoon’s staff, emerged, carrying a metal box.\n\n“I think this is important, Barney,” he began immediately, with just a nod to Saul. “Damned important. I found it in the rubble, and it had been blown partly open, so I looked inside.”\n\n“And?” Muldoon prompted.\n\n“It’s the freakiest bunch of interoffice memos I ever set eyes on. Weird as tits on a bishop.”\n\nThis is going to be a long night, Saul thought suddenly, with a sinking feeling. A long night, and a heavy case.\n\n“Want to peek?” Muldoon asked him maliciously.\n\n“You better find a place to sit down,” Pricefixer volunteered. “It’ll take you awhile to go through them.”\n\n“Let’s use the cafeteria,” Saul suggested.\n\n“You just have no idea,” the patrolman repeated. “The value of an Egyptian mouth-breeder.”\n\n“It’s rough for all nationalities, man or fish,” Muldoon said in one of his rare attempts to emulate Saul’s mode of speech. He and Saul turned to the cafeteria, leaving the patrolman looking vaguely distressed.\n\nHis name is James Patrick Hennessy and he’s been on the Force three years. He doesn’t come back into this story at all. He had a five-year-old retarded son whom he loved helplessly; you see a thousand faces like his on the street every day and never guess how well they are carrying their tragedies … and George Dorn, who once wanted to shoot him, is still screaming…. But Barney and Saul are in the cafeteria. Look around. The transition from the Gothic lobby to this room of laminated functional and glittering plastic colors is, one might say, trippy. Never mind the smell; we’re closer to the pet shop here.\n\nSaul removed his hat and ran a hand through his gray hair pensively, as Muldoon read the first two memos in one quick scan. When they were passed over, he put on his glasses and read more slowly, in his own methodical and thoughtful way. Hold onto your hats. This is what they said:\n\nILLUMINATI PROJECT: MEMO #1\n\n7/23\n\nJ.M.:\n\nThe first reference I’ve found is in Violence by Jacques Ellul (Seabury Press, New York, 1969). He says (pages 18–19) that the Illuminated Ones were founded by Joachim of Floris in the 11th century and originally taught a primitive Christian doctrine of poverty and equality, but later under the leadership of Fra Dolcino in the 15th century they became violent, plundered the rich and announced the imminent reign of the Spirit. “In 1507,” he concludes, “they were vanquished by the ‘forces of order’—that is, an army commanded by the Bishop of Vercueil.” He makes no mention of any Illuminati movement in earlier centuries or in more recent times.\n\nI’ll have more later today.\n\nPat\n\nP.S. I found a little more about Joachim of Floris in the back files of the National Review. William Buckley and his cronies think Joachim is responsible for modern liberalism, socialism and communism; they’ve condemned him in fine theological language. He committed the heresy, they say, of “immanentizing the Christian Eschaton.” Do you want me to look that up in a technical treatise on Thomism? I think it means bringing the end of the world closer, sort of.\n\nILLUMINATI PROJECT: MEMO #2\n\n7/23\n\nJ.M.:\n\nMy second source was more helpful: Akron Daraul, A History of Secret Societies (Citadel Press, New York, 1961).\n\nDaraul traces the Illuminati back to the 11th century also, but not to Joachim of Floris. He sees the origin in the Ishmaelian sect of Islam, also known as the Order of Assassins. They were vanquished in the 13th century, but later made a comeback with a new, less-violent philosophy and eventually became the Ishmaelian sect of today, led by the Aga Khan. However, in the 16th century, in Afghanistan, the Illuminated Ones (Roshinaya) picked up the original tactics of the Order of Assassins. They were wiped out by an alliance of the Moguls and Persians (pages 220–223). But, “The beginning of the seventeenth century saw the foundation of the Illuminated Ones of Spain—the Allumbrados, condemned by an edict of the Grand Inquisition in 1623. In 1654, the ‘illuminated’ Guerinets came into public notice in France.” And, finally—the part you’re most interested in- the Bavarian IIluminati was founded on May Day, 1776, in Ingolstadt, Bavaria, by Adam Weishaupt, a former Jesuit. “Documents still extant show several points of resemblance between the German and Central Asian Illuminists: points that are hard to account for on grounds of pure coincidence” (page 255). Weishaupt’s Illuminati were suppressed by the Bavarian government in 1785; Daraul also mentions the Illuminati of Paris in the 1880s, but suggests it was simply a passing fad. He does not accept the notion that the Illuminati still exist today.\n\nThis is beginning to look big. Why are we keeping the details from George?\n\nPat\n\nSaul and Muldoon exchanged glances. “Let’s see the next one,” Saul said. He and Muldoon read together:\n\nILLUMINATI PROJECT: MEMO #3\n\n7/24\n\nJ.M.:\n\nThe Encyclopedia Britannica has little to say on the subject (1966 edition, Volume 11, “Halicar to Impala,” page 1094):\n\nIlluminati, a short-lived movement of republican free thought founded on May Day 1776 by Adam Weishaupt, professor of canon law at Ingolstadt and a former Jesuit…. From 1778 onward they began to make contact with various Masonic lodges where, under the impulse of A. Knigge (q.v.) one of their chief converts, they often managed to gain a commanding position….\n\nThe scheme itself had its attractions for literary men like Goethe and Herder, and even for the reigning dukes of Gotha and Weimar….\n\nThe movement suffered from internal dissention and was ultimately banned by an edict of the Bavarian government in 1785.\n\nPat\n\nSaul paused. “I’ll make you a bet, Barney,” he said quietly. “The Joseph Malik who vanished is the J.M. these memos were written for.”\n\n“Sure,” Muldoon replied scornfully. “These Illuminati characters are still around, and they got him. Honest to God, Saul,” he added, “I appreciate the way your mind usually pole-vaults ahead of the facts. But you can ride a hunch just so far when you’re starting from nothing.”\n\n“We’re not starting from nothing,” Saul said softly. “Here’s what we’ve got to start with. One”—he-held up a finger—“a building is bombed. Two”—another finger—“an important executive disappeared three days before the bombing. Already, there’s an inference, or two inferences: something got him, or else he knew something was coming for him and he ducked out. Now, look at the memos. Point three”—he held up another finger—“a standard reference work, the Encyclopedia Britannica, seems to be wrong about when the Illuminati came into existence. They say eighteenth-century Germany, but the other memos trace it back to—let’s see—Spain in the seventeenth century, France in the seventeenth century, then in the eleventh century back to Italy and halfway across the world to Afghanistan. So we’ve got a second inference: if the Britannica is wrong about when the thing started, they may be wrong about when it ended. Now, put these three points and two inferences together—”\n\n“And the Illuminati got the editor and blew up his office. Nutz. I still say you’re going too fast.”\n\n“Maybe I’m not going fast enough,” Saul said. “An organization that has existed for a couple of centuries minimum and kept its secrets pretty well hidden most of that time might be pretty strong by now.” He trailed off into silence, and closed his eyes to concentrate. After a moment, he looked at the younger man with a searching glance.\n\nMuldoon had been thinking too. “I’ve seen men land on the moon,” he said. “I’ve seen students break into administration offices and shit in the dean’s waste basket. I’ve even seen nuns in mini-skirts. But this international conspiracy existing in secret for eight hundred years, it’s like opening a door in your own house and finding James Bond and the President of the United States personally shooting it out with Fu Manchu and the five original Marx Brothers.”\n\n“You’re trying to convince yourself, not me. Barney, it sticks out so far that you could break it into three pieces and each one would be long enough to goose somebody up in the Bronx. There is a secret society that keeps screwing up international politics. Every intelligent person has suspected that at one time or another. Nobody wants war any more, but wars keep happening—why? Face it, Barney—this is the heavy case we’ve always had nightmares about. It’s cast iron. If it were a corpse, all six pallbearers would get double hernias at the funeral. Well?” Saul prompted.\n\n“Well, we’re either going to have to do something or get off the pot, as my sainted mother used to say.”\n\nIt was the year when they finally immanentized the Eschaton. On April 1 the world’s great powers came closer to nuclear war than ever before, all because of an obscure island named Fernando Poo. But, while all other eyes turned to the UN building in apprehension and desperate hope, there lived in Las Vegas a unique person known as Carmel. His house was on Date Street and had a magnificent view of the desert, which he appreciated. He liked to spend long hours looking at the wild cactus wasteland although he did not know why. If you told him that he was symbolically turning his back upon mankind, he would not have understood you, nor would he have been insulted; the remark would be merely irrelevant to him. If you added that he himself was a desert creature, like the gila monster and the rattlesnake, he would have grown bored and classified you as a fool. To Carmel, most of the world were fools who asked meaningless questions and worried about pointless issues; only a few, like himself, had discovered what was really important—money— and pursued it without distractions, scruples, or irrelevancies. His favorite moments were those, like this night of April 1, when he sat and tallied his take for the month and looked out his picture window occasionally at the flat sandy landscape, dimly lit by the lights of the city behind him. In this physical and emotional desert he experienced happiness, or something as close to happiness as he could ever find. His girls had earned $46,000 during March, of which he took $23,000; after paying 10 percent to the Brotherhood for permission to operate without molestation by Banana-Nose Maldonado’s soldiers, this left a tidy profit of $20,700, all of it tax free. Little Carmel, who stood five feet two and had the face of a mournful weasel, beamed as he completed his calculations; his emotion was as inexpressible, in normal terms, as that of a necrophile who had just broken into the town morgue. He had tried every possible sexual combination with his girls; none gave him the frisson of looking at a figure like that at the end of a month.\n\nHe did not know that he would have another $5 million, and incidentally become the most important human being on earth, before May 1. If you tried to explain it to him, he would have brushed everything else aside and asked merely, “The five million—how many throats do I hafta cut to get my hands in it?”\n\nBut wait: Get out the Atlas and look up Africa. Run your eyes down the map of the western coast of that continent until you come to Equatorial Guinea. Stop at the bend where part of the Atlantic Ocean curves inward and becomes the Bight of Biafra. You will note a chain of small islands; you will further observe that one of these is Fernando Poo. There, in the capital city of Santa Isobel, during the early 1970s, Captain Ernesto Tequilla y Mota carefully read and reread Edward Luttwak’s Coup d’Etat: A Practical Handbook, and placidly went about following Luttwak’s formula for a perfect coup d’etat in Santa Isobel. He set up a timetable, made his first converts among other officers, formed a clique, and began the slow process of arranging things so that officers likely to be loyal to Equatorial Guinea would be on assignment at least forty-eight hours away from the capital city when the coup occurred. He drafted the first proclamation to be issued by his new government; it took the best slogans of the most powerful left-wing and right-wing groups on the island and embedded them firmly in a tapiocalike context of bland liberal-conservatism. It fit Luttwak’s prescription excellently, giving everybody on the island some small hope that his own interests and beliefs would be advanced by the new regime. And, after three years of planning, he struck: the key officials of the old regime were quickly, bloodlessly, placed under house arrest; troops under the command of officers in the cabal occupied the power stations and newspaper offices; the inoffensively fascist-conservative-liberal-communist proclamation of the new People’s Republic of Fernando Poo went forth to the world over the radio station in Santa Isobel. Ernesto Tequilla y Mota had achieved his ambition—promotion from captain to generalissimo in one step. Now, at last, he began wondering about how one went about governing a country. He would probably have to read a new book, and he hoped there was one as good as Luttwak’s treatise on seizing a country. That was on March 14.\n\nOn March 15, the very name of Fernando Poo was unknown to every member of the House of Representatives, every senator, every officer of the Cabinet, and all but one of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. In fact, the President’s first reaction, when the CIA report landed on his desk that afternoon, was to ask his secretary, “Where the hell is Fernando Poo?”\n\nSaul took off his glasses and polished them with a handkerchief, conscious of his age and suddenly more tired than ever. “I outrank you, Barney,” he began.\n\nMuldoon grinned. “I know what’s coming.”\n\nMethodically, Saul went on, “Who, on your staff, do you think is a double agent for the CIA?”\n\n“Robinson I’m sure of, and Lehrman I suspect.”\n\n“Both of them go. We take no chances.”\n\n“I’ll have them transferred to the Vice Squad in the morning. How about your own staff?”\n\n“Three of them, I think, and they go, too.”\n\n“Vice Squad’ll love the increase in manpower.”\n\nSaul relit his pipe. “One more thing. We might be hearing from the FBI.”\n\n“We might indeed.”\n\n“They get nothing.”\n\n“You’re really taking me way out on this one, Saul.”\n\n“Sometimes you have to follow your hunches. This is going to be a heavy case, agreed?”\n\n“A heavy case,” Muldoon nodded.\n\n“Then we do it my way.”\n\n“Let’s look at the fourth memo,” Muldoon said tone-lessly. They read:\n\nILLUMINATI PROJECT: MEMO #4\n\n7/24\n\nJ.M.:\n\nHere’s a letter that appeared in Playboy a few years ago (“The Playboy Advisor,” Playboy, April, 1969, pages 62–64):\n\nI recently heard an old man of right-wing views—a friend of my grandparents—assert that the current wave of assassinations in America is the work of a secret society called the Illuminati. He said that the Illuminati have existed throughout history, own the international banking cartels, have all been 32nd-de-gree Masons and were known to Ian Fleming, who portrayed them as Spectre in his James Bond books—for which the Illuminati did away with Mr. Fleming. At first all this seemed like a paranoid delusion to me. Then I read in The New Yorker that Allan Chapman, one of Jim Garrison’s investigators in the New Orleans probe of the John Kennedy assassination, believes that the Illuminati really exist….\n\nPlayboy, of course, puts down the whole idea as ridiculous and gives the standard Encyclopedia Britannica story that the Illuminati went out of business in 1785.\n\nPat\n\nPricefixer stuck his head in the cafeteria door. “Minute?” he asked.\n\n“What is it?” Muldoon replied.\n\n“Peter Jackson is out here. He’s the associate editor I spoke to on the phone. He just told me something about his last meeting with Joseph Malik, the editor, before Malik disappeared.”\n\n“Bring him in,” Muldoon said.\n\nPeter Jackson was a black man—truly black, not brown or tan. He was wearing a vest in spite of the spring weather. He was also very obviously wary of policemen. Saul noted this at once, and began thinking about how to overcome it—and at the same time he observed an increased blandness in Muldoon’s features, indicating that he, too, had noted it and was prepared to take umbrage.\n\n“Have a seat,” Saul said cordially, “and tell us what you just told the other officer.” With the nervous ones it was sound policy to drop the policeman role at first, and try to sound like somebody else—somebody who, quite naturally, asks a lot of questions. Saul began slipping into the personality of his own family physician, which he usually used at such times. He made himself feel a stethoscope hanging about his neck.\n\n“Well,” Jackson began in a Harvard accent, “this is probably not important. It may be just a coincidence.”\n\n“Most of what we hear is just unimportant coincidence,” Saul said gently. “But it’s our job to listen.”\n\n“Everybody but the lunatic fringe has given up on this by now,” Jackson said. “It really surprised me when Joe told me what he was getting the magazine into.” He paused and studied the two impassive faces of the detectives; finding little there, he went on reluctantly. “It was last Friday. Joe told me he had a lead that interested him, and he was putting a staff writer on it. He wanted to reopen the investigation of the assassinations of Martin Luther King and the Kennedy brothers.”\n\nSaul carefully didn’t look at Muldoon, and just as carefully moved his hat to cover the memos on the table. “Excuse me a moment,” he said politely and left the cafeteria.\n\nHe found a phone booth in the lobby and dialed his home. Rebecca answered after the third ring; she obviously had not gotten back to sleep after he left. “Saul?” she asked, guessing who would be calling at this hour.\n\n“It’s going to be a long night,” Saul said.\n\n“Oh, hell.”\n\n“I know, baby. But this case is a son-of-a-bitch!”\n\nRebecca sighed. “I’m glad we had a little ball earlier this evening. Otherwise, I’d be furious.”\n\nSaul thought, suddenly, of how this conversation would sound to an outsider. A sixty-year-old man and a twenty-five-year-old wife. And if they knew she was a whore and a heroin addict when I first met her …\n\n“Do you know what I’m going to do?” Rebecca lowered her voice. “I’m going to take off my nightgown, and throw the covers to the foot of the bed, and lie here naked, thinking about you and waiting.”\n\nSaul grinned. “A man my age shouldn’t be able to respond to that, after doing what I did earlier.”\n\n“But you did respond, didn’t you?” Her voice was confident and sensual.\n\n“I sure did. I won’t be able to leave the phone booth for a couple of minutes.”\n\nShe chuckled softly and said, “I’ll be waiting….”\n\n“I love you,” he said, surprised (as always) at the simple truth of it in a man his age. I won’t be able to leave the phone booth at all if this keeps up, he thought. “Listen,” he added hurriedly, “let’s change the subject before I start resorting to the vices of a high school boy. What do you know about the Illuminati?” Rebecca had been an anthropology major, with a minor in psychology, before the drug scene had captured her and she fell into the abyss from which he had rescued her; her erudition often astonished him.\n\n“It’s a hoax,” she said.\n\n“A what?”\n\n“A hoax. A bunch of students at Berkeley started it back around sixty-six or sixty-seven.”\n\n“No, that’s not what I’m asking. The original Illuminati in Italy and Spain and Germany in the fifteenth to eighteenth centuries? You know?”\n\n“Oh, that’s the basis of the hoax. Some right-wing historians think the Illuminati still exist, you see, so these students opened an Illuminati chapter on the campus at Berkeley and started sending out press releases on all sorts of weird subjects, so people who want to believe in conspiracies would have some evidence to point to. That’s all there is to it. Sophomore humor.”\n\nI hope so, Saul thought. “How about the Ishmaelian sect of Islam?”\n\n“It has twenty-three divisions, but the Aga Khan is the leader of all of them. It was founded around—oh—1090 A.D., I think, and was originally persecuted, but now it’s part of the orthodox Moslem religion. It has some pretty weird doctrines. The founder, Hassan i Sabbah, taught that nothing is true and everything is permissible. He lived up to that idea—the word ‘assassin’ is a corruption of his name.”\n\n“Anything else?”\n\n“Yes, now that I think of it. Sabbah introduced marijuana to the Western world, from India. The word ‘hashish’ also comes from his name.”\n\n“This is a heavy case,” Saul said, “and now that I can walk out of the phone booth without shocking the patrolman in the hall, I’ll get back to work on it. Don’t say anything that’ll get me aroused again. Please.”\n\n“I won’t. I’ll just lie here naked and …”\n\n“Good-bye.”\n\n“Good-bye,” she said, laughing.\n\nSaul hung up frowning. Goodman’s intuition, the other detectives call it. It’s not intuition; it’s a way of thinking beyond and between the facts, a way of sensing wholes, of seeing that there must be a relationship between fact number one and fact number two even if no such relationship is visible yet. And I know. There is an Illuminati, whether or not those kids at Berkeley are kidding.\n\nHe came out of his concentration and realized where he was. For the first time, he noticed a sticker on the door:\n\nTHIS PHONE BOOTH RESERVED FOR CLARK KENT\n\nHe grinned: an intellectual’s kind of joke. Probably somebody on the magazine.\n\nHe walked back to the cafeteria, reflecting. “Nothing is true. Everything is permissible.” With a doctrine like that, people were capable of … He shuddered. Images of Buchenwald and Belsen, of Jews who might have been him….\n\nPeter Jackson looked up as he reentered the cafeteria. An intelligent, curious black face. Muldoon was as impassive as the faces on Mount Rushmore. “Mad Dog, Texas, was the town where Malik thought these … assassins … had their headquarters,” Muldoon said. “That’s where the staff writer was sent.”\n\n“What was the staff writer’s name?” Saul asked.\n\n“George Dora,” Muldoon said. “He’s a young kid who used to be in SDS. And he was once rather close to the Weatherman faction.”\n\nHagbard Celine’s gigantic computer, FUCKUP—First Universal Cybernetic-Kinetic-Ultramicro-Programmer— was basically a rather sophisticated form of the standard self-programming algorithmic logic machine of the time; the name was one of his whimsies. FUCKUP’s real claim to uniqueness was a programmed stochastic process whereby it could “throw” an I Ching hexagram, reading a random open circuit as a broken (yin) line and a random closed circuit as a full (yang) line until six such “lines” were round. Consulting its memory banks, where the whole tradition of I Ching interpretation was stored, and then cross-checking its current scannings of that day’s political, economic, meterological, astrological, astronomical, and technological eccentricities, it would provide a reading of the hexagram which, to Hagbard’s mind, combined the best of the scientific and occult methods for spotting oncoming trends. On March 13, the stochastic pattern spontaneously generated Hexagram 23, “Breaking Apart” FUCKUP then interpreted:\n\nThis traditionally unlucky sign was cast by Atlantean scientist-priests shortly before the destruction of their continent and is generally connected with death by water. Other vibrations link it to earthquakes, tornadoes and similar disasters, and to sickness, decay, and morbidity as well.\n\nThe first correlation is with the unbalance between technological acceleration and political retrogression, which has proceeded earthwide at everwidening danger levels since 1914 and especially since 1964. The breaking apart is fundamentally the schizoid and schismatic mental fugue of lawyer-politicians attempting to administrate a worldwide technology whose mechanisms they lack the education to comprehend and whose gestalttrend they frustrate by breaking apart into obsolete Rennaisance nation-states.\n\nWorld War III is probably imminent and, considering the advances in chemicalbiological warfare in conjunction with the sickness vibrations of Hexagram 23, the unleashing of plague or nervegas or both is as probable as thermonuclear overkill.\n\nGeneral prognosis: many megadeaths.\n\nThere is some hope for avoidance of the emerging pattern with prompt action of correct nature. Probability of such avoidance is 0.17 ± 0.05.\n\nNo blame.\n\n“My ass, no blame,” Hagbard raged; and rapidly reprogrammed FUCKUP to read off to him its condensed psychobiographies of the key figures in world politics and the key scientists in chemobiological warfare.\n\nThe first dream came to Dr. Charles Mocenigo on February 2—more than a month before FUCKUP picked up the vibrations. He was, as usual with him, aware that he was dreaming, and the vision of a gigantic pyramid which seemed to walk or lumber about meant nothing and quickly vanished. Now he seemed to be looking at an enlargement of the DNA double helix; it was so detailed that he began searching it for the bonding irregularities at every 23rd Angstrom. To his surprise, they were missing; instead, there were other irregularities at each 17th Angstrom. “What the devil …?” he asked—and the pyramid returned seeming to speak and saying, “Yes, the devil.” He jolted awake, with a new concept, Anthrax-Leprosy-Mu, coming into consciousness, and began jotting in his bedside pad.\n\n“What the hell is this Desert Door project?” the President had asked once, scrutinizing the budget. “Germ warfare,” an aide explained helpfully. “They started with something called Anthrax Delta and now they’ve worked their way up to something called Anthrax Mu and …” His voice was drowned out by the rumble of paper shredders in the next room. The President recognized the characteristic sound of the “cesspool cleaners” hard at work. “Never mind,” he said. “Those things make me nervous.” He scribbled a quick “OK” next to the item and went on to “Deprived Children,” which made him feel better. “Here,” he said, “this is something we can cut.”\n\nHe forgot everything about Desert Door, until the Fernando Poo crises. “Suppose, just suppose,” he asked the Joint Chiefs on March 29, “I go on the tube and threaten all-out thermonuclear heck, and the other side doesn’t blink. Have we got something that’ll scare them even more?”\n\nThe J.C.’s exchanged glances. One of them spoke tentatively. “Out near Las Vegas,” he said, “we have this Desert Door project that seems to be way ahead of the Comrades in b-b and b-c—”\n\n“That’s biological-bacteriological and biological-chemical,” the President explained to the Vice-President, who was frowning. “It has nothing to do with B-B guns.” Turning his attention back to the military men, he asked, “What have we got specifically that will curdle Ivan’s blood?”\n\n“Well, there’s Anthrax-Leprosy-Mu…. It’s worse than any form of anthrax. More deadly than bubonic and anthrax and leoprosy all in one lump. As a matter of fact,” the General who was speaking smiled grimly at the thought, “our evaluation suggests that with death being so quick, the psychological demoralization of the survivors—if there are any survivors—will be even worse than in thermonuclear exchange with maximum ‘dirty’ fallout.”\n\n“By golly,” the President said. “By golly. We won’t use that out in the open. My speech’ll just talk Bomb, but we’ll leak it to the boys in the Kremlin that we’ve got this anthrax gimmick in cold storage, too. By gosh, you just wait and see them back down.” He stood up, decisive, firm, the image he always projected on television. “I’m going to see my speechwriters right now. Meanwhile, arrange that the brain responsible for this Anthrax-Pi gets a raise. What’s his name?” he asked over his shoulder going out the door.\n\n“Mocenigo. Dr. Charles Mocenigo.”\n\n“A raise for Dr. Charles Mocenigo,” the President called from the hallway.\n\n“Mocenigo?” the Vice-President asked thoughtfully. “Is he a wop?”\n\n“Don’t say wop,” the President shouted back. “How many times do I have to tell you? Don’t say wop or kike or any of those words anymore.” He spoke with some asperity, since he lived daily with the dread that someday the secret tapes he kept of alt Oval Room transactions would be released to the public. He had long ago vowed that if that day ever came, the tapes would not be full of “(expletive deleted)” or “(characterization deleted).” He was harassed, but still he spoke with authority. He was, in fact, characteristic of the best type of dominant male in the world at this time. He was fifty-five years old, tough, shrewd, unburdened by the complicated ethical ambiguities which puzzle intellectuals, and had long ago decided that the world was a mean son-of-a-bitch in which only the most cunning and ruthless can survive. He was also as kind as was possible for one holding that ultra-Darwinian philosophy; and he genuinely loved children and dogs, unless they were on the site of something that had to be bombed in the National Interest. He still retained some sense of humor, despite the burdens of his almost godly office, and, although he had been impotent with his wife for nearly ten years now, he generally achieved orgasm in the mouth of a skilled prostitute within 1.5 minutes. He took amphetamine pep pills to keep going on his grueling twenty-hour day, with the result that his vision of the world was somewhat skewed in a paranoid direction, and he took tranquilizers to keep from worrying too much, with the result that his detachment sometimes bordered on the schizophrenic; but most of the time his innate shrewdness gave him a fingernail grip on reality. In short, he was much like the rulers of Russia and China.\n\nIn Central Park, the squirrel woke again as a car honked loudly in passing. Muttering angrily, he leaped to another tree and immediately went back to sleep. At the all night Bickford’s restaurant on Seventy-second Street, a young man named August Personage left a phone booth after making an obscene call to a woman in Brooklyn; he left behind one of his this phone booth reserved for clark Kent stickers. In Chicago, one hour earlier on the clock but the same instant, the phone booth closed, a rock group called Clark Kent and His Supermen began a revival of “Rock Around the Clock”: their leader, a tall black man with a master’s degree in anthropology, had been known as El Hajj Starkerlee Mohammed during a militant phase a few years earlier, and his birth certificate said Robert Pearson on it. He was observing his audience and noted that that bearded young white cat, Simon, was with a black woman as usual—a fetish Pearson-Mohammed-Kent could understand by reverse psychology, since he preferred white chicks himself. Simon, for once, was not entranced by the music; instead, he was deep in conversation with the girl and drawing a diagram of a pyramid on the table to explain what he meant. “Crown Point,” Pearson heard him say over the music. And listening to “Rock Around the Clock” ten years earlier, George Dorn had decided to let his hair grow long, smoke dope and become a musician. He had succeeded in two of those ambitions. The statue of Tlaloc in the Museum of Anthropology, Mexico, D.F., stared inscrutably upward, toward the stars … and the same stars glittered above the Carribean where the porpoise named Howard sported in the waves.\n\nThe motorcade passes the Texas School Book Depository and moves slowly toward the Triple Underpass. At the sixth-floor window, Lee Harvey Oswald sights carefully through the Carcano-Mannlicher: his mouth is dry, desert dry. But his heartbeat is normal; and no sweat stands out on his forehead. This is the moment, he is thinking, the one moment transcending time and hazard, heredity and environment, the final test and proof of free will and of my right to call myself a man. In this moment, now, as I tighten the trigger, the Tyrant dies, and with him all the lies of a cruel, mendacious epoch. It is a supreme exalation, this moment and this knowledge: and yet his mouth is dry, dust-dry, dry as death, as if his salivary glands alone rebelled against the murder which his intellect pronounced necessary and just. Now: He recalls the military formula BASS: Breathe, Aim, Slack, Squeeze. He breathes, he aims, he slacks, he starts to squeeze, as a dog barks suddenly—\n\nAnd his mouth falls open in astonishment as three shots ring out, obviously from the direction of the Grassy Knoll and Triple Underpass.\n\n“Son-of-a-bitch,” he said, softly as a prayer. And he began to grin, a rictus not of omnipotence such as he had expected but of something different and unexpected and therefore better—omniscience. That smirk appeared in all the photos during the next day and a half, before his own death, a sneering smile that said so clearly that none dared to read it:I know something you don’t know. That grimace only faded Sunday morning when Jack Ruby pumped two bullets into Lee’s frail fanatic body, and its secret went with him to the grave. But another part of the secret had already left Dallas on Friday afternoon’s TWA Whisperjet to Los Angeles, traveling behind the business suit, gray hair, and only moderately sardonic eyes of a little old man who was listed on the flight manifest as “Frank Sullivan.”\n\nThis is serious, Peter Jackson was thinking; Joe Malik wasn’t on a paranoid trip at all. The noncommital expressions of Muldoon and Goodman did not deceive him at all—he had long ago learned the black art of surviving in a white world, which is the art of reading not what is on a face but what is behind the face. The cops were worried and excited, like any hunters on the track of something both large and dangerous. Joe was right about the assassination plot, and his disappearance and the bombing were part of it. And that meant George Dorn was in danger, too, and Peter liked George even if he was a snotty kid in some ways and an annoying ass-kisser about the race thing like most young white radicals. Mad Dog, Texas, Peter thought: that sure sounds like a bad place to be in trouble.\n\n(Almost fifty years before, a habitual bank robber named Harry Pierpont approached a young convict in Michigan City Prison and asked him, “Do you think there might be a true religion?”)\n\nBut why is George Dorn screaming while Saul Goodman is reading the memos? Hold on for another jump, and this one is a shocker. Saul is no longer human; he’s a pig. All cops are pigs. Everything you’ve ever believed is probably a lie. The world is a dark, sinister, mysterious and totally frightening place. Can you digest all that quickly? Then, walk into the mind of George Dorn for the second time, five hours before the explosion at Confrontation (four hours before, on the clock) and suck on the joint, suck hard and hold it down. (“One o’clock … two o’clock … three o’clock … rock!”). You are sprawled on a crummy bed in a rundown hotel, and a neon light outside is flashing pink and blue patterns into your room. Exhale slowly, feel the hit of the weed and see if the wallpaper looks any brighter yet, any less Unintentional Low Camp. It’s hot, Texas-dry hot, and you push your long hair back from your forehead and haul out your diary, George Dorn, because reading over what you wrote last sometimes helps you to learn what you’re really getting into. As the neon splotches the page with pink and blue, read this:\n\nApril 23\n\nHow do we know whether the universe is getting bigger or the objects in it are getting smaller? You can’t say that the universe is getting bigger in relation to anything outside it, because there isn’t any outside for it to relate to. There isn’t any outside. But if the universe doesn’t have an out-side, then it goes on forever. Yeah, but, its in-side doesn’t go on forever. How do you know it doesn’t, shithead? You’re just playing with words, man.\n\n—No I’m not. The universe is the inside without an outside, the sound made by one </qutoe>\n\nThere was a knock at the door.\n\nThe Fear came over George. Whenever he was high, the least little detail wrong in his world would bring the Fear, irresistible, uncontrollable. He held his breath, not to contain the smoke in his lungs, but because terror had paralyzed the muscles in his chest. He dropped the little notebook in which he wrote his thoughts daily and clutched at his penis, a habitual gesture in moments of panic. The hand holding the roach drifted, automatically, over the hollowed-out copy of Sinclair Lewis’s It Can’t Happen Here, which lay beside him on the bed, and he dropped the half-inch twist of paper and marijuana on top of the plastic Baggie full of green grains. Instantly a brown smoldering dime-sized hole opened up on the bag, and the pot near the coal started to smoke.\n\n“Stupid,” said George, as his thumb stabbed the smoking coal to crush it, and he drew back his lips in a grimace of pain.\n\nA short fat man walked into the room, Law Officer written in every mean line of his crafty little face. George shrank back and started to close It Can’t Happen Here; like lightning, three stiff, concrete-hard fingers drove into his forearm. He screamed and the book jumped out of his hand, spilling pot all over the bedspread.\n\n“Don’t touch that,” said the fat man. “An officer will be in to gather it up for evidence. I went easy with that karate punch. Otherwise you’d be nursing a compound fracture of the left arm in Mad Dog County Jail tonight, and no right-thinking doctor likely to have a mind to come out and treat you.”\n\n“You got a warrant?” George tried to sound defiant.\n\n“Oh, you think you have cojones.” The fat man’s breath stank of bourbon and cheap cigars. “Rabbit cojones. I have terrified you unto death, boy, and you know it and I know it, yet you find it in your heart to speak of warrants. Next you’ll want to see the American Civil Liberties Union.” He pulled aside the jacket of an irridescent gray summer suit that might have been new when Heartbreak Hotel was the top of the hit parade. A silver five-pointed star decorated his pink shirt pocket and a .45 automatic stuck in his pants-top dented the fat of his belly. “That is all the law I need when dealing with your type in Mad Dog. Walk careful with me, son, or you won’t have nothing to grab onto next time one of us pigs, as you choose to call us in your little articles, busts in on you. Which is not likely to happen in the next forty years, while you rot and grow old in our state prison.” He seemed immensely pleased with his own oratorical style, like one of Faulkner’s characters. George thought:\n\nHe said, “You can’t hit me with forty years for possession. And grass is legal in most other states. This law is archaic and absurd.”\n\n“Shit and onions, boy, you got too much of the killer weed there to call it mere possession. I call it possession with intent to sell. And the laws of this state are stern, and they are just and they are our laws. We know what that weed can do. We remember the Alamo and Santa Anna’s troops losing all fear because they were high on Rosa Maria, as they called it in those days. Get on your feet. And don’t ask to talk to a lawyer, neither.”\n\n“Can I ask who you are?”\n\n“I am Sheriff Jim Cartwright, nemesis of all evil in Mad Dog and Mad Dog County.”\n\n“And I’m Tiny Tim,” said George, immediately saying to himself, Shut the fuck up, you’re too goddamn high. And he went right on and said, “Maybe your side would have won if Davy Crockett and Jim Bowie got stoned, too. And, by the way, Sheriff, how did you know you could catch me with pot? Usually an underground journalist would make it a point to be clean when he comes into this godforsaken part of the country. It wasn’t telepathy that told you I had pot on me.”\n\nSheriff Cartwright slapped his thigh. “Oh, but it was. It was telepathy. Now just what made you think it wasn’t telepathy brung me here?” He laughed, seized George’s arm in a grip of iron, and pushed him toward the hotel-room door. George felt a bottomless terror as if the pit of hell were opening beneath his feet and Sheriff Jim Cartwright were about to pitchfork him into the bubbling sulfur. And I must admit that was more or less the case; there are periods of history when the visions of madmen and dope fiends are a better guide to reality than the common-sense interpretation of data available to the so-called normal mind. This is one such period, if you haven’t noticed already.\n\n(“Keep on hanging out with those wild boys from Passaic and you’ll end up in jail,” George’s mother said. “You mark my words, George.” And, another time, at Columbia, after a very late meeting, Mark Rudd said so berly, “A lot of us are going to spend some time in the Man’s jails before this shit-storm is over;” and George, together with the others, nodded glumly but bravely. The marijuana he had been smoking was raised in Cuernavaca by a farmer named Arturo Jesus Maria Ybarra y Mendez, who had sold it in bulk to a young Yanqui named Jim Riley, the son of a Dayton, Ohio, police officer, who in turn smuggled it through Mad Dog after paying a suitable bribe to Sheriff Jim Cartwright. After that it was resold to a Times Square dealer called Rosetta the Stoned and a Miss Walsh from Confrontation’s research department bought ten ounces from her, later reselling five ounces to George, who then carried it back to Mad Dog without any suspicion that he was virtually completing a cycle, The original seed was part of that strain recommended by General George Washington in the famous letter to Sir John Sinclair in which he writes, “I find that, for all purposes, the Indian hemp is in every way superior to the New Zealand variety previously cultivated here.” In New York, Rebecca Goodman, deciding that Saul will not be home tonight, slips out of bed, dons a robe and begins to browse through her library. Finally she selects a hook on Babylonian mythology and begins to read: “Before all of the gods, was Mummu, the spirit of Pure Chaos….” In Chicago, Simon and Mary Lou Servix sit naked on her bed, legs intertwined in the yabyum lotus position. “No,” Simon is saying, “You don’t move, baby; you wait for it to move you.” Clark Kent and His Supermen swing into a reprise: “We’re gonna rock around the clock tonight … We’re gonna rock rock rock till broad day light.”)\n\nGeorge’s cellmate in Mad Dog County Jail had a skull-like face with large, protruding front teeth. He was about six and a half feet tall and lay curled up on his cell bunk like a coiled python.\n\n“Have you asked for treatment?” George asked him.\n\n“Treatment for what?”\n\n“Well, if you think you’re an assassin—”\n\n“I don’t think, baby brother. I’ve killed four white men and two niggers. One in California, the rest down here. Got paid for every one of them.”\n\n“Is that what you’re in for?” My God, they don’t stick murderers in the same cell with potheads, do they?\n\n“I’m in for vagrancy,” said the man scornfully. “Actually, I’m just here for safekeeping, till they give me my orders. Then it’s good-bye to whoever—President, civil rights leader, enemy of the people. Someday I’ll be famous. I’m gonna write a book about myself someday, Ace. Course, I’m no good at writing. Look, maybe we can do a deal. I’ll have Sheriff Jim bring you some writing paper if you’ll write about my life. They gonna keep you here forever, you know. I’ll come and visit you between assassinations, and you’ll write the book, and Sheriff Jim’ll keep it safe till I retire. Then you have the book published and you’ll make a lot of money and be real comfortable in jail. Or maybe you can even hire a lawyer to get you out.”\n\n“Where will you be?” said George. He was still scared, but he was feeling sleepy, too, and he was deciding that this was all bullshit, which had a calming effect on his nerves. But he’d better not go to sleep in the cell while this guy was awake. He didn’t really believe this assassin talk, but it was safe to assume that anybody you met in prison was homosexual.\n\nAs if reading his mind, his cellmate said, “How’d you like to let a famous assassin shove it up to you? How would that be, huh, Ace?”\n\n“Please,” said George. “That’s not my bag, you know? I really couldn’t do it.”\n\n“Shit, piss, and corruption,” said the assassin. He suddenly uncoiled and slid off the bunk. “I been wasting my time with you. Now bend the hell over and drop your pants. You are getting it, and there ain’t no further way about it.” He stepped toward George, fists clenched.\n\n“Guard! Guard!” George yelled. He grabbed the cell door in both hands and began rattling it frantically.\n\nThe man caught George a cuff across the face. Another blow to the jaw knocked George against the wall.\n\n“Guard!” he screamed, his head spinning with pot and panic.\n\nA man in a blue uniform came through the door at the end of the corridor. He seemed miles away and vastly disinterested, like a god who had grown bored with his creations.\n\n“Now, what the hell is all this yelling about in here?” he asked, his hand on the butt of his revolver, his voice still miles away.\n\nGeorge opened his mouth, but his cellmate spoke first. “This little long-haired communist freak won’t drop his pants when I tell him. Ain’t you supposed to make sure I’m happy in here?” The voice shifted to a whine. “Make him do what I say.”\n\n“You’ve got to protect me,” said George. “You’ve got to get me out of this cell.”\n\nThe god-guard laughed. “Well, now, you might say this is a very enlightened prison we have here. You come down from New York and you probably think we’re pretty backward. But we ain’t. We got no police brutality. Now, if I interfered between you and Harry Coin here, I might have to use force to keep him away from your young ass. I know you people believe all cops ought to be abolished. Well, in this here situation I hereby abolish myself. Furthermore, I know you people believe in sexual freedom, and I do, too. So Harry Coin gonna have his sexual freedom without any interference or brutality from me.” His voice was still distant and disinterested, almost dreamy.\n\n“No,” said George.\n\nThe guard drew his pistol. “Now, sonny. You take down your pants and bend over. You are gonna get it up the ass from Harry Coin here, and no two ways about it. And I am gonna watch and see that you let him do it right. Otherwise, you get no forty years. You get killed, right now. I put a bullet in you and I say you are resisting arrest. Now make up your mind what it’s gonna be. I really will kill you if you don’t do like he tells you to. I really will. You are totally expendable and he ain’t. He’s a very important man, and it’s my job to keep him happy.”\n\n“And I’ll fuck you either way, dead or alive,” the demented Coin laughed, like an evil spirit. “So there’s no way you can escape it, Ace.”\n\nThe door at the end of the corridor clanged, and Sheriff Jim Cartwright and two blue-uniformed policemen strode down to the cell. “What’s going on here?” said the Sheriff.\n\n“I caught this queer punk George Dorn here trying to commit homosexual rape on Harry,” said the guard. “Had to draw my pistol to stop him.”\n\nGeorge shook his head. “You guys are unbelievable. If you’re acting out this little game for my benefit, you can quit now, because you’re certainly not fooling each other, and you’re not fooling me.”\n\n“Dorn,” said the Sheriff, “you’ve been attempting unnatural acts in my jail, acts forbidden by the Holy Bible and the laws of this state. I don’t like that. I don’t like it one little bit. Come on out here. I wanna have a little talk with you. We goin’ to the main interrogation room for some speakin’ together.”\n\nHe unlocked the cell door and motioned George to precede him. He turned to the two policemen who had accompanied him. “Stay behind and take care of that other little matter.” The last words were strangely emphasized.\n\nGeorge and the Sheriff walked through a series of corridors and locked doors until at last they came to a room whose walls were made of embossed sheet tin painted bottle-green. The Sheriff told George to sit on one chair, while he straddled the back of the chair facing him.\n\n“You’re a bad influence on my prisoners,” he said. “I got a good mind to see that some kind of accident happens to you. I don’t want to see you corrupting prisoners in my jail—mine or anyone’s—for forty years.”\n\n“Sheriff,” said George. “What do you want from me? You got me on a pot charge. What more do you want? Why did you stick me in that cell with that guy? What’s all this scare stuff and threats and questioning for?”\n\n“I wanna know some things,” said the Sheriff. “I want to find out everything you can tell me about certain matters. So, from this moment be prepared to tell me only the truth. If you do, maybe things will go easier on you, after.”\n\n“Yes, Sheriff,” said George. Cartwright squinted at him. He really does look like a pig, thought George. Most do. Why do so many of them get so fat and have such little eyes?\n\n“Well, then,” said the Sheriff. “What was your purpose in coming down here from New York?”\n\n“I’m simply on an assignment from Confrontation, the magazine—”\n\n“I know it. It is a smutty magazine, and a communist magazine. I have read it.”\n\n“You’re using loaded words. It’s a left-wing libertarian magazine, to be exact.”\n\n“My pistol is loaded, too, boy. So talk straight. All right. Tell me what you came down here to write about.”\n\n“Sure. You ought to be as interested in this as I am, if you’re really interested in law and order. There have been rumors circulating throughout the country for more than a decade now that all the major political assassinations in America—Malcolm X, the Kennedy brothers, Medgar Evers, King, Nixon, maybe even George Lincoln Rockwell—are the work of a single, conspiratorial, violence-oriented right-wing organization, and that this organization has its base right here in Mad Dog. I came down to see what I could find out about this group.”\n\n“That’s what I figured,” said the Sheriff. “You poor, sad little turd. You come down here with your long hair and you expect to get, as you put it, a line on a right-wing organization. Why, it’s lucky for you you didn’t meet any of our real right-wingers, like God’s Lightning for instance. The ones around here would have tortured you to death by this time, boy. You really are dumb. OK, I’m not gonna waste any more of my time with you. Come on, I’ll take you back to your cell. You might as well get used to looking at the moon through bars.”\n\nThey walked back the same way they had come. At the entrance to the corridor where George’s cell was, the Sheriff opened the door and yelled, “Come and get him, Charley.”\n\nGeorge’s guard, his face pale and his mouth set in a lipless line, took George by the arm. The corridor door clanged shut behind the Sheriff. Charley took George to his cell and pushed him in wordlessly. But at least he was three-dimensional now and less like a marijuana phantom.\n\nHarry Coin wasn’t there. The cell was empty. George became aware of a shadow in the corner of his vision. Something in the cell next to him. He turned: His heart stopped. There was a man hanging from a pipe on the ceiling. George went over and stared through the bars. The body was swaying slightly. It was attached to the pipe by a leather belt which was buckled around the neck. The face, with the staring eyes, was that of Harry Coin. George’s glance went lower. Something was coming out of Harry Coin’s midsection and was dangling down to the floor. It wasn’t suicide. They had disemboweled Harry Coin, and someone had thoughtfully moved a shit-can under him for his bloody intestines to dangle into.\n\nGeorge screamed. There was no one around to answer him. The guard had vanished like Hermes.\n\n(But in Cherry Knolls mental hospital in Sunderland, England, where it was already eleven the following morning, a schizophrenic patient who hadn’t spoken in ten years abruptly began exhorting a ward attendant: “They’re all coming back—Hitler, Goering, Streicher, the whole lot of them. And, behind them, the powers and persons from the other spheres who control them….” But Simon Moon in Chicago still calmly and placidly retains the lotus position and instructs Mary Lou sitting in his lap: “Just hold it, hold it with your vaginal wall like you’d hold it with your hand, gently, and feel its warmth, but don’t think about orgasm, don’t think about the future, not even a minute ahead, think about the now, the only now, the only now, the only now that we’ll ever have, just my penis in your vagina now and the simple pleasure of it, not a greater pleasure to work toward….” “My back hurts,” Mary Lou said.)\n\nWE’RE GONNA ROCK ROCK ROCK AROUND THE CLOCK TO NIGHT\n\nThere are Swedish and Norwegian kids, Danes, Italian and French kids, Greeks, even Americans. George and Hagbard move through the crowd trying to estimate its number—200,000? 300,000? 500,000? Peace symbols dangling about every neck, nudes with body paint, nudes without body paint, long and dangling hair on boys and girls alike, and over all of it the hypnotic and unending beat. “Woodstock Europa,” Hagbard says drily. “The last and final Walpurgisnacht and Adam Weishaupt’s Erotion finally realized.”\n\nWE’RE GONNA ROCK ROCK ROCK TILL BROAD DAYLIGHT\n\n“It’s a League of Nations,” George says, “a young people’s League of Nations.” Hagbard isn’t listening. “Up there,” he points, “to the Northwest is the Rhine, where die Lorelei was supposed to sit and sing her deadly songs. There will be deadlier music on the Danube tonight.”\n\nWE’RE GONNA ROCK AROUND THE CLOCK TONIGHT\n\n(But that was still seven days in the future, and now George lies unconscious in Mad Dog County Jail. And it began—that phase of the operation, as Hagbard called it—over thirty years before when a Swiss chemist named Hoffman climbed on his bicycle and pedaled down a country road into new dimensions.)\n\n“And will they all come back?” George asked.\n\n“All of them,” Hagbard answered tightly “When the beat reaches the proper intensity … unless we can stop it.”\n\n(“Now I’m getting it,” Mary Lou cried. “It’s not what I expected. It’s different from sex, and better.” Simon smiled benignly. “It is sex, baby,” he said. “What you’ve had before wasn’t sex. Now we can start moving … but slowly … the Gentle Way … the Way of Tao….” They’re all coming back; they never died—the lunatic raved at the startled attendant—You wait, guvnor. You just wait. You’ll see it)\n\nThe amplifiers squealed suddenly. There was too much feedback, and the sound went off into a pitch beyond endurance. George winced, and saw others hold their ears rock, rock, rock, around the clock. The key missed the lock, turned and cut Muldoon’s hand. “Nerves,” he said to Saul. “I always feel like a burglar when I do this.”\n\nSaul grunted. “Forget burglary,” he said. “We might be hanged for treason before this is over. If we don’t become national heroes.”\n\n“A fanfuckingtastic case,” Muldoon grinned. He tried another way.\n\nThey were in an old brownstone on Riverside Drive, trying to break into the apartment of Joseph Malik. And they were not merely looking for evidence, both tacitly admitted—they were hiding from the FBI.\n\nThe call had come from headquarters just as they were finishing the questioning of associate editor Peter Jackson. Muldoon had gone out to his car to take it, while Saul finished getting a full physical description of both Malik and George Dorn. Jackson had just left and Saul was picking up the fifth memo, when Muldoon returned, looking as if his doctor had just told him his Wasserman was positive.\n\n“Two special agents from the FBI are coming over to help us,” he said woodenly.\n\n“Still ready to play a hunch?” Saul asked calmly, pushing all the memos back in the metal box.\n\nMuldoon merely called Pricefixer back into the cafeteria and told him, “Two feds will be here in a few minutes. Tell them we went back to headquarters. Answer any question they ask, but don’t tell them about this box.”\n\nPricefixer looked at the two older officers carefully and then said to Muldoon, “You’re the boss.”\n\nHe’s either awfully dumb and trusting, Saul had thought, or he’s so damned smart he’s going to be dangerous someday.\n\n“Now,” he asked Muldoon nervously, “is that the last key?”\n\n“No, I’ve got five more beauties here and one of them will—here it is!” The door opened smoothly.\n\nSaul’s hand drifted toward his revolver as he stepped into the apartment and felt for a light switch. Nobody was revealed when the light came on, and Saul relaxed. “You look around for the dogs.” he said. “I want to sit down and go over the rest of these memos.”\n\nThe room was used for work as well as living and was untidy enough to leave no room for doubt that Malik had been a bachelor. Saul pushed the typewriter back on the writing desk, set down the memo box and then noticed something odd. The whole wall, on this side of the room, was covered with pictures of George Washington. Standing to examine them more closely, he saw that each had a label—half of them saying “G.W.” and the others, “A.W.”\n\nOdd—but the whole case had overtones that smelled as fishy as those dead Egyptian mouth-breeders.\n\nSaul sat down and took a memo from the box.\n\nMuldoon came back into the living room and said, “No dogs. Not a goddam dog anywhere in the whole apartment.”\n\n“That’s interesting,” Saul remarked thoughtfully. “You say the landlord had complaints from several other tenants about the dogs?”\n\n“He said everybody in the building wag complaining. The rule is no pets and he enforced it. People wanted to know why they had to get rid of their kittens when Malik could have a whole pack of dogs up here. They said there must have been ten or twelve from the noise they made.”\n\n“He sure must love those animals, if he took them all with him when he went into hiding,” Saul mused. The pole vaulter in his unconscious was jumping again. “Let’s look in the kitchen,” he suggested mildly.\n\nBarney followed as Saul methodically ransacked the refrigerator and cupboards, finishing up with a careful examination of the garbage.\n\n“No dog food,” Saul said finally.\n\n“I noticed.”\n\n“And no dog dishes either. And no empty dog-food tins in the garbage.”\n\n“What wild notion are you following now?”\n\n“I don’t know,” Saul said thoughtfully. “He doesn’t mind the neighbors hearing the dogs—probably he’s the kind of left-wing individualist who likes nothing better than quarreling with his landlord and the other tenants about some issue like the no-pets rule. So he wasn’t hiding anything until he ducked out. And then he not only took the dogs but hid all evidence that they’d ever been here. Even though he must have known that the neighbors would all talk about them.”\n\n“Maybe he was feeding them human flesh,” Muldoon suggested ghoulishly.\n\n“Lord, I don’t know. You look around for anything of interest. I’m going to read those Illuminati memos.” Saul returned to the living room and began:\n\nILLUMINATI PROJECT: MEMO #5\n\n7/26\n\nJ.M.:\n\nSometimes you find things in the damndest places. The following is from a girl’s magazine (“The Conspiracy” by Sandra Glass, Teenset, March 1969, pages 34–40).\n\nSimon proceeded to tell me about the Bavarian Illuminati. The nightmarish story begins in 1090 a.d. in the Middle East when Hassan i Sabbah founded the Ismaelian Sect, or Hashishim, so called because of their use of hashish, a deadly drug derived from the hemp plant which is better known as the killer weed marijuana…. The cult terrorized the Moslem world until Genghis Khan’s Mongols brought law and order to the area. Cornered in their mountain hideaway, the Hashishim dope fiends proved no match for the clean-living Mongol warriors, their fortress was destroyed, and their dancing girls shipped to Mongolia for rehabilitation. The heads of the cult fled westward….\n\n“The Illuminati surfaced next in Bavaria in 1776,” Simon told me…. “Adam Weishaupt, a student of the occult, studied the teachings of Hassan i Sabbah and grew hemp in his backyard. On February 2, 1776, Weishaupt achieved illumination. Weishaupt officially founded the Ancient Illuminated Seers of Bavaria on May 1st, 1776. Their slogan was ‘Ewige Blumenkraft.’ … They attracted many illustrious members such as Goethe and Beethoven. Beethoven tacked up an Ewige Blumenkraft poster on the top of the piano on which he composed all nine of his symphonies.”\n\nThe last paragraph of the article is, however, the most interesting of all:\n\nRecently I saw a documentary film on the Democratic Convention of 1968, and I was struck by the scene in which Senator Abraham Ribicoff made a critical remark provoking the anger of the Mayor of Chicago. In the ensuing tumult it was impossible to hear the Mayor’s shouted retort, and there has been much speculation about what he actually said. To me it seemed his lips were forming the words that by this time become frighteningly familiar: “Ewige Blumenkraft!”\n\nThe further I dig, the wilder the whole picture looks. When are we going to tell George about it?\n\nPat\n\nILLUMINATI PROJECT: MEMO #6\n\n7/26\n\nJ.M.:\n\nThe John Birch Society has looked into the subject and they have a theory of their own. The first source I’ve found on this is a pamphlet “CFR: Conspiracy to Rule the World” by Gary Allen, associate editor of the Birchers’ magazine, American Opinion.\n\nAllen’s thesis is that Cecil Rhodes created a secret society to establish English domination of the world in 1888. This society acts through Oxford University, the Rhodes Scholarships and—hold your breath—the Council on Foreign Relations, a nonprofit foundation for the study of International Affairs headquartered right here on Sixty-eighth Street in New York. Seven out of nine of our last Secretaries of State were recruited from the CFR, Allen points out, and dozens of other leading politicians as well—including Richard Nixon. It is also implied, but not directly stated, that William Buckley, Jr. (an old enemy of the Birchers) is another tool of the CFR; and the Morgan and Rothschild banking interests are supposed to be financing the whole thing.\n\nHow does this tie in with the Illuminati? Mr. Allen merely drops hints, linking Rhodes to John Ruskin, and Ruskin to earlier internationalists, and finally stating that “the originator on the profane level of this type of secret society” was Adam Weishaupt, whom he calls “the monster who founded the Order of the Illuminati on May 1, 1776.”\n\nPat\n\nILLUMINATI PROJECT: MEMO #7\n\n7/27\n\nJ.M.:\n\nThis is from a small left-wing newspaper in Chicago (The Roger SPARK Chicago, July 1969, Vol. 2, No. 9: “Daley Linked With Illuminati,” no author’s name given):\n\nNo historian knows what happened to Adam Weishaupt after he was exiled from Bavaria in 1785, and entries in “Washington’s” diary after that date frequently refer to the hemp crop at Mount Vernon.\n\nThe possibility that Adam Weishaupt killed George Washington and took his place, serving as our first President for two terms, is now confirmed…. The two main colors of the American flag are, excluding a small patch of blue in one corner, red and white: these are also the official colors of the Hashishim. The flag and the Illuminati pyramid both have thirteen horizontal divisions: thirteen is, of course, the traditional code for marijuana … and is still used in that sense by Hell’s Angels among others.\n\nNow, “Washington” formed the Federalist party. The other major party in those days, The Democratic Republicans, was formed by Thomas Jefferson [and] there are grounds for accepting the testimony of the Reverend Jedediah Morse of Charleston, who accused Jefferson of being an Illuminati agent. Thus, even at the dawn of our government, both parties were Illuminati fronts….\n\nThis story later repeats the Teenset report that Mayor Daley used the phrase “Ewige Blumenkraft” during his incoherent diatribe against Abe Ribicoff.\n\nPat\n\nILLUMINATI PROJECT: MEMO #8\n\n7/27\n\nJ.M.:\n\nMore on the Washington-Weishaupt theory:\n\nIn spite of the fact that his face appears on billions of stamps and dollar bills, and his portrait hangs in every public building in the country, no one is quite sure what Washington looks like. A “Project 20” script, “Meet George Washington” will be seen tonight at 7:30 on Channel (fill in by local stations). The program offers contemporary portraits of the first President, some of which do not even seem to be the same man.\n\nThis is a press release sent out by NBC on April 24, 1969. Some of the portraits can be found in Encyclopedia Britannica and the resemblance to portraits of Weishaupt is undeniable.\n\nIncidentally, Barbara called my attention to this: the letter in Playboy asking about the Illuminati was signed “R.S., Kansas City, Missouri.” According to the Kansas City newspapers, a Robert Stanton of that city was found dead on March 17, 1969 (about a week after the April Playboy appeared on the newsstands) with his throat torn as if by the talons of some enormous beast. No animal was reported missing from any of the local zoos.\n\nPat\n\nSaul looked up at the pictures of Washington on the wall. For the first time, he noticed the strange half-smile on the most famous of them all, the one by Gilbert Stuart that appears on one-dollar bills. “As if by the talons of some enormous beast,” he quoted to himself, thinking again of Malik’s disappearing dogs.\n\n“What the hell are you grinning about?” he asked sourly.\n\nCongressman Koch, he remembered suddenly, in a speech years and years ago when marijuana was illegal everywhere, said something about Washington’s hemp crop. What was it? Yes: it was about the entries in the General’s diary—they showed that he separated the female hemp plants from the males before fertilization. That was botanically unnecessary if he was growing the crop for rope, but it was standard practise in cultivating hemp for marijuana, Koch pointed out.\n\nAnd “illumination” was one of the words hippies were always using to describe the experience one obtains from the highest grade of grass. Even the more common term, “turning on,” had the same meaning as “illumination,” when you stopped to think about. Wasn’t that what the crown of light around Jesus’ head in Catholic art was supposed to mean? And Goethe—if he was really part of this—might have been referring to the experience in his last words, as he lay dying: “More light!”\n\nI should have become a rabbi, like my father wanted, Saul thought bemusedly. Police work is getting to be too much for me.\n\nIn a few minutes I’ll be suspecting Thomas Edison.\n\nROCK ROCK ROCK TILL BROAD DAYLIGHT\n\nSlowly, Mary Lou Servix swam back to consciousness, like a shipwreck victim reaching a raft.\n\n“Good Lord,” she breathed softly.\n\nSimon kissed her neck. “Now you know,” he whispered.\n\n“Good Lord,” she repeated. “How many times did I come?”\n\nSimon smiled. “I’m not an anal-compulsive type—I wasn’t counting. Ten or twelve, something like that, I guess.”\n\n“Good Lord. And the hallucinations. Was that what you were doing to my nervous system, or was it the grass?”\n\n“Just tell me about what you saw.”\n\n“Well, you got a halo around you, sort of. A big blue halo. And then I saw that it was around me, too, and that it had all sorts of little blue dots dancing in sort of whorls inside it. And then there wasn’t even that anymore. Just light. Pure white light.”\n\n“Suppose I told you I have a friend who’s a dolphin and he exists in that kind of limitless light all the time.”\n\n“Oh, don’t start jiving me. You’ve been so nice, until now.”\n\n“I’m not jiving you. His name is Howard. I might arrange for you to meet him.”\n\n“A fish?”\n\n“No, baby. A dolphin is a mammal. Just like you and me.”\n\n“You are either the world’s greatest brain or the world’s craziest motherfucker, Mr. Simon Moon. I mean it. But that light … My God, I will never forget that light.”\n\n“And what happened to your body?” Simon asked casually.\n\n“You know, I didn’t know where it was. Even in the middle of my orgasms I didn’t know where my body was. Everything was just … the light….”\n\nROCK ROCK ROCK AROUND THE CLOCK TONIGHT\n\nAnd leaving Dallas that much-discussed November 22 afternoon in 1963, the man using the name “Frank Sullivan” brushes past McCord and Barker at the airport, but no foreshadowing of Watergate darkens his mind. (Back at the Grassy Knoll, Howard Hunt’s picture is being snapped and will later turn up in the files of New Orleans D.A. Jim “The Jolly Green Giant” Garrison: not that Garrison ever came within light years of the real truth….)\n\n“Here, kitty-kitty-kitty” Hagbard calls.\n\nBut now we are going back, again, to April 2 and Las Vegas; Sherri Brandi (nee Sharon O’Farrell) arriving home finds Carmel in her living room at four in the morning. It doesn’t surprise her; he often made these unexpected visits. He seems to enjoy invading other people’s territory like some kinda creepy virus. “Darling,” I cried, rushing to kiss him as he expected. I wish the creep would drop dead, I thought as our mouths met.\n\n“An all-night john?” he asked casually.\n\n“Yeah. One of those scientists who works at that place out in the desert we’re all supposed to pretend we don’t know about. A freak.”\n\n“He wanted something special?” Carmel asked quickly. “You charged him extra?” At times I thought I could really see dollar signs in his eyes.\n\n“No,” I said, “he just wanted a lay. But afterward he wouldn’t let me go. Just kept jawing.” I yawned, looking around at the nice furniture and the nice paintings; I had managed to get everything in shades of pink and lavender, really beautiful, if that creep hadn’t been sitting there on the couch looking like a hungry dead rat. I always wanted pretty things and I think I could have been some kind of artist or designer if all my luck wasn’t always lousy. Christ, who ever told Carmel a blue turtleneck would go with a brown suit? If it wasn’t for women, in my honest-to-Pete opinion, men would all go around looking like that. That’s what I think. Insensitive. A bunch of cavemen, or Meander Thralls, or whatever you call them. “This john had a lot on his mind,” I said before old candy-bar could start crossexamining me about something else. “He’s against fluorides in drinking water and the Catholic church and faggots and he thinks the new birth-control pill is as bad as the old one and I should use a diaphragm instead. Christ, he’s got the inside dope on everything under the sun, he thinks, and I hadda listen to it all. That kind of john.”\n\nCarmel nodded. “Scientists are schmucks,” he said.\n\nI pulled the dress over my head and hung it in the closet (it was the nice green one with the spangles and the new style where my nipples stick out through little holes, which is a pain in the ass because they’re always rubbing against something and getting raw, but it really turns on the Johns, and, like I always say, that’s the name of the game, in this sonofabitching town with all the lousy luck, the only way to heavy scratch is go out there, girl, and sell your snatch) and then I grabbed my robe quick before old blow-job bobo decided it was time for his weekly Frenching. “He’s got a nice house, though,” I said to distract the creep. “He doesn’t have to live out there on the base, he’s too important for rules and regularities. Nice to look at, I mean. Redwood walls and burnt orange decor, you know? Pretty. He hates it, though. Acts as if he thinks it’s haunted by Count Frankenstein or somebody. Keeps jumping up and walking around like he’s looking for something. Something that’ll bite his head off in one gulp if he finds it.” I decided to let the top of the robe hang open a little. Carmel was either horny or he wanted something else, and something else with him generally means he thinks you’ve been holding back some cash. Him and his damned belt. Of course, sometimes with that I go queer all over for a flash and I guess that’s like the come that men have, the orgasm, but it ain’t worth the pain, believe me. I wonder if it’s true some women get it in intercourse? Really get it? I don’t think so. I’ve never known anybody in the business who gets it, from a man, only from Rosy Palm and her five sisters, sometimes, and if none of us do, how could some straight nicey-nicey get it?\n\n“Bugs,” Carmel said, looking shrewd and clever, off on his usual shtick of proving he was more hip to everything than anybody else on God’s green earth. I didn’t know what the hell he was talking about.\n\n“What do you mean, bugs?” I asked. It was better than talking about money.\n\n“The john,” he said with a know-it-all grin. “He’s important, you said. So his house has bugs. He probably keeps taking them out, and the FBI keeps coming back and putting in new ones. I bet he was very quiet when he was making it with you, right?” I nodded, remembering. “See. He couldn’t stand the thought of those Feds eavesdropping on the other end of the wire. Just like Mai—like a guy I know in the Syndicate. He’s so afraid of bugs he won’t hold a business talk anywhere but the bathroom in his hotel suite with all four faucets going full blast and both of us whispering. Running water screws up a bug more than playing loud music on the radio, for some scientific reason.”\n\n“Bugs,” I said suddenly. “That’s it.” The other kind of bugs. I was remembering Charley raving about fluoridation: “And we’re all classified as mental cases, because a few right-wing nuts fifteen or twenty years ago who said fluoridation was a communist plot to poison us. Now, anybody who criticizes fluoridation is supposed to be just as bananas as God’s Lightning. Good Lord, if anybody wants to do us in without firing a shot, I could—” and he caught himself, hid something that almost showed on his face, and ended like his brain was walking on one foot, “I could point to a dozen things in any chemistry book more effective than fluoride.” But he wasn’t thinking of chemicals, he was thinking of those little bugs, microbes is the word, and that’s what he was working on. I could feel that flash I always get when I read something in a John, like if he had more money than he let on, or he’d caught his wife spreading for the milkman and was doing it to get even, or he was really a faggola and was just proving to himself that he wasn’t completely a faggola. “My God,” I said, “Carmel, I read about those microbe bugs in the Enquirer. If they have an accident out there, this whole town goes, and the state with it, and God knows how many other states. Jesus, no wonder he keeps washing his hands!”\n\n“Germ warfare?” Carmel said, thinking fast. “God, I’ll bet this town is crawling with Russian spies trying to find out what’s going on out there. And I’ve got a direct lead for them. But how the hell do you meet a Russian spy, or a Chinese spy for that matter? You can’t just advertise in a newspaper. Hell. Maybe if I went down to the university and talked to some of those freaking commie students….”\n\nI was shocked. “Carmel! You can’t sell your own country like that!”\n\n“The hell I can’t. The Statue of Liberty is just another broad, and I’ll take what I can get for her. Don’t be a fool.” He reached in his jacket pocket and took out a caramel candy like he always did when he was excited. “I’ll—bet somebody in the Mob will know. They know everything. Jesus, there has to be some way of cashing in on this.”\n\nThe President’s actual television broadcast was transmitted to the world at 10:30 p.m. EST, March 31. The Russians and Chinese were given twenty-four hours to get out of Fernando Poo or the skies over Santa Isobel would begin raining nuclear missiles: “This is darn serious,” the Chief Executive said, “and America will not shirk its responsibility to the freedom-loving people of Fernando Poo!” The broadcast concluded at 11 p.m. EST, and within two minutes people attempting to get reservations on trains, planes, busses or car pools to Canada had virtually every telephone wire in the country overloaded.\n\nIn Moscow, where it was ten the next morning, the Premier called a conference and said crisply, “That character in Washington is a mental lunatic, and he means it. Get our men out of Fernando Poo right away, then find out who authorized sending them in there in the first place and transfer him to be supervisor of a hydroelectric works in Outer Mongolia.”\n\n“We don’t have any men in Fernando Poo,” a commissar said mournfully. “The Americans are imagining things again.”\n\n“Well, how the hell can we withdraw men if we don’t have them there in the first place?” the Premier demanded.\n\n“I don’t know. We’ve got twenty-four hours to figure that out, or—” the commissar quoted an old Russian proverb which means, roughly, that when the polar bear excrement interferes with the fan belts, the machinery overheats.\n\n“Suppose we just announce that our troops are coming out?” another commissar suggested. “They can’t say we’re lying if they don’t find any of our troops there afterward.”\n\n“No, they never believe anything we say. They want to be shown,” the premier said thoughtfully. “We’ll have to infiltrate some troops surreptitiously and then withdraw them with a lot of fanfare and publicity. That should do it.”\n\n“I’m afraid it won’t end the problem,” another commissar said funereally. “Our intelligence indicates that there are Chinese troops there. Unless Peking backs down, we’re going to be caught in the middle when the bombs start flying and—” he quoted a proverb about the man in the intersection when two manure trucks collide.\n\n“Damn,” the Premier said. “What the blue blazes do the Chinese want with Fernando Poo?”\n\nHe was harassed, but still he spoke with authority. He was, in fact, characteristic of the best type of dominant male in the world at this time. He was fifty-five years old, tough, shrewd, unburdened by the complicated ethical ambiguities which puzzle intellectuals, and had long ago decided that the world was a mean son-of-a-bitch in which only the most cunning and ruthless can survive. He was also as kind as was possible for one holding that ultra-Darwinian philosophy; and he genuinely loved children and dogs, unless they were on the site of something that had to be bombed in the National Interest. He still retained some sense of humor, despite the burdens of his almost godly office, and although he had been impotent with his wife for nearly ten years now, he generally achieved orgasm in the mouth of a skilled prostitute within 1.5 minutes. He took amphetamine pep pills to keep going on his grueling twenty-hour day, with the result that his vision of the world was somewhat skewed in a paranoid direction, and he took tranquilizers to keep from worrying too much, with the result that his detachment sometimes bordered on schizophrenia; but most of the time his innate shrewdness gave him a fingernail grip on reality. In short, he was much like the rulers of America and China.\n\nAnd, banishing Thomas Edison and his light bulbs from mind, Saul Goodman looks back over the first eight memos briefly, using the conservative and logical side of his personality, rigidly holding back the intuitive functions. It was a habitual exercise with him, and he called it expansion-and-contraction: leaping in the dark for the connection that must exist between fact one and fact two, then going back slowly to check on himself.\n\nThe names and phrases flow past, in review: Fra Dolcino—1508—Roshinaya—Hassan i Sabbah—1090—Weishaupt—assassinations—John Kennedy, Bobby Kennedy, Martin Luther King—Mayor Daley—Cecil Rhodes—1888 —George Washington….\n\nChoices: (1) it is all true, exactly as the memos suggest; (2) it is partly true, and partly false; (3) it is all false, and there is no secret society that has endured from 1090 a.d. to the present.\n\nWell, it isn’t all true. Mayor Daley never said “Ewige Blumenkraft” to Senator Ribicoff. Saul had read, in the Washington Post, a lip-reader’s translation of Daley’s diatribe and there was no German in it, although there was obscenity and anti-Semitism. The Weishaupt-Washington impersonation theory also had some flaws—in those days, before plastic surgery, such an undetected assumption of the identity of a well-known figure was especially hard to credit, despite the circumstantial evidence quoted in the memos—two strong arguments against choice one. The memos are not all true.\n\nHow about choice three? The Illuminati might not be a straight unbroken line from the first recruit gathered by old Hassan i Sabbah to the person who bombed Confrontation—it might have died and lain dormant for a term, like the Ku Klux Klan between 1872 and 1915; and it might have gone through such breakups and resurrections more than once in eight centuries—but linkages of some sort, however tenuous, reached from the eleventh century to the twentieth, from the Near East to Europe and from Europe to America. Saul’s dissatisfaction with official explanations of recent assassinations, the impossibility of making any rational sense out of current American foreign policy, and the fact that even historians who vehemently distrusted all “conspiracy theories” acknowledged the pivotal role of secret Masonic lodges in the French Revolution: all these added weight to the rejection of choice 3. Besides, the Masons were the first group, according to at least two of the memos, infiltrated by Weishaupt.\n\nChoice 1 is definitely out, then, and choice 3 almost certainly equally invalid; choice 2, therefore, is most probably correct. The theory in the memos is partly true and partly false. But what, in essence, is the theory—and which part of it is true, which part false?\n\nSaul lit his pipe, closed his eyes, and concentrated.\n\nThe theory, in essence, was that the Illuminati recruited people through various “fronts,” turned them on to some sort of illuminizing experience through marijuana (or some special extract of marijuana) and converted them into fanatics willing to use any means necessary to “illuminize” the rest of the world. Their aim, obviously, is nothing less than the total transformation of humanity itself, along the lines suggested by the film 2001, or by Nietzsche’s concept of the Superman. In the course of this conspiracy the Illuminati, according to Malik’s hints to Jackson, were systematically assassinating every popular political figure who might interfere with their program.\n\nSaul thought, suddenly, of Charlie Manson, and of the glorification of Manson by the Weatherman and Morituri bombers. He thought of the popularity of pot smoking and of the slogan “by any means necessary” with contemporary radical youth, even outside Weatherman. And he thought of Neitzsche’s slogans, “Be hard…. Whatever is done for love is beyond good and evil…. Above the ape is man, and above man, the Superman…. Forget not thy whip….” In spite of his own logic, which had proved that Malik’s theory was only partly true, Saul Goodman, a lifelong liberal, suddenly felt a pang of typically right-wing terror toward modern youth.\n\nHe reminded himself that Malik seemed to think the conspiracy emanated chiefly from Mad Dog—and that was God’s Lightning country down there. God’s Lightning had no fondness for marijuana, or for youth, or for the definitely anti-Christian overtones of the Illuminati philosophy.\n\nBesides, Malik’s sources were only partly trustworthy.\n\nAnd there were other possibilities: the Shriners, for instance, were part of the Masonic movement, were generally right-wing, had their own hidden rites and secrets, and used Arabic trappings that might well derive from Hassan i Sabbah or the Roshinaya of Afghanistan. Who could say what secret plots were hatched at Shriner conventions?\n\nNo, that was the intuitive pole vaulter in the right lobe at work again; and right now Saul was concerned with the plodding logician in the left lobe.\n\nThe key to the mystery was in getting a clearer definition of the purpose of the Illuminati. Identify the change they were trying to accomplish—in man and in his society—and then you would be able to guess, at least approximately, who they were.\n\nTheir aim was English domination of the world, and they were Rhodes Scholars—according to the Birchers. That idea, obviously, belonged with Saul’s own whimsey about a worldwide Shriner conspiracy. What then? The Italian Illuminati, under Fra Dolcino, wanted to redistribute the wealth—but the International Bankers, mentioned in the Playboy letter, presumably wanted to hold onto their wealth. Weishaupt was a “freethinker” according to the Britannica, and so were Washington and Jefferson— but Sabbah and Joachim of Florence were evidently heretical mystics of the Islamic and Catholic traditions respectively.\n\nSaul picked up the ninth memo, deciding to get more facts (or pretended facts) before analyzing further—and then it hit him.\n\nWhatever the Illuminati were aiming at had not been accomplished. Proof: If it had, they would not still be conspiring in secret.\n\nSince almost everything has been tried in the course of human history, find out what hasn’t been tried (at least not on a large scale)—and that will be the condition to which the Illuminati are trying to move the rest of mankind.\n\nCapitalism had been tried. Communism has been tried. Even Henry George’s Single Tax has been tried, in Australia. Fascism, feudalism and mysticism have been tried.\n\nAnarchism has never been tried.\n\nAnarchism was frequently associated with assassinations. It had an appeal for freethinkers, such as Kropotkin and Bakunin, but also for religious idealists, like Tolstoy and Dorothy Day of the Catholic Worker movement. Most anarchists hoped, Joachim-like, to redistribute the wealth, but Rebecca had once told him about a classic of anarchist literature, Max Stirner’s The Ego and His Own, which had been called “the Billionaire’s Bible” because it stressed the advantages the rugged individualist would gain in a stateless society—and Cecil Rhodes was an adventurer before he was a banker. The Illuminati were anarchists.\n\nIt all fit: the pieces of the puzzle slipped together smoothly.\n\nSaul was convinced.\n\nHe was also wrong.\n\n“We’ll just get our troops out of Fernando Too,” the Chairman of the Chinese Communist party said on April 1. “A place that size isn’t worth world war.”\n\n“But we don’t have any troops there,” an aide told him, “it’s the Russians who do.”\n\n“Oh?” the Chairman quoted a proverb to the effect that there was urine in the rosewater. “I wonder what the hell the Russians want with Fernando Poo?” he added thoughtfully.\n\nHe was harassed, but still he spoke with authority. He was, in fact, characteristic of the best type of dominant male in the world at this time. He was fifty-five years old, tough, shrewd, unburdened by the complicated ethical ambiguities which puzzle intellectuals, and had long ago "
