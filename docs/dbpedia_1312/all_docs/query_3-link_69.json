        "text": "Fascinated by what your ancestry tests have revealed? But what if, alongside your results, certain physical traits could add more pieces to your ancestral puzzle? Whether or not Vikings appeared in your DNA report, you might be intrigued to discover which physical signs have historically been associated with these legendary seafarers. Let’s delve into 7 fascinating traits that might hint at a Viking connection somewhere in the vast branches of your family tree.\n\nGenetic ancestry tests are becoming increasingly popular. While your DNA can be used to learn about your roots, did you know that it can also reveal important things about your health risks and wellness aspects? This allows you to take proactive measures for health conditions, even before the symptoms appear, thereby preventing it. You can upload your DNA data to learn 1,500+ things about your health. Learn more.\n\nHere’s how people like you have used their ancestry data to explore Xcode Life\n\nWho Were The Vikings?\n\nThe Vikings were a group of maritime warriors from Scandinavia.\n\nThey flourished from the 8th to 11th centuries.\n\nThey have left an indelible mark on European history and are known for their expedition to unknown lands.\n\nThe Vikings traveled through North America and the Mediterranean in search of fortune.\n\nThey established trade connections with European countries like Britain and Ireland.\n\nThey also looted monasteries and took whatever money or goods they could.\n\nAt the same time, they were accomplished craftsmen and produced jewelry and metalwork renowned throughout Europe.\n\nWhere Did Vikings Originate From?\n\nThere is some dispute as to where the Vikings were initially from.\n\nHowever, evidence shows they came from the Scandinavian countries, specifically Norway, Sweden, and Denmark.\n\nOne famous instance was when the Vikings attacked the Lindisfarne monastery in Northumbria, England, in 793 CE.\n\nHowever, Roman scholars referenced warrior groups with similar features as the Vikings before this date.\n\nIt means the Vikings were there before 793 CE and probably originated from Scandinavia.\n\nThey later emigrated to Britain, Ireland, Greenland, and Iceland.\n\nScandinavian vs. Nordic Ancestry\n\nThe Scandinavian peninsula is the area shared by Norway, Sweden, and a part of northern Finland\n\nNordic countries refer to all five of the northern European countries.\n\nDo Vikings Still Exist?\n\nVikings as a group don’t exist anymore.\n\nHowever, they have descendants all over Europe and the Scandinavian countries.\n\nIn many Scandinavian countries, many people dedicate their lives to living like the Vikings did long ago.\n\nThere are Viking villages in Norway and Sweden where people recreate the Viking way of life.\n\nHow Rare Is Viking DNA?\n\nIn a recent study, scientists examined 300 ancient human genomes from Scandinavia that spanned over 2000 years.\n\nThey compared these to modern human genomes and found that nearly 10 percent of Scandinavians had Viking DNA.\n\nIn the UK, around 6 percent of people possibly had Viking ancestry.\n\nViking DNA Test\n\nMany people share their DNA with the Vikings, and a Viking DNA test can help you understand your specific Scandinavian ancestry traits!\n\nThese tests look at your DNA and compare it to those of Viking ancestors to see how many common segments you share with them; the more the segments, the closer you are to the Vikings.\n\nSome companies that offer Viking DNA test include:\n\nAncestryDNA\n\nMyTrueAncestry\n\nGenomelink\n\n7 Physical Signs Of Viking DNA Ancestry\n\nGeographical location: The Vikings were a warrior class from Scandinavia. Naturally, people who live in Scandinavian countries like Norway and Sweden are more likely to be related to the Vikings.\n\nSurnames: Another good indicator of Viking ancestry is surnames. People with the surnames Johnson or Anderson are likely to have Viking ancestry. These surnames can be traced back to Norse traditions.\n\nFamily vacations: The Vikings were a seafaring group. If fishing and seafaring are common vocations in your family, you might be related to the Vikings.\n\nPersonality traits: The Vikings were fiercely independent, adventurous, and unafraid of danger. If you are fond of adventure and exploring new places, you might be an ancestor of the Vikings.\n\nPhysical appearance: In general, having red or light hair and blue eyes could mean you have Viking genes. Robust facial features such as a prominent chin and a broad forehead indicate a possible connection with the Vikings. Scandinavians might also have a “V-shaped” hairpin and extra body hair at the nape of their neck. However, all these traits need proof that you are a Viking.\n\nMuscular build: Vikings were usually well-built people with a robust physique, frequently indulging in activities like fishing and farming. You might have Viking DNA in your genes if you are naturally well-built.\n\nTall stature: The Vikings were usually more elevated than the average person. It was due to their diet and lifestyle. Being naturally taller can indicate a possible Viking connection.\n\nGenetic Traits Of Viking Ancestry\n\nThe mutations in the Y chromosome in males indicate the changes that have happened in the direct male lineage.\n\nThe two types of mutations are STR and SNP, of which STR is more common.\n\nSTRs define the haplogroup as a group of similar haplotypes with a common ancestor.\n\nAmong the 20 major Y chromosome haplogroups associated with Vikings are |1, R1a, R1b, G2, and N.\n\nWhat Nationality Is Considered a Viking?\n\nThe Vikings hailed from modern-day Scandinavia.\n\nThey were also called Norsemen.\n\nPeople from the Nordic region of Europe are usually considered the closest relatives of Vikings.\n\nThe Nordic region consists of Norway, Sweden, and Denmark.\n\nSince the Vikings were seafarers, they traveled to foreign lands across Europe.\n\nAs a result, some Viking DNA can also be found among the British, Scottish, and Irish people.\n\nAround 10 percent of people in Sweden and 6 percent in the UK are said to have Viking DNA.\n\nAre Vikings Scottish or Irish?\n\nVikings originally hail from Denmark, Norway, and Sweden.\n\nHowever, they did travel extensively and conquered the British Isles, including Ireland and Scotland.\n\nIt led to cultural exchange and intermingling with the local population.\n\nAs a result, Viking DNA can be found in many modern-day Scottish and Irish people.\n\nHow To Know If You Are From Vikings Ancestry?\n\nHaving the R1a, R1b, or |1 genetic variation does not confirm that you are a Viking, but you could be related to them.\n\nR1a is commonly found in Eastern Europe, while R1b can be found in Ireland, Wales, France, and Spain.\n\n|1 variation is found in Norway, Sweden, and Denmark.\n\nOutside of these countries, Viking heritage can be found in Britain.\n\nThe Vikings colonized and settled in Britain.\n\nIf you have any of the above genetic variations with a Norse paternal name, chances are you are related to the Vikings.\n\nWhat Does It Mean To Have Viking DNA?\n\nGenetic tests usually don’t have the word Viking written in the test reports.\n\nThe people who take these tests refer to the word “Scandinavia” in the report to claim they are related to the Vikings.\n\nHaving Viking DNA can mean that you had a Scandinavian ancestor.\n\nHowever, people use the results of these genetic tests to explain away specific problematic behavior.\n\nOne man in the US claimed that his Viking ancestry explains why he is so angry all the time.\n\nIt is a type of genetic determinism where a person’s life results from his genes and is not controlled by him.\n\nThe Vikings have long been associated with notions of whiteness and Nordic nationalism.\n\nThey have long been used as symbols by prominent fascist movements in Europe.\n\nThese genetic ancestry tests can fuel a potential new wave of racism and ethnic chauvinism.\n\nSummary: 7 Physical Signs Of Viking Ancestry\n\nThe Vikings were a group of maritime explorers from Scandinavia.\n\nThey conquered and settled in many European regions, leading to cultural intermingling.\n\nToday, their influences can be seen in European art and culture.\n\nAlthough the original Vikings have long become extinct, their genes can still be found today.\n\nPeople from Norway, Sweden, and Denmark are said to be most closely related to the Vikings.\n\nSome physical signs like fair skin and tall stature can be linked to having a possible Viking ancestor.\n\nHowever, claiming a Viking ancestor does not mean anything scientific.\n\nIn reality, it can lead to more racial discrimination and ethnic chauvinism.\n\nReferences\n\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/science/blog/2013/feb/25/viking-ancestors-astrology\n\nhttps://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(22)01468-4"
