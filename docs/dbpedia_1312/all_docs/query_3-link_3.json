        "text": "Stereotypes of Irish people include actual or imagined characteristics of Irish people used by people who view the Irish as a single and homogeneous group.\n\nCommon stereotypes\n\n[edit]\n\nViolence\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Irish are often stereotyped as being hot-tempered and eager for physical confrontation.[1] Boxing has a long history in Ireland, and the country has produced several Olympic gold medalist boxers, including Michael Carruth, Katie Taylor, and Kellie Harrington;[2] and UFC champion Conor McGregor.\n\nIreland's reputation for violence has been referenced in several media. For example, the Irish-American ballad \"Finnegan's Wake\" describes a wake that devolves into a brawl, during which whiskey is accidentally spilled onto the corpse. This causes the corpse to resurrect and join the brawl. The University of Notre Dame also uses the Fighting Irish as their mascot.[3][4]\n\nFood\n\n[edit]\n\nStereotypical Irish foods include bacon, corned beef and cabbage, and potatoes.[5]\n\nAlcoholism\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Irish have been stereotyped as heavy drinkers for centuries.[6][7][citation needed]\n\nRed hair\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Irish are often stereotyped as possessing red hair. Ireland has the second-highest amount of naturally occurring red hair at 10%, second only to Scotland with 13%. Furthermore, it is estimated that 46% of Ireland's population carries MC1R, the gene responsible for producing red hair.[8] County Cork is home to the annual Irish Redhead Convention.[9]\n\nHaving red hair is its own stereotype, and it is associated with undesirable behaviors, such as anger and being mischievous, \"like a redheaded leprechaun\".[7]\n\nBlack Irish\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Black Irish – not Irish people of African descent, but white people of Irish ancestry who had black or dark hair, or an appearance similar to people from the ethnic groups indigenous to the land around the Mediterranean Sea[10] – have been stereotyped as being especially prone to fighting.[11] The appearance was also associated with anti-Black racial ridicule.[10]\n\nReligion\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Irish are often stereotyped as being devoutly religious and conservative. Christianity has been the largest religion in Ireland since the 5th century. As of 2011 , 78% of Ireland's population adhered to the Catholic Church,[12] and both Irish people and people with red hair are stereotyped as being Catholic.[7] A 2018 study ranked Irish citizens between 16 and 29 among the most religious in Europe.[13] However, a \"Quiet Revolution\" is taking place, and Ireland is becoming increasingly secular.[14]\n\nEnmity towards the British\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Ireland-United Kingdom relations\n\nDue to many events in the shared history between the nations, such as the United Kingdom's limited assistance during the Great Famine, there is a lasting sense of Anti-British sentiment in Ireland.[15][16] Despite the troubled history between the two nations, both share close economic ties.\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nAn Englishman, an Irishman and a Scotsman\n\nRussell Brothers (vaudeville)"
