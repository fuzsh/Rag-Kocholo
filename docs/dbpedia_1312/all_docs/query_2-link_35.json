Upon graduating high school, he decided to forgo 26 basketball scholarships and a full academic scholarship to Yale. He decided to attend the prestigious University of Southern California to study at their School of Cinematic Arts, to further hone his craft. Early credits for Mehcad include: \"Malcolm in the Middle,\" \"Boston Public,\" \"One on One,\" \"Cold Case,\" \"The Game,\" \"Dollhouse,\" and \"Ghost Whisperer.\"\n\nWhile bringing characters to life remains one of Mehcad's biggest passions, his love for telling stories through music is equally important.
