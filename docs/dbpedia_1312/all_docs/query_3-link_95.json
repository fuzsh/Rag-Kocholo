        "text": "Definitions\n\nRace\n\nA social construct used to categorise groups of people, usually based on perceived physical characteristics or shared ancestry.\n\nRacialised categorisations may have characteristics associated with them that have no biological basis, and they have fuelled discrimination, violence and global power imbalances for centuries.\n\nHowever, the University recognises that racial identity is important to some people and can provide a way for marginalised groups to collectively share support, build community, or protest and tackle prejudice.\n\nEthnicity\n\nA term used to describe a social group with a shared cultural identity, which may include language, traditions, geographic origin, religion, cultural expression or customs.\n\nAn ethnic group can often be chosen by an individual, as opposed to a race, which is often ascribed to a person or group without their input.\n\nBroad terminology\n\nThe University recognises the diverse experiences of multiple ethnicities, and we want to reflect this in our writing.\n\nThere is not a universally supported term for referring to minority ethnic groups.\n\nIn the past, the University has used ‘Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic’ (or ‘BAME’) as a broad umbrella term – for example, for data collection, reporting, or bringing different groups together for purposes like anti-racism.\n\nFollowing consultation with people across the University, we will no longer use this term. Some of the reasons include:\n\nThis terminology encourages a binary approach, which only recognises those who identify as White as a distinct ethnic group.\n\nThe term is not widely understood, and can include different groups in different contexts.\n\nWe should use language that acknowledges a greater range of experiences and backgrounds and more accurately represents our University community.\n\nInstead of using ‘Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic’ or ‘BAME’, use precise terminology to describe the specific ethnicity of a person or group.\n\nIf it is absolutely necessary to use a broad term, use ‘minority ethnic group’ (not ‘minority group’ or ‘ethnic minority group’).\n\nDo not simply replace ‘BAME’ with ‘minority ethnic’. First, always consider whether you can use more specific language.\n\nRemember that this term uses ‘minority’ in a UK context, whereas UK minority ethnic groups are often a global majority.\n\nThe terminology ‘Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic’ / ‘BAME’ may still appear in legacy webpages, publications or other materials. We will continue to update these areas, with the aim of the terminology ‘Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic’ / ‘BAME’ becoming redundant over time.\n\nTerminology relating to ethnicity and race is rapidly evolving. We will continue to consult with our staff and students as we work to refine our approach to writing about ethnicity and race. We will update this guidance in future to reflect the outcome of these discussions."
