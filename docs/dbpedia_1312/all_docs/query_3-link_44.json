        "text": "There is a tongue-in-cheek expression in Ireland used when members of British society behave in an overly imperialistic or superior manner, or in ways which belie any sense of propriety or sensitivity to Irish history[1] and culture:[2] “The Brits are at it again”. When the BBC claim Paul Mescal as a British actor,[3] or Katie Taylor as a British Olympian[4] – they are “at it again”. When public figures define Ireland as still being part of the United Kingdom:[5] “at it again”. The expression is often flippantly used when considering English/British[6] involvement in Irish history.\n\nImperial Past\n\nThe degree to which these are examples of the British public and British education system failing to come to grips with their imperial past, and their historic relations with Ireland is an important question.[7] It would be unfair however to castigate the British system without considering its Irish counterpoint. This paper focuses on portrayals of the English[8] in Irish history textbooks from 1921 to 1969 in post-independence Ireland.[9] Ultimately, it challenges the strongly held perception that Irish history as taught was “not a subject, but a creed, not a discipline but a weapon”[10] consisting “largely of stoking up hatred against England”[11], a view which fails to take the differing emphases in the major textbooks into account or appreciate how portrayals of England were not as a rule xenophobic. A simplistic good Irishman – bad Englishman binary was not being promoted. There was room in the textbook accounts for some English/British figures to be portrayed in a positive light. For the most part however, the English were framed as colonial oppressor, against whom the ‘Irish’ resisted over centuries.[12]\n\nTo understand these portrayals, one must first consider the wider purpose of history education in Ireland at this time. School history, especially (but not exclusively) in post-independence societies, tends to transmit a positive story about the national past, with the desire that this “will inculcate in young people a sense of loyalty to the state; a reassuring and positive sense of identity and belonging; and a sense of social solidarity with fellow citizens.”.[13]\n\nIn the Irish context, there was general agreement across the major textbooks used in post-primary schools[14] as to the overall narrative of Irish history. It promoted in no uncertain terms political and military history, focusing on “great men”[15] with the general message being in line with the moralistic and cultural “policy of Gaelicisation” implemented by the Department of Education.[16] Ireland was not exceptional in this. The high-politics approach seen in these textbooks and the memorization by students of these facts about great men and political events constituted a dominant tradition of how history was taught up until the 1960s, both in England and abroad.[17]\n\nNarratives of Resistance and ‘Glorious Failure’\n\nThe popular textbooks portrayed a definite narrative of resistance and “glorious failure”. This was identified through the concept of an “Irish” people, united under a common Gaelic culture, language, and especially from the sixteenth century onwards, religion and sense of “nationalism” (though not always expressed in these explicit terms). Each of the major textbook series cover Irish history from the earliest time until the present.[18] They first establish who the “Irish” were, outlining their development as Gaelic adherents of Christianity.[19] The “protagonists” are then faced with the threat of invasion to which a response is necessary.[20]\n\nThus, the resistance narrative is developed, and maintained due to the repeated losses sustained by the Irish to this foreign element. The conflict was portrayed, not as between rival clans, ethnicities or nations, but between rival civilisations.[21] The hostility between Irish and feudal ideas of land ownership was seen to affect the very basis of social and political life and lay at the root of the future struggle between the two races. English involvement in Ireland was seen as a “discordant note”[22] working against the harmony of Irish society. This conflict began with the grants of Henry II in the twelfth century and Norman “settled policy of conquest”[23] and continued to the present day.[24]\n\nNo Singular Depictions\n\nThe English history discussed focussed on “elites”, namely kings, queens, and political and military leaders. One does not however see negative depictions of the “English” as a people, but more so negative depictions of English colonial authority or historical acts of oppression: such as the deportation of children to the West Indies to work on plantations in the 1650s, the imposition of Penal Laws against the Irish Catholic and Dissenter in the wake of the Williamite Wars, or the brutal torture of rebels in the 1790s. Certain commentators believed that school history at this time “encourages bitterness in our children” being taught “for the purpose of belittling England and denigrating the British.”[25] Others contended that history needed to not shy away from the brutal facts of the Anglo-Irish relationship. As Minister for Education Patrick Hillery noted in 1964\n\nSome Deputies…want to have Cromwell without his warts…Cromwell’s warts, as far as we are concerned, are something like the massacre of defenseless men, women and children at Drogheda. It is there; it happened and there is no justifying it. …If we omitted teaching things like this, we should be making it difficult for our children to understand that our history is the history of a conquest and its undoing …[T]he greatest achievement of this nation was its survival from the longest and most thorough conquest known to history. To appreciate the achievement of our immediate and ancient ancestors and to have some self-respect we must realise that this was a conquest that was associated with persecution, violence and massacres.[26]\n\nSome depictions of this time were inherently biased, with wrongdoings committed by the “Irish” being either denied or else qualified,[27] while similar actions by their enemies were utterly condemned.[28] This was not a rule however. Hayden and Moonan’s text (1921) notes in its Preface that “while written from a frankly national stand-point, the authors have made every effort to attain accuracy and avoid prejudice. Events are dealt with, as far as possible, in the spirit and atmosphere of their times, but are judged by their final effects upon the destinies of the nation.”[29]\n\nWhile discussing the siege of Derry 1689, the English governor of the city George Walker is described as “a militant clergyman of remarkable courage and capacity”. The people of Derry were also noted as “brave”during their suffering. When describing the Battle of the Boyne, Hayden criticises James II for his “indecision and downright cowardly” behaviour, whereas William of Orange was described as a “skilled and experienced general” along with his associates.[30] It was not exclusively Irish Catholic nationalist leaders who were lauded. Conversely, when discussing the French Revolution as context for the foundation of the United Irishmen,[31] Ó Siochfhradha openly defines the English in Ireland as “tyrants” against whom the people of Ireland formed a united movement “in an intense effort to expel.”[32] This demonstrates how there was no singular depiction of the English in Irish history textbooks.\n\nThis understanding was used when discussing the nineteenth century in Ireland. The significance of landlordism and “Land” as a theme was evident in all textbooks, being especially important to Carty.[33] Some textbooks commented on how fair landlords did exist, before criticising others. The issue was not English landlords, but absentee or oppressive landlords.[34] Their disregard for the suffering Irish tenantry was at issue, not their nationality. Moreover, in Irish language textbooks, the “oppressor” were regularly referred to as “Gaill” or “foreigners”. This demonstrates a deeper understanding that what was reviled was not the fact of being English, but rather the concept of any oppressor foreign to the Gaelic ideal. When Robert the Bruce and his brother Edward were discussed for instance, they were not classified in the same manner as the earlier Normans, nor the later Planters, due to their connection with Gaelic culture.[35]\n\nThe Swing of the Pendulum\n\nEnemies of “Ireland” could just as easily be of Irish descent, while champions could be of English descent, such as W.E. Gladstone.[36] What was common is that the figures chosen to be celebrated were those who adhered to and furthered a nationalist cause (though not necessarily independence). Those figures who were on the “side of the Irish” were described in generally positive terms,[37] and given physical characteristics to match their feats,[38] while those who were on the “wrong side” of this nationalist narrative were described in negative terms or simply left undefined.[39] While a balanced account was noticeable in historical detail, the overall perspective from which the textbook was written certainly favoured the Gaelic Catholic point of view.[40]\n\nMost of the textbooks published after the late 1920s included aspects of European and English history where relevant.[41] Despite this, complaints abounded about the lack of English history being learned in Irish schools, even where this directly affected Irish history. This was highlighted by Senator Michael Hayes in 1939, who denied claims of anti-English bias in Irish history textbooks, but noted that “while I was reared to hate the British in schools that were controlled by the British Government, the young people now do not seem to know the first thing about the British …whether they are taught through Irish or English.”[42]\n\nThis assertion is given weight when analysed alongside the annual Departmental Reports, which complained that “while formerly too much stress was laid on English History, the pendulum in some of the schools seems to have swung too far in the other direction… It is undesirable that teachers should treat Irish history as an isolated phenomenon or should fail to explain the connection between events in Ireland and the contemporaneous events in Great Britain and Europe.”[43] This omission created a strange understanding of British involvement in Irish history, being largely uncontextualized. For some, this gave a peculiar malevolence to it.[44]\n\nFocus and Frames\n\nThe Irish history textbooks in use between 1921 and 1969 ultimately aligned with the traditional understanding of what national history entailed: namely political and militaristic history. Through descriptive language, the “heroes” and “villains” of the Irish story could be discerned, and due to the target audience, these accounts were portrayed, not in a suggestive but in a declarative way. The portrayal of the English in Irish history textbook did tend towards the negative. This should not be surprising considering the focus on high politics and military history, where the English, and later British were seen as the oppressive force against which the Irish people resisted for centuries. That Irish history textbooks focussed predominantly on a struggle against “an alien oppressor” reflected a pattern seen in most newly independent countries across Europe in the twentieth century.[45]\n\nDespite this, there was space for the English to be portrayed in a positive light in Irish history textbooks. These examples were generally predicated on the individual being a champion of Irish Gaelic tradition and/or Irish nationalism. The textbooks focused on the “great men” of Irish history, provided moral and civic lessons, but ultimately framed the English as historical oppressors who repeatedly were found to be “at it again”.\n\n_____________________\n\nFurther Reading\n\nMac Gearailt, Colm.”Writing the Irish past: An investigation into post-primary Irish history textbook emphases and historiography, 1921–69.” History Education Research Journal, Vol. 15, No. 2 2018, 233-47.\n\nMac Gearailt, Colm. “Examinations and Irish history – Intermediate Certificate history and gauging the official historical narrative, 1926–1968,” Irish Educational Studies, Vol. 43, Issue 2 2023, 205-31.\n\nJanmaat, Jan Germen. ” The ethnic ‘other’ in Ukrainian history textbooks: the case of Russia and the Russians.” Compare: A Journal of Comparative and International Education, 37:3 2007, 307-324, DOI: 10.1080/03057920701330180\n\nWeb Resources\n\nCouncil of Europe: History textbooks (1953-1991): https://www.coe.int/en/web/history-teaching/history-textbooks (last accessed 27 June 2023).\n\nGeorg Eckert Institute for Educational Media: https://www.gei.de/ (last accessed 27 June 2023).\n\nHistory Teachers’ Association of Ireland: https://htai.ie/ (last accessed 27 June 2023).\n\n_____________________\n\n[1] The Irish Free State was established in 1922, following the ratification of the 1921 Anglo-Irish Treaty.\n\n[2] A simplistic view of Ireland as colony has been challenged in recent years, owing to the ambiguous relationship between Ireland and empire, especially from the eighteenth century on.

See Brian Mulcahy, “A Study of the Relationship between Ireland and England as Portrayed in Irish Post-Primary School History Textbooks, Published since 1922, and Dealing with the Period 1800 to the Present” (Unpublished PhD, University of Hull, 1988).\n\n[28] Hayden and Moonan, A Short History of the Irish People, 1921, 301–2.; discussing the Confederate Wars, and the cruel treatment by English soldiers of Irish combatants, and civilians alike. This was in contrast with the Irish Party who “after the first few months, cannot be charged with any such savagery. Captured garrisons were frequently suffered to depart where they would; prisoners often remained for long periods in the hands of the Confederate troops and were finally released uninjured. Eoghan Ruadh punished with great severity any attempt of his soldiers to plunder or ill-use the civil population, and he treated his captives with the utmost consideration and courtesy. When the English Parliament issued a decree (1644) that no quarter should in future be given to any Irishman ” taken in hostilities ” against it, the Confederate Council did not retort, as it might well have done, by a similar decree against the Parliamentarian soldiers.”\n\n[29] Hayden and Moonan, iii. – This work was initially written for University students, though used in secondary schools.\n\n[30] Ibid, 340–45. Notably, the siege was defined as that of ‘Derry’, not ‘Londonderry’\n\n[31] This textbook chapter was titled ‘Teagasc na bPoblachtaithe’ -Translation: ‘the Teaching of the Republicans’.\n\n[32] Ó Siochfhradha, Stair Sheanchas Éireann, 157.\n\n[33] Over one fifth of Carty’s Class-Book III is dedicated exclusively to the concept of land, with specific sections on ‘The Struggle for Land, I & II’, as well as on ‘Agriculture and Industry’. (34 pages from a total of 169) See Carty, Class-Book III, 66–87, 128–41. What is more, ‘Land’ featured heavily in other sections of the text as well, notably when discussing the Great Hunger, and so this 1/5 is not a final amount.\n\n[34] Hayden and Moonan, A Short History of the Irish People, 1921, 498. “Of the resident landlords many did their duty nobly. Some were ruined by the lavishness of their charity. On the other hand, there were surprising instances of heartlessness, amongst the absentees especially. There were parishes in which practically the whole population was reduced to a state of utter destitution, while the lord of the soil, dwelling in London or in Paris, subscribed not a penny for their relief, and merely grumbled that his rents were not remitted to him as usual. Perhaps even, he desired his agent to serve notices of eviction on the starving peasants, and to fling them out to die on the roadside.”\n\n[35] See Department of Education, Examination Papers, ‘Intermediate Certificate- History’, 1968, Q. 1 (alternative), for an example of this different portrayal.\n\n[36] Hayden and Moonan, 541. “Ireland should remember with gratitude the Statesman to whom she owes the Disestablishment of the Irish Church, the first important Land Bill, and the two attempts to restore her legislature, to which he devoted so much of the evening of his days.”\n\n[37] Ibid, 77–78.For example, before the Battle of Clontarf, the language differed greatly for Brian’s allies vs his enemies: His wife, Gormfhlaith, who left with her son, Maolmordha, and rallied a Norse alliance against Brian was described as ‘bitterly resentful’ and ‘vindictive’, while Malachy, the only chief of Leath Chuinn (northern half of Ireland) who joined with Brian was described as ‘patriotic’.\n\n[38] For example, Patrick Sarsfield (Seventeenth century nationalist hero) was a ‘fine handsome man, very tall and strong’, while Daniel O’Connell was a ‘tall, well-built and handsome man’. For a representative example, see the depiction of Hugh O’Neill, Hayden and Moonan, 271. This was also noted by Ciara Boylan in her review of James Carty A Junior History of Ireland for the National Collection of Children’s Books https://nccb.tcd.ie/exhibit/3197xm07c, viewed 12/07/16;\n\n[39] For example, see Ó Siochfhradha, Stair Sheanchas Éireann, 62, 66. Diarmuid Mac Murrough is described as being ‘rough and repulsive’ (garbh gránna), Henry II as a ‘lúbaire’, or fraudster, and the Norman barons as ‘sladairí’ (ravagers/ruiners).

She included the list of Monarchs, from the Tudors up to the House of Windsor, and George VI at the start of the appropriately corresponding chapters. Overall, her work broadly followed the accepted ‘story of Ireland’, as laid down by previous textbook writers.\n\n[41] See for example Ó Siochfhradha, Stair Sheanchas Éireann, 83–85. and his discussion of Luther, the growth of Protestantism on the continent, Henry VIII’s feud with the Pope, and its importance to why he declared himself King of Ireland in 1534. This was largely omitted from Hayden and Moonan’s text, which stated “The details of the dispute belong to English History and do not concern us here.” Hayden and Moonan, A Short History of the Irish People, 1921, 204.; Complaints as to this were noted in reviews at the time, See New York Times, 7 January 1923, ‘Review’: “The chief defect of (Hayden and Moonan) as history is that the English policy in Ireland is not frequently enough related to the general European situation. This is especially true in the explanation of the Act of union, where there is scarcely a hint that one of the reasons for its passage was the desirability of binding the British dominions together against the increasing power of Napoleon. The old saying that ‘He who would England win/ Must first with Ireland begin’ is completely ignored. …\n\n[42] Seanad Debates, vol. 22, 26 Jan. 1939, col.889 ; Hayes was former Minister for Education (responsible for the secondary Branch, 1922) and at the time of the debate, UCD Lecturer in modern Languages.\n\n[43] Rules and Programmes of the Department of Education, 1927-8, (Dublin, 1929), p.58.
