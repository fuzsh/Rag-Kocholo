        "text": "The key element in the initial Irish experience of Australia was getting here. Until the end of the 19th century, the Irish journey to Australia was largely made under governmental supervision, either in a convict transport or in a vessel chartered by a colonial government.\n\nWhile there were some disastrous convict voyages, and later some equally appalling government-sponsored immigrant voyages, by and large the long sea passage was experienced under conditions markedly superior to those endured by many other emigrants during the 19th century.\n\nEven where modern Irish memory recalls death- and disease-ridden ‘coffin ships’ heading for North America during the years of the Great Famine, colonial government emigrants were, by the standards of the day, generally well fed, adequately clothed and medically cared for.\n\nWhile the most significant years of Irish emigration to Australia were over by the time of the First World War, the Irish have continued to arrive here in smaller numbers up until the present day.\n\nOnce in Australia they toiled to make a decent life for themselves and their descendants, and for the general society around them. They were involved in the creation of this new colonial society from the very beginning. Take, for example, their involvement in political life.\n\nIn the mid-1850s, on the goldfields of Victoria, Irish diggers, along with the English, Scottish and men of many other nationalities, insisted on their rights to full democratic participation in colonial life, rights long denied to them by the particular social, religious and economic repressiveness of British rule in Ireland.\n\nIt was the Irish, with their symbolic password ‘Vinegar Hill’, their making of pikes and their leader Peter Lalor, who were arguably the most prominent contingent among the 150 or so diggers who bore the brunt of the police and military attack on the Eureka stockade on 3 December 1854.\n\nThe Australian achievement of male suffrage during that decade admitted Irish males into full participation in colonial affairs; as a result, Irish Catholics such as Charles Gavan Duffy, John O’Shanassy and many others were able to reach high political office, something that would have been barely conceivable in the other parliaments of the British Empire at the time.\n\nEven a cursory examination of those Irish who have clearly contributed to Australia’s economic and cultural development produces a long list. Many of the thousands of Irish immigrants were highly qualified, as evidenced by their success in manufacturing, agriculture, pastoralism, the law, science, medicine, prospecting, engineering and many other walks of life.\n\nA surviving Union combine harvester, built in 1898, is a reminder that it was Irishman James Morrow who produced Australia’s first viable combine harvester. The Lennon Foundry, founded by Irishman Hugh Lennon, was the largest of its kind in Victoria, and it was the mould boards from Lennon ploughs that the Kelly gang beat into Australia’s most famous suits of armour. A significant number of colonial governors and senior members of the judiciary were Irish, among them Sir Richard Bourke, the Earl of Belmore, Sir John Madden and Sir Redmond Barry.\n\nThe contribution of the Irish-born and their descendants to Australian culture generally – to literature, music, sport, the theatre, filmmaking and art – was considerable and continues to this day. The Irish, as one ballad has it, ‘gave us our songs to sing’, and the Australian folk music scene provides plenty of evidence of what that genre owes to Ireland.\n\nMost 19th-century Irish immigrants, however, especially the Catholics, gained employment initially in domestic service and in the dozens of lowly labouring occupations that made up the urban and rural workforce. They came from fairly impoverished rural regions and possessed few skills beyond some basic literacy. It was their children and grandchildren who rose up through the ranks of Australian society.\n\nNevertheless, the Irish of all denominations spread across the continent and nowhere did they form the type of ghetto communities that were such a feature in American and British cities.\n\nSome locations, such as Koroit in Victoria, Kapunda in South Australia and Kiama in New South Wales had disproportionate numbers of Irish settlers, but virtually every community in every colony had its Irish component.\n\nThe descendants of the Catholic Irish often feel that their ancestors were victims in Australia of continuing British Protestant bigotry and discrimination. Phrases like ‘No Irish need apply’ or ‘No Catholic need apply’ spring to mind here.\n\nInformal employment practices that did exclude Irish Catholics from certain workplaces certainly existed well into the 20th century. Yet, the full story here is still unclear.\n\nRecent research shows that at the census of 1901 Australian Catholics, the overwhelming majority of them Irish or of Irish descent, were fairly evenly spread through all occupational groups, with the exception of high finance.\n\nOliver MacDonagh, quoting 1933 census figures, has shown that by that time Australian Catholics were proportionally spread through all income levels in Australia. If the Irish and their descendants, he argues, lagged economically behind the English and the Scottish, it was ‘only by one or two steps’.\n\nAs the 20th century wore on, old hostilities began to fade – especially after the Japanese threat to the nation during the Second World War, which helped to unite Australians across previously denominational and ethnic boundaries.\n\nInterest in such matters as Irish reunification, a cause espoused by prominent Irish leader Éamon de Valera during a nationwide tour in 1948, was negligible. Patrick O’Farrell even entitled an analytical article on this visit, ‘Irish Australia at an End’.\n\nPostwar migration from Catholic countries other than Ireland began a process whereby the hold of the Irish in the Catholic Church began to erode, a process that the growth of an Australian-born priesthood had foreshadowed even before the war.\n\nToday’s Irish immigrants are few in comparison to the large numbers in previous centuries and could not hope to have the same formative influence on Australian society as their predecessors.\n\nBut some have made a name for themselves with significant contributions to the nation’s cultural and social life. One such is Claire Dunne, who co-starred in the film made from John O’Grady’s whimsical story of ethnic Australian social mores, They’re a Weird Mob. Dunne went on to be the founder, under the Whitlam government, of the ethnic radio stations 2EA and 3EA.\n\nOld divisions over Ireland rumbled on, however, throughout the 1950s and 1960s. In particular, Australian governments under Sir Robert Menzies were unwilling to recognise the claim of the Dublin-based government of the Republic of Ireland to jurisdiction over the whole country, including the 6 counties of Northern Ireland, which were still an integral part of the United Kingdom.\n\nBut in 1963, when Menzies brought in a form of state aid to Catholic schools and then, 2 years later, appointed a full-time Australian ambassador to Ireland, he was perhaps signalling an end to those issues about Ireland and religion that for so long had divided Australians.\n\nPolitics perhaps played a part, since the Catholic vote, long seen as being more likely to favour the Australian Labor Party, was now just as likely to be given to more conservative parties.\n\nSt Patrick’s Day activities in Australia have mirrored the changing nature of Irish Australia. In the early years of the penal colony of New South Wales, convict workers, hungover from the excesses of the patron saint’s festival, were remarked upon by their British gaolers.\n\nDuring the middle years of the 19th century, the day was often celebrated with community dinners and lengthy speeches, and was attended by Irish and non-Irish alike.\n\nAfter the Fenian scare of 1868, St Patrick’s Day celebrations often took the form of large picnics with music, dancing, and semi-serious sporting activities (such as the tug-of-war). In Sydney, by the 1880s, street marches were held. But by this stage the day was definitely an Irish-Catholic occasion.\n\nIn the mid-1890s Cardinal Moran, feeling that the event was too closely associated with loud, unedifying activities that tended to strengthen prejudices about Catholics, took matters into his own hands. He developed Sydney’s St Patrick’s Day as a ‘national festival’ to be celebrated by appropriate religious ceremonies in the cathedral, Catholic school athletic demonstrations at the showgrounds, a vice-regal lunch and a formal concert in the Town Hall.\n\nIn the crisis years of 1916–22 St Patrick’s Day parades in Melbourne under Archbishop Mannix were assertive political statements of Catholic loyalty to Australia during the war and support for the cause of Irish independence.\n\nDuring the 1930s in Sydney, with Irish-born archbishop Michael Kelly supervising affairs, the parades had no such Irish political content: instead, floats displaying stories of early Catholic Sydney or St Patrick himself, surrounded by round towers, harps and Celtic crosses, took centrestage.\n\nAfter the Second World War, however, the city’s observance of St Patrick’s Day amounted to little more than special religious services, an evening concert and school sports displays at the showgrounds.\n\nFor as long as Mannix was alive, the Melbourne parade continued, but it ceased altogether in 1970. Could this perhaps be explained by a growing sense among a generation of postwar Catholics, as sectarian antipathies slowly evaporated, that these public displays of Irish ethnic origins carried less and less meaning for them as Australians?\n\nThe parade experienced a rebirth in Sydney in the late 1970s, and a patchy revival in Melbourne, organised by Irish ex-pats as a fun day of celebration and fancy floats with an Irish cultural emphasis.\n\nVirtually absent was any reference to previous Irish-Australian stories and that sense of Catholic self-assertiveness characteristic of earlier parades. It all seemed very much part of a new multicultural Australia, of which the modern Irish were simply one more colourful component.\n\nOne Melbourne organiser unwittingly provided an epitaph for the old-style Australian St Patrick’s Days: ‘It is a great day for the Irish, the English, the Vietnamese, the Cambodian and everyone else who cares to come to the party.'\n\nNevertheless, St Patrick’s Day remains the Irish day in Australia. The statements of today’s parade organisers might show little understanding of the complexities of an Irish-Australian past stretching back to 1788, but through all the shenanigans – green beer, dyed hair and T-shirts bearing ‘Kiss me I’m Irish’ slogans – a question still lingers in the air: ‘What has it meant to be Irish in Australia?’\n\nThe objects and stories assembled here do not provide a simple answer to that question, but rather show just what a remarkable and rich story Australia has inherited from a past where the Irish were among the stars of the show.\n\nThis essay by Richard Reid appeared in the National Museum of Australia’s publication, Not Just Ned: A True History of the Irish in Australia."
