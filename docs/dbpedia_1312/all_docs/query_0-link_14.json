Coined the term \"analysis of algorithms\" and made major contributions to that field, including popularizing Big O notation. 1990-1993 Lam, Simon S. Lam was inducted into the Internet Hall of Fame (2023) by the Internet Society for “inventing secure sockets in 1991 and implementing the first secure sockets layer, named SNP, in 1993.”[37] In 1990, he conceived the idea of a new security sublayer in the Internet protocol stack. This way, application programmers do not need to know much about implementation details for security. Also, the upper interface of the sublayer would enable implementation changes in the future. Lam’s idea of a sublayer which offers a “secure sockets interface” to applications was novel and a radical departure from contemporary security research for Internet applications (e.g., MIT’s Kerberos, 1988-1992). SNP was created for Internet applications in general. Subsequent secure sockets layers, SSL and TLS, developed years later for commercial browsers, followed the same architecture and key ideas of SNP. Today, TLS 1.3 is used not only for all e-commerce applications (banking, shopping, etc.) on WWW, but also for email, and many other Internet applications. 1950-1960 Lamarr, Hedy At the beginning of World War II, she and composer George Antheil developed a radio guidance system for Allied torpedoes that used spread spectrum and frequency hopping technology to defeat the threat of jamming by the Axis powers.

He anticipated later developments in first-order predicate calculus, which were crucial for the theoretical foundations of computer science. 1960 Licklider, J. C. R. Began the investigation of human–computer interaction, leading to many advances in computer interfaces as well as in cybernetics and artificial intelligence. 1987 Liskov, Barbara Developed the Liskov substitution principle, which guarantees semantic interoperability of data types in a hierarchy. 1300~ Llull, Ramon Designed multiple symbolic representations machines, and pioneered notions of symbolic representation and manipulation to produce knowledge—both of which were major influences on Leibniz. 1852 Lovelace, Ada An English mathematician and writer, chiefly known for her work on Charles Babbage's proposed mechanical general-purpose computer, the Analytical Engine. She was the first to recognize that the machine had applications beyond pure calculation, and created the first algorithm intended to be carried out by such a machine. As a result, she is often regarded as the first to recognize the full potential of a \"computing machine\" and the first computer programmer. 1909 Ludgate, Percy Charles Babbage in 1843 and Percy Ludgate in 1909 designed the first two Analytical Engines in history. Ludgate's engine used multiplication as its basis (using his own discrete Irish logarithms), had the first multiplier-accumulator (MAC), was first to exploit a MAC to perform division, stored numbers as displacements of rods in shuttles, and had several other novel features, including for program control. 1971 Martin-Löf, Per Published an early draft on the type theory that many proof assistants build on. 1943, 1951 Mauchly, John With J. Presper Eckert, designed and built the ENIAC, the first modern (all electronic, Turing-complete) computer, and the UNIVAC I, the first commercially available computer.

Co-creator of the Logic Theory Machine and the General Problem Solver programs. 1953 Spärck Jones, Karen [undue weight? – discuss] One of the pioneers of information retrieval and natural language processing. 1972 Stallman, Richard Stallman launched the GNU Project in September 1983 to create a Unix-like computer operating system composed entirely of free software. With this, he also launched the free software movement. 1993 Stearns, Richard E. Foundations for the field of computational complexity theory.[32] 1981 Stepanov, Alexander Stepanov is one of the pioneers when it comes to Generic Programming and he is also the primary designer and implementer of the C++ Standard Template Library. 1937, 1941 Stibitz, George R. Father of modern digital computing and remote job entry. Coined the term \"digital\". Discovered the reflected binary code known as Gray code. Excess-3 code is named after him as well (Stibitz code). 1982 Stonebraker, Michael Revolutionized the field of database management systems (DBMSs) and founded multiple successful database companies 1979 Stroustrup, Bjarne Invented C++ at Bell Labs 1963 Sutherland, Ivan Author of Sketchpad, the ancestor of modern computer-aided drafting (CAD) programs and one of the early examples of object-oriented programming. 1986 Tarjan, Robert Fundamental achievements in the design and analysis of algorithms and data structures. 1973 Thacker, Charles P. Pioneering design and realization of the Xerox Alto, the first modern personal computer, and in addition for his contributions to the Ethernet and the Tablet PC. 1972, 1973 Thi, André Truong Trong and François Gernelle[undue weight? – discuss] Invention of the Micral N, the earliest commercial, non-kit personal computer based on a microprocessor. 1967 Thompson, Ken Created the Unix operating system, the B programming language, Plan 9 operating system, the first machine to achieve a Master rating in chess, and the UTF-8 encoding at Bell Labs and the Go programming language at Google. 1993 Toh, Chai Keong Created mobile ad hoc networking; Implemented the first working wireless ad hoc network of laptop computers in 1998 using Linux OS, Lucent WaveLan 802.11 radios, and a new distributed routing protocol transparent to TCP/UDP/IP. 1912, 1914 Torres Quevedo, Leonardo In 1912, Leonardo Torres Quevedo built El Ajedrecista (the chess player), one of the first autonomous machines capable of playing chess. As opposed to the human-operated The Turk and Ajeeb, El Ajedrecista was a true automaton built to play chess without human guidance. It played an endgame with three chess pieces, automatically moving a white king and a rook to checkmate the black king moved by a human opponent. In his work Essays on Automatics, published in 1914, Torres Quevedo formulates what will be a new branch of engineering: automation and designed an electromechanical version of Babbage's Analytical machine which introduced floating-point arithmetic. 1991 Torvalds, Linus Created the first version of the Linux kernel. 1965 Tukey, John W. With James Cooley, created the fast Fourier transform. He invented the term \"bit\".[54] 1936 Turing, Alan Made several fundamental contributions to theoretical computer science, including the Turing machine computational model, the conceiving of the stored program concept and the designing of the high-speed ACE design. Independently of Alonzo Church, he formulated the Church-Turing thesis and proved that first-order logic is undecidable. He also explored the philosophical issues concerning artificial intelligence, proposing what is now known as Turing test. 2010 Valiant, Leslie Transformative contributions to the theory of computation, including the theory of probably approximately correct (PAC) learning, the complexity of enumeration and of algebraic computation, and the theory of parallel and distributed computing. 1875, 1875 Verea, Ramón Designed and patented the Verea Direct Multiplier, the first mechanical direct multiplier. 1950~ Wang An Made key contributions to the development of magnetic core memory. 1955, 1960s, 1974 Ware, Willis Co-designer of JOHNNIAC. Chaired committee that developed the Code of Fair Information Practice and led to the Privacy Act of 1974. Vice-chair of the Privacy Protection Study Commission. 1964, 1966 Weizenbaum, Joseph One of the fathers of modern artificial intelligence. Creator of the ELIZA program using natural language processing to emulate conversations with a psychologist. 1968 Wijngaarden, Adriaan van Developer of the W-grammar first used in the definition of ALGOL 68 1949 Wilkes, Maurice Built the first practical stored program computer (EDSAC) to be completed and for being credited with the ideas of several high-level programming language constructs. 1970 Wilkinson, James H. Research in numerical analysis to facilitate the use of the high-speed digital computer, having received special recognition for his work in computations in linear algebra and \"backward\" error analysis.[55] 1970, 1978 Wirth, Niklaus Designed the Pascal, Modula-2 and Oberon programming languages. 2000 Yao, Andrew Fundamental contributions to the theory of computation, including the complexity-based theory of pseudorandom number generation, cryptography, and communication complexity. 1955–1958 Zemanek, Heinz Developed an early fully transistorized computer, the Mailüfterl. Crucial in the creation of the formal definition of the programming language PL/I."
