        "meta_description": "The alien, the foreigner, the outsider have been historically represented as unclean, sick, contagious, and mentally unsound. In the nineteenth century, the British and American imaginaries framed both the Irish and the Chinese in such terms, even though it was primarily the Irish who staffed Britain’s imperial armies, and the Chinese who manned its merchant ships, washed it sailors’ clothes, and dug its trenches. The sexual union of both Irish and Chinese with British or American women was particularly feared, and the hybrid child seen as especially mentally unstable and undesirable. The discursive and institutional treatment of “the Irish” and “the Chinese” was not an isolated practice, and would be reapplied to other ethnic groups in both the USA and the UK right into the present century, as the UK Home office’s treatment of the British citizens of Caribbean origin has illustrated.",

        "text": "Chinese\n\nJapanese\n\nDirty knees\n\nLook at these\n\nThe Irish\n\n2In the bourgeois dominant imaginary of the nineteenth century the poor, the working class, the common people were depicted as sickly and dirty with an array of metaphors and commonplaces which were easily transferable to immigrant ethnic groups, first among whom were the Irish poor who found themselves starved into taking refuge in Britain in horrendous insanitary conditions as bad as or worse than that of the northern English workers we may read of in such novels as Gaitskell's Mary Barton (1848). Ill-health and a lack of hygiene were no inherent trait of the Irish working class, but simply a corollary of a social condition to which they had been condemned.\n\n11 Gair, The Liverpool Review Vol IX, No.3 (March 1934) 13.\n\nThe United States, seeing her institutions likely to crumble before this menace, and with the glaring of the deleterious effects of \"wops\" \"dagoes\" and Irish, in her lower orders, has with admirable courage, closed the doors and adopted a policy which aims at the maintenance of the Nordic race-type.\n\nThe Chinese\n\n9There was one dominant source for late nineteenth century and early twentieth-century “ethnographic” knowledge about China and Chinese; both high-brow and popular writers on China relied on a set of stereotypes first popularized by an American missionary, Arthur Smith in his 1890 work Chinese Characteristics in which Smith is at pains to emphasize the ‘racial’ difference of the ‘Chinaman’. The depiction is largely negative. The mental capacities and mode of thought are commented on in particular by Smith. Here he describes the “deficiencies” of the Chinese mind:\n\n15 Arthur H. Smith, Chinese Characteristics, Shanghai: North China Herald office, 1890; London: Kegan (...)\n\nHe does not understand, because he does not expect to understand, and it takes him an appreciable time to get such intellectual forces as he has, into a position to be used at all. His mind is like a rusty old smooth-bore cannon mounted on an old decrepit carriage… Another mark of intellectual torpor is the inability of an ordinary mind to entertain an idea, and then pass it on to another in its original shape.\n\n17 Jean Rodes, À travers la Chine actuelle, Paris: Fasquelle, 1932, p. 172: ‘Le pouvoir de contrôle du (...)\n\nThe power of control over the brain being less developed in the Chinese, he, under certain conditions of agitation, is overtaken by all sorts of subconscious and uncontrolled reflexes of dorsal column automatism … [in which can be seen] a cause of racial inferiority, which had so charmed Count Gobineau.\n\n11The reference to Gobineau in a text written in the 1930s might seem from today’s perspective both ominous and perverse. When in 1932 Rodes employed those words, Hitler was rising to power, and in the following year would gain plenary powers, bolstered by the banalization of late nineteenth-century racist ideology. Arthur de Gobineau’s nineteenth-century theories of scientific racism, and his celebrated, later infamous, theories glorifying the Aryan master race, had already helped legitimize and justify nineteenth-century colonialist expansion in Africa and Asia. His writings influenced the anti-Semitic stance adopted by the composer Richard Wagner, and was later, in a redacted form, required reading for German Nazi party members and leadership. Gobineau was convinced, as was his acolyte Wagner, that China would invade Europe, and thus he was instrumental in spreading amongst the German aristocracy and beyond a fear of “the Chinese”; a fear that was constructed and reified as the ‘Yellow Peril’.\n\n12Western racist literary and journalistic representations thus straddled the end of the Qing and the early decades of the Republic of China. For the hawker of racist stereotypes, little if anything had changed; it was after all the West that had invented ‘China’, the ‘Chinese’ and, of course, ‘the Chinaman’. With the legitimation of racism as scientific, Europe—soon to be followed by Japan and the United States—had entered a new phase of colonialism marked by imperialist territorial and economic expansion, driven by an industrial capitalist modernity that required resources and markets, but which also needed to bolster xenophobic nationalist ideology. The nineteenth century, then, saw confrontation between imperialist powers, particularly Britain, on the one hand and the Qing dynasty on the other.\n\n13In the second half of the nineteenth century, a period coinciding with the Opium Wars and their aftermath, the campaign against the presence of Chinese in the USA gained momentum and would lead to the passing of the 1870 Naturalization Act and the Exclusion Act of 1882. Media representation of “the Chinese” was particularly virulent:\n\n18 New York Daily Tribune, September 29, 1854, page 4.\n\nThey [the Chinese] are uncivilized, unclean, filthy beyond all conception, without any of the higher domestic or social relations; lustful and sensual in their dispositions; every [italicized in original] female is a prostitute, and of the basest order; the first words of English they learn are terms of obscenity or profanity, and beyond this they care to learn no more. […T]he Chinese quarter of the city [San Francisco] is a by-word for filth and sin.\n\n15In the Tribune editorial cited above, the phobia of death by drowning in an alien and unclean fluid is brought into play. The fear of fluids is imbricated with, and predicated upon, the fear of contamination, the terror of being made unclean by the filthy and sick. Foregrounding fears of dirt and contamination, the New York Daily Tribune, depicts a youthful, promising California facing the yellow contagion of \"Asiatic hordes\" of a politically decadent, physically decaying, and morally degenerate Celestial Empire just across the sea.\n\n27 New York Times, September 3, 1865, page 1.\n\nThe security of free institutions is more important than the enlargement of its population. The maintenance of an elevated national character is of higher value than mere growth in physical power....with Oriental thoughts will necessarily come Oriental social habits.... We have four millions of degraded negroes in the South...and if, in addition...there were to be a flood-tide of Chinese population--a population befouled with all the social vices...with heathenish souls and heathenish propensities, whose character, and habits, and modes of thought are firmly fixed by the consolidating influence of ages upon ages -- we should be prepared to bid farewell to republicanism and democracy.\n\nIrish versus Chinese\n\n19The term \"Mongolians\" was frequently used well into the twentieth century, as a synonym for what was understood as “the Chinese”, and encompassed on occasion other East Asians and South-East Asians. The Irish Citizen's recommendation with regard to \"Mongolians,\" would be legitimated five days later, when on Independence Day 1870, the Naturalization Act was passed. It excluded “Chinese”from naturalization as US citizens. In the same act, another clause finally allowed Americans of African descent the legal right to citizenship. The degradation suffered by African Americans was thus re-inscribed onto the body of the \"Celestial\" Other. This act of substitution, this institutionalizing of racist ideology, re-empowered the exclusion movement. The movement was supported by liberal and conservative, capital and labour, Anglo and non-Anglo-American, alike.\n\nMental Instability and the Hybrid “Eurasian”\n\n21The white man is necessarily decent, for he is white. The ‘half-caste’ is indecent because existing in an in-between state. Our Scottish anthropologist again:\n\n31 G. R. Gair, The Liverpool Review Vol IX, No.1 (January 1934) p. 12.\n\nIt is a notorious fact that really hybrid peoples are incapable of stability.... Remember that this, after all, is a biological question, and one only capable of solution in accordance with the known laws of science...mix two races and there is bound to be a falling apart, a crumbling of the national edifice, and just because the iron and clay will not amalgamate. The Eurasian, in his physical aspect alone, provides (even when social disabilities are discounted) an example of the evils arising from racial promiscuity. It is therefore clear that relative purity is something to be desired...\n\n22Here, the ‘physical aspect’, the all too visible in-betweenness of the \"Eurasian,\" is understood as reinforcing the unwelcome nature of hybridity, and its \"evils arising from racial promiscuity”, sexual intercourse between different “races”.\n\n33 The Liverpool Diocesan Review, Vol. X, No. 8 (August 1935), 590.\n\nThe children… speak English, but their mode of thought is Eastern. Their real ego is wrapped in an impenetrable silence, and whilst lips speak, the face is a mask, so different from the spontaneous frankness so delightful in English children.\n\n25Many of the women that Chinese men married were often poor, and many, indeed, were ethnically Irish. Often family reactions were hostile. In America, in 1922, Congress passed the Cable Act removing from a woman her nationality were she to marry an alien Chinese, Korean or Japanese. In Britain the immigration laws were just as severe. A woman forfeited her citizenship by marrying a foreigner and was required to register as an alien. This legislative, bureaucratic transformation of the white woman into an alien was a means of resolving the problem of hybridity by means of a legal sleight of hand. Women who married Chinese men simply found themselves excluded from the national body. Their deliberate act of joining themselves to an alien, this act of being “UnAmerican” or \"unEnglish\" was punished by excision from the white body, which was thus saved from contamination.\n\n36 The National Archives of the UK (TNA), HO 213/926 C491519 \"Note of Meeting held at Home Office Oct. (...)\n\nThe purpose of the meeting was to discuss the repatriating the Chinese seamen onshore at Liverpool. Mr. Holmes [Immigration Officer, Liverpool] said that there were altogether 2,000 Chinese seamen there….That they were an undesirable element in Liverpool was shown by the fact that in the last three years there had been 1,000 convictions for opium smoking and 350 convictions for gaming among the Chinese. Over half were suffering from V.D. [venereal disease] and half from T.B. [tuberculosis]. The Liverpool authorities were anxious to secure the use of the housing accommodation which the Chinese occupied.\n\n27Gambling, drug addiction, licentiousness leading to sexually transmitted disease, and endemic sickness are all mentioned in this Home Office minute. It builds up, insidiously but seemingly irrefutably, a picture of a contagious, “undesireable element” that needed to be removed.\n\n32The recently arrived, the newest strangers, are regarded with most suspicion, as most different, as most unclean, as the dirtiest. They are also, as are the refugees and asylum seekers in present-day Europe and the United States, the most vulnerable."
