This concern was nurtured by the need to regulate artistic production through the establishment of specific norms and values, and, at the same time, it was intricately linked to the promotion of the artist's status and the legitimization of the artistic profession. The articulation of theoretical discourse in the academies took place mainly in the framework of conferences among peers - by and for an elite of peers - where multiple alternating voices could engage in fruitful debate. However, towards the end of the eighteenth and during the early nineteenth century the plurivocal structure of the conferences was, in many cases, gradually replaced by actual courses offered by a unique professor. Along with practical training, courses of history, archaeology, art history, art theory and aesthetics were systematically incorporated into the academic curricula in the context of larger pedagogical and institutional reforms. This is the period in which Ancient Régime artistic structures were reformed, while new art schools were created, and the academic system of art education expanded in the recently founded nation-states of Europe and the Americas.\n\nA series of questions arise from this development. Whereas courses in art theory and aesthetics could be seen as a further pursuing of old concerns, courses in art history were less expected. Why did artists need to study the history of art? Engagement with the art of the past was certainly a salient aspect of academic training, through the copying of art works of antiquity or of the Old Masters. But what did this new kind of knowledge on past art - scholarly, systematized, often with a claim to exhaustivity, codified in a course - have to contribute to artistic practice? What were the artistic, political or economic grounds for the utterly novel claim that art has a history, and this history has to be taught to artists? Another major issue related to the introduction of scholarly courses in the art school has to do with the fact that artists seem to gradually abandon the control over the discourse produced on art to non-practitioners, to scholars who form gradually a community of professional specialists. In this regard, how was the introduction of art history courses in this particular moment related to the arising discipline of art history?\n\nI will focus here on the case of nineteenth-century Greece and the scholarly teaching offered in the Athenian School of Arts, the first art institution of the country, founded in 1837. The development of art institutions in Greece followed very different trajectories from those observed in most western European countries. The inception of the Greek art world coincides with the creation of an independent Greek State, in 1830, in a small territory sliced from the Ottoman Empire. The very notions of 'fine arts' and the 'artist' actually had no equivalent in the Greek-speaking world of the Ottoman Empire. These categories, and the cultural practices to which they are linked, were shaped mainly through the foundation of a state institution, the School of Arts, a development that had a lasting impact on the conception both of artistic activity and the role of the artist. The interest of the Greek case lies precisely in the fact that it represents a new art world formation, where all the fundamental questions around the social production of art had to be thought anew. Constructed almost ex nihilo, the Greek art world may be envisaged as a kind of historical laboratory, permitting one to observe the very institution of practices and concepts that one often tends to naturalise (or let their historical specificity be blended away by anachronisms).\n\nThe founding of the School of Arts, and more generally the creation of an artistic culture in Greece, was the outcome of a complex set of cultural transfers: the School introduced art education based on Western European models that were mediated by foreign professors and Greeks who had studied abroad, particularly in Italy, France and Germany. In this process various European practices and discourses were appropriated, combined and reshaped to confront the particularities and needs of the local context. This is particularly the case with scholarly teaching, which had a rather uneasy and discontinuous presence in the curriculum of an institution intended to accommodate not only artistic studies, but also technical education. Two significant moments in this fragmentary history of scholarly teaching in the School can be singled out: one spanning from the formation of the institution to the 1860s, and a second one covering the last two decades of the century. Each of them provides interesting insights into the particular nature, goals and implications of this new type of scholarly study of art proposed to trainee artists. During the first phase, on which I will mainly concentrate here, the study of ancient Greek art was an exclusive, ideologically informed focus: interestingly, though, the approach to ancient art developed within the School took a quite different orientation in comparison with the way this very exclusive field was studied during the same period within the Athenian University. During the second phase, starting in the 1880s, new orientations arose in scholarly training not only in terms of an expanded temporal and geographical scope beyond Greek antiquity, but also in the ways of understanding artistic activity and its values.\n\nStudying the scholarly training in the Greek art school and its 'laundering' of various European art discourses, I was brought to realise that this particularly stimulating object has remained a kind of blind spot of research, lying as it is in the intersection of two fields, the history of art education and the history of art history. Before departing on my analysis of the Greek case, I may be permitted here a few programmatic observations on the heuristic interest of this neglected topic for both these fields. The study of scholarly courses, and more particularly of art historical courses, offered in the art school may permit, on the one hand, a re-evaluation of artistic training in the nineteenth century, and, on the other, a better understanding of the varied institutional groundings of the discipline of art history.\n\nDespite the extensive literature on art academies and the renewed perspectives on the history of nineteenth-century art education,1 art history and other scholarly courses taught at the academies remain largely overlooked. The names of the professors or the courses' titles may be known, but the actual content of the courses is ignored, as is, more importantly, their potential impact on artistic practice. While the official conferences of art academies have attracted important scholarly interest,2 the systematization of scholarly training in the nineteenth century has not yet found its specialists.\n\nThe implicit prejudice here - informed by the hierarchical and tense relations between theory and practice - is most probably that scholarly courses are of minor significance in the history of art education. Overcoming this kind of prejudice may help revise dominant conceptions regarding the institutions of art education in the nineteenth century. Often considered as rigid and conservative due to their practical curricula, these institutions could be seen under a different light if one focuses on their scholarly curricula. I argue that precisely these courses provided, in many cases, a locus of reflexivity within established academic traditions, where academic principles, values and norms could be reassessed or even severely questioned.\n\nScholars appointed as professors at the academies were often the driving forces of institutional reforms, and contributed not only to the remodelling of practical training, but also to the revision of its theoretical underpinnings. Franz Kugler's (1808-1858) role in the context of the reforms of the Berlin Akademie in the 1840s is paradigmatic in this regard.3 Unlike eighteenth-century conferences, scholarly courses were usually offered by outsiders from various academic fields, who operated within different disciplinary protocols and thus were less bound to academic doctrines, which they were ready to look at from a fresh and, in any case, different external perspective. Hippolyte Taine provides a very good and well-studied example.4 Elsewhere I had the opportunity to check this hypothesis in detail, based on the case of Stylianos Konstantinidis, who taught art history and aesthetics at the Athenian School of Arts from 1879 to 1896 - the second phase referred to earlier. His courses on aesthetics in particular were mainly informed by the work of the French theorist Eugène Véron (1825-1889), one of the pioneers of scientific aesthetics in France. Adopting Véron's positivistic outlook, Konstantinidis rejected artistic laws derived a priori, and sought to provide artists with 'scientific' ones, based solely on the functioning of human perception and feeling as established by new research in the fields of physiology and experimental psychology. His teachings severely undermined the normative character of ancient art upon which academic authority was founded until then, while at the same time his emphasis on the values of individuality and artistic originality, leitmotifs in Vérons' texts, brought into question the dominant regime of evaluating artistic activity, based on an ideal of 'national conformity' both in terms of stylistic choices (the paradigm of ancient art) and subject matter (Greek subjects).5\n\nThe teaching of art history in art academies has also remained overlooked within the constantly expanding field of art historiography, athough accounts of the institutionalisation and professionalisation of the discipline6 are still rather minor in relation to the study of discourses and the formation of various interpretative schemes and methodologies, or to biographical accounts, which privilege influential art historians. Focusing mainly on the university and the museum, scholarship tends to neglect the role of academies and art schools. Nonetheless, art academies count among the first (in some cases, they are indeed the first) institutional homes of art history, and played an important role in the shaping of the discipline well before the establishment of autonomous university chairs. In Berlin, for instance, twenty years before the foundation of the University in 1810, or some forty years before the foundation of the public museum in 1830, the Akademie der bildenden Künste was the only institution to offer regular courses on ancient art, taught by Karl Philipp Moritz (1756-1793) and later by Aloys Hirt (1759-1837).7 The primacy of the art school in the institutionalization of the discipline was arguably the case in France, where courses on art history and aesthetics were first introduced in the Parisian École des Beaux-arts after the major reform of 1863 (taught by Eugène Viollet le Duc, Hippolyte Taine and later Eugène Müntz).8 The same phenomenon is also observed in more recent art world formations, such as in the Academia Imperial de Belas Artes in Rio de Janeiro, where the major painter and scholar Pedro Américo (1843-1905) was the first to teach art history courses (along with archaeology and aesthetics) in the early 1870s.9 Taking academies into consideration may thus help to grasp better the multiple institutional frameworks involved in the formation of the discipline.\n\nArt academies were multi-facetted, hybrid institutions in which various (sometimes competing) intentions, actors, and publics came together. One could argue more particularly that academies lay at the intersection of the artistic and the scientific field. As training centres, as well as competition and exhibition venues, academies functioned as instances of consecration within the artistic field. At the same time, academies produced an historical and theoretical knowledge on art, and hosted in their curricula a variety of fields - history, art history, aesthetics, archaeology and classics, or even literature - that, precisely during the first half of the nineteenth century, were shaping their disciplinary identities and negotiating their boundaries.\n\nA key question in this perspective is to examine to what extent and in which ways this particular institutional location affected art historical discourses produced within its walls. I refer to it as a particular location in the sense that it provided a direct contact with art practitioners as well as an exposure to the problems of art practice and the concerns about the character and the quality of contemporary artistic production.10 Did adapting to the needs of art training generate different kind of objects, methods, focuses, and ultimately a different kind of scholarship in comparison to that produced in universities or museums? How did art scholars adapt their approaches and teaching methods to art students as opposed to university audiences? Finally, what synergies, interactions or tensions are nurtured by this proximity between scholarly discourses and art practice?\n\nI will subsequently try to approach this series of questions by focusing on the Athenian School of Arts. I will explore the objectives, ideological implications and tensions underlying the very introduction of, and the specific orientation given to, scholarly courses from the 1840s to the 1860s. A course on 'History of the arts' was introduced to the curriculum in 1844, taught by the historian and philologist Grigorios Papadopoulos (1818-1873). Papadopoulos, who remained in the post until 1863, based his teaching mostly on Karl Otfried Müllers' Handbuch der Archäologie der Kunst (1830), a work of seminal significance for the nascent discipline of archaeology. I will examine first under which conditions and against which other scholarly traditions this particular model was privileged. Subsequently, I will turn to the various operations through which Papadopoulos seeks to adapt an archaeological manual to the needs of artistic training. His hesitations, choices and proposed solutions allow one to grasp the fecundity and dynamics of this instituting moment - even when, or rather precisely when, these solutions were not meant to last. As we shall see, under his initiative, the study of ancient art was conducted for much of the century under a concept that did not survive in Greek language after the first decades of the twentieth century.\n\nDuring Papadopoulos's tenure in the School, Karl Otfried Müller's Handbuch also informed teaching on ancient art at the University of Athens. In the last part of the paper, I will address this double institutional appropriation of Müller's work in Greece, and I will point to the differentiation of practices and approaches between the university and the art school. In my overall analysis, I will try to show that adapting the scholarly study of art to the needs of artistic training gave way to approaches primarily centred on objects, techniques and forms, rather than on the construction of historical narratives and continuities; that is, approaches that privileged systematic classification rather than chronological organization, and which neglected historical contextualisation.\n\nThe Athenian School of Arts: some elements of the context\n\nThe 'Royal School of Arts', as was its official title, was founded in Athens in 1837, the same year as the establishment of the University. Mostly referred to as the 'Polytechnic', the School was initially conceived as a technical school for the formation of craftsmen and builders, in response to the urgent construction needs of the new capital of the Kingdom. It introduced artistic education only six years later, with the institutional reform of 1843; thereafter, the establishment was divided into two departments, the school of fine arts and the school of mechanical or industrial arts, along with a Sunday school for the training of working craftsmen. The two orientations of the School, artistic and technical, were in constant tension throughout the century, echoing larger debates on the modernisation and the economic development of the country.11 From 1844 to 1862, under the directorship of Lysandros Caftanzoglou (1811-1885), one of the most prominent Greek architects in the nineteenth century,12 the artistic studies in the School were significantly enhanced. A fervent classicist who trained at the Academy of Saint-Luke in Rome, Caftanzoglou aspired to elevate the institution to the level of a fully-fledged fine arts academy, introducing annual competitions and exhibitions, and initiating a tradition of official discourses, which he used to deliver at the inauguration of exhibitions in solemn public ceremonies, honoured by the King himself.13\n\nGrigorios Papadopoulos (fig. 1) was a precious collaborator in Caftanzoglou's endeavour. He was appointed Professor of the 'History of Visual Arts' in October 184414 - an unpaid interim to his main position as Professor of History at the only high school of the capital, granted to him a few months earlier.15 Before arriving in the new Kingdom upon the invitation of Prime Minister Alexandros Mavrokordatos, Papadopoulos had studied in Paris from 1836 to 1839, taking courses in philosophy, history and classics at the Sorbonne and the Collège de France - although he did not obtain a formal degree.16 In 1839 he was appointed in the service of the Ruler of Wallachia Alexandros Gkikas (1790-1862), as his personal secretary and tutor to his sons and his niece Eleni Gkika, who was to become the famous woman of letters Dora d'Istria. In Bucharest, Papadopoulos also served as high school teacher and bureaucrat involved in major reforms of the educational system in the Hegemonies. Following the fall of Gkikas, the young erudite accompanied him in Dresden, where he spent two years from 1842 to 1844 before coming to Athens.\n\nLike Caftanzoglou, Papadopoulos was descended from a wealthy merchant family of Thessaloniki that was dispersed during the war against the Ottomans in the 1820s. After fleeing and studying abroad, with financial support from relatives, they both chose to establish themselves in the new state and join forces, as did many Greeks educated abroad, in the collective enterprise of reconstructing the country after the war, an enterprise largely felt as a national regeneration. It is possible that the first contact between the two future collaborators came in Paris, where Caftanzoglou sojourned for a year after his studies in Rome. The two men were the driving forces of the School of Arts until the 1860s, and played a prominent role in the shaping of the Greek art world, establishing the values and orientations of the nascent artistic production in the new kingdom.\n\nFrom a universal history for artists to the study of ancient art\n\nThe statutes of 1843 that introduced artistic studies in the School did not include scholarly courses in the curriculum of the fine arts department. The course of 'History of Visual Arts' ('...'), as it was initially referred to in the School documents,17 was introduced on the initiative of Caftanzoglou, quite possibly in consultation with Papadopoulos. But what exactly lay underneath this intriguing title? In the first, rather allusive, reference to the content of the course, one reads about a 'history of the arts' with particular emphasis on the study of mythology, customs and costumes 'with regard to the works of the artists'.18 Papadopoulos repeatedly stressed that such a course was an indispensable part of the curricula of art institutions: 'History, what concerns [...] the costumes of the ancients and mythology are taught everywhere, in every artistic School'.19 'Storia, mitologia e costumi' was indeed the title of the course taught by the antiquarian Giusseppe Antonio Guattani (1748-1930) at the Accademia di San Luca in Rome20 - a major reference for the Athenian School during Caftanzoglou's tenure. During his lengthy period of studies at the Roman academy from 1824 to 1836 (starting at the age of thirteen), the Greek architect may himself have had the possibility to attend or take notice of Guattani's courses offered from 1812 to 1830.\n\nWhatever the precise model Papadopoulos had in mind, he points to a well-established tradition of scholarly teaching in art academies that remains extremely understudied to this date. This 'history of arts' is rather a history for the arts: a kind of universal history seeking to provide artists with the necessary documentation and pragmatic knowledge for their historical, religious and mythological compositions, which stood traditionally at the top of the academic hierarchy of genres. Without this type of knowledge, as Papadopoulos observes, recycling the typical rhetoric of relevant publications from the eighteenth century onwards, the painter risked representing 'the twelve apostles with helmets [...], Alexander as a barbed Skythian', and was liable 'to plant olive trees in Siberia or to dress Helen as Cleopatra, Caesar as Achilles, Peter the Great as Charlemagne'.21\n\nThis tradition dates back to the mid-eighteenth century and to the lectures of the academician, painter and scholar Michel-François Dandré Bardon (1700-1783) at the École Royale des élèves protégés in Paris, on which Guattani himself was drawing.22 Professeur pour l'histoire, la fable et la géographie from 1755 until the suppression of the school in 1775, Dandré-Bardon had published extensively for his own teaching purposes: the multi-volume Histoire Universelle, traité relativement aux arts de peindre et de sculpter (Paris, 1769, 3 vols), and the fully illustrated Costume des anciens peuples, à l'usage des artistes (Paris, 1772-1774, 2 vols) (fig. 2).23 ?he notion of 'costume' that figures in the title of this latter publication had indeed a very precise meaning in the academic artistic vocabulary, covering not only clothing, but the general historical setting: 'Costume, in the art of painting, is called what proper decorum demands from history painters in terms of the customs of different periods, the morals of nations and the nature of places'24 - a broad term which refered also to the natural environment, hence Papadopoulos's reference to 'olives trees in Siberia'.\n\nIn Rome, Guattani began his courses with the biblical Creation, continuing with the basic episodes of the Bible, before turning to various ancient peoples, including Egyptians, Phoenicians, Persians, Scythians, Sarmats, Greeks and Romans. An overview of the major events of 'sacred and profane history' was accompanied by detailed descriptions of their ways of life, manners and customs, myths, beliefs and allegorical systems, political constitution and warfare as well as their clothing and gear, based on ancient sources, both textual and visual.25 A similar logic seems to have prevailed at the École des Beaux-arts in Paris, where Alfred Jarry de Mancy (1796-1862) - professor of history in secondary education, just like Papadopoulos - occupied the first chair of 'Histoire et Antiquités', from 1829 to 1862.26\n\nThis kind of universal history for art students seems to have been the first type of systematic scholarly training offered in art academies from the mid-eighteenth century, with a view to reinforcing the erudite tradition of history painting.27 This type of course existed well into the nineteenth century, even if both the study of history and the understanding of history painting had in the meantime drastically evolved, transforming at the same time the approaches of the professors. It is particularly revealing in this regard to compare Guattani's outlook with the recently documented case of Ernst Guhl's (1819-1862) teaching at the Berlin Academy, and particularly his 'Geschichtskunde', introduced to the curriculum in 1859.28 While Guattani's Storia was rooted in the universal history of the seventeenth century and the antiquarian tradition of the eighteenth, Guhl's approach was marked by the disciplinarisation of history within the German university and the development of cultural history.29 Concerning history painting, most importantly, the emphasis on biblical and mythological subjects, as well as on ancient history, had given way to the introduction of the modern and contemporary subject, and the promotion of national history painting, coupled with shared concerns among painters and historians on the very nature and the problems of historical representation.30\n\nPapadopoulos's outlook is closer to Guattani than to Guhl. The young Greek professor seems at first to orient himself towards this model, and announces a cycle to be completed within two or three years.31 ?he exact content and scope of the course during this inaugural period is uncertain, although a brief historical overview contained in his inaugural lecture of 1844 allows us to assume that he most probably remained within the horizon of Antiquity.32 The first two years of Papadopoulos's lectures were rather experimental in character, as he strove to calibrate the needs and lacunas of a large and heterogeneous audience composed of School students but also of an almost equal number of free attendees, mostly high school and university students - reportedly around 200 in total in 1845.33\n\nHowever, starting from the academic year 1846-1847, his teaching takes a more systematic character and a new orientation, which would lead him away from what he saw as the common European practices in artistic scholarly education. In his inaugural lesson of 1846, Papadopoulos claims indeed that the example of European academies should not be followed to the letter, given particular local needs and, most importantly, the country's special ties to Greek Antiquity. As he observes, he would not focus 'simply' on the costume of the ancients; he intended to offer an in-depth treatment of ancient Greek art and, through it, of ancient Greek civilisation as a whole.34 Working through a first experimental phase, Papadopoulos ended up with little interest in a universal history of ancient peoples. His objective was rather the study of the country's own past, an ideal of knowledge for which he coins the term ... (study or knowledge of Greece), inaugurating thus a long series of neologisms with which he would bestow the Greek language, as we shall see further on.35\n\nThe redefinition of Papadopoulos's teaching programme led to the creation of two different courses; while during the first two years of his tenure he taught only once a week, on Sundays,36 from the academic year 1846-1847 onwards he teaches Kallitechniologia - a term coined by Papadopoulos to replace the previous 'history of the arts' - and Artistic Mythology, each for two hours weekly.37 As he announces in this inaugural lecture of 1846,38 the new teaching program covered in his two courses would be based on the Handbuch der Archäologie der Kunst (1830, 2nd ed. 1835) by Karl Otfried Müller (1797-1840), one of the most polymathic classical scholars of the nineteenth century (fig. 3).39 Abandoning the already outdated antiquarian logic of Guattani, Papadopoulos was turning himself toward the robust, internationally renowned German model of Altertumswissenschaft. This was already the main orientation of the small community of scholars formed in the capital around the philosophical faculty of the Athenian University, the professors (philologists and historians) of which were almost exclusively trained in Germany.40 Putting aside the example of institutions of art education, Papadopoulos would draw his models and resources from university practices, both local and foreign.\n\nAn archaeological manual for artistic training\n\nKarl Otfried Müller and the Greeks, ancient and modern\n\nProfessor at the University of Göttingen from 1819 to 1840, Karl Otfried Müller was a leading figure of the second generation of scholars that consolidated the project of a scientific study of Antiquity rooted in the thought of Wilhelm von Humboldt and systematised through the writings of Friedrich August Wolf and August Boeckh's teaching in the University of Berlin.41 Müller's innovative contributions in various fields, such as ancient Greek history, religion, mythology, literature, or the arts, were largely informed by a holistic and organic conception of Antiquity, seeking to understand the life of ancient societies in its totality. Papadopoulos's ??????µ??e?a was precisely shaped by this approach.\n\nFormed in the spirit of Boeckh's Sachphilologie in Berlin,42 Müller's endeavour accorded a privileged role to material remnants of the past along with written sources, which were traditionally predominant in the study of the ancient world. In his studies, and particularly in his teaching at the University of Göttingen, Müller manifested a special interest in archaeology, precisely at a time when it started growing into an independent field among the different disciplines of Altertumswissenschaft. Müller was indeed one of the rare philologists to propose courses in archaeology,43 following here a Göttingen tradition which began with Christian Gottlob Heyne's lectures in the second half of the eighteenth century and pursued shortly after by Müller's immediate predecessor, Friedrich Welcker, before the latter's migration to the newly founded university of Bonn.44 The Handbuch der Archäologie der Kunst (fig. 4), composed for his lectures, constitutes the first complete survey of ancient art, and had a tremendous influence on the teaching of archaeology in Germany and beyond.45 Reprinted many times throughout the century and translated into French (1841), Italian (1844-1845) and English (1847), the handbook became the new reference on ancient art, replacing the authority of Winckelmann's Geschichte der Kunst des Altertums (1764), which served until then as the seminal text on the subject.46\n\nThe reception of Müller's work in Greece was extremely early and had a great impact on the shaping of archaeology in the Athenian University, which established as early as 1837 a chair for the discipline. The ... [Handbook of the archaeology of the arts] (1841) by Ludwig Ross (1806-1859), first occupant of the chair, is a Greek adaptation47 of Müller's manual, upon which Ross founded his teaching from 1839 on.48 However, Müller's reception in Greece was not primarily due to Ross's mediation. The Göttingen professor's tenacious defence of the cultural autarchy of ancient Greek civilisation against the idea of an Egyptian or Oriental influence49 made him one of the most popular foreign scholars in the young Kingdom. Müller perceived indeed ancients societies as closed entities anchored in a specific natural and geographical environment, a vision fully informed by a historicist and organicist conception of nation.50 He thus turned to the study of the Greek peoples (Stämme) in the different regions of Greece, which he considered as the 'Hauptglieder in dem Organismus des Hellenischen Nationallebens' ['main members in the organism of hellenic national life'].51 This outlook is found already in nuce in Müller's doctoral dissertation dedicated to the island of Aegina (Aegineticorum liber, 1817), and is further pursued with Orchomenos und die Minyer (1820) and Die Dorier (1824), first volumes of the ambitious series Geschichten hellenischer Stämme et Städte, which he never managed to complete.\n\nThe absolute centrality accorded to the Greeks in the study of the ancient world accounted largely for Müller's popularity in the newly established State. Along with Ross, other university professors also drew on the German scholar's work, such as Konstantinos Schinas (1801-1870), the first Rector of the university (and son-in-law of the famous law professor Karl Friedrich von Savigny), who explicitly followed Müller's teaching model in his own 'Life of Greece, or Greek archaeology' from 1837 to 1847. 52 Besides, many high placed officials in the Greek administration and education were among his audience in Göttingen.53 Most importantly, Müller's long-planned journey to Greece and his sudden death only four months after his arrival, in 1840, had turned him into a kind of philhellenic hero. He fell ill during his work at the site of Delphi and died on his return trip to Athens; he was buried with full honours on the Hippeios Colonus hilltop, in a ceremony organised by the professors of the University of Athens. 54 Six years after Müller's death, Papadopoulos would evoke his 'great and philhellenic spectre' hovering over the hill, inciting the young Greeks to 'recover ancestral art'.55 This was precisely the project underlying his teaching, and more generally the orientation of the School of Arts under Caftanzoglou's tenure.\n\nKallitechniologia: a new word, a new field of knowledge\n\nThe appropriation of Müller's manual by Papadopoulos is first of all mediated by the creation of a term that establishes a new field of knowledge. The term ... (Kallitechniologia) is composed of the words ... (fine arts) and ... (discourse). According to Papadopoulos's definition, it covers the totality of 'theoretical and practical' knowledge necessary for the study of architecture, sculpture and painting, and their subordinate branches.56 Kallitechniologia examines the materials, techniques, artistic genres as well as the theoretical principles that govern the arts. In today's terms, it could be understood as a kind of practical art theory. The Greek teacher models the term Kallitechniologia upon the word ... (technology), which means, 'in European languages', 'the practical and theoretical knowledge of the arts, and particularly the industrial arts (...)'.57 In order to conceive a similar kind of knowledge for the fine arts, Papadopoulos proposes the term kallitechniologia. However, he limits his teaching to the artistic practices of Greek antiquity, and speaks particularly of a 'Greek Kallitechniologia'.58\n\nPapadopoulos divides Kallitechniologia into two main parts. The first part concerns architecture, and examines 'building materials, artistic and geometrical forms, architectural members, orders and types of buildings'.59 In a second outline of the course, dated from 1857, Papadopoulos adds to this part the study of furniture and vases, what he terms ..., stressing thus the artistic qualities of these artefacts.60 In this grouping, Papadopoulos follows Müller's encompassing category of tectonics (Tektonik), used to qualify buildings (Gebäude, Architektonik), furniture and utensils (Geräthe und Gefässe).61\n\nThe second part of Kallitechniologia is dedicated to ... (image-making arts), which corresponds to what Müller terms Bildende Kunst, and covers the various branches of plastic arts, drawing and painting. These arts are studied under two perspectives: on the one hand, the ... [mechanische Technik, mechanical technics], that is, 'the procedures and material means through which images, statues, etc. are created'; 62 on the other hand, the ... [optische Technik, optical technics], which approaches 'the principles of human figuration of the Greeks, the study of character and expression, as well as the different costumes of Greeks and Romans'.63 In a manuscript note found in Papadopoulos's archives, the content of ... also includes the study of different kinds of perspective, proportions, treatment of the body, expressions, gestures and drapery.64 The study of plastic arts and painting thus concerns both the media and the techniques, as well as the overall principles of figuration and composition.\n\nInitiator of a new field -the first to try to establish it in Greece, as he repeatedly stresses65 -, the scholar is eager to define its limits and relations with other branches of knowledge. He expounds in length the prospective contributions of Kallitechniologia to a large variety of fields, including history, philology, the study of religion and public life of the ancients, art history and aesthetics,66 offering thus a vivid image of the forming constellation of the humanities in Greece. Let me cite him here referring to the fields that are immediately related to the study of art, such as art history and aesthetics: 'Kallitechniologia is a learning extremely profitable to art history, since how can one approach the temple, for instance, while ignoring its parts and the relation of each part to the whole, and how can one understand artistic progress, while ignoring how each of these parts was gradually transformed'.67 It seems that, for Papadopoulos, Kallitechniologia proposes a close technical knowledge of the monuments, while the task of art history is to place them in a historical sequence of stylistic evolution, a conception that points most probably to Winckelmann's system, the inner logic of which, despite their differences in periodisation and structure, was preserved in Müller's manual.68\n\nAs for the contribution of 'Greek Kallitechniologia' to aesthetics, it lies in the fact that 'the principles [of Greek art] are not arbitrary or drawn on contingencies; they are based on positive and aesthetic relations, and this is what renders this art positively excellent and universal'.69 The universal validity of the Greek artistic paradigm is a topos constantly reiterated in the discourse of the School. Of interest here is the way aesthetics is conceived: not as the study of aesthetic experience or as a philosophical inquiry into the nature of beauty, but rather as a normative theory of art that extracts 'positive' principles from the most perfect works of art.\n\nArtistic mythology\n\nArtistic mythology is the second weekly course taught by Papadopoulos. As he explains, he uses the term 'artistic mythology' to distinguish his object from the 'theological part' of mythology, which is related to the study of religious doctrines, or from the historical study of myths.70 The object of artistic mythology is the study of the 'ideal types of artistic representation of different mythological and often historical figures'.71 Papadopoulos speaks also of an ...72 of ancient art, which should be understood rather as an iconography that details typical depictions of gods and mythological heroes, but also of historical personalities, politicians, orators, poets, philosophers, etc. The figurative types of ancient art are studied through works in different media, sculptures, bas-reliefs, gems, coins, frescoes, vases, etc.73 According to a manuscript note in Papadopoulos's archives, the mythological subjects examined included the twelve gods of Olympus and various mythological cycles, 'the Dionysian Cycle, the Cycle of Eros, the Cycle of the Muses, etc.'.74 Papadopoulos's intention was also to familiarise students with the myths themselves, combining the study of works of art with the study of texts. In this regard the Greek professor stands closer to Guattani's or Mancy's practices that incorporated the study of texts. Indicative of Papadopoulos's approach are his own iconographical studies on Demosthenes and Theseus, which were based on new findings in Athens (a bust and a stamp seal respectively)75 and were initially presented as lectures in the Ellinikon Ekpaideutirion, the private high school he directed during his time the School of Arts and in which, like Caftanzoglou, he had initiated a tradition of end-of-the-year speeches that often treated artistic subjects.\n\nIn the programmatic presentation of his course in 1846, Papadopoulos insists on the non-rigid character of Greek artistic types: unlike the Egyptian ones, they did not imply a stereotypic mechanical reproduction, but provided for a marge of liberty to the artists' imagination, and even triggered their creativity,76 always though within a given collective horizon defined by religion - the major source of art according to Müller.77 As Müller explains, even if the most successful images of deities were the product of imagination and genius of some exceptional artists, such as Phidias' Zeus,78 they responded above all to the 'general idea that the nation had of the divinity', which 'served as a touchstone of the correctness of representation'.79 It was through this kind of social control and consecration that 'NORMAL IMAGES resulted, to which succeeding artists adhered with lively freedom, and with that correct taste peculiar to the Hellenic nation, which was equally removed from Oriental stiffness and modern egotism [...] All this could take place in such a way only among the Greeks, because in Greece only was art to such an extent a national activity, the Greek nation only a great artist.'80 One of Müller's leading ideas was indeed that art in ancient Greece was above all a national activity, produced collectively rather than by particular individuals. This conception of art as a variation upon collectively elaborated types, and of invention essentially as reinvention, had a lasting impact on the ways of thinking and evaluating artistic activity in the forming Greek art world - a conception that would be put into question only towards the end of the century.\n\nIt is also worth mentioning that Papadopoulos traces a parallel between ancient and Byzantine iconography. Referring to a manuscript held in Mount Athos and 'only recently revealed in Europe', he observes that such types, 'certainly less perfect, were also produced in our religious painting [...] that followed the traces of ancient art'.81 Papadopoulos was indeed one of the first scholars - if not the first -to try to incorporate Byzantine art into the national artistic past, operating under a conception of Greek history as an unbroken continuum comprising the Byzantine era - a conception that would only a decade later be established by official, university-produced historiography. The classicist Caftanzoglou, himself, remained sceptical of Papadopoulos's linking of ancient and byzantine art.82 Despite Papadopoulos's interest in the latter, there is no evidence to suggest that he extended his teaching to the subjects and types of Christian iconography, remaining rather exclusively oriented towards antiquity.\n\nRecasting Müller's approach to ancient art as a practical art theory for the present\n\nThe complex architecture of Papadopoulos's teaching programme draws directly on the second part of Müllers' handbook dedicated to the systematic treatment of ancient art ('Systematische Behandlung der Antike Kunst'). Müller's intention was to compile the totality of current knowledge on ancient art, adopting an almost encyclopaedic outlook. Indicative of this outlook is the manual's combination of two approaches to ancient art: a historical and a systematic one. In the first part of the manual, the German scholar presents the historical evolution of ancient Greek art, divided into five periods. In contrast to Winckelmann he only devotes a concise appendix to the art of ancient peoples 'of non-Greek race' ['Die nicht griechischen Völker'], namely Egyptians, Babylonians and Phoenicians, Persians and the Indians. After a short general introduction to the political, social and intellectual context of each period, Müller separately examines architecture, sculpture and painting, treating the artists and works. The second part of the handbook opens with an exhaustive geographical survey of ancient monuments and of the current repartition of collections of antiquities around Europe. Subsequently Müller undertakes a thorough examination of techniques and forms, and finishes with an iconographical approach to the different subjects of ancient art.\n\nIt is then primarily this second part of the manual, almost double the size of the first, historical part, which interests Papadopoulos (with the exception of the introductory geographical survey). Papadopoulos's artistic mythology draws on Müller's analytical register of the subjects of ancient art. However, while Müller proposes a comprehensive iconography divided into 'mythological subjects', 'subjects from human life' ('historical representations, portraits; religious transactions, agones, war, the chase, country life, economical occupations, domestic and married life, death') and 'subjects from the rest of nature' ('animals and plants, arabesques and landscape, amulets, symbols'), Papadopoulos remains attached primarily to mythological subjects (including, in extremis, historical portraits), and thus to the older tradition of scholarly courses in art academies, where mythology was established as a subject-matter.\n\nConcerning Kallitechniologia, a quick look at the table of contents in Müller's manual shows how closely the Greek professor follows the structure of Müller's analysis of techniques and forms. All the subdivisions of Kallitechniologia previously described, and the neologisms introduced by Papadopoulos such as ... and ..., are directly inspired by the categories and classifications proposed by the German scholar. Nonetheless, based on Müller's analysis of the technics and forms of ancient art, for which the German scholar does not propose any specific overarching term, Papadopoulos moulds the notion of Kallitechniologia and generates a new methodology for the study of the arts, a kind of practical art theory, to which he ascribes a general validity (even though he restrains it, for his teaching, to the study of Greek art).\n\nThe voluminous information gathered by Müller in this section of the manual is intended principally as a means of classifying and interpreting the works of the past. As Müller's colleague Friedrich Welcker explained in his thorough review of the manual published in 1834, adressing in particular the principles of composition and figuration: 'To see art, to appreciate the drawing [...] to grasp easily the expression in countenance, posture, movement, gestures and action, to be able to distinguish the mass of significant signs from the insignificant ones [...], all this corresponds actually to grammatical knowledge and amounts to the necessary propaedeutic and condition of every act of interpretation'.83 Taking as his model philology and the study of texts, Welcker sees in these elements the possibility of a grammar permitting one to read ancient images (die Bilder gleichsam zu lesen) and unravel their meanings. Papadopoulos, on the other hand, uses the same material not only in order to understand the art of the ancients, but also as part of an active learning to be applied by his students, in contemporary artistic practice. In short, he transforms Müller's technical approach into a set of organisational principles and concepts that were meant to guide the nascent artistic production in the Greek Kingdom.\n\nTeaching mode and didactic material\n\nIn his inaugural lecture of 1846, Papadopoulos sets out in a very methodical manner not only the subject and contents of his courses, but also the methods and the pedagogical resources of this teaching. He even discusses the pertinence of different lecturing modes. He expresses his predilection for a declamatory art of teaching (...84), a model that directly evokes the practices in place within the French establishments frequented by Papadopoulos during his studies in Paris, such as the Sorbonne and College de France.85 Papadopoulos conceives his courses as erudite lectures for relaxed listening, and condemns dictation (...) - a widespread practice that many universities administrations tried to forbid86 - that cancels the vivid and oral character of teaching. 87\n\nIn 1844, Papadopoulos had proposed to provide his students with a detailed plan of each lecture, presenting the points that would be developed in this ex cathedra oration, during which the students were supposed to take notes.88 Moreover, students were prompted to present summaries of each lecture, a kind of informal knowledge assessment.89 Thus students were themselves responsible for composing the didactic corpus, a practice intended to develop their writing and synthetic skills and permit them to assimilate the multitude of new terms and concepts necessary to their studies.\n\nVery soon, however, the need for a teaching manual became apparent, in order to assure the coherence and correctness of received knowledge and facilitate the students' learnings. Complying to the lack of available treatises and works in Greek relative to his courses, Papadopoulos took upon himself to compose a handbook based on his lectures, drawing 'on various sources, and above all on the illustrious Müller'.90 The sections treated in each lecture would be presented in autonomous manuscript booklets and put at the disposal of students for copying - the mechanical reproduction of teaching manuals would be systematised in the School only in the 1880s, along with regulations on the professors' obligation to produce teaching handbooks for their courses, mainly in the technical department.91 Papadopoulos also intended to accompany this textual material by illustrated plates (...).\n\nTwo such didactic manuscripts were found in Papadopoulos's archives: one consisting of a general overview entitled 'Summary of Greek Technology' (...), and one dedicated to optical techniques (...).92 The different parts of Kallitechniologia were most probably treated in rotation along the years: in 1862, for instance, as one learns from a newspaper article, the course of Kallitechniologia was limited in Technoptics.93 Structured in numbered paragraphs, the two didactic manuscripts follow Müller's text closely, even though Papadopoulos also often inserts personal observations. Along with the two manuscripts, I traced an illustrated compendium for architecture, to which I will return later. Unlike Ross at the University, Papadopoulos did not produce a printed manual for his course, but, as shown here, he did try to propose a systematised corpus of knowledge to his students.\n\nIllustrating the lectures: from graphic plates to the originals\n\nImages played a central role in Papadopoulos's teaching approach. Both for his course of Kallitechniologia and for Artistic Mythology, he dedicated a separate part of the lecture to the 'interpretation of plates', that is, the analysis of the visual material necessary for the comprehension of the more theoretical part of the course.94 Papadopoulos announced a visual corpus including 'building plans, representations of different monuments, sculptures, vases, etc.'.95 He insisted on the fundamental importance of this practice, without which 'teaching becomes almost useless, particularly for artists'.96 Moreover, he encouraged the students to draw copies of the objects and works he was commenting on. 97 The expression 'with demonstration and interpretation of plates' that systematically accompanied the titles and announcements of his courses implies that the practice was definitely worth mentioning and possibly an attraction for the public.\n\nLudwig Ross was the first in Greece to make use of visual material for his lectures at the University in 1839-1840,98 importing a practice already established in Germany.99 Papadopoulos, who was not in Athens during Ross's rather short tenure (1837-1844), had eventually made the experience of such an image-based lecturing during his studies in Paris. In his widely renowned lectures at the Bibliothèque Royale, the Conservator of the Cabinet des antiques et médailles Désirée Raoul-Rochette (1790-1854), close friend and correspondent both of Müller and Ross, made a wide use of graphic illustrations as well as frequent references to Müller's manual.100 It is also possible that the first contact of Papadopoulos with Müller's work dates from this period. As his writings indicate, Papadopoulos's reception of the manual seems to have been exclusively based on its French translation of 1841-1842.101 The French translation was also the one cited by Caftanzoglou in the published versions of his annual official discourses. The reception of the manual in the School was thus mediated through the French prism, whereas in the University the reference was rather the German original.\n\nGiven the substantial reliance of Papadopoulos on Müller's work, one can assume that the illustrated plates he used for his teaching were drawn from Müller's picture compendium Denkmäler der alten Kunst (1832), composed in collaboration with his colleague at the University of Göttingen, the painter Carl Oesterley (1805-1891), to accompany the manual.102 This was a widely influential album, which, like the manual itself, was also repeatedly re-edited and completed103 and which informed, for instance, in many ways Franz Kugler's similar endeavour for his Handbuch der Kunstgeschichte.104 Müller's album was present in the Library of the Athenian School of Arts.105 However, the iconographic material compounded by Müller in 1832 (and completed in 1835) covered only the first historical part of the manual; illustrations pertaining to the systematic treatment of architecture, plastic and graphic arts or the iconography of ancient art were not planned.106 Nonetheless, the organisation of the iconographical material related to this first historical part followed a multi-layered scheme, where a set of at least four overlapping principles of classification can be observed: chronology, artists, media, and subject. The tables follow the overall chronological division of ancient art in five periods; within each period, illustrations are organised by medium (sculptures, painted vases, engraved gems, coins), or material ('works in metal'), but also often by subject-matter cutting across media (representations of gods, kings, monarchs, other historical or mythological figures, personifications of cities, etc.). In certain periods, the visual material is also organised by artists or schools - for instance, Lysippus' sculptures. But within such classifications, works are grouped iconographically rather than chronologically. Thus, tables like the ones grouping together representations of Hercules or Alexander the Great, across various media, based on types fixed by Lysippus (fig. 5, 6) could definitely be of use for Papadopoulos in his treatment of artistic mythology.\n\nWithin this visual maze, architecture is totally absent,107 even though it is treated in Müller's historical narrative - Müller was in fact the first to integrate architecture into the archaeological study of ancient art, a choice that functioned paradigmatically for the subsequent development of Kunstarchäologie in the nineteenth century.108 Müller's lack of familiarisation with the actual monuments seems to meet its limits here. His studies at the University of Breslau and then in Berlin had little prepared him for teaching on ancient art, a task he had to face upon his appointment at the University of Göttingen, at the age of twenty-two. Seeking to enrich his knowledge and nourish his teaching, he travelled to study collections of antiquities first in Dresden, immediately after his appointment, in autumn 1819, and three years later in Great Britain - primarily for the Parthenon marbles -, Holland and France.109 Nonetheless, his trip to Italy and Greece, where architectural monuments were mainly preserved, was to be eventually made only in 1840, after more than twenty years of research and teaching. Müller's unease in providing architectural illustrations, but also, more largely, his very narrative in the manual itself, reveals a rather philological and text-based approach to ancient works and monuments. Besides, the characteristic pure line engravings of the picture compendium point to a comprehension of the works of art primarily as iconographical motifs rather than real objects, embodied in material media. Deprived of volumes and shadows, flattened up on the page surface, the depicted works evoke a kind of image-language, an image-script to be read out, as Welcker suggested.\n\nFor Papadopoulos, on the contrary, the works in their very materiality and the monuments themselves were of seminal importance - and, what is more, at his immediate reach. The Greek professor complied with the lack of representations for architecture in Müller's compendium, by compounding his own plates for the study of this important first part of Kallitechniologia; 110 he also used the collection of casts of ancient sculptures held in the School for the illustration of his lectures,111 as did Müller with the important collection of the Göttingen University.112 Thirdly, and most importantly, he sought to familiarise his students with the original works and monuments of Athens, by implementing a tight programme of educational excursions. For the year 1846-1847, he planned visits to the Acropolis, the Theseion (fig. 7) and the Monument of Lysikrates, in order to study architecture as well as the statues and bas-reliefs conserved there (Theseion and different buildings on the Acropolis functioned in the period as the first museums of the capital113). Due to the unfortunate loss of the great works of ancient Greek painters,114 painting would be studied mainly through the decorated vases held in various collections in Athens and Piraeus.115 It is important to note that this reliance on vase painting implies a rather graphic conception of the discipline: during this period the term normally used for painting was ..., a word that evokes the idea of drawing, rather than ... or ..., the term which was finally consecrated in language.\n\nPapadopoulos's intention to illustrate his lectures using the plaster casts held in the School is also significant. The cast collection comprised copies of works held in leading European museums, such as the Archaeological Museum of Naples, the Louvre and the British Museum, and was funded mainly through donations, thanks to the initiatives and networking of Caftanzoglou,116 who strove to introduce in Greece the canon of ancient sculpture as it was established in the academic tradition. The casts were primarily intended for the drawing classes of the School, particularly the classes of drawing from the round, termed in Greek as ... (literaly: drawing from statues). Discussing the casts in his lectures, Papadopoulos incorporated the models that the students were prompted to copy in their daily drawing exercises into a larger framework of knowledge. His teaching therefore offered an essential complement to practical training, and was centred on the works themselves, in a progression from two-dimensional graphic representations to three-dimensional copies, and finally to the originals.\n\n'Along with the things, the names': the creation of an artistic terminology\n\nAnother key objective of Papadopoulos's educational programme was the consolidation of an artistic terminology, a need particularly felt in Greece, while 'unknown', as he observes, 'in the wise Europe'.117 During the first decades of State formation, and in the context of the thorny 'language question',118 the lack of specialized technical terms was extremely acute along various fields of the public and private domain, including administration, law, education, army, communications, transports or commerce. This was particularly true for the domain of the arts.\n\nNot long before Papadopoulos took up teaching in the School, Stephanos Koumanoudis (1818-1899), particularly sensitive to the question of words - a future University professor and the historian par excellence of modern Greek neologisms at the end of the century -, was already facing the problem of vocabulary while translating into Greek two essays by Winckelmann in 1843 - an endeavour that marked the beginnings of art literature in the new state. In his preface, the young Koumanoudis pertinently summarized the main aspects of the problem: complete lack of words, lack of consensus on the meaning of available terms, inappropriateness of ancient words to describe modern practices.119 Papadopoulos introduced another dimension, evocative of the ideological and national claims connected to language: he pointed to the invasion of foreign 'barbaric' words into the Greek vocabulary. Apparently he had in mind Western European words too, but primarily Turkish ones, characterised by him as 'stigmata of slavery', while the centuries of Ottoman rule were to account for the deep 'mutilation' of language.120\n\nPapadopoulos proposed two main courses of action: on the one hand, to meticulously study and restore available Greek terms; on the other, to coin the rest in consistency 'to Greek eurhythmy and orthoepy'121 - which means that the proposed new terms not only had to be operative, but also to look and sound ostensibly 'Greek'.122 The Greek professor poses himself both as a collector and an inventor of words, putting a particular emphasis on the act of nomination (???µat??es?a). Extreme cautiousness and zeal were needed in this attempt; Papadopoulos even goes on to point out the insufficiency of terminological researches on ancient art undertaken - 'rather as a parergon' - by foreign scholars, such as Theodor Panofska's studies on vases,123 which he considers already obsolete. ?he task, as he notes, encumbered above all Greek scholars.124\n\nPapadopoulos's intention is to build a homogenous artistic vocabulary that could be widely spread, as he hopes, through the students of the School, 'who are learning the things along with the names'125 - he points here to a typical operation of institutional self-reproduction. While Koumanoudis was describing a rather individual problem related to his activity as a translator, Papadopoulos speaks in the name of an institution that sought to teach Greek society not only to produce art but also to speak about it.\n\nFaithful to his programmatic declarations, Papadopoulos engaged in intense lexicographical research, as testified both by a manuscript entitled 'Material to Kallitechniological Terminology' [...] found in his archives, as well by his ... [Essay on Artistic Onomatology], composed around 1850. The manuscript is a kind of Greek-French glossary that contains more than 400 entries of technical and artistic terms presented not alphabetically, but in the order of their appearance in Müller's text. The glossary served apparently as a work tool for Papadopoulos's oral or written translations and re-adaptations of Müller's manual, which were based, as discussed earlier, ?n its French translation. Among foreign languages, French is Papadopoulos's main reference, as it was for Greek educated elites in general. During this period, articles in the press treating artistic questions are scattered with French terms in parentheses, as accompaniments to the Greek ones, creating thus a kind of meta-text to assure that the message would get through, given the semantic instability of Greek words. Even Ludwig Ross, in his adaptation of Müller's manual, feels the need to insert parenthetically, along with the German terms, the French ones corresponding to the Greek.126 A manuscript note, found in Papadopoulos's archive, detailing his courses seems to imply that French terminology was even taught to the students of the School, along with the developing Greek one.127\n\nAs for Papadopoulos's Essay on Artistic Onomatology, unlike what its title might suggest, it is not a continuous argumentative text, but rather a series of lexicographical entries and brief explicatory texts corresponding to fifteen plates destined for the study of architecture as proposed in Müller's systematic approach in the second part of his manual.128 The plates and the corresponding entries follow closely the order of Müller's presentation; they cover construction techniques according to material: stone, wood and brick (pl. 1-4); geometric forms, different kinds of lines and surfaces (pl. 5) (fig. 8); rectilinear and curvilinear mouldings, or what Müller terms 'subordinate, interruption, separating, preparatory forms',129 mainly cymatia (Dorian, lesbian, etc., pl. 6-8); bearing architectural members: the column (Dorian, Ionian, Corinthian) and its elements (base, shaft and capital) (pl. 9-10) (fig. 9, 10), pillars and walls (pl. 11), doors and windows (pl. 12), entablatures (architrave, frieze, cornice) in the Dorian, Ionian and Corinthian ordinances (pl. 13-14) and, last, ceilings, roofs and vaults (pl. 15).\n\nThe German scholar qualifies his technical approach to architecture in the second part of the manual as 'nothing more than nomenclature, which oral exposition must supply with illustrations'.130 This is precisely what Papadopoulos undertakes, providing images for almost every single architectural unit of Müller's 'nomenclature'. In the corresponding captions, he names each unit and architectural element illustrated, codifying thus a highly specialised repertoire of technical terms. In the Essay, Papadopoulos therefore seeks to generate simultaneously a taxonomy of words and of things, in order to bring about a practice-oriented knowledge. Giving names to things, forming a language amounts here, in a sense, to the very production of knowledge. Papadopoulos's whole endeavour is indeed orientated towards objects, developing a visual, classificatory and onomatological approach that leaves little margin to historical thinking, contextualisation or narrative structures.\n\nIn the captions corresponding to the plates, each Greek term is accompanied with its equivalent in Latin and French, less often in Italian also; German terms are completely absent. Most interestingly, in this dry lexical and taxonomic script, Papadopoulos often inserts notes that reveal the prescriptive character of his teaching. For instance, in the captions pertaining to geometric forms, where different line and surface combinations are presented, Papadopoulos opens with a programmatic observation absent from Müller's text: 'The straight lines, horizontal or vertical, and the only slightly sloping lines (in relation to the first two) are the dominant lines in Greek architecture', and further inserts: 'Lines heavily sloping from the vertical or the horizontal, such as Gothic lapses, are contrary to the principles of architectural beauty of the Greeks'.131 For both Papadopoulos and Caftanzoglou, Gothic architecture represented indeed the absolute Other of Greek architecture, a kind of imminent 'danger' in this crucial period of the 're-generation of arts', that should by all means be held outside the Greek territory.132 The fear of 'barbaric' words is here coupled with the fear of an eventual invasion of 'barbaric' forms. In the highly ideological rhetoric of the School, reanimated ancient words and suitably constructed neologisms, along with a properly defined artistic vocabulary of forms, constitute the nation's arsenal against its literary and artistic enemies.\n\nBoth in the Essay and in his French-Greek glossary, for each entry Papadopoulos methodically accounts for his 'nominational' choices, drawing on a bewildering array of ancient writers, Greek, Latin or even Byzantine (such as Eustathios of Thessaloniki). His familiarity with ancient sources and his lexicographical interests were probably cultivated in Paris, where, in parallel to his studies, he worked as an editor of ancient texts in the Frères Didot publishing house, engaging in the on-going publication (from 1831 to 1865) of the Thesaurus Graecae Linguae, a landmark in modern lexicography of Greek.133 To mention just one example from the French-Greek glossary: for arts du dessin, architecture, painting and sculpture, Papadopoulos adopts the term ... drawing on Plato's Laws, and considers it preferable to Ross's - in his adaptation of Müller's manual - ..., also found in Laws.134 Ross's choices are indeed a basic reference alongside which, or often against which, Papadopoulos develops his own terminological universe.\n\nOf particular interest is a less typical sample of Papadopoulos's practices: the inclusion, along with ancient Greek, Latin, and French or less often Italian lexical equivalents, of words of colloquial usage, particularly for the elements pertaining to wood construction, widely used in vernacular architecture.135 Papadopoulos's intention is to address the young craftsmen and traditional artisans flooding the classes of the School from various regions, within or outside the frontiers of the State, seeking to inculcate the new techniques (namely, drawing) and the new aesthetic models introduced under the authority of a state institution. These craftsmen and artisans are precisely the prospective users and disseminators of the new homogenized 'national' artistic language, both lexical and formal, envisioned by the leaders of the School.\n\nPapadopoulos's appropriation of Müller's work led to a huge operation of word inventions and definitions of terms. His lexicographical inquiries and proposals need to be further studied, but their historical significance is already clear: this is the first attempt to institute a system of concepts around works of art and art practices, a system of specialized terms capable of defining a separate field of production that was only then emerging in Greece.136\n\nA romantic aesthetics for Greek art?\n\nAs shown so far, Papadopoulos's appropriation of Müller's handbook privileges the systematic treatment of ancient art, neglecting the historical approach proposed in the first part of the manual. Another part of Müller's summa proved particularly important for the Greek teacher: the inaugural theoretical introduction. Papadopoulos's adaptation of this part is the only printed extract of his lectures, which appeared in instalments in the magazine Ephimeris ton Philomathon in 1857, under the title 'Introduction to Greek Kallitechniologia'.137\n\nMüller's comprehensive account of ancient art is preceded by a two-fold general introduction divided into a theoretical and a literary part (proposing an exhaustive review of sources and literature on ancient art). It is the first theoretical portion that interests Papadopoulos. Müller exposes here the conceptual foundations of his work, drawing on art theory and aesthetics: he defines the concept of Art (Kunst) and more particularly the notion of 'artistic idea', as well as the 'simplest and more general laws of art' (Die einfachsten und allgemeinsten Gesetze der Kunst); he further discusses the divisions and classifications of art, and finally its historical emergence.138\n\nMüller's choice to introduce an archaeological manual with a speculative approach to art is quite original.139 Such an approach is indeed completely absent from the complex architecture of the disciplines and fields composing Altertumswissenschaft as influentially defined, at the beginning of the century, by Freidrich August Wolf (1759-1824),140 whose logic and order are taken into account in Müller's manual. Concerning the study of works of art and the material remnants of antiquity, Wolf points first to 'a complete enumeration of the preserved material',141 which is what Müller undertakes in his exhaustive geographical survey of monuments and collections, and concerning art in particular, the focus is on two disciplines: Kunstgeschichte (Müller's first part of the manual) and Kunstlehre, that is, 'the principles and technical rules [...] under which the artists of antiquity worked'.142 Wolf's Kunstlehre corresponds to Müller's technical approach in the second part of the manual. However, along with the study of theoretical and practical principles in history (that is, the principles valid in the specific historical period of antiquity), Müller also attempts in his introduction a general, abstract and philosophical reflection on the nature of art. Aesthetic considerations of this order were in general omitted by the philologically trained scholars who came to study and teach ancient art in the German University (one may think, for instance, of Panofka or Gerhard in Berlin). It is in this sense extremely revealing that Friedrich Welcker - Müller's predecessor at the University of Göttingen, who shared an equally acute interest in ancient art143 - makes no comment whatsoever in his extended review of the manual on this programmatic introductory part, suggesting tacitly its displaced character.\n\nMüller would find a privileged interlocutor for his speculative endeavour beyond the circle of his philologically trained, text-oriented colleagues, in an extra-institutional scholar, the art historian Carl Friedrich von Rumohr (1785-1843), whose ground-breaking Italienische Forschungen (1827-1831, 3 vols), published three years before Müller's manual, began with an imposing treatise on aesthetics - his famous 'Haushalt der Kunst'.144 Müller's endeavour was thus informed by the developments occurring in the study of post-antique art. It is also interesting in this regard that precisely when the artist's biography was becoming in Germany the genre in which a new critical and historical methodology was elaborated, breaking away from the older vitas,145 Müller was one of the first to apply this model to an ancient artist, the celebrated Phidias, in his De Phidiae vita et operibus, commentationes tres (1827) - an extremely interesting and today hardly mentioned text (probably also because of its being written in Latin).146 One cannot help but stress the intense contact between scholars, now blurred by the subsequent fragmentation of disciplines, and to underline the entangled nature of their interests during this formative period when the divide between ancient and modern art was still extremely fluid.\n\nThe art theoretical premises adopted by Müller draw mainly on Kant, but also on the romantic aesthetics of Novalis and Schiller.147 Papadopoulos's appropriation of Müller's introduction for his own teaching at the School of Arts is particularly important, not simply as a first example of a systematic theoretical discourse that marked the origins of art education in Greece, but also because it introduced elements of romantic aesthetics, functioning thus as an alternative to the classicist doctrine expressed in the annual official discourses by Caftanzoglou.148\n\nVery significant in this regard is Müller's understanding of art not as mimesis, but rather as representation (Darstellung, ...); that is, as the outward expression of inner mental activity: 'Art is representation, that is an activity, by means of which what is in our mind is inscribed into external sensible forms'.149 Crucial to this definition of art is the concept of 'artistic idea', that is, 'the mood and activity of the mind from which proceeds the conception of the particular form':150\n\nThe internal or the represented in art, that is, the spiritual life that the artwork makes manifest, is called artistic idea [...] the work of art, even if it is often copied from nature, has still its proper existence [...] this is because the artist does not copy [nature], but rather represents their own feeling, to which the contemplation of the object gave rise.151\n\nBeyond the classicist paradigm of mimesis, the emphasis is put here on the affective and subjective mediation of external reality by the figure of the artist. Concerning the conceptual status of the artistic idea, Müller observes moreover that it 'is rather an idea of a peculiar individual kind, which is at the same time united with a strong and lively feeling of the soul [...] in the creation as well as the adoption of the artistic form, the feeling remains predominant'.152\n\nThe primacy of feeling in shaping the artistic idea and its corresponding form seems to have been already present in Papadopoulos's thought even before his turn towards Müller's work. In his inaugural lesson of 1844, he declared: 'Art is feeling, it is transformed into an idea, and finally is incarnated in the work'.153 Papadopoulos's sententious, paratactic and essentially oral formulation has certainly little to do with the analytical precision of Müller's text; he seems above all to neatly separate feeling from idea (consubstantial in Müller's analysis), suggesting moreover a vision of artistic creation as a kind of linear sequence of well-distinguished phases (feeling, idea, work). This is precisely what he will manage to communicate in a more complex way, by adopting Müller's analysis. Müller insists from the very beginning on the intrinsic link between idea and form, conceiving and making: 'The idea and the work are so closely related that as soon as the idea is born within us it tends to be represented outwards; only through this representation [the idea] is completely developed in the mind'.154 Papadopoulos pursues this with a concrete example, manipulating Müller's reference to Schiller's 'obscure total idea':155\n\nA rather unclear idea prevails before the production of every work of art. While the artist is imagining initially a battle in an unclear way, in working [executing] with enthusiasm, he manages to represent it with clarity, making thus more articulate the idea in his mind. 156\n\nHere, the different moments of creative activity feed into each other, forming a kind of circular flow. The initially indeterminate idea can only be fully crystallised through its expression in material form. The work of art is not the application of a well-defined, preconceived plan or idea, but is formed through and along with the very process of the material execution of the work, which fully participates in the making and finalisation of the idea itself.\n\nUnlike Caftanzoglou, who in his official speeches operates solely with a disincarnated, abstract essence of art, Papadopoulos, following Müller, puts at the centre of his analysis the artist and the very process of artistic creation. Müller adopts indeed an aesthetics of creation rather than an aesthetics of reception;157 that is, he approaches art from the point of view of its maker rather than its beholder. This makes his theoretical analysis valuable for Papadopoulos, as he wishes to address art students. He even tends often to insist on and amplify passages that put the artist and his particular way of seeing 'on stage', or which demonstrate more generally the internal dynamics of the creative process.\n\nTurning concepts into (well-chosen) examples\n\nAs has already been suggested in the previous analysis, Papadopoulos does not propose a verbatim translation of Müller's theoretical introduction, far from it. As the editor of the magazine Ephimeris ton Philomathon observes, the published lectures 'contain much from the work of Müller, part of which was changed and developed according to the finality [of the course], while other parts were entirely added in order to complete the teaching material'.158 The parts that could be attributed exclusively to the Greek professor are not as many as this commentary would imply. Papadopoulos follows indeed quite closely the logic and structure of Müller's introduction.159 Nonetheless, the ways he intervenes in the adopted Müllerian script are extremely varied.\n\nFirst of all, in the way Papadopoulos adapts Müller's introduction there is a prevailing tendency to simplify and make intelligible by means of concrete examples the abstract philosophical discourse of the German scholar, which was full of theoretical concepts and aesthetic categories that were still not widespread in Greece, and were certainly new for the students of the School. Concepts are often paraphrased, and the names of authors cited by Müller (?ant, Goethe, Schiller, etc.) are systematically omitted. Müller's frequent references to music are almost always replaced by examples from the relevant art form of painting and sculpture. Moreover, Papadopoulos tends to select his examples not solely from the realm of ancient art, but also from modern times, seeking to affirm the general validity of Kallitechniologia for the study of the arts across history: thus, when he introduces for instance the notion of style, discussing it both as an individual and as a collective phenomenon, in the sense of national schools ('..., école'), he expands and diversifies Müller's few examples drawn exclusively from ancient art (Phidias, Praxiteles; Egyptian, Grecian style), by referring also to Raphael, or to the Arabic, Byzantine, Dutch and Italian style.160\n\nTypical of the Greek professor's efforts of vulgarisation is his treatment of the notions of the sublime and the graceful, which Müller succinctly juxtaposes with the beautiful in his discussion of the 'simplest and more general laws of art': regularity, beauty and unity (§ 14). Concerning the sublime, Papadopoulos further develops Müllers laconic definition,161 introducing the Kantian distinction between 'mathematical' sublime, inspired by magnitude of size (...) and 'dynamical' sublime inspired by force (...); and he goes on to provide concrete examples. The famous Kantian ones (ocean, mountains, crowds) are here accompanied by examples that would immediately make sense to the Greek audience, drawn from ancient and modern Greek history: thus, the sense of the sublime inspired by force would be engendered by 'the view of the thunder, of a sea agitated to its depths, of a man who, firm to his convictions, remains steadfastly opposed to the tyrant; by the imprisoned Socrates dying in the name of truth, or a hero inspiring and steering up a whole nation for freedom'.162\n\nAs for the category of the graceful, Papadopoulos's examples are strictly drawn from the universe of landscape and genre scenes: 'The graceful, being free of shock or excitation, provokes to the soul calm and agreeable sensations; for example the vision of a beautiful green plain, bleating sheep herds, a fluting shepherd, a small hut irradiating rural happiness'.163\n\nPrecisely at the moment of the publication of Papadopoulos's 'Introduction', such subjects were proposed in the artistic competitions of 1856 and 1857, exceptionally sponsored by the Minister of Finance Alexandros Kontostavlou (1789-1865).164 The subject given to sculptors in 1856 was 'Shepherd holding a sheep' ['...'], and the first prize was given to brothers Georgios and Lazaros Phytalis for their treatment of the subject. (fig. 11) The latter had a year earlier participated in the Greek section of the Parisian Universal Exhibition of 1855 with his 'Fluting Shepherd', a work conveying, according to Caftanzoglou, 'the idle and carefree bucolic life'.165 While evoking an idyllic Arcadian Greece, such themes were typically transposed into the present, conveying the vision of an idealised country life - which was besides politically instrumental at a moment of intense turmoil in the mainland.166\n\nIt is clear that Papadopoulos's intention was not only to exemplify theoretical concepts, but also to fix a prescriptive repertory of subjects. Genre scenes, standing traditionally at the lower level of the academic hierarchy, were here legitimatised under the category of the graceful; along with portraits, genre scenes would indeed dominate the artistic production of the country during the second half of the century.\n\nColour according to Chevreul\n\nPapadopoulos's most significant intervention, however, lies elsewhere. In Müller's discussion on the use of colour in painting and the plastic arts, the teacher inserts an analysis based on Eugène Chevreul's (1786-1889) studies on colour interaction. It is well known that the French chemist's colour theory, advanced in his voluminous De la loi du contraste simultané des couleurs (1839), had, through intermediaries like Charles Blanc, and a series of productive misunderstandings, contributed considerably to the establishment of a new paradigm of chromatic harmony based on the juxtaposition of complementary colours - a practice banished in classicist aesthetics due to the resulting effect of intense contrasts.167 Chevreul's famous law of simultaneous contrast of colours would be of major significance for the experimentations of impressionists and, most importantly, of post-impressionists. However, before the 1860s, with the notable exception of Delacroix, Chevreul's ideas on the interaction of colours had not really found any serious applications in artistic practice.\n\nThis is why Papadopoulos's reference to Chevreul in 1857 - probably also earlier, in the context of his oral teaching - is quite remarkable. It is possible that Papadopoulos had a chance to familiarise himself with Chevreul's ideas in Paris. Much more than his strenuous volume of 1839, it was Chevreul's public lectures, from 1830 until the 1850s, that functioned as the main source for the diffusion of his theories. Delivered at the Manufacture des Gobelins, where Chevreul was appointed as Director at the Department of Dyes, his lectures were highly popular,168 and it is possible that the young Papadopoulos also attended them.\n\nPapadopoulos's intention was to bring at the disposal of his students the 'laws of colour harmony', which, as he observes, Chevreul's chromatic circle presented in a 'positive and sensible manner'. 169 After a detailed description of Chevreul's scheme, which was apparently supported by an illustration in the classroom,170 he concluded:\n\nColours are modified when they are juxtaposed with other colours: in this table, each colour is defined, and one can find the necessary ascending and descending modification, that is, the tone that has to be applied to the surrounding colours, as well as the resulting assimilation. The necessary harmony is thus constructed in an easy and positive manner.171\n\nA scientific and a normative outlook are here coupled together. Previously condemned to being studied through ancient vases, painting is put here at the centre of attention. This is indeed one of the rare but quite significant indications of an attempt to supplement the technical procedures and knowledge of the ancients with modern science. Trying to adapt an archaeological manual to the needs of artistic training could indeed lead to fascinating combinations: the peak of German Altertumswissenschaft went hand in hand with the peak of French applied chemistry in the decorative arts and industry (particularly tapestry, for which Chevreul's theories were originally developed).\n\nIt is difficult to determine whether and to what extent Chevreul's ideas as introduced by Papadopoulos had an impact or practical application in his students' work. It is equally difficult to know whether Papadopoulos was conscious of the potentially subversive character of these ideas with regard to the standard academic practices in painting technique. His proposals about the use of colour would probably have sounded strange, to say the least, to the painters that taught drawing and painting classes at the School.172 As I argued in my introductory comments, scholarly courses in the art school can potentially function as clusters of innovative ideas and reflexivity in relation to established traditions. Even if the actual impact of such theories on artistic practice cannot be defined, the fact of their inclusion in the teaching material merits taking into account.\n\nBeautiful forms or beautiful ideas?\n\nFinally, of particular interest are Papadopoulos's resistances to Müller's positions. Elsewhere I had the opportunity to discuss in detail how Papadopoulos tried to rehabilitate the concept of mimesis, inserting a second definition of art after the introductory one based on the idea of representation (...).173 Another seminal notion of classicist aesthetics that the Greek professor hesitates to abandon is that of allegory, brought into question in Müller's analysis.174 Müller introduces a neat distinction between the 'artistic idea', that can only be expressed through 'the altogether particular form of the work' and the idea 'in the ordinary sense' (Begriff), that is, a 'frame where different phenomena may fit'.175 Here Müller draws on Kant's thought, and stresses the incompatibility between language, composed by Begriffe, and plastic forms.176 A necessary consequence of this distinction is that allegories, which seek to represent abstract notions, such as truth, 'by external shapes' do not 'strictly speaking lie within the sphere of artistic activity'.177\n\nPapadopoulos adopts Müller's analysis, admitting in his turn that in the case of allegories art 'deviates from its main objective'.178 However, he is quick to elaborate on this position, adding that 'when the artist represents abstract notions in an anthropomorphic way, he can still produce a notable work'.179 Allegory was indeed crucial for the didactic and moralising mission the leaders of the School strove to attribute to art, hence Papadopoulos's reticence to completely dismiss it as an artistic genre. Only a year before the publication of his lectures, the subject in Kontostavlos' painting contest of 1856 was precisely an allegory of charity - albeit still quite far from the academic conception of the genre - with the precise indication to treat it 'anthropomorphically': 'Charity, represented through three figures: a blind old woman with a child and a young student that gives her alms, in the form of bread or money'.180\n\nI will focus subsequently on a last point of resistance that is closely related to the logic inherent in Papadopoulos's rescuing of allegory; it concerns the difference in the way that artistic laws seem to be understood by Müller and Papadopoulos, at least in the way the latter decided to convey them to his students. An important shift is observed in the definition of the beautiful. While Müller speaks exclusively in terms of beautiful forms,181 Papadopoulos, in transcribing Müller's definition, qualifies as beautiful not only forms (...) but also, and primarily, ideas. He even adds, in his typical manner, a series of well-chosen examples:\n\nBeautiful are called the artistic ideas, or the forms, that exercise on the soul an impression in conformity to its own nature; a beneficent impression, which produces harmonious feelings; that is, beautiful is the picture that excites the feeling of piety or tenderness, or the love for the country; that evokes the innocent joy of children, or the pudicity of a young virgin, etc.; [Beautiful is] the poem that represents the crime as abominable, inspiring repulsion towards evil.182\n\nThe criterion of the beautiful is here displaced from the form to the idea. The 'beneficent' influence and the ¡¥harmonious feelings¡ that beautiful works raise in the soul seem to depend on their ability to appeal to a set of dominant moral, religious or national values. The basis of beauty lies in the nobleness and moral gravity of the subject, while forms in themselves are not deemed capable of moving the soul, or provoking aesthetic pleasure. The idea of the self-sufficiency and autonomy of artistic means does not penetrate the Greek horizon, where image is above all the carrier of a moral and national message. This same resistance can be observed in the way Caftanzoglou, in his official speeches, adapted the ideas of French theorist Jacques-Nicolas Paillot de Montabert (1771-1849) concerning the impact of art on human sensibility.183\n\nContrary to Papadopoulos, Muller speaks solely in term of 'beautiful forms', which are considered as such precisely because they are capable of producing in the soul vibrations that are in accordance with its inmost structure. The sense of beauty relies in a sort of harmonious correspondence between artistic forms and the vibrations of the soul. For the German scholar, who follows Kant in this point as well, the question of beauty is put in the last instance under the prerogative of 'aesthetics, as a part of psychology'.184\n\nThis idea determines more generally the way Muller grounds artistic laws. As he explains, these laws are actually deduced from the very nature and function of the soul.185 Papadopoulos on the contrary omits almost completely any reference to the psychological foundation of artistic laws seminal for Muller. In the corresponding passage, he mentions bluntly: 'We call general laws of art the simple conditions under which alone the sensible life of man can be excited in an agreeable manner; that is, under which alone representation is made'.186\n\nThe insertion of this last phrase is telling: for Papadopoulos, the laws of art have a normative character. What he is primarily interested in is the instruction of his students, rather than free philosophical speculation on the nature of beauty and its psychological underpinnings. Thus, while for Müller the laws of art are valid to the degree that they conform 'to the demands of sensibility', for Papadopoulos they seem rather to be arbitrarily imposed. The Greek professor transforms Müller's speculative approach into a prescriptive set of concepts, principles and rules to guide artistic practice.187 I close here my analysis of the various methods by which Papadopoulos reinvents Müller's archaeological manual for the needs of artistic training, and shall now turn to an overall evaluation of his teaching.\n\nScholarly training for artists or craftsmen?\n\nPapadopoulos's choice to dedicate his teaching to the study of ancient Greek art is not surprising, given the classicist orientation of the School under Caftanzoglou's tenure and the overall ideological agenda of the State, which sought to re-appropriate the ancient Greek heritage. For the leading figures of the School it was almost self-evident that the development of modern Greek art would be founded on ancient art, envisaged as a universal artistic model. This aesthetic ideal presupposed a scholarly ideal: 'since the study of the artistic remnants of antiquity is the basis of every sound art, the knowledge of archaeology on their regard is not only necessary, but also inevitable'.188 Papadopoulos proposes thus an exhaustive and in-depth study of the artistic practices and monuments of antiquity, turning mainly towards the new science of archaeology and firmly away from the model of a history for artists.\n\nThe thorough education on the techniques, forms and subjects of ancient art, and the theoretical and technical knowledge Papadopoulos codified, endowing it with a proper vocabulary, provided trainees with particular resources and skills that formed a specific competence upon which their professional legitimacy was to be grounded. As holders of this specific competence, the students of the School would be able to gain access to and negotiate their position within the emerging art world of the Greek State.\n\nNonetheless, the mastery obtained through this education was almost entirely grounded on the historical experience of Greek antiquity. As Pierre Bourdieu observes, the 'practical mastery of the specific attainments of the whole history of the genre which are objectified in past works and recorded, codified and canonized by the whole corpus of professionals of conservation and celebration - historians of art and literature, exegetes, analysts - is a necessary resource, part of the capital, that conditions access to the field'.189 The doyens of the School, unique legislators [nomothetes] of the nascent art world, however, limit the 'history of the genre' solely to ancient Greek art. The students of the School could pretend only to a very partial mastery of such a history, as they were deprived from any substantial contact with artistic developments beyond the sacro-saint limits of Greek antiquity, and particularly with the Western tradition of the Renaissance. The study of Western art was certainly hindered by the lack of relevant works in Greece, on which to base, for instance, a teaching of the type proposed by Papadopoulos. Sticking to Antiquity was however a deliberate, ideologically informed choice rather than a form of compliance to practical limitations. Be that as it may, completing one's studies in European artistic centres was throughout the century a necessary condition in order to become an established artist in Greece.\n\nPapadopoulos's abandonment of the project of a universal history for artists was rooted in the different objectives informing art education in Greece with relation to its foreign models. In the 1840s, Italian and French art schools were still striving to perpetuate the tradition of history painting; it therefore remained necessary to provide their students with the appropriate knowledge for reading and producing historical and mythological subjects. Art students were confronted precisely with such subjects in the large variety of artistic contests that structured the pedagogical experience throughout the year, culminating in competitions like the Prix de Rome in France or the Concorso Clementino in Rome.190 In Greece, on the contrary, the artistic contests organised at the end of each academic year - with the exception of the extraordinary, privately founded contests of 1856 and 1857 - always involved copying a model (two-dimensional print, cast or live model), rather than producing a composition based on a given academic subject.\n\nThe historical and literary culture that was the primary concern of scholarly teaching in Italy and France gave way to a technical culture, certainly thorough, but limited to a very specific stylistic morphology. Given this orientation, one might wonder what exactly the status was of painters and sculptors trained by the Athenian School. Was the objective to form artists capable of producing visually and intellectually compelling compositions, or rather skilled craftsmen, decorators capable of reproducing antique ornamental motifs or sculptors at ease with the different techniques and genres of ancient sculpture?\n\nDuring this formative period, the very agenda of the institution is ambiguous: as Papadopoulos puts it, the School was conceived 'as a school of fine arts, to the degree that these can constitute a proper profession in Greece, or in order to contribute to the betterment of other arts and crafts'.191 Concerns about the viability of the artistic profession in Greece were rising in the face of the cultural unresponsiveness of a public that had to be 'produced' along with the producers. The big state commissions for the decoration of the new buildings of the capital, meanwhile, tended to be monopolised by foreign, mainly Bavarian artists that accompanied the King - and the limited private commissions by the local elites largely followed the lead. Moreover, the role and identity of the institution were highly unstable, hovering between artistic and economic considerations and seeking to promote also applied arts or even to develop scientific technical studies.192 These were the tensions that Papadopoulos had to face in defining the focus of his teaching. To be sure, the School's objective was not the creation of history painting, or even of a national school of history painting, despite a few mentions about it solely by Papadopoulos.193 It seems rather that the primary goal was the elaboration, codification and transmission of a common plastic vocabulary clearly identified as Greek and capable of evoking the illustrious past of Antiquity in all forms of production in the new Kingdom, both artistic and manufactured. The priority was to teach matters relating to the materials, the forms and the techniques of ancient art, which the students of the School had to be capable of mastering and reproducing in the present.\n\nFinally, one has to add Papadopoulos's own personal scholarly interests and claims to the considerations that determined the direction of scholarly training. It is clear that his teaching is strongly informed by an ideal of scholarship. He refers extensively to the contribution of Kallitechniologia to classical studies and particularly to philology, insisting that through the concrete and detailed knowledge of ancient monuments and objects a better understanding of the texts themselves could be attained.194 He repeatedly points to the p"
