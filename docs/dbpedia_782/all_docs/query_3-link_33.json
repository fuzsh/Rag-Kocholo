        "text": "My research interests are centred upon the overlap between sociology and philosophy, and in particular focus on four areas. firstly, I research the philosophy of social science, the sociology of knowledge, the epistemological status of sociology, and sociology's relationship with philosophy and legal theory. Secondly, I am interested in theories of rationality, and the role of value judgements and ethical propositions in sociological theory. Thirdly, my work also focusses on sociological theory, both classical and modern, and in particular, Marxist and Weberian sociological theory. Fourthly, and related to this, I also work on class and stratification, and their relationship to sociological conceptions of power, ideology, and conceptions of domination and authority.\n\nMy DPhil entitled 'Alan Gewirth and the Political Community' was awarded in 2003, and attempted to establish the importance of ethical theory to Marx's political theory. In order to do this, I argued that Marx's theory of human nature, or species-being needs to be underpinned by Alan Gewirth's neo-Kantian ethical rationalism argument encapsulated in his argument to a supreme moral principle. Put another way, his conception of a Prospective Purposive Agent, a being who values not only his or her purposes, but also the generic preconditins of agency (freedom and well-being) is the necessary foundation for Marx's theory of human nature.\n\nSince then, I have written and published on Gewirth and Marx, as well as legal theory, theories of power, and the works of Max Weber, Ralf Dahrenorf, Jurgen Habermas, and Steven Lukes.\n\nMy research interests are centred on politics and international relations in the Middle East and, in this regional context, in particular on: activism in repressive contexts; student movements and the political role of universities; and transnational solidarity.\n\n1. Activism in repressive contexts\n\nI am particularly interested in how people pursue activism in contexts of extreme repression, including under military occupation. This work intersects with my broader interest on social movements and mobilisation. As part of this research interest, I have published on Palestinian political activism under occupation, including resistance practiced by university students (in Resistance and the Practice of Rationality) and through cultural institutions. My article for Critical Military Studies explores the activism at work in the Palestinian Museum and contributes to emerging academic work that seeks to highlight the role of museums in International Relations.\n\n2. Student movements and the political role of universities\n\nI have a long-standing research interest in student activism. My doctoral thesis (which was awarded the Leigh Douglas Memorial Prize by the British Society for Middle Eastern Studies) focused on Palestinian student activism in Palestinian, Israeli and British universities. I subsequently led the British Academy funded project in Higher Education and Political Change in the Arab World which focused on the teaching of social sciences at Egyptian, Jordanian and Palestinian universities in the wake of the Arab Uprisings, and the political setting and impact of this teaching. Together with Juliet Millican, I have published work on the role of universities and students in conflict and post-conflict situations and under occupation.\n\n3. Transnational Solidarity\n\nMy research interest in transnational solidarity is currently being pursued through the on-going Radical Sixties project that seeks to bring transnational solidarity (particularly across, and with, anticolonial struggles) to the fore in analyses of politics in the 1960s. Beginning with the 2019 international conference ‘The Radical Sixties: Aesthetics, Politic and Histories of Solidarity’ held at the University of Brighton, the project has continued through a 2020 workshop on radical politics and transnational solidarity in the “Long Sixties”. I have recently co-edited a book, with Dr Zeina Maasri and Dr Cathy Bergin, Transnational solidarity: Anticolonialism in the global sixties (Manchester University Press, 2022), based on papers developed from these events with other selected contributors.\n\nAdditional roles\n\nI am a member of the managing committee for the Centre for Applied Philosophy, Politics and Ethics (CAPPE) at the University of Brighton and, together with Dr Deanna Dadusc, I lead CAPPE’s Social Movements and Radical Global Politics strand. I currently co-convene the “work in progress” seminar series on Social Movements and Radical Politics and I encourage researchers working in these areas who are interested in presenting work in this series to contact me by email.\n\nMy publications explore the way that social, political, and economic questions are played out through various kinds of cultural representations and practices including modern and contemporary writing in English, and in visual cultures of the late twentieth and twenty-first century.\n\nI am currently a Co-Investigator on the Horizon 2020 grant, CAPONEU- Cartography of the Political Novel in Europe. Working with colleagues in the University of Brighton's CAPPE, I am investigating the nature of the political with a particular focus on the political work of the novel as a form or writing. My current project aims to develop a typology of politics reading across into the contemporary political novel in English. This project will suggest that the contemporary political novel differs from previous understandings of this form and will demonstrate how different defintions of politics get treated by contemporary novelists.\n\nMy recent research has focused on the economic humanities, specifically around questions of work and literature. This includes my book Precarious Labour and the Contemporary Novel (Palgrave, 2017) which explores how regimes of flexible labour in the contemporary economy have been represented in English-language fiction about office work. It explores a range of national contexts in order to consider how the different national traditions for thinking about work inform recent depictions of precarious workers. Building on this research, I have recent essays on women's novels depicting office and flexible work, demonstrating how these engage with feminist debates about the nature of paid or unpaid labour, and on surrogate-thrillers exploring how commercial surrogacy is represented as care work in recent film and television.\n\nMy previous research has focused on the relationships of cultural texts to nations and transnational movements. I have published widely on the idea of the nation and on the culture of globalization. This research considers how changes in public discourses are reproduced and challenged by creative and cultural texts. This has concentrated on ideas about national and racial difference; on the shape of the global economy since the late 1970s; and on contemporary attitudes towards terror. I have published extensively on literature and globalization and this work has helped to shape the debates defining this field. In 2010 I co-edited the Literature and Globalization Reader (Routledge) which, for the first time, brought together major theoretical writings on globalization with critical responses to these theories in literary studies.\n\nDr. Deanna Dadusc is a Senior Lecturer in Criminology at the School of Humanities and Social Science.\n\nHer research critically analyses the criminalisation of social movements in Europe, including the criminalisation of migrants' mutul aid, solidarity and 'facilitation' of migration. In previous years, she dedicated her work to the criminalisation of housing struggles. Her research draws on critical approaches to criminology addressing state, corporate and border violence from feminist and anti-racist perspectives. Informed by active engagement in social and political struggles, Deanna's research attempts to bring together analyses and practices of prison abolition and border abolition.\n\nTogether with Aila Spathopoulou and Camille Gendrot, Deanna co-coordinates the Migrations and Borders research area of the Feminist autonomous Centre for Research, where she also co-organises the annual 'Feminist No Borders Summer School', as well as a community course on 'Resisting the Criminalisation of Facilitation' (supported by the University of Brighton IGNITE fund).\n\nDeanna participated in the Erasmus+ BRIDGES consortium, which brings together Universities and Civil Society organisations to tackle exclusion and discrimination in Higher Education, by using decolonial, anti-racist and feminist approaches and methodologies. The consortium includes the Feminist Autonomous Centre for Research and Za’atar in Athens; the domestic workers union Sindillar and the Autonomous University of Barcelona; An.Ge.Kommen and the University of Giessen in Germany; the University of Brighton and the Office of Displaced Designers in the UK.\n\nBetween 2018 and 2021, Deanna coordinated the 'Social Movements and Radical Politics' strand of the Centre for Applied Philosophy, Politics and Ethics (CAPPE - University of Brighton).\n\nRobin Dunford's research addresses humanitarian intervention, the responsibility to protect, human rights, and decolonial ethics.\n\n1. Civilian Protection, Humanitarian Intervention and the Responsibility to Protect\n\nWith Michael Neu (University of Brighton), Dunford is the author of Just War and the Responsibility to Protect: A Critique. This book argues that debates on Just War and the Responsibility to Protect fail to consider already existing forms of intervention – including arms trading, attempts to stoke ethnic tension, and measures that destroy the environment – that contribute to the emergence of humanitarian crises including genocide, ethnic cleansing, and war crimes.\n\n2. Human Rights and the Politics of Resistance\n\nDunford has written on social movement claims for human rights, focusing in particular on recent moves towards a United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Peasants and Other People Working in Rural Areas. Through a series of articles and a monograph entitled The Politics of Transnational Peasant Struggle, he has called for greater recognition within the Human Rights Council of the new collective rights demanded by activists.\n\n3. Decolonial Ethics\n\nThe third project shows how a Decolonial ethics centred on the idea of ‘pluriversality’ – a world in which many worlds fit – offers a persuasive alternative to the cosmopolitan perspective that sits at the centre of contemporary Global Ethics. Having outlined central features of a decolonial global ethics in an article in the Journal of Global Ethics, Dunford is now exploring how a decolonial perspective can reframe debates concerning environmental ethics, food justice, and development ethics.\n\n4. Law, Ethics and Democracy\n\nWith Dr Lara Montesinos Coleman, Dunford co-ordinates the Law, Ethics and Democracy Collective: an action-research initiative between scholars at the Universities of Brighton and Sussex. The Project, which was founded in 2016, aims to bring together work in applied philosophy and political theory with struggles against the increasingly fascistic, anti-democratic and dubiously-legal forms of economy and government we encounter today.\n\nAdditional Roles:\n\nTogether with Professor Professor Bob Brecher and Dr Michael Neu, Dunford edits a book series with Rowman and Littlefield. Off the Fence: Morality, Politics, Society publishes short, sharply argued texts in applied moral and political philosophy, with an interdisciplinary focus. Robin is also co-convenor of the British International Studies Association's Ethics and World Politics working group.\n\nEmma-Louise Jay’s research interests lie on the interface between psychological medicine and philosophy. She wrote her mixed-methods PhD on depersonalization at the Institute of Psychiatry, King’s College London after completing her MSc. In the Philosophy of Mental Disorder at the same university writing her thesis on the same syndrome.\n\nFrom 2013 – 2021 Emma lived and worked in Colombia where she took on the role of as post-doctoral psychologist at a leading creative arts university in Medellín – La Colegiatura Colombiana. There she co-developed a research centre focusing on research projects relating to the science of creativity, how we understand identification, and efforts towards developing social leader-led peace efforts in Colombia in the context of the 2016 Colombian peace accord. She also authors an imaginative blog which focuses mainly on issues relating to the Colombian political climate.\n\nAt the University of Brighton, Emma has taken on the role of Course Leader for the (Applied) Psychology program intake year (level 4), and also leads the module SS572 on Key Theoretical Foundations to Counselling and Psychotherapy. In this role she is enjoying teaching about the many different schools that inform the field of psychological medicine cross-culturally. She would like to broaden awareness of less-known therapies such as ‘Morita therapy’, ‘Logotherapy’ and 'Milton H. Ericksonian' hypnotherapy in her UK teaching.\n\nEmma is also joint Ethics and Integrity Lead together with Rebecca Graber for the School of Humanities and Social Sciences at the University of Brighton.\n\nEmma’s research interests include existential psychology and psychotherapy, phenomenology, German idealism, dissociation, psychological medicine, critical psychology, psychoanalysis, hypnotherapy, the history of psychiatry, cross-cultural psychology and psychiatry, and most recently, political theory. She is the author of several peer-reviewed articles, a blog, and a body of narrative non-fiction, poetry and short stories.\n\nAffiliations:\n\nThe University of Brighton’s Centre of Resilience for Social Justice (CRSJ)\n\nI am a critical and cultural theorist who employs psychoanalytic thinking to theorise the interrelation of social and symbolic change, with a particular interest in the philosophy, theory, politics and aesthetics of social reproduction and care. In my monograph, Donald Winnicott and the Politics of Care, published in the Palgrave Macmillan series, Studies in the Psychosocial, in 2022, I investigated what the work of psychoanalyst Donald Winnicott can contribute to understanding, as well as addressing, the crisis of care at the heart of contemporary society. My more recent work and current projects explore the relationship between psychoanalytic thinking and social and symbolic change, centring feminist, queer and decolonial perspectives.\n\nMore broadly, my research foregrounds the relationship between psychoanalysis, culture and society. I explore psychoanalytic thinking as a critical discourse in the Humanities, and as both a product, and active agent, of social and cultural change. I am concerned with the relationship between psychoanalysis, as theory and practice, and social justice; the politics of mental health; and the politics of reproduction and care. Theoretically, my work draws on a range of psychoanalytic perspectives, including Freudian, Lacanian, object relational and Laplanchian approaches, as well as Critical Theory; feminist theory; gender studies; queer theory and cultural studies. Much of my research to date has explored the knots that bind psychoanalytic thinking to cultural practices and social processes.\n\nI am Course Leader for the BA(Hons) Politics, Sexuality and Gender, for which I led the design and successful validation. I'm a member of the Management Board for the Centre for Applied Philosophy, Politics and Ethics at Brighton, where I contribute to several themes, including 'The Politics of Reproduction' and 'Political Fictions.'\n\nAndy Knott works in political theory, with a specific interest in political subjects, especially individualism and the people of populism, as well as debates across contemporary democratic theory.\n\nCurrent research is focused on populism, with an interest in drawing on theoretical, historical and contemporary accounts of this complex political phenomenon. Recent projects have involved: the thorny question of defining populism; analysing populism's beginnings and temporality; left-wing populisms; the theories of populism; Brexit, populism and conservatism; and, populism and political subjects.\n\nAndy is currently working on the notions of left and right, in order to re-think these categories, and reject the notion of the centre. This is part of a broader research project seeking to enrich understandings of the interactions between politics and space. This currently involves two different entry-points. First, the spatial categories of politics (left/right, up/down, in/out, high/low, etc) and, second, the space of politics -- which is sharply differentiated from the politics of space, which political geographers investigate.\n\nResearch interests also include Laclau, Mouffe, Rosanvallon, discourse theory, ideology, radical democracy, hegemony, and their roots in the likes of Machiavelli and Gramsci.\n\nDr Chrystie Myketiak is a political discourse analyst who examines language in use in order to uncover what its form, function, and structure tells us about interaction, structural inequalities, and the covert values and beliefs within a culture. Her research interests are in power and justice; gender, sexualities, desire; intersectionality; violence; social norms; sociocultural theories (specifically, feminist and queer theories); mediated communication.\n\nChrystie's specialist research is in three areas, with each strand combining her general interests. The first addresses talk about sex, sexuality and desire as social forces through the investigation of conversations in a technologically-mediated community; the monograph, Online Sex Talk and the Social World (Palgrave, \"Studies on Language, Gender, and Sexuality\"), culminates her work in this area. In order to support her writing of this book, the University of Brighton awarded her a Sabbatical Award. Chrystie's second strand of research is an intersectional discourse analysis of texts produced by mass shooters, which focuses on how the desire-centred discourse strategies used by the offenders attempt to legitimate structural inequalities and construct normative identities. This research will be published in the book Discourse, Demand, Desire: An Intersectional Analysis of Mass Shooter Texts (Palgrave). Her third body of research began as a discursive-pragmatic analysis of medical errors and the construction of accountability in medical error news reporting and clinical incident reporting; she is currently expanding her work on accountability in new directions.\n\nGerman Primera is a senior Lecturer in Philosophy and Politics at the University of Brighton. He serves as the deputy director of the Centre for Applied Philosophy, Politics, and Ethics (CAPPE) and is an editor for the Journal of Contemporary Political Theory (CPT) and the Journal of Italian Philosophy. His teaching and research interests encompass French and Italian contemporary philosophy and thought, Black studies, and Biopolitics. German is currently collaborating with Prof. Mark Devenney on a book entitled Troubling Democracy: On Practices of Care, Fugitivity, and Refusal, forthcoming with Edinburgh University Press. In his first book The political Ontology of Giorgio Agamben (London: Bloomsbury, 2019) he interrogates the relation between political ontology and violence. He is also interested in the ways in which forms of relational ontology underpin the history of contemporary critical theory and radical philosophy.\n\nMy recent publications include:\n\nPrimera, G.

I have presented this work at specialised conferences in New York, Madrid, Bristol, Palermo and Brighton with some of the leading scholars in radical theory. Moreover, through my research on political violence and biopolitics, I have approached questions surrounding the notion of exclusion and its relation to liberal democracy. This work has allowed me to take part in post-marxist debates on Populism and radical democracy that have taken place in Buenos Aires (2015) and Brighton (2016 and 2017) within the framework of the project: Transnational Populist Politics.\n\nConference Presentations\n\nPolitical Theology and Inoperativity” in The Society for European Philosophy and Forum for European Philosophy Joint Annual Conference, Royal Holloway, London, August 26th-27th 2019\n\n‘Logistics, Biopolitics and Ordering’ in Violence, Space and the Political, National University of Ireland.

She established and co-ordinates the Housing Forum, an initiative to bring together academics, community organisations and policy makers to develop local solutions to the housing crisis. She is currently contributing towards the Brighton and Hove Common Ambition project, which brings together people with lived experience of homelessness, frontline providers, and commissioners through co-production within homeless health services to improve health services and outcomes for people experiencing homelessness in Brighton & Hove. She is also working with the Brighton and Hove Land Trust on a project funded by the Civic Power Fund, that empowers local communities to interrogate recent and forthcoming developments.\n\nCentral to Rebecca's academic practice is the belief that scholars must work in partnership with their communities to tackle the many global challenges our world faces. She pursues this at the University of Brighton as Deputy Director for the Centre for Applied Politics, Philosophy and Ethics, where she supports other scholars to understand the real world practical impacts of their researach. She designed the pioneering suite of Global Challenges modules that encourages students to pursue their own research projects and find solutions to Global Challenges. In 2023, she was awarded a One Brighton Award in 2023 for research-linked teaching, in recognition of these modules. She is the Course Leader for BA Politics and Social Change and the Employability, Placements and Partnership lead for the School of Humanities and Social Sciences.\n\nRebecca's other research and teaching interests include the history of gender and sexuality; the global history of contemporary capitalism; war and conflict; and the history and politics of twentieth and twenty-first century Britain.\n\nMy current research is focused on disability, looking at historical and contemporary forms of disability theory and politics. I established and co-ordinate the ‘Disability Politics’ strand of CAPPE, which hosts a series of community-led research events and collaborative projects, exploring current issues facing disabled people. I am committed to putting disabled people's voices at the centre of my research, and to transforming academic methodologies, practice and forms of publishing, to ensure meaningful accessibility.\n\nI also work on feminist theory and politics, with a focus on issues of social reproduction and reproductive politics. I am also interested in the entanglement of gender, sexuality, disability, and race, through the history and legacies of public health policies, population control, and eugenics. I have recently worked with ‘From Small Beginnings’ and the ‘Global Anti-Eugenics Forum,’ facilitating research on the legacies of eugenics within intellectual paradigms, state infrastructures, social policies and the built environment of the UK. Alongside Vicky Margree, I established and co-ordinate the 'Politics of Reproduction' strand of CAPPE, which runs regular reading groups, academic and non-academic talks, and conferences on contemporary issues around reproduction.\n\nI have previously written on the politics and aesthetics of contemporary artistic practice, specialising in the Conceptual Art movement of the 1960s-70s, often taken to be the index of art’s ‘globalisation’. Situating Conceptual Art within a broad and heterogeneous ‘conceptualist’ tendency, inherent to postwar art in many parts of the world, my work traced the varying manifestations—and resistances—to the conceptual form that emerged through the radical politics and aesthetics of different regions.\n\nMy broader research interests include philosophy, critical theory, the history of capitalism and radical and revolutionary politics. I teach across the Humanities subject area, acting as module leader for ‘The History of Sex and Gender,’ and ‘Body Politics, Body Ethics,’ and co-designed and teach on the Politics degree, BA (Hons) Politics, Sex, Gender.\n\nMy reseach interests are in contemporary literature and culture, most specifically in Black British and post-communist/'Eastern European' writing. Recent publications in these areas include 'Eastern Europeans and BrexLit' (JPW Special Issue Writing Brexit: Colonial Remains), 'Redressing Racist Legacies in the Melancholic Nation: Anger and Silences in Andrea Levy’s Fruit of the Lemon' (Special In Memoriam Issue of Ariel: A Review of International English Literature, ed. by Henghameh Saroukhani, Sarah Lawson-Welsh and Michael Perfect).\n\nMy 2019 monograph - the first book about the representations of 'Eastern European' migrants in contemporary British literature and culture - provides a comprehensive study of this 'wave' of migration to the UK and Western Europe following the enlargement of the EU in the 21st century, the social and political changes after the fall of communism, and the Brexit vote. It explores the recurring figures of 'Eastern Europeans' as a new reservoir of cheap labour in multiple contemporary cultural texts:\n\nhttps://www.palgrave.com/gp/book/9781137537911#aboutBook\n\nMy recent activities have been focused on building long-lasting community partnerships, most notably with New Writing South (acting as one of their Trustees), Marlborough Productions and The Centre for the Study of Sexual Dissidence (Sussex University) through our co-organisation and co-curation of the The Coast is Queer, UK's biggest LGBTQIA+ literature festival https://coastisqueer.com/, Afrori Books (through book clubs and AHRC Ignite projects) https://afroribooks.co.uk/, and the Brighton Book Festival (as core team member) /https://www.brightonbookfestival.co.uk/.\n\nRecent Funded Projects\n\n'ARK' - anti-racist kids club - community partnership project with Afrori Books, Blatchington Mill School and Cardinal Newman School (funded by AHRC Ignite 3.2) to deliver Afrori's flagship 6 weeks' anti-racist kids workshops to Y7 and Y9 pupils, and train Brighton Univeristy's students who are interested in anti-racist education (completed June-July 2024; details upcoming on the DeCol blog).\n\n'Reading to Resist, Reading to Belong: A Space for Black Writing'- community partnership project with Afrori and Diversity Lewes (funded by AHRC Ignite 3.1) explores how the bookshop acts as a space of community and belonging and what the act of reading Black Literature in Brighton means in terms of anti-racist practice, resistance, and representation, as well as how it can promote wellbeing, pleasure and joy in an increasingly hostile environment for racialised communities. Details of the project can be found here: https://blogs.brighton.ac.uk/decolonisingatfalmer/reading-to-resist-reading-to-belong-community-university-partnership/. The title of the project was inspired by Prof Suzanne Scafe's talk for the DeCol Collective: https://blogs.brighton.ac.uk/decolonisingatfalmer/reading-to-resist-the-disruptive-potential-of-black-british-literature/\n\nCartography of the Political Novel in Europe (CAPONEU) (EU Horizon, co-I) - aims to assess the political novel as an important element of European political, social and cultural heritage.

She has published widely on democratic theory, the politics of care, aesthetics, ethics, equality, extremism, transnational populism, UK politics and policy. Her book Disorienting democracy: politics of emancipation (2017, Routledge) juxtaposed Rancière’s thought with that of Butler, Cavell, Menke and Derrida to draw out the practical implications of Rancière’s writing for emancipatory political strategising. Her collaboration with Adriana Cavarero, Judith Butler, and Bonnie Honig, Towards a Feminist Ethics of Nonviolence (co-edited with Tim Huzar, 2021, Fordham) brings these thinkers into conversation with other leading feminist and gender theorists to argue that we need to attend more carefully to political infrastructural organisation if we are to construct a less violent world.\n\nClare's work currently falls under two broad themes 1) evaluating how we might strengthen democracy to oppose authoritarianism, extremism, and right wing populism via a reworking of the democratic welfare state in the 21st C language of wellbeing; 2) understanding the role of affect (e.g. love, rage, grief) in contemporary movements for social justice, both online and in the streets.\n\nClare’s research is primarily motivated by concern about the relationship between inequality and violence and unrest and how we can design feasible but socially just policies to respond to these in advanced capitalist democracy. Working at the interstices of ethics, aesthetics, poststructuralism, democratic, and gender theory, she is fascinated by concepts of social order and disorder; finitude and the edges of being and knowledge; the inter-play of faith, reason, perception, belief and action; and the varied ways in which social animals communicate with one another and both make themselves (or fail to make themselves) understood and how we seek (or fail to seek) to understand others.\n\nClare welcomes inquiries for doctoral research and is available to supervise PhDs in any area related to her work.

Areas of interest are workplace cooperatives, direct forms of democracy and creative labour. His continuing project is to sketch the organisational contours of a democratically planned economy beyond the boundaries of market and statehood. The main thinkers cover in his work are G.D.H. Cole, John Rawls, Karl Marx, Peter Kropotkin, Micheal Bakunin, Roberto Michels, Frederick Hayek and J.J. Rousseau. The endorsements for his second book are as follows.\n\n\"Capitalism is in crisis, but all the alternatives appear to be discredited. The Defetishised Society is a remarkable achievement that indicates the preliminary steps beyond this impasse. Chris Wyatt demonstrates the contemporary relevance of Marx's critique of alienation, reification, and fetishism. But he goes beyond Marx and critique by showing how advanced capitalist societies can draw on reserves of libertarian potential to move beyond the crises of technocratic capitalism, stagnant social democracy and state socialism in decline. The book will surely be one of the most important works of political theory for years to come.\"- Darrow Schecter, University of Sussex\"The Defetishized Society analyses our commodified lives, both through Marx's theory of commodity fetishism and the fetishism of commodities we see in everyday society today. But Chris Wyatt does not just interpret the world. He also looks at how to change it. His book goes argues for a system of economic democracy that exposes commodity fetishism. Wyatt's libertarian socialist approach offers an alternative to both the libertarianism of the right and the statism of the left.This book is important, sophisticated and relevant. It is embedded in a solid theoretical grounding but also attuned to concrete contemporary realities. It is academically sound and sophisticated yet also develops political implications and practical possibilities.\" -Luke Martell, Professor of Political Sociology, University of Sussex\"Wyatt's book is topical and important. Well-informed and clearly written, it describes a radical economic and political alternative to the the sorry present disorder. He draws on G. D. H. Cole's libertarian socialism, Rawls's work on the equitable distribution of resources, and Marx's ideas on commodity fetishism. The resulting synthesis provides provides a powerful argument for a New Economic Democracy which would provide an alternative cooperative mode of production and. equally important, a corresponding mode of consumption. If enough people read this book, and act on it, there is hope for us yet.\" - David Mclellan, Professor of Political Theory, Goldsmiths College, University of London, UK.\n\nBeatriz’s research interests go beyond the academic sphere. She is fundamentally an activist academic. She is a member of the Environmental Peacebuilding Association (EnPax), The Gender and Development Network (GADN), the Peace Research Seminar (SIP), the Women and Gender Constituency (WGC), one of the nine stakeholder groups of the United Nations Framework for the Convention of Climate Change (UNFCCC), and the Women’s International League for Peace and Freedom (WILPF), where she is part of the Executive board in both its UK and Spain branches. Since 2020, she actively participates in WILPF’s WPS, Environment and Climate Justice working groups, and since 2023 she coordinates the research and actions around the Fossil fuel non-proliferation treaty initiative within WILPF Spain.\n\nDuring the academic year 2022-2023, she is a PRG co-representative at the University’s Committee of Research Ethics and Integrity (UCOREI).\n\nIn early 2023, she co-coordinated the People & Planet’s petition for a fossil free careers service at the University of Brighton, for which, in May 2023, she submitted a motion to the University and College Union (UCU) Brighton branch, which passed unanimously.\n\nShe is a feminist, a pacifist, a unionist and an ecologist.\n\nMy PhD research looks at the queer affects, practices and relations found in rural areas, and is based in both the School of Humanities and the School of Environment and Technology at the University of Brighton.\n\nAcademic understandings of sexuality often privilege urban centres as places where queer sex flourishes, which builds the assumption that sex must be visible and performed in order to be understood. My research challenges this metronormative link between ‘urbanity’ and ‘sex’. Instead, I explore ‘grey’, less-visible areas between sexual and non-sexual, somewhere and nowhere, and assert the queerness of non-metropolitan, ‘green’ areas.\n\nMy research interests can be categorised into 3 areas, all of which I approach using queer theory:\n\nAsexualities and Nonsexualities\n\nWhat can asexual people, communities and experiences teach us about sex, sexuality, desire and gender? Asexual people do not experience sexual attraction to others. Their livelihoods, perspectives and politics can therefore help us to critique systems of social and sexual control, like compulsory heterosexuality for example. I am interested in exploring the relations that people who do not experience sexual attraction have to 'sex' as a social function of power.\n\nI'm also interested in understanding 'nonsexual' ways of being, and uncovering their radical politics. Unlike asexuality, all people engage with nonsexual ways of relating and feeling. What happens when we understand friendship, romance or even loneliness as nonsexualities?\n\nRural Queer Studies\n\nThe countryside is often seen as a place that lacks queerness, or at least opportunities through which to live queerly. Even so, many queer people continue to live in rural areas. In fact, non-metropolitan space plays host to some very deviant and dissident sexualities and experiences, whose queerness remains underappreciated.\n\nI'm currently researching how one can respond to this tendency, and am doing so by studying queer relations, affects and identities in one rural area in SW England. I question the dominance of 'lack' and 'absence' in defining rural queer space, and am working towards new ways on conceptualising 'rural queer'.\n\nFeminist, Queer, Spatial and Critical Theory\n\nMy interest in theory is wide-ranging but is most powerfully informed by queer theory. My research attempts to queer concepts and learn from the margins, but it is also informed by intersectional and abolitionist feminist thinking, as well as poststructural and postmodern understandings of space, place and philosophy. As such my research has previously engaged with: Butler, Foucault, Haraway, Massey, Halperin, Sedgwick, Halberstam, Ahmed, Lorde, Deleuze and Guattari.\n\nMy main concern in this research process is to investigate how sovereign power is the origin of violence and evil, how it legitimizes its authority, sanctifies itself, and condemns its citizens to obedience. It is important to see how sovereign power creates meanings and through these meanings how it envelops and limits people's lives, and moreover, how threatens them. It is also necessary to reveal how sovereign power takes away the absolute freedom of the human race by force or indirectly through persuasion methods. Thus, the anticipated ultimate contribution of the study to the research field will be to emphasize and reveal why a new world order in which the sovereign state is not effective is necessary and important. In this context, the desire of a new world order needs vital justifications such as to understand and reveal the origin of the modern world's evil in which the sovereign powers dominate. As a matter of fact, even under the regimes that are called ideal regimes, people are the object of violence and they are subjected to all these by the state institutions and security forces. However, in the Middle East, the debates on regional and political order are generally addressed through elements that will ensure the statehood and interstate issues. Most of these debates are shaped around how these elements should be or the quest for an ideal regime. However, I believe that it should be discussed that the origins of the evil that people are exposed in this geography to despite the many different regimes are whether the elements of the regimes (economic, juridical, political and religious) and the relations of states with each other or the sovereign power, the sovereign state is itself. I think that in line with this purpose Agamben’s argument presents a significant scope to make sense of main issues such as terror, terror and state relations, endless war and violence in the Middle East despite their different regimes. He argues that the origin of all kinds of violence, control, surveillance, and oppression is neither religion nor law; it is biopolitical sovereigns. Moreover, according to him, the secret root of the regimes that are called ideal regimes comes to light with its secret biopolitical character, a character that presents itself as a bearer of the rights and formal liberties. In this context, Agamben's theory provides ontological elements of the biopolitics and governmentality that entail the world to a global civil war and reveal the metaphysical basis that prepares the ground for violence (Agamben, 1998). By following this perspective it can be possible to examine and reveal how the sovereign powers have abused citizen's rights through the power to recognize rights, and how they justify their violence by a paradoxical exclusion. Ultimately, the fact that this study reveals the real face of sovereigns in some special regions in the Middle East in all its details will explain why there is an objection to the modern order dominated by the sovereign powers.\n\nSelf-nelgect is a health and social care condition involving individuals, usually older adults, who, in some way, take insufficient care of themselves to an extent that is detrimental to their health. This condition takes a variety of forms including a lack of personal hygiene, poor nutrition and unmaintained home environments. Self-neglect is addressed under the Care Act 2014 within Safeguarding Adults through the application of specific sets of procedures which usually prioritise Mental Capacity Assessments. In practice, however, this condition presents a complexity of ethical dilemmas and challenegs which, whilst not unique within health and social care, come together in specific ways for self-neglect.\n\nThis thesis suggests that the problematic nature of self-neglect emerges from the legal, medical and conceptual framing employed. Despite their being underpinned by Human Rights concerns these frames lead to ageist, unjust and depersonalising practices based on pre-conceived moral assumptions and are detrimental to the individuals involved whose views are silenced.\n\nThis study constructs a thicker frame for self-neglect by starting with the views and understandings of individuals who self-neglect. It argues that both self-care and a lack of self-care are habitual activities that can change over time in response to physical and social experiences and as a consequence of decisions made, for some reasons, about other things. In this context the condition self-neglect becomes less about the individual's lack of capacity and capability to self-care, or stop self-neglecting. It becomes more about embodied beings constructed by their self-care and lack of self-care experiences who are positively coping with living a life. As such it offers the opportunity to identify different, less problematic approaches to self-neglect practice and intervention by health and social care practitioners\n\nIvonne is a decolonial scholar with a focus on sub-Saharan African material culture and art, museum histories and practice, and colonialism in Africa. She is a trained Art Historian and Anthropologist and therefore sees her practice as interdisciplinary. Much of her research is object lead focusing on object biographies and how material culture is a starting point for discussions around her broader research interests. Ivonne’s early research was focused on South Africa but this has shifted to a wider geo-political area. She is also interested in foregrounding scholars and cultural thinkers from this area in her work.\n\nHer focus on museums began in her MA where Ivonne critiqued the disparities in knowledge produced about a nkisi displayed at the British Museum and the Songye people of Central Africa. This critique was centred around the use of labels and display in western museums. This was taken further in her MPhil which compared the display and labelling of South African beadwork at the Pitt Rivers Museum in Oxford and the Wits Art Museum in Johannesburg. Here Ivonne focused more directly on decolonial scholarship and philosophy as well using a detailed museum ethnography to unpack the role of colonialism in western museums. This research also challenged concepts of art versus ethnographic object and the validity of western museum practice.\n\nIvonne is currently working on a Collaborating Doctoral Studentship with the Horniman Museum and Gardens in London to uncover how colonial histories of violence are embrocated in museum archives and how these destructive narratives continue to be present in museum displays and labels. This research seeks to find practical ways to decolonise archives and museums in collaboration with the museum. Much of Ivonne’s current interests are around imperial archives, the theory and practice of decolonialism from the global south, the geopolitics of knowledge, and museum practice in the west.\n\nThe dialectics of gay liberation in Britain in the sixties and seventies\n\nMy PhD research focuses on the history of the gay liberation movement in Britain and the visions of revolutionary social change it sought to theorise and embody. The project takes a dialectical approach to theory and history, combining marxist critical theory and an engagement with the articles, pamphlets, ephemera and photographs located in archives of the gay movement across the UK. Crucially, I am interested in how records and traces of gay life and gay experience during this period actively contribute to theories of sexuality, gender and capitalism and the short-circuiting of their interrelations. My aim is to situate and historicise these contributions according to the twists and turns of capital accumulation and class struggle in the late twentieth century with the view to rubbing against the grain of normative and progressivist narratives of gay history that dominate the present. The project is funded by the TECHNE/AHRC consortium.\n\nI am also a founding editor of Invert Journal, an independent journal of contemporary marxist thought focused on the abolition of gender and the liberation of feminised subjects.\n\nMy research is practice-based, working towards the development of a poetic memoir. This writing is a crip ecofeminist reflection on trauma and bereavement, addressing my own experiences of disability and gender-based violence, and finding parallels and affinities with the violence, trauma, and disablement that characterises ecocide, anthropocentrism, and the ideologies of climate catastrophe. As part of my commitment to crip / neuroqueer writing, I am exploring the political and intellectual significance of hybrid forms of writing, particularly those that can be defined as both critical and creative. This interest is equally informed by ecofeminist understandings of the human/nature binary, and how these categories might intersect with other binarisms both within and outside of the academy.\n\nAmong other methods, my writing is developed through a journey from Brighton back to my childhood home in south Devon. As well as an interest in the non-human as plant and animal, my work investigates the inhuman in notions of hauntedness, spectrality, and the supernatural. These are explored through the lens of a nueroqueer worldview, and negotiated alongside understandings of eco-trauma as an experience of the uncanny.\n\nAs an additional ongoing creative project, I am currently developing a collection of poetry using the major arcana of the tarot as vehicles through which to understand narratives of the self in relation to landscape. This project is undertaken as part of a writer's residency at Treadwell's Books, and is funded through my Techne scholarship.\n\nMy research focuses on the antiwork movement, a loosely defined collective that rose to prominence during the Covid-19 pandemic. Social media sites such as Reddit and Facebook have become hubs for antiwork supporters. Growing interest in the subject is reflected in the popularity of the r/antiwork subreddit, which has more than 2.5 million subscribers.\n\nThere is little agreement within forums about the meaning of antiwork. Instead, members have diverse intentions, which range from seeking minor workplace reforms to attempting to eliminate capitalism. Media narratives often characterise supporters as being young and apathetic. However, it is clear that supporters differ in terms of their aspirations and the extent to which they are willing to question working habits.\n\nResearch into the movement is also topical. The pandemic has intensified discussions around work and contributed to scepticism of careerist principles. Meanwhile, phenomena such as the Great Resignation have revealed widespread dissatisfaction with contemporary employment.\n\nMy project seeks to understand which antiwork identities are being formed, and how members’ backgrounds, attitudes, and experiences inform the development of antiwork identities. The research has a digital focus, and will explore how antiwork identities are expressed in and shaped by digital spaces. In doing so, it will consider the views of both regular contributors and key informants such as forum moderators.\n\nMy research interests fall under the umbrella of linguistic pragmatics, that is the study of utterance interpretation and meaning in context. I am not a traditional linguist. In my work I look into areas that are not considered linguistic... property, such as emotions, art and aesthetics. Artworks communicate something slippery that often words cannot fully express; they communicate something ineffable. And that to me, it's really exciting!\n\nIn my work, I explore the concept of ineffability in verbal and non-verbal art and aesthetic experience. My framework is relevance theory, a theory of communication and cognition. I'm looking into how relevance theory can be applied to aesthetics and the interpretation of art and also what is the role of emotions in aesthetic appreciation. In my thesis, I also look into the influence of neuroaesthetics, ekphrastic poetry, and the ineffability of the Parthenon Sculptures. In a rather recent epiphany I had (it happens sometimes!), a few months before I started my final year, I designed a pilot study. I conducted ten semi-structured individual interviews during which participants were asked to perform an aesthetic judgement task, an affective task and a selection task. The stimuli for the tasks were images of paintings and sculptures and two haiku poems. Apart from the tasks, I included questions on aesthetic experience based on the participants' recent or past experiences with an artwork of their choice. I used relevance theory as an exploratory method of analysis to interpret and discuss the data.\n\nMy work has been influenced by a recent affective turn in relevance-theoretic pragmatics and Tim Wharton's work on pragmatics and emotion. The working title of my doctoral thesis is Art, affect, and mind: Exploring the ineffable.\n\nI am interested in the way in which modern property relations violently shape lives and relationships and how to move beyond that - as a political project not just an intellectual exercise. This includes research into how to theorise history and how to historize the present.\n\nIn my dissertation I look at property’s violence, i.e. how property materializes in and through our (gendered, sexualised and racialised) relationships with others, ourselves and our bodies, – and try to excavate (imagined) alternatives. Therefore, I look at the continuities of historical regimes of property. Here, ownership struggles in colonial capitalism are central; more specifically in my case, constellations of property and kinship in German colonial (after)lives. The role of colonial intervention in sexuality, family and inheritance structures in the context of dispossession and propertisation brings out (struggles around) articulations of race, gender and class and the properties of body and nation(/state-building). Thus, I am interested in how the past lives on and how we might (fight to) live differently in the now."
