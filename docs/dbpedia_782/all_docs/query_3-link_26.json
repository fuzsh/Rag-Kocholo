        "text": "Overview\n\nBiography\n\nEsther Leslie has research interests in political theories of aesthetics and culture and the poetics of science and technology, as well as animation, in an expanded sense. She has a particular focus on thinkers associated with the Frankfurt School, including Walter Benjamin, T.W. Adorno, Kracauer, Bloch. Recent work includes a thorough and experimental history of Weimar radio and BBC exile history through the figure of Ernst Schoen. She is also frequently engaged to work with and in museums and galleries - recently, for two examples, on a history of the impact of ICI in Teesside and in relation to extensive artistic research investigations of milk and dairy. She has written on animation in its narrow and broadest senses. and co-runs a research platform: Animate Assembly She is academic lead for a museum in Somers Town that focuses on histories of locality and questions of social justice.\n\nHer books include Walter Benjamin: Overpowering Conformism (Pluto 2000), and Hollywood Flatlands, Animation, Critical Theory and the Avant Garde (Verso 2002), Synthetic Worlds: Nature, Art and the Chemical Industry (Reaktion, 2005) and Walter Benjamin (Reaktion 2007), Derelicts: Thought Worms from the Wreckage(Unkant, 2014), Liquid Crystals: The Science and Art of a Fluid Form (Reaktion, 2016) and, with Melanie Jackson, Deeper in the Pyramid (Banner Repeater, 2018) and The Inextinguishable (EVA International, Limerick, 2020).\n\nShe studied German and spent 2 years at the Free University in Berlin, which undergirds her translation practice. Her translations include Georg Lukacs, A Defence of 'History and Class Consciousness' (Verso 2002) and Walter Benjamin: The Archives (Verso, 2007), On Photography (Reaktion, 2015) and, with Sam Dolbear and Sebastian Truskolaski, Walter Benjamin The Storyteller: Tales out of Loneliness, (Verso, 2016).\n\nShe is a Fellow of the British Academy.\n\nHighlights\n\nDeeper in the Pyramid: Share of Throat with Melanie Jackson, in exhibition, Wellcome Gallery: 30 March – 10 September 2023\n\nThe exhibition will include contemporary objects and artworks by Julia Bornefeld, Sarah Pucill, Hetain Patel, and Lucy + Jorge Orta, amongst others, as well as new commissions by Danielle Dean, Jess Dobkin, and Ilana Harris-Babou. It also features a 2023 iteration of ‘Deeper in the Pyramid’, Melanie Jackson and Esther Leslie’s major project exploring milk’s seepage into every aspect of our daily lives.\n\nWellcome: Milk exhibtion\n\nAcademic lead and founder of the People's Museum Somers Town:\n\nLost/Found: Somers Town\n\nTo celebrate Verso’s new edition of The Storyteller by Walter Benjamin, Esther Leslie (writer and translator of many books including The Storyteller, and Professor of Political Aesthetics at Birkbeck, London) and Stuart Jeffries (journalist and author of many books including Grand Hotel Abyss) discuss the life and legacy of Walter Benjamin. From his relationship with his peers, the other members of the Frankfurt School, and his cultural heritage, to his use of, and feelings about, technological advancements, to his approach to storytelling, writing and language more broadly, join Esther and Stuart for this fascinating and wide-ranging discussion of one of Western Marxism's most important philosophers.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU73rMJ1vpg\n\nOn Walter Benjamin's Culture and Barbarism, video commissioned by Culture Matters site\n\nWalter Benjamin: Culture and Barbarism\n\nTranscript here\n\nGuest on Walter Benjamin: In Our Time, BBC Radio 4\n\nMelvyn Bragg and guests discuss the remarkable philosopher and critic whose ideas, developed in the 1930s, became highly influential after his death while escaping the Holocaust.\n\nWalter Benjamin: In Our Time\n\nNew book coming soon:\n\nDissonant Waves\n\nErnst Schoen and Experimental Sound in the 20th century\n\nBy Sam Dolbear and Esther Leslie\n\nGoldsmiths Press, 11 July 2023\n\nDials, knobs, microphones, clocks; heads, hands, breath, voices. Ernst Schoen joined Frankfurt Radio in the 1920s as programmer and accelerated the potentials of this collision of bodies and technologies. As with others of his generation, Schoen experienced crisis after crisis, from the violence of war, the suicide of friends, economic collapse, and a brief episode of permitted experimentalism under the Weimar Republic for those who would foster aesthetic, technical, and political revolution. The counterreaction was Nazism—and Schoen and his milieux fell victim to it, found ways out of it, or hit against it with all their might.\n\nDissonant Waves tracks the life of Ernst Schoen—poet, composer, radio programmer, theorist, and best friend of Walter Benjamin from childhood—as he moves between Frankfurt, Berlin, Paris, and London. It casts radio history and practice into concrete spaces, into networks of friends and institutions, into political exigencies and domestic plights, and into broader aesthetic discussions of the politicization of art and the aestheticization of politics. Through friendship and comradeship, a position in state-backed radio, imprisonment, exile, networking in a new country, re-emigration, ill-treatment, neglect, Schoen suffers the century and articulates its broken promises.\n\nAn exploration of the ripples of radio waves, the circuits of experimentation and friendship, and the proposals that half-found a route into the world—and might yet spark political-technical experimentation.\n\npress notice here\n\nSOME ONLINE LECTURES\n\nDevice and Designs on Us\n\nA lecture at Bard Graduate Centre, 2019\n\nLink to video of lecture\n\nThese Tears, This Gas, These Turbulent Times\n\na lecture for the Summer School as School in Pristina, August 2022\n\nEsther Leslie: Tears, Gas, Turbulent Times Gas at Summer School as School 2022, Pristina, Kosovo\n\nExhibition talk: Professor Esther Leslie on Bassam Al Sabah\n\nGlitter and gleam, reflection, particles, skins for sale, polygons: what makes up the lure of the digital world?

For her, the relay between these aspects has featured in much of her work – whether it is the exploration of how aesthetic innovations, art and culture, respond or react to liberatory revolutionary situations, or whether it is the ways in which an authoritarian regime turns aesthetics and art into a weapon of control, as something to be censored and policed, lest it threaten the social order. Much of her work on Walter Benjamin, Theodor Adorno, Siegfried Kracauer, on Nazi film and photography, on Stalinist Socialist Realism, on madness and expression, has tracked these connections. Through this work, she came to the theme of animation, which she has interpreted as a philosophically attuned form, inserting itself into political contexts in a variety of intriguing ways. Her more recent work, developing out of a fascination with colour in representation, has taken her political, aesthetic and interdisciplinary approaches into the study of technology and science, under the mantle of what she calls a poetics of science. Two aspects not always thought in tandem are again combined. One result of this was the study of synthetic dye production in Germany, where colour, artifice, politics, philosophy, company and art histories combine. A new book looks at the legacy of chemcial production in the Teesside region of the UK. Her earlier work on animation stuck with cel and model animation, but the shift of the industry into computer generation, and the suffusing of this CGI everywhere, led to investigations of liquid crystals, touchscreens and a highly expanded idea of what it means to be animated now. Newer work explores the poetics and politics of milk and butter production, the metaphorical impulses of Fog and Cloud Computing and what type of atmospheres they produce and are produced in.\n\nI am an editor of the journal Historical Materialism: Research in Critical Marxism:\n\nhttps://www.historicalmaterialism.org/journal\n\nI edit a book series with Pluto Press, Marxism in Culture:\n\nhttps://www.plutobooks.com/pluto-series/marxism-and-culture/\n\nI am on the Isaac and Tamara Deutscher Prize Committee which awards each year an accolade to one book which exemplifies the best and most innovative new writing in or about the Marxist tradition:\n\nhttp://www.deutscherprize.org.uk/wp/\n\nResearch Centres and Institutes\n\nBirkbeck Institute for the Humanities\n\nResearch projects\n\nAnimate Assembly: Animation and New Life.\n\nAbstract\n\nANIMATE ASSEMBLY is concerned with how the animate and the inanimate are arranged toward each other, what kinds of engagements this allows for, and which ones it disables. The ASSEMBLY commissions contributors to produce entries for a speculative glossary of animation today, and takes shape through the dialogues and debates they prompt.\n\nAnimation today has proliferated into fields of 3D simulation and computational models, in contexts ranging from economic modelling and ecological activism to architectural and city design, medicine and surgery, educational formats and military training programmes. It has become a significant visualization tool for artists, cellular biologists, financial analysts and urban planners alike. Digital animations intervene in life processes at both the level of individual bodies, to prolong and destroy life, and at the vast scale of planetary phenomena. The political contexts and consequences of animation have changed so that digital animation is now deployed in human rights tribunals, global activism campaigns and speculative future visions. Under these conditions, life is enmeshed in animation in the vast network of software, infrastructure and labour, which require studies far beyond the more limited and specific animation of the past, much of which unfurled in cinemas or on TVs. The expanded critical role of digital animation requires a reconsideration of the political and ethical implications of the animated image and a reimagining of what it means to propose animation as constitutive of life, with all the ontological and experiential resonances of this phrase: animation as a form of life, as a modelling of life, as a site for life-impacting decisions.\n\nFunded by\n\nArts and Humanities Research Council\n\nDeeper in the Pyramid (2)\n\nAbstract\n\nA second iteration of the project Deeper in the Pyramid (first shown in various venues in London, Birmingham and Nottingham) has been commissioned by Wellcome Gallery, as part of an exhibition on Milk for March 2022.\n\nThis project is commissioned and funded by Wellcome Trust\n\nOutcomes\n\nAn extensive display with written elements in Wellcome Galleries for 6 months.\n\nTurbid Media\n\nAbstract\n\nWork on a monograph: Fog, froth and foam – as matter and metaphors - accumulate: e.g. particulate fogs around industry, toxic foams drifting from bodies of water, fogged computer networks, microfoam-coffee and bubble teas, dangerous foams in cladding, ‘social bubbles’, visualisations of space-time foam. These are turbid – in Goethean terms, generative of vision. In modern terms, ‘turbid media’ is what physicists call muddy water or fogged air, with visible dust. Apprehended through the Goethean Truebe (conceived at the start of industrialism) and turbid media (as monitored in a postindustrial digital anthropocene), what effects and social potentials are produced by and through fogs, froths and foams.\n\nOutcomes\n\nmonograph, 2023\n\nDissonant Waves: Ernst Schoen and Experimental Sound in the 20th Century\n\nAbstract\n\nAn investigation of the cultures and technologies of early radio and how a generation of cultural operators—with Schoen at the center—addressed crisis and adversity.\n\nDials, knobs, microphones, clocks; heads, hands, breath, voices.

Chemical City was a large thematic exhibition on the legacies of chemicals production in the Tees Valley. Starting with a focus on plastics manufacturing in the area, the exhibition travels through broader social, economic, material and ecological themes. It charts relationships between early experiments with synthetic fibres and dyes and contemporary innovations in more sustainable fashion through historical materials and contemporary design products. Artists’ painting, sculpture and film trace the impacts of twentieth century manufacturing on people and places.\n\nThis project was funded and commissioned by MIMA\n\nOutcomes\n\nAs critical advisor on the exhibition I wrote and read three extended essays that frame the presentation. They can be read on the website or listened to on Soundcloud.\n\nI contributed to Chemical City – Then and Now, a digital publication that goes deep into the themes of the exhibition. Thoughts, memories, artworks, archival photographs and poems are gathered as reflections on a history that continues to impact on the lives of people today. It can be read on the MIMA website.\n\nThe Inextinguishable\n\nAbstract\n\nJackson and Leslie’s collaborative publication The Inextinguishable is an ongoing exploration of milk, long associated with Golden Vein. Milk is a primal fluid, identified with care – yet it’s sensational qualities are captured by science in bio-political skeins of big data analysis in Ireland and internationally to make it one of the most technologized fluids on the planet.\n\nThis project was commissioned and funded by the Limerick Biennale, 2020-21\n\n(with Melanie Jackson)\n\nOutcomes\n\nA newspaper with original research on milk production and associated themes, with articular reference to the context of Ireland.\n\nBusiness and community\n\nMedia\n\nI am happy to receive enquiries from the media on the following topics:\n\nFrankfurt School\n\nMarxism\n\nAesthetics\n\npoetics of science\n\nGerman history\n\nWalter Benjamin\n\nAdorno\n\nKracauer\n\ntechnology and culture\n\nchemical industry in history\n\ncommunity history\n\nSomers Town\n\nanimation\n\nOutreach\n\nI co-founded The Peoples Museum Somers Town, which is located at 52 Phoenix Road, London NW1 1ES. I act as its academic lead. In October 2022, we were nominated as one of three projects for a Radical Changemakers Award by the Museums Association.\n\nSomers Town has a rich and extraordinary history. It has been home to reformers, rebels, world historical figures who cultivated here world-impacting ideas, such as Anarchism, Feminism, Chartism, Communism and Pan-Africanism. It is a place of significant housing schemes, such as the Polygon, the St Pancras House Improvement Society housing, and the two estates, Ossulston and Oakshott Court, both of which adopt a European idiom. Somers Town has been a spirited place – once bustling with markets and pubs. It has also, throughout its whole history, from the 1780s, been a place of migration, drawing in people from across the country, the European continent and the world.\n\nI curated our first exhibition - Lost and Found in Somers Town. Its website is here: http://lostfound.aspaceforus.club/\n\nWe have a busy programmes of walks, talks, work experience - in which I am centrally involved. Our broader website is here:\n\nhttps://aspaceforus.club/\n\nSlovenian TV programme made about my life and work, 2017\n\nEpisode here\n\nI have worked with museums as an artist-researcher, as a writer and as an academic consultant.
