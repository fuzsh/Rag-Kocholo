        "text": "Johann Ernst Fabri (July 16, 1755 – May 30, 1825) was a German geographer and statistician born in Oels, Silesia. In 1776 he began his studies of theology at the University of Halle, but his focus soon turned to geography and history. Later he served as a Privat-docent at the University of Göttingen, where he was influenced by distinguished scholars that included Johann Christoph Gatterer, August Ludwig von Schlözer and Johann Friedrich Blumenbach. In 1786 he moved to Jena as an associate professor of geography and statistics, and in 1794 became a professor at the University of Erlangen. For much of his career Fabri received no pay for his lectures, only in 1815 did he begin to receive a fixed salary. Selected publications Elementargeographie (Elementary Geography), Halle 1780–90, 4 volumes Handbuch der neuesten Geographie für Akademien und Gymnasien (Textbook of New Geography for Academics and Gymnasium), Halle 1784–85 Verzeichniss von aeltern und neuern Land- und Reisebeschreibungen, 1784 (with Gottlieb Heinrich Stuck) Abriß der Geographie für Schulen, (Outline of Geography), 1785 Geographisches Magazin (Geographic Magazine), Dessau und Leipzig 1783–85, 4 volumes Neues geographisches Magazin (New Geographic Magazine), 1785–87 Geographie für alle Stände (Geography for all Status Groups), 1786–1808, 5 volumes Magazin für die Geographie (Magazine for Geography), Nürnberg 1797, 3 volumes Abriß der natürlichen Erdkunde (Outline of Natural Geography), 1800 Encyklopädie der historischen Hauptwissenschaften und Hülfsdoctrinen etc., 1808\n\nKarl Andree (20 October1808 – 10 August1875) was a Germangeographer. Andree was born in Brunswick. He was educated at Jena, Göttingen, and Berlin. After having been implicated in a students' political agitation he became a journalist, and in 1851 founded the newspaper Bremer Handelsblatt. From 1855, however, he devoted himself entirely to geography and ethnography, working successively at Leipzig and at Dresden. In 1862 he founded the important geographical periodical Globus. His works include Nordamerika in geographischen und geschichtlichen Umrissen (Brunswick, 1854), Geographische Wanderungen (Dresden, 1859), and Geographie des Welthandels (Stuttgart, 1867-1872). He died at Wildungen. His son Richard Andree followed in his father's career.\n\nRichard Andree (26 February1835 – 22 February1912) was, like his father Karl Andree, a Germangeographer noted for devoting himself especially to ethnography. He wrote numerous books on this subject, dealing notably with the races of his own country, while an important general work was Ethnographische Parallelen und Vergleiche (Stuttgart, 1878). Andree was born in Brunswick. As a director of the Geographical Institute of Velhagen & Klasing, Leipzig (1873-1890), he also took upcartography, having a chief share in the production of the Physikalisch-Statistischer Atlas des Deutschen Reichs (together with O. Peschel, Leipzig, 1877), and Droysens Allgemeiner Historischer Handatlas, (Leipzig, 1886), as well as school atlases. His main work, however, is his Allgemeiner Handatlas (Leipzig, first edition 1881, final edition 1937), one of the most comprehensive world atlases of all times. The early editions of the Times Atlas of the World (1895-1900) are based on this atlas, as was Cassell's Universal Atlas.Andree also continued the editorship of the Globus (1891-1903). Andree died on a train-ride between Munich and Nuremberg.\n\nWalter Christaller (1893 – 1969), was a Germangeographer whose principal contribution to the discipline is Central Place Theory , first published in 1933. This groundbreaking theory was the foundation of the study of cities as systems of cities, rather than simple hierarchies or single entities. Before 1914, Christaller began studies in philosophy and political economics and subsequently served in the army; later, during the twenties, he pursued a variety of occupations. In 1929 he resumed graduate studies that led to his famous dissertation on Central Place Theory in 1933. At the end of the 1930s he held a short-lived academic appointment, but then joined the Nazi Party in 1940. He moved into government service, in Himmler's SS-Planning and Soil Office, during the Second World War. Christaller’s task was to draw up plans for reconfiguring the economic geography of Germany's eastern conquests (\"General plan of the East\") – primarily Czechoslovakia and Poland, and if successful, Russia itself. Christaller was given special charge of planning occupied Poland, and he did so using his central place theory as an explicit guide. [2] After the War he joined the Communist Party and became politically active. In addition, he devoted himself to the geography of tourism. From 1950 forward, his Central Place Theory was used to restructure municipal relationships and boundaries in the Federal Republic of Germany and the system is still in place today.\n\nAt the end of the 1930s he held a short-lived academic appointment, but then joined the Nazi Party in 1940.

Between 1882 and 1887, Drygalski studied mathematics and natural science at the University of Königsberg, Bonn, Berlin and Leipzig. He graduated with a doctorate thesis about ice shields in Nordic areas. Between 1888 and 1891, he was an assistant at the Geodetic Institute and the Central Office of International Geodetics in Berlin. .\n\nDrygalski led two expeditions between 1891 and 1893, which were supplied by the Society for Geoscience of Berlin. One expedition wintered during the winter between 1892 and 1893 in Western Greenland. He habilitated 1889 for geography and geophysics with the collected scientific evidence. In 1898, Drygalski became associate professor and 1899 extraordinary professor for geography and geophysics in Berlin. The Gauss enclosed in the ice. Photo taken from a balloon, the first aerial photography in Antarctica Drygalski led the first German South Polar expedition with the ship Gauss to explore the unknown area of Antarctica lying south of the Kerguelen Islands. The expedition started fromKiel in the summer of 1901. A small party of the expedition was also stationed on the Kerguelen Islands, while the main party proceeded further south. Drygalski also paid a brief call to Heard Island and provided the first comprehensive scientific information on the island's geology, flora and fauna. Despite being trapped by ice for nearly fourteen months until February 1903, the expedition discovered new territory in Antarctica, the Kaiser Wilhelm II Land with theGaussberg. The expedition arrived back in Kiel in November 1903. Subsequently, Drygalski wrote the narrative of the expedition and edited the voluminous scientific data. Between 1905 and 1931, he published twenty volumes and two atlases documenting the expedition\n\nAlfred Hettner (August 6, 1859, Dresden - August 31, 1941, Heidelberg) was a Germangeographer. He is known for his concept of chorology, the study of places and regions. Literary works Methodische Zeit- und Streitfragen, in: Geographische Zeitschrift, Bd. 29 (1923), S. 49-50 Die Geographie, ihre Geschichte, ihr Wesen und ihre Methoden, Breslau, 1927 Johann Baptist Homann (20 March1664 – 1 July1724) was a Germangeographer and cartographer, who made maps of the Americas . Homann was born in Oberkammlach near Kammlach, which is now in Bavaria. Although educated at aJesuit school, he eventually converted to Protestantism. In 1715 Homann was appointed Imperial Geographer of the Holy Roman Empire. Giving such privileges to individuals was an added right that theHoly Roman Emperor enjoyed. In the same year he was also named a member of the Prussian Academy of Sciences. Of particular significance to cartography were the imperial printing privileges. These protected for a time the authors in all scientific fields such as printers, copperengravers, map makers and publishers. They were also very important as recommendation for potential customers. In 1716 Homann published his masterpiece Grosser Atlas ueber die ganze Welt (Grand Atlas of all the World). Homann died in Nuremberg. He was succeed by the Homann heirs company, in business until 1848, known as \"Homann Erben\", \"Homannianos Heredes\", \"Heritiers de Homann\" abroad.\n\nHeinrich Kiepert (July 31, 1818 - April 21, 1899), Germangeographer, was born at Berlin as the son of a wealthy businessman. Already in his youth he traveled with his parents and had a particular interest in the geographic circumstances, which he carefully sketched. Among the friends of the family was the historian Leopold von Ranke, which advised the parents to support the boy's innate talent. The teacher and director of thegymnasium he attended was the young philologist August Meineke. He could fill the young Heinrich Kiepert with enthusiasm for the classical antiquity. During this time Kiepert already criticized the faulty execution of historic maps in school books. He was educated at the university of berlin, studying especially history, philology and geography. In 1840, in collaboration with Karl Ritter, he issued his first work, Atlas von Hellas und den hellenischen Kolonien, which brought him at once into eminence in the sphere of ancient historical cartography.\n\nIn 1848 his Historisch-geographischer Atlas der alten Welt appeared, and in. 1854 the first edition of theAtlas antiquus, which has obtained very wide recognition, being issued in English, French, Russian, Dutch and Italian. In 1894 Kiepert produced the first part of a larger atlas of the ancient world under the title Formae orbis antiqui; his valuable maps in Corpus inscriptionum latinarum must also be mentioned. In 1877 his Lehrbuch der alten Geographie was published, and in 1879 Leitfaden der alten Geographie, which was translated into English (A Manual of Ancient Geography, 1881) and into French. Among Kiepert's general works one of the most important was the excellent Neuer Handatlas über alle Teile der Erde (1855 et seq.), and he also compiled a large number of special and educational maps. Asia Minor was an area in which he took particular interest. He visited it four times in 1841-8; and his first map (1843-1846), together with his Karte des osmanischen Reiches in Asien (1844 and 1869), formed the highest authority for the geography of the region. Kiepert was professor of geography in the university of Berlin from 1854. He died at Berlin on April 21, 1899. He left unpublished considerable material in various departments of his work, and with the assistance of this his son Richard (b. 1846), who followed his father's career, was enabled to issue a map of Asia Minor in 24 sheets, on a scale of 1:400,000 (1902 et seq.), and to carry on the issue of Formae orbis antiqui.\n\nRichard Kiepert (September 13, 1846 - August 4, 1915) was a German cartographer born in Weimar. He was the son of famed geographerHeinrich Kiepert (1818-1899). Richard Kiepert studied geography and history in Berlin and Heidelberg, and in 1874 received his Doctorate of Philosophy at the University of Jena. Kiepert prepared maps from data amassed by German explorers of Africa that included Friedrich Gerhard Rohlfs (1831-1896) and Heinrich Barth(1821-1865). From 1874 until 1878 he worked on the compilation of Ferdinand von Richthofen's atlas of China, and from 1875 to 1887 he was editor of the geographical periodical Globus. Two important African geographic works of his were Deutscher Kolonialatlas and Spezialkarte von Deutsch-Ostafrika. From 1902 until 1908 he worked on the Spezialkarte von Kleinasien, a map of Asia Minor which was created on a 1:400,000 scale. After his father's death in 1899, he continued the work on the elder Kiepert's classic Formae Orbis Antiqui. In 1908 Kiepert was the recipient of the Carl Ritter Medal of the Geographical Society of Berlin, and in 1913 was given the honorary title of professor.\n\nKonrad Mannert (April 17, 1756 – September 27, 1834) was a Germanhistorian and geographer. Mannert was born in Altdorf bei Nürnberg, where he did his studies. In 1784 he became a teacher at the Sebaldusschule in Nuremberg, and in 1788 at the Ägidiusgymnasium there. In 1796 he became professor of history at the University of Altdorf, in 1805 at the University of Würzburg, in 1807 at the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich (then in Landshut), and from 1826 at the same university in its new location in Munich. He died in Munich in 1834. His historical work was known in particular for its focus on studying primary sources. Works Kompendium der deutschen Reichsgeschichte, Nuremberg, 1803 Älteste Geschichte Bojariens, Sulzbach, 1807 Kaiser Ludwig IV., Landshut, 1812 Geographie der Griechen und Römer, Nuremberg, 1795–1825, 10 volumes Tabula Peutingeriana, Munich, 1824 Geschichte Bayerns, Leipzig, 1826, 2 volumes Geschichte der alten Deutschen, besonders der Franken, Stuttgart, 1829–1832, 2 volumes\n\nKarl Gottlieb Mauch (May 7, 1837 - April 4, 1875) Stuttgart was a German explorer and geographer of Africa. He reported on the archaeological ruins of Great Zimbabwe in 1871. The interpretive theories of Mauch and his contemporaries have been largely discredited by modern historians and archaeologists. Karl Mauch was born in Stetten im Remstal (Wurtemberg) near Stuttgart on the 7 May 1837.\n\nAugust Meitzen (1822 – 1910) was a German geographer widely acknowledged as the founder of rural settlement geography. Meitzen was thePrussian special commissioner for land consolidation, concerned with redrawing property lines so as to reduce farm fragmentation. In this capacity, he traveled over much of the German countryside, becoming familiar with the agarian landscape. Not content to study only the field and cadastral patterns, he also gave detailed consideration to village types and folk architecture. He attended the first annual national meeting of German geographers in 1881 and read a paper on rural house types. Not an academician, Meitzen was nevertheless named honorary professor at the University of Berlin for many years. His classic work, which provided a scholarly foundation for the study of agricultural landscapes, was published in four volumes in 1895. This work’s English title is Settlement and Agrarian Character of the West and East Germans, of the Celts, Romans, Finns, and Slavs. Meitzen, more than any other scholar, was responsible for introducing the theme of cultural landscape into geography, and it was he who first proposed that landscape, particularly the relic forms, possessed diagnostic potential.\n\nHeinrich Theodor Menke (May 24, 1819 - May 14, 1892) was a German geographer who was a native of Bremen. He is remembered for his work in historical geography. Menke studied theology and philology at the University of Bonn, and in 1842 received his doctorate at Halle with a dissertation on ancient Lydia. Afterwards he worked as a schoolteacher in Bremen, but soon became dissatisfied with this line of work, and undertook legal studies in Berlinand Heidelberg. After attaining his degree he practiced law in Bremen, and later Vegesack. Throughout his life, Menke had an avid interest in geography, and via contact with Wilhelm Perthes (1783-1853) of the Justus Perthes Geographische Anstalt in Gotha, his primary vocational focus turned to edition and production of geographical atlases. In 1865 he published the third edition of Karl Spruner von Merz' Atlas Antiquus, and later produced the heavily revised third edition of Spruner's atlas of medieval and modern history- Hand-Atlas für die Geschichte des Mittelalters und die neueren Zeit (1871-1880). Menke died in Gotha on May 14, 1892. The island group Menkeøyane in the Svalbard archipelago is named in his honor.\n\nUniversity library Bibliotheca Albertina.\n\nJoseph Partsch (1851–1925) was a Germangeographer, born at Schreiberhau, Silesia. He studied at the University of Breslau, receiving his doctorate in 1874, and began teaching at the university, becoming later professor of geography. Here he remained until 1905, when on the death of Ratzel, he was called to the chair of geography at the University of Leipzig. His earlier writings were devoted to classical geography, but in later years he wrote extensively on glacial geology, the history of geography, and regional geography. In the last group are some of his best-known works, such as the systemic monographs on the Ionian Islands, the standard geography of central Europe, and the geography of Silesia. Among English-speaking people he is best known as the author of Central Europe (English, 1903; German, 1904), the English edition, prepared by H. J. Mackinder, appearing in the series \"The Regions of the World.\" This book was of particular value for its account of the physiography of the region which became the battle ground of Europe (1914, et seq.) and especially of the last chapter, \"The Conditions of National Defense.\"\n\nAlbrecht Penck (September 25, 1858 – March 7, 1945), was a Germangeographer and geologist and the father of Walther Penck. Born in Reudnitz near Leipzig, Penck became a university professor in Vienna from 1885 to 1906, and inBerlin from 1906 to 1927. There he was also the director of the Institute and Museum for Oceanography by 1918. Penck dedicated himself to geomorphology and climatology and raised the international profile of theVienna School of physical geography. In 1945, Penck died in Prague. Since 1886, he was married to the sister of the successful Bavarian regional writer Ludwig Ganghofer. In memory of Penck, the painter and sculptor Ralf Winkler adopted the nom de plume A. R. Penck in 1966. Albrecht Penck was elected a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in 1905\n\nWalther Penck (30 August 1888 – 29 September 1923) was an Austriangeographer, born in Vienna as son of geographer Albrecht Penck. Walther Penck worked 1912-1914 in Argentina as a geographer, and is best known for his contributions to the field of geomorphology. In particular he opposed key elements of the Davisiancycle of erosion, concluding that the process of uplift and denudation occur simultaneously, at a gradual and continuous rate. His book, Morphological Analysis of Landforms, was published posthumously in 1924 by his father. He died in Stuttgart, Germany.\n\nFriedrich Ratzel, 1844-1904 • BIO • Born 1844, Germany • Geographer by way of zoology/biology based on travels, esp. in post-Civil War America • Geography professor & prolific writer • “Aversion to people in big groups” (Wanklyn) • SIGNIFICANCE TO GEOGRAPHY • Human Geography: Anthropogeographie, 1882 • Political Geography: Politische Geographie, 1897 “Lebenstraum” (“living space”) • Ideas taken and transformed by others (including Hitler) into social darwinism, determinism\n\nFriedrich Ratzel (August 30, 1844, Karlsruhe, Baden – August 9, 1904, Ammerland) was a Germangeographer and ethnographer, notable for coining the term Lebensraum (\"living space\"). Ratzel's father was the head of the household staff of the Grand Duke of Baden. He attended high school in Karlsruhe for six years before being apprenticed at age 15 to apothecaries . In 1863, he went to Rapperswilon the Lake of Zurich, Switzerland, where he began to study the classics. After a further year as an apothecary at Mörs near Krefeld in the Ruhr area (1865-1866), he spent a short time at the high school in Karlsruhe and became a student ofzoology at the universities of Heidelberg, Jena and Berlin, finishing in 1868. He studied zoology in 1869, publishing Sein und Werden der organischen Welt on Darwin. After the completion of his schooling, Ratzel began a period of travels that see him transform from zoologist/biologist to geographer. He began field work in the Mediterranean, writing letters of his experiences. These letters led to a job as a traveling reporter for the Kölnische Zeitung(\"Cologne Journal\"), which provided him the means for further travel. Ratzel embarked on several expeditions, the lengthiest and most important being his 1874-1875 trip to North America, Cuba, and Mexico. This trip was a turning point in Ratzel’s career. He studied the influence of people of German origin in America, especially in the Midwest, as well as other ethnic groups in North America.\n\nHe produced a written work of his account in 1876, Städte-und Kulturbilder aus Nordamerika (Profile of Cities and Cultures in North America), which would help establish the field of cultural geography. According to Ratzel, cities are the best place to study people because life is \"blended, compressed, and accelerated\" in cities, and they bring out the \"greatest, best, most typical aspects of people\". Ratzel had traveled to cities such as New York, Boston, Philadelphia, Washington, Richmond, Charleston, New Orleans, and San Francisco. Upon his return in 1875, Ratzel became a lecturer in geography at the Technical High School in Munich. In 1876, he was promoted to assistant professor, then rose to full professor in 1880. While at Munich, Ratzel produced several books and established his career as an academic. In 1886, he accepted an appointment at Leipzig. His lectures were widely attended, notably by the influential American geographer Ellen Churchill Semple. Ratzel produced the foundations of human geography in his two-volume Anthropogeographie in 1882 and 1891. This work was misinterpreted by many of his students, creating a number of environmental determinists. He published his work on political geography, Politische Geographie, in 1897. It was in this work that Ratzel introduced concepts that contributed to Lebensraum and Social Darwinism. Ratzel continued his work at Leipzig until his sudden death on August 9, 1904 in Ammerland, Germany.\n\nFerdinand Freiherr von Richthofen (5 May 1833 – 6 October 1905) was a German traveller,geographer, and scientist. He was born in Carlsruhe, Prussian Silesia, and was educated in Breslau and Berlin. He traveled or studied in the Alps of Tyrol and the Carpathians in Transylvania. In 1860, he joined the Eulenburg Expedition, a Prussian expedition which visited Ceylon, Japan, Taiwan, Celebes, Java, thePhilippines, Siam, Burma between 1860 and 1862. From 1862 to 1868 he worked as a geologist in the United States discovering Goldfields in California\n\nThis was followed by several more trips ofChina, Japan, Burma, and Java. He published his geographical, geological, economic, and ethnological findings in three volumes with an atlas. In China he located the dried-up lake bed ofLopnur. He was also Professor of Geology at the University of Bonn beginning in 1875, Professor ofGeography at the University of Leipzig in 1883, and Professor of Geography at the Friedrich Wilhelm University of Berlin in 1886. Among his most famous students was Sven Hedin, the Swedish explorer. He served as President of the German Geographical Society for many years, and founded the Berlin Hydrographical Institute. He is noted for coining the terms \"Seidenstraße\" and \"Seidenstraßen\" = \"Silk Road(s)\" or \"Silk Route(s)\" in 1877.[1][2] He also standardized the practices of chorography and chorology. He died in 1905 in Berlin. Comstock Lode: Its Character, and the Probable Mode of Its Continuance in Depth (1866) China: The results of My Travels and the Studies Based Thereon (1877-1912, 5 vols. and atlas)\n\nFred K. Schaefer (7 July1904 - 6 June1953) was a geographer. He is considered as one of the pioneers of quantitative revolution. He is well-known for his article in flagship American periodical, Annals, Association of American Geographers called Exceptionalism in geography: A Methodological Examination It was both a repudiation of Richard Hartshorne's position in United States, and a call for a scientific approach to geography based upon the search for geographical laws (the ultimate form of a scientific generalization). Schaefer died before his article even appeared in print, and so he was never able to elaborate his argument, nor defend himself from Hartshorne's subsequent attack. But the article became a rallying point for the younger generation of economic geographers who were intent on reinventing the discipline as a science, or spatial science as it was later dubbed (Economic geography should move away from regionalism and become more scientific).\n\nJohann Heinrich von Thünen (24 June1783 - 22 September1850) was a prominent nineteenth century economist [1]. Von Thünen was a Mecklenburg (north German) landowner, who in the first volume of his treatise, The Isolated State (1826), developed the first serious treatment of spatial economics, connecting it with the theory of rent. The importance lies less in the pattern of land use predicted than in its analytical approach. Eberhard August Wilhelm von Zimmermann (August 17, 1743 – July 4, 1815) was a Germangeographer and zoologist. Zimmermann was Professor of Natural Science at Brunswick. He wrote Specimen Zoologiae Geographicae Quadrupedum (1777), one of the first works on the geographical distribution of mammals.\n\nHermann Wagner (June 23, 1840 - June 18, 1929) was a German geographer and cartographer who was a native of Erlangen. He was the son of anatomistRudolf Wagner (1805-1864) and brother to economistAdolph Wagner (1835-1917). He received his education at the University of Erlangen, and in 1868 went to work for the publishing firm \"Justus Perthes Geographische AnstaltGotha\".
