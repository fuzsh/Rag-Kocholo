Â Within the contexts set by New Historicism and Cultural Materialism, Shakespeare's plays, through polyphonic discourses and dialogues, create environments constructed in the relationships of his characters with one another and with the society on the basis of political and ideological considerations. In Shakespeare's theatrical environments, his characters play their political and ideological roles in a way similar to what happens in the real world politics. In such political and ideological environments, analysing polyphonic discourses and dialogues, critical readers can come up with some political and ideological concepts to analyse and explain the ways things happen and the reasons for why they happen. This study argues that one of these concepts is perception operation/management which Shakespeare uses in Julius Caesar as a means of political and ideological propaganda in the same way as is used in the contemporary real world, which creates a close association between the play's original context and contemporary political context through contemporary interpretations. Hence, this study deals with the role of perception operation/management in Brutus' manipulating attempts at political resistance to Julius Caesar's ruling, which paved the way for Caesar's assassination.\n\nUnderstanding Shakespeare's \"Julius Caesar\" Online: A Student Casebook to Issues, Sources, and Historical Documents.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nDerrick, Thomas\n\nThis casebook of materials about William Shakespeare's \"Julius Caesar\" will enrich students' understanding of the historical context of the play and encourage interpretations of its cultural meaning.

Julius Hallervorden's important contribution to the practice of neuropathology over a long career cannot be underestimated. However, his work as a pathologist during the Third Reich put him in close proximity with the implementation of biologic solutions (i.e., euthanasia) targeting those individuals with significant intellectual or physical disabilities in chronic-care facilities. The Nazi program of active euthanasia provided a scientific opportunity to gain quick access to pathologic materials. This opportunity was recognized and used by Hallervorden to achieve personal scientific objectives and research efforts. These efforts resulted in a number of postwar scientific publications using materials obtained through the euthanasia program. The participation of distinguished academic physicians in such a program provides a cautionary tale of the potential results of ethical compromise and the effects of the abrogation of personal autonomy in the setting of a totalitarian dictatorship.\n\nJULIUS CAESAR.

His remarks were taken up by Bede (d. 737, so that the two saints have never been forgotten, their cult surviving to this day. The author provides a detailed survey of discussion of Aaron and Julius over the centuries, and argues that their martyrdom was neither at Caerleon (in south-east Wales nor Chester (in north-west England, as suggested by numerous scholars, but at Leicester, another major city of Roman Britain. Working from epigraphic sources and taking into account ancient models of naming, the author attempts a reinterpretation of Legionum urbs in the original texts by emending it to Legorum urbs âcity of the Legores,â the Celtic people of the Leicester region. The latter, by the time of Gildas, was occupied by the Angles, while the city itself was abandoned, which may explain Gildasâs remarks, otherwise unclear if one identifies Legionum urbs with Caerleon or Chester. The author adduces both historical and linguistic arguments for his proposal and shows that it sheds new light on the history of early British Christianity.\n\nThe tragedy of Julius Caesar: power, ideal and treason\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nLuÃ­s Roberto Barroso\n\n2018-01-01\n\nFull Text Available This paper briefly revisits the plot of William Shakespeareâs play The Tragedy of Julius Caesar and seeks to reflect on power and human behavior at the dusk of the Roman Republic.

Abstracts\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nMachner, H.; Lieb, J.\n\n2000-08-01\n\nBefore summarizing details of the meeting, a short description of the spectrometer facility Big Karl is given. The facility is essentially a new instrument using refurbished dipole magnets from its predecessor. The large acceptance quadrupole magnets and the beam optics are new. Big Karl has a design very similar as the focussing spectrometers at MAMI (Mainz), AGOR (Groningen) and the high resolution spectrometer (HRS) in Hall A at Jefferson Laboratory with ÎE/E = 10 -4 but at some lower maximum momentum. The focal plane detectors consisting of multiwire drift chambers and scintillating hodoscopes are similar. Unlike HRS, Big Karl still needs Cerenkov counters and polarimeters in its focal plane; detectors which are necessary to perform some of the experiments proposed during the brainstorming. In addition, BIG KARL allows emission angle reconstruction via track measurements in its focal plane with high resolution. In the following the physics highlights, the proposed and potential experiments are summarized. During the meeting it became obvious that the physics to be explored at Big Karl can be grouped into five distinct categories, and this summary is organized accordingly.

In this case Karl Marx paid special attention to the working and living conditions of the working class and an analysis of his adequate statements and records shows multifarious details which give a research basis also for the history of medicine. Marx and Engels had friendly contacts with several physicians who shared the opinions of the two classics: their way of life is shown in the most important points.\n\nKarl Lagerfeld obidelsja\n\nIndex Scriptorium Estoniae\n\n2006-01-01\n\nMoekunstnik Karl Lagerfeld kaebas kohtusse raamatu \"The Beautiful Fall : Fashion, Genius and Glorious Excess in 1970s Paris\" autori Alicia Drake'i.

This is partly due to the different proprietary information models and inconsistent data quality. Our objective was to provide a more flexible solution enabling the clinicians to define which data to be recorded and shared for both routine documentation and clinical studies. The data should be possible to reuse through a common set of variable definitions providing a consistent nomenclature and validation of data. Another objective was that the templates used for the data entry and presentation should be possible to use in combination with the existing EHR systems. Methods We have designed and developed a template based system (called Julius that was integrated with existing EHR systems. The system is driven by the medical domain knowledge defined by clinicians in the form of templates and variable definitions stored in a common data repository. The system architecture consists of three layers. The presentation layer is purely web-based, which facilitates integration with existing EHR products. The domain layer consists of the template design system, a variable/clinical concept definition system, the transformation and validation logic all implemented in Java. The data source layer utilizes an object relational mapping tool and a relational database. Results The Julius system has been implemented, tested and deployed to three health care units in Stockholm, Sweden. The initial responses from the pilot users were positive.

In a previous contribution, we attracted attention on the positive part (his truth and falsehood predicates being excluded of his âpure logicâ: his âisologyâ being assimilated to mutual implication, it constitutes a genuine formalization of positive intuitionistic logic. KÃ¶nigâs intention was to rebuild logic in such a way that the excluded thirdâs principle could no longer be logical. However, his treatment of truth and falsehood (boiling down to negation is purely classical. We explain here this discrepancy by the choice of the alleged more primitive notions to which the questioned notions of truth and falsehood have been reduced. Finaly, it turns out that the disjunctive and conjunctive forms of the principles of the excluded third and of contradiction have effectively been excluded, but none of their implicative forms.\n\nMozart, Karl Barth, og den kristne troslÃ¦ren\n\nDEFF Research Database (Denmark)\n\nPetersen, Nils Holger\n\n2010-01-01\n\nEn diskussion af Karl Barths teologiske brug af W.A.Mozart i den kirchliche Dogmatik med kontekstuel inddragelse af en til en vis grad tilsvarende overordnet diskussion af Mozart, skrevet af en samtidig musiker, den fremtrÃ¦dende Mozart-dirigent Ferenc Fricsay.Â ......En diskussion af Karl Barths teologiske brug af W.A.Mozart i den kirchliche Dogmatik med kontekstuel inddragelse af en til en vis grad tilsvarende overordnet diskussion af Mozart, skrevet af en samtidig musiker, den fremtrÃ¦dende Mozart-dirigent Ferenc Fricsay.Â ...\n\nKarl Marx and the Environment\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nShifferd, K.

F.\n\n2012-12-01\n\nThe events leading up to the genesis of Tropical Cyclone (TC) Karl (2010) provides a unique opportunity to examine the continuing problem of understanding tropical cyclogenesis. The PRE-Depression Investigation of Cloud-systems in the Tropics (PREDICT) field campaign allowed for detailed investigation of the tropical disturbance that served as the precursor to TC Karl as it progressed westward through the Caribbean Sea. The purpose of this presentation is to examine the evolution of the pre-Karl disturbance using both common synoptic-scale analyses as well as statistically-based equatorial wave analyses, focusing on where these analyses complement and enhance each other. One of the major factors in the initial spin-up of the pre-Karl tropical disturbance is a surge of southerly and westerly winds from northern South America on 8-10 September 2010. As the surge entered the Caribbean on 9 September, it aided in the formation of a nearly closed earth-relative cyclonic circulation near the southern Leeward Islands. This circulation weakened late on 10 September and remained weak through 13 September before increased organization led to TC genesis on 14 September. This southerly wind surge can be traced to a well-defined surge of anomalously cold air and enhanced southerly winds originating in the lee of the Argentinian Andes over a week prior. While the temperature anomalies wash out prior to reaching the equator, anomalous low-level winds progress into Colombia and Venezuela, where topography aids in turning the southerly winds eastward. An investigation of the pre-Karl environment utilizing wavenumber-frequency filtering techniques also suggests that the initial spin-up of pre-Karl can be associated with the active phase of a convectively coupled Kelvin wave (CCKW). The observed formation of the nearly closed cyclonic circulation on 10 September is well timed with the passage of anomalous westerly winds along and behind the convectively active phase of a CCKW.

Die Kunstliteratur of 1924 became his fifth and final such handbook, and was published with the intention to elucidate the pre-history of the history of art as an academic discipline. It is natural that Giorgio Vasari has a place at the core of such a story. However, Schlosser possessed an unrivalled knowledge of the relevant written and theoretical sources, and his unusually consistent approach found Lorenzo Ghiberti to be the actual founder of the subject and Winckelmann to have finally overcome the relatively pernicious influence of Vasari. This chapter from the centre of his book therefore still today remains the best critical account of Vasariâs writings from a broader point of view.\n\nKarl A.

After attending a lower secondary school in Cieszyn, he began studies in classical languages (Greek and Latin at universities in Vienna and Jena, then he worked as a teacher in lower secondary schools in Lewocza, Cieszyn, and Bielsko. The research he undertook included botanical studies, measurements of absolute elevation, and meteorological observations in the Western Beskids as well as in the Tatra Mountains. The results of the studies were printed in German, Austrian, Polish, and Hungarian publications. He found species of plants not known earlier to exist in the area of Cieszyn and Bielsko. The measurements of elevations he made of characteristic points of landscape (more than 500 were used for cartographic purposes. From 1866 on, he was a member of Physiographic Commission of KrakÃ³w Scientific Society, and later of the Academy of Arts and Sciences, which financially supported his field work. Karl Kolbenheyer was one of the founders of the Beskidenverein â a German tourist organisation â and managed its branch in Bielsko. He prepared two tourist guides: the guide to Tatra Mountains â Die hohe Tatra (ten editions, and to the Beskids â FÃ¼hrer durch die Beskidenâ¦ (two editions.

Syamsul Huda\n\n2014-01-01\n\nFull Text Available Karl Popper once criticizes the positivistic paradigm by means of what he calls the theory of falsification. To him, the positivistic paradigm constitutes a failure simply because it cannot distinguish between science and prude science, that is, between empirical method and non-empirical method. In the scientific knowledge, empirical science, mathematics and logic must be differentiated, something that the positivistic paradigm has failed to do. This paradigm furthermore, did not have a clear picture what logic-based science is, empirical knowledge and psychology of knowledge. It also fails to properly understand knowledge that springs from tradition, emotion, authority and so forth. All positivistic paradigms such as that of Karl Maxâs Historicism, Freudâs theory of Psycho Analysis, Adlerâs theory of Individual Analysis and Newtonâs theory of Gravitation fall into this trap of failure.\n\nKarl Schwarzschild and the professionalization of astrophysics.

He investigated the brains in the summer of 1942; however, their traces were subsequently lost. The present study shows, that the Series H, which was part of the Hallervorden collection of brain sections in the Max Planck Institute for Brain Research, comprises the brain sections of the above mentioned five hundred euthanasia victims. The provenance of 105 patients could be reconstructed and 84 are for sure euthanasia victims. Most of them were killed in Bernburg or in Sonnenstein-Pirna.

One of the problems of this traditional conception is that it dissociates his theoretical and economic contributions from the historical development of the authorâs thought (and also from its material roots.

One of his prominent discoveries is the hippocampus. At that time, Arantius originated the term hippocampus, from the Greek word for seahorse (hippos [\"horse\"] and kampos [\"sea monster\"]). Arantius published his description of the hippocampus in 1587, in the first chapter of his work titled De Humano Foetu Liber. Numerous nomenclatures of this structure, including \"white silkworm,\" \"Ammon's horn,\" and \"ram's horn\" were proposed by different scholars at that time. However, the term hippocampus has become the most widely used in the literature.\n\nDetermination of the water content in tetra-ammonium uranyl tricarbonate by the Karl Fischer reagent method\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nSisti, C.; Grigoletto, T.\n\n1990-08-01\n\nTwo methods are compared for the determination of water content in tetra-ammonium uranyl tricarbonate by the Karl Fischer reagent method. In the first method it is Known that the carbonate reacts stoichiometrically with the iodine content of the Karl Fischer reagent in the same way it reacts with the water (mole of apparent H 2 O per mole of carbonate is produced). In this case, the carbonate content in the sample is determined and a suitable correction is applied to take into account the apparent water results. In the second method it is performed an extraction of the moisture by adding methanol to the sample in an independent flask. After the decantation, an aliquot of the clear supernatant methanol is taken for the determination of water content by the Karl Fischer reagent method.

S.; Brinckerhoff, W. B.; Clegg, S. M.; Mahaffy, P. R.; Swindle, T. D.; Wiens, R. C.\n\n2012-01-01\n\nAbsolute dating of planetary samples is an essential tool to establish the chronology of geological events, including crystallization history, magmatic evolution, and alteration. Traditionally, geochronology has only been accomplishable on samples from dedicated sample return missions or meteorites. The capability for in situ geochronology is highly desired, because it will allow one-way planetary missions to perform dating of large numbers of samples. The success of an in situ geochronology package will not only yield data on absolute ages, but can also complement sample return missions by identifying the most interesting rocks to cache and/or return to Earth. In situ dating instruments have been proposed, but none have yet reached TRL 6 because the required high-resolution isotopic measurements are very challenging. Our team is now addressing this challenge by developing the Potassium (K) - Argon Laser Experiment (KArLE) under the NASA Planetary Instrument Definition and Development Program (PIDDP), building on previous work to develop a K-Ar in situ instrument [1]. KArLE uses a combination of several flight-proven components that enable accurate K-Ar isochron dating of planetary rocks. KArLE will ablate a rock sample, determine the K in the plasma state using laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS), measure the liberated Ar using quadrupole mass spectrometry (QMS), and relate the two by the volume of the ablated pit using an optical method such as a vertical scanning interferometer (VSI). Our preliminary work indicates that the KArLE instrument will be capable of determining the age of several kinds of planetary samples to +/-100 Myr, sufficient to address a wide range of geochronology problems in planetary science.\n\nTÃ¤napÃ¤eva tantsuteatri mitu palet / Heili Einasto, Karl Toepfer\n\nIndex Scriptorium Estoniae\n\nEinasto, Heili\n\n2015-01-01\n\nVestlus San Jose Ã¼likooli professori Karl Toepferiga nÃ¼Ã¼disaegsest Eesti tantsuteatrist - I.

In 1925, Heisenberg modified Bohr's quantum rule; in 1927 he formulated the uncertainty principle which puts some restrictions on the simultaneous determination of the position and momentum. In 1928, Heisenberg set up the quantum theory of ferromagnetism, which still underlies all theories of magnetic properties of substances. Soon after Chadwick's discovery of the neutron (1932), Heisenberg introduced the concept of the isospin - he interpreted the proton and the neutron as one particle (nucleon) in two charge states. Heisenberg's professional and pedagogical activities during and after the 2nd world war are also described.

Karl Kraus and the War. Between 1915 and the end of the war, Karl Kraus, an Austrian intellectual who had made political satire and criticism of journalistic language, engages in a fierce battle against the inhumanity and cruelty of war. On the pages of Fackel, a magazine published by him for over thirty years, from 1899 to 1936, he gathers many texts that then come together in the tragedy of the Last Days of Mankind, a great work, dripping horror, which seeks to represent the unrepresentable.\n\nBasic versus applied research: Julius Sachs (1832-1897) and the experimental physiology of plants.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nKutschera, Ulrich\n\n2015-01-01\n\nThe German biologist Julius Sachs was the first to introduce controlled, accurate, quantitative experimentation into the botanical sciences, and is regarded as the founder of modern plant physiology. His seminal monograph Experimental-Physiologie der Pflanzen (Experimental Physiology of Plants) was published 150Â y ago (1865), when Sachs was employed as a lecturer at the Agricultural Academy in Poppelsdorf/Bonn (now part of the University). This book marks the beginning of a new era of basic and applied plant science. In this contribution, I summarize the achievements of Sachs and outline his lasting legacy. In addition, I show that Sachs was one of the first biologists who integrated bacteria, which he considered to be descendants of fungi, into the botanical sciences and discussed their interaction with land plants (degradation of wood etc.). This \"plant-microbe-view\" of green organisms was extended and elaborated by the laboratory botanist Wilhelm Pfeffer (1845-1920), so that the term \"Sachs-Pfeffer-Principle of Experimental Plant Research\" appears to be appropriate to characterize this novel way of performing scientific studies on green, photoautotrophic organisms (embryophytes, algae, cyanobacteria).\n\nDictator Perpetuus: Julius Caesar--did he have seizures? If so, what was the etiology?\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nHughes, John R\n\n2004-10-01\n\nThe \"Dictator Perpetuus\" of the Roman Empire, the great Julius Caesar, was not the one for whom the well-known cesarean operation was named; instead, this term is derived from a Latin word meaning \"to cut.\" Caesar likely had epilepsy on the basis of four attacks that were probably complex partial seizures: (1) while listening to an oration by Cicero, (2) in the Senate while being offered the Emperor's Crown, and in military campaigns, (3) near Thapsus (North Africa) and (4) Corduba (Spain). Also, it is possible that he had absence attacks as a child and as a teenager. His son, Caesarion, by Queen Cleopatra, likely had seizures as a child, but the evidence is only suggestive. His great-great-great grandnephews Caligula and Britannicus also had seizures. The etiology of these seizures in this Julio-Claudian family was most likely through inheritance, with the possibility of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) in his great grandfather and also his father. Our best evidence comes from the ancient sources of Suetonius, Plutarch, Pliny, and Appianus.\n\nFrom Julius Caesar to Sustainable Composite Materials: A Passage through Port Caisson Technology\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nEduardo Cejuela\n\n2018-04-01\n\nFull Text Available The breakwater construction technique using floating concrete caissons is well-known nowadays as a widespread system. Yet do we really know its origin? Since Julius Caesar used this technology in Brindisi (Italy up to the Normandy landings in June 1944, not only has this technology been developed, but it has been a key item in several moments in history. Its development has almost always been driven by military requirements. The greatest changes have not been conceptual but point occurring, backed by the materials used. Parallelisms can be clearly seen in each new stage: timber, opus caementitium (Roman concrete, iron and concreteâ¦ However, nowadays, achieving a more sustainable world constitutes a major challenge, to which the construction of caissons breakwaters must contribute as a field of application of new eco-friendly materials. This research work provides a general overview from the origins of caissons until our time. It will make better known the changes that took place in the system and their adaptation to new materials, and will help in clarifying the future in developing technology towards composite sustainable materials and special concrete. If we understand the past, it will be easier to define the future.\n\nAlles Leben ist ProblemlÃ¶sen: Zum 100.

The research capitalizes on the unique opportunity provided by GRIP to synthesize multiple datasets from two aircraft and analyze the microphysical and kinematic properties of an electrified TC. Five coordinated flight legs through Karl by the DC-8 and GH are investigated, focusing on the inner-core region (within 50km of the storm center) where the lightning was concentrated and the aircraft were well coordinated. GRIP datasets are used to compare properties of electrified and nonelectrified inner-core regions that are related to the noninductive charging mechanism, which is widely accepted to explain the observed electric fields within thunderstorms. Three common characteristics of Karl's electrified regions are identified: 1) strong updrafts of 10-20ms21, 2) deep mixed-phase layers indicated by reflectivities.30 dBZ extending several kilometers above the freezing level, and 3) microphysical environments consisting of graupel, very small ice particles, and the inferred presence of supercooled water. These characteristics describe an environment favorable for in situ noninductive charging and, hence, TC electrification. The electrified regions in Karl's inner core are attributable to a microphysical environment that was conducive to electrification because of occasional, strong convective updrafts in the eyewall.\n\nMillisele Ãµpetajale kingiksite imerohu? / Karl Martin SinijÃ¤rv, Vahur Keller, Kaarel Tarand ...

The objective of Freud's studies were different, and based in irrefutable evidence, Karl KÃ¶ller was the real inventor of local anesthesia. In face of those facts, proper knowledge of this historically important subject is due. This report refers to the long-known properties of cocaine. It also remembers personal data, and the professional and scientific activities of Sigmund Freud and Karl KÃ¶ller. It presents Freud's researches on the pathophysiological effects of cocaine. It exposes the reasons for the harsh criticism of Freud's concepts. It describes the sudden, but conscious and justified, idea of Karl KÃ¶ller to study scientifically the use of cocaine as a local anesthetic in animals and humans. It indicates how those pioneering studies, that culminated with the discovery of local anesthesia by KÃ¶ller and two presentations in Vienna on the subject, were done. It also reports the first ophthalmologic surgery under local anesthesia. It shows the immediate dissemination throughout the world of the discovery that marked the beginning of regional blocks. It comments several documents corroborating the role of KÃ¶ller in this discovery. And, finally, it mentions the numerous homages received by KÃ¶ller in different areas of the world. COCLUSIONS: Regional block was introduced by Karl KÃ¶ller in 1884, when he demonstrated the feasibility of performing painless ophthalmologic surgeries by using cocaine as a local anesthetic. Sigmund Freud studied cocaine extensively, but he did not have direct participation in this important discovery.\n\nKarl Menningu (ja iseenese) pÃ¤Ã¤stmiseks / Ants Hein\n\nIndex Scriptorium Estoniae\n\nHein, Ants, 1952-\n\n2008-01-01\n\nVastuseks Karin Hallas-Murula arvustusele \"Maja, mis on sÃ¼mbol\" (Sirp, 2007, 5.

Laser-Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy (LIBS) is used to measure the K abun-dance in a sample and to release its noble gases; the evolved Ar is measured by mass spectrometry (MS); and rela-tive K content is related to absolute Ar abundance by sample mass, determined by optical measurement of the ablated volume. KArLE measures a whole-rock K-Ar age to 10% or better for rocks 2 Ga or older, sufficient to resolve the absolute age of many planetary samples. The LIBS-MS approach is attractive because the analytical components have been flight proven, do not require further technical development, and provide complementary measurements as well as in situ geochronology.\n\nO marxismo antidogmÃ¡tico de Karl Korsch\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nNildo Viana\n\n2013-06-01\n\nFull Text Available O presente artigo tematiza o marxismo de Karl Korsch, focalizando seu carÃ¡ter nÃ£o dogmÃ¡tico.

Abstract: This article thematizes Marxism of Karl Korsch, focusing on its non dogmatic. From a rescue of criticality and revolutionary Marxism of Marx, Korsch performs a radical critique of revisionism and Leninism. To do so, he not only rescues the true character of Marxist dialectics and materialist conception of history, as this concept requires consistency in defending the principle of applying it to herself. So he lays the foundations of a non-dogmatic Marxism, to which is the bond with the proletariat that shows the character of Marxism and not petrified ideologies. Key words: Marxism, dogmatism, criticism, historical materialism, dialectical.\n\nEl racionalismo crÃ­tico de Karl Popper\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nLuis MarÃ­a Delio Machado\n\n2015-10-01\n\nFull Text Available El presente artÃ­culo, pretende acercar algunos de los aspectos mÃ¡s importantes del pensamiento de uno de los filÃ³sofos mÃ¡s destacados de nuestro tiempo: Sir Karl Popper. Su presencia atraviesa nuestro siglo, presentÃ¡ndose como una de las voces visionarias y anticipadoras que se alzaron crÃ­ticamente, contra toda actitud o acciÃ³n que estuviese fundada en lo dogmÃ¡tico y que tuviese como finalidad, el olvido o la superaciÃ³n del individuo, aunque dicho olvido estuviese \"justificado\" por oraculares \"bienes o fines superiores\".

The author contends that population growth is a critical factor in Marx's theory of the progressive impoverishment of the working class. However, because of his reluctance to acknowledge the value of the Malthusian contribution, Marx focused his analysis of the labor force under capitalism on the demand for workers and neglected the supply side, which is determined by the growth of population. The author concludes that Marxist theory would have benefited from greater consideration of Malthusian theory.\n\nThe psychology of thinking, animal psychology, and the young Karl Popper.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nTer Hark, Michel\n\n2004-01-01\n\nIn the 1920s, Karl Popper wrote two large manuscripts on psychology that he never published. In his autobiography, Unended Quest, he attempts to reduce the importance of his work in psychology as much as possible, and in his philosophical work he is an antipsychologist. However, in this article, it is argued that Popper's early psychology has been pivotally important for the development of his philosophy. In particular, it is shown that Popper's views on psychology underwent a radical shift, one that paved the way for his characteristic deductive stance in philosophy. Popper's views shifted from an inductive and associationistic psychology toward a noninductive psychology of problem solving. Tracing the historical background of Popper's early work reveals how he integrated various parts of the psychology of Karl Groos into his analysis of the childish phenomenon of dogmatic thinking and how he shortly after appropriated various elements of the animal psychology of Hans Volkelt and Herbert Jennings in his biological approach to (dogmatic) thinking. In the monumental works of Otto Selz, however, Popper finally found the roots of a noninductive and biological approach to the growth of individual and scientific knowledge.

As was often the case, Popper initially formulated his position by criticizing the views of others - in this case Niels Bohr and Werner Heisenberg. Underlying Popper's criticism was his belief that, first, the \"standard interpretation\" of quantum mechanics, sometimes called the Copenhagen interpretation, abandoned scientific realism and second, the assertion that quantum theory was \"complete\" (an assertion rejected by Einstein among others) amounted to an unfalsifiable claim. Popper insisted that the most basic predictions of quantum mechanics should continue to be tested, with an eye towards falsification rather than mere adding of decimal places to confirmatory experiments. His persistent attacks on the Copenhagen interpretation were aimed not at the uncertainty principle itself and the formalism from which it was derived, but at the acceptance by physicists of an unclear epistemology and ontology that left critical questions unanswered. In 1999, physicists at the University of Maryland conducted a version of Popper's Experiment, re-igniting the debate over quantum predictions and the role of locality in physics.\n\nUSA presidendi Ã¼ks peamisi nÃµunikke Karl Rove lahkub ametist / Kaivo Kopli\n\nIndex Scriptorium Estoniae\n\nKopli, Kaivo\n\n2007-01-01\n\n1993. aastast praeguse USA presidendi George B.

His faith in science grew out of a deeply moral quest, reflected also in his socialism and his efforts to find a new basis for relations between men and women. This biography recounts Pearson's extraordinary intellectual adventure and sheds new light on the inner life of science.

Most recently his views about non-existence of a single method for doing science have been employed to rethink science education and propose the use of multiple methods for effective teaching-learning process. This article employs the theoretical framework of the author expressed in the book Against Method, 1977, about the epistemological anarchism and the methodological pluralism and uses it in the contemporary discussion of medical education.\n\nTim, Jan Lucas ja Karl Robert - vennad Ã¼heks kuuks / Maris Laurits\n\nIndex Scriptorium Estoniae\n\nLaurits, Maris\n\n2009-01-01\n\nRakvere Teatri suvelavastuse \"Vennad LÃµvisÃ¼damed\" kaks Karli osatÃ¤itjat Jan Lucas Videvik ja Tim Leesnurm ning Joonatani osatÃ¤itja Karl Robert SaaremÃ¤e tegid Loksal Kaldmaa talus ratsasÃµiduproove.
