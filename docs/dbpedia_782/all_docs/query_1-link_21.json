Throughout the book I use the term “nonhuman animal” instead of “animal,” in order to complicate the human/animal binary (as humans are, of course, animals). Likewise, I refrain from referring to nonhuman animals as “it.”\n\n2. Citati 1990: 59–60.\n\n3. Benjamin 1969: 132.\n\n4. Adorno 1981: 252.\n\n5. Seyppel 1956: 69.\n\n6.

Adorno 1981: 246.\n\n28. Brod distinguishes here between allegory, in which the literal level is insignificant, and symbol, whose literal level also stands for itself. See Brod 1975: 193.\n\n29.

Scientific evidences for nonhuman consciousness include striking physiologic, neuroanatomic, and behavioral similarity to humans, as well as evolutionary continuity. See, for example, Dawkins 2008 and DeGrazia 1996.\n\n43. Boggs 2013: 20; Lippit 2010: 165–66; Nelles 2001: 188.\n\n44. Inability to tell one’s story is not restricted to nonhumans. For example, Kari Weil draws a parallel between animal studies and trauma studies, since “both raise questions about how one can give testimony to an experience that cannot be spoken or that may be distorted by speaking about it.” See Weil 2012: 6.\n\n45. Beer 2005: 313.\n\n46. Forster 1985: 43–44.\n\n47. Wolfe 2009: 567–68.\n\n48. Lorenz 1952: 148.\n\n49. Carol Adams defines “absent referent” as anyone whose original meaning is undercut as it is absorbed into a different hierarchy of meaning. She particularly reflects on nonhuman animals as absent referents, inasmuch as their existence is commonly transmuted into a metaphor for human existence. See Adams 2011: 42.\n\n50. Regan and Linzey 2010: xviii.\n\n51. Richards 1976: 201. Richards uses here “personification,” which in literary studies is perceived as equivalent to “anthropomorphism.” “Personification,” however, implies that nonhuman animals are not persons, an implication strongly rejected by many animal studies scholars. See, for example, Francione 2009.\n\n52. Cadman 2016; Hogan 2009: 3–5.\n\n53. Fudge 2004: 76–77.\n\n54. Aesop 1998: 47.\n\n55. Douglass 1995: xv.\n\nPage 167 →56. Kant 1987: 314.\n\n57.

Bouson 1990; Caldwell 1987: 48; Eggenschwiler 1986; Geller 2018: 62–64; Gilman 2006: 85–87; Kaiser 1972; Pfeiffer 1962: 58; Rowe 2002; Sokel 2002: 217–25; Tiefenbrun 1973.\n\n2. Todorov 1975: 172. This concept fits not only “The Metamorphosis” but also Kafka’s poetics as a whole, and it is examined at more length in the introductory section.\n\n3. Kluge and Seebold 1999: 848.\n\n4. Agamben 1998: 71–73.\n\n5. Agamben 2004: 23; Heidegger 1995: 196. This lacuna in Agamben’s work is at the heart of Derrida’s The Beast and the Sovereign. See Derrida 2009: 305–34.\n\n6. Before modern times, nonhuman animals were not only ritually sacrificed but also considered as bearing legal responsibility and as such could be prosecuted. See Oldridge 2005: 40–55.\n\n7. Baudrillard 1994: 133–35.\n\n8. Heidegger 2009: 74.\n\n9. Arendt 1994: 69.\n\n10. The different ways men and women approach nonhuman animals are also depicted in Kafka’s short story “The Animal in the Synagogue”: “It is only the women who are afraid of the animal, the men have long ceased to bother about it. . . . Their excuse is that the animal is usually much nearer to them than to the men, and this is Page 168 →true. The animal does not dare to go down below where the men are, it has never yet been seen on the floor” (PP, 51, 53). In fact, this description also fits Gregor, who does not dare to show himself to his father, but only to his mother and sister. The notion that patriarchy and anthroparchy are interconnected is central to ecofeminist thought. For intersectional perspective of feminist animal studies see Adams and Donovan 1995; Adams and Guren 2014; and Birke 2002.\n\n11. Foucault 1990: 135, 139–40.\n\n12. Schiller 1972: 82.\n\n13. Wolfe 2013; Braverman 2016.\n\n14. Gray 1973: 89; Pascal 1982: 44–45.\n\n15. In his literary-entomological account of Kafka’s “The Metamorphosis” Nabokov calculates that Gregor must be dog-sized. See Nabokov 1982: 259.\n\n16. Boggs 2013: 21; Perkins 2003: 13; Ritvo 1987; Tester 1991; Thomas 1983; Turner 1980.\n\n17. Tsovel 2004: 338–39.\n\n18. Clark 1991: 24–25; Thomas 1983: 92–99. Interestingly, Thomas More describes a similar scenario in his 1516 work Utopia. In his utopian society, slaughtering is done by slaves only, as citizens are not allowed to do such work. “The Utopians feel,” says More, “that slaughtering our fellow creatures gradually destroys the sense of compassion, the finest sentiment of which our human nature is capable.” See More 2016: 58.\n\n19. Elias 1994: 95–99. See also Timothy Pachirat’s discussion in Elias’s in his account of industrialized killing from a participant’s point of view: Pachirat 2011: 9–10.\n\n20. Elias 1994: 121.\n\n21. Dawkins 1998: 152.\n\n22. Freud 2001: 147.\n\n23. Fudge 2004: 70–74.\n\n24. Dell’Aversano 2010: 82. See also Cole and Stewart 2014, who focus on the cultural construction of human-animal relations in childhood.\n\n25. Dell’Aversano 2010: 83.\n\n26. Donelson and Nilsen 1997: 117.\n\n27. McAndrew 1969: 387; Pedot 2005: 417; Rolleston 1974: 61; Thiher 1990: 44.\n\n28. Koelb 2010: 117.\n\n29. Carmen Dell’Aversano defines humanormativity as a term analogous to heteronormativity: “Just as heteronormativity grotesquely maintains that any member of the ‘opposite sex’ is more appropriate, suitable and attractive as a sexual partner than any member of one’s own, humanormativity maintains that all members of one species (Homo sapiens) have more in common with one another than any of them can have with any member of any other species.” See Dell’Aversano 2010: 76. Lori Guren sees “humanormativity” as a parallel term to “speciesism.” See Guren 2013: 223. The term “speciesism” was coined by the psychologist and animal rights advocate Richard Ryder in the 1970s and subsequently popularized by the philosopher Peter Singer. Analogous to racism and sexism, speciesism is defined as discrimination and/or prejudice based on species. See Cavalieri 2001: 69–85.\n\n30. The fact that this is a metamorphosis story is given in most English versions of the story even before the opening sentence—already in the story’s title, “The Metamorphosis.”Page 169 → This, however, is not unequivocally given in the original German title, Die Verwandlung. See n. 69 on p. 64.\n\n31. Giaccherini 2005: 62; Gildenhard and Zissos 2013: 347. The story of Io’s transformation into a heifer is one of the few exceptions to this Ovidian pattern, as Io’s story does not conclude with the transformation but follows her post-metamorphosis life and ends when she regains her human form.\n\n32. Certainly, not all metamorphosis narratives focus on cross-species metamorphosis. For example, in Ovid’s Metamorphoses the blind prophet Tiresias is transformed into a woman, Daphne is turned into a laurel tree, Atlas becomes a mountain, and Medusa’s gaze turns those who see her to stone. Nevertheless, it seems that the most common type of metamorphosis tale is from a human into a nonhuman animal.\n\n33. Ovid 2000: 195.\n\n34. Hogan 2009: 192.\n\n35. Greve 2011: 44–45. Etiological tales typically conclude with the metamorphic event, and therefore the effect of the metamorphosis on the person’s mind—whether the mind has been also transformed or not—is not specified.\n\n36. Homer 1991: 142.\n\n37. Apuleius 1994: 54.\n\n38. Marx 1971: 20.\n\n39. Gildenhard and Zissos 2013: 346.\n\n40. Bermejo-Rubio 2013: 280; Nabokov 1982: 258; Schubiger 1969: 55–57; Sweeney 2013: 96.\n\n41. Deleuze and Guattari 2000: 96–97.\n\n42. Horkheimer and Adorno 2002: 205–6.\n\n43.

Mill 2002: 10.\n\n50. Plutarch 1927: 499. A better-known version of Plutarch’s idea can be found in Jean de La Fontaine’s fable “The Companions of Ulysses to the Lord Duke of Burgundy.” In this fable Odysseus asks his friends if they would like to return to their human state, but all prefer their nonhuman lifeforms: “Ulysses persevered; but one and all / Gave the same answer, great or small. / Freedom, the forest, passion uncontrolled—/ These were the only goods they craved: / The meeds of fame and honour left them cold: / They followed Lust, and called it Liberty: / To their own selves they were enslaved.” See La Fontaine 1952: 284. It is interesting to note that whereas Plutarch’s version undermines the anthropocentric view, La Fontaine reinforces it, as the narrator in his fable condemns the choice of Odysseus’s friends.\n\n51. Nabokov 1982: 280–81; Natarajan 1993: 121; Tiefenbrun 1973: 115.\n\n52. Booth 2002: 281.\n\nPage 170 →53. Sokel 2002: 34.\n\n54. Gregor is classified as a cockroach in Ben-Ephraim 1994: 457; Booth 2002: 281; Deleuze and Guattari 1986: 13; Fast 1981: 12; Geier 2016: 41; Leavitt 2012: 141; Luke 1964: 28; Massumi 2014: 56; and Thiher 1990: 41. He is identified as a beetle in Caldwell 1987: 47; Emrich 1984: 136; McAndrew 1969: 386; Taylor 1965: 238; Thorlby 1972: 34; and Weninger 1993: 271. The hypothesis that Gregor is a dung beetle appears in Leadbeater 1986: 169; Ryan 2001: 81; and Swinford 2010: 215.\n\n55. Nabokov 1982: 259–60.\n\n56. In his extensive study of translations of Kafka, Patrick O’Neill compares twelve English translations of “The Metamorphosis,” many of which inaccurately translate Ungeziefer, the German word chosen by Kafka, as “insect” or “bug,” which—unlike “vermin”—are biological categories. See O’Neill 2014: 60.\n\n57. Stanley Corngold and Benno Wagner add to this list also “Jews in the Third Reich, mountain lions in Colorado, and wild boars in contemporary Berlin—all have had the distinction of being defined as vermin: are judged to be non-beings, outside the pale of the law, as good as dead.” See Corngold and Wagner 2011: 57–58.\n\n58. Borges 1964: 103.\n\n59. Foucault 2002: xvi.\n\n60. Foucault 1990: 143.\n\n61. Derrida 2008: 34.\n\n62. Derrida 2008: 48.\n\n63. Patrick O’Neill also examines the translations of the German epithet ungeheuer in “The Metamorphosis,” which in many English versions loses its full denotation, as it is translated as “enormous” or “gigantic” instead of “monstrous.” See O’Neill 2014: 60.\n\n64. Weinberg 1963: 316–17.\n\n65. Foucault 2003: 56.\n\n66. “Wir müssen es loszuwerden suchen . . . es bringt euch noch beide um . . . Weg muß es” (E, 153).\n\n67. Corngold and Wagner 2010: 71.\n\n68. Canetti 1988: 81.\n\n69. Freer 2015: 97; Koelb 2010: 117; O’Neill 2014: 141–42.\n\n70. Dell’Aversano 2010: 80.\n\n71. de Beauvoir 2011: 283.\n\n72. Sartre 2004: l.\n\nChapter 2\n\n1.

One exception to this principle is Kafka’s early story “Description of a Struggle” Page 171 →(“Beschreibung eines Kampfes”), which takes place in Prague and contains many references to sites in the city.\n\n4. Roberts 1982: 5.\n\n5. Hagenbeck is known first and foremost as an animal trader, but his shows not only displayed nonhuman animals, but also African people, whose “exoticism” enthralled the German audience. See Schilling 2014: 46, and Malamud 2017: 402–3.\n\n6. Rothfels 2002: 99.\n\n7. Bostock 1993: 30–31; Chrulew 2010: 200–202; Mullan and Marvin 1998: 50–51; Rothfels 2002: 162.\n\n8.

See my discussion of Norbert Elias’s critique in the previous chapter.\n\n15. Malamud 2017: 405.\n\n16. Humans were so named because they are the only hominids whose body is not covered in hair. See Morris 1984.\n\n17. Nietzsche 2008: 210. In his book about animals in the fiction of modernity Philip Armstrong suggests that Red Peter’s remark on nudity echoes the Houyhnhnms’ mystification over Gulliver’s determination to hide his body from sight. See Armstrong 2008: 203.\n\n18. Derrida 2008: 4.\n\n19. A similar insight can be found in Albert Camus’s 1951 philosophical essay The Rebel, where he states that “man is the only creature that refuses to be what he is.” See Camus 1992: 11.\n\n20. The status of this text is somewhat ambiguous: is Coetzee voicing his own views through Costello? The text deliberately blurs the boundary between reality and fiction, particularly since Coetzee, a South African author, originally read this text, about an Australian writer invited to give a lecture at an American university, at an American university. Moreover, in her lecture, Costello refers to an article written by Coetzee on Kafka’s “The Burrow” (see Coetzee 1981) as her own.\n\n21. Coetzee 2001: 27–29.\n\n22. Köhler 1957: 226.\n\n23. Hobbes 1996: 89.\n\n24. Derrida’s The Beast and the Sovereign is particularly focused on this theme.\n\n25. At the turn of the third millennium a few countries recognized great apes as legal persons (persona iuris), providing them minimal legal protection. See Fitzgerald 2015.\n\n26. Adorno 1974: 105.\n\n27. Agamben 2004: 37.\n\n28. Russell 1997: 33–35. Interestingly, Russell also turns to nonhuman animals when analyzing the conception of power: “These forms of power are most nakedly and simply displayed in our dealings with animals, where disguises and pretences are Page 172 →not thought necessary. When a pig with a rope round its middle is hoisted squealing into a ship, it is subject to direct physical power over its body. . . . The case of the pig illustrates military and police power.” See Russell 2004: 24.\n\n29. Asker 2001: 58; Kilcher and Detlef 2004: 63; Norris 1985: 66; Sokel 2002: 284; Stuart 1969: 414–15.\n\n30.

In fact, Agamben’s portrayal of the werewolf may also apply to the ape: “a threshold of indistinction and of passage between animal and man, physis and nomos, exclusion and inclusion . . . who is precisely neither man nor beast, and who dwells paradoxically within both while belonging to neither.” See Agamben 1998: 63.\n\n40.

Critchley also remarks that unlike this pleasingly benign effect when nonhuman animals are humanized, “when the human becomes animal the effect is disgusting and if we laugh at all then it is what Beckett calls ‘the mirthless laugh,’ which laughs at that which is unhappy.”\n\n57.

The nonverbal sailors can be compared to Kafka’s other animalized human figures, such as the nomads in “A Page from an Old Document” and in “Building the Great Wall of China,” which will be presented in the next chapter, as well as the groom in “A Country Doctor,” introduced in the fifth chapter.\n\n62. Deleuze and Guattari 1986: 14.\n\n63. In “The Metamorphosis” Gregor’s transformation to vermin is also not the only metamorphic event in the story; it is accompanied, as suggested in the previous chapter, with Grete’s metamorphosis. However, Grete’s metamorphosis is not an cross-species one, and hence species transition there is not bidirectional.\n\n64.

Like Kafka’s other animal stories, “Jackals and Arabs” has garnered numerous parabolic interpretations. Alongside the Jewish readings, the conflict between jackals and Arabs has been also construed as a parable for numerous other interhuman issues, including the dialecticalPage 174 → construction of human existence, the struggle of human beings against the laws of nature, and the tension between matter and spirit. See, for example, Eschweiler 1991: 87; Neider 1962: 81; Schwarz 1986: 83; Tauber 1948: 69.\n\n2. Bruce 2007: 154–55; Fischer 1996: 353; Rubinstein 1967: 15. Sander Gilman, however, points out a reversal in the story, since the jackals/Jews eat only the flesh of animals (including nonkosher animals, like camels) that died of natural causes, against Jewish practice.

The original title of this story was actually “A Page from an Old Document from China” (“Ein altes Blatt aus China”), but in the final draft Kafka omitted this geographical reference, alluding to the invaders as nomads from the North. See Gray et al. 2005: 11. The original title points to the close relationship between “A Page from an Old Document” and “Building the Great Wall of China” (“Beim Bau der Chinesischen Mauer”), where the people of the northern lands, from whom the inhabitants wish to be protected by the wall, are also portrayed animalistically.\n\n11. Canetti 1988: 89.\n\n12. In a letter to Milena, Kafka mentions that he weighs 55 kilograms, which is about 120 pounds, while he was six feet tall (LM, 126). Deleuze and Guattari describe Kafka as anorectic. See Deleuze and Guattari 1986: 30. Kafka wrote in his diary that his body “hasn’t the least bit of fat to engender a blessed warmth, to preserve an inner fire, no fat on which the spirit could occasionally nourish itself beyond its daily need without damage to the whole” (D, 124–25), and in a letter to his father he portrays himself as “skinny, weakly, slight . . . a little skeleton, unsteady” (LFBV, 19).\n\n13.

Robert Lemon suggests that the sewing scissors, which are called Nähschere in German, highlight the ambivalence between proximity and separation, since the prefix Näh (sewing) is semantically, etymologically, and homonymically related to the word Nähe (closeness). See Lemon 2011: 94.\n\n33. The semiotics of dogs, in Western culture in general and in Kafka’s poetics in particular, is examined in the next chapter, which focuses on Kafka’s “Researches of a Dog.”\n\nChapter 4\n\n1.

Danchev 2011: 173.\n\n21. J. M. Coetzee echoes Josef K.’s last words in his 1999 novel Disgrace, explicitly defining their meaning. Lucy explains to her father why she decides to stay at her farm after the rape: “It is humiliating. But perhaps that is a good point to start from again. Perhaps that is what I must learn to accept. To start at ground level. With nothing. Not with nothing but. No cards, no weapons, no property, no rights, no dignity.” Her father’s reaction to this statement is “Like a dog,” and Lucy agrees: “Yes, like a dog.” See Coetzee 2000: 205. Similarly, in Remnants of Auschwitz (1999) Agamben quotes Josef K.’s famous last words, which are later echoed in Holocaust survivors’ testimonies, where the Muselmann is “like a stray dog.” See Agamben 1999: 104, 167.\n\n22. In the original German text, there is no reference to people; Kafka uses here the German word man, which is equivalent to “one” or “someone.” “Man rühmt oft den allgemeinen Fortschritt der Hundeschaft durch die Zeiten und meint damit wohl hauptsächlich den Fortschritt der Wissenschaft” (E, 435).\n\n23.

In the first book written on nonhuman animals in Kafka’s work, Die Funktion der Tierfiguren im Werke Franz Kafkas: Offene Erzählgerüste und Figurenspiele (1969) Karl Heinz Fingerhut compares the enigmatic biological status of the protagonist of “The Burrow” to that of Gregor Samsa in “The Metamorphosis.” See Fingerhut 1969: 190.\n\n3.

A study of nonhuman narrators, which focuses largely on Kafka’s “The Burrow,” quotes ethological accounts of wasps’ apparently mindless movements, which actually follow an instinctual logic closely reminiscent of the narrator’s single-minded obsession with the burrow in Kafka’s story. This wasp’s behavioral account is widely used by philosophers of mind to demonstrate that innate mechanisms can result in behavior that looks, from a human vantage point, irrational or even absurd. See Bernaerts et al. 20014: 80.\n\n9. Bangerter 1974: 12–13; Cohn 1978: 195–97; Pascal 1982: 190; Stahman 2004: 30.\n\n10. Baldick 2009: 219.\n\n11. Aristotle 1997: 24.\n\n12. Bal 2009: 182.\n\n13.

Dora Diamant, with whom Kafka spent the last year of his life, claimed that the burrow is the apartment they shared in Berlin and that the castle court (Burgplatz) is her. See Fingerhut 1969: 169. Philip Roth associatively links the burrow to Dora Diamant’s genitalia. See Roth 1975: 257.\n\n15. Stahman 2004: 22; Sussman 1977: 107.\n\n16. Dennett 1991: 174.\n\n17. Forster 1985: 4318.\n\n18.

Chris Danta states that Kafka identifies here with a nonhuman animal, because losing the ability to speak due to his illness reduced him to the level of a nonhuman animal; both share the burden of speechlessness. Additionally, Danta suggests that Kafka felt that he would die like an animal, reiterating the antihumanist sentiment of Ecclesiastes 3:19: “Man’s fate is like that of the animals; the same fate awaits both: As one dies, so dies the other. All have the same breath; man has no advantage over the animal.” See Danta 2008: 153.\n\n2.

The identification of the mouse people with the Jewish people is also based on a pun in German, as there is phonetic similarity between the words Mäuse (mice in German) and Moses, so “the mice people” sounds like “the people of Moses.” See Gray et al. 2005: 146. For the association of Jews with mice in German literature see Geller 2018: 68–70. In Page 179 →modern Jewish literature, this antisemitic metaphor is most famously depicted in Art Spiegelman’s graphic novel Maus, serialized from 1980 to 1991.\n\n5. Brod 1975: 192.\n\n6. For example, Heinz Politzer argues that while there is indeed a similarity between the mice and the Jewish people (both are threatened by the hostile world around them, both are waiting for a savior to deliver them, etc.), the fact that the mice are specifically described as lacking historical consciousness casts doubt on their identification with the Jewish people.

In this context it is worth citing Adorno’s remark, who brings into the dialogue the living/thing character of Odradek with the living/dead character of Gracchus: “The zone in which it is impossible to die is also the no-man’s land between man and thing: within it meets Odradek . . . and Gracchus, the humble descendant of Nimrod. The understanding of these most advanced, incommensurable productions, and of several others that similarly evade current conceptions of Kafka, may one day provide the key to the whole.” See Adorno 1981: 263.\n\nPrevious Chapter\n\nConclusion\n\nNext Chapter\n\nBibliography"
