They are grouped into 4 main themes: I. The Life and Work of Karl Schwarzschild; II. Black Holes in Classical General Relativity, Numerical Relativity, Astrophysics, Cosmology, and Alternative Theories of Gravity; III. Black Holes in Quantum Gravity and String Theory; IV. Other Topics in Contemporary Gravitation. Inspired by the foundational principle ``By acknowledging the past, we open a route to the future\",Â the week-long meeting, envisioned as a forum for exchange between scientists from all locations and levels of education, drew participants from 15 countries across 4 continents. In addition to plenary talks from leading researchers, a special focus on young talent was provided, a feature underlined by the Springer Prize for the best student and junior presentations.\n\nCentennial of General Relativity (1915-2015); The Schwarzschild Solution and Black Holes\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nBlinder, S. M.\n\n2015-01-01\n\nThis year marks the 100th anniversary of Einstein's General Theory of Relativity (1915-2015). The first nontrivial solution of the Einstein field equations was derived by Karl Schwarzschild in 1916. This Note will focus mainly on the Schwarzschild solution and the remarkable developments which it inspired, the most dramatic being the prediction of black holes. Later extensions of Schwarzschild's spacetime structure has led to even wilder conjectures, such as white holes and passages to other ...\n\nKarl Schwarzschild and the professionalization of astrophysics. (German Title: Karl Schwarzschild und die Professionalisierung der Astrophysik)\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nSchmidt-Kaler, Theodor\n\nProfessionalization is characteristic for physics and astronomy since 1830, and forms the basis for their rapid evolution in the 20th century. Karl Schwarzschild's contributions to professionalization of astronomy are presented: the introduction of course lectures in a repeating cycle, a permanent astrophysical laboratory, a tight connection between teaching and research, simulations and suggestions for astronomy at high schools and for the training of high school teachers, an interest in international organisation, and the initiative and planning of a southern observatory.\n\nGesammelte Werke / Collected Works\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nSchwarzschild, Karl; Voigt, Hans-Heinrich\n\nDer bekannte Astronom Karl Schwarzschild (1873-1916) gilt als der BegrÃ¼nder der Astrophysik und als hervorragender Forscher mit einer erstaunlichen Bandbreite seiner Interessen. Arbeiten zur Himmelsmechanik, Elektrodynamik und RelativitÃ¤tstheorie weisen ihn als vorzÃ¼glichen Mathematiker und Physiker auf der HÃ¶he seiner Zeit aus. Untersuchungen zur Photographischen Photometrie, Optik und Spektroskopie zeigen den versierten Beobachter, der sein MeÃinstrumentarium beherrscht, und schlieÃlich arbeitete Schwarzschild als Astrophysiker an SternatmosphÃ¤ren, Kometen, Struktur und Dynamik von Sternsystemen. Die in seinem kurzen Leben entstandene FÃ¼lle an wissenschaftlichen Arbeiten ist in drei BÃ¤nden der Gesamtausgabe gesammelt, ergÃ¤nzt durch biographisches Material, Annotationen von Fachleuten und einen Essay des NobelpreistrÃ¤gers S. Chandrasekhar. The well-known astronomer Karl Schwarzschild (1873-1916) is regarded as the founder of astrophysics and as an exceptionally talented researcher whose interests spanned a remarkably broad spectrum. His work on celestial mechanics, electrodynamics, and relativity theory demonstrates his great abilities as a mathematician and physicist who significantly influenced the science of his times. His investigations of photographic photometry, optics, and spectroscopy display his strengths as an observer who knew his instruments. But above all Schwarzschild pursued questions of astrophysics, addressing in particular stellar atmospheres, comets, and the structure and dynamics of stellar systems. The host of scientific works that he authored in his short life is now collected in the form of this three-volume complete works; it is supplemented by biographical material, notes from some of todays experts, and an essay by the Nobel Laureate S. Chandrasekhar.\n\nCurved spaces before Einstein: Karl Schwarzschild's cosmological speculations and the beginnings of relativistic cosmology (German Title: GekrÃ¼mmte Universen vor Einstein: Karl Schwarzschilds kosmologische Spekulationen und die AnfÃ¤nge der relativistischen Kosmologie)\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nSchemmel, Matthias\n\nIn contrast to most of his collegues in astronomy and physics, the German astronomer Karl Schwarzschild immediately recognized the significance of general relativity for physics and astronomy, and played a pioneering role in its early development. In this contribution, it is argued that the clue for understanding Schwarzschild's exceptional reaction to general relativity lies in the study of his prerelativistic work. Long before the rise of general relativity, Schwarzschild occupied himself with foundational problems on the borderline of physics, astronomy, and mathematics that, from today's perspective, belong to the field of problems of that theory. In this contribution, the example of Schwarzschild's early speculations about the non-Euclidean nature of physical space on cosmological scales is presented and their reflection in his reception of general relativity is discussed.\n\nKarl Schwarzschild's investigations of `out-of-focus photometry' between 1897 and 1899 at Kuffner Observatory in Vienna\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nHabison, Peter\n\nFrom 1897 to 1899 Karl Schwarzschild worked at the Kuffner Observatory in Vienna. During these years he developed new measuring techniques in the field of photographic photometry, where he studied particularly the quantitative determination of the departure from the reciprocity law during photographic exposure. This paper concentrates on Schwarzschild's early work in this field and gives an overview of his important Viennese years.\n\n3rd Karl Schwarzschild Meeting - Gravity and the Gauge/Gravity Correspondence\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nNicolini, Piero; Kaminski, Matthias; Mureika, Jonas; Bleicher, Marcus\n\n2018-01-01\n\nThe Karl Schwarzschild Meeting 2017 (KSM2017) has been the third instalment of the conference dedicated to the great Frankfurter scientist, who derived the first black hole solution of Einstein's equations about 100 years ago. The event has been a 5 day meeting in the field of black holes, AdS/CFT correspondence and gravitational physics. Like the two previous instalments, the conference continued to attract a stellar ensemble of participants from the world's most renowned institutions. The core of the meeting has been a series of invited talks from eminent experts (keynote speakers) as well as the presence of plenary research talks by students and junior speakers.\n\nMartin Schwarzschild (1912 - 1997)\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nPfau, Werner\n\nThe Chairman of the Astronomische Gesellschaft honored Martin Schwarzschild, who was the first to be presented with the Karl Schwarzschild Medal of the Astronomische Gesellschaft in 1957.

This talk will demonstrate how Schwarzschild's solution is linked to the black hole and how it took more than half a century for the physics community to accept that such a bizarre celestial object could exist in the universe.\n\nThe Schwarzschild metric: It's the coordinates, stupid!\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nFromholz, Pierre; Poisson, Eric; Will, Clifford M.\n\n2014-04-01\n\nEvery general relativity textbook emphasizes that coordinates have no physical meaning. Nevertheless, a coordinate choice must be made in order to carry out real calculations, and that choice can make the difference between a calculation that is simple and one that is a mess. We give a concrete illustration of the maxim that \"coordinates matter\" using the exact Schwarzschild solution for a vacuum, static spherical spacetime. We review the standard textbook derivation, Schwarzschild's original 1916 derivation, and a derivation using the Landau-Lifshitz formulation of the Einstein field equations. The last derivation is much more complicated, has one aspect for which we have been unable to find a solution, and gives an explicit illustration of the fact that the Schwarzschild geometry can be described in infinitely many coordinate systems.\n\nExact optics - III. Schwarzschild's spectrograph camera revised\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nWillstrop, R. V.\n\n2004-03-01\n\nKarl Schwarzschild identified a system of two mirrors, each defined by conic sections, free of third-order spherical aberration, coma and astigmatism, and with a flat focal surface. He considered it impractical, because the field was too restricted. This system was rediscovered as a quadratic approximation to one of Lynden-Bell's `exact optics' designs which have wider fields. Thus the `exact optics' version has a moderate but useful field, with excellent definition, suitable for a spectrograph camera. The mirrors are strongly aspheric in both the Schwarzschild design and the exact optics version.\n\nEinstein, Schwarzschild, the Perihelion Motion of Mercury and the Rotating Disk Story\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nWeinstein, Galina\n\n2014-01-01\n\nOn November 18, 1915 Einstein reported to the Prussian Academy that the perihelion motion of Mercury is explained by his new General Theory of Relativity: Einstein found approximate solutions to his November 11, 1915 field equations. Einstein's field equations cannot be solved in the general case, but can be solved in particular situations. The first to offer such an exact solution was Karl Schwarzschild. Schwarzschild found one line element, which satisfied the conditions imposed by Einstein...\n\nThe 100th birthday of the conic constant and Schwarzschild's revolutionary papers in optics\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nRakich, Andrew\n\n2005-08-01\n\nIn 1905 Karl Schwarzschild published three papers on optics, two of which revolutionized the field of reflecting telescope optics. In his first paper he developed a full theory of the aberrations of reflecting telescopes, generalizing the Eikonal of Bruns to take into account systems with an infinite long conjugate. In the second paper Schwarzschild applied his formulation to a masterful analysis of 2 mirror anastigmatic systems, along the way discovering the so called Ritchey-Chretien aplanat, 18 years Ritchey and Chretien's announcement. Numerous other innovations are given in what must be seen as being among the most important papers on the aberrations of optical systems ever written.\n\nAplanatic telescopes based on Schwarzschild optical configuration: from grazing incidence Wolter-like x-ray optics to Cherenkov two-mirror normal incidence telescopes\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nSironi, Giorgia\n\n2017-09-01\n\nAt the beginning of XX century Karl Schwarzschild defined a method to design large-field aplanatic telescopes based on the use of two aspheric mirrors. The approach was then refined by Couder (1926) who, in order to correct for the astigmatic aberration, introduced a curvature of the focal plane. By the way, the realization of normal-incidence telescopes implementing the Schwarzschild aplanatic configuration has been historically limited by the lack of technological solutions to manufacture and test aspheric mirrors. On the other hand, the Schwarzschild solution was recovered for the realization of coma-free X-ray grazing incidence optics. Wolter-like grazing incidence systems are indeed free of spherical aberration, but still suffer from coma and higher order aberrations degrading the imaging capability for off-axis sources. The application of the Schwarzschild's solution to X-ray optics allowed Wolter to define an optical system that exactly obeys the Abbe sine condition, eliminating coma completely. Therefore these systems are named Wolter-Schwarzschild telescopes and have been used to implement wide-field X-ray telescopes like the ROSAT WFC and the SOHO X-ray telescope. Starting from this approach, a new class of X-ray optical system was proposed by Burrows, Burg and Giacconi assuming polynomials numerically optimized to get a flat field of view response and applied by Conconi to the wide field x-ray telescope (WFXT) design. The Schwarzschild-Couder solution has been recently re-discovered for the application to normal-incidence Cherenkov telescopes, thanks to the suggestion by Vassiliev and collaborators. The Italian Institute for Astrophysics (INAF) realized the first Cherenkov telescope based on the polynomial variation of the Schwarzschild configuration (the so-called ASTRI telescope). Its optical qualification was successfully completed in 2016, demonstrating the suitability of the Schwarzschild-like configuration for the Cherenkov astronomy requirements\n\nEarly German plans for southern observatories\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nWolfschmidt, G.\n\n2002-07-01\n\nAs early as the 18th and 19th centuries, French and English observers were active in South Africa. Around the beginning of the 20th century, Heidelberg and Potsdam astronomers proposed a southern observatory. Then GÃ¶ttingen astronomers suggested building an observatory in Windhoek for photographing the sky and measuring the solar constant. In 1910 Karl Schwarzschild (1873-1916), after a visit to observatories in the United States, pointed out the usefulness of an observatory in South West Africa, in a climate superior to that in Germany, giving German astronomers access to the southern sky. Seeing tests were begun in 1910 by Potsdam astronomers, but WW I stopped the plans. In 1928 Erwin Finlay-Freundlich (1885-1964), inspired by the Hamburg astronomer Walter Baade (1893-1960), worked out a detailed plan for a southern observatory with a reflecting telescope, spectrographs and an astrograph with an objective prism. Paul Guthnick (1879-1947), director of the Berlin observatory, in cooperation with APO Potsdam and Hamburg, made a site survey to Africa in 1929 and found the conditions in Windhoek to be ideal. Observations were started in the 1930s by Berlin and Breslau astronomers, but were stopped by WW II. In the 1950s, astronomers from Hamburg and The Netherlands renewed the discussion in the framework of European cooperation, and this led to the founding of ESO in 1963.\n\nThe East German Research Landscape in Transition.

In the first part of this thesis two decay results are proven for general finite energy solutions to the linear wave equation on higher dimensional Schwarzschild black holes.

I will review the main formation channels for black hole seeds and their evolution through cosmic time. In this, emphasis will be placed on the observational diagnostics of astrophysical black holes and their role on the assembly of galaxy formation and evolution. I then review how these observations put constrain on the seed black hole formation theories. Finally, I present an outlook for how future observations can shed light on our understanding of black holes.

Phys. 86 (2017) 18-20\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nSpallicci, Alessandro D. A. M.\n\n2017-09-01\n\nComments are due on a recent paper by McGruder III (2017) in which the author deals with the concept of gravitational repulsion in the context of the Schwarzschild-Droste solution. Repulsion (deceleration) for ingoing particles into a black hole is a concept proposed several times starting from Droste himself in 1916. It is a coordinate effect appearing to an observer at a remote distance from the black hole and when coordinate time is employed. Repulsion has no bearing and relation to the local physics of the black hole, and moreover it cannot be held responsible for accelerating outgoing particles. Thereby, the energy boost of cosmic rays cannot be produced by repulsion.\n\nKarl Marx' glemte arvtager\n\nDEFF Research Database (Denmark)\n\nJakobsen, Uffe\n\n1988-01-01\n\nFor 50 Ã¥r siden hyldede avisen 'Social-Demokraten' Karl Kautsky (1854-1938) som \"den stÃ¸rste TÃ¦nker inden for den socialdemokratiske ArbejderbevÃ¦gelse\".

In the first approach, satellites move in the Schwarzschild space-time and the photons emitted by the satellites follow null geodesics of the Minkowski space-time asymptotic to the Schwarzschild geometry. This assumption leads to positioning errors since the photon world lines are not geodesics of any Minkowski geometry. In the second approach -the most coherent one- satellites and photons move in the Schwarzschild space-time. This approach is a first order one in the dimensionless parameter GM/R (with the speed of light c=1). The two approaches give different inertial coordinates for a given user. The differences are estimated and appropriately represented for users located inside a great region surrounding Earth. The resulting values (errors) are small enough to justify the use of the first approach, which is the simplest and the most manageable one. The satellite evolution mimics that of the GALILEO global navigation satellite system.

This characterization is obtained by performing a 3+1 decomposition of a certain invariant characterization of the Schwarzschild spacetime given in terms of concomitants of the Weyl tensor. This procedure renders a set of necessary conditions--which can be written in terms of the electric and magnetic parts of the Weyl tensor and their concomitants--for an initial data set to be a Schwarzschild initial data set. Our approach also provides a formula for a static Killing initial data set candidate--a KID candidate. Sufficient conditions for an initial data set to be a Schwarzschild initial data set are obtained by supplementing the necessary conditions with the requirement that the initial data set possesses a stationary Killing initial data set of the form given by our KID candidate. Thus, we obtain an algorithmic procedure of checking whether a given initial data set is Schwarzschildean or not\n\nKarl Marx\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nRosa Luxemburg\n\n2018-01-01\n\nMarx died on March 14, 1883.

Around the beginning of the 20th century the Heidelberg astronomer Max Wolf (1863-1932) proposed a southern observatory. In 1907 Hermann Carl Vogel (1841-1907), director of the Astrophysical Observatory Potsdam, suggested a southern station in Spain. His ideas for building an observatory in Windhuk for photographing the sky and measuring the solar constant were taken over by the GÃ¶ttingen astronomers. In 1910 Karl Schwarzschild (1873-1916), after having visited the observatories in America, pointed out the usefulness of an observatory in South West Africa, where it would have better weather than in Germany and also give access to the southern sky.

Over the last 90 years a tangle of specific perfect fluid spheres has been discovered, with most of these specific examples seemingly independent from each other. To bring some order to this collection, in this article we develop several new transformation theorems that map perfect fluid spheres into perfect fluid spheres. These transformation theorems sometimes lead to unexpected connections between previously known perfect fluid spheres, sometimes lead to new previously unknown perfect fluid spheres, and in general can be used to develop a systematic way of classifying the set of all perfect fluid spheres\n\nEditor's note: Reviews in Modern Astronomy 27\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nBerlepsch, Regina v.\n\n2015-06-01\n\nIn order to make the scientific events of the meetings of the Astronomische Gese llschaft (AG) more international and bring them to the attention of the worldwide astronomical community, it was decided to devote the Reviews in Modern Astronomy} to the outcomes of the large annual fall meetings of the AG. In particular, it emphasized the Karl Schwarzschild Lectures, the Ludwig Biermann Award Lectures, the invited reviews, and the highlight contributions on recent progress and achievements from leading scientists. The most prestigious of them, the Karl Schwarzschild Lectures, constitutes a special series of reviews by outstanding scientists who have been awarded the Karl Schwarzschild Medal during the fall meeting of the AG. At the same time, excellent young astronomers are honored by the Ludwig Biermann Award. In 2010 the ``Doctoral Thesis Award'' was established to honor the most outstanding Doctoral Thesis of the past year.\n\nAnalytic extension of the Schwarzschild-de Sitter metric\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nBazanski, S.L.; Ferrari, V.\n\n1986-01-01\n\nIn this paper, co-ordinates are derived that are regular, respectively, in the neighbourhood of the two horizons which exist in the so-called Schwarzschild-de Sitter solution known in general relativity, and it is constructed a manifold that is the analytic extension of the manifold being the domain of classical Schwarzschild-de Sitter co-ordinates\n\nSir Karl Popper and Education\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nMcNamara, D.

Abstracts\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nMachner, H.; Lieb, J.\n\n2000-08-01\n\nBefore summarizing details of the meeting, a short description of the spectrometer facility Big Karl is given. The facility is essentially a new instrument using refurbished dipole magnets from its predecessor. The large acceptance quadrupole magnets and the beam optics are new. Big Karl has a design very similar as the focussing spectrometers at MAMI (Mainz), AGOR (Groningen) and the high resolution spectrometer (HRS) in Hall A at Jefferson Laboratory with ÎE/E = 10 -4 but at some lower maximum momentum. The focal plane detectors consisting of multiwire drift chambers and scintillating hodoscopes are similar. Unlike HRS, Big Karl still needs Cerenkov counters and polarimeters in its focal plane; detectors which are necessary to perform some of the experiments proposed during the brainstorming. In addition, BIG KARL allows emission angle reconstruction via track measurements in its focal plane with high resolution. In the following the physics highlights, the proposed and potential experiments are summarized. During the meeting it became obvious that the physics to be explored at Big Karl can be grouped into five distinct categories, and this summary is organized accordingly.

Quantum modifications are covariantly encoded in a non-local effective action. We work to quadratic order in curvatures simultaneously taking local and non-local corrections into account. Looking for solutions perturbatively close to that of classical general relativity, we find that an eternal Schwarzschild black hole remains a solution and receives no quantum corrections up to this order in the curvature expansion. In contrast, the field of a massive star receives corrections which are fully determined by the effective field theory.

It is known that the singularity at r = 2Gm/c 2 is only apparent, a result of the coordinates in which the solution was found. Paradoxical results occuring near the singularity show the system of coordinates is incomplete. We introduce a simple, two-dimensional metric with an apparent singularity that makes it incomplete. By a straightforward, heuristic procedure we extend and complete this simple metric. We then use the same procedure to give a heuristic derivation of the Kruskal system of coordinates, which is known to extend the Schwarzschild manifold past its apparent singularity and produce a complete manifold\n\nOn quantum deformation of the Schwarzschild solution\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nKazakov, D.I.; Solodukhin, S.N.\n\n1993-01-01\n\nWe consider the deformation of the Schwarzschild solution in general relativity due to spherically symmetric quantum fluctuations of the metric and the matter fields. In this case, the 4 D theory of gravity with Einstein action reduces to the effective two-dimensional dilaton gravity. We have found that the Schwarzschild singularity at r=0 is shifted to the finite radius r min â¼ r PL , where the scalar curvature is finite, so that the space-time looks regular and consists of two asymptotically flat sheets glued at the hypersurface of constant radius.

The standard semiclassical techniques (such as Bogoliubov coefficients and Euclidean field theory) have been useful to study quantum effects in space-times with single horizons; however, none of these approaches seem to work for Schwarzschild-de Sitter space-time or, in general, for space-times with multiple horizons. We extend the method of complex paths to space-times with multiple horizons and obtain the spectrum of particles produced in these space-times. We show that the temperature of radiation in these space-times is proportional to the effective surface gravity--the inverse harmonic sum of surface gravity of each horizon. For the Schwarzschild-de Sitter space-time, we apply the method of complex paths to three different coordinate systems--spherically symmetric, Painleve, and Lemaitre. We show that the equilibrium temperature in Schwarzschild-de Sitter space-time is the harmonic mean of cosmological and event horizon temperatures. We obtain Bogoliubov coefficients for space-times with multiple horizons by analyzing the mode functions of the quantum fields near the horizons. We propose a new definition of entropy for space-times with multiple horizons, analogous to the entropic definition for space-times with a single horizon. We define entropy for these space-times to be inversely proportional to the square of the effective surface gravity. We show that this definition of entropy for Schwarzschild-de Sitter space-time satisfies the D-bound conjecture\n\nStatistical Entropy of Schwarzschild Black Holes\n\nCERN Document Server\n\nEnglert, F\n\n1998-01-01\n\nThe entropy of a seven dimensional Schwarzschild black hole of arbitrary large radius is obtained by a mapping onto a near extremal self-dual three-brane whose partition function can be evaluated. The three-brane arises from duality after submitting a neutral blackbrane, from which the Schwarzschild black hole can be obtained by compactification, to an infinite boost in non compact eleven dimensional space-time and then to a Kaluza-Klein compactification. This limit can be defined in precise terms and yields the Beckenstein-Hawking value up to a factor of order one which can be set to be exactly one with the extra assumption of keeping only transverse brane excitations. The method can be generalized to five and four dimensional black holes.\n\nONR (Office of Naval Research) Far East Scientific Bulletin.

Nevertheless, some solutions are known (e.g. Morris-Thorne wormholes) that do not match Schwarzschild asymptotically. On a phenomenological point of view, gravitational lensing in metrics falling as 1/r{sup q} has recently attracted great interest. In this work, we explore the conditions on the source matter for constructing static spherically symmetric metrics exhibiting an arbitrary power-law as Newtonian limit. For such space-times we also derive the expressions of gravitational redshift and force on probe masses, which, together with light deflection, can be used in astrophysical searches of non-Schwarzschild objects made up of exotic matter. Interestingly, we prove that even a minimally coupled scalar field with a power-law potential can support non-Schwarzschild metrics with arbitrary asymptotic behaviour.\n\n[Medical history impressions of Karl Marx 1983].\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nKaiser, W\n\n1983-12-15\n\nExcerpts of his London era first published on the occasion of the Karl Marx testimonials of 1983 gave rise to extend the memory of the fundamental achievements of Karl Marx to medico-historical aspects.

Besides the Admiralty that governed the naval actions, the harbor was supported by different organizations needed for normal functioning of the harbor. One of this organizations was Naval Technical Committee (Marine Technisches Komitee), founded in 1874 with the purpose of solving the technical and technological issues related to the navy. The outbreak of World War I (WWI) posed new challenges for Europe. Thus, on February 29th 1916, the Hygienic Institute was founded in the harbor area and Dr. Karl Cafasso was appointed as the first director. The purpose of the Institute was to provide scientific and professional aid to the Head of the Medical Corps of the Ports' Board (Kriegs-Hafenkommando) in the field of epidemiology, microbiology, social medicine and hygiene, the main fields of public health even today. By the end of the war, the Institute ceased its activity, and similar was founded only in 1938, under Italian rule and has been developed to the present Institute of Public Health.\n\nQuantum field theory in Schwarzschild and Rindler spaces\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nBoulware, D.G.\n\n1975-01-01\n\nThe problem of defining a scalar quantum field in the space-times described by the Schwarzschild and Rindler metrics is discussed. The matrix elements of the field operators are found by calculating the Green's functions for the fields. The requirement of positive frequencies for asymptotic timelike separations combined with a careful analysis of the continuity conditions at the event horizons yields a unique prescription for the Green's function. This in turn defines the vacuum state. In the Schwarzschild space the vacuum is shown to be stable and the lowest-energy state. In the Rindler space the quantization procedure yields the same results as quantization in Minkowski coordinates\n\nCardy-Verlinde Formula of Noncommutative Schwarzschild Black Hole\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nG. Abbas\n\n2014-01-01\n\nFull Text Available Few years ago, Setare (2006 has investigated the Cardy-Verlinde formula of noncommutative black hole obtained by noncommutativity of coordinates. In this paper, we apply the same procedure to a noncommutative black hole obtained by the coordinate coherent approach. The Cardy-Verlinde formula is entropy formula of conformal field theory in an arbitrary dimension. It relates the entropy of conformal field theory to its total energy and Casimir energy. In this paper, we have calculated the total energy and Casimir energy of noncommutative Schwarzschild black hole and have shown that entropy of noncommutative Schwarzschild black hole horizon can be expressed in terms of Cardy-Verlinde formula.\n\nThe effect of spherical shells of matter on the Schwarzschild black hole\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nDray, T.; Rijksuniversiteit Utrecht; Hooft, G. 't\n\n1985-01-01\n\nBased on previous work we show how to join two Schwarzschild solutions, possibly with different masses along null cylinders each representing a spherical shell of infalling or outgoing massless matter. One of the Schwarzschild masses can be zero, i.e. one region can be flat. The above procedure can be repeated to produce spacetimes with a C 0 metric describing several different (possibly flat) Schwarzschild regions separated by shells of matter. An exhaustive treatment of the ways of combining four such regions is given; the extension to many regions is then straightforward. Cases of special interest are: (1) the scattering of two spherical gravitational ''shock waves'' at the horizon of a Schwarzschild black hole, and (2) a configuration involving only one external universe, which may be relevant to quantization problems in general relativity. In the latter example, only an infinitesimal amount of matter is sufficient to remove the ''Wheeler wormhole'' to another universe.

We analyze the influence of acceleration on these holonomies. An effect similar to Thomas precession is observed within the process of Fermi-Walker transport along these circular orbits which are studied in the limit of vanishing cosmological constant in Schwarzschild-AdS case; also we obtain Fermi-Walker transport in a Schwarzschild background. In the case of a Schwarzschild spacetime, we analyze the quantized band holonomy invariance. In the limit of zero acceleration we recover the well-known results for holonomy matrix obtained by parallel transport in all these spacetimes.

The significantly differentially expressed miRNAs were identified in stimulated samples at each time point compared to time-matched controls, respectively. The target genes of consistently differentially expressed miRNAs were screened from miRDB and microRNA.org databases, followed by Gene Ontology (GO) and pathway enrichment analysis and regulatory network construction. The overlapping target genes for consistently differentially expressed miRNAs were also identified from these 2 databases. Furthermore, the potential binding sites of miRNAs and their target genes were analyzed.Rno-miR-187-3p was consistently downregulated in stimulated groups compared with time-matched controls. The predicted target genes of rno-miR-187-3p were enriched in different GO terms and pathways. In addition, 7 overlapping target genes of rno-miR-187-3p were identified, including NFS1, PAQR4, CAND1, DCLK1, PRKAR2A, AKAP3, and KCNK10. These 7 overlapping target genes were determined to have a different number of matched binding sites with rno-miR-187-3p.Our study suggests that miR-187-3p may play an important role in epilepsy development and progression via regulating numerous target genes, such as NFS1, CAND1, DCLK1, AKAP3, and KCNK10. Determining the underlying mechanism of the role of miR-187-3p in epilepsy may make it a potential therapeutic option.\n\nGeneral Relativity During the Great War\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nTrimble, Virginia L.\n\n2016-01-01\n\nEinstein's (and Hilbert's) equations saw light of day in the darkness of Berlin 1915, as is well known. Moving from this highlight to less conspicuous topics, we find Karl Schwarzschild's solution of those equations (1916) followed shortly by his death. On the observational and American front, Slipher's assemblage of galaxy radial velocities, begun in 1912 with M31, continued apace. Shapley was busily moving us out of the galactic center. Also at Mt. Wilson, Charles St. John looked for gravitational redshift in the solar spectrum in 1917 without firmly detecting it. Adams demonstrated the very low luminosities of Sirius B and 40 Eri B in 1914 (but his attempt at a redshift for the former came only in 1923). Perhaps least well known is that a handful of additional critical theoretical papers date from the war years and describe the Lense-Thirring effect, the Reissner-Nordstrom solution, and a charged solution with a cosmological constant (due to the even more obscure Friedrich Kottler). Some of these came out of neutral Holland, but Kottler served both at Ypres and on the Galician front. Interesting mixes of military service and relativistic contributions are also associated with the names of Friedmann, Le LemaÃ®tre, Weyl (of the tensor), Minkowski, Hubble, Flamm, Droste, and Kretschmann. Astronomers in neutral Denmark, Holland and (until 1917) the USA facilitated transmittal of astronomical observations and other news across the battle lines so that Schwarzschild received an obituary in Nature and Moseley one in Naturwissenschaften.\n\nReading BEA II in Irvine (And Elsewhere)\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nTrimble, Virginia L.\n\n2017-01-01\n\nIt is just possible that the number of BEA authors and editors exceeds the number of its readers, but I doubt this, having done all three. Perhaps unusually, I have gone through each edition page by page: BEA I several years ago, looking for what everybody who was alive at the time did during World War I, and BEA II just recently, in the process of compiling potted history of the development of stellar astronomy and astrophysics in Germany. Neither task would have been possible without BEA, which I therefore celebrate, along with Tom Hockey's enormous foresight, energy, and persistence. If we were starting over, I (and probably he!) would ask authors and editors for at least two things -- closer adherence to a format that puts the most notable work (why this person is here!) first, followed by \"life\" and \"works\" - and, where the information is available, what the person did or had happen that must surely have influenced life, beliefs, philosophy, what haveyou, beyond the scientific achievements. We know what Einstein, Karl Schwarzschild, and Rudolph Minkowski were doing in 1916, while a number of other articles have holes about that time. And it is obvious why Martin Schwarzschild and Hans Bethe ceased to be German astronomers; not so obvious for others. And, while we are at it, what turned von WeizsÃ¤cker and Albert Wilson so firmly away from the science in which they had already left large footprints?\n\nUn-graviton corrections to the Schwarzschild black hole\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nGaete, Patricio; Helayel-Neto, Jose A.; Spallucci, Euro\n\n2010-01-01\n\nWe introduce an effective action smoothly extending the standard Einstein-Hilbert action to include un-gravity effects. The improved field equations are solved for the un-graviton corrected Schwarzschild geometry reproducing the Mureika result. This is an important test to confirm the original 'guess' of the form of the un-Schwarzschild metric. Instead of working in the weak field approximation and 'dressing' the Newtonian potential with un-gravitons, we solve the 'effective Einstein equations' including all order un-gravity effects. An unexpected 'bonus' of accounting un-gravity effects is the fractalisation of the event horizon. In the un-gravity dominated regime the event horizon thermodynamically behaves as fractal surface of dimensionality twice the scale dimension d U .\n\nThe East German Research Landscape in Transition Part A: Status and Transition\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\n1993-03-02\n\ntraditional Meteorologisches Observatorium Potsdam, and Prof. Siegfried Marx of the Karl - Schwarzschild -Observatorium Tautenburg.

Yet, as different notations and conventions have been used throughout the years, the literature on the subject is often confusing and sometimes confused. The purpose of this review is to review and collect the relevant expressions related to the Regge-Wheeler and Zerilli equations for the odd and even-parity perturbations of a Schwarzschild spacetime. Special attention is paid to the form they assume in the presence of matter-sources and, for the two most popular conventions in the literature, to the asymptotic expressions and gravitational-wave amplitudes. Besides pointing out some inconsistencies in the literature, the expressions collected here could serve as a quick reference for the calculation of the perturbations of a Schwarzschild black-hole spacetime driven by generic sources and for those approaches in which gravitational waves are extracted from numerically generated spacetimes.

The power reflection coefficients and the phase shifts of the partial waves are evaluated at both high and low frequencies. Then the scattering and absorption cross sections of the black hole are determined. It is shown that the black hole is almost unable to absorb electromagnetic waves when the wave length of the radiation is greater than the Schwarzschild radius\n\nKuninganna Kristiina ning kunungas Karl XI : rootsiaegsed portreed raekojas = Queen Christina and King Karl XI : portraits of the Swedish period in the Town Hall / Pia Ehasalu\n\nIndex Scriptorium Estoniae\n\nEhasalu, Pia, 1964-\n\n2004-01-01\n\nKuninganna Kristiina portreest lapsena (1638).

When the dose rate applied to achieve a given dose was reduced by a factor of 12, the net optical density was reduced by up to 5%. The clinical importance of this effect is negligible as long as the films are calibrated at a value of the dose rate approximately representative of the dose rates occurring in the target volume, but in target regions of strongly reduced dose rate the Schwarzschild effect should be allowed for by a correction of the net optical density.\n\nTrÃ¦k af en ung Karl Marx\n\nDEFF Research Database (Denmark)\n\nZiegler, Magnus MÃ¸ller\n\n2018-01-01\n\nDet kritiske program, som var Karl Marx' bidrag til bÃ¥de tÃ¦nkningen og den revolutionÃ¦re bevÃ¦gelse, tog sit udgangspunkt i det filosofiske miljÃ¸, der dominerede i Tyskland i 1840'erne.......Det kritiske program, som var Karl Marx' bidrag til bÃ¥de tÃ¦nkningen og den revolutionÃ¦re bevÃ¦gelse, tog sit udgangspunkt i det filosofiske miljÃ¸, der dominerede i Tyskland i 1840'erne....\n\nTaub-NUT spinless particles and Schwarzschild spinning particles\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nBini, D.; La Sapienza Univ., Rome\n\n2005-01-01\n\nThe effect of a small gravitomagnetic monopole on (accelerated) circular orbits in the equatorial plane of the Taub-NUT space-time is compared to the corresponding (accelerated) orbits pushed slightly off the equatorial plane in the absence of the monopole (Schwarzschild space-time)\n\n'Doing theology as though nothing had happened' â reading Karl ...\n\nAfrican Journals Online (AJOL)\n\n'Doing theology as though nothing had happened' â reading Karl Barth's confessional theology in Zimbabwe today? ...

In such space analytical and numerical solutions of null and time like geodesics are investigated. The string parameter a + is found to affect both the angle of deflection in null geodesics and the precession of perihelion on time like geodesics .It is seen that the deflection of null and time like geodesics near the gravitating mass of de-sitter space time increases with t he gravitational field of a straight string in flat space time has the property that the Newtonian potential vanishes yet there are non trivial gravitational effects. A test particle is neither attracted nor repelled by a string, yet the conical nature of space outside of string produces observable effects such as light deflection . Schwarzschild Black hole is a mathematical solution to the Einstein's field equations and corresponds to the gravitational field of massive compact spherically symmetric ob normal. References 1.

On the contrary, geodesic orbit equations for a proper spatial submanifold of Schwarzschild metric at any given coordinate-time correspond to an unphysical gravitational repulsion in the non-relativistic limit. This demonstrates at a basic level the centrality and critical role of relativistic time and its intimate pseudo-Riemannian connection with space. Correspondingly, a commonly popularised depiction of geodesic orbits of planets as resulting from the curvature of space produced by the Sun, represented as a rubber sheet dipped in the middle by the weighing of that massive body, is mistaken and misleading for the essence of relativity, even in the non-relativistic limit.\n\nConsequences of the 1873 Economic Crisis for the Argentinian State Educational Design\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nDuarte, Oscar Daniel\n\n2016-01-01\n\nThis article aims to explain the ultimate organisation of the Argentinian educational system during the 1870s as a result of the 1873 world economic crisis, which led, among other measures, to budget cuts.

We present an exhaustive analysis for determining the quasinormal modes of a test scalar field propagating in a new class of black hole backgrounds in the case of pure Einstein-Weyl gravity. Our result shows that the field decay of quasinormal modes in such a non-Schwarzschild black hole behaves similarly to the Schwarzschild one, but the decay slope becomes much smoother due to the appearance of the Weyl tensor square in the background theory. We also analyze the frequencies of the quasinormal modes in order to characterize the properties of new back holes, and thus, if these modes can be the source of gravitational waves, the underlying theories may be testable in future gravitational wave experiments. We briefly comment on the issue of quantum (in)stability in this theory at linear order.\n\nConstant scalar curvature hypersurfaces in extended Schwarzschild space-time\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nPareja, M.

Identifying the black hole temperature with the energy from the modified dispersion relation, we obtain the modified entropy and thermodynamic energy along with the modified local temperature in the cavity to provide well defined black hole states. It is found that apart from the conventional critical temperature related to Hawking-Page phase transition there appears an additional critical temperature which is of relevance to the existence of a locally stable tiny black hole; however, the off-shell free energy tells us that this black hole should eventually tunnel into the stable large black hole. Finally, we discuss the reason why the temperature near the horizon is finite in the rainbow black hole by employing the running gravitational coupling constant, whereas it is divergent near the horizon in the ordinary Schwarzschild black hole\n\nKarl Marx and the Environment\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nShifferd, K.

In a subsequent paper, Wolfgang Kokott describes the role of the Astronomisches Jahrbuch (published from 1776 by the Royal Academy of Sciences at Berlin), a ranking international publication, with Bode's modest Berlin Observatory serving as a clearinghouse of information originating from virtually all European countries. \"Karl Schwarzschild and the professionalisation of Astrophysics\" is the title of Theodor Schmidt-Kaler's contribution and presents Schwarzschild's contributions to professionalization of astronomy: establishment of course lectures and a permanent astrophysical laboratory, a tight connection between teaching and research, stimulations and suggestions for astronomy at high school and for the formation of high school teachers, international organisation, and the planning of a southern observatory. Peter Habison describes the contribution of Leo de Ball (1853-1916, Director of the Kuffner Observatory in Vienna) to international astronomy.

Ghaderi\n\n2016-02-01\n\nFull Text Available In this paper, we study the thermodynamics of the Schwarzschild and the ReissnerâNordstrÃ¶m black holes surrounded by quintessence. By using the thermodynamical laws of the black holes, we derive the thermodynamic properties of these black holes and we compare the results with each other. We investigate the mass, temperature and heat capacity as functions of entropy for these black holes. We also discuss the equation of state of the Schwarzschild and the ReissnerâNordstrÃ¶m black holes surrounded by quintessence.\n\nEffective Stringy Description of Schwarzschild Black Holes\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nKrasnov , Kirill; Solodukhin , Sergey N.\n\n2004-01-01\n\nWe start by pointing out that certain Riemann surfaces appear rather naturally in the context of wave equations in the black hole background. For a given black hole there are two closely related surfaces. One is the Riemann surface of complexified ``tortoise'' coordinate. The other Riemann surface appears when the radial wave equation is interpreted as the Fuchsian differential equation. We study these surfaces in detail for the BTZ and Schwarzschild black holes in four and higher dimensions....\n\nThe Planck Vacuum and the Schwarzschild Metrics\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nDaywitt W. C.\n\n2009-07-01\n\nFull Text Available The Planck vacuum (PV is assumed to be the source of the visible universe. So under conditions of sufficient stress, there must exist a pathway through which energy from the PV can travel into this universe. Conversely, the passage of energy from the visible universe to the PV must also exist under the same stressful conditions. The following examines two versions of the Schwarzschild metric equation for compatability with this open-pathway idea.\n\nJustus Von Liebig, 1803-1873.

In particular, the Schwarzschild solution corresponds to a rather trivial solution of Laplace's equation expressed in terms of prolate spheroidal coordinates. It took about 45 years before Roy Kerr discovered what he called the 'rotating Schwarzschild solution', and an additional five years before I established that from any complex axisymmetric solution \\\\E of the nonlinear equation (\\\\Re E)\\\n\nA DIMENSÃO ECLESIAL DOS SACRAMENTOS SEGUNDO KARL RAHNER\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nP.

In this context, it is also aimed to assess Habermasâ critics as âpositivistâ to Karl Popper who is an opponent to positivism inside it and his abstraction on the âthree world theoryâ under the influence of Karl Popper. The differences between their opinions stem from their main arguments about the methodology of natural and social sciences.\n\nFirst record of Centromerus arcanus (O.

To test the validity of the results we prove theorems for limiting cases. We recover the Newtonian gas law subject only to tidal forces in the Newtonian limit. Additionally we recover the special relativistic gas law as the radius of the orbit increases to infinity. We also discuss how the method can be extended to the non ideal gas case.\n\nEntanglement redistribution in the Schwarzschild spacetime\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nWang, Jieci; Pan, Qiyuan; Jing, Jiliang\n\n2010-01-01\n\nThe effect of Hawking radiation on the redistribu"
