        "meta_description": "Abstract. Changing climatic conditions can shape the strength and extent of the oxygen minimum zone (OMZ). The presence and variability of the OMZ in the Arabian Sea is of importance to the latter's ecosystem. The state of oxygenation has, for instance, an impact on the pelagic and benthic faunal community or the nitrogen and carbon cycles. It is important to understand the dynamics of the OMZ and related marine environmental conditions because of their climate feedbacks. In this study, we combined three independent proxies to reconstruct the oxygenation state of the water column and bottom water in the Gulf of Oman for the past 43âkyr approximately. This multi-proxy approach is done for the first time at the northeastern Oman margin located in the Gulf of Oman. We used bulk sedimentary nitrogen isotopes (Î´15N) and the alkane ratio (lycopane +n-C35)/n-C31 and benthic foraminiferal faunal analysis to reconstruct the strength of the OMZ in the water column and bottom water oxygenation, respectively. Our results show that the Gulf of Oman experienced strong pronounced OMZ and bottom water deoxygenation during the Holocene. In contrast, during Marine Isotope StageÂ 2Â (MISÂ 2), including the Last Glacial MaximumÂ (LGM), the Gulf of Oman was very well ventilated, with a highly diverse benthic foraminiferal community. This may have been caused by stronger wind-induced mixing and better ventilation by oxygen-rich water masses. Our results also show moderate oxygenation during MISÂ 3, with deoxygenation events during most of the warmer DansgaardâOeschger (DâO) events. We propose two distinct oxygenation modes for the Gulf of Oman: (1)Â a stable period of either strongly pronounced water column OMZ and bottom water deoxygenation or well-oxygenated water column and bottom water conditions and (2)Â an unstable period of oscillating oxygenation states between moderately oxygenated (stadials) and deoxygenated (interstadials, DâOÂ events) conditions. The unstable period may be triggered by an interstadial Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) mode, which is required to initiate DâOÂ events.",

We find SST variations of up to seven degree with lower SSTs during Heinrich Events (HE), especially HE4, and higher SSTs during Dansgaard-Oeschger Events. Our record shows no profound cooling during the Last Glacial Maximum but abrupt variations during the Holocene.

We noticed a north-south SST gradient and the biological proxies showed more organic matter from larger algae in the north. Smaller algae and zooplankton were high in the south. These trends were related to ocean-atmospheric processes and oxygen availability.\n\nSignals of Holocene climate transition amplified by anthropogenic land-use changes in the westerlyâIndian monsoon realm\n\nNicole Burdanowitz, Tim Rixen, Birgit Gaye, and Kay-Christian Emeis\n\nClim. Past, 17, 1735–1749, https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-17-1735-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-17-1735-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nTo study the interaction of the westerlies and Indian summer monsoon (ISM) during the Holocene, we used paleoenvironmental reconstructions using a sediment core from the northeast Arabian Sea. We found a climatic transition period between 4.6 and 3 ka BP during which the ISM shifted southwards and the influence of Westerlies became prominent. Our data indicate a stronger influence of agriculture activities and enhanced soil erosion, adding to Bond event impact after this transition period.\n\nGlacialâinterglacial changes and Holocene variations in Arabian Sea denitrification\n\nBirgit Gaye, Anna BÃ¶ll, Joachim Segschneider, Nicole Burdanowitz, Kay-Christian Emeis, Venkitasubramani Ramaswamy, Niko Lahajnar, Andreas LÃ¼ckge, and Tim Rixen\n\nBiogeosciences, 15, 507–527, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-15-507-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-15-507-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe Arabian Sea has one of the most severe oxygen minima of the world's oceans between about 100 and 1200 m of water depth and is therefore a major oceanic nitrogen sink. Stable nitrogen isotopic ratios in sediments record changes in oxygen concentrations and were studied for the last 25 kyr. Oxygen concentrations dropped at the end of the last glacial and became further reduced during the Holocene, probably due to the increasing age of the low-oxygen water mass.\n\nSpatial and temporal variability of sea surface temperatures and monsoon dynamics in the northwestern Arabian Sea during the last 43 kyr\n\nJan Maier, Nicole Burdanowitz, Gerhard Schmiedl, and Birgit Gaye\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1072,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1072, 2024\n\nThis preprint is open for discussion and under review for Climate of the Past (CP).\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe reconstruct sea surface temperatures (SSTs) of the past 43 ka in the Gulf of Oman. We find SST variations of up to seven degree with lower SSTs during Heinrich Events (HE), especially HE4, and higher SSTs during Dansgaard-Oeschger Events. Our record shows no profound cooling during the Last Glacial Maximum but abrupt variations during the Holocene. We surmise that SSTs variations are influenced by the southwest (northeast) Monsoon during warmer (colder) periods.\n\nSedimentary organic matter signature hints at the phytoplankton-driven Biological Carbon Pump in the Central Arabian Sea\n\nMedhavi Pandey, Haimanti Biswas, Daniel Birgel, Nicole Burdanowitz, and Birgit Gaye\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-845,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-845, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe analyzed the sea surface temperature (SST) proxy and plankton biomarkers in sediments, that accumulate sinking materials signatures from surface waters in the Central Arabian Sea (21°–11° N, 64° E), a tropical basin impacted by monsoon. We noticed a north-south SST gradient and the biological proxies showed more organic matter from larger algae in the north. Smaller algae and zooplankton were high in the south.

Six, Uwe Mikolajewicz, and Gerhard Schmiedl\n\nClim. Past Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-2024-9,https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-2024-9, 2024\n\nRevised manuscript accepted for CP\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe use a comprehensive ocean model of the Mediterranean Sea to obtain the first consistent patterns of the physical-biogeochemical states for the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) and today. Circulation changes due to low sea level during the LGM lead to reduced net primary production, but cold temperatures depress bacterial activity, resulting in an increased flux of organic matter to the seafloor. We also discuss potential biases that occur when climate signals are collected in organic material.\n\nChanges in the Red Sea overturning circulation during Marine Isotope StageÂ 3\n\nRaphaÃ«l Hubert-Huard, Nils Andersen, Helge W. Arz, Werner Ehrmann, and Gerhard Schmiedl\n\nClim. Past, 20, 267–280, https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-20-267-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-20-267-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe have studied the geochemistry of benthic foraminifera (micro-fossils) from a sediment core from the Red Sea. Our data show that the circulation and carbon cycling of the Red Sea during the last glacial period responded to high-latitude millennial-scale climate variability and to the orbital influence of the African–Indian monsoon system. This implies a sensitive response of the Red Sea to climate changes.\n\nMonsoon-driven changes in aeolian and fluvial sediment input to the central Red Sea recorded throughout the last 200 000 years\n\nWerner Ehrmann, Paul A. Wilson, Helge W. Arz, Hartmut Schulz, and Gerhard Schmiedl\n\nClim. Past, 20, 37–52, https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-20-37-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-20-37-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nClimatic and associated hydrological changes controlled the aeolian versus fluvial transport processes and the composition of the sediments in the central Red Sea through the last ca. 200 kyr. We identify source areas of the mineral dust and pulses of fluvial discharge based on high-resolution grain size, clay mineral, and geochemical data, together with Nd and Sr isotope data. We provide a detailed reconstruction of changes in aridity/humidity.\n\nA nitrate budget of the Bohai Sea based on an isotope mass balance model\n\nShichao Tian, Birgit Gaye, Jianhui Tang, Yongming Luo, Wenguo Li, Niko Lahajnar, Kirstin DÃ¤hnke, Tina Sanders, Tianqi Xiong, Weidong Zhai, and Kay-Christian Emeis\n\nBiogeosciences, 19, 2397–2415, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-19-2397-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-19-2397-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe constrain the nitrogen budget and in particular the internal sources and sinks of nitrate in the Bohai Sea by using a mass-based and dual stable isotope approach based on δ15N and δ18O of nitrate. Based on available mass fluxes and isotope data an updated nitrogen budget is proposed. Compared to previous estimates, it is more complete and includes the impact of the interior cycle (nitrification) on the nitrate pool. The main external nitrogen sources are rivers contributing 19.2 %–25.6 %.\n\nWhat can we learn from amino acids about oceanic organic matter cycling and degradation?\n\nBirgit Gaye, Niko Lahajnar, Natalie Harms, Sophie Anna Luise Paul, Tim Rixen, and Kay-Christian Emeis\n\nBiogeosciences, 19, 807–830, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-19-807-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-19-807-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAmino acids were analyzed in a large number of samples of particulate and dissolved organic matter from coastal regions and the open ocean. A statistical analysis produced two new biogeochemical indicators. An indicator of sinking particle and sediment degradation (SDI) traces the degradation of organic matter from the surface waters into the sediments. A second indicator shows the residence time of suspended matter in the ocean (RTI).\n\nSignals of Holocene climate transition amplified by anthropogenic land-use changes in the westerlyâIndian monsoon realm\n\nNicole Burdanowitz, Tim Rixen, Birgit Gaye, and Kay-Christian Emeis\n\nClim.

We found a climatic transition period between 4.6 and 3 ka BP during which the ISM shifted southwards and the influence of Westerlies became prominent. Our data indicate a stronger influence of agriculture activities and enhanced soil erosion, adding to Bond event impact after this transition period.\n\nReviews and syntheses: Present, past, and future of the oxygen minimum zone in the northern Indian Ocean\n\nTim Rixen, Greg Cowie, Birgit Gaye, Joaquim Goes, Helga do RosÃ¡rio Gomes, Raleigh R. Hood, Zouhair Lachkar, Henrike Schmidt, Joachim Segschneider, and Arvind Singh\n\nBiogeosciences, 17, 6051–6080, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-17-6051-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-17-6051-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe northern Indian Ocean hosts an extensive oxygen minimum zone (OMZ), which intensified due to human-induced global changes. This includes the occurrence of anoxic events on the Indian shelf and affects benthic ecosystems and the pelagic ecosystem structure in the Arabian Sea. Consequences for biogeochemical cycles are unknown, which, in addition to the poor representation of mesoscale features, reduces the reliability of predictions of the future OMZ development in the northern Indian Ocean.\n\nCalcification and latitudinal distribution of extant coccolithophores across the Drake Passage during late austral summer 2016\n\nMariem Saavedra-Pellitero, Karl-Heinz Baumann, Miguel Ãngel Fuertes, Hartmut Schulz, Yann Marcon, Nele Manon Vollmar, JosÃ©-Abel Flores, and Frank Lamy\n\nBiogeosciences, 16, 3679–3702, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-16-3679-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-16-3679-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nOpen ocean phytoplankton include coccolithophore algae, a key element in carbon cycle regulation with important feedbacks to the climate system. We document latitudinal variability in both coccolithophore assemblage and the mass variation in one particular species, Emiliania huxleyi, for a transect across the Drake Passage (in the Southern Ocean). Coccolithophore abundance, diversity and maximum depth habitat decrease southwards, coinciding with changes in the predominant E. huxleyi morphotypes.\n\nNutrient distribution and nitrogen and oxygen isotopic composition of nitrate in water masses of the subtropical southern Indian Ocean\n\nNatalie C. Harms, Niko Lahajnar, Birgit Gaye, Tim Rixen, Kirstin DÃ¤hnke, Markus Ankele, Ulrich Schwarz-Schampera, and Kay-Christian Emeis\n\nBiogeosciences, 16, 2715–2732, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-16-2715-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-16-2715-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe Indian Ocean subtropical gyre is a large oligotrophic area that is likely to adjust to continued warming by increasing stratification, reduced nutrient supply and decreasing biological production. In this study, we investigated concentrations of nutrients and stable isotopes of nitrate. We determine the lateral influence of water masses entering the gyre from the northern Indian Ocean and from the Southern Ocean and quantify the input of nitrogen by N2 fixation into the surface layer.\n\nThe ballast effect of lithogenic matter and its influences on the carbon fluxes in the Indian Ocean\n\nTim Rixen, Birgit Gaye, Kay-Christian Emeis, and Venkitasubramani Ramaswamy\n\nBiogeosciences, 16, 485–503, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-16-485-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-16-485-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nData obtained from sediment trap experiments in the Indian Ocean indicate that lithogenic matter ballast increases organic carbon flux rates on average by 45 % and by up to 62 % at trap locations in the river-influenced regions of the Indian Ocean. Such a strong lithogenic matter ballast effect implies that land use changes and the associated enhanced transport of lithogenic matter may significantly affect the CO2 uptake of the organic carbon pump in the receiving ocean areas.\n\nGlacialâinterglacial changes and Holocene variations in Arabian Sea denitrification\n\nBirgit Gaye, Anna BÃ¶ll, Joachim Segschneider, Nicole Burdanowitz, Kay-Christian Emeis, Venkitasubramani Ramaswamy, Niko Lahajnar, Andreas LÃ¼ckge, and Tim Rixen\n\nBiogeosciences, 15, 507–527, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-15-507-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-15-507-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe Arabian Sea has one of the most severe oxygen minima of the world's oceans between about 100 and 1200 m of water depth and is therefore a major oceanic nitrogen sink. Stable nitrogen isotopic ratios in sediments record changes in oxygen concentrations and were studied for the last 25 kyr. Oxygen concentrations dropped at the end of the last glacial and became further reduced during the Holocene, probably due to the increasing age of the low-oxygen water mass.\n\nPlants in movement – Floristic and climatic characterization of the New Jersey hinterland during the Palaeogene–Neogene transition in relation to major glaciation events\n\nSabine Prader, Ulrich Kotthoff, Francine M.G. McCarthy, Gerhard Schmiedl, Timme H. Donders, and David R. Greenwood\n\nBiogeosciences Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-2017-511,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-2017-511, 2018\n\nManuscript not accepted for further review\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe observed palaeovegetation movement signals probably correspond to several glacial phases of the middle Oligocene and Early Miocene and might be best reflected within peaks of the conifer forests. Glacial phases exposed shallow shelf areas and allowed the spreading of substrate-depending forest formations. Temperature estimates revealing relative stable humid warm temperate conditions. A Sporadic occurred extinct taxon widens the understanding of its distribution pattern during the Cenozoic.\n\nA multi-proxy analysis of Late Quaternary ocean and climate variability for the Maldives, Inner Sea\n\nDorothea Bunzel, Gerhard Schmiedl, Sebastian Lindhorst, Andreas Mackensen, JesÃºs Reolid, Sarah Romahn, and Christian Betzler\n\nClim. Past, 13, 1791–1813, https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-13-1791-2017,https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-13-1791-2017, 2017\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe investigated a sediment core from the Maldives to unravel the interaction between equatorial climate and ocean variability of the past 200 000 years. The sedimentological, geochemical and foraminiferal data records reveal enhanced dust, which was transported by intensified winter monsoon winds during glacial conditions. Precessional fluctuations of bottom water oxygen suggests an expansion of the Arabian Sea OMZ and a varying inflow of Antarctic Intermediate Water.\n\nCombined North Atlantic and anthropogenic forcing of changes in the marine environments in the Gulf of Taranto (Italy) during the last millennium\n\nValerie Menke, Werner Ehrmann, Yvonne Milker, Swaantje Brzelinski, JÃ¼rgen MÃ¶bius, Uwe Mikolajewicz, Bernd Zolitschka, Karin Zonneveld, Kay Christian Emeis, and Gerhard Schmiedl\n\nClim.

Our data suggest, that processes at the sea floor are linked to the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation. During the past 200 years, the effects of rising northern hemisphere temperature and increasing anthropogenic activity enhanced nutrient and organic matter fluxes leading to more eutrophic conditions.\n\nThe Ballast Effect in the Indian Ocean\n\nTim Rixen, Birgit Gaye, Kay-Christian Emeis, and Venkitasubramani Ramaswamy\n\nBiogeosciences Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-2017-317,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-2017-317, 2017\n\nManuscript not accepted for further review\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nSediment trap experiments showed that in the river-influenced regions of the Indian Ocean lithogenic matter supplied from land controls the organic carbon export into the deep sea via its ballast effect in sinking particles. Carbonate produced by plankton is the main ballast material in the open ocean. The ballast effect increases the CO2 uptake of the organic carbon pump by enhancing the amount of nutrients used to bind CO2 and by favouring the sedimentation of organic matter.\n\nThe C32 alkane-1,15-diol as a proxy of late Quaternary riverine input in coastal margins\n\nJulie Lattaud, Denise Dorhout, Hartmut Schulz, Isla S.

In combination with indices of carbonate preservation and bottom water redox conditions, we demonstrate that a persistent solar influence was modulating summer monsoon intensity. Furthermore, bottom water conditions are linked to atmospheric forcing, rather than changes of intermediate water masses.\n\nStable carbon isotope gradients in benthic foraminifera as proxy for organic carbon fluxes in the Mediterranean Sea\n\nMarc Theodor, Gerhard Schmiedl, Frans Jorissen, and Andreas Mackensen\n\nBiogeosciences, 13, 6385–6404, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-13-6385-2016,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-13-6385-2016, 2016\n\nA distal 140â¯kyr sediment record of Nile discharge and East African monsoon variability\n\nWerner Ehrmann, Gerhard Schmiedl, Martin Seidel, Stefan KrÃ¼ger, and Hartmut Schulz\n\nClim.

Yousavich, Annie Bourbonnais, Frank WenzhÃ¶fer, Felix Janssen, Tina Treude, and David L. Valentine\n\nBiogeosciences, 21, 3041–3052, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-21-3041-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-21-3041-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nBiologically available (fixed) nitrogen (N) is a limiting nutrient for life in the ocean. Under low-oxygen conditions, fixed N is either removed via denitrification or retained via dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonia (DNRA). Using in situ incubations in the Santa Barbara Basin, which undergoes seasonal anoxia, we found that benthic denitrification was the dominant nitrate reduction process, while nitrate availability and organic carbon content control the relative importance of DNRA.\n\nPotential impacts of cable bacteria activity on hard-shelled benthic foraminifera: implications for their interpretation as bioindicators or paleoproxies\n\nMaxime Daviray, Emmanuelle Geslin, Nils Risgaard-Petersen, Vincent V.

We studied the sediment acidifcation effect on benthic calcareous foraminifera in intertidal mudflats. The strong pH decrease in sediments probably caused by cable bacteria led to calcareous test dissolution of living and dead foraminifera, threatening the test preservation and their robustness as environmental proxies.\n\nEvidence of cryptic methane cycling and non-methanogenic methylamine consumption in the sulfate-reducing zone of sediment in the Santa Barbara Basin, California\n\nSebastian J.

Here we present new data from organic-rich surface sediments below an oxygen minimum zone off the coast of California (Santa Barbara Basin) demonstrating the simultaneous microbial production and consumption of methane, which appears to be an important process preventing the build-up of methane in these sediments and the emission into the water column and atmosphere.\n\nAssessing global-scale organic matter reactivity patterns in marine sediments using a lognormal reactive continuum model\n\nSinan Xu, Bo Liu, Sandra Arndt, Sabine Kasten, and Zijun Wu\n\nBiogeosciences, 20, 2251–2263, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-20-2251-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-20-2251-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe use a reactive continuum model based on a lognormal distribution (l-RCM) to inversely determine model parameters μ and σ at 123 sites across the global ocean. Our results show organic matter (OM) reactivity is more than 3 orders of magnitude higher in shelf than in abyssal regions. In addition, OM reactivity is higher than predicted in some specific regions, yet the l-RCM can still capture OM reactivity features in these regions.\n\nDeposit-feeding of Nonionellina labradorica (foraminifera) from an Arctic methane seep site and possible association with a methanotroph\n\nChristiane Schmidt, Emmanuelle Geslin, Joan M.

We carried out a feeding experiment with a marine methanotroph to examine the ultrastructure of the cell and degradation vacuoles using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The results revealed three putative methanotrophs at the outside of the cell/test, which could be taken up via non-targeted grazing in seeps or our experiment.\n\nBenthic silicon cycling in the Arctic Barents Sea: a reactionâtransport model study\n\nJames P.

In our model study, we disentangle major controls on the seafloor Si cycle to better anticipate the impacts of continued warming and sea ice melt in the Barents Sea. We uncover a coupling of the iron redox and Si cycles, dissolution of lithogenic silicates, and authigenic clay formation, comprising a Si sink that could have implications for the Arctic Ocean Si budget.\n\nLong-term incubations provide insight into the mechanisms of anaerobic oxidation of methane in methanogenic lake sediments\n\nHanni Vigderovich, Werner Eckert, Michal Elul, Maxim Rubin-Blum, Marcus Elvert, and Orit Sivan\n\nBiogeosciences, 19, 2313–2331, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-19-2313-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-19-2313-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAnaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) is one of the major processes limiting the release of the greenhouse gas methane from natural environments. Here we show that significant AOM exists in the methane zone of lake sediments in natural conditions and even after long-term (ca. 18 months) anaerobic slurry incubations with two stages. Methanogens were most likely responsible for oxidizing the methane, and humic substances and iron oxides are likely electron acceptors to support this oxidation.\n\nIdeas and perspectives: Sea-level change, anaerobic methane oxidation, and the glacialâinterglacial phosphorus cycle\n\nBjorn Sundby, Pierre Anschutz, Pascal Lecroart, and Alfonso Mucci\n\nBiogeosciences, 19, 1421–1434, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-19-1421-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-19-1421-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nA glacial–interglacial methane-fuelled redistribution of reactive phosphorus between the oceanic and sedimentary phosphorus reservoirs can occur in the ocean when falling sea level lowers the pressure on the seafloor, destabilizes methane hydrates, and triggers the dissolution of P-bearing iron oxides. The mass of phosphate potentially mobilizable from the sediment is similar to the size of the current oceanic reservoir. Hence, this process may play a major role in the marine phosphorus cycle.\n\nEstimation of the natural background of phosphate in a lowland river using tidal marsh sediment cores\n\nFlorian Lauryssen, Philippe CrombÃ©, Tom Maris, Elliot Van Maldegem, Marijn Van de Broek, Stijn Temmerman, and Erik Smolders\n\nBiogeosciences, 19, 763–776, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-19-763-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-19-763-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nSurface waters in lowland regions have a poor surface water quality, mainly due to excess nutrients like phosphate. Therefore, we wanted to know the phosphate levels without humans, also called the pre-industrial background. Phosphate binds strongly to sediment particles, suspended in the river water. In this research we used sediments deposited by a river as an archive for surface water phosphate back to 1800 CE. Pre-industrial phosphate levels were estimated at one-third of the modern levels.\n\nGeochemical consequences of oxygen diffusion from the oceanic crust into overlying sediments and its significance for biogeochemical cycles based on sediments of the northeast Pacific\n\nGerard J. M. Versteegh, Andrea Koschinsky, Thomas Kuhn, Inken Preuss, and Sabine Kasten\n\nBiogeosciences, 18, 4965–4984, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-18-4965-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-18-4965-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nOxygen penetrates sediments not only from the ocean bottom waters but also from the basement. The impact of the latter is poorly understood. We show that this basement oxygen has a clear impact on the nitrogen cycle, the redox state, and the distribution of manganese, nickel cobalt and organic matter in the sediments. This is important for (1) global biogeochemical cycles, (2) understanding sedimentary life and (3) the interpretation of the sediment record to reconstruct the past.\n\nCarbon sources of benthic fauna in temperate lakes across multiple trophic states\n\nAnnika Fiskal, Eva Anthamatten, Longhui Deng, Xingguo Han, Lorenzo Lagostina, Anja Michel, Rong Zhu, Nathalie Dubois, Carsten J. Schubert, Stefano M. Bernasconi, and Mark A. Lever\n\nBiogeosciences, 18, 4369–4388, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-18-4369-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-18-4369-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nMicrobially produced methane can serve as a carbon source for freshwater macrofauna most likely through grazing on methane-oxidizing bacteria. This study investigates the contributions of different carbon sources to macrofaunal biomass. Our data suggest that the average contribution of methane-derived carbon is similar between different fauna but overall remains low. This is further supported by the low abundance of methane-cycling microorganisms.\n\nDeep-water inflow event increases sedimentary phosphorus release on a multi-year scale\n\nAstrid HylÃ©n, Sebastiaan J. van de Velde, Mikhail Kononets, Mingyue Luo, Elin Almroth-Rosell, and Per O. J. Hall\n\nBiogeosciences, 18, 2981–3004, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-18-2981-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-18-2981-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nSediments in oxygen-depleted ocean areas release high amounts of phosphorus, feeding algae that consume oxygen upon degradation, leading to further phosphorus release. Oxygenation is thought to trap phosphorus in the sediment and break this feedback. We studied the sediment phosphorus cycle in a previously anoxic area after an inflow of oxic water. Surprisingly, the sediment phosphorus release increased, showing that feedbacks between phosphorus release and oxygen depletion can be hard to break.\n\nBioturbation has a limited effect on phosphorus burial in salt marsh sediments\n\nSebastiaan J. van de Velde, Rebecca K. James, Ine Callebaut, Silvia Hidalgo-Martinez, and Filip J. R. Meysman\n\nBiogeosciences, 18, 1451–1461, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-18-1451-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-18-1451-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nSome 540 Myr ago, animal life evolved in the ocean. Previous research suggested that when these early animals started inhabiting the seafloor, they retained phosphorus in the seafloor, thereby limiting photosynthesis in the ocean. We studied salt marsh sediments with and without animals and found that their impact on phosphorus retention is limited, which implies that their impact on the global environment might have been less drastic than previously assumed.\n\nBiogeochemical impact of cable bacteria on coastal Black Sea sediment\n\nMartijn Hermans, Nils Risgaard-Petersen, Filip J. R. Meysman, and Caroline P. Slomp\n\nBiogeosciences, 17, 5919–5938, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-17-5919-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-17-5919-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis paper demonstrates that the recently discovered cable bacteria are capable of using a mineral, known as siderite, as a source for the formation of iron oxides. This work also demonstrates that the activity of cable bacteria can lead to a distinct subsurface layer in the sediment that can be used as a marker for their activity.\n\nOrganic carbon characteristics in ice-rich permafrost in alas and Yedoma deposits, central Yakutia, Siberia\n\nTorben Windirsch, Guido Grosse, Mathias Ulrich, Lutz Schirrmeister, Alexander N. Fedorov, Pavel Y. Konstantinov, Matthias Fuchs, Loeka L. Jongejans, Juliane Wolter, Thomas Opel, and Jens Strauss\n\nBiogeosciences, 17, 3797–3814, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-17-3797-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-17-3797-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nTo extend the knowledge on circumpolar deep permafrost carbon storage, we examined two deep permafrost deposit types (Yedoma and alas) in central Yakutia. We found little but partially undecomposed organic carbon as a result of largely changing sedimentation processes. The carbon stock of the examined Yedoma deposits is about 50 % lower than the general Yedoma domain mean, implying a very hetererogeneous Yedoma composition, while the alas is approximately 80 % below the thermokarst deposit mean.\n\nThe control of hydrogen sulfide on benthic iron and cadmium fluxes in the oxygen minimum zone off Peru\n\nAnna Plass, Christian Schlosser, Stefan Sommer, Andrew W. Dale, Eric P. Achterberg, and Florian Scholz\n\nBiogeosciences, 17, 3685–3704, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-17-3685-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-17-3685-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe compare the cycling of Fe and Cd in sulfidic sediments of the Peruvian oxygen minimum zone. Due to the contrasting solubility of their sulfide minerals, the sedimentary Fe release and Cd burial fluxes covary with spatial and temporal distributions of H2S. Depending on the solubility of their sulfide minerals, sedimentary trace metal fluxes will respond differently to ocean deoxygenation/expansion of H2S concentrations, which may change trace metal stoichiometry of upwelling water masses.\n\nQuantity and distribution of methane entrapped in sediments of calcareous, Alpine glacier forefields\n\nBiqing Zhu, Manuel KÃ¼bler, Melanie Ridoli, Daniel Breitenstein, and Martin H. Schroth\n\nBiogeosciences, 17, 3613–3630, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-17-3613-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-17-3613-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe provide evidence that the greenhouse gas methane (CH4) is enclosed in calcareous glacier-forefield sediments across Switzerland. Geochemical analyses confirmed that this ancient CH4 has its origin in the calcareous parent bedrock. Our estimate of the total quantity of CH4 enclosed in sediments across Switzerland indicates a large CH4 mass (~105 t CH4). We produced evidence that CH4 is stable in its enclosed state, but additional experiments are needed to elucidate its long-term fate.\n\nAssessing the potential for non-turbulent methane escape from the East Siberian Arctic Shelf\n\nMatteo Puglini, Victor Brovkin, Pierre Regnier, and Sandra Arndt\n\nBiogeosciences, 17, 3247–3275, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-17-3247-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-17-3247-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nA reaction-transport model to assess the potential non-turbulent methane flux from the East Siberian Arctic sediments to water columns is applied here. We show that anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) is an efficient filter except for high values of sedimentation rate and advective flow, which enable considerable non-turbulent steady-state methane fluxes. Significant transient methane fluxes can also occur during the building-up phase of the AOM-performing biomass microbial community.\n\nVertical transport of sediment-associated metals and cyanobacteria by ebullition in a stratified lake\n\nKyle Delwiche, Junyao Gu, Harold Hemond, and Sarah P. Preheim\n\nBiogeosciences, 17, 3135–3147, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-17-3135-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-17-3135-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn this study, we investigate whether bubbles transport sediments containing arsenic and cyanobacteria from the bottom to the top of a polluted lake. We measured arsenic and cyanobacteria from bubble traps in the lake and from an experimental bubble column in the laboratory. We found that bubble transport was not an important source of arsenic in the surface waters but that bubbles could transport enough cyanobacteria to the surface to exacerbate harmful algal blooms.\n\nEvidence of changes in sedimentation rate and sediment fabric in a low-oxygen setting: Santa Monica Basin, CA\n\nNathaniel Kemnitz, William M. Berelson, Douglas E. Hammond, Laura Morine, Maria Figueroa, Timothy W. Lyons, Simon Scharf, Nick Rollins, Elizabeth Petsios, Sydnie Lemieux, and Tina Treude\n\nBiogeosciences, 17, 2381–2396, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-17-2381-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-17-2381-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nOur paper shows how sedimentation in a very low oxygen setting provides a unique record of environmental change. We look at the past 250 years through the filter of sediment accumulation via radioisotope dating and other physical and chemical analyses of these sediments. We conclude, remarkably, that there has been very little change in net sediment mass accumulation through the past 100–150 years, yet just prior to 1900â CE, sediments were accumulating at 50 %–70 % of today's rate.\n\nAuthigenic formation of CaâMg carbonates in the shallow alkaline Lake Neusiedl, Austria\n\nDario Fussmann, Avril Jean Elisabeth von Hoyningen-Huene, Andreas Reimer, Dominik Schneider, Hana BabkovÃ¡, Robert Peticzka, Andreas Maier, Gernot Arp, Rolf Daniel, and Patrick Meister\n\nBiogeosciences, 17, 2085–2106, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-17-2085-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-17-2085-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nDolomite (CaMg(CO3)2) is supersaturated in many aquatic settings (e.g., seawater) on modern Earth but does not precipitate directly from the fluid, a fact known as the dolomite problem. The widely acknowledged concept of dolomite precipitation involves microbial extracellular polymeric substances (EPSs) and anoxic conditions as important drivers. In contrast, results from Lake Neusiedl support an alternative concept of Ca–Mg carbonate precipitation under aerobic and alkaline conditions.\n\nVivianite formation in ferruginous sediments from Lake Towuti, Indonesia\n\nAurÃ¨le Vuillemin, AndrÃ© Friese, Richard Wirth, Jan A. Schuessler, Anja M. Schleicher, Helga Kemnitz, Andreas LÃ¼cke, Kohen W. Bauer, Sulung Nomosatryo, Friedhelm von Blanckenburg, Rachel Simister, Luis G. OrdoÃ±ez, Daniel Ariztegui, Cynthia Henny, James M. Russell, Satria Bijaksana, Hendrik Vogel, Sean A. Crowe, Jens Kallmeyer, and the Towuti Drilling Project Science team\n\nBiogeosciences, 17, 1955–1973, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-17-1955-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-17-1955-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nFerruginous lakes experience restricted primary production due to phosphorus trapping by ferric iron oxides under oxic conditions. We report the presence of large crystals of vivianite, a ferrous iron phosphate, in sediments from Lake Towuti, Indonesia. We address processes of P retention linked to diagenesis of iron phases. Vivianite crystals had light Fe2+ isotope signatures and contained mineral inclusions consistent with antecedent processes of microbial sulfate and iron reduction.\n\nImpact of ambient conditions on the Si isotope fractionation in marine pore fluids during early diagenesis\n\nSonja Geilert, Patricia Grasse, Kristin Doering, Klaus Wallmann, Claudia Ehlert, Florian Scholz, Martin Frank, Mark Schmidt, and Christian Hensen\n\nBiogeosciences, 17, 1745–1763, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-17-1745-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-17-1745-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nMarine silicate weathering is a key process of the marine silica cycle; however, its controlling processes are not well understood. In the Guaymas Basin, silicate weathering has been studied under markedly differing ambient conditions. Environmental settings like redox conditions or terrigenous input of reactive silicates appear to be major factors controlling marine silicate weathering. These factors need to be taken into account in future oceanic mass balances of Si and in modeling studies.\n\nImpact of small-scale disturbances on geochemical conditions, biogeochemical processes and element fluxes in surface sediments of the eastern ClarionâClipperton Zone, Pacific Ocean\n\nJessica B. Volz, Laura Haffert, Matthias Haeckel, Andrea Koschinsky, and Sabine Kasten\n\nBiogeosciences, 17, 1113–1131, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-17-1113-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-17-1113-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nPotential future deep-sea mining of polymetallic nodules at the seafloor is expected to severely harm the marine environment. However, the consequences on deep-sea ecosystems are still poorly understood. This study on surface sediments from man-made disturbance tracks in the Pacific Ocean shows that due to the removal of the uppermost sediment layer and thereby the loss of organic matter, the geochemical system in the sediments is disturbed for millennia before reaching a new equilibrium.\n\nAcetate turnover and methanogenic pathways in Amazonian lake sediments\n\nRalf Conrad, Melanie Klose, and Alex Enrich-Prast\n\nBiogeosciences, 17, 1063–1069, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-17-1063-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-17-1063-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nLake sediments release the greenhouse gas CH4. Acetate is an important precursor. Although Amazonian lake sediments all contained acetate-consuming methanogens, measurement of the turnover of labeled acetate showed that some sediments converted acetate not to CH4 plus CO2, as expected, but only to CO2. Our results indicate the operation of acetate-oxidizing microorganisms couples the oxidation process to syntrophic methanogenic partners and/or to the reduction of organic compounds.\n\nBenthic alkalinity and dissolved inorganic carbon fluxes in the RhÃ´ne River prodelta generated by decoupled aerobic and anaerobic processes\n\nJens Rassmann, Eryn M. Eitel, Bruno Lansard, CÃ©cile Cathalot, Christophe Brandily, Martial Taillefert, and Christophe Rabouille\n\nBiogeosciences, 17, 13–33, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-17-13-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-17-13-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn this paper, we use a large set of measurements made using in situ and lab techniques to elucidate the cause of dissolved inorganic carbon fluxes in sediments from the RhÃ´ne delta and its companion compound alkalinity, which carries the absorption capacity of coastal waters with respect to atmospheric CO2. We show that sediment processes (sulfate reduction, FeS precipitation and accumulation) are crucial in generating the alkalinity fluxes observed in this study by in situ incubation chambers.\n\nSmall-scale heterogeneity of trace metals including rare earth elements and yttrium in deep-sea sediments and porewaters of the Peru Basin, southeastern equatorial Pacific\n\nSophie A. L. Paul, Matthias Haeckel, Michael Bau, Rajina Bajracharya, and Andrea Koschinsky\n\nBiogeosciences, 16, 4829–4849, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-16-4829-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-16-4829-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe studied the upper 10 m of deep-sea sediments, including pore water, in the Peru Basin to understand small-scale variability of trace metals. Our results show high spatial variability related to topographical variations, which in turn impact organic matter contents, degradation processes, and trace metal cycling. Another interesting finding was the influence of dissolving buried nodules on the surrounding sediment and trace metal cycling.\n\nOrganic matter contents and degradation in a highly trawled area during fresh particle inputs (Gulf of Castellammare, southwestern Mediterranean)\n\nSarah Paradis, Antonio Pusceddu, Pere MasquÃ©, Pere Puig, Davide Moccia, Tommaso Russo, and Claudio Lo Iacono\n\nBiogeosciences, 16, 4307–4320, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-16-4307-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-16-4307-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nChronic deep bottom trawling in the Gulf of Castellammare (SW Mediterranean) erodes large volumes of sediment, exposing over-century-old sediment depleted in organic matter. Nevertheless, the arrival of fresh and nutritious sediment recovers superficial organic matter in trawling grounds and leads to high turnover rates, partially and temporarily mitigating the impacts of bottom trawling. However, this deposition is ephemeral and it will be swiftly eroded by the passage of the next trawler.\n\nIdentifying the core bacterial microbiome of hydrocarbon degradation and a shift of dominant methanogenesis pathways in the oil and aqueous phases of petroleum reservoirs of different temperatures from China\n\nZhichao Zhou, Bo Liang, Li-Ying Wang, Jin-Feng Liu, Bo-Zhong Mu, Hojae Shim, and Ji-Dong Gu\n\nBiogeosciences, 16, 4229–4241, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-16-4229-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-16-4229-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis study shows a core bacterial microbiome with a small proportion of shared operational taxonomic units of common sequences among all oil reservoirs. Dominant methanogenesis shifts from the hydrogenotrophic pathway in water phase to the acetoclastic pathway in the oil phase at high temperatures, but the opposite is true at low temperatures. There are also major functional metabolism differences between the two phases for amino acids, hydrocarbons, and carbohydrates.\n\nEffects of eutrophication on sedimentary organic carbon cycling in five temperate lakes\n\nAnnika Fiskal, Longhui Deng, Anja Michel, Philip Eickenbusch, Xingguo Han, Lorenzo Lagostina, Rong Zhu, Michael Sander, Martin H. Schroth, Stefano M. Bernasconi, Nathalie Dubois, and Mark A. Lever\n\nBiogeosciences, 16, 3725–3746, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-16-3725-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-16-3725-2019, 2019\n\nEvidence for microbial iron reduction in the methanic sediments of the oligotrophic southeastern Mediterranean continental shelf\n\nHanni Vigderovich, Lewen Liang, Barak Herut, Fengping Wang, Eyal Wurgaft, Maxim Rubin-Blum, and Orit Sivan\n\nBiogeosciences, 16, 3165–3181, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-16-3165-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-16-3165-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nMicrobial iron reduction participates in important biogeochemical cycles. In the last decade iron reduction has been observed in many aquatic sediments below its classical zone, in the methane production zone, suggesting a link between the two cycles. Here we present evidence for microbial iron reduction in the methanogenic depth of the oligotrophic SE Mediterranean continental shelf using mainly geochemical and microbial sedimentary profiles and suggest possible mechanisms for this process.\n\nFracture-controlled fluid transport supports microbial methane-oxidizing communities at Vestnesa Ridge\n\nHaoyi Yao, Wei-Li Hong, Giuliana Panieri, Simone Sauer, Marta E. Torres, Moritz F. Lehmann, Friederike GrÃ¼ndger, and Helge Niemann\n\nBiogeosciences, 16, 2221–2232, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-16-2221-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-16-2221-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nHow methane is transported in the sediment is important for the microbial community living on methane. Here we report an observation of a mini-fracture that facilitates the advective gas transport of methane in the sediment, compared to the diffusive fluid transport without a fracture. We found contrasting bio-geochemical signals in these different transport modes. This finding can help to fill the gap in the fracture network system in modulating methane dynamics in surface sediments.\n\nHydrothermal alteration of aragonitic biocarbonates: assessment of micro- and nanostructural dissolutionâreprecipitation and constraints of diagenetic overprint from quantitative statistical grain-area analysis\n\nLaura A. Casella, Sixin He, Erika Griesshaber, Lourdes FernÃ¡ndez-DÃ­az, Martina Greiner, Elizabeth M. Harper, Daniel J. Jackson, Andreas Ziegler, Vasileios Mavromatis, Martin Dietzel, Anton Eisenhauer, Sabino Veintemillas-Verdaguer, Uwe Brand, and Wolfgang W. Schmahl\n\nBiogeosciences, 15, 7451–7484, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-15-7451-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-15-7451-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nBiogenic carbonates record past environmental conditions. Fossil shell chemistry and microstructure change as metastable biogenic carbonates are replaced by inorganic calcite. Simulated diagenetic alteration at 175 Â°C of different shell microstructures showed that (nacreous) shell aragonite and calcite were partially replaced by coarse inorganic calcite crystals due to dissolution–reprecipitation reactions. EBSD maps allowed for qualitative assessment of the degree of diagenetic overprint.\n\nLarge variations in iron input to an oligotrophic Baltic Sea estuary: impact on sedimentary phosphorus burial\n\nWytze K. Lenstra, Matthias Egger, Niels A. G. M. van Helmond, Emma Kritzberg, Daniel J. Conley, and Caroline P. Slomp\n\nBiogeosciences, 15, 6979–6996, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-15-6979-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-15-6979-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe show that burial rates of phosphorus (P) in an estuary in the northern Baltic Sea are very high. We demonstrate that at high sedimentation rates, P retention in the sediment is related to the formation of vivianite. With a reactive transport model, we assess the sensitivity of sedimentary vivianite formation. We suggest that enrichments of iron and P in the sediment are linked to periods of enhanced riverine input of Fe, which subsequently strongly enhances P burial in coastal sediments.\n\nVivianite formation in methane-rich deep-sea sediments from the South China Sea\n\nJiarui Liu, Gareth Izon, Jiasheng Wang, Gilad Antler, Zhou Wang, Jie Zhao, and Matthias Egger\n\nBiogeosciences, 15, 6329–6348, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-15-6329-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-15-6329-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nOur work provides new insights into the biogeochemical cycling of iron, methane and phosphorus. We found that vivianite, an iron-phosphate mineral, is pervasive in methane-rich sediments, suggesting that iron reduction at depth is coupled to phosphorus and methane cycling on a much greater spatial scale than previously assumed. Acting as an important burial mechanism for iron and phosphorus, vivianite authigenesis may be an under-considered process in both modern and ancient settings alike.\n\nBenthic archaea as potential sources of tetraether membrane lipids in sediments across an oxygen minimum zone\n\nMarc A. Besseling, Ellen C. Hopmans, R. Christine Boschman, Jaap S. Sinninghe DamstÃ©, and Laura Villanueva\n\nBiogeosciences, 15, 4047–4064, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-15-4047-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-15-4047-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nBenthic archaea comprise a significant part of the total prokaryotic biomass in marine sediments. Here, we compared the archaeal diversity and intact polar lipid (IPL) composition in both surface and subsurface sediments with different oxygen regimes in the Arabian Sea oxygen minimum zone. The oxygenated sediments were dominated by Thaumarchaeota and IPL-GDGT-0. The anoxic sediment contained highly diverse archaeal communities and high relative abundances of IPL-GDGT-1 to -4.\n\nCarbon amendment stimulates benthic nitrogen cycling during the bioremediation of particulate aquaculture waste\n\nGeorgina Robinson, Thomas MacTavish, Candida Savage, Gary S. Caldwell, Clifford L. W. Jones, Trevor Probyn, Bradley D. Eyre, and Selina M. Stead\n\nBiogeosciences, 15, 1863–1878, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-15-1863-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-15-1863-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis study examined the effect of adding carbon to a sediment-based effluent treatment system to treat nitrogen-rich aquaculture waste. The research was conducted in incubation chambers to measure the exchange of gases and nutrients across the sediment–water interface and examine changes in the sediment microbial community. Adding carbon increased the amount of nitrogen retained in the treatment system, thereby reducing the levels of nitrogen needing to be discharged to the environment.\n\nModelling biogeochemical processes in sediments from the north-western Adriatic Sea: response to enhanced particulate organic carbon fluxes\n\nDaniele Brigolin, Christophe Rabouille, Bruno Bombled, Silvia Colla, Salvatrice Vizzini, Roberto Pastres, and Fabio Pranovi\n\nBiogeosciences, 15, 1347–1366, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-15-1347-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-15-1347-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe present the result of a study carried out in the north-western Adriatic Sea by combining two different types of models with field sampling. A mussel farm was taken as a local source of perturbation to the natural flux of particulate organic carbon to the sediment. Differences in fluxes were primarily associated with mussel physiological conditions. Although restricted, these changes in particulate organic carbon fluxes induced visible effects on sediment biogeochemistry.\n\nCarbon mineralization in Laptev and East Siberian sea shelf and slope sediment\n\nVolker BrÃ¼chert, Lisa BrÃ¶der, Joanna E. Sawicka, Tommaso Tesi, Samantha P. Joye, Xiaole Sun, Igor P. Semiletov, and Vladimir A. Samarkin\n\nBiogeosciences, 15, 471–490, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-15-471-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-15-471-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe determined the aerobic and anaerobic degradation rates of land- and marine-derived organic material in East Siberian shelf sediment. Marine plankton-derived organic carbon was the main source for the oxic dissolved carbon dioxide production, whereas terrestrial organic material significantly contributed to the production of carbon dioxide under anoxic conditions. Our direct degradation rate measurements provide new constraints for the present-day Arctic marine carbon budget.\n\nReviews and syntheses: to the bottom of carbon processing at the seafloor\n\nJack J. Middelburg\n\nBiogeosciences, 15, 413–427, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-15-413-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-15-413-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nOrganic carbon processing at the seafloor is studied by geologists to better understand the sedimentary record, by biogeochemists to quantify burial and respiration, by organic geochemists to elucidate compositional changes, and by ecologists to follow carbon transfers within food webs. These disciplinary approaches have their strengths and weaknesses. This award talk provides a synthesis, highlights the role of animals in sediment carbon processing and presents some new concepts.\n\nScotland's forgotten carbon: a national assessment of mid-latitude fjord sedimentary carbon stocks\n\nCraig Smeaton, William E. N. Austin, Althea L. Davies, Agnes Baltzer, John A. Howe, and John M. Baxter\n\nBiogeosciences, 14, 5663–5674, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-14-5663-2017,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-14-5663-2017, 2017\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nFjord sediments are recognised as hotspots for the burial and long-term storage of carbon. In this study, we use the Scottish fjords as a natural laboratory. Using geophysical and geochemical analysis in combination with upscaling techniques, we have generated the first full national sedimentary C inventory for a fjordic system. The results indicate that the Scottish fjords on a like-for-like basis are more effective as C stores than their terrestrial counterparts, including Scottish peatlands.\n\nDoes denitrification occur within porous carbonate sand grains?\n\nPerran Louis Miall Cook, Adam John Kessler, and Bradley David Eyre\n\nBiogeosciences, 14, 4061–4069, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-14-4061-2017,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-14-4061-2017, 2017\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nNitrogen is the key nutrient that typically limits productivity in coastal waters. One of the key controls on the amount of bioavailable nitrogen is the process of denitrification, which converts nitrate (bioavailable) into nitrogen gas. Previous studies suggest high rates of denitrification may take place within carbonate sediments, and one explanation for this is that this process may take place within the sand grains. Here we show evidence to support this hypothesis.\n\nSediment phosphorus speciation and mobility under dynamic redox conditions\n\nChris T. Parsons, Fereidoun Rezanezhad, David W. O'Connell, and Philippe Van Cappellen\n\nBiogeosciences, 14, 3585–3602, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-14-3585-2017,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-14-3585-2017, 2017\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nPhosphorus (P) has accumulated in sediments due to past human activities. The re-release of this P to water contributes to the growth of harmful algal blooms. Our research improves our mechanistic understanding of how P is partitioned between different chemical forms and between sediment and water under dynamic conditions. We demonstrate that P trapped within iron minerals may be less mobile during anoxic conditions than previously thought due to reversible changes to P forms within sediment.\n\nPore water geochemistry along continental slopes north of the East Siberian Sea: inference of low methane concentrations\n\nClint M. Miller, Gerald R. Dickens, Martin Jakobsson, Carina Johansson, Andrey Koshurnikov, Matt O'Regan, Francesco Muschitiello, Christian Stranne, and Carl-Magnus MÃ¶rth\n\nBiogeosciences, 14, 2929–2953, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-14-2929-2017,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-14-2929-2017, 2017\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nContinental slopes north of the East Siberian Sea are assumed to hold large amounts of methane. We present pore water chemistry from the 2014 SWERUS-C3 expedition. These are among the first results generated from this vast climatically sensitive region, and they imply that abundant methane, including gas hydrates, do not characterize the East Siberian Sea slope or rise. This contradicts previous modeling and discussions, which due to the lack of data are almost entirely based assumption.\n\nExperimental diagenesis: insights into aragonite to calcite transformation of Arctica islandica shells by hydrothermal treatment\n\nLaura A. Casella, Erika Griesshaber, Xiaofei Yin, Andreas Ziegler, Vasileios Mavromatis, Dirk MÃ¼ller, Ann-Christine Ritter, Dorothee Hippler, Elizabeth M. Harper, Martin Dietzel, Adrian Immenhauser, Bernd R. SchÃ¶ne, Lucia Angiolini, and Wolfgang W. Schmahl\n\nBiogeosciences, 14, 1461–1492, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-14-1461-2017,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-14-1461-2017, 2017\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nMollusc shells record past environments. Fossil shell chemistry and microstructure change as metastable biogenic aragonite transforms to stable geogenic calcite. We simulated this alteration of Arctica islandica shells by hydrothermal treatments. Below 175 Â°C the shell aragonite survived for weeks. At 175 Â°C the replacement of the original material starts after 4 days and yields submillimetre-sized calcites preserving the macroscopic morphology as well as the original internal micromorphology.\n\nManganese and iron reduction dominate organic carbon oxidation in surface sediments of the deep Ulleung Basin, East Sea\n\nJung-Ho Hyun, Sung-Han Kim, Jin-Sook Mok, Hyeyoun Cho, Tongsup Lee, Verona Vandieken, and Bo Thamdrup\n\nBiogeosciences, 14, 941–958, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-14-941-2017,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-14-941-2017, 2017\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe surface sediments of the Ulleung Basin (UB) in the East Sea are characterized by high organic carbon contents (> 2.5 %, dry wt.) and very high concentrations of Mn oxides (> 200 Î¼mol cm−3) and Fe oxides (up to 100 Î¼mol cm−3). For the first time in deep offshore sediments on the Asian margin with water depth over 2000 m, we report that Mn reduction and Fe reduction were the dominant organic carbon (Corg) oxidation pathways, comprising 45 % and 20 % of total Corg oxidation, respectively.\n\nCarbonate chemistry in sediment porewaters of the RhÃ´ne River delta driven by early diagenesis (northwestern Mediterranean)\n\nJens Rassmann, Bruno Lansard, Lara Pozzato, and Christophe Rabouille\n\nBiogeosciences, 13, 5379–5394, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-13-5379-2016,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-13-5379-2016, 2016\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn situ O2 and pH measurements as well as determination of porewater concentrations of dissolved inorganic carbon, total alkalinity, sulfate and calcium have been measured in the sediments of the RhÃ´ne prodelta. Biogeochemical activity decreased with distance from the river mouth. Oxic processes decreased the carbonate saturation state (Î©) by lowering pH, whereas anaerobic organic matter degradation, dominated by sulfate reduction, was accompanied by increasing Î© and carbonate precipitation.\n\nAnaerobic oxidation of methane alters sediment records of sulfur, iron and phosphorus in the Black Sea\n\nMatthias Egger, Peter Kraal, Tom Jilbert, Fatimah Sulu-Gambari, CÃ©lia J. Sapart, Thomas RÃ¶ckmann, and Caroline P. Slomp\n\nBiogeosciences, 13, 5333–5355, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-13-5333-2016,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-13-5333-2016, 2016\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nBy combining detailed geochemical analyses with diagenetic modeling, we provide new insights into how methane dynamics may strongly overprint burial records of iron, sulfur and phosphorus in marine systems subject to changes in organic matter loading or water column salinity. A better understanding of these processes will improve our ability to read ancient sediment records and thus to predict the potential consequences of global warming and human-enhanced inputs of nutrients to the ocean.\n\nModerate topsoil erosion rates constrain the magnitude of the erosion-induced carbon sink and agricultural productivity losses on the Chinese Loess Plateau\n\nJianlin Zhao, Kristof Van Oost, Longqian Chen, and Gerard Govers\n\nBiogeosciences, 13, 4735–4750, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-13-4735-2016,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-13-4735-2016, 2016\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe used a novel approach to reassess erosion rates on the CLP. We found that both current average topsoil erosion rates and the maximum magnitude of the erosion-induced carbon sink are overestimated on the CLP. Although average topsoil losses on the CLP are still high, a major increase in agricultural productivity occurred since 1980. Hence, erosion is currently not a direct threat to agricultural productivity on the CLP but the long-term effects of erosion on soil quality remain important.\n\nMassive asphalt deposits, oil seepage, and gas venting support abundant chemosynthetic communities at the Campeche Knolls, southern Gulf of Mexico\n\nHeiko Sahling, Christian Borowski, Elva Escobar-Briones, Adriana GaytÃ¡n-Caballero, Chieh-Wei Hsu, Markus Loher, Ian MacDonald, Yann Marcon, Thomas Pape, Miriam RÃ¶mer, Maxim Rubin-Blum, Florence Schubotz, Daniel Smrzka, Gunter Wegener, and Gerhard Bohrmann\n\nBiogeosciences, 13, 4491–4512, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-13-4491-2016,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-13-4491-2016, 2016\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe were excited about natureâs diversity when we discovered spectacular flows of heavy oil at the seafloor with the remotely operated vehicle QUEST 4000 m in Campeche Bay, southern Gulf of Mexico. Vigorous methane gas bubble emissions lead to massive gas hydrate deposits at water depth as deep as 3420 m. The hydrates formed metre-sized mounds at the seafloor that were densely overgrown by vestimentiferan tubeworms and other seep-typical organisms.\n\nCited articles\n\nAcharya, S. S. and Panigrahi, M.
