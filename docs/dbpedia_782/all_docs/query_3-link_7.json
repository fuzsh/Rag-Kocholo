        "text": "In 1835, Ferdinand Gustav Kühne, a Saxon writer and teacher, estimated that the Germanic realm was inundated with spas and that nowhere else were there as many as in Central Europe. In France there were “only ten springs, in Italy eight, Hungary had twelve, Sweden three, Spain two, England two, in Denmark and in vast Russia there was only one mineral spring of note in each, whereas in German-speaking countries, that is, including Bohemia and Switzerland, 149 facilities claimed to possess healing springs.” Although Kühne's estimate of foreign spas was too low—according to recent studies, the number of spas in England and France was significantly higher—contemporary accounts and recent local studies support his finding that Germans had the most bathing facilities in Europe. Fred Kaspar has isolated ninety-nine spas and mineral springs in Westphalia alone. Beginning in the last third of the eighteenth century, the number of spas and spa goers in particular increased rapidly in the Germanic realm. Only 200 guests came to the Kissingen spa in the summer of 1800, whereas fifty years later there were close to 4,000 and by the turn of the century 15,000 guests proper and more than 20,000 day visitors. Pyrmont, one of the most popular spas in the eighteenth century, started with 1,424 guests proper (not including peasants who were not considered guests proper) reaching 2,800 guests by the middle of the century, and around 19,000 by 1900.\n\n2. Kaspar, Fred, Brunnenkur und Sommerlust: Gesundbrunnen und Kleinbäder in Westpfalen (Bielefeld, 1993), 179–240Google Scholar. On French spas, see MacKaman's, Douglas Peter excellent study, Leisure Settings: Bourgeois Culture, Medicine, and the Spa in Modern France (Chicago, 1998)Google Scholar. MacKaman distinguishes twelve principal spas in nineteenth-century France (ibid., 16), but, as the map on page 14 indicates, the total number of spas must have been significantly higher. Hembry's, Phyllis meticulous studies, The English Spa, 1560–1815: A Social History (London, 1990)Google Scholar and British Spas from 1815 to the Present. A Social History (Madison, 1997)Google Scholar provide a good overview of the English spa system. Hembry argues that “from 1800 to 1850 as many as 70 new British spa centers were established” (Hembry, British Spas, 239). On contemporary accounts see Osann's, EmilPhysikalisch-medicinische Darstellung der bekannten Heilquellen der vorzüglichsten Länder Europas, vol. 1 (Berlin, 1829)Google Scholar, which describes a selection of the best European spas. Flechsig, Robert in his Bäder-Lexikon: Darstellung aller bekannten Bäder, Heilquellen, Wasserheilanstalten und klimatischen Kurorte Europas und des nördlichen Afrikas in medizinischer, topographischer, ökonomischer und finanzieller Beziehung (Leipzig, 1883)Google Scholar wants to offer a complete account of all European and North-African spas and balneological facilities. In Germany, including Austria and Bohemia, Fleschig found 369 spas. Despite Kaspar's study and other important local works, the research on German spas and the use of waters is still in its initial stages. Above all, the question of what counts as a spa has to be established to give even a rough idea of how many spas there were in the Germanic realm in the nineteenth century. I will focus on principal spas whose clientele numbered in the hundreds or even thousands, facilities and environment were well-structured, and administrative practices were well-established.\n\n5. Mehrdorf, Wilhelm, “Geschichte des Bades Pyrmont” in Chronik von Bad Pyrmont (Bad Pyrmont, 1985), 91Google Scholar, lists the leading German spas in 1865 as follows: Pyrmont, with 6,537 guests proper, was the seventh most-visited spa in Germany after Baden-Baden (45,000), Wiesbaden (29,000), Karlsbad (10,000), Ems (8,000), Teplitz (7,000), and Kissingen (7,000). The eighth most popular spa, Schwalbach, had 4,800 visitors. These eight most popular spas alone attracted more than 110,000 guests. Considering the high variability of spa statistic parameters, overlapping visits by the same guests to different spas, varying lengths of stay, and the lack or unreliability of statistics of peasant guests, these figures are hardly accurate. Since several spas included only middle- and upper-class persons with names and titles in their statistics and still allowed peasants to use their facilities, the real number must be higher than 110,000. As known, spa statistics were also unreliable because different criteria determined whether the length of a visit qualified a visitor as a guest proper. Some spas, such as Kissingen, distinguished carefully between visitors (Passanten) and guests proper (Kurgäste), whereas others inflated their statistics by including both as guests proper. Pyrmont was one of these “generous” spas until the early 1860s, when the authors of the Kurliste (list of visitors) started to separate temporary visitors. Within the limits of these variations, spa statistics still show the extent of annual spa visits. We should also note that the smaller spas, and there were hundreds of them in Germany, are not included in this estimate.\n\n10. Apart from the spa guides and manuals, which became increasingly popular during the nineteenth century, reviews of spas and spa seasons provide a rich source of spa information in general and spa schedules in particular. Bertuch's, Friedrich JustinJournal des Luxus und der Moden (Weimar, 1788–1827)Google Scholar published regular reviews on major and sometimes minor German spas. After 1827, Zeitung für die elegante Welt (Leipzig, 1801–1859)Google Scholar became the leading forum for spa discourse. Christoph Wilhelm Hufeland, whose Makrobiotik (1796/1805) was an early precursor of the physical wellness movement, published in 1815 the Praktische Uebersicht der vorzüglichsten Heilquellen Teutschlands nach eignen Erfahrungen (Berlin) which provides excellent insight into the workings of the most popular German spas. Only Fuhs, Burkhard, Mondäne Orte einer vornehmen Gesellschaft: Kultur und Geschichte der Kurstädte 1700–1900 (Hildesheim, 1992)Google Scholar, offers a comprehensive analysis of German spa culture. Good local studies include Kuhnert's, ReinholdUrbanität auf dem Lande: Badereisen nach Pyrmont im 18. Jahrhundert (Göttingen, 1984)Google Scholar, Kaspar's, FredBrunnenkur und Sommerlust: Gesundbrunnen und Kleinbäder in Westphalen (Bielefeld, 1993)Google Scholar, and for an especially useful point of comparison see Sommer's, HermannZur Kur nach Ems: Ein Beitrag zur Geschichte der Badereise von 1830 bis 1914 (Stuttgart, 1999)Google Scholar. Simon, Petra and Behrens's, MargitBadekur und Kurbad: Bauten in deutschen Bädern 1780–1920 (Munich, 1988)Google Scholar describes the spatial design of German spas.\n\n24. The historical importance of emotions is not solely a question of whether an individual or a group carries an emotional characteristic. Emotions are a part of social interaction. The question is this: how were emotions related or, rather, how did emotions relate people to one another? Jon Elster, in his essay on the Alchemies of the Mind, has taken a fresh look at emotions by virtually brushing aside modern psychological theories and reminding that, in premodern Europe, emotions were discussed in a rhetorical context. By returning to Aristotle's Rhetoric, he understands emotions, such as “regret, relief, hope, disappointment, shame, guilt, pridefulness, pride, hubris, envy, jealousy, malice, pity, indignation, wrath, hatred, contempt, joy, grief, and romantic love” as states of mind and body caused or aroused by preceding beliefs ot (normally) other persons and directed toward these persons in such a way that they cause pain and pleasure, Elster, Jon, Alchemies of the Mind: Rationality and the Emotions (Cambridge, 1999), 48, 55–58Google Scholar. Emotions are not passive states of mind but directed at others through the preceding beliefs and the implied action of pleasure and pain. Although some emotions might be more socially relevant than others, all of Aristotle's definitions of emotions include this characteristic of directedness. This observation has significant implication for a historical understanding of emotions. It seems that emotions influence not only our self-awareness of our state, but also how we relate to and interact with others. One's sense of honor and ambition in particular expresses this social dependency clearly: we feel that it is not justified unless recognized by-others, measured against what we assume they consider an appropriate sense of honor or ambition. This seems an important feature of seeing and being seen, the very principle of the spa.\n\n33. Kuhnerts, Urbanität, 53Google Scholar, and Mehrdorf's interpretation that, during the nineteenth century, Pyrmont was transformed into a therapeutic bath for the petty bourgeoisie is not tenable. It seems to be based on a misinterpretation of a comment in the Pyrmonter Zeitung of 19 July 1865, which maintained that the guests were mainly middle class using the spa for therapy; “the nobility of blood and money is not yet significantly represented.” Quoted in Mehrdorf, “Geschichte des Bades Pyrmont,” 101. This obviously refers to the situation by mid-July and the expectation is, naturally, that by the so-called Golden Sunday, the last Sunday of July, the prominent guests would appear, as they usually did.\n\n46. Trepp, , in Sanfte Männlichkeit, 177, 372Google Scholar, discovers in the early nineteenth century a structure of sociability that emerged from a peculiar public sphere designed by women. König's analysis of the frequency of visits to Wildbad near Tübingen reveals a surprisingly high number of independent female visitors; in 1800/1801, women were the majority, and several of them came without a male patron, Kulturgeschichte des Spaziergangs, 192. Cf. also Kaplan, , Making, 125Google Scholar. According to MacKaman, the French spas were strongly geared toward family settings during the early nineteenth century. Arrivals, cures, bonding, pleasures, and departures were carefully orchestrated to please families. Only after the 1860s did the unmarried start to predominate in spa life, MacKaman, , Leisure, 36, 136Google Scholar. In Pyrmont, the family never had the position it assumed in French spas.\n\n65. On the current scholarship, see Emch-Dériaz's, Antoinette “The Non-Naturals Made Easy,” in The Popularization of Medicine, 1650–1850, ed. Porter, Roy (London, 1992), 134–59Google Scholar. She concentrates mainly on Tissot, but provides an excellent conceptualization of classical dietetics. See also Rather, J., “The ‘Six Things Non-Natural’: A Note on the Origins and Fate of a Doctrine and a Phrase,” in Clio Medica 3 (1968): 337–47Google Scholar; Berg, Fredrik, “Hygienens omfattning i äldre tider: Sex res non naturales,” in Lychnos (1962): 91–127Google Scholar. A fairly detailed analysis of the academic teaching of classical dietetics can be found in Eulner, Hans-Heinz, “Die Lehre von der Ernährung im Universitätsunterricht,” in Ernährung und Ernährungslehre im 19. Jahrhundert, ed. Heischkel-Artelt, Edith (Göttingen, 1976), 76–98Google Scholar. Göckenjan, Gerd, Kurieren und Staat machen: Gesundheit und Medizin in der bürgerlichen Welt (Frankfurt am Main, 1985), 74–94Google Scholar, and Lachmund, Jens & Stollberg, Gunnar, Patientenwelten: Krankheit und Medizin vom späten 18. bis zum frühen 20. Jahrhundert im Spiegel von Autobiographien (Opladen, 1995), 37–41, 60–66CrossRefGoogle Scholar, concentrate on the social and political implications of dietetics.\n\n79. Kümmel, Werner Friedrich, “Tafelmusik aus medizin- und musikhistorischer Sicht,” in Ernährung und Ernährmgslehre im 19. Jahrhundert, ed. Heischkel-Artelt, Edith (Göttingen, 1976), esp. 389–91Google Scholar. According to their contract, the musicians of the Pyrmont spa were obliged to provide music for the guests on the boulevard, for theater, concerts, and balls: “besides, the musicians themselves can decide whether they want to play at a lunch or dinner table.” Die Uebernahme der Allee-Musik während der Cursaison in Pyrmont durch das Musik-Korps des Bataillons betr., 29. Januar 1850. Stadtarchiv Bad Pyrmont. C: Zeitraum: 1848–1922. J.II.1: Akten über die Alleemusik, 1848–1852. No. 7. The array of popular music and music-making that furnished the everyday culture of the nineteenth century, from lunch-time music to salon music and Hausmusik is still surprisingly sparsely researched. Kümmel's article is a rare example of how a sensitive and stimulating analysis of a musical genre is made possible by combining fields that for us hardly have any conceptual connection but in the contemporary context were logical and essential, in this case medical dietetics and music. Ballstaedt, Andreas and Widmaier, Tobias have shown in their Salonmusik: Zur Geschichte und Funktion einer bürgerlichen Musikpraxis (Stuttgart, 1989), esp. 56–65, 306Google Scholar, how some of this music-making was incorporated into, and even essentially contributed to, the rise of the music industry, such as the popular enterprises of Johann Strauss and Joseph Lanner in Vienna.\n\n80. Mehrdorf, “Geschichte des Bades Pyrmont,” 231. According to a report of 1834, the instruments were violin, bass, contra-bass, clarinet, and oboe, see Von der Musik, 1829 (1834). Stadtarchiv Bad Pyrmont. Ntr B: 1648–1848. J.II.5. The contract of the conductor and the orchestra stipulated in its §9 that the music on the boulevard especially should be good and use new compositions. See Verträge mit Kapellmeistern und Orchestern No. 1. Zwischen der Fürstl. Waldeckischen Polizei Direction in Pyrmont und den unterzeichneten Mitgliedern der Allée Musik, ist in Gemäss seit seither gnädigsten Resolution vom 30. August 1834 nachstehender Contract abgeschlossen worden. Staatsbad Pyrmont Archiv, Einzelabhandlungen, Nr. 46. We do not know exactly when the spa music started in Pyrmont. It must have been established well before the most popular composer of his time, Georg Philipp Telemann (1681–1767), composed his Pyrmonter Kurwoche in 1734.\n\n81. As a consequence of the change, the two brothers Büchner, prominent local musicians, were about to lose their livelihood, of which they complained, remaining vocal critics of the military orchestra that was hired in 1850. In response to their accusations—see, Eingabe der Gebrüder Büchner u. Söhne an d. Vorstand, die Missverhältnisse zwischen den Musicis während der Saison betr., 17 December 1850. Stadtarchiv Bad Pyrmont. C: Zeitraum: 1848–1922. J.II.1: Akten über die Alleemusik, 1848–1852, No. 19.—the administration bluntly noticed the mediocre level of the previous playing contributing only to “afternoon music (string-music) occasionally as we know by experience, and the results are rather mediocre.” Musikcassen-Verwaltungs-Commissions-Bericht, 6 February 1851. Stadtarchiv Bad Pyrmont. C: Zeitraum: 1848–1922. J.II.1: Akten über die Alleemusik, 1848–1852, No. 22.\n\n92. Bühren, in his Vier Wochen, 165Google Scholar has his main character find the company for a walk to the caves of Dunsthöhle during the morning promenade. We have similar testimonies from the Karlsbad spa: “In the morning people socialize there [by the spring] without any consideration for rank and order. There one can already make arrangements for the afternoon recreation as happened often during my visit. Here, by the spring, the lover of beautiful, wild nature, the indefatigable walker can already make appointments with kindred spirits.” Anon., “Carlsbad und Töplitz,” in Journal des Luxus und der Moden, 11 1798, 628Google Scholar.\n\n122. Sponagel, , Meine viertägigen, 42–69Google Scholar. On the increasing use of a uniform-type of dress by men since the late eighteenth-century, see Purdy, Daniel, The Tyranny of Elegance: Consumer Cosmopolitanism in the Era of Goethe (Baltimore, 1998), 180–216Google Scholar. Purdy's thesis that the years between 1770 and 1820 saw a shift from “the presumption that clothes served primarily as signs of their possessor's identity” to “the idea that clothes were part of an economic and political calculus of production” applies well to the avant-garde of fashion discourse but hardly captures the development of everyday dress culture in such tradition-bound spaces as spas.\n\n130. On dancing, see Fink's, MonikaDer Ball: Eine Kulturgeschichte des Gesellschaftstanzes im 18. und 19. Jahrhundert (Innsbruck, 1996), 59–64Google Scholar and Braun, and Gugerli's, Macht des Tanzes, 274–305Google Scholar, which provide an excellent account of the ambivalent relationship of the bourgeoisie toward court dance during the Wilhelmian era. On public promenading as an art of self-representation, see König's Kulturgeschichte des Spazierganges, 262–68. A glance at France shows that the endurance of feudal structures was not a German peculiarity. William Reddy's excellent analysis of “the rhetoric of honor” in a French bureau during the early nineteenth century depicts how the logic of asymmetric relationships retained its power as the political power of the bourgeoisie increased, Reddy, Invisible Code, 254–58."
