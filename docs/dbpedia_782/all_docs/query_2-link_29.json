Chaired by Caron Tabb. Studio Israel is a partnership among Hadassah-Brandeis Institute, Jewish Arts Collaborative, the Schusterman Center for Israel Studies, and the Vilna Shul, and is made possible by generous support from Combined Jewish Philanthropies.\n\nAbout the Artist\n\nDege Feder is a choreographer, dancer, artistic director, and musician.

Our three speakers will present three case studies evaluating emerging trends and patterns in each trans-urban context. Through qualitative anthropological research centralizing respondents' own lived experiences and worldviews, interactions between Muslims and Jews in each location are studied as a formative part of public discourse.\n\nPerhaps the most visible manifestations of these relations are represented by the ambitious interfaith projects that were recently established in each area. The Abrahamic Family House (UEA), The House of One (GE), and The Community of Conscience (PL) reveal the aspirations of multi-faith religious leaders to overcome polarizing dichotomies and search for common ground. One of the conclusive outcomes of the study is a somewhat diminishing impact of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict on Jewish-Muslim relations; however, the extent differs in each location. The scholars also detected something they did not expect to find: an inclination towards a joint-Muslim-Jewish Middle Eastern identity.

Sarna and Prof. Yehudah Mirsky.\n\nIn the summer of 1942, Rommel's army was a day from Cairo, a week from Tel Aviv. The SS was ready to go into action. The Jews of Palestine expected catastrophe. Espionage brought the Nazis this far - and only espionage could stop them.\n\n\"War of Shadows\" is the epic story of the World War II intrigues that brought Germany's Erwin Rommel to the brink of conquering the Middle East. Years in the making, based on newly discovered documents, this book is a feat of research and storytelling. As in his previous work, Gorenberg strips away myths about Middle East history. War of Shadows debunks the established \"war without hate\" narrative about the battle for North Africa - a narrative that erased the people who lived in the region and the reach of the Holocaust beyond Europe.\n\nAs political history, War of Shadows describes events that would shape the Middle East and set the stage for the creation of Israel. As espionage history, it describes the origins of high-tech encryption and hacking. And as cinematic non-fiction, it's the story of forgotten heroes, people who changed the world and were erased from memory.\n\nGershom Gorenberg is a historian and journalist. His previous books include \"The Unmaking of Israel\" and \"The Accidental Empire: Israel and the Birth of the Settlements, 1967-1977.\" He is a columnist for the Washington Post, and has written for The New York Times Magazine, Atlantic Monthly and The New York Review of Books and in Hebrew for Haaretz. He lives in Jerusalem, except during stints teaching a workshop on writing history at the Columbia Graduate School of Journalism.\n\nJonathan D. Sarna directs the Schusterman Center for Israel Studies. He is University Professor, and Joseph H. and Belle R. Braun Professor of American Jewish History in the Department of Near Eastern & Judaic Studies at Brandeis University.\n\nYehudah Mirsky is a professor of Near Eastern and Judaic Studies and core faculty member at the Schusterman Center for Israel Studies at Brandeis University.\n\nCosponsored by the Center for German and European Studies and the Schusterman Center for Israel Studies at Brandeis University.\n\nGenomic Citizenship: The Molecularization of Identity in the Contemporary Middle East\n\nOctober 5, 2021\n\nWatch the recording\n\nA public conversation, in conjunction with the release of Genomic Citizenship: The Molecularization of Identity in the Contemporary Middle East, with its author, Prof. Ian McGonigle, and Prof. Sara Shostak, two experts working at the intersection of science and society.\n\nBased on ethnographic work in Israel and Qatar, two small Middle Eastern ethno-nations with significant biomedical resources, Genomic Citizenship explores the relationship between science and identity. Prof. McGonigle discusses biological understandings of Jewishness, especially in relation to the intellectual history of Zionism and Jewish political thought, and considers the possibility of a novel application of genetics in assigning Israeli citizenship. He also describes developments in genetic medicine in Qatar and analyzes the Qatari Biobank in the context of Qatari nationalism and state-building projects.\n\nIan McGonigle is Assistant Professor of Anthropology and Science, Technology, and Society at Nanyang Technological University (NTU) in Singapore and an alumnus of the Schusterman Center’s Summer Institute for Israel Studies. Before joining NTU, he held postdoctoral positions at Tel Aviv University, Harvard University, and the University of Cambridge. Prof. McGonigle’s work in the social study of science examines the role of science in identity formation and nation-building, revealing the privileged role of biology in mediating ethnic and national identities and stabilizing national consciousnesses.\n\nSara Shostak is Associate Professor of Sociology and Health: Science, Society and Policy, Brandeis University. She is the author of the award-winning book Exposed Science: Genes, the Environment, and the Politics of Population Health, served as the associate editor of a special issue of the American Journal of Sociology focused on genetics and social structure, and has an extensive record of publications on whether and how genetic information shapes people’s lives and life chances.\n\n\"The Zionist Phantom\" Closing Event\n\nSeptember 14, 2021\n\nWatch the recording\n\nJoin us to mark the closing of Dana Arieli’s virtual exhibition \"The Zionist Phantom.\" This live conversation will expand upon the themes emerging from the exhibition, suggesting new and exciting connections between international artists, ideas and creative projects that explore collective histories, personal traumas and their presence in public spaces.\n\nProf. Adriana Katzew will present her photographic work in conversation with Dr. Shayna Weiss. Katzew has been unearthing stories and memories of people, moments and places, inspired and driven by the history of her own Mexican-Jewish family. Prof. Dana Arieli will then join the discussion to address some of the similarities and differences between their works. Moderated by the exhibition curator, Dr. Rotem Rozental.\n\nAbout the Exhibition\n\nIn “The Zionist Phantom,” Prof. Dana Arieli shapes a panoramic view of a landscape defined by the uneasy presence of its missing limbs. With dozens of photographs captured across Israel from the 1980s to the present, the exhibition presents abandoned and active spaces, unfinished buildings, military presence in civilian areas, sites of collective remembrance and personal loss, exhuming the past lives of the sites, of what will never return.\n\nUpper image: Dana Arieli, \"Quneitra, 2018\"\n\nLower image: Adriana Katzew, \"Caminaba y Caminaba...\"\n\nThe Zionist Phantom - Exhibition Launch and Artist Talk with Prof. Dana Arieli and Dr. Rotem Rozental\n\nApril 26, 2021\n\nWatch the recording\n\nThe Zionist Phantom\n\nby Dana Arieli\n\nA virtual exhibition presented by the Schusterman Center for Israel Studies at Brandeis University. Curated by Rotem Rozental.\n\nThe Israeli landscape is haunted by ghosts. Assembling what she refers to as “a worldview,” Dana Arieli shapes a panoramic view of a landscape defined by the uneasy presence of its missing limbs. The idea of the phantom reflects what should have been there. Going beyond a sense of longing, the phantom embodies a sensory experience: what the mind wants to see or hear, what it is convinced—even momentarily—is, in fact, there. And yet, we tend to discover, the sound or sight are a misunderstanding, an internal malfunction. More than conveying what was there, the phantom experience exhumes what will never return.\n\nWe are so excited to launch our very first virtual exhibition! Join us for a candid artist talk with Professor Dana Arieli, Design Faculty, Holon Institute of Technology and Mandel Center for Leadership in the Negev, and curator Dr. Rotem Rozental, Chief Curator and Senior Director of Arts and Culture at American Jewish University.\n\nCosponsored by the Schusterman Center for Israel Studies and the Consulate General of Israel to New England.

She is the author of Tubercular Capital: Illness and the Conditions of Modern Jewish Writing, winner of the 2018 Salo Wittmayer Baron Book Prize (Stanford University Press, 2018).\n\nThis lecture was the last in a two-part series — held in conjunction with Professor Ilana Szobel’s course, Disability Cultures: Art, Film, and Literature of People with Disabilities — exploring real-life experiences and artistic performances of people living with disability in Israel. Artists, writers, and scholars will examine the intersection of disability with Zionist ideology, gender, race, and class. Our presenters, thus, examine the ways performance of disability on stage, on the screen, and in everyday life raises questions about Israeli subjectivity.\n\nPresented by the Schusterman Center for Israel Studies at Brandeis University and cosponsored by the Hadassah-Brandeis Institute; the Department of Near Eastern and Judaic Studies; the Lurie Institute for Disability Policy; and the Program in Health: Science, Society, and Policy (HSSP), all housed at Brandeis University.\n\nA Conversation with Political Journalist, Gil Hoffman\n\nApril 12, 2021\n\nPresented by the Consulate General of Israel to New England and moderated by Brown University students, Ilana Emanuel and Ivy Scott, this is a rare opportunity for students across New England to learn directly about political journalism, international affairs, and Middle Eastern politics through the eyes of veteran reporter and chief political correspondent and analyst for the Jerusalem Post, Gil Hoffman.\n\nHoffman, a well-known Israeli journalist, is a routine political analyst for CNN, Al-Jazeera, and other significant news outlets. Known as \"the most optimistic man in Israel,\" Hoffman is known for providing his readers a behind-the-scenes look into Israeli politics via his connections to Israeli and Palestinian figures from across the political spectrum. Leading media have interviewed Hoffman on six continents, and he has lectured about Israel in all 50 U.S. States.\n\nThis event is generously co-sponsored by 16 universities, university departments, and student organizations from across all New England States.\n\nStudio Israel: Conversation Series\n\nApril 8, 2021\n\nFrom Within and Without\n\nWatch the recording\n\nTamar Borer has been creating and performing for over 20 years.

Gordon: A Retrospective\n\nA Symposium Marking the 100th Year Since his Passing\n\nSession 3\n\nWatch the recording\n\nNearly a century since his passing, the life and work of Aharon David Gordon (1856-1922) have drawn renewed attention. One of the most original of Zionism's foundational thinkers, his ideas are strikingly relevant to contemporary questions, from ethics and nationalism, to the connectedness of environmentalism, community and social justice, to the possibility of vibrant Jewish culture beyond familiar dichotomies of secularity and religion.\n\nThe rare intellectual who lived out his ideas, Gordon moved in his mid-40s from Russia to Palestine, where by day he worked as an agricultural laborer, and by night wrote penetrating essays on the meaning of Jewish national - natural revival, and powerful, poetic correspondence with young activists, who later put his ideas into practice in the Kibbutz movement and Labor Zionism. Yet Gordon's significance looms much larger than his status as a revered icon of Labor Zionism. His writings and example still challenge assumptions about the meaning of Jewishness and the Land, on the possibility of living authentically in industrial society and invite readers to think about their lives as Jews and as human beings.\n\nA flurry of new publications from manuscripts, scholarly studies, and renewed popular interest in Gordon among social activists and artists, point to the vitality of his thought, as a point of entry into Zionist history, and a means of exploring Jewish cultural and social renaissance today. This major figure is little-known in the English-speaking world.

In 2018, Muki placed first in the Abu Dhabi Grand Slam, which was the first time an Israeli competitor competed under the Israeli flag and not under the International Judo Association flag. The competition marked a major milestone when the Israeli national anthem, Hatikvah, played in the Gulf State.\n\nIn 2019, Sagi was ranked world number one judoka (judo expert). He has won the European championships, and he will represent his country at the Tokyo Olympics. But this Israeli hero is also a strong advocate for peace and equality between all nations. After an Iranian competitor had to forfeit a match due to the Iranian Regime, Sagi reached out to him, and they have since become friends. Sagi believes that sports can be a powerful bridge between peoples, culture, and beliefs. These days, Sagi is getting ready for the Tokyo 2021 Olympics.\n\n​Cosponsored by t​he Consulate General of Israel to New England, ​BIPAC, ​Brandeis Hillel, the Brandeis ​Department of Athletics, Physical Education, and Recreation​, and the Schusterman Center for Israel Studies at Brandeis University.\n\nStudio Israel: Conversation Series\n\nFebruary 11, 2021\n\nWatch the recording\n\nIsraeli tastemaker, entrepreneur and curator Galit Reismann of TLVstyle combines her passion for fashion with her deep connection to Tel Aviv.

They must both move through physical materials whose properties govern their flow. At the dawn of the Arab-Israeli conflict, both kinds of power were circulated through the electric grid that was built by the Zionist engineer Pinhas Rutenberg in the period of British rule, from 1917 to 1948. In this talk, Fredrik Meiton will chart a story of rapid and uneven development that was greatly influenced by the electric grid and set the stage for the conflict between Arabs and Jews. The grid shaped relations among the Zionists, Palestinians, and British rulers—and anticipated the outcome of Jewish statehood and Palestinian statelessness in 1948—by imposing a logic that has continued to shape the area and the conflict until today.\n\nFredrik Meiton is an assistant professor of history at the University of New Hampshire.\n\nEkin Kurtic, discussant, is a junior research fellow at the Crown Center.\n\nPresented by the Crown Center for Middle East Studies and co-sponsored by the Islamic and Middle Eastern Studies program, Schusterman Center for Israel Studies, and Department of History, at Brandeis University.\n\nImage: Illustration of Rutenberg’s hydropower station from the Palestinian newspaper Falastin, published on November 2, 1932 - the fifteenth anniversary of the Balfour Declaration.\n\nText and the City: Learning Hebrew in the Street\n\nJanuary 21, 2021\n\nWatch the recording\n\nThrough texts found in their natural habitat, in the streets of Tel Aviv, we'll decipher textual graffiti, lost pet ads and stickers.

She spoke about the process of coming to terms with her family’s past, the ways in which that served as an impetus to excavate and reconstruct her grandfather’s history through archival research, and the importance of preserving the stories of peoples displaced through migration.\n\nSince 2007, Ms. Moughalian has traveled to Turkey, England, Israel, Palestine, and France to uncover her grandfather’s traces and has published articles and given talks on the genesis of Jerusalem's Armenian ceramic art. In 2019, Stanford University Press published her biography of her grandfather, Feast of Ashes: The Life and Art of David Ohannessian, which was longlisted for the PEN/America Literary Awards Jacqueline Bograd Weld Award for Biography, and a finalist for the American Association of Publishers PROSE Award for Biography & Autobiography. She is currently at work on a second book.\n\nSato Moughalian is an award-winning flutist in New York City, who, until the pandemic struck, toured widely on five continents as a chamber musician, served as principal flute for Gotham Chamber Opera, American Modern Ensemble and a number of other NY groups. She is flutist and Artistic Director of Perspectives Ensemble, founded at Columbia University in 1993. Moughalian’s professional activities as a flutist and her intense, life-long interest in the visual arts, material culture, and writing, are increasingly intersecting.\n\nCosponsored with the National Association for Armenian Studies and Research (NAASR)"
