After graduating from high school (Abitur), Brussig was trained as a construction worker, then served subsequently in the military, and had various jobs. From 1990 on, he studied sociology and theater. From about 1995 on, he became an independent author of mainly prose and drama. In 1991, he published his first novel—Wasserfarben (Water Colors)—under the pseudonym Cordt Berneberger. However, he first became famous with his 1995 novel Helden wie wir (Heroes Like Us; English translation 1996), a satirical and grotesque novel about âEverything you always wanted to know about the fall of the wall, but never dared to askâ (Le Monde). In 1999, Brussig published Am kÃ¼rzeren Ende der Sonnenallee (The Shorter End of Sonnenallee), and in 2001, Leben bis MÃ¤nner (Life through Masters), the satirical monologue of a soccer coach who grew up in the GDR and coached his teams through socialist as well as post-wall times.The movie versions of Sonnenallee and Helden wie wir were also very successful, and the stage adaptation of Helden wie wir, has also been highly praised, having been performed on more than 30 stages in Germany. Brussigâs works have been translated into many languages, such as French, Greek, Dutch, Korean, and various others. Thomas Brussig is one of the first German authors from the âneuen BundeslÃ¤nderâ to receive acclaime for his work both in East and West Germany. It is his mastery of language and unbeatable satirical humor that have made him famous.

Put more boldly, for Celan, belief in a God, one who loves His people, is responsible for the Shoah. Conversely, without a belief in God, the Shoah would never have occurred. To argue my case, I analyze âEs war Erde in ihnen,â though I reference other poems in order to clarify my position. My approach is distinctive because I focus on the theology of Hitlerâs Mein Kampf. In the first part of the essay, I examine the genocidal theology of the Bible. In the second, I illustrate how Hitler appropriated Christian genocidal theology. In the final section, I do a close reading of âEs war Erde in ihnenâ in light of Hitlerâs theology. (ML)\n\nDavid John\n\nThe First Black Gretchen: Fritz Bennewitzâs Faust I in New York\n\nAbstract:\n\nIn May 1978, prominent GDR director Fritz Bennewitz brought Goetheâs Faust I to an American audience on the stage of the renowned La MaMa Experimental Theatre Club on New Yorkâs lower east side. The multi-racial production included the first black Gretchen recorded in theater history, itself an international landmark. Far from being merely a racial token, in preparing for and performing her role, Christine Campbell as Gretchen underwent a remarkable transformation of consciousness which I describe using Richard Schechnerâs performance theory. The associations she invoked were innovative and moving, culminating in songs by Billie Holiday. Campbellâs performance had resonance for American race relations and the history of the black movement, and this production is just one piece of evidence for reassessing Bennewitzâs role in modern German theater and placing him among its leaders in intercultural performance.
