Early Origins of the Menke family

The surname Menke was first found in Pomerania, where the name was closely identified in early mediaeval times with the feudal society which would become prominent throughout European history. Chronicles first mention Meyne Meynen of Barth in Pomerania in 1415, and Heinrich Meyneking of Hanover in 1311.
