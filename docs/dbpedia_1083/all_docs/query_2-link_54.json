        "text": "Last week’s revelation, given with just two days’ notice, that former President Donald Trump would be making an appearance at the annual convention for the National Association of Black Journalists (NABJ), set off the expected firestorm of debate. June 2024 polling showed that about 7 in 10 Black Americans have a somewhat or very unfavorable view of Trump, so of course, there was no shortage of criticism.\n\nVeteran journalist April Ryan, a long-time White House Correspondent, who Trump demeaned on several occasions during his presidential tenure, called the NABJ’s invitation to Trump “a slap in the face” to Black female journalists “who had to protect themselves from the wrath of [Trump]…” Washington Post columnist Karen Attiah, who was also the co-chair of this year’s NABJ convention, stepped down from her role saying, “While my decision was influenced by a variety of factors, I was not involved or consulted with in any way with the decision to platform Trump in such a format.”"
