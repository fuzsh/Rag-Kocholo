        "text": "ALLEN PARK -- The Detroit Lions got one player back for Monday's training camp practice, but were missing a few new names.\n\nOffensive guard Leroy Harris was cleared to return from the physically unable to perform list, practicing for the first time since he tore his ACL last season.\n\n\"The next step is obviously the strength-building process, just going out there during individual (drills), getting down in the stance, continuing to strengthen it up and build your endurance up,\" Harris said.\n\nOn the other side of the ball, Detroit's secondary continues to take hits. Cornerback Ron Bartell (shoulder) remained sidelined. He was joined by Jonte Green, who suffered a hamstring injury on Sunday. The Lions lost a third corner toward the end of Monday's session when Chris Greenwood also tweaked a hamstring.\n\nSchwartz told the media the team is sending Bartell and Green for MRIs.\n\nAlso sitting out for the Lions were safety Louis Delmas, linebacker Carmen Messina, wide receiver Devin Thomas (PUP) and defensive ends Ronnell Lewis (non-football injury) and Jason Jones.\n\nIt was a scheduled day off for Delmas, working back from a long-term knee ailment.\n\nJones is also dealing with a knee.\n\n\"There's going to come a time where we got to push through soreness and pain and things like that, but the fourth day of training camp is not that day,\" Schwartz said. \"We figured we'd give him a day. Hopefully he can put that behind him and then move on.\""
