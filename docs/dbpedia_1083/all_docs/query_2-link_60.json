        "text": "It’s difficult to find something for everyone when you’re sitting in a room of 17 high school athletic directors.\n\n“It was a great task,” said Ridgeview AD Jake Kennedy. “We wanted something for all 17 schools. It took a lot of trust and a lot of people giving and taking. That’s what makes conferences great.\n\n“We’ve got a really good thing going forward. We all take care of each other here — and with people we know.”\n\nLargely through the collaboration of Kennedy and Tuscola AD Ryan Hornaday, the Heart of Illinois Conference and the Central Illinois Conference have formed a football alliance.\n\nBehold the Heart of Central Illinois Conference, a football only merger that “gives us strength going forward and the leeway to make changes if needed,” according to Kennedy.\n\nHOIC schools Fisher, GCMS, Heyworth, LeRoy, Fieldcrest, Tri-Valley, El Paso-Gridley, Ridgeview (which coops with Lexington for football), Eureka, Deer Creek-Mackinaw and Tremont have been joined by CIC members Clinton, Macon Meridian, Central A&M of Moweaqua, Tuscola, Warrensburg-Latham and Shelbyville.\n\n“For us, it made a lot of sense to explore this option,” LeRoy AD and football coach BJ Zeleznik said. “A lot of it had to do with stability of scheduling for small schools.\n\n\"The landscape of high school football is ever changing with schools moving on to 8-man or trying to find a competitive balance in their schedules to have opportunities to compete in the postseason and programs choosing to coop.”\n\nFor the coming season only, the Heart of Central Illinois will have two divisions based on enrollment.\n\nThe Small School Division features schools with Illinois High School Association classification enrollments from 182 to 313 and will comprise Fisher, GCMS, Heyworth, LeRoy, Meridian, Fieldcrest, Central A&M, Tuscola and Warrensburg-Latham.\n\nThe Large School Division, whose biggest schools are Clinton (474.5) and Eureka (445.5), also will have Tri-Valley, EPG, Ridgeview-Lexington, Dee-Mack, Shelbyville and Tremont.\n\nSmall School teams will face all of their divisional foes, leaving one nonconference game. Large School programs face all seven divisional opponents, with two nonconference contests.\n\nWhile most schools have gone outside the league umbrella to fill out their schedule, the option remains to play crossover games. GCMS will take on Ridgeview-Lexington and LeRoy will tangle with former co-op partner Tri-Valley this fall.\n\n“I like it. I’m excited for the tradition of the programs that are going to be in it,” said Tri-Valley coach Josh Roop. “I’ve been really happy working with the CIC. I feel like when we got in the room there was compromise there. In the end, everybody got something they needed out of their schedule. It’s two solid conferences coming together.”\n\nRoop acknowledged travel was “a little bit of a concern.”\n\nFieldcrest, which is located in Minonk, is 104 miles from Tuscola. EPG and Dee-Mack are both an approximately two-hour drive from Shelbyville.\n\n“But it’s less travel than what the proposed districts look like,” Roop said of an IHSA proposal that was defeated.\n\nFieldcrest coach Nick Meyer believes his players are “excited to play different teams. It will be weird not playing El Paso, but it was nice to have a joint practice with them. The big and little sizes (of divisions) are going to be good for both parties.”\n\nOf the nine Small School teams, four made it to the playoffs in 2023 with six of the eight Large School teams reaching the necessary five wins for playoff qualification.\n\n“For us — I can’t speak for other CIC schools — I feel like it’s a really good fit geographically and talent wise,” said Clinton coach Ron Bass. “I know we’re a bigger school. They’re concerned and I would be, too.\n\n\"But I feel like the athletes we have in our school fit in well with the HOIC. I’m ecstatic. I was in the Heart of Illinois at Tri-Valley, and it’s a great conference.”\n\nIn 2025, the HOCIC will break into three divisions with six schools in each of the larger enrollment divisions and five in the smallest.\n\n“That gives us a little more parity,” Kennedy said. “It allows schools in the new conference to continue with traditional rivalry games within their previous conferences.”\n\nAccording to Kennedy, the format that begins in 2025 means 153 of the HOCIC members’ games will be against other conference foes leaving just 11 to be scheduled outside the HOCIC.\n\nWhile the divisions have yet to given names, the smallest school division will feature Fisher, Heyworth, LeRoy, Central A&M and Tuscola.\n\nThe middle division will feature GCMS, Meridian, Fieldcrest, Warrensburg-Latham, Ridgeview-Lexington and Dee-Mack. The biggest division enrollment wise will be populated by Clinton, Tri-Valley, EPG, Eureka, Shelbyville and Tremont.\n\nAll HOCIC schools will play the same conference schedule for the four-year period of 2025-28.\n\n“After the second year is completed, we will look at making changes if needed for the 2029 season,” said Kennedy, who also credited former EPG AD Dave Ferrenburg with assistance in assembling the three-division format.\n\nAccording to Zeleznik, the group tried to further refine the HOCIC schedule for 2025 after the 2024 slate was finalized.\n\n“We listened to concerns about travel and natural rivalries and some of the issues with enrollment and went ahead and redrafted what the alignments would be for 2025-26 and addressed some of those concerns,” Zeleznik said.\n\nHOCIC members are trying to retain as much flexibility as possible to deal with potential future membership changes.\n\n“If and when those changes do occur, we’ll be able to absorb those changes and make smoother transitions than we would otherwise,” said Zeleznik.\n\nFollow Randy Reinhardt on Twitter: @Pg_Reinhardt\n\nLove\n\n0\n\nFunny\n\n0\n\nWow\n\n0\n\nSad\n\n0\n\nAngry\n\n0\n\nGet in the game with our Prep Sports Newsletter\n\nSent weekly directly to your inbox!\n\n* I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.\n\nRandy Reinhardt\n\nSports Reporter\n\nGet email notifications on {{subject}} daily!\n\nYour notification has been saved.\n\nThere was a problem saving your notification.\n\n{{description}}\n\nEmail notifications are only sent once a day, and only if there are new matching items.\n\nFollowed notifications\n\nPlease log in to use this feature\n\nLog In\n\nDon't have an account?
