        "text": "Mr. Johnny B. Harris entered his final rest on Sunday, November 12, 2023, at the age of 76 after a life well-lived. He was born in Crenshaw, Mississippi on December 12, 1946, and was raised by his loving parents, Willie Harris and Ella Wynn Harris.\n\nHe met Annie Mae Money, and they married in 1970. The couple moved to Chicago, Illinois, where they started their family. He later moved to Saginaw where he could be closer to his children. Johnny loved being the provider for his family and always made sure their needs were met. He retired from the Board of Education as a Custodial Engineer after 25+ years of service. Johnny took pride in his work and often took his children to work with him. His favorite pastimes included listening to the blues, watching old westerns, and Bruce Lee movies. Johnny loved food, mostly eating it, but he sometimes decided that he was making the meal for the night. We always knew what that was going to be, roast and potatoes â€¦every time.\n\nJohnny leaves to cherish wonderful memories four daughters, Annie B. (Kevin) Taylor, Ister L. Lewis, Edna M. Harris, and Ella J. Harris (Omar); two sons, Johnny Harris Jr., and Kavester L. (Jessica) Harris; grandchildren, Johnesha, Cleopatra, Peter, Cierra, Nevaeh, Kamarri, Kamarin, Kobi, Kanaizja, Kamya, Jermaine, Kamani, Kareem, Kyrie, Kahlani, Alex, and Imani; one loving brother, James Harris; sister-in-law, Earnestine Harris; many great-grandchildren, other relatives and friends.\n\nJohnny was preceded in death by his wife, Annie M. Harris; son, Leon Harris; his parents, Willie and Ella Wynn Harris; sister, Jannie Harris; brothers, Willie Jr., Charles, Leroy, and Ollie Harris."
