        "text": "As Leroy's Recruiter I was bothered by the news. I too was deployed to Iraq at the time. When I heard the news I could only feel responsible for his death. Up until my wife presented his parents with a letter I wrote showing my sympathy and regret, I carried the burden of Leroy's death. I was told that Leroy enjoyed being a soldier and that he had no regrets joining the Army. Leroy was a good person who knew what he wanted in life. His commitment was unparallel and I knew from the start that being a soldier would come easy for him. He will never be forgotten and his memory will always be with me.\n\nMy condolences go out to the family of Leroy Harris-Kelly.\n\nI was a roommate of David Valenzuela at the time of his recruiting duties at Azusa, California. I am also an old high school friend of his and have lost contact with David as of 2001. If anyone knows his contact address or e-mail address could you please forward it to my e-mail address fernfuentes13@aol.com\n\nThank you and once again my sincere condolences to the Harris Family.\n\nFernando Fuentes\n\nTragically, I was with PFC Harris-Kelley when his accident occured and the precise moment of his unexpected and untimely death. The extent of his severe injuries were far greater to overcome than the 42 minutes of CPR that I personally administered to his young body along with the assistance of many officers in our unit. I know he would be pleased to know and I hope that his family finds some comfort in knowing that his unit reacted instantaneously to secure the area to avoid ambush where his accident occured and that countless enlisted soldiers and officers did EVERYTHING to try to save his life and that of his co-driver. Miraculously, that soldier, SGT Worthen, did live to wear the patch of the Mighty 596th Maintenance Company yet another day thanks in part by the Grace of God and the efforts of all those involved that fateful day almost 5 years ago. My deepest condolences go out to his family and his friends, he was very well liked in the unit and his impressions of Michael Jackson when I needed a good laugh were a fond memory that I will carry with me - all the rest of my days. Respectfully, SSG Paul E. Dowdle III, Supply Sergeant / Armorer of the Mighty 596th MT. Co.\n\nAs a neighbor 2 doors away I enjoyed hearing him practice playing his trumpet. I told my son that he could be as good of a trumpet player as Leroy if he would just dedicate himself to practice as much as he did. My heart goes out to his family to this day. They really seemed to be very close knit and I am sure family life will never be the same without him.\n\nI was so proud to be an African American at the memorial that the City of Azusa paid towards Leroy Harris. Even though no words were said about his ethnicity and how he braved a young life in a city that is nationally known for its racial tension, the City of Azusa recognized him as the ultimate soldier he was. His courage, comittment\n\nand the ability to see beyond peoples fault in order to serve the better good will live forever in my heart. Thank you\n\nJohn\n\nMr. Kelly was a dear friend of mine. I would like to say to his family \" Sorry for your loss\" .I was there the day of his deaf, I did everything in my power to save him and the passenger. I will always used Apr. 20, 2004 to uplift people around me.. That was a day that will live with me FOREVER!!!! R.I.P. MY HERO MR. Harris KELLY!!!!\n\nHarris was my lil brotha. I met him Kuwait on a special detail. He reminded me so much of myself when I first entered the military. I am in film school now and I want to make a movie about my lil partner. If any of his family or friends read this please contact me. 310-343-1163 Frank\n\nLeroy and I went to High School and were in band together. He was a character! He always had a way of making everyone laugh wherever he went with his Michael Jackson impressions or just being himself; outgoing and fun. We use to raz each other a bit all in good fun at band events. I still have the necklace he used to wear to school everyday, he had no intention of giving it to me but he wouldn't take it back either :) I think i'll keep it forever. Someone earlier mentioned Leroy's ethnicity... I'll touch on that... Leroy bridged the gap for us at our school when the black and hispanic wars were going on strongly. He separated fights, stood up for what he believed in and encouraged peace. I think it also helped that he knew spanish, was on the basketball team and was considered a \"band nerd\" Everyone knew Leroy, loved Leroy and respected Leroy so the division soon became unity. He was the type of man that all men should strive to be. Missing him still.\n\nLeroy and his family were our neighbors, and they were some of the first people to welcome my family to Azusa when we moved in. He was always so funny and genuine, and my brother Conan and I used to have so much fun playing with him when we were kids. I will never forget the pain of losing Leroy, nor will I forget the joy of knowing him. He is buried at the top of a hill overlooking the gorgeous valley, just steps away from Conan's grave. I often bring him flowers, and sit and remember the years we all had together. You are sorely missed, Leroy!\n\nLeroy was one of the first people i met when i started to attend azusa high and we were good friends and had a lot in common rather it was sports music or just clowning eachother we always had a good time, when i heard of his death i was tore up because we spent a lot of good times together but i know he died protecting our freedoms, to this day whenever i am in azusa and i see his grandmother she always says hi and remembers me as Leroy's friend. I will always remember and cherish my friendship wit my brother Leroy Harris\n\nMet him while at the 596th, we were both from California and Central America. Remember that \"Mighty Mouse\" tatoo....Proud, always putting a smile on all of us with that energy that made him unique. I will always remember his pride, that unmatched kindness and that big smile of his ...may he rest in peace and know that he is not forgotten."
