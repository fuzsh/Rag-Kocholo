Pascrell served his 9th District constituents and his home city of Paterson for almost three decades.\n\nWhat annoys you the most about driving in New Jersey? Vote in our poll\n\nLucas Frau, NorthJersey.com\n\nThere is nothing like being on the road in New Jersey. Sometimes it feels like we Jersey drivers should get an award for all we put up with while traveling. Whether it is the traffic on the parkway when you’re headed down the shore, trying to get into New York City or the out of state drivers that can not keep up with the Jersey pace, driving in the Garden State can be exhausting.\n\n96-year-old Trenton resident knows the remedy for city’s trash problems\n\nLA Parker, The Trentonian\n\nWilliam “Willie” Powell holds the antidote for a City of Trenton trash problem — everyone should do their part, in this case, even when your life odometer shows 96 years.

Here’s what to expect\n\nKara VanDooijeweert, NorthJersey.com\n\nWalking toward the shoreline at Gunnison was like walking into a bottle of sprayable Coppertone sunscreen. The air was thick and fragrant, and I’m sure I would’ve had a migraine had it not been overcast that day.
