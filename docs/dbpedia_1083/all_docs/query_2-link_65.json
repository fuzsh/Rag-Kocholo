        "text": "Why accept a plea deal in 9/11 case?\n\nRe: “Suspected 9/11 plotter agrees to plead guilty,” Aug. 1 news story\n\nAre you kidding me? Khalid Sheikh Mohammed is the alleged mastermind behind the 9/11 tragedy. He is suspected of not only providing money but also training the terrorists. And he gets a plea deal? I have always been under the impression when prosecutors do plea deals, they don’t have enough experience and/or evidence to fully charge somebody. Providing plea deals only pads the prosecutors’ win columns.\n\nLeroy M Martinez, Denver\n\nSupreme Court doesn’t need an overhaul\n\nRe: “Biden wants term limits for justices,” July 30 news story\n\nAnyone who passed high school civics recognizes that Congress cannot impose term limits on Supreme Court justices without a constitutional amendment. The three branches of our government are separate and co-equal. Just as the Court could not impose term limits on Congress, Congress cannot impose term limits on the Court. This is just President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris playing to their base.\n\nThe same is true for the Biden/Harris call for supposed ethical reforms in the Supreme Court, which is an obvious effort to retaliate against conservative justices. Conservatives endured liberal decisions when the liberal wing controlled the Court, and now liberals need to do the same.\n\nA September 2023 Gallup poll showed that 42% of U.S. citizens believe the mindset of the Court is “about right,” with 17% stating that the Court is too liberal and 39% seeing it as too conservative. Just because the extreme left does not like some Court rulings does not mean the Court is “extremist” or needs to be overhauled by term limits, Court-packing (adding more justices), or supposed ethics rules.\n\nKevin Amatuzio, Englewood\n\nLeave wildlife management to the experts\n\nRe: “Proposed hunting ban on mountain lions, other wild cats makes ballot,” Aug. 1 news story\n\nThe constant ballot box biology going on here in Colorado needs to stop in regard to the ballot initiative to stop Mountain Lion harvesting. After big cat hunting bans had passed in California, the movement was brought here to Colorado. Please leave wildlife management to educated professionals in wildlife biology, not by vote. The current population is well-managed, and this initiative is not needed here. What is next, a ban on big-game hunting (as they are trophies also)? I urge you to have common sense and vote no on this in November.\n\nRobert Webb, Loveland\n\nBe truthful and call a lie a lie\n\nRe: “Trump falsely says Harris misled voters about her race,” Aug. 1 news story\n\nWhy does The Denver Post continue to soft-pedal former President Donald Trump’s utterances?\n\nA recent article contained “Trump falsely says …” and “former president wrongly claimed.” Seriously, if there is any hope for this country, what’s wrong with the truth? Trump lied.\n\nGuy Wroble, Denver\n\nSign up for Sound Off to get a weekly roundup of our columns, editorials and more."
