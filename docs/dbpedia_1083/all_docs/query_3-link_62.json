        "text": "After a complete transformation, the iconic UARK Bowl on Dickson Street in Fayetteville will become “The Leroy Pinhouse & Sporting Lounge” (pronounced La-ROY), a new entertainment venue. Its official opening is set for Thursday, May 30 at 11 a.m.\n\nRecently announced to become the region’s most uncommon restaurant and bar, ownership of The Leroy consists of Fayetteville developers Ted Belden, Todd Ross and a third partner with a historic attachment to the city.\n\nPatrons can expect a small, yet unique menu created by a collaboration between a highly-regarded California chef and local award-winning chef, Rob Nelson (Tusk & Trotter), bespoke cocktails, four regulation-length duckpin bowling lanes and two Full Swing™ sports simulators (golf, shooting, hockey, soccer and more). Big-screen sports viewing will be available, as well as a competition dart arena, two AV lounges with 138” HiDef TVs and even video games. The atmosphere is described as “neo-industrial with a nod to old Vegas.”\n\nThe owners also intend to host duckpin bowling and dart leagues, golf/dart/bowling tournaments, special events with celebrity appearances and lessons from professionals in person and online.\n\n“It’s quite a new concept, one that we feel will be quickly adopted by people looking for an elevated entertainment experience,” Belden said. “Actually, most of the design, menu and gaming ideas came from our third partner.”\n\nThe team that worked together to bring the vision to life includes Bradley Edwards (architecture), CDI Contractors (construction), Good Gravy Group (operations) and GMS Group (branding/graphics/marketing). But what is the story behind this other partner?\n\n“His name is indeed Leroy (pronounced LEE-roy), a Fayetteville native whose last name we’ve promised not to reveal. He left here long ago, made quite a fortune in all sorts of off-the-wall ventures, and now just sort of travels the world living the good life,” Belden explained.\n\nRoss said Leroy pitched the idea a few years ago.\n\n“He’s been very persuasive about opening a unique lounge here. And he’s been exceptionally particular about every aspect of the place that will bear his name, so we took some time to get it right,” Ross said. “The UARK Bowl was a good fit but had to be completely remodeled to showcase his vision.”\n\nBelden jokingly alleges that “the most interesting man in the world” character was patterned after his partner. “Leroy’s adventures and travels played a big part in the character and attitude of this place. Our guests are going to feel that the moment they step inside.”\n\nSome of the remarkable artifacts Leroy has collected over the years will be on display with new ones being added regularly, Belden added.\n\nParking is available in the Dickson Deck directly across from The Leroy – guests receive a discount when parked there. Valet parking will also be offered Thursday through Sunday from 5:30 p.m. to 11:30 p.m. The Leroy will be open from 11 a.m. to 11 p.m. Monday through Sunday. Reservations for gaming stations and the AV lounges can be made through the website or in person. Memberships are also available.\n\nThe Leroy is scheduled to open later this month. To keep up with new details as they’re released, check out The Leroy’s website or Facebook page."
