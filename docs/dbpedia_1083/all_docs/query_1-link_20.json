Leroy Harris-Kelly, a native of Costa Rica, met the woman he would marry during Army training in Virgina. They were married in July 2002 in Germany. When Harris-Kelly shipped out to Iraq from Germany, his wife was discharged and sent home to Michigan, where she said she had expected he would soon join her and their 15-month-old daughter, Aalexis. Harris-Kelly, 20, of Azusa, Calif., was killed in a truck accident north of Talil, Iraq. He was based in Darmstadt, Germany. \"I was so glad he was coming home,\" his wife said. \"They offered him a re-enlistment but he said 'no.'\"\n\nâ€” Associated Press"
