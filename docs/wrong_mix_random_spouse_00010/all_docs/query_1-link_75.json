        "text": "Founder and CEO\n\nSassan Ghahramani is the President and CEO of SGH Macro Advisors, LLC. SGH produces forward-looking reports on the major central banks and key policy developments that drive global interest rate, equity, and currency markets. Its proprietary reports are highly valued by many of the world’s largest and most influential hedge funds, money managers, and financial policy officials.\n\nGhahramani founded SGH Macro Advisors in 2009 in partnership with a bond brokerage firm and took the firm independent in 2012. Originally headquartered in New York, NY, SGH has been based in Greenwich, CT, since 2016, from where it manages a portfolio of international clients, and a network that spans from Washington to Beijing, London, and Frankfurt.\n\nGhahramani oversees all of SGH’s research, and personally produces reports on the European Central Bank, Europe, China, and geopolitics.\n\nProfessional Career\n\nPrior to forming SGH, Ghahramani was President and CEO of Medley Global Advisors, a policy research firm established in 1998 by the late Richard Medley, a one-time advisor to the legendary investor George Soros.\n\nAs Medley’s CEO, Ghahramani built out coverage of G7, Emerging Market, Energy, and Sectoral Equity content, a specialized client management and sales team, and led the sale of the firm to a private equity partnership plus a minority stake to a major global investment bank.\n\nBefore MGA, Ghahramani had a successful twelve-year career trading the currency markets at various Wall Street firms; as a Senior Foreign Exchange Trader at AIG Trading, Lehman Brothers, and Chemical Bank (now part of JP Morgan), and as Head Trader for Foreign Exchange at Union Bank of Switzerland (UBS), New York.\n\nPersonal Life\n\nGhahramani was born in Tehran, Iran in 1963. His father, Ghahraman Ghahramani, was a diplomat during the reign of the last Shah, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, and his family followed the elder Ghahramani’s diplomatic postings to Canada, the then Soviet Union, Iran, and Spain. In those years, Sassan and his sister Azita attended the Anglo-American School of Moscow and the Tehran International School, and with their younger brother Zoubin all attended and graduated from the American School of Madrid.\n\nAt age 16, Ghahramani moved to the United States to attend Brown University, while his parents and younger brother remained after the Iranian Revolution in exile in Spain. He obtained a BA in International Relations from Brown University, combining Political Science, Economics, and History, enrolled briefly at Harvard University’s Kennedy School of Government, then moved to New York City to obtain an MBA in Finance from New York University, where he met his wife of over 35 years, Lily Ann Marden.\n\nGhahramani has three children, Julia (deceased), Gregory, and Kimberly. He was a founding Trustee and is a Member of the Board of Directors of the Iranian American Political Action Committee, based in Washington DC, a Non-Executive Director of Spectraxe, LLC, a privately-owned marketplace for OTC FX Options, and a Trustee of the Julia Ghahramani Foundation, a non-profit dedicated to the promotion of pro-bono legal work, youth advocacy, and human rights."
