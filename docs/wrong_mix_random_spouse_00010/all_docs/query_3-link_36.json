        "text": "Mohammed Reza Pahlavi (born 26th October 1919) is the Shah of the Imperial State of Iran.\n\nBiography\n\nMohammad Reza Pahlavi ascended to the Iranian throne in 1941, his father forced into abdication from the Soviet Union and the British Empire. International scholars have since argued that this was when the Shah first became sympathetic to the German Reich, two great empires bullied by the old European empires.\n\nThe decades since his ascension to the throne have seen the relationship between the Shah and his German friends grow ever closer, Germany making every effort to begin bringing Iran into their sphere following the war with all manner of recovery aid, international loans and military advisors. It was a relationship which was exposed to the world in August 1953 with the German orchestrated coup against then Prime Minister Mohammad Mosaddegh and the installation of a firmly pro-German government, with the Shah greatly empowered and openly welcoming the German Reich into Iran.\n\nYet whilst the Shah may now enjoy the power and luxuries worthy of a true monarch, to say that the ground beneath him is shaky would be a great understatement. Having lost the trust of the populace, the Iranian people take to the streets to demand all manner of reform, with an influx of German racial theory inflaming all manner of racial conflicts within Iran. So too have his German benefactors began to demand reform, preferring a more liberal Iran which may remain in their Sphere to one aflame. Now with the 2,500th aniversary of the Iranian monarchy imminent, the Shah is determined to ensure it can last for 2,500 years more."
