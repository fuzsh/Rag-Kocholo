The state-owned PKP Group operates the majority of rail services. In addition to PKP owned companies, there are a number of private cargo operators, as well as a number of independent passenger operators, with the latter owned predominantly by Voivodeship provincial governments.\n\nOverview\n\n[edit]\n\nThe vast majority of the network was built before World War II by various railway companies, including by the German Deutsche Reichsbahn and by the Russian Imperial State Railways, and a minor component was built from 1946 onwards by the Communist authorities of the Polish People's Republic. During the invasion of Poland at the beginning of World War II the Polish railway network was crippled by the Luftwaffe bombing campaign.[3] Due to the average age of the network and lack of maintenance, many sections are limited to speeds below 160 km/h (99 mph) even on trunk lines. 2,813 km (1,748 mi) allow 160 km/h (99 mph) or more.[4]\n\nSince Poland's entry into the European Union in 2004, major financing has been made available by European financing institutions to improve both the Polish rail network and the rolling stock fleet. Up to June 2014, the European Investment Bank had provided loans totalling €1.9 billion for rail modernization projects in Poland.[5][6] An additional €578 million had been provided through December 2013 to modernize 70 percent of PKP Intercity rolling stock.[7] The €665 million purchase of twenty Alstom Pendolino high-speed trains delivered in 2014 was financed in part by €342 million from the European Investment Bank.[8]\n\nPoland currently has no high-speed lines operated at speeds above 200 km/h (124 mph). The Central Rail Line, centralna magistrala kolejowa, 'CMK', which links Warsaw to Katowice and Kraków, was designed with an alignment to permit 250 km/h (155 mph), but for over 30 years after its construction Poland possessed no rolling stock capable of speeds above 160 km/h (99 mph). Since 2008 the CMK has been upgraded to allow higher speeds, including installation of European Train Control System Level 1 which provides the Cab signalling required by high speed trains. Most trains on the CMK still operate at speeds up to 160 km/h (99 mph), but since 14 December 2014 new Alstom Pendolino ED250 trains operate on a 90 km section of the CMK at 200 km/h (124 mph), and improvements under way should raise the authorized speed to 200 km/h (124 mph) on most of the line. In test runs on the CMK in November 2013 a new Pendolino ED250 train set a new Polish speed record of 293 km/h (182 mph).[9]\n\nIn 2011–2015 the Warsaw-Gdańsk-Gdynia railway line has undergone a major upgrading costing $3 billion, partly funded by the European Investment Bank, including track replacement, realignment of curves and relocation of sections of track to allow speeds up to 200 km/h (124 mph), modernization of stations, and installation of the most modern ETCS Level 2 signalling system, which is to be completed in June 2015. In December 2014 new Alstom Pendolino high-speed trains were put into service between Gdańsk, Warsaw and Kraków reducing the rail travel time from Gdańsk to Warsaw to 2 hours 58 minutes,[10][11] to be reduced in late 2015 to 2 hours 37 minutes.[12]\n\nIn 2008, the government announced the construction of a dedicated high speed line based on the French TGV model and possibly using TGV style trainsets, by 2020. The Y-shaped line would link Warsaw to Łódź, Poznań and Wrocław at speeds of up to 320 km/h (199 mph). The plans included an upgrade of the Central Rail Line to 250 km/h (155 mph) or more, as this line has an LGV-like profile. In December 2011 plans to build the high speed 'Y' line were postponed until 2030, due to the high cost.[13][14]\n\nSee also: High-speed rail in Poland\n\nAs of 2008, foreign services include EuroCity and EuroNight trains between Western and Eastern Europe, most notably the EN Jan Kiepura direct sleeping cars between Russia and Amsterdam, Basel and Munich via Warsaw, Poznan and Germany. They generally consist of coaches from different rail operators that are added to the train as it passes through their area of operation.\n\nUkraine - through Starzhava - reopened 2023 [15]\n\nUkraine - through Nyzhankovychi - reopened 2023 [15]\n\nVoltage of electrification systems may differ. The Polish voltage is 3 kV DC.\n\nSame gauge – 1,435 mm (4 ft 8+1⁄2 in):\n\nCzech Republic – same voltage\n\nGermany – 3 kV DC/15 kV AC\n\nSlovakia – same voltage\n\nSweden – by train ferry; proposed fixed links, one from Szczecin to Ystad via Bornholm Island, the other from Gdynia to Karlskrona, both with 15 kV AC and SE-C loading gauge (Voltage change 3 kV DC/15 kV AC on Polish side)[citation needed]\n\nBreak of gauge – 1,435 mm (4 ft 8+1⁄2 in)/1,520 mm (4 ft 11+27⁄32 in)\n\nBelarus – 3 kV DC/25 kV AC, a short stretch of dual-gauge track terminates at Grodno\n\nLithuania – 3 kV DC/25 kV AC, as part of the construction of Rail Baltica a new standard-gauge diesel line from there to Kaunas was built in October 2015\n\nRussia (Kaliningrad Oblast) – not electrified – there are short stretches of dual gauge sections around border area\n\nUkraine – 3 kV DC/25 kV AC\n\nBroad-gauge railways\n\n[edit]\n\nThe network is standard gauge except for the Linia Hutnicza Szerokotorowa (literally meaning \"Broad Gauge Metallurgy Line\", but typically known by its abbreviation LHS) and a few short stretches near border crossings. The LHS to Sławków is the longest broad-gauge line, single track, almost 400 km long, from the Ukrainian border just east of Hrubieszów. It is the westernmost broad gauge line connected to the system of the former Soviet Union.\n\nSince the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, there are proposed to build more broad-gauge lines in and around Poland.[16] Linia Hutnicza Szerokotorowa westward extension from Slawkow via Gliwice, Gorlitz, Jena, Paderborn and Oberhausen to Amsterdam and Rotterdam, and branch to Hamburg, and new broad-gauge link from Ukrainian border via Chelm, Lublin, Bialystok and Suwalki to Mockai (Lithuania) and branch to Gdansk Port.\n\nNarrow gauge railways\n\n[edit]\n\nOperators\n\n[edit]\n\nPKP Group\n\n[edit]\n\nPolish State Railways (PKP), a state-owned corporate group and part of the PKP Group conglomerate, is the main provider of railway services, holding an almost complete monopoly on long-distance passenger services. It is both supported and partly funded by the government.\n\nThere are three main PKP companies:\n\nPKP PLK – owns and maintains infrastructure including lines and stations.\n\nPKP Intercity – provides long-distance connections on the most popular routes. Trains are divided into the categories: EuroNight (EN), EuroCity (EC), Express InterCity (EIC), Express InterCity Premium (EIP) – generally faster and more expensive, InterCity (IC) and (TLK) (interregional fast trains, slower than EN/EC/EIC but cheaper) and international fast trains.\n\nPKP Cargo – provides cargo rail transport.\n\nNon-PKP operators\n\n[edit]\n\nWhile PKP is the largest rail operator in Poland, there are several independent operators of passenger and cargo railway services. Independent Cargo operators are predominantly privately owned. Passenger operators are predominantly owned by Voivodeship governments. These include:\n\nPolregio (formerly Przewozy Regionalne) – owned by regional authorities of the 16 voivodeships, formerly part of PKP Group. Operates local passenger trains (under the REGIO brand) financed by local governments, low-cost long-distance trains (interREGIO) and short-distance international trains jointly with DB Regio (REGIOekspres). Passenger trains are rather slow, mostly electric multiple units and diesel railcars/railbuses. InterREGIO trains are of slightly lower standard than TLK trains (no first class and dining cars), but are usually a bit cheaper. In June 2016, Lithuanian Railways and Przewozy Regionalne started weekend passenger train service between Bialystok and Kaunas in Lithuania.[17][18]\n\nDeutsche Bahn\n\nDB Regio connects from the border stations at Gorzów, Kostrzyn, Szczecin with the DB network with local trains (the Polish parts of their routes are generally operated by Przewozy Regionalne).\n\nArriva RP (a wholly owned subsidiary of Deutsche Bahn) is a regional operator on lines in the Kuyavian-Pomeranian and Pomeranian regions\n\nKoleje Dolnośląskie – a regional operator on a few lines in Lower Silesia.\n\nKoleje Małopolskie – a regional operator in the region of Kraków.\n\nKoleje Mazowieckie – a regional operator on all lines in Masovian Voivodeship, including Warsaw.\n\nKoleje Śląskie – a regional operator in the Silesian Voivodeship\n\nKoleje Wielkopolskie – a regional operator on a few lines in Greater Poland Voivodeship.\n\nŁódzka Kolej Aglomeracyjna – a commuter railway operator in the Łódź Voivodeship.\n\nRapid transit\n\n[edit]\n\nPKP Szybka Kolej Miejska in the Tri-city area, part of the PKP Group\n\nWarszawska Kolej Dojazdowa, a suburban railway in Warsaw and Western suburbs\n\nSzybka Kolej Miejska, a suburban city-owned network in Warsaw\n\nWarsaw Metro, an underground metro system in Warsaw, currently undergoing a period of expansion.\n\nFreight operators\n\n[edit]\n\nFreight services are provided by a number of private and public rail operators.
