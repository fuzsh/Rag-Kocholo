Derogations\n\n(1) The Minister may decide not to apply any TSI or part of any TSI in relation to parts of the railway system in the State forming part of the trans-European conventional railway system, in the following cases and circumstances:\n\n(a) For a proposed new line, for the upgrading of an existing line, or for any element referred to in Article 1(1) at an advanced stage of development or the subject of a contract in the course of performance when the relevant TSI is published.\n\n(b) For any project concerning the renewal or upgrading of an existing line where the loading gauge, track gauge, space between tracks, or electrification voltage in the relevant TSI is not compatible with those of the existing line.\n\n(c) For a proposed new line or for the proposed renewal or upgrading of an existing line in the State where the rail network in the State is not linked to, or is isolated by the sea from, the rail network of the rest of the Community.\n\n(d) For any proposed renewal, extension, or upgrading of an existing line, when the application of the relevant TSIs would compromise the economic viability of the project or the compatibility of the rail system of the State.\n\n(e) Where following an accident or a natural disaster, the conditions for the rapid restoration of the network do not economically or technically allow for partial or total application of the relevant TSIs.\n\n(2) In all cases referred to in paragraph (1) the Minister shall serve prior notice of any intended derogation to the Commission and shall forward to it a file setting out the TSIs or parts thereof that he or she does not wish to be applied as well as the corresponding specifications that the Minister does wish to be applied.\n\n(3) With reference to paragraph (2), the Minister shall comply with any decision or recommendation of the Commission made pursuant to Article 7.\n\n5. Interoperability constituents\n\n(1) No person who is the person responsible shall place on the market any interoperability constituent unless:\n\n(a) the interoperability constituent conforms to such European specifications as have been published in the Official Journal in relation to interoperability constituents of that type,\n\n(b) the interoperability constituent enables interoperability to be achieved within the trans-European conventional rail system,\n\n(c) the interoperability constituent, including interfaces, meets such of the relevant essential requirements as relate to an interoperability constituent of that type,\n\n(d) the appropriate conformity or suitability for use assessment procedures in respect of the interoperability constituent have been carried out, and\n\n(e) either an EC conformity declaration or an EC suitability declaration, or both (as the case may be) has been prepared in relation to the interoperability constituent by the person responsible in accordance with the requirements of Schedule 4 to these Regulations.\n\n(f) the interoperability constituent conforms to such TSIs that are relevant to an interoperability constituent of that type.\n\n(2) Compliance of an interoperability constituent with the essential requirements will be established with reference to relevant TSIs, including any relevant European specifications.\n\n(3) Where no European specifications referred to in paragraph 1(a) have been published, a person shall not place on the market an interoperability constituent unless it conforms to such standards and technical specifications relating to interoperability constituents of that type as may be notified by the Minister to the Commission pursuant to Article 10(5) of the Directive as being in use in the State,\n\n(4) Where there is a requirement to prepare a conformity declaration or suitability declaration (as the case may be) in relation to any interoperability constituent and that interoperability constituent is also subject to other requirements pursuant to a European Community Directive other than the Directive, the person who prepares that conformity declaration or suitability declaration shall state in that declaration whether or not the interoperability constituent in question meets those other requirements.\n\n(5) Where any of the requirements of paragraphs (1), (2) and (3) to be fulfilled by the manufacturer or his or her authorised representative in the State have not been fulfilled, such requirements shall be fulfilled by any person who: —\n\n(a) places that interoperability constituent on the market,\n\n(b) uses that interoperability constituent, or any part of it, in any interoperability constituent or subsystem that he or she is manufacturing or otherwise constructing, assembling, or in any subsystem he or she is constructing, upgrading, maintaining, renewing or operating, or\n\n(c) uses that interoperability constituent himself or herself as part of the trans-European conventional rail system.\n\n(6) Notwithstanding the provisions of this Regulation, interoperability constituents may be placed on the market for other purposes, including their use on conventional railway lines in the State.\n\n(7) Where an interoperability constituent, including interfaces, in respect of which a conformity declaration or suitability declaration has been drawn up, is placed on the market and, in the view of the Minister, it is unlikely to meet the essential requirements, the Minister shall take all necessary steps to restrict its field of application, prohibit its use, or withdraw it from the market and the Minister shall take appropriate measures against whomsoever has drawn up the declaration. The Minister shall inform the Commission and the other Member States of the measures that have been taken in respect of the interoperability constituent to restrict its field of application, prohibit its use, or withdraw it from the market and the reasons for taking those steps as specified in Article 12 and any measures taken against the person who drew up the conformity declaration or suitability declaration.\n\n(8) In relation to any interoperability constituent, the operator of that interoperability constituent shall ensure that while it is in use it is :-\n\n(a) correctly installed for the purpose for which it is intended,\n\n(b) not used for any purpose other than the purpose for which it was designed, and\n\n(c) suitably maintained.\n\n(9) A conformity declaration or suitability declaration shall be drawn up in accordance with Schedule 4.\n\n(10) There is no requirement to carry out checks on interoperability constituents if those checks have already been carried out in another Member State as part of the EC declaration of conformity or suitability for use as outlined in Article 13.\n\n(11) A person who contravenes this Regulation is guilty of an offence and is liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding €3000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 6 months, or both.\n\n6. Conformity assessment procedures for interoperability constituents\n\n(1) For the purposes of Regulation 5, the appropriate conformity or suitability for use assessment procedures in relation to an interoperability constituent shall be:-\n\n(a) the procedure specified:\n\n(i) in the TSI (if any) with which the interoperability constituent must comply, or\n\n(ii) by any relevant European specification (if any) with which the interoperability constituent must comply;\n\nor,\n\n(b) in the absence of such a TSI or such a European specification,\n\n(i) such conformity or suitability for use assessment procedure that is considered appropriate by the notified body, and\n\n(ii) the procedures set out in Schedule 4.\n\n(2) (a) Without prejudice to the provisions of Regulation 5, where a conformity declaration or suitability declaration has been drawn up improperly, the Minister may instruct the manufacturer or his or her authorised representative established within the State to ensure that such declaration be properly drawn up.\n\n(b) Where failure to properly draw up the declaration persists, the Minister may take appropriate steps to restrict or prohibit the placing on the market in the State of the interoperability constituent or to ensure that it is withdrawn from the market.\n\n7. Subsystems authorisation\n\n(1) No person shall place into service on the rail system in the State forming part of the trans-European conventional rail system a structural subsystem that he or she has constructed, upgraded or renewed unless the Minister has given an authorisation for the placing into service of that subsystem.\n\n(2) An application for an authorisation under paragraph (1) shall be made in writing to the Minister and, in relation to the structural subsystem, be accompanied by: -\n\n(a) the certificate of conformity,\n\n(b) the technical file, and\n\n(c) the verification declaration.\n\n(3) The Minister shall not issue an authorisation for the placing into service of a structural subsystem unless he or she is satisfied that: —\n\n(a) the verification declaration has been drawn up in accordance with Schedule 5,\n\n(b) the technical file is complete, and\n\n(c) the structural subsystem has been designed, constructed, and installed in such a way as to meet the essential requirements concerning that subsystem and to ensure that it is compatible with the rail systems into which it is being integrated.\n\n(4) The Minister shall not refuse to give an authorisation for placing into service of a structural subsystem if it: —\n\n(a) satisfies the conditions set out in paragraphs 3(a) and 3(b); and\n\n(b) meets the essential requirements relating to the structural subsystem.\n\n(5) Subject to paragraph (6), after receiving an application for an authorisation under paragraph (2), the Minister may require the applicant to carry out any additional checks which the Minister considers necessary in relation to the structural subsystem if that subsystem appears to the Minister not to meet the requirements of Regulations 9(4) and 9(8).\n\n(6) There is no requirement to carry out checks on structural subsystems that have already been carried out in another Member State as part of the EC declaration of conformity or suitability for use as outlined in Article 13.\n\n(7) After receiving an application for authorisation under paragraph (2) the Minister shall either: —\n\n(i) authorise the placing into service of the structural subsystem,\n\n(ii) inform the contracting entity that additional checks will be required pursuant to paragraph (5) before the application can be considered further, or\n\n(iii) refuse the request for authorisation.\n\n(8) Subject to Regulation 4 a structural subsystem that is placed into service must conform with any TSI relating to that subsystem which has been published in the Official Journal.\n\n(9) In the case of a structural subsystem where:-\n\n(a) a TSI has not been published in the Official Journal in respect of that subsystem,\n\n(b) a published TSI does not govern all elements of that subsystem, or\n\n(c) a derogation has been granted pursuant to Regulation 4 in respect of that subsystem,\n\nthat subsystem must conform to such technical rules in use in the State, if any, for implementing essential requirements as may be notified by the Minister to the Commission pursuant to Article 16(3) and must meet such of the requirements as relate to that type of subsystem.\n\n(10) Without prejudice to Article 19, the Minister may not prohibit, restrict or hinder the construction, placing in service, and operation of structural subsystems forming, or intended to form, part of the trans-European conventional rail system in the State where such subsystems comply with the essential requirements.\n\n(11) When a structural subsystem is placed into service in accordance with these Regulations, the Minister shall carry out, or cause to be carried out, periodic checks to ensure that it is operated and maintained in compliance with the relevant essential requirements.\n\n(12) The activities and duties of a notified body responsible for the EC verification of a subsystem, as set out in Schedule 6, shall begin at the design stage and shall cover all of the manufacturing period up to the type-approval stage before a subsystem is placed in service and shall also cover verification of the interfaces of the subsystem with the system into which it is incorporated.\n\n(13) A person who contravenes this Regulation is guilty of an offence and is liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding £3000 or to a term of imprisonment not exceeding 6 months, or both.\n\n8. Subsystems verification procedures\n\n(1) For the purposes of these Regulations, the appropriate verification assessment procedure in relation to a structural subsystem shall be -\n\n(a) insofar as that subsystem is required to conform with part or all of a TSI, the procedures specified in the TSI or part of the TSI with which it is required to conform;\n\n(b) insofar as that structural subsystem is required to conform with notified standards, such procedures as the notified body considers appropriate to assess that structural subsystem against the notified standards with which it is required to conform;\n\nand in either case,\n\n(c) the procedures set out in Schedule 6.\n\n(2) The relevant notified body shall compile the technical file.\n\n(3) Where a contracting entity has already commenced work on the construction, upgrade, or renewal of a structural subsystem prior to the commencement of these Regulations, a notified body may, with the agreement of the contracting entity and having regard to documentation or other evidence produced by the contracting entity in respect of that work, decide that there is no need for it to assess the work that was carried out prior to its notification as a notified body. In such circumstances, the notified body need not assess that work.\n\n(4) Where a relevant TSI permits non-compliance with part or all of its provisions on the basis that compliance with those provisions would result in the structural subsystem being technically incompatible with the existing railway system in which it is to be placed into service, the Minister may exempt that subsystem from the relevant provisions.\n\n9. Duties of a contracting entity\n\n(1) This regulation applies where a contracting entity -\n\n(a) is intending to contract with another person for the design, manufacture, or construction by that other person of a structural subsystem,\n\n(b) is proposing that it design, manufacture, or construct a structural subsystem,\n\n(c) has contracted with another person for the design, manufacture or construction of a structural subsystem, or\n\n(d) has itself commenced work on the design, manufacture or construction of a structural subsystem.\n\n(2) The contracting entity may select a notified body in relation to the structural subsystem in question -\n\n(a) forthwith, when contracting with another person who is to design the structural subsystem,\n\n(b) before selecting or completing the design for the structural subsystem, where he or she is designing that structural subsystem\n\n(3) Where the contracting entity selects a notified body under paragraph (2), that contracting entity shall ensure that a notified body (whether that originally appointed or another) continues to be appointed in relation to the structural subsystem in question until authorisation pursuant to Regulation 7 is given.\n\n(4) The contracting entity shall ensure that the structural subsystem conforms to all relevant TSIs, except where -\n\n(a) there are no relevant TSIs,\n\n(b) the relevant TSI does not govern all elements of the structural subsystem,\n\n(c) the structural subsystem is not required to conform to the whole or part of a relevant TSI pursuant to a derogation under Regulation 4, or\n\n(d) an exemption has been granted by the Minister in accordance with Regulation 8(4).\n\n(5) The contracting entity shall ensure that the structural subsystem, or part of the structural subsystem, not governed by any relevant TSI conforms with any notified standards that relate to it.\n\n(6) Where a relevant TSI permits non-conformity with part or all of its provisions on the basis that conformity with those provisions would result in the structural subsystem being technically incompatible with the existing railway system in which it is to be placed into service, a contracting entity may apply to the Minister for an exemption from those provisions.\n\n(7) Provided that the contracting entity has ensured that the requirements of paragraphs (4) and (8) are satisfied, he or she shall draw up a verification declaration in relation to the structural subsystem in accordance with the procedure required by Schedule 5.\n\n(8) For the purposes of paragraph (7) a structural subsystem must:\n\n(a) meet such essential requirements as relate to that type of structural subsystem,\n\n(b) have the appropriate verification assessment procedure carried out in accordance with Regulation 8,\n\n(c) have a certificate of conformity drawn up in accordance with the procedures required by schedule 6, and\n\n(d) have a technical file prepared in respect of it containing the information and documents required by paragraph (4) of schedule 6.\n\n10. Screening decisions\n\n(1) Before commencing major works, or entering into a contract with another person for major works to carried out, on an existing structural subsystem, a contracting entity shall, unless satisfied that those works constitute upgrading or renewal of any part of the rail system in the State forming part of the trans-European conventional rail system, make a request in writing to the Minister for a decision as to whether or not those works constitute upgrading or renewal of any part of the rail system in the State forming part of the trans-European conventional rail system.
