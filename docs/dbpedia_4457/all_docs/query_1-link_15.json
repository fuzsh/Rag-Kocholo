        "text": "FROM MAGRAIL TO HYPERLOOP\n\nUnique magnetic railway technology\n\nWe have developed a unique technology for a MagRail system - a passive magnetic levitation train operating on existing railway tracks at speeds up to 550 kph (340 mph). This hybrid solution allows for the functionality of both the MagRail system and conventional trains on the same tracks. Our ultimate goal - hyperloop will require new dedicated infrastructure. It will enable the vehicles to travel at up to 1,200 kph (746 mph).\n\nHyperloop is a cross between a train and an airplane. It will enable travel between Frankfurt and Berlin in 30 minutes, traveling near the speed of sound. The pod moves in a special tube, in which air pressure is as low as it is at an altitude of 10 km, which greatly reduces air resistance. It travels without contact with the tunnel using magnetic levitation.\n\nWe spend an increasing amount of time moving around, and thanks to Nevomo’s technologies we can become more efficient in the use of our most precious commodity - time."
