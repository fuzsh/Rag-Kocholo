        "text": "We’re trying to book train reservations for travel in Poland. The planner states reservations are compulsory, but there seems no way of booking them. We’ve looked at both the DB and PKP websites, but neither gives the possibility of buying reservations. Which leaves us wondering what to do.\n\nWe’re planning to travel from Berlin to Warsaw, having traveled from Brussels earlier in the day. No reservation is necessary for the leg between Berlin and Frankfurt Oder, however reservations are necessary once we enter Poland. We could buy train tickets, but that’s silly already having an Interrail ticket. Can anyone offer advice about what we do?\n\nThanks for your help"
