        "text": "Visit FRMCS website:\n\nhttps://uicfrmcs.org\n\nWhat is FRMCS, the Future Railway Mobile Communication System?\n\nGeneral context\n\nThe European railways currently use the GSM-R system for operational communication, a key component of the European Railway Traffic Management System ERTMS.\n\nDesigned 20+ years ago by UIC and completely border-crossing interoperable, GSM-R, which is a 2G+ based system, is deployed on more than 130,000 kilometers of track in Europe (with 90.000 activated On Board Cab Radio’s), and some 210,000 kilometers worldwide.\n\nThe Future Radio Mobile Communication System (FRMCS) is the Railways response for two elements of strategic importance for the future of the railways:\n\nFirst – the fast-coming GSM-R obsolescence, which is European level risk for Railways ERTMS continuity (2035);\n\nSecond - it is also a significant opportunity, which is to enable and support the Railways Digitalization, and therefore the need to transmit, receive and use increasing volumes of data, which is at the very heart of sustainable transport.\n\nThese considerations led UIC to launch the studies for a successor to GSM-R, pertinently named Future Rail Mobile Communications System (FRMCS), and to put in place ta solid organisation capable to build the FRMCS specifications, and also to monitor and involve directly in the relevant activities related to FRMCS introduction.\n\nThe UIC FRMCS activity is governed via below working groups:\n\nThe FRMCS Steering Group leads the global FRMCS strategy and planning,\n\nThe FRMCS Functionality Working Group (FWG) ensures the adequate matching between system functionalities and railway needs,\n\nThe FRMCS Architecture and Technology Group Working Group (ATWG) has the mission to define the FRMCS architectures, and the system requirements,\n\nThe FRMCS Telecom On-Board Architecture has the mission to define the On-Board FRMCS that uses the acronym (TOBA architecture) and functional requirements.\n\nThe UIC Group for Frequency Aspects (UGFA) takes care of the expected needs for spectrum, particularly sensitive in the transition scenarios.\n\nFRMCS FIS (Functional Interface Specifications), defining the call flows to determine any gaps or inconsistencies,\n\nFRMCS FFFIS (Form-Fit-Functional Interface specification), defining the On Board and Track Side Applications interface, responsible with the definition of the FRMCS border interface specifications,\n\nThese working groups are interfaced with UNITEL, ERA, and ETSI TC RT.\n\nThe missions of these groups also encompass the following key activities:\n\nBuild and deliver the FRMCS specifications:\n\nFRMCS FRS\n\nFRMCS SRS\n\nFRMCS TOBA FRS\n\nFRMCS FIS\n\nFRMCS FFFIS\n\nObtain dedicated frequencies for FRMCS in Europe\n\nThe build and delivery of the FRMCS Specifications follows the European Process, as they are meant to be introduced in CCS TSI.\n\nThe FRMCS specifications will be completed with ETSI Technical specifications, delivered by the ETSI Railway Telecom technical committee.\n\nThe current FRMCS introduction situation is:\n\nFRMCS Frequencies (additional to GSM-R) have been secured in Europe, see ECC (20) 02.\n\nVersion 1 (V1) of the FRMCS Specifications have been finalized following the UIC and ERA Change -Control – management processes.\n\n2023 CCS TSI have included:\n\nFRMCS introduced as GSM-R successor.\n\nGSM-R and FRMCS are considered together as the railway Mobile Radio System(s) – RMR\n\nFRMCS will work in coexistence with GSM-R (until somewhere 2035)\n\nThe FRMCS specifications are introduced within the TSI Annex A\n\nV1 specifications are included within this page. As already mentioned in the CCS TSI, they are for now not considered for procuring products.\n\nNext steps for the FRMCS introduction have been agreed with DG Move. EU-Rail JU and ERA.

With this in mind, the UIC has been exploring the worldwide application of FRMCS.\n\nHowever, certain countries may face challenges in accessing the 5G framework and technologies due to factors such as unavailability or high cost of 5G spectrum, national 5G development schedules, and the cost of owning 5G technologies.\n\nThese countries might also encounter early migration constraints and time-to-market issues. To address these challenges, a specific Technical Guideline, known as FRMCS-Transition (“FRMCS-T”), was developed.\n\nFRMCS – Transition, Technical Guidelines\n\n- PDF - 683.9 kb\n\nView"
