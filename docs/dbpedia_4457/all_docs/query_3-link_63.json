        "text": "The European co-operation for Accreditation (EA) has been appointed by the European Commission (EC) as the official European accreditation infrastructure. The appointment of EA follows the adoption of Regulation (EC) No 765/2008 by the European Parliament and the European Council which establishes the legal framework for accreditation in the EU and sets out the requirements for accreditation.\n\nThis regulation came into effect from 1st January 2010.\n\nThe Regulation promotes a harmonized approach to accreditation in the EU Member States so that, ultimately, one accredited certificate (or report) should be sufficient to demonstrate the technical competence of the accredited Conformity Assessment Bodies.\n\nThis is how the concept “accredited once, accepted everywhere” works.\n\nCooperation between EA and the European authorities is based on the General Guidelines for Cooperation. These Guidelines establish a common understanding of the importance of accreditation for the European economy and life of European citizens and of its supporting role for several European policies and legislation reflecting public interest, notably in the implementation of Community harmonisation legislation.\n\nEA and the EC cooperate very closely to draw up sound and effective regulations. The main communication channel is the Directorate-General for Internal Market, Industry, Entrepreneurship and SMEs (DG GROW), which is a Member of the EA Advisory Board and observer of the Multilateral Agreement Council and Horizontal Harmonization Committee. Representatives of EC DG GROW are also invited to attend the EA General Assembly meetings.\n\nEA maintains close relationships and provides technical expertise to other Directorate-Generals and various Agencies of the EC. For further information, click here.\n\nRecently, EA has started to develop new services to assist the EC in negotiating trade agreements. The role of EA is to ensure that the technical content of the agreements gives confidence to all parties ensuring real and sustainable mutual benefit while offering sustainable opportunities for growth to European CABs and Industry. The Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement with Canada (CETA) is an example.\n\nThe Regulation identifies the European co-operation for Accreditation (EA) as the sole association entrusted to manage accreditation at European level and defines its responsibilities and obligations in this respect. It places an obligation on EU Member States to accept the results issued by the Conformity Assessment Bodies accredited by any of the EA MLA signatories.\n\nIt is part of the “New European Legislative Framework” (NLF) that significantly contributed to the development of the Single Market. The NLF provides transparent rules for the accreditation of Conformity Assessment Bodies. This common legal framework enhances the quality and confidence in the products placed on the EU Market, based on a harmonized approach of conformity assessment.\n\nThe success of the European standardisation system in removing technical barriers to trade plays a vital role in ensuring the free movement of goods between EU Member States.\n\nIncluded in the legislation are requirements regarding the assessment of Conformity Assessment Bodies applying for notification. A Notified Body, in the European Union, is a Conformity Assessment Body that has been formally appointed by a national authority to assess whether a product, its design or its manufacture meet certain standards – usually those relating to specific European regulations or directives.\n\nThe process of achieving notification has changed such that accreditation is now the preferred route by which a Conformity Assessment Body demonstrates its competence to become a Notified Body. EA is working continuously to support and harmonise the implementation of the rules for Conformity Assessment Bodies seeking accreditation for notification purposes.\n\nEA-2/17 EA Document on Accreditation for Notification purposes reflects the outcome of the so-called “Accreditation for Notification” project which aims to determine the list of Preferred Conformity Assessment Standards for each Regulation/Directive and Module. The identified standards are meant to be used by EA Members as an EA recommendation for Notified Bodies’ accreditation.\n\nIt is important that National Accreditation Bodies (NAB) maintain the confidence of all stakeholders and regulators. This is why they are themselves regularly assessed by their peers in order to ensure their technical competency and impartiality. This peer evaluation process must remain transparent and accepted by all, including national authorities, and tailored to accommodate the specific needs of regulatory sectors.\n\nGeneral Guidelines for Cooperation: on 1 April 2009, the General Guidelines for the Cooperation between EA, the EC, EFTA, and competent national authorities were signed. These Guidelines establish a common understanding of the importance of accreditation for the European economy and life of European citizens and of its supporting role for several European policies and legislation reflecting public interest, notably in the implementation of Community harmonisation legislation. Click HERE to read the General Guidelines for Cooperation\n\nFramework Partnership Agreements: every four years, EA, the European Commission (EC) and the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) sign an agreement, called the Framework Partnership Agreement (FPA). The FPA defines the respective roles and responsibilities of the EC/EFTA and EA in implementing their partnerships. Every year, EA and the EC/EFTA agree on an annual action plan and the associated budget supported by EC and EFTA financing.\n\nEU Emission Trading System (ETS)\n\nThe EU ETS is a cornerstone of the EU’s policy to fight climate change and one of the key tools for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The monitoring and reporting of greenhouse gas emissions must thereby be robust, transparent, consistent, and accurate for EU ETS to operate effectively.\n\nAs a result, in 2015, EA extended its Multilateral Agreement (EA MLA) to the new scope “Greenhouse Gas Validation and Verification” after having signed a specific agreement with the Directorate-General Climate Action of the European Commission in August 2013 for the implementation of accreditation and peer evaluation of EA National Accreditation Bodies (NAB) according to EN ISO 14065 and Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 600/2012.\n\nTo date, 25 EA Members are signatories to the EA MLA for the scope GHG Validation and Verification with 188 accreditations valid at the end of 2023 (Source: EA survey – January 2024).\n\nMoreover, to facilitate collaboration with DG CLIMA, EA has established the EU ETS Network Group, to provide regular input to the updates of current regulations to enhance the position of National Accreditation Bodies (NAB) so they are more harmonized and effective in initiating improvements. As an example, EA is involved in the discussions regarding the revision of the EU ETS Monitoring and Reporting Regulation (MRR: Commission Regulation (EU) No. 601/2012, now replaced by Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No. 2018/2066) and EU ETS Accreditation and Verification Regulation (AVR, Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 600/2012, now replaced by Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No. 2018/2067).\n\nFor further information:\n\nEU Emission Trading System (EU ETS)\n\nTo access the list of NABs that have successfully undergone peer evaluation for accreditation of verifiers, and whose accreditation certificates delivered to accredited verifiers shall be accepted by the Member States (which shall respect the right of verifiers to carry out the verification for their scope of accreditation), select the scope “Validation and Verification” by clicking on “Enter any keyword or choose in the list below” on the following page.\n\nEU system for Monitoring, Reporting, and Verification of CO2 emissions from maritime transport (EU MRV Shipping) System\n\nFollowing the requirement for companies (shipowners) to submit a monitoring plan for each ship to the verifiers by August 2017 and from 2019 each year by the end of April to submit a verified emissions report to the Commission, the first verifiers were accredited in 2017. The scope of accreditation covers the assessment of monitoring plans and the verification of emissions reports.\n\nDuring the second reporting year, covering 2021 data, more than 11,700 ships owned by more than 1,600 companies were involved in the system. Verification activities were performed by 20 accredited verifiers.1\n\nNational Accreditation Bodies (NAB) that have successfully undergone peer evaluation for accreditation of verifiers, and providing the service for accreditation of Verification Bodies for assessment of monitoring plans and verification of emissions reports according to Regulation (EU) 2015/757 and Delegated Regulation (EU) 2023/2917 can be found in the following link.\n\n1Fourth Annual Report from the European Commission on CO2 Emissions from Maritime Transport (period 2018-2021)"
