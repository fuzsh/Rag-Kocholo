In railways, the liberalization concept has arrived late but is rapidly expanding, pushing different companies to do their best to acquire and retain customers, who can benefit of the presence of many operators The liberalization conceptThe liberalization concept\n\n7. 7 The railways are then no more an “unicum”; different “players” are present: •the infrastructure manager: one public Company in charge to manage the whole rail network, its assets, systems, rules,… •the rail undertakings: some public and private Com- panies capable to supply, in competion among them, passengers and freight services by using and paying the infrastructure facilities The new organizationThe new organization\n\n8. 8 The interoperability is the capability of the railway system to allow the safe and uninterrupted circulation of the trains on the lines of different Countries ensuring the requested performances This capability is based on a “set” of the regulatory, technical and operational conditions to be respected in order to satisfy the essential requirements (technical compatibility, safety, reliability and availability, environ- mental protection, health) The interoperability notionThe interoperability notion\n\n9. 99 The liberalization and the consequent competition could have result in a lower safety level: to avoid it, the European Commission has defined and issued: •common norms, rules and standards •a new “scheme”, indicating the different actors in-volved in the process (infrastructure managers, rail operators, national safety agencies, suppliers, and recognized bodies) and their specific commitments and responsibilities •homogeneous evaluation procedure The road map…The road map…\n\n10. 10 The common rulesThe common rules • Directives: individuate the subsystems and precise the relative essential requirements • Technical specifications of Interoperability: fix the basic parameters and define the specifications to be fulfilled in order to satisfy the essential requirements • EN normes: costitute the technical documents to be applied and referred to\n\n11. 11 1991/440: Development of the European railways 1996/48: Interoperability of the trans-European high speed railways system 2001/13: Authorization to the Railways Undertakings 2001/14: Infrastructure Capability and Safety Certificate 2001/16: Interoperability of the trans-European conventional railways system 2004/49: European railways safety 2008/57: Interoperability of the whole railway system (recast of the 96/48 and 01/16) 2009/131: Modifications to the annex 7 of the Directive 08/57 2009/149 Modifications to the 04/49 2011/18: Modifications to the 08/57 2012/34: Institution of an European common space 2013/9: Modifications to the annex 7 of the Directive 08/57 The main DirectivesThe main Directives\n\n12. 12 The Technical Specifications of Interoperability (TSI) define the specific requirements, rules, procedures, norms,… to be applied in order to ensure the trains running across the Europe without any problem They are divided in three different categories: •High Speed TSI •Conventional TSI •Common TSI The Technical Specifications for InteroperabilityThe Technical Specifications for Interoperability\n\n13. 13 High Speed TSI •Energy •Operation •Infrastructure •Maintenance •Rolling Stock Conventional TSI •Telematic applications for freight •Energy •Operation •Infrastructure •Noise Common TSI •Telematic applications for passengers •Control/Command & Signalling •Operation •Persons with Reduced Mobility •Safety in Railway Tunnels TheThe T.S.I.T.S.I.\n\n14. 14 • EN 50126: the specification and demonstration of Reliability, Availability, Maintainability and Safety (RAMS) • EN 50129: the safety demonstration by means of the “Safety case” • EN 50128: the subset of the EN 50129 specifically dedicated to the software. • EN 50124-1: the clearances and creepage distances for electrical and electronic equipments • EN 50121: the electromagnetic compatibility • EN 14198: the requirements for the brake system of trains hauled by a locomotive • EN 14363: testing for the acceptance of running characteristics of railway vehicles • EN …….
