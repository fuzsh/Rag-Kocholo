Specification of the ATBEC track signal\n\nChapter 2. ATBEG functions\n\n2.1. Definitions\n\nFor the purposes of this Chapter:\n\nadequate action: a reduction in the speed of the driver in the case of a brake command.\n\n2.1.1. Functional conditions in ATBEG area\n\nThe railway vehicle has the following functional conditions when driving on the 'first generation of sections' in relation to the requirements of this chapter:\n\n1. 'stand-by': no cab is operated on the train. The speed monitor, if no cabin operator is not, is not an ATB function;\n\n2. 'switched off': the train is operated, but no speed monitoring is possible as the initiation of a inhibition by the ATB is not possible or has been created. At ATB-EG (fase3), ATB-EG (fase4), ATBNG and ATBL-NL, this is done by closing the brake brake shutter;\n\n3. 'BD': ATBEG does not monitor the speed (out of service);\n\n4. 'I': ATBEG initiates inhibition (intervention);\n\n5. 'Const' means the monitoring of a constant speed (indicated by the ATB code contained in the runway);\n\n6. 'REM' means the monitoring of the speed indicated by ATB code on the track after an exchange of code.\n\nChart\n\nThe figures in the chart refer to the transition numbers in Section 2.2 of this Annex. The priority of the transitions is determined by the numbering (a lower number means a higher priority).\n\nIn the case of transition, the following applies:\n\n1. all the times that are measured for activating a function are set to zero (reset all timers). This also means that functions which at the time of the transition have not been started by the end of a specified time will no longer be started on the basis of the old conditions (timers will be interrupted by a condition transition);\n\n2. The display of an occasional acoustic signal with a specified length ('gong ',' losbel 'and' BD signal ') shall not be interrupted by transitions or any change. Continuous auditory signals ('brake bubble ') are degraded as soon as the conditions expire.\n\n2.2. Features\n\nThe installed system of automatic train influence performs ATB functions, which vary according to functional condition. A table of functions per functional condition is set out in section 2.2.9.\n\n2.2.1. Multiple conditions\n\nRequirement No\n\nDescription\n\nTransition\n\nDescription\n\n2.2.2.

This is combined with the requirement that this train composition has at least 6 axles (of which the middle 2 per 6 axles may be interrupted but electrically connected) with an axle load of not less than 6 tons or with a minimum of 4 axles with a minimum of 4 axles with a minimum of 6 axles. A minimum axle load of 18 tonnes.\n\nMeasured short-circuit behaviour\n\nA track vehicle composition shall be allowed if 10 measured short-closing values remain in a measurement section below the monthly standard.

The jamming detector only generates a power-off command after the threshold has been continuously exceeded for a specified length of time.\n\nFor the calculation of the power off command, TPR emulation shall be taken into account according to '30% algorithm';\n\n5 °. the jamming detector in the case of a defect provides for the blocking or bridging of the power-off command; and\n\n6 °. the jamming detector has a reaction time of not more than 500 ms.

The operation of the jamming detector and the present measuring chain shall be automatically checked at the start of the train.\n\nThe requirement 4 ° referred to in the first paragraph indicates that the TPR emulation may be taken into account in the calculation of the jamming command of the jamming detector according to the 30% algorithm.\n\nThe 30% algorithm is used in the MeMo monitoring locations to distinguish between transients belonging to a switch phenomenon and interfering flows that are present for a longer period of time. The 30% algorithm is an emulation of the TR behavior and the usually-behind delayed attracting TPR relays. A TPR can only stay up if the TR relay stays up 70% of the time for 1 s. The following algorithm is used on the MeMo monitor locations.\n\n1. The (raw) measured AC component of the line current in a treinstel is filtered using a tape filter. The characteristics of this filter are described in Annex 6 Table 1;\n\n2. The effective value (RMS) of the outcome is determined every 20ms;\n\n3. Then, a sliding window, with a length of 1 second, or 50 samples of the RMS values, is applied;\n\n4. The values within this window are sorted in ascending size. The value that is found at 30% of the window (i.e. the 30/100 * 50 = 15th value in the sorted dates is then the '30th percentile');\n\n5. The maximum value of all windows is determined and that is then the value reported as 30th percentile;\n\nThe figure below shows this schematic:\n\nWhen used in a jamming detector requiring only a pre-defined boundary to be checked, steps 4 and 5 can be simplified until testing or more than 30 of the 50 samples are given the criterion in Table 1 exceeding.\n\nRequirements for electrical compatibility between track vehicles and train detection systems\n\nFor the requirements for electrical compatibility between rail vehicles and train detection systems, reference is made to EN 50238-1 and CLC/TS 50238-2:2010.\n\nAs an addition, for compatibility studies of the train detection system as mentioned in paragraphs 7.1.2 and 7.1.3 of CLC/TS 50238-2:2010, all normal conditions, such as:\n\n-power limitation based on line voltage; and\n\n-a second railway vehicle which operates on the same line and produces flows within the limits set out in this arrangement.\n\nAs far as applicable to journeys with 1500 V DC running parallel to tracks below 25 kV AC, paragraph 5.4.2 of CLC/TS 50238-2:2010 shall be supplemented and adapted for the purpose of Article 17 (b), (g) and (h) of this Arrangement.
