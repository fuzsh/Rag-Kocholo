        "text": "Conformity verification, according to the Interoperability Directive (EU) 2016/797 and the Technical Specifications for Interoperability, is provided for high-speed and conventional rail systems, and also for subsystems and relevant components.\n\nThe main objective of the EC verification is the creation of the interoperability of the railway sector, which can be achieved by implementing technical construction and management standards which are the same throughout Europe, and also transposed into national law by the vast majority of Member States.\n\nThe activity is carried out in accordance with the RINA governance model, which safeguards impartiality and prevents conflict of interest situations.\n\nTechnical focus\n\nEC Verification applies to the following subsystems:\n\nrolling stock: trains, locomotives and wagons\n\ninfrastructure: track layout, civil works (like tunnels and bridges),passengers stations\n\nenergy: substations and contact line\n\nsignalling: all equipment for safe control of train operation\n\nGSM-R: radio-communication between trains and control centres\n\ncomponents: wheels, couplers, pantograph, contact strip, rails, sleepers, fastening systems, ERTMS and GSM-R equipment (Eurobalise, Euroloop, Radio Block Center).\n\nDeliverables\n\nThe EC verification process generally consists of three phases:\n\ndesign examination\n\ntest witnessing\n\ntest report validation.\n\nWhy RINA?\n\nRINA is notified for the third part certification according to Interoperability Directive. Our teams have a huge technical experience, which ranges from the high speed railway system solutions to the regional trains and freight wagons.\n\nWe can offer a tailored approach to specific projects, in order to give flexible solutions, with the support of strong teams of professional, dedicated to each of the subsystems to deal with."
