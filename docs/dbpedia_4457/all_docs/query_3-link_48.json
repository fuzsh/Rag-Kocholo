        "text": "The 4th Railway Package is a set of legislative texts aimed to complete the single market for rail services (Single European Railway Area). Its objective is to further strengthen the rail sector in Europe and make it more efficient and therefore competitive compared to other modes of transport.\n\nThe package includes two pillars, one technical and one market-related. The technical pillar, which was adopted by the European Parliament and the Council in April 2016, is based on the latest interoperability directive (EU 2016/797), which aims to create an optimal level of technical harmonization for international rail transport within the EU.\n\nThis accreditation will enable us to issue conformity assessment certification for Technical Specifications of Interoperability (TSI) as specified by the directive for rail systems and sub-systems, such as infrastructure, control-command and signaling, rolling stock, traffic management, etc.\n\nWim van Loon, Executive Vice President, Industrial, said: “Hard work and commitment by the SGS management and technical teams has been paramount for this significant achievement, which positions SGS as a leading TIC company in the rail industry worldwide.
