        "text": "Directive 1996/48 - Interoperability of the trans-European high-speed rail system - Main contents\n\nAvis juridique important\n\n|\n\nCouncil Directive 96/48/EC of 23 July 1996 on the interoperability of the trans-European high-speed rail system\n\nOfficial Journal L 235 , 17/09/1996 P. 0006 - 0024\n\nCOUNCIL DIRECTIVE 96/48/EC of 23 July 1996 on the interoperability of the trans-European high-speed rail system\n\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\nHaving regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular the third paragraph of Article 129d thereof,\n\nHaving regard to the proposal from the Commission (1),\n\nHaving regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (2),\n\nHaving regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions (3),\n\nActing in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 189c (4),\n\nWhereas in order to enable citizens of the Union, economic operators and regional and local authorities to benefit to the full from the advantages deriving from establishing an area without internal frontiers, it is advisable, in particular, to improve the interlinking and interoperability of national high-speed train networks, as well as access thereto;\n\nWhereas a high-level working party consisting of representatives of the governments of the Member States, of the European railways and of the European railway industry convened by the Commission in order to meet the request expressed by the Council in its resolution of 4 and 5 December 1989 drew up the master plan for a European high-speed train network;\n\nWhereas in December 1990 the Commission sent to the Council a communication on the high-speed train network, and whereas the Council gave a favourable reception to that communication in its resolution of 17 December 1990 (5);\n\nWhereas Article 129c of the Treaty provides that the Community shall implement any measures that may prove necessary to ensure network interoperability, in particular in the field of technical standardization;\n\nWhereas the commercial operation of high-speed trains requires excellent compatibility between the characteristics of the infrastructure and those of the rolling stock; whereas performance levels, safety, quality of service and cost depend upon such compatibility as does, in particular, the interoperability of the European high-speed rail system;\n\nWhereas pursuant to Council Directive 91/440/EEC of 29 July 1991 on the development of the Community's railways (6) railway companies must have increased access to the rail networks of the Member States, which in turn requires infrastructure, equipment and rolling stock interoperability;\n\nWhereas the Member States are responsible for ensuring compliance with the safety, health and consumer protection rules applying to the railway networks in general during the design, construction, placing in service and operation of those railways; whereas, together with the local authorities, they also have responsibilities in respect of rights in land, regional planning and environmental protection; whereas that is also especially pertinent with regard to high-speed train networks;\n\nWhereas Council Directive 85/337/EEC of 27 June 1985 on the assessment of the effects of certain public and private projects on the environment (7) requires an assessment of the impact on the environment of the construction of lines for long-distance rail traffic;\n\nWhereas national regulations and the railways' internal rules and the technical specifications which the railways apply contain major differences; whereas those national regulations and internal rules incorporate techniques that are specific to the national industries; whereas they prescribe specific dimensions and devices and special characteristics; whereas this situation runs counter to high-speed trains being able to run normally throughout Community territory;\n\nWhereas, over the years, this situation has created very close links between the national railway industries and the national railways, to the detriment of the genuine opening-up of contracts; whereas, in order to enhance their competitiveness at world level those industries require an open, competitive European market;\n\nWhereas it is therefore appropriate to define essential requirements for the whole of the Community which will apply to the trans-European high-speed train system;\n\nWhereas, in view of the extent and complexity of the trans-European high-speed rail system, it has proved necessary for practical reasons to break it down into subsystems; whereas for each of those subsystems the essential requirements must be specified, the basic parameters laid down and the technical specifications determined for the whole of the Community, particularly in respect of constituents and interfaces, in order to meet those essential requirements; whereas, however, certain subsystems (environment, users and operation) will be subject to technical specifications for interoperability (TSIs) only in so far as is necessary to ensure interoperability in the fields of infrastructure, energy, control-and-command and signalling and rolling-stock;\n\nWhereas the introduction of provisions on the interoperability of the trans-European high-speed rail system must not create unjustified cost-benefit barriers to the preservation of the existing rail network of each Member State, but must endeavour to maintain the objective of the circulation of high-speed trains throughout the Community;\n\nWhereas individual Member States should be allowed not to apply certain technical specifications for interoperability in specific cases, provided that there are procedures to ensure that such possibilities for derogation are justified; whereas Article 129c of the Treaty requires the Community's activities in the area of interoperability to take into account the potential economic viability of projects;\n\nWhereas in order to comply with the appropriate provisions on government procurement procedures in the rail sector and in particular Directive 93/38/EEC (8), contracting entities must include technical specifications in the general documents or the contract documents relating to each contract; whereas it is necessary to build up a body of European specifications to serve as references for those technical specifications;\n\nWhereas, within the meaning of Directive 93/38/EEC, a European specification is a common technical specification, a European technical approval or a national standard implementing a European standard; whereas harmonized European standards are to be drawn up by a European standardization body such as the European Committee for Standardization (CEN), the European Committee for Electrotechnical Standardization (CENELEC) or the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI), to the order of the Commission, and their references published in the Official Journal of the European Communities;\n\nWhereas it would be in the Community's interests for there to be an international system of standardization capable of generating standards which are actually used by those involved in international trade and which meet the requirements of Community policy; whereas the European standardization bodies must therefore continue their cooperation with the international standardization bodies;\n\nWhereas contracting entities define such further requirements as are necessary to complete European specifications or other standards; whereas those specifications must not prevent the essential requirements that have been harmonized at Community level and which the trans-European high-speed train system must satisfy, from being met;\n\nWhereas the procedures governing the assessment of conformity or of suitability of use of constituents must be based on the use of the modules covered by Decision 93/465/EEC (9); whereas, as far as possible and in order to promote the development of the industries concerned, it is appropriate to expand the procedures involving a system of quality assurance; whereas the notion of constituent covers both tangible objects and intangible objects such as software;\n\nWhereas the suitability for use of the most critical constituents as regards safety, availability or system economy should be assessed;\n\nWhereas in their contract documents, contracting entities, lay down, in particular for constituents, by reference to the European specifications, the characteristics which must be met, in contractual terms, by the manufacturers; whereas, this being the case, constituent conformity is mainly linked to their area of use in order to ensure and guarantee the interoperability of the system, and not only to their free movement on the Community market;\n\nWhereas it is therefore not necessary for a manufacturer to affix the CE mark to constituents that are subject to the provisions of this Directive as, on the basis of the assessment of conformity and/or suitability for use conducted in accordance with the procedures provided for that purpose in the Directive, the manufacturer's declaration of conformity is sufficient; whereas that does not affect the obligation on manufacturers to affix the CE mark to certain components in order to certify their compliance with other Community provisions relating to them;\n\nWhereas the subsystems constituting the trans-European high-speed rail system must be subjected to a verification procedure; whereas that verification must enable the authorities responsible for authorizing their placing in service to be assured that at the stages of design, construction and placing in service the result is in line with the regulations and technical operational provisions in force; whereas that must also enable manufacturers to be able to count upon equality of treatment whatever the country; whereas it is therefore necessary to lay down a module defining the principles and conditions applying to EC verification of subsystems;\n\nWhereas the EC verification procedure is based on TSIs; whereas those TSIs are drawn up to the order of the Commission by the joint body representing the infrastructure managers, the railway companies and the industry; whereas the reference to TSIs is required in order to ensure interoperability of the trans-European high-speed rail system and whereas those TSIs are subject to the provisions of Article 18 of Directive 93/38/EEC;\n\nWhereas the notified bodies responsible for examining the conformity assessment procedures or that applying to the use of constituents, together with the procedure for the assessment of subsystems must, particularly in the absence of any European specification, coordinate their decisions as closely as possible;\n\nWhereas Council Directive 91/440/EEC requires a separation of activities, in accounting terms, between transport service operation and those concerning railway infrastructure management; whereas, this being the case, the specialized services provided by the railway infrastructure managers designated as notified bodies should be structured in such a way as to meet the criteria which must apply to this type of body; whereas other specialized bodies may be notified where these meet the same criteria;\n\nWhereas interoperability within the trans-European high-speed train system is Community wide in scale; whereas the Member States are unable, on an individual basis, to take the action needed in order to achieve that interoperability; whereas it is therefore necessary, pursuant to the principle of subsidiarity, for this action to be taken at Community level,\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:\n\nCHAPTER I\n\nGeneral provisions\n\nArticle 1\n\n1.\n\nIn accordance with Articles 129b and 129c of the Treaty, the aim of this Directive is to establish the conditions to be met in order to achieve interoperability within Community territory of the trans-European high-speed rail system as described in Annex I.\n\n2.\n\nThese conditions concern projects for and the construction, upgrading and operation of the infrastructures and rolling stock which will contribute to the functioning of the system to be put into service after the date of entry into force of this Directive.\n\nArticle 2\n\nFor the purposes of this Directive:\n\n(a) trans-European high-speed rail system means the structure described in Annex I, composed of the railway infrastructures comprising lines and fixed installations, of the trans-European transport network, constructed or upgraded to be travelled on at high speeds, and rolling stock designed for travelling on those infrastructures;\n\n(b) interoperability means the ability of the trans-European high-speed rail system to allow the safe and uninterrupted movement of high-speed trains which accomplish the specified levels of performance. This ability rests on all the regulatory, technical and operational conditions which must be met in order to satisfy essential requirements;\n\n(c) subsystems means that the trans-European high-speed rail system is subdivided, as described in Annex II, into structural or functional subsystems for which essential requirements must be laid down;\n\n(d) interoperability constituents means any elementary component, group of components, subassembly or complete assembly of equipment incorporated or intended to be incorporated into a subsystem, upon which the interoperability of the trans-European high-speed rail system depends either directly or indirectly;\n\n(e) essential requirements means all the conditions set out in Annex III which must be met by the trans-European high-speed rail system, subsystems and their interoperability constituents;\n\n(f) European specification means a common technical specification, a European technical approval or a national standard implementing a European standard, as defined in points 8 to 12 of Article 1 of Directive 93/38/EEC;\n\n(g) technical specifications for interoperability (hereinafter TSIs) means the specifications by which each subsystem is covered in order to meet the essential requirements by establishing the necessary reciprocal functional relations between the subsystems of the trans-European high-speed rail system and by ensuring the latter's compatibility;\n\n(h) joint representative body means the body bringing together representatives of the infrastructure managers, railway companies and industry which is responsible for drawing up TSIs. 'Infrastructure managers` means those referred to in Articles 3 and 7 of Directive 91/440/EEC;\n\n(i) notified bodies means the bodies which are responsible for assessing the conformity or suitability for use of the interoperability constituents or for appraising the EC procedure for verification of the subsystems.\n\nArticle 3\n\n1.\n\nThis Directive applies to the provisions concerning, for each subsystem, the parameters, interoperability constituents, interfaces and procedures as well as the conditions for the overall compatibility of the trans-European high-speed rail system required to achieve its interoperability.\n\n2.\n\nThe provisions of this Directive shall apply without prejudice to other Community provisions. However, in the case of interoperability constituents, compliance with the essential requirements of this Directive may require the use of the individual European specifications drawn up for that purpose.\n\nArticle 4\n\n1.\n\nThe trans-European high-speed rail system, subsystems and their interoperability constituents must meet the relevant essential requirements.\n\n2.\n\nThe further technical specification referred to in Article 18 (4) of Directive 93/38/EEC, which are necessary to supplement European specifications or other standards in use within the Community, must not conflict with the essential requirements.\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nTechnical specifications for interoperability\n\nArticle 5\n\n1.\n\nEach of the subsystems shall be covered by a TSI. In the case of subsystems concerning the environment, operation or users, TSIs will be drawn up only to the extent necessary to ensure interoperability of the trans-European high-speed rail system in the fields of infrastructure, energy, control and command, signalling and rolling stock.\n\n2.\n\nThe subsystems must conform to the TSIs; this conformity must be permanently maintained while each subsystem is in use.\n\n3.\n\nTo the extent necessary in order to achieve interoperability of the trans-European high-speed rail system, the TSIs shall:\n\n(a) specify the essential requirements for the subsystems and their interfaces;\n\n(b) establish the basic parameters described in Annex II (3) necessary to meet the essential requirements;\n\n(c) establish the conditions to be complied with to achieve the specified performances for each of the following categories of line:\n\n-\n\nlines specially built for high speed;\n\n-\n\nlines specially upgraded for high speed;\n\n-\n\nlines specially upgraded for high speed which have special features as a result of topographical, relief or town-planning constraints;\n\n(d) establish possible implementing provisions in certain specific cases;\n\n(e) determine the interoperability constituents and interfaces which must be covered by European specifications, including European standards, which are needed in order to achieve interoperability within the trans-European high-speed rail system while meeting the essential requirements;\n\n(f) state, in each case under consideration, which of the modules defined in Decision 93/465/EEC or, where appropriate, which specific procedures are to be used in order to assess either the conformity or the suitability for use of the interoperability constituents, as well as EC verification of the subsystems.\n\n4.\n\nThe TSIs shall not be an impediment to decisions by the Member States concerning the use of new or upgraded infrastructures for running other trains.\n\n5.\n\nCompliance with all the TSIs shall enable a compatible trans-European high-speed rail system to be set up that will preserve, as appropriate, the compatibility of each Member State's existing rail network.\n\nArticle 6\n\n1.\n\nDraft TSIs shall be drawn up to the order of the Commission, to be established in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 21 (2) by the joint representative body. TSIs shall be adopted and reviewed by the same procedure. They shall be published by the Commission in the Official Journal of the European Communities.\n\n2.\n\nThe joint representative body shall be responsible for preparing the review and updating of TSIs and making recommendations to the Committee referred to in Article 21 in order to take account of developments in technology or social requirements.\n\n3.\n\nThe preparation, adoption and review of TSIs shall take account of the estimated cost of technical solutions by which they may be met, with a view to defining and implementing the most viable solutions. To that end, the joint representative body shall attach to each draft TSI an assessment of the estimated costs and benefits of those technical solutions for all the economic operators and agents concerned.\n\n4.\n\nThe Committee shall be kept regularly informed of the preparatory work on the TSIs by the joint representative body. The Committee may give the joint body any useful recommendation or brief regarding the design of the TSIs, on the basis of the essential requirements or regarding cost assessment.\n\n5.\n\nWhen each TSI is adopted, the date of its entry into force shall be laid down in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 21 (2).\n\n6.\n\nThe joint representative body must work in an open and transparent manner in accordance with general Community standardization procedures.\n\nArticle 7\n\nA Member State need not apply certain TSIs, including those relating to rolling stock, in the following cases and circumstances:\n\n(a) in the case of a project for a new line or upgrading an existing line for high speed which is at an advanced stage of development when the TSIs in question are published.\n\nThe Member State concerned shall notify its intended derogation to the Commission in advance, shall inform the Commission of the stage the project has reached and shall forward to it a file setting out the TSIs or parts thereof which it wishes not to apply, the provisions it intends to apply in carrying out the project in order to promote its eventual interoperability, and the technical, administrative or economic reasons which justify the derogation;\n\n(b) in the case of a project for upgrading an existing line for high speed, where the loading gauge, track gauge or space between the tracks of the line are different from those on the majority of the European rail network, and where the line does not form a direct connection with the high-speed network of another Member State which is a part of the trans-European high-speed network.\n\nThe Member State concerned shall notify its intended derogation to the Commission in advance and shall forward to it a file setting out the TSIs or parts thereof concerning the physical parameter(s) referred to in the first subparagraph which it wishes not to apply, the provisions it intends to apply in carrying out the project in order to promote its eventual interoperability, the transitional measures it intends to take to guarantee compatibility of operation, and the technical, administrative or economic reasons which justify the derogation;\n\n(c) in the case of projects for new lines or upgrading existing lines for high speed carried out in the territory of the Member State concerned where its rail network is not linked to or is isolated by sea from the high-speed rail network of the rest of the Community.\n\nThe Member State concerned shall notify its intended derogation to the Commission in advance and shall forward to it a file containing the documents specified in the second subparagraph of paragraph (b);\n\n(d) in the case of a project for upgrading an existing line for high speed, where application of these TSIs compromises the economic viability of the project.\n\nThe Member State concerned shall notify its intended derogation to the Commission in advance and shall forward to it a file setting out the technical specifications or parts of specifications for interoperability which it wishes not to apply. The Commission shall examine whether the measures envisaged by the Member State are justified and shall take a decision in accordance with the procedure in Article 21 (2).\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nInteroperability constituents\n\nArticle 8\n\nMember States shall take all necessary steps to ensure that interoperability constituents:\n\n-\n\nare placed on the market only if they enable interoperability to be achieved within the trans-European high-speed rail system while at the same time meeting the essential requirements;\n\n-\n\nare used in their area of use as intended and are suitably installed and maintained.\n\nThese provisions do not exclude the placing on the market of these constituents for other purposes, nor their use for conventional railway lines.\n\nArticle 9\n\nMember States may not, in their territory and on grounds of this Directive, prohibit, restrict or hinder the placing on the market of interoperability constituents for use on the trans-European high-speed rail system if they comply with the Directive.\n\nArticle 10\n\n1.\n\nMember States shall consider as complying with the essential requirements of this Directive applying to them those interoperability constituents which bear the EC declaration of conformity or suitability for use, the components of which are set out in Annex IV.\n\n2.\n\nCompliance of an interoperability constituent with the essential requirements applying to it shall be established in relation to any relevant European specifications that may exist.\n\n3.\n\nThe references to European specifications shall be published in the Official Journal of the European Communities.\n\n4.\n\nMember States shall publish the references to the national standards transposing the European standards.\n\n5.\n\nIn the absence of any European specifications and without prejudice to Article 20 (5), Member States shall inform the other Member States and the Commission of the standards and technical specifications in use in order to implement the essential requirements.\n\nArticle 11\n\nWhere it appears to a Member State or the Commission that European specifications do not meet the essential requirements, partial or total withdrawal of the specifications concerned from the publications containing them, or their amendments, may be decided upon in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 21 (2) after consultation of the Committee set up under Council Directive 83/189/EEC of 28 March 1983 laying down a procedure for the provision of information in the field of technical standards and regulations (10) where European standards are concerned.\n\nArticle 12\n\n1.\n\nWhere a Member State confirms that an interoperability constituent covered by the EC declaration of conformity or suitability for use, and placed on the market is likely, when used as intended, not to meet the essential requirements, it shall take all necessary steps to restrict its area of application, prohibit its use or withdraw it from the market. That Member State shall forthwith inform the Commission of the measures taken and shall give the reasons for its decision, stating in particular whether the failure to conform is due to:\n\n-\n\nfailure to meet the essential requirements;\n\n-\n\nincorrect application of the European specifications where application of the specifications is invoked;\n\n-\n\ninadequacy of the European specifications.\n\n2.\n\nThe Commission shall consult the parties concerned as quickly as possible. Where, following that consultation, the Commission establishes that the measure is justified, it shall forthwith so inform the Member State that has taken the initiative and the other Member States. Where, following that consultation, the Commission establishes that the measure is unjustified, it shall forthwith so inform the Member State that has taken the initiative and the manufacturer or his authorized representative established within the Community. Where the decision referred to in paragraph 1 is justified by the existence of a gap in the European specifications, the procedure defined in Article 11 shall apply.\n\n3.\n\nWhere an interoperability constituent bearing the EC declaration of conformity fails to comply, the competent Member State shall take the appropriate measures against whomsoever has drawn up the declaration and shall inform the Commission and the other Member States thereof.\n\n4.\n\nThe Commission shall ensure that the Member States are kept informed of the progress and the results of that procedure.\n\nArticle 13\n\n1.\n\nIn order to draw up the EC declaration of conformity or suitability for use of an interoperability constituent, its manufacturer or his authorized representative established within the Community must apply the provisions laid down in the TSIs referring to it.\n\n2.\n\nWhere so required by the TSIs, the assessment of conformity or suitability for use of an interoperability constituent shall be appraised by the notified body with which the manufacturer or his authorized representative established within the Community has lodged the application.\n\n3.\n\nWhere the interoperability constituents are the subject of other Community Directives covering other aspects, the EC declaration of conformity or suitability for use shall, in such instances, state that the interoperability constituents also meet the requirements of those other Directives.\n\n4.\n\nWhere neither the manufacturer nor his authorized representative established within the Community has met the obligations of the paragraphs 1, 2 and 3, those obligations shall be incumbent on any person who places that interoperability constituent on the market. The same obligations shall apply to any person who assembles interoperability constituents or parts of interoperability constituents having diverse origins or who manufactures the interoperability constituents for his own use, for the purposes of this Directive.\n\n5.\n\nWithout prejudice to the provisions of Article 12:\n\n(a) in each instance where a Member State finds that the EC declaration of conformity has been drawn up improperly, the manufacturer or his authorized representative established within the Community shall be required to ensure that the conformity of the interoperability constituent is re-established and that the infringement ceases under the conditions laid down by that Member State;\n\n(b) where non-conformity persists, the Member State shall take all appropriate steps to restrict or prohibit the placing on the market of the interoperability constituent in question, or to ensure that it is withdrawn from the market in accordance with the procedures provided for in Article 12.\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\nSubsystems\n\nArticle 14\n\nEach Member State shall authorize the placing in service of those structural subsystems constituting the trans-European high-speed rail system which are located in its territory or operated by railway undertakings established there.\n\nFor this purpose Member States shall take all necessary steps to ensure that these subsystems may be placed in service only if they are designed, constructed and installed and/or operated in such a way as not to hinder satisfaction of the essential requirements concerning them when integrated into the trans-European high-speed rail system .\n\nArticle 15\n\nWithout prejudice to Article 19, Member States may not, in their territory and on grounds of this Directive, prohibit, restrict or hinder the construction, placing in service and operation of structural subsystems constituting the trans-European high-speed rail system which satisfy the essential requirements.\n\nArticle 16\n\n1.\n\nMember States shall consider as being interoperable and meeting the essential requirements concerning them those structural subsystems constituting the trans-European high-speed rail system which are covered by the EC declaration of verification.\n\n2.\n\nVerification of the interoperability, in accordance with the essential requirements, of a structural subsystem constituting the trans-European high-speed rail system shall be established by reference to TSIs where these exist.\n\n3.\n\nIn the absence of TSIs, Member States shall send the other Member States and the Commission a list of the technical rules in use for implementing the essential requirements.\n\nArticle 17\n\nIf it emerges that the TSIs do not fully meet the essential requirements, the Committee referred to in Article 21 may be consulted at the request of a Member State or on the initiative of the Commission.\n\nArticle 18\n\n1.\n\nIn order to draw up the EC declaration of verification, the awarding authority or its official representative shall cause the EC checking procedure to be appraised by the notified body chosen by it for that purpose.\n\n2.\n\nThe activities of the notified body responsible for the EC verification of a subsystem shall begin at the design stage and shall cover all of the manufacturing period up to the type-approval stage before a subsystem is placed in service.\n\n3.\n\nThe notified body shall be responsible for compiling the technical file that has to accompany the EC declaration of verification. The technical file must contain all the necessary documents relating to the characteristics of the subsystem and, where appropriate, all the documents certifying conformity of the constituents of interoperability. It must also contain all of the elements relating to the conditions and limits of use and to the instructions concerning servicing, constant or routine monitoring, adjustment and maintenance.\n\nArticle 19\n\n1.\n\nWhere a Member State finds that a structural subsystem covered by the EC declaration of verification accompanied by the technical file does not fully comply with this Directive and in particular does not meet the essential requirements, it may request that additional checks be carried out.\n\n2.\n\nThe Member State making the request shall forthwith inform the Commission of any additional checks requested and set out the reasons which justify them. The Commission shall without delay initiate the procedure provided for in Article 21 (2).\n\nCHAPTER V\n\nNotified bodies\n\nArticle 20\n\n1.\n\nMember States shall notify the Commission and the other Member States of the bodies responsible for carrying out the procedure for the assessment of conformity or suitability for use referred to in Article 13 and the checking procedure referred to in Article 18, indicating each body's area of responsibility.\n\nThe Commission shall assign identification numbers to them. It shall publish in the Official Journal of the European Communities the list of bodies, their identification numbers and the tasks entrusted to them, and shall ensure that the list is kept updated.\n\n2.\n\nMember States shall apply the criteria provided for in Annex VII for the assessment of the bodies to be notified. Bodies meeting the assessment criteria provided for in the relevant European standards shall be deemed to meet the said criteria.\n\n3.\n\nA Member State shall withdraw approval from a body which no longer meets the criteria referred to in Annex VII. It shall forthwith inform the Commission and the other Member States thereof.\n\n4.\n\nShould a Member State or the Commission consider that a body notified by another Member State no longer meets the relevant criteria, the matter shall be referred to the Committee provided for in Article 21, which shall deliver its opinion within three months; in the light of the Committee's opinion, the Commission shall inform the Member State concerned of all the changes needed if the notified body is to maintain the status awarded to it.\n\n5.\n\nWhere appropriate, coordination of the notified bodies shall be implemented in accordance with Article 21 (4).\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\nCommittee\n\nArticle 21\n\n1.\n\nThe Commission shall be assisted by a Committee, composed of the representatives of the Member States and chaired by the representative of the Commission.\n\n2.\n\nThe representative of the Commission shall submit to the Committee a draft of the measures to be taken. The Committee shall deliver its opinion on the draft within a time limit which the chairman may lay down according to the urgency of the matter. The opinion shall be delivered by the majority laid down in Article 148 (2) of the Treaty in the case of decisions which the Council is required to adopt on a proposal from the Commission. The votes of the representatives of the Member States within the Committee shall be weighted in the manner set out in that Article. The chairman shall not vote.\n\nThe Commission shall adopt the measures envisaged if they are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee.\n\nIf the measures envisaged are not in accordance with the opinion of the Committee, or if no opinion is delivered, the Commission shall without delay submit to the Council a proposal relating to the measures to be taken. The Council shall act by a qualified majority.\n\nIf, on the expiry of a period of three months from the date of referral to the Council, the Council has not acted, the proposed measures shall be adopted by the Commission, save where the Council has decided against the said measures by a simple majority.\n\n3.\n\nThe Committee may discuss any matter concerning the interoperability of the trans-European high-speed rail system.\n\n4.\n\nShould it prove necessary, the Committee may set up working parties to aid it in carrying out its tasks, in particular with a view to coordinating the notified bodies.\n\n5.\n\nThe Committee shall be set up as soon as this Directive enters into force.\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\nFinal provisions\n\nArticle 22\n\nAny decision taken pursuant to this Directive concerning the assessment of conformity or suitability for use of interoperability constituents, the checking of subsystems constituting the trans-European high-speed rail system and any decision taken pursuant to Articles 11, 12, 17 and 19 shall set out in detail the reasons on which it is based.
