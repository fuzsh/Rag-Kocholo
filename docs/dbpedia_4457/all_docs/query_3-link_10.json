In such a case, the temporary safety measures may apply until the determination of the appeal, without prejudice to paragraphs (5) to (7). The High Court may make such order as it sees fit. The decision of the High Court on an appeal under this paragraph is final, except by leave of the Court an appeal on a specified point of law lies to the Court of Appeal.\n\n(c) Where the Agency finds that the measures applied by the safety authority are disproportionate, the safety authority shall comply with the procedures set down in Article 17(6).\n\n(d) If the duration of a temporary measure is longer than 3 months, the safety authority shall ask the Agency to restrict or revoke the single safety certificate and the procedure set out in paragraphs (5) to (7) shall apply.\n\n(9) The safety authority shall supervise the trackside, control-command and signalling, energy and infrastructure subsystems and ensure that they are in compliance with the essential requirements.

The national provisions for Chapter V are provided in the European Union (Railway Safety) (Reporting and Investigation of Serious Accidents, Accidents and Incidents) Regulations 2020 ( S.I No. 430 of 2020 ). The Directive is part of the Technical Pillar of the EU Fourth Railway Package.\n\nIn giving effect to this Directive, these Regulations ensure the development and improvement of the safety of the railway system and improved access to the market for rail transport services. These Regulations cover safety requirements for the railway system as a whole, including the safe management of infrastructure and of traffic operation and the interaction between railway undertakings, infrastructure managers and other bodies, including the role of the Commission for Railway Regulation. In Ireland, these transposition Regulations apply to the IarnrÃ³d Ãireann rail network.\n\nThese Regulations replace and repeal the European Union (Railway Safety) Regulations 2013 ( S.I. No. 444 of 2013 )."
