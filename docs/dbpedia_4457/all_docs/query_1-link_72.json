        "text": "Centralny Port Komunikacyjny (CPK) is a Polish state-owned Special Purpose Vehicle tasked with design and delivery of one of the largest and most ambitious infrastructure projects in Europe. CPK project will integrate air and rail transport at unprecedented levels. The CPK Programme will create a fully multimodal transport hub consisting of a new greenfield airport to replace Warsaw Chopin Airport along with the new railway network consisting of approximately 2,000 km of new railway lines, majority of which in a High Speed Rail standard. The CPK project will completely transform Poland’s transportation system bringing it to the forefront of Europe, while reducing GHG emission and transport exclusion. Upon completion CPK Programme will allow for travel times between Warsaw and Poland’s largest cities in no more than 2.5 hours. The HSR network built as a part of the CPK Programme will link Polish transportation system with neighboring countries thanks to cross-border connections with projects such as Rail Baltica and Czech HSR Programme. Together with other HSR projects in the region it will create a new, dense and interoperable High Speed Rail network. The first preparatory construction works as a part of the CPK Programme are scheduled to begin in 2023.\n\nThe RDD 2023 conference is organized by Centralny Port Komunikacyjny (CPK), a Polish state-owned company- responsible for planning and delivery of one of the largest transport infrastructure mega-projects in Europe. Apart from a new airport hub, CPK project includes the construction of almost 2,000 km of railway lines, mostly in HSR standard.\n\nThis new HSR network, together with other ambitious regional initiatives like Rail Baltica and V4 HSR, will form the future backbone of the EU transport system, bringing a vital contribution to fulfilling TEN-T policy and EU Smart and Sustainable Mobility Strategy goals. Reconstruction and modernization of railway lines, including introduction of HSR system, is also an important part of Ukrainian plans for post-war recovery. In this context, the European Commission has recently proposed extending four European Transport Corridors (ETC) to Ukraine and Moldova, connecting EU Member states to Ukrainian Black Sea ports.\n\nSteer’s analysis will support further development of High-Speed Rail across EU countries of 3Seas initiative. More specifically, it will focus on HSR projects across Poland, Czechia, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Hungary, Romania and Slovakia. Also, possible Ukrainian dimension of HSR development and infrastructural links to EU will be captured.\n\nThe analysis will focus on the following aspects: journey time savings, changes in service levels including frequency, rail demand increases, modal shift from air and car, as well as any cost associated with the investment and operation of the system.\n\n14:15\n\nPanel discussion: Passenger perspective of HSR\n\nThis panel will try to answer the question of how to include the passenger’s needs in HSR investments. We will approach the passenger as a customer to whom we have to deliver comfortable, attractive and competitive rail alternative to other modes of transport. The panel will highlight the role of transfer nodes being part of HSR network as not only access points to passenger transport services, but also a revolution in the way urban areas function. We will discuss rolling stock solutions dedicated to ensuring the comfort, quality and safety of passengers as well as issues related to the transport organization, timetabling and integration with local transport. Timetable will be highlighted as a key element in shaping passengers’ choices and determining infrastructure needs. We will also discuss the railway undertakings’ approach to designing their services.\n\nPanelists:\n\nMichał Jasiak, Deputy Director for Analysis, Railway Subprogramme Strategy & Planning, Design & Engineering Department, CPK\n\nFlorence Rousseau-Deltheil, Marketing Manager TGVM, SNCF\n\nMartin Švehlík, Director, HSR Preparation Department, Správa železnic\n\nJacek Konop, PhD. Eng., Vice-President of the Board, Chief Technology Officer, PESA Bydgoszcz S.A.\n\nModerator: Łukasz Malinowski, Rynek Kolejowy"
