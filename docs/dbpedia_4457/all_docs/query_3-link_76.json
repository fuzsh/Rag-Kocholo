        "text": "When designing an application for the railway sector, there is a set of regulations and considerations that should be considered. In this blog post, we’ll outline some of these regulations, for example IEC 61508 and CENELEC, and the set of standards that should be followed.\n\nIn general, when a PCB designer faces the challenge of creating a printed circuit board for a railway application, the common regulation for the design of the railway application that one should refer to is UNE-EN 50124-1 – The European Standard. However, given the high reliability required for most railway applications, another fundamental standard is to be considered: IEC 61508 – An international standard published by the International Electrotechnical Commission.\n\nRegulations for railway applications\n\nIEC 61508 Regulations\n\nIEC 61508 provides functional safety standards for the lifecycle of electrical, electronic, or programmable electronic (E/E/PE) systems. Two of those standards being:\n\nSpecific architecture requirements to comply with SIL (Safety Integrity Level)\n\nMethodology for obtaining FCC (Federal Communications Commission) compliance. They do not consider the concept of Fail Safe.\n\nThere are three fundamental principles in IEC 61508:\n\nZero risk “can never be achieved.”\n\nNon-tolerable risks must be reduced.\n\nSecurity management must be considered from the beginning.\n\nThis regulation is, in turn, the basis for other standards that apply to the railway sector, such as CENELEC.\n\nCENELEC Regulations\n\nCENELEC (European Committee for Electrotechnical Standardization) is responsible for European standardization in the areas of electrical engineering. Together with ETSI (telecommunications) and CEN (other technical areas), it forms the European system of technical standards. Although it works actively with the European Union, it is not an institution of the EEC.\n\nCENELEC’s work is fundamentally based on IEC (International Electrotechnical Commission) publications, although their own standards are also prepared by CENELEC technicians.\n\nCENELEC is divided into three standards:\n\n50126 (IEC 62278) deals with the standard safety regulations within a railway system: Life cycle and its phases (requirements, design, manufacturing, validation, etc.), organization and roles necessary to comply with security, RAMS concept (Reliability, Availability, Maintenance and Safety), of a railway system, Command, Control and Signaling (safety management).\n\n50128 (IEC 62279) deals with safety software management (SW) in railway control and protection systems. Equivalent to the generic one, but for the SW (it does not have any RAMS, which is more of the HW). This standard can be applied to Railway Applications and Railway Control and Protection Systems.\n\n50129 (IEC 62425) deals with system safety of electronic railway equipment. It complements 50126 and more aspects related to HW and programmable logic such as FPGAs (Fine-Pitch Ball Grid Array). For example, to identify and make a system safer and justifiable.\n\nWithin the CENELEC standard, there is another important standard to keep in mind, (apart from those for electromagnetic compatibility, environmental tests: temperature, vibrations), and that is the insulation coordination (50124-1). This applies precisely when designing PCBs in terms of insulation between conductors of different guards between metal surfaces, and tests to verify compliance.\n\nHow are these three CENELEC standards (50126/28/29) different?\n\n50126 applies to all railway systems, 50129 is specific for signaling systems, and finally 50128 is the one to consider for programming software subsystems.\n\nTherefore, as a PCB designer we can say that the specific reference standard for the design of printed circuit boards for railway applications would be EN 50129.\n\nStandard EN 50129\n\nIt is a specification that includes the following aspects:\n\nTechnical Security:\n\nDesign description\n\nPrinciples of technical safety\n\nGuarantee of correct operation:\n\nSystem architecture and interface definition.\n\nSystem requirements compliance with security requirements.\n\nGuarantee of correct HW and SW operation.\n\nEffect of breakdowns:\n\nSystem behavior under faults.\n\nOperation under external influences:\n\nClimate, mechanical, electrical, and more severe conditions.\n\nApplication conditions related to security:\n\nSystem configuration, manufacturing, operation, and maintenance.\n\nSecurity monitoring during maintenance, system decommissioning, and reporting of results.\n\nFMEA (Failure Mode and Effect Analysis) Systematic evaluation of failure models:\n\nInductive method: bottom-up, HW Systems (processes for failure modes (understanding “Failure” as a loss of functionality), causes and effects), identifies the “single-point” of failure.\n\nFMEA results in aid design improvements, testing and risk analysis.\n\nWhat is the importance of applying the CENELEC regulations correctly?\n\nThe application of this regulation facilitates access to international markets, achieving greater competitiveness, and saving both money and time by discovering errors before the PCB is manufactured.\n\nThe key is to apply the standard from the beginning of a design\n\nThe fact is that in order to facilitate the implementation of a PCB in a railway application, the CENELEC standard must be taken into account from the first moment that a new design is started. Some common good practices to keep in mind from the start are:\n\nStructure the schematic properly. Grouping the logic blocks and the inputs and outputs to minimize connection tracks, thus largely avoiding resistive and capacitive parasitic effects.\n\nApply later to the layout of the PCB, selecting the right track width sufficient to allow the passage of the maximum current that will circulate through them. The minimum separation between tracks will depend on the tension they have to withstand.\n\nThe local offices of NCAB have a technical team of engineers with the capacity to provide advice on the design of PCBs both in aspects of efficiency, manufacturing technology and sustainability, as well as in compliance with regulations in highly demanding sectors or applications such as the railway or other similar.\n\nThis is knowledge derived from the experience accumulated in a trajectory of more than 30 years, the presence in 15 countries and the annual production volume of more than 360 million PCBs for high-requirement applications.\n\nMore about the railway industry and PCBs\n\nLearn about the important standards for fire and safety that have to be applied when producing PCBs to the railway industry:"
