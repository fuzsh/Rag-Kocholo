        "text": "In a landscape where rail infrastructure plays a vital role in shaping transportation, the European Commission has just thrown a curveball with its decision on the main rail network concession for Nederlandse Spoorwegen. This decision isn't just about contracts; it's about the future direction of rail policy in Europe. The implications are vast and multifaceted. How will this decision impact the efficiency and accessibility of rail services? What does it mean for the competitiveness of the rail sector? And importantly, how will it influence the overall transportation landscape? Europe still doesn‚Äôt understand that in public services liberalization doesn‚Äôt always brings improved citizen services at a better price (rather the opposite). Especially in rail where investments happen across decades a consistent and continued vision is key. UK has shown what the consequences of full liberalization are: poor services, all-time high of cancelled trains, dynamic pricing with outrages fees in peak hours and a fully outdated infrastructure. https://lnkd.in/eJEgEJaJ #railindustry #publictransport #NS #consession\n\nüîµ Transport Council | EU Transport Ministers agreed on a General Approach on the Proposal for a Regulation on the use of railway infrastructure capacity and took note of the progress on the Combined Transport and Weights & Dimensions Directives. CER welcomes the Council‚Äôs General Approach and the ongoing discussions concerning the Directives, yet highlights several areas of concern: Railway Infrastructure Capacityüëá ‚û°Ô∏è A harmonised EU approach to capacity management is essential to facilitate expansion of cross-border rail transport. CER urges Member States to ensure an effective implementation of the European Frameworks and to keep the original enforcement timelines. CER welcomes the new coordination dialogue foreseen, but a specific coordination mandate in the case of national guidance on conflict resolution to facilitate cross-border traffic is necessary. A new platform representing the applicants requesting capacity should also be included. Weights & Dimensions Directiveüëá ‚û°Ô∏è CER welcomes the intention to promote the decarbonisation of road freight, but the current proposal poses a serious risk of inducing a modal shift of freight from rail to road. A further thorough assessment of its multiple impacts in terms of road safety and infrastructure is needed. Combined Transport Directiveüëá ‚û°Ô∏è The proposal to revise the Directive is essential to enhance intermodality. With the correct incentives, it can contribute to create synergies between policies, such as the promotion of zero-emission vehicles, which may optimally be combined with long-haul trips over rail. It is crucial to keep safeguarding provisions already set in the Directive, such as maintaining the 150km radius for road legs to ports. CER Executive Director Alberto Mazzola: ‚ÄúToday‚Äôs Council discussions pave the way for new important developments for the rail sector. We thank Member States for their efforts, particularly the Belgian Presidency for its good work over the past months. However, there are further improvements to be made and CER would like to see harmonisation of capacity management processes across Europe, in particular it is necessary to ensure a specific coordination mandate in the case of national guidance on conflict resolution to facilitate and not block cross-border traffic. Time is of the essence and we need to do it right if we want to optimise and boost existing capacity to meet the increasing demand‚Äù.

CER believes that CEF III should be increased under the next #MFF 2028-2035 to be able to meet the targets and deadlines of the completion of the TEN-T Networks.

At the same time, they ask the EU to strengthen intermodal transport via rail and barge as the only way to meet decarbonisation goals and achieve territorial and social cohesion. According to the Committee, the only way to do this is by effectively implementing policy changes within the Greening Freight Transport Package (GFTP). The railway sector is not alone in advocating for fundamental amendments to the GFTP legislative proposals, especially concerning the Weights and Dimensions Directive (WDD). According to CoR, the EU‚Äôs proposals at this stage are not ‚Äúenough to make rail connections more attractive and reduce heavy traffic on the roads.‚Äù For CoR members, promoting intermodal transportation via rail and inland waterways is the only way forward for the European transport sector. Regulatory and economic measures should prioritise railways and waterways. At the same time, the Committee members urge that decarbonising the road transport sector by promoting low-emission trucks should also be considered a priority task. Nevertheless, they stress the importance of maintaining a balance between enhancing low-emission vehicles and excessively promoting road transport against other modes. This remark aligns with concerns shared within the rail and combined transport sector that view the WDD as just an incentive to use more trucks. The WDD is not the only alignment point between the CoR and Europe‚Äôs rail freight industry. The Committee made its intentions and expectations clear regarding some other aspects of the GFTP that railway associations have already addressed extensively. The most important point concerns creating an international regulatory body to ensure the harmonisation of European railway systems while safeguarding the adequate and effective distribution of cross-border railway capacity. For CoR, ensuring that European rail freight transport is characterised by flexible network management that will quickly respond to operators‚Äô needs is critical. The proposals mentioned above are also reflected in the statements of Jos√© Ribau Esteves, Mayor of Aveiro in Portugal and a CoR member: ‚ÄúEurope must strengthen the competitiveness and efficiency of rail freight transport, ensure cooperation between infrastructure managers and operations managers for transport between Member States, and improve the environmental performance of transport‚Äù. https://lnkd.in/dMzZtCbK"
