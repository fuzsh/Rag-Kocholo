        "text": "For the fifth time CEUTP participated in the TRAKO International Railway Trade Fair. Our stand, which we shared with the Ministry of Infrastructure, the Railway Transport Office and the Railway Institute, was awarded for the most attractive exposition of TRAKO Trade Fair by the jury of the Competition. At the stand we had a chance to discuss the most important issues for the beneficiaries from the point of view of using the European Funds.\n\nThe Trade Fair featured an abundance of accompanying events and conferences, among which it is impossible not to notice the conference entitled “We are changing Polish railways” organized by the Ministry of Infrastructure, PKP S.A., PKP PLK S.A., the Railway Institute and the Land Transport Chamber of Commerce, as well as the international debate entitled “Masterplan for freight transport” organized by the Pro Kolej Foundation.\n\nAs usual, the rolling stock presented on the tracks outside sparked a lot of excitement. In the ongoing contracts for the supply of rolling stock as part of EU-funded projects, e.g. the Newag company presented the Griffin locomotive for PKP Intercity and the Stadler company showcased the FLIRT electric multiple unit for the Koleje Mazowieckie. The PESA company presented ELF-type electric multiple unit for Koleje Wielkopolskie. The TRAXX DC3 locomotive from Bombardier Transportation, as well as the TANGO NF2 tram from Stadler, a solution proposed for cities, also aroused interest. The investment contractors were very interested in the offer of Plasser&Theurer work trains as well as rail vehicles by KZESO and Crystal Tractor. The stand of the China Railway Rolling Stock Corporation has traditionally attracted great interest among exhibitors in the halls.\n\nThe fair ended on Friday, September 27, 2019. Come to the next one which will take place in 2021!\n\nAuthor: Przemysław Wróbel, Expert – Advisor of CEUTP Director"
