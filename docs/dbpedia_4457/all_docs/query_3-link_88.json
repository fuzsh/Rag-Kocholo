        "text": "Implementation of the 4th railway package – including a new role for ERA in authorising vehicles for use\n\nShift2Rail – a Research programme pushing the technology to make rail more competitive\n\nRules, processes and standards:\n\no ERA is working with partners (Japan, USA, Gulf states, OTIF etc) to share and evolve best practice and develop the future ‘global standards’, eg, for next generation signalling\n\no ISO/IEC standards taking over from ENs\n\nInternational Strategy:\n\no Market opening agreements with partners around the world\n\no Mutual recognition (cross acceptance) of existing rules\n\no Mutual recognition of conformity certification and authorisation processes\n\no Migration to common rules and standards for the next generation technology\n\nRules and standards\n\nTom Lee, who is RSSB’s Deputy Director of Research and Standards and also Professional Head of Command, Control and Signalling, spoke next about the practical implications for people embarking on change, in particular the burden that standards are perceived to place on those delivering projects.\n\nTom made it clear that the key issue is to make the right decisions from the beginning. Of course some requirements are not optional; the Railway Inter¬opera-bility Regulations 2011 (RIR 2011), which mandate the TSIs and the Railways and Other Guided Transport Systems Regulations (ROGS 2006) are the law and must be complied with. Although deviations from TSIs can be sought, it is a far from trivial process.\n\nHowever, there are other standards that projects will identify, once decisions have been made about making a change, having taken into account the reasons for the change. These stan¬dards are, in general, written with the knowledge that they are a ‘best fit’ solution, and that there will sometimes be circumstances where they are not appropriate. It is possible to seek to deviate from the standards. In later questioning, in response to concerns that obtaining deviations is an uncertain process, Tom said that over 300 deviations were submitted last year and all but one of them were approved; deviations are evaluated by RSSB but decisions are made by committees of representatives from the industry.\n\nTom expanded on Robin’s remarks about the impact and influence of the UK on standards setting in Europe. He illustrated an apparently very complex structure for decision making, but where the UK’s record of participation has led to some excellent results for the UK.\n\nIn terms of legislation, The EU issues Directives and Regulations. Directives have to be transposed into legislation by the Member State, but Regulations apply immediately. The Interoperability Directive and the Regulations mandating the Common Safety Method for Risk Assessment and Evaluation are examples. Tom identified that in developing ROGS from the previous legislation, the opportunity was taken to simplify the process of safety certification for the bodies forming the railway industry, that is, TOCs, Network Rail etc. No longer was a safety case required but instead a Safety Certificate and a Safety Management System, a process that is more flexible and scalable for different sized companies and levels of risk. Tom concluded by talking about Positives and Challenges (with some observations):\n\nPositives:\n\nA move towards a single EU rail system allows products and services to be traded across borders without re-testing and reassessment (we are not there yet!)\n\nA reduction in the amount of state imposed rules which means a single set of require-ments and greater choice in certain areas (but a clean-up is needed and this is not easy)\n\nA chance to influence the EU so good UK practice can be adopted and embedded in EU standards.\n\nChallenges:\n\nEU standards often require interpretation and so are not easy to just use (it’s English, Jim, but not as we know it!)\n\nA significant engagement is required to ensure EU standards work for UK and we don’t always get our way as it is as much a political process as a technical one\n\nDeviation from EU standards is harder and more time consuming\n\nHarmonisation to a common EU target system might have long term benefits but with potentially short term cost and effort. Can we manage transition well?\n\nA Metro perspective\n\nJohn Downes – Head of Engineering Governance and Services, London Underground, presented the position for Metros which also generally includes Light Rail and Trams. He said that the framework for liberating the ‘main line’ railways in the EU was inappropriate for local networks not possessing the same characteristics and not needing tointer operate. There is, after all, no prospect of the Bakerloo line being extended to its nearest neighbour any time soon, and there is little in common between, say Glasgow Underground and rubber-tyred Paris Metro trains (in terms of vehicle/tunnel size and bogie technology at least).\n\nThanks to excellent work carried out by the UITP’s Urban Rail working group and by lobbying of the Commission,, there has been general acceptance of this view, although sometimes EU officials inadvertently propose to draw them into the net. However, the metro, tramway and light rail sector has recognized the benefits of standardisation, including sub-systems, equipment and components, and is cooperating with a Commission mandate to the European standards bodies to include requirements of metros in European Standards, where there is economic benefit.\n\nEqually, some of the processes adopted can be translated to the metro/light rail sector whilst others are inappropriate. Thus, the metros’ safety regulators are the National Safety Authorities and any derogations from standards are handled at metro or national level. TSIs do not apply. Interfaces with national networks are handled on a case by case basis.\n\nAll this was achieved because the Commission listened to industry representation and, as a result, avoided regulation. However, they recognised the power of standardisation but allowed the industry to set the standardisation agenda for things that were needed, with no action where the view was that they were not needed.\n\nIn conclusion, John said that the Commission aren't faceless bureaucrats; you can meet with them, explore positions, understand motivations and find something that is mutually bene-ficial. But it requires engagement and effort. You cannot ‘snipe’ from the sidelines after the event and expect to have any influence on a deal that has already been done.\n\nAcademia\n\nNext, we heard from Professor Felix Schmid, Professor of Railway Systems Engineering at the University of Birmingham, speaking in his private capacity. Felix, a Swiss born engineer, presented a very positive picture of the benefits of working with other European countries on research and highlighted the truly multi-national team of academics, administrators and students at Birmingham.\n\nHe expressed a particular fondness for the EU freedom of movement that allows EU students to attend UK universities (which rely on foreign students) without any visa restrictions AND UK students to benefit from exchanges funded by the Erasmus programme. UK students can spend 6 to 12 months studying in other EU countries, including Norway and Liechtenstein.\n\nThey can NOT go to Switzerland, which adopts EU standards for railways but has ‘no seat at any of the tables’, because it no longer fully subscribes to free movement of labour. Felix highlighted the benefit of free movement through the case of the Malaysian academic who was not allowed to work for Birmingham University for a two days to act as an external examiner for a doctoral student. He also said that organising conferences including participants from emerging economies outside the EU is a nightmare.\n\nTurning to research, Felix highlighted the Dynotrain programme, which ran from 2010 to 2013, cost over 5.5m Euros, including 3.3m Euro of EU funding, and involved:\n\nUniversity partners: Birmingham (UK), Chalmers (Sweden), KTH (Sweden), MMU (UK), PoliMi (Italy), La Sapienza (Italy), TIFSA Madrid (Spain), TU Berlin (Germany), TU Lisbon (Portugal)\n\nIndustry partners: Alstom, Bombardier, CAF, Siemens\n\nInfrastructure: DB (Germany), Network Rail (Britain), SNCF (France), Trenitalia (Italy).\n\nAlthough the programme concluded in 2013, analysis of the four terabytes of data collected is continuing. The programme included running a 14 vehicle train through Germany, France, Italy and Switzerland, covering some 7500 km in 4 weeks. The train included 6 test vehicles with 10 instrumented wheelsets, from which 300 physical parameters measured and 600 parameters evaluated including:\n\nTrack geometry\n\nRail profiles\n\nWheel profiles\n\nWheel-rail forces\n\nVehicle accelerations and displacements\n\nVideo recordings\n\nVehicle stationary tests\n\nIt was Felix’ view that this research would not have taken place, had the EU not contributed the majority of funds and provided the research framework that enabled the collaboration.\n\nThe view from ‘across the water'\n\nDick Fearn, a respected former BR manager, who has been Chief Operating Officer and then Chief Executive Officer of Irish Railways – Iarnród Éireann (IE), outlined how the EU had supported IE with considerable financial aid over the period 2000 to 2013 to help them move from a railway on the verge of collapse to a thoroughly modern railway. IE operates a small network of just under 1900 km of route, today carrying just 40 m passenger journeys a year, and with about 4000 employees. It wasn’t like that in 2000!\n\nThe EU provided:\n\nFunding for network modernisation\n\nFunding for rolling stock replacement, without insisting on using EU rolling stock manufacturers\n\nSupport from EU member railways (large and small) sharing operational experience\n\nA derogation from the requirement to separate operations from infrastructure until 2013\n\nAs a result, IE was able to improve the safety of the network, its capacity and the quality and reliability of the services. For the rolling stock, some carriages were purchased from CAF, but the more flexible Diesel Multiple Units were purchased from Hyundai Rotem in South Korea – albeit with many European sub-systems.\n\nDick was extremely positive about the support provided by the EU and in his final slide showed how, since 2000, costs have fallen to about a quarter of their former level.\n\nAnd finally...\n\nIan Walmsley, an experienced rolling stock engineer and contributor to Modern Railways gave the final talk in his usual forthright manner. He started by reminding us that Harold Wilson once used almost the same words in connection with his EU negotiations that David Cameron used on the conclusion of his negotiations earlier in 2016. He then took us though his personal view of a number of issues:\n\nIf we left, we might be free from some of the regulations (tunnels, fire, ETCS)\n\nThe TSI for Persons of Reduced Mobility is based on UK best practice, but only the UK has imposed an implementation deadline (2020)\n\nUK has a talent for regulation and might demand more than the EU\n\nSpecifiers and suppliers are often unwilling to seek deviations to standards; to do so is seen as a sign of failure. This is a UK cultural issue.\n\nRegardless of our membership of the EU, market forces will lead to us using the common standards so as to access a bigger market\n\nIf we left EU we would still have to provide EU compatibility to sell goods, so would sell the same goods to the UK\n\nEU led railway research has as many daft activities as UK led research\n\nAll this led to his conclusion: In or Out, there would be no impact on the UK rail industry.\n\nThere was a lively debate at the end, covering issues such as:\n\nShould Crossrail (the Elizabeth Line) and Crossrail 2 be classed as interoperable?\n\nReinforcement that gaining deviations from TSIs is hard\n\nConcern that changes to TSIs (eg, the 2nd version of the Freight Wagon TSI was fundamentally different to the 1st) can and does make it difficult to exploit products without constant design changes\n\nThere was a view that TSIs are ‘random requirements’ that ‘authorities’ chose to write for no good reason\n\nSmall railways benefit from well-established standards as they can have confidence that things made to those standards will work, compared with the challenge for a small railway of having, for each project, to reinvent the requirements for itself. Others observed that this might be true for big railways too!\n\nConclusion\n\nThe presentations and discussion covered all the questions that were posed in developing the event. In particular, there were a number of myths exposed which are worth repeating here. (For the avoidance of doubt, these are the myths. The opposite is the truth!):\n\n“Britain has but a weak influence on EU/EC standards and regulations for railways”\n\n“The EU/EC wants to regulate everything”\n\n“The EU/EC does not listen”\n\nThe ending of the EU/EC derogation for Irish Railways (IE) in 2013 in terms of separation of infrastructure and train operations has been a major problem for IE”\n\n“The EU/ EC inflicted the PRM-TSI requirement and deadline on us”\n\n“Life would be much simpler/better/lower cost for Britain’s railway industry if we left the EU”\n\nThe last words in the presentations were Ian Walmsley’s: “It won’t actually make much difference to Britain’s railway industry if we leave the EU”. Is this true? No one really knows. Most of what we currently do is mandated by UK law, even though it was prompted by EU directives, so we could just carry on. However, we would no longer have a right to representation on the various standards setting and regulation bodies and, over time, our process would diverge from that of the EU unless the UK took the conscious decision to adopt EU rules despite our lack of involvement in the development process. It could be easier and simpler, and it could be very much worse.\n\nHere is a personal plea for consistency. Britain’s railway has a massive programme of works to expand and renew its infrastructure and rolling stock. It has taken a long time to train and familiarise people with the current regulatory, standards and approval framework, and the one key thing the industry needs is stability so that it can get on and deliver.\n\nFind out about the Railway Division.\n\nLexicon\n\nASBO - an authorised certification body independent of the project seeking certification who can certify that the CSM has been properly applied to manage risk to acceptably low levels.\n\nCEN - European Committee for Standardisation\n\nCENELEC - European Committee for Electrotechnical Standardisation\n\nCER – Community of European Railways\n\nCSM – The Common Safety Method for risk assessment and evaluation mandated by an EU Directive\n\nDEBO – an authorised certification body independent of the project seeking certification who can certify that NNTRs have been complied with\n\nDfT – UK Department for Transport\n\nEIM – European Infrastructure Managers’ group\n\nERA – European Rail Agency\n\nETCS – EuropeanTrain Control System\n\nETSI – European Telecommunications Standards Institute\n\nInteroperability – a term in general use that encompasses EU legislation intended to create the level playing field for railways\n\nNNTR – Notified National Technical Rules, as advised to ERA by Member States.
