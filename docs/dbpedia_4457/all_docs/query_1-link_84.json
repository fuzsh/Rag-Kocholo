They are bullet-nosed high-speed pendolino trains, although in Poland they don't tilt into curves.\n\nEIC (Express InterCity) and IC (InterCity) trains are the next best, with modern air-conditioned carriages hauled by a separate locomotive or sometimes fast electric units with restaurant car.\n\nTLK trains (Twoje Linie Kolejowe, which means Your Railway Lines) are ordinary express trains usually using older carriages.\n\nSeat reservation is compulsory on all EIP and most EIC, IC & TLK trains, this comes included in the ticket.\n\nAlternatively, you can book Polish trains with reliable Polish train ticketing agency www.polrail.com who can arrange tickets for travel within Poland or for international trains starting in Poland, for example Warsaw to Moscow, or Krakow to Prague.\n\nWhat are the trains like?\n\nEIP trains: Krakow to Warsaw in 2h19 at up to 200 km/h\n\nIntroduced in 2014, the very best trains on the Polish network are modern bullet-nosed pendolinos, although in Poland they don't tilt into the curves as they do elsewhere. They operate on the Krakow-Warsaw-Gdynia route at up to 200 km/h (125 mph), with faster operation planned in the future. Reservation is compulsory and they have a bar-bistro car.\n\nEIC & IC trains\n\nEIC & IC trains are the next rank down.

Tip: There are some 3-hour gaps in the timetable, so check your train times beforehand!\n\nNo reservation is necessary or possible for these local trains, you can just turn up, buy a ticket and hop on. They can't sell out. Easy!
