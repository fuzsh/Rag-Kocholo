these Regulations to that subsystem for any upgrading or renewal where that subsystem is placed in service on or after 1st August 2006.\n\nPART 2 U.K.Subsystems\n\nRequirement for authorisation U.K.\n\n4.—(1) No person shall place in service on the high-speed rail system or the conventional TEN rail system any structural subsystem which has been constructed, upgraded or renewed as a project unless, for the particular rail system—\n\n(a)the Safety Authority has given an authorisation for the placing in service of that subsystem; or\n\n(b)the Competent Authority has decided under regulation 5 that for the upgrading or renewal of the subsystem, an authorisation is not required for the subsystem to be placed in service.\n\n(2) An application for an authorisation under paragraph (1)(a) shall be made in writing to the Safety Authority and be accompanied by—\n\n(a)the complete technical file, including the certificate of conformity; and\n\n(b)the verification declaration.\n\n(3) Subject to paragraph (4), the Safety Authority in considering an application may not require checks carried out under the appropriate verification assessment procedure to be carried out again.\n\n(4) The Safety Authority may require the applicant to carry out any additional checks which the Safety Authority considers necessary in relation to the project subsystem if that subsystem appears to the Safety Authority not to meet the essential requirements in accordance with regulation 7.\n\n(5) Where additional checks are required under paragraph (4) the Safety Authority—\n\n(a)shall inform the applicant that the application cannot be determined before the additional checks are carried out; and\n\n(b)shall notify the Commission in writing forthwith of the additional checks it requires and the reasons for requiring those checks.\n\n(6) The Safety Authority shall issue an authorisation for the placing in service of a project subsystem on or as part of the high-speed rail system or conventional TEN rail system, where it is satisfied that—\n\n(a)the verification declaration has been drawn up in accordance with Schedule 8;\n\n(b)the project subsystem has been so designed, constructed and installed as to meet the essential requirements in accordance with regulation 7 relating to that subsystem when placed in service on that rail system; and\n\n(c)the project subsystem is compatible with the particular rail system into which it is being placed in service.\n\n(7) The Safety Authority shall determine an application by—\n\n(a)authorising the placing in service of the project subsystem; or\n\n(b)refusing the application for authorisation.\n\n(8) An authorisation issued by the Safety Authority for the placing in service of an item of rolling stock shall be treated, subject to the conditions in paragraph (9), as also being an authorisation for additional rolling stock that the contracting entity constructs or contracts with another person to construct under the same contract or project and where the construction is to the same standards and specifications.\n\n(9) For the purposes of paragraph (8), a contract for the purchase of further items of rolling stock for construction to the same standards and specifications shall be taken to include an option for their purchase but only where the option—\n\n(a)was agreed at the time the contract was made; and\n\n(b)it is exercised by the contracting entity—\n\n(i)within 24 months from the date of authorisation under paragraph (7); or\n\n(ii)within 5 years of the date the contract was made,\n\nwhichever is the earliest.\n\n(10) A structural subsystem is placed in service in relation to the high-speed rail system or the conventional TEN rail system when, having been constructed, upgraded or renewed, it is first used on or as part of that rail system in the transportation of passengers or freight or for the purpose for which it was designed, but does not include any testing or trials conducted in the verification assessment procedure or for additional checks required by the Safety Authority.\n\nRenewal or upgrading of subsystems U.K.\n\n5.—(1) The contracting entity in relation to a project for the renewal or upgrading of an existing structural subsystem shall apply in writing to the Competent Authority for a decision as to whether an authorisation is required for that subsystem to be placed in service.\n\n(2) An application made under paragraph (1) shall be accompanied by the following information—\n\n(a)a file setting out details of the project;\n\n(b)an assessment of whether and how the overall safety level of the subsystem concerned may be adversely affected by the works envisaged;\n\n(c)identification of any TSI, or parts thereof, for which derogations may or will be sought pursuant to regulation 6;\n\n(d)an indication of any TSI, or parts thereof, which it is proposed should not apply if the Competent Authority determines that the subsystem requires authorisation.\n\n(3) The Competent Authority may give notice in writing to the applicant requiring the applicant to provide additional information that the Competent Authority considers necessary in order to make a decision.\n\n(4) The applicant shall provide the Competent Authority with such additional information requested under paragraph (3) as he is reasonably able to supply and the applicant shall give a written explanation where he is unable to provide the information requested.\n\n(5) In making a decision as to the requirement for authorisation, factors to be taken into account by the Competent Authority shall include—\n\n(a)the implementation strategy provided in any relevant TSI; and\n\n(b)the size of the proposed works.\n\n(6) Except where the Competent Authority and the Safety Authority are the same person, the Competent Authority shall not decide authorisation is not required unless it has consulted the Safety Authority.\n\n(7) If it appears to the Competent Authority that the proposed works may adversely affect the overall safety of the relevant subsystem the Competent Authority shall decide that the subsystem requires authorisation to be placed in service.\n\n(8) Where the Competent Authority determines that the subsystem requires an authorisation and the project subsystem is part of the conventional TEN rail system—\n\n(a)the Competent Authority shall, subject to any derogations under regulation 6, decide to what extent TSIs shall apply to the project subsystem; and\n\n(b)the Secretary of State shall notify that decision to the Commission and other Member States.\n\nExemption from need to conform with TSIs (derogations) U.K.\n\n6.—(1) The Competent Authority may determine that, in the circumstances or cases specified in paragraph (2), the whole or part of a relevant TSI, including those relating to rolling stock, shall not apply in relation to a subsystem or interoperability constituent (“a derogation”).\n\n(2) The circumstances and cases are—\n\n(a)for a proposed new line, for the renewal or upgrading of an existing line, or any element referred to in article 1(1) of the High-Speed Directive or article 1(1) of the Conventional Directive, which is at an advanced stage of development or is the subject of a contract in the course of performance when the relevant TSI is published;\n\n(b)for any project concerning the renewal or upgrading of an existing line where the loading gauge, track gauge, space between tracks, or electrification voltage in the relevant TSI is not compatible with those of the existing line;\n\n(c)for a proposed new line or for the proposed renewal or upgrading of an existing line where the rail network is separated or isolated by the sea from the rail network of the rest of the Community;\n\n(d)for any proposed renewal, extension or upgrading of an existing line when the application of a relevant TSI would compromise the economic viability of the project or the compatibility of the rail system;\n\n(e)following an accident or natural disaster, where the conditions for the rapid restoration of the network do not economically or technically allow for partial or total application of a relevant TSI.\n\n(3) The Competent Authority shall not make a derogation from the application of a TSI or part of a TSI unless the Secretary of State has first—\n\n(a)given notice of any intended derogation to the Commission;\n\n(b)forwarded a file to the Commission setting out the TSIs or parts of TSIs that are not to be applied; and\n\n(c)set out the specification that the Competent Authority wishes to apply to the subsystem or interoperability constituent.\n\n(4) Save for matters concerning the loading gauge and the track gauge, a derogation in relation to the circumstances or cases set out in paragraph (2)(b) shall have no effect unless the derogation has been permitted by the Commission before commencement of the physical construction of the project in which the subsystem or interoperability constituent is to be used.\n\n(5) In the circumstances or cases set out in paragraph (2)(d) a derogation shall have no effect unless the derogation has been permitted by the Commission before commencement of the physical construction of the project in which the subsystem or interoperability constituent is to be used.\n\nEssential requirements for project subsystems U.K.\n\n7.—(1) For the purposes of regulations 4(4), 4(6), 8(3)(a), 10(1) and 27(2) the essential requirements for a project subsystem shall be met by conformity with—\n\n(a)all relevant TSIs (if any); and\n\n(b)where paragraph (2) applies, the requirements of all relevant notified national technical rules (if any).\n\n(2) This paragraph applies to the project subsystem, (insofar as it is not subject to requirements by a relevant TSI), where—\n\n(a)there are no relevant TSIs; or\n\n(b)a relevant TSI does not govern all elements of the project subsystem; or\n\n(c)a derogation from conformity with the whole or part of a relevant TSI has been granted pursuant to regulation 6 in respect of that subsystem; or\n\n(d)the Competent Authority has determined under regulation 5(8) that the whole or part of a relevant TSI does not apply to that subsystem.\n\nDuties on a contracting entity U.K.\n\n8.—(1) The contracting entity in relation to a project subsystem shall—\n\n(a)appoint a
