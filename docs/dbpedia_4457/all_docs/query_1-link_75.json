        "text": "This post details my experiences with public transport in Warsaw based on recent visits to the city in the autumn of 2023 and March 2024.\n\nHere on Finding Poland, I have also described my experiences with public transport in Gdańsk – the city I’ve lived in since February 2020. Hence, it’d be interesting to compare the efficiency of the public transport network as well as ticket prices in Warsaw and Gdańsk.\n\nWhat forms of transport does the public transport network in Warsaw include?\n\nThe public transport network within the Warsaw metropolitan area boasts trams, buses, subway and SKM trains. SKM stands for Szybka Kolej Miejska (SKM, literally Urban Rapid Rail).\n\nWho manages the public transport network in Warsaw?\n\nThe local authority controlled body which manages all forms of public transport in the capital is called Zarząd Transportu Miejskiego w Warszawie, shortened to ZTM.\n\nGetting around Warsaw | General observations and impressions\n\nFrom Mokotów to the centre – and beyond\n\nI can’t profess to know everything about public transport in Warsaw. However, I’ve been to the city enough times to share what I believe are well-considered observations. Moreover, the seven days I spent in Warsaw in the autumn and 2023 and March 2024 taught me a great deal about the city’s public transport network.\n\nFirst thing’s first, leave your car at a Park and Ride car park or at your hotel. You’ll manage just fine using the public transport in Warsaw.\n\nOn both occasions, we stayed at the Holiday Inn Express hotel in the district of Mokotów. The hotel is just a ten-minute walk away from Warszawa Służewiec rail station. This station is just one stop away from Warsaw Chopin Airport. Over the years, I’ve used the SKM train (S2) to get from Warsaw Central Railway Station to the airport and vice versa many times. The journey takes a little over 20 minutes.\n\nA better option for us to get into the centre (specifically the area close to Warsaw Central train station) was to take tram 17 from the stop right behind the hotel. If the traffic lights are kind, this journey can take as little as 17 minutes.\n\nEarly confusion on Day 2\n\nOn our second day in Warsaw during our visit in the autumn, there was some confusion regarding tram 31, which also runs behind Holiday Inn. According to my interpretation of the timetable, it was supposed to go to a tram stop called Dworkowa. From there, we would have had a ten-minute walk to Park Łazienki Królewskie. However, the tram stopped close to Metro Wierzbno – some two kilometres short of Dworkowa.\n\nSo, an elderly lady informed us to use the same 75-minute tickets and take the metro three stops to Politechnika. From there, it was but a 10-minute walk to Łazienki Park.\n\nAll in all, this minor confusion didn’t alter my very favourable opinion of Warsaw’s public transport network.\n\nPublic transport tickets in Warsaw\n\nPassengers can use public transport in Warsaw on the basis of time tickets, which allow for an unlimited number of journeys, short-term tickets and long-term tickets.\n\nMost tourists should get by using time tickets (20-minute, 75-minute, 90-minute and group 75-minute) or short-term tickets (daily, three-day, weekend and group weekend).\n\nZones\n\nMost tickets are valid in both zones 1 and 2.\n\nA 75-minute ticket (individual and group) is only valid in zone 1 unless a passenger is travelling to the last stop or station on a particualr route. Frankly, I imagine that very few tourists need to venture outside city limits (i.e. into zone 2).\n\nTime tickets\n\nTime tickets are valid on all trams, buses, SKM trains and Metro.\n\n20-minute ticket – 3,40 zl\n\nA 20-minute ticket entitles a passenger to an unlimited number of journeys for a period not exceeding 20 minutes from its validation.\n\nA few notes of caution:\n\nThis ticket does not include parking at ZTM-operated park and ride facilities in Warsaw;\n\nThe SKM train journey from Warszawa Śródmieście to Warsaw Chopin Airport may last over 20 minutes. Therefore, it’s advisable to purchase a 75-minute ticket.\n\n75-minute ticket – 4,40 zl\n\nA 75-minute ticket entitles a passenger to an unlimited number of journeys for a period not exceeding 75 minutes from its validation.\n\nA few notes of caution:\n\nThis ticket does not include parking at ZTM-operated park and ride facilities in Warsaw;\n\nIf a stop or station is the last on a particular route, a 75-minute only entitles a passenger to a single journey. This journey may take longer than 75 minutes;\n\nOnly valid in zone 1.\n\nGroup 75-minute ticket – 22 zl\n\nThis unique single fare group ticket entitles a group of up to 10 people to an unlimited number of journeys for a period not exceeding 75 minutes from its validation.\n\nA few notes of caution:\n\nThis ticket does not include parking at ZTM-operated park and ride facilities in Warsaw;\n\nIf a stop or station is the last on a particular route, a 75-minute only entitles a group of passengers to a single journey. This journey may take longer than 75 minutes;\n\nOnly valid in zone 1.\n\n90-minute ticket – 7 zl\n\nA 90-minute ticket entitles a passenger to an unlimited number of journeys for a period not exceeding 90 minutes from its validation.\n\nA few notes of caution:\n\nThis ticket does not include parking at ZTM-operated park and ride facilities in Warsaw;\n\nIf a stop or station is the last on a particular route, a 90-minute only entitles a passenger to a single journey. This journey may take longer than 90 minutes.\n\nComments on the prices of time tickets in Warsaw\n\nThe first tickets I bought on this little break were 75-minute tickets. I was gobsmacked when I saw that a 75-minute ticket costs 4,40 zl. My immediate hunch was that ticket prices hadn’t increased in Warsaw for a number of years. I was right.\n\nIn an article I read on the TVN Warszawa news website, users of public transport in Warsaw have been paying the same prices since 2013. 4,40 zl for 75 minutes of travel in a well-developed European capital city – in this day and age. Astonishing.\n\nIn the same article, we learn that the Mayor of Warsaw, Rafał Trzaskowski, is in discussions with councillors regarding an increase in the prices of public transport tickets. Trzaskowski pointed out that any adjustments to prices will only apply to single/time tickets and not long-term tickets. Additionally, any forthcoming price increases should be “very small”, the Mayor said.\n\nTherefore, ticket price increases in Warsaw are inevitable for reasons that should be obvious. However, looking at the situation in other Polish cities, residents of Warsaw have never had it so good. I extend my praise to public transport authorities in major Polish cities in my post about what is cheap in Poland\n\nComparing the prices of time tickets in Warsaw and other Polish cities\n\nIn April 2023, the Public Transport Authority of Gdańsk raised the price of a one-trip costing from 3,80 zł to 4,80 zł. The Public Transport Authority in Gdańsk also introduced a 75-minute ticket which costs 6 zł. This ticket entitles passengers to an unlimited number of journeys within a 75-minute timeframe, should they to change buses or trams.\n\nI pay 117 zł for a monthly ticket in Gdańsk because it saves me from having to drive into the city centre or to nature spots I frequently visit, such as the Tri-City Landscape Park.\n\nWhen comparing prices of public transport in Warsaw with Kraków, my feeling that Varsovians have never had it so good surfaces once again. Cracovians have to fork out 6 zł for a 60-minute ticket and 8 zł for a 90-minute ticket. Given that the 75-minute time ticket does not exist in Kraków, Varsovians get an extra 15 minutes and pay 1,60 zl less when comparing the price of a 75-minute ticket in Warsaw with the price of a 60-minute ticket in Kraków.\n\nShort-term tickets in Warsaw\n\nShort-term tickets in Warsaw take the form of:\n\nOne-day ticket (24 hours) in zone 1\n\nOne-day ticket (24 hours) in both zones 1 and 2\n\nThree-day ticket (72 hours) in zone 1\n\nThree-day ticket (72 hours) valid in both zones 1 and 2\n\nWeekend ticket in both zones 1 and 2\n\nGroup weekend ticket in both zones 1 and 2\n\nHere are the prices and a few more details about all of these short-term tickets.\n\nZone 1 one-day (24h) ticket – 15 zl\n\nA one-day ticket entitles a passenger to an unlimited number of journeys over a 24-hour period from its validation.\n\nA few comments:\n\nThis ticket includes parking at ZTM-operated park and ride facilities in Warsaw;\n\nPassengers may use this ticket as part of the ZTM-KM-WKD integrated ticket offer.\n\nZones 1 and 2 one-day (24h) ticket – 26 zl\n\nA one-day ticket entitles a passenger to an unlimited number of journeys over a 24-hour period from its validation.\n\nA few comments:\n\nThis ticket includes parking at ZTM-operated park and ride facilities in Warsaw;\n\nPassengers may use this ticket as part of the ZTM-KM-WKD integrated ticket offer.\n\nZone 1 three-day (72h) ticket – 36 zl\n\nA three-day ticket entitles a passenger to an unlimited number of journeys over a 72-hour period from its validation.\n\nA few comments:\n\nThis ticket includes parking at ZTM-operated park and ride facilities in Warsaw;\n\nPassengers may use this ticket as part of the ZTM-KM-WKD integrated ticket offer.\n\nWeekend ticket – 24 zl\n\nA weekend ticket entitles a passenger to an unlimited number of journeys from 19:00 PM on Friday until 8:00 AM on Monday.\n\nA few comments:\n\nValid in both zones 1 and 2;\n\nThis ticket includes parking at ZTM-operated park and ride facilities in Warsaw;\n\nPassengers may use this ticket as part of the ZTM-KM-WKD integrated ticket offer.\n\nGroup weekend ticket – 40 zl\n\nA group weekend ticket entitles a group of up to five people to an unlimited number of journeys from 19:00 PM on Friday until 8:00 AM on Monday.\n\nA few comments:\n\nValid in both zones 1 and 2;\n\nThis ticket includes parking at ZTM-operated park and ride facilities in Warsaw;\n\nPassengers may use this ticket as part of the ZTM-KM-WKD integrated ticket offer.\n\nZones 1 and 2 and three-day (72h) ticket – 57 zl\n\nA three-day ticket entitles a passenger to an unlimited number of journeys over a 72-hour period from its validation.\n\nA few comments:\n\nThis ticket includes parking at ZTM-operated park and ride facilities in Warsaw;\n\nPassengers may use this ticket as part of the ZTM-KM-WKD integrated ticket offer.\n\nWhat is the ZTM-KM-WKD integrated ticket offer?\n\n“ZTM-KM-WKD Integrated ticket” is a special tariff offer in which the holders of short-term ZTM tickets may travel by suburban trains in Warsaw and neighbouring communes.\n\nFor more information, check out this page.\n\nAre any groups of tourists entitled to purchase reduced fare tickets in Warsaw ?\n\nAs far as I can see on the “Discount entitlements” section on the Public Transport Authority in Warsaw’s official website, only children and adolescents from October 1 in the calendar year they are 7 until they are 16 can purchase reduced fare tickets (bilet ulgowy).\n\nAlways carry an ID card or another document with a photo confirming your child’s date of birth.\n\nAre any groups of tourists entitled to use public transport in Warsaw free of charge?\n\nAs far as I can see on the “Discount entitlements” section on the Public Transport Authority in Warsaw’s official website, the following groups of people can use public transport in Warsaw free of charge:\n\nChildren from their birth until September 30 in the calendar year when they are 7 years old\n\nPeople over the age of 70\n\nAs with the reduced fare tickets, carry an ID card or another document with a photo confirming your date of birth.\n\nForms of public transport in Warsaw\n\nAs I’ve already pointed out, the public transport network within the Warsaw metropolitan area comprises trams, buses, subway and SKM trains.\n\nRead on to find out more about some key bus routes and metro stops which might be interesting for tourists.\n\nThe Bus Network in Warsaw\n\nWarsaw’s bus network is the most extensive means of transport in the city. Naturally, it is the least reliable form of public transport due to traffic jams.\n\nThere are over 200 daily bus lines in Warsaw. There are also around 50 suburban services and over 40 buses that run regularly during the night.\n\nRecommended bus lines for tourists\n\n116 + 180 – Royal Route in Warsaw\n\nThe stop Pl. Zamkowy 01 (Krakowskie Przedmieście Street) is but a five minute walk from The Royal Castle in the Old Town of Warsaw.\n\nFrom this stop, you can take either bus 116 or 180 to both Łazienki Królewskie Park (10 minutes) and Wilanów Palace and Park (30 minutes in total from Pl.Zamkowy 01).\n\n175 – Warsaw Chopin Airport bus\n\nWarsaw Chopin Airport to/from the Main Railway Station (Dw. Centralny).\n\nIn light traffic, it should take no longer than 22-25 minutes to get from the stop in front of airport arrivals to the centre (and vice versa of course).\n\nFor the Old Town/Nowy Świat Street, get off at the stop Foksal 02.\n\nThe Metro Network in Warsaw\n\nThere are two metro lines in Warsaw:\n\n1. M1 – from north to south\n\nKey stops include:\n\nDworzec Gdański – A short walk from Westfield Arkadia shopping centre\n\nPlac Wilsona – Check out the district of Stary Żoliborz (Old Żoliborz)\n\n2.
