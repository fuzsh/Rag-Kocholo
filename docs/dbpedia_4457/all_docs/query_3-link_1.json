The infrastructure manager, in consultation with the applicant, shall make every effort to ensure that any tests take place within three months of receipt of the applicant’s request. Where appropriate, the safety authority shall take measures to ensure that the tests take place.\n\n(6) In the case of paragraph (9), the safety authority shall issue vehicle authorisations for placing on the market or inform the applicant of its negative decision within a predetermined, reasonable time, and in any case within four months of receipt of all relevant information from the applicant applied in accordance with Article 21(4).\n\n(7) As part of the assessment pursuant to Article 21(5)(a) and (b) and in the case of justified doubts, the safety authority may request that tests be conducted on the network. In order to facilitate those tests, the safety authority may issue temporary authorisations to the applicant to use the vehicle for tests on the network. The infrastructure manager shall make every effort to ensure that any such test takes place within three months of the request of the safety authority.\n\n(8) The safety authority shall cooperate with the Agency with a view to reaching a mutually acceptable assessment under Article 21(5) and (7).\n\n(9) Where the area of use is limited to a network or networks within the State, the safety authority may, under its own responsibility and when the applicant so requests, issue the vehicle authorisation for placing on the market. In order to issue such authorisations, the safety authority shall assess the file in relation to the elements specified in paragraph (4) and in accordance with the procedures to be established in the implementing act adopted pursuant to Article 21(9). Within one month of receipt of the request of the applicant, the safety authority shall inform the applicant that the file is complete or ask for relevant supplementary information. The authorisation shall also be valid without extension of the area of use for vehicles travelling to stations in neighbouring Member States with similar network characteristics, when those stations are close to the border, following consultation of the competent national safety authorities.\n\nThis consultation may be carried out on a case-by-case basis or set out in a cross-border agreement between national safety authorities. If the area of use is limited to the territory of the State and in the event of non-application of one or more TSIs or parts of them as referred to in Regulation 7, the safety authority shall issue the vehicle authorisation only after application of the procedure laid down in that Regulation. The safety authority shall take full responsibility for the authorisations it issues.\n\n(10) Vehicle authorisations for placing on the market shall state:\n\n(a) the area of use;\n\n(b) the values of the parameters set out in the TSIs and, where applicable, in the national rules, for checking the technical compatibility between the vehicle and the area of use;\n\n(c) the vehicle’s compliance with the relevant TSIs and sets of national rules, relating to the parameters referred to in subparagraph (b);\n\n(d) the conditions for use of the vehicle and other restrictions.\n\n(11) Any decision refusing the vehicle authorisation for placing on the market or excluding part of the network in accordance with a negative assessment as referred to in Article 21(7) shall be duly substantiated. The applicant may, within a period of one month from receipt of the negative decision, request that the safety authority review the decision. The safety authority shall have two months from the date of receipt of the request for review in which to confirm or reverse its decision.\n\nIf the negative decision of the safety authority is confirmed, the applicant may bring an appeal before an appeal panel set up by the safety authority and independent of the safety authority. The appeal panel shall determine its own procedure and may confirm, reverse or vary the decision. The decision of the appeal panel is final, save on a specified point of law an appeal lies to the Circuit Court in whose circuit the applicant carries on business.\n\n(12) In the event of renewal or upgrading of existing vehicles which already have a vehicle authorisation for placing on the market, a new vehicle authorisation for placing on the market shall be required if -\n\n(a) changes are made to the values of the parameters referred to in subparagraph (b) of paragraph (10) which are outside the range of acceptable parameters as defined in the TSIs,\n\n(b) the overall safety level of the vehicle concerned may be adversely affected by the works envisaged, or\n\n(c) it is required by the relevant TSIs.\n\n(13) Where the applicant wishes to extend the area of use of a vehicle which has already been authorised, it shall supplement the file with the relevant documents referred to in paragraph (4) concerning the additional area of use. The applicant shall submit the file to the Agency. If the applicant has received a vehicle authorisation in accordance with paragraph (9) and wishes to extend the area of use within the State, it shall supplement the file with the relevant documents referred to in paragraph (4) concerning the additional area of use. It shall submit the file to the safety authority which shall, after following the procedures laid down in paragraph (9) issue an updated authorisation covering the extended area of use.\n\n(14) This Regulation shall not apply to freight wagons or passenger coaches which are in shared use with third countries, the track gauge of which is different from that of the main rail network within the European Union and authorised in accordance with a different vehicle authorisation procedure. The rules governing the procedure for authorisation of such vehicles shall be published and notified to the European Commission. The conformity of those vehicles with the essential requirements of these Regulations shall be ensured by the railway undertaking concerned in the context of its safety management system. If such rules are not compliant, the safety authority shall cooperate with the European Commission in order to lay down appropriate actions to be taken, involving relevant international bodies, if necessary.\n\n(15) This Regulation does not apply to locomotives or self-propelling trains arriving from third countries and intended to run until a station that is situated close to the border in its territory and designated for cross-border operations. The conformity of such vehicles with the essential requirements of the Directive shall be ensured by the railway undertaking concerned in the context of its safety management system and, where relevant, in accordance with Article 10(9) of Directive (EU) 2016/798.\n\n(16) Where the Agency or the safety authority has authorised the placing on the market of a vehicle in accordance with Article 21, section 43 of the Act of 2005 shall not apply.\n\nChecks before the use of authorised vehicles\n\n22. (1) Before a railway undertaking uses a vehicle in the area of use specified in its authorisation for placing on the market, it shall check:\n\n(a) that the vehicle has been authorised for placing on the market in accordance with Regulation 21 and is duly registered;\n\n(b) that the vehicle is compatible with the route on the basis of the infrastructure register, the relevant TSIs or any relevant information to be provided by the infrastructure manager free of charge and within a reasonable period of time, where such a register does not exist or is incomplete;\n\n(c) that the vehicle is properly integrated in the composition of the train where it is intended to operate, taking into account the safety management system set out in the Railway Safety Regulations and the TSI on operation and traffic management.\n\n(2) For the purposes of paragraph (1), the railway undertaking may carry out tests in cooperation with the infrastructure manager. The infrastructure manager, in consultation with the applicant, shall make every effort to ensure that any tests take place within three months of receipt of the applicant’s request.\n\n(3) A railway undertaking who fails to comply with this Regulation commits an offence and is liable on summary conviction to a class A fine.\n\nType authorisation of vehicles\n\n23. (1) The safety authority may, where appropriate, in accordance with the procedure laid down in Regulation 21, grant vehicle type authorisations. The application for a vehicle type authorisation and information about all applications, the stages of the relevant procedures and their outcome, and, where applicable, the requests and decisions of the Board of Appeal shall be submitted through the one-stop shop referred to in Article 12 of Regulation (EU) 2016/796.\n\n(2) If the safety authority issues a vehicle authorisation for placing on the market, it shall at the same time as the applicant’s request issue the vehicle type authorisation, which is related to the same area of use of the vehicle.\n\n(3) In the event of changes to any relevant provisions in TSIs or national rules, on the basis of which an authorisation of a vehicle type has been issued, the TSI or national rule shall determine whether the vehicle type authorisation already granted remains valid or needs to be renewed. If that authorisation needs to be renewed, the checks performed by the safety authority may only concern the changed rules.\n\n(4) The declaration of conformity to type shall be established in accordance with:\n\n(a) the verification procedures of the relevant TSIs; or\n\n(b) where TSIs do not apply, the conformity assessment procedures as defined in modules B+D, B+F and H1 of Decision No 768/2008/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 9 July 20088 .\n\n(5) The authorisation of vehicle types shall be registered in the European register of authorised vehicle types referred to in Article 48.\n\nConformity of vehicles with an authorised vehicle type\n\n24. (1) A vehicle or a series of vehicles which is in conformity with an authorised vehicle type shall, without further checks, receive a vehicle authorisation in accordance with Regulation 21 on the basis of a declaration of conformity to that vehicle type submitted by the applicant.\n\n(2) The renewal of the authorisation of a vehicle type as referred to in Regulation 23(3) shall not affect vehicle authorisations for placing on the market already issued on the basis of the previous authorisation to place that vehicle type on the market.\n\nTransitional regime for using vehicles\n\n25. (1) Authorisations for the placing in service of vehicles which have been granted pursuant to the provisions set out in Chapter V of Directive 2008/57/EC9 and all other authorisations granted prior to 15 June 2016, including authorisations delivered under international agreements, in particular RIC (Regolamento Internazionale Carrozze) and RIV (Regolamento Internazionale Veicoli), shall remain valid in accordance with the conditions under which the authorisations have been granted.\n\n(2) Vehicles authorised for placing in service pursuant to Article 54(1) and (2) shall receive a new vehicle authorisation for placing on the market in order to operate on one or more networks which are not yet covered by their authorisation. The placing on the market on those additional networks shall be subject to Regulation 21.\n\nNon-compliance of vehicles or vehicle types with essential requirements\n\n26. (1) When a railway undertaking finds, during operation, that a vehicle it is using does not meet one of the applicable essential requirements, it shall take the necessary corrective measures in order to bring the vehicle into conformity.\n\nFurthermore, it may inform the Agency, the safety authority and any other national safety authority concerned of the measures taken. If the railway undertaking has evidence that the non-compliance existed already at the time when the authorisation for placing on the market was issued, it shall inform the Agency, the safety authority and any other national safety authority concerned.\n\n(2) When the safety authority becomes aware, for instance within the process of supervision provided for in the Railway Safety Regulations, that a vehicle or a vehicle type to which an authorisation for placing on the market was granted either by the Agency, in accordance with Article 21(5) or Regulation 23 or by the safety authority, in accordance with Regulation 21(9) or 23, when used as intended, does not meet one of the applicable essential requirements, it shall inform the railway undertaking using the vehicle or the vehicle type and ask it to take the necessary corrective measures in order to bring the vehicle into conformity. The safety authority shall inform the Agency and any other national safety authorities concerned, including those in a territory where application for authorisation for placing on the market for a vehicle of the same type is on-going.\n\n(3) When, in the cases set out in paragraph (1) or (2), the corrective measures applied by the railway undertaking do not ensure conformity with the applicable essential requirements and that non-conformity leads to a serious safety risk, the safety authority may apply temporary safety measures under its supervision tasks, in accordance with the Railway Safety Regulations. Temporary safety measures in the form of a suspension of type authorisation of a vehicle may be applied by the safety authority.\n\n(4) Where the safety authority suspends type authorisation under paragraph (3), the railway undertaking concerned may make representations, within 14 days of notice of the suspension, to the safety authority, who shall consider them. If the safety authority confirms its decision, the undertaking may, with 7 days of notice of the decision, appeal to the judge of the Circuit Court in whose circuit it carries on business against the suspension. The judge may confirm the decision or direct the safety authority to restore the type authorisation. The decision of the judge is final, other than on a point of law, which lies to the High Court.\n\n(5) In the cases referred to in paragraph (3), where appropriate, the safety authority, following a review of the effectiveness of any measures taken to address the serious safety risk, may decide to revoke or amend the authorisation when it is proven that an essential requirement was not met at the time of authorisation. To that end, it shall notify its decision to the holder of the authorisation for placing on the market or of the vehicle type authorisation, giving the reasons for its decisions. The holder may, within a period of one month from receipt of the decision of the safety authority, request it to review the decision. In that case, the decision to revoke shall be temporarily suspended. The safety authority shall have one month from the date of receipt of the request for review in which to confirm or reverse its decision.\n\nWhere relevant, in the event of disagreement between the Agency and the safety authority concerning the need to restrict or revoke the authorisation, the arbitration procedure provided for in Article 21(7) shall be followed. If the result of that procedure is that the vehicle authorisation is neither to be restricted nor revoked, the temporary safety measures referred to in paragraph (3) shall be suspended.\n\n(6) If the decision of the Agency is confirmed, the holder of the vehicle authorisation may bring an appeal before the Board of Appeal designated under Article 55 of Regulation (EU) 2016/796 within the time limit referred to in Article 59 of that Regulation.\n\n(7) If the decision of the safety authority is confirmed, the holder of the vehicle authorisation may bring an appeal, within two months of the notification of that decision, to the High Court. The court may confirm or reverse the decision (with or without modification). The decision of the High Court is final, other than on a point of law, which lies to the Court of Appeal.\n\n(8) When the safety authority decides to revoke an authorisation for placing on the market which it has granted, it shall forthwith inform the Agency thereof and give the reasons for its decision.\n\n(9) The decision of the safety authority to revoke the authorisation shall be reflected in the vehicle register, or, in the case of an authorisation of a vehicle type, in the European register of authorised vehicle types in accordance with Article 24(7). The safety authority shall ensure that railway undertakings using vehicles of the same type as the vehicle or type subject to the revocation are properly informed. Such railway undertakings shall first check whether the same problem of non-compliance applies. In that event, the procedure provided for in this Regulation shall apply.\n\n(10) When an authorisation for placing on the market is revoked, the vehicle concerned shall no longer be used and its area of use shall not be extended. When a vehicle type authorisation is revoked, vehicles built on the basis of it shall not be placed on the market or, if they had already been placed on the market, they shall be withdrawn. A new authorisation may be requested on the basis of the procedure provided for in Regulation 21 in the case of individual vehicles or Regulation 23 in the case of a vehicle type.\n\n(11) When, in the cases provided for in paragraph (1) or (2), the non-compliance with the essential requirements is limited to part of the area of use of the vehicle concerned and such non-compliance already existed at the time when the authorisation for placing on the market was issued, the latter shall be amended to exclude the parts of the area of use concerned.\n\nPart 6\n\nConformity Assessment Bodies\n\nNotifying authority\n\n27.
