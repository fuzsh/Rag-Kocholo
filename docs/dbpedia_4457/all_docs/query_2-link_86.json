In addition to the Type Approval certificate of the products in the shipment, the exporter needs to submit the shipping and commercial documents to get the Shipment that is valid for that shipment only.\n\nUL Type Examination Certification Scheme\n\nThe UL Type Examination Certification is a voluntary certification scheme, owned by UL Solutions, indicating that a product has been tested and found to comply with the requirements of the standard(s) listed on the UL Type Examination Certificate.\n\nProducts to be certified under the UL Type Examination Certification Scheme are those covered by applicable International and European standards for electrical safety, explosion safety, EMC, performance and/or standard(s) having construction, testing or other requirements containing clear pass/fail criteria for the products in the scope of the standard(s).\n\nStandards other than International (IEC/ISO) and European (EN), such as National Standards based on IEC standards or other standards (e.g., issued by IEEE, ICEA) may be considered by the Certification Body for issuance of UL Type Examination Certificate.\n\nCompliant end-products and components are eligible for certification under this scheme and will be authorized by the authorized UL LLC to be referred to as certified under the UL Type Examination Certification Scheme.\n\nContractual Agreement - Service Terms for UL Type Examination Certification Service Terms.\n\nU.S. Safety Scheme\n\nThis scheme may also be referred to in some historical texts as the UL Listing, Classification and Recognition Program. In this scheme, tangible products are certified to requirements for safety that are associated with fire, shock and casualty hazards.\n\nSamples of products are tested, inspected, examined and otherwise evaluated to gather information that demonstrates the product fulfills applicable requirements. Fulfillment of all applicable requirements must be demonstrated before authorization is granted to apply a certification mark used in this scheme.\n\nVisits to factories that apply marks to products certified in this scheme are completed periodically to verify product and production characteristics as an assurance the original demonstration of fulfillment of requirements continues to be valid. For some products, factory samples are selected for retesting.\n\nChanges to certified products are considered and, if needed, additional tests, inspections, examinations or other evaluations are completed to demonstrate a product continues to fulfill requirements and authorization to apply a mark can continue. Unresolved noncompliances with requirements result in termination of authorization to apply the mark.\n\nUse of the mark can also be terminated voluntarily. The use of the markings shown and explained below is authorized and controlled by UL LLC to indicate a product has been certified using the U.S. Safety Scheme. A directory of certified products is available online via the Product iQ database.
