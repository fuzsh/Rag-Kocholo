        "text": "The EU AI Act introduces new obligations to entities located within the EU and elsewhere. Use our interactive tool to determine whether or not your AI system will be subject to these.\n\nIf you would like to stay updated about your obligations under the EU AI Act, we recommend subscribing to the EU AI Act Newsletter.\n\nFor further clarity, we recommend that you seek professional legal advice and follow national guidance. More information about EU AI Act enforcement in your country will likely be provided in 2024.\n\nFeedback – We are working to improve this tool. Please send feedback to Taylor Jones at taylor@futureoflife.org\n\nThe text used in this tool is the ‘Artificial Intelligence Act (Regulation (EU) 2024/1689), Official Journal version of 13 June 2024’. Interinstitutional File: 2021/0106(COD)\n\nChangelog\n\n26 March 2024\n\nFixed a bug which prevented Deployers from receiving their obligations under Article 29.\n\nRemoved the following notice in the ‘High-risk Obligations’ result: “An additional exclusion for systems that are “purely accessory in respect of the relevant action or decision to be taken” will be defined no later than one year after the AI Act is introduced.” This exclusion is no longer present in Article 7 of the final draft.\n\n11 March 2024\n\nUpdated the Compliance Checker to reflect the ‘Final draft’ of the AI Act.\n\nData Privacy: In order to email your results to you we are required to store your inputs from this form, including your email address.

We are in no way affiliated with the European Union. We have developed this tool voluntarily in order to aid the effective implementation of the AI Act, because we believe the AI Act supports our mission to ensure that AI technology remains beneficial for life, and avoids extreme large-scale risks.\n\nCan I integrate this tool in my own website?\n\nOur tool is built in a way that makes it difficult to support implementation on other sites. We do not have an API available. Therefore, for almost all cases, we suggest that you make this tool available to users of your website by linking to this webpage – you are welcome to use these mockup image to feature the tool on your site.\n\nWhen does the EU AI Act come into effect?\n\nThe EU AI Act came into force on 1 August 2024. There now follows an implementation period of two to three years as various parts of the Act come into force on different dates. Our implementation timeline provides an overview of all key dates relating to the Act’s implementation.\n\nDuring the implementation period, the European standards bodies are expected to develop standards for the AI Act.\n\nWhat are the categories of risk defined by the EU AI Act?\n\nThe Act’s regulatory framework defines four levels of risk for AI systems: unacceptable, high, limited, and minimal or no risk. Systems posing unacceptable risks, such as threatening people’s safety, livelihood, and rights – from social scoring by governments to toys using voice assistance – will be prohibited. High-risk systems, such as those used in critical infrastructure or law enforcement, will face strict requirements, including around risk assessment, data quality, documentation, transparency, human oversight, and accuracy. Systems posing limited risks, like chatbots, must adhere to transparency obligations so users know they are not interacting with humans. Minimal risk systems like games and spam filters can be freely used.\n\nWhat share of AI systems will fall into the high-risk category?\n\nIt is uncertain what share of AI systems will be in the high-risk category, as both the field of AI and the law are still evolving. The European Commission estimated in an impact study that only 5-15% of applications would be subject to stricter rules. A study by appliedAI of 106 enterprise AI systems found that 18% were high-risk, 42% low-risk, and 40% unclear if high or low risk. The system with unclear risk classification in this study were mainly within the areas of critical infrastructure, employment, law enforcement, and product safety. In a related survey of 113 EU AI startups, 33% of the startups surveyed believed that their AI systems would be classified as high-risk, compared to the 5-15% assessed by the European Commission.\n\nWhat are the penalties of the EU AI Act?\n\nBased on the European Parliament’s adopted position, using prohibited AI practices outlined in Article 5 can result in fines of up to €40 million, or 7% of worldwide annual turnover – whichever is higher. Not complying with the data governance requirements (under Article 10) and the requirements for transparency and provision of information (under Articles 13) can lead to fines up to €20 million, or 4% of worldwide turnover if that is higher. Non-compliance with any other requirements or obligations can result in fines of up to €10 million or 2% of worldwide turnover – again, whichever is higher. Fines are tiered depending on the provision violated, with prohibited practices receiving the highest penalties and other violations receiving lower maximum fines.\n\nWhat measures does the EU AI Act implement for SMEs specifically?\n\nThe EU AI Act aims to provide support for SMEs and startups as specified in Article 55. Specific measures include granting priority access for SMEs and EU-based startups to regulatory sandboxes if eligibility criteria are met. Additionally, tailored awareness raising and digital skills development activities will be organised to address the needs of smaller organisations. Moreover, dedicated communication channels will be set up to offer guidance and respond to queries from SMEs and startups. Participation of SMEs and other stakeholders in the standards development process will also be encouraged. To reduce the financial burden of compliance, conformity assessment fees will be lowered for SMEs and startups based on factors like development stage, size, and market demand. The Commission will regularly review certification and compliance costs for SMEs/startups (with input from transparent consultations) and work with Member States to reduce these costs where possible.\n\nCan I voluntarily comply with the EU AI Act even if my system is not in scope?\n\nYes! The Commission, the AI Office, and/or Member States will encourage voluntary codes of conduct for requirements under Title III, Chapter 2 (e.g. risk management, data governance, and human oversight) for AI systems not deemed to be high-risk. These codes of conduct will provide technical solutions for how an AI system can meet the requirements, according to the system’s intended purpose. Other objectives like environmental sustainability, accessibility, stakeholder participation, and diversity of development teams will be considered. Small businesses and startups will be taken into account when encouraging codes of conduct. See Article 69 on Codes of Conduct for Voluntary Application of Specific Requirements."
