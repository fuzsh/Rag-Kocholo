        "text": "Applying for a visa\n\nAn EU student can enter Poland with ID document (a valid travel document e.g. passport) or another document certifying identity and citizenship. If a student intends to visit Poland's neighboring countries (not all of them are EU Member States), a passport is recommended. For stay up to 3 months no legalization of stay is necessary. For stay exceeding 3 months an EU student has to register the residence. In case of students the registration is issued for one year (possibility to prolong). The document is issued by the Department of Citizens Affairs of the Voivodeship Office (province administration, Urząd Wojewódzki).\n\nNational Visa\n\nNon-EU students can enter Poland on the basis of a valid travel document (passport) and a visa. A student of a non-EU country has to obtain a visa from the Polish Embassy or Consulate. A short-term visa entitles the holder to stay in Poland for up to 3 months, a long-term visa up to 1 year. Prolongation of a visa in Poland is possible only in cases of force majeure or situation impossible to foresee while applying for the visa in the consulate. The visa can be prolonged only once. National visa is usually given for the purpose of undertaking academic study.\n\nIn case of being granted a student visa, when you are traveling to Poland, please carry your acceptance letter from the university and other related documents. At the border control when entering Poland and consequently European Union first time, you will be asked what your purpose is and if necessary, requested to provide proof of that purpose. Student visa also allows you to travel in the Schengen zone up to 90 days only, and remember that with Polish national visa, your first entry to EU must be Poland. After getting stamp that you entered Poland, you may travel for e.g. to Germany, Slovakia for touristic purposes solely.\n\nhttps://www.e-konsulat.gov.pl/\n\nYour legal stay in Poland\n\nNotwithstanding the visa, after your coming to Poland you have to legalize your stay by applying for the temporary resident permit (TRP) before your visa expires. All international students staying in Poland longer than three months need to obtain TRP. The permit is issued for the period of your stay in Poland, but not longer than two years (usually first one is for 15 months).\n\nEvidence of the permit is the Temporary Residence Card (TRC) is an identity card for foreigners in Poland and it (with a passport included) allows passing the border as often as required without having a visa.\n\nIf you are an EU student, there is no need to apply for this card, you only need to register your stay in Lower Silesian Governor’s Office (Urząd Wojewódzki we Wrocławiu) in cases when your stay exceeds 90 days.\n\nIf you are a non-EU student, you need to apply for this card before your visa expires. Based on the visa type and its valid duration, you must be aware of all the aspects of your legal stay in Poland throughout study period. Until the expiry date of your visa, your stay in Poland is legal, however in order to prolong it, you either need to travel back to your home country to apply for another visa before it expires, or apply for Temporary Residence Card while in Poland. Temporary Residence Card is granted within 8-10 months (due to big numer of applicants) depending on complexity of the case. Original documents must be shown to the officer (Inspektor).\n\nDuring the period when your application is being considered, you will be receiving letters from Inspektor, and make sure to follow and submit accurate information, and keep them. Also, while your application is being reviewed and that time your visa expires, you must not go out of Poland without getting a positive response and finally being granted residence permit. When your application is under consideration, and your visa is no longer valid, you are allowed to stay only within Poland until you get response from Urząd. You cannot travel in the Schengen zone either. If you cross the Polish border, you will not enter back without another visa issued by a Polish Embassy in your home country. Please familiarize yourself and read more about your legal status in Poland (depending on the citizenship you hold) in order to avoid unwanted situations.\n\nAll documents in any other language than Polish should be translated by a certified translator into Polish language.\n\nPlease follow the link below and download \"wniosek o zezwolenie na pobyt czasowy\":\n\nhttps://www.duw.pl/pl/obsluga-klienta/cudzoziemcy/formularze-do-pobrania...\n\nIn order to obtain any more information, please see the link:\n\nhttps://www.duw.pl/pl/wersje-jezkowe/english-version\n\nPlease remember that you need to book a meeting slot in Urzad Wojewodzki, more info: https://przybysz.duw.pl/en/\n\nuseful info: https://www.mos.cudzoziemcy.gov.pl/en\n\nAccommodation\n\nThe University can provide International Students with double at one of our student residences called \"Ołówek\", \"Kredka\", \"Dwudziestolatka\", \"Słowianka\" and \"Parawanowiec\" which are situated in the city center.

A cheaper option is to rent a room or shared room (from 700 to 1500 PLN). For detailed information on accommodation options and the costs of transport, food, sports and entertainment please see here.\n\nIf you start full-degree studies in English at the University of Wroclaw as an international student please know that you need to apply for dormitory directly by the website by which you apply for studies. After payment of tuition fee you will receive Final Admission documents and an option to apply for dorm will be visible on your account.\n\nArrival to Wrocław\n\nThe cheapest way to get to the Dormitory from the Airport or from Main Railway Station (Wrocław Głowny) is to use a bus or a tram.\n\nThere is a very useful website which will help you in finding your way. You just need to fill out \"traveling from\" (for Airport put: PORT LOTNICZY, for main railway Station: DWORZEC GŁ. PKP) and \"traveling to\" (address of your hotel) fields and the program will find you connection and time of departure.\n\nYou can of course take a taxi, the cost is around 15€ or 20€ from the airport to the city centre and 5€ or 10€ from the main station. It is better to ask about the price before you take a taxi just to avoid dishonest drivers.\n\nPUBLIC TRANSPORT\n\nWroclaw has an extensive public transport network. Unfortunately we don't have an underground, but we do have a well-developed tramway system.\n\nTrams do not run during the night, whereas buses run around the clock (not all of them, of course, as there's no need for that).\n\nIn Wroclaw there are daytime normal routes, designated by black numbers from 100 do 149, and express routes, designated by red letters: A, C, D, E, K, and N. Suburban routes are numbered 604 to 623.Night routes are designated by black numbers from 240 to 259; night buses run only once an hour.\n\nPublic transport fares:\n\nSingle-trip (regular fare) 4,60 zł\n\n15-minute, all lines within and outside city limits (regular fare) 3,20 zł\n\n30-minute, all lines within and outside city limits (regular fare) 4,00 zł\n\n60-minute, all lines within and outside city limits (regular fare) 5,20 zł\n\n90-minute, all lines within and outside city limits (regular fare) 7,00 zł\n\n24-hour, all lines within and outside city limits (regular fare) 15,00 zł\n\n48-hour, all lines within and outside city limits (regular fare) 26,00 zł\n\n72-hour, all lines within and outside city limits (regular fare) 32,00 zł\n\n168-hour, all lines within and outside city limits (regular fare) 54,00zł\n\nYou can buy it in special machines which you can find at almost every bus and tram stops.\n\nUpon your arrival you can buy single-trip tickets in newsagents at the Airport or at the Main Station. You can also buy it in bus and tram useing special machine (you can pay by card only).\n\nAfter entering the bus or the tram you must validate your ticket.\n\nThere is also a very useful website if you want to travel by train. You just need to fill out \" from\" (for e.g WARSZAWA CENTRALNA - main station in Warsaw) and \" to\" (WROCŁAW GŁÓWNY - main station in Wrocław) fields and the program will find you the best connection and the time of departure.\n\nLiving Costs\n\nApproximate food prices:\n\nbread -1 loaf- 2,50-3,00 PLN/0,72-0,86 EUR\n\nbutter - 3,50-5,00 PLN/0,88-1,25 EUR /200 g\n\neggs - 0,50 PLN/0,15 EUR/each\n\nmeat - 10-30 PLN/2,60-7,25 EUR/kg\n\ncheese - 12-40 PLN/3,40-11,00 EUR/kg\n\nfruit - 2,50-15 PLN/0,62 - 4,20 EUR/kg\n\nmineral water - 2,50 PLN/0.70 EUR/1,5 l bottle\n\nAdditional expenses:\n\nPhone bills 25-100 PLN/6-23 EUR\n\nCinema ticket 18-25 PLN/4,2-6 EUR\n\nConcert/festivals 50-150 PLN/11-35 EUR\n\nPlease bear in mind that the table shows approximate numbers and they vary vastly depending on your lifestyle, personal financial management and your priorities.\n\nMedical Insurance\n\nHealth services in Poland are available for students from the EU or EFTA member countries, provided that they have valid medical insurance in the national insurance system of any EU or EEC member country. A valid passport, student Identity Card or doctoral student Identity Card and a valid Medical Insurance European Card entitles its holder to medical care services free of charge.\n\nIf possible it is recommended that students purchase their own international medical insurance prior to arrival in Poland. Otherwise students from non-EU or non-EFTA countries are required to sign a voluntary health insurance agrement with the National Health Fund (NFZ) and pay their own insurance fees. Detailed information about NFZ is available at https://www.nfz-wroclaw.pl/\n\nNational Health Fund (NFZ), ul. Dawida St. 2, 50-527 Wrocław. Mon-Fri 08:00-16:00\n\nIn order to process and obtain health insurance from NFZ, you need student card, certificate from Dean’s Office confirming your student status and its duration, and a passport.\n\nAfter signing a paper of application for health insurance, you usually wait up to two weeks and then go back to NFZ and sign the contract. With this contract, you go to ZUS Zakład Ubezpieczeń Społecznych, to process and register this contract. You pay 55,80 PLN per month, until 15th of each month in Poczta Polska or through bank transfer. It is advisable to pay at the post office in case you will go to hospital you shall show the payment of your insurance in order to be entitled to medical services. The contract does not have expiration date, for it stops being valid when you do not pay the monthly fee.\n\nAs this insurance is valid only in Poland, if you want to travel to other EU countries you will need European Health Insurance Card which is given on the basis of NFZ insurance. The card is issued for two months period for international students in Poland and needs to be updated in order to be relevant.\n\nThere is also possibility of buying private turistic insurance valid in Poland from your home country or look for private insurance from Poland for foreigners (for exapmle AXA ASSISTANCE).\n\nEmergency Numbers\n\nIf something bad happens, you should phone the police or go to the nearest police station. You cannot expect the policemen to speak English fluently, so if you don't feel comforta­ble with your Polish skills, ask a Polish friend to go there with you. If there is nobody to go with you, remember that the police are obliged to provide you with a sworn translator.\n\nWe know that many of you will take a trip to the Polish mountains. In the Tatra, which are over 2000 meters high, you should be especially prepared to contact the mountain emergency service GOPR if things go awry. Always have your mobile with you and in case of emergency call 0601 100 300. There is also an emer­gency service in the lakes area, Maz­ury: 0601 100 100 (Mazurska Służba Ratownicza).\n\nIf you lose your passport, you have to contact your embassy to get a replacement. Keep a photo­copy of your passport (pages with your picture and visa) just in case. If you lose any of your home country documents - passport, ID, Student ID - you will need to obtain a police certificate for this. You can get one at a police station.\n\nEMERGENCY CALLS\n\n112 - emergency number for all the three - police, fire and ambulance service\n\n999 - emergency ambulance service\n\n997 - police\n\n998 - fire department\n\nCalling these numbers is free of charge both from a phone box and mobile. You can dial them even if you do not have any credit on your mobile, and even without entering the PIN code.\n\nHere are the adresses of some medical centers in Wroclaw:\n\nSpecjalistyczna Przychodnia Lekarska VITA ul.

You can also check there the teacher name and his/her office hours and contact data.\n\nTo log in to your USOS for the first time you have to use your student number (written on student ID) and restore the password.\n\nIn case of any problems with USOSweb you should contact the USOS office: usosweb@uwr.edu.pl or your Programme Coordinator.\n\nEDUROAM\n\nWhat is eduroam?\n\nEduroam is the secure service which allows students, staff and researchers from participating institutions get access to the WiFi network. Eduroam allows users to use their own credentials (login and password) from their home institution in every place where this network is accessible.\n\nYou can find more information on the webpage http://www.eduroam.org\n\nHow can I get access to eduroam at the University of Wroclaw?\n\nIf you are our student or a member of university staff, you have an account (login and password) in the Office 365 system, which can be used to login to the eduroam network as well. All you need is just a little configuration on your network device (computer, mobile, tablet etc.)\n\nMany times I've been using the WiFi network and it's been damn easy. Why now does it sound so complicated (accounts, configuration, supplicants, certificates)?\n\nContrary to many other WiFi networks, where password is shared among many users or its lifetime and range are limited, getting access to eduroam you have to type your own login and your secret password. That’s why you have to be sure that your credentials are kept secure even when you are visiting other institution (university). In eduroam your credentials are never shared or locally checked but are forwarded to your home institution and only there they can be verified and validated.\n\nI'm a guest at the University of Wroclaw, I was using eduroam at my home university, do I have to reconfigure my computer to get access here.\n\nNo. You don't.\n\nEven if you got an access to our services (ex. USOSWeb or Office 365), but you still have account at your home institution, you should use that account and configuration and you don't need to change anything.\n\nHow can I configure my computer to connect to eduroam?\n\nMost of the new OS (Operating System) like Windows 8.1 (and newer), Androids and Apple OS X, have all the features which are needed to connect to eduroam. Some of them require quite mysterious configuration (Android, see instruction below the text), others working at default (Windows 10), but for the security reasons it's advisable to download the Configuration Assistant Tool (CAT) from the webpage http://cat.eduroam.org. To do it, click the link \"Download your eduroam installer\", then choose \"University of Wroclaw\" from the list.\n\nWhat is my login?\n\nYour eduroam login is simply your email address in the Office 365 account. It consists of two parts: your student number (index_numer) plus @uwr.edu.pl (our university domain name). For example:\n\n3453525@uwr.edu.pl\n\nBear in mind, that using our inner systems for instance USOSWeb (https://usosweb.uni.wroc.pl) is possible to type only your student_number as a login name, but in systems like eduroam or e-mail, which can be use all over the world, the login name must be globally unique and always must be written with the domain name.\n\nWhat is my password?\n\nI hope that you've already read the answer to the previous question. If you are using (successfully) your university e-mail (student number@uwr.edu.pl), you should use the same credentials in eduroam. The default password to that system was sent to your private e-mail account, which you gave us enrolling to our university. If you lost that e-mail or don’t remember you password to office 365 email account you can change it on the webpage: https://portal.uwr.edu.pl/resethasla. After feeling up a short reset password form you will find an e-mail with the reset code in that private email box.\n\nBe aware that the USOSWeb account, although looks similar, is different from Office 365, and shouldn’t be used in the eduroam network.\n\nIt is advisable to login in office 365 (https://portal.uwr.edu.pl) before using eduroam, to make sure that your password is correct and your account is fully functional.\n\nThe default password, which was sent to your private e-mail account can and should be changed. It’s quite complicated so it’s better to use a method “copy” and “paste” instead of rewriting it. A new password must fulfill password requirement policy, so it must:\n\nBe a minimum of eight (8) characters in length\n\nBe memorized; if a password is written down it must be secure\n\nContain at least one (1) character from three (3) of the following categories:\n\nUppercase letter (A-Z)\n\nLowercase letter (a-z)\n\nDigit (0-9)\n\nSpecial character (~`!@#$%^&*()+=_-{}[]\\|:;”’?/<>,.)\n\nBe private\n\nWhere can I find more information?\n\nOn the webpage http://eduroam.uni.wroc.pl are more detail instructions for other systems.\n\nWindows 10\n\nWindows 8 i 8.1\n\nWindows 7\n\nWindows Vista\n\niOS\n\nAndroid 4.4.2\n\nMacOS\n\nLinux\n\nWindows Phone\n\nYou can also write and email to pomoc@uwr.edu.pl\n\nNothing works.
