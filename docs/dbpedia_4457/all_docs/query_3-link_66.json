        "text": "◉ Service background\n\nThe decision on the global conformity assessment method (hereinafter referred to as the global method) approved by the Council of the European Union in 1989 is a supplement to the 1985 resolution on the new method. The purpose is to show that more methods can be used to prove that the product meets the basic requirements of the directive, that is, if the manufacturer chooses other production criteria, it can prove that the product meets the basic requirements of the directive through conformity assessment However, it must be tested or certified by a third party.\n\nIn order to realize the compatibility of rolling stock, infrastructure and energy, and realize the product and system interaction between different markets, the European Union has implemented the directive 2008 / 57 / EC \"railway interoperability\" for the domestic railway system, and formulated the technical specification for interoperability (TSI). The technical specification for interoperability defines the technical and operational standards that need to be met by each subsystem or part of the subsystem, so as to meet the basic requirements of the European Union railway system and ensure interoperability. The technical specification for interoperability specifies 11 subsystems, including five structural subsystems: locomotive and rolling stock (LOC & PAS), freight wagon (WAG), noise (NOI), infrastructure (INF) and energy (ene); three general subsystems: disabled persons (PRM), tunnel safety (SRT) and signal control system (CCS); and three functional subsystems: operation (OPE) and passenger transport Remote communication (TAP) and freight remote communication (TAF).\n\nThe export of rail transit equipment related parts and components products within the EU also needs to comply with the requirements of relevant EU directives other than the 2008 / 57 / EC \"railway interoperability\" directive. These include the EMC Directive 2004 / 108 / EC, the Low Voltage Directive 2006 / 95 / EC, the Machinery Directive 2006 / 42 / EC, the regulation on the registration, assessment, licensing and restriction of chemicals (reach) of EC 1907 / 2006, and the restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment (RoHS) in 2011 / 65 / EU.\n\nThe completion of TSI certification, CE certification and conformity assessment of rolling stock does not mean that the vehicle can be operated in the EU. Meanwhile, Debo certification and CSM safety assessment of the target country are also required. After registration, they can be formally put into operation after registration in the National Security Agency (NSA) or European Union Railway Management Agency (ERA) of the target country.\n\n◉ The service content\n\n◉ Our strengths\n\n1. CTI rail transit product line has a project management and professional technical team with rich experience in EU certification and consulting projects of rail transit products, which can help customers avoid various common problems and risks at all stages of the project, and provide professional solutions to ensure that the products exported to EU are delivered on time and with quality.\n\n2.We provide customers with a complete set of integrated services including certification, testing and compliance assessment, and develop customized solutions for different customers and different products.\n\n3. CTI has a strong central chemical laboratory and technical team for locomotive and vehicle environmental protection, and has rich experience in the field of compliance assessment and testing of reach and RoHS regulations for rail transit equipment products, so as to help customers avoid potential environmental risks of products and avoid legal risks caused by environmental problems."
