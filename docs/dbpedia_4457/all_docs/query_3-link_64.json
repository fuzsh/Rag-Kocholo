        "text": "Summary\n\nIn order to improve the safety of railway operations, many countries in Europe have adopted Automatic Train Protection (ATP) systems. Following the principle of “Ten engineers, ten solutions,” ATP systems in Europe all have their own specificities. This has made cross-border railway operations even more challenging, as trains must be equipped with all the ATP systems required by the different countries they pass through.\n\nTo address this situation and contribute to interoperability, a European Automatic Train Protection system was designed: ERTMS/ETCS.\n\nConsisting of trackside equipment and onboard trains, ERTMS/ETCS has the main functions of providing signaling information in the cabin and supervising driving.\n\nDifferent levels of application are proposed: 0, 1, 2, and NTC. They allow for a progressive migration between train equipment and track equipment. The different operating modes of the onboard equipment indicate the responsibilities between the ERTMS/ETCS system and the driver.\n\nTwenty years after being specified by operators and manufacturers, the ERTMS/ETCS system is still deployed to a limited extent, both on the ground and onboard trains. One reason is the lack of strong political will for a significant deployment of ERTMS/ETCS. Another reason lies in the difficulties of integrating ERTMS/ETCS into the existing railway system.\n\nSolutions to these integration challenges are starting to emerge. The goal is to scale up and move towards a massive deployment of the ERTMS/ETCS system in the Union. To achieve this, it will be necessary to move towards a logic of harmonized, mass-deployable products. This is the mandate of the Europe’s Rail initiative, which continues the work of harmonization, both operationally and technically, to address all the still-specific parts of ERTMS/ETCS.\n\nOn the technological front, ERTMS/ETCS continues to evolve. Specifications for level 2 without trackside train detection, hybrid level 3, and absolute positioning are underway in R2DATO.\n\nThe introduction of compatibility with Automatic Train Operation (ATO) and with the FRMCS ground-to-train communication were the major innovations of ERTMS/ETCS in 2023.\n\n1.2.2 The introduction of automated systems\n\nOperators have implemented first protection systems, such as the “crocodile” in France, invented in 1872.\n\nThe crocodile is a device installed at the foot of each signal. It alerts the driver with an audible alarm in the cabin when passing a signal displaying a restrictive aspect. The driver then has a few seconds to acknowledge the information by pressing a button. In the absence of acknowledgment within the specified time, the train automatically stops.\n\nThe German PZB system, whose first version was developed in the 1930s, equipped 32,398 km of the federal network in 2019.\n\nThis device has three functions: applying braking when crossing closed signals, monitoring non-exceedance of a maximum speed on a section of track, and monitoring the driver’s acknowledgment of crossing warning signals. The PZB is part of train protection systems: the ATPs.\n\nIn France, the crocodile is not sufficient to prevent railway accidents. During the 1980s, SNCF decided to equip its trains with an ATP: the KVB. The Contrôle de Vitesse par Balises (KVB) is a mandatory equipment on a train, allowing it to operate on the French network.\n\n1.3 ATP Principles\n\n1.3.1 Generic principles\n\nIn general, an ATP functions to ensure the movement protection of a train, thereby helping to mitigate the inherent hazards of the railway system. To achieve this, an ATP continuously retrieves signaling information based on trackside systems:\n\nInterlocking, which transmits to the ATP the states of all signals under its responsibility.\n\nThe signals themselves, when a connection to the interlocking is not possible or not relevant.\n\nTrackside signaling systems are entirely agnostic to the trains operating on the infrastructure. Therefore, to properly supervise train movement, the ATP relies on onboard information:\n\nTrain properties, inputted into the ATP by the driver,\n\nTrain speed and position in a positioning reference system (often a reference system specific to the ATP).\n\nThe ATP combines all this information to verify if the train movement is authorized:\n\nThe train is traveling at a speed that does not exceed a speed limit.\n\nThe train is within an envelope allowed by the ground-based signaling, thus by the ATP.\n\nIf this is not the case, then the ATP automatically applies braking, thanks to a direct connection with the train.\n\nFor high-speed operations where observing signals along the track is no longer feasible, the cab signaling function has been developed for certain ATPs such as Transmission Voie-Machine (TVM) in France or Linienzugbeeinflussung (LZB) in Germany. Consequently, it is possible to entirely rely on cab signaling and remove lineside signaling.\n\n1.6 Towards the genesis of a harmonized technical system in Europe: ERTMS\n\nIt was with the EC Directive 1996 on the interoperability of the high-speed railway network that the concept of an interoperable signaling control system, as well as the characteristics of ERTMS, were introduced.\n\nSignaling industry manufacturers, grouped under a structure called UNISIG, produced the first technical specifications of ERTMS in 2000.\n\nIn 2002, the European Commission introduced ERTMS specifications into the Technical Specification for Interoperability – Control-Command and Signaling for the trans-European high-speed railway network (Commission Decision 2002/731/EC). Since then, the installation of ERTMS has become mandatory on new high-speed lines falling under the trans-European network.\n\nIn 2006, the first Technical Specifications for Interoperability concerning the trans-European conventional railway network were published by the Commission (Commission Decision 2006/679/EC).\n\nFinally, in 2012, the Technical Specifications for Interoperability of Control-Command Signaling were merged to cover both the high-speed and conventional networks (Commission Decision 2012/88/EU).\n\nTo date, national ATPs are obsolete. They are referred to as legacy systems or class B systems in the European Union nomenclature. Class B systems must be replaced by the ERTMS/ETCS ATP.\n\n2.1 Introduction\n\nThe starting point is the Movement Authority (MA). It is the permission for a train to operate its journey at a given maximum speed up to a certain point (this point being the end of the movement authority).\n\nIn the early days of railways, the movement authority was a hand signal given by a trackside agent, and then by mechanical and light signals installed along the tracks. With the construction of high-speed lines, where it is no longer possible to observe lateral signals, cabin signaling was invented. National ATP systems dedicated to high speed, such as TVM (France) or LZB (Germany), directly display the movement authority to the driver in the cabin.\n\nERTMS/ETCS follows exactly the same principles as a standard ATP, as we have seen before. It aims to transmit the movement authority from the trackside to the train, so that:\n\nthe information is displayed to the driver on the cabin screen: this is cabin signaling,\n\nthe onboard system supervises the train’s movement according to this movement authority and the train’s properties.\n\nTo perform its functions, ERTMS/ETCS consists of several subsystems, some on the trackside and others on board the train. The key element of ERTMS/ETCS lies in the standardization of the air gap, the interface between trackside and onboard systems.\n\n2.3.1 Principles\n\nThe different ERTMS/ETCS application levels (short: levels) are a way to express the possible operating relationships between track and train. Level definitions are related to the trackside equipment used, to the way trackside information reaches the onboard units and to which functions are processed in the trackside and in the onboard equipment respectively.\n\nDifferent levels have been defined to allow each individual railway administration to select the appropriate ERTMS/ETCS application trackside, according to their strategies, to their trackside infrastructure and to the required performance. Furthermore, the different application levels permit the interfacing of individual signalling systems and train control systems to ERTMS/ETCS.\n\nERTMS/ETCS can be configured to operate in one of the following application levels:\n\nERTMS/ETCS Level 0 : train equipped with ERTMS/ETCS operating on a line not equipped with any train control system (ERTMS/ETCS or national system) or on a line equipped with ERTMS/ETCS and/or national system(s) but operation under their supervision is currently not possible.\n\nERTMS/ETCS Level NTC : train equipped with ERTMS/ETCS operating on a line equipped with a national system.\n\nERTMS/ETCS Application Level 1 with or without infill transmission : train equipped with ERTMS/ETCS operating on a line equipped with Eurobalises and optionally Euroloop or Radio infill.\n\nERTMS/ETCS Application Level 2 : train equipped with ERTMS/ETCS operating on a line controlled by a Radio Block Centre and equipped with Eurobalises and Euroradio with train position and train integrity proving performed by the trackside.\n\nERTMS/ETCS Application Level 3 : similar to level 2 but with train position and train integrity supervision based on information received from the train.\n\n2.3.2 Level NTC : backward compatibility with Class B systems\n\nPrinciples\n\nThe replacement of Class B systems by ERTMS/ETCS must be synchronized between the tracks and the trains. This represents an immense migration challenge. To facilitate this, the onboard ERTMS/ETCS system has been designed to coexist with Class B systems. This coexistence is enabled by the NTC (National Train Control) level.\n\nAt the NTC level, the train is equipped with the ERTMS/ETCS system while the track still has a Class B system. The onboard part of the Class B system can be connected to the ERTMS/ETCS Onboard. This allows for automatic transitions and the sharing of resources such as the cabin display or odometer.\n\nThis connection is made via a module called the STM (Specific Transmission Module). The interface between the STM and the ERTMS/ETCS is standardized. The Class B system, through the STM, is responsible for supervising the train at the NTC level.\n\nTo operate in France, a new train must be equipped with ERTMS/ETCS as well as a French STM (supporting KVB and/or TVM). Indeed, in 2023, the installation of KVB in a train remains mandatory to operate on the conventional National Railway Network. For high-speed lines, TVM is required.\n\nThus, Class B systems within the EU have their STM to be connected to ERTMS/ETCS.\n\nThe migration challenge and the opportunity of software STM\n\nSTM (Specific Transmission Modules) were seen as a migration tool at their inception. Indeed, by enabling a train equipped with ERTMS/ETCS and a set of STMs supporting Class B systems, it was thought that this would trigger a dynamic where:\n\nOperators start equipping their trains with ERTMS/ETCS, along with STMs and Class B systems to remain compatible with existing infrastructure while waiting for lines to migrate to ERTMS/ETCS.\n\nOnce a significant number of trains equipped with ERTMS/ETCS are in operation, the infrastructure manager initiates the migration of its lines to ERTMS/ETCS.\n\nOnce lines are equipped with ERTMS/ETCS, operators remove STMs and Class B systems from their trains.\n\nOnce trains are fully equipped with ERTMS/ETCS, infrastructure managers complete the migration of their lines to ERTMS/ETCS by removing Class B systems.\n\nThis dynamic is unfolding, but at a very slow pace, as migration is a colossal challenge. It involves dual equipment both on the trackside and on board, spanning decades.\n\nGiven that the European rail area is still highly fragmented by Class B systems on the trackside, adaptation occurs onboard, integrating a plethora of Class B systems and associated STMs to cross borders. These are multi-system trains, and they are very costly, considering the complexity of integrating STMs, Class B systems, and associated antennas.\n\nA key innovation is to no longer have a hardware STM module but a software one. The STMs become software hosted directly in the EVC (European Vital Computer), along with the associated Class B system. The onboard computer then becomes Multistandard, a fundamental tool for migration.\n\n2.3.3 Level 1 : the upgrade based on existing systems\n\nERTMS/ETCS Level 1 is a spot transmission-based train control system to be used as overlay on an underlying signalling system. Movement Authorities are generated trackside and transmitted to the onboard via Eurobalises, fed by Lineside Electronic Units (LEU).\n\nLevel 1 provides a continuous speed supervision system, which also protects against overrun of the authority.\n\nTrain detection and train integrity supervision are performed by the trackside equipment of the underlying signalling system (interlocking, track circuits, axle counters, etc) and are outside the scope of ERTMS/ETCS.\n\nA fundamental step of an ERTMS/ETCS Level 1 project, is the application engineering. Indeed, this step consists in studying the line on which Level 1 will be deployed, and to create all necessary ERTMS/ETCS compliant data.\n\nThese data are put into the coders (LEU) installed on the line. The coders can be connected to the interlockings or the lineside signals. The LEUs are programmed with the application engineering data, with all ERTMS/ETCS data associated to the interlocking or the signal they are connected to. The LEU transmits to the Eurobalise the proper ERTMS/ETCS data, related to the state of the interlocking or the signal, as defined during the application engineering process.\n\nRepresentation of Level 1 : red signal approach, only equipped with Eurobalises. Credit : ertms.net\n\nThe signal is closed (red), the state is retrieved by the LEU, that associates this state with ERTMS/ETCS compliant data defined during the application engineering phase. If the signal remains red, the driver must not pass the Eurobalise. By doing so, the onboard would automatically apply the emergency brake. The driver must wait until the signal is open to cross the Eurobalise. The signal LEU would have modified the ERTMS/ETCS data in the balise, and the onboard would receive its new Movement Authority.\n\nLevel 1 being a spot transmission system, existing lineside signalling must be kept. It is not a 100% CAB-signalling system. Semi-continuous infill devices can enable CAB-signalling and then the lineside signals can be suppressed. These devices are:\n\nEuroloops, inductive loops placed before the Eurobalise,\n\nRadio Infill Units (RIU), a local radio transmission device, placed at the foot of the signal.\n\n2.3.5 : Level 2 without Track Train Detection\n\nFormerly known as Level 3 (SUBSET-026 version 3.6.0), this particular implementation of Level 2 assumes that the movement authority is generated by the Radio Block Centre (RBC), based on the train’s location and integrity. The movement authority is transmitted to the train via a radio link: Euroradio.\n\nIn this level, the train reports its location on the track and its integrity control to the RBC. A device checks that no part of the train has become detached, which is the role of the TIMS (Train Integrity Monitoring System).\n\nThus, there is no longer a need for track circuits or axle counters to verify the occupancy status of sections. Consequently, there is no longer a physical constraint on the track, which requires division into sections. This allows for a transition from a train spacing management based on fixed sections to one based on the moving block.\n\nThe figure above (credit Digitale Schiene Deutschland) illustrates the point.\n\nIn the first part, we have a line equipped with information points, delineating the sections, where we find axle counters, a group of balises, and an optional signal. As long as train 1 does not completely vacate the section, train 2 is stopped because it cannot enter the occupied section.\n\nIn the second part, there is no longer a train detection system on the track, and therefore no physical delineation of sections. The spacing between trains is directly managed by the RBC, which takes into account the position, speed, and characteristics of each train. The result is an increased line capacity, with the spacing between trains reduced to the minimum required.\n\nInterlocking functions can be directly integrated into the RBC, known as the Advanced Protection System (APS). Lineside signaling is no longer necessary. Some Eurobalises remain necessary to ensure train localization.\n\nHybrid Level 3\n\nHybrid Level 3 is a specific concept for the implementation of Level 2 without Track Train Detection, defined by the ERTMS Users Group. The main characteristic of the concept is that it uses fixed virtual blocks for the separation of trains which are fitted with a train integrity monitoring system (TIMS), while a limited installation of trackside train detection is used for the separation of trains without TIMS, as well as for the handling of degraded situations.\n\nERTMS/ETCS Level 2 without Track Train Detection relies on preconditions, that are difficult to match in 2023:\n\nIn Level 2 without Track Train Detection, the separation of trains is managed by ERTMS/ETCS, thanks to the position and integrity reports of the trains. Each train must be equipped with a TIMS, and the use of TIMS on variable composition trains (especially freight) is complex,\n\nThe total absence of train detection devices trackside supposes that ERTMS/ETCS Level 2 without Track Train Detection knows at any moment the position and integrity of all trains within the area under its responsibility. In practice, this is not always possible:\n\nIf the train is moved via operational procedures, not under the supervision of ERTMS/ETCS,\n\nIf the radio communication fails.\n\nHybrid Level 3 is an interesting answer to the challenges of Level 2 without Track Train Detection. Indeed, keeping a trackside train detection system enables:\n\nThe compatibility with freight trains, for which the use of TIMS is complex today. It will be facilitated in the future with the Digital Automatic Coupling (DAC),\n\nThe management of trains disconnected from the trackside hybrid level 3, as they will still be detected by the train detection system. This is particularly interesting for movements via operational procedures, or in case of rebooting of the trackside in case of a crash.\n\nIn its concept, Hybrid Level 3 does not use virtual moving block, but virtual fixed block. This is not a fundamental need of the concept. It is just for pragmatic reasons. In comparison to moving blocks, fixed virtual blocks have in several implementations less impact on the existing trackside systems such as the RBC, interlocking and traffic control centre as well as on the operational procedures. By reducing the length of the virtual blocks, the performance can be similar to moving blocks, which means that the performance benefit is not compromised.\n\n4.2 The difficult integration\n\n4.2.1 The problem\n\nERTMS/ETCS is a system, with many interfaces standardized through SUBSETs. At first glance, one might think that deploying ERTMS/ETCS equipment, on the trackside or on trains, is easy. The reality is quite different.\n\nERTMS/ETCS is integrated into an existing railway system that is very heterogeneous. This means that the existing equipment to which ERTMS/ETCS components connect has never been designed for this purpose! Existing equipment is highly diverse, with specific principles. As a result, for each ERTMS/ETCS deployment project, engineering studies and specific developments must be carried out to account for the particularities of existing equipment. Let’s delve into this in more detail.\n\n4.2.2 Onboard integration\n\nExisting trains have never been predisposed to accommodate ERTMS/ETCS. It’s only been in recent years that every new train produced must inherently integrate ERTMS/ETCS (and STM and class B systems if applicable).\n\nThis means concretely that installing ERTMS/ETCS on an existing train requires:\n\nMechanical engineering studies to determine where and how to install the equipment on the train.\n\nSystem studies to determine how to connect the ERTMS/ETCS computer to the train’s computer and electro-mechanical interfaces.\n\nFor each series of locomotives or trains, these studies need to be repeated!\n\nInstalling ERTMS/ETCS on board a train is a separate project. And projects, in turn, require a lot of resources, both human and financial. This is currently a barrier to widespread deployment.\n\nOne way to reduce installation complexity, especially on the train interface, is the concept of the Functional Vehicle Adapter (FVA) developed by OCORA. This train adapter would allow the use of SUBSETs of the train interface (SUBSET 034, 119, 147) between the ERTMS/ETCS computer and the adapter. The FVA would then handle the mapping to the specific interface of the train. Thus, it’s the FVA that would carry the train’s specificities, not the EVC.\n\nAnother approach is to harmonize the principles of computer interfaces. This is the ambition of SUBSET-147, also called One Common Bus, which aims to converge towards a single computer communication bus between onboard equipment.\n\n4.2.3 Trackside integration\n\nDeploying ERTMS/ETCS on the trackside poses exactly the same problems as on board trains.\n\nERTMS/ETCS on the trackside simply adapts existing signaling information into the ETCS format. And this information comes from existing systems: interlockings. Each country in Europe has had its own approach to interlocking systems, and the fleet is far from uniform: relay interlockings, electronic interlockings, digital interlockings…\n\nThus, for each deployment of an RBC, an interface with the existing interlocking must be developed. Like with onboard deployment, this involves conducting projects that require significant resources.\n\nTo address this issue, a comprehensive modernization approach must be considered, including:\n\nDefining a standardized interface between interlocking and RBC.\n\nReplacing existing interlockings with digital interlockings, equipped with the standardized interface for RBC.\n\nInstalling RBCs adjacent to the new interlockings, using the standardized interface, during the deployment of ERTMS/ETCS on the modernized line.\n\nThe definition of a standardized interface at the European level between RBC and interlocking is currently underway within Europe’s Rail System Pillar.\n\nAnother solution is to move directly to level 2 without trackside train detection. The line would be deeply modernized and simplified, and the installed RBC could directly integrate interlocking functions (Advanced Protection System principle).\n\n4.3 The goal : defining migration paths\n\nThe objective towards which the entire Union aims is straightforward: the target system by 2050.\n\nFor ERTMS/ETCS, the goal is to have migrated to level 2 wherever interoperability is required. There will be no more class B systems, no more STM, or equipment necessary for level 1 (LTM, RIU), on the interoperable network.\n\nOnce the objective is clear, it is necessary to outline the trajectory to achieve it. Trajectories are specific to each country, as the starting situations are all unique.\n\nThe Migration group within Europe’s Rail System Pillar is currently specifying the broad outlines of these trajectories, in collaboration with operators and industry stakeholders. Once these broad outlines are defined, each country will then need to get to work and initiate the migration process.\n\nSynthesis\n\nIn order to improve the safety of railway operations, many countries in Europe have adopted Automatic Train Protection (ATP) systems. Following the principle of “Ten engineers, ten solutions,” ATP systems in Europe all have their own specificities. This has made cross-border railway operations even more challenging, as trains must be equipped with all the ATP systems required by the different countries they pass through.\n\nTo address this situation and contribute to interoperability, a European Automatic Train Protection system was designed: ERTMS/ETCS.\n\nConsisting of trackside equipment and onboard trains, ERTMS/ETCS has the main functions of providing signaling information in the cabin and supervising driving.\n\nDifferent levels of application are proposed: 0, 1, 2, and NTC. They allow for a progressive migration between train equipment and track equipment. The different operating modes of the onboard equipment indicate the responsibilities between the ERTMS/ETCS system and the driver.\n\nTwenty years after being specified by operators and manufacturers, the ERTMS/ETCS system is still deployed to a limited extent, both on the ground and onboard trains. One reason is the lack of strong political will for a significant deployment of ERTMS/ETCS. Another reason lies in the difficulties of integrating ERTMS/ETCS into the existing railway system.\n\nSolutions to these integration challenges are starting to emerge. The goal is to scale up and move towards a massive deployment of the ERTMS/ETCS system in the Union. To achieve this, it will be necessary to move towards a logic of harmonized, mass-deployable products. This is the mandate of the Europe’s Rail initiative, which continues the work of harmonization, both operationally and technically, to address all the still-specific parts of ERTMS/ETCS.\n\nOn the technological front, ERTMS/ETCS continues to evolve. Specifications for level 2 without trackside train detection, hybrid level 3, and absolute positioning are underway in R2DATO.\n\nThe introduction of compatibility with Automatic Train Operation (ATO) and with the FRMCS ground-to-train communication were the major innovations of ERTMS/ETCS in 2023."
