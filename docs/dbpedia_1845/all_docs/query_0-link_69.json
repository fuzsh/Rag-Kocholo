        "text": "Stanley was the RAF Chaplain, for Church of St Nicholas on the Island in 1959/60.\n\nHe was greatly admired, respected and loved by his parishioners. While on the island he suffered severe skin rashes which required weeks in a hospital in Hawaii to treat.\n\nStanley died on Trinity Sunday 1980 - his fortieth anniversary of ordination, It was only after his death that the consultant was able to tell us that the primary had been in his adrenal gland: an extremely rare starting point for cancer.\n\n- Excerpt taken from a tribute to SBG [click here to read his full story]\n\nStanley was a part of the AWRE team at Operation Hurricane 1952, Operation Totem 1953 and Operation Grapple 1957.\n\nHe was also present for the start of minor trails at Maralinga 1955.\n\nHe had joined the Army on April 1, 1943, which he described as ‘a silly day to join up.’ He became a forward observation signaller with the Royal Artillery, and was up front with the infantry in various campaigns and countries, including being in Normandy shortly after D-Day.\n\nFrom there, he went onto Belgium and then on to Germany. He was also involved in the Battle of Arnhem in 2016 the French government awarded him the Legion d’Honneur medal for his service in Normandy\n\nStanley died at Basingstoke hospital on 6th February 2019 aged 94 after having Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease.\n\nStanleys Obituary can be read [Here]\n\n*The BNTVA have uploaded Stanleys photos to the website and they can be found in the Collections & Archives section.*\n\nGeoff Butler was a sapper with 71 Fld Sqn re and took part in Operation Hurricane in 1952. He sailed in HMS Zeebrugge, and lived on the island for 5 months with the RAAF. He watched the test from HMS Narvik and landed on the explosion site closest to Plym with two others only 2 hours after the test to recover rocket head/scoops that had been fired into the cloud. After arrivng back in England in 1953 he was posted to Kenya, East Africa. He left the service and emigrated to Western Australia in 1956. Geoff was always certain that the radiation from the bomb test was responsible for the illness's in his children. The first child dying shortly after birth. His wife Ida died a couple of years before he did. He leaves two daughters, both live in Western Australia. Geoff was born on 7th July 1929. He passed away on 5th October 1998. May he Rest In Peace.\n\nSeamen Ronald Dunwell had dementia so, spent a lot of his time reliving his time in the Royal Marines, during Operation Hurricane his job was to take a boat and transport the scientists from their bunker to a ship.. He said \"he thought it funny that the scientists were in white suits, hoods and gloves and him and his mate Butch were wearing short sleeved shirts and shorts\". They were told to cover their eyes with their hands when he explosion went off but most of them wanted to watch it after the initial blast. He said \"it was weird that the mushroom cloud started drifting and forming an irregular shape\".\n\nThis is Peter Newby's story\n\n\"We are now at Kure, South Japan, about two days trip south ofTokyo. It is a big ex-Jap naval base and used to be one of their largest. We are in company with another destroyer, HMS Ullyses and an Aussie cruiser, HMAS Hobart. We arrived yesterday and stay for a few days returning to Yokohama on 7th January.\n\n\"This place is very near Hiroshima and today the American authorities ran a special train to take a hundred of us on the 10 mile journey to Hiroshima to see the atomic bomb damage. I went along too and spent this afternoon looking over the place. The train was a good one with first class carriages. On the way I saw rice fields and neatly laid out villages. We arrived at Hiroshima about\n\n1pm. Part of the station still remains so we could ride right there.\n\n\"Stepping from the train is like entering a strange new world where life does not exist - it’s rather creepy. For about 10 square miles one could see nothing but eerie looking blackened tree stumps and rubble - a strange sort of desert. Everything looks as if it has been subjected to terrific heat and everything you touch crumbles to dust. My pal and I pushed a ten feet high concrete gate\n\npost and it just fell over and disappeared in a cloud of brittle pieces and dust. There is nothing solid.\n\n\"Huge stretches of ground have been turned into a green crystalline substance which crunches as you walk on it. You can make out the remains of a bus or tramcar here and there but when you touch the twisted metal which remains, it just collapses. I picked up a half inch steel bar and snapped it like a piece offirewood. All metal looks a blueish-green colour, caused by the tremendous\n\nheat no doubt. \"The whole place has a cold emptiness and not a single bird or animal can be seen. I was informed that sixty thousand people were just obliterated in the fraction of a second. I expect they were burnt to dust as no bodies were found.\"\n\nIt is with a sad heart I must give you the news the legend, my hero who was my dad has passed away quietly in his sleep on 2-9-2022 - JAMES JOHN PRICE (JIM)\n\nJim served on HMS Tyrian, and HMS Scarborough and was at Christmas Island. Dad was one of the good ones and will be missed by all that had the honour of knowing him. God bless you dad. My mum didn't want to be without dad and sadly passed away the next day. RIP together always, x\n\n- remembered by their daughter Danielle\n\nWalter ‘Slinger’ Wood, came from Clitheroe in Lancashire and was a stoker on board HMS Messina for the Christmas Island bomb tests.\n\nHe was a big strong man, and was part of the Devonport Field Gun Crew carrying the wheel.\n\nHe served 7 years in the RN. He lived in Manchester and Todmorden and in 2006 emigrated to New Zealand. He had a ruptured ulcer in the 1970’s but thankfully lived, he also had skin cancer and later on a battle with Multiple Myeloma.\n\nSadly he lost in May 2010 at the age of 69. He is sadly missed by his widow Shelagh, daughters Angela, Lisa and Adele as well as sons in laws and grand children.\n\n- Walter is on the left in the photo."
