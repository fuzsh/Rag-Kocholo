        "text": "Peter Doyle specialises in the understanding of military terrain, with special reference to the two world wars. As well as an historian, he is an earth scientist with a special interest in the concept of trench warfare in the First World War, and in the lives of those soldiers who experienced the conflict first hand. He has written extensively on these topics, with a focus both on the nature of trench warfare, and on the ordinary soldiers who took part in it.\n\nPeter is also an author who focusses on the British experience of war, and the material culture of war. In addition to his work on trench warfare, he has research interests that span life on the Home Front and the experience of prisoners of war during the Second World War, the Gallipoli Campaign of 1915, and the provision of 'Comforts to the troops' during the Great War. His more recent work has examined the specifics of the unique gift that was distributed to over 2.5 million soldiers and sailors at Christmas 1914.\n\nPeter is active in the promotion of the wider understanding of the First World War. His book for young people, 'Percy, A Story of 1914' was shortlisted for a Society for Army Historical Research prize in 2019.\n\nHis research has been featured in numerous documentaries that have focussed on the First World War, Prisoners of War and PoW escapes in the Second World War, and a number of related topics."
