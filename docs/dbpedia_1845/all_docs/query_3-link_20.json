        "text": "(Work in Progress will add if people are intrested)\n\n\"The Horror and Revulsion which Men felt at the Atrocious Crimes which Accompanied the War tend to Fade and Disappear....\"\n\nThe Right Honourable Sir Harry Shawcross KC MP\n\nAttorney General\n\nWar Crime Trials - 1949\n\nList of Australian and New Zealand POWs Confirmed as being sent to German KZ Camps (Not Just RAAF-RNZAF) And List of German Confirmed War Crime's Against RAF Bomber Command Aircrew before receiving their POW Numbers 1941-1945 Including where known Final Trial Dispositions.\n\nExplanation on POW Numbers\n\nALL POW Numbers are given After Acceptance by a POW Camp - upto that Point 'Officially All POWs Captured are Not Confirmed as such by the 'Red Cross' until After they have Received their Number.\n\nThis Means that Any POWs that are not Confirmed within a reasonable time are usually listed as 'Missing', then after that as Missing Presumed Killed until after the End of the War at which point the Missing were Investigated and in Many Cases found to be Killed Outright\n\n- There were however Anomalies.\n\nThere were Cases of Outright Murder where POWs were Handed over to the Gestapo or SS or other Local Party Officials\n\n- often with No Known Resting Place as the End Result -\n\nbut it has to be said this was Not a Air Force Problem alone as the Campaigns in Greece,Crete and North Africa are prime Examples of\n\n- Not to Mention POWs that made Escape Attempts and then Vanished forever\n\n(The POWs of the Great Escape were the most Notoriously well known case - however there were others where Remains were Never Recovered at All unlike the Sagan Escape - especially if they were Polish or Czech in Nature or from Any of the other 'Occupied Territory's').\n\nTwo prime example's of this are the Fates of the unrecorded Aircrew of S/L DRC 'Drew' Wyness DFC RAF\n\n(617 RAF Sqd) who all survived being shot down during a Daylight Operation on 7 October 1944 only to be Murdered by 'Party Officials' of which 4 were later Confirmed as being Shot in the back of the Head and Dumped into the Rhine and 3 others Vanished and have No Known Resting Place.\n\nAnother Case was the Aircrew of a Stirling of which 4 Aircrew were Killed and 3 Captured the Night of 22/23 June 1943 with 90 RAF Sqd, all 3 were Killed after being Shot shortly after Capture (Sgt N Graham RAF, Sgt N Hammond RAF and Sgt D Sanders RAF).\n\nPerhaps One of the Most Revolting is what Happened to F/Sgt Doyle RAF who was Shot Down over Hamburg, 27/28 July 1943 and after being Captured was Handed over to Guards at a Russian POW Camp.\n\nThe POWs who witnessed the event were later to report having seen -\n\n\"..The Guard smash a Chair into Pieces in his Fury and then use a piece of that Chair - the Leg of it - to then Beat the Airman about the Head repeatedly over and over until He was No Longer Moving.\n\nAfter that a Bucket of Water was thrown over him Simply to Revive the Unconscious Airman and to help in Washing Away the Blood on the Huts Floor - at that point when the Airman moved a Guard moved forward and without Pause shot the Airman in the Head and Body more then once.\n\n4 Russian POWs were then Detailed to Bury the Airman's remains behind their Camp almost immediately after the Murder taking place, on 7 August 1943 the Body was Recovered by the Germans and re buried at Harburg as an 'Unknown Airman'.\n\nPart 1\n\nListing of Aircrew of RAF Bomber Command that were Killed before being issued with a POW Number but while under German Control in the Occupied Territory's or Germany 1941-1945\n\n(Order of the Year the Aircrew are Shot Down).\n\nNB Names of the Actual Murderers are not mentioned deliberately - this is about the Aircrew and those that helped them Not the People that killed them.\n\nDetails on these Men can be foundin other Articles/Books and websites for those intreted.\n\n1941 -\n\nBefore VE-Day was secured over 4000 RAAF Members would loose their lives serving in All the Units Associated with RAF Bomber Command and such was the scale of their sacrifice that more then one Family in what was still a relatively sparsely inhabited land would experience the pain of loosing more then one son or daughter.\n\nIt is also revealed that by Australian and Commonwealth Records held in the UK and Australia that many Australians joined the RAF and served their country in this manner.\n\nA large number were also killed while serving with the RAF and not as members of their own countries Air Force and would therefore be in excess of the already mentioned 4000 RAAF Aircrew.\n\nA large Majority arrived in the UK pre-war during the late 1930s during which time they were often recipients of Short Service Commissions in the RAF or simply on holiday or left Australia to 'learn to fly' after the RAAF said 'No Thanks'.\n\nEqually before the end of the war many New Zealand Families would also be dealt this double blow with in some cases a second and a third son or daughter being killed while on active service.\n\nThe year that was to come after 1941 would for the RNZAF be even worse with over 500 killed - the worst 24 Hour period in the wartime history of the RNZAF took place on 28/29 July 1942 during which 32 Aircrew died of which 21 belonged to 75 (NZ) Sqd alone.\n\n10/11 October 1941 - 0035 Hrs\n\nF/Sgt AR Robbins RAF and Aircrew - 58 RAF Sqd\n\nDitched his Whitley 300 Meters off the Coast of Holland and left to Drown, when attempt was made to Launch area's Lifeboat by the Dutch they were Halted at Gun Point by German Officials and Police and told to 'Go Away'.\n\nThey were then forced to Listen to the Cries for help out of the darkness slowly 'Fading Away into Silence'.\n\nTwo Aircrew were Washed Ashore after being Drowned, while 2 Survived by Swimming Ashore only for One of them to Die on the Beech, 1 Airman has No Known Resting Place.\n\nThe Survivor was then Ordered to March to the Local Polezei HQ 'Wet Exhausted and in Bare Feet' up a Steady Incline for just Over 1 Kilometre.\n\nHis Survival was Due to the Luftwaffe Pilot who Shot them Down Arriving to take the POW under 'his protection'\n\n- The Survivor later Recording how 'Angry and genuinely Upset the young Pilot in particular was' when they heard him tell them what had happened.\n\nThe Luftwaffe Pilot was Lt Hans Moller, he shot down his first Aircraft a Spitfire on 7 May 1941, then a pair of Blenhims on 28 August 1941 and his number 4 was the Whitley Aircrew described above.\n\nHe remained with JG53 and served in the middle east before he was shot down by AA at a height of 500 Feet,25 March 1943 while strafing north of Beja in North Africa after his ME 109 was hit and caught fire.\n\nThe Pilot safely abandoned his Aircraft after crash landing on the Road to Aboid and was captured shortly afterwards seeing the war out as a POW and surviving the war.\n\nBy this time he had claimed 15 Aircraft Destroyed and was still a Leutenant.\n\nThe Whitley's Aircrew who were Drowned in such a Callous manner were -\n\nF/Sgt AR Robbins RAFVR, Sgt AW Cooper RAFVR, P/O DS Mcdonald RCAF and Sgt TAW Hamilton RAFVR - the Survivor was Sgt WH Sproule RCAF who was a POW for the Wars Remaining Duration.\n\nNo One was brought to face a court in this case after the end of the war and despite investigations and statements by the Dutch and the RCAF Airman in 1946 No Charges were brought in relation to this matter after the end of the war.\n\n1943 -\n\nIn 1943 during the month of April out of 9 Lancasters that failed to return from operations with 460 RAAF Sqd All 64 Aircrew involved were Killed - of the 64 - 35 were RAAF Airman.\n\nAs an example of the multi Casualties that could effect a Family the Extended Ross-Barrey Family of Victoria, New South Wales and South Australia had 6 serve in either the RAAF/RAF or RAN.\n\nBy 1945 - 5 were Killed and only 1 Survived the War, with only 1 of the Dead having a known resting site.\n\nAnother case would be the West Australian Clarke Family who in 1943 lost 1 Son with the RAAF only to have another Son Killed in 1945 also with the RAAF - both members of the Command.\n\nIn New Zealand the Bentley Family lost 2 Sons one in May 1943 with the Command and another flying a Spitfire from Egypt to Libya in January 1943.\n\nBoth of the Bentley Families Sons also have no known Resting Place.\n\nOn the same bomber as the Bentley Family Lost their son, 2 Aircrew were also again killed from the same family in this case the Lamb Family, one dying in May 1943 and the other in May 1944 also flying in the command.\n\nDuring June 1942 a U-Boat sunk a ship that had on board RNZAF EATS Graduates on its way towards England - 29 June 1942.\n\nThe handful of Survivors were then almost wiped out flying with the RNZAF as part of the Command.\n\n1943 was also the year when operationally experienced New Zealanders were to be killed while undertaking their second tour or undertaking training roles inside the command in larger and larger numbers.\n\nFor Only 2 Separate sparsely populated Islands at this time in New Zealand's History - the burden of pain they would continue to bear continued in its growing weight as more and more people were effected by the European War.\n\n22/23 June 1943\n\nF/Sgt JA Robson RAFVR and Aircrew - 90 RAF Sqd\n\n4 Killed\n\n3 Airman Shot by 2 German Officials and a Civilian (See POW Numbers Explanation Above)\n\nNo Charges were brought in relation to this matter after the end of the war.\n\n24/25 July 1943\n\nW/C DT Saville DSO DFC RAFVR (Australian in RAF) - 218 (Gold Coast) RAF Sqd\n\n1 Killed and 1 POW\n\nReported hanged by Civilians - F/Sgt HW Beavis RNZAF, P/O TD Fairgrieve DFM RAF, P/O WJ Brighton RAFVR, F/L TA Stanley DFC RAFVR, F/L JL Birbeck DFC RAFVR, F/Sgt ABS Howat RAFVR.\n\nSurvivor was located by Luftwaffe and recovered safely wounded and injured (F/O HC Eyre RAFVR) before the mob could locate him.\n\nMinimum of at least 3 Hung - entire Aircrew were Killed apart from Pilot and all Abandoned Stirling Safely - so it is now believed all Aircrew were murdered in some manner.\n\nThe names of the 3 Aircrew sighted by F/O Eyre are not Recorded - so complete aircrew has been listed.\n\nF/O Eyre was last to abandon and all of the Aircrew went beside him to leave via stirlings nose hatch so he is 100% certain all but pilot were able to abandon aircraft safely.\n\nSurvivor reported seeing dead bodies 'hung from lampposts of 3 of his Aircrew', while his Luftwaffe escort were forced to draw bayonets on civilians and fix them to their rifles before forming a protective circle around him to prevent them doing the same to him on a number of occasions while making the journey to the Dulag Luft later and when getting treatment for his wounds shortly after being shot down.\n\nNo Charges were brought in relation to this matter after the end of the war.\n\n27/28 July 1943\n\nF/Sgt JB Charters RAFVR and Aircrew - 106 RAF Sqd\n\n6 Killed\n\nCaptured by Krimnal Polizi and handed over to Landwacht Batt 498, 3 Kompany in charge of a Soviet POW Camp at Veddel Near Hamburg in Northern Germany 1 Airman (Sgt JW Doyle RAFVR) beaten and shot to death after he survived the loss of his Lancaster,remaining Aircrews Fate Unknown.\n\nAircrew listed 'Failed to Return - Nothing Further Heard After Take Off.\n\nLost Without Trace in RAF Records\n\nAircrew Remains Unknown - Listed Runnymede Memorial for Aircrew With No Known Resting Place\n\n(See POW Numbers Explanation Above)\n\nWhermacht ordered immediate enquiry - Murderer was detained for 48-72 Hours depending on reports read and then charges were dropped and the Guilty Member was returned to duty at the same camp with no further action taking place.\n\nNo Charges Resulted in this Matter despite the Soviet POWs making detailed statements to the RAF after the end of the War.\n\n18/19 October 1943\n\nF/Sgt LJ Hinton RAAF and Aircrew - 103 RAF Sqd\n\nF/L D McNaught Moodie DFC RCAF and Aircrew - 97 (Straights Settlements) RAF Sqd\n\n(Mid Air Collision between both Lancasters cause of both Aircrews Loss)\n\n1 POW and 10 Killed\n\n1 Airman reported 'hearing shooting after landing' who belonged to the other Lancaster that crashed after being struck in the Collision.\n\nFrom the combined 14 Airman involved there was only 1 survivor from the 2 Lancasters who later became a POW for the duration of the war (Sgt HWN Clausen DFM RAF BA) and heard the earlier mentioned gunfire which he reported when being debriefed at the end of the war.\n\nWhat happened that night was revealed due to the insistence of the Next Of Kin of one of the dead who was determined to know what actually did happen and refused to give in and accept the 'offical version' when it was announced that he had no known resting place.\n\nThe truth about Sgt TF Stott RAFVR, Sgt CH Leech RAFVR and Sgt TH Davies RAF, who all in fact survived their Aircrafts Loss, and were members of the 103 RAF Sqd Lancaster that crashed were indeed in at least the case of two worthy of addition to this list.\n\nAll 3 were captured - Sgt Leech RAF and Sgt TH Davies RAF were Shot, then they were thrown into the Lancaster's burning wreckage to destroy the evidence of the crime.\n\nAt close to the same time Sgt Stott RAFVR met a woman that aided his escape\n\n- he then selflessly agreed to aid a Polish Group of Prisoners that were part of a Polish Working Party in their own attempt at escaping, they were all captured in the attempt and Sgt Stott was severely beaten by the guards before they took him to a local hospital\n\n- which he then promptly escaped from.\n\nOnce more he then vanished before 2 Nurses reported meeting the Missing Airman after he had crossed over into Soviet Territory\n\n- they reported him as being seriously ill and dying of TB -\n\nHis final resting site is still unknown.\n\nNo Charges were brought in relation to this matter after the end of the war.\n\nAll 3 Missing Airman are recorded on the Runnymede Memorial for Aircrew with No Known Resting Place.\n\n22/23 October 1943\n\nF/L JR Bryan RCAF and Aircrew - 434 (Bluenose) RCAF Sqd\n\n2 POWs and 3 Killed\n\n2 POWs reported that 4 Airman abandoned the Halifax safely in total, of which 1 was believed to have been killed when he landed in the fires caused by the bombing below them while another was reported to the POWs as being killed by the civilian population by his guards\n\n- this was confirmed by a POW who later sighted the missing airman's 'opened parachute along with his footware'.\n\nThis was furher confirmed once again while at the Luftwaffe's Dulag Luft Interrogation Centre and when the Pilot F/L Bryan RCAF demanded to be allowed to sight the Airman's body his German interpreter then refused and slapped him before knocking him to the ground\n\n- permission was refused despite repeated pleas made by the Pilot to see the body of the Airman that belonged to his aircrew.\n\nBoth missing airman are now at eternal peace in Hannover's War Cemetery.\n\nThe 2 Airman concerned were F/Sgt WH Burton RCAF (Possible Fire) and F/O WS Sewall RCAF (Murdered)\n\nNo Charges were brought in relation to this matter after the end of the war.\n\nDuring 1944 RAAF Casualties significantly continued to rise higher and higher and by years end they were at just under 1800 Killed.\n\nThe most senior ranking RAAF Airman who died serving with the command also was killed this year\n\n- G/C JR Balmer OBE DFC in May with 467 RAAF Sqd.\n\n1944 also witnessed the death of one of the RNZAF's ''Best and brightest' W/C JF Barron DSO Bar DFC DFM RNZAF aged 23.\n\nHe was killed after flying 1264 Operational Flying Hours and completed 79 Operations, failing to return on his 80th.\n\nThe aircrafts loss over a 'soft' French target is now believed to have come about due to a mid air collision that took place while operating as a master bomber,between his Lancaster and that of his Deputy Master Bomber while over the target (S/L JM Dennis DSO DFC RAFVR).\n\nAll 15 Aircrew were Killed.\n\n21/22 January 1944\n\nF/O WK Hutton RAAF and Aircrew - 83 RAF Sqd\n\n2 Killed and 4 POWs\n\nBoth AG's were killed by the Nightfighter but the pilots fate is not as clear.\n\nWhile this Aircrew's remaining members were able to survive as POWs for the wars duration the expierence of this Aircrew's Irish RAF WOP deserves to be recalled Along with the other Surviving POWs that made up this Aircrew.\n\nF/O JW 'Paddy' Houston DFM RAFVR along with F/Sgt AF McInnes RAAF and P/O GMD Breaden RAAF are who's recollections are combined below, the other POW was the F/E Sgt JO Lightfoot RAFVR.\n\nF/O JW Houston DFM RAFVR Stated -\n\n\"The Aircraft was attacked by a single FW 190 which in only one devastating pass killed both AGs (F/Sgt RE Walker RAAF M/U AG and Rear AG Sgt RH Easton RAF) with only a brief warning from the M/U AG to 'Dive Port Now' - all survivors agree that the report ended mid word.\n\nThe Attack also destroyed both Port Engines and on a second pass their was no return fire from the AG's, while the Nightfighter made another final 3rd pass the Aircrew commenced to abandon the aircraft with 4 Airman confirmed as jumping safely\n\n- as well as the Pilot who was belived to have been number 5 in jumping safely\"\n\nF/Sgt AF McInnes RAAF Stated -\n\n\"...wounded in shoulders by Cannon Shells which exploded behind me I was able to land without any further injury ......\n\nShortly afterwards I was located by some civilians who then proceeded to attack me and while doing so broke one of my ribs and fractured others due to kicking me while I was down and not stoping til I played at being dead...\"\n\nF/O JW Houston DFM RAFVR Stated -\n\n\" ....after I abandoned the Lancaster I started to drift over towards the target which was burning below me and I avoided this fate by pulling on my parachute lines until I drifted clear and landed safely in a nearby farmers Field\n\n- almost at once I was being surrounded by a large angry group of civilians that then tore at my clothing before I could get clear and then started to punch me til I collapsed before then kicking me repeatedly until I was semi conscious.\n\nI then regained my senses when I felt a rope being placed around my neck and tightened at which point a violent argument erupted between the German Males as to who would have the ''honour' of killing me\".\n\n\"At this point a German Woman and a Policeman appeared on the scene and demanded that I be handed over to them\n\n- at which point even more shouting and arguments erupted around me -\n\nthe Policeman drew his sidearm and started waving it around in a menacing manor,eventually getting the situation back under control.\n\nI was then dragged into a nearby barn where I found a 'worse for wear' F/Sgt McInnes RAAF already inside....\"\n\nP/O GMD Breaden RAAF Stated -\n\n\"......delayed opening my parachute for several thousands of feet so as to avoid drifting over towards the burning target below me which was clearly in sight.\n\nAs I had hoped this worked and I landed safely some distance from the aircrafts crash location, I then spent the night wrapped up inside my own parachute for comfort and warmth...\"\n\nHe was also captured on 22 January 1944 and he went on -\n\n\"....a hostile group soon surrounded me and started to make threatening moves against my well being before a policeman came along and took possession of me..\"\n\nHe also recorded a report that the Australian Pilot Ken Hutton was 'murderd after being captured by the same group of people' the night they were All shot down.\n\nAll 3 Airman now rest in the Berlin 1939-1945 War Cemetery after being relocated and re buried formally after the end of the war.\n\nNo Charges were brought in relation to this matter after the end of the war.\n\n24/25 March 1944 at 2200 Hrs\n\nBerlin Op - Unknown Airman\n\nThe Luckless Airman landed on the roof of the house at Schonleinstrasse 7 - he was saved from falling to his death onto the Courtyard 4 Stories below by his parachute snagging on the roof - a number of Berliners cut him down before allowing him to fall helplessly onto the ground where he was killed by the impact of the fall.\n\nIt is reported one of the Germans responsible said as he was dying on the ground\n\n- 'The Dog Deserves No Better'.\n\nPostwar 2 People were put on trial for this act found guilty and sentenced to 15 Years Imprisonment for the young airman's death.\n\n18 April 1944\n\nUnknown Airmen\n\n2nd Lt HJ Dougherty USAAF of the 331st BS 94th BG 8AF stated after the war -\n\n\"After being shot down and beaten by Civilians at Spandau I was taken to the house of the Towns Mayor where he showed me with pride the bodies of 4 RAF Bomber Command Airman hanging by their necks from nearby telegraph poles - all were Officers from what I could see...\"\n\n11/12 June 1944\n\nP/O DE Melcombe RCAF and Aircrew - 405 (Vancouver) RCAF Sqd\n\n1 POW and 5 Evaded Capture\n\nF/O J McVicar Clement RCAF safely abandoned his Lancaster and immediately started to evade capture,he located a French Farmer who aided him in his efforts by hiding him at Larcan - unknown to them all the Gestapo had launched a successful raid and captured the entire 'Marco Polo' Cell of the Resistance.\n\nAfter enduring intense periods of Torture someone inevitably talked and this led to the Family Farm of Monsieur and Madame Bodineau - where the airman was still being sheltered - being surrounded.\n\nAt 9 PM 24 July 1944 they moved in and in the process captured several members of the Resistance along with F/O Clement RCAF.\n\nAs the Airman was 'wearing Civilian Clothing' and despite still wearing his Identification Tags,orders were issued that he was to be treated no differently to the Resistance Members and suffered repeated beatings and Torture of an extremely violent nature (fingernails removed/electric shock are some of the types mentioned).\n\nAfter this they were all moved into the Tours Prison and while there,if it can be believed, the torture was increased tenfold in its ferocity.\n\nAs the USA approached the area, 26 Resistance Suspects -among them F/O Clements RCAF and Monsieur Bodineau - were taken under escort on 9 August 1944 to the Airfield in the Loire Valley at Parcay-Meslay (St Symphorien) in 3 Trucks where they were all then shot in the back of the head and left there while those who committed the murders flew away and left the area for safety.\n\nNo Charges were brought in relation to this matter after the end of the war.\n\n16-17 June 1944\n\nF/L SE Wodehouse RAF and Aircrew - 77 RAF Sqd\n\n8

Capture\n\nIntroduction\n\nThis Tale and the actions of one Elderly Woman residing in the Netherlands in what for many would be their later years is a perfect example of why so many Aircrew that evaded (and their Families) feel to this day such a depth of Gratitude and Kinship with those that helped them to evade be it large or small successful or not.\n\nIt also helps to explain the sadness felt by many for those later caught and usually murdered by the Gestapo or sent to a slow death in a Konzentrationslager\n\n- It is also an Excellent Example of how a War Crime Trial was carried out in 1946 and the lengths the RAF's Investigators went to obtain justice for the dead and closure for the next of kin.\n\nLastly this will demonstrate the conditions inside the Netherlands in the period 1940-1944, including details on the treatment of the Jewish Population, the role of the Camps inside the Country in the wider German System and the efforts the Germans went to in just one part of the country to destroy through fear and intimidation any effort to resist or aid those the occupiers declared to be no longer acceptable.\n\nAll 3 Airman were in hiding under the protection of the Resistance at a house whose address was 49 Diepentraat Tilburg in the Netherlands, the abode of the Elderly (60 Year Old) Miss Jacoba Pulskens or to her many guests simply 'Tante Coba' or Aunt Coba in English.\n\nDuring her period sheltering people on behalf of the Resistance she not only Helped Aircrews to make successful home runs, but also protected scores of Jewish Children and Families along with other people that were in opposition to the occupying powers interests.\n\nTilburg itself is located in the Southern area of the Netherlands known as Noord Brabant and the Aircrew were moving down their escape line in preparation for a move into Belgium when tragedy struck.\n\nUnlike many other areas that were Occupied and then liberated\n\n- be it by Soviet or Allied Forces' -\n\nthere are only a few locations that were occupied fully or to a large degree from the day they 'surrendered' to the end of the war in Europe (excluding Greece or Crete etc as they were in the Med or Singapore/Hong Kong/Ambon Island as these were in the Pacific, and were not therefore in the European Theatre).\n\nThese are (in order of Invasion) Denmark, Norway and the Netherlands\n\n- this fact is often overlooked by historians of the war in favour of the Battles for France or Belgium on the Allied side or the Campaigns in the East by the Soviet Side.\n\nAdditionally most people believe that the Netherlands were liberated during Operation Market Garden (September 1944) or in the period directly afterwards\n\n- this again is also incorrect -\n\n- as Operation Manna Amply demonstrated -\n\nwith over 3 Million of the population of the Netherlands still under Occupation at that point in the war.\n\n'Tante Coba's' First 'Taste' of being under German Control took place during the Great War while she was still in Belgium, which Germany Invaded on 4 August 1914 after the Belgian Government declined the German Army access across its boarders.\n\nBy the end of September 1914 almost all of Belgium was occupied by the Germans (Antwerp Surrendered after being under Siege from August during October 1914 and Brussels Surrendered 20/21 August 1914), with only some of the regions in the extreme west still unoccupied or now active warzones (Ypres would be a good example of this in Western Belgium).\n\nMany Civilians, and it has to be said Army Members as well, immediately fled to the nearby Netherlands whereupon all that had carried arms against Germany were interned for the duration of the war due to its own countries Neutrality, while doing their best to cater for the Refugees now crossing into the Netherlands in larger and larger numbers.\n\nAs of December 1914 Belgium was effectively under the control of Germany for the duration of the Great War to a large extent, the new ruling power being no longer the Belgian Parliament but the German Controlled Kaiserliche Deutsche Generalgouvernement Belgien, with the Ruler of Belgium now called the Generalgouverneur and based in Brussels.\n\nThis was confirmed formally by the Kaiser after he announced it in the form of an Imperial Decree in Berlin on 23 August 1914, and its important to note that this was not just for Belgium but for ALL German Occupied Territory's of the Great War.\n\nThe Kaiser Wilhelm II appointed as the Generalgouverneur of Belgium Freiherr Wilhelm Leopold Colmar von der Goltz (1843-1916), who was then replaced in November 1914 by Moritz Ferdinand von Bissing (1845-1917), who is most remembered for signing the execution order of Nurse Edith Louisa Cavell (1865-1915) who was shot by a firing squad at Brussels after being found Guilty of being a 'spy' alongside another member of her group Belgian Philippe Baucq on 12 October 1915.\n\nThe last words recorded by the Officer in charge of the Firing squad are recorded as being spoken by Philippe Baucq when he yelled just before the order to fire was given\n\n- 'In the Presence of death we are all Comrades'.\n\nAfter the Death of Moritz Ferdinand von Bissing, he in turn was replaced in 1917 by Ludwig Alexander Friedrich August Philipp Freiherr von Falkenhayn (1844-1936), who held the position until the Armistice of 1918.\n\nSome of the changes enforced on Belgium included banning the use of the Belgian Language, with only the German Language now to be used in speech and other areas like newspapers or mail.\n\nOther incidents that would no doubt have helped to solidify 'Tante Coba's' decision in regard to her own Mischief later in the war would have included the period now known as the 'Rape of Belgium' and the wholesale execution of members of the Catholic Clergy throughout Belgium during this period and for sometime after.\n\nDuring the German Armies Offensive from August 1914 through to September 1914 German Forces burnt homes and carried out widescale executions of families throughout eastern and central Belgium with some of the worst events taking place at Aarschot 156 Killed, Andeene 211 Killed, Tamines 383 Killed and Dinant 665 Killed.\n\nThe worst however took place at Leuven on 25 August 1914 where a University holding over 230 000 Books was burnt down to the ground by using incendiaries and petrol and 248 People Killed along with another\n\n42 000 ordered to leave the area with nothing more then what they were able to carry.\n\nAmong those who were shot were the Cities Mayor, Rector and all the Police Force while more were deported back to Germany to work in their factories from those now forced to abandon their homes.\n\nThe Germans then looted Military and Civilian areas of their foodstuffs along with other strategic materials and modern industrial equipment all of which was later transported by rail back to Germany.\n\nIn regard to the attitude of the Germans involved in the attacks targeting Leuven (Including the 94 Ton 16.5 Inch Heavy Siege Mortar 'Dicke Bertha' or 'Big Bertha' which fired a 1807lb Shell) a German Officer would later record -\n\n\"We Shall Wipe it Out.\n\nNot one stone will stand upon another.\n\nWe will teach them to respect Germany.\n\nFor Generations people will come and see what we have done.\"\n\nOther cases involved Hostages being Shot along with Priests and members of the Catholic Community including Nuns, while other crimes such as rape also took place amongst the people of Belgium as a whole.\n\nThis period is now known in history as the 'Rape of Belgium', while the Germans referred to it as being the time of the 'Schrecklichkeit' (Terror or Frightfulness).\n\nAs will be seen below the case of Gabrielle Petit has strong echoes of 'Tante Coba's' Background and future actions in more ways then one, it may have also been yet another event that helped to lead to her ultimate role after the Netherlands were invaded in 1940\n\n- her story was also virtually unknown until after the war -\n\nanother similarity with the ultimate fate that befell that of 'Tante Coba'.\n\nGabrielle Alina Eugenia Maria Petit was born 20 February 1893 in Belgium to Poor Working Class Parents, she was educated under the nuns at Breugeltte' Catholic Boarding School after the death of her mother while she was still a child and by 1914 was residing in Brussels while working as a saleswoman at the age of 21.\n\nAfter Belgium was invaded she joined the Belgian Red Cross almost immediately, one of her first acts of overt defiance was to aid a wounded Belgian soldier who just happened to be her Fiancé Maurice Gobert in crossing over into Neutral Holland in late 1914.\n\nShortly afterwards she made contact with British Intelligence and started to pass details to them on German Troop Movements she had witnessed while crossing the boarder with Maurice Gobert and during their passage through Belgium.\n\nShortly after reuniting with his regiment and after recovering from his Journey Maurice Gobert not wishing to be Interned then left the Netherlands with some others to continue the fight in France.\n\nThis was in fact his second escape as after the battles around Hofstade where he was wounded, he had been captured and was a POW of the Germans before he managed to escape and then return back to his parents home to recover from his wounds with the help of Gabrielle before they left bound for the boarder together.\n\nMeantime Gabrielle had by this time been recruited 'formally' by the British to Spy on the Germans and after receiving some rudimentary training she was successfully returned back into Belgium to begin her new role.\n\nUsing a number of False Identities she was very successful in finding out details on German Units inside Belgium or heading to the front line at Ypres, as well as the railway transmission codes preceding these transports which she successfully passed onto England.\n\nNot being satisfied with these actions, she also distributed the 'illegal' newspaper 'La Libre Belgique' and distributed mail via the underground mail service known as 'Mot du Soldat'.\n\nThroughout this entire period she was continuing to assist men in crossing the boarder into the Netherlands -with the occasional family or child also thrown in for good measure.\n\nDuring February 1916 the Germans finally caught up with her after she was betrayed by a German Sympathiser, after a period of interrogation she faced a German Court and was found guilty 1 March 1916, her sentence Death by firing squad.\n\nThe sentence was carried out on 1 April 1916 after several attempts to get her to betray her own helpers or become a double agent failed, after being pronounced dead she was buried in the same field she had been shot in at Schaarbeek in an already unmarked freshly dug grave that had been earlier prepared before the execution.\n\nAfter the war when her story became known, she was loacted and then recovered to be given a formal burial during May 1919 in the Local Cemetery at Schaarbeek where she was laid to rest beside 2 Belgian Men also shot by the Germans in a similar manner.\n\nA monument was erected in her honour in Brussels while in her home town a square was named after her.\n\nIn 1916-1917 Germanys Manpower Shortage was becoming more and more acute (again echoes of the future here), so to overcome these problems Male and Female workers were used in Armaments Factories in Germany and Belgium as forced labour.\n\nIt was during this period of the War that 'Tante Coba' started to get upto what she called afterwards her own piece of 'Mischief', while still in Occupied Belgium after being 'ordered' to work in one of these factories.\n\nAt first earlier in the war, all she did was to Smuggle items across the boarder in either direction by hiding them on her person while at the same time learning how to bluff her way past check points and other forms of boarder controls in her area.\n\nThis was not as simple as it sounds as from Spring 1915 the Germans erected an Electric Fence powered by 2000 Volts of electricity which was supplied by several different PowerStation's all along its length, it ran for 125 Mile's of the Boarder between the Netherlands and Belgium and reached heights of upto 3 Meters.\n\nThe death toll from this fence is still unknown but some sources in Belgium and the Netherlands record it as being as high as 2-3000 People by the time of the armistice with victims ranging in age and sex.\n\nThis Fence also lead to the reduction and then almost complete destruction of Social relationships between Belgium and the Netherlands and effected in particular the Netherlands Population in the Southern Half of both Countries (including Tilburg), with some local dialects being lost forever as a direct result.\n\nAdded to this were the usual Checkpoints/Boarder Guards/Machine Gun Positions and other forms of boarder security that can be expected in wartime.\n\nNot long after starting her own time in a Belgian Factory manufacturing Shells and Hand Grenades as forced labour, she started to go about sabotaging its production efforts by stealing and hiding at her home Copper fittings vital to the process\n\n- after the war she would often show off some of these pieces of Copper and other bits of metal from the production line to those that visited her.\n\nAt the same time 'Tante Koba' was getting upto her mischief, in a country quite literally half a world away from her in Australia one of the three Aircrew she would shelter was being born to his parents Charles and Beatrice Nott in the heart of farming country in Central Western NSW at Armidale on 26 March 1918.\n\nThe young Childs Father was not present as he was away in France after enlisting in 1917 and arriving there in 1918 just in time for the last big German Offensive.\n\nWhen he returned home due to a shortage of shipping the AIF returned to Australia in what was referred to as it being their order of enlistment (IE 1915 before 1918 etc) so he never got to see his son until he returned to the family farm in 1922, by which time he had not only seen service with the AIF but had also been sent to Germany for a period as part of the occupation force after the Armistice and then seen the sights of England before being 'allowed' to board his Troopship back home.\n\nHis Son was Named Jack Stewart\n\n- Jack was a Family tradition but Stewart was in honour of his best friend from school who was killed at Fromelle in 1916, one of the many simply listed Missing Presumed Killed as no body was ever located.\n\nThis was another of the reasons that led him to joining up in 1917 once he was able to prove he was no longer needed on the farm and his young wife would not be under undue stress by his enlistment.\n\nHe had in fact tried twice already but on each time his enlistment was deferred as the farm he worked on was a milking one with Cows as well as sheep and therefore 'vital to the war effort'.\n\nIt wasn't til his Father and Jacks future Grandfather (who was a Boer War Veteran) arrived to assist on the farm that the army agreed to his enlistment finally being allowed to take place.\n\nAfter the War 1931-1939\n\nIn 1931 'Tante Coba' returned back to her native Tilburg and took on the job of being a cleaning lady and worked inside the Public Works Building on Lange Schijfstraat and occasionally would also clean the Canissiusschool located on Korvelseweg (Tilburg's Main Road).\n\nAt this time she also started to live at her House on 49 Diepenstraat and was still quite happily un-married.\n\nIt is reported that when asked about marriage after she had returned to Tilburg she stated -\n\n\"The Boys Are Not Like me Enough!\". (\"Der Jongens vinden mij niet mooi genoeg!\")\n\nBeside her House at 49 Diepenstraat there was her Grocer Mr Sjef van Eerdewijk and his Wife Anna\n\n- Mr Eerdewijk describing her after the war as being -\n\n\"..regular member of the church's Congregation that attended the Kapucijnen Kerk (Church) on the Korvelseweg, because she loved 'hearing the beautiful sounds that took place inside there' \".\n\nShe was also known for undertaking a strict life of Temperance as the church at that time expected of her due to her Catholic upbringing\n\n- Everone in Tilburg recalled her as being -\n\n\"..Friendly and Humble Woman who had a love for fun and mischief especially with the Tilburg locals near to her home which included her Brother and his Wife\".\n\nSome People also recalled how their children were sometimes scared of her and she was for a period nicknamed the \"witch\" by those children\n\n- this misconception due to, as with all children\n\n- overactive imaginations brought about by her sometimes unkempt appearance.\n\nShe was also known for her visits to the Cafe L'Echo des Montagnes located on the square near the Politie Kazerne where she would have her occasional half a pint of Beer\n\n- sometimes she would also take along with her the Aircrew she would be sheltering as her Escort.\n\nThis was especially dangerous during the war as while undertaking these \"visit's\" she would often find herself and her 'Boys' quite literally right under the Gestapo's noses due to them baseing themselves inside that very same Politie Kazerne she would walk past before the war to reach the Cafe.\n\nWhenever her Brother tried to discourage these visits by asking her why she would put herself at risk so much, her reply more often then not was\n\n- 'Because the boys needed some air and so do I'.\n\nAnd that was an end to it as far as she was concerned\n\n- her 'Boys' always came first with her\n\n- no matter how risky their needs may have been.\n\nOther people also noted that she loved doing Crosswords and that she could be \"Laconic and occasionally reacted impulsively'\".\n\nOther Noteable Germans Involved in Her Story or assigned to Capture or Destroy Netherlands baesed Resistance efforts included (1940-1945) -\n\nDr Hans-Georg Calmeyer (1903-1972) -\n\nCommanded Abteilung Innere Verwaltung\n\nAssisted Thousands of Jewish People by falsifying their 'Jewishness' in German Records ie 1/3 etc and in 1988 was awarded a Posthumous Israeli Award the Yad Vashem for his efforts which was presented to his son.\n\nNumbers mentioned are (all are approximate only and may be larger or smaller as exact figures are unknown) - 5700 Cases made 'doubtful' to the German System with at least 3700 spared by his work from deportations etc.\n\nIt should also be mentioned that he also took part in approving the transportation of 140 000 People\n\n- but that figure could so easily have been so much more but for his efforts and legal know how which enabled him to deceive the system from within.\n\nErich Deppner (1910-2005) -\n\nCommander Abt IV Gegnerbekampfung in the Hauge reporting directly to Befhelshaber Sicherheit der Polizei und der SD Nederlands Wilhelm Harster.\n\nHe also reported to Erich Naumann and Karl Eberhard Schongarth as part of his duites.\n\nHis role was simple\n\n- to combat all forms of resistance inside his zone of responsibillity to the German Miliarty and Civil Authoriets, as well as assisting other Commands outside his in defeating All acts at resistance -\n\nfrom his office nationwaide sweeps against the Netheralnds Resistance Forces were conducted under his overall command.\n\nDuring April 1942 operating under orders given by Reichsfurher der SS Himmler and Hanns Albin Rauter he was ordered to oversee the immeadite disposal of 65-75 Russian POWs held at the Polizeiliches Durchgangslager Amersfoort.\n\nThese POWs had firstly arived at the camp during September 1941 as a group of 101 Men, by the time the order was given this total had been reduce down to 65-75.\n\nThe POWs were lead outside Polizeiliches Durchgangslager Amersfoort and driven in a apir of trucks to the nearby execution field where a team of 4 SS members awaited them including Erich Deppner and Karl Friedrich Titho (1911-2001) futire commander of KZ Herzogenbusch.\n\nThe method used to kill the 65-75 Men was recorded by the SS in their records as being\n\n' ....were marched upto the alredy dug pits in groups and then shot in groups..'\n\nSeveral POWs were confirmed as having been shot in the neck or head by Erich Deppner in the\n\n'...usual manner...'.\n\nHe also was breifly in command of Durchgangslager Westerbork and oversaw the first Deporation Transport Train which dispatched 1000 Netherland Jews of which the Majority were Children or Women to\n\nAuschwitz-Birkneau.\n\nThis led to him receiving a personal letter from Reichsfurher der SS Himmler Thanking Him for his excllent work after he was relived by Albert Konrad Gemmeker in June 1943.\n\nAfter Operation Overlord took place on 6 June 1944 and the rapid liberation of Paris (25 August 1944) and then Brussels (3 September 1944), the Germans transfered from the Scheveningen Prison in the Netheralnds to KZ Herzogenbusch all of its 1500 Netherland Prisoners.\n\nThe Prision at Scheveningen had earned the nickname locally as the Oranj Hotel or Orange Hotel due to its resdinets nearley all being members of the Netherlands Resistance Movement that had been captued alive by the Germans.\n\nAfter ariving at KZ Herzogenbusch, all These Prisoners were imprsioned inside the area refered to as the\n\n'Bunker' in isolation from the Camps General Population and under Noteably higher security.\n\nDuring the period of Late July through to August 1944 Erich Deppner was ordered to KZ Herzogenbusch under the orders of Adolf Hitler to oversee the execution under the Furher's Niedermachungsbefehl which was issued on 30 July 1944\n\n- the Execution of All Captured 'Terrorists and Sabouters' by Firing Squad.\n\nDue to his intimate knowledge of the Netherlands Resitance Members Erich Deppner personally made the list of those to be shot in the first batch of executions leading to the death of 450 Netherland Resistance Members during August and ending in Early September 1944 at KZ Herzogenbusch's execution area.\n\nHe was also present and once again took part in the Excutions of the 450 Resistance Members, once more in the usual neck or head shot method which he persoanlly favoured above all else.\n\nPost War this Officer was spared the Netherlands desire for Justice and instead served under Reinhard Gehlen (1902-1979) as part of the Intellignce Orgainsation that was set up under his Command using the Alais Egon Dietrich and then later Ernst Borchert and finally Agent V-616.\n\nThroughout this period after the war the Neatherlands made over 20 Attempts to have him extradited to face his accuersers and then receive justice but all were efforts to do so were either obstructed or outright denied thanks to pressure from his new masters West Germany and the American OSS/CIA.\n\nHe was finaly chrged with being complict in the murders of the Soviet POWs at Polizeiliches Durchgangslager Amersfoort during April 1942 on 20 January 1964 in a Munich Court, after heraing his testimonary he was found Not Guilty by a Jury inside the Court Room of the District Court of Munich on 22 January 1964.\n\nAs a Compairson in the Netherlands from 1949-1951 3 Germans that worked under the Command of Erich Deppner were charged with War Crimes, all 3 were found guilty leading to one of them being Shot by a Dutch Firing Squad and 2 Sentenced to Prision Terms\n\n- they were however unable to get the Chief 'Defendant' responsibile for the Crimes detailed above.\n\nIf ever there was a better example of making a 'deal with devil' by the Allies Postwar it would be hard to find one this blatantly offensive to the a Allied Country that had suffered so much in the War.\n\nThe Russian POWs have their own independent memorial now located at the former Polizeiliches Durchgangslager Amersfoort in the Netherlands, along with so many more names now recorded on the various memorials loacted there.\n\nAlbert Konrad Gemmeker (1907-1982)\n\nDurchgangslager Westerbork Commander responsibile for approx 80 000 Jews and Other Enemies of the Reich being deported to Extermination Camps in Poland and Germany.\n\nNicknamed the Polite German due to his lack of enjoyment in torture or other extreme methods while the camp commander.\n\nServed as Einsatzgruppen B Commander in the East Novemebr 1941-March 1943 and reported to his superior Adolf Eichmann (1906-1962) during November 1941 that his group was responsibile for 17 256 People being killed in the area of Smolensk by the usual methods, including 3 Motoriesd Vans pumping Carbon Dixoide into their rear to aid in the 'eradication of the population'.\n\nHe was detached to serve in the Netherlands September 1943 - July 1944 as the Befehlshaber der Sicherheit der Polizei und de SD."
