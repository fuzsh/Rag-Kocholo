In the Cold War, nuclear forces were central to U.S. defense policy, resulting in the buildup of a large arsenal. Since that time, nuclear forces have figured less prominently than conventional forces, and the United States has not built any new nuclear weapons or delivery systems for many years. The nation’s current nuclear forces are reaching the\n\nRead More\n\nDOD: FY 2016 Annual Report on Cost Assessment Activities\n\nThe estimated cost of this report for the Department of Defense is approximately $70,000 in Fiscal Years 2016-2017. This includes $65,000 in expenses and $5,000 in DoD labor. President Obama signed the Weapon Systems Acquisition Reform Act (WSARA) of 2009, Public Law 111-23, into law to reform the defense acquisition processes and to bring cost growth under control. To accomplish this, WSARA established the position of Director of Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation (CAPE) in\n\nRead More\n\nAmerica’s Nuclear Backbone: The Value of ICBMs and the New Ground-Based Strategic Deterrent\n\nGiven the rapid burgeoning of the global threat environment, it is imperative that the US maintains a highly credible strategic deterrent force. ICBMs are a key piece of this force structure. However, recent decades have seen the United States assume significant risk by failing to modernize the nuclear enterprise, including ICBMS. Such investment can no longer be deferred. This study explains the unique functions ICBMs afford the strategic deterrent enterprise, and outlines a vision for\n\nRead More\n\nBuilding Better Pilots: Considerations to Ensure T-X Success\n\nThe T-X program must succeed, as it represents the foundation on which core US Air Force missions are based. Leadership is keenly aware that every year the T-38 Talon remains in service, sustainment costs will surge, while the aviators who will fly the Air Force’s most modern and sophisticated, or “fifth generation,” aircraft will not receive an optimum foundation of skills in pilot training. A simple aircraft replacement for the T-38 is not the goal.\n\nRead More\n\nThe Parabolic Curve: Creating Operational Agility in the Third Offset Strategy\n\nThe “third offset strategy” is viewed as the third chapter of a long running United States defense policy, an evolution driven by a requirement to “offset” current and future threat capabilities in an increasingly complex and constrained environment. Unfortunately, the rhetoric of this strategy has seemingly outpaced content to support its goals. The US Air Force’s Strategic Master Plan and Future Operating Concepts, for example, provide a broad vector and vision, but lack actionable substance.\n\nRead More"
