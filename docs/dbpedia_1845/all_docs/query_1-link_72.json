        "text": "The Indian Army is undergoing significant modernization efforts, and the infantry is a key aspect of this transformation. The introduction of new weapons like the Israeli Negev LMG, Russian AK-203 assault rifle, and American Sig-716i battle rifle marks a significant upgrade from their older counterparts. Here's a brief overview of each weapon: - Negev LMG (Israel): A lightweight, gas-operated machine gun with a high rate of fire, replacing the INSAS LMG. - AK-203 (Russia): A modernized variant of the AK-47, offering improved accuracy and reliability, replacing older AKM pattern rifles. - Sig-716i (USA): A battle-proven, gas-operated rifle with a high accuracy rate, replacing the INSAS rifle. These new weapons will enhance the Indian Army's combat capabilities, providing soldiers with more efficient and effective firepower.\n\nAustralia's military capabilities are taking a giant leap forward with the introduction of the AS21 Redback Infantry Fighting Vehicle. This newly announced armored innovation is set to revolutionize the Australian Army, replacing the ageing M113 armoured personnel carriers, combining advanced weaponry, superior protection, and cutting-edge technology. In my latest video, I delve into the heart of the AS21 Redback, exploring its impressive capabilities and the significant role it will play in future defense tactics. From its state-of-the-art weapon systems to its robust protective features, discover how the Redback IFV is poised to dominate the battlefield and enhance our military prowess. Personally, I think these look fantastic, a sorely-needed and great piece of tech to better equip our troops, and the fact that they are being built right here in Australia is icing on the cake. Let me know if you think we made the right choice, out of the Redback IFVs from Hanwha or the Lynx IFVs from Rheinmetall. Or whether you think we should have spent the money elsewhere. Today, we're talking tactics.\n\nAnswer to What is the standard infantry weapon in the Russian Military at this point? Is it the tested and tried 'AK-47', or is it more like the US Army AR-15 and such? by Manilla Ice https://lnkd.in/efg8AJrp Without a scope which is stated in the answer making it useless to buy is completely untrue. 1) If it is to be used in the military then obviously their military scientists can evolve the AK-47 which according to my father, \"It was the gun responsible for winning the war\". Invented by Soviet Russian General Mikhail Kalashnikov. 2) Military Scientists are to ensure that the grade sold to citizens around the world cannot be modified. If attempted then the gun must loose accuracy and cause damage to the user. According to General Kalashnikov after he had seen what the AK-47 caused after the war he then stated that he wished that he had never invented the AK-47. Based on his words, the AK-47 grade for sale worldwide to citizens, the Military Grade AK-47 must be manufactured in The Russian Federation only in a certain number according to the current number of soldiers and distributed to only Russian soldiers within General Of The Armed Forces of The Russian Federation Valery Gerasimov."
