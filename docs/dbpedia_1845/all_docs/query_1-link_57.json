        "text": "Lieutenant-Colonel Commandant, John Doyle of the 87th Regiment of Foot\n\nThe Secretary-at-War wrote to Major John Doyle on 18 September 1793, advising Doyle that HM The King had approved Doyle's raising of the 87th Regiment of Foot. Once the Regiment was recruited and considered fit for active continental service it embarked for Flanders in summer 1794, as part of a force commanded by Major General the Earl of Moira. The overall commander in Flanders was HRH The Duke of York.\n\nOn 15 July 1794, enemy cavalry attacked the 87th Regiment at the bridge in Alost while they were deploying into the town to cover movement by the rest of the army. Two enemy hussars wounded Doyle in the head and arm and he became separated from his Regiment. Fortunately his mount was able to outrun the opposition and he returned to his Regiment. The attack was repulsed and the Regiment was thanked in orders for its action and bravery. However, it was recorded that the very first man to be wounded in the Regiment's first action was none other than its Lieutenant-Colonel Commandant, John Doyle. The Duke of York wrote:\n\n'Lord Moira speaks highly of the conduct of the officers and men of the EIGHTY-SEVENTH regiment on this occasion, particularly of Lieut-Colonel Doyle, commanding the corps, who was severely wounded.'\n\nDoyle was sent to England to recover from his wounds, leaving Lieutenant Colonel Lord Dungarvan (later the Earl of Cork) in command. Unfortunately, when the regiment was quartered in Bergen-op-Zoom in 1795, the Dutch garrison revolted and opened the gates to a 20,000 strong French force. The 87th were marched to France as prisoners of war. Meanwhile, John Doyle, following his recovery in England, was appointed Colonel of the 87th Regiment of Foot on 3 May 1796 and later promoted to Brigadier-General."
