Should you wish to place an advert, contact me and I'll publish it here asap.\n\nPhotographs\n\nCan you identify any of the people in the following photographs?\n\nA-I, J-Z, Research Ads, New Ads\n\nS/Sgt Johnny Ainsworth (advert placed 05/02/20)\n\nI'm currently looking for information or photographs of S/Sgt John Ainsworth, Flt Ssgt, 14 Flt, F Sqn. I've found that John Landed on LZ S in Glider 194. His co-pilot was Sgt Phillip and they were carrying elements of the Border Regt. John died young (aged 48) and we know very little about his service in Arnhem. Would be fantastic to hear from anyone that knew him. Tim Wargen, wa4405@gmail.com\n\nPte Gilbert Anderson (KIA 25/09/44)\n\nI am looking for information or photos of my uncle, Pte 3606646 Gilbert Anderson. He was born in Mosley (UK) and lived in Blackpool. His parents: Thomas and Elizabeth Anderson. He was a member of the 11th Battalion Parachute Regiment, 2nd Platoon C Coy. He was killed in action on the 25th of September 1944 during the Battle of Arnhem. He had a fieldgrave at Onderlangs Arnhem. We believe he is one of the unknown soldiers in the war cemetry Oosterbeek. Tanja van Zon-Anderson, tanjavanzon@casema.nl\n\nHarold Andrew\n\nLooking for any information about my Grandad who served in the South Staffs and took part in Market Garden . His name was Harold Andrew and was from Lincolnshire. Any information would be much appreciated as I only found out about his service last year and he passed away when I was quite young and so never got the chance to talk to him about this part of his life. andrew.whel@ntlworld.com\n\n\"Tommy Atkins\"\n\nAt 1430 hrs on a fine sunny day between 14th - 29th September 1944, two German soldiers on a reconnoitering mission astride a tandem bicycle, rescue an injured British soldier. In a wooded area about 1.5 kms north of the Albert Canal at Merxem near Antwerp (probably close to Merxem Castle) they find and assist a lone injured British Tommy (or maybe Canadian) and probably from the nature of his injuries, a Para or Glider pilot/trooper. We know for sure that in civilian life \"Tommy\" was a flautist with the London Symphony Orchestra or another London Orchestra. Some 63 years on, the long arm of military camaraderie from both sides of that armed conflict stretches across time and cyberspace to relive that act of compassion and friendship. The editor is reasonably convinced now after substantial intelligence gathering that \"Tommy\" was a Glider Pilot engaged in Operation Market Garden in one of 3 'lifts' on the 17th, 18th or 19th September. Some 31 gliders, with 2 more unaccounted for, crashed en route to Arnhem in Holland and Belgium over those 3 days, but none identified thus far as specifically crashing in Merxem. The injuries are however, indicative of a crashed GP. We are advised that War Diaries for this Operation are not as detailed as we would hope for, but do record that 2 gliders each with 2 pilots were force landed near Antwerp. Further investigation however establishes that neither of these crashes was near Merxem. Let the search for \"Tommy Atkins\" continue. More details - http://djkl22935157.googlepages.com/thesearchfortommyatkinsww2merxembelgium1\n\nCpl Cecil \"Bill\" Bailey\n\nMy late father was captured Sept 20th 1944 at Arnhem, he was in the 156 Bn The Parachute Regiment \"B\" Coy. After he was captured he was sent by train to Stalag XIIA, twelve days later he was transferred to Stalag IIA. My dad passed away 4 years ago & I'm trying to collate all the information I can on his life so the memories will never die. I have lots on his war service but I would love to hear from anyone who knew him or was in Stalag IIA, so I can get an idea of what life was like in that camp. He was a POW for approx 7 months. Any help would be greatly appreciated. bobnorfolk@btinternet.com\n\nPte L. T. Bailey\n\nI recall when I was a young teenager in 1957, a neighbour of mine was \"Mr Bailey\", who my parents said had fought at Arnhem; I believe he had been wounded in one arm. My wife has traced him by means of public records to 2010, living in Clacton, Essex, but since that time he has 'gone off-grid' and we have been unable to progress this further. However, we have found that 259646 Private L T Bailey of the 2nd Parachute Battalion was registered at PoW Camp XIIA with the PoW Number 90363. The Unit reference and PoW number are consistent with those who fought at Arnhem, possibly at the bridge. Does anyone have any information on him? Roy Gledhill, Web.Shopper@btinternet.com\n\nWalter Clement Bailey\n\n10603469, 1st Airborne Recce - possibly Freddie Gough's driver, wounded and POW. I have his paybook and am seeking information about him. Alistair Taylor, eckythescot@blueyonder.co.uk\n\nJames Baldwin\n\nI'm trying to find out about my cousin James Baldwin (middle initial possibly G). My Uncle tells me he was a red beret dropped at Arnhem. He was captured and taken prisoner of war. He escaped to Norway where it is believed he married a pig farmers daughter. I would like to find out more about his story and be able to contact him and his descendants if any still survive. One other clue I have is his brother John (aka Jacky) was a sniper in WW2. I think they came from around the Caledonian rd/Holloway area of North London and would be about 88 and 85 yrs old respectively by now. Gazza1@ntlworld.com\n\nCapts David Ballingall and R.A. \"Ron\" Beal (advert placed 19/02/15)\n\nI am researching an aspect of Operation Market Garden in connection with a possible book. I am hoping to contact two men who served under Maj Brian Urquhart on the I British Airborne Corps staff. They are (with ranks as of Sep 44): Captain David Ballingall, Captain R.A. (Ron) Beal. My dad's cousin, John Thomas (Jack) Brierley was a trooper in C Coy, 1st Canadian Parachute Bn. He made the Normandy jump but was was KIA at Caen, 2 Aug 44. Tony Hibbert was also a good friend of mine, and Sir Brian Urquhart has been very helpful to me in my research. Michael Cain (Commander, USNR, ret.), corgis2@me.com\n\nPte Vincent (Ginger) Banks\n\nMy dad Pte Vincent Banks known as ginger, 1st Airborne, 1st Battalion Border Regiment, S.Coy, 3\" Mortar, 3606858, is seeking Pte Stanley (Ginger) Tierney also Mortar or anyone who knows of him.Thank you.Tracey Bridge.

Any information most welcome. markburnett831@aol.com\n\nPte Bernard (Barney) Baron\n\n1st Border - HQ Company. No.3600516. I know he was part of the company defending the Oosterbeek perimeter and he got out on the last day by swimming across the river. I believe he is the soldier in the beret in the famous photo of the 4 men walking through the rubble. I would be delighted to hear from anyone who knew my father. Cliff.Baron@btopenworld.com\n\nAlbert Bateman\n\nBorn 1913 in Cheshunt Herts. My father was shot down at arnheim although badly wounded he was a pow (Stalag XIB, Fallingbostel) but was eventually repatriated. He has now unfortunately passed away and my grandson has been asking questions. This has made me want to know more. My father did not give much information about his war experiences. So I now feel that I can maybe find out something about him. It is not certain but possible that he is T/6479011 (formerly Royal Army Service Corps) Private A. Bateman of No.1 Section, Mortar Platoon, Support Company, 10th Parachute Battalion, POW number 118486. Jan Gillies, jan.gillies@btinternet.com\n\nCpl Arthur William \"Bill\" Batty\n\nMy father, who died 10 years ago, was an RASC air despatcher aboard a Dakota attacked by a german fighter over arnhem, they landed at Manston, Kent.

His name was Ralph Baverstock and he was a member of the 2nd Bn Parachute reg 1941 -45. He was a batman throughout this time, I would love to find out what officers he looked after.

Dave Baverstock, david.baverstock@hotmail.co.uk\n\nJohn Baxter\n\nI am looking for information on surviving members of \"J\" section, 1st Para of 1st airborne division. I am staying with a veteran, a Mr John Baxter, who fought at arnhem and in North Africa and Sicily. If anyone can help us can you please contact me via email on : tommanning36@hotmail.com .Thank you, Thomas Manning.\n\nSidney Beale\n\nI would be greatful for any information regaerding my grandfarther Sidney Beale from the area of Birmingham who sadly passed away 4 years ago. Not much information to go on. We think he was wounded at Arnhem and also had a pal called Peter who was KIA at Arnhem. Very little info I know but if anyone can remember him or has a list of wounded or members of the 1st Airborne during this time. Many thanks, Ben. benupton1@aol.com\n\nL/Cpl Robert Bell\n\nDoes anyone remember my father L/Ccpl Robert (Bob) Bell 250 (Airborne) Light Composite Company RASC? He was wounded during the battle of Arnhem, taken prisoner and died of his wounds en route to Germany. He is buried in Lochem 40 kilometers northeast of Arnhem. I have a letter from a Dutch family in Oosterbeek in whose house he was fighting on 22 - 23 September. I have the impression that he was wounded shortly after that. robbell2@compuserve.com\n\nThomas Templeton Bell\n\nMy grandfather was at Arnhem. His name was Thomas Templeton Bell. Born 28/10/1918 in Kells & died 29/10/1974 in Kirkcudbright. He was a shepherd in Kirkcudbright before going to war in the Kings Own Scottish Borderers & was captured at Arnhem & held as a POW. I imagine he was held for a long time & my dad says he was very ill when he came back to Scotland. He is now buried in Kirkcudbright grave yard. Any extra information you could help me with to continue my research on his army career would be much appreciated. Ron Bell, ronald_bell@hotmail.co.uk\n\nRichard \"Dick\" Austin Bennett-Goodman\n\nI would like to find out more about my father's wartime experiences during and following Arnhem. He died in 1988 and I have few details as he rarely spoke about this time. He was in the Royal Artillery, service number 5623839. Any information would be welcome. He was an Australian but joined up in England. Tim Bennett-Goodman, tim@richmix.org.uk\n\nGeorge Henry Beynon\n\nI'm looking for information about my father George Henry Beynon. From Taibach South Wales. My dad was a private man and did not talk much about his army days. I know he was in the 1st Parachute Battalion, 1st Airborne Division. Amongst other places I understand he completed part of his training in Tatton Park. I believe he boxed for his regiment - he fought professionally under the name Jerry Welsh. His best friend was Jimmy Nash from Newport. He once told me a story about a friend of his called Nicky Nastri who I understood escaped from the prisoner of war camp. I have recently been given letters my Mam and Dad wrote to each other whilst he was a POW in M-Stammlager 357 Hut E4. My dad passed away in 1994 aged 75yrs. Alan Beynon, albeynon@bigpond.com\n\nThomas Peter Berry\n\nI would like any information on my father. Thomas Peter Berry (Chick Berry). He was in 1st Battalion Parachute Regiment. His unit was number 1 LAD, REME detachment, and was on the first drop on the 17th Sept 1944. He joined the Army in 1934 as boy solider in the RA in Winchester as he was from Eastleigh in Hampshire. He joined number 1 Para 1941 done his jumps at Ringway, then He was in North Africa 1942, Tunisia and was injured by a land mine, and ended up in the French Foreign Legion for 10 months (by accident). Got back to his unit and went to, Sicily, Italy, D + 2 Normandy, Arnhem 1st drop, and swam the Rhine to get out. I think he was one of the last men out across the river. He was in the Black forest after Arnhem where he was blown up again. He was one of the founder members of the Tyneside Branch of the PRA. The information I would really like is Arnhem if any body could help if they knew him. He is on a photograph taken on the DZ at Arnhem he is the one on the right of the picture looking at a sun flower with other men I know this was him as he had a copy of the picture which I have and he gave me before he died 7 years ago. There was a comment about the flower maid at the time the picture was taken. david.p.berry@blueyonder.co.uk\n\nCharles Frederick Birch\n\nWould love to hear from anyone who knew my father Charlie. He went on the Bruneval Raid and was injured in the Arnhem raid, being blown into the water from where he was pulled out by the Dutch Resistance who moved him through safe houses and then home. He convalesed on the Isle of Wight and then went to the Brecon Beacons until he was demobbed from Ringwood. He spoke very little of the war until after he had a stroke, four years before his death, and thus my knowledge is very limited. eagleydo@yahoo.co.uk\n\nSid Blackmore\n\nMy name is Walter Lygo and I am trying to contact Sid Blackmore. I believe he served with my father (Bob Lygo) at Arnhem. We go to the commemorations every year, but never get to meet him. I would be very grateful if someone could put me in touch with Sid. My contact details are waltlygo@hotmail.co.uk\n\nChris Blakeley\n\nMy relative (a cousin of my mother's) who is now deceased, was Chris Blakeley, 13805440. He left Germany to escape Hitler. His original was name was Bachwitz, and he changed his name when he entered the British service. He had several combat jumps, the last one at Arnhem. He was apparently at the bridge for 9 days, and swam the Rhine to escape. That is about all I know, as Chris did not like to discuss his experiences. I would appreciate any information whatsoever, which can be sent to this email, SS400im@earthlink.net\n\nPte Norman Blakemore (KIA 09/06/43)\n\nI have been researching the death of my uncle -Pte. Norman Blakemore - 2nd (airborne) bn South Staffs regt., kia 9th July 1943, Sicily. Unfortunately no family photographs of him exist. His unit was S Company. Any help would be much appreciated. Paul Withers, Pkjocharwyld@aol.com\n\nSergeant Ernest Boardman\n\nMy grandfather ( service number 1648404) joined the RA at the start of the war and volunteered for the Parachute Regiment shortly afterwards. The only article I have of his is a certificate addressed to him from (I believe) King Olav of Norway thanking him for his valuable services in helping to restore freedom to Norway. The certificate is dated the day of Norway's liberation - 8 May 1945. My mother did have photos of him in his Para uniform, complete with beret and pegusus on a shoulder patch, but they have been lost. Like most troops he did not speak much about his war time exploits and has now sadly passed away. I would welcome any correspondence at me email address ian_hodkinson@hotmail.com or I can be contacted direct at my work which is Royal Air Force Stafford, Beaconside, Stafford - tel 01785 787359.\n\nEric Borders (KIA 20/09/44)\n\nMy brother-in-law Andrew Young is English and is related via his uncle with Eric Borders. I found out that Eric (No.14 Platoon, B Company, 1st Border) was wounded near Westerbouwing and died in the house of Kate ter Horst at September 20 1944. We both are born post war. Living not so far from Oosterbeek I visit Eric's grave for 15 years twice a year to remember him. Now I try to get a photograph of Eric. And maybe there are still members of No.14 Platoon who know what happened at Westerbouwing on September 19 or 20 1944. Henk ten Zijthoff, htenzijthoff@chello.nl\n\nPte Mark Borland (KIA 18/09/44)\n\nI am trying to find out more about my great uncle Mark Borland.

For about 15 years I have been researching my Uncle's history. He does not have a named grave and is therefore only on the Groesbeek memorial. In 1994, purely by chance, I read an article by Douglas Charlton in the Daily Mail on the operation. In the article there was specific mention of my Uncle and the injuries that lead to his death.

In this account he has Leslie, Himself, Sgt Callaghan, Wyatt, Bainbridge and Turrell (may be Lt) no mention of the batman.
