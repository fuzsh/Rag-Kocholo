        "text": "The British Army is the land-based forces of the United Kingdom. The British Army was heavily involved in Imperial affairs in India and most regiments (both infantry and cavalry) served in India at some point. Throughout the nineteenth century, and into the twentieth century, a significant number of British troops were stationed at India at any one time. In 1847, for instance, around 20% of British Army regiments were on the sub-continent, while at the outbreak of the First World War, around 30% of the British Army was based in India.[1] The General staff were supported by the Staff Corps and the Office of the Quarter Master General.\n\nUp until the early 1860s, a British man, or man of British descent could also be a soldier/officer in one of the Presidency Armies in India. These were separate from the British Army, instead consisting of regiments formed by the East India Company and under their control. Many men from those Armies then transferred to the British Army, so if you have a reference to a man in the British Army in India in the 1860s, he may well be one of those who transferred. You may be able to locate him in the records of either the Bengal Army, Madras Army, or Bombay Army.\n\nRegiments\n\nAny regiment name prefaced by the initials H.M. (Her or His Majesty's) is a British Army regiment, although the term is not strictly applied, especially amongst the ecclesiastical records. These regiments may be referred to as \"Royal Regiments\".\n\nRegiments are divided across several arms of the army, these being the Cavalry (who fought mounted on horseback), the Infantry (soldiers who fought on foot) and the support arms such as the Artillery (who used weaponry such as canons and large guns) and the Engineers construction, demolition, surveying etc.) Also see Regiment names terminology below.\n\nThe article History of British Army Infantry Regiments is a general history of the origin and development of the infantry regiments and explains some of the reforms that took place.\n\nTo browse the Infantry category, see British Army Infantry Regiments. From 1881, see 1881 Regimental Titles.\n\nTo browse the Cavalry category, see British Army Cavalry Regiments\n\nTo browse the Artillery category, see British Army Artillery Regiments\n\nThe cap badges of a few regiments can be found in Cap badge images.\n\nFor regiments serving in India, when a regiment was to return to England, the men were given the opportunity to 'volunteer for' (join) another British Army regiment in India. The view seems to have been \"A trained soldier in India is worth five recruits, and that soldier, when he is brought home, is not worth anything.\"[2]As an example, when the 96th Regiment of Foot was ordered home in September 1854, a ‘great number of men’ volunteered for the 32nd foot, thirty volunteered for the 43rd, while twenty-two volunteered for the 74th Highlanders.[3] However, when transferring to another unit, the soldiers were treated as new recruits, and lost any rank they had, reverting to the rank of a private,[4] although it appears likely that in practice they were promoted again reasonably quickly.\n\nLocating a regiment\n\nThere are many ways to find out locations at which a regiment was stationed. More labourious methods include tracking through the muster rolls, army lists or station lists published in newspapers. Many of our regiment articles include a timeline of major stations.\n\nThe archived website Regiments.org provides information about regimental deployments, which can range from general to specific. See External Links - Other, below. Additionally individual Fibiwiki regimental pages generally include links to relevant regimental pages from Regiments.org.\n\nOne online source providing incomplete but highly useful information, is:\n\nIndian portion of In Search of the 'Forlorn Hope': A Comprehensive Guide to Locating British Regiments and their Records (1640-WWI) by John M Kitzmiller - lists the location/year of all British regiments that served in India and related regions. (Regiments, Locations) . From Bob Holland’s Rampais website, archived. Kitzmillers's two volume book is now available online, see below.\n\nIke Skelton Combined Arms Research Library [CARL] (U.S. Army Command and General Staff College, Fort Leavenworth USA). Then select Resources/Digital Collections and scroll down to, and select the online collection, the Nafziger Collection of Orders of Battle which includes lists of “Stations of British Troops in India” (and a wider list for the whole army) transcribed from the sources such as the Army and Navy Gazette .\n\nTo access the contents, there is the Nafziger orders of battle collection : finding aid (link to a pdf download which depending on your browser you may need to locate in your downloads folder) to assist in navigating the titles available for viewing, and the links to those titles.\n\nThe finding aid is Searchable. There are title headings such as Stations of British Troops in India (available 1836-1904), British Regiments Serving in India, (available 1816-1835), Distribution of the British Army (available 1836-1868, 1872, 1899-1903) Stations of the British Army (available 1869-1904). The latter two titles include British troops in India. For specific lists from 1862, see\n\nStations of British Army troops in India. Also on that page (near the bottom) is a version of the Nafziger finding aid available on Archive.org.\n\nStations of the Royal Artillery in India\n\nNote that for some computers/browsers in the past it was not possible to search the Finding Aid, but this situation may have improved. If this is still the situation, \"British Regiments Serving in India\" 1816 is located on page 167. \"Distribution of the British Army\" 1836 is located on page 168. Alternatively use your internet Search engine with terms such as nafziger \"Stations of the British Army\" and a date.\n\nNote that publications such as Army and Navy Gazette and Naval & Military Gazette used as the source of the Nafziger data, are now available online for some years, see Military periodicals online.\n\nThe publication Monthly Army List, many of which are available as part of Army List for British Army online usually contains information on a monthly basis about regiments and the Royal Artillery, both under individual regiments, but also in a section \"Commands of the Army\", where the information is listed geographically (example for 1927 September (Archive.org), commencing page 18), for both UK and overseas Commands, including for India, generally listed under East Indies, which may also include Burma and Aden. Ceylon is listed under Dominions, Colonies and Protectorates etc. This information is generally not available during war time and perhaps some other periods, including editions in early years, which also lack Contents pages.\n\nThe publications New Annual Army List and New Army List, some of which are available on Army List for British Army online contain details of the regiments in the British Army for each year of publication. The details of each regiment in each volume will usually include where the regiment is garrisoned at that point of time. This is often located at the very top of the page which gives details of the regiment. As an example, (Archive.org) the 2nd Battalion of the 25th Regiment of Foot was stationed at Jubbulpore Bengal page 269 The New Annual Army List for 1873, shown in the top right hand corner.\n\nLocation of British Army Infantry and Cavalry Regiments 1878-1891 Remembering The Past, now archived. Transcriptions from Army Lists. Note, data is spread across the web page, and you may need to widen out the web page.\n\nIndian Army Lists will generally provide full details of British Cavalry and British Infantry Regiments in India and contain a Distribution of the Royal Artillery in India. Refer to the Content pages to locate the entries. Some earlier publications may also provide similar information. For editions online, see Indian Army List online.\n\nSee Stations of British Army troops in India for a few digitised editions of the quarterly publication Stations of Units of the Regular Forces, Militia, Special, Reserve, and Territorial Force by [Great Britain] War Office published by His Majesty’s Stationery Office (HMSO) for the years 1910, 1913, 1914. Army stations in Great Britain and the rest of the world. A good run of these publications is available at the University of Oxford.\n\nThe publication Aldershot Military Gazette contained regular entries for \"Stations of the British Army\", see Military periodicals online.\n\nFor information about Aldershot, (England) regarded as \"the Home of the British Army\", use the Aldershot Barrack Finder: 1855 - 1976 friendsofthealdershotmilitarymuseum.org.uk\n\nThe publication The United Service Journal and Naval and Military Magazine, which changed title over time, some of which are available on Military periodicals online also contain details of the regiments in the British Army for at least some periods, perhaps all. Stations of the British Army are generally tabulated within the “Editor’s Portfolio”, but sometimes separately. Examples\n\n\"Corrected to 15 November 1884\" page 669, 1884 and \"Corrected to 26 March 1888\", page 373 [1888). HathiTrust.\n\nThe London Gazette and The Edinburgh Gazette contained details of Stations of the British Army. As an example Stations at 2nd December 1858 pages 2057-2058, Issue: 6863 Publication date: 3 December 1858. thegazette.co.uk\n\nFor those able to visit the National Archives at Kew, there are catalogue entries WO 379/11 Stations of regiments 1859-1900 and WO 379/15 Stations of regiments 1901-1920 Examples of the type of records available are WO 379/11 details for the 52nd Regiment and WO 379/15 details for the 48th Regiment, both now archived webpages, but previously from respective regiments pages from the website maltaramc.com. These records are part of the WO 379 series \"Disposition and Movement of Regiment, Returns and Papers (Regimental Records)\"\n\nWO 25 records Embarkation Returns and Disembarkation Returns may also be useful. Records are filed in date of sailing sequence.[5] Embarkation records show Officers (named), the number of Other Ranks per unit, and the military cargo carried. As an example, an image of a record from WO 25/3544 shows officers and men from M M Gun No. 22 Battery leaving on the Ship 'Beltana' for India from Devonport on 26th February 1916.[6] Embarkation records can also originate overseas as the WO25 series includes records titled \"Abroad for Home\" and \"Between Stations Abroad\". Note: Selected WO 25 records are available as a free download from the National Archives, through TNA's Discovery catalogue, and selected WO 25 records are also available on the Ancestry database \"Canada, British Regimental Registers of Service, 1756-1900.[7]\n\nWO 97 records Distribution of the Army Monthly Returns include station of each battalion or company. Sample images.[8]\n\nRegiment names terminology\n\nRegiments, especially prior to the twentieth century, were not named in a uniform manner and the historical terminology used can be unfamiliar to a beginning researcher. Some common terms and the regiment types they apply to can be found below.\n\nTerm Regiment type Dragoons Cavalry Foot Infantry Fusiliers Infantry Grenadier Infantry Hussars Cavalry Lancers Cavalry Life Guards Cavalry Rifles Infantry\n\nWars and campaigns\n\nThe British Army were involved in numerous wars, campaigns and battles in India and the surrounding region. The Fibiwiki has a Chronological list of wars and campaigns.\n\nTo browse wars in the region, see the Wars and Campaigns category.\n\nTo browse battles, see the Battles category.\n\nEnlistment in India\n\nIt was possible for a man born in India to enlist in the British Army in India, a fact to be considered when researching. Enlistment was possible for men with European parents, or Eurasian men of fair complexion―those whose looks allowed them to ‘pass’ as white.[9]\n\nThere are some early 1800s references to mixed race soldiers, mainly musicians, with 'black' complexions.[10] There is one reference to an Anglo Indian Boy Trumpeter in the Royal Artillery c 1936[11]\n\nEnlistment and birth in other overseas British Empire countries\n\nWhen researching, keep in mind that similar to the situation in India, it was also possible for men from other countries to enlist when regiments were stationed in their countries.[12] Men whose fathers were in the British Army could be born anywhere in the world the British Army was stationed.\n\nIndians in the British Army\n\nThere were a limited number of Indians who were part of the British Army. C 1911, there were Indian soldiers serving in the Royal Artillery as drivers, and native gunners in ammunition columns serving as wagon-men. [13] During the First World War, there are Medal Index Card references to Lascars in the Royal Artillery, this rank was also known as a Gun Lascar. In 1924, Indian Mountain/Pack Batteries became Batteries in the Royal Artillery, which was the situation until 1939 when the Indian Mountain Batteries were transferred from the Royal Artillery to the Indian Regiment of Artillery.\n\nDuring the First World War there are also references to Lascars in the Inland Water Transport, Royal Engineers.\n\nThere were Indian and Burmese drivers and artificers in 1023 and 1024 Mechanical Transport Companies ASC, raised in Burma for service in Mesopotamia.\n\nFrom c 1921, there were Indian Mechanical Transport Companies, which were part of the Royal Army Service Corps, until subsequently transferred to the Indian Army.\n\nIndian Platoon, British Army Infantry Regiment\n\nFrom early 1922 , shortly after the introduction of the Vickers Machine Guns into Infantry Battalions[14], an Indian Platoon, or Support Company was attached to each British infantry regiment serving in India up until November 1932. Each such platoon comprised one Indian officer and 42 other ranks, their primary duty being to lead and care for the mule packs upon which guns and ammunition of the Machine-Gun Company were carried. However, these soldiers appear to have been regarded as part of the Indian Army. [15] Note however there was a Lancashire Fusiliers album which included 1934 in the title, which contained a photograph of the Indian Platoon, and a photograph of the Indian Machine Gun Platoon, 1st Battalion King's Shropshire Light Infantry Karachi 1938,[14] so at least some regiments contained these Platoons to a date after 1932.\n\nRecords\n\nSee also - Military reading list and Occupation:Soldier\n\nThere are various sources of information for finding out about a man in the British Army.\n\nArmy Lists\n\nArmy Lists are useful if you are researching an officer. There were Monthly, Quarterly and Annual editions published. Some of these were commercial publications, while some were official War Office publications, The official publications included Quarterly Army Lists from 1880 and Monthly Army Lists from August 1881. At least during the First World War, only the Monthly Lists cover the officers in “battalion order”[16], but this listing probably appeared in earlier publications also. Quarterly Army Lists only list regular, career officers and not others such as temporary officers and territorial officers who are to be found in the Monthly Army Lists.[17] The Monthly Army Lists are available on the open shelves at the National Archives and major libraries, (but date ranges may be unclear). Based on library catalogues, Bodleian Libraries University of Oxford, and the National Library of Scotland may have the best collections of Monthly Army Lists.\n\nFor British Library holdings, including regimental and regional lists, from 1642, see the BL guide \"Service Lists for the Army, Navy and Air Force\".

For details see Army List for British Army online‎‎ - Quarterly Army List.\n\nFor at least some war periods a Confidential or \"Security Edition\" was also published with known Monthly editions for August 1939 (available online) and September 1939, and it seems possible that Monthly Lists may have been continued after May 1940, to 1943, solely on a Confidential basis.[18]\n\nThe [London] Gazette\n\nThe [London] Gazette Official Public Record for the U.K. Free Search for officers' commissions and promotions, and gallantry awards for both officers and other soldiers.

The basic subscription levels do not provide access to military records. Findmypast requires at least a Plus level of subscription for military records, while Ancestry requires at least a Premium level of subscription for military records, and additionally requires a higher level subscription for access to some military images. Generally these websites provide free access for a limited number of days during the year. Depending where you live you may be able to access such websites for free at a library near you. See Miscellaneous tips - Access some subscription websites with a Library Card. Access to such sites, including fold3, is also available at FamilySearch Centres.\n\nWhere a record series appears on both findmypast, and Ancestry there may be differences in transcriptions of names which will affect the Search results. If you cannot initially find a record, it is suggested you try searching on both websites, and in addition on FamilySearch, a free website. Details of some of the military records on the latter site may be found under findmypast, below.\n\nA researcher advised that Army service record images on findmypast are usually much better quality and Ancestry's service records may be poorly indexed, however Ancestry has the advantage that you can scroll to the records immediately before and after, which could be relevant.[21]Another advised that findmypast has a far better search facility.[22] (Comparison of online providers for WW1 records.[23])\n\nAncestry now owns the pay military websites Fold3 and Forces War Records, which are included with the highest Ancestry subscription.\n\nFor both findmypast and Ancestry, it is possible to undertake a broad Search by selecting the Military category from the Search tab at the top of the webpages. This will search in all Military databases. However, should you wish to perform a more targeted Search, various databases are described below.\n\nFindmypast\n\nFindmypast, a pay website, contains a database British Army Service Records,[24] located in Armed Forces & Conflict/ Regimental & Service Records, which contains records between 1760 and 1920, for officers and other ranks, mostly from The National Archives.\n\nThis database consists of\n\nWO 22 - Royal Hospital Chelsea: returns of payment of Army and other pensions 1842-1883\n\nWO 23 - Royal Hospital Chelsea: admission books, registers, and papers 1702-1876\n\nWO 76 - Regimental records of officers' services 1775-1914\n\nWO 96 - Militia service records 1806-1915\n\nWO 97 - Chelsea: pensioners British Army service records 1760-1913\n\nWO 121 - Chelsea: pensioners' discharge documents 1760-1887\n\nWO 122 - Chelsea: pensioners' discharge documents, foreign regiments 1816-1817\n\nWO 128 - Imperial Yeomanry, soldiers' documents, South African War 1899-1902\n\nWO 131 - Chelsea: documents of soldiers awarded deferred pensions 1838-1896\n\nWO 339 - Officers' services, First World War, regular army and emergency reserve officers.

These records come from the Scots Guards, not from the National Archives. Include images.\n\nUpdate: Added c 2021/05/14, the database 'Scots Guards Service Records 1799-1939' described as \"service records from the Second World War and beyond\".[25]\n\nSee below for details of records in this database British Army Service Records.\n\nAn associated database is British Army Service Records Image Browse,[26] located in Armed forces & conflict/Service Records which contains the above records, excluding the First World War records and the 'Scots Guards Service Records'.\n\nAdditional separate databases include:\n\nBritish Army, Coldstream Guards 1800-1947, [27] located in Armed Forces & Conflict/Regimental & Service Records. Originally introduced as part of the database British Army Service Records above, but c 27 Nov. 2020 became a separate database. Comprises \"many different regimental history records including Discharge Books, Courts Martial Book, Decorations and Rewards and Officers' Statements of Services\". Also includes post WW1 enlistment registers.[28]. More records were added c 27 Jan. 2023 \"covering honours, casualties, attestations and more\".\n\nBritish Army, Coldstream Guards 1800-1947 Image Browse[29] located in Armed Forces & Conflict/Regimental & Service Records, introduced 23 April 2021.\n\nBritish Army Officers' Widows' Pension Forms 1755-1908,[30] located in Armed Forces & Conflict/Regimental & Service Records. These records are from the National Archives series WO 42: War Office: Officers’ Birth Certificates, Wills and Personal Papers, containing applications for a pension or a child’s compassionate allowance where an officer died on service or on half pay. Note, this record series may be downloaded free through TNA website.\n\nBritish Army Pensioners - Royal Hospital Kilmainham, Ireland, 1783-1822,[31] located in Armed Forces & Conflict/Regimental & Service Records. These records are from the National Archives WO 119 records.\n\nSurrey Recruitment Registers 1908-1933,[32] located in Armed Forces & Conflict/Regimental & Service Records. Transcripts of original records from The Surrey History Centre.\n\nBritish Army, Royal Engineers 1900-1949[33] located in Armed Forces & Conflict/Regimental & Service Records. These records are Tracer cards which plot a soldier’s movements within and between regiments and most are for the years 1939-1945.\n\nBritish Army, Royal Engineers Other Ranks: Casualty Cards[34] located in Armed Forces & Conflict/Regimental & Service Records. These cards cover casualties during and after World War 2. An example card shows hospital admissions. Elsewhere Casualty records may list those missing, wounded, taken prisoner, killed in action or who died, but it is not clear whether these events are included on these cards.\n\nBritish Army, Honourable Artillery Company[35] located in Armed Forces & Conflict/Regimental & Service Records.\n\nAlso \"British Army, Honourable Artillery Company, Cardew-Rendle Roll Of Members 1537-1908\" [36] and \"British Army, Honourable Artillery Company Journal 1923-2021\".\n\nSearching the records is free, but charges apply to view the records, although they can be viewed for free at TNA (and other institutions with a FMP subscription).\n\nFor some findmypast blogs about these records, see below.[37]\n\nFamilySearch includes two collections of index records, with the data created by findmypast:\n\nUnited Kingdom, Chelsea Pensioners' Service Records, 1760-1913. The database description states that it includes index records from WO 97, WO 119, WO 121, WO 122, WO 131, but the associated browse images linked from the webpage appear to be for WO97 only. The index records include name, place of birth and estimated date of birth.\n\nUnited Kingdom, Royal Hospital Chelsea: Discharge Documents of Pensioners 1760-1887 (WO 122). Note that the latter title is inaccurate, as WO 122 records are for the period 1816-1817 only. The index records include name, birth and place, and date of discharge.\n\nTo view related images, you can search on findmypast, and view the images on findmypast. This will be the most convenient option for most people. Alternatively you can access the images as digitised microfilm at a FamilySearch Family History Centre, see FamilySearch Centres.\n\nThese record images are also available through the FamilySearch catalogue, where the individual digitised microfilms may be described: United Kingdom, Chelsea pensioners' service records, 1760-1913 [WO 97]; United Kingdom, Royal Hospital Chelsea: discharge documents of pensioners 1760-1887 (WO 122) and in addition WO 119, WO 121, WO 131 records; Probably WO 119, although not stated). From these catalogue entries, it is clear that the FamilySearch databases of Index records cover less records than the digital microfilms available through the FamilySearch catalogue. Note however, the digitised microfilms may be selected records only from the particular record series, not the entire National Archives record series.\n\nFamilySearch also contains the collection United Kingdom, World War I service records, 1914-1920 consisting of WO 363 and WO 364 index records and images. These images are now available on your home computer (since c 2019/03; previously only viewable at a FamilySearch Centre or Affiliate Library). A researcher commented that an image of interest for a 'burnt document' record from WO 363 was clearer, and more of the record could be read, on FamilySearch than on Ancestry (see item below).\n\nAncestry\n\nAncestry is a pay website.\n\nBritish Army WWI Service Records, 1914-1920 are WO 363 records.\n\nBritish Army WWI Pension Records 1914-1920 are WO 364 records.\n\n\"UK, Royal Hospital Chelsea Returns of Payment of Army and Other Pensions, 1842-1883\" from the National Archives series WO 22 (described further below), added 10 July 2023. Also available on Findmypast.\n\n\"Canada, British Regimental Registers of Service, 1756-1900\". Selected regiments only, from the National Archives series WO 25 War Office Registers. See Miscellaneous online sources below, for more about these records. WO 25 records are also available as a free download from The National Archives website, refer below.\n\nAncestry search tip: if you are unable to locate a record, it is possible to search by spouse name, as the search does look for next of kin.[38]\n\nAncestry/Fold3\n\nFold3 is an Ancestry owned company. For the following Military records Ancestry has released transcribed index records on the main Ancestry site, with the images only available on Fold3, which requires an Ancestry All Access subscription, or a separate Fold3 subscription.\n\nUK, Officer Service Records, 1764-1932 These records are WO 76: War Office: Records of Officers' Services.

[2] WO 97 images are also available on findmypast, refer above. Ancestry titles appear inaccurate in regarding dates. [3] The National Archives classifies WO 97 records to 1913, not beyond. [4] The WO 116 records available on Ancestry may possibly be derived from the National Archives microfilms, which do not extend past 1882, or 1893, depending on category, which are available as free downloads from the National Archives website, refer below. [4] WO 119 records are catalogued by the National Archives as \"1757-1849\".\n\nUK, Household Cavalry Records of Service, 1799-1920 WO 400 records. Released 19 March 2020. Surviving records of service for non-commissioned officers and other ranks who served in the Life Guards, the Royal Horse Guards and the Household Battalion, and whose Army service concluded in these regiments. WO 400 images are also available on findmypast, refer above.\n\nFold3\n\nFold3: All Databases.\n\nOne of the databases is titled \"UK, Royal Hospital Chelsea Pensioner Admission And Discharge Records\" with constituent records [1] Royal Hospital, Chelsea: Disability and Royal Artillery Out-Pensions. This record set only contains one piece. [2] \"WO 116: Disability and Out-Pensions, Admissions\", whose index records are available on Ancestry, refer above. Records to piece 165 (TNA last record WO 116/252); [3] 'WO 117: Length of Service Pensions, Admission Books. Records to piece 77 ; [4] WO 121: Discharge Documents of Pensioners. Records to piece 257; [5] WO 122: Discharge Documents, Foreigners' Regiments\" Records to piece 14. The latter record series do not appear to be indexed on Ancestry. Note, not all pieces may be included.\n\nThe fold3 database \"Ireland, Royal Hospital Kilmainham Pensioner Discharge Documents\" in addition to the WO 119 records indexed by Ancestry, also includes the database \"Royal Hospital, Kilmainham: Pension Admissions\", thought to be from WO 118.\n\nNote: WO 117 records are available as a free download from the National Archives website, refer below, and at least some WO 119, WO 121 and WO122 records are available on findmypast, refer above.\n\nFold3 contains a category Military Books (In the Search use the search term \"Military Books\", which contains many online Naval & Military Press reprint books relating to both the British Army and the Indian Army. There are also additional titles in the War categories catalogued under the actual title, and a category Australia Military Book Collection, which covers varying periods periods, which appear to be original scans from \"Gould Genealogy and History\"/\"Australian and States Military Collection\").\n\nFold3, an American company, generally provides free access for a limited number of days during the year, as an example 2019-2021 for a few days before and including \"Memorial Day\", a federal holiday in USA, the last Monday of May. (2021 free access for WW1 and WW2 records, and \"Military Books\" appears to have extended from c am Friday ET (Eastern Time) (being UTC−05:00; UTC = Greenwich Mean Time) to 11.59 pm ET Monday). 2020 free access for British records, including online books due to VE Day 8 May, with probable free dates 4-10 May (Monday-Sunday). However c October 2020 due to website changes, it is not clear whether Military Books are still considered British records.\n\nUpdate. Following the 2021 purchase by Ancestry of the pay website Forces War Records, it appears that many/all? of the non-american records from Fold3 also now are available on Forces War Records, probably released late March 2023. From the Home page, scroll to the bottom of the page and select Browse Records. Then scroll down the list of datasets to the required record set, including \"Military Books\", as available on Fold3, but possibly a smaller database. Forces War Records also includes a free dataset \"Historical Documents Library\", which however requires registration to view the books etc in it.\n\nChelsea Pensioners\n\nDischarge papers (WO 97, (to 1913)), usually containing service/attestation information, and pension records (WO 22) may also be found at TNA. Records in WO 97 are usually only for men discharged with a pension (i.e. for long service or having been invalided [39]) as these were the papers sent to the Royal Hospital Chelsea and preserved, but from 1883, most causes of discharge, (apart from death (with a few exceptions)[40]) were included. Note however, the survival rate of discharge papers appears to be low for men discharged overseas[41] [ie not in Britain, and therefore low for India]. If a man went on to serve during World War 1 then his records would normally have been removed from WO97 and placed with his WW1 service records[42]. WO 97 records are also unlikely to include men who immediately went on active service with a Militia unit, (whose discharge papers may have been transferred to the Militia unit)[43]. The records often contain a wealth of genealogical information, including birth date and location, physical description, service locations, medical history and medals. Records after 1883[44] usually contain fuller particulars, such as next of kin and details of marriages, births of children or deaths of family members. Note: There are examples of records to 1913, which are located in the WW1 records, rather than in the WO 97 records, even though the man did not serve in WW1.\n\nFor the period 1760-1854 (WO 97/1-1271) a name index has been produced, which may be Searched on the National Archives website. The webpage also advises for the period 1760-1872 the documents are arranged alphabetically by name within regiment.\n\nFor details of FamilySearch indexes and digitised microfilms for WO97 records, see above under Findmypast.\n\nOther service records\n\nWO 25 War Office and predecessors Registers With a Search. Click on “browse by … reference” for the various records. Includes some records of service, embarkation, disembarkation information etc. Download some, but not all, records for free through the record references in the National Archives Discovery catalogue.\n\nNote a selection of WO 25 records is available on Ancestry, (pay website), in the dataset \"Canada, British Regimental Registers of Service, 1756-1900\"\n\nFamilySearch has a selection of WO 25 indexed records, (free), see FamilySearch catalogue entry where the magnifying glass icon indicates the records which have been indexed and are now searchable - click further near the red text. These appear to be mainly pre 1850 records. The digitised microfilms, (which are only a selection of WO 25 records, in the range WO 25/266 to WO 25/805), including those from which the index records are derived, are available to members of the public with restrictions, being viewable at FS Centres and FS Affiliate Libraries, see FamilySearch Centres.\n\nKilmainham Pensioners\n\nThe records online at findmypast now include those men discharged through the Kilmainham Hospital in Ireland, as \"British Army Pensioners - Kilmainham, Ireland 1783-1822\". These records are held under TNA reference WO 119, and are similar to the Chelsea Pensioner records WO 97, above.\n\nThere are other records for Kilmainham , not digitised by findmypast, under WO 118 “Registers of in- and out- pensioners of the Royal Hospital Kilmainham”. In-pensioners were admitted until 1922.\n\nThese two record series may be searched by name on the National Archives website: WO 118 Search, WO 119 Search\n\nFamilySearch has digitised microfilms for these records, with catalogue entries:\n\nRegisters of out-pensioners of the Army and of the Militia, 1759-1863 (W. O. 118) This appears to be a selection of WO 118 records, not the complete series.\n\nFor WO 119, see above under Findmypast.\n\nThese digitised microfilms are viewable at FamilySearch Centres. In addition the WO 118 records may be viewed at a Family Search Affiliate Library.\n\nOther Pension Records\n\nAnother useful TNA source is the now available online WO 22 subseries \"Army and other pensions paid out locally in India, Ceylon and China\" detailing names and payments made, including WO 22/228-230 Bengal, WO 22/237-238 Bombay and WO 22/266-270, mainly Madras.\n\nWO 120 and WO 121 records may be helpful.[45] Catalogue references are:\n\nWO 120 \"From about 1812 dates of death have been noted and in the last series these dates extend to 1877\" The WO 120 records do not appear to be available online but are available on FamilySearch digitised microfilm, catalogue entry. See FamilySearch Centres for details.\n\nThe book British Army Pensioners Abroad, 1772-1899 by Norman K. Crowder includes all British Army pensioners who retired to any place outside of Great Britain for which records are available (1772-1899). There are 8,934 entries, transcribed from WO 120/35 and WO 120/69-70. Each entry has one line, in the form \"51st Regiment of Foot; Josh ABBOTT; pension awarded 27 Sept 1842; residence - Hobart Town, Australia; died 22 Apr 1871. Source WO120 Volume 69 page 206\".[46] Available at the British Library UIN: BLL01008881220, including open access shelves. A \"transcription of those entries with relevance or reference to India\" of 1135 records may be found on the FIBIS database.\n\nWO 121 records. These records are available online on findmypast , refer above. The records include \"Register of men discharged without pension\", 1884 to 1887. Although the catalogue does not mention this, there are many records of men leaving the army in India under the heading \"Nominal list of men discharged by the Commander-in-Chief in India.\" As the register provides name, regimental number, rank, corps, date and cause of discharge, attestation date (and a few other administration details) it is an invaluable resource for those not able to find these details elsewhere.\n\nThese records are included in the National Archives catalogue entry Records of the Royal Chelsea and Kilmainham Hospitals. The latter hospital was in Ireland. This category of records also includes\n\nWO 116 Disability and all Royal Artillery pensions and\n\nWO 117 Pensions awarded to soldiers for length of service.\n\nSome of these records, in particular WO 116 (for what appears to be WO 116/1-165 being Cavalry and Infantry Disability October 1715 to 1882 (when the records cease) and Royal Artillery 1 November 1833 to 1893) (when the records continue but are not digitised) and WO 117 ( October 1823 to 1913) are available to download free of cost from the National Archives website, though the Discovery catalogue, or the links above. Note, some records within this series have been seen subject to a fee, if so it is suggested you query.\n\nElsewhere, it is stated these are large pdfs, which need a broadband internet connection. An Ancestry.com British Army Message Board post[47] details some of the information found.\n\nAn interesting series of selected records is PIN 71: Selected War Pensions Award Files for Service Prior to 1914. This series consists of personal case files on disablement pensions arising from service in the Army or Navy before the First World War and case files concerning widows of such servicemen. The files contain medical records and details of place of birth, age, names of parents and siblings, religion, physical attributes, marital and parental status. The series appears to consist of approximately 6,300 individual files which are searchable by name online on the Discovery catalogue. The actual files however are not available online.\n\nService and pension records from World War 1 from the National Archives are available on the pay sites findmypast and Ancestry, refer above. They do contain some papers for men who did not serve in WW1,[48] so it is suggested you check these records for men with service prior to the War years. The World War 1 records include\n\nWO 363 records also known as the ‘Burnt Documents.’ These are the records which survived a fire, about one third of the total documents.\n\nWO 364 records\n\nPIN 82, The National Archives record series from the Ministry of Pensions available on Findmypast in the database \"British Armed Forces, First World War Widows' Pension Forms\", located in Military, Armed Forces & Conflict/First World War. These are only a sample of the original forms, less than 2% of the original records. The rest of the collection was destroyed. Includes pension records for soldiers who died up to 1925.\n\nMuster rolls\n\nUnlike those of the presidency armies, muster rolls for British Army regiments stationed in India are not at the British Library but are instead at The National Archives at Kew in London.\n\nRefer National Archives Guides, below, in particular the linked webinar \"Army Musters\".\n\nThe majority of the Muster records up to 1878 are in WO 12, including Cavalry and Infantry, with Royal Artillery muster records in WO 10. The catalogue describes the records as:\n\n\"...a comprehensive means of establishing dates of enlistment, movements throughout the world, and of discharge or death. The first entry may show age on enlistment. An entry on the form \"Men becoming non-effective\", sometimes to be found at the end of each quarter's musters, shows the birthplace, trade, and date of enlistment of any soldier discharged or dead during the quarter. From about 1868, at the end of each muster, may be found a Marriage Roll, which enumerates wives and children for whom married quarters were provided.\"\n\nAn 1877 example of data from a Marriage Roll can be seen in the image on the right.\n\nFrom 1878 to 1898, all muster rolls are in WO 16. The majority of the records for the years 1878 to 1888 contain detailed pay lists with names. From 1888 onwards (WO 16/2917-3049) the series consists of company muster rolls only, and these do not contain pay lists. From about 1890, the muster rolls generally are only for men at Depots, and recruits, and do not generally include Battalions overseas.[49]\n\nThe Muster Rolls for the 63rd Regiment of Foot in the period 1819-1840 are known to contain Officers names[50], but generally the rolls are of enlisted men.\n\nMuster roll records are unfortunately NOT available on LDS microfilms. If you are a FIBIS member and are unable to visit Kew, the FIBIS Research team should be able to assist.\n\nPlease note that muster roll records may be missing for some Regiments and periods, in India and generally. For example, there are virtually no muster roll records for the Royal Artillery in India.\n\nOnline records\n\nAncestry (pay site with a free search) includes the collections\n\nUK, British Army Muster Books and Pay Lists, 1812-1817. In addition there are some rolls outside this date range, from 1779 and also up to 1821. Comprises selected WO 12 muster books and pay lists of the Cavalry, Foot Guards and regular infantry regiments of the line. Also included are special regiments or corps, colonial troops, various foreign legions and troops, garrison battalions, veteran battalions and depots.\n\nSurrey, England, Regimental Rolls and Recruitment Registers, 1914-1947 from records at the Surrey History Centre, consisting of records from the Queen's Royal West Surrey and East Surrey Regiments, together with some from 21st-24th Battalions, the London Regiment.

These were separate from the British Army, instead consisting of regiments formed by the East India Company and under their control. Many men from those Armies then transferred to the British Army, so if you have a reference to a man in the British Army in India in the 1860s, he may well be one of those who transferred. You may be able to locate him in the records of one of the Presidency Armies, which are to be found at the British Library, see Presidency Armies for an overview, and Bengal Army, Madras Army, or Bombay Army for details.\n\nEcclesiastical returns\n\nIf the man married, had children or died out on the Sub-continent then records of these occurences can often be found in the India Office Church records. However, some regimental chaplains only filed their BMDs with the General Register Office in London. The British Army Overseas Indexes can be found in genealogical libraries, the National Archives and searched on various websites including findmypast.com and familyrelatives.com. Certificates of these army returns can then be obtained from the GRO by ordering them online. For more details refer Chaplains Returns.\n\nNote that if a record is available both in the Church records and in the General Register Office records, the latter may contain more information, at least for some time periods. By way of example, in 1903 the additional information available for a marriage record was the nationalities of the groom and bride, and the occupations of the fathers of the groom and bride.\n\nCemetery records\n\nSee Cemeteries including details about Commonwealth War Graves Commission records.\n\nCourts martial and desertion\n\nSee Courts-martial\n\nOther sources\n\nAdditional sources include:\n\nSoldiers’ wills\n\nOnline search Find a soldier's will Search for the will of a soldier who died while serving in the British armed forces between 1850 and 1986.

They do not include officers. These wills date from the Crimea period onwards, and appear to be wills completed by soldiers in their paybooks. It appears the majority are from WW1. The article \"Wills of English soldiers killed in the Great War\" by David Tattersfield 25 September 2013 (“The Western Front Association”, now an archived webpage) has more details.\n\nUpdate. What appears to be the same database of Index records only in respect of privates and non-commissioned officers, is now available on the pay website Findmypast,[59] added c 20 November 2020, at which time located in Civil Deaths & Burials/Birth, Marriage, Death & Parish Records.

The National Archives of Ireland holds over 9,000 wills of enlisted and non-commissioned soldiers domiciled in Ireland, from the thirty-two counties of Ireland, who fought in the British Army in the World War I and in the South African war of 1899-1902. The collection does not include wills of commissioned officers.\n\nSoldiers’ effects records at the National Army Museum\n\nThese records relate to monies paid to the named relatives of deceased soldiers and those discharged insane. The records include officers. They do not give details of the personal possessions of dead personnel, but provide next of kin details. Transcripts of records between 1901 and 1960 are available, at a charge. They are not viewable at the Museum as they are stored off site.[60] Further details are provided in an archived National Army Museum link\n\nUpdate January 2015. Some of these records are now available on the pay website Ancestry, record category Military, with the dataset titled UK, Army Registers of Soldiers' Effects, 1901-1929.[61] For entries involving the India and Mesopotamia theatres in WW1, there will generally be two separate records for each death.[62]\n\nWW1 pension records\n\nWFA WW1 pension record cards\n\n\"The Western Front Association preserves a major Great War archive of 6.5 million records\" by David G Henderson 08 November 2012, now an archived webpage. \"Great War Pension Record Cards and Ledgers: deeper understanding\" 31 March 2013, now an archived webpage.

They were then published weekly by HMSO, as War Office Weekly Casualty List no.1-48 (7 Aug.1917 - 2 July 1918), and later as Weekly Casualty List (War Office & Air Ministry) no.49-83 (9 July 1918 - 4 March 1919), available at some libraries.\n\nDaily lists may be found in online newspaper databases such as The [London] Times Digital Archive, for access see Miscellaneous tips, and The Scotsman in Scotland, the latter initially all casualties but later limited to Scots related. TheGenealogist, a pay website, as part of its Diamond premium subscription, includes a database \"Military and Casualty Lists\"[67], which appears to consist of Daily Lists transcribed from newspapers, together with Weekly Lists transcribed and with images, from British Library held original publications,[68] with data to April 1918,[69] (Weekly List No. 36 April 9th 1918[70]) but with some gaps in the data, and Officers seem to be listed to 1920.[71] Added July 2017, with later 1919 additions, findmypast and the British Newspaper Archive[72], under Weekly Casualty List (War Office & Air Ministry) contain Lists from 7 Aug. 1917 to 4 Mar. 1919 (currently (2019/01/06) missing publications between 1 Jan. and 23 Apr. 1918), and not all editions may be complete.[73] These websites may also contain newspapers with Daily Lists. On findmypast, the Weekly Lists may be located either in the category Newspapers and periodicals, or in the category Armed Forces & Conflict/First World War in the databases \"British Army, First World War Casualty Lists\", and the related Browse database,[74]which have different viewing formats, the latter much easier to view/browse than the Newspapers format. Note, however, the Armed Forces category does not contain any 1919 publications.\n\nUpdate 17 July 2019, National Library of Scotland released a free database of all weekly Casualty Lists,[75] except one, and currently (2021/09/28) the NLS database is still missing List No. 63, 15 October 1918. Note, some missing names were noted in the NLS pages, due to cropping at the margins during the filming (an example[75]), so it is worthwhile trying different sources of databases for comparison if you cannot find a name of interest.\n\nWeekly Casualty List No. 78, January 28th, 1919 is known to contain names of \"Released Prisoners of War from Germany, arrived in England\".[76] It is possible that names of released POWs are similarly contained in other editions, particularly those issued after 11 December 1918.\n\nNote, online searching may be unsuccessful due to the underlying poor quality OCR text caused by the tiny font used in the original lists.[73]\n\nNote, the above Casualty Lists include British personnel serving in the Indian Army.[77]\n\nWW1 British Red Cross & Order Of St John Enquiry Lists For Wounded And Missing\n\nNaval & Military Press has published a number of facsimile reprints, in total 14 (9 for 1915, 2 for 1916, 1 for 1917, 2 for 1918)[78] catalogued as British Red Cross & Order Of St John Enquiry List For Wounded And Missing, however the titles on the book covers do not contain the word for. N&MP states the originals are held by the Department of Printed Books, The Imperial War Museum, “who hold the largest collection of these titles known to exist”. The IWM catalogue reference is \"Enquiry list... : wounded and missing\", part of Books, First World War, catalogue number LBY S. 6/767, and the holding details are 1915 (July-September), 1916 (February, September), 1917 (up to and including July 20th 1917, reprint), 1918 (October, December). Note: the IWM catalogue, when re-searching, often did not locate the item. In addition, elsewhere[79] it is advised that a publication available at IWM catalogued as The British Red Cross Society. Summary of Work for the week ending… includes a “report by the Enquiry Department for Wounded and Missing”, which possibly may include a List of names. These reports are catalogued by IWM as LBY BRCS B69- LBY BRCS B76 1914- 21 Oct.-4, 11, 24 Nov.-1, 5, 12, 19 Dec; LBY BRCS B77- LBY BRCS B87 1915- 2, 9, 16, 23 Jan.-6, 13, 20, 27 Feb.-6, 13, 27 Mar.; LBY BRCS B88- LBY BRCS B97 1915- 10, 17 Apr.-1, 8, 15, 29 May-5, 12, 19, 26 June; LBY BRCS B98- LBY BRCS B103 1915-3, 10, 17, 24? July-7, 21 Aug. LBY BRCS B104 Summaries of Work 11 September 1915 - March 1919. It is possible there may be additional IWM catalogue entries.\n\nThe Red Cross Archive in London is stated to hold additional lists to those reprinted by Naval and Military Press,[80] but details could not be located in the Red Cross Archive online catalogue, so it is unclear under what title they are catalogued. The British Library catalogue details one list Enquiry List, No. 21, 1918. Wounded and missing... up to November 20th, 1918 (UIN: BLL01001129921). The Australian War Memorial Library holds copies, probably four, catalogued as Enquiry list : wounded and missing by British Red Cross and Order of St. John. (More details of these records.[81][80]). The reprints are available at The National Archives Library.\n\nFold3, an Ancestry related pay website has a database \"British WWI Wounded And Missing\", which is stated to be sourced from the Naval & Military Press, but which reprint(s) is/are included is not stated, or otherwise known. (Total records 158,041). The records are stated to be a \"List of wounded and missing British, Australian, Canadian, South African personnel in all theatres of war about whom enquiries have been made\". Forces War Records, a pay website, contains a database consisting of the 1 August 1917 List (List No. 14, 1917).\n\nUpdate, c 20 November 2020. Findmypast, a pay website, has added a database (seemingly almost identical to that on Fold3), \"British Red Cross...\" [82] located in Military, Armed Forces & Conflict/First World War, total records 158,035.\n\nThe data may possibly include regimental details not generally available elsewhere, such as Battery number for Royal Artillery soldiers, and Company details for Infantry soldiers.\n\nPrisoners of War\n\nICRC Archives\n\nPrisoners of the First World War - ICRC Archives, including Glossary of abbreviations and acronyms in the lists. Free online records of the International Committee of the Red Cross, primarily from the Western, Romanian and Serbian Fronts, but does not include records from the Russian Front. These records may be quite complex to search, and there are many helpful hints about searching on the Great War Forum.[83] There is also some information on the Long, Long Trail website - \"Records of British prisoners of war 1914-1918\" and \"Making the most of the Red Cross prisoner of war records\"[84]. The records include soldiers of the Indian Army taken as POWs on the Western Front and sent to Germany.\n\nFrom 24 May 2019, some of the records (details unknown) are available on findmypast, see next section.\n\nForces War Records, a pay website, includes a transcribed database WWI Prisoner of War Records based on ICRC records of British soldiers. However, there is no information about the number of transcribed records available.\n\nReports by ICRC about Prisoner of War Camps, WW1 French language. ICRC on scribd.com. Also available through the ICRC website, click on individual camps in list of camps.\n\nICRC Archives in Geneva has records for the Second World War. There is a quarterly \"quota\" for enquires, due to staff numbers but if the quota has been exceeded, you can apply at the beginning of the next quarter. Details are linked from the page Researching victims of conflict. It appears that the demand for this service is very great, and elsewhere it was stated that as the quota may be filled within two hours of opening, it was suggested to check from 7am UK time on the day the quota opens.\n\nOther\n\nFindmypast includes a database \"Prisoners Of War 1715-1945\" and also a similar \"Browse\" database (both located in Armed forces & conflict/Regimental & service records) which contains records from The National Archives , including selected FO 383 records, including some for Indian Army soldiers. The records included are detailed in this Findmypast link which indicates there is also a category \"Transcript only material\". However, records added subsequently, such as the ICRC records next mentioned, although included in this database, do not appear to have been included in the description of the database.\n\nUpdate 24 May 2019. A group of records from First World War ICRC records (see above) has been added to Findmypast, although exact details were not provided.[85] It appears possible to search by regiment, which isn't possible in the original ICRC records. Some names have been transcribed incorrectly. As the original records were mainly typed, it has been suggested that inaccurate transcription may be due to automatic transcription by OCR (optical character recognition).\n\nHelpful hints about searching in this Findmypast dataset. [86]\n\nAncestry (pay website) contains the database \"UK, British Officer Prisoners of War, 1914-1918\"[87] (located in category Military) consisting of data transcribed from the 1919 publication List of British Officers Taken Prisoner in the Various Theatres of War Aug 1914 to Nov 1918 [88], compiled from records kept by Messrs Cox & Co.'s Enquiry Office. Transcribed records from this source are also available in the findmypast database above \"Prisoners Of War 1715-1945\", (sub category \"Transcript only material\"). Some sample pages from this publication for the Western Theatre of operations are available ww1photos.com\n\nAlso see WW1 Casualty Lists, above.\n\nCensuses\n\n1911 England and Wales Census\n\nBritish Army personnel in India, together with their families appeared for the first time in an England and Wales Census in 1911. The 1911 Census is available on the pay websites findmypast, Ancestry and perhaps other pay sites. This National Archives catalogue entry shows the regiments that were included in the 1911 Census. The items (17 in total) are RG 14/34978-34992, 34995, 34997. However, it is probable there were other regiments in India at this time. The census was taken on the night of Sunday 2 April, 1911. Note however, there are is at least one known instance of a soldier and his family known to be in the British Army in India at the time of the census, whose names do not appeat in the census, another indication that the data may not be complete. The 1911 Census also includes similar information for other British Army overseas bases, and returns from ships of the Royal Navy at sea and in ports in England, Wales, Ireland but not Scotland, and abroad. For ships at sea on the census date, the next port of call determined into which category the records were placed.\n\nFor those with access to Ancestry, for a helpful finding aid to locate regimental information, consisting of all overseas including India, and in addition England, Wales and Ireland, but not Scotland, see Stations of British Army troops in India - 1911 England and Wales Census. Also includes Royal Navy, overseas and England, Wales and Ireland, but not Scotland.\n\nThe Ancestry owned pay websites fold3/Forces War Records include a specific database \"UK, Worldwide Army Census, 1911\" introduced 7 June 2023, being transcriptions from the Census data.\n\n1911 Scotland Census\n\nIn Scotland, the Census was also taken on the night of Sunday 2 April 1911 and records are available online on the pay website ScotlandsPeople. There is a separate registration district called Shipping - Royal Navy.[89] Records for previous censuses in Scotland are available on findmypast, Ancestry, etc.\n\n1911 and 1901 Ireland Census\n\nCensus of Ireland 1901/1911 The National Archives of Ireland. Free online records. The 1901 census was taken on 31st March 1901 and the 1911 census was taken on 2 April 1911.

At release date 6 January 2022, and for an extended period up to three years, Findmypast has exclusive rights. The overseas coverage is similar to the 1911 census, and also includes RAF bases overseas, including British military personnel in Ireland, plus the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands.[90]\n\n1921 Scotland Census\n\nThe census in Scotland, recorded on the night of 19 June 1921, was released on ScotlandsPeople (pay website) 30 November 2022. Includes military personnel.\n\nCensus returns Guide. scotlandspeople.gov.uk. Search indexes free of charge and use pay-per-view to view.\n\n1921 Ireland\n\nThere was no census in Ireland in 1921. Censuses in Ireland and Northern Ireland were conducted in 1926. However, members of the British military (British Army, Royal Air Force and Royal Navy), together with H.M. Coastguard Service, across Ireland appear in the 1921 England and Wales Census, part of the category British armed forces overseas.\n\n1939 England and Wales Register\n\nThe survey taken on 29th September 1939 was for civilians only, and does not include service personnel who were either in army, naval and air force establishments on the 29th September, or even members of the forces who were resident or visiting their own home at the time.[91]\n\nNational Army Museum\n\nThe National Army Museum's previous website included the following Information Sheets (archived versions shown) which also refer to sources at other institutions.\n\nInformation Sheet No 2: Soldiers’ Records 1660-1913\n\nInformation Sheet No 3: Soldiers’ Records 1914-c1920\n\nInformation Sheet No 4: Soldiers’ Records 1920–present\n\nInformation Sheet No 5: Researching Family History at the National Army Museum\n\nAbsent Voters Lists(UK): 1918- c 1923, a few later\n\nGenerally arranged by Electoral District. Mainly contain military personnel, but also men and women who were engaged in war-related work who were still living away from home. Sources are major libraries and record offices nearest to the place in question. Some of these records are available online. The London Metropolitan Archives holds some AVLs to 1939.[92], however it appears that information such as a serviceman’s rank, unit and number, only appeared initially for a few years.[93] Note however these lists appear to have contained some errors when first compiled.[94]\n\nAbsent Voter Lists. Guide by Manchester & Lancashire Family History Society. May 2015\n\nFinding soldiers through the 1918 Absent Voters Lists longlongtrail.co.uk\n\nIn October 2015, findmypast introduced a database \"Britain, Absent Voters Lists 1918-1921\" (located in Census, Land & Surveys/Electoral Rolls), based on records from the British Library. The coverage is set out in Britain, Absent Voters Constituency List. Data additional to the initial release is expected to be added. (Guide to BL holdings[95]). There is also a stand alone \"Kent, Bromley Absent Voters List 1918\". In July 2016 an associated dataset \"Britain, Absent Voters Lists 1918-1921 Browse\" was introduced to enable browsing through the records. Additionally there appear to be some Absent Voters Lists within the findmypast database “England & Wales, Electoral Registers 1832-1932” (located in Census, Land & Surveys/Electoral Rolls) as a researcher here found a 1931 AVL record which showed a soldier’s unit and number.[96] 2018/09/14 a separate database \"England & Wales, Electoral Registers 1920-1932\" was introduced, expanded to \"1910-1932\" (from 2021/09/24) stated by findmypast able to be searched with greater accuracy.\n\nIn November 2017, Ancestry introduced a database \"UK, Absent Voter Lists, 1918-1925, 1939\"[97] located in Census & Electoral Rolls, and also in Military/Soldier, Veteran & Prisoner Rolls & Lists, the source being “Absent Voter Lists taken from various Electoral Register collections”, but otherwise unspecified. To see the coverage, look under “Browse this collection” on the Ancestry webpage for the collection. Includes some areas of England and Scotland. It is believed the London records are from the London Metropolitan Archives. There is an additional Ancestry database “Midlands, England, Electoral Registers, 1832-1955” (located in Census & Electoral Rolls) which specifically includes AVLs (Birmingham and some of north Warwickshire). Other Electoral Registers, details of which may be found by entering the keyword electoral in the Card Catalogue Search, (accessible from the Search tab at the top of Ancestry webpages) perhaps may also contain unspecified AVLs.\n\nOther online Lists, additional to those mentioned in the guides above: Glasgow 1920 glasgowfamilyhistory.org.uk; FamilySearch images for Swansea West Division (Wales, West Glamorgan).\n\nDetails of some AVLs for Wales,[98] (not online).\n\nAttestation, or Enlistment books (Army Book 358) from 1920\n\nFollowing the restructure of the Army in 1920, new Attestation, or Enlistment books (Army Book 358) were introduced, the originals of which were sent to various Regimental Museums in the early 2000s [99] Some of these records are now in regional Record Offices and Archives. The National Army Museum holds these records for some regiments, including the five Irish Regiments disbanded in 1922 - the latter may be Searched online, and images viewed, on the NAM website for free (released online c 2016/9). The index records from the NAM also are in a findmypast dataset \"British Army, Irish Regimental Enlistment Registers 1877-1924\", (released 2017/11) but the images are only on the NAM website.\n\nThe enlistment records for the Royal Artillery and the Tank Corps[100]are available from 1919 online on the pay website Findmypast, located in the category Armed forces & conflict/Regimental & service records.

For details, see External links, below. These new numbers will be found in the enlistment book records.\n\nRegimental histories\n\nRegimental histories which have been published, may be found in many libraries, including the British Library, the National Army Museum, the Imperial War Museums, Oxford University Library, the Prince Consort's Library and libraries of Regimental Museums and Archives.\n\nBibliographies\n\nA Bibliography of Regimental Histories of the British Army compiled by Arthur S.

See Findmypast.\n\nAncestry Card Catalogue of all Record Databases (located as an option under the Search tab). Select the Military filter on the left hand side of the page. Some datasets may unexpectedly provide information relating to India. A researcher, who found some relevant records, found the title of \"Canada, British Regimental Registers of Service, 1756-1900\", to be misleading, as they are actually records of enlistment and any subsequent notable events, based on WO 25 records for a selection of regiments[107]. The databases Include \"UK, British Army Lists, 1882-1962\" (released 2016/10) consisting of a broken range of unspecified Lists, but these are index records only. However images of most of the pages are available on the associated website Fold3.\n\nAlso see Ancestry databases mentioned under Findmypast above (in this section).\n\nAncestry includes databases for Medal Rolls, see Medal Rolls.\n\nAnother database is \"UK, Naval and Military Courts Martial Registers, 1806-1930\", index records only with images on Fold3 under the title UK, Courts Martial Registers.\n\nForces War Records, a pay website, (owned by Ancestry since c May 2021) includes the database \"Military Hospitals Admissions and Discharge Registers WW1 Collection\",[108]consisting of transcriptions taken from TNA records MH 106: War Office: First World War Representative Medical Records of Servicemen. It is possible that the FWR database is only a selection of records from MH 106, which in turn is only a sample.[109]. Images from this record series are available on Findmypast, refer above, which also appears to have more records (as at 2018/12/23).\n\nPreviously The Museum of Army Chaplaincy contained an online Search facility for Chaplain Interview Record cards for Anglican (Church of England) clergy who applied to become Temporary Chaplains to the Forces (T.C.F.) between late October 1914 and November 1918. Now known as the Royal Army Chaplains’ Museum, with a new website, this feature is not currently available (at 12 November 2023) but perhaps may return.\n\nArmy personnel serving after January 1921\n\nThe Army Personnel Centre Historical Disclosures Section holds Army Service records for officers whose service ended after April 1922 and soldiers whose service ended after January 1921. (Note, some documentation has been seen which gives the holding from April 1922, and from January 1921, respectively.)\n\nUpdate: 2018, May. Foot Guards Regiments service records are a separate category and all, (including pre 1921 records), were moved from regimental archives to the Ministry of Defence, August 2017-May 2018, except for Scots Guards service records, which remain in the regimental archives. (Pre 1921 Scots Guards service records are thought to eventually be going to National Records of Scotland, in Edinburgh).\n\nUpdate: In February 2021, the MOD began transferring 9.7 million military records for individuals with a discharge date before 31 December 1963 to The National Archives, so the records may be accessible there in the future.[110]\n\nUpdate 17 August 2021. The National Archives News release. The records included in this collection cover personnel in all three services, Royal Navy, Army and Royal Air Force, where the individual has a date of birth prior to or up to 1939, and closure will apply until 115 years past the date of birth of the individual. The records will be transferred to Kew in batches over the next 6 years.[111]\n\nUpdate 5 April 2022. The first MOD Service Records are now available, which are Second World War records in the National Archives series WO 420[112], aspects are set out in The MOD Service Records Collection (TNA). Also available WO 421[113] from 22 June 2022, and WO 422 [114] from October 2022.\n\nUpdate 2 March 2023. The National Archives announced on Twitter that the contract to digitise the first tranche of (MOD) service personnel records had been awarded to Ancestry UK. \"Ministry of Defence service records project\" TNA, undated, accessed 24 March 2023, now archived 29 Jul 2023 at webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk. The first record series to be digitised are WO 419-422.\n\nNote however that some records may not have survived, such as some records for those who were awarded a disability pension,[115] or due to 'weeding'.\n\nThe service records of Army personnel serving after these dates remain closed to the public. To obtain details from such records you will often have to prove kinship. Charges may apply. Application forms should be sent to\n\nThe Army Personnel Centre\n\nMS Support Unit, P & D Branch\n\nHistorical Disclosures, MP555\n\nKentigern House,\n\n65 Brown Street, GLASGOW G2 8EX\n\nTelephone 0845 600 9663\n\nEmail disc4@apc.army.mod.uk\n\nSee the web pages: Get a copy of military service records with a link to Requests for personal data and Service records: a detailed guide (gov.uk) for forms to download. Previous fact sheet from Veterans-UK : Army Personnel Records And Family Interest Enquiries UK Government Web Archive.\n\nThe Ministry of Defence has released an aid for the files they hold for service personnel with a birth date prior to 1901, which contains name, date of birth and service number. Numbers with a P prefix are believed to designate officers.[116] The aid is in the form of a letter of advice and eight attachments in MS Excel Spreadsheet format, which may be found in FOI responses released by MOD: week commencing 1 December 2014.\n\nUpdate: 2017, April. This MOD database is now available on Ancestry as UK, Military Discharge Indexes, 1920-1971, although Ancestry only implies the source source. (Located in the Military category, and otherwise appears unclassified. If locating through Ancestry Search, use the card catalogue with search term Discharge). Also available as a free dataset on Forces War Records as Service records index of those who served both in WWI and after 1921.\n\nNote: It appears that this database aid is not 100% accurate, as there is a known instance of a file which the MOD subsequently located, which was not included in the provided database.[117] The release (in January 2022) of the 1921 England and Wales Census has also revealed some discrepancies.\n\nHints, mainly from WW2Talk Forum. Note however, release of record conditions appear to have changed during 2021, and it is unclear just what currently applies.\n\n\"You want to get next of kin FULL records (make a note on the application for FULL records)\"[118]\n\nNote, to receive full records, either 25 years must have elapsed after death, or within 25 years of death, the consent of the immediate next of kin must be been given. Update: It may not be possible to obtain full records (as at 2021/10/19). In July 2021 the MOD advised \"Currently under the MOD Publication Scheme all we are releasing is a copy of the AFB200 & attestation papers (if held). These documents meet all our obligations of disclosure\".[119]. Comments/complaints have been seen about the small number of pages of records received.\n\nGenerally a death certificate is needed (as at 2021/10/19). Previously it was said \"They will accept anything that is proof of death, even a undertakers receipt or a photograph of a post war civilian headstone”. [120], however this may not currently apply. However, you do not have to supply a death certificate when the date of birth of the individual was more than 116 years ago.[121] [122]\n\nThe next of kin hierarchy is explained on a WW2Talk Forum topic which also advises that “There is currently about a 12 month wait to receive the records once you apply”.[123] Currently 2021/05/28 it appears that very few, if any, applications have been processed since Corona Virus restrictions were introduced, so there is a growing backlog of unprocessed applications.\n\nCurrently (2022/04/30) RAF and Royal Navy records may be requested online, using a credit or debit card, but this facility is not available for Army records requests.[122] However, it is understood this facility will become available in the future for Army records.\n\nFor help in interpreting the records, the Ministry of Defence archived webpage, Army Personnel Centre contains a link (on the right hand side of the webpage, towards the top) to a list of Useful Abbreviations.
