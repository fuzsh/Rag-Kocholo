        "text": "The Civil War caused deep divisions within Irish politics and society which continue to reverberate to this day. Notwithstanding those divisions the Irish state would prove itself to be a relatively stable entity remarkably free of political violence. Perhaps because we have lived with this relative stability for so long we do not see how noteworthy it is that a Civil War, which led to approximately 2,000 deaths within less than a year and such deep seated long lasting personal and political divisions, did not in turn result in ongoing violence and instability.\n\nThere are many possible reasons why violence and instability did not become endemic: the continuation of popular representative democracy, the safety valve of emigration and the relative ethnic and religious homogeneity of the new state to name but a few. Also important was the gradual coming to terms of those who had fought on or supported the anti-Treaty with the new State and its institutions. Ironically the actions of the IRA itself in the months and years immediately following the Civil War was one of the factors that allowed a return to normality.\n\nIn a very small way the file of Philip Doyle may illustrate this point. The file relates to an application from his father, Loughlin Doyle for an award under the Army Pensions Acts. This was turned down as Philip Doyle was deemed not to have been killed while engaged in military service.\n\nPhilip Doyle, a member of the IRA, was executed by that organisation on 21 July 1923 for robbery and his involvement in the wounding of a Civic Guard, a Sergeant McNulty, on 10 July 1923. Philip Doyle had served with the IRA during the Civil War and, according to newspaper reports at the time of his shooting, had been arrested and held at Wexford Jail at some point in early 1923 before escaping. References on his file and newspaper reports of the time state that Doyle and another unnamed individual had held up a two man Civic Guard cycling patrol near Kiltealy, County Wexford. When the Civic Guards refused to hand over their bicycles Philip Doyle shot Sergeant McNulty wounding him in the legs.\n\nIt would appear that Philip Doyle was then court-martialled and executed by the IRA. Newspaper reports state that his body was found by the roadside at Ballinlug, County Wexford with a note stating: “Convicted robber: guilty of attack on Civic Guard, wounding sergeant, without authority. Shot by IRA.” According to references given on file from two former IRA Company officers, John Breen and Peter Byrne, Doyle’s killing caused great controversy within the North Wexford Brigade IRA. They both claimed that the second unnamed and unidentified individual, who was with Philip Doyle when Sergeant McNulty was shot, was also an IRA member and had been shown much greater leniency. Peter Byrne stated that the other unnamed IRA member “…might have been more to blame for the occurrence (sic)” while John Breen claimed this individual “…was not asked one question on the matter…” [by the North Wexford IRA leadership].\n\nIt is not surprising that the IRA would want not only to maintain discipline within its ranks but be seen to be doing so at this time. However the severity of the punishment meted out to Philip Doyle is interesting. Obviously the IRA, if it were not to splinter or disintegrate following its defeat in the Civil War, needed to maintain its internal discipline, coherence and morale. Secondly the IRA needed to maintain the still substantial support it had within the general population and to show that it was, as it claimed to be, the army of the Republic and not a rabble or criminal gang as its enemies would prefer to portray it. Thirdly a large number of anti-Treaty abstentionist Republican candidates, including many leading IRA figures, were due to stand in the upcoming August General Election. Any bad publicity linked to the IRA would certainly hinder their electoral prospects. Fourthly violence against the unarmed Civic Guards, agents of the State though they were, had never been seen as acceptable even during the Civil War. The IRA did not and could not be seen to be allowing targeting of the new police force.\n\nHowever at the same time it must be remembered that the IRA Ceasefire and Dump Arms order which brought the Civil War to an end, had only been issued on the previous 24 May. Large numbers of IRA members were still being interned and many would remain in custody until the following year, often enduring very harsh conditions. Indeed in protest, both at their ongoing detention, despite the ceasefire, and the conditions they were enduring, IRA prisoners went on hunger strike in October and November 1923. Meanwhile IRA members not interned or imprisoned remained liable to arrest or capture with many having to remain on the run till the following year. Indeed even after the ceasefire a number of IRA members were killed by National Army forces. For example Michael Radford, was shot by National Army forces on 23 June 1923 near the Cotts, Tacumshane, County Wexford, while trying to evade capture. However others died in much more questionable circumstances. For example Noel Lemass, brother of future Taoiseach Seán Lemass, was abducted and killed in July 1923 while the body of Henry McEntee was found near Ballymun on 3 August 1923 following his arrest by National Forces.\n\nGiven this atmosphere it is very interesting that the IRA in Wexford would decide not just to discipline Philip Doyle but to execute him. Especially, if as John Breen and Peter Byrne claim, it was in the face of much disquiet within the local IRA. There may be other factors that came into play and which are not mentioned on file – a personality clash, Doyle’s previous behaviour, or some other unstated reason for a particular animus towards Doyle from the North Wexford Brigade IRA leadership. It is still an extraordinary example of the ongoing discipline and strength of the IRA’s internal structures that they were able to carry out this sentence.\n\nThis strength and discipline evidenced by the killing of Philip Doyle paradoxically helps to explain, at least partly, why violence did not continue and the Irish Free State was able to stabilise. IRA internal discipline was strong enough to resist what must have been strong pressure to retaliate in the face of ongoing harassment and attack especially during the remainder of 1923. While the IRA and its members would be involved in violence and physical confrontations during the years ahead – most notably the assassination of Kevin O’Higgins in 1927 and clashes with the ‘Blueshirts’ during the 1930s – it would never again be involved in a sustained systematic attack on the State as in 1922 and 1923. It can be argued that this decision to punish by death an attack by one of its members on the Civic Guards was one small part of the process by which the anti-Treaty IRA and its political descendants would eventually come not to just to accept, however reluctantly, the legitimacy of the State but, in the form of Fianna Fáil, to actually govern it.\n\nOn the other side of the Civil War divide the file in the MSPC relating to Cornelius Brosnan’s unsuccessful application for an award under the Army Pensions Acts in respect of the death of his son, Thomas Brosnan, could be seen as illustrating how a changing attitude by the new State to the actions of its forces also helped to promote stability.\n\nThe body of Thomas Brosnan a blacksmith from Scartaglin, County Kerry was found at the road side in Scartaglin, County Kerry on 6 December 1923 with gunshot wounds. He had been taken from his home some hours previously by a party of National Army soldiers led by Lieutenant Jeremiah Gaffney (no application found).\n\nNewspaper reports of the time show that Gaffney and a number of other members of the National Army unit were charged and tried in connection with Thomas Brosnan’s murder. Jeremiah Gaffney was hanged on 13 March 1924 at Mountjoy Prison, Dublin while a National Army Private Leane or Leen (spellings vary) was also found guilty, sentenced to death, but reprieved.\n\nThomas Brosnan had been a member of the Irish Volunteers and IRA from 1918 and served during the War of Independence and Civil War as a despatch carrier and intelligence officer. On 3 December 1923, three days before Brosnan’s killing, a raid took place on the Scartaglin Civic Guard Station in which Civic Guard Sergeant James Wood was shot dead. However, according to newspaper reports of the murder and subsequent trial, Brosnan’s death – which took place about 7 months after the end of the Civil War – may have had more to do with a quarrel between Thomas Brosnan and his family and Jeremiah Gaffney regarding Gaffney’s involvement with the married, but separated, wife of a cousin of Thomas Brosnan and less to do with Brosnan’s IRA activities or any involvement in Sergeant Wood’s shooting.\n\nThe prosecution and execution by the State of Jeremiah Gaffney contrasts sharply with the previous official attitude towards questionable killings carried out by National Army members in County Kerry and indeed elsewhere. The most infamous example of this is of course in relation to the killings of IRA prisoners at Ballyseedy, Countess Bridge and Caherciveen in March 1923 in retaliation for the Knocknagoshel mine explosion.\n\nAnother example can be seen in the case of National Army Captain Patrick Byrne who was found guilty but insane of the murder of IRA prisoner John Conway at Tralee Barracks in February 1923.\n\nByrne was not dismissed but remained in the Army until his demobilisation in March 1924. As a result he would go on to receive a military service pension of £125 (one hundred and twenty five pounds sterling) per year from 1925 until his death in 1946.\n\nDespite disquiet within the Free State Government regarding the actions and status of the Army, killings, such as those already referred to of Noel Lemass and Henry MacEntee continued to be tolerated. However, a process by which politicians would gain full and firm control over the armed representatives of the State, placing the Army squarely beneath rather than above the laws of the State, was already underway. It can be argued that the prosecution and execution of Jeremiah Gaffney was a small but significant part of this process. As with the IRA’s execution of Philip Doyle, it can be seen as part of the process of normalisation of Irish life. The facing down of the Army mutiny in 1924 would further amplify this trend.\n\nTensions between the two sides of the biggest political divide in the Irish Free State, with occasional physical clashes and outbreaks of violence would continue up to and beyond the handover of power in 1932 from the heirs of the victorious pro-Treaty forces (Cumann na nGaedheal) to those of the defeated anti-Treaty side (Fianna Fáil). However, the decision by both sides to respect and abide by the institutions and laws of the State and the lessening, to varying extents, of tolerance towards acts of violence carried out by their members and supporters, played a major part in allowing that State to become a stable one. These files illustrate in a small way, how part of that process took place."
