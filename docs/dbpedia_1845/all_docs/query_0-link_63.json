The result was sent up to the trenches and read out by our captain and, of course, we started cheering and passing some remarks about their (the Germans) fighting capabilities. We kept it up so long all down the Canadian front that Fritz opened up with rifles fire along the line, and the fun started properly. Then, between bursts of fire, we sang, or rather yelled âRule Britanniaâ, âSons of the Seaâ, etc. Some of our fellows seemed to be pretty well acquainted with the family history of our friends on the other side of âDead Manâs Landâ â¦ We heard about the âroyal Edwardâ being lost. It was rough luck on the poor fellows. â¦ We are all in the best of health and spirits, especially today, as the company has been paid out and are refitting. I have just got some new clothing, and a small bar of Life Buoy soap, so feel quite happy. (Drogheda Independent, September 4, 1915)\n\n(Possibly the same source, as follows)\n\nFrom the Canadian Front\n\nA Drogheda man writing home, in the course of his letter says: âOur last tour in the front line was an eight day one, and they were days of blazing heat. The second night we were in, the enemy sprung a mine in our immediate left trench. It was a glorious evening, and we were all lying around âspinning yarnsâ in the evening sun, when we felt the tremor, and the sky drew dark as the clouds of earth and dust went up. The Artillery Observation Officer on duty in the trench sent the SOS to his brigade, and in 40 seconds from the explosion our guns were in action, and the enemy parapets were going skywards in lengths of 25 or 30 yards. Fritz pounded away at the crater for a couple of hours; our guns made earth and sky tremble. The enemy parapets were absolutely levelled along our front. His working parties tried to rebuild the parapets all that night, but they couldnât face the shrapnel. The wind was n the enemyâs favour, and we were prepared for gas, but he couldnât use it as his front line on the sector was practically wiped out. Every night during our tour in the trenches he attacked along the front, but he âgot it in the neckâ at each point. The country round about is very flat and we could see the Huns carrying out their dead and wounded for the next four days. One of the Irish Divisions âplaying old Halifaxâ with them down at Loos.\n\n(Drogheda Independent, 27 May 1916)\n\nANONYMOUS 2\n\nA Dundalk man who is a non-commissioned officer in the 8th R.D.F., writes us from Buttevant:- âI hope you will excuse the liberty I take in writing to your valued paper, but I thought fir to take the opportunity of letting you know how matters stand here. In the first place, I am glad to inform you that we, the 48th Brigade of the 16th Division are under orders to leave here at any moment. We send from the 8th Dublins from Buttevant tomorrow (Friday) morning an advance party of 2 officers, 8 sergeants and corporals and 52 men (to England we expect), but to what part we donât know. All we do know is it is a move in the right direction; it is not the 48th Brigade alone that are going, but the whole 16th Division. It is a great relief to all the officers, non-commissioned officers and men, to get away from here, and with the help of God to assist their comrades of all other regiments who are fighting with might and main in defence of Ireland and the Empire at large. I believe it is up to and an honour to every Irishman and woman at this present critical time to do all in their power to defeat Germany â thatâs what the Irish Division are out for, and thatâs what they intend to do. You know sir, what the 48th Brigade is combined of â the 8th Dublins, 9th Dublins, Munsters and last though not least, the Royal Irish Rifles, regiments who have proved themselves both in France and in the Dardanelles that they know no fear, and with the help of God, the 48th Brigade will maintain the reputation of their heroic comrades, who have given up their lives to maintain the peace of the world. Amongst the 48th Brigade you have plenty of Louth men, gentlemen such as Major Bellingham, whom every man in the 8th Dublins loves, and would give up their lives to follow him everywhereâ (Dundalk Democrat, 4 September 1915)\n\nANONYMOUS 3\n\n6th West Riding Regiment, 30th May 1916\n\nSir â Would you be so kind as to allow me, an insignificant Irish soldier, to congratulate the men of County Louth through the columns of your widely circulated journal. I wish especially to congratulate the men of the Drogheda Division of the Irish Volunteers in their effort and promptitude in helping to quell the disastrous rebellion in Dublin. Not alone has it been disastrous to life, but in all probability will prove disastrous to the Irish Cause â the Cause which the leaders and people of Ireland have so gallantly fought since the days of Dan OâConnell. How will this rebellion strike Irish units at home and abroad? The one great cry of all the Irish soldiers to-day is, away with the traitor, this traitor to Ireland and the Irish cause. As an Irishman I blush before the world that such a scene should take place in this critical period when we are fighting for our very existence, and the gallant sons of Erin are shedding their lifeâs blood on the battlefield of France and Belgium for a sacred cause, the love of freedom, faith and pure womanhood.\n\nIs all this to be done in vain? Is the remainder of Ireland going to stand by while a few traitors try to sell the Emerald Isle, the land of faith and parity, for gold dipped in the pure and priceless blood of Irishmen. I ask those who belong to the Sinn Feiners to visit in vision if not in reality the blood stained fields of Flanders and look at what will meet their eye. They will see a devastated country, legs and arms amputated of inoffensive civilians, women and children outraged. May I ask are Irishmen going to stand by while those traitors try to sell their country? But we must fight and we must die till the world is once more free from the yoke of German tyranny. I will conclude with all hearty congratulations to the men of Drogheda Division of the Irish Volunteers\n\nYours very sincerely\n\nAn Irish Soldier.

Colonel Bellingham writes:\n\nWe were in action on the 27th and 29th April. My battalion bore the brunt of the right attack, and behaved archly. The Commander-in-Chief came down to see us and congratulate us. He shook hands with me, and said very nice things. I am sending you some of the papers we received. Poor George Magee and Thomas Lambe, of Castle Bellingham; Wm Hoey, of Darver, P. Macken of Ardee; and J Murphy of Drogheda are among the killed. Please express to their people my profound sympathy in their losses. We had heavy casualties, but 50 per cent will return eventually. Our men are furious with the Sinn FÃ©iners, and asked to be allowed to go and finish them up. We were defending the Empire with serious losses the very day these people were trying to help the Germans that we were fighting. It is all too sad.â\n\nâMonday, 1st May, 1916 â The G O C wishes to thank all ranks of the Brigade for their good work during the last few days fighting, and especially the 8th Dublin Fusiliers for their gallant stand they made against the German assault on 27th ult. All battalions have fully maintained the highest tradition of their regiments and have shown the finest fighting spirit of the Irish soldier.\n\nâGerman attack, 27th April 1916 â Irish Division â To Lieutenant-Colonel E Bellingham.

I congratulate you, as I have congratulated him. May God spare him to us â yours truly, Felix Burke. (Dundalk Democrat, 20 May 1916)\n\nâ¦ The 8th R. Dublin Fusiliers advanced to the Second Objective at zero plus 40 minutes (5.25 p.m.) and gained the position without encountering very-serious opposition. At 5.40 p.m., it was found that the Battalion had proceeded about 300 yards beyond the objective, and the Commanding Officer took prompt steps back his men who had now been reinforced by the 8th R. Inniskilling Fus. to the real objective, and to start them on digging a trench about 50 yards east of the German trench.â¦ At this juncture the Officer Commanding the 8th Royal Dublin Fusiliers arrived at Headquarters, 7th R. Irish Rifles to consult with the O.C. who had been knocked over by a shell and severely shaken. At the request of the 7th Royal Irish Rifles the O.C. 8th R. Dublin Fusiliers made a tour of the whole brigade front and withdrew some parties of the 7th Royal Irish Rifles from the Second Objective to consolidate the First Objectiveâ¦\n\nI wish to express my extreme satisfaction at the spirit, courage and determination displayed by all ranks during the operations and in particular of the action of Lieut-Col E Bellingham, 8th R. Dublin Fusiliers, who at a time when troops were elated with success and without officers, was able to control the situation and organise the defences. When it is remembered that the troops had been out in the so-called trenches which were in reality merely shell holes, for five days and nights prior to the attack, during which period they were wet through by rain and did not have a chance of obtaining a hot meal, I submit that the highest credit is reflected on all ranks that the capture of Ginchy (sic) was effected under these adverse conditions, and that the traditions of the Irish race were worthily upheld by these men of the New Armies.\n\nF Ramsey, Brigadier General Commanding 48th Infantry Brigade, 15.9.16\n\n(Extracts from âReport on Operations of 48th Infantry Brigade on 8th and 10th September, 1916 in attack on Guinchy, War Diary of 6 Battalion Royal Irish Rifles).\n\nLieut.-Col.

(Dundalk Democrat, 23 September 1916)\n\nThough no public announcement of the fact has yet been made, we learn from a relative of one of the officers serving with the battalion that Colonel Battalion has been accorded the D.S.O. in recognition of the gallant part recently taken by his battalion in the Somme fighting. Colonel Bellingham both before and since the battalion went to the front had won the repute of a most capable officer, and by the officers and men of his battalion he is held in the warmest affection and esteem. It is their opinion â and there are no better judges â that their Colonel well deserves the distinction that has been awarded him.\n\n(Dundalk Democrat, 14 October 1916)\n\n(Award of Distinguished Service Order to) Temp Lt.-Col. Edwin Henry Charles Patrick Bellingham, R. Dub. Fusiliers\n\nFor conspicuous gallantry in action. He took command of the two leading battalions when the situation was critical, and displayed the greatest determination under shell and machine gun fire. The success of the operation was largely due to his quick appreciation of the situation, and his rapid consolidation of the position.\n\n(Supplement to the London Gazette, 20 October 1916)\n\nOn Tuesday, October 10th, Lieut â Col Bellingham was received in private audience at Buckingham Palace by the King, who personally conferred upon him the Order of D S O and complimented him, and the Irish Battalion that he commands, for their distinguished bravery in the recent fighting near Guinchy. (Dundalk Democrat, 21 October 1916)\n\nWe hear unofficially that Col. Edward Bellingham has been promoted to the rank of Brigadier General. Even in the records of rapid promotion brought about by the war we doubt if there is anything to equal Brigadier General Bellinghamâs. When the war broke out he was filling a Consular post in Central America, came home and accepted a Lieutenantâs commission, was almost immediately promote Adjutant (for which his previous military experience fitted him), then Major, and within a few months Colonel of his battalion of the 16th Division. We doubt if in all the British Army, and that is at present a very expansive range, there is an officer in whom his men have such confidence or who is am much respected and beloved by them. His rapid promotion has nothing of official favour or influence behind it, but is the reward of merit. Though we have no reason to say so, beyond what we have heard from soldiers of the battalion home on leave, we should not be surprised to find that it was the work he did on the bloody day of Guinchy for which he has already been decorated by the King, that singled him out for the responsible post he has been called upon to fill.\n\n(Dundalk Democrat, 17 February 1917)\n\nBrigadier-General Bellingham was home on leave last week and was warmly greeted by a host of friends in and around Castlebellingham.\n\n(Dundalk Democrat, 15 September 1917)\n\nBrig-Gen Bellingham Missing\n\nWe deeply regret to learn that Brig-Gen Edward Bellingham, eldest and only surviving son of Sir Henry Bellingham, Bart, H M L, is reported âmissingâ since the recent battle on the Somme. No details have reached us, beyond the bare statement of fact. Everybody will join in hoping that better news may arrive later as in the case of very many officially reported missing.\n\nBrig-Gen Bellingham was in Central America, where he held a diplomatic appointment, at the outbreak of the war, and at once came home and offered his services. His devotion to duty and later on his great gallantry and resourcefulness in the field won for him rapid promotion, and over six months ago he attained the rank of Brigadier-General, being at the same time personally decorated by King George for his gallantry in action. The British army can ill afford to lose such a man especially at this critical juncture. It is however to be hoped that his father, who has the respect of all classes in Co Louth, and who has already lost one son (the late Captain Roger Bellingham) in the war, will be spared this second and grievous loss. (Dundalk Democrat, 13 April 1918).\n\nGeneral Edward Bellingham, C M G, D S O, D L, only surviving son of Sir Henry, is at present on leave at Castle Bellingham. Some friends in Dundalk whom he visited during the week were delighted to find that he is apparently none the worse for his six monthsâ incarceration in Germany.\n\n(Dundalk Democrat, 8 February 1919)\n\nA meeting convened by Brig-General Bellingham of the demobilised sailors and soldiers of Castlebellingham, Kilsaran, Annagassan, and adjoining districts was held in Annagassan on Sunday. General Bellingham explained the provisions of the Act and suggested that farmersâ sons, farm labourers or others having a knowledge of agriculture should apply to the Estates Commissioners for a farm on one of the soldiersâ farm colonies, and in the case of men who do not wish to rely on farming for a living, they should apply to the L C B for a cottage and a plot. In conclusion General Bellingham expressed the pleasure it gave him to meet so many of his old comrades in arms. His earnest wish is, on completion of military service, to live amongst them. He would always give his best efforts in opening up and developing any feasible local industries that would give employment to his neighbours, especially those who served in the war. He suggested that the ex-servicemen form a club to look after their interests under the new Act, or in the alternative form a branch of the Comrades of the Great War or the Discharged or Demobilised Sailors and Soldiers Federation.\n\nImmediately afterwards a branch of the D S and S A was formed of which the following officials were appointed â President, Jas Hosie; Treasurer, Robt.

Brown R.M. Funeral fro Saint Patrickâs Dundalk to New Cemetery.\n\nWe regret to announce the death which took place last Wednesday as the result of an accident, of Dr Gerard Brown of 38 Elgin Road Dublin. He was the second son of the late Mr R.L. Brown Resident Magistrate and educated at Clongowes Wood College and Trinity College Dublin. During the Great War Dr Brown served with the Connaught Rangers in France and was awarded the Military Cross. As a medical student he played on the St. Vincentâs Hospital Rugby team when they won the hospitalâs cup. He was one of the oldest members of the Three Rock Rovers Hockey Club and also for many years a member of the Royal Dublin and Portmarnock golf clubs. A keen fisherman he was a popular member of Kells Anglers Association and a most successful dry fly fisherman.\n\nDr. Brownâs personality endeared him to the members of the various social clubs to which he belonged, including the Hibernian Catch Club, the Strollers, the University Club and the Royal Irish Yacht Club. He was beloved by his friends and by many in other walks of life, whom he always helped and tried to make their lot in life less difficult. His invariable courtesy, his geniality and his consideration for all with whom he came in contact, were true to the Irish type of family from which he sprang. The sincere sympathy of all who knew him will be with his widow and daughter and surviving brother, Mr Harry Brown, in their great sorrow.\n\nDr. OâBeirne Coroner for Roscommon opened an inquest at the County Hospital here today on the body of Mr. Thomas Gerard Brown L.R.C.P., of 38 Elgin Road, Dublin, who died this morning as a result of a gunshot wound accidentally received on Monday. Dr. Oliver Chance, Merrion Square, Dublin, stated that on Monday last, he was shooting with Dr. Brown at Rathconnor Bog. They crossed a drain within a few yards of each other and the witness carried the gun in his left hand with the catch on âsafeâ. âWhen we crossed the drain we came together and exchanged a few words. My gun was pointing to the ground a few yards in front and slightly to my right, on which side Mr. Brown was standing. With the gun still in that position I took it off âsafeâ and it fired. Mr Brown stepped forward with his left leg at the same time and the charge entered his leg at a range of not more than two yards. He fell to the ground. I did what I could for him and remained with him until he was removed and accompanied him to the hospital.â\n\nDr. Brown, the witness added, was a personal friend of his and they had known each other for ten years or longer and came to Roscommon together from Dublin for the shoot. The gun must have gone off as a result of catching a button. Patrick Fahy, Gortalina, Ballina, who carried the game bag corroborated and added\n\nI have assisted those gentlemen at the shooting for three or four years. They were always on the most friendly terms. There was a happy week or four days every time they came\n\nDr. W.G. Ridgeway Co-Surgeon stated that Dr. Brown was suffering from severe shock and gunshot wounds in the left leg. Guard McCoy, Rockfield, stated that after the accident he found Dr. Brown lying on the ground wounded. He asked him what had happened and Dr. Brown replied, âit was an accidentâ. The jury, without retiring returned a verdict that the cause of death was shock and heart failure, following gunshot wounds received as a result of an accident.\n\n(Irish Times, 6 December 1935.)\n\nBRUMLEY, A, Royal Field Artillery.

Colonel Tom Algar Elliot Cairnes, D.S.O. Stameen, Drogheda which occurred on Saturday last.\n\nBy his passing Drogheda has lost one of its most distinguished citizens and a void has been created which will be difficult to fill, for the late Colonel Cairnes as he was known and respected over a wide area played a very important role in the commercial and social life of Drogheda for almost 40 years.\n\nSon of the late Mr and Mrs William P Cairned he was born in 1888 and was a member of a Louth family which played a prominent part in the commercial life of the county for generations. It was his great grandfather who established Cairnes Brewery Ltd in Drogheda and deceased was Chairman of the board of Directors of this important concern until it closed a few years ago. As well as devoting a great deal of time and energyin the affairs of the brewery, Colonel Cairned interests spread in quite a few directions. He was managing director of Black Bull Motors Ltd. Director of Small Wares Ltd. Castlebellingham, director of the Shelbourne Hotel, Dublin, director of the Dublin Board of the Yorkshire Insurance Company and proprietor of the former Stameen Turkey Breeder Hatcheries. He was also an extensive farmer being the owner of approximately 250 acres.\n\nHe was also in charge of Cairnesâ Housing Trust which was established in 1890 to cater to some extent for the housing needs of Droghedaâs townspeople. There were 10 houses built under this scheme.\n\nArmy Career\n\nThe late Colonel Cairnes had a distinguished career in the British Army which he joined in 1906 and with which he served until 1924 when he retired and married his late wife formerly Miss Kathleen Hosken , daughter of Lieut-Colonel Hosken. Mrs Cairnes to whom he was devoted , died in 1950.\n\nIn his army days he saw service in the First World War and with the 7th Dragoon Guards and later with the Royal Flying Corps to which he had been attached. He won the distinguished service order in 1917. In World War II Colonel Cairnes joined the Royal Air Force and served in Northern Ireland.\n\nThe deceased Gentleman who was a prominent churchman was a former secretary of the Diocesan Council of Meath and was a member of the representative Body of the Church of Ireland. In his younger days he was a keen sportsman and was a frequent follower of the Louth Hounds and other hunts.\n\nThe late Colonel Cairnes was a most charitable and kindly person who took a deep interest in the wellbeing of his employeeâs by whom he was held in the highest esteem.\n\nA cultured gentleman and a person of the highest principles he won the respect and affection of all whom he came in contact and his old-world charm innate courtesy coupled with his integrity and sense of fair play combined to make him a type of personage who is all too rare in the world today and whose passing is to be mourned by all who hold in high regard to the qualities which are synonymous with the title given to so many but fitting to so few of gentleman. (The Drogheda Independent)\n\nThe chief mourners were his son Mr David Cairnes, a daughter Mrs A k Purdon, Lisnabin, Killucan, Co Westmeath and a brother Major F.H Cairnes M.C. Suffolk. He is also survived by Mrs S Woods, Kilsharvin, Drogheda, Mrs L Hunt, Drogheda, Mrs Shorter, Balrothery, Major C R P Barrow, Mayne Manor, Castlebellingham, and Mrs Bellingham, Dunany House, Dunleer and Mrs and Mrs R Russell, Co Waterford (relatives).\n\nThe Primate of Ireland , Most Rev Dr James McCann, the Bishop of Meath, Most Rev Dr Pyke and the Dean of Clonmacnoise, Rev R J Charters officiated at the interment in St Maryâs Churchyard on Monday. The coffin was borne from St Maryâs Protestant Church to the churchyard by members of the staff of the deceasedâs farm at Stameen .
