        "text": "T. Michael DeFazio, MA\n\nEditor’s Note: This is the first of a three-part series of posts that is based on the larger MA thesis that 2nd Lt. DeFazio wrote during his time in the Dale Center\n\nPart I: Why They Enlisted\n\nAs a child, I remember asking my grandmother what her father did during World War II. She explained that he joined the United States Army Air Corps (USAAC) as a bombardier in early 1942, as he was inspired by his brother’s military service, which had begun even before Pearl Harbor. Confused, I asked her why my great-grandfather’s brother, Robert Lewis Pewitt, joined the USAAC before the United States declared war. To my surprise, my grandmother explained that he had not joined his own nation’s air force, but rather Great Britain’s Royal Air Force (RAF), specifically as a member of the Eagle Squadrons—three fighter squadrons of the RAF comprised by American volunteers. What drove men like Robert Pewitt to not only join the RAF, but to continually serve and fight in its battles? These are questions I tackled in my MA thesis, entitled “The Royal Air Force Eagle Squadrons: Initial, Sustaining, and Combat Motivation, 1940-1942.”\n\nIn this three-pronged approach on soldier motivation, I borrowed the conceptual framework offered by John Lynn, in his study of motivation within the revolutionary armies of France. He broke down soldier motivation into three categories, initial motivation (the factors which influence soldiers to enlist in the military), sustaining motivation (the factors which influence soldiers to remain in the military), and combat motivation (the factors which influence soldiers to fight in battle). For example, in his discussion on combat motivation, Lynn downplayed the mythical “cult of the bayonet” as the driving force for Armée du Nord soldiers.[1] Instead, he argued for primary group cohesion—the close bonds formed by soldiers, which motivated them to protect each other in battle.\n\nAs demonstrated in the case of Robert Pewitt, the RAF Eagle Squadrons present an intriguing avenue of analysis for soldier motivation, as virtually each member of the squadron volunteered before the United States entered the war. Understanding soldier motivation—especially across Lynn’s three tiers—is a vital component of understanding war as a whole and the Eagle Squadrons’ foreign-national-volunteer makeup provides a unique look into the topic. This first blog post focuses on the first tier, initial motivation, as it related to the 244 American volunteers who joined RAF Squadrons 71, 121, and 133.\n\n“It was about the Germans”\n\nContrary to some historians’ arguments, my research of the Eagle Squadrons—based on interviews and questionnaires from its members, their diaries, memoirs, letters, and personnel records—concluded that ideological motivation primarily drove them to enlist in the RAF.[1] The pilots of the Eagle Squadrons came from all across the United States, but they were united by one cause: a desire to fly for the RAF in defense of Great Britain. During the summer of 1940, these soon-to-be fighter pilots closely followed the Battle of Britain, mesmerized by the stories of heroic Spitfire pilots battling an evil, but superior enemy. As Harold Strickland, a member of Eagle Squadron No. 71, remarked in his memoirs, “England, fighting alone, was frequently on my mind and on the minds of many Americans….”[2]\n\nThis desire to assist Great Britain in its lonesome fight against the forces of tyranny was strong within the Eagle Squadrons. In fact, these American volunteers were so eager to join the fight that many neglected the opportunity to fly for their own air force, the USAAC. Accompanying the USAAC’s stringent physical requirements was the mandate of two years of college education for its pilots. Given Europe’s present state of war and the United States’ declared neutrality, many Eagles were unwilling to wait in college classrooms and thus miss out on the opportunity to make a difference in Great Britain. As No. 133’s LeRoy Gover exclaimed, “Hell, I can’t go to college for four years, it’ll be all over.”[3]\n\nSome Eagles had even completed the college requirement but opted to join the beleaguered RAF instead of the peacetime USAAF, knowing that only the former offered them the ability to immediately confront the Luftwaffe. Robert Priser of No. 71 had completed his sophomore year at the University of Arizona but volunteered for the RAF instead of the USAAC. He credited his decision to stopping the Luftwaffe. “It was about the Germans,” he declared.[4]\n\nChesley Peterson, the first American commander of an Eagle Squadron, asserted that “ideologically I just knew that things were just wrong in Europe and would be certainly under a Nazi regime.”[5] While some historians have argued the Eagles’ motivation solely laid in a desire to fly Spitfires—the front-line fighter aircraft of the RAF—Peterson’s comments reflected the common denominator of the Eagles’ decision to join the RAF. They could have joined any other nation’s air force—such as that of Germany, whose aircraft were indeed superior to those of Great Britain—but they chose to stand with the RAF in its ideological battle.\n\n[1] John A.
