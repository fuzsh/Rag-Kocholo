        "text": "VANCEBURG – Lewis County resident Jim Vergne has a unique link to the Lewis and Clark Corps of Discovery.\n\nHe is a sixth generation descendant of Captain John Doyle, a member of the historic expedition.\n\n“Doyle was very vital to the Corps of Discovery and the development of Lewis County,” Vergne said. “He was one of nine officials who met at the first session of the county court in Lewis County on April 27, 1807. It met at the home of Oke Hendrikson on Poplar Flat,” Vergne said.\n\nCaptain Doyle was also an early supporter of Vanceburg, being one of the first to buy lots in the new town in 1797.\n\n“The entire town was organized and named for his cousin, Joseph C. Vance,” said Vergne.\n\nAt the age of 16, Doyle took his father’s place as a soldier in 1778, while the family was living on 426-acre farm in Fayette County, Pa.\n\nAfter a short experience as a soldier in the vicinity of Fort Pitt, Pa., Doyle volunteered as a light horseman under then Col. George Rogers Clark.\n\n“Doyle was with Clark when he took Vincennes (Indiana) from the British in 1779, which was originally a French mission,” Vergne said.\n\nAfter serving in the Revolutionary War and Clark’s first campaign against the Indians, Captain Doyle came again to the west in 1781 (which was what the Ohio Valley was called at the time) with now Gen. Clark, who brought his troops to battle the Indians in the territories of Indiana and Illinois and relieve the populace of the threat of constant raids, Vergne said.\n\nVergne also noted that although Clark had captured Vincennes from the British, there were many Indian troubles because the British allegedly “stirred up the Indians to attack the frontier settlements.”\n\nDoyle later observed that he remembered the particulars of his trip with Clark in 1781 because it was the same year British Gen. Charles Earl Cornwallis surrendered at Yorktown, Va.\n\nHis surrender was a critical turning point in favor of the American colonists in their battle with the British. Doyle said later in an interview “that when he came with Clark’s Army, down the Ohio River, there was no white settlement along the river between Wheeling, Va. (now W.Va.) and the falls of Louisville; and not a stick cut (in) Limestone (now Maysville).”\n\nDoyle’s company of Dragoons (mounted infantry men), made up of about 700-800 men had planned to join Colon El Lochny with 200-300 men, but the Indians attacked him at what today is known as Lochny’s Creek, Ohio. Most of the men were killed as a result of trickery by the Indians, Vergne said.\n\nAccording to Doyle when Clark came ahead of Lochny, he left five or six men on an island on the river to warn Lochny that Indians were in the area, but the Indians caught the men by surprise and took them prisoner.\n\nThe Indians built a huge fire on the island to give Lochny the impression that Clark and his men were on the island.\n\n“As Lochny and his men approached the island in open boats in July 1781, the Indians fired killing most of the men instantly and taking the survivors as prisoners,” Vergne said.\n\nCaptain Doyle, like his peers, Simon Kenton and Daniel Boone, lived out his last years with few worldly goods, “although he had given his entire life to protecting those pioneers who were settling here, building their homes and raising their children,” Vergne said.\n\nDoyle is seen by history as having displayed bravery and strong physical abilities, Vergne said. He was a brave scout, had strong physical endurance and reportedly never needed the services of a doctor.\n\nHe served in the Revolutionary and Indian wars as well as the War of 1812, Vergne said.\n\nDoyle died December 8, 1847, and was buried on his farm in Lewis County. His grave is marked by a grove of pine trees that keep a vigil over the old warrior and pioneer’s final resting place."
