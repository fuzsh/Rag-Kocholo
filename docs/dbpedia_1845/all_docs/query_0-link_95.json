        "text": "Nature of Source\n\nApplication for pension benefits from an officer’s widow or her children. The records consist of bundles of documents in support of the widows claim for pension payments. The bundles are organised and indexed alphabetically by the surname of the officer and cover the years from 1755 to 1908 and can be found in series WO 42 held at The National Archives.\n\nA further series of records deal with pensions paid to widows of officers killed on active service, as well as those retired on full or half pay and cover the years from 1713 to 1914. Payments were also made to the children of deceased and disabled officers during their service.\n\nAnother potential source of regular army officer information can be found in the Graduation Lists which run from 1901 to 1914 which are available in the open reading room at The National Archives. These lists are similar in scope to the Army Lists.\n\nA possible starting point for officer research pre-WWI is to consult the alphabetical card index of officers compiled by staff at The National Archives in the 1970s. The information was extracted from series WO 25 and WO 26 but unfortunately is not complete. WO 25 is also available as part of the Digital Microfilm Records. Officer commissions, promotions and discharges have also been published in the London Gazette since the early 18th century\n\nAn officer’s name can also be found amongst the surviving documents found in series WO 27 covering the years from 1750 to 1914. The series contains regimental inspection returns and amongst other things shows the names of officers present providing his name, age and nationality. Another possibility for finding details of an officer (cavalry and infantry officers only) is to search the Service Returns found in series WO 25. These records consists of surveys of retired officers on full or half pay and were taken for various years from 1809 to 1873. Service returns for Engineers officers can be found in series WO 25 and WO 54 and for Artillery officers in series WO 54 and WO 76 (Records within WO 76 are available to download free of charge as part of the Digital Microfilm Records or online at Findmypast). The Royal Artillery and Royal Engineers published their own lists of officers and these are available at The National Archives and other local and reference libraries.\n\nService records for all ranks who served after 1920 remain with the Ministry of Defence with each military service maintaining its own record office. See the MOD detailed guide ‘Requests for personal data and service records: How to apply for access to personal data held by the Ministry of Defence’.\n\nAlso see\n\nArmy – Casualty Lists, Other Ranks before 1914\n\nArmy – Pensions (Medical & Service) Admission Books, Other Ranks before 1914 (Military)\n\nArmy – Pensions Returns & Regimental Register of Pensioners, Other Ranks before 1914 (Military)\n\nArmy – Soldiers’ Documents (Service Records) from Pension Claims (‘Unburnt Collection’), Other Ranks, WWI (Military)\n\nWar Memorials, Graves & Rolls of Honour (Military, including WWI) Including Scotland\n\nWhere Found\n\nThe National Archives (WO 42, War Office: Officers’ Birth Certificates, Wills and Personal Papers, 1755-1908.
