        "text": "Get to know John\n\nI am a principal lawyer and head of the medical negligence department in Liverpool. I am responsible for my teams supervision, training and development in addition to running my own caseload.\n\nDuring my career I’ve dealt with a wide variety of complex and high value claims. I specialise in cases involving all aspects of medical negligence, including birth injury for mother and baby, brain injury, spinal injury, surgical errors, missed or delayed diagnosis (fractures / cancer), failure to treat and fatal accident cases including assisting families through the inquest process.\n\nI represent injured patients and their families and have focused exclusively in this practice area since 2007.\n\nCareer highlights\n\nThroughout my career I have been fortunate to act for many inspirational clients whose lives have been fundamentally changed as a result of negligent medical treatment.\n\nEach one of those clients leaves their own mark and shapes me as a person and lawyer. Successfully concluding cases in my client’s favour is incredibly satisfying and securing an apology and / or compensation for my client is always a real highlight.\n\nThe vast majority of cases settle however, from a career in law perspective have been fortunate to be directly involved in a number of cases that proceeded to trial and have experience in the County Court, High Court and Court of Appeal. The following are formally reported cases.\n\nSontino Lennie (by his mother and litigation friend Lisa Lennie) v Royal Victoria Infirmary & Associated Hospitals NHS Trust [2006] EWCA Civ 975 [Phillips, LJ Brooke LJ, Waller LJ].\n\nSouth Yorkshire Strategic Health Authority - v - Corbett (By his mother & Litigation Friend\n\nCatherine Elizabeth Corbett) (2008) EWCA Civ 5 [Waller LJ, Buxton LJ, Smith LJ]\n\nSimon Boustead (A Protected Party suing by his mother & Litigation Friend Belinda Murray) –\n\nv - North West Strategic Health Authority (City Maternity Hospital Carlisle) (2008) QBD –\n\nNewcastle (Mackay J)"
