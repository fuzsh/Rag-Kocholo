        "text": "1.\n\n2.\n\nIt's Sunrise 04:36\n\nIt's Sunrise Come gather round me people Whoever you may be Time’s not on our side here So listen up to me While you all were sleeping They slipped on round the back They stole your information And robbed you of the facts Wake up and open your eyes Get on your shoes, it’s sunrise They’re selling you a story To take you for a ride They’re buying up the law now And expect you to abide They’re getting all the richer On your blood, sweat and tears Abolishing your freedoms And stirring up your fears They strip you of your feathers For to line their comfy nest And leave you digging in the dirt For worms and all the rest Sayin’ “time to clip your wings You won’t need them in the west” And when you Die from trying to fly they’ll say You never did your best Wake up, and open your eyes Get on your marching shoes, it’s sunrise They lured you with the promise You’ll be rich just like they said But when you start to climb They stamp their foot down on your head And it don’t make a difference if its a Red Tie or a Blue No damn difference Cos they got no tie for you The hopes of all the needy Are in the hands of a few The battle-hymn of Greedy Is to conquer me and you They’ve siphoned off your money It's why your pension’s in the red So forget about retirement Gonna work you till you’re dead Wake up, and open your eyes Get on your protest shoes, it’s sunrise They’re preaching down their batons That you’re lucky to be free That they’re just trying to protect you From some evil enemy While they push their propaganda And censor what you see Their object’s to divide, so We must fight for unity You stuck your head above the parapet To shout you disagree You got a barrel in your mouth now As they push you to your knees You can’t elect the jailor And expect your liberty You helped him build the prison Now you’re looking for the keys Wake up, and open your eyes Get on your marching shoes, it’s sunrise So wake up your sons and daughters Splash some water on their face, don’t let them Believe old hollow words designed To keep them in their place Cos they’ve wasted generations trying to Quench their thirst for war Sayin thanks for your sacrifice, while Smoking big cigars Wake up, and open your eyes Put on your voting shoes, it’s sunrise Wake up and open your eyes Put on your voting shoes, it’s sunrise C’mon it’s sunrise It’s time for sunrise Wake up and open your eyes Get on your shoes It's sunrise.\n\n3.\n\nBay of Biscay 05:27\n\nBay of Biscay My William sails upon the Tender And where he is I do not know For seven long years I've been constantly waiting For to cross the bay of Biscay-O One night as Mary lay a-sleeping A knock came to her bedroom door Saying \"Arise, arise, my dearest Mary For to gain one glance of your William-O\" Well Mary arose and put on her clothing Unto her bedroom door did go And there she spied her true love standing His two pale cheeks as white as snow \"Oh William dear, where are those blushes Those blushes I knew long years ago?\" \"Oh Mary dear, the cold clay has them I am only the ghost of your William-O\" \"Oh Mary dear, the dawn is breaking, The time has come for me to go But I must leave you quite broken-hearted For to cross the Bay of Biscay-O\" \"Had I the gold and all the jewels and all the money in Mexico I would grant them all to that king of Erin To bring me back my William-O\"\n\n4.\n\n5.\n\nLife Upon the Ocean 03:50\n\nLife Upon the Ocean Come all ye sea-dogs tough and torn And I’ll tell you all where I was born near rocky ground where corncrakes call Far from this briny ocean No sport nor play boys I do warn Where the land’s too wet for oats or corn So I signed up on the quay one morn For life upon the ocean So it’s heave and ho, to sea we go For life upon the ocean A farmer’s life was not for me With tax and tithes and clouts for free So I strove for where a man can be A salt upon the ocean Yeah give us strength and tame the sea We’re sailing out for victory On board a ship thats taut and free Out here upon the ocean For it’s heave and ho, to sea we go For a life upon the ocean And when we dock in Manaus It’s dark Brazilian Rum for us We’ll drink to all things beauteous While off this briny ocean Cos when we’re off the stormy seas We’ll spend our money easily And court fair maidens neath the trees And drink their magic potions For it’s heave and ho, to sea we go For a life upon the ocean When I’m old and frail in form I’ll make my way where I was born To the rocky ground where corncrakes call Far from this briny ocean For it’s heave and ho to sea they’ll go That stormy main will ebb and flow And younger bucks will come to know This life upon the ocean It’s heave and ho, to sea we’ll go For a life upon the ocean\n\n6.\n\nGeneral Owen Roe 04:57\n\nGeneral Owen Roe My name is McGuire and my age is nineteen Many's the fine scrimmage and battle I've seen Many's the fine battle sure I did undergo Commanded by the hero called General Owen Roe Now Owen Roe being tired for the want of sleep Gave the lady five guineas his secret to keep When she got the money well it did tempt her soul She soon brought the cavalry and surrounded Owen Roe When Owen Roe saw them coming well he flew into the hall He tried to escape but he could not at all Surrounding him they marched him in cold and in snow Undaunted three cheers cried our hero Owen Roe \"Here's a health to my wife and my children three My lands and my living I leave all to thee My bridle and my saddle to my son I bestow May he ride with the pride of his father Owen Roe\" Then up rode his sister she was all dressed in green A sword by her side it was pointed and keen She gave three cheers and away she did go \"I'll have revenge for my brother Owen Roe\" Here's a health to Tyrone and long may she reign Together we fought all in our domain We fought them for hours, swept them to and fro Commanded by that hero called General Owen Roe\n\n7.\n\n8.\n\nAbe Carmen 04:38\n\nAbe Carmen My name it is Abe Carmen, you may find me alarming If you think there may be harm in the trade of burglary I live by taking chances like heroes of romances And taking what I fancy from those wealthier than me It's their goods all for the taking and there is no mistaking There is little you'll be making on the straight and narrow path All toiling for the masters or bowing to the pastors Those cruel heartless bastards who would let a poor man starve. Old friends I have seen them, cast off all thoughts of freedom For their wives and babies need them and the bread for which they slave Their pride they learn to humble, being never heard to grumble But before I take that tumble you will find me in my grave Some they goes to be a soldier with a musket on their shoulder but they never grow much older once the generals ride to war And the lads who plough the ocean wish they'd never took the notion When commanders seek promotion on a tide of sailor's gore So when the night comes falling I'll tend unto my calling You will never find me crawling to the lofty gentry With my pistols on the high road and my cudgels on the byroads Yeah every road is my road when i walk it strong and free While I've a mate to hold a candle and an iron to break a handle And a boy to spy the land I will rob both great and small 'Till my luck it does forsake me on the day when they do take me And on the gallows break me and that will pay for all\n\n9.\n\nOne Fine Day 04:10\n\nOne Fine Day The stormy seas do roll, our boat packed and unsteady Water in the hole, gas fumes sting our eyes We vanished in the night, while the world was sleeping And on this dreadful night, we leave our lands behind At home war rages on, burning rubble and ashes The bombings had begun so we scattered to the winds My mother died last night and we buried her in the morning And in that early light, well, the tears they stung my eyes Oh, one fine day One fine day we'll rise again We'll rise again Oh, one fine day One fine day we'll rise again When I was but a boy, I worked hard and I prospered I had no need for toys but I kept my family fed But now I am a man and I'm hiding in the shadows From militia and roving vans, bullets and an early grave Oh, one fine day One fine day we'll rise again We'll rise again Oh, one fine day One fine day we'll rise again Searchlights scan the seas as the waves crash o'er us Our boat lists on our lee and overboard we fly The lucky ones reach land, oh, but others sink down before me And i try to lend a hand, then I scramble to the shore Oh, one fine day One fine day we'll rise again We'll rise again Oh, one fine day One fine day we'll rise again Oh, one fine day One fine day we'll rise again We'll rise again Oh, one fine day One fine day we'll rise again"
