        "text": "Good Monday morning. This is Dan Bloom.\n\nDRIVING THE DAY\n\nHONEYMOON’S OVER: One month to the day since he became prime minister, Keir Starmer finds himself chairing his first COBRA meeting about the days of violence that have rocked England’s towns and cities. It’s been quite the trip from the PM’s chummy summits with world leaders and flurry of king’s speech bills … to suspending seven MPs over the two-child benefit limit … warning of tax rises … scrapping many pensioners’ winter fuel payments and the 2025 cap on care costs … and, now, riots on the streets, which have sorely tested Britain’s social fabric and the pace of Starmer’s response in a crisis. The hard realities of governing are starting to bite.\n\nToday’s big event: The PM will chair Whitehall’s emergency committee with police chiefs at a yet-to-be-disclosed time — almost a week after unrest began over the murder of three girls at a dance class in Southport, Merseyside. Government officials were keen to stress loads of non-COBRA summits had already happened, but that didn’t stop Labour’s critics calling for this meeting much sooner (e.g. Shadow Security Minister Tom Tugendhat). Expect a grilling from hacks at the 11.30 a.m. Lobby briefing.\n\nToday’s bigger event … will, obviously, be politicians watching through their fingers in the hope violence dies down after Sunday’s far-right attacks on asylum hotels in Rotherham and Tamworth. South Yorkshire Police said at least 10 of its officers were injured after people threw wooden planks and sprayed them with fire extinguishers. The Times has some pretty harrowing accounts from asylum seekers who were in the Rotherham Holiday Inn Express. One said rioters “hit me until police drove them down the corridor.” Said another: “I wanted to cry.”\n\n**A message from Goldman Sachs: Get the global analysis on the economic trends shaping 2024 from Goldman Sachs. Our economists and strategists share insights on the key factors driving the global economy. Discover our market-by-market, region-by-region, sector-by-sector analysis for the year ahead. Read our insights here.**\n\nCooper reel: No word yet on whether Starmer will pop up in front of a camera today, but Home Secretary Yvette Cooper has the morning media round including the 8.10 a.m. slot on Radio 4’s Today program. As of last night, there had been 420 arrests (including 147 on Sunday), and Cooper may well update the numbers shortly. She’ll also want to talk about emergency security for mosques under a £51 million scheme that already exists. Shadow Home Secretary James Cleverly is out for the Tories.\n\nBLUE MONDAY: The usual Monday morning comedown for tanked-up thugs in England’s magistrates’ courts will be more painful than most. But the biggest headache is yet to come, as the Crown Prosecution Service (which has deployed extra lawyers, per the FT) is still wading through most cases. A good time to highlight the lack of media funding for court reporting these days (h/t former local reporter Gareth Davies).\n\nEssay crisis: The Sunday Telegraph went heavily on briefing that magistrates’ courts could sit overnight to process cases more quickly. While this is indeed possible — Policing Minister Diana Johnson told Times Radio if “courts need to sit longer, that will happen” — Playbook is told not to expect big movement on this today. Any decisions are for the judiciary (in concert with police and prosecutors) region by region.\n\nCLEAN SWEEP: Starmer’s 276-word Sunday statement calling the unrest “far-right thuggery” with “racist rhetoric,” which toughens up his previous words a little, gets onto the front pages of the Independent, i, FT, Guardian, Mirror, Times, Express and Mail. The PM took two questions in a five-minute stint at the podium in No. 10 — a sort of glorified pool clip, given hacks from the wider political media were not invited. “This is not protest,” he said. “It is organized, violent thuggery and it has no place on our streets, or online.”\n\nAimed at no one in particular … The PM said those “whipping up this action online and then running away” would regret it, too. Moments later, MailOnline had pics of Tommy Robinson sunning himself at an “all-inclusive five-star hotel in Cyprus.” Fellow agitator Laurence Fox also tweeted saying “it’s war” and — steel yourself — “for decades British girls have been raped by immigrant barbarians.” That one’s been viewed more than 3 million times.\n\nBacking up the PM: Cooper writes in the Times that there will be “many more” arrests in the coming days for those who were on the streets — and “the same goes for people encouraging violence online.” No word yet on the government’s next conversations with tech firms. But it seems fair to guess Elon Musk won’t enjoy the same love-in he did with the last PM.\n\nNot just the far right: The Telegraph (and other outlets) point out that Muslim groups and far-right groups also clashed with each other in Bolton on Sunday. The paper has a statement from Tory leadership hopeful Robert Jenrick saying there should be no “squeamishness or selectivity” in enforcing the law.\n\nUnder pressure: A key question from hacks will be how Britain’s bursting jails can sustain a new influx of offenders — or indeed, how police can keep up. Ex-Met Police Assistant Commissioner Neil Basu told the BBC’s The World This Weekend that protests since Oct. 7 have already “stretched the Metropolitan Police to its limit.” Now officers are being shared through mutual aid across the country and the Police Federation has said 999 calls could go unanswered.\n\nMY ENEMY’S ENEMY: Sunday’s escalation to targeting asylum hotels mellowed the Tory criticism of the government’s response a bit, as politicians opted for unity against the thugs. Tory Leader Rishi Sunak and Cleverly both put their focus on the rioters rather than the Labour PM last night.\n\nBUT BUT BUT … Bubbling along are accusations that the government has not acted fast or decisively enough, or tried to address the underlying causes of social tension. Tory leadership contender Priti Patel called on Saturday for parliament to be recalled “immediately” (suspended Labour MP Zarah Sultana agreed), while her rival Tom Tugendhat writes in today’s Express: “The government must get a grip … So far, Labour’s answer has been phone calls and speeches.”\n\nEr, about that: Government officials were not giving the slightest indication last night that parliament will be recalled. That’s despite political violence adviser John Woodcock telling GB News it’d have to be “if this continues” and emergency powers are drawn up.\n\nNothing to see here either: Diana Johnson told broadcasters the army won’t be brought in because “there is no ask from the police” to do so. It’s not ruled out in the future, but only in the sense that these things are never ruled out. Johnson also refused to say whether far-right groups could be proscribed, though this one may be a bit of a moot point — one of the problems for police is that there is no longer one central group coordinating all this, with influencers instead spreading messages to like-minded thinkers on WhatsApp and Telegram.\n\nOr here: One outstanding question is whether Starmer still plans to take a summer holiday from the end of this week — as the Times’ Saturday read suggested (and Jenrick jumped on). Officials insist the plan was always for him to work from No. 10 this week, as the Telegraph reported. But Playbook notes that doesn’t actually rule out the PM going on his hollybobs when the week ends.\n\nThere’s never a good time for it: Check out this light piece in the Telegraph about the vexed politics of prime ministerial breaks.\n\nIN THE BLUE CORNER: Things are not all rosy either for the Tories, who find themselves dealing with some choice comments by politicians on their side. Not least Shadow Welsh Secretary Byron Davies, who issued a classic “sorry if you misread me” non-apology last night after party whips had a word over his tweet: “But Labour blocked the Rwanda Bill 130+ times, of course it’s politically justified!” Welsh Secretary Jo Stevens said he should “seriously consider” his position.\n\nNot to mention … The Conservative police and crime commissioner for Hampshire Donna Jones is standing by her statement that we should acknowledge the cause of the unrest is a desire to “protect Britain’s sovereignty” and “uphold British values.” That one went down like so much cold sick on X.\n\nBlame Blair! Reform UK MP Rupert Lowe made similar noises, telling GB News the ill-feeling among the public dates back to a state of play “engineered” by “elites” since Tony Blair who backed the ECHR and quangos and lost touch with the country. An interesting thesis … though it may not fully explain the decision to ransack a Greggs.\n\nBlame Farage! Labour MP Kim Johnson told the Guardian that Nigel Farage should be investigated by parliament’s standards commissioner for asking if the truth about the Southport suspect was being withheld.\n\nSTEP BACK: Just as Lowe points the finger at Blair, there are questions about the Tory legacy. The government’s former adviser on social cohesion Sara Khan has told the Guardian “the writing was clearly on the wall for some time” and politicians have taken stances that were “counterproductive and just defy any logical rationale.”\n\nMore grim words: Malaysia warned tourists against visiting the U.K. (more via the Express) … Former Scottish First Minister Humza Yousaf told Sky there were “pogroms against the Muslim community” … and Basu told Radio 4: “I spent 30 years as a police officer feeling pretty secure in my ability to handle myself. I don’t feel like that this week.”\n\nIn summary: Starmer, thousands of police officers and the Home Office will be hoping with clenched teeth that it doesn’t get any worse tonight.\n\nPLANET TORY\n\nSUCKERS FOR PUNISHMENT: The six candidates for Tory leader are touring the nation this week so that Conservative members can tell them how it all went so wrong. Despite a flurry of interviews with friendly outlets over the weekend, none of Robert Jenrick’s five rivals plan a big press launch event like his soon — it’s a slower and more private introspection. It’s going to be a long month. Or, er, a “long soak in a bath of blood,” as No. 10 political strategy chief Morgan McSweeney would put it (via the Sunday Times).\n\nOn the move: James Cleverly kicked off his tour on Sunday, standing on the back of a Land Rover Defender with activists in Milton Keynes … Priti Patel has already done more than half a dozen visits over the weekend, with a dozen or so more this week and an 8.05 a.m. slot on Times Radio … and Tom Tugendhat, Kemi Badenoch and Mel Stride are all talking to members, too. Several have promised to give more power to local associations after years of a disconnect with the national leadership.\n\nClaws away! Jenrick, out to prove he is not simply a moderate putting on a right-wing face, told GB News it was a “mistake, with hindsight” for him to vote Remain … and “if I were an American citizen, I would be voting for Donald Trump.” One rival Tory birdie chirps to Playbook: “This is just what a left-winger thinks a right-winger should say. Cosplay right-winger.”\n\nThe other big interview: Badenoch spent a mammoth 50 minutes with the Telegraph’s Planet Normal podcast, where she had lots of snark for the Guardian and said … we can’t “pretend everything is fine” on integration … she’ll be launching her campaign in September … “I might leave the ECHR, it depends on the plan” … and “I’m very worried that we are at an existential point where the party could end up going the way of the Liberals in the early 20th century and being replaced.”\n\nSimilar vibes: Patel even channeled Churchill by telling the Sunday Telegraph’s Gordon Rayner her party is in its “darkest hour.” She, too, will only reveal her position on the ECHR or immigration caps “in due course.”\n\nLoads more of this to come: Clearly not having had enough morning rounds, Mel Stride has told the Telegraph “the more [TV debates], the better.” Erk! The Sun on Sunday’s Kate Ferguson reported that broadcasters have already contacted the six hopefuls … but that CCHQ says the request will only be considered after the summer.\n\nSpare some change? The Mail on Sunday’s Anna Mikhailova reckons CCHQ has told each camp to raise £200,000 if they reach the final two candidates to, er, help pay for the contest itself. Playbook is told it’s on the money. “The party’s broke and it’s not going to raise significant funds until the leadership contest is over,” one person told your author.\n\nTODAY IN WESTMINSTER\n\nPARLIAMENT: On the sun lounger.\n\nBREAKING AMERICA: Still fresh from telling us last week that there’s no money left, Rachel Reeves will jet across the Atlantic this morning for a three-day trip to New York and Toronto. The chancellor is due to be promoting Britain’s Oct. 14 investment summit (announced over the weekend) … meeting Wall Street leaders … hosting a reception about women in finance … and, as the Times first reported last week, enjoying a one-on-one dinner with Stephen Schwarzman, the billionaire boss of private equity firm Blackstone. The Sun’s Ryan Sabey has a swift preview.\n\nPlenty of questions: The Sun, FT and Times have been invited along, so expect the customary “huddle” lines to drop at some point — along with interviews in U.S. media, including Bloomberg TV at 10.45 p.m. U.K. time. After she admitted tax rises may be needed in the autumn budget, perhaps they’ll ask Reeves about murmurings in the Sunday Times long read that she could raise money by reforming pension tax relief. Or simply whether the “black hole” her officials found in the public finances was really the shock she claims it was. IFS Director Paul Johnson has a plague on both their houses op-ed in today’s Times saying neither Reeves nor Hunt comes out of this smelling of roses.\n\nAsk this too? There’s been a fair bit of pick-up of a big piece by Bloomberg’s Philip Aldrick that noted Reeves was refusing to recommit to a pledge not to tweak her debt target (which currently says it should fall as a share of the economy in five years). Changing it on some dry technical level could allow the government to borrow more dough. The Treasury said “the chancellor has said her commitment to the robust fiscal rules outlined in the manifesto is non-negotiable” … but spending framework reforms are being prepared ahead of the budget. Hmm.\n\nOr ask this? There’s criticism of the decision to shelve the 2025 cap on social care costs from former Blair minister Norman Warner, who tells the i’s Ben Gartside it is “highly misguided.” He adds: “I’m staggered that it seems to be felt to be acceptable just to change your mind.”\n\nSEND HELP: Reeves should look away from the Guardian, which has an interview with Local Government Ombudsman Amerdeep Somal warning there isn’t enough money to serve children with special educational needs. Saturday’s Times similarly reported concerns among ministers about soaring demand and a black hole in council finances.\n\nNOT WESTMINSTER BUT: The U.K. pulled embassy workers’ families out of Lebanon on Sunday over fears of a wider regional war as two Royal Navy ships and RAF helicopters remain on standby. An FCDO spokesperson said the government was “deeply concerned with the highly volatile security situation” in Beirut, where Israel killed a senior Hezbollah commander, and urged British citizens to leave (ditto the U.S., Saudi Arabia, France, Canada and Jordan). One to watch closely as the week unfurls.\n\nSHRINKING THE BLOB: The Cabinet Office could be scaled back from around 10,000 officials to as few as 1,500 under proposals studied by ministers, my colleagues Tim Ross and Mason Boycott-Owen report. The aim is to reverse the Tory-Lib Dem coalition’s attempt to centralize “back office” operations across government, which created “vast amounts of extra bureaucracy and duplication,” argues one person familiar with the overhaul.\n\nBLOW OUT: Ministers plan to double the threshold at which onshore wind turbines need an enhanced planning process, and triple the threshold for solar farms, reports the Times’ Steven Swinford. You can hear the sharp intakes of breath in middle England from here.\n\nSTRIKE OUT: Whitehall departments will be told this week to ignore the Tories’ (never-used) law on “minimum service levels” during strikes, ahead of a promised full repeal later this year. A letter to departments is due to go out on Tuesday from Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds and Deputy PM Angela Rayner. The Observer’s Michael Savage reported it first and the Mail on Sunday had plenty of Tory fury.\n\nWHAT THE LIB DEMS WANT TO TALK ABOUT: Almost eight in 10 dog owners say they’ve put off letting their pet swim in British seas because of untreated sewage — with similar numbers for the humans themselves, says a Savanta poll for the party. More in the Indy.\n\nNICE WORK IF YOU CAN GET IT: Lobbying and comms firms are offering lavish pay deals to Labour advisers who missed out on a place in government, some tell the FT’s Rafe Uddin.\n\nLAMMY RAMMY: Donald Trump’s son Eric has popped over to Scotland and told the Telegraph David Lammy’s comments about his dad were “dumb crap.” The foreign secretary, of course, infamously called the former U.S. president “a woman-hating, neo-Nazi-sympathizing sociopath” when he was a backbencher. “Love for country transcends a nonsense voice that wants to be clickbait,” says Trump Jr. Takes one to know one, and all that.\n\nFROM RUSSIA WITH MENACE: British soldiers have been warned about Russian spies flying drones over military bases to get information about Ukrainian troops the U.K. is training. The Times’ George Grylls has picked up on the detail from a Field Army Threat Handbook published last October.\n\nREPORTS OUT TODAY: Brexiteer economist Gerard Lyons has a CPS paper saying Labour shouldn’t rejoin the EU’s single market or customs union (obv) … while Consultancy Headland and think tank Demos launch the “British Partnership Council.” Its report claiming the government will have to raise public investment by £27 billion to draw in enough private capital leads the Times business pages.\n\nNOT POLITICS BUT: A Channel 5 documentary reexamining the evidence against convicted killer nurse Lucy Letby airs at 9 p.m., doubtless fuelling more questions about her conviction. Tory MP David Davis (who aired his doubts to the Telegraph’s Daily T podcast last week) is spending the summer investigating the evidence and may raise questions in parliament in the fall. The Tel reported over the weekend that a leaked risk report showed the neonatal unit where Letby worked suffered an outbreak of bacteria lethal to babies.\n\nBEYOND THE M25\n\nHUGE DAY IN D.C.: Kamala Harris is expected by Tuesday to announce her Democratic running mate ahead of the November U.S. presidential election. The Washington Post reports she interviewed at least three finalists Sunday — including Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, who won the swing state by almost 15 points in 2022. Arizona Senator Mark Kelly is also in the running for appealing to another swing state’s independent voters. My Stateside colleagues highlight the top contenders, while a YouGov poll for CBS News put Harris and Trump neck and neck at 50 percent to 49 percent respectively.\n\nBest of pals: Labour General Secretary David Evans will be at the Democratic National Convention in two weeks, according to the Sunday Times. Perhaps Labour’s pals in blue can take some lessons on how to win in a country clouded by disillusionment and disdain.\n\nLESSONS FROM BRUSSELS: Ahead of Eluned Morgan’s confirmation as Wales’ first minister Tuesday, Brussels-dwelling hack Luke James has a decent deep dive for Nation.Cymru about how she was shaped by her 15 years as an MEP … including time served on, er, a sleaze-busting committee. Could be useful, that.\n\nETNA ERUPTS: The eruption of Europe’s tallest volcano Mount Etna forced flights to divert away from Sicily’s Catania airport. The BBC has a great clip of it going up in flames.\n\nWHEELS UP: Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy confirmed his military has started using modern F-16 fighter jets after lengthy negotiations with Western allies. Ukraine has received an undisclosed number of the U.S.-made jets from Denmark and the Netherlands, as my colleague Nicolas Camut writes.\n\nBANGLADESH PROTESTS: Nearly 100 people died and hundreds were injured on Sunday during renewed anti-government protests calling for Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina’s resignation. The protests were initially sparked by a quota system for government jobs, with a curfew now imposed in the capital Dhaka and mobile internet cut off.
