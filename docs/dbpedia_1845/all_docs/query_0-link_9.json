I know of a warrant officer who left the RAF Regiment in the 1970s. Can anyone better that?

        "text": "U.S. Army Sgt. Maj. Jack “Mac” C. McClary Sr. Mac entered military service on Jan. 24, 1944. Mac was a veteran of World War II, the Korean War and the Vietnam conflict, and retired in 1973. 30 years.\n\nA couple with a longer length of service (but not WW2):\n\nWilbur \"Wib\" R. Dias; age 74 died Wednesday, May 12, 2010. He was a Marine Corps veteran serving in both the Korean and Desert Storm Wars and belonged to the V.F.W. Spotswood Post 4589. At least 37 years.\n\nCommand Sgt. Maj. Otto Dillon; Dillon served in the U. S. Army during Korea, Vietnam and Desert Storm. He was awarded the Silver Star, two Bronze Stars, the Cross of Gallantry and five purple hearts. He was a jump master. He served in Korea from 1950 to 1953 and Vietnam for 1965 to 1966. At least 41 years.\n\nAnd two even longer:\n\nLT.Col John Henry Burson; received his commission as a medical officer in the US Army at the end of the Korean War, transferred from active duty to the reserves in the 1960s, and retired in 1984. But, in 2003 he returned to active duty, serving 2 tours in Iraq in 2005 (including providing medical care for Saddam Hussein after his capture) and 2009 (at the age of 74). 55 years (and maybe more).\n\nCol. William Bernhard; joined the Marine Corps in 1950. Bernhard was soon discharged due to a knee injury, which he said was a major disappointment. He joined the Navy as an anesthesiologist and served 10 years on active and reserve duty, then switched to the Army Reserve for many more years. With four military retirements behind him, he just can't stay gone.\n\nThe 79-year-old physician, who is possibly one of the oldest Soldiers on active duty, reported to Fort Benning's CONUS Replacement Center 20 March 2010, prior to leaving for Hohenfels, Germany. Bernhard is a flight surgeon and will be responsible for caring for Soldiers on flight status. 60 years!\n\nNew\n\nAt RAF Cottesmore Air Traffic 1974, my first posting, nearly all controllers were ex WWII aircrew. At the time I didn't really think anything of it but often listened to snippets of what they got up too. Most were Bomber Command and some were Coastal, my favourite though was God himself, the SWO! He was a Polish Master Pilot who flew fighters during the war. I often (intercepted!) him during the weekends walking his Afgan dog on the airfield. There was no rank between us during these discussions and I think he just liked talking to someone who was interested.\n\nAll the senior Officers appeared to have many medal ribbons from the war but sadly my bravery to ask had its limits.\n\nAfter a couple of postings later there were no WWII military staff left to talk too.\n\nAt Boulmer however, in our underground Radar bunker during the late 70s, we had a civil Radar suite with 'Paddy', a WWII SOE Lysander pilot, who did many missions into occupied France.\n\nI wish I could turn the clock back to those days and ask 'the right' questions.\n\nBaz\n\nNew\n\nWhen I first went to Cranwell on Jet Provost Handling Flight in 1974 we had a Chief Tech 'Old Seaboots' who had been in since 1936 and had been in the Desert Air Force. Lots of stories from him, and his usual banter was - \"I was in Baghdad when you were still in yer Dad's bag\"\n\nAlso at Cranwell we had a Flight Sargeant who on seeing a visiting Finnish Air Force VIP DC3 uttered to me whilst we watched it go past - \"I once saw one of them being chased by a Jap Zero\"\n\nAt Lyneham in 1980 we had a Chief who's first job after coming out of training in 1945 was working on Halifaxes that were brought into the hanger at one end, converted into transports/passenger aircraft, pushed outside, taken across the airfield and then burnt! :eek: Please don't ask which airfield it was as I don't know.\n\nNew"
