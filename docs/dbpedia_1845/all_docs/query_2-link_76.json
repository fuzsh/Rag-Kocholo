        "text": "I very much welcome Esmond Birnie’s contribution to this debate on the UK fiscal subvention to Northern Ireland and its implications for a united Ireland.1 It is a thoughtful and considered response, bringing new material to light and helping to focus on the key areas that remain uncertain. [End Page 433]\n\nBirnie’s new material is especially useful in terms of his analysis of the UK subvention, over time and both in constant prices and as a percentage of GDP. He highlights a clear political aspect of the subvention that I had neglected, i.e. the strong growth in the size of the subvention in the immediate post-Good Friday Agreement period. It is clear from his analysis that this growth is related to the election of the Blair Labour government in 1997, with its commitment to a higher level of public spending (at least until the war in Iraq). It is also clear that this growth stalled with the election of the British Conservatives, only growing again during the Covid-19 pandemic. This complex relationship between the subvention, politics and economic performance is interesting.\n\nThere are a few areas where I disagree with his argument, not because we use different data, but rather because we draw different conclusions on the likely future diplomatic and political outcomes.\n\nBirnie accepts that a future united Ireland would have no legal liability for any share of UK public debt, but still goes on to conclude that it is ‘very unlikely that the UK would retain the liability for the interest payments on Northern Ireland’s share of UK public debt’.2 It is a straightforward legal fact that the UK will retain 100 per cent liability for UK public debt in the case of Irish unity. The UK Treasury acknowledged this in Scotland in 2014: even if it wanted a future independent Scotland to agree to make a payment to the UK. We will never know what would have happened in negotiations had Scotland voted for independence in 2014. In the case of a united Ireland, the only issue at stake is whether a government of a future united Ireland would voluntarily agree to take on debt for which everyone accepts it would have no legal liability. Why would it do so unless the UK offered something worth even more?\n\nOn pensions, I think my original article is clear that I do not think there is a compelling legal case forcing the UK to pay future pensions (to anyone). What I do argue is that this will be one of the core arguments in post-referendum negotiations between the Irish and British governments. I argue that it would be politically challenging to walk away from what people perceive to be a pension entitlement. Ending UK pensions for veterans, nurses, etc. would be very politically controversial. The trade union movement would see it as a dangerous precedent, opening the possibility of cancelling pensions for fiscal reasons. Nonetheless, the outcome of talks is uncertain. However, it is [End Page 434] almost impossible to imagine a context in which an Irish government would accept both debt and pension liabilities. In a worst-case scenario where the UK entirely walks away from its pension liabilities—including to veterans, nurses, etc.—an Irish government simply has to do nothing and the UK is left with the totality of its public debt payments.\n\nOn defence, there is now broad political consensus that Irish defence spending will increase by approximately €500m p.a. The Commission on Defence referred to by Birnie did not precisely recommend a tripling of spending.3 It set out three ‘levels of ambition’—the most expensive option requiring expenditure of approximately €3bn pa. No political party has accepted that target. The increase to €1.5bn is very likely to happen and is very likely to be built into Irish public finances well before a referendum is held, meaning that unity will not be the trigger for this additional expenditure, and therefore it will not impact on the inherited subvention.\n\nI accept that many aspects of future expenditure are uncertain, including the attitude of a future government as to what scale of diplomatic service is required, but these are future political choices, not an inherited fixed expenditure.\n\nThere are also areas of additional revenue and savings that my original 2021 article did not include but have been raised in the public debate since then—including as part of debates in Wales and Scotland.4 One aspect of debt I had not considered in my original article is that Ireland’s debt-to-GNI* ratio will drop very considerably if Ireland does not volunteer to take on debt, as GNI* will rise by around 25 per cent and debt will remain static. That would allow a united Ireland to borrow the costs of transition at very favourable interest rates.\n\nThe original article looked at corporation tax, based on work that had been completed at that time, and I accept Birnie’s analysis that such figures alter [End Page 435] up and down depending on the precise time of analysis. Two other aspects of the debate on tax revenues, beyond corporation tax, have received more focus since then.\n\nNorthern Ireland pays a pro-rata contribution (population-based) to the costs of UK central departments and state agencies, which provide UK-wide services. That is normal and many, but not all, of those services would be rebuilt or scaled up in a united Ireland to cover a bigger population and territory. However, such central UK services are overwhelmingly physically based in England, and the taxes paid by those employees are credited to the English region in which the employees work or live (and, unlike expenditure, are not included pro-rata in Northern Ireland’s tax revenue). Based on a detailed analysis caried out by the Sustainable Growth Commission in Scotland, a pro-rata level of saving on central UK costs, which do not require additional expenditure in a united Ireland, along with a boost to Irish tax revenues from the tax paid by the transfer of staff to Ireland (or hiring of new staff to replace them) for which Northern Ireland is already paying the salary cost in the published subvention figures, would see taxation increase by approximately £204m a year, and costs fall by €136m. The effect of these two adjustments is to reduce the relevant subvention by approximately £340m a year.5\n\nResearch by Mike Tomlinson explored the impact of Northern Ireland joining the existing tax and social security system of the Republic of Ireland.6 Tomlinson was not advocating an unchanged system. He was simply looking at the consequences for individuals and for state revenue. Tomlinson estimated that the average employee at every income level up to the 70th decile (i.e. all workers except the 30 per cent highest earners) would have between €12 and €19 per week in additional take home pay—primarily due to lower social security/PRSI payments on low to middle income earners. However, the state would still collect €769m more income p.a. due to higher taxes on higher earners and greater employer contributions to social security. These two tax adjustments would reduce the deficit in Northern Ireland by approximately £1bn p.a.\n\nBirnie argues that the subvention is more than a ‘symptom of weakness’. I accept that, and certainly do not advocate public spending cuts to reduce it. [End Page 436] The need for a regional subvention is, however, a reflection of a weak Northern Ireland economy. Without a subvention, public services and standards of living would have been much worse. However, the evidence that high public spending and fiscal deficits reduce GDP or quality of decision-making is very mixed, to say the least. Scandinavian economies have for long periods (but I accept not always) combined much higher public spending as a percentage of GDP with high-quality decision-making. Northern Ireland’s public expenditure is not too high, based on needs. Its (private sector) economic performance is very weak, and therefore the tax base is very low, providing insufficient revenue for public services. On public spending, the percentage of public spending paid on benefits is similar to the Republic, but in Northern Ireland a very low level of benefit is paid to a very high number of people on low incomes. In the South, a higher rate of pension and benefit is paid to fewer people—as a much higher proportion of the population is earning a decent income.\n\nBirnie is correct, I think, in his analysis that a government of a united Ireland would feel under huge pressure to deal with weaknesses in public services and would not cut benefits or spending. If devolution is maintained in Northern Ireland, it will theoretically be possible to keep different health and welfare systems, though in my view that would be a bad idea and politically challenging. Indeed, in a united Ireland benefits would be very likely to increase, immediately as a show of support, and then more gradually as the cost of living between the two parts of the island converged, and the economy grew.\n\nIn the longer run, however, improved standards of living and public services will only be maintained in a growing economy, with a tax and welfare policy focused on equality. Bergin and McGuinness, and Tomlinson, have demonstrated that despite its many weaknesses in the tax and welfare policy, the Republic delivers much more equal outcomes for society.7\n\nIn terms of economic development, Birnie focuses on the impact of joint marketing of tourism and foreign direct investment (FDI), questioning their impact and pointing to some joint marketing activity that is already taking place. In fact, though this was only briefly touched on in my original article, improved marketing of FDI is in my view the least important factor in trying [End Page 437] to model economic change post-unity. There is a lot more work to do comparing FDI trends North and South—some of it currently underway. However, there is some evidence—certainly enough to encourage further research—to suggest that the key factors explaining the lack of a positive improvement in the economy, in Northern Ireland compared to the Republic, are political stability, education levels and investment. Post-2016 Brexit has added to the problems in the North’s economy. At the time of the Good Friday Agreement, productivity levels per worker were very similar North and South; by 2020, even after allowing for the distorting impacts of multinationals on the Republic’s economy, productivity per worker was 40 per cent higher in the South than in Northern Ireland.8\n\nIf education, investment and political stability are the key explanations for the very large gap in FDI between North and South, and are also responsible for the widening North–South gap in productivity, wages and living standards, why would Northern Ireland, post-unity, with the same or similar policies, perform much worse than, for example, Cork and Kerry? Other positive factors that are very likely to take place include a growth in tourism income, to reflect the much higher levels in the South, and a more balanced regional development in the North-West. Of course there are also likely to be benefits from Northern Ireland immediately rejoining the European Union, including the single market for services and the Common Agricultural Policy. If Northern Ireland’s overall economic performance matched that of the Republic (or even that of the Cork and Kerry region) as measured by productivity, salary levels, employment levels and FDI, the increased tax revenues would radically change the public finances of ‘Northern Ireland’. Beyond the detail of the subvention, that was my core argument. We need to focus less on the subvention and more on the reasons why the Northern Ireland economy has become progressively poorer, compared to the South (or to European averages), in the period since the Good Friday Agreement, and whether an all-island economy would do better. We cannot predict the future, but it is hard to think of compelling arguments as to why the same policy mix in the two parts of the island, post-unity, would see Northern Ireland’s economy continue to perform poorly by comparison with the South.
