Medley, Cap badge : the story of four battalions of The Bedfordshire and Hertfordshire Regiment and The Hertfordshire Regiment (TA) (1995): \"It was now 22 May and shelling activity built up during the day. Battalion headquarters [at Avelgem] was heavily shelled but suffered no casualties. In spite of the observation provided by Mont d'Eclus the Germans sent up an observation balloon beyond the range of our anti-tank guns. There was sporadic artillery fire during the morning and sounds of heavy automatic fire away to the right flank. The shelling increased in intensity during the afternoon and \"A\" Company on the left was subjected to a creeping barrage which ranged back and forth for some four hours. A direct hit on one trench had killed Medway, who had distinguished himself earlier by taking a reconnaissance patrol on to the enemy side of the Escaut. The Germans had established a foothold across the Escaut further to the left of the Battalion and 13 Platoon under PSM Wilson was sent to strengthen \"A\" Company. The shelling continued and was now falling in the reserve areas.\" Meikle,\n\nJohn Cunningham\n\n\"Jack\"\n\nSon of Archie Miller Meikle and Emily Meikle, of Monkseaton, Northumberland.\n\nTwin brother of 2nd Lt.

He was deeply kind and humane with no killing instinct, but he would never shrink or fail in a fight. He was one who was never satisfied unless he had given of his best, whether it was in games or his work or war or any other effort.

Inspired by his leadership, his battalion held out until completeiy surrounded by enemy infantry and tanks, causing many casualties to the enemy in men and material. When ordered to withdraw, what remained of his battalion Lieut.-Col. Miller led his headquarters through the enemy, displaying great daring and skill in doing so. The resistance of the Cameron Highlanders prevented the enemy from turning the right flank of the French troops on the Camerons' left. The determined resistance of his battalion was\n\nlargely due to Lieut.-Col. Mliller's powers of leadership and utter disregard for personal safety.\n\n** For conspicuous gallantry in action. He assumed command of two companies,\n\nholding on to an enemy trench with great courage and determination. He set a\n\nsplendid example to his men.

At that time, little was know as to their exact location. Brigade commanders were therefore ordered to decide where they would debouch and to lift the mines. In this task the RE were to give all the help they could. Altogether it was eventually found that no less than fourteen hundred mines would have to be lifted to enable 214 Brigade to break out. By the morning of 14th November, 204 Field Company had picked up a considerable number of these American mines and loaded them on lorries. Major Evill, the Company Commander, decided to dump them near the Custom House on the German border, where 129 Brigade Headquarters was established. The lorries arrived here soon after and No 1 Platoon started unloading them. During the morning Brigadier Mole had a tour of his line. On returning he noticed this unusual activity going on close to his Headquarters and walked over to find out why this particular site had been chosen. As he approached seven hundred mines spontaneously detonated. There was an appalling explosion which blew a crater thirty feet across and five feet deep. No fewer than fourteen men of No1 Platoon were instantaneously killed and Brigadier Mole and six sappers seriously wounded.

James Molesworth (H, 1935)\n\nWilliam Molesworth (H, 1978) pays tribute to his uncle, James Vernon Crispin Molesworth, whose death as a POW in Burma in 1943 at the age of 26 is a reminder of the sacrifice made by the many young Old Cheltonians of his generation. Born 100 years ago, Uncle Jim was the third generation of my family to attend College, following his father, Charles, 10th Viscount Molesworth (H, 1891) and grandfather, Samuel, 8th Viscount Molesworth (First Hall, 1849), the latter a Founder Pupil. After a troubled first term, when he is said to have run away to Dowdesell Reservoir, Jim earned kudos through his prowess at football (1935 XV), rowing and boxing. His time at Hazelwell coincided with the redoubtable John Cedric Gurney (1927-43), whose disdain of boys too young to have fought in the Great War may have prejudiced their relationship, although perhaps the reason partly lay in Jim’s penchant for long bicycle rides with a friend to nearby country pubs! After Sandhurst in 1937, he joined the 2nd Battalion The Duke of Cornwall’s Light Infantry, which in its prenatal existence as the 46th Foot had been the family regiment since the eighteenth century. The pre-war years were good times for a young officer like Jim, with plenty of riding, hunt balls and a King’s Levée. With war declared in September 1939, he did not go with his battalion as part of the initial British Expeditionary Force that immediately crossed to France, only going over in the second wave of March 1940. Since little had happened during the ‘Phoney War’, however, he was still in time to take part in major actions along the Rivers Dyle and Escaut, as well as the final defensive position around Dunkirk, until evacuated in early June 1940. The following month Jim volunteered for Special Service with the newly-formed No. 3 Commando, one of the first units to be so named. Training in utmost secrecy at the Combined Training Centre at Inverary, his posting came through by the end of the year, so that he was able to go on the largescale raid on the Lofoten Islands in Norway in March 1941 (Operation Claymore), when vital components of a German Enigma machine were captured, which eventually led to the cracking of the German code. A return visit at the end of 1941 saw further raids carried out on the island of Vågsøy and port of Måløy (Operation Archery), which involved fierce street fighting. In March 1942 Jim transferred to 142 Commando in India under Major ‘Mad Mike’ Calvert. The latter worked closely with the eccentric Brigadier Orde Wingate as part of the Special Forces element of the legendary Chindits, the pioneers of Long Range Penetration in the jungle. Wingate built up his men – officers included – with gruelling route marches in the unforgiving environment of the Indian jungle, during which there were several casualties to malaria and drowning. The justification for such hazardous training was Operation Longcloth, launched in February 1943, when some 3,200 men crossed into Japanese-held Burma. Their objective was to create havoc in the enemy’s back yard by disrupting his lines of communication and supply, particularly railways, bridges and ammunition depots, as well as harassing the enemy when opportunity arose. Divided into eight columns of 400 men, each column was to be capable of acting independently by weekly supply drops from the air, a novel concept in warfare. Some 1,100 mules, nevertheless, were necessary for heavy weapons, ammunition, bulky radios and medical supplies, also 200 bullocks, 50 dogs of various breeds, and an assortment of horses and elephants. Since his father had bred Channel Island cattle, Jim was placed in overall charge of this Hannibalic assemblage, the likes of which had probably not gone into action with the British army before, nor, one imagines, are ever likely to! With the advantage of surprise, the Chindits at first carried out their acts of sabotage and ambush with little loss. Spurred on by early success, Wingate ordered the brigade deeper into enemy territory. The initial response of the Japanese had been to cut off their road routes, but once they realised they were being supplied by air, they became adept at intercepting these. Inevitably this led to animals being slaughtered for food. Others were put down from injury and sickness, or else freed once beyond serviceable use. Jim’s role as chief muleteer thus lessened to the extent that by March he had become one of Wingate’s liaison officers, running between columns to deliver latest orders and report back. This entailed hazardous treks through dense jungle trails and scrubland, for which good orientation was essential, as even when a destination was only a few miles away, rarely could one travel as the crow flies and using well worn tracks was to be avoided. By this time the Chindits were fighting off more and more Japanese, who were now fully mobilised. The enemy was able to use tanks on the jungle tracks, a threat the Chindits were unable to answer. Besides injury from contact, there were the everpresent risks of louse and disease. Those unable to keep up were simply left behind, although it was sometimes possible to leave them with friendly villagers. Rather than face capture or a lone death, some men requested a coup de grace – an overdose of morphia was the kindest option – or else took their own life. By now, late March, the Chindits had been operational more than six weeks. Most were exhausted, many diseased or suffering hunger and dehydration. They were some 500 miles inside enemy territory, heavily outnumbered and on the wrong side of the Irrawaddy river, which was 3/4 mile wide in places. With little further that could be achieved, Wingate was ordered to pull out. After an attempted re-crossing of the Irrawaddy was stopped by a Japanese patrol on the far bank, he divided his men into small dispersal groups to make their own way back to India. With the offensive role over, the priority was now speed and evasion. They thus stripped down their arms, discarded heavy equipment, and abandoned or ate the remaining animals. Jim was given a party of the highly regarded Burma Rifles and Gurkhas, but these soon ran into difficulties. For many Chindits would become trapped within the pocket of land at the confluence of the Irrawaddy and Shweli, and Jim’s group seems to have been among those compromised. Still fit at time of capture, he later contracted dysentery, was transferred to a prison hospital, but succumbed to his illness in June 1943. The rights and wrongs of Longcloth are still hotly debated. Although valuable propaganda at the time, it achieved little tactically, while those rendered hors de combat, whether through injury, disease, imprisonment or death, may have been as high as 80% of the brigade. Ultimately, any assessment must take account of the controversial figure of Wingate himself, who has been variously hailed as military genius who paved the way for all future jungle operations, or dangerous maverick with profligate disregard for men and resources. Perhaps he was a little of both. What is agreed by all those who served under him is that he was an inspirational leader of men. For him they pushed themselves to the limit: my uncle was one of them.
