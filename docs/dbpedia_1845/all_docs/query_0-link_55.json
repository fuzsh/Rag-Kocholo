        "text": "European Area President, Air Marshal Philip Sturley (Retd)\n\nI had a full career in the RAF for 37 years. I was born in Kiltimagh, Co. Mayo. When we were young, we moved to England. I went to a really good Jesuit school. Part of joining that school we had to join the cadets. I joined the Air Cadets and fell in love with flying. My mother wanted me to be a priest. She gave me her blessing to join the RAF. I was the only person in my family to join the military. I flew fighters for most of my career. My family was in quite a hard way. My father died when I was about 14 and I nearly had to leave school. The RAF gave me a scholarship. It was both to stay in school and to go on to university.\n\nAt Southampton University I studied aeronautics and astronautics engineering. While there I flew the Chipmunk, which was the basic trainer at the time. I spent three years thereafter which I received my commission in 1972 and then went on to RAF Cranwell where I flew the jet Provost. Following that I went up to up to\n\nValley for advanced fighter training on the Hawker Hunter. From Chipmunk to Provost and then the Hunter is incredible considering what they do now.\n\nMy first tour was with the F4 Phantom at RAF Coningsby where we did a lot of detachments to Germany. You must remember this was the time of the Cold War. My job as a fighter reconnaissance pilot was to watch out for the Russians along the border. I did several tours there and ended up commanding No. 2 Squadron. I went on then to get promoted and do several staff jobs. I came back to fighters flying the Tornado and commanded RAF Cottesmore in Rutland in 1992. In 1998, I was appointed Air Officer Commanding No. 38 Group, Assistant Chief of the Air Staff in 2000, and Chief of Staff to the Air North Commander in 2003 before retiring in 2005.\n\nDuring all of this I learned to become a glider pilot. The RAF have a very strong glider training programme. This has become a passion of mine, particularly racing gliders. I go every year to the Alps and to the Andes in Chile. When you are flying with your unit you don’t have time for sport flying. Gliding is great fun. In my career I’ve flown a total of 110 different types of aircraft. The famous Royal Navy pilot, Captain Eric Melrose ‘Winkle’ Brown, achieved over 400 types.\n\nAfter I retired, I served as President of the Royal Air Force Association for six years. The RAFA is the largest single service charity within the British Armed Forces. It is aimed at people in need who have served in the RAF. If they need help the RAFA is there for them and increasingly people need help. When you think of it at the end of the Second World War there were a million people in the RAF. We have estimated that there are a couple of million people who have served at some stage in the RAF. As the population ages they will need at some stage help. It may be simply in need of a friend and keeping in touch.\n\nThe RAFA is a vast family. As you can see from this conference there are members here from all over the European area. They are all here this weekend to discuss, how best to do well by our people. It is important to remember you don’t have to be a member of the RAFA to benefit from its services. All you have to do is to have served. We want people to be members and get involved in the activities and make them feel wanted. An important initiative these days is what we call ‘befriending’. This is having somebody in each area that goes out and checks that those on their own are all right. Beside the financial burdens, loneliness can be one of the biggest problems for people. Typically, you find people are too proud to admit they need help, so we have to keep an eye out for them.\n\nWe have been lucky over the years with the calibre of people it has recruited. Having a network of branches throughout the United Kingdom and abroad means we have an extensive network that can reach out to the larger family. The Royal Air Force is coming up to 100 years. By that time, I will be in the service for 50 years, half of its life. We are very proud of our history. Although we are the youngest of the services when you look at our performance in that time and even today, the RAF is the service of choice. Whether it by deployments to deal with crisis in Syria or Iraq, or the gales and floods in the Caribbean, it is the air force that gets there first."
