        "text": "DESERT AIR FORCE DOGFIGHTERS\n\n3 Squadron's Leaders, Aces and Notable Flyers...\n\nAIR VICE MARSHAL Ian D. McLACHLAN. DFC, MiD.\n\nAs Commanding Officer of 3 Squadron when it sailed to the Middle East in July 1940, through until February 1941, McLachlan played a significant part in forming it into a very effective Fighter Squadron in the face of many formidable problems. McLachlan was awarded the DFC in 1941 for determined leadership and outstanding military achievements. He was the first RAAF fighter pilot to be decorated in WW2.\n\nPeter Jeffrey said that Ian McLachlan's period of command was very successful; much of the positive work he did and the difficulties he met and overcame were not generally understood and appreciated by the Squadron members. In order to put the record straight, Peter made the following comments:\n\n\"3 Squadron left Australia as an Army Co-op Squadron and just prior to sailing, a number of permanent airmen were posted away and replaced by new personnel. Both Squadron Leaders McLachlan and Peter Heath, who lost his life early in the war, were trained as Army Co-op pilots and not as \"fighter pilots\" and as Senior Permanent Air Force Officers. Neither did a lot of flying (in fact not too many Permanent Officers did a lot of flying). Consequently, neither was fully trained for the Squadron's active Desert Air Force role (i.e. that of a Fighter Squadron).\n\nWhen 3 Squadron was transhipped at Colombo, from the Orontes to the Dilwarra, the accommodation on the Dilwarra for the other ranks was unsatisfactory. After much representation and argument, McLachlan was able to have the O.R.s moved to the next deck, which was Sergeants' accommodation and the Sergeants etc. shared the Officers' Deck.\n\nOn reaching the Middle East the Squadron was without aircraft and the ground staff were posted to many R.A.F. units. McLachlan quickly realised this could be disastrous and brought all members back under his command and obtained aircraft. Firstly, there were Lysanders and Gauntlets and when these proved unsatisfactory, he pressed for and obtained Gladiators. He then set about reorganising the Squadron by having 2E and 2A Fitters transferred into workshops for maintenance duties and Flight Mechanics and Flight Riggers posted to the Flights to service the aircraft. This allowed much greater flexibility in movement and the basis of the Squadron's considerable mobility.\n\nHe found out, from the R.A.F., the cost of running a Gladiator Squadron and after deductions for rations (obtained from the A.I.F.) and the pay for the personnel, he notified Headquarters the cost of operating 3 Squadron. It was soon realised that Gladiators were not front-line fighters and he pushed to have them replaced by Hurricanes - and had 3 Squadron refitted with them, ahead of a number of R.A.F. Squadrons.\n\nMcLachlan was a splendid administrator, a strong negotiator with a positive attitude, who would not ask, but would advise Headquarters and Air Board that he had done such and such because... And he invariably got away with it! As well as having to contend with Air Board and R.A.F. Middle East, he had tussles with 6th Div. A.I.F. who wanted to control 3 Squadron.\n\nDespite many difficulties, 3 Squadron performed notably in the 1st Libyan Campaign and ably supported 6th Div. A.I.F., not as an Army Co-op but as a Fighter Squadron.\"\n\nBy 14 February 1941, Peter Jeffrey said: \"all the establishment hard-work had been done,\" when he took command of a very efficient and mobile Fighter Squadron, with all sections capably led by officers who knew exactly what to do:- viz. Harry King, Adjudant; Bert Boddison, Engineering Officer; Bill Maclnnes, Equipment Officer.\n\nAt this time, Hurricane aircraft were arriving to replace the Gladiators. Peter Jeffrey claimed that: \"because of this organising, 3 Squadron was able to carry out the successful retreat from Benghazi to Egypt.\"\n\nAIR COMMODORE Gordon Henry STEEGE, DSO, DFC, MiD.\n\nBeginning his flying training at Point Cook at the age of 19 years, Steege graduated in 1938 as a Pilot Officer, and had been on service in the Middle East for nine months when he was first decorated.\n\nSquadron Leader Gordon Steege, of North Sydney, gained his D.F.C. in recognition of his daring and fierce determination in leading his flight against enemy formations. At the time of the award, April 1941, Steege had destroyed at least seven enemy aircraft. He had taken a notable part in the Libyan air operations, and his flight had had some outstanding successes. On several occasions he had launched attacks on hostile formations, breaking them up and inflicting serious losses.\n\nSteege remained in the RAAF after the war, rising to the rank of Air Commodore.\n\nGordon was guest of honour in 2010 at the 70th anniversary of the Squadron's \"Marching off to War\" from Richmond RAAF Base in 1940.\n\nSadly, Gordon died in September 2013. The multi-faceted story of his life is is now detailed in our 'Lifetimes' section.\n\nFLIGHT LIEUTENANT John Rowley PERRIN. DFC, MiD.\n\nThe second pilot in 3 Squadron to be decorated was Flight Lieutenant John (Jock) Rowley PERRIN. Perrin was the leader of a formation of three fighters on patrol near Mersa el Berga when he noticed bombs bursting on the ground, and saw nine Stukas dive-bombing and strafing our troops. He called up the others in his formation, but was apparently misunderstood. At all events, after a careful look round for possible escorting fighters, Perrin dived on the Stukas, accompanied by only one of his companions.\n\nAs the pair dived, they were attacked by 15 Messerschmitt 110s which Perrin had not seen, and Perrin's companion was shot down. Perrin bagged one of the Stukas and a Messerschmitt before a cannon-burst in his petrol tank set his aircraft on fire and slightly wounded Perrin.\n\nIn spite of fire and wound, Perrin continued to attack the enemy until he had exhausted his ammunition. He then crash-landed in the desert. As he staggered from his burning aircraft, half blinded with oil and blood, he was machine-gunned by the pilots of the Messerschmitts which continually dived at him as he made a desperate dash for the shelter of a tree.\n\n\"It was the fastest 100 yards I have ever run,\" he said jokingly later, \"and when I barged into that tree in my haste, I saw stars by the thousand.\"\n\nThe citation to the immediate award of the D.F.C. granted Perrin for this incident stated that his determined leadership and bravery in the face of vastly superior enemy forces, and his bearing after the combat had had a very beneficial effect on the morale of the remainder of the squadron.\n\nPerrin was picked up by a patrol car and taken to Benina aerodrome and a hospital. A little later, during the withdrawal of the British forces across Cyrenaica he was again in action.\n\nPerrin made three applications for a short service commission in the R.A.F. between 1935 and 1938 before he was accepted by the R.A.A.F. He entered Point Cook in July 1938, and upon graduation a year later, was posted to 3 Squadron. He was 24 years old when he gained his D.F.C.\n\nGROUP CAPTAIN Peter JEFFREY. DSO, DFC, MiD(2).\n\nTwenty-two year old Peter Jeffrey joined the RAAF in 1935, well before the outbreak of war. He was posted (ranked Flight Lieutenant) to the desert in 1940 with 3 Squadron RAAF as Signals Officer. In February 1941, as a Squadron Leader, he became Commanding Officer of 3 Squadron.\n\nOn 15 April 1941, he shot down one of four JU52s that were landing and then destroyed three more on the ground.\n\nAt this time, he was flying Hurricane QS-J. For energetic and capable leadership, he received the DFC in 1941. In June 1941 he shot down a JU88 bearing Italian markings, and two days later a Martin 167 bomber of the Vichy Air Force.\n\nHe was later promoted to a Wing Leader uniting 112 Squadron RAF and 3 Squadron into a Wing; he handed over 3 Squadron to Squadron Leader Alan Rawlinson on 10 November 1941. On 22 November 1941, he was shot down but managed to return to base. On the 25 November he shot down a Bf 110 with three other pilots. On 30 November, he landed his Tomahawk in the desert, discarded his parachute to make more space for Sergeant Tiny Cameron, a downed 3 Squadron pilot (and the largest man in the Squadron!) and flew safely back to base sitting on Cameron's lap. This happened just a few days before he was awarded the DSO.\n\nIn March 1942, he was appointed Commanding Officer of 75 Squadron RAAF, later handing the Squadron over to J. F. Jackson. He spent time as an Instructor in Townsville and Mildura with No.2 OTU and at one stage, replaced Clive Caldwell as Wing Leader of 1 RAAF Wing at Darwin.\n\nPeter Jeffrey left the RAAF as a Wing Commander in 1946 and became a farmer and grazier until he re-joined the RAAF in 1951. In 1954, he was involved in the Woomera rocket trials. He then became CO of Edinburgh Airfield until he left the RAAF in April 1956. He passed away 6 April 1997, aged 83.\n\n[See also Peter's Australian War Memorial historical interview.]\n\nGROUP CAPTAIN Alan RAWLINSON OBE, DFC & Bar, AFC.\n\nAlan Rawlinson was born in Fremantle, W.A. on 31 July 1918. He obtained a private pilots licence in 1937 flying DH60 Gypsy Moths. Enlisting in the RAAF in 1938 he graduated as a Pilot Officer in 1939 obtaining a posting to 3 Squadron at Richmond, N.S.W. At the time he was flying Hawker Demons.\n\nAt the outbreak of World War II he was sent to the Western Desert with 3 Squadron. From September 1940 to April 1941 he saw combat flying Gauntlets, Gladiators, Hurricanes, Tomahawks and Kittyhawks. From May 1941 to August 1941 he was stationed at Cyprus and returned to the Western Desert in August 1941, later serving as CO of 3 Squadron.\n\nHe was awarded the DFC and Bar during his service in the desert. He returned to Australia in 1942 as Chief Flying Instructor at Mildura. In 1943 he was promoted to Squadron Commander and Wing Leader and saw further service in the Pacific region. He again returned to Australia in 1944 and was Commanding Officer of paratroop training.\n\nIn 1947 Alan transferred to the RAF as a Squadron Commander and Wing Leader, flying jet aircraft such as Vampires and Meteors. Alan remained in the RAF until he retired in 1961. During the period from 1963-1969 he was involved in missile testing at Woomera.\n\nAlan retired to Crafers in the Adelaide Hills. During his flying career he flew some 53 different types of aircraft, from bi-planes to supersonic jets.\n\n[See also our story: Blackie and Blondie's War.]\n\nSQUADRON LEADER John Francis JACKSON. DFC. MiD.\n\nJohn Francis (\"Old John\") Jackson, of St George, Queensland, enlisted in the R.A.A.F. in 1939 and was awarded the D.F.C. in 1942 as a Flight Lieutenant , for his combat success with 3 Squadron. He had been a member of 3 Squadron since December 1940, and had been in operations in Egypt, Libya, Syria, and for a short period in Cyprus. He had always shown marked keenness and determination and was an outstanding Flight Leader. In April 1941, he attacked a force of enemy bombers which was harassing Australian troops and shot down three of the attackers. He destroyed eight enemy aircraft during his time with 3 Squadron.\n\nAfter serving a full tour of duty in the Middle East with 3 Squadron, Jackson returned to Australia and then assigned to lead the hurriedly-formed 75 Squadron with their Kittyhawk fighters to Port Moresby, Papua. There they successfully challenged the might of the Japanese air fleets that were attacking this vital Allied frontline base.\n\nOver Port Moresby, John Jackson led his squadron in furious aerial battles to defend the town and he also led successful pre-emptive raids on the Japanese airstrip at Lae on the north coast of New Guinea. On 10 April 1942, he was shot down and ditched in the ocean near Lae, but evaded capture after swimming ashore and recruiting the help of two friendly natives. His native saviours guided him over the towering jungle-clad mountain ranges to the Australian outpost at Wau. Jackson was then flown back to Port Moresby, where he resumed leadership of his Squadron.\n\nHe died in tragic circumstances soon after, on 28 April 1942. 75 Squadron was down to their last few aircraft and Jackson tutored his pilots to use the speed of their Kittyhawks to dive through the Japanese formations in 'hit and run' attacks, and not to try to dogfight with the superlative Japanese Zero fighters. Senior RAAF officers (Garing and Gibson) visiting Moresby criticised this tactic and incensed Jackson's pilots by calling them 'dingoes' [meaning cowards]. The next day, John Jackson, an ace pilot and a genuine hero, was shot down while attempting to show just how difficult it was to dogfight the Zeroes in a Kittyhawk. He was one of 12 Australian pilots from 75 Squadron who lost their lives during their 44 days defending Port Moresby.\n\n[Also see our book feature about \"Old John\" Jackson.]\n\nWING COMMANDER R. H. (Bobby) GIBBES. DSO, DFC and Bar.\n\nBobby Gibbes became a legend in his own lifetime. He served with 3 Squadron in the Western Desert where he fought with great skill and determination. Over the period of his service in the desert, Bobby scored 10.25 kills, which made him a 'double ace'. A superb pilot and a natural leader, he became Commanding Officer of the Squadron during February 1942, one of its busiest and most difficult periods.\n\nHis Kittyhawk fighter always carried a motif, designed by his mother, of a kangaroo kicking a German \"sausage\" dog. Bobby always flew CV-V.\n\nHe returned to Australia in April 1943 after having served in the desert for well over twice the usual time of a normal Middle East tour of duty. He later served in Darwin as second in command of No 80 Fighter Wing.\n\nAfter the war, he established businesses in New Guinea but always carried on his career in aviation. For many years he was a well-known international aviation figure, residing at Collaroy, a beach-side suburb of Sydney.\n\n[Further articles on many of Bobby's exploits can be found in our Tribute Article\n\nand his frank and lucid view-points can be found on our Stories Page.]\n\nWING COMMANDER Andrew (\"Nicky\") BARR. OBE, MC, DFC and Bar.\n\nNicky Barr, a star International Rugby player, arrived in England when World War II broke out. He returned to Australia, joined the RAAF and graduated as a Pilot Officer in September 1940. In October 1941, he was posted to 3 Squadron in the Middle East and soon displayed his skill in the Tomahawk and Kittyhawk fighters. In his first 35 operational hours, Barr flew 22 missions, engaged in 16 combats and destroyed eight enemy aircraft. He quickly rose through the ranks to become Squadron Leader.\n\nOn 11 January 1942, during an attempt to rescue a fellow pilot he was shot down, which resulted in a 25-mile walk back to base. On 26 June 1942, he was shot down for the third time, but this time captured. As a consequence, he spent a long period in Italian P.O.W. camps as well as enemy hospitals. He made three unsuccessful escape attempts and then on the fourth occasion, enroute to Germany by train, he escaped and joined an Allied Special Airborne Services unit in which he operated for eight months and helped fellow POWs to escape.\n\nFor services behind the lines in Italy he was awarded the Military Cross.\n\nIn October 1945, after five years of service, Nicky Barr left the RAAF with a final tally of 12½ enemy aircraft destroyed.\n\nNicky Barr earned a reputation amongst allies and enemies alike for his acts of bravery, his selflessness, his dogged determination and his infectious sense of humour. Considered by all to be a great pilot and a true legend.\n\n[See also our story \"Nicky Barr Shot Down\".]\n\nFLIGHT LIEUTENANT Cecil (\"Tiny\") CAMERON, DFM and Bar\n\nMsus, Libya - 8 Jan 1942. Sergeant A. C. \"Tiny\" CAMERON, of 3SQN [right],\n\nwith Sergeant I. A. LYONS. [AWM 023107]\n\nPosted to 3 Squadron R.A.A.F. in May 1941, Sergeant \"Tiny\" (Cec) Cameron's natural popularity was quickly enhanced by his beloved mascot, a cute monkey called \"Buzz\" who once flew as an unofficial co-pilot with Tiny. [Only once! As the nervous monkey started clicking random switches in the cockpit!]\n\nShortly after he joined the Squadron, the Syrian campaign developed. Tiny along with other members of the squadron took an active part. In fact, Tiny and his close mate, Derek Scott (Scotty) - another pilot with whom he shared eventual incarceration in Lamsdorf - on the signing of the Armistice in Syria, were sent in to occupy Bierut Aerodrome on behalf of the Squadron.\n\nAfter completion of hostilities in Syria, the Squadron was transferred to the Libyan Campaign and took an active part in opposing the Luftwaffe, and it was not long before Tiny accounted for his first victim. Shortly after, he became a victim himself and was shot down, but became part of Air Force history when he was picked up by Squadron Leader Peter Jeffrey, who landed beside the crash site, squeezed Tiny into his cockpit and brought him back to the Squadron. This was quite an achievement as Tiny was 6ft 4in (193cm) and it was a single seater aircraft.\n\nAbout a month later, after scoring two more victories, Tiny was again shot down and according to all reports, had crashed with his aircraft and had not survived. Five days later, he returned with an Army unit to his squadron, much to everyone's surprise and delight. Tiny went on to claim four more victories before he was again shot down on 10 January 1942. He became a prisoner of war. Coincidentally, on this date, he was awarded the D.F.M. for outstanding devotion to duty and for his score of 5 enemy aircraft shot down. He was subsequently transported to Italy where he remained in a P.O.W. camp until the Italians surrendered in 1943 when he was transported to Germany.\n\nHe and others were force-marched across Germany and half way back again before being released at Halle on 8 May 1945, when he was told of his retrospective commission as a Flight Lieutenant.\n\nFLIGHT LIEUTENANT Wilfred S. (\"Woof\") ARTHUR, DSO, DFC, MiD.\n\nFlight Lieutenant Wilfred Stanley ARTHUR started 1942 well for 3 Squadron by adding his D.F.C. to its mounting tally. A Queenslander, Arthur was 22 when he gained the award. He joined the Permanent Air Force a day after war was declared, and was posted to the Squadron in March 1940 as a Pilot Officer, becoming Flying Officer in the following September, and Flight Lieutenant in October 1941.\n\nHis D.F.C. was awarded for great gallantry in operations. On one occasion under difficult weather conditions, he was leading a flight over Bir el Gobi when a large formation of enemy aircraft was encountered. Arthur immediately shot down two Stukas, and was then attacked by enemy fighters. His own engine was hit, but before this had happened, he had shot down one of the enemy fighters. Turning away his damaged aircraft from the fight, Arthur shot down an Italian Macchi 200, making his day's total four.\n\nHe went on to finish the war with 10 victories, 6+ he scored in No.3 Squadron.\n\n[See also our article on Woof's \"No Ammo\" DSO in the Pacific, and his interview about the \"Morotai Mutini\" on our AWM page.]\n\nSERGEANT Rex Kerslake WILSON, DFM.\n\n[Killed in action 9 December 1941.]\n\nAlready considered to be an 'ace' after destroying seven enemy aircraft, Rex Wilson was one of the nine Squadron pilots who took off at 1035 hours in their Tomahawks on that fateful day to sweep the Tobruk-El Gobi area.\n\nThey were surprised by six Bf 109s who bounced them out of the sun. Three Tomahawks went down and two more were damaged but stayed on to fight. Both Rex and Flying Officer David Rutter were in two of those which went down and both were killed. The third was piloted by \"Tiny\" Cameron who eventually crash-landed and managed to return to the Squadron three days later.\n\nRex had already been recommended for the Distinguished Flying Medal. In January 1945, it was awarded posthumously.\n\nSQUADRON LEADER Frank FISCHER, DFC.\n\nFlying Officer Ken Richards received the DFC for his accurate bombing attack in January 1944 on shipping off the Yugoslavian coast... In fact, he dropped a bomb clean down the funnel of a 3,000 ton enemy vessel with dramatic results!\n\nNear the end of February 1944, he attacked a 5,000 ton merchant ship and his direct hit split the vessel in two.\n\nHis citation included these words: \"This officer has invariably displayed commendable courage and determination, and his accurate bombing has been a noteworthy feature of his efforts throughout.\"\n\nOn 8 March 1945, Ken took over the command of the Squadron from Murray Nash for three months. Murray returned to the Squadron shortly after the war in Europe had ended.\n\nSQUADRON LEADER Rex Howard BAYLY DFC\n\nRex Bayly had already completed a North African desert stint with 3 Squadron (famously being rescued by Bobby Gibbes), and had already earned his DFC in March 1943, by the time he was appointed C.O. of the Squadron - in April 1944 during the Italian Campaign.\n\nThis was a particularly difficult time for flying activities, as the focus of operations was on precision-bombing of enemy supply routes.\n\nHe led the Squadron in one of their most spectacular missions... participating in the 239 Wing bombing attack on the hydro-electric dam on the Pescara River near Chieti. Each of the Squadron's 12 Kittyhawks were loaded with two 500-pounders and one 1,000-pounder. The sluice gates and the adjoining powerhouse were destroyed.\n\nFLIGHT LIEUTENANT Ian Howard ROEDIGER DFC\n\nWhilst on his second operational tour with the Squadron, he was on patrol on 13 May 1944, when ack-ack hit his engine's oil system. Knowing he only had a few minutes before he went down, he still continued on his bombing dive, dropped his load and got back to 6,000 feet when his engine faltered badly. The aircraft lost height rapidly.\n\nHe was at 2,500 feet when he spotted a tiny 200ft (60 metre) strip, so he belly-landed and was able to walk away from the wreck.\n\nSQUADRON LEADER John Carlisle \"Jack\" DOYLE, DSO, DFC and Bar.\n\nJack Doyle's enthusiastic contributions to the Squadron were considerable. Whilst dive-bombing a vital railway bridge in Italy in April 1944, he dropped his 1,000-pounder so low and accurately that shrapnel from the explosion ripped holes in the tail of his Kittyhawk.\n\nAlso, that same April, he, then a Flight Commander, was given temporary command of the Squadron before later being appointed as a liaison Squadron Leader to the Mobile Operations Radio Unit. Whilst in that capacity he was lucky to escape with his life when a time-bomb went off under twenty observers, spotting operational activity from the upstairs of an Italian chateau. Doyle and two others fell three stories through the collapsed floors.
