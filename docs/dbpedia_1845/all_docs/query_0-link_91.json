        "text": "2023 honorary graduates\n\nDon Letts\n\nA London-born artist of Jamaican heritage, Don’s career began in the mid Seventies when he started selling jukeboxes and unique fashion pieces from his store in Kings Road, Chelsea. Acme Attraction soon became famous for its deep dub soundtrack provided by Don’s extensive vinyl collection and its influential following of musicians including The Clash, Sex Pistols, Chrissie Hynde, Patti Smith, Debbie Harry and one of Don’s heroes and friends – Bob Marley. Don was credited as being the DJ that introduced reggae to the emerging punk rock scene and produced a film documenting the revolutionary period ‘The Punk Rock Movie’ in 1977. This laid the foundations for a career as a respected international artist, social commentator and documenter of cultural movements.\n\nDon, who grew up in Brixton, was a co-founder of the highly successful and innovative band Big Audio Dynamite and is seen as a world-leader in creating music which fuses punk, rap and reggae. He has directed more than 300 music videos and made documentaries featuring Gil Scot-Heron, The Jam, Sun Ra, George Clinton and Paul McCartney. In 2003 Don won a Grammy for his documentary ‘Westway to the World’ and in 2007 produced 'Speakers Corner', a contemporary response to the 200th anniversary of the abolition of the British slave trade, in conjunction with the British Arts Council.\n\nDon Letts’s cross-media body of work, inspired by the synergy of ideas, has seen him lauded across the world. He’s been exhibited at The Kitchen New York , The Institute of Contemporary Art, and the National Film Theatre in London, and honoured at both Brooklyn’s BAM festival and The Milan Film festival and recently at the highly acclaimed 2023 Saatchi gallery ‘Beyond the Streets’ exhibition. He hosts his own show Culture Clash Radio on 6 Music. Whatever medium he chooses, Don is driven by a spirit of collaboration and seeks to encourage and promote culture to enrich people’s lives.\n\nLord Mann of Holbeck Moor\n\nLord Mann has always believed in equality and championing transparency in public life. The dedicated trade unionist and Labour activist was elected as MP for Bassetlaw in 2001 and one of his earliest campaigns called for improved treatment of heroin users, who were encouraged to seek treatment from specially trained GPs. As a result, the number of users undertaking treatment in Bassetlaw rose from two to more than 400, and habit related crimes fell by 75 per cent.\n\nLord Mann has also taken a strong stance on tackling racism and from 2004 to 2019 chaired the All-Party Parliamentary Group against Antisemitism. He was later appointed as His Majesty’s Government’s Independent Adviser on Antisemitism (HMGIAA) by Theresa May. Through this role Lord Mann regularly reports to the Secretary of State, relevant Department Ministers and officials to highlight issues from the Jewish Community and update them on the HMGIAA work plan.\n\nUsing his platform as an independent member of the House of Lords, Lord Mann strongly believes that society must remain vigilant to ensure every individual can enjoy freedom from persecution. His work has focused on several areas of civic life in which antisemitism has taken root – including on University campuses. There’s also an international aspect to his role, and earlier in 2023 Lord Mann visited Washington DC where he briefed the US Presidential taskforce at The White House.\n\nMartin Taylor\n\nFollowing a career in senior finance and leadership roles, Martin Taylor worked tirelessly as a member of the Middlesex University Board of Governors and as Director of Middlesex International (Mauritius) Ltd since 2012. He was appointed as an independent co-opted member of the audit committee before joining the full Board as a governor in June 2013. Martin became Deputy Chair of the Board and Chair of both the Finance Committee and the Remuneration Committee in September 2016, and at the same time joined the Board of the Joint Venture covering the Mauritius campus. He stepped down in July 2023, but was pleased to have been asked to join a small group of Pro Chancellors who support the Chancellor and assist with MDX’s wider engagement responsibilities.\n\nMartin has had a distinguished career in business with a focus on finance, management and consultancy work with major companies worldwide, including Inchcape plc, the international automotive distribution and retail Group. At Inchcape he held roles as Chair/Managing Director of Toyota Greece and Toyota Belgium, living in both countries with his family, before becoming CEO Europe, Africa and South America.\n\nMartin then moved on to build a ‘portfolio career’ which includes the use of his background in finance and business to support causes important to him. In particular, in 2012, he became a founding Trustee and Chair of Befrienders Worldwide, now an independent registered charity which previously operated as the international division of Samaritans. Having stepped down after 9 years as Chair, he re-joined Befrienders Worldwide as Trustee and Board Treasurer in November 2021, a position which he continues to hold today. Martin was Chairperson of Befrienders Worldwide, a charity that helps people in emotional crisis or distress, or those close to them, until March 2021. He rejoined the Charity's Board in November 2021 as Treasurer. He was also Chairperson of Infinity Health, a digital platform for health and social care staff, until the end of 2022.\n\nSharon Grant OBE\n\nSharon Grant, OBE, the Chair of the Board of Public Voice, an important social enterprise specialising in community and user engagement in health and social care, has dedicated her life to the causes of social change, inclusivity and cultural opportunity. Sharon has lived in Haringey, North London for over 45 years and her many achievements span a broad spectrum of activities, including contributions to public health, social care, consumer representation, inclusive political engagement and the sponsorship of the arts in her community. Her many skillsets are driven by a single desire to give a voice to all levels of society and create an environment where every individual is given a chance to shine.\n\nSharon started out as a university lecturer in social policy. She moved from academic world to become a local councillor, in Haringey, and then run the parliamentary office of the late Bernie Grant MP, who she later married, standing side-by-side with her husband for over 13 years on his dedicated path to demand change across his Tottenham seat and for overlooked communities across London and internationally. After his death Sharon moved to widen her work, becoming Chair of the Commission for Patient and Public Involvement in Health in 2002-2008, then Chair of London Travelwatch between 2008 and 2012.\n\nOver the same period she worked to achieve her late husband’s dream of an arts centre and in 2007 the £15m Bernie Grant Arts Centre was opened to provide a multi-disciplinary arts and enterprise space, bringing together culturally diverse artists and a gateway to fresh opportunities. Sharon remains a Trustee and Secretary of the Centre, which recently achieved national portfolio funding from the Arts Council. As Chair of Haringey Citizen’s Advice service from 2007-2015, Sharon helped individuals get the help and support they needed, across health, social care and consumer representation. In 2013 she was senior parliamentary advisor for an enquiry into the hospital complaints system. Sharon was awarded the Order of the British Empire in 2014 for services to the arts and the community.\n\nThese are still issues close to her heart as she is currently on the board of the Council of Consumers Association, ‘Which?’. In 2014 she was the founding Chair of Public Voice, a community interest company which aims to make change by listening to those who use public services, and bringing their voice, especially of patients and social care users to policy makers. In this capacity, in recent years Sharon has built a strong relationship with Middlesex University and formalised a promising partnership with Public Voice with a Memorandum of Understanding in 2022. This has led to a collaboration with Middlesex researchers, focusing on the issues that need to be addressed to give marginalised members of the community a platform for change. The goal is to develop a model that translates to communities across the UK and further afield.\n\nBaroness Watkins of Tavistock\n\nIt's no exaggeration to say that Baroness Watkins has had an extraordinary impact on raising the profile and importance of the nursing profession both in the UK and on the international stage. Her career started at the Wolfson School of Nursing, then Westminster Hospital and a period at South London and Maudsley Nursing School, before obtaining her PhD from King’s College London in 1985. It was during these formative years that Mary developed a keen appreciation of the invaluable role nursing plays in the coherent functioning of a caring society.\n\nExcelling in roles across clinical practice, education, research and leadership, Baroness Watkins has spent a lifetime championing healthcare equity for every individual – a cause we are quick to celebrate as it chimes closely with our University’s continuing vision to create healthier communities across the globe. In recognition of her dedication to healthcare, she was created Baroness of Tavistock in 2015 and now sits in the Lords as a crossbencher. 2019 saw her further honoured with a fellowship of The Royal College of Nursing.\n\nWith an indefatigable energy and sense of purpose, it’s no surprise that Mary currently holds a number of pivotal posts that are helping shape and evolve nursing for the demands of the 21st century. As President of the Florence Nightingale Foundation and a visiting professor at the Florence Nightingale Faculty of Nursing, Midwifery and Palliative care at King’s College London, Mary is at the forefront of raising standards across all levels of healthcare. She was also the alternate chair of Nursing Now, which led to her helping produce the World Health Organisation’s important State of the World Nursing report in 2020. This paper significantly raised the profile of nursing, helping the profession form a unified global movement and strengthen its ability to influence international policymakers.\n\nCloser to home, Baroness Watkins has led policy and debate in Parliament to ensure that mental health nursing in England has the support it needs. Support that’s essential to meet the ever growing demands of a healthcare sector that continues to expand with increased knowledge of its complexities. This important work includes a focus on addiction and mental health through a cross-party group on Alcohol Harm and drug use in universities.\n\nProfessor Dame Carol Black\n\nProfessor Dame Carol Black has played many important roles in a multi-layered career as a clinician, scientist, administrator, and reformer. She is very well known for the Centre she established at the Royal Free Hospital in London to generate research and improve treatment of scleroderma (rare but frequently fatal) and other connective tissue diseases. She became President of the Royal College of Physicians of London in 2002, only the second woman to hold that post in the College’s 500-year history, and was made a Dame in 2006. She has been a life-long champion of women in medicine, and a passionate advocate for workplace health as vital to the entire population’s wellbeing and to our sustainable future.\n\nA child of working-class parents, Carol took a degree in History at Bristol before she realised that it was medicine she wanted to pursue, a path by no means smooth. After a year on the Voluntary Service Overseas scheme on islands in the West Pacific Ocean, she came to medicine in Bristol at the age of 25. Following “a light bulb moment” in 2004, Dame Carol developed a growing interest in the social determinants of health, particularly employment and worklessness, and became deeply involved with social aspects of medicine.\n\nAs National Director for Health and Work, she provided independent leadership for a new 5-year-funded cross-government Health, Work and Wellbeing agenda, and authored two influential independent reviews for government, on the health of the working-age population, and on sickness absence in Britain. In 2012 she became an Expert Adviser to the Department of Health, NHS England, NHS Improvement and Public Health England, where she authored an important independent review for government on the employment outcomes of addiction to drugs or alcohol and obesity.\n\nIn 2021, her latest independent review for government, on illicit drugs, provided concrete suggestions for improvement of treatment and recovery from addiction. This has informed a new 10-year anti-drug strategy, adopted and funded by the government, and now being implemented nationally. Today Dame Carol is a special advisor to Universities UK’s Student Drugs Taskforce, with a remit to understand the demand for, and use of, drugs by the nation’s students, focusing on tackling issues around drug use and providing support for recovery and wellbeing.\n\nFor several years Dame Carol has chaired the board of Think Ahead, the fast-track training programme, funded by DHSC, for graduates to become Mental Health Social Workers. Middlesex University is proud to be the academic partner on this much-needed programme, now into its sixth cohort of 160 trainees. Beyond the world of medicine and healthcare, in 2018 Dame Carol was appointed Chair of the board of the British Library. With art and culture being increasingly viewed as important for the mental wellbeing of individuals and wider society, this noble institution could have no more fitting custodian.\n\nPhilippa Perry\n\nPhilippa Perry is an alumna and old friend of the University, having studied Fine Art here in the 1990s and graduating with a 2:1. She also studied at the Metanoia Institute affiliated with Middlesex University and was an examiner for viva examinations for the Integrative Psychotherapy MSc course there for many years.\n\nPhilippa’s journey into the world of psychology began in 1985 when she trained and volunteered for The Samaritans. This gave her experience of the trials and tribulations of the human condition, inspiring her to work in the mental health field for over 20 years as an integrative psychotherapist. She made it her mission to share the wisdom of psychological theories and research to a wider audience and has written and broadcast radio and television documentaries on subjects such as Bipolar Disorder, Humiliation, Desire, Story Telling, Lying, When Parents Split, Surrealist Art and most recently co-presented Grayson’s Art Club which came about to get people making art during the pandemic.\n\nAs well as broadcasting Philippa has written books including Couch Fiction, which combined both art and therapy as it is a graphic novel about psychotherapy, and How To Stay Sane. Her international bestseller The Book You Wish Your Parents Had Read and Your Children Will Be Glad That You Did has sold over two million copies and has helped many households to operate more harmoniously, and supported parents to make the best relationships they can with their children.\n\nThroughout her career there has always been a focus on how an individual’s state of mind permeates and steers everyday life, with practical advice on how we can all work to look after our own – and our loved ones’ – mental health. She has a weekly advice column in the Observer Magazine that continues this work.\n\nBianca Jagger\n\nIn the field of human rights, few have made the long-standing contribution or achieved the lasting influence of Bianca Jagger – a force of nature whose dynamic personality continues to generate effective changes globally. Born in Nicaragua in 1950, Bianca won a scholarship from the French government to study at the prestigious Paris Institute of Political Studies and became fascinated by the forces and movements that shape lives and determine individual outcomes.\n\nIt was here that Bianca first encountered the teachings of Gandhi and his belief in non-violent protest, an introduction to Eastern philosophy which would underpin much of her future thinking. It was, however, Ms Jagger’s mother – discriminated against for being a divorced, working woman in a patriarchal society – who most influenced her outlook of the world. Bianca has shown unwavering commitment to speaking up for women’s rights, campaigning tirelessly to end violence against women and girls, not least to stamp out female genital mutilation.\n\nIn the 70s and 80s Bianca led a well-documented high-profile lifestyle, associating with world renowned figures such as Andy Warhol all the while amplifying the voice of the most vulnerable. A global fashion icon, and mother to daughter Jade from her then marriage to Mick Jagger and a grandmother to Amba, Assisi and Ray and great-grandmother to Ezra, Romy and River, she has never lost sight of social injustices. A number of experiences then firmly set Bianca’s life on a new path, defending victims of human rights violations and fighting to shine a spotlight on communities facing extreme challenges with no voice of their own. Bianca has since used her profile on the world stage to progress the causes she believes in.\n\nIn a 1979 visit to Nicaragua with the International Red Cross and was shocked by the brutality and oppression perpetrated by the Somoza regime. In 1981 Bianca was part of a US delegation to Honduras and came face-to-face with a death squad leading a group of refugees towards the El Salvador border. The delegation felt compelled to intervene and confronted the would-be executors with cries of “You’ll have to kill us all”. In a tense stand-off the squad relented and the captives were released. The world saw how, armed with courage, humanity prevailed. To this day, Bianca has continued to fight for meaningful change.
