He was also appointed Lieutenant Governor of Guernsey in 1803 where he served until 1813. He was also active in Guernsey as Deputy Grand Master of the Freemasons.[3]

Personal life[]

John Doyle was born in Dublin in 1756, the fourth son of Charles and Elizabeth Doyle. He entered Trinity College Dublin in July 1768 to study law, but when his father died in March 1771 he joined the army in March 1771.[5] Doyle was the uncle of women's political rights campaigner Anna Doyle Wheeler who, in 1812, took her daughters to stay with him and his family in Guernsey having walked out on her husband in Limerick.[6]

He then fought at the Battle of Harlem Heights, Battle of Springfield, Battle of Brandywine, and Battle of Germantown (where he was wounded). His wound changed the course of his American campaign because he was appointed to assist Lord Rawdon (Francis Rawdon-Hastings, 1st Marquess of Hastings) to raise the Volunteers of Ireland regiments (aka 2nd American Regiment and the 105th Regiment of Foot), and wherein he was promoted to Captain.

On 17 May 1801, in the Libyan Desert he led his Brigade of the 12th Light Dragoons to capture the French Dromedary Corps. He distinguished himself during the operations leading to promotion to Major-General on 29 April 1802.[1][2]

In 1806 he was presented with the 'Doyle Cup' which has been the property of the Masonic Library and Museum since 1938.
