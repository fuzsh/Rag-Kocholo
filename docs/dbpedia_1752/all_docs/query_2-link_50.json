Turkey[2],\n\nThe European Court of Human Rights, sitting, in accordance with Rule 51 of Rules of Court A[3], as a Grand Chamber composed of the following judges:\n\nMrR. Bernhardt, President,\n\nMrF. Gölcüklü,\n\nMrL.-E. Pettiti,\n\nMrA. Spielmann,\n\nMrS.K. Martens,\n\nMrsE. Palm,\n\nMrR. Pekkanen,\n\nMrA.N. Loizou,\n\nMrJ.M.

Petzold, Registrar, and Mr P.J. Mahoney, Deputy Registrar,\n\nHaving deliberated in private on 29 November 1997 and 25 June 1998,\n\nDelivers the following judgment on Article 50, which was adopted on the last-mentioned date:\n\nPROCEDURE\n\n1. The case was referred to the Court by the Government of the Republic of Cyprus (“the Cypriot Government”) on 9 November 1993, within the three-month period laid down by Article 32 § 1 and Article 47 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”). It originated in an application (no. 15318/89) against the Republic of Turkey (“the Turkish Government”) lodged with the European Commission of Human Rights (“the Commission”) under Article 25 by a Cypriot national, Ms Titina Loizidou, on 22 July 1989.\n\n2. In its judgment of 23 March 1995 the Court dismissed various preliminary objections raised by the Turkish Government but joined to the merits a preliminary objection ratione temporis (Series A no. 310).\n\nIn its judgment on the merits of 18 December 1996 (“the principal judgment”) the Court dismissed the objection ratione temporis and found that the continuous denial of the applicant’s access to her property in northern Cyprus and the ensuing loss of all control over the property was a matter which fell within Turkey’s “jurisdiction” within the meaning of Article 1 of the Convention and was thus imputable to Turkey. It also found that there had been a breach of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 in that the applicant had effectively lost all control over, as well as all possibilities to use and enjoy, her property. However it found that there had been no interference with the applicant’s right to respect for her home under Article 8 of the Convention (Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-VI, pp. 2227–38, §§ 31–66, and points 1–4 of the operative provisions).\n\n3. As the question of the application of Article 50 was not ready for decision, it was reserved in the principal judgment. The Court invited the Turkish Government and the applicant to submit, within six months, their written observations on the matter and, in particular, to notify the Court of any agreement they may have reached (ibid., pp. 2238–39, §§ 67–69, and point 5 of the operative provisions).\n\n4. No agreement having been reached, the applicant and the Turkish Government submitted their memorials on 23 and 24 June 1997. A valuation report, setting out the basis for the calculation of the applicant’s loss, was appended to the applicant’s memorial. The comments of the Delegate of the Commission in reply were received on 28 July 1997.\n\n5. In their memorial the Turkish Government contested the Court’s decision..."
