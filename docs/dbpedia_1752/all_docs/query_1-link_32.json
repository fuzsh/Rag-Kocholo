        "text": "Facts: The appellant commenced judicial review proceedings grounded on a short affidavit by his solicitor in which a number of grounds of challenge were raised, including the contention that his trial should be prohibited on the basis of culpable delay, and that s. 11 of the Criminal Law Amendment Act 1885 was inconsistent with the Constitution on grounds of vagueness, and/or because of alleged impermissible discrimination on the basis of gender. The High Court dismissed those claims, and found it unnecessary to consider the contention raised prominently by the respondents, the Judges of Dublin Circuit Court, the Director of Public Prosecutions, Ireland and the Attorney General, that the applicant lacked locus standi to assert the unconstitutionality of s. 11 of the 1885 Act on the grounds which he did. The Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal, holding that the appellant lacked locus standi to make the case he sought to argue in respect of the alleged repugnancy of s. 11 of the 1885 Act to the Constitution. The court upheld the trial judge’s dismissal of the appellant’s claim on the merits. By a determination issued on 26 October 2017, the Supreme Court granted leave to appeal from the decision of the Court of Appeal. However, the court considered that a number of the issues raised did not satisfy the constitutional threshold for appeal in this case, and accordingly leave to appeal was refused in respect of the claims relating to delay, and the challenge to the s. 11 of the 1885 Act on the basis of vagueness or gender discrimination. However, the court granted leave on three grounds which were interrelated and sequential, as follows: (i) Is the consent of both parties an essential ingredient of the offence of gross indecency under s. 11 of the 1885 Act? (ii) Having regard to the answer to the first question, does the appellant have locus standi to challenge the compatibility of that section with the Constitution? (iii) Having regard to the answer to the foregoing question is s. 11 of the 1885 Act compatible with the Constitution?\n\nHeld by the Court that it would resolve the issues in respect of which leave was granted as follows: (i) no, the consent of both parties is not an essential ingredient of the offence of gross indecency under s. 11 of the 1885 Act; (ii) the appellant, as a person charged under s. 11 of the 1885 Act, has locus standi to challenge the compatibility of the section with the Constitution, but only on grounds related to his personal circumstances; (iii) in the light of the answers to the foregoing questions, s. 11 of the 1885 Act has not been shown to be incompatible with the Constitution on the grounds in respect of which the appellant has locus standi arising from his personal circumstances.\n\nThe Court held that the appeal must be dismissed.\n\nAppeal dismissed."
