The Commission recommended, inter alia, that the General Assembly of the\n\nUnited Nations should authorize the Secretariat to prepare and issue, with as wide a distribution\n\nas possible, a Legislative Series containing the texts of current national legislation\n\non matters of international interest. In this connection, it was recommended that the Secretariat\n\nshould assemble and publish from time to time collections of the texts of national\n\nlegislation on special topics of general interest. The Legislative Series is prepared by the\n\nCodification Division of the Office of Legal Affairs.\n\nThe first 24 volumes in the Legislative Series have addressed a broad range of special\n\ntopics of general interest relating, inter alia, to the law of the sea, the law of treaties, nationality,\n\ndiplomatic and consular law, international organizations, State succession, non-navigational\n\nuses of international watercourses, jurisdictional immunities of States and their\n\nproperty, the multilateral treaty-making process as well as the prevention and suppression\n\nof international terrorism. The legal materials contained in this series have included not\n\nonly national legislation but also treaties, judicial decisions, diplomatic correspondence\n\nand other relevant materials depending on the topic. The present volume of this series is\n\ndevoted to the topic of the responsibility of States for internationally wrongful acts.\n\nIn 2001, at its fifty-third session, the International Law Commission adopted the draft\n\narticles on responsibility of States for internationally wrongful acts. In resolution 56/83 of\n\n12 December 2001, the General Assembly took note of the articles, the text of which was\n\nannexed to that resolution, and commended them to the attention of Governments without\n\nprejudice to the question of their future adoption or other appropriate action. The General\n\nAssembly commended again the articles to the attention of Governments without prejudice\n\nto the question of their future adoption or other appropriate action, in 2004, 2007,\n\n2010, 2013, 2016, 2019 and 2022.1\n\nIn resolution 59/35, the General Assembly also requested the Secretary-General, inter\n\nalia, to prepare an initial compilation of decisions of international courts, tribunals and\n\nother bodies referring to the articles.2 The compilation was subsequently updated on five\n\nfurther occasions,3 on the basis of requests by the General Assembly in each resolution\n\nadopted from 2007 onwards.4\n\n1 See General Assembly resolutions 59/35 of 2 December 2004, 62/61 of 6 December 2007, 65/19\n\nof 6 December 2010, 68/104 of 16 December 2013, 71/133 of 13 December 2016, 74/180 of 18 December\n\n2019 and 77/97 of 7 December 2022.\n\n2 See A/62/62 and Corr.1 and Add.1 (covering the period 1973 until April 2007).\n\n3 See A/65/76 (covering the period from May 2007 until 31 January 2010); A/68/72 (covering the\n\nperiod from February 2010 until 31 January 2013); A/71/80 and Add.1 (covering the period from February\n\n2013 until 31 January 2016); A/74/83 (covering the period from February 2016 until 31 January 2019)\n\nand A/77/74 83 (covering the period from February 2019 until 31 January 2022). In resolution 71/133 of\n\n13 December 2016, the General Assembly also requested the preparation of a technical report listing, in\n\na tabular format, the references to the articles contained in the compilation of decisions of international\n\ncourts, tribunals and other bodies referring to the articles prepared since 2001, as well as references to\n\nthe articles made in submissions presented by Member States before international courts, tribunals and\n\nother bodies since 2001. The request was repeated in resolution 74/180 of 18 December 2019. Two such\n\ntechnical reports were prepared (see: A/71/80/Add.1 and A/77/74, annex).\n\n4 See footnote 1 above.\n\nviii\n\nThis collection of materials, in its second edition,5 reproduces the text of the articles, with commentaries thereto, as presented in the Yearbook of the International Law Commission,6 together with the compilation of decisions in which the articles and commentaries were referred to, by international courts, tribunals and other bodies,7 during the period from 1973 to 1996 when the draft articles were adopted on first reading, from 1996 to their adoption on second reading in 2001,8 and up to 31 January 2022, as contained in the five reports of the Secretary-General. The compilation of decisions recorded a combined total of 453 instances in which international courts, tribunals and other bodies had referred to the articles (both in their form prior to, and following, their adoption in 2001) and corresponding commentaries.\n\nThe collection of materials is organized in accordance with the structure of the articles as adopted in 2001, with each article (or Part or Chapter heading) presented together with its commentary, followed by the respective extract from the compilation of decisions prepared by the Secretary-General. The compilation of decisions reproduced the extracts of decisions in which the articles were referred to by international courts, tribunals or other bodies. Under each article, the extracts of decisions appeared in chronological order to reflect historical developments and to facilitate the understanding of decisions containing references to previous case law. In view of the number and length of those decisions, only the relevant extracts referring to the articles were included. Each extract was accompanied by a brief description of the context in which the statement was made by the international court, tribunal or other body. Only those extracts in which the articles were invoked as the basis for the decision or where the articles were referred to as reflecting the existing law governing the issue at hand were included. Submissions of parties invoking the articles, and opinions of judges appended to a decision were not included.\n\nAnnex I reproduces the articles on the responsibility of States for internationally wrongful acts. Annex II lists the various cases and decisions pertaining to each article, or part of the articles (where applicable), cited in both the commentaries and the extracts from the compilation of decisions. Annex III lists, in alphabetical order, all the cases and decisions cited in the present volume.\n\n5 The first edition, published in 2012, reproduced the original compilation together with the first two subsequent Secretary-General reports (covering the period until 31 January 2010). See United Nations Sales No. E.12.V.12.\n\n6 2001, vol. II (Part Two), para. 77.\n\n7 Following a comprehensive review of the decisions of international, regional and sub-regional courts, tribunals and other bodies, the extracts reproduced in this volume were identified in the decisions of: the International Court of Justice; the International Criminal Court; the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda; the International Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia; the Special Court for Sierra Leone; the Special Tribunal for Lebanon; the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea; the African Court on Human and Peoples’ Rights; the African Commission for Human Rights; the Caribbean Court of Justice; the European Court of Human Rights; the Court of Justice of the European Union; the General Court of the European Union; the European Commission of Human Rights; the Inter-American Court of Human Rights; the Economic Community of West African States Court of Justice; international arbitral tribunals; the Iran-United States Claims Tribunal; the United Nations Compensation Commission; the WTO Appellate Body; panels established under GATT and WTO; the Human Rights Committee; the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights; the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination; and the Committee on the Rights of the Child.\n\n8 References to draft articles adopted prior to the final adoption of the articles in 2001 were included only when the draft article was incorporated in the final articles. In those cases, the text of the draft article was reproduced in a footnote accompanying the extract.\n\nix\n\nExplanatory note\n\nThe respective original documents have been reproduced with minor changes, limited\n\nto editorial modifications introduced to ensure the consistency of presentation within the\n\npresent volume.\n\nIn accordance with its Statute, the International Law Commission adopts “draft”\n\ninstruments, including “draft articles”. In the recent practice of the General Assembly,\n\nwhen draft articles, as presented by the Commission, are taken note of by the Assembly\n\nand annexed to one of its resolutions, the reference to “draft” is excluded. Accordingly, the\n\npractice of the Secretariat has been to use “draft articles” when referring to the text in the\n\nstages of preparation leading up to, and including, their adoption by the Commission. The\n\nword “draft” is not included when making references to the “articles” in their contemporary\n\nform, i.e. as subsequently annexed to a General Assembly resolution. This practice has\n\nnot been uniformly followed by the various courts and instances cited in the compilation\n\nof decisions prepared by the Secretary-General. The respective methods of referring to the\n\narticles, as reflected in the extracts, have been retained for reasons of historical accuracy.\n\nA reference (in square brackets) to the United Nations document symbol (together\n\nwith the relevant paragraph or footnote number therein) has been added after each decision\n\nextracted from the compilation of decisions prepared by the Secretary-General.\n\nThe footnotes in the present volume are numbered consecutively (in square brackets)\n\nfor ease of reference, and are presented together with the corresponding footnote numbers\n\nappearing in the respective original documents.\n\nWith regard to the Annexes, where a title of a decision was presented in English in\n\none of the original documents, that title is retained. Where a title of a decision was not\n\nreflected in English in the original documents, the title is reproduced in the language in\n\nwhich it was presented in the English version of those documents.\n\nxi\n\nAbbreviations\n\nAJIL American Journal of International Law\n\nACHPR African Commission on Human and Peoples’ Rights\n\nACtHPR African Court on Human and Peoples’ Rights\n\nBIT bilateral investment treaty\n\nBYBIL The British Yearbook of International Law\n\nCCJ Caribbean Court of Justice\n\nCERD Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination\n\nCESCR Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights\n\nCJEU Court of Justice of the European Union\n\nCRC Committee on the Rights of the Child\n\nDSU Dispute Settlement Understanding\n\nEC European Community\n\nEur.

The emphasis is on the secondary rules of State responsibility:\n\nthat is to say, the general conditions under international law for the State to be considered\n\nresponsible for wrongful actions or omissions, and the legal consequences which flow\n\ntherefrom. The articles do not attempt to define the content of the international obligations,\n\nthe breach of which gives rise to responsibility. This is the function of the primary\n\nrules, whose codification would involve restating most of substantive customary and conventional\n\ninternational law.\n\n(2) Roberto Ago, who was responsible for establishing the basic structure and orientation\n\nof the project, saw the articles as specifying:\n\nthe principles which govern the responsibility of States for internationally wrongful acts, maintaining\n\na strict distinction between this task and the task of defining the rules that place obligations on\n\nStates, the violation of which may generate responsibility … [I]t is one thing to define a rule and\n\nthe content of the obligation it imposes, and another to determine whether that obligation has been\n\nviolated and what should be the consequences of the violation.[1] 32\n\n(3) Given the existence of a primary rule establishing an obligation under international law\n\nfor a State, and assuming that a question has arisen as to whether that State has complied\n\nwith the obligation, a number of further issues of a general character arise. These include:\n\n(a) The role of international law as distinct from the internal law of the State concerned\n\nin characterizing conduct as unlawful;\n\n(b) Determining in what circumstances conduct is to be attributed to the State as a\n\nsubject of international law;\n\n(c) Specifying when and for what period of time there is or has been a breach of an\n\ninternational obligation by a State;\n\n(d) Determining in what circumstances a State may be responsible for the conduct\n\nof another State which is incompatible with an international obligation of the latter;\n\n(e) Defining the circumstances in which the wrongfulness of conduct under international\n\nlaw may be precluded;\n\n(f) Specifying the content of State responsibility, i.e. the new legal relations that arise\n\nfrom the commission by a State of an internationally wrongful act, in terms of cessation of\n\nthe wrongful act, and reparation for any injury done;\n\n(g) Determining any procedural or substantive preconditions for one State to invoke\n\nthe responsibility of another State, and the circumstances in which the right to invoke\n\nresponsibility may be lost;\n\n[1] 32 Yearbook … 1970, vol. II, p. 306, document A/8010/Rev.1, para. 66 (c).\n\n2 General commentary\n\n(h) Laying down the conditions under which a State may be entitled to respond to a breach of an international obligation by taking countermeasures designed to ensure the fulfilment of the obligations of the responsible State under these articles.\n\nThis is the province of the secondary rules of State responsibility.\n\n(4) A number of matters do not fall within the scope of State responsibility as dealt with in the present articles:\n\n(a) As already noted, it is not the function of the articles to specify the content of the obligations laid down by particular primary rules, or their interpretation. Nor do the articles deal with the question whether and for how long particular primary obligations are in force for a State. It is a matter for the law of treaties to determine whether a State is a party to a valid treaty, whether the treaty is in force for that State and with respect to which provisions, and how the treaty is to be interpreted. The same is true, mutatis mutandis, for other “sources” of international obligations, such as customary international law. The articles take the existence and content of the primary rules of international law as they are at the relevant time; they provide the framework for determining whether the consequent obligations of each State have been breached, and with what legal consequences for other States.\n\n(b) The consequences dealt with in the articles are those which flow from the commission of an internationally wrongful act as such.[2] 33 No attempt is made to deal with the consequences of a breach for the continued validity or binding effect of the primary rule (e.g. the right of an injured State to terminate or suspend a treaty for material breach, as reflected in article 60 of the 1969 Vienna Convention). Nor do the articles cover such indirect or additional consequences as may flow from the responses of international organizations to wrongful conduct. In carrying out their functions it may be necessary for international organizations to take a position on whether a State has breached an international obligation. But even where this is so, the consequences will be those determined by or within the framework of the constituent instrument of the organization, and these fall outside the scope of the articles. This is particularly the case with action of the United Nations under the Charter, which is specifically reserved by article 59.\n\n(c) The articles deal only with the responsibility for conduct which is internationally wrongful. There may be cases where States incur obligations to compensate for the injurious consequences of conduct which is not prohibited, and may even be expressly permitted, by international law (e.g. compensation for property duly taken for a public purpose). There may also be cases where a State is obliged to restore the status quo ante after some lawful activity has been completed. These requirements of compensation or restoration would involve primary obligations; it would be the failure to pay compensation, or to restore the status quo which would engage the international responsibility of the State concerned. Thus for the purposes of these articles, international responsibility results exclusively from a wrongful act contrary to international law. This is reflected in the title of the articles.\n\n[2] 33 For the purposes of the articles, the term “internationally wrongful act” includes an omission and extends to conduct consisting of several actions or omissions which together amount to an internationally wrongful act. See paragraph (1) of the commentary to article 1.\n\nGeneral commentary 3\n\n(d) The articles are concerned only with the responsibility of States for internationally wrongful conduct, leaving to one side issues of the responsibility of international organizations or of other non-State entities (see articles 57 and 58).\n\n(5) On the other hand, the present articles are concerned with the whole field of State responsibility. Thus they are not limited to breaches of obligations of a bilateral character, e.g. under a bilateral treaty with another State. They apply to the whole field of the international obligations of States, whether the obligation is owed to one or several States, to an individual or group, or to the international community as a whole. Being general in character, they are also for the most part residual. In principle, States are free, when establishing or agreeing to be bound by a rule, to specify that its breach shall entail only particular consequences and thereby to exclude the ordinary rules of responsibility. This is made clear by article 55.\n\n(6) The present articles are divided into four parts. Part One is entitled “The internationally wrongful act of a State”. It deals with the requirements for the international responsibility of a State to arise. Part Two, “Content of the international responsibility of a State”, deals with the legal consequences for the responsible State of its internationally wrongful act, in particular as they concern cessation and reparation. Part Three is entitled “The implementation of the international responsibility of a State”. It identifies the State or States which may react to an internationally wrongful act and specifies the modalities by which this may be done, including, in certain circumstances, by the taking of countermeasures as necessary to ensure cessation of the wrongful act and reparation for its consequences. Part Four contains certain general provisions applicable to the articles as a whole.\n\nDECISIONS OF INTERNATIONAL COURTS, TRIBUNALS AND OTHER BODIES\n\nInternational arbitral tribunal (under the ICSID Additional Facility Rules)\n\nArcher Daniels Midland Company and Tate & Lyle Ingredients Americas, Inc. v. the United Mexican States\n\nIn its 2007 award, the tribunal established to hear the case of Archer Daniels Midland Company and Tate & Lyle Ingredients Americas, Inc. v.

The question is not whether intermediate results of one element of the interpretative exercise ‘override’ the results of another. Rules of international law within the meaning of Article 31(3)(c) are one of several means to ascertain the common intention of the parties to a particular agreement reflected in Article 31 of the Vienna Convention [on the Law of Treaties].[13] 11\n\nThe Appellate Body continued by noting that:\n\n[w]e are puzzled by the Panel’s statement that the ILC Articles have been cited by panels and the Appellate Body ‘as conceptual guidance only to supplement or confirm, but not to replace, the analyses based on the ordinary meaning, context and object and purpose of the relevant covered Agreements’.[14] 12\n\nWhile the WTO panel, as noted previously, found that panels and the Appellate Body had not considered the State responsibility articles to constitute rules of international law in the sense of article 31(3)(c) of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, the Appellate Body observed that prior WTO jurisprudence “evinces that these ILC Articles have been ‘taken into account’ in the sense of Article 31(3)(c) by panels and the Appellate Body … ”.[15] 13\n\n[A/68/72, paras. 13–15]\n\nEuropean Court of Human Rights\n\nKotov v.

Islamic Republic of Iran\n\nIn its 1987 award in the Rankin v. Islamic Republic of Iran case, the Tribunal, in determining whether it had jurisdiction over the case, considered that Part One of the articles provisionally adopted by the International Law Commission in 1980 constituted “the most recent and authoritative statement of current international law” on the origin of State responsibility for internationally wrongful acts:[23] 4\n\n… the Tribunal observes that only injuries resulting from popular movements which are not an act of the Government of Iran are excluded from the Tribunal’s jurisdiction by this provision [i.e., paragraph 11 of the Declaration of the Government of Algeria of 19 January 1981[24] 5], which exclusion is no more than a restatement of the customary international law requirement that a State’s responsibility is engaged only by wrongful conduct attributable to the State. Such conduct has in recent years come under the scrutiny of the United Nations International Law Commission, culminating in the development of a set of draft articles on the origins of State responsibility for internationally wrongful acts. The Tribunal has adopted the criteria set down by the International Law Commission as the most recent and authoritative statement of current international law in this area. See draft articles on State responsibility (Part 2 of the draft) as provisionally adopted by the International Law Commission, cited 1980 Yearbook of the International Law Commission, vol. II, Part Two at\n\n[23] 4 Part One of the articles provisionally adopted by the International Law Commission (entitled “Origin of international responsibility”) became, with amendments, Part One of the articles finally adopted in 2001.\n\n[24] 5 Under paragraph 11 of the Declaration of the Government of Algeria of 19 January 1981, the United States of America agreed to “bar and preclude prosecution against Iran of any pending or future claim … arising out of events occurring before the date of this Declaration related to … (d) injury to the United States nationals or their property as a result of popular movements in the course of the Islamic Revolution in Iran which were not an act of the Government of Iran”.\n\n10 Part One\n\npp. 30–34, United Nations doc.

Responsibility of a State for its internationally wrongful acts\n\nEvery internationally wrongful act of a State entails the international responsibility\n\nof that State.\n\nCommentary\n\n(1) Article 1 states the basic principle underlying the articles as a whole, which is that a\n\nbreach of international law by a State entails its international responsibility. An internationally\n\nwrongful act of a State may consist in one or more actions or omissions or a combination\n\nof both. Whether there has been an internationally wrongful act depends, first,\n\non the requirements of the obligation which is said to have been breached and, secondly, on\n\nthe framework conditions for such an act, which are set out in Part One. The term “international\n\nresponsibility” covers the new legal relations which arise under international law\n\nby reason of the internationally wrongful act of a State. The content of these new legal\n\nrelations is specified in Part Two.\n\n(2) PCIJ applied the principle set out in article 1 in a number of cases. For example, in the\n\nPhosphates in Morocco case, PCIJ affirmed that when a State commits an internationally\n\nwrongful act against another State international responsibility is established “immediately as\n\nbetween the two States”.[28] 34 ICJ has applied the principle on several occasions, for example in\n\nthe Corfu Channel case,[29] 35 in the Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua\n\ncase,[30] 36 and in the Gabčíkovo-Nagymaros Project case.[31] 37 The Court also referred to\n\nthe principle in its advisory opinions on Reparation for Injuries,[32] 38 and on the Interpretation\n\nof Peace Treaties (Second Phase),[33] 39 in which it stated that “refusal to fulfil a treaty obligation\n\ninvolves international responsibility”.[34] 40 Arbitral tribunals have repeatedly affirmed\n\nthe principle, for example in the Claims of Italian Nationals Resident in Peru cases,[35] 41 in\n\n[28] 34 Phosphates in Morocco, Judgment, 1938, P.C.I.J., Series A/B, No. 74, p. 10, at p. 28.

It is true that there were\n\nearly differences of opinion over the definition of the legal relationships arising from an\n\ninternationally wrongful act. One approach, associated with Anzilotti, described the legal\n\nconsequences deriving from an internationally wrongful act exclusively in terms of a binding\n\nbilateral relationship thereby established between the wrongdoing State and the injured\n\nState, in which the obligation of the former State to make reparation is set against the\n\n“subjective” right of the latter State to require reparation. Another view, associated with\n\nKelsen, started from the idea that the legal order is a coercive order and saw the authorization\n\naccorded to the injured State to apply a coercive sanction against the responsible State\n\nas the primary legal consequence flowing directly from the wrongful act.[44] 50 According\n\nto this view, general international law empowered the injured State to react to a wrong; the\n\nobligation to make reparation was treated as subsidiary, a way by which the responsible\n\nits agents” (UNRIAA, vol.

A third view, which came to prevail, held that\n\nthe consequences of an internationally wrongful act cannot be limited either to reparation\n\nor to a “sanction”.[45] 51 In international law, as in any system of law, the wrongful act may\n\ngive rise to various types of legal relations, depending on the circumstances.\n\n(4) Opinions have also differed on the question whether the legal relations arising from the\n\noccurrence of an internationally wrongful act were essentially bilateral, i.e. concerned only\n\nthe relations of the responsible State and the injured State inter se. Increasingly it has been\n\nrecognized that some wrongful acts engage the responsibility of the State concerned towards\n\nseveral or many States or even towards the international community as a whole. A significant\n\nstep in this direction was taken by ICJ in the Barcelona Traction case when it noted that:\n\nan essential distinction should be drawn between the obligations of a State towards the international\n\ncommunity as a whole, and those arising vis-à-vis another State in the field of diplomatic protection. By\n\ntheir very nature the former are the concern of all States. In view of the importance of the rights involved,\n\nall States can be held to have a legal interest in their protection; they are obligations erga omnes.[46] 52\n\nEvery State, by virtue of its membership in the international community, has a legal interest\n\nin the protection of certain basic rights and the fulfilment of certain essential obligations.\n\nAmong these the Court instanced “the outlawing of acts of aggression, and of genocide,\n\nas also … the principles and rules concerning the basic rights of the human person,\n\nincluding protection from slavery and racial discrimination”.[47] 53 In later cases the Court\n\nhas reaffirmed this idea.[48] 54 The consequences of a broader conception of international\n\nresponsibility must necessarily be reflected in the articles which, although they include\n\nstandard bilateral situations of responsibility, are not limited to them.\n\n(5) Thus the term “international responsibility” in article 1 covers the relations which\n\narise under international law from the internationally wrongful act of a State, whether\n\nsuch relations are limited to the wrongdoing State and one injured State or whether they\n\nextend also to other States or indeed to other subjects of international law, and whether\n\nthey are centred on obligations of restitution or compensation or also give the injured State\n\nthe possibility of responding by way of countermeasures.\n\n(6) The fact that under article 1 every internationally wrongful act of a State entails the\n\ninternational responsibility of that State does not mean that other States may not also\n\nbe held responsible for the conduct in question, or for injury caused as a result. Under\n\nchapter II the same conduct may be attributable to several States at the same time. Under\n\nchapter IV, one State may be responsible for the internationally wrongful act of another,\n\nfor example if the act was carried out under its direction and control. Nonetheless the basic\n\n[45] 51 See, e.g., R. Ago, “Le délit international”, Recueil des cours … , 1939–II (Paris, Sirey, 1947),\n\nvol. 68, p. 415, at pp. 430–440; and L.

Of course, as ICJ affirmed in\n\nthe Reparation for Injuries case, the United Nations “is a subject of international law and\n\ncapable of possessing international rights and duties … it has capacity to maintain its\n\nrights by bringing international claims”.[49] 55 The Court has also drawn attention to the\n\nresponsibility of the United Nations for the conduct of its organs or agents.[50] 56 It may be\n\nthat the notion of responsibility for wrongful conduct is a basic element in the possession\n\nof international legal personality. Nonetheless, special considerations apply to the responsibility\n\nof other international legal persons, and these are not covered in the articles.[51] 57\n\n(8) As to terminology, the French term fait internationalement illicite is preferable to délit\n\nor other similar expressions which may have a special meaning in internal law. For the\n\nsame reason, it is best to avoid, in English, such terms as “tort”, “delict” or “delinquency”,\n\nor in Spanish the term delito. The French term fait internationalement illicite is better than\n\nacte internationalement illicite, since wrongfulness often results from omissions which\n\nare hardly indicated by the term acte. Moreover, the latter term appears to imply that the\n\nlegal consequences are intended by its author. For the same reasons, the term hecho internacionalmente\n\nilícito is adopted in the Spanish text. In the English text, it is necessary to\n\nmaintain the expression “internationally wrongful act”, since the French fait has no exact\n\nequivalent; nonetheless, the term “act” is intended to encompass omissions, and this is\n\nmade clear in article 2.\n\nDECISIONS OF INTERNATIONAL COURTS, TRIBUNALS AND OTHER BODIES\n\nInternational Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia\n\nProsecutor v. Tihomir Blaškić (“Lasva Valley”)\n\nIn its 1997 decision on the objection of the Republic of Croatia to the issuance of subpoenae\n\nduces tecum in the Blaškić case, which was later submitted to review by the Appeals\n\nChamber,[52] 8 Trial Chamber II of the International Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia,\n\nin considering whether individuals could be subject to orders (more specifically subpoe-\n\n[49] 55 Reparation for Injuries (footnote [32] 38 above), p. 179.\n\n[50] 56 Difference Relating to Immunity from Legal Process of a Special Rapporteur of the Commission\n\non Human Rights, Advisory Opinion, I.C.J.

Tihomir Blaškić (“Lasva Valley”), Decision on\n\nthe Objection of the Republic of Croatia to the Issuance of Subpoenae Duces Tecum, Case No. IT-95–14,\n\n18 July 1997, para. 96) and therefore reinstated the subpoena duces tecum issued on 15 January 1997 by\n\nJudge McDonald to the Republic of Croatia and the Croatian Defence Minister, Mr. Gojko Susak (ibid.,\n\ndisposition). The Appeals Chamber, on the contrary, later found that “the International Tribunal may\n\nnot address binding orders under Article 29 to State officials acting in their official capacity” and thus\n\nquashed the subpoena duces tecum (International Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, Appeals Chamber,\n\nProsecutor v. Tihomir Blaškić (“Lasva Valley”), Judgement on the Request of the Republic of Croatia for\n\nArticle 1 15\n\nnae duces tecum) from the Tribunal, quoted the text of draft article 1 adopted on first reading,[53] 9 which it considered to be an “established rule of international law”:\n\nIf the individual complies with the order in defiance of this government, he may face the loss of his position and possibly far greater sanctions than need be mentioned here. Given the International Tribunal’s lack of police power, it would be very difficult to provide adequate protection for an official who so defied his State. Based on the principle ultra posse nemo tenetur, which states that one should not be compelled to engage in a behaviour that is nearly impossible, it may not be proper to compel an individual to comply with such an order in his official capacity in such circumstances. However, these concerns must be balanced with the need of the International Tribunal to obtain the information necessary for a just and fair adjudication of the criminal charges before it. Due to these concerns and noting the established rule of international law that “[e]very internationally wrong act of a State entails the international responsibility of that State”, the duty to comply in such a scenario must be placed on the State, with appropriate sanctions or penalties for non-compliance … [54] 10\n\n[A/62/62, para. 8]\n\nInternational arbitral tribunal\n\nEureko B.V. v.

Elements of an internationally wrongful act of a State\n\nThere is an internationally wrongful act of a State when conduct consisting of an\n\naction or omission:\n\n(a) is attributable to the State under international law; and\n\n(b) constitutes a breach of an international obligation of the State.\n\nCommentary\n\n(1) Article 1 states the basic principle that every internationally wrongful act of a State\n\nentails its international responsibility. Article 2 specifies the conditions required to establish\n\nthe existence of an internationally wrongful act of the State, i.e. the constituent elements\n\nof such an act. Two elements are identified. First, the conduct in question must be\n\nattributable to the State under international law. Secondly, for responsibility to attach to\n\nthe act of the State, the conduct must constitute a breach of an international legal obligation\n\nin force for that State at that time.\n\n(2) These two elements were specified, for example, by PCIJ in the Phosphates in Morocco\n\ncase. The Court explicitly linked the creation of international responsibility with the\n\nexistence of an “act being attributable to the State and described as contrary to the treaty\n\nright[s] of another State”.[79] 58 ICJ has also referred to the two elements on several occasions.\n\nIn the United States Diplomatic and Consular Staff in Tehran case, it pointed out that,\n\nin order to establish the responsibility of the Islamic Republic of Iran:\n\n[f]irst, it must determine how far, legally, the acts in question may be regarded as imputable to the\n\nIranian State. Secondly, it must consider their compatibility or incompatibility with the obligations of\n\nIran under treaties in force or under any other rules of international law that may be applicable.[80] 59\n\nSimilarly in the Dickson Car Wheel Company case, the Mexico-United States General\n\nClaims Commission noted that the condition required for a State to incur international\n\nresponsibility is “that an unlawful international act be imputed to it, that is, that there exist\n\na violation of a duty imposed by an international juridical standard”.[81] 60\n\n(3) The element of attribution has sometimes been described as “subjective” and the element\n\nof breach as “objective”, but the articles avoid such terminology.[82] 61 Whether there\n\nhas been a breach of a rule may depend on the intention or knowledge of relevant State\n\norgans or agents and in that sense may be “subjective”. For example, article II of the Convention\n\non the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide states that: “In the present\n\nConvention, genocide means any of the following acts committed with intent to destroy, in\n\nwhole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group, as such … ” In other cases,\n\nthe standard for breach of an obligation may be “objective”, in the sense that the advertence\n\n[79] 58 See footnote [28] 34 above.\n\n[80] 59 United States Diplomatic and Consular Staff in Tehran, Judgment, I.C.J.

Whether responsibility is\n\n“objective” or “subjective” in this sense depends on the circumstances, including the content\n\nof the primary obligation in question. The articles lay down no general rule in that regard.\n\nThe same is true of other standards, whether they involve some degree of fault, culpability,\n\nnegligence or want of due diligence. Such standards vary from one context to another for\n\nreasons which essentially relate to the object and purpose of the treaty provision or other\n\nrule giving rise to the primary obligation. Nor do the articles lay down any presumption in\n\nthis regard as between the different possible standards. Establishing these is a matter for the\n\ninterpretation and application of the primary rules engaged in the given case.\n\n(4) Conduct attributable to the State can consist of actions or omissions. Cases in which\n\nthe international responsibility of a State has been invoked on the basis of an omission are\n\nat least as numerous as those based on positive acts, and no difference in principle exists\n\nbetween the two. Moreover, it may be difficult to isolate an “omission” from the surrounding\n\ncircumstances which are relevant to the determination of responsibility. For example, in the\n\nCorfu Channel case, ICJ held that it was a sufficient basis for Albanian responsibility that\n\nit knew, or must have known, of the presence of the mines in its territorial waters and did\n\nnothing to warn third States of their presence.[83] 62 In the United States Diplomatic and Consular\n\nStaff in Tehran case, the Court concluded that the responsibility of the Islamic Republic\n\nof Iran was entailed by the “inaction” of its authorities which “failed to take appropriate\n\nsteps”, in circumstances where such steps were evidently called for.[84] 63 In other cases it may\n\nbe the combination of an action and an omission which is the basis for responsibility.[85] 64\n\n(5) For particular conduct to be characterized as an internationally wrongful act, it must\n\nfirst be attributable to the State. The State is a real organized entity, a legal person with full\n\nauthority to act under international law. But to recognize this is not to deny the elementary\n\nfact that the State cannot act of itself. An “act of the State” must involve some action or\n\nomission by a human being or group: “States can act only by and through their agents and\n\nrepresentatives.”[86] 65 The question is which persons should be considered as acting on behalf\n\nof the State, i.e. what constitutes an “act of the State” for the purposes of State responsibility.\n\n(6) In speaking of attribution to the State what is meant is the State as a subject of international\n\nlaw. Under many legal systems, the State organs consist of different legal persons\n\n(ministries or other legal entities), which are regarded as having distinct rights and obligations\n\nfor which they alone can be sued and are responsible. For the purposes of the international\n\nlaw of State responsibility the position is different. The State is treated as a unity,\n\nconsistent with its recognition as a single legal person in international law. In this as in other\n\nrespects the attribution of conduct to the State is necessarily a normative operation.

Honduras case, Inter-American Court of Human\n\nRights, Series C, No. 4, para. 170 (1988): “under international law a State is responsible for the acts of its\n\nagents undertaken in their official capacity and for their omissions”; and Affaire relative à l’acquisition\n\nde la nationalité polonaise, UNRIAA, vol. I (Sales No. 1948.V.2), p. 401, at p. 425 (1924).\n\n[85] 64 For example, under article 4 of the Convention relative to the Laying of Automatic Submarine\n\nContact Mines (Hague Convention VIII of 18 October 1907), a neutral Power which lays mines off its\n\ncoasts but omits to give the required notice to other States parties would be responsible accordingly.\n\n[86] 65 German Settlers in Poland, Advisory Opinion, 1923, P.C.I.J., Series B, No. 6, p. 22.\n\nArticle 2 23\n\ncrucial is that a given event is sufficiently connected to conduct (whether an act or omission)\n\nwhich is attributable to the State under one or other of the rules set out in chapter II.\n\n(7) The second condition for the existence of an internationally wrongful act of the State\n\nis that the conduct attributable to the State should constitute a breach of an international\n\nobligation of that State. The terminology of breach of an international obligation of the\n\nState is long established and is used to cover both treaty and non-treaty obligations. In its\n\njudgment on jurisdiction in the Factory at Chorzów case, PCIJ used the words “breach of\n\nan engagement”.[87] 66 It employed the same expression in its subsequent judgment on the\n\nmerits.[88] 67 ICJ referred explicitly to these words in the Reparation for Injuries case.[89] 68\n\nThe arbitral tribunal in the “Rainbow Warrior” affair referred to “any violation by a State of\n\nany obligation”.[90] 69 In practice, terms such as “non-execution of international obligations”,\n\n“acts incompatible with international obligations”, “violation of an international obligation”\n\nor “breach of an engagement” are also used.[91] 70 All these formulations have essentially the\n\nsame meaning. The phrase preferred in the articles is “breach of an international obligation”\n\ncorresponding as it does to the language of Article 36, paragraph 2 (c), of the ICJ Statute.\n\n(8) In international law the idea of breach of an obligation has often been equated with\n\nconduct contrary to the rights of others. PCIJ spoke of an act “contrary to the treaty right[s]\n\nof another State” in its judgment in the Phosphates in Morocco case.[92] 71 That case concerned\n\na limited multilateral treaty which dealt with the mutual rights and duties of the\n\nparties, but some have considered the correlation of obligations and rights as a general feature\n\nof international law: there are no international obligations of a subject of international\n\nlaw which are not matched by an international right of another subject or subjects, or even\n\nof the totality of the other subjects (the international community as a whole). But different\n\nincidents may attach to a right which is held in common by all other subjects of international\n\nlaw, as compared with a specific right of a given State or States. Different States may\n\nbe beneficiaries of an obligation in different ways, or may have different interests in respect\n\nof its performance. Multilateral obligations may thus differ from bilateral ones, in view of\n\nthe diversity of legal rules and institutions and the wide variety of interests sought to be\n\nprotected by them. But whether any obligation has been breached still raises the two basic\n\nquestions identified in article 2, and this is so whatever the character or provenance of the\n\nobligation breached. It is a separate question who may invoke the responsibility arising\n\nfrom the breach of an obligation: this question is dealt with in Part Three.[93] 72\n\n(9) Thus there is no exception to the principle stated in article 2 that there are two necessary\n\nconditions for an internationally wrongful act—conduct attributable to the State under\n\ninternational law and the breach by that conduct of an international obligation of the State.\n\nThe question is whether those two necessary conditions are also sufficient. It is sometimes\n\n[87] 66 Case concerning the Factory at Chorzów, Jurisdiction (footnote [28] 34 above).\n\n[88] 67 Factory at Chorzów, Merits (ibid.).\n\n[89] 68 Reparation for Injuries (footnote [32] 38 above), p. 184.\n\n[90] 69 “Rainbow Warrior” (footnote [40] 46 above), p. 251, para. 75.\n\n[91] 70 At the Conference for the Codification of International Law, held at The Hague in 1930, the\n\nterm “any failure … to carry out the international obligations of the State” was adopted (see Yearbook\n\n… 1956, vol. II, p. 225, document A/CN.4/96, annex 3, article 1).\n\n[92] 71 See footnote [28] 34 above.\n\n[93] 72 See also article 33, paragraph 2, and commentary.\n\n24 Article 2\n\nsaid that international responsibility is not engaged by conduct of a State in disregard of its obligations unless some further element exists, in particular, “damage” to another State. But whether such elements are required depends on the content of the primary obligation, and there is no general rule in this respect. For example, the obligation under a treaty to enact a uniform law is breached by the failure to enact the law, and it is not necessary for another State party to point to any specific damage it has suffered by reason of that failure. Whether a particular obligation is breached forthwith upon a failure to act on the part of the responsible State, or whether some further event must occur, depends on the content and interpretation of the primary obligation and cannot be determined in the abstract.[94] 73\n\n(10) A related question is whether fault constitutes a necessary element of the internationally wrongful act of a State. This is certainly not the case if by “fault” one understands the existence, for example, of an intention to harm. In the absence of any specific requirement of a mental element in terms of the primary obligation, it is only the act of a State that matters, independently of any intention.\n\n(11) Article 2 introduces and places in the necessary legal context the questions dealt with in subsequent chapters of Part One. Subparagraph (a)—which states that conduct attributable to the State under international law is necessary for there to be an internationally wrongful act—corresponds to chapter II, while chapter IV deals with the specific cases where one State is responsible for the internationally wrongful act of another State. Subparagraph (b)—which states that such conduct must constitute a breach of an international obligation—corresponds to the general principles stated in chapter III, while chapter V deals with cases where the wrongfulness of conduct, which would otherwise be a breach of an obligation, is precluded.\n\n(12) In subparagraph (a), the term “attribution” is used to denote the operation of attaching a given action or omission to a State. In international practice and judicial decisions, the term “imputation” is also used.[95] 74 But the term “attribution” avoids any suggestion that the legal process of connecting conduct to the State is a fiction, or that the conduct in question is “really” that of someone else.\n\n(13) In subparagraph (b), reference is made to the breach of an international obligation rather than a rule or a norm of international law. What matters for these purposes is not simply the existence of a rule but its application in the specific case to the responsible State. The term “obligation” is commonly used in international judicial decisions and practice and in the literature to cover all the possibilities. The reference to an “obligation” is limited to an obligation under international law, a matter further clarified in article 3.\n\n[94] 73 For examples of analysis of different obligations, see United States Diplomatic and Consular Staff in Tehran (footnote [80] 59 above), pp. 30–33, paras. 62–68; “Rainbow Warrior” (footnote [40] 46 above), pp. 266–267, paras. 107–110; and WTO, Report of the Panel, United States–Sections 301–310 of the Trade Act of 1974 (WT/DS152/R), 22 December 1999, paras. 7.41 et seq.\n\n[95] 74 See, e.g., United States Diplomatic and Consular Staff in Tehran (footnote [80] 59 above), p. 29, paras. 56 and 58; and Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (footnote [30] 36 above), p. 51, para. 86.\n\nArticle 2 25\n\nDECISIONS OF INTERNATIONAL COURTS, TRIBUNALS AND OTHER BODIES\n\nInternational arbitral tribunal (under the ICSID Convention)\n\nAmco Asia Corporation and Others v. Republic of Indonesia\n\nIn its 1984 award on the merits, the arbitral tribunal constituted to hear the Amco\n\nIndonesia Corporation and Others v. Indonesia case considered that draft article 3 provisionally\n\nadopted by the International Law Commission[96] 12 (as well as articles 5 and 10\n\nprovisionally adopted), which it quoted in extenso, constituted “an expression of accepted\n\nprinciples of international law”:\n\nIt is a generally accepted rule of international law, clearly stated in international awards and judgements\n\nand generally accepted in the literature, that a State has a duty to protect aliens and their\n\ninvestments against unlawful acts committed by some of its citizens … If such acts are committed\n\nwith the active assistance of state-organs a breach of international law occurs. In this respect, the\n\nTribunal wants to draw attention to the draft articles on State responsibility formulated in 1979 by\n\nthe International Law Commission and presented to the General Assembly of the United Nations\n\nas an expression of accepted principles of international law.[97] 13\n\n[A/62/62, para. 10]\n\nAd hoc committee (under the ICSID Convention)\n\nCompañia de Aguas del Aconquija SA and Vivendi Universal (formerly Compagnie générale\n\ndes eaux) v.

Argentina case,\n\nthe ad hoc committee noted that,\n\n[i]n considering the [arbitral] Tribunal’s findings on the merits [in the award involved in the annulment\n\nproceedings], it is necessary to distinguish between what the Tribunal referred to as, on the\n\none hand, claims ‘based directly on alleged actions or failures to act of the Argentine Republic’ and,\n\non the other hand, claims relating to conduct of the [Argentine province of] Tucumán authorities\n\nwhich are nonetheless brought against Argentina and ‘rely … upon the principle of attribution’.[98] 14\n\n[96] 12 This provision was amended and incorporated in article 2 adopted by the International Law\n\nCommission in 2001. The text of draft article 3 provisionally adopted read as follows:\n\nArticle 3\n\nElements of an internationally wrongful act of a State\n\nThere is an internationally wrongful act of a State when:\n\n(a) Conduct consisting of an action or omission is attributable to the State under international\n\nlaw; and\n\n(b) That conduct constitutes a breach of an international obligation of the State.

All international\n\nclaims against a state are based on attribution, whether the conduct in question is that of a central or\n\nprovincial government or other subdivision. See International Law Commission articles on responsibility\n\nof States for internationally wrongful acts, annexed to General Assembly resolution 54/83,\n\n12 December 2001 … , articles 2(a), 4 and the Commission’s commentary to article 4, paras. (8)-\n\n(10). A similar remark may be made concerning the Tribunal’s later reference to “a strict liability\n\nof attribution” … Attribution has nothing to do with the standard of liability or responsibility. The\n\nquestion whether a State’s responsibility is “strict” or is based on due diligence or on some other\n\nstandard is a separate issue from the question of attribution (cf. International Law Commission\n\narticles, arts. 2, 12). It does not, however, appear that either of these terminological issues affected\n\nthe reasoning of the Tribunal, and no more need be said of them.[99] 15\n\n[A/62/62, para. 11]\n\nInternational arbitral tribunal\n\nEureko B.V. v.

Upon a review of\n\nprior decisions and “customary international law in general”, the tribunal identified a number\n\nof elements, including that expropriation requires a taking (which may include destruction)\n\nby a government-type authority of an investment by an investor covered by NAFTA. In\n\na footnote citing article 2 of the State responsibility articles, the tribunal added that:\n\n[a] failure to act (an ‘omission’) by a host State may also constitute a State measure tantamount to\n\nexpropriation under particular circumstances, although those cases will be rare and seldom concern\n\nthe omission alone.[101] 17\n\n[A/65/76, para. 12]\n\n[99] 15 Ibid., p. 100, para. 16, footnote 17.\n\n[100] 16 See footnote [55] 11 above, para. 188.

In coming to that conclusion, the\n\ntribunal referred to the commentary to article 2 of the State responsibility articles, where\n\nthe Commission stated:\n\nIt is sometimes said that international responsibility is not engaged by conduct of a State in disregard\n\nof its obligations unless some further element exists, in particular, ‘damage’ to another State.
