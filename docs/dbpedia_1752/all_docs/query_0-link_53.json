No other book has undertaken such a broad comparative study of exclusionary rules, which have now become a world-wide phenomenon. The topic is one of the most controversial in criminal procedure law, because it reveals a constant tension between the criminal court’s duty to ascertain the truth, on the one hand, and its duty to uphold important constitutional rights on the other, most importantly, the privilege against self-incrimination and the right to privacy in one's home and one's private communications.\n\nThe chapters were contributed by noted world experts on the subject for the XVIII Congress of the International Academy of Comparative Law in Washington in July 2010.\n\nE-Book Content\n\nExclusionary Rules in Comparative Law\n\nIUS GENTIUM COMPARATIVE PERSPECTIVES ON LAW AND JUSTICE\n\nVOLUME 20\n\nSeries Editors Mortimer N.S.

Thaman\n\nThis book, Exclusionary Rules in Comparative Law, grew out of excellent country studies on the criminal exclusionary rule prepared for the XVIII Congress of the International Academy of Comparative Law (IACL), which was held in Washington, D.C., from July 25 through August 1, 2010. I had the honor of being the general rapporteur for criminal procedure for the congress and also chose the topic for the congress. What is controversial about what are called “exclusionary rules” in American law, prohibitions on the use of evidence (Beweisverwertungsverbote) in German, or simply “non-usability” (inutilizzabilità) in Italy, is that they end up depriving the factfinders in criminal trials, whether professional judges, jurors, or lay judges sitting with professional judges in mixed courts, of relevant, material evidence of guilt, because of errors committed by law enforcement personnel in the collection of this evidence. We thus have a real confrontation of two principles of criminal procedure, that of truth-finding, often called the principle of material truth in civil law countries, and that of “due process” to use the Anglo-American term, or the principle of a state under the rule of law or Rechtsstaatlichkeit, to use the German term. The sacrifice of truth in favor of other important values not only occurs through the use of exclusionary rules. In the area of plea bargaining and other abbreviated and consensual methods of avoiding a full trial on the truth of the charges, truth is sacrificed at the altar of efficiency and procedural economy, that is, in order to save time and money.1 Many criticize the common law jury system with its non-reasoned\n\n1 I chose this topic when I was general rapporteur for criminal procedure at the XVII Congress of the International Academy of Comparative Law which was held in Utrecht, The Netherlands. See Thaman, S.C. (ed.)(2010), World Plea Bargaining, Durham, North Carolina: Carolina Academic Press.\n\nS.C.

Today, especially in the area of plea bargaining and exclusionary rules, this is no longer the case. As this book shows, exclusionary rules are part and parcel of nearly all criminal procedure systems in Europe and are also becoming more prevalent in other parts of the world. After I was chosen as general rapporteur on the subject of exclusionary rules, I prepared a questionnaire and sent it to the various country reporters who were either nominated by their country’s section of the IACL, or were recruited by me from friends and colleagues. Although I asked the country reporters to address the issues in the questionnaire, I gave them freedom to arrange their reports as they wished so as to make them more readable when published in book form. In the questionnaire I wanted to know, in general, whether the principle of material truth had a constitutional foundation in their countries, whether it was explicitly spelled out in the Code of Criminal Procedure (CCP), or whether if had been developed from the academic literature or in the case law of the high courts. I also wanted to know whether the exclusion of illegally gathered evidence was included as a constitutional mandate, or was introduced by high court jurisprudence, or by legislative enactment. I was interested, as well, in whether the country had a generally worded rule excluding evidence gathered in violation of the law, and whether such exclusionary rule was limited to fundamental or constitutional violations, or was applicable, in addition, to violations of statutory rules. With respect to more particular exclusionary rules applying to specific violations of laws relating to the gathering or admissibility of evidence, I decided to narrow the scope of the country reports to what I thought were the two most critical areas in which exclusionary rules are used to enforce important human rights protected by both national constitutions and international human rights conventions, that is: (1) where police acquire evidence by violating the universally protected right to privacy in one’s home or in one’s private conversations and (2) where police violate human dignity, the privilege against self-incrimination and/or the right to silence in obtaining confessions. This book will not touch on another important exclusionary rule, despite its grounding in constitutional and international human rights law: the exclusion of inculpatory hearsay evidence in the form of witness statements, where the defendant was deprived of the opportunity to confront or examine the witness. Although there is substantial statutory and case law dealing with this exclusionary rule, rooted, inter alia, in the Sixth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, Art. 14(3)(e) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and Art. 6 (3)(d) of the 2\n\nSee, for instance, Thaman, S.C. (2011), “Should Criminal Juries Give Reasons for their Verdicts”: The Spanish Experience and the Implications of the European Court of Human Rights Decision in Taxquet v. Belgium, Chicago-Kent Law Review, Vol. 86, 613–668.\n\nIntroduction\n\nxiii\n\nEuropean Convention of Human Rights I felt that this important material does not as glaringly pose the question of truth against due process. This is because the right to confrontation is a purely procedural right that has no impact beyond criminal procedure, unlike the right to human dignity or the right to privacy, and also because the violation of the right to confrontation can never lead to the exclusion of physical evidence of guilt, but only to words, which, whether in the form of prior witness testimony, confessions, or intercepted telephone conversations, are not always reliable and credible indicia of guilt. In the end, 24 country reports and a report on the jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights (hereafter ECtHR) were submitted and temporarily published on the website of the XVIII Congress of the IACL. I wrote the general report for the Washington congress and referred to the wealth of information that I learned in these reports.3 Although much of the groundwork for Chap. 17 of this book, my general theoretical treatment of the exclusionary rule, is based on my general report for the conference, they are in no way identical. I have expanded and re-organized the material in the general report in a more concise and theoretically consistent manner, giving Chap. 17 a closer likeness to an article I later wrote, which was published in the University of Toronto Law Journal.4 I received the following reports as general rapporteur for the Washington conference: Belgium, written by Marie-Aude Beernaert, of the Catholic University of Louvain and Philip Traest, of the University of Ghent; Brazil, written by Ana Paula Zomer Sica, State Procurator in São Paulo and Leonardo Sica, a lawyer in São Paulo; the Czech Republic, written by Jaroslav Fenyk of Masaryk University in Brno; England and Wales, written by Andrew Choo, University of Warwick; Finland, written by Hannu Kiuru, Helsinki, Vice-President of the Finnish Section of the Comparative Law Association; France, written by Jean Pradel, Professor Emeritus of the University of Poitiers; Germany, written by Sabine Gless, University of Basel, Switzerland; Greece, written by George Triantafyllou, University of Athens; Ireland, written by Yvonne Daly, Dublin City University and Arnaud Cras, University College Dublin; Israel, written by Rinat Kitai Sangero, Academic Center of Law and Business, Jerusalem and Yuval Merin, College of Management School of Law, Rishon LeZion; Italy, written by Giulio Illuminati, University of Bologna; Macao, written by Paulo Martins Chan, Public Prosecutor, University of Macao; the Netherlands, written by Lonneke Stevens and Matthias J.

I would also like to acknowledge, that the country reporter for Croatia, Prof. Ivo Josipović, University of Zagreb, graciously excused himself for being unable to submit his report. His excuse was rather compelling: he was elected President of Croatia in the meantime! We wish him the best of luck! Due to space constraints, I could not publish all of the reports in this book, so my choice was based on two factors: (1) what I thought was the importance of the country’s approach to the issue of exclusionary rules, and (2) the quality of the report both in the sense of its coverage of the material and its stylistic merits. I regret that we had to leave out many countries, but what I learned from the reports that have not entered this volume will appear in my synthetic, theoretical chapter, which concludes it. For the 16 reports that make up the other chapters of this book, I will cite directly to these chapters when I refer to the law reflected therein. If I cite to the work of the writers who are not published herein, I will cite to the legal sources they cited, or to my general report for the IACL Congress. Part I of the book will deal with court-made exclusionary rules, and begins with Chap. 1 on the United States, whose famous court-crafted exclusionary rules have had considerable influence in other common law countries, as well as in the civil law world. I will then deal with other common law countries which also have judicially created exclusionary rules: Chap. 2 deals with Ireland, Chap. 3 with Scotland and Chap. 4 with Israel (which has been greatly influenced by common law procedural models). Part I concludes with Chap. 5 on Germany, where the courts have developed a sophisticated balancing test which determines which evidence will be excluded and which will not. Part II of the book, the longest part, deals with the development in the civil law world which took place from the traditional theory of “nullities” to modern exclusionary rules. It begins, as it should, with Chap. 6 on France, where the concept of “nullities” originated, and where they remain the only vehicles to exclude evidence. It continues with Chap. 7 on Belgium, which inherited the concept of “nullities” from France, but whose courts have gradually developed a balancing test when deciding on the admissibility of illegally gathered evidence. Chapter 8 on the Netherlands, deals with a country coming from a similar tradition, but which has introduced a statutory exclusionary rule which gives judges wide discretion in balancing various factors. Chapter 9 on Spain, Chap. 10 on Italy, and Chap. 11 on Greece present countries coming from the “nullity” tradition, which have enacted modern statutory exclusionary rules which have been the subject of some fascinating judicial interpretations by the high courts of those countries. Finally, Chap. 12 on\n\nIntroduction\n\nxv\n\nTurkey and Chap. 13 on Serbia depict countries emerging from military or authoritarian political systems, which have codified categorical exclusionary rules and whose courts are wrestling with these new developments. Part III deals with tests for exclusion which, by and large, look at the larger picture in order to determine whether a failure to exclude illegally gathered evidence would violate the defendant’s right to a fair trial. Chapter 14 deals with the application of this test in England and Wales, where it was introduced in the Police and Criminal Evidence Act of 1984. The new general exclusionary rule adopted by Taiwan’s legislature, described in Chap. 15, can also be seen as a balancing test where the ultimate fairness of the proceedings is the crucial factor. Finally, Chap. 16 deals with the fair trial test applied by the European Court of Human Rights, which was perhaps influenced by the approach in England and Wales. The book then concludes with my synthetic, theoretical approach to exclusionary rules, where I treat all exclusionary rules as results of balancing carried out at the different levels of international and national institutions, whether we are dealing with exclusion of the fruits of torture, or those of mere statutory violations which do not rise to constitutional stature. And, as we shall see, the most difficult step for any state or even international court to take is to exclude physical evidence—contraband, instruments of crime, or fruits of crime—which is gathered in violation of the law, even of constitutional and human rights guarantees. For physical evidence—if not tampered with—does not lie, it speaks for itself (res ipsa loquitur): the murder weapon, the body of a murder victim, the fingerprints, DNA residue, the stolen loot, the illegal stash of drugs. Thus, the treatment of especially these “fruits of the poisonous tree” is the most controversial aspect in most countries, and is the area where truth most clearly begs to be heard, and is reluctant to cede to respect for human rights. It may surprise readers, that exclusionary rules were traditionally more common in inquisitorial non-jury systems in civil law jurisdictions, in the form of what are called “nullities”. If a procedural actor, such as a police officer, investigating magistrate or prosecutor violated a rule of criminal procedure, this could lead to the nullity of the procedural act, and, in some cases, the inadmissibility of evidence related to this violation. Some of these “nullities” are specifically related to certain violations, and others are expressed in general form.\n\nPart I\n\nThe Vicissitudes of Court-Made Exclusionary Tests\n\nChapter 1\n\nThe United States: The Rise and Fall of the Constitutional Exclusionary Rule Mark E. Cammack\n\n1.1 The General Theory of Admissibility of Illegally Gathered Evidence In 1961 the US Supreme Court (USSC) held in Mapp v. Ohio1 that the exclusion of evidence obtained as a result of an unconstitutional search or seizure is required in state criminal trials as a matter of federal constitutional law. The Mapp holding applied only to evidence acquired in violation of the search and seizure protections of the Fourth Amendment. Before the decade was over, however, the Court decided cases creating constitutional exclusionary rules for evidence obtained as a result of violations of two other rights. The 1964 case of Massiah v. United States2 interpreted the right to counsel guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment to require exclusion of statements elicited from the accused in the absence of an attorney after the filing of formal criminal charges. Two years later in Miranda v. Arizona3 the Court relied on the Fifth Amendment right against compelled self-incrimination to mandate exclusion of statements made in response to custodial interrogation unless the suspect had been advised of her rights and voluntarily waived them. The constitutional exclusionary rules created in Mapp, Massiah, and Miranda were not the first to require exclusion of illegally obtained evidence in the United States (US). Confessions obtained by means that operated to “deprive [the accused] of that freedom of will or self-control essential to make his confession voluntary”\n\n1\n\n367 U.S. 643 (1961). 377 U.S. 201 (1964). 3 348 U.S. 436 (1966). 2\n\nM.E.

Cammack\n\nwere inadmissible under the common law of evidence.4 At the end of the nineteenth century the USSC held that the Fifth Amendment self-incrimination right required the exclusion of involuntary confessions from federal prosecutions as a matter of constitutional law,5 and in the 1930s the Court established a constitutional exclusionary rule for involuntary confessions in state courts based on the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.6 Exclusion of evidence obtained as a result of an unlawful search or seizure was required in federal court for nearly 50 years before Mapp extended the rule to the states,7 and a minority of states had required the exclusion of such evidence as a matter of state law prior to the establishment of the Fourth Amendment exclusionary rule in Mapp.8 The imposition of the constitutional mandates stated in Mapp, Massiah, and Miranda does not foreclose the existence of additional exclusionary rules for illegally obtained evidence based on state law. Because the federal constitution is superior to both constitutional and non-constitutional state laws, the rights protections contained in the US constitution establish a minimum standard that the states must honor. States are free, however, to provide greater protection than federal law requires. But while some states require exclusion of illegally seized evidence beyond what is mandated by the US constitution, in the years since the Supreme Court decided Mapp, Massiah, and Miranda, the federal constitution has served as the primary standard for admissibility of illegally obtained evidence. The requirement that the evidentiary fruits of official illegality be excluded from trial has functioned as the principal mechanism for enforcing limitations on the actions of police for nearly 50 years. However, the exclusion of illegally obtained evidence has always been controversial in US law, and while the exclusionary remedy retains its central importance in regulating the conduct of the police, the USSC’s approach toward the exclusion of illegally obtained evidence has undergone a major transformation in recent decades. The decisions in Mapp, Massiah, and Miranda generally reflect the view that the exclusion from trial of evidence derived through illegal means is required as a constitutional mandate. In the years since those cases were decided a different interpretation has emerged as a result of a shift in the ideological balance on the USSC beginning in the 1970s. The approach of the current USSC majority to the exclusion of illegally obtained evidence is characterized by a parsimonious conception of the rights guaranteed by the constitution based on (or justified by) a textualist theory of constitutional interpretation. The upshot of this approach has been to demote the exclusionary rule from the status of a right to that of a remedy. In evaluating whether to apply the exclusionary\n\n4\n\nSee, e.g., Hopt v. Utah, 110 U.S. 574, 585 (1884). Bram v. United States, 168 U.S. 532 (1897). 6 Brown v. Mississippi, 297 U.S. 278 (1936). 7 Weeks v. United States, 232 U.S. 383 (1914). 8 See, e.g., Tucker v. State, 128 Miss. 211 (1922). 5\n\n1 The United States: The Rise and Fall of the Constitutional Exclusionary Rule\n\n5\n\nrule the Court has applied a balancing test that weighs the deterrent benefits of exclusion against its costs measured in terms of lost evidence. The practical consequence has been to significantly restrict the use of exclusion of illegally obtained evidence as a response to violations of the constitution.\n\n1.2\n\n1.2.1\n\nRules of Exclusion/Admissibility in Relation to Violations of the Right to Privacy General Provisions Protecting the Right to Privacy\n\nBecause of its federal structure, the US has 51 separate legal systems: the federal system and the 50 state legal systems. Each of the 51 jurisdictions has its own constitution, many of which include protections against governmental intrusions on privacy and personal security. There are also a variety of statutes that protect privacy. While some state laws have significance within the particular state, by far the most important source of legal protection for privacy as it relates to the prosecution of crime is the Fourth Amendment to the federal Constitution. The text of the Fourth Amendment is brief, speaks in broad generalities, and is notoriously ambiguous. The full Fourth Amendment states: “The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and persons or things to be seized.” There is, however, a vast body of USSC jurisprudence applying the commands of the Amendment in particular cases, and it is these decisions that contain the positive doctrine relating to search and seizure. The ambiguity of the Fourth Amendment arises from the fact that it includes two seemingly distinct rights or commands. The first part of the Amendment—the “unreasonableness” clause—guarantees the right of the people to be secure against searches and seizures that are “unreasonable”; the second part of the Amendment— the warrant clause—specifies requirements for a valid warrant. The most important requirement is that the warrant be supported by probable cause. The language of the Fourth Amendment does not, on its face, clarify the relationship between the prohibition against unreasonable searches and seizures and the requirement of probable cause for warrants. While the correct interpretation of the Fourth Amendment continues to be debated, the USSC’s application of the Amendment has generally assumed that the two clauses should be construed together as expressing a unified rule for the legality of government searches and seizures. Although the syntax of the Fourth Amendment would seem to indicate two separate norms, the second, warrant clause, has generally been taken as establishing the standard for when a search or a seizure is reasonable under the first clause. The assumption underlying much of the Court’s Fourth Amendment jurisprudence is that in order to be constitutionally reasonable, a search or seizure must be carried out pursuant to a warrant that is supported by probable cause.\n\n6\n\nM.E. Cammack\n\nThe first ten amendments to the constitution known collectively as the Bill of Rights were added in 1791, 2 years after the constitution itself was ratified. At the time of their enactment the Bill of Rights were clearly intended as limitations on the powers of the federal government, and for the better part of a century had no relevance to the states. The relationship between the states and the federal government changed dramatically in the latter part of the nineteenth century as a result of amendments to the US constitution following the civil war. The most important change as it relates to criminal procedure is language in the Fourteenth Amendment that guarantees a right against state deprivations of life, liberty or property without “due process of law”. The full implications of this provision were not realized for many decades, but it eventually resulted in the extension of most of the criminal procedure protections in the Bill of Rights to the states. Today the terms of the Fourth Amendment limit the actions of state officials in precisely the same way they limit the federal government. The substantive protections of the Fourth Amendment apply to “searches and seizures” of “persons, houses, papers, and effects” (emphasis added). This language encompasses several distinct interests; a search entails interference with privacy, while a seizure relates to possessory interests or the interest in personal liberty. Fourth Amendment doctrine has developed to reflect the different interests involved in a search and a seizure as well as the different interests implicated by particular types of searches and seizures. Although the Fourth Amendment has been in existence for more than two centuries, most of the contemporary law of search and seizure is contained in USSC decisions rendered in the past 50 years. Much of the current Fourth Amendment doctrine relating to searches traces its source to the USSC’s 1967 decision in Katz v. United States.9 Under the framework established in Katz, the threshold question is whether the means by which the challenged evidence was acquired infringed the defendant’s reasonable expectation of privacy. If the evidence was obtained as a result of a search subject to Fourth Amendment regulation, and if the search was not conducted pursuant to a valid warrant, then the discovery of the evidence is unlawful unless the facts satisfy an exception to the general requirement of a warrant and probable cause. The reasonable expectation of privacy test announced in Katz represents an advance over the Court’s earlier approach, but it has nevertheless been justly criticized as both circular and difficult to apply. The crux of the inquiry requires a determination whether an individual’s expectation that certain facts shall remain private is one that society is prepared to recognize as reasonable or legitimate. The Court has devised a number of ostensibly objective criteria for answering that question, but the application of those criteria has been inconsistent and based on dubious assumptions, and the nearly inescapable impression is that the stated grounds for the decisions conceal an implicit balancing of the burden of a particular investigative technique on privacy against its utility in obtaining evidence of crime.\n\n9\n\n389 U.S. 347 (1967).\n\n1 The United States: The Rise and Fall of the Constitutional Exclusionary Rule\n\n7\n\nAs one leading commentator has written, the determination whether particular police conduct constitutes a search inevitably involves a “value judgment” as to “whether, if the particular form of surveillance practiced by the police is permitted to go unregulated by constitutional constraints, the amount of privacy and freedom remaining to citizens would be diminished to a compass inconsistent with the aims of a free and open society”.10 In the 40-odd years since the Katz test was first announced the USSC has applied it to a variety of forms of police investigation. The Court has found, for example, that the Fourth Amendment is not implicated in the gathering of evidence through the use of informers or undercover police posing as partners in crime.11 The reason given for this rule is that the defendant assumes the risk that his misplaced confidences will be communicated to the police and used as evidence. The Court relied on the same assumption of the risk rationale to find that it is not a search for police surreptitiously to record the numbers dialed from the defendant’s home telephone through the use of a pen register.12 The Court has held that the use of an airplane13 or a helicopter14 to view the defendant’s yard is not a search on the grounds that one could not reasonably expect privacy from such observations since the facts seen by the police could have been observed by any member of the public who happened to fly over the defendant’s yard. By the same logic, the use of an electronic tracking device to track the progress of a car on public streets is not a search since the car’s movements are plainly visible.15 The Court reached a different conclusion in a case in which a tracking device placed inside a container revealed that the container was moved inside a home.16 The fact that the investigation focused on the home was also apparently the critical factor in a decision that the use of a thermal imaging device to measure relative amounts of heat emanating from various parts of the defendant’s house was a Fourth Amendment search.17 Although the USSC continues to reiterate that a search is considered unreasonable unless it is carried out pursuant to a warrant based on a judicial finding of probable cause the requirement of a search warrant is subject to significant exceptions.18 The USSC has long recognized that it is constitutionally reasonable for police to search without a warrant based on their own evaluation of probable cause when an immediate search is necessary because of exigent circumstances.19 10\n\nAmsterdam (1974, 403).

Cammack\n\nThe Court has also created an exception to the requirement of a warrant (though not the requirement of probable cause) for searches of automobiles.20 Searches based on consent21 and inventory searches undertaken for reasons unrelated to the search for evidence22 are reasonable in the absence of both probable cause and a warrant.\n\n1.2.2 Admissibility of Illegally Seized Evidence The Fourth Amendment prohibits unreasonable searches and seizures and establishes requirements for the validity of judicial warrants, but the text is silent with respect to the consequences of a violation of these commands. It was only in the twentieth century that exclusion of unlawfully obtained evidence from use at trial came to be accepted as a means of enforcing the Fourth Amendment. The nearly universal rule prior to that time was that “[t]he law deliberates not on the mode, by which [evidence] has come to the possession of the party, but on its value in establishing itself as satisfactory proof”.23 The only remedy for violation of constitutional or other rules regarding search and seizure was a civil suit for trespass against the offending party. As was stated in a nineteenth century decision of the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court: If the search warrant were illegal, or if the officer serving the warrant exceeded his authority, the party on whose complaint the warrant issued, or the officer, would be responsible for the wrong done; but this is no good reason for excluding the papers seized as evidence, if they were pertinent to the issue, as they unquestionably were. When papers are offered in evidence, the court can take no notice how they were obtained, whether lawfully or unlawfully; nor would they form a collateral issue to determine that question.24\n\nThe principle that a violation of the constitutional right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures requires exclusion of the evidentiary fruits of the violation was first suggested in 1886 in Boyd v. United States,25 but it was not until 1914 in Weeks v. United States26 that the USSC declared exclusion to be required as a matter of law. Although the precise basis for the Weeks decision is not free from doubt, the Court appears to view the admission of illegally obtained evidence as a violation the Fourth Amendment. The Court wrote that “[t]he effect of the Fourth Amendment is to put the courts of the United States and Federal officials, in the exercise of their power and authority, under limitations and restraints as to the exercise of such power\n\n20\n\nSee, e.g., California v. Acevedo, 500 U.S. 565 (1991). See, e.g., Schneckloth v. Bustamonte, 412 U.S 218 (1973) 22 See, e.g., South Dakota v. Opperman, 428 U.S. 364 (1976). 23 United States v. The La Jeune Eugenie, 26 F. Cas. 832, 844 (Cir. Mass.,1822). 24 See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Dana, 43 Mass. 329, 337 (1841). 25 116 U.S. 616 (1886). 26 232 U.S. 383 (1914). 21\n\n1 The United States: The Rise and Fall of the Constitutional Exclusionary Rule\n\n9\n\nand authority”.27 and that “[i]f letters and private documents can thus be seized and held and used in evidence against a citizen accused of an offense, the protection of the Fourth Amendment, declaring his right to be secure against such searches and seizures, is of no value, and, so far as those thus placed are concerned, might as well be stricken from the Constitution”.28 In announcing its holding the Court stated that “there was involved in the order refusing the application [to exclude the evidence] a denial of the constitutional rights of the accused”.29 At the time Weeks was decided the substantive protections of the Fourth Amendment were not applicable to the actions of state officials, and the exclusionary rule announced in Weeks applied only to cases prosecuted in federal court. Although state constitutions and statutes included protections against official intrusions on privacy, only a minority of states prohibited the use of the fruits of unlawful searches or seizures as evidence. In 1949 the USSC held in Wolf v. Colorado30 that the due process guarantee of the Fourteenth Amendment encompasses the same prohibition against unreasonable searches and seizures stated in the Fourth Amendment. The effect of this ruling was to impose on state officials as a matter of federal constitutional law the same restrictions applicable to federal officials under the Fourth Amendment. The Court also held, however, that the exclusionary rule announced in Weeks and applicable to Fourth Amendment violations by federal officials did not apply to violations by state officials. Twelve years after Wolf was decided the USSC reversed itself. In Mapp v. Ohio31 the Court held that the exclusionary rule announced in Weeks applies to the fruits of unlawful seizures carried out by agents of the state and offered in criminal prosecutions before state courts. The Mapp holding is necessarily based on the US constitution since that is the sole basis of the USSC’s power over the conduct of state trials. However, the fact that the exclusionary rule is constitutionally based does not fully resolve the relation between the rule of evidence and the Fourth Amendment right, and the Court’s opinion in Mapp is on that issue somewhat equivocal. There is language in Mapp supportive of the understanding of the exclusionary rule expressed in Weeks as an inseparable component of the Fourth Amendment right. The Court described the exclusionary rule as “an essential part of both the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments”,32 and held that “all evidence obtained by searches and seizures in violation of the Constitution is, by that same authority, inadmissible in a state court”.33 In explaining why the exclusionary rule was constitutionally required the Court stated that, in the absence of a rule requiring exclusion of illegally obtained evidence, “the freedom from state invasions of privacy would 27\n\nIbid, 391–92. Ibid, 393. 29 Ibid, 398. 30 338 U.S. 25 (1949). 31 367 U.S. 643 (1961). 32 Ibid, 657. 33 Ibid, 655. 28\n\n10\n\nM.E. Cammack\n\nbe so ephemeral and so neatly severed from its conceptual nexus with the freedom from all brutish means of coercing evidence as not to merit this Court’s high regard as a freedom ‘implicit in the concept of ordered liberty’”.34 These statements suggest that the admission of illegally seized evidence in state criminal trials is itself a violation of the federal constitution. There is other language in Mapp, however, that supports the understanding of the exclusionary rule articulated in Wolf as a judicially created prophylactic mechanism for effectuation of constitutional privacy protections. The Court quoted language from a case decided the year before describing the exclusionary rule as designed “to deter—to compel respect for the constitutional guarantee in the only effectively available way—by removing the incentive to disregard it”.35 A substantial portion of the opinion is devoted to an argument that the experience of states with alternatives to the exclusionary rule has proven other remedies to be ineffective. The premise of this argument is that the exclusionary rule is constitutionally required or justified not because admission of illegally seized evidence violates the constitution but because all other enforcement mechanisms have failed. While the Court labeled these “factual considerations” as “not basically relevant” to the decision, the inclusion of the argument would seem to indicate a degree of ambivalence over the grounds for the decision. Although the constitutional exclusionary rule has served as the principal enforcement mechanism for violations of the law of search and seizure for nearly half a century, the jurisprudential foundations and legitimacy of the rule continue to be disputed. While the membership of the USSC has always included both supporters and critics of the exclusionary rule, the balance of views has shifted in recent decades. In the years after Mapp a majority of the USSC seemed to regard the admission of illegally seized evidence as a violation of the constitution. Although the timing of the shift cannot be pinpointed with precision, the current USSC majority clearly takes a different view. The Court has unequivocally rejected the proposition that exclusion of illegally seized evidence is required by the Fourth Amendment, and regards the exclusionary rule as a judicially created deterrent remedy designed to protect the right against unreasonable search and seizures. The contrasting understandings of the exclusionary rule received particularly clear expression in the opinions filed in the 1984 decision in United States v. Leon,36 the case in which the Court first recognized the so-called “good faith” exception to the exclusionary rule. The majority opinion in the case was written by Justice Byron White, a long-time advocate for the view that the benefits of the exclusionary rule, in deterring violations of the Fourth Amendment, should be weighed against the costs of lost evidence, and that application of the rule should be limited to situations where its deterrent potential is significant. Justice White rejects the view that\n\n34\n\nIbid. Ibid, 656 (quoting Elkins v. United States, 364 U.S. 206, 217 (1960)). 36 468 U.S. 897 (1984). 35\n\n1 The United States: The Rise and Fall of the Constitutional Exclusionary Rule\n\n11\n\n“the exclusionary rule is a necessary corollary of the Fourth Amendment”.37 The exclusion of illegally seized evidence is not itself a part of the Fourth Amendment guarantee since “the wrong condemned by the Amendment is ‘fully accomplished’ by the unlawful search or seizure itself”.38 That conclusion is based on the text of Fourth Amendment, which “contains no provision expressly precluding the use of evidence obtained in violation of its commands”, and on an examination of the Amendment’s origins and purposes, which “makes clear that the use of fruits of a past unlawful search or seizure ‘work[s] no new Fourth Amendment wrong’”.39 Because a violation of the Fourth Amendment is complete upon the occurrence of an unlawful search or seizure, the exclusionary rule cannot and was not intended to serve as a “cure” for the constitutional violation. Much like a civil suit for damages, the rule “operates as ‘a judicially created remedy designed to safeguard Fourth Amendment rights generally through its deterrent effect, rather than a personal constitutional right of the party aggrieved’”.40 The dissenting opinion of Justice Brennan in Leon sets forth the alternative understanding of the Fourth Amendment exclusionary rule that regards the right against governmental interference with privacy or liberty and the right to exclude the fruits of that interference as “coordinate components of the central embracing right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures”.41 Justice Brennan’s conclusion that the exclusionary remedy is inseparable from the underlying substantive guarantee is premised on a belief that the prohibition against unreasonable search and seizure is directed at the government as a whole, including the courts, and that exclusion of illegally obtained evidence is necessary to give effect to the Amendment’s essential purpose. The judiciary is responsible, no less than the executive, for ensuring that constitutional rights are respected…. Because seizures are executed principally to secure evidence, and because such evidence generally has utility in our legal system only in the context of a trial supervised by a judge, it is apparent that the admission of illegally seized evidence implicates the same constitutional concerns as the initial seizure of that evidence. Indeed, by admitting unlawfully seized evidence, the judiciary becomes a part of what is in fact a single governmental action prohibited by the terms of the Amendment.42\n\nThus, when courts admit illegally obtained evidence they become complicit in a violation of the constitution. As Judge (later Justice) Benjamin Cardozo stated in a case rejecting the exclusionary rule as a matter of state law, “[t]he thought is that in appropriating the results, [the court] ratifies the means”.43\n\n37\n\nIbid, 905. Ibid, 906 (quoting United States v. Calandra, 414 U.S. 338, 454 (1974)). 39 Ibid, (quoting United States v. Calandra, 414 U.S. 338, 454 (1974)). 40 Ibid, (quoting United States v.

Cammack\n\nIdentifying the jurisprudential basis for the Fourth Amendment exclusionary rule is of more than simply academic significance. To begin, the question of the source and basis of the rule may determine whether the rule survives. If the constitution guarantees a right against the use at trial of evidence seized in violation of the Fourth Amendment then neither Congress nor the USSC has the power to abolish it. On the other hand, if the exclusionary rule is deemed to be a judicially created mechanism for protecting the Fourth Amendment by preventing its violation there presumably exist circumstances in which the Court that fashioned the rule could also do away with it. In addition to its importance to whether the USSC or Congress could someday abolish the Fourth Amendment exclusionary rule, the question of the jurisprudential foundation for the rule also bears on the scope of its current application. This is because the characterization of the rule as either a constitutional right or a judicially fashioned remedy profoundly affects the degree of control courts may exercise over the rule’s scope and application. The USSC has the power to define the circumstances in which constitutional rights may or may not be enforced only within narrow limits. As a general matter, enforcement of a constitutional right can be set aside only on the basis of a countervailing constitutional command. The Supreme Court’s power over a rule of its own making is much broader. Under the majority view the use of evidence obtained as a result of an unlawful search or seizure is not itself a cognizable injury but exists in the service of an analytically distinct right of privacy. Like a civil action for damages, the exclusionary rule is understood as a forwardlooking behavioral device for discouraging the police from engaging in unlawful searches or seizures by removing the evidentiary profits. Understood within this framework, the question whether illegally seized evidence should be excluded depends on whether exclusion will sufficiently advance the rule’s deterrent purpose.\n\n1.2.3\n\nThe Fruit of the Poisonous Tree Doctrine\n\nIn Weeks v. United States—the case in which the exclusionary rule was first announced—the evidence that was ordered suppressed was discovered and seized during the course of the unlawful search that constituted the predicate for invoking exclusion. The USSC has made clear, however, that the facts of that case do not define the full reach of the Fourth Amendment exclusionary rule, since limiting exclusion to the immediate fruits of official misconduct would seriously compromise if not entirely vitiate the rule’s effectiveness. That point is forcefully illustrated by the facts of Silverthorne Lumber Co. v. United States44 decided by the USSC in 1920. The posture of the case when it reached the USSC involved a challenge to an order holding the petitioners in contempt of court for their refusal to surrender\n\n44\n\n251 U.S. 385 (1920).\n\n1 The United States: The Rise and Fall of the Constitutional Exclusionary Rule\n\n13\n\ndocuments demanded by the prosecutor pursuant to subpoena. The documents at issue had earlier been seized during a search of the petitioners’ offices, but were then returned to the petitioners after the search was found to have been unconstitutional. Before returning the documents, however, the prosecutor made copies of their contents. The information gained as a result of the illegal seizure of the documents was then used to obtain the subpoena that commanded their surrender. Sanctioning the scheme used in Silverthorne would go a long way toward nullifying the exclusionary rule and, as Justice Holmes’ opinion in the case stated, “[i]t reduces the Fourth Amendment to a form of words”.45 For that reason the reach of the exclusionary rule is not confined to evidence discovered as a direct consequence of a constitutional violation. “The essence of a provision forbidding the acquisition of evidence in a certain way,” according to the Court, is “not merely [that] evidence so acquired shall not be used before the Court but that it shall not be used at all”. 46 In terms of the fruit of the poisonous tree metaphor by which the doctrine is commonly articulated, the rule requires exclusion of both “direct” or “primary” as well as “indirect” or “derivative” fruits of unconstitutional official conduct.47\n\n1.2.4\n\nThe Standing Doctrine\n\nUnder the fruit of the poisonous tree doctrine all evidence obtained as a causal consequence of a violation of the Fourth Amendment is presumptively inadmissible. However, the doctrine has never been interpreted as absolute or unqualified. Probably the most significant limitation on the application of the Fourth Amendment exclusionary rule is the standing doctrine. The concept of standing is not peculiar to the Fourth Amendment but is used throughout the law to identify which parties are entitled to claim the benefit of a legal rule or duty. Similarly, the requirement of standing is unrelated to the nature of the remedy that is being claimed. A party seeking money damages for a violation of the Fourth Amendment must satisfy the same standing requirements as a party seeking the exclusion of illegally obtained evidence in a criminal prosecution. Whether a party has standing to claim a constitutional protection depends on whether that party “belongs to the class for whose sake the constitutional protection is given”.48 As is true of constitutional rights in general, rights under the Fourth Amendment are regarded as strictly personal. This means that only those who have\n\n45\n\nIbid, 392. Ibid. 47 The fruit of the poisonous tree metaphor was first suggested in an opinion by Justice Frankfurter in a case involving the admissibility of evidence obtained as a result of a violation of a federal statute, Nardone v. United States, 308 U.S. 338 (1939), but was later extended to the constitutional exclusionary rule as well. Wong Sun v. United States, 371 U.S. 471 (1963). 48 New York ex rel. Hatch v. Reardon, 204 U.S. 152, 160 (1907). 46\n\n14\n\nM.E. Cammack\n\nthemselves suffered a Fourth Amendment violation are entitled to assert the violation and secure a remedy. In order to obtain the benefit of the exclusionary rule the party seeking exclusion “must have been a victim of a search or seizure … as distinguished from one who claims prejudice only through the use of evidence gathered as a consequence of a search or seizure directed at someone else”.49 The rule that only those who have suffered an unlawful search or seizure are entitled to invoke the exclusionary rule is arguably in tension with the current rationale for the rule as designed to deter Fourth Amendment violations. The logic of deterrence would seem to dictate that applying the exclusionary rule more widely would have the effect of further reducing the frequency of Fourth Amendment violations. Indeed, limiting the exclusionary rule to the victims of unlawful searches or seizures opens the possibility that police will conduct searches they know are unlawful in anticipation that those against whom the unlawfully obtained evidence is to be used will lack standing to seek exclusion.50 The Supreme Court has acknowledged that expanding the scope of the exclusionary rule by making it available to parties against whom unlawfully seized evidence is being used would increase the rule’s deterrent impact. In explaining its refusal to extend exclusion beyond those who have suffered a Fourth Amendment violation the Court has emphasized that the gains in deterrence achieved through applying the exclusionary rule more broadly must be balanced against its cost in terms of lost evidence and possibly lost convictions. The Court has held that the balance of costs and benefits does not warrant expanding exclusion beyond the victims of unlawful searches or seizures. It has adhered to that view even when it had the effect of permitting the government to use the evidentiary fruits of a deliberate violation of the Fourth Amendment. In United States v. Payner51 investigators for the Internal Revenue Service conducted a search of a banker’s briefcase that they knew was unlawful after being advised that the standing doctrine would prevent bank customers against whom the illegally obtained documents were to be used from objecting to their admission at trial. Although acknowledging the interest in deterring “deliberate intrusions into the privacy of persons who are unlikely to become defendants in a criminal prosecution,”52 the USSC concluded that that interest “does not justify the exclusion of tainted evidence at the instance of a party who was not the victim of the challenged practices”.53 Just as states may provide greater protection against searches and seizures under their own constitutions than is guaranteed by the Fourth Amendment, states may also apply their own exclusionary rules more broadly than the federal rule. Nearly\n\n49\n\nJones v. United States, 362 U.S. 257, 261 (1960). See, e.g., Rakas v. Illinois, 439 U.S. 128, 157 (1978) (White, J. dissenting) (stating that decision that passengers qua passengers do not have standing to contest search of car amounts to declaring “open season” on search of cars as far as passengers are concerned). 51 447 U.S. 727 (1980). 52 Ibid, 733. 53 Ibid, 735. 50\n\n1 The United States: The Rise and Fall of the Constitutional Exclusionary Rule\n\n15\n\n40 years before the USSC extended the federal exclusionary rule to the states in Mapp v. Ohio, the Supreme Court of California held that evidence obtained in violation of the state constitution could not be used in a criminal prosecution.54 When presented with the question of who is entitled to claim the benefit of the exclusionary rule, the California Court expressly rejected the federal rule that standing is limited to victims of unlawful search or seizure.55 California’s “vicarious exclusionary rule” remained in effect until 1985 when it was abolished as a result of a ballot measure that added language to the California constitution providing that, subject to a few stated exceptions, “relevant evidence shall not be excluded in any criminal proceeding”.56\n\n1.2.5\n\nThe Independent Source Doctrine\n\nThe fruit of the poisonous tree doctrine extends the reach of the Fourth Amendment exclusionary rule to include indirect or derivative fruits of unconstitutional searches and seizures. The doctrine also functions as a limitation on the exclusionary rule by limiting the rule’s operation to evidence that was discovered as a causal result of a constitutional violation. The fact that an individual has suffered a violation of her constitutional rights does not immunize her from being prosecuted provided the evidence is acquired through lawful means. The application of the exclusionary rule has always required proof of a causal connection between the challenged evidence and a violation of the Fourth Amendment. There is room for disagreement about what that requirement means, however, and in recent years the Supreme Court has narrowed the scope of the exclusionary rule by expanding the circumstances in which evidence will be deemed to have been acquired by means that are independent of the constitutional violation.57 In its most recent decision on the independent source doctrine the Supreme Court extended the rule to circumstances in which the police discovered evidence unlawfully and then re-discovered the same evidence through lawful means. In United States v. Murray58 police had probable cause to believe that there was\n\n54\n\nPeople v. Mayen, 188 Cal. 237 (1922). People v. Martin, 45 Cal.2d 755 (1955). 56 California Constitution Article 1 Section 28(f)(2). The California Supreme Court held in In re Lance W., 37 Cal.3d 873, (1985) that this language was intended to permit exclusion of relevant, but unlawfully obtained evidence, only if exclusion is required by the United States Constitution. 57 The independent source doctrine was first recognized by the USSC in dicta in Silverthorne Lumber Co. v. United States, 251 U.S. 385 (1920). After holding that the prosecution could not use information gleaned from documents that were obtained through an illegal search to subpoena those same documents, the Court stated, “Of course this does not mean that the facts thus obtained become sacred and inaccessible. If knowledge of them is gained from an independent source they may be proved like any others”. Ibid, 392. 58 487 U.S. 533 (1988). 55\n\n16\n\nM.E. Cammack\n\nmarijuana inside a particular warehouse. Without obtaining a search warrant, the police forced entry into the warehouse where they observed large quantities of drugs. There was no one inside the warehouse at the time of the entry, and the police left the marijuana undisturbed. The police then proceeded to apply for a warrant. The warrant was approved 8 h after the initial entry, and the police returned to the warehouse where they seized the marijuana. The USSC’s analysis of the applicability of the independent source doctrine to these facts focused on an assessment of the costs and benefits of exclusion. The balancing of those costs and benefits, according to the Court, is to be guided by the principle that “[t]he interest of society in deterring unlawful police conduct and the public interest in having juries receive all probative evidence of a crime are properly balanced by putting the police in the same, not a worse, position than they would have been in if no police error or misconduct had occurred”.59 Since excluding evidence that has an independent source would put police in a worse position than they would have been in the absence of a violation, the question in Murray boils down to whether the prosecution is able to prove that the second lawful discovery was truly independent of the earlier illegality. The Court held that in order to establish that the second warranted search was not contaminated by the first warrantless entry the prosecution must demonstrate that neither the decision by the judge to issue the warrant nor the decision by the police to apply for a warrant was influenced by information obtained as a result of the illegal entry. To do this the prosecution must show, first, that the information contained in the warrant application was obtained by means independent of the illegal entry, and, second, that the police would have applied for a warrant even if they had not conducted the illegal search.\n\n1.2.6\n\nThe Inevitable Discovery Doctrine\n\nThe rule permitting the use of evidence discovered through means that are independent of a violation of the Fourth Amendment is not strictly speaking an exception to the fruit of the poisonous tree doctrine since, by definition, the discovery of the evidence is not a causal consequence of an unlawful search or seizure. However, the USSC has held that the principle underlying the independent source doctrine will in some circumstances justify admission of unlawfully discovered evidence for which there is no independent source. The independent source doctrine is based on a judgment that the deterrent purpose of the exclusionary rule requires that police not profit from a violation of the Fourth Amendment, but that the balancing of the benefits of deterring police misconduct against the cost of exclusion in terms of lost evidence does not justify placing the police in a worse position than they would\n\n59\n\nIbid, 537 (quoting Nix v. Williams, 467 U.S. 431, 443 (1984)).\n\n1 The United States: The Rise and Fall of the Constitutional Exclusionary Rule\n\n17\n\nbe if the constitution had not been infringed. The Court has held that, by this same logic, illegally obtained evidence is exempt from the exclusionary rule if it can be shown that the same evidence would have been discovered by legal means. To be admissible under the inevitable discovery exception the prosecution must prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the challenged evidence ultimately or inevitably would have been discovered by lawful means. Thus, in Nix v. Williams, 60 the case in which the inevitable discovery doctrine was first recognized, the Court upheld the admission of evidence concerning the condition of the body of a murder victim despite the fact that information about the location of the body was obtained illegally based on a determination that the body would inevitably have been discovered in the same condition through lawful means.61\n\n1.2.7\n\nThe Attenuation Doctrine\n\nIn Wong Sun v. United States62 the USSC held that the arrest of the defendant without probable cause did not require suppression of his statement made several days later where the defendant had been released on his own recognizance after a lawful arraignment and then returned voluntarily to the stationhouse where he made the statement. Quoting Nardone v. United States, the Court stated “the connection between the arrest and the statement had ‘become so attenuated as to dissipate the taint’”.63 The Court identified the purposes of the exclusionary rule as deterring lawless conduct by the police and closing the doors of the courts to any use of evidence obtained unconstitutionally. But neither Wong Sun nor the earlier decision in Nardone explained how the existence of an attenuated connection between a Fourth Amendment violation and the discovery of the evidence bears on those purposes or why such evidence is admissible. The current rationale for the attenuation doctrine was first set forth in a concurring opinion in Brown v. Illinois64 decided in 1975. Like Wong Sun, the issue in Brown concerned the admissibility of statements made by the defendant following his illegal arrest. The majority opinion analyzed the case under the dissipation of the taint approach used in Wong Sun. The Court also identified a number of factors relevant to determining whether, in a particular case, the connection between the constitutional violation and the discovery of the evidence has been sufficiently\n\n60\n\n467 U.S. 431 (1984). Nix v. Williams involved a violation of the Sixth Amendment right to counsel rather than a violation of the Fourth Amendment right against unreasonable search and seizure. Although the Supreme Court has not applied the inevitable discovery doctrine in the context of a Fourth Amendment violation there is no doubt that it is applicable in that context as well. 62 371 U.S. 471 (1963). 63 Ibid, 491 (quoting Nardone v. United States, 308 U.S. 338, 341 (1939)). 64 422 U.S. 590 (1975). 61\n\n18\n\nM.E. Cammack\n\nattenuated to warrant admission. The majority did not, however, attempt to relate its dissipation analysis to the purposes of the exclusionary rule. In a concurring opinion written by Justice Powell the significance of attenuation is explained in terms of its effect on the deterrent value of exclusion. “The notion of the ‘dissipation of the taint’ attempts to mark the point at which the detrimental consequences of illegal police action become so attenuated that the deterrent effect of the exclusionary rule no longer justifies its cost”.65 Thus, when the question of attenuation is viewed from the perspective of deterrence the nature of the constitutional violation becomes the primary focus of the analysis. The deterrent value of the exclusionary rule can be expected to be greatest in cases in which official conduct was flagrantly abusive of Fourth Amendment rights. Evidence obtained as a consequence of a flagrant violation should be admitted only with the “clearest indication of attenuation”. In the absence of police conduct that is willful or at least negligent, however, “the deterrence rationale of the exclusionary rule does not obtain” and there is “no legitimate justification for depriving the prosecution of reliable evidence”.66 The USSC added a new wrinkle to the attenuation doctrine in the recent case of Hudson v. Michigan.67 The issue in Hudson concerned the applicability of the exclusionary rule to violations of the so-called knock-and-announce rule, the requirement that police executing a search warrant provide the occupants an opportunity to admit them into the house before entering by force. The Court gave as one reason for holding that the exclusionary rule is never applicable to violations of the knockand-announce rule that by its nature the constitutional violation is attenuated from the evidence. The attenuation identified in Hudson is different from attenuation recognized in prior cases, however. This second form of attenuation is not based on the character of the causal links between the constitutional violation and the discovery of the evidence but on the relationship between the purposes served by the rule that was violated and the exclusion of evidence. Specifically, there is attenuation in this second sense when “the interests protected by the constitutional guarantee that has been violated would not be served by suppression of the evidence obtained”.68 The interests served by the knock-and-announce rule include protection against violence that could occur if the occupant mistakenly believed that the officers were intruders, the protection against the destruction of property caused by an unnecessary forced entry, and protection of privacy and dignity interests that can be compromised by a sudden entrance. Since the exclusion of evidence obtained following a violation of the knock-and-announce rule furthered none of those interests the Court found the discovery of the evidence to be attenuated.\n\n65\n\nIbid, 609 (1975) (Powell, J. concurring in part). Ibid, 612. 67 547 U.S. 586 (2006). 68 Ibid, 594. 66\n\n1 The United States: The Rise and Fall of the Constitutional Exclusionary Rule\n\n1.2.8\n\n19\n\nThe Good Faith Exception\n\nIn the past several decades the conservative majority on the USSC has increasingly emphasized deterrence as the sole justification for excluding evidence obtained in violation of the Fourth Amendment. The Court took the logic of deterrence furthest when in United States v. Leon69 it created an exception to the Fourth Amendment exclusionary rule for evidence seized by police while acting in good faith reliance on a search warrant that was later declared to be invalid. Under the good faith exception recognized in Leon, the exclusion of evidence based on an invalid warrant is not required if a reasonably well-trained police officer would have believed that the warrant was valid. The majority opinion in Leon takes as its starting point the premise that the exclusionary rule is not “a personal constitutional right of the aggrieved party” but rather “a judicially created remedy designed to safeguard Fourth Amendment rights generally through its deterrent effect”.70 Because an “unbending application of the exclusionary sanction to enforce ideals of governmental rectitude would impede unacceptably the truth-finding functions of judge and jury”,71 the applicability of the exclusionary rule is to be determined through a weighing of the deterrent benefits of exclusion against the costs in terms of lost evidence. In applying this balancing test to the situation in which police seize evidence under a warrant that is later found to be invalid the Court first rejects the view that exclusion is justified in order to deter misconduct or errors by judges. The exclusionary rule, according to the Court, “is designed to deter police misconduct rather than to punish the errors of judges and magistrates”.72 Furthermore, there is no evidence that judges and magistrates are inclined to ignore or subvert the Fourth Amendment and no basis for believing that excluding evidence seized pursuant to a warrant would have a significant deterrent effect on the issuing judge or magistrate. Thus, “[i]f exclusion of evidence pursuant to a subsequently invalidated warrant is to have any deterrent effect … it must alter the behavior of individual law enforcement officers or the policies of their departments”.73 The Court’s evaluation of the likely impact on police misconduct of excluding evidence obtained in reliance on a facially valid warrant concludes that the deterrent benefit of exclusion is minimal at best. “The deterrent purpose of the exclusionary rule necessarily assumes that the police have engaged in willful, or at the very least negligent, conduct”.74 For that reason, “where the officer’s conduct is objectively reasonable, ‘excluding the evidence will not further the ends of the exclusionary rule\n\n69\n\n468 U.S. 897 (1984). Ibid, 906 (quoting United States v. Calandra, 414 U.S. 338, 348 (1974)). 71 Ibid, 907 (quoting United States v. Payner, 447 U.S. 727, 734 (1980)). 72 Ibid, 916. 73 Ibid, 918. 74 Ibid, 919 (quoting United States v. Peltier, 422 U.S. 531, 539 (1975)). 70\n\n20\n\nM.E. Cammack\n\nin any appreciable way’”, and “[e]xcluding the evidence can in no way affect his future conduct unless it is to make him less willing to do his duty”.75 But application of the exclusionary rule to evidence obtained pursuant to a warrant that was later found to be invalid would not be appropriate even if exclusion did deter some police misconduct or create incentives for adherence to the commands of the Fourth Amendment. This is so because “when an officer acting with objective good faith has obtained a search warrant from a judge or magistrate and acted within its scope” there is in most cases “no police illegality and thus nothing to deter”.76 The Leon case involved a search pursuant to a warrant that was later found to be invalid because the evidence on which the warrant was based was found to be insufficient to establish probable cause. In Massachusetts v. Shepherd,77 a case decided on the same day as Leon, the Court applied the good faith exception to uphold the admission of evidence discovered under a warrant that was defective because it did not particularly describe the items subject to seizure.78 In the years since Leon the USSC has extended the good faith principle to a number of other contexts. In Illinois v. Krull79 the Court held the good faith exception applicable to warrantless administrative searches carried out in good faith reliance on a statute that was later declared to be unconstitutional, and in Arizona v. Evans80 the Court held that the good faith rule applied to police who reasonably relied on mistaken information in a court database that an arrest warrant was outstanding. Finally, in the 2009 decision of Herring v. United States81 the Court extended the good faith exception to the situation in which police rely on mistaken information regarding the existence of a warrant in a database maintained by police.\n\n1.2.9\n\nKnock-and-Announce\n\nIn Hudson v. Michigan,82 decided in 2006, the USSC took the unusual step of abolishing the exclusionary rule for an entire category of Fourth Amendment violations. The defendant in Hudson sought suppression of evidence seized during a search of his house under a search warrant. The suppression claim was based on a failure on the part of the officers executing the warrant to comply with what’s known as the knock-and-announce rule. Although not expressly stated in the Fourth Amendment, the USSC has found that\n\n75\n\nIbid, 920 (quoting Stone v. Powell, 428 U.S. 465, 539–540 (1976)) (White, J., dissenting). Ibid, 920–21. 77 468 U.S. 981 (1984). 78 The error resulted from the magistrate’s failure to strike out inapplicable language contained in form warrant application. The police officer who executed the warrant failed to discover the error because he relied on the magistrate’s assurance that the necessary modifications had been made. 79 480 U.S. 340 (1987). 80 514 U.S. 1 (1995). 81 555 U.S. 135 (2009). 82 547 U.S. 586 (2006). 76\n\n1 The United States: The Rise and Fall of the Constitutional Exclusionary Rule\n\n21\n\nknock-and-announce was considered a necessary part of a reasonable search at the time the constitution was adopted, and on that basis the Court has held knock-and-announce to be a requirement for a lawful search under current law. The rule requires that police executing a warrant provide the occupants of the search premises an opportunity to admit the officers and comply with their demands before using force to gain entry. The Michigan courts found that the rule had been violated because the police waited for just 3–5 s after announcing their arrival before entering the house. The USSC accepted the state courts’ conclusion that the police violated the Fourth Amendment but held that the violation did not require suppression of the evidence seized during the search. Justice Scalia’s opinion for the Court provided three separate reasons for holding that the exclusionary rule does not apply to violations of the knock-and-announce rule. The first two reasons were based on an application of existing exclusionary rule doctrine. The Court gave as its first reason for not requiring exclusion its conclusion that “the constitutional violation of the illegal manner of entry was not a but-for cause of obtaining the evidence”.83 That is, the police would have discovered the gun and the drugs inside the house whether the “preliminary misstep [of failing to allow the occupants an opportunity to respond] had occurred or not”.84 The Court next found that even if but-for causation between the constitutional violation and the discovery of the evidence were established suppression should be denied under the attenuation doctrine. Here the Court distinguished two meanings of attenuation. Attenuation can occur “when the causal connection is remote”,85 but even if the connection between the illegality and the evidence is direct, attenuation occurs when “the interest protected by the constitutional guarantee that has been violated would not be served by suppression of the evidence obtained”.86 Since the knock-and-announce rule serves interests wholly distinct from “the interest in preventing the government from seeing or taking evidence described in a warrant”, the exclusionary rule is inapplicable.87 The third reason given by the Court for eliminating the exclusionary rule for violations of the knock-and-announce rule carries the greatest implications for the future of the exclusionary rule. The Court applied the balancing test used in United States v. Leon and other cases and concluded that costs of excluding evidence following a violation of knock-and-announce outweigh the benefits. The costs of exclusion include not only “the grave adverse consequences that exclusion of relevant incriminating evidence always entails (viz., the risk of releasing dangerous criminals into society)” but also “a constant flood [of claims] of alleged failures to observe the rule” raising questions that are “difficult for the trial court to determine and even more difficult for an appellate court to review”.88 Application of the\n\n83\n\nIbid, 592. Ibid. 85 Ibid. 86 Ibid. 87 Ibid, 594. 88 Ibid, 595. 84\n\n22\n\nM.E. Cammack\n\nexclusionary rule to violations of knock-and-announce could also result in preventable violence against Mapp police and destruction of evidence, since “officers would be inclined to wait longer than the law requires” to avoid the “massive” consequences of running afoul of the rule.89 In weighing the benefits of the exclusion the Court stated that “[m]assive deterrence is hardly required” since police could be expected to have little incentive to violate the knock-and-announce rule.90 Finally, the Court argued that because of changed circumstances since the decision extended the Fourth Amendment exclusionary rule to the states exclusion may no longer be necessary to deter at least some police illegality. In particular the Court pointed to the increased availability of civil suits and the greater professionalism and internal discipline of police.91\n\n1.3\n\n1.3.1\n\nRules of Admissibility/Exclusion in Relation to Illegal Interrogations Involuntary Confessions\n\nUnder the common law of evidence, as applied in the United States, confessions of the accused that were found to be involuntary were excluded as presumptively unreliable.92 In 1897 in Bram v. United States93 the USSC constitutionalized the common law rule of evidence holding that exclusion of involuntary confessions was required by the privilege against compelled self-incrimination contained in the Fifth Amendment. At the time Bram was decided the Fifth Amendment prohibition against compelled self-incrimination was not understood to be applicable to the actions of state officials. However, in Brown v. Mississippi94 decided in 1936 the USSC held that the use of an involuntary confession at a state criminal trial violates the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. In 1964 the right against compelled self-incrimination became available as a second basis for exclusion of involuntary confessions in state court when the USSC held that the Fifth Amendment privilege was applicable to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment.95 Initially, at least,\n\n89\n\nIbid. Ibid, 596. 91 Ibid, 597–599. 92 See Hopt v. Utah, 110 U.S. 574 (1884) 93 168 U.S. 532 (1897). 94 297 U.S. 278 (1936). 95 Malloy v. Hogan, 378 U.S. 1 (1964). 90\n\n1 The United States: The Rise and Fall of the Constitutional Exclusionary Rule\n\n23\n\nthe due process clause and the self incrimination privilege established different standards: the self-incrimination standard was based on the broad definition of involuntariness adopted from the common law as the measure of a Fifth Amendment violation; the due process test has always been narrower than the common law rule. The two constitutional texts are now understood as defining a single test for the voluntariness of a confession based on the test developed in cases decided under the due process clause. The test for whether a confession is involuntary in violation of due process is whether the suspect’s will was overborne as a result of official coercion.96 Resolution of that issue is based on a case-by-case analysis of the totality of the circumstances, including the actions of the police in obtaining the confession and the characteristics or susceptibilities of the individual suspect. The use of deception to induce a confession, although relevant to whether the suspect’s will has been overborne, does not necessarily render a confession involuntary. Similarly, promises of leniency or threats of harsh treatment are evaluated in terms of their effect in overbearing the suspect’s will and do not invariably result in exclusion of a confession. The USSC has drawn a clear line when it comes to confessions obtained through threats or use of violence. A confession given in response to actual or threatened use of physical violence against the accused is involuntary.97 The USSC has addressed the scope of the exclusionary rule for violations of the due process right against the use of involuntary confessions only rarely. The only cases to address the issue directly involved the admissibility of an involuntary confession to impeach the defendant’s trial testimony. In Mincey v. Arizona98 the Court held that an involuntary confession is inadmissible for all purposes, including impeachment. Although the USSC has never decided the issue, it is generally assumed that the fruit of the poisonous tree doctrine applies to involuntary confessions and requires suppression of evidence obtained as an indirect result of an involuntary confession as well as the confession itself. It is also generally assumed that the limitations on the fruit of the poisonous tree doctrine developed in the Fourth Amendment context apply to secondary fruits of due process violations. Thus, evidence discovered as a result of an involuntary confession is admissible if the causal connection between the illegality and the discovery of the evidence is attenuated, and the evidence discovered as a consequence of a due process violation may be admitted if the same evidence would inevitably have been discovered through lawful means.\n\n96\n\nSpano v. New York, 360 U.S. 315 (1959). Arizona v. Fulminante, 499 U.S. 279 (1991). 98 437 U.S. 385 (1978). See also New Jersey v. Portash, 440 U.S. 450 (1979). 97\n\n24\n\n1.3.2\n\nM.E. Cammack\n\nThe Protection Against Unknowing Self-Incrimination: The Miranda Paradigm\n\nIn its 1966 decision in Miranda v. Arizona99 the USSC established the rule that a statement made in response to custodial interrogation may not be used at trial unless the suspect has first been advised of certain rights and knowingly and voluntarily waived those rights. Specifically, the suspect must be informed that she has a right not to speak and that if she does speak what she says may be used against her. As a further protection against official compulsion to speak the suspect must be told that she has a right to have an attorney present during interrogation, and that if she cannot afford to hire an attorney one will be provided. These rights can be waived, and statements obtained following a knowing and voluntary waiver may be used at trial. If the suspect invokes either the right to silence or the right to have an attorney present during interrogation further protections come into play. A decision by the suspect to waive her rights and answer questions can be reversed at any point during the interrogation, and statements obtained after the suspect has indicated that she will no longer answer questions or wishes to have an attorney present are inadmissible. The Miranda doctrine was born of the USSC’s frustration with the due process standard as the exclusive mechanism for regulating the conduct of the police and adjudicating the admissibility of pre-trial confessions. With Miranda the Court sought to establish a clear, easily administered rule to replace the fact-specific case-by-case approach required under the due process approach.100 The requirements set forth in Miranda are based on the Fifth Amendment right against compelled self-incrimination made applicable to the states through the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. While the imposition of the Miranda rule on the states necessarily means that it is based on the constitution, there is some uncertainty in the decision as to the precise relationship between the procedures it prescribes and the right to be free from compelled self-incrimination. The Court explained the need for the procedures mandated in the case in terms of the compulsion that is inherent in custodial interrogation. The general tenor of the opinion suggests that any statement obtained in the absence of warnings and waiver is compelled in violation of the Fifth Amendment. At one point in the opinion, for example, the Court writes that “[u]nless adequate protective devices are employed 99\n\n384 U.S. 436 (1966). The Miranda doctrine was controversial from the start. Even the rule’s supporters acknowledge that the Court’s decision has a legislative quality to it that is atypical of the incrementalism and case-by-case approach to law making that generally characterizes common law decision-making. Miranda’s critics contend that the USSC has the power to enforce the commands of the constitution but it does not have the authority to establish procedures to prevent the constitution from being violated. The Miranda scheme has also been criticized on the ground that it goes too far in discouraging suspects from making lawful, voluntary confessions. While the impact of Miranda in reducing the frequency of confessions is disputed, the case clearly has not eliminated police interrogation as a mechanism for gathering evidence for trial, as some opponents had predicted.\n\n100\n\n1 The United States: The Rise and Fall of the Constitutional Exclusionary Rule\n\n25\n\nto dispel the compulsion inherent in custodial surroundings, no statement obtained from the defendant can truly be the product of his free choice”.101 There is also language in the opinion, however, supportive of the view that the rule requires the exclusion of statements when there is a risk of compulsion in order to prevent the use of statements that are in fact compelled. The Court refers to the “potentiality for compulsion” and acknowledges that the statements made by Miranda and the other defendants that were ruled inadmissible in the case might not have been “involuntary in traditional terms”.102 The USSC’s current approach to defining the scope of exclusion for violations of Miranda parallels the approach followed in the Fourth Amendment context. Just as the reach of the Fourth Amendment exclusionary rule has come to turn on the constitutional status of the rule, the Court has linked the question of the evidentiary consequences of a Miranda violation to the question of the relationship between Miranda’s requirements and the constitution. Over the four decades since the case was decided, the Court’s Miranda jurisprudence has increasingly come to reflect a conservative understanding of the rule as a mechanism for preventing constitutional violations rather than as a statement of what the constitution requires. Because a violation of Miranda’s prophylactic procedures is not a violation of the constitution, Miranda’s exclusionary rule is limited to statements obtained as a direct result of a Miranda violation. The premises of the Miranda rule have been contested from the beginning, and the evolution of the balance of views held by members of the USSC is reflected in the Court’s decisions over the past 50 years. The Court first imposed limits on the Miranda exclusionary in a case decided in 1971. In Harris v. New York103 the Court held that a statement obtained in violation of Miranda may be used to impeach a defendant who testifies inconsistently with the out of court statement. The Court majority based its decision on a balancing of the costs of exclusion in denying the prosecution the means to test the credibility of the defendant’s testimony against the benefits of deterring “proscribed police conduct”. Although the Harris Court did not address the constitutional status of Miranda, the decision to allow the use of statements obtained in violation of Miranda for impeachment rests on an implicit assumption that a violation of Miranda is not a violation of the Fifth Amendment, since a statement that has been compelled contrary to the Fifth Amendment cannot be used for any purpose, including impeachment.104 The scope of the Miranda exclusionary rule came before the Court again 3 years after Harris in Michigan v. Tucker.105 The issue in Tucker was whether the Miranda rule prevented the prosecution from presenting the testimony of a witness who was discovered as a result of a statement made by the defendant without adequate warnings.\n\n101\n\nMiranda, 384 U.S. at 458. Ibid, 457. 103 401 U.S. 222 (1971). 104 Mincy v. Arizona, 437 U.S. 385 (1978). 105 417 U.S. 433 (1974). 102\n\n26\n\nM.E. Cammack\n\nAlthough the significance of the decision is somewhat muddied by the procedural posture of the case when it reached the Court,106 the opinion by Justice (later, Chief Justice) William Rehnquist proved to be a harbinger of the Court’s approach to the Miranda exclusionary rule. The Court’s analysis of the admissibility of the witness’s testimony focused on the jurisprudential underpinnings of the Miranda rule. The Court based its holding that the testimony was admissible in large part on a conclusion that the warnings mandated by Miranda are “not themselves rights protected by the Constitution but instead measures to insure that the right against compulsory selfincrimination [is] protected”.107 Because the violation related to “prophylactic” standards, the fruit of the poisonous tree analysis that might have required exclusion of the evidence did not apply since a violation of a prophylactic rule is not a poisonous tree. The USSC addressed the scope of the Miranda exclusionary rule once again in Oregon v. Elstad.108 The issue in Elstad concerned the effect of a statement obtained without Miranda warnings on the admissibility of a later statement made after the suspect had been informed of his rights and made a valid waiver. The Court held that the first unwarned statement did not require suppression of the second warned statement, but the majority opinion does not provide a clear explanation of the reason for the result or the principles that govern the admissibility of derivative fruits of Miranda violations. The opinion could be read as establishing that the consequences of a Miranda violation do not extend beyond exclusion of the statement that is a direct result of the violation. The Court questioned the relevance of the derivative fruits doctrine to violations of Miranda on the grounds that the fruit of the poisonous tree analysis “assumes the existence of a constitutional violation”, 109 and distinguished the treatment of secondary fruits of Miranda violations from the approach applicable to violations of the Fourth Amendment on the ground that the Miranda exclusionary rule is a prophylactic measure that “serves the Fifth Amendment and sweeps more broadly than the Fifth Amendment itself”.110 While these statements and other parts of the opinion could be taken as indicating that the Miranda exclusionary rule is limited to those statements obtained in violation of its requirements, other parts of the Court’s opinion suggest that the admissibility of the defendant’s second statement was based on the same attenuation analysis applied to the secondary fruits of Fourth Amendment violations. As support for its conclusion the Court emphasized the significance of police compliance with Miranda prior to the second statement in establishing\n\n106\n\nThe questioning of the defendant that produced the statement occurred before the Miranda decision was announced, but its requirements were nonetheless applicable retroactively because the trial occurred afterwards. The Court cited as one reason for finding that the Miranda rule did not require exclusion of the testimony of the witness discovered as a result of the Miranda violation the fact that the deterrent benefit of exclusion was diluted by the fact that officer who obtained the confession was acting in good faith. 107 Michigan v. Tucker, 417 U.S. 433, 444. 108 470 U.S. 298 (1985). 109 Ibid, 305. 110 Ibid, 306.\n\n1 The United States: The Rise and Fall of the Constitutional Exclusionary Rule\n\n27\n\nthat it was voluntary and “cures the condition that rendered the unwarned statement inadmissible”.111 And after having seemingly dismissed the approach to the admissibility of secondary fruits developed in the Fourth Amendment context, the Court relied on a leading Fourth Amendment attenuation case in support of its conclusion that the defendant’s second statement was a product of his own volition. The USSC’s characterization of Miranda in Tucker, Elstad and other cases112 undermined its jurisprudential basis and, by extension, the rule itself. In 2000 the Court was required to confront the implications of its decisions disparaging Miranda’s foundations when it agreed to review a lower court decision that had held that Miranda could be and had been overruled by an act of Congress. The case arose as a result of a statute enacted in 1968 that sought to displace Miranda by declaring any confession to be admissible provided it is voluntary. It is, of course, fundamental that an act of Congress cannot permit that which the constitution forbids. Because the USSC is the final authority on the meaning of the constitution, and because the Court’s decision in Miranda was commonly understood as a statement of what the constitution requires, the 1968 statute was for many years dismissed as an empty gesture. That began to change, however, as the Court’s repeated characterization of the Miranda warnings as a prophylactic safeguard and the Court’s statements that a violation of those safeguards is not a violation of the constitution raised doubts about the constitutional foundations of the decision. The issue was finally joined in 1999 when the US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit held in United States v. Dickerson113 that the Miranda decision had been overruled by the 1968 statute, and therefore the defendant’s voluntary statement obtained in violation of Miranda was admissible. Upon the defendant’s appeal to the USSC the Court’s conservative majority was presented with the opportunity to carry the implications of its deconstitutionalization of Miranda to their logical conclusion and overrule it. The USSC released its much-anticipated decision in Dickerson v. United States114 in 2000. The majority opinion by Chief Justice Rehnquist—the author of the opinion that had first described Miranda warnings as prophylactic safeguards rather than constitutional rights—rejected the argument that the case had been overruled. In an effort to navigate a course that would permit it to uphold the Miranda decision without disavowing the decisions that impugned its foundations the Court sought to finesse the issue of Miranda’s constitutional underpinnings by describing it as a\n\n111\n\nIbid, 310–311.
