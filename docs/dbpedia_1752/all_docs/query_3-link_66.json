        "text": "Between May and November, 1982, by authority of a warrant issued by the Minister for Justice, the private telephones of the plaintiffs, who were political journalists, were tapped. In January, 1983, the Minister for Justice issued a public statement in which he admitted the tapping. He further admitted that there had been no justification for the tapping and that what had occurred went beyond anything that could be explained as an error of judgment.\n\nThe plaintiffs brought proceedings for damages for the unlawful tapping of their telephones. In particular they claimed that the actions of the servants of the State amounted to a breach of their personal right to privacy and freedom from unlawful and unwarranted intrusion guaranteed by Article 40 of the Constitution. The defendants admitted the fact of the tapping but denied that there had been any illegality or that the plaintiffs' constitutional rights had been infringed.\n\nHeld by Hamilton P., in giving judgment for the plaintiffs, 1, that the right to privacy, though not specifically guaranteed by the Constitution, was one of the personal rights of the citizen which flowed from the Christian and democratic nature of the State.\n\nRyan v. The Attorney General [1965] I.R. 294 and Norris v. The Attorney General[1984] I.R. 36 considered.\n\n2. That the consitutional right to privacy included the right to hold private telephone conversations without deliberate, conscious and unjustified intrusion by servants of the State.\n\n3. That the right to privacy was not an unqualified right but was subject to the constitutional rights of others and to the requirements of public order, public morality and the common good.\n\n4. That the tapping of the plaintiffs' telephones had been deliberate, conscious and unjustifiable and was an actionable infringement of their constitutional rights.\n\nMeskell v. Córas Iompair Éireann éireann [1973] I.R. 121 applied.\n\n5. That while the reputations of the plaintiffs had been vindicated by the statement of the Minister for Justice, the damage suffered by them had been aggravated by the fact that the tapping had been done by an organ of state which was constitutionally obliged to defend their rights."
