        "text": "In the Nölkenbockhoff case[*],\n\nThe European Court of Human Rights, taking its decision in plenary session pursuant to Rule 50 of the Rules of Court and composed of the following judges:\n\nMr. R. Ryssdal, President,\n\nMr. J. Cremona,\n\nMr. Thór Vilhjálmsson,\n\nMrs. D. Bindschedler-Robert,\n\nMr. G. Lagergren,\n\nMr. F. Gölcüklü,\n\nMr. F. Matscher,\n\nMr. J. Pinheiro Farinha,\n\nMr. L.-E. Pettiti,\n\nSir Vincent Evans,\n\nMr. R. Macdonald,\n\nMr. C. Russo,\n\nMr. R. Bernhardt,\n\nMr. J. Gersing,\n\nMr. A. Spielmann,\n\nMr. J. De Meyer,\n\nMr. N. Valticos,\n\nand also of Mr. M.-A. Eissen, Registrar, and Mr. H. Petzold, Deputy Registrar,\n\nHaving deliberated in private on 26 February and 24 June 1987,\n\nDelivers the following judgment, which was adopted on the last-mentioned date:\n\nPROCEDURE\n\n1. The case was referred to the Court by the European Commission of Human Rights (\"the Commission\") on 28 January 1986, within the three-month period laid down by Article 32 § 1 and Article 47 (art. 32-1, art. 47) of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\"the Convention\"). It originated in an application (no. 10300/83) against the Federal Republic of Germany lodged with the Commission under Article 25 (art. 25) by a national of that State, Mrs. Martha Nölkenbockhoff, on 7 February 1983.\n\nThe Commission’s request referred to Articles 44 and 48 (art. 44, art. 48) and to the declaration whereby the Federal Republic of Germany recognised the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court (Article 46) (art. 46). The purpose of the request was to obtain a decision as to whether or not the facts of the case disclosed a breach by the respondent State of its obligations under Article 6 § 2 (art. 6-2).\n\n2. In response to the enquiry made in accordance with Rule 33 § 3 (d) of the Rules of Court, Mrs. Nölkenbockhoff stated that she wished to take part in the proceedings pending before the Court and designated the lawyer who would represent her (Rule 30).\n\n3. On 28 January 1986, the President of the Court decided that in the interests of the proper administration of justice this case and the Lutz and Englert cases should be considered by the same Chamber (Rule 21 § 6).\n\nThe Chamber of seven judges to be constituted included, as ex officio members, Mr. R. Bernhardt, the elected judge of German nationality (Article 43 of the Convention) (art. 43), and Mr. R. Ryssdal, the President of the Court (Rule 21 § 3 (b)). On 19 March 1986, in the presence of the Registrar, the President drew by lot the names of the other five members, namely Mr. F. Matscher, Mr. J. Pinheiro Farinha, Mr. L.-E. Pettiti, Sir Vincent Evans and Mr. R. Macdonald (Article 43 in fine of the Convention and Rule 21 § 4) (art. 43).\n\n4. After assuming the office of President of the Chamber (Rule 21 § 5), Mr. Ryssdal consulted, through the Deputy Registrar, the Agent of the German Government (\"the Government\"), the Delegate of the Commission and the lawyer for the applicant on the need for a written procedure. On 2 April, he directed that the Agent and the applicant’s lawyer should have until 1 July 1986 to file memorials and that the Delegate should be entitled to reply in writing within two months (Rule 37 § 1).\n\nThe President twice extended the first of these time-limits - on 3 July until 31 October, and on 10 November until 21 November 1986.\n\n5. The applicant’s memorial - drafted in German, with the President’s leave (Rule 27 § 3) - was lodged with the registry on 1 July 1986 and the Government’s on 19 November.\n\n6. On 29 November, the Chamber decided to relinquish jurisdiction forthwith in favour of the plenary Court (Rule 50).\n\n7. On 15 December, the Secretary to the Commission informed the Registrar that the Delegate would submit his observations at the hearing.\n\n8. The next day, having consulted - through the Deputy Registrar - the Agent of the Government, the Delegate of the Commission and the lawyer for the applicant, the President directed that the oral proceedings should open on 23 February 1987 (Rule 38). On 6 February, he granted the members of the Government’s delegation leave to speak in German (Rule 27 § 2).\n\n9. The hearing was held in public in the Human Rights Building, Strasbourg, on the appointed day. The Court had held a preparatory meeting immediately beforehand.\n\nThere appeared before the Court:\n\n- for the Government\n\nMrs. I. Maier, Ministerialdirigentin,\n\nFederal Ministry of Justice, Agent,\n\nMr. H. Stöcker, Ministerialrat, Federal Ministry of Justice,\n\nMr. W. Beitlich, Oberstaatsanwalt, Advisers;\n\n- for the Commission\n\nMr. A. Weitzel, Delegate;\n\n- for the applicant\n\nMr. J. Bergemann, Rechtsanwalt, Counsel.\n\nThe Court heard addresses by Mrs. Maier for the Government, by Mr. Weitzel for the Commission and by Mr. Bergemann for the applicant, as well as their replies to its questions.\n\n10. On various dates between 9 February and 22 May 1987, the Commission, the Government and the applicant filed a number of documents and written comments either at the Court’s request or of their own motion.\n\nAS TO THE FACTS\n\nI. PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n\n11. Mrs. Martha Nölkenbockhoff, a German national, is the widow and heir of Mr. Theodor Nölkenbockhoff, who died on 13 November 1981. She lives in Selm-Bork.\n\n12. Her husband was a senior manager in a holding company, Stumm AG, whose trading activities centred on iron, steel and fuel, including motor fuel. He joined the firm on 1 July 1967 and subsequently held a number of key positions in it.\n\nOn 25 October 1974, Stumm AG ceased payments by reason of insolvency and asked the Essen District Court (Amtsgericht) to set in motion composition proceedings (Vergleichsverfahren).\n\nOn 13 November 1974, Mr. Nölkenbockhoff was arrested under a warrant issued by the Essen District Court on 11 November; he was suspected among other things of bankruptcy offences. Other senior managers in the company were also arrested.\n\n13. On 17 May 1976, the indictment, which was 489 pages long, was served on Mr. Nölkenbockhoff and four co-defendants.\n\nThe trial hearings began on 29 October 1976 before the 6th Criminal Chamber (6. Grosse Strafkammer) of the Essen Regional Court (Landgericht). They lasted until 11 July 1980, two or three hearings being held each week. The court heard evidence from hundreds of witnesses, and several thousand documents were read out. The applicant’s husband was defended by two counsel, one of whom was assigned by the court.\n\n14. On 11 July 1980, the Regional Court delivered its judgment, which ran to 579 pages.\n\nMr. Nölkenbockhoff was found guilty inter alia on several charges of breach of trust (Untreue), criminal bankruptcy (Bankrott) and fraud (Betrug), and given an aggregate sentence of eight years’ imprisonment. His four co-defendants were also sentenced to prison terms - two of them, for more or less identical offences and a few additional ones, to nine years, nine months and to eight years, six months respectively; the other two, for aiding and abetting, to four years, three months each. In respect of a series of fraud charges, the Regional Court stayed the proceedings under Article 154 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (see paragraph 23 below); and it acquitted Mr. Nölkenbockhoff and two of his co-defendants on a number of other charges.\n\nIn determining the sentences, the Regional Court took into account as extenuating circumstances the length of the proceedings and, in respect of the applicant’s husband, his detention on remand for some three years; this period was deducted from the total sentence.\n\n15. Mr. Nölkenbockhoff..."
