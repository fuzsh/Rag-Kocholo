        "text": "I INTRODUCTION\n\nWestern foreign policy has two principal aims: to maintain security, and to protect and enhance trading interests. Allied to those aims, and indirectly supportive of them, is concern for justice and the rule of law, protection of human rights, and the promotion of mutual respect and understanding between peoples. Each of these factors applies to the island of Cyprus. The Eastern Mediterranean is important to Western security, to the situation in Iran, Iraq, the Gulf, the Caspian and the Middle East and in relation to the southern flank of NATO, where relations between Turkey and Greece are of importance. Western trading interests, whilst small in Cyprus itself, require stability in the region. Violations of human rights and breakdown of respect and understanding between peoples in the region threaten both principal foreign policy interests. Finally, Britain has residual legal rights and obligations relating to the island. If the Cyprus Question is to be understood it is vital that both of the peoples of Cyprus have a fair and equal opportunity to be heard, and that the subject be examined anew, un-constrained by any position which the Foreign & Commonwealth Office, the United Nations, nor anyone else may have taken. Regrettably, the Greek Cypriots have been able, using the governmental status to which they are not entitled, to silence the Turkish Cypriot voice, and shut them out of all official channels of communication, so that \"Cyprus\" has come to mean \"Greek Cyprus.\" No other significant group of people anywhere in the world is treated in this way. It is time that the world began to listen to the Turkish Cypriot point of view and to question the assumptions from which the Greek Cypriots have benefited for so long. Although the Turkish Cypriot leader, President Rauf DenktaÕ, has often met with the UN Secretary General, and has also had talks with the US Secretary of State, British Ministers would not until recently talk with him and they expected him to communicate via officials. They do however meet frequently with the Greek Cypriot leader. They would always say that a meeting with President Denkta \"would not be helpful at the present time,\" but this policy was severely criticised by many senior British Members of Parliament as being contrary to the principles of natural justice. One of those principles is that both sides of the case must always be given a fair and equal hearing. A welcome development was the visit by British Foreign Secretary Rifkind to Northern Cyprus on 16th December 1996 and his meeting there with President Denkta . The Labour Foreign Secretary, Robin Cook, also met President Denkta whilst shadow foreign secretary, and the Minister of State at the FCO, Joyce Quinn met him in Northern Cyprus on 23 April 1999. Foreign Office Minister Keith Vaz also met him in March 2001. The British Prime Minister and the US President should meet President Denkta themselves without further delay. The Turkish Cypriots and Greek Cypriots have been negotiating for 25 years, and have not reached agreement on a future political association between them. The Turkish Cypriot leaders suspended the UN Proximity Talks in November 2000 after eleven months when it became clear to them that, unless the international political environment changed, the Greek Cypriots were not going to agree to anything which the Turkish Cypriot people could accept. There are two main reasons for the impasse. The first is that Britain and the US have encouraged the world to treat the Greek Cypriots alone as the government of all Cyprus, despite Britain's own acknowledgement (FO telegram 1131 of 12th March 1964) that \"Cyprus Government\" could mean only a government which acts with the concurrence of its Turkish Cypriot and Greek Cypriot members. There has been no concurrence since 1963, and there is no \"doctrine of necessity\" which allows one partner to assault and terrorise the other and then claim the right to run the State alone. The Greek Cypriots have been asking the Turkish Cypriots to go back since 1967, but on terms which abrogate their basic rights and which they could not possibly accept. Nor could the Greek Cypriots be trusted, for even today racial hatred against Turkish people is incited in their schools, churches and military camps. The Greek Cypriots have no incentive to settle so long as they continue to be treated as the \"Government of Cyprus,\" and enabled to keep the Turkish Cypriots for so long as they please under an embargo against their trade and communications without any authority under Chapter VII of the UN Charter. The second reason for the impasse is that the European Union has given the Greek Cypriots the prospect of membership whether they settle with the Turkish Cypriots or not, despite the clear prohibition in Article 1 of the 1960 Treaty of Guarantee which two EU members - Greece and the UK - have signed. The Greek Cypriots now see EU membership as a means by which they can use political, legal, and perhaps even military, pressure to remove Turkey from Cyprus and leave the Turkish Cypriots again at their mercy. Article 2 of the Treaty puts Britain under a legal duty to veto their unilateral application but Britain has so far ignored it. So much for the Rule of Law, which Britain and the EU so often lecture others about. The issue is not how much progress the Greek Cypriots have made in adjusting their economy and legislation to EU conditions. Cyprus is the Turkish Cypriots' home as much as the Greek Cypriots' and it would be quite wrong for one to take it into the EU without the consent of the other. Nor can Cyprus lawfully join without Turkey's agreement to waive the prohibition contained in Article 1 of the 1960 Treaty. The Turkish Cypriots and Turkey would be willing to consent, but there must first be a settlement which would make it possible to implement the acquis in the special circumstances of Cyprus, and preserve the regional balance. It is ridiculous that the Greek tail is allowed to wag the European dog with threats to veto enlargement, and Greece must be persuaded of the unacceptability of its position. The EU has recently made it clear that another small country - Ireland - will not be allowed to obstruct enlargement. If the Greek Cypriots join the EU without a settlement, they would never agree to Turkey's membership, and they would irreparably damage Europe's relations with a country of 70 million people of enormous strategic and commercial importance. There is no good reason why Europe should take those risks for the sake of less than a million Greek Cypriots who do not even have law or morality on their side. The accession of Cyprus will have to wait. In April 2001 President Denktas of Northern Cyprus wrote as follows to the UN Secretary General: \"The EU must be made aware of the damage that it has done to the prospects for a settlement in the island by processing the unilateral and unlawful application made by the Greek Cypriot administration for accession to the EU, and the damage it continues to do by insisting on this totally wrong and misguided policy. Our repeated representations and efforts to make the EU, both as an institution as well as its individual member countries, understand and appreciate the possible consequences of this one-sided policy, have unfortunately been ignored. Let alone heeding our repeated calls and demarches in this respect, the EU is now seriously entertaining the offer of the Greek Cypriot administration to contribute to the EU Headline Goal within the context of the EU Common Security and Defence Policy. If the Greek Cypriot side succeeds in this endeavour also, it will have completed its policy of engaging the EU in the military as well as the political aspects of the Cyprus issue, to the detriment of the Turkish Cypriot party and all efforts aimed at reconciliation.\" There are many in the West who take the superficially attractive view that in the 21st century it is anachronistic to have fortified borders and that the situation in Cyprus, based as it is on separation of racially different peoples, is a kind of apartheid. However, in view of what has happened, and which is briefly described in these pages, the Turkish Cypriots have every right to defend themselves against the Greek Cypriots and to keep them out of Northern Cyprus. If they did not, they would be subjected to real apartheid, as they were from 1963-74 despite international guarantees, in which they the Turkish Cypriots were dominated and relegated to the position of second-class citizens, pending their ultimate expulsion from the island. The racists are those who tried to annihilate Turkish Cypriot men women and children simply because they were ethnically Turkish, and who persecuted and oppressed them for eleven years until Turkish soldiers rescued them. The Turkish Cypriots have at least as much right to protect themselves against the Greek Cypriots as the Albanian people of Kosovo had against the Serbs. If people do not wish to live together, why should they be forced to do so by others who will not themselves have to suffer the consequences? The Security Council has often called upon States to respect the \"independence and territorial integrity of the Republic of Cyprus\" but not even the UN Secretary General himself any longer believes in its \"territorial integrity\" nor in Security Council warnings against \"partition,\" as the plan annexed to the Ghali set of Ideas shows a Cyprus clearly divided between North and South. Insofar as the \"independence\" of Cyprus is constrained by the 1960 Treaties, the Security Council has never attempted to declare them invalid. Moreover, the Security Council has never accused Turkey of invasion or occupation. The Greek Cypriots claim that the Cyprus problem was caused by the landing of Turkish troops in 1974 and that if only they would withdraw, the problem would be solved. This is a serious misconception, for the landing of Turkish troops was the consequence, not the cause, of the problem. Moreover, there were in fact two military actions in 1974; the first was by Greece and the Greek Cypriots, which caused the second by Turkey. The Greek Cypriot political parties DIKO and EDEK \"are acting as if the Cyprus problem began and ended in 1974. They refrain from talking about the previous coups. The first coup was not in 1974, but only a few years after we had attained our independence (in 1960). Had it not been for the first coup there would not have been the 1974 coup.\" (Greek Cypriot journalist, Aleccos Constantinides, Alithia 14.12.85). The inhabitants of Cyprus have no common language except English and no common religion; nor have they any common culture. In March 1963 Archbishop Makarios said \"The [Independence] Agreements have created a State, but not a Nation.\" (Cyprus Mail 28.3.63) This being so, any approach to the Cyprus question which regards Cypriots as a nation is fundamentally flawed. \"The famous Cypriot consciousness was invented and encouraged by the British in the 1920s\" - Prodromos Prodromou The Guardian 30th January 1995 There are in fact two peoples of Cyprus - the Turkish Cypriots numbering about 200,000 and the Greek Cypriots numbering about 600,000. The Turkish Cypriots are mainly Moslems and the Greek Cypriots are mainly adherents of the Greek Orthodox Church. The UN Secretary-General made it clear in 1992 (UN doc. S/24472) that sovereignty \"emanates equally from both communities. One community cannot claim sovereignty over the other.\" \"The Turkish Cypriot community possesses the same political status as the Greek Cypriot community. The two communities participate in negotiations for the settlement of the Cyprus question on an equal footing, and the Greek Cypriot community should not enjoy any privileged position in the negotiations whether on substance or procedure by reason of the fact that it presents itself as the Government of the Republic of Cyprus.\" Eli Lauterpacht CBE QC (Opinion - UN doc. A/44/968, S/21463 (1990). Cyprus has never been part of the Greek state. It lies 40 miles from the coast of Turkey, and people from the Turkish mainland have inhabited the island since the earliest times. Cyprus is 250 miles from the nearest Greek island (Rhodes), and Athens is 460 miles away. The Cyprus question can be stated shortly as follows: The partnership republic formed in 1960 between the two peoples of Cyprus was destroyed in 1963. For the time being, Greek and Turkish Cypriots live apart. Does the future of Cyprus lie in a close political association or in an arms length relationship based on willing and active co-operation between political equals, each secure in its own sovereign territory and each with its own customs, traditions and identity? No solution to the Cyprus problem will work unless it is freely accepted by the inhabitants of the island who will have to live with it. Otherwise, there will be bloodshed again and there could be war between Turkey and Greece. There is therefore no point in trying to put pressure on Greece or Turkey to force either or both of the parties in Cyprus to accept what is to them unacceptable. The idea that Turkey can be pressurised, for the sake of Turkey's own European aspirations, to force the Turkish Cypriots into a settlement which would put them again at risk, is both unprincipled and unrealistic. Moreover, if pressure is to be applied, why only on Turkey? Why not on Greece and the Greek Cypriots? It would also be unrealistic for the Greek Cypriots to take any comfort from the idea that economic pressure will force Turkish Cypriots to emigrate, for they have been and will continue to be, replaced by Turkish families from the mainland, just as the Greek Cypriots have themselves allowed immigration from Greece and elsewhere into the South. Everyone who wishes Cyprus well prefers to look to the future but many commentators will readily use the events of 1974 to argue that the present state of affairs is unacceptable. They do not however go back before 20th July 1974. Refusal to consider the preceding 15 years means that important legal and political questions wrongly determined in favour of the Greek Cypriots remain undisturbed and remain a continuing source of friction between the parties. The most important of these is international treatment of the Greek Cypriot regime as the government of all Cyprus, and refusal to recognise the right of the Turkish Cypriots to establish their own state. It is therefore necessary to look in some detail at the reasons why the present situation has arisen and why, in consequence, both sides and particularly the less numerous Turkish Cypriots need reliable safeguards for their future. One of the most remarkable features of the Cyprus question is the extent to which the Greek Cypriots have been able to repudiate solemn international agreements and violate the human rights of the Turkish Cypriots on a massive scale and yet by a quite astonishing feat of public relations, have secured for themselves recognition as the government of all Cyprus and have persuaded the world that they, and not the Turkish Cypriots, are the injured party. The consequence of this is that they have been able to extract one-sided resolutions from the United Nations and other international organisations, and have been able to secure court judgments based on the fact of recognition which have been immensely damaging to the Turkish Cypriots (see the sections on Property, Human Rights, and Trade Embargo below). For more than thirty years past - ever since the overthrow of the 1960 Agreement - the Turkish Cypriots and their government have been faced with one of the hardest tasks in the whole range of international affairs - how to get the world to change its mind after it has got hold of the wrong end of the stick and clung to it year after year. It is in the nature of governments and international organisations that they are reluctant to admit that they have been in the wrong, or even to think it possible that they may have been mistaken. But that is the simple truth about the position which the world at large has taken up in regard to Cyprus from 1964 onwards. The Greek Cypriots have a professional political lobby, which is extremely well financed, and so effective that every time Cyprus is debated in the House of Commons or the American Congress one Greek Cypriot sympathiser after another rises to his feet. It seems impossible to have a balanced debate on the subject. The Turkish Cypriots have, for more than thirty years, been deprived of an official voice in the world and have been deprived of the financial resources to match the Greek Cypriots in the presentation of their case to the world community. It is the purpose of this handbook to help redress the balance and to lay the foundations for an understanding of the real nature of the Cyprus question.\n\nThe Greek Cypriot journalist, Stavros Angelides, wrote in Fileleftheros on 16th September 1990 \"With the passage of time we the Greek Cypriots forget, or we wilfully disregard, the events which led to the present situation in Cyprus. We forget our faults and we ask all the more emphatically everybody else to deliver to us justice as we understand it. We talk in generalities and in vague terms about UN Resolutions, and actually mean those which favour us. The others, such as Resolution 649 are not fair - we do not want them - let them go to hell.\" On 16th August 1985 the Greek Cypriot Daily \"Simerini\" lamented as follows: \"We believed that we were the centre of the Earth. We thought that we, small and insignificant as we are, would be capable of exercising policy on an intercontinental plane. But above all we underestimated the Turks. The unstable and fickle policy of our leaders has brought us to the brink of total disaster.\" On 15th August 1996 The Daily Telegraph wrote \"Turkish Cypriots have constitutional right on their side and understandably fear a renewal of persecution if the Turkish army withdraws.\" \"Greek and Turkish Cypriots living in harmony together is a nice idea but it's a dream. I saw the reality and realised that division is the best thing for both.\" Hugo Gobbi, former UN Special Representative for Cyprus (Cyprus Mail 12th October 1995). The driving force behind Greek Cypriot actions is the Greek Orthodox Church, which dreams of Hellenising Cyprus and annexing it to Greece. They will encourage the appearance of negotiations for as long as it is to their advantage, but they will never give up their claim to the whole island and will therefore never allow the Greek Cypriot political leaders to agree a settlement which legitimises a geographical base in Cyprus for the Turkish Cypriots. This church is immensely rich and powerful in Southern Cyprus, but there is no comparable force in the North. Although most Turkish Cypriots are Moslems they hardly ever attend the mosque, and their religious leaders have very little if any political power. back to the contents page\n\nII INDEPENDENCE FOR CYPRUS\n\nThe Colonial Period Cyprus became part of the Turkish Empire in 1571, at which time the population was a mixture of people whose origins were in many different parts of the Eastern Mediterranean and Europe. More than three hundred years later, on 4th June 1878, the island was leased to Britain by Turkey on terms that it was to be returned to Turkey when Britain no longer wanted it. However, Britain unilaterally annexed the island in 1914. By the Treaty of Lausanne in 1923 Turkey formally accepted this annexation and Britain declared the island a Crown Colony on 1st May 1925. On 10th January 1881 the High Commissioner in Cyprus informed the British Colonial Secretary (CO 67/18) that there were about 600 Hellenic subjects on the island. Greece began to encourage emigration to Cyprus and sent teachers, lawyers, doctors, and priests to organise the Greek community in the island in favour of annexing the island to Greece (ENOSIS). On 17th April 1895 the British Magistrate in Nicosia wrote that Greek schoolchildren had been organised to march through the Turkish quarter singing songs about \"the slaughter of the hated Moslems.\" This kind of demonstration was still happening in 1999. On 4th August 1900 the High Commissioner informed the Colonial Secretary (CO 67/124/26615) that the whole Greek school system on the island was being used as an organisation for Hellenic propaganda. This is still true today.\n\nOn 19th December 1912, during the Balkan wars, the Acting High Commissioner sent a petition from the Turkish Cypriots to the Colonial Secretary urging him not to hand Cyprus over to Greece. The Acting High Commissioner added (CO 67/167/41168) \"I fear that the Moslems have only too good a reason to be apprehensive for their lives and property if the Hellenic element gets the upper hand.\" During this period many Turkish Cypriot families were forced by poverty and by fear of a Greek takeover to emigrate to Turkey. At the outbreak of war in 1914 many more left, and between then and 1939 about 80,000 Turkish Cypriot families had settled in Turkey alone. There is no doubt that ENOSIS (annexation to Greece), invested as eir econth the most intense religious and nationalistic overtones, has been and perhaps still is, the principal obstacle to good relations between the Turkish Cypriots and the Greek Cypriots, and even between Turkey and Greece. On 20th October 1950 on the occasion of his enthronement as Archbishop, the future President of Cyprus, Makarios, declared \"I take the Holy Oath that I shall work for the birth of our national freedom and shall never waver from our policy of uniting Cyprus to mother Greece.\" Of course, Greek Cypriots today are much richer than they were in 1950 and many more of them have urban and cosmopolitan lifestyles, but attitudes deeply rooted in religion and nationalism are not easily changed. The more recent Greek Cypriot leader, George Vassiliou, spoke of Cyprus on 26th January 1989 as \"a Greek island and a bastion of Greece.\" That is the crux of the problem, for Cyprus is not a Greek island, but an island which belongs to both Greek and Turkish Cypriots. As long ago as 1907 Winston Churchill (then Under?Secretary of State for the Colonies) said: \"I think it only natural that the Cypriot people of Greek descent should regard their incorporation with their mother country as an ideal to be cherished; but I trust that those who feel so earnestly will not forget that they must show respect for the similar feelings of others.\" The Turkish Cypriots are just as fervently committed against the annexation of Cyprus to Greece, but they do not advocate the annexation of Cyprus to Turkey, knowing that it would be just as objectionable to the Greek Cypriots as ENOSIS is to themselves. Today they see integration of Northern Cyprus with Turkey as a last resort, if all else fails. Britain decided to decolonise the island, and in the House of Commons on 19th December 1956 the Colonial Secretary, Alan Lennox?Boyd, pledged that \"it will be the purpose of Her Majesty's Government to ensure that any exercise of self?determination should be effected in such a manner that the Turkish Cypriot community, no less than the Greek Cypriot community, shall in the special circumstances of Cyprus be given freedom to decide for themselves their future status.\" Churchill's advice was ignored by the Greek Cypriots, and from 1955 to 1960 the Greek Cypriot EOKA organisation, under the leadership of General Georgios Grivas, fought for ENOSIS; not independence. During the conflict hundreds of British people, Turkish Cypriots, and Greek Cypriots were murdered, and thousands of Turkish Cypriots fled from mixed villages where their homes and possessions had been destroyed. The 1960 Agreements Although by then the Greek Cypriots were more numerous, the Turkish Cypriots had lived in Cyprus for more than 400 years as a distinct community; and in exercise of their right of self?determination they were willing to join in forming a new Republic embracing the whole of the island (less the British sovereign bases) only if that basic fact of political life in Cyprus was formally recognised. The alternatives were two separate states, a condominium, division of the island between Greece and Turkey, restoration to Turkey, or continued British rule. The negotiations in Zurich and London preceding independence were long and difficult, but it was eventually agreed by way of compromise between all five participants; Britain, Greece, Turkey, the Turkish Cypriots, and the Greek Cypriots; that the new state would be a bi?communal Republic with a single territory but a unique Constitution which embodied an agreed political partnership between Greek and Turkish Cypriots, and which prohibited the political or economic union of Cyprus with any other State. At the conclusion of the negotiations the Greek Cypriot leader, Archbishop Makarios, said \"Sending cordial good wishes to all the Greeks and Turks of Cyprus, I greet with joy the Agreement reached and proclaim with confidence that this day will be the beginning of a new period of progress and prosperity for our country\". On 6th March 1959 President Eisenhower endorsed the agreement as \"a victory for common sense\" an \"imaginative act of statesmanship,\" and \"a splendid achievement.\" (US Dept. of State Bulletin p. 367). In the first Presidential elections in Cyprus Mr. John Clerides (father of Glafcos Clerides) stood against Makarios on a platform of opposition to the 1960 Agreements and lost by a majority of two to one of the Greek Cypriot electorate. Greek Cypriots now claim that they were pressurised into accepting the Agreements, but so were the Turkish Cypriots. The Agreement was a compromise for them both, and they should both have been expected to implement it in good faith. The Greek Cypriots did not, and they are now seeking to bring international pressure to bear on Turkey to force the Turkish Cypriots to accept a settlement on terms unacceptable to them. The bi?communal structure was fundamental to the 1960 accords, on the basis of which the Republic of Cyprus achieved independence, and recognition as a sovereign state from the international community. Accordingly, from its very inception the Republic of Cyprus was never a unitary state in which there is only one electorate with a majority and minority. The two communities were political equals and each existed as a political entity, just as both large and small states exist within the structure of the European Union. They did not however have the same constitutional rights because the agreements took into account the fact that there were more Greek Cypriots than Turkish Cypriots. The means by which the Constitution gave effect to the agreement were fourfold; political, legal, administrative, and military. The President was to be a Greek Cypriot and the Vice?President a Turkish Cypriot. Legislative authority was vested in a House of Representatives, of whom 70% would be Greek Cypriots and 30% Turkish Cypriots, but legislation and executive action on specified matters required the concurrence of both the President and Vice?President, including in particular foreign affairs. Moreover, legislation relating to certain matters of sensitivity as between the two communities required a separate majority of representatives from each community. It is important to note that the President, the Vice-President, and the Members of Parliament were all elected by members of their own community. The Greek Cypriots have therefore never had the right to elect all those officials themselves and to create a government wholly within their control. A Treaty of Alliance (Cmnd. 1093) permitted Greece to station 950 troops in Cyprus and Turkey 650 troops. A Treaty of Establishment reserved to Britain as its sovereign territory two military bases, one in the south at Akrotiri, the other on the border between north and south at Dekhelia. Certain other small areas of land were designated for use by Britain, the most important of which is a site high on the Troodos mountains where an electronic intelligence station is located. The Turkish Cypriot people, knowing that they could not enforce the agreement themselves, would never have agreed to join the 1960 Republic if the Greek Cypriots had not also accepted a Treaty of Guarantee which gave Turkey a legal right to intervene, with troops if necessary. The parties to the Treaty were the United Kingdom, Turkey, Greece, and the Republic of Cyprus. The Turkish Cypriots had seen what happened to the Turkish people of Crete under Greek hegemony, and knew that there would be no future for them in Cyprus without a Turkish military guarantee. Independence was formally granted on 16th August 1960. The case of Cyprus is sui generis, for there is no other State in the world which came into being as a result of two politically equal peoples coming together by the exercise by each of its sovereign right of self-determination, to create a functional federation within a single territory, and guaranteed by international treaty, to which each of them consented.\n\nback to contents III CONSTITUTION IGNORED\n\nIt became clear very soon after independence that the Greek Cypriots did not intend to abide by the Constitution, and that their entry into that solemn legal obligation with the Turkish Cypriots in 1960 had been a deception. On 28th July 1960 President Makarios said \"the agreements do not form the goal - they are the present and not the future. The Greek Cypriot people will continue their national cause and shape their future in accordance with THEIR will. In a speech on 4th September 1962, at Panayia, Makarios said \"Until this Turkish community forming part of the Turkish race which has been the terrible enemy of Hellenism is expelled, the duty of the heroes of EOKA can never be considered as terminated.\" It would be difficult to imagine a more vindictive, racist, policy than this. It is also an expansionist policy - the very charge which the Greek Cypriots laid against Turkey when Turkey intervened twelve years later to put an end to it. The Turkish Cypriots were told by the outside world to take no notice of statements of this kind. They were told that they were just rhetoric, or were for internal consumption within the Greek Cypriot community. However, the Turkish Cypriots were to discover that when Greek Cypriot leaders make statements of that kind they should be taken seriously. Similar statements are being made by Greek Cypriot leaders today, and Turkish Cypriots are still being urged not to take them seriously. Article 173 of the Constitution provided for separate municipalities for Turkish Cypriots in the five main towns. The Greek Cypriots refused to obey this mandatory provision and in order to encourage them to do so the Turkish Cypriots said they would not vote for the Government's taxation proposals. The Greek Cypriots remained intransigent, so the Turkish Cypriots took the matter to the Supreme Constitutional Court of Cyprus. The court comprised one Greek Cypriot judge, one Turkish Cypriot judge, and a neutral President. In February 1963 (Cyprus Mail 12.2.63) Archbishop Makarios declared on behalf of the Greek Cypriots that if the Court ruled against them they would ignore it. On 25th April 1963 the Court did rule against them (Turkish Communal Chamber v Council of Ministers 5 CLR (1963) 59, 77, 78) and they did ignore it. The President of the Court (a German citizen) resigned and the rule of law in Cyprus collapsed. In November 1963 the Greek Cypriots went further, and demanded the abolition of eight of the basic articles which had been included in the 1960 Agreement for the protection of the Turkish Cypriots, to which abolition the Turkish Cypriots were naturally reluctant to agree. The aim was to reduce the Turkish Cypriot people to the status of a mere minority, wholly subject to the control of the Greek Cypriots, pending their ultimate expulsion from the island. They had prepared a written plan for this purpose, called the Akritas Plan. Glafcos Clerides, the current Greek Cypriot President, has written his memoirs, entitled \"Cyprus - My Deposition\" in four volumes, published by Alithia publishing company, Nicosia, 1989-1991. In these memoirs he admits that there was no need for constitutional amendments. According to him, \"Makarios, at the head of the bicommunal state of Cyprus, had decided to proceed, stage by stage, to the unilateral abrogation of the rights granted to the Turkish community by the Zurich and London Agreements and to reduce its political status to a minority, using prematurely, the excuse of the unworkability of certain provisions of the constitution.\"\n\nHe goes on to say that \"An honest evaluation of the situation during the period 1960-63, divorced from propaganda tendencies would lead to the conclusion that there was no need to press for constitutional amendments\". Nevertheless according to Clerides the Greek Cypriot leader Makarios \"refused to accept practical solutions failing short of constitutional amendments\" in spite of the fact that Clerides had himself \"reached an agreement with the Turkish Cypriot side for a series of practical solutions\". Clerides admits that \"the delicate period of 1960-63, when both communities were questioning the sincerity of the other over their real commitment to independence, was not the proper time to request constitutional amendments on the grounds that the constitution was unworkable, when in fact unworkability could not be established\".\n\nGreek Cypriots today often claim that constitutional amendments e \"Turkishtable because the Turkish Cypriots abused their veto power, but according to Clerides: \"The veto powers were not used either by the President or the Vice President on any law or decision of the House of Representatives. The Vice President used once, I believe, his veto power on a decision of the Council of Ministers relating to the composition of the units of the army of the Republic. The Greek Cypriot side was actually pleased the Vice President used his veto on defence because it happily prevented the implementation of the army consisting of sixty per cent Greek Cypriots and forty per cent Turkish Cypriots.\" \"The Vice President did not use his veto powers on the issue of foreign policy, despite the divergence of opinion in the Council of Ministers between Greek and Turkish members on the policy to be followed.\" Furthermore, \"there was no difficulty in promulgating the decisions of the Council of Ministers and the laws of the House of Representatives.\" In his memoirs, President Clerides publishes part of the \"Akritas Plan\" which aimed to achieve Greek Cypriot domination through military attacks on the Turkish Cypriots: \"We the Greek Cypriots were deciding our policy and drawing up a plan by virtue of which, stage by stage, by unilateral actions we would abolish the excessive rights granted to the Turkish minority, beginning with those amendments that were easier to make unilaterally and leaving the most difficult ones after our right to unilateral amendments was established by a de facto process.\" In Volume I, pages 212-219 Clerides explains that \"The Plan proceeded on the assumption that if we moved stage by stage, without revealing the subsequent stages before the previous one was completed, it would be difficult for Turkey to intervene militarily, provided that we did not attack the Turkish community. Another conclusion of the Plan was that once we had convinced international opinion that our constitution was unworkable, and if we proceeded on that basis, we would have international support even for unilateral amendments. Finally, it provided that Enosis - Union with Greece - should neither appear to be nor be declared to be our goal. Internationally, we should, at the appropriate time after the fetters of the Treaties of Guarantee and Alliance were abolished, present our case as a demand for the exercise of self-determination. Such a course would gain us international support and would make it difficult for Turkey to take military action.\" Clerides continues: \"If the Turkish community resorted to force to prevent unilateral amendments, the security forces would, in the first instance, have the task of maintaining law and order. If they proved inadequate for the task, then the paramilitary organization recruited by the Minister of Interior, Yorgadjis (Akritas), would be called upon to assist them, using such force as was absolutely necessary to put down the Turkish uprising..\" If the Turkish Cypriots resist \"unilateral amendments of the Constitution\" where their rights would be abrogated, the forces of the Minister of Interior will use force to \"put down the uprising\". \"There is no doubt that, finally, in September 1963, the Greek Cypriot leadership was steering the ship of the Republic, with Makarios at the helm, on a collision course..\" Clerides quotes further excerpts from the Akritas Plan as follows: Should clashes occur, they will be dealt with in the initial stages legally, by the legally established legal forces, in accordance with a plan. All actions will be clothed in legal form. Effective use of force in dealing with the Turks will facilitate to a great extent our subsequent actions for further amendments. It would then be possible for unilateral amendments to be made, without any Turkish reaction, because they will know that their reaction will be weak or seriously harmful for their community. In the event of clashes becoming more general we must be ready to proceed with actions described in (a) to (b) including the immediate declaration of Enosis because then there would be no reason to wait for room for diplomatic action.\" Lt. General George Karayiannis (the mainland Greek Army Officer then in command of the Cyprus Army) told Ethnikos Kiryx, an Athens Daily, on 13th June 1965 that \"President Makarios decided to proceed with the following: ( a) to organise the Greek Cypriots for battle and arm them, (b) to proceed with the revision of the Constitution, including the cancellation of the Vice-President's Veto.\"\n\nIn Volume 1 page 223 Clerides admits \"it is true that the Greek Cypriots attempted to bring under our control the northern suburbs of Nicosia, which were predominantly inhabited by Turkish Cypriots. It is also true that acts of disregard for human life and brutality were committed by some Greek Cypriots\"\n\nAt Christmas 1963 the Greek Cypriot militia attacked Turkish Cypriot communities across the island. Hundreds of their men, women, and children were killed and injured, and 107 of their mosques, shrines and other places of worship were desecrated. A secret despatch number 1014 from the British High Commissioner in Nicosia to London sent on 21st December 1963 says: \"Situation in Nicosia took further turn for the worse at about 10.30 am today with shooting by police of two Turkish Lycee youths standing with friends in front of the school. [The Turkish Cypriot leader] Küçük has appealed to his community to keep calm and has arranged to call on Makarios to request Commission of Enquiry. Müftüzade (Küçük's Under-Secretary) has meanwhile called on me on Küçük's instructions to represent the seriousness of the situation. He said that all Greek police are now armed while the Turkish police are not. The Greek police are patrolling Nicosia displaying their arms (sten guns) in a most threatening way and seem bent on provoking the Turks.\" Thereafter Turkish Cypriot MP's, judges, and other officials were intimidated or prevented by force from carrying out their duties. On 2nd January 1964 the Daily Telegraph wrote \"The Greek Cypriot community should not assume that the British military presence can or should secure them against Turkish intervention if they persecute the Turkish Cypriots. We must not be a shelter for double?crossers.\" \"No one who lived as I did in Cyprus in the 1960's will forget what was happening then. To my mind it was an attempt at the systematic elimination of one part of the community. It was ethnic cleansing before that phrase came into vogue in the Western media.\" Air Chief Marshal Sir Michael Graydon, Seminar in London 16th February 2001. The UK House of Commons Select Committee on Foreign Affairs reviewed the Cyprus question in 1987 (H.C. no. 23 of 1986-87), and reported unanimously on 2nd July that, \"Although the Cyprus Government now claims to have been merely seeking to \"operate the 1960 Constitution modified to the extent dictated by the necessities of the situation\" this claim ignores the fact that both before and after the events of December 1963 the Makarios Government continued to advocate the cause of ENOSIS and actively pursued the amendment of the Constitution and the related treaties to facilitate this ultimate objective\". The Committee continued : \"Moreover in June 1967 the Greek Cypriot legislature unanimously passed a resolution in favour of ENOSIS, in blatant contravention of the 1960 Treaties and Constitution.\" (Art. 1 of the Treaty of Guarantee declares prohibited any action likely to promote directly or indirectly union with any other state or partition of the island, and Art. 185(2) of the Constitution is to similar effect). And at para. 28 \"The effect of the crisis of December 1963 was to deliver control of the formal organs of Government into the hands of the Greek Cypriots alone. Claiming to be acting in accordance with \"the doctrine of necessity\" the Greek Cypriot members of the House of Representatives enacted a series of laws which provided for the operation of the various organs of government without Turkish Cypriot participation.\" Insofar as the Constitution became unworkable, it was because the Greek Cypriot leadership refused to respect the obligations to which they had agreed. The doctrine of necessity in international law applies to supervening impossibility due to extraneous and unforeseen causes. It does not apply to self-induced causes. There is in particular no doctrine of necessity known to international law which could justify the slaughter of innocent men, women, and children. Even Greece was embarrassed by this behaviour. On 19th April 1963 Foreign Minister Averoff wrote to Makarios \"It is not permissible for Greece in any circumstances to accept the creation of a precedent by which one of the contracting parties can unilaterally abrogate or ignore provisions that are irksome to it in international acts which this same party has undertaken to respect.\" The 1960 Constitution had, by Article 182, expressly provided that its basic Articles could not be amended, whether by way of variation, addition, or repeal. Any such change to the Constitution would require agreement with the Turkish Cypriots and the Guarantor powers, but this was never done. The UK Commons Committee continued at para, 29 \"Equally damaging from the Turkish Cypriot point of view was what they considered to be their effective exclusion from representation at, and participation in, the international fora where their case could have been deployed.............\" \"An official Turkish Cypriot presence in the international political scene virtually disappeared overnight.\" It is not therefore surprising that the world has been persuaded to the Greek Cypriot point of view. In 1963 the British knew full well that Makarios was acting illegally and they also knew that Britain had itself signed a treaty of guarantee, which at the very least obliged them to give the Turkish Cypriots effective protection against attempted genocide (see 1974 below) But, having recently disengaged from a messy war with EOKA, it did not suit Britain to get involved in Cyprus again - and there was of course the question of the British bases. The Treaty of Guarantee was an inconvenient piece of paper which could be ignored without any serious adverse consequences. British forces in Cyprus at the time did what they could, but their government did not have the will to take a determined stand against the aggressors, and they had therefore to act as intermediaries and carriers of humanitarian relief. Grand strategists will always use the rule of law when it supports and advances their interests, but they will never let it stand in their way when it does not. Throughout the 1960-63 period of his Presidency, and before, Makarios had been assiduously courting the \"Non-aligned Movement\" of which the Burmese UN Secretary-General, U Thant, was an enthusiastic supporter. Makarios had also been courting the Soviet Union and its satellites. When therefore the Cyprus question came before the Security Council in February 1964 he was in a strong position. The fatal step taken by the Security Council was to accept the credentials of the representatives of Makarios after December 1963, despite the protest made to the Council by Vice-President Küçük's telegram of 27th December 1963 that there was no longer a lawful government of Cyprus. This was not simply an internal matter for Cyprus, because the 1960 Constitution was guaranteed by international Treaty, to which a permanent member of the Security Council (Britain) was a signatory. What the UN should have done was to leave the \"Cyprus\" seat vacant until such time as constitutional order was restored and allow the representatives of both peoples of Cyprus equal status at the United Nations: Using his priceless but illegitimate advantage Makarios lobbied hard behind the scenes to secure Resolution 186 on 4th March 1964, by which the United Nations not only failed to condemn the usurpation of the legal order in Cyprus by force, but by using the words \"Government of Cyprus\" without defining what they mean, laid the foundation for the world to deal with the Greek Cypriot administration as if it were the lawful Government of Cyprus. As former Greek Foreign Minister, Bitsios, observed in \"The Vulnerable Republic\" 1975: \"In the United Nations issues are not won through speeches in the Council Room, but in hard battling behind the scenes. It is there that the texts of resolutions are bargained, pressures are exerted, and the raw language of vested interests is heard.\" The Turkish Cypriots were excluded from this process, and by the time Rauf Denkta was allowed to address the Council on 28th February the issue had already been decided against him. The Security Council moreover insulted the Turkish Cypriot people by insisting that their leader address the Council as a private individual under Rule 39 of the Rules of Procedure, whilst hearing the Greek Cypriot as the official representative of a Member-State. The Resolution could not have passed if Britain or the United States had voted against it, but their representatives at the UN tacitly condoned these abuses, and were instructed to vote for the Resolution. The Turkish Government was willing to accept it because the term \"Cyprus Government\" in the resolution could, in their view, only mean a government which, according to the [1960] Cyprus Constitution, acts with the concurrence of both its Turkish Cypriot and Greek Cypriot members. As noted above the British government agreed with this definition (FO telegram 1131 of 12th March 1964). However, this was soon forgotten, and the British Government and all others except Turkey accepted the Greek Cypriot administration as if it alone were the Government of Cyprus. This acceptance reflects no credit upon the United Nations, nor upon Britain and the other countries who have acquiesced in it. Having got away with this, the Greek Cypriot leaders were emboldened to believe that at the United Nations they could get away, literally, with murder. If the use of force by Greek Cypriots to dispossess the Turkish Cypriots and establish themselves as \"the Government of Cyprus\" is acceptable to the UN what right does anyone have to complain about the use of force later by Turkey? See for example the Secretary-General's report of 22nd November 1993 (S/26777, para. 101(c)) \"The status quo, which the Security Council has deemed unacceptable, was established through the use of force and is sustained by military strength.\" Sir Anthony Kershaw MC, MP, Chairman of the UK House of Commons Select Committee on Foreign Affairs until 1987 explained in a speech in Cyprus on 23rd October 1990 how the UN came to accept the Greek Cypriots as the Cyprus Government as follows: \"It was decided that UN troops should be sent to preserve order, but the UN can only send troops if the legal government of the country concerned asks for them. The only organisation which could in 1964 be called the Government of Cyprus was the administration headed by Makarios. The Turkish Cypriots pointed out that this was not the legal government of Cyprus but such was the pressure of the times that the UN said: Look your people are dying ? let's get the troops out right away and the lawyers can sort it out later. So it was decided, but since that time the UN has treated the Greek Cypriots as the only government of Cyprus, basing this upon a treaty and a constitution which had been repudiated and broken by the Greek Cypriot government itself. I do not deny that the Greek Cypriot government is the de facto government of the South of Cyprus. It has all the attributes of sovereignty, but so has the government of Northern Cyprus.\" In the opinion of Mr. Monroe Leigh, the distinguished American international lawyer \"The mere fact of international recognition, no matter how widespread, cannot excuse or confer legitimacy upon the violations of both constitutional law and international treaty law through which the Greek Cypriot regime usurped the name as well as the government of the Republic of Cyprus.\" (Written opinion 20.7.1990). There has been no concurrence between Turkish Cypriot and Greek Cypriot members since 1963, and the Greek Cypriots have no legal or moral right to their governmental status. British thinking at the time can be gathered from secret documents released by the Public Record Office in 1994 under the 30 year rule. On 12th August 1964 the UK Representative to the UN, sent a telegram to his government in which he said: \"What is our policy and true feelings about the future of Cyprus and about Makarios? Judging from the English newspapers and many others, the feeling is very strong indeed against Makarios and his so-called government and nothing would please the British people more than to see him toppled and the Cyprus problem solved by direct dealings between the Turks and the Greeks. We are of course supporting the latter course, but I have never seen any expression of the official disapproval in public against Makarios and his evil doings. Is there an official view about this, and what do we think we should do in the long run?\n\nSometimes it seems that the obsession of some people with \"the Commonwealth\" blinds us to everything else and it would be high treason to take a more active line against Makarios and his henchmen. At other times the dominant feature seems to be concern lest active opposition against Makarios should lead to direct conflict with the [Greek] Cypriots and end up with our losing our bases. I ask these questions, partly for background and partly because it really would be useful to know how far you feel we are inhibited from taking up a more actively hostile attitude to the Greek Cypriots. Their representative here is, as you know, a horror. Even the communists are thoroughly fed up with him, and it is therefore not necessary for us to do anything more to weaken his position. But it is curious and sometimes very frustrating to sit in the Security Council and walk around the UN and have to listen to all the stuff about the wickedness of the Turks and their threats of invasion, when I and all my staff know very well what the real state of affairs is and how much Makarios and Co. are to blame.\n\nOne can say what one thinks of course to a few people, but one cannot produce the evidence or argue the case fully with the vast majority of my UN colleagues so long as the official public attitude seems to be not to say anything rude about Makarios and his gang.\n\nThese, I realise, are not entirely easy questions and I suspect that the answers may well depend on differences of view and attitude at your end, revolving round such questions as the Commonwealth and the truth about our defence needs. Shortly after the Security Council debate concluded in March 1964 the Greek Cypriot leadership, stung by the speech of Denkta at the UN which revealed the true nature of the Greek Cypriots and their policies, pushed a vindictive resolution through their House of Representatives which prohibited his return to the island. This proved to be a mistake, for the period from then until 13th April 1968 which Denkta spent in Turkey gave him an unprecedented opportunity to acquaint himself with the machinery of Turkish government and to alert the Turkish Government and people to what was really happening in Cyprus. By para. 2 of Resolution 186 the Security Council \"Asks the Government of Cyprus, which has the responsibility for the maintenance and restoration of law and order, to take all additional measures necessary to stop violence and bloodshed in Cyprus.\" It was of course the Greek Cypriot \"Government\" which had caused the violence and bloodshed in Cyprus, and continued to do so until July 1974 despite para. 3 of the Resolution which \"Calls upon the communities in Cyprus and their leaders to act with the utmost restraint\" On one occasion an attack on the Turkish Cypriots, at St. Hilarion castle, was led by the Greek Cypriot \"Minister of the Interior\" himself, in blatant defiance of the UN. By para. 4 of the Resolution the Security Council \" Recommends the creation, with the consent of the Government of Cyprus, of a United Nations Peace-Keeping Force in Cyprus\" which became known as UNFICYP and is still there. However, without powers of search and arrest, and with insufficient strength to confront the Greek Cypriot forces, they were unable from 1964 to 1974 to prevent the Greek Cypriots doing as they pleased. Today its role is extremely limited, as the peace is actually kept by the Turkish Army. There is no doubt that if the Turkish Army left, UNFICYP would again be pushed aside by Greek Cypriot forces. There has never been any consensus between the Turkish Cypriots and the Greek Cypriots as to why UNFICYP is in Cyprus at all. The Turkish Cypriots consider them there to prevent any further abuses of their human rights by the Greek Cypriots. On the other hand the Greek Cypriots think they are there in support of their \"Government\" and to protect them against any Turkish military response which they might provoke. At a Press Conference on 14th April 1999 the UNFICYP Chief of Mission, Dame Ann Hercus, said: \"We are here by consent. The day consent is withdrawn or collapses is the day UN Peacekeepers pack up their bags and go home. Consent and cooperation of the parties to a conflict are essential for peacekeepers to perform their role.\" It is to be noted that the required consent is the consent of the parties, not the consent of one of them, namely \"the Government of Cyprus.\" The Turkish Cypriots have cooperated with UNFICYP for many years, but they are now entitled to expect formal acknowledgment from the UN that their consent, as well as that of the Greek Cypriots is required. Dame Ann continued: \"In the end a peace settlement has to be signed by the parties themselves. This cannot be imposed by others.\" back to contents\n\nIV MASSACRES OF TURKISH CYPRIOT CIVILIANS\n\nThe civilian massacres of 1963/64, 1967, and 1974 are of such importance to an understanding of the Turkish Cypriot negotiating position to this day that no apology is made for quoting from the contemporaneous reports The story is told in detail in \"The Genocide Files\" by the British journalist, Harry Scott-Gibbons, ISBN number 0-9514464-2-8. In the 1963/64 massacres alone, more than 800 Turkish Cypriot men, women and children were wounded and murdered.\n\nThe distinguished philosopher, Michael Moran, made the following diagnosis of Greek Cypriot attitudes (Sovereignty Divided 1998): \"It was because the Greek Cypriots were under a kind of ideological spell, a collective mental condition similar to what Marxists used to call \"false-consciousness\" that the Greek Cypriots could embark upon their particular course of action in December 1963 with all the zeal and confidence they did. Brainwashed through at least a hundred years of purblind school-teaching and sermonising into a set of beliefs pathologically at odds with any plausible account of historical and political realities; lacking contact with a counterbalancing tradition of rational criticism; for the most part incapable of ironic scepticism towards theological obfuscation - the Greek Cypriot leaders were effectively de-sensitised to the equally important rights of the Turkish Cypriots. In this way they were able to treat their Turkish compatriots with such consistent and irrational abuse, hardly noticing that this was in fact what they were doing.\" \"When the Turkish Cypriots objected to the amendment of the constitution Makarios put his plan into effect, and the Greek Cypriot attack began in December 1963\" (Lt. Gen. George Karayiannis of the Greek Cypriot militia \"Ethnikos Kiryx\" 15.6.65). The General is referring to the notorious \"Akritas\" plan, which was the blueprint for the extermination of the Turkish Cypriots and the annexation of the island to Greece. This plan was prepared in 1960 before the new constitution had been given any chance to work, and was published in Patris in 24th April 1966. \"The Akritas Plan destroyed the only compromise ever reached between Greece and Turkey and between Greek and Turkish Cypriots about Cyprus. It revived bloodshed and hatred. It thrust Cyprus and its peoples back into the extremes of ENOSIS and partition. It was bound sooner or later to bring some kind of intervention from Turkey. This rash, wicked, conspiracy was an act of supreme folly by the Greek Cypriot leaders, who still refuse to admit their wrongdoing. They continue to accuse others of bringing undeserved disasters upon them, but the truth is that it was they who broke up the bi-communal state and separated the Greeks and Turks from one another.\" Rauf Denkta 4.7.89. On 12th January 1964 the British High Commission in Nicosia wrote to London (telegram no. 162) \"The Greek (Cypriot) police are led by extremists who provoked the fighting and deliberately engaged in atrocities. They have recruited into their ranks as \"special constables\" gun-happy young thugs. ....... Makarios assured Sir Arthur Clark that there will be no attack. His assurance is as worthless as previous assurances have proved.\" On 28th December 1963 the Daily Express carried the following report from Cyprus: \"We went tonight into the sealed?off Turkish Cypriot Quarter of Nicosia in which 200 to 300 people had been slaughtered in the last five days. We were the first Western reporters there and we have seen sights too frightful to be described in print. Horror so extreme that the people seemed stunned beyond tears.\" On 1st January 1964 the Daily Herald reported: \"When I came across the Turkish homes they were an appalling sight. Apart from the walls they just did not exist. I doubt if a napalm attack could have created more devastation. Under roofs which had caved in I found a twisted mass of bed springs, children's cots, and grey ashes of what had once been tables, chairs and wardrobes. In the neighbouring village of Ayios Vassilios I counted 16 wrecked and burned out homes. They were all Turkish Cypriot. In neither village did I find a scrap of damage to any Greek Cypriot house.\" On 14th January 1964 the Daily Telegraph reported that the Turkish Cypriot inhabitants of Ayios Vassilios had been massacred on 26th December 1963, and reported their exhumation from a mass grave in the presence of the Red Cross. A further massacre of Turkish Cypriots, at Limassol, was reported by The Observer on 16th February 1964, and there were many more. On 17th February 1964 the Washington Post reported that Greek Cypriot fanatics appear bent on a policy of genocide.\" On 31st December 1963 \"The Guardian\" had reported: \"It is nonsense to claim, as the Greek Cypriots do, that all casualties were caused by fighting between armed men of both sides. On Christmas Eve many Turkish Cypriot people were brutally attacked and murdered in their suburban homes, including the wife and children of the Turkish Cypriot head of army medical services ? allegedly by a group of forty men, many in army boots and greatcoats.\" Although the Turkish Cypriots fought back as best they could, there were no massacres of Greek Cypriot civilians. On 10th September 1964 the Secretary?General reported (UN doc. S/5950): \"UNFICYP carried out a detailed survey of all damage to properties throughout the island during the disturbances, ......... it shows that in 109 villages, most of them Turkish?Cypriot or mixed villages, 527 houses have been destroyed while 2,000 others have suffered damage from looting. In Ktima 38 houses and shops have been destroyed totally and 122 partially. In the Omorphita suburb of Nicosia, 50 houses have been totally destroyed while a further 240 have been partially destroyed there and in adjacent suburbs.\" British troops in Cyprus at the time did what they could to protect the Turkish Cypriots, and their efforts are remembered to this day, but the scale and ferocity of the Greek Cypriot attacks made their task impossible. On 6th February 1964 a British patrol found armed Greek Cypriot police attacking the Turkish Cypriots of Ayios Sozomenos. They were unable to stop the attack. On 13th February 1964 the Greeks and Greek Cypriots attacked the Turkish Cypriot quarter of Limassol with tanks, killing 16 and injuring 35. On 15th February 1964 \"The Daily Telegraph\" reported: \"It is a real military operation which the Greek Cypriots launched against the six thousand inhabitants of the Turkish Cypriot Quarter yesterday morning. A spokesman for the Greek Cypriot Government has recognised this officially. It is hard to conceive how Greek and Turkish Cypriots may seriously contemplate working together after all that has happened.\" In June 1964 the position of the Turkish Cypriots became so serious that public opinion in Turkey felt that they could no longer stand by. They therefore warned that they would intervene under Article 4 of the Treaty of Guarantee. They did not intervene because they were threatened by US President Johnson that if Turkey were invaded by the Soviets America would not comply with its NATO obligation to defend them. This was an arrogant, illegal, and empty threat, for there is no possibility that America's own strategic interests could permit a Soviet takeover of Turkey and the Dardanelles. The threat was nevertheless enough to postpone Turkish intervention for another ten years. Professor Ernst Forsthoff, the neutral President of the Supreme Constitutional Court of Cyprus told Die Welt on 27th December 1963 \"Makarios bears on his shoulders the sole responsibility of the recent tragic events. His aim is to deprive the Turkish community of their rights.\" In an interview with UPI press agency on 30th December 1963 he said: \"All this happened because Makarios wanted to remove all constitutional rights from the Turkish Cypriots.\" More than 300 Turkish Cypriots are still missing without trace from these massacres of 1963/64. These dreadful events were not the responsibility of \"the Greek Colonels\" of 1974, or an unrepresentative handful of Greek Cypriot extremists. The persecution of the Turkish Cypriots was an act of policy on the part of the Greek Cypriot political and religious leadership, which has to this day made no serious attempt to bring the murderers to justice. The UK Commons Select Committee found that, \"There is little doubt that much of the violence which the Turkish Cypriots claim led to the total or partial destruction of 103 Turkish villages and the displacement of about a quarter of the total Turkish Cypriot population, was either directly inspired by, or certainly connived at, by the Greek Cypriot leadership\". The Greek Cypriots sometimes allege that it was they who were attacked, by the Turkish Cypriots who were determined to wreck the 1960 agreements. However, the Turkish Cypriots were not only outnumbered by nearly four to one; they were also surrounded in their villages by armed Greek Cypriots, they had no way of protecting their women and children, and Turkey was 40 miles away across the sea. The very idea that in those circumstances the Turkish Cypriots were the aggressors, is absurd. In his memoirs, the American Under?Secretary of State, George Ball, said \"Makarios' central interest was to block off Turkish intervention so that he and his Greek Cypriots could go on happily massacring Turkish Cypriots. Obviously we would never permit that.\" The fact is however that neither the US, the UK, the UN, nor anyone, other than Turkey eleven years later, took effective action to prevent it. The British Government recorded (doc. 1057 of 15.2.64) that George Ball \"thought that Makarios' aim was to get the Cyprus problem into the UN orbit where the slogan of self-determination, supported by the communist bloc and the neutralists, could exert pressure towards the establishment of an independent unitary state, where he could do what he liked with the Turkish Cypriots.\" back to contents\n\nV DIVISION OF THE ISLAND IN 1964\n\nThe Turkish Cypriots were forced to withdraw into defended enclaves, and it was therefore in January 1964, not in 1974, that Cyprus was divided. In 1964 the Turkish Cypriots had to establish an elected authority to govern themselves whilst confined in their defended enclaves. On 14th January 1964 \"Il Giorno\" of Italy reported: \"Right now we are witnessing the exodus of Turkish Cypriots from the villages. Thousands of people abandoning homes, land, herds. Greek Cypriot terrorism is relentless. This time the rhetoric of the Hellenes and the statues of Plato do not cover up their barbaric and ferocious behaviour.\" The UN Secretary?General reported to the Security Council (UN doc. S/8286): \"When the disturbances broke out in December 1963 and continued during the first part of 1964 thousands of Turkish?Cypriots fled from their homes, taking with them only what they could drive or carry, and sought refuge in what they considered to be safer Turkish Cypriot villages and areas.\" Greek Cypriots often claim that the Turkish Cypriots withdrew voluntarily from their positions in the State. They were in fact excluded by threats to their personal safety. On 12th January 1964 the British High Commission in Nicosia wrote to London (telegram no. 162) \"The Greek (Cypriot) police..... threaten to try and punish any Turkish Cypriot police who wish to return to the Cyprus Government. Further, the UK Commons Select Committee found that \"When in July 1965 the Turkish Cypriot members of the House of Representatives had sought to resume their seats they were told that they could do so only if they accepted the legislative changes to the operation of the Constitution enacted in their absence\" (ie. if they agreed to fundamental constitutional changes to the great disadvantage of their community, imposed upon them by force of arms).\n\nGreek Cypriot policy after 1963 was summarised as follows in Fileleftheros on 20th September 1992: \"we the Greek Cypriots are in full control of the Government. All the Ministers are Greeks. Our government is the only one recognised internationally - why should we bring the Turks back in? The Turks today control only 3% of the land. They have no rich resources and they are living through difficult times from an economic point of view. They will ultimately have to accept our point of view - or go.\" Accordingly, even if there had been any substance to Greek Cypriot claims that they were operating the government alone of necessity because the Turkish Cypriots were leaving their places vacant, there can be no justification for that claim after July 1965. The Select Committee continued: \"In February 1966 Makarios declared that the 1960 Agreements had been abrogated and buried.\"\n\nIn September 1964 the Secretary?General had reported to the Security Council (UN doc. 5950): \"In addition to losses incurred in agriculture and in industry during the first part of the year, the Turkish Cypriot community had lost other sources of its income including the salaries of over 4,000 persons who were employed by the Cyprus Government.\" The trade of the Turkish Cypriot community had considerably declined during the period, and unemployment reached a very high level of approximately 25,000 breadwinners. Turkish?Cypriots had become refugees in their own land. Expenditure of the Turkish Communal Chamber collapsed, as a yearly subsidy formerly received from the Government had ceased in 1964. A large part of its remaining resources had to be used for unemployment relief and other forms of compensation as approximately half the entire Turkish Cypriot population came to be on relief. During the period 1963 to 1974 the freedom of movement of Turkish?Cypriots was severely restricted (Un docs. S/5764, S/5950, S/7350); they were denied postal services (UN docs. S/5950. S/7001); Their access to building materials, electrical equipment, motor parts, fuel, chemicals and many other commodities was severely restricted (UN docs. S/5950, S/7350); and Turkish?Cypriot refugees had to live in tents and caves. On 10th September 1964 the UN Secretary?General reported \"The economic restrictions being imposed against the Turkish Cypriot communities, which in some instances has been so severe as to amount to veritable siege, indicated that the Government of Cyprus seeks to force a potential solution by economic pressure.\" (UN doc. S/5950). On 24th July 1965 the United Kingdom formally protested the unlawful action of the Greek Cypriots, but continued to deal with them as the Government of Cyprus, and took no effective action to stop them doing as they pleased. In his memoirs published in 1987 former British Foreign Secretary and Prime Minister, James Callaghan, records that, \"there is no question that the Turkish Cypriots had for many years been denied their political rights under the 1960 Constitution, and their basic human rights\". The United Nations, the Commonwealth, and the rest of the world have put political expediency before principle, and failed to condemn this appalling behaviour. Greek Cypriots are guilty of attempted genocide in violation of Articles 2(a), (b) and (c) and Articles 3(a), (b), (c), (d) and (e) of the 1948 Genocide Convention, but no action has ever been taken against them. Instead they have been rewarded by being treated as the Government of all Cyprus. The Turkish Cypriots by contrast were frozen out of the UN, the Commonwealth and almost every other international organisation, and were not even allowed to be heard when many important decisions affecting their future were made. This act of betrayal by the United Nations itself has enabled the Greek Cypriots for more than thirty years to treat the Turkish Cypriots as a mere community, to take most of the international aid for themselves, to embargo Turkish Cypriot trade and communications with the outside world, to occupy the Cyprus chair in all international institutions, and to convince the world that they, and not the Turkish Cypriots are the injured party. In 1965 the UN General Assembly actually went so far, in Resolution 2077, as to express its confidence in the goodwill and humanity of the Greek Cypriot regime, which had been shown on the clearest possible evidence to have dishonoured international agreements, subverted constitutional government, and violated human rights on a massive scale. Still not confident that they could eliminate the Turkish Cypriots without help from Greece, the Greek Cypriots began to augment their forces soon after the events of 1963. In his book \"Democracy at Gunpoint\" Andreas Papandreou recalls that in 1964 \"A clandestine operation began on a huge scale; of nightly shipments of arms and \"volunteers\" who arrive in Cyprus in civilian clothes and then join their Greek Cypriot units.\" \"Newsweek\" had likewise reported on 27th July 1964 that: \"Before dawn each day the great iron doors of the port of Limassol are slammed shut... UN troops are barred. A few hours later the doors swing open and covered lorries, weaving on overloaded springs, roar out of the port and head toward the Troodos mountains.\" On 28th July 1965 (Hansard col. 466) the former British Minister, Duncan Sandys said in the House of Commons: \"the flagrantly illegal action of the Cyprus government gives to Turkey an unquestionable right under the Treaty of Guarantee to intervene in order to restore the Constitution.\" Despite the withdrawal of Turkish Cypriots into defended enclaves, they were subjected to a further massacre of civilians in 1967 when, on 27th March the Greeks and Greek Cypriots shelled the village of Mari for four hours. On 15th November 1967 2,000 armed men with artillery and armoured forces attacked the Turkish Cypriot quarter of Ayios Theodoros. At the same time the village of Getcikale (Kophinou) was attacked. During these attacks UN soldiers watched helpless as women children, and old men were killed - many burned alive in their own homes - and 50 houses were destroyed. Only warning flights by the Turkish Air Force prevented further massacres at this time, and forced the withdrawal of some of the mainland Greek forces which had been illegally built up in Cyprus. And what was the reaction of the international community? They did not launch air attacks against the Greek Cypriots, as they later did against the Serbs - they did not complain about ethnic cleansing, or \"attempts to change the demographic character of Cyprus.\" They expressed no concern for Turkish Cypriot missing persons, nor for the homes, farms and businesses they had lost, - and they did not complain about the 20,000 Greek troops on the island. Instead they rewarded the Greek Cypriots by treating them as the Government of all Cyprus. On 23rd December 1965 the British Government stated their Cyprus objectives in a confidential Memo from the Foreign Office to the British High Commissioner in Cyprus (FO371/179984) as follows: The basic objectives of our policy over Cyprus have been stated to be: (a) To prevent a war between Greece and Turkey and to maintain the cohesion of the south-east flank of NATO (b) To secure through negotiation a stable and lasting solution acceptable to all concerned, including both Greece and Turkey (c) To prevent Cyprus falling under neutralist or Soviet influence or control (d) To retain our staging and defence facilities in Cyprus for as long as they are required, and (e) To retain our ability to use the northern route, overflying Turkey .... These objectives are not concerned so much with the situation in Cyprus itself, as with its implications for our general foreign policy. It is because of this that we cannot pursue or advocate any \"solution\" which, however attractive itself, would be seriously damaging to, or not accepted by, any of the \"other parties concerned.\" So far, we had no real alternative to maintaining a position of strict neutrality between opposing points of view. We have also to bear in mind that the existing uneasy balance in Cyprus has suited our basic objectives better than any alternative within our reach .... However much we may still dislike it, the fact is that the Cyprus Treaties do still remain in force and can only be altered with the agreement of all parties concerned. However hard we may strive for a UN solution, until one is in sight (and none is at present), we must maintain the formal status quo so far as the Treaties are concerned, for without that we merely invite anarchy. We never believed that the UN as a whole (ie especially the General Assembly) offers the best hope of finding the solution; it is in our view far too subject to extraneous and irrelevant pressures and cold war influences to be likely to throw up of its own accord a solution; though it may provide useful endorsement for one which has been negotiated, and can certainly help (eg through UNFICYP) to provide an atmosphere in which negotiation can be fruitful. Proceedings just concluded in the General Assembly seem fully to justify these apprehensions. The Resolution passed on 19th December [in fact Resolution 2077 of 18 December 1965] makes no contribution towards bringing the parties closer together or to reducing tensions. On the contrary, by supporting the Greek Cypriot point of view, and correspondingly frustrating the Turks, it seems likely to have set the various parties to the dispute even further apart than before, thus once again contributing not to a solution, but only creating disturbance. It will no doubt be exploited to the full by Makarios .... Predictably it has provoked anger in Ankara, accompanied by renewed threats of unilateral intervention. It is most unlikely that, whatever efforts we or anyone else make, to find a solution through the UN, the Turks will in the foreseeable future have any confidence in them. We should give no impression that the UN can find a solution to the problem. Our policy up to now has been based on a fairly cold-blooded appraisal of where our interests lie, and how best to advance them. Maybe the situation has slightly changed, and we may need a reappraisal of policy.\" Despite all that had happened the Turkish Cypriots were still willing to compromise, and Glafcos Clerides in his memoirs points out that there had been many occasions when he reached agreement with the Turkish Cypriot leader, Rauf Denkta but the Greek Cypriot side always refused to accept it. On page 377 of Volume 3 he says : \"In 1972 we could have had a solution of our problem based on a much improved constitution than the Zurich one, and on a unitary state. We rejected it because it did not give us the maximum of our aims, i.e. a Greek Cypriot island ruled by the Greek Cypriots ......\"In 1972 the Greek Cypriot attitude to the solution of our problem was clearly expressed in the statement made by the then Foreign Minister, Kyprianou, who stated: `I wish again to call on the Greek Cypriot people to be calmly on alert in order to prevent a nationally unacceptable solution. By this I mean either concealed or unconcealed federation or condominium, double Enosis, or partition or a return to the Zurich Agreements.\"\n\nback to contents\n\nVI THE EVENTS OF 1974 In 1971 General Grivas returned to Cyprus to form EOKA?B, committed to making Cyprus a wholly Greek island and annexing it to Greece. In a speech to the Greek Cypriot armed forces (Quoted in \"New Cyprus\" May 1987) Grivas said. \"The Greek forces from Greece have come to Cyprus in order to impose the will of the Greeks of Cyprus upon the Turks. We want ENOSIS but the Turks are against it. We shall impose our will. We are strong and we shall do so.\" Greek Invasion By 15th July 1974 a powerful force of mainland Greek troops had assembled in Cyprus and with their backing the Greek Cypriot National Guard overthrew Makarios and installed one Nicos Sampson as \"President.\" They immediately began to murder Greek Cypriots and some Turkish Cypriots. On 22nd July Washington Star News reported: \"Bodies littered the streets and there were mass burials.... People who were told by Makarios to lay down their guns were shot by the National Guard.\" Even Greek Cypriots sought Turkey's help. In her memoirs, Greek Cypriot MP Rina Katsellis, says \"16th July 1974 Is Makarios alive? Is he dead? The Makarios supporters arrested, the EOKA-B supporters freed .... I did not shed a tear, why should I? Did the stupidity and fanaticism deserve a tear? There are some who beg Turkey to intervene. 18th July 1974 \"My God!...Everyone is frozen with fear.. the old man who asked for the body of his son was shot on the spot.. The tortures and executions at the central prison ... everyone is frozen with horror. Nothing is sacred to these people, and they call themselves Greeks! ... we must not keep that name any longer.\" Turkey Responds In his book \"The Way the Wind Blows\" former British Prime Minister, Sir Alec Douglas?Home said \"I was convinced that if Archbishop Makarios could not bring himself to treat the Turkish Cypriots as human beings he was inviting the invasion and partition of the island.\" \"Turkish Cypriots, who had suffered from physical attacks since 1963, called on the guarantor powers to prevent a Greek conquest of the island. When Britain did nothing Turkey invaded Cyprus and occupied its northern part.\" (Daily Telegraph 15.8.96.) The Greek newspaper Eleftherotipia published an interview with Nicos Sampson on 26th February 1981 in which he said \"Had Turkey not intervened I would not only have proclaimed ENOSIS - I would have annihilated the Turks in Cyprus.\" He would have done so in accordance with the second ethnic cleansing plan \"The Iphestos Plan\" and the idea that the Turkish Cypriots were not endangered by the 1974 coup is nonsense. \"Greek Cypriot National Guard documents captured in [July 1974] reveal a hair-raising plan to wipe out the entire Turkish population of the island. I have before me as I write copies of some of these captured documents…… Every detail of the extermination plans are revealed - the villages to be wiped out with their inhabitants - the units assigned to specific areas, and even where to bury the Turkish corpses - it is all there. Perhaps the most frightening thing of all is the revelation that the Greek Cypriot population was to be organised and brainwashed into joining the slaughter.\" Scott-Gibbons \"The Genocide Files\" p 407.\n\nTurkey (at that time ruled by the Social Democrats) sent troops to Cyprus on 20th July 1974. The 1976 UK House of Commons Select Committee on Cyprus found (HC 331 1975/76 para. 22), that Turkey had proposed joint Anglo?Turkish action under the Treaty of Guarantee, and this was confirmed by Prime Minister Ecevit on 14th August 1974 (Daily Telegraph 15th August). However the Labour Government in Britain refused to take any effective action, even though they had troops and aircraft in the Sovereign Bases in Cyprus. They argued that Britain was under no duty to take military action, but Article II of the Treaty provided that Britain would guarantee the state of affairs established by the basic articles of the 1960 Constitution, which it manifestly failed to do. The Select Committee concluded that \"Britain had a legal right to intervene, she had a moral obligation to intervene. She did not intervene for reason Þ abour) Government refuses to give.\" \"On 20th July 1974 Turkey intervened under Article IV of the Treaty of Guarantee\" ? (UK Foreign & Commonwealth Office doc. CPS/75, Jan., 1987). \"Turkey exercised its right of intervention in accordance with Article IV of the Guarantee Treaty of 1960.\" (Resolution 573, Standing Committee of the Consultative Assembly of the Council of Europe, 29th July 1974). In July 1974, after the first phase of the Turkish intervention, an international conference was held at Geneva between Turkey, Greece and Britain. It was agreed that Greek and Greek Cypriot forces would leave all the Turkish Cypriot enclaves, but they proceeded instead to murder almost the entire civilian population of six Turkish Cypriot enclaves in both the north and south of the island, and despite the presence in Cyprus of UN troops. It is argued that even if the first phase of the Turkish intervention was legal, the extension of the area under Turkish control in the second phase from 14th August to 16th August 1974 was illegal. However, the facts do not support this view. The German newspaper Die Zeit wrote on 30 August 1974 \"the massacre of Turkish Cypriots in Paphos and Famagusta is the proof of how justified the Turks were to undertake their (August) intervention\". Turkey's obligation under the Treaty of Guarantee was to re-establish the state of affairs established by the basic articles of the 1960 Constitution. That was a state of affairs in which the Turkish Cypriots could at the very least stay alive and play their part as political equals in the government of the island. Neither of these objectives could have been achieved by returning the Turkish Cypriots to the status quo ante, and Turkey could not possibly have done so. That status was not the one envisaged by the 1960 Constitution, and it was Makarios who had been responsible for the massacres of 1963, 1964, and 1967. He had also been responsible for expelling the Turkish Cypriots from all their positions in the state, and for squeezing them into less than 3% of the island with only the basic necessities for life. It should be remembered that Makarios was deposed not because he had abandoned ENOSIS, but because he was a Royalist who did not support the Junta then in power in Greece. The Greek Cypriot journalist Stavros Angelides wrote as follows in Fileleftheros on 16th September 1990 \"Did we really have constitutional order before the invasion and even before the coup? Was this the constitutional order we had signed in 1959 with Turkey, Greece, Britain, and the Turkish Cypriots? Such an argument is absolutely baseless. We, the Greek Cypriot side, started to overthrow the constitution soon after Zurich.\" Turkey could discharge its obligation only by providing a safe haven for the Turkish Cypriots in which they could live in peace and freedom, and by encouraging them to reach a new political arrangement with the Greek Cypriots in which they could play their part as political equals in the government of the island. Even if the Treaty of Guarantee had not existed Turkey would have been wholly justified in intervening to protect the Turkish Cypriots from attempted genocide and remaining there for as long as their protection was needed, on the same legal basis as NATO intervened to protect ethnic Albanians in Kosovo from attempted genocide. More Massacres of Turkish Cypriots In the village of Tokhni on 14th August 1974 all the Turkish Cypriot men between the ages of 13 and 74, except for eighteen who managed to escape, were taken away and shot. (Times, Guardian, 21st August) In Zyyi on the same day all the Turkish?Cypriot men aged between 19 and 38 were taken away by Greek?Cypriots and were never seen again. On the same day Greek?Cypriots opened fire in the Turkish?Cypriot neighbourhood of Paphos killing men, women, and children indiscriminately. On 23rd July 1974 the Washington Post reported \"In a Greek raid on a small Turkish village near Limassol 36 people out of a population of 200 were killed. The Greeks said that they had been given orders to kill the inhabitants of the Turkish villages before the Turkish forces arrived.\" (See also Times, Guardian, 23rd July). \"The Greeks began to shell the Turkish quarter on Saturday, refugees said. Kazan Dervi , a Turkish Cypriot girl aged 15, said she had been staying with her uncle. The [Greek Cypriot] National Guard came into the Turkish sector and shooting began. She saw her uncle and other relatives taken away as prisoners, and later heard her uncle had been shot.\" (Times 23.7.74) \"Before my uncle was taken away by the soldiers, he shouted to me to run away. I ran into the streets, and the soldiers were shooting all the time. I went into a house and I saw a woman being attacked by soldiers. They were raping her. Then they shot her in front of my eyes. I ran away again and Turkish men and women looked after me. They were escaping as well. They broke holes in the sides of houses, so we could get away without going into the streets. There were lots of women and children screaming, and soldiers were firing at us all the time\".\n\nOn 28th July the New York Times reported that 14 Turkish?Cypriot men had been shot in Alaminos. On 24th July 1974 \"France Soir\" reported \"The Greeks burned Turkish mosques and set fire to Turkish homes in the villages around Famagusta. Defenceless Turkish villagers who have no weapons live in an atmosphere of terror and they evacuate their homes and go and live in tents in the forests. The Greeks' actions are a shame to humanity.\" On 22nd July Turkish Prime Minister Ecevit had called upon the UN to stop the genocide of Turkish?Cypriots and declared \"Turkey has accepted a cease?fire, but will not allow Turkish?Cypriots to be massacred\" (Times 23rd July). At the beginning of the Second Geneva Conference he said \"A solution which is not based on geographical separation will not work. It is out of the question for us to entrust the safety of the Turkish Cypriots to the Greeks, who cannot even rule themselves. The areas around the Turkish forces are being mined, and the Turkish Cypriot villages are still under siege.\" The UK House of Commons Select Committee on Cyprus reported in 1976 \"The second phase of military operations was inevitable in the view of your committee as the position reached by Turkish forces at the time of the first cease-fire was untenable militarily\". On 1st February 1966 in Athens the Greek Cypriot leader, Archbishop Makarios, had already declared: \"They [the Zurich & London Agreements] today stand abrogated and buried. Neither Turkey nor any other power can breathe life into them again.\" Sir Anthony Kershaw took the following view in his speech in Cyprus on 23rd October 1990: \"In order to protect the Turkish Cypriots, Turkey intervened in exercise of her rights under article 4 of the 1960 Treaty of Guarantee. No one has ever suggested that was illegal but they have gone on to say that the continuing use of troops, not to restore the 1960 Constitution but to enforce partition was illegal. But does this not ignore the reality of the situation? In law it is said that the Turks were invoking the Guarantee; but to say that they were obliged to work for no result except the restoration of the 1960 Constitution is absurd. That Constitution had ceased to exist. The reconciliation of the law with the actual political situation, or indeed with ordinary common sense, was becoming more difficult. The Turks came to protect the lives of the Turkish Cypriots and they had good reason to know that the restoration of the 1960 Constitution was not the way to do that. The only way to do that was with troops on the ground.\" The British Foreign Secretary answered \"yes\" to the following question from the House of Commons Select Committee on Cyprus (HC. 331 1975/76, page 55, para. 141): \"Would the Foreign Secretary agree that we could hardly restore the 1960 Constitution, since at least two of the provisions which were enshrined in the Constitution, the separate municipalities and the Turkish (Cypriot) share of the police and civil service, were never in fact implemented?\" \"Turkey intervened to protect the lives and property of the Turkish?Cypriots, and to its credit has done just that. In the 12 years since, there have been no killings and no massacres\" Lord Willis (Lab.) House of Lords 17th December 1986 (Hansard, col. 223) On 12th March 1977 Makarios declared \"It is in the name of ENOSIS that Cyprus has been destroyed.\" Turkey, having defeated the Sampson coup in 1974, had no choice but to extend its protection in August 1974 and to maintain it until such time as the security of the Turkish Cypriots could otherwise be effectively guaranteed. Turkey has since that time encouraged the Turkish Cypriots to negotiate an agreed alternative to the 1960 Republic, and Turkey has supported the acceptance by the Turkish Cypriots of successive UN plans for a settlement. By Resolution 889 (1993) the Security Council \"welcomes the declared support of the Government of Turkey for the package of confidence-building measures.\" There is little doubt that the Greek Cypriot ambition for ENOSIS, was a major cause of the breakdown of the Constitution and the dreadful events of 1963 ? 1974. Greek Cypriots claim that today dreams of ENOSIS are dead. This is improbable, but even if it were true the Turkish Cypriots have as much reason to fear Greek Cypriot as Greek, domination. back to contents\n\nVII TWO STATES EMERGE Turkey's action in 1974 created a safe haven for the Turkish Cypriots, just as seventeen years later the western powers, with Turkey's help, created a safe haven for the Kurdish people in Northern Iraq, and twenty-five years later - again with Turkey's help - created a safe haven in Kosovo. Britain should have taken the lead at the United Nations as from 1963 to ensure that no international acceptance was given to any \"Government of Cyprus\" which continued to be in breach of the 1960 agreement. The Cyprus seat should have remained vacant until it could again be lawfully occupied. Instead Britain did the exact opposite, and took the lead in securing the adoption of the now notorious Security Council Resolution 353 in 1974 which, after all that had happened, continued to treat the Greek Cypriot regime as the Government of Cyprus and denied the Turkish Cypriots their independence. During the events of 1974, and following a formal exchange of populations agreement made between Rauf Denkta and Glafcos Clerides in 1975, Turkish Cypriots moved to the North and Greek Cypriots moved to the South. Many innocent people suffered on both sides, and many on both sides lost their homes and their possessions. The Greek Cypriots did not however suffer such extreme hardship as the Turkish Cypriots had suffered in the period 1964-74, because a massive international relief programme was mobilised to help them. Neither in 1964 nor 1974 did the Turkish Cypriots receive any relief, except from Turkey. On 30th July 1974 the Geneva Declaration of the Guarantor powers recognised: (a) that Constitutional Government no longer existed in Cyprus\n\n(b) the existence in Cyprus of two autonomous administrations; one Turkish Cypriot and the other Greek Cypriot. The 1960 agreement having been repudiated by the conduct of the Greek Cypriots, and indeed expressly abrogated by the Greek Cypriot leaders, Turkish Cypriots could not live for long in a political limbo, so On 13th February 1975 they declared Northern Cyprus to be a Federated State, with a democratic constitution, but with the declared intention that it should one day form part of a federation for the whole of Cyprus. Once more the UN showed its partiality, and in Security Council Resolution 367 \"regretted\" the decision of the Turkish Cypriots, while continuing to reward the unilateral decision of the Greek Cypriots in 1963 to impose their own autonomous administration on Cyprus. There is an inherent contradiction in this resolution, which stresses negotiations between the two communities on an equal footing and on the other hand regrets the assertion by the Turkish Cypriots of the statehood that evinced their need to possess equal standing as a State with the Greek Cypriots. (Lauterpacht. op cit.). No progress toward settlement having been made, the Turkish Cypriots declared independence as the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus on 15th November 1983, but still they expressly declared that they wished to work towards a new Constitution for the whole of Cyprus. The Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus today is a multi?party democracy, with a free judiciary, a free press, and free trade unions. On December 13, 1998 the Greek Cypriot newspaper HARAVGI wrote \"After 1974 we tried the tactic of political tension. In 1983 despite knowing that we could start a political conflict, we cut off dialogue in order to apply to the United Nations. The result of this was the proclamation of the TRNC.\" Again Britain, the United Nations, and the world in general deplored this step. The Security Council, by Resolutions 541 and 550, purported to declare the Declaration of Independence \"legally invalid,\" and called upon states not to recognise the TRNC. However, it has never specified whether the constitutional law of Cyprus or international law is said to be the basis of such illegality. If constitutional law, it has never explained how the 1960 constitution, having been repudiated and expressly abrogated by the Greek Cypriot side as long ago as 1963, could still be binding upon the Turkish Cypriot side in 1983. If the Security Council relied on treaty-based international law, the foundation of the 1960 treaties was the joint participation of both communities in the government of Cyprus in the manner laid down in those treaties, but that foundation had been destroyed by the Greek Cypriots and no longer existed. It was that action which was incompatible with the Treaties, not the creation of a new political structure by the Turkish Cypriots to fill the vacuum in which they had been left. \"If the Security Council had assessed the situation as a whole, it could not possibly have concluded that the conduct of the Turkish Cypriot community violated the controlling legal instruments while the conduct of the Greek Cypriot community did not. Nor could it have reached any other conclusion than that the action of the Greek Cypriot community justified the conduct of the Turkish Cypriot community\". (Lauterpacht op.cit.) If general international law was relied upon, there is no general principle which prohibits the dissolution of a constitutional arrangement between two peoples. When the East Pakistanis, with the assistance of Indian troops, decided to dissolve their relationship with the West Pakistanis and form their own State, called Bangladesh, the new state was recognised almost immediately. More recently the emergence of new states from the chaos of Yugoslavia has been recognised. In purporting to make a legal finding, the Security Council did not proceed in a manner appropriate to the performance of a judicial function, and the judgement, in the form of a draft resolution, was already in circulation before the debate began. The Security Council is a political body. It should not purport to act as a judicial body or expect to be respected as such. The Resolutions were tainted by such a degree of selectivity and incompleteness as to render them arbitrary and discriminatory and thus not well-founded in law. It follows that the call to states not to recognise the TRNC was not legally justified\" (Lauterpacht op.cit.) On 29th March 1965 (UN doc. S/6252) the UN Mediator for Cyprus, Dr. Galo Plaza, had said \"It is obvious that the Cyprus problem cannot any longer be solved by trying to implement fully the (1960) Nicosia Treaties and the Constitution governed by the treaties. .... The events since December 1963 have created a situation which makes it psychologically and politically impossible to return to the previous situation.\" The Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus is sometimes described as a \"breakaway state,\" but there was nothing to break away from. It was the Greek Cypriots who broke away from the 1960 Republic in 1963 and set up a wholly Greek Cypriot Republic which they continued, and still continue, to call the Republic of Cyprus. They have usurped even the name of the bi-communal Republic.\n\nback to contents\n\nVIII PERSONAL RELATIONS It is sometimes suggested that since personal relations between Turkish and Greek Cypriots have traditionally been good it is only the Turkish army which is keeping them apart. This is a fallacy. The fact that personal relations were often good did not prevent the murder of Turkish Cypriots in 1963, 1967, and 1974 by Greek Cypriot neighbours whom they knew by name. The Turkish Cypriots have made it clear by an overwhelming majority that they do not wish to integrate with the Greek Cypriots. Personal relations between the two peoples or between their leaders are not the issue, and serve only to mislead. The situati"
