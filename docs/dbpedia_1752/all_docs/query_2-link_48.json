This document summarizes a 1989 judgment from the European Court of Human Rights regarding a case involving Markt intern Verlag GmbH and Klaus Beermann v. Germany. The case centered around articles published by Markt intern criticizing large companies for unfair business practices. Germany found Markt intern violated unfair competition laws. The European Court of Human Rights had to determine if Germany breached Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights protecting freedom of expression. Over multiple days, the court heard arguments from Markt intern and Germany and ultimately ruled on whether Germany violated Markt intern's rights.",
