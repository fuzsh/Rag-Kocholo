This judgment disposes two consolidated Petitions, namely, Petition number 150 of 2016 (herein after referred to as the first Petition) and Petition Number 234 of 2016 (herein after referred to as the second Petition). The common thread in the two Petitions is that they both challenge the constitutionality of sections 162(a) (c) and 165 of the Penal Code.[1] Additionally, the first Petition assaults the said provisions on grounds of vagueness and uncertainty.\n\n2. The second Petition seeks a declaration that sexual and gender minorities are entitled to the right to the highest attainable standards including the right to health care services as guaranteed in Article 43 of the Constitution. The Petitioners also seek an order directing the State to develop policies and adopt practices prohibiting discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation and gender identity or expression in the health sector.\n\nThe Parties\n\n3. EG, the Petitioner in the first Petition describes himself as a lawyer and director of the [Particulars Withheld], a Non-Governmental Organization. He states that he presents this Petition in his own interest as an individual who has been subjected to stigma and discrimination as a direct and indirect result of the impugned provisions. He also describes himself as a gay man who is exposed to the risk of wrongful prosecution under the impugned provisions. He further states that he brings this Petition on behalf of homosexuals (or more precisely Lesbians, Gay, Bisexuals, Transgender, Intersex and Queer (LGBTIQ) citing Article 22(1) (2) (c) of the Constitution.\n\n4. The first Petitioner in the second Petition, JM, is a male adult of sound mind. He claims that he has been subjected to attacks, rape and discriminatory acts because of his perceived or actual sexual orientation, and, that, his family has also been subjected to similar attacks and discrimination purely because of his perceived or actual sexual orientation.\n\n5. The second Petitioner MO, describes self as an adult male of sound mind who has been subjected to public attacks, arbitrary arrests by police, discriminated against purely on the basis of his perceived or actual imputed sexual orientation. He claims to have been attacked and gang raped because of \"his\" perceived or actual imputed sexual orientation.\n\n6. The third Petitioner MAO is a female adult of sound mind and the mother to the second Petitioner. She claims to have witnessed discriminatory acts committed against the second Petitioner, and, to have severally gone to police stations to secure the second Petitioner's release whenever detained on grounds of his perceived or actual imputed sexual orientation.\n\n7. The fourth Petitioner, YP, an adult woman of sound mind claims that her rights to privacy, human dignity and security of the person have been violated because of her imputed sexual orientation. She also states that she has undergone public attacks, arbitrary detention and eviction from her residence and attacks on her business purely because of her perceived or actual imputed sexual orientation.\n\n8. The fifth Petitioner Mark Odhiambo is an adult male of sound mind and a priest based in Kisumu County. He avers that in his interactions with the community, he has witnessed discriminatory acts and attacks against members of lesbians, gay, bisexual and transgender.\n\n9. The sixth Petitioner, Gay and Lesbian Coalition of Kenya, is a civil society organization working on the human rights and welfare of persons of minority sexual orientation and gender identities in Kenya.\n\n10. The seventh Petitioner, Nyanza Western and Rift Valley Network, describes itself as an organization that champions for the respect of human rights and welfare of persons of minority sexual orientation and gender identities in Nyanza, Western and Rift Valley regions of Kenya.\n\n11. The eighth Petitioner is the Kenya Human Rights Commission, a registered Non-Governmental Organization working on and supporting human rights in Kenya and the region.\n\n12. The Petitioners in the second Petition state that they bring the Petition on their own behalf and in public interest seeking orders aimed at actualizing the human rights provisions of the Constitution, to protect the fundamental rights and freedoms of persons of minority sexual orientation and gender identities in the Republic of Kenya.\n\n13. The Respondent in the two consolidated Petitions is the Honorable Attorney General sued in his capacity as the principal legal adviser to the government of Kenya pursuant to Article 156 of the Constitution.\n\n14. The first to sixth Interested Parties filed an affidavit by DKM sworn on 2nd December 2016 on his own behalf and that of the second to sixth Interested parties. He deposes that he is a gay man and that he, together with the second to sixth Interested Parties, have been advocating for the protection of rights of Gays, Bisexuals and Men who have sex with Men (MSM) and Lesbians respectively.\n\n15. The seventh Interested Party, Kenya Christian Professional Forum, is an organization that comprises Christian Professionals engaged in different sectors of the economy. It states that one of its main objects is to campaign for the consideration of the perspectives and ideals held by Christian Professionals in Kenya and by extension all other Christians in legal-policy formulation and public debate on topical and sensitive issues, hence, its interest in the instant Petitions.\n\n16. The eighth Interested Party is the Kenya Legal & Ethical Issues Network on HIV & AIDS whose. Its interest in these Petitions is in relation to the right of MSN to access health care services, and in particular access to HIV care, prevention, and the effect of criminalization of same sex consensual sex and the right to health.\n\n17. The ninth Interested Party Irungu Kangata is the Senator of Muranga County. His interest in these Petitions is to secure the diversity of Kenyan Cultures in their common rejection of homosexuality.\n\n18. The tenth Interested Parties are the registered trustees of Jamie Masjid Ahle Sunneit Waljamait & the Registered Trustees Ummah Foundation.\n\n19. The first Amicus Curiae Katiba Institute describes itself as a non-profit making non-governmental organization with expertise in constitutional law and international human rights law. It states that it is dedicated to the faithful implementation of the 2010 Constitution and more specifically the constitutional principles of the rule of law and human rights.\n\n20. The second Amicus Curiae is the Kenya National Commission on Human Rights, an independent constitutional commission established under Article 59(4) of the Constitution with the mandate to promote and protect the observance of human rights in Kenya.\n\nLitigation history\n\n21. Petition 234 of 2016 was certified under Article 165(4) of the Constitution on 9th June 2016 while Petition No. 150 of 2016 was certified as such on 2nd November 2016. This bench was thereafter constituted on 1st February 2017. On 18th January 2018, the court with the consent of all the parties consolidated the two Petitions. On 22nd February 2018, the court allowed International Commission of Jurists, through Mr. Solomon Ebobra and Queens Counsel Tim Otty to be observers in these proceedings without taking any active role.\n\n22. Although the two Petitions are similar, for ease of clarity, we deem it appropriate to summarize the facts of each Petition as presented by the parties.\n\nPetition 150 of 2016.\n\n23. The first Petition dated 15th April 2016 is supported by the affidavit of EG. The Petitioner also filed two affidavits sworn by expert witnesses namely Prof. Dinesh Bhugra and Prof. Chris Beyrer. He also filed a witness statement signed by Prof. Lukoye Atwoli who gave oral testimony and was cross-examined.\n\n24. In his affidavit, EG deposed that he is emotionally, affectionately, sexually and spiritually attracted to persons of his own sex, that is, to male persons, and, as an openly gay person living in Kenya, he has experienced discrimination and hostility as follows: -\n\na. that in 2011, he was denied service at a barber shop at 20th Century Plaza along Mama Ngina Street, Nairobi despite having patronized the shop for over one year. The reason given was that other patrons had complained about the barber shop providing services to him and that the clients did not want to be associated with LGBTIQ persons;\n\nb. that he has been a target of numerous threatening, insulting and death messages on Facebook and other social media, and, that, on 10th May 2015, the Weekly Citizen posted an article claiming to unveil Kenya’s top Gays including him and other individuals thus violating their right to privacy;\n\nc. that a client of the NGLHRC was on 18th December 2015 fired from his job by a flower handling company, and, his employer told him \"people like you are not allowed in the office;\"\n\nd. that one of his friends had the word \"shoga\" (homosexual) written on his car and on the door to his house in Nairobi, and, feeling intimidated and threatened, he moved out of his home to avoid the stigma;\n\ne. that he has been forced to limit the stigma by keeping a low profile by limiting his social life and has lived in constant apprehension of the risk of arrest, prosecution and conviction for being a gay person;\n\nf. that the impugned provisions affect the sexual and emotional aspects of his experiences of being human, his core private intimacy which he believes is inviolable and has affected and continue to affect his private life decisions;\n\ng. that the said provisions are discriminatory and unjustified and that his attempt to register an NGO to advance their cause was rejected by the NGO Registration Board prompting him to successfully challenge it in court;\n\nh. that between November and December 2015, one of their clients and a founder of a lesbian and bisexual women's group in Mombasa was targeted by a group of vigilantes in Shimo La Tewa area who assaulted her and threatened to kill her forcing her to flee from her home;\n\ni. that on 24th May 2015 one of their clients was assaulted by police officers at Parklands Police Station where he had gone to report loss of his property for 'dressing very gay\" while another person was assaulted on 28th February 2016 for working with LGBTIQ;\n\nj. that on 27th December 2015 yet another client was assaulted and evicted by her landlord for watching sex movie with her girlfriend while naked and, lastly;\n\nk. that on 18th February 2014 some parliamentarians issued a statement calling for the arrest of all homosexual persons and incited the pubic to arrest them where the police fail to do so.\n\n25. In support of his petition, EG filed a witness affidavit sworn by Prof. Dinesh Bhugra, a Professor Emeritus of Mental Health and Cultural Diversity; a Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians of London; a Fellow of the Royal College of Psychiatrists; a Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh; a Fellow of the Royal College of Public Health Medicine and an Honorary Fellow of amongst others.\n\n26. Prof. Bhugra also deposes that he was the President of the World Psychiatric Association (WPA) from 2014-2017, an Association of National Psychiatric Societies which included 140 member societies from 120 different countries representing more than 200,000 individual psychiatrists whose core mandate is to promote the highest possible ethical standards in Psychiatric work. He states that he has authored or co-authored over 275 peer-reviewed articles on issues of psychiatry, psychology and mental health and also authored or co-authored over 30 books in the same field.\n\n27. Prof Bhugra states that in 2016, the WPA issued its position statement on gender identity and same sex orientation, attraction and behaviours intended to set out an authoritative statement on the current state of scientific knowledge in respect of homosexual and bisexual orientation and associated matters of ethical clinical practice. In the position statement, WPA, considers same sex attraction, orientation and behaviours as normal variance for human sexuality; and recognizes the universality of same sex expression across cultures and that same sexual orientation arises in all cultures worldwide.\n\n28. Further, that WPA considers sexual orientation innate, and determined by biological, psychological development and social factors and recognizes the multifactorial causation of human sexuality, orientation, behavior and lifestyle.\n\n29. According to Prof Bhugra, considerable scientific research has been undertaken on the subject but that the exact mixture of factors giving rise to sexual orientation have not been conclusively established, and the same position statement states that approximately 4% of the world population identify with the same sex orientation.\n\n30. Prof Bhugra goes on to quote the Position Statement which states, inter alia, that WHO accepts same sex orientation as a normal variant of human sexuality,[2] and that the United Nations Human Rights Council, 2012 values lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender(LGBT) Right. In his opinion, modern scientific and medical standards recognize that there is nothing disordered about same sex sexual orientation or behavior, which is not any kind of illness or disorder but part of the variation of human beings, which occurs naturally by reference to multiple variations in fundamental characteristics and attributes.[3] Prof Bhugra also cited the Psychological Society of South Africa[4] and Psychological Association of the Philippines[5] both of which uphold the same view.\n\n31. Prof Bhugra argues that same sexual orientation being a natural variation within human sexuality and not any kind of illness or disorder is not a suitable subject matter susceptible to treatment; and that attempts to treat and change sexual orientation are harmful to the mental health of persons subjected to such attempts and therefore unethical. Prof. Bhugra, quoted the Position Statement to the effect that discrimination and stigmatization have negative health consequences of LGBT people and that LGBT individuals show higher unexpected rates of psychiatric disorders and once their rights and equality are recognized, this rate starts to drop.\n\n32. He also quoted WHO Comprehensive Mental Health Action Plan 2013-2013 and concluded that the removal of stigmatization and discrimination contributes to an improvement in the mental health of LGBT people.\n\n33. EG also filed an affidavit sworn by Prof. Chris Beyrer, a Professor in Public Health and Human Rights; a Professor of Epidemiology, International Health, Behavior and Society, Nursing and Medicine among other qualifications.\n\n34. Prof Beyrer deposed that he has extensive experience in conducting international collaborative research and training programs in HIV/ AIDS and other infectious diseases and provided advisory services on the subject. He swore the affidavit to provide his expert views on public health implications of laws criminalizing same-sex sex, particularly from the perspective of the global HIV epidemic, contending that criminalization laws operate as a critical barrier to HIV prevention, treatment and care efforts.\n\n35. Prof. Beyrer deposed that MSM have been a vulnerable group throughout the global HIV epidemic and that Laws criminalizing consensual adult same-sex sex, social stigmatization, and discrimination have exacerbated health risks facing MSM; promoted violence against them and restricted their access to adequate prevention and medical treatment.[6] He cited Sullivan et al., 2009 and his own research C. Beyrer et al., 2016 and deposed that they bear the highest rates of HIV infection in many countries.\n\n36. Referring to C. Beyrer et al., 2012, he deposed that Data on this burden is incomplete; that individual country reports vary widely on HIV prevalence, incorporate exceedingly small samples of MSM for studies, and oftentimes provide a very limited surveillance of how HIV impacts MSM.\n\n37. Prof Beyrer deposed that HIV infection among MSM tends to be higher in countries criminalizing same sex sex, as compared with countries, which do not criminalize. Further, he deposed that Healthcare providers often carry their own biases against MSM, which can minimize or prevent access to appropriate healthcare for MSM. He also deposed that many MSM fear testing, counseling and treatment services due to social stigmatization, potential conflict, violence, arrest, extortion, blackmail by the police and other public authorities and tension within their households, families and communities. [7] He however also admitted that elimination of criminalization laws is not sufficient to address all the health needs of MSM. Prof Beyrer concluded that decriminalization of same-sex practices is not just a battle over legal doctrine or religious principle; but it is a fight for better health for all.\n\n38. EG also called Prof. Lukoye Atwoli an expert witness, who is an Associate Professor of Psychiatry and Dean at the Moi University School of Medicine, College of Health Sciences in Eldoret. He also holds other qualifications.[8] In his oral testimony, Prof. Lukoye Atwoli adopted his witness statement dated 9th February, 2018 as his evidence in chief. He stated that he specializes in the area of trauma and mental health, including children’s mental health, HIV and mental health, and general hospital psychiatry. He further stated that he has dealt with a wide range of issues relating to the mental health affecting LGBT persons in Kenya in the course of his professional practice as a psychiatrist. He also stated that he teaches university courses on human sexuality, which include issues concerning the nature and experiences by individuals, of homosexual and bisexual sexual orientation and related mental health issues.\n\n39. Prof. Lukoye Atwoli testified that from his experience as a psychiatrist and as an academic researcher, the scientific consensus in the fields of psychiatry and psychology and related social and medical sciences, on the nature of sexual orientation is that human sexuality is considered on the basis of three related matters – sexual orientation, sexual identity and sexual behavior. Further, that all human beings can be placed somewhere on a spectrum encompassing heterosexual, bisexual, homosexual and asexual. In addition, he stated that sexual orientation cannot be predicted at birth, but an individual’s sexual orientation is largely fixed and immutable.\n\n40. Further, he testified that the determinants of sexual orientation are complex and have not been conclusively scientifically established. However, he stated that the established scientific consensus is that as with most matters relating to humans, the causation reflects a complex mix of biological, psychological and social or environmental factors.\n\n41. He referred to the working definition of sexuality as given by WHO thus:\n\n“…a central aspect of being human throughout life; it encompasses sex, gender identities and roles, sexual orientation, eroticism, pleasure, intimacy and reproduction. Sexuality is experienced and expressed in thoughts, fantasies, desires, beliefs, attitudes, values, behaviours, practices, roles and relationships. While sexuality can include all of these dimensions, not all of them are always experienced or expressed. Sexuality is influenced by the interaction of biological, psychological, social, economic, political, cultural, legal, historical, religious and spiritual factors.”[9]\n\n42. Responding to affidavit evidence tendered by the 7th interested party, in respect of sexual orientation of identical twins suggesting that sexual orientation may result from genetic or biological factors, Prof. Lukoye contended that such conclusion is not supported by science. In his view, no two human beings even where sharing the same womb, experience life in an identical manner.[10] In support of his proposition, he cited the study by K. Richardson and S. Norgate where it was noted that “equal environment assumption” (EEA) in Twin Studies may not hold even in identical twins.[11]\n\n43. In his view, it is possible that the intra-uterine hormonal exposure of one twin may differ significantly from another, resulting in identical twins being exposed to different biological factors. He further stated that genetics may be one aspect of the overall picture, but even in respect of genetics, the question as to which parts of a person’s DNA are activated and which are not is a product of complex environmental factors, including intra-uterine hormonal factors; and that the expression of the genetic code in any one individual depends on many different factors.\n\n44. Prof. Lukoye acknowledges, however, that other studies on twins have established that identical twins do have a higher chance of both being homosexual than non-identical twins or other siblings.[12] He cited the study carried out by K. S. Kendler, L. M. Thornton, S. E. Gilman, R. C. Kessler which found that biometrical twin modelling suggested that sexual orientation was substantially influenced by genetic factors, but family environment may also play a role.\n\n45. Prof Lukoye further cited other studies[13] that support a familial link, and do not support the idea that siblings of homosexuals may behaviourally ‘acquire’ homosexuality. He also stated that contrary to the suggestion in the affidavit by Dr Wahome Ngare, identifying identical twins where one identifies as having a homosexual sexual orientation and one as having a heterosexual sexual orientation does not prove any proposition with respect to the existence of genetic or biological factors among the determinants of same sex sexual orientation.\n\n46. Prof. Lukoye Atwoli emphasised that it is not possible to change sexual orientation through ‘medical intervention. In his view, where a person’s sexual orientation (or identity) truly changes in life (without the intervention of coercion or stigmatization), what is often happening is that the individual has come to understand and recognize/accept a fundamental part of his or her human personality, his or her sexual orientation, which he or she had previously repressed or not appreciated or understood.\n\n47. He maintained that homosexual or bisexual sexual orientation is not a disease, as they are not included as disorders in the main international classifications for diseases and mental disorders.[14] He further stated that since it is not a disease, doctors cannot properly or ethically speak of seeking to treat or change homosexual or bisexual sexual orientation.\n\n48. According to Prof. Lukoye Atwoli, any attempt to “treat,” or change homosexual or bisexual sexual orientation often cause the persons subjected to such efforts or “treatment” significant mental and psychological harm, and that efforts to change sexual orientation (“conversion therapies”), have been largely scientifically discredited.[15]In his view, restricting or denying the existence of sexual orientation other than heterosexual will not reduce the incidence of such other sexual orientations; and that homosexual and bisexual sexual orientation will continue to exist in a minority of people whether or not they are restricted by the criminal law or by societal norms.\n\n49. On what is “normal” human sexuality, Prof Lukoye Atwoli quoted the WHO current working definition of sexual health which is\n\n“…a state of physical, emotional, mental and social well-being in relation to sexuality; it is not merely the absence of disease, dysfunction or infirmity. Sexual health requires a positive and respectful approach to sexuality and sexual relationships, as well as the possibility of having pleasurable and safe sexual experiences, free of coercion, discrimination and violence. For sexual health to be attained and maintained, the sexual rights of all persons must be respected, protected and fulfilled.”[16]\n\n50. Prof. Lukoye Atwoli asserted that normal human sexuality includes feeling attracted to persons, being able to express your attraction for such persons and being free to approach them in consequence, and if they are similarly attracted and willing to engage in consensual sexual activity.\n\n51. According to Prof. Lukoye Atwoli, in the absence of legal and social stigmatisation or other factors suppressing normal sexual behaviour, most people will express their sexuality in a way, which accords with their sexual orientation. He added that as a matter of scientific analysis, sexual orientation, sexual identity and sexual behaviour are distinct and interdependent elements of human sexuality, they cannot be divorced from each other, and, therefore the restriction of any of the three elements impairs the functioning of normal human sexuality.\n\n52. In Prof. Lukoye Atwoli's view, in a society where sexual acts between two consenting adults of the same sex are stigmatized or otherwise discouraged, more individuals with a bisexual or homosexual orientation will repress their sexual identity or will not be open about their sexual orientation. He argued that where homosexual or bisexual behaviour is not criminalised, the social atmosphere for LGBT people would improve.\n\n53. In his view, criminalisation of same sex sexual acts leads to a wide range of mental health issues and relationship dysfunction. He stated that attacks, stigmization or violence on LGBT people might cause trauma to the individual, leading to posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, anxiety disorders and substance use disorders.[17]\n\n54. Responding to the 7th Interested Party’s alleged link between homosexual sexual orientation and child sexual abuse, Prof. Lukoye Atwoli contended that there is no linkage between sexual orientation and sexual abuse.\n\n55. He also stated that while it is correct to say that, generally, a person who has been abused is statistically more likely to become abusive later in life, that finding is not limited to any particular sexual orientation and applies to all sexual orientations and all forms of abuse. He argued that abusive behaviour by victims of abuse is a product of the human condition, giving rise to the common precept that “hurting people hurt people.”\n\n56. Responding to the concluding statement of the study by Roberts et al relied on by Dr Wahome Ngare, Prof. Lukoye Atwoli argued that the study disputes the suggestion that it is established science that sexual abuse in childhood causes homosexual orientation in later life. He maintained that the article is misinterpreted and misused in the Affidavit of Dr Ngare to suggest a singular association, contrary to what is actually said by the authors and asserted that the article explicitly does not settle the matter, but leaves it open to further research.\n\n57. Prof. Lukoye Atwoli concluded that, in respect of an individual who has suffered sexual abuse as a child, it is established that one of the consequences of the abuse is that the person may act in a less sexually inhibited way in the future, regardless of whether the abuse was caused by a heterosexual or homosexual. In his view, therefore, any attempt to link the decriminalization of any kind of sexual conduct between consenting adults of the same sex to sexual abuse of others, including children, is wholly unfounded in science.\n\nLegal foundation of Petition 150 of 2016.\n\n58. The first Petition challenges the constitutionality of sections 162 and 165 of the Penal Code[18] on grounds that the provisions have in effect, or are in practice applied to criminalize private consensual sexual conduct between adult persons of the same sex. The Petitioner contends that the provisions are vague and uncertain, because they breach the principles of legality and rule of law and infringe the rights of Kenyan citizens.\n\n59. The first Petition questions the constitutional legitimacy of the State in seeking to regulate the most intimate and private sphere of conduct of Kenyans, regardless of their sexual orientation. He states that to the extent that the impugned provisions purport to criminalize the relevant conduct, they are unconstitutional, and by dint of Article 2 of the Constitution are null and void to the extent of the inconsistency because they: -\n\na. Violate Articles 27 (Equality and freedom from discrimination), Article 28 (Human dignity), Article 29 (Freedom and security of the person), Article 31 (Privacy) and Article 43 (Economic and social rights-specifically health);\n\nb. contravene common law and constitutional principles (including Articles 10 and 50 of the Constitution) relating to legal certainty on account of their vagueness and uncertainty and consequently, cannot operate to create criminal penalties;\n\nc. violate International law which has been incorporated as part of domestic law by virtue of Article 2 of the Constitution;\n\nd. that the principle of legality requires that criminal offences be clearly, precisely and comprehensively drafted so as to be understood by ordinary Kenyan citizens.\n\ne. That the impugned provisions fail intelligibly to define the conduct to which they relate, hence, they violate the constitutional principle of the rule of law in Article 10(2)(a) of the Constitution, the common law principle of legal certainty and the right to a fair hearing provided under Article 50(2)(n)(i) of the Constitution.\n\n60. The Petitioner in the first Petition also states that he brings the Petition to end what he considers unjust and unconstitutional state of affairs whereby LGBTIQ Kenyans are exposed to the risk of criminal prosecution and imprisonment because of the climate of social opprobrium towards them perpetuated by the criminalization of their sexual orientation and identity.\n\n61. Consequently, he invites this court to strike down the impugned provisions for being unconstitutional. In the alternative, he urges the court to interpret the said provisions in a manner that excludes them from the ambit of the private consensual sexual conduct between adult persons of same sex. The Petition is founded on Articles 2, 19, 20, 21, 24, 25, 31, 43 and 259 of the Constitution.\n\n62. In his view, to the extent that the impugned provisions declare the conduct as unnatural or grossly indecent and criminalize it, the provisions degrade the inherent dignity of the affected individuals by outlawing their most private and intimate means of self-expression. He further claims that sexual intimacy between consenting adults is a fundamental part of the experience of humanity, and an essential element of how individuals express love and closeness to one another; and, establish and nurture relationships. He argues that to criminalize one's conduct of engaging in sexual intimacy in private with another consenting adult, and in a manner which causes no harm to any third party or to the parties so engaging, amounts to a fundamental interference in the person's experience of being human and their personal dignity and privacy and amounts to degrading treatment.\n\n63. He also avers that where the law criminalizes consenting adult sexual intimacy only to persons of a certain sexual orientation, such a law is plainly discriminatory and fundamentally impairs access to adequate health care services and jeopardizes public health generally. He claims that sexual orientation which involves the expression of love and sexual intimacy between persons of the same sex (whether male or female), is an intimate and fundamental part of the human personality of a minority of persons across all places and times worldwide. He further argues that sexual orientation is intimate and is determined by biological, psychological development and that same sex attraction, orientation and behavior is considered as normal variants of human sexuality.\n\n64. Lastly, the Petitioner argues that his Petition neither concerns same sex marriage, nor does it seek to legalize same sex marriage; and, if successful, it will not have the effect of mandating or requiring Kenya to recognize same sex marriage. He maintains that the Petition only challenges the criminalization and severe punishment under the criminal law of a section of Kenyan society because of the fundamental and innate characterization of their sexual orientation.\n\nPetition No. 234 of 2016.\n\n65. The eight Petitioners in Petition No. 234 of 2016 challenge the constitutionality of sections 162(a) (c) and 165 of the Penal Code.[19] They aver that the two provisions violate Articles 27(4), 28, 29, 31, 32, 43, 50 of the Constitution. They also argue that the impugned provisions undermine fundamental human rights guaranteed by Articles 1,2,3,7,9,12 and 28 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR); Articles 2.1,17.1, 6.1, 7,9.1, 17, 17.1, 26 and 26 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR); Articles 2.2, and 12.1 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR); Articles 2,3,4,6,10,19 and 28 of the African Charter on Human and Peoples Rights (ACHPR) and Resolution 275 of the ACHPR. On the basis of the foregoing, they ask the court to give meaning to the provisions of the Constitution that they claim are offended by section 162(a)(c) and 165 of the Penal Code[20] by declaring them null and void.\n\nThe Respondent's response\n\n66. The Respondent filed grounds of opposition on 19th August 2016. He states that the preamble to the Constitution acknowledges the supremacy of the almighty God who is the objective moral law giver and that this informed the decision to retain the impugned provisions. He contended that the Petitioners have failed to lay clear grounds for the court to find the impugned sections unconstitutional. He maintained that the Constitution recognizes marriage as a union of two consenting adults, male and female, and, that the legislative function of the State is exercised by Parliament, hence, the court cannot compel the government to legalize homosexuality by amending the impugned provisions. He also stated that sexual orientation of an individual is fixed at the birth latest and cannot be changed by any means.\n\n67. The respondent further states that the court will be overstretching its mandate if it grants the orders sought, and, if granted, the orders would have a drastic impact on the cultural, religious, social policy and legislative functions in Kenya as it would amount to legalizing homosexuality through the back door. Finally, the Respondent contended that the Petition is incompetent, misconceived, misplaced and is an abuse of the process of the court as the Petitioners' rights and fundamental freedoms have not been violated.\n\nThe First to Sixth Interested Parties’ Affidavit in support of the Petition\n\n68. The 1st to 6th Interested Parties filed an affidavit in support of the Petition sworn by the 1st Interested Party, DKM on 2nd December 2016. He deposed that he and the 2nd to 6th interested parties advocate for protection of rights of Gays, Bisexuals, MSM and Lesbians. He also averred that he has been involved in HIV and AIDS research among gay men for over ten years and established that Gay men and other MSM are vulnerable to stigma, discrimination, violence and that sexual behavior of gay men and other MSM has implications for both men's and women's reproductive health. He also stated that the population of Kenyan MSM is larger than believed.\n\n69. He further averred that the 4th Interested Party has been a victim of prosecution and persecution, in that he was arrested and charged under section 162 of the Penal Code.[21] That he was forced to undergo examination, which greatly violated his fundamental rights and freedoms, and that, as a catholic, the existence of the said provisions, make him fear confessing before a priest. In addition, he claimed that the impugned provisions infringe on their privacy and freedom of expression, and, that, they have suffered not only in the hands of the state through prosecution, harassment, vilification, ridicule, attacks, stigmatization, discrimination and persecuted by non-state actors.\n\nThe Seventh Interested Party’s Response to the Petitions\n\n70. The 7th Interested Party filed a number of documents in response to the Petitions namely:\n\ni. Response dated 9th November 2017;\n\nii. Replying Affidavit sworn by Anne Mbugua on 18th January 2018;\n\niii. Replying Affidavit sworn by Dr Wahome Ngare on 18th January 2018;\n\niv. Expert witness Affidavit sworn by Dr Johnson Kilonzo Mutiso on 22nd February 2018;\n\nv. Replying Affidavit sworn by Anne Mbugua on 21st February 2018.\n\n71. In its response dated 9th November, 2017, the 7th Interested Party contended inter alia that the Constitution confers the legislative mandate upon Parliament, hence, this Petition aims to use judicial craft to legitimize gay liaisons and such other indecent offences and create a new breed of rights which do not exist in the Constitution. In addition, it states that no right confers a cover to an individual to engage in illegal criminal conduct.\n\n72. It further states that the very nature of criminal law is to circumscribe conduct that is considered wrong the content often being moral, hence, the argument that morality cannot be used must fail. On the alleged vagueness of the impugned provisions, the 7th Interested Party states that the Petitioners contention that the provisions offend the right to equal treatment for persons of homosexual orientation, is by itself an admission of the certainty of the provisions. It also states that the provisions clearly criminalize homosexual carnal knowledge.\n\n73. The 7th Interested further states that it is unsustainable to allege unfairness when society frowns upon persons who are deemed to engage in criminal conduct. In addition, it states that the law is an expression of moral inclinations in the society; that in the realm of criminal law, there is no requirement that there has to be an individual victim for a crime to be complete; and, that the alleged violation of constitutional rights cannot arise since the conduct in question is illegal. Lastly, it states that no evidence has been adduced to show that persons engaged in homosexuality are denied medical care.\n\n74. Additionally, the 7th Interested Party filed a Replying affidavit sworn 18th January 2018 by it chairperson Anne Mbugua in response to Petition 150 of 2016. She deposed that she served as a trainer of trainers during the run up to the referendum that led to the adoption of the 2010 Constitution. To her knowledge, homosexual conduct and abortion arose and the resounding answer that was given by the Committee of Experts was that the new Constitution did not permit abortion nor did it legalize homosexual conduct.\n\n75. Further, she deposed that despite our Constitution heavily borrowing from the South African Constitution, sexual orientation provided in section 9(3) of their Constitution, is not included in Article 27(4). She deposed that the Constitution does not legalizes homosexual conduct nor does it envisage the use of an interpretation intended to circumvent the will of the people of Kenya.\n\n76. She also stated that criminalization of homosexuality is within the confines of the law and that individual liberty is circumscribed where it offends common good and public policy and that the state has a duty to protect the morals and traditional values recognized by the community. Further, that the quest to validate homosexual law is an assault on Article 45 of the Constitution. Moreover, that Article 24 provides for limitation of rights which limitation is justifiable on the basis of public interest and public policy.\n\n77. Ms Mbugua referred to annexture AM2 to her affidavit which is a Replying Affidavit sworn by Dr. Wahome Ngare an Obstetrician- Gynecologist in which he stated that research and statistics show that persons who identify themselves as homosexuals are often introduced and recruited through sexual abuse by adults and that those who experience such abuse are more likely to abuse children. Mr. Ngare also referred to a research done on identical twins showing that gays are not born as gay.\n\n78. In response to Petition 234 of 2016, Ms Mbugua also swore another affidavit on 21st February 2018. She deposed that the penal statutes do not in any way violate the constitutional rights of the LGBT community; that the impugned provisions do not criminalize a person's condition for having attractions, impulses or desire to engage in prohibited acts. According to Ms Mbugua, the law focuses on the behavior of persons and not their actions or impulses to engage in criminal activities, rather, that the impugned sections criminalize the conduct of engaging in unnatural sexual behavior.\n\n79. In response to the affidavit of JM, Ms Mbugua contends that he has not provided particulars of the persons who raped him, the church he was excommunicated from and the landlord who evicted him from the salon. Further, she deposed that no evidence has been led to demonstrate that the acts complained of flow from the enforcement of the impugned provisions.\n\n80. In response to the affidavit of MO and his mother MAO, Miss Mbugua deposes that no particulars have been furnished to show that the alleged rape and harassment visited on Maureen flow from the enforcement of the impugned provisions.\n\n81. In response to the affidavit of YP, Ms Mbugua deposes that no particulars have been provided on the alleged attack on her at her work place or eviction by her landlord. Further, that no proof that the actions ever took place, and if they did, they were done in the enforcement of the impugned provisions.\n\n82. In response to the affidavit of Daniel Peter Onyango the 8th Petitioner’s Director, Ms Mbugua contends that there was no proof that the alleged or existing stigmatization against the LGBT community has been precipitated by the impugned sections. Further, that stigma is a community reaction to a person’s behavior that is deemed harmful to the society and was a standard mechanism in traditional African society and that no evidence has been given to show that stigma leads to or causes criminal behavior.\n\n7th Interested Party’s Witness Affidavit by Dr Johnson Kilonzo Mutiso\n\n83. The 7th Interested Party also filed a witness affidavit sworn by Dr. Johnson Kilonzo Mutiso on 22nd February 2018[22] in response to the Affidavits sworn by Professor Dinesh Bhugra and Mr. Annand Grover as well as that of Professor Lukoye Atwoli. In his view, matters relating to same sex attraction should not be given a narrow reading or interpretation of medical or scientific literature without linking them to a wider knowledge and experience in the relevant fields such as psychiatry and psychopathology.\n\n84. According to Dr. Kilonzo, there is no scientific and medical research that supports the claim that people are “born gay” or that same sex attraction is innate. He contends that the popular literature from western countries that have decriminalized homosexual behavior tends to be slanted or consistently interpreted to favour the social, legal or political situation preferred by the pro-homosexual groups (the gay lobby).\n\n85. He highlights some literature with a multi-textured view of the matter and contends that the phrase sexual orientation has never been accepted in any binding UN documents and is highly controversial with nations deeply divided over the same. He annexed “JM1,” a document by Family Watch International on the subject and argues that it is untrue that up to 5% of the population suffers from or manifests homosexual tendencies. He asserts that the correct figure is just about 2%.\n\n86. Based on his knowledge, professional experience and comparative review on the topic, Dr. Kilonzo deposes that research is accumulating that stipulates that people are not born gay; and that no research has proven that same sex attraction is an immutable condition like race or sex. To debunk this fallacy, he cites the American Psychological Association, 2008 on the subject to contend that there is no consensus among scientists on the exact reasons why an individual develops a heterosexual, bisexual, gay or lesbian orientation.\n\n87. According to Dr. Kilonzo, reputable scientific research shows that same sex attraction develops because of a complex interaction factors including experience during childhood and adolescence. This \"nurture\" factors, in his opinion, are the environmental factors that are largely of influence as opposed to \"nature\" or genetic factors. Nurture factors are said to include the relationship with parents and peers during early childhood, sexual abuse and gender non-conformity. Referring an article by Dr. Joseph Nicholosi, the deponent states that there is much more evidence for early childhood factors especially the relationship with their parents.\n\n88. Dr. Kilonzo also referred to Floyd Godfrey's Book titled 'A young Man's Journey; healing for young men with unwanted sexual feelings' where it is argued that there are a variety of different contributing factors toward the development of a sexual orientation and that not everyone may have every single one of those contributing factors and that one can unlearn homosexuality through gender reparative therapy.\n\n89. In Dr. Kilonzo's view, evidence from a number of studies support the conclusion that sexual orientation is not pre-determined by DNA. He referred to studies on identical twins, which have returned low incidents of both twins being homosexual[23]and another study by Dean Hammer, which made an effort to show the nexus to a DNA stretch found at the X Chromosomes tip, which did not conclusively find that such nexus exist. He concludes that sexual orientation is “fluid’ and therefore changeable. To support this view, Dr. Kilonzo referred to research conducted by Dr. Jeffrey Satinova in his Book on \"Homosexuality and the politics of Truth\" to show that some people with unwanted same sex attraction can and do change and, therefore, such people should be assisted to seek treatment and not to be left to think that their conditions are irreversible.\n\n90. He further stated that in his own experience, he has attended to patients with unwanted sex attraction seeking to correct this orientation; and that part of the therapeutic process involved assisting them to develop health relationships, the same treatment given to mental patients.\n\n91. He also deposed that from his professional experience and research, homosexuals are at higher risk of developing health related complications than their heterosexual counterparts. To support this view, he cited a study by the National Association of Research and Therapy of Homosexuality (NATH), which concluded that homosexuals suffer about three times more physical, and mental health problems than heterosexuals. Further, that according to a report by the US Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the risk of HIV infection is greater among homosexuals as compared to heterosexuals.\n\n92. In response to the affidavit sworn by Prof. Chris Beyrer, Dr. Kilonzo states that medical literature undeniably demonstrates that MSM have high rates of HIV/AIDS infection and prevalence and therefore, legalization is not the appropriate public health response to harmful behaviour; that the standard medical protocols (as prescribed by law and practices of forensic medicine) should apply for all victims or perpetrators of harmful activity.\n\n93. In response to the affidavit of Prof. Bhugra, Dr. Kilonzo deposed that the WPA does not retain or develop any diagnostic and statistical manual for mental disorders and depends largely on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) prepared by the WPA, which changed its definition of homosexuality in the 1973, 3rd edition of its DSM, due to politics, not science or medicine; that WPA statement that same sex attraction (SSA) is a normal variant of human sexuality is a sociological and philosophical position not justified by science, and contradicted by substantial research in the field. He contended that it is unhelpful to subject science to politics, as this distorts the clinical observations of practicing psychiatrists; and that there is no conclusive scientific research findings on the various claims about biological causation of same sex attraction.\n\n94. Dr. Kilonzo disagreed with Prof. Lukoye Atwoli’s claim that morality and religion are not appropriate inputs in a discussion of science since social sciences recognize the importance of religion, morality and philosophy in guiding human behaviour. He contended that Prof. Lukoye Atwoli simply reproduced western conventional view about homosexuality but failed to recognize the dissenting research and findings from the same western sources on the same issue. In his view, Prof. Lukoye Atwoli’s statement is liberal and wrongly attributes lack of sexual normality to social stress, despite lack of any credible study that wholly attributes sexual disorders and related adverse health outcomes on social stigma.\n\n95. He argued that Prof. Lukoye Atwoli’s views present a theory of criminology and deviance, which is unique to pro-gay literature, and not supported by general theories of crime. He also stated that contrary to Prof. Lukoye Atwoli’s statement, there is no basis for the link between gay behaviour and sexual abuse of minors and that studies have shown that gay lifestyle can promote same sex paedophilia. He contended that the justification for decriminalization of homosexuality and the argument that sexual conduct between consenting adults ought not to be regulated by the State is merely a regurgitation of the liberal philosophy of John Stuart Mill. Lastly, Dr. Kilonzo argued that Sexual behaviour is essentially social with consequences on society; hence, considerations relating to legalization or criminalization of such sexual behaviour should be left to Parliament.\n\nEighth Interested Party's Replying Affidavit\n\n96. The eighth Interested Party, Kenya Legal and Ethical Issues Network on HIV & AIDS (KELIN) filed a Replying Affidavit sworn by Ishmael Omumbwa on 9th February 2018 in support of the Petitions.\n\n97. At paragraph two of the said affidavit, the deponent states that he swears the affidavit on behalf of Persons Marginalized and Aggrieved in Kenya (PEMA-Kenya). We have extreme difficulty connecting PEMA-Kenya, the deponent and the eighth Interested Party. Neither Ishmael Omumbwa nor PEMA-Kenya is a party to these proceedings. Accordingly, we find no basis for considering this affidavit.\n\n98. The eighth Interested Party also filed an expert witness Affidavit sworn by Anand Grover, an Advocate practicing in the Supreme Court of India and High Courts of Delhi and Mumbai. He deposed that he has over thirty years’ experience in the areas of HIV/AIDS and Human Rights Law.[24]\n\n99. He deposed that he served as the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the right of every one to the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health in which capacity he undertook nine country missions and produced fourteen thematic reports. He stated that one of the reports examined the relationship between the right to health and criminalization of private adult consensual behavior, including same sex conduct and sexual orientation. He deposed that criminal sanctions dissuade gay men and other MSM from seeking health services. The rest of his depositions are essentially legal arguments.\n\nThe 9th Interested Party's Replying Affidavit\n\n100. The ninth Interested Party filed a Replying Affidavit sworn on 28th February 2018 opposing the Petitions. He deposed that during the constitution making process, the Committee of Experts received over 5000 memoranda from Kenyans overwhelmingly rejecting homosexuality. According to Mr. Kangata, the two petitions are essentially asking the court to legislate. He stated that decriminalizing the impugned conduct would violate Article 44 of the Constitution. In his view, none of the Kenyan communities or culture embraces homosexuality and that historically, homosexuality was punished through ostracization or death.\n\n101. On the net effect of decriminalizing homosexuality, Mr. Kangata argued that the conduct is inimical to the Kenyan State and public interest in that it is against procreation. In addition, he stated that decriminalizing homosexuality is tantamount to compelling communities to embrace the practice in breach of their right to preservation of their culture.\n\n102. Mr. Kangata contended that there is no demonstrable proof that homosexuality is innate. He maintained that the impugned provisions are lawful and that it is in the interest of the majority to protect and preserve the provisions. He also contended that there is no evidence that the Petitioners' rights to privacy have been infringed in the enforcement of the impugned provisions. He dismissed the Petitioners' averments and depositions contending that homosexuality and lesbianism is a matter of choice not innate.\n\nThe 10th Interested Parties' Response\n\n103. The 10th Interested Parties filed a replying affidavit sworn on 16th February 2018 by Abdul Bary Hamid, the Secretary General of Jamia Mosque, opposing the Petitions. He stated that the Holy Quran and Hadith abhor homosexuality, which echoes Kenyan cultural values, which the people of Kenya desired in the Constitution. He contended that the impugned provisions do not violate the Petitioners’ rights and that those rights are not absolute. He further contended that the impugned provisions are neither ambiguous nor uncertain as alleged and that the mandate of the court is not to legislate but to interpret legislation as enacted by Parliament.\n\nPETITIONERS’ SUBMISSIONS\n\nSubmissions in Petition No. 150 OF 2016\n\n104. The Petitioner’s counsel in Petition No. 150 of 2016 filed written submissions dated 6thOctober 2016 and made oral highlights. They submitted that the Petition is founded upon the discrimination, prejudice and stigma because of attitudes of a section of Kenyans towards the LGBTIQ persons, who view them as criminals.\n\n105. They submitted that government officials, law enforcement officers, healthcare professionals and commercial organizations subject the LGBTIQ people to ill treatment and demean them in their private and public life, which is promoted by existing laws specifically provisions of the Penal Code which criminalizes consensual same sex conduct between adults in private. They argued that the criminalization of the relevant conduct degrades the dignity of the LGBTIQ Kenyans and invades their privacy.\n\n106. They argued that criminalization of the relevant conduct is unconstitutional in that it violates their right to equality, freedom from discrimination (Article 27), human dignity (Article 28), freedom and security of the person (Article 29), privacy (Article 31) and health (Article 43). They maintained that any Law that is inconsistent with the Constitution is void to that extent.\n\n107. Counsel submitted that the impugned provisions foster and promote an environment in which LGBTIQ Kenyans are subjected to a risk of violence, intimidation, extortion, threats of prosecution, discrimination and ill-treatment in connection with the provision of basic government services including health care.\n\n108. Counsel cited Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution on the supremacy and binding nature of the Constitution. They further cited Article 21 on the duty of every state organ to promote and fulfil the rights and fundamental freedoms. They also cited Article 23(3) (d) on the power of the High Court to grant a declaration that any law that denies, violates, infringes or threatens a right or fundamental freedoms, not justified under Article 24 of the Constitution is invalid.\n\n109. They faulted the Respondent’s contention that in allowing the Petition the Court would be usurping the power of the legislature. To buttress their argument, they relied on the case of Eric Gitari v NGO Board & 4 Others[25] (The Gitari case), wherein the court cited with approval the South African case of The State v T. Makwanyane & M. Muchunu[26] for the holding that the Constitution protects human rights of both the minority and the majority. They argued that in exercising its constitutional jurisdiction, especially with regard to the Bill of Rights, the duty of the court is to uphold the Constitution and not the popular views of the majority.\n\n110. Counsel further argued that the impugned provisions violate Articles 10 and 50 of the Constitution and common law for being vague and uncertain. They contended that the impugned provisions do not meet the limitation test under Article 24; that the Bill of Rights does not limit LGBTIQ rights; and that perceiving homosexuality as repugnant to justice and morality based on religious beliefs is not a justifiable ground under Article 24 to limit their rights based on the majority views.\n\n111. According to counsel, LGBTIQ is a marginalized community or group within the meaning of Article 260 and, therefore, the court owes them a special protective duty under Article 21(1) and 21(3). In their view, this case does not seek to legalize same sex marriages as suggested by the Respondent and that therefore allowing this Petition would not affect Article 45(2) on the right of every adult to marry a person of the opposite sex.\n\n112. They maintained that rejecting homosexuality on the basis that it is a western phenomenon, is misconceived, and that majority of the jurisdictions that criminalize homosexuality are former British colonies. They were concerned that although Britain repealed such laws because of the modern understanding of human sexuality and legal and human rights norms, Kenya continues to utilize the same laws imposed by the British over 150 years ago. Petitioner further relied on international law and norms as well as judgments from courts in other jurisdictions to support their Petition.\n\n113. On the question of locus standi, counsel cited Article 22(1)& (2)(b)(c) and cited the cases of Coalition for Reforms and Democracy (CORD) & 2 Others v Republic & Another[27] and Caleb Orozco v Attorney General of Belize & Others.[28] In the latter case, the court held that the threat of prosecution linked to engaging in the relevant conduct was sufficient to bring a claim, a position they argued, has been adopted by courts and treaty bodies in Europe, the Caribbean and the United Nations. They also relied on the case of Dudgeon v The United Kingdom[29] where the court observed that the existence of the legislation directly affected private life. Further reliance was placed on the case of Norris v Ireland[30] where the court had similar views and approach taken by the United Nations Human Rights Committee in the case of Toonen v Australia,[31]holding that laws in Australia purporting to criminalise relevant conduct violated the privacy protections in the ICCPR.\n\n114. It was their submission that even though the Petitioner had not been personally prosecuted under the impugned provisions, he had suffered and continues to suffer from social, moral and political scorn, because, the provisions have a pernicious and ongoing effect on his private life and that of the LGBTIQ persons in general.\n\n115. Regarding the court’s power to strike down provisions on account of unconstitutionality, counsel relied on Articles 2(4), 3(1), 21 and 23 of the Constitution and the case of Mount Kenya Bottlers Limited & 3 Others v Attorney General & Others.[32] Commenting on the case of Community Advocacy & Awareness Trust & 8 Others v Attorney General[33] cited by the Respondent, they submitted that this case is distinguishable from the Petitioner’s case.\n\n116. Counsel also relied on the case of Coalition for Reform & Democracy v Republic of Kenya (supra) and Aids Law Project v Attorney General,[34] where the court struck down several provisions of the Security Laws (Amendment) Act No. 19 of 2014 for violating Articles 33 and 34 of the Constitution. Additionally, counsel relied on the case of Aids Law Project v Attorney General & 3 Others[35] where the court declared section 24 of the HIV and AIDS Prevention and Control Act[36] unconstitutional for being vague and overbroad, lacking certainty and violating the right to privacy under Article 31.\n\n117. With regard to the principles of Constitutional interpretation, they submitted that under Article 20(3)(a) and (b), when interpreting the Bill of Rights, the court has a duty to develop the law to the extent that it does not give effect to a right or fundamental freedom and adopt the interpretation that most favours the enforcement of a right or fundamental freedom.\n\n118. Citing the case of Nderitu Gachagua v Thuo Mathenge & 2 Others[37] and Njoya & Others v Attorney General & 2 Others[38] counsel urged the court to take into account the principles of constitutional interpretation espoused in Articles 20(4) and 259(1). They further relied on an Article by Professor Makau Mutua published in the Daily Nation[39] in which he observed that Kenya’s Constitution is emancipatory, it is not a repressive document that takes away rights, or imagines a closed or rigid category of rights. On the contrary, Prof Mutua argues that the Constitution is a living, not a dead document, one that is frozen in time.\n\n119. Counsel argued that issues of fundamental rights are not to be resolved by reference to private morality or subjective moral or religious views of sections or majority of the populace but by constitutional values and fundamental rights.\n\n120. On the question of non-consensual sexual acts involving minors, counsel argued that the Sexual Offences Act[40] adequately provides for these, and, that therefore the Petitioner is not seeking a reversal or dilution of Kenya’s stringent laws that prohibit non-consensual sex, and all sexual acts in public. It was further submitted that the Petitioners abhor all non-consensual sexual acts and all sexual acts involving minors regardless of the sex or gender of the perpetrator or victim. They also submitted that the impugned provisions are not needed to charge and convict individuals of such non-consensual acts between two adults as they can be charged under other provisions of the law such as the Sexual Offences Act[41] and section 182 of the Penal Code.[42]\n\n121. They urged that should the court not find the impugned provisions unconstitutional, it should interpret them in a manner that would not criminalise relevant conduct. Reliance was placed on Article 20(3) (b) and 20(4), which requires the court to adopt an interpretation that most favours the enforcement of a right or fundamental freedom and which promotes the values that underlie an open and democratic society.\n\n122. On the definitions of the words “indecent” practice and gross “indecency,” counsel portended that they have been addressed through legislative amendments to the Sexual Offences Act[43] in 2007 and 2009. It was their further submission that for an act to be indecent, it must be unlawful and intentional. In their view, section 43(1) of the Sexual Offences Act[44] classifies an act as unlawful if it is committed in coercive circumstances, under false pretences or by fraudulent means or in respect of a person incapable of appreciating the nature of an act, which causes the offense. They therefore submitted that what is clear is that the recent legislative consideration of the concept of indecency excludes from the purview of that concept consensual sex.\n\n123. They further submitted that the notion of indecency in the Sexual Offences Act[45] provides a possible interpretation of the concept of indecency at section 165 of the Penal code, which would be appropriate for the court to adopt. That, as an alternative to the petitioner’s primary submission as to the violation of the Constitution, the section would have to be interpreted to exclude relevant conduct as not being characterised as against the order of nature. They submitted that the support for such an approach is to be found in the increasing widespread recognition that sexual orientation is innate and fundamental part of human personality of a minority of persons worldwide. For this proposition, they relied on the WPA Position Statement on Gender Identity and Same-Sex Orientation, Attraction and Behaviours 2016.[46] They also argued that WHO recognises same sex sexual orientation as a normal variant of human sexuality.\n\n124. Counsel also argued that the impugned provisions are vague and uncertain to render them void as they limit the right to a fair trial under Article 50.\n\n125. Counsel further submitted that if the impugned provisions were to be construed to prohibit relevant conduct, it would infringe on several fundamental rights guaranteed in the Constitution including the right to dignity under Article 28. They argued that the Constitution expressly recognises the importance of human dignity as a right capable of enforcement which right underpins all the other rights. Reliance was placed on A.N.N. v Attorney General[47] where it was held that the Constitution underscores the place of Human dignity in the enjoyment of all other rights in keeping with international treaties and jurisprudence. They cited Dawood v Minister of Home Affairs[48] for the submission that section 10 of the South African Constitution is similar our Article 28 which guarantees every person’s inherent dignity and the right to have the dignity respected.\n\n126. It was further submitted that by virtue of Article 2 (5) and (6), the general rules of international law form part of the law Kenya. They argued that dignity is recognised in several instruments and singled out Article 5 of the ACHPR as well as the provisions in the ICCPR and the ICESCR. Counsel relied on the case of Republic v Kenya National Examinations Council Ex-parte Audrey Mbugua Ithibu[49] in support of their submission on the right to dignity. They also relied on the cases of National Coalition for Gay and lesbian equality v Minister of Justice,[50] and Orozco v Attorney General of Belize[51] and Lawrence v Texas,[52] for the holding that, the law which criminalises sexual conduct singles out homosexual people for social disapproval, thereby creating a climate of insecurity and vulnerability, deliberately and automatically degrading a class of individuals within society.\n\n127. According to counsel, international jurisprudence supports the position that sexuality is an inherent characteristic, which gives rise to essential needs hence the concession by the Respondent in their grounds of opposition that sexual orientation is included within the classes protected by the non-discrimination provisions of the Constitution. Counsel submitted that laws which criminalise relevant conduct are humiliating, degrading and stigmatise the LGBTIQ communities.\n\n128. Citing Article 29 on the right to freedom and security of the person and Article 6 of the ACPHR, counsel argued that the African Commission has stated that the Article must be construed in a manner that permits arrests only in the exercise of powers normally granted to the security forces in a democratic society. In their view, security forces in democratic societies have no power to monitor consensual sexual behaviour between adults hence the infringement of the right to freedom and security of the person is not justified.\n\n129. Counsel invoked the right to privacy guaranteed in Articles 31 of the Constitution and 17 of the ICCPR and urged this court to adopt an interpretation that promotes Kenya’s international legal obligations by virtue of Article 2(6). Additionally, counsel submitted that the right to privacy protects individual decision-making and activities and as such, the State should not invade this right without justification. Reliance was placed on the case of National Coalition for Gay and lesbian equality v Minister of Justice (supra) for this proposition. Further reliance was placed on the case of Toonen v Australia (supra) where the provisions, which criminalised relevant conduct, were challenged as being inconsistent with the ICCPR. They added that the European Court of Human Rights also found that Northern Irish laws criminalising human conduct constituted a violation of the right to privacy.\n\n130. Learned counsel further submitted that every person is equal before the law and to equal protection and benefit of the law, a right guaranteed by international and regional instruments among them, the UDHR; Articles 2 and 26 of the ICCPR and Articles 2 and 3 of the ACHPR. It was their submission that in A.N.N v Attorney General (supra) the court observed that Articles 27 and 28 are the foundational provisions upon which other rights rest.\n\n131. Counsel argued that the Respondent having acknowledged that the Constitution protects everyone from discrimination based on among others sexual orientation, they cannot turn around and argue that Article 27 of the Constitution is exhaustive on prohibited grounds of discrimination. Further, that Article 27(4) uses the word “including” which is defined in Article 259(4) to mean, “Includes, but is not limited to.” Reliance was placed on the case of Eric Gitari v NGO Board. (supra).\n\n132. Regarding the right to health, they argued that Article 43 guarantees every person the right to the highest attainable standard of health and that Article 56 obligates the state to put in place affirmative action programmes designed to ensure that minorities have reasonable access to, among others, health services. Reliance was placed on the case of P.A.O & 2 others v Attorney General[53] where it was held that the right to health, life and human dignity are inextricably bound; and that there can be no argument that without health, the right to life is in jeopardy. They added that Article 12 of the ICESCR and Article 16 of the ACHPR guarantee the same right.\n\n133. They submitted that criminalisation of consensual same sex violates the right to health by creating a perception that individuals who have same sex relationships are abnormal and criminals. In their view, this negatively affects their health and results in lack of health programmes and information tailored to their specific needs. Counsel argued that criminalisation of same sex sexual activity and the right to health has been recognised by the Commonwealth Eminent Persons Group[54]which recommended the repeal of laws criminalising homosexuality as a critical move in the fight against HIV/AIDS.\n\n134. On the alleged vagueness and uncertainty, they submitted that the impugned provisions breach Articles 10(2) (a) on the rule of law and 50 (2) on the right to fair trial and adherence to the principle of legality. Regarding section 162 counsel singled out the phrases “unnatural offences, carnal knowledge of any person against the order of nature;” “permits a male person to have carnal knowledge of him or her against the order of nature,” and submitted that these phrases are not defined and that it is unclear whether the phrases mean sexual intercourse or include oral, anal, vaginal sex, or whether they include any other contact with the genital organ of another person.\n\n135. Regarding section 165, it was submitted that the phrases “indecency with another male person” and “any act of gross indecency with another male person” violate the Constitution. They relied on Aids Law Project v Attorney General (supra) and Keroche Industries Limited v Kenya Revenue Authority & 5 Others[55] for the proposition that a law can be declared unconstitutional for uncertainty. They also relied on the on the case of R v Misra and Srivastava[56] where it was held that vague laws which purport to create criminal liability are undesirable and in extreme cases their vagueness may make it impossible to identify the conduct which is prohibited.\n\n136. On global trends towards decriminalisation, counsel submitted that the impugned provisions contrast the global consensus on the decriminalisation of the LGBTIQ conduct and that a majority of the countries sharing a colonial history with Kenya now recognise the equal rights and dignity of sexual minorities. Counsel cited positions taken by several international and intergovernmental organisations that have recognised the rights of minorities. For this proposition, they relied on the statement by the former UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon who stated, “We must reject persecution of people because of their sexual orientation or gender identity who may be arrested, detained or executed for being lesbian, gay bisexual or transgender.”\n\n137. It was their further submission that several organisations including the ACHPR have adopted resolutions on protection against violence and other human rights violations against persons based on their real or imputed sexual orientation or gender identity. They also submitted that in 2006 the Yogyakarta Principles were adopted by a group of international Human rights experts on the Application of International Human Rights Law in Relation to Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity. The principles articulate state and non-state actors’ obligations to respect, protect and fulfil the human rights of all persons regardless of sexual orientation and gender identity.\n\nThe 1st Petitioner’s reply to the 9th Interested Party’s written submissions\n\n138. The 9th interested Party who opposed these Petitions was joined in these proceedings after all the parties had filed their pleadings and submissions. The court allowed the Petitioners to file further submissions in response to 9th Interested Party’ submissions.\n\n139. Counsel submitted that the 9th Interested Party’s argument that sexual orientation is not one of the prohibited grounds in Article 27(4) is inconceivable because the Respondent’s grounds of opposition concede that prohibition on discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation is included in the Article. Reliance was placed on the Gitari case, which read in sexual orientation in the Article.\n\n140. Responding to the 9th Interested Party’s argument that allowing the Petition is tantamount to allowing gay marriage, counsel submitted that the said argument is unsustainable since there is no connection between the impugned provision and marriage. It was their view that the wording of Article 45 does not permit same sex marriage. Countering the 9th Interested Party’s submission that homosexuality is a western import, counsel stated that it is undeniable that Kenyan society includes LGBTIQ people and that rights guaranteed under the Constitution are to be enjoyed by every person.\n\n141. Counsel submitted that the correct approach to limitation of rights is that limitation of rights must be justified by the state. In their view, there is no rational justification for the measures under the challenged provision. In addition, they argued that moral and religious majority views, however sincerely and widely held, cannot justify limitation of constitutional right.\n\nSubmissions in Petition No. 234 OF 2016\n\n142. Counsel for the Petitioners submitted both in writing and orally. He urged the court to give meaning to the Articles of the Constitution, which are offended by sections 162(a) and (c) and 165 of the Penal Code. He contended that the impugned provisions have been applied to penalise consensual acts or conduct between two adults of particular sexual orientation and, consequently, the petitioners have been subjected to attacks, incarceration and discrimination.\n\n143. He relied on the Yogyakarta Principles on the application of International Human Rights Law in Relation to Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity, which define sexual orientation as each person’s capacity for profound emotional, affection and sexual attraction, to immune and intimate and sexual relations, with individuals of different gender or the same gender or more than one gender.\n\n144. In his view, Gender Identity refers to each person’s deeply felt internal and individual experience, which may or may not correspond with the sex assigned at birth. He maintained that the impugned provisions infringe the Petitioners’ fundamental rights given that the sexual conduct is consensual between adults and is done in private.\n\n145. On the question of capacity to sue and jurisdiction, counsel relied on Article 258(1) (2) (C) and submitted that this petition is brought on the Petitioner’s behalf and in the public interest and Article 165(3). He cited the Eric Gitari case where it was held that the Bill of Rights applies to all persons and that the Constitution should be interpreted in a manner that advances human rights and fundamental freedoms.\n\n146. Regarding the constitutionality of the impugned provisions, counsel set out various Articles of the Constitution and International Conventions and relied on the Indian case of State of Kerala & another v N.M Thomas & Others,[57] which defined equality to mean parity of treatment under parity of conditions. In the said case, the court held that a classification, in order to be constitutional, must rest upon distinction that are substantial and not merely illusory and that the test is whether it has a reasonable basis free from artificiality and arbitrariness embracing all and omitting none naturally falling into the category.\n\n147. He also relied on the cases of Federation of Women lawyers Kenya(FIDA-K) & 5 others v Attorney General & Another,[58] Pravin Bowry v Ethics & Anti-Corruption[59]and Peter K. Waweru v Republic[60] for the holding that Article 27 of the Constitution is violated by a difference in treatment between persons who are in comparable situations. They further relied on the Zimbabwean cases of Human Rights Committee General Comment No 18, Zimbabwe Human Rights NGO Forum v Zimbabwe),[61] The 2010 Report of the Special Rapporteur on the Right of Everyone to the Enjoyment of the Highest Attainable Standard of Physical and Mental Health; and Annand Grover for the postulation that criminalisation is not only a breach of a state’s duty to prevent discrimination; it also creates an atmosphere where affected individuals are significantly disempowered and cannot achieve full realisation of their human rights.\n\n148. On whether the impugned provisions violate Articles 28 of the Constitution, Article 1 of the UDHR and Article 4 of the ACHPR, counsel cited the case of Francis Coralie Mullin v Administrator, Union Territory for Delhi [62]which defined dignity as the pillar of all other rights. He also cited the cases of JWI v Standard Group Limited & Another,[63] Republic v Kenya National Examinations Council & another Ex-parte Audrey Mbugua Ithibu(supra) and S v Makwanyane and Another(supra) for the proposition that human dignity need not be pleaded as a right for it to be enforced as it is inherent and together with the right to life and that it’s an acknowledgement of the intrinsic worth of human beings.\n\n149. Based on the foregoing counsel submitted that the Petitioners’ right to dignity had been infringed as the impugned law seeks to regulate consensual adult sex done in private, yet there is no complainant.\n\n150. On the right to dignity guaranteed by Article 29 of the Constitution, Articles 3 and 9 of the UDHR and Article 6 of the ACHPR, reliance was placed on Coetzee v Government of the Republic of South Africa[64] Nel v Le roux [65]for the holding that freedom and security of the person is primarily the protection against arbitrary deprivation of physical freedom and to do so without any criminal charge being levelled or any trial being held is manifestly a radical encroachment upon the right.\n\n151. He also relied on Bernstein & others v Bester & others[66] for the proposition that freedom has two interrelated constitutional aspects namely, procedural aspect and the right to freedom and security. He further submitted that the ACHPR in its Resolution Number 275 calls for the protection against violence and other human rights violations based on their real or imputed sexual orientation or Gender Identity. It was his submission that Kenya being a member of the African Union, has to adhere to its international treaty obligations.\n\n152. Referring to a report by the 6th Petitioner titled “The Outlawed amongst us” he submitted that the report found that same sex sexual practices remain criminalised in Kenya even though few convictions are based on the impugned provisions; and that persons from the LGBTIQ community are harassed, blackmailed, subjected to verbal and physical abuse and held beyond the legal limits.\n\n153. Regarding the right to privacy guaranteed under Article 31 of the Constitution and Article 12 of the UDHR, he cited Eisenstaedt v Baird [67]for the proposition that the right to privacy is the right of the person whether single or married to be free from unwarranted Governmental intrusion. He also relied on Dudgeon v United Kingdom,[68] Lawrence v Texas[69] and Bernstein v Besta[70] for the holding that criminalisation of private homosexual acts constituted an unjustified interference with the right to privacy. He again relied on Nicholas Toonen v Australia, Communication No 488/1992, U.N. Doc CCPR/c/50/D/488/1992 (1994) for the observation by the Human Rights Committee of the United Nations that Article 17 of the ICCPR, which addresses the right to privacy, covers adult consensual sexual activity between persons of the same sex in private. Further, that, the Committee observed that operation of laws criminalising adult consensual, and private sexual conduct between persons of the same sex as well, as gross indecency interfered with the right to privacy.\n\n154. Based on the foregoing, he submitted that if one is gay he is not allowed to express himself and has no right to privacy. He clarified that this Petition does not seek to justify criminal conduct against minors, or persons who might be coerced or non-consensual acts of persons of the same sex in private.\n\n155. With respect to the right to health guaranteed under Articles 43(1) and 56(e) of the Constitution, Article 25 of the UDHR and Article 16 of the ACHPR, counsel submitted that the said provisions guarantee the right to the highest attainable standard of health, which includes the right to health care services and reproductive health care. He, therefore, submitted that criminalising same sex consensual activity impedes access to and the realization of the right to health in that, it deters individuals from seeking healthcare services for fear of revealing criminal conduct, and being treated in perturbing ways informed by discrimination and stigma.\n\n156. Counsel argued that the right to health is closely related to economic rights hence denial of the right to access healthcare affects economic rights. Reliance was placed on P.A.O v Attorney General (supra) and Purohit and Moore v The Gambia,(Communication No 241/2001, Sixteenth Activity report 2002-2003, Annex VII for the proposition that the state’s obligation with regard to the right to health encompasses not only the positive duty to ensure that its citizens have access to health care services and medication, but must also encompass the negative duty not to do anything that would in any way affect access to health care services.\n\n157. Counsel cited Jonathan Mann in his book Health and Human Rights: A reader, for the correlation between the discriminatory laws and consequent discriminatory environments on accessing the right to health. He also referred to a Report[71] by the UNHCHR, which found that respect for human rights in the context of HIV/AIDS, mental illness, and physical disability leads to better prevention and treatment. Further, that respect for the dignity and privacy of the individual can facilitate more sensitive and humane care and that stigmatisation and discrimination thwart medical and public health efforts to help people with disease or disability. The report recommended member states to take steps to decriminalize consensual same sex conduct and to repeal discriminatory laws relating to sexual orientation and gender identity.\n\n158. He relied on National Coalition For Gay and Lesbian Equality and another v Minister of Justice and others[72] for the proposition that even where the provisions are not enforced, they reduce gay men to unapprehend felons therefore entrenching stigma and discrimination.\n\n159. On whether the impugned provisions pass the limitations test in Article 24, he submitted in the negative and relied on Coalition for Reform and Democracy (CORD) & 2 Others Republic of Kenya & 10 others [73]for the proposition that once a limitation has been demonstrated then the state must justify the limitation. He also cited Karua v Radio Africa Limited T/A Kiss FM Station and Others[74] and Coalition for Reforms and Democracy (CORD) & others v Republic of Kenya & 10 Others (supra) on what is justifiable in an open and democratic society. He argued that the test to be applied should be an objective one and, in this regard, he cited Kivumbi v Attorney General.[75] He also cited Charles Onyango-Obbo and Another v Attorney General[76] for the observation that democratic societies uphold and protect fundamental human rights and freedoms. Counsel also relied on the Eric Gitari case for the proposition that protection of minorities is important from the tyranny of the state and oppression from their fellow human beings. He submitted that the court must look beyond the precepts of justifiability and relied on the case of Kituo Cha Sheria and 7 Others v Attorney General [77]which set out factors that constitute the test of justifiability, adding that dignity must form part of the inquiry. He also relied on the case of Dawood v Minister of Home affairs[78] for the similar proposition.\n\n160. He submitted that public opinion and religious inclinations should not be the basis for limiting fundamental rights. He relied on S v Makwanyane (supra) and Eric Gitari (supra). Counsel further submitted that although sexual orientation is not included in the list of grounds for non-discrimination in Article 27, any other interpretation would be unconstitutional.\n\n161. Advancing his argument on the limitation tests, counsel relied on the case of S v Manamela [79]for the holding that the level of justification required to warrant a limitation of rights depends on the extent of the limitation, and, that, the more invasive the infringement, the more powerful the justification must be. He argued that no level of justification has been given for the limitation created by the impugned provisions.\n\n162. Counsel further submitted that the impugned provisions are not clear and accessible to the public. He relied on R v Rimmington[80] and Grayned v City of Rockford [81]and submitted that the principle of legal certainty enables each community to regulate itself; the law must be adequately accessible and it must be void for vagueness if its prohibitions are not clearly defined; and that vagueness offends several important rules. Citing the Eric Gitari case, he argued that what is deemed to be criminal under the impugned provisions is sexual conduct “against the order of nature” and “gross indecency” but the phrases are not defined in the Act.\n\n163. Counsel argued that the objective of a law must be pressing and substantial. He contended that this Petition concerns the most intimate aspect of human private life, and, therefore, there must be a serious justifiable objective for the limitation. He cited National Coalition For Gay and lesbian Equality v Minister of Justice[82] for the proposition that it is important to denote the precise area in which the limitation operates in order to assist the state. He argued that the impugned law operates to criminalise actions that it does not define and that there is no pressing need to criminalise private consensual sexual acts between persons of the same sex.\n\n164. He further submitted that moral or religious convictions and public opinions that do not accommodate or approve consensual sexual acts between persons of the same sex should not be reasons to warrant state interference. He relied on Patrick Reyes v The Queen[83] for the argument that the court has no license to read its own predilections and moral values into the Constitution. In his view, the impugned provisions do not rationally achieve any objective and that the Government must use least restrictive means to achieve its purpose. He urged the Court to consider that the Petitioners are members of families including church leaders, who engage in consensual sexual conduct in private which should not be criminalized. He concluded by urging the court not to protect the tyranny of majority using fluid morality to undermine the rights of minorities.\n\nThe 1st to 6th Interested Parties’ Submissions\n\n165. Counsel for the 1st-6th Interested Parties submitted in support of the Petition that Sections 162 and 165 violate the right to dignity of the homosexuals, by subjecting them to persecution and prosecution. It was his submission that the Constitution promotes the dignity of individuals and communities for purposes of recognizing and protecting human rights and the Fundamental Freedoms. He cited Article 21 (1) which places a duty on the state and every state organ to protect, promote and uphold the human rights and Fundamental freedoms.\n\n166. He further submitted that Article 2(5) and (6) permits application of International Law. Citing the UN Charter, The Banjul Charter, UDHR, ICCPR with its two Protocols and ICESCR, he argued that these instruments obligate States to observe and protect Fundamental rights and freedoms.\n\n167. He relied on Social and Economic Human Rights Action Center (SERAC) and Anor v. Nigeria,[84] for the proposition that each obligation is equally relevant to the right in question and that the state has primary and secondary roles in protecting human rights.\n\n168. Counsel submitted that the state has failed to protect the LGBTIQ community by enforcing the impugned provisions, which criminalize same sex conduct and that the enforcement encourages discrimination and stigma among the gay community. He agreed with the Petitioners’ counsel’s submissions that the impugned provisions are obsolete having been abolished in Britain, and therefore they should be abolished in Kenya. He argued that the impugned provisions violate the right to inherent dignity guaranteed under Article 28 and recognized in the UN Charter, ICCPR and ICESCR. On what dignity entails, he cited Egan v. Canada[85] where the Court associated dignity with an individual’s autonomy of his free will, freedom of choice and value as a person.\n\n169. Counsel relied on Francis Coralle Mullin v Administrator, Union Territory of Delhi and Others[86] where the Court emphasized, inter alia, that any act that impairs human dignity is a deprivation of the right to live. He also relied on Law v Canada (Ministry of Employment and Immigration)[87] and argued that dignity entails self-respect and self-worth and that dignity is violated when individuals or groups are marginalized, harmed, or devalued.\n\n170. On Equality and Freedom from Discrimination, he cited Article 27 and maintained that the impugned provisions discriminate against homosexuals based on their sexual orientation. He relied on Laurence v Texas[88] in which sodomy Laws were found to be unconstitutional.\n\n171. With regard to Article 29 counsel argued that the Constitution guarantees every person’s right to freedom and security of the person and that criminalizing the relevant conduct amounts to deprivation of the very right.\n\n172. On the right to privacy, he argued that the right to privacy entails not having any information regarding an individual’s private affairs revealed. He relied on Thornburgh v American College of O and G [89] and Roe v Wade[90] where the court recognized the right to privacy, though not expressly provided for in the US Constitution.\n\n173. Regarding Article 43 of the Constitution and Article 12 of ICESCR, counsel argued that criminalizing same sex conduct hampers the right to health, in that homosexuals fear persecution and avoid seeking healthcare services. In addition, he argued, it impedes the fight against HIV/AIDS and its programs. He relied on a research[91] which found that the Female Sex Workers (FSW) and Male Sex Workers (MSW) experience stigma from the community and were, therefore, likely to delay accessing health services.\n\n174. He agreed with the Petitioners’ submissions that the limitations created by the impugned provisions do not meet the test in Article 24(1). On the proportionality test, he relied on State v Makwanyane & Another (supra) and The Queen v. The Oaks.[92]\n\nThe 8th Interested Party’s Submissions\n\n175. Counsel for the 8th Interested Party submitted in support of the Petition, that criminalizing same-sex sexual conduct is prejudicial to MSM who sometimes have unprotected anal sex, thereby enhancing their chances of contracting HIV/AIDS and STI’s and that due to fear of prosecution, fail to access treatment.\n\n176. Her submissions were in tandem with those of the Petitioners in every respect including the authorities relied on mainly focusing the right to health under Article 43. She referred to a document from the Ministry of Health titled “Kenya AIDS Response Progress Report 2016” which acknowledges the health risk of the people living with HID/AIDS.\n\nThe Respondent’s submissions\n\n177. Counsel for the Respondent submitted in opposition to the Petition. On what constitutes unnatural offence, she relied on the definition in the Black’s Law Dictionary and contended that every other form of sexual act other than what is in the order of nature, capable of producing off springs is unnatural and therefore punishable by law. She cited Khan v Emperor[93]and Fazal Rab Choudhary v State of Bihar[94]and submitted that section 377 of the Indian Penal Code which prohibits carnal knowledge against the order of nature is in near similar terms as the impugned provisions.\n\n178. She added that the impugned sections not only apply to homosexuals but also heterosexuals hence they are not discriminatory. She relied on section 377A of the Indian Penal Code which defines the phrase “against the order of nature” and submitted that in Kenya, what is prohibited under section 162 is carnal knowledge of an animal and acts of anal or oral sex by either homosexuals or heterosexuals. On what indecent practices are, she argued that section 2 of the Sexual Offences Act defines an indecent act and penetration and contended that the anus is a genital organ.\n\n179. On the assertion that the impugned provisions are unconstitutional, she submitted that every statute enjoys a presumption of constitutionality. She relied on Susan Wambui Kaguru v Attorney Gneral & another,[95] Katiba Institute & Another v Attorney General & Another[96] citing US v Butler[97]and Hamdard Dawakhana v Union of India[98] and maintained that the impugned sections are constitutionally sound.\n\n180. With regard to the intention of the impugned provisions, vis a vis Article 45, she submitted that the institution of marriage is an important social pillar that provides security, support and companionship between members of the society and plays important roles, among them, raising children. She urged the court to be guided by the principles in Articles 259(1) as read with Article 10 and find that marriage can only be between a man and a woman. She also relied on Suresh Kumar v NAZ Foundation,[99] where the court observed that section 377A of the Indian Penal Code which criminalized sexual activities against the order of nature did not criminalize a particular people, identity or orientation but rather that the section merely identifies certain acts which if committed, would constitute an offence. She argued that such prohibition regulates sexual conduct regardless of gender identity and orientation.\n\n181. She further submitted that decriminalizing the acts complained of would be tantamount to allowing unnatural offences between people of same gender who may have legitimate expectation to enter into marriage contrary to Article 45 of the Constitution.\n\n182. Regarding morality, counsel submitted that the impugned provisions strive to uphold social values and morals at the family level hence privacy is no excuse in tearing into the social fabric of the Kenyan society. She argued that abortion and same sex marriage were among the contentious issues addressed during the Constitution making process and that family was considered to be a marriage between a man and a woman as stipulated in Article 45(2). She urged the court to interpret the impugned provisions with conservatism in sexual matters, as the Constitution was not designed to put Kenya among the front-runners of liberal democracy in sexual matters.\n\n183. She also submitted that homosexuality is considered despicable and insulting to traditional morality. She relied on Bowers v Hardwick.[100] She also relied on Naz Foundation (India) Trust v Government of NCT of Delhi and others.[101] Counsel also relied on Article 27 of the ACHPR which stipulates that the rights and freedoms of each individual shall be exercised with due regard to the rights of others, collective security, morality and common interests; Articles 17 (3) on the State obligation to promote and protect morals and traditional values recognized by the community; and Article 29(7) on the duty of the State to preserve and strengthen positive African Cultural values and to contribute to the moral well-being of "
