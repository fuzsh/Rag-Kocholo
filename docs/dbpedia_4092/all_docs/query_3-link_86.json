        "text": "The Film Noir Odyssey / The Ida Lupino Odyssey\n\nWriter: Collier Young and Ida Lupino\n\nDirector: Don Siegel\n\nCast: Ida Lupino, Steve Cochran, Howard Duff, Dorothy Malone\n\nCinematography: Burnett Guffey\n\nMusic: Leith Stevens\n\nStudio: The Filmakers\n\nRelease: September 3, 1954\n\nWhen Ida Lupino and then-husband Collier Young formed their production company The Filmakers, they didn’t just want to break the rules of spelling. They wanted to create a series of low-budget productions that tackled serious issues of the day that were not being explored in mainstream films. And they did just that – using (at the time) audacious methods to get money like *gasp* product placement to help fund their vision. The films themselves, all created quickly over the course of six years, vary widely in quality: my favorite is “The Bigamist,” which explores the idea of… wait for it… bigamy. But they also tackle disability (“Never Fear”), rape (“Outrage”), pregnancy out of wedlock (“Not Wanted”), depression & suicide (“On the Loose”) and police corruption (“Private Hell 36”).\n\nWe’re covering that last film today, as we close out our Mini-Odyssey covering Lupino’s career. She always joked that, as a director, she was a poor man’s Don Siegel, so it’s fitting that she’d get Siegel himself to direct her in the Filmakers’ penultimate film before shuttering.\n\nThe movie begins and ends with two shootings involving officer Cal (Steve Cochran) – in the first, he kills a man and, in the second, he is killed. In between, he and his partner Jack (Howard Duff) follow a trail of counterfeiters. When a phony $50 lands at the station after the shooting, they track it back to a lounge singer named Lilli (Lupino), who agrees to help them… and also falls in love with Cal. But after the two men discover a case of stolen money and Cal pockets $80,000 of it, Jack finds himself in a moral quandary about whether to turn his partner in or not.\n\nIf the above sounds super scattered, that’s because it is. “Private Hell 36” is about one hell of a lot of things, but unfortunately none of them ever comes to the fore – you enjoy the movie on a minute-by-minute basis, but when you step back and ask yourself simple questions about the structure, you can’t answer them. Co-writers Lupino and Young create six movies in one, most of them good, but none of them given the space they need to breathe.\n\nThe most interesting sections are the ones centered on Lilli and Cal – Lupino and Cochran have fiery chemistry with one another (this even though Lupino had divorced Collier by that point and was married to Duff offscreen), and you cannot look away when they share the screen together. Lilli gets all the best lines in the movie, and Lupino sells them beautifully – plus we get a reprise of the sing/speaking she did so well in “Road House.” It’s a testament to how good these sections are that you worry about what’s to become of Lilli after Cal dies at the climax.\n\nOf course, the unfortunate thing is that their subplot is the least essential to the film itself. What should be the driving force of the storyline – the men finding that money and the ethical dilemma of what to do with it – happens so late in the running time that it barely gets explored. And what little is explored is boring – Jack just drinks and broods, so boringly a good guy that you start counting the minutes until he tells Cal he’s going to turn him in.\n\nJack is also part of the worst written and performed scene – where he comes home one night and his wife Francey tells him that he has doubts about him being a policeman. It’s such a clam, and was even then, and I feel like I’ve seen 400 versions of it so far on this Odyssey… and even considering that, this is bottom of the barrel. Francey is played by Dorothy Malone, who is clearly an incredible actress, but she’s terrible in that scene, overacting every unbelievable line and putting unnecessary emphasis on nearly every syllable she speaks.\n\nMeanwhile Duff is perfectly acceptable in a role that is completely an afterthought by the screenwriters – Lupino and Cochran blow him offscreen in every one of their scenes.\n\nThough his work with the actors is hit and miss, Siegel (“The Lineup”) unsurprisingly does a workmanlike job handling the directing from a visual standpoint. The movie was clearly low, low budget, so the filmmakers were very smart to hire noir superstar Burnett Guffey (“In a Lonely Place”) to enhance their standard sets and sequences. And Guffey does just that, turning the boring looking trailer park at the center of the story into a labyrinth of shadows and doom.\n\nHowever unfocused “Private Hell 36” ultimately feels, it’s still a worthwhile watch for Lupino and Cochran. Though I’m hot and cold on her feature work as a director, I love that she got the opportunity to tell these important stories on her own terms… and in the process take a huge step forward for female directors. As an actor in noir, Lupino’s performances are almost unparalleled in diversity and quality: she helped to create the femme fatale with “They Drive By Night” and never looked back. She also gave two of my all-time favorite noir performances, in my beloved “Ladies in Retirement” and “Road House.”\n\nSimply put, Lupino is a legend. All hail one of the queens of noir.\n\nScore: ***\n\nThe Film Noir Odyssey\n\nWriter: Gerald Drayson Adams and Daniel Mainwaring\n\nBased on the short story “The Road to Carmichael’s” by Richard Wormser\n\nDirector: Don Siegel\n\nCast: Robert Mitchum, Jane Greer, William Bendix\n\nCinematography: Harry J. Wild\n\nMusic: Leigh Harline\n\nRelease: July 1, 1949\n\nStudio: RKO\n\n“The Big Steal” is a joy to watch.\n\nWhen I queued it up and saw that it was set in Mexico, I immediately sighed. Films from this timeframe (and long after) generally have been very cringe-inducing when looked at from a modern perspective. I figured that the best-case scenario was going to be brownface and lots of stereotypes. Worst-case scenario is an entire culture are treated as savages in addition to the above.\n\nImagine my genuine surprise that the film has none of those things. I believe it was shot fully on location in Mexico, embraces the culture, allows its Mexican characters to be the smartest people in the room and – unless I completely misread something – has not a single actor in brownface. What a breath of fresh air!\n\nThe fact that the rest of the movie is great is a perfect bonus.\n\nRobert Mitchum stars as Duke Halliday, who is an army lieutenant robbed of $300,000 in payroll by Jim (Patric Knowles) and follows him into Mexico to get the money back. Halliday is pursued by Captain Blake (William Bendix), who thinks Halliday stole the money for himself. Into the mess walks Joan (Jane Greer), who was engaged to Jim before he stole $2000 from her bank account, and now she’s also in Mexico to get it back. Halliday and Joan team up to get their respective monies back, resulting in a cross-country road trip, except one with guns, bruises and a couple dead bodies.\n\nThe film is probably most remembered as a re-teaming of Mitchum and Greer after their pairing in the iconic masterpiece “Out of the Past.” Comparisons are inevitable, and this is a shame, because “The Big Steal” is such a different, lighter, brighter film… and because comparing a relatively “happy” movie to perhaps the most iconic, depressing film noir of all time will leave critics siding with the “deep” movie time after time. And yet, here “The Big Steal” sits, wanting so much to engage you and make you smile, no matter what shadows from other films envelop it.\n\nDon Siegal (“Invasion of the Body Snatchers”) directed, and is not the type of filmmaker associated with this type of caper film. But he creates the world with such a light touch that you wish he would have done movies like this more often. He allows his location work to do all the talking in several scenes – from breakneck chases down the Mexican countryside that end when Halliday herds a bunch of goats into the road (!) to a gorgeous vacation spot where the swimming hole has hundreds-if-not-thousands of flower petals floating in the water. I cannot underline this enough – thanks to Siegal, the film is a love letter to a country so wrongly maligned in most American films for nearly a century. Bravo, sir.\n\nThe screenplay is also eager to twist stereotypes into something fresh. Written by Gerald Drayson Adams (“Armored Car Robbery”) and Daniel Mainwaring (“The Phenix City Story”), it is never more so evident in the character of Inspector General Ortega (Ramon Novarro). He speaks in broken English, setting specific expectations for the audience, but is consistently four steps ahead of all the main characters, and in the film’s finale, the protagonist essentially steps aside so Ortega can monologue about his plan.\n\nI feel like this article is turning into me just being shocked and praising a movie for not being super racist, which is a little unfair to the quality of the film itself. “The Big Steal” doesn’t make a big deal about any of the above things… it’s more concerned in enveloping you in its fun, twisted narrative. For a movie which is ostensibly one long chase sequence, the writers manage to craft a lot of cool twists for its characters, from mistaken identities to Blake’s true motivation reveal in the third act. Other small details that could be giant McGuffins in other films (where the money is hidden, for example) are simply details in the background that, when revealed (Jim hid the cash in the tires!), make you appreciate how smart they are.\n\nMitchum would go on to send up the noir genre once again in 1951’s classic “His Kind of Woman,” which this is in many ways a rehearsal for. He seems to be having a blast in every scene, his chemistry with Greer sparkling once more (though in a completely different way). Greer also seems to be relishing such a playful character, and Joan’s banter with Halliday left me smiling whenever they were in a room, or car, together. Bendix doesn’t have much to do except look frustrated, but when he finally gets the spotlight in the third act, he makes it count. Novarro and Knowles are lesser known to me, but provide excellent supporting work throughout.\n\nI also love that the movie doesn’t run out of gas (sorry) in the third act. Chase movies in general begin to stumble when their characters finally reach their destination, but that is not the case here. The aforementioned twists concerning character motivations keeps things fresh, and I love the extra care taken sketching the “money man,” who cares more about his ancient artifacts than he does the money. It’s also the only part of the movie that really exploits those classic noir shadows (shout out to cinematographer Harry J. Wild, who lensed “Murder, My Sweet”), and boy does it do that well for the climactic sequence.\n\n“The Big Steal” is one of those great films that is ripe for rediscovery and re-evaluation. It’s aged much, much better than most comparable noir films… and is also just a damn good movie. If you’ve never had the opportunity, it’s worth taking the time to seek it out. It’ll make you smile.\n\nScore: *****\n\nThe Film Noir Odyssey\n\nWriter: Gene L. Coon\n\nBased on the short story by Ernest Hemingway\n\nDirector: Don Siegel\n\nCast: Lee Marvin, Clu Gulager, John Cassavetes, Angie Dickinson, Ronald Reagan\n\nCinematography: Richard L. Rawlings\n\nMusic: John Williams\n\nStudio: Universal\n\nRelease: July 7, 1964\n\nI’ve already written at length about Don Siegel’s “The Gun Runners,” a little-remembered film today which is an adaptation of Ernest Hemingway’s “To Have and Have Not.” That story had already been made twice into the minor classics “To Have and Have Not” and “The Breaking Point,” and by the time Siegel got to it, there was little left for him to say about the material. It was a workmanlike film, but nothing more.\n\nAnd now we have “The Killers,” in which Siegel once again adapts Hemingway, and it’s once again following in the footsteps of a prior adaptation, this one a masterpiece 1946 version by Robert Siodmak, which put both Burt Lancaster and Ava Gardener on the map. Siegel was famously supposed to direct the 1946 version, but was let go for vague reasons. Finally, he would have the chance to tell the story his way – the film was shot to be a television movie but released in theaters after it was clear that the content was too violent for primetime.\n\nI really wish that it was better.\n\nIt’s never a good sign when the background story to your movie is more interesting than the movie itself. And yet that’s what we have here. The problems with “The Killers” are different than the ones Siegel encountered with “The Gun Runners” – the original Hemingway short story in this case only accounts for the first 10-ish minutes of both films, after which they go off in incredibly different directions.\n\nHere, two killers-for-hire (Lee Marvin and Clu Gulager) track down a man named Johnny (John Cassavetes) in a school for the blind and brutally murder him. But Johnny does not seem surprised when they show up… and he doesn’t seem upset either. This seems odd considering he was supposed to have stolen millions of dollars – why was he at a blind school? The Killers begins to retrace Johnny’s steps, happening upon a femme fatale named Shelia (Angie Dickinson) and a man with mafia connections named Jack (Ronald Reagan). But who has the money?\n\nIt feels almost unfair to compare the two adaptations, especially since the 1946 version was a beautiful meditation on the slow loss of humanity that could be spoken of in the same breath as “Citizen Kane” thanks to its broken time narrative. This version has no aspirations for high art… it wants to spray blood all over the place and impact you with its violence, not its narrative. Which is a perfectly legitimate choice, until you see that this film also has a broken flashback structure without any of the elegance of the original, and you just begin to wait until the climactic bullets begin to fly.\n\nPerhaps the best way to sum up the movie is “functional.” Take that as you will.\n\nThere are certainly some nifty parts throughout – I especially enjoyed the opening sequence in the blind school and two car chase scenes that are so over-the-top and unreal with their rear projection that they come off almost like German Expressionism. I have to believe that, despite the television movie auspices, Siegel meant for them to appear as cheap and wild as they seem onscreen.\n\nThat said, the finale is probably the best sequence in the film, where what surviving characters are left come together to soak every square inch of lawn and carpet in a house with blood. It’s a hugely explosive ending, one which underlines the theme that nothing really matters and we’re all gonna die. That sounds one hell of a lot like noir to me, no?\n\nWriter Gene L. Coon is incredibly (incredibly!) prolific in television, penning episodes of “Star Trek” to “Wagon Train” to “Suspicion” to everything in between. He is very good with creating a shorthand between his ensemble and introducing them in blunt, memorable ways. I actually think his screenplay is probably better than the film that was ultimately shot.\n\nThe ensemble cast has a few standouts, particularly Marvin and Dickinson. Notably, Dickinson plays up her femme fatale role like she’s been waiting for it her entire life, and hers is the performance you’ll walk away from the film remembering. Marvin is quite good as the last killer standing, and Gulager is also fine even though he has much less to do. Cassavettes is sadly miscast as the doomed Johnny, sharing no chemistry with Dickinson despite her best efforts and giving a performance that is only halfway alive. That said, the camera loves looking at his weirdly handsome face, so there is that.\n\nThe movie is not only shot in color, but has the palate of a Hammer Horror film from the 1950s. This works both against the film and to its advantage. The former in the dialogue scenes on cheap sets where some black-and-white shadows would have done wonders to up the atmosphere. The latter in the aforementioned chase scenes and whenever the camera focuses on all that red, Red, RED blood.\n\n“The Killers” is not a necessary noir. It’s the kind of film that’s excellent to bring up in conversation and talk about it in relation to its predecessor and within Siegel’s filmography… but sitting down and watching it takes away a lot of that interest. It’s a perfectly fine film, but why not watch the original… or any of Siegel’s better movies… first?\n\nScore: **1/2\n\nThe Film Noir Odyssey\n\nWriter: Daniel Mainwaring & Paul Monash\n\nBased on the novel “To Have and Have Not” by Ernest Hemingway\n\nDirector: Don Siegel\n\nCast: Audie Murphy, Eddie Albert, Patricia Owens\n\nCinematography: Hal Mohr\n\nMusic: Leith Stevens\n\nRelease: September 17, 1958\n\nStudio: Seven Arts Productions/United Artists\n\n“The Gun Runners” represents the end to the unofficial trilogy of films based on the novel “To Have and Have Not” by Ernest Hemingway. The first was Howard Hawks’ “To Have and Have Not,” the second was Michael Curtiz’s “The Breaking Point,” and now we have Don Siegal’s “The Gun Runners.” I would be remiss if I didn’t mention that there was a very, very, very loose (like they didn’t even get the rights) adaptation in 1956 whose title is a racial slur I will not be repeating here. I won’t be covering that one.\n\nEach adaptation was created by one of the most impactful directors of all time which, when you think about it, is bananas crazy. Your most classic novels, your most-adapted works… they don’t have this distinction. Hawks’ credits include “Bringing Up Baby,” “The Big Sleep” and “The Thing From Another World,” among many other classics. Curtiz directed “Casablanca,” “White Christmas” and “Mildred Pierce.” And now we have Siegal entering stage right, with “Invasion of the Body Snatchers,” “Dirty Harry” and “Escape From Alcatraz” under his belt.\n\nThe book is, as previously stated in my earlier articles on the films, terrible. Hawks told Hemingway as much before he got the rights for it. And yet each of these filmmakers have found a way to make the plodding, racist, confused novel into something worthwhile. Siegal disliked his adaptation, claiming to have only done it for the money… and it’s always difficult for someone to argue for the quality of a movie when its creator has dismissed it.\n\nThat said, I find myself enjoying “The Gun Runners” just fine. It’s by far the least of the three adaptations, but it’s also probably the adaptation that the trash novel deserved, if that makes any sense. Lean, mean and clocking in at 83 minutes, it has little interest in crafting deep thematic statements on life, America or rich vs. poor – the things Hemingway struggled to convey in his text. Instead, it just wants to entertain with shootouts, shirtless dudes and nasty villains. On that count, it succeeds.\n\nAudie Murphy plays Sam, a fisherman married to Lucy (Patricia Owens) who is always on the verge of bankruptcy. After he and his first mate, Harvey (Everett Sloane) are stiffed for almost a thousand dollars when the guy who owes them money is arrested for check fraud, Sam makes the wrong choice in letting the obviously evil Hanagan (Eddie Albert) hire the boat to take him to Cuba for a night. Before you know it, Sam is illegally running guns for the Cuban revolution at Hanagan’s behest… whether he likes it or not.\n\nThe screenplay is by Paul Monash, who penned the first episode of the iconic “Untouchables” television show, and noir superstar Daniel Mainwaring (“The Phenix City Story”), and it fixes some of the problems of earlier adaptations. Because it is much shorter and to the point, it takes away a bunch of the pacing problems of the more meandering “The Breaking Point.” It also features the best variation of the first mate character, here named Harvey, who selflessly smuggles himself aboard Sam’s ship in the third act instead of getting drunk because he promised Lucy he’d take care of Sam.\n\nBut even with those fixes, there are still a bunch of problems with the screenplay. It honestly feels like something cobbled together in a weekend and then not given a second draft before they went to shoot it. Because Monash and Mainwaring are great writers, they pull it off well enough, but the issues are clear and obvious. First and foremost, we don’t get any hints as to why keeping his boat is so important to Sam until almost an hour into the running time… and even then it’s not well articulated or all that emotional. The actual scheme that the entire second half of the movie is based around has a myriad of plot holes that are ignored because the writers want to create surprising twists. And they also seem adrift (heh) with the finale – allowing Sam to be shot in the chest (!?) but also appearing to recover almost instantly enough to be able to drive home? Either kill the guy off or just graze his arm with the bullet – you can’t have it both ways.\n\nMurphy is miscast as Sam – he’s too much of a tough guy for a role where you need to read his desperation. Also, unfortunately, he doesn’t have much chemistry with Owens, which hurts those intimate scenes. That said, he does what he can with the part, and nails several of his scenes with Albert. Speaking of Albert… damn he all but walks away with the movie. He’s so good at creating a mood of tension in all of his scenes – will he lose his shit or just stay calm?\n\nSiegal directs things with his usual stripped-down methods, which works beautifully in places but feels awkward in others. The opening moments, where Sam is walking to his boat and is waylaid by two heavies who were literally hiding behind a pole waiting for him (there’s even a dirge-y musical sting for good measure) is almost laughably staged. Other moments, especially when Siegal needs to build tension slowly, are much better. It also struck me that it’s very difficult to make the boat sequences which take up the entire final third of the film, very atmospheric. Cinematographer Hal Mohr (“The Lineup”) tries hard, but it’s very obvious what is on a stage and what is on location (spoiler: very little). Looking back, the boat stuff is the least effective from a visual standpoint in all three movies – you remember the hotel in “To Have and Have Not” and the bar in “The Breaking Point” much more than anything on the ship.\n\nI like “The Gun Runners,” and if it were the only version of this story I’d be able to walk away from it without a second thought. It’s by far the least of the three adaptations, but that doesn’t mean it’s bad. Looking back, I’m not surprised that the best of these three films, “To Have and Have Not,” is the adaptation with least connection to the original novel. But all three are worthwhile in their own ways, and a testament to the talents of their creators.\n\nScore: ***\n\nThe Film Noir Odyssey\n\nWriter: Peter Milne\n\nBased on the novel “The Big Bow Mystery” by Israel Zangwill\n\nDirector: Don Siegel\n\nCast: Sydney Greenstreet, Peter Lorre, George Coulouris\n\nCinematography: Ernest Haller\n\nMusic: Frederick Hollander\n\nStudio: Warner Bros.\n\nRelease: November 23, 1946\n\n“The Verdict” is the type of movie that you’ll remember as being better than it actually is. You’ll think of the fantastic cast, great premise, awesome twist and beautiful period photography that seem to add up to a grand old time at the movies. And it does… kinda sorta. But every scene and sequence is hindered thanks to some truly atrocious dialogue, which weigh down the proceedings immensely every time the movie is about to take off.\n\nThe year is 1890, and George (Sydney Greenstreet) is a disgraced police superintendent in England after accidentally allowing an innocent man to be executed. Replaced by the pompous John (George Coulouris), George nevertheless helps out with the investigation when a man on his block is brutally murdered in his locked bedroom one night. The suspects are many, including Victor (Peter Lorre), another tenant in the house where the man died and an illustrator of all things macabre.\n\nYou’ve got a great set-up and you’ve got an awesome main character. And yet everything that comes out of his mouth… or the mouths of any of the ensemble… is so bad. Greenstreet is a fantastic actor, and he gives a good performance here, but you can see him struggling to sell the dialogue in certain moments. Take the opening scene, where George walks into his office to learn that the man he just sent to the gallows was innocent. After being told what he had done, the scene weirdly segues into a four-minute discussion of the entire case before any character actually says specifically what new evidence has come forward. Everyone in that room knows the information they are speaking, and are only saying it for the benefit of the audience. It’s one of my biggest pet peeves as a filmgoer, and in this movie that happens a lot.\n\nThe movie was written by Peter Milne (“The House of Fear”), and every scene has some sort of problem like that. Victor just sits around, waiting for his character’s function in the plot to begin. People over-explain things that could be shown in a simple visual cue. When Scotland Yard interrogations take place, no obvious follow-up question are asked even though any logical human being would ask them. It’s kind of stunning to see this many dialogue problems plaguing an otherwise well-executed movie.\n\nBecause, make no mistake, it’s all dialogue. If you separate them from the words they say, all the characters are interesting (except the landlady, who we’ll get to in a bit). Structurally, it works too. The twists that need to happen are well set-up and the finale reveal is quite the stunner. It’s just those lousy words.\n\nThis was Don Siegel’s (“Invasion of the Body Snatchers”) first full feature, and in all probability had quite a low budget. But you wouldn’t know it from looking at the movie – it looks quite high budget, which is even more impressive considering it’s a period film. Siegel starts things off well with an evocative special effect moment revealing 1890s London, which tricks the viewer into thinking things are more expensive than they are. And though the action is mostly contained to half a city block, one completely drenched in fog, Siegel finds every opportunity to show off when the characters visit somewhere like a theater. And the homes themselves, specifically the boarding house where the murder takes place, are beautifully rendered thanks to Siegel’s collaboration with cinematographer Ernest Haller (“Mildred Pierce”). In other words, every bit of this succeeds at doing a lot with a little.\n\nGreenstreet is, as previously mentioned, very good as George… especially in the final sequence after all the cards have been put on the table. For someone usually cast as a second banana, it’s nice to see him commanding an entire film. Lorre doesn’t have much to do in the first half, but makes the most of his role once we understand why his character is in the film. The rest of the cast turn in professional work… though I was fucking annoyed with Rosalind Ivan as the owner of the boarding house where the murder takes place. She screams and wails, then screams and wails some more… obviously supposed to be comic relief but so annoying she pulls down most of her scenes. I don’t blame Ivan – I blame her dialogue and that Milne has her screaming as much as he has her speaking.\n\nAlso props to the composers behind the song that is featured twice in the film – it’s a total earworm and I found myself humming it hours later.\n\nI didn’t have a great time while I was watching “The Verdict,” but even now… it’s only a day later when I am writing this article… I am remembering it as being better than it was. It’s easy to focus on what works, and there is plenty that works here. But I wish that the dialogue had come from someone with a real handle on storytelling and how to use exposition well. Had that happened, this could have been something really special. But as it stands, it only gets the most marginal of recommendations from me.\n\nScore: **1/2\n\nThe Film Noir Odyssey\n\nWriter: Doane R. Hoag and Karen DeWolf\n\nStory: Doane R. Hoag\n\nDirector: Don Siegel\n\nCast: Macdonald Carey, Teresa Wright, John Craven\n\nCinematography: John Alton\n\nMusic: Louis Forbes\n\nStudio: RKO\n\nRelease: April 1, 1953\n\nThere are a few things to like in “Count the Hours” and many things I really wanted to like… but the execution is lacking. If you told me the premise of this film and that is was directed by Don Seigel and shot by John Alton, I would buy my front row ticket for opening night. And yet, time and again, it frustrates when it should soar.\n\nThe film begins with a brutal break-in and shooting of a husband and wife on a rural farm. The next day, the live-in workers George (John Craven) and Ellen (Theresa Wright) do everything possible wrong when the police arrive and, before you know it, George is arrested for murder. His defense attorney is Doug (Macdonald Carey), who is immediately spurned by the community for daring to defend a man who everyone assumes is the murderer. After a guilty verdict, George is sentenced to death and Doug scrambles to clear his name before he is hung.\n\nThis is a good premise. There’s a little bit of “In Cold Blood” mixed with “Witness for the Prosecution” here, both of which are great touchstone films and stories. And yet with every step of the execution, something goes wrong. Add in the myriad (myriad!) of plot holes caused simply because every single person in town is incapable of asking follow-up questions and you’ve got an annoying narrative.\n\nIn the first place, Ellen is such a dummy that it’s difficult to summon up any sympathy for her. After the bodies are found, she lies repeatedly to the police. She hides her husband’s gun in the sock she is knitting. And then runs to the nearest lake and pitches the gun into it right in front of a police officer. She doesn’t tell the officers interrogating her that she is pregnant. Later when the gun is discovered in the lake, the barrel has rusted so the police can’t tell if it was the murder weapon. I mean, it’s one fucking stupid decision after the other. When a character says that she blames herself for what her husband is going through, my mental response was “Yes. She should. It is entirely her fault he is in this position and if he dies, it is on her.”\n\nDoug fares a little better in the smarts department, though even he stumbles thanks to the sometimes inane screenplay by Doane R. Hoag (something called, I’m not kidding, “Hideous Sun Demons”) and Karen DeWolf (“Johnny Allegro”). At one point Doug walks in on Ellen about to be raped, beats off the guy and then they immediately have a conversation like nothing happened instead of calling the police to report a sexual assault.\n\nThe movie also stumbles in its portrayal of Doug’s nemesis, district attorney Jim Gillespie (Edgar Barrier). The screenwriters try to have it both ways – he’s an oily, corrupt D.A. who will do anything necessary to win his case… but he’s also a good man who fully investigated what is going on. At one point after Doug finds the obviously guilty man and Jim tears apart the confession in court, Jim talk to Doug about how much follow-up they did on the guy. He sounds well-spoken and like a good guy. Later when we learn the piece of information that can save George, we realize that if Jim had asked a single (1) follow-up question to the witness then the movie would have been over four reels ago.\n\nThere’s also the annoying tidy ending. The killer is caught, and the film wraps everything up before the cars even pull out of the driveway! George is gonna be let free (we don’t see this), Ellen can feel relief (we don’t see this) and the D.A. says everyone in town will love Doug again (we don’t see this). What do we see instead? Doug’s awful ex-fiance Paula (Dolores Moran), who left him when things got rough, roll up in her car and offers to become his ex-ex-fiance. And Doug takes her back… apparently because he has no respect for himself. Fade out. Gag.\n\nNone of the many character actors filling the screen leave anything close to an impact with their performances… with the exception of Adele Mara, who has an extended cameo as the low-class girlfriend of the killer. Every scene she’s in is hilarious, and I love the way she diffuses a near fight by saying “Come on, let’s go home and I’ll cook you a can o’ beans.”\n\nSiegal (“Invasion of the Body Snatchers”) creates a great mood for the film, especially concerning his collaboration with film noir all-timer MVP cinematographer John Alton (“He Walked By Night”). That opening break-in and double murder is the high point of the film, with the blacks of the night stunning to behold. Later sequences in the local jail and a bar are brilliant as well.\n\nThat said, as pretty as the movie is, this is one film noir you can easily skip without missing anything. There’s a good movie lost somewhere in the muck, but it’s not worth your time or effort to try to find it.\n\nScore: **\n\nThe Film Noir Odyssey\n\nWriter: Daniel Mainwaring\n\nBased on the novel “The Body Snatchers” by Jack Finney\n\nDirector: Don Siegel\n\nCast: Kevin McCarthy, Dana Wynter, Larry Gates\n\nCinematography: Ellsworth Fredericks\n\nMusic: Carmen Dragon\n\nRelease: February 5, 1956\n\nStudio: Allied Artists Pictures\n\nPercent Noir: 60%\n\nAlthough very obviously not a film noir, scholars and critics who are otherwise incredibly picky about what they classify as “true” noir seem to happily bend over backwards to make an exception for the original “Invasion of the Body Snatchers.” They fudge their strict rules because of the shadows, because of the paranoia, because of Director Don Siegal. And hey, those self-imposed restrictions that people want to create on a genre whose definitions and qualities can be as grey as the palette in these films has always been quite annoying to me. Let a person define art however they want to. To me, I keep it vague and broad… I know film noir when I see it. And this film doesn’t strike me as noir, sorry. But I would be a hypocrite if I wrote what I just wrote and then excluded it from my Odyssey, since so many people do. Plus, I wanted an excuse to watch it, so here we go.\n\nWhen a ranting man named Miles (Kevin McCarthy) is brought into a hospital, a psychiatrist sits down with him to listen to his crazy story of pod people and humans who aren’t quite human. Miles insists he’s a doctor, and we jump to flashback where he tells of his return to the small town of Santa Mira. A piece of advice – if you don’t want to sound crazy, you probably shouldn’t start your story with the phrase “something evil had taken the possession of the town.” Miles soon realizes things is off, though, when several patients and friends complain that their loved ones… aren’t their loved ones. Something is different about them.\n\nScreenwriter Daniel Mainwaring (“The Big Steal” and the novel upon which “Out of the Past” is based) very smartly has the first person we encounter who feels this way be a hysterical young boy. Miles almost hits the boy with his car, and then his grandmother brings him, kicking and screaming, into the doctor’s office. We can sense his innocence and how he feels something within his very soul, but adults won’t listen to him… dooming him as a result. There are shades of the excellent scene in “The Window” where that boy is being kidnapped but the police won’t believe him because his “parents” vouch for him.\n\nAnyway, a local psychologist Kauffman (Larry Gates) says it’s some sort of mass hysteria. But soon Miles, his token useless girlfriend Becky (Dana Wynter) and his friends start finding half-formed bodies with no fingerprints. As if that wasn’t creepy enough, giant plants (grown from enormous seed pods) are popping out identical bodies to our main cast – and the fact that they resemble Audrey II from “Little Shop of Horrors” doesn’t help matters either. Who can Miles trust?\n\nThe first half of the movie is near perfect in style and execution. Director Siegal (“Riot in Cell Block 11”) does a fantastic job of setting the scene and slowly tightening the noose around viewers’ necks. While the frame story, which was added against Siegal’s wishes because executives wanted a happier ending, isn’t as beloved as the rest of the movie, I believe it does a good job of adding to the suspense… at least at the beginning. What made this man, who seems perfectly happy and normal, so insane – and what happened to all the people he loves?\n\nWhereas the first half feels like a well-oiled machine, “Body Snatchers” begins to stumble somewhat in its second half as it struggles with the rules of its own mythology, its characters and logic in general. None of them separately or combined are enough to break the film, but you just wish that a few small tweaks were made here or there to make things as great as it could be. This is most clear in a long sequence where Miles and Becky are caught by the pod people in his office. Are they strapped down until they fall asleep? Knocked unconscious? No. The pod people simply set down some pods and then exit the room, content to leave their hostages in an unlocked space filled with a myriad of weapons. Yikes.\n\nIt’s around this point that Becky becomes, quite simply, stupid. She adds so little to the movie that she may as well be a potato sack Miles must carry around. After doing almost nothing during the break out but stand there and look tense while Miles is almost beaten to death, he drags her across the town and into the desert as she complains and Complains and COMPLAINS. By the time she’s replaced by a pod person, you’re just happy she’s not gonna moan anymore. It’s a shame – Wynter is a charming actress and could handle a meatier role.\n\nAbout that twist of her being replaced… I struggle with the logic in it. It seems like, for just this moment, the rules change and a two-minute nap made her mentally change without being replaced. I find it hard to buy that there was a pod in the middle of an abandoned cave, and none of the many people running in earlier seemed to be carrying one. So what happened?\n\nAgain, these annoyances annoy more than usual simply because the movie is so otherwise excellent. McCarthy is great in his earlier, charming persona and as the raving lunatic near the end… shades of William Shatner in a complimentary way. The rest of the supporting cast are aces as well. Siegal is a great craftsman and sets his mood with cinematographer Ellsworth Fredericks quite well. The reveal of the exploding pods is quite the set piece.\n\nAnd that central premise lingers with you long after the film ends. What if your loved ones… the people you know and trust most… aren’t who they say they are? Luckily, the filmmakers execution of the premise is mostly excellent, and as a result we have a classic science fiction film that still feels fresh and terrifying today.\n\nScore: ****1/2\n\nThe Film Noir Odyssey\n\nWriter: Stirling Silliphant\n\nBased on: “The Lineup” CBS Television Series\n\nDirector: Don Siegel\n\nCinematographer: Hal Mohr\n\nMusic: Mischa Bakaleinikoff\n\nCast: Eli Wallach, Robert Keith, Richard Jaeckel, Warner Anderson\n\nRelease: June 1, 1958\n\nStudio: Columbia Pictures\n\nPercent Noir: 40%\n\nBy 1958 the “classic” era of film noir was over – low-budget crime stories seemed a better fit on television than for the big screen, which was using Cinemascope! Vistavision! and the like to combat audiences’ desires to do a very early version of Netflix and chill. Then someone at Columbia Pictures got the idea to do a feature adaptation of the CBS crime series “The Lineup” as a way to get audiences to head back to theaters. These types of adaptations have had varying degrees of success, but producers were on the right track when they hired the ace team of Don Siegal and Stirling Silliphant to direct and pen the adaptation.\n\nShipments of heroin are being transported into San Francisco’s port by unknowing civilians in items like dolls, statues and silverware. Stone cold killers/partners Dancer (Eli Wallach) and Julian (Robert Keith) are driven around the city by McLain (Richard Jaeckel) to retrieve the heroin from the unsuspecting people… no matter what. Meanwhile, Detective Lieutenant Guthrie (Warner Anderson, reprising his role from the television series) is hot on their tracks.\n\nThe movie reflected a growing trend in ‘50s noir, which was to move out of the cramped, venetian blind-filled rooms. Instead we were outside, usually in big cities and often during the day. Location shooting was fairly cheap and provided a different, but just as distinct, atmosphere to underline crime stories. Some use the phrase “semi-documentary style,” which I personally hate because the movies are still very stylized in content. The move outside resulted in some tremendous films, like “Panic in the Streets,” “Kiss of Death” and, yes, “The Lineup.” The filmmakers were obviously told to make this movie seem “bigger” than anything that could be presented in the series (the poster comes with the tagline “Too hot…too big…for TV!”, and as a result the film is bathed in sun and filled with great location work. This works in the film’s favor – there’s something unnerving about all these horrible actions taking place in a crowded place during the day.\n\nSiegel and Silliphant tell a great crime story, but there’s another layer to “The Lineup” that pays direct homage to the many great films noir that preceded it. The duo obviously didn’t know about “noir” yet, but were very consciously channeling their favorite crime films, from the aquarium scene in “The Lady From Shanghai” to the wheelchair-bound boss who takes a spill similar to “Kiss of Death.” Because the movie is so good, it transcends these lifts and works as its own thing. I’m going to make an odd leap here, but go with me. This feels like a very early iteration of a Quentin Tarantino movie.\n\nI know, I know. But think about it. Aside from the aforementioned nods to other crime flicks, Silliphant and Siegel are obsessed with the development of their trio of villains. Once they are introduced at the twenty minute mark, they all but take over the movie. And Silliphant crafts plenty of sick humor to the trio – for example, Julian is obsessed with knowing the final words minor characters say before Dancer murders them. They are given a more interesting dynamic and are crafted with more care than almost any other comparable noir villains, and that clever balance of humor and horror is what makes the film extraordinary.\n\nThere is also, of course, the none-too-subtle implication that Dancer and Julian are a gay couple in addition to their crime partnership. Homosexual overtones are nothing new in noir, just look at movies like “Gilda” and “The Maltese Falcon,” but this is the most overt instance I’ve ever seen (for the record, I’ve never seen “Desert Fury”). In case we don’t get it from the way Julian lovingly stares after Dancer when he goes to find out who to kill, Silliphant sets one of the major set-pieces in a sauna. As Dancer strips down to go inside, Julian warns him “Don’t stay in too long. It opens the pores.” And once inside the sauna with his mark (William Leslie, the only classically handsome actor in the entire film), Dancer pulls his gun out of his towel and plugs the mark right in his naked stomach. Um, we get it, guys. And I, for one, love it.\n\nSilliphant injects the entire film with crackerjack, memorable dialogue and situations that feel a bit tilted from reality in the best way possible. One of the first lines in the movie is when Guthrie is questioning a suspect and the suspect laments meeting him in such “unfortunate circumstances.” Without missing a beat, Guthrie spits “We meet a lot of people under unfortunate circumstances” and gets back to questioning. Then there are the small beats, like the fact that a girl used the heroin to powder her geisha doll’s cheeks, or the fact that the guy in the wheelchair who falls a good two stories lands on an innocent ice-skater. Whoopsies. This shouldn’t be surprising – Silliphant is one of the best screenwriters in the history of the biz. He wrote great (“Village of the Damned”) movies (“The Poseidon Adventure”) in diverse (“In the Heat of the Night”) genres (“Nightfall”) as well as some of the best television shows (“Naked City”) you’ve never seen (“Route 66”).\n\nThe climactic chase sequence is stunning. It utilizes rear projection for much of the interior work, but Seigel makes it work beautifully. Compare this rear projection with something like Hitchcock’s “Marnie,” made five years later, and you’ll see how rarely it’s done right. There’s a stunt where the getaway car races up an unfinished bridge and spins out, coming to a stop inches before the edge… and you realize that the moment could not have been faked. A real stunt driver in a real vehicle could have easily tipped over the edge and crashed below.\n\nBringing the entire affair together was Siegel, who also directed the pilot of “The Lineup” television series. Like Silliphant, Siegel is a great director, though not as heralded today as he probably should be. He worked on several great films noir (“The Big Steal” remains one of my favorites), but will always be remembered for his noir/sci-fi mash-up “Invasion of the Body Snatchers,” a movie so great it’s been badly remade five times. He directed many other classic films, but “The Lineup” presents him working at the peak of his powers with partners both behind and in front of the screen who match him in excellence. This is an essential noir.\n\nScore: *****"
