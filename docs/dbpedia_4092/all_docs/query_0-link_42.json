        "text": "The Film Noir Odyssey\n\nWriter: Rip Van Ronkel, Frank Tashlin and John Meredyth Lucas\n\nStory: Rip Van Ronkel and Frank Tashlin\n\nDirector: Michael Curtiz\n\nCast: Carol Ohmart, Tom Tryon, Jody Lawrance, Elaine Stritch\n\nCinematography: Lionel Lindon\n\nMusic: Leith Stevens\n\nStudio: Paramount\n\nRelease: April 4, 1956\n\n“The Scarlet Hour” is the final film noir directed by Michael Curtiz, who previously directed the noir masterpieces “Mildred Pierce” & “The Unsuspected,” the noir almost masterpieces “The Breaking Point” & “Flamingo Road” and the most noir-ish non-noir of all time “Casablanca.” He’s also one of the greatest directors of all time, as evidenced by the above, along with “The Adventures of Robin Hood,” “White Christmas,” “Life With Father,” “The Sea Wolf” and many others. This film is nowhere near the quality of the above – it’s half a good movie, which is only a bad thing when taken within the context of Curtiz’s storied filmography.\n\nThe first half is the good one, and stars Carol Ohmart as Paulie, a rich married woman who is cheating on her husband Ralph (James Gregory) with one of his employees Marsh (Tom Tryon). One night they overhear a trio of roughians formulating a plan to rob a nearby mansion of $350,000 in jewels and gold while its owner is away. And before you can say “femme fatale,” Paulie formulates a plan for her and Marsh to steal the money from the robbers in order to start a new life together. Marsh reluctantly agrees, but what neither realizes is that Ralph is on to them and following her… and accidentally gets murdered when he confronts Paulie during the robbery. Paulie and Marsh get the money, but the thieves get Paulie’s expensive bracelet.\n\nUp until this point, “The Scarlet Hour” is a good-but-not-outstanding noir that manages to infuse that ever present genre theme of fate to dovetail its two storylines beautifully together for a well-executed robbery scene. It’s the second half of the film that falls apart narratively, slowly at first but with ever more speed. With Ralph dead, Paulie inherits all the money for the company… but in the week she and Marsh spend apart waiting for the detectives to stop sniffing around, Marsh falls in love with Ralph’s secretary Kathy (Jody Lawrence). Kathy reforms Marsh, who begins to push away Paulie… who gets crazy jealous and tries to frame Kathy for the murder. Oh, and the thieves track Paulie down for a pay-off to that storyline that is undercooked at best. By the climax, the screenplay doesn’t even seem to understand what it is paying off, culminating in a limp ending that makes you shrug off everything that has come before.\n\nThe film was written by Rip Van Ronkel (“Destination Moon”), Frank Tashlin (“Susan Slept Here”) and John Meredyth Lucas (“Dark City”), clearly not in collaboration. There’s a constant sense that there were three too many drafts of the screenplay, with too many superfluous characters and storylines thrown in that add nothing and hurt the narrative drive. Paulie has a best friend named Phyllis (Elaine Stritch, who repeatedly roasted this film as the worst thing she ever acted in) who is the only person who knows Paulie went to the robbery and is lying to the police for her while also giving helpful advice. We expect that something is going to happen with the character considering the amount of screentime she eats up, especially after she sees one of the bad guys approach Paulie at a pool… but then nothing happens. Her character was clearly added in a later draft of the screenplay without wanting the spine of the story impacted.\n\nThere are many, many other moments and characters like Phyllis, particularly in the second half. But then there are things that are so drawn out that they become incredulous. Look at Paulie’s bracelet – when introduced, she says that its jingling is like a bell so that Ralph can always track her. Later, Ralph discovers the affair by hearing the tinkling when Marsh is on the phone and you think its an excellent payoff. But there are still 12 plot developments to come concerning this bracelet, which takes on more meaning than the earrings in “The Earrings of Madame de…” until its usage is beyond absurd.\n\nThe subpar ensemble doesn’t help matters. Ohmart is done up (purposely or accidentally) to resemble Barbara Stanwyck at the height of her femme fatale status… but she is no Barbara Stanwyck. She shares zero chemistry with the mostly wooden Tryon, and her third act descent into a jealous rage doesn’t connect. Stritch seems to be in a different, funnier film, and Lawrence is bland goodness.\n\nIf Curtiz fumbles with the cast, he exceeds expectations visually. This is one hell of a beautiful noir, crisply lensed by Cinematographer Lionel Lindon (“Alias Nick Beal”). Curtiz and Lindon don’t go out of their way to create astonishing set pieces or hugely impactful moments, but essentially every shot of the movie hits its mark beautifully. This is a beautiful noir, but subtly beautiful, as opposed to Curtiz’ more showy “Mildred Pierce” or “The Unsuspected.”\n\nIs “The Scarlet Hour” worth watching? Yes and no. If you go in without expectations, it’s a good movie until it isn’t. Instead of coming as a climax to Curtiz’s noir output, it feels more like a disposable epilogue – routine and underwhelming in most of the ways the filmmaker so brilliantly excelled in his previous films.\n\nScore: **\n\nThe Film Noir Odyssey\n\nWriter: Eugene Ling\n\nStory: Gerald Drayson Adams and Leo Katcher\n\nDirector: Gordon Douglas\n\nCast: Edmond O’Brien, Mark Stevens, Gale Storm, Donald Buka, Gale Robbins\n\nCinematography: George E. Diskant\n\nMusic: George Duning\n\nStudio: Columbia\n\nRelease: October 15, 1950\n\nThis is my 350th article on the Film Noir Odyssey.\n\nYes, it’s been nearly 7 years at this point and I’m still somehow miraculously writing weekly articles about noir. When I started this project all those years ago, I suspected that I would probably write 100ish articles, wrap everything up in a bow and move on. But the genre had other plans, hiding many masterpieces in the shadows and all but daring me to continue the journey. It has been at times exhausting and at others exhilarating, but I’m happy to remain on it.\n\nIf you’re wondering why I chose a little-known noir called “Between Midnight and Dawn” for my 350th article, the answer is twofold. First, I’ve gotten to most major titles in the genre’s classic period at this point (and probably won’t be covering any more neo-noir moving forward), and I’m purposely saving those few I have not for my final few articles… whenever I reach that point. Lately, I’ve been having a lot of fun digging into these barely remembered films – some are awful, but there have been several diamonds I’ve been delighted to discover.\n\n“Between Midnight and Dawn” is one of them.\n\nEdmond O’Brien and Mark Stevens star as Danny and Rocky, two Los Angeles patrol officers who have become entranced with the new voice on their radio: Kate (Gale Storm). They ask Kate out, but she resists – her father was a beat cop before he was killed on duty, and she does not want to go through the pain and grief her mother did. But the duo slowly win Kate over, and she ends up becoming engaged to Rocky. Concurrently, underworld evil dude Ritchie (Donald Buka) keeps crossing paths with our heroes, and after they arrest him for murder, he swears revenge… no matter what it takes.\n\nFor the first hour (hour!), the film feels much, much more like a romantic comedy than it does a film noir. Not just a romantic comedy, but one of the playfully naughty ones that Ernst Lubitsch used to direct like “Trouble in Paradise” or, specifically, “Design for Living.” The screenplay by Eugene Ling (“Behind Locked Doors”) goes to insane lengths to frame Kate’s character as dating both men. Yes, up until Kate finally chooses Rocky, the only way the movie addresses the relationship between the three characters is as a throuple. Their dialogue crackles, light and comedic… the only other noir film I can even come close to comparing it to is the half noir/half musical “Blues in the Night,” but this is even lighter.\n\nThe subplot concerning Ritchie feels like an afterthought until the incredible car chase set-piece about an hour in. And by that point, the filmmakers have succeeded in making you care deeply about the main trio – all that joy and comedy was to ensure that when the darkness creeps in, it has even more impact because it seems foreign to this world.\n\nWhen the violence comes, it’s rough. You have a sinking feeling that Rocky’s days are numbered when Ritchie escapes from prison, but to be shot in the head in a drive-by, “On Her Majesty’s Secret Service” style, is especially brutal. The film goes to lengths here and in the earlier chase sequence to not sideline Kate – indeed, making her helplessly listen while the two most important people in her life may well die is emotionally shattering. And the climactic set-piece is equally brutal, with way more gore than you’d expect from a film made in 1950.\n\nI run hot and cold with O’Brien, but this is the best performance I’ve seen from him by a wide margin. He works well with the earlier comedic stuff but comes alive as the grieving live wire desperate to avenge his best friend. Stevens is one of the most underrated actors from his generation and is oh-so charismatic here. Further, he sparks crazy chemistry with both O’Brien and Storm. Speaking of Storm (who has, for my money, the best name in Hollywood history), she clearly is having a ball in the early sequences and also nails every emotional beat necessary from her in the final half hour.\n\nThe rest of the ensemble isn’t bad either. Of particular note is Buka, who oozes anger and cockiness – he’s a great villain. And Lora Lee Michel as the young Kathy avoids everything that normally makes me grate against child actors. This was one of Michel’s last films, and her life would be an incredible noir film itself – look it up. Here’s a tease… no one knows whether she is still alive or dead.\n\nGordon Douglas directed films in every genre, including several noir like “Walk a Crooked Mile.” I suspect his experience in other genres was why he could walk this tonal tightrope as beautifully as he does. He also collaborates beautifully with cinematographer and noir superstar George E. Diskant (“The Narrow Margin,” “On Dangerous Ground” and many, many others) to bring Los Angeles to life. The centerpiece chase sequence is simply outstanding – I have no idea what the budget was for the film, but they used every penny incredibly well. It’s one of the best such sequences I’ve seen in noir.\n\nSo why isn’t “Between Midnight and Dawn” considered the classic it absolutely should be by now? It’s hard to say. The logline isn’t exactly gripping in the same way movies like “Leave Her to Heaven” or “D.O.A.” are, which may be part of it. It doesn’t have a Bogie or a Crawford at the forefront, even though the main trio should be well-known to noir afficionados. And Douglas isn’t well remembered today despite his good work over decades. It could be any of the above reasons… or the fact that modern critics seem intent on lumping in neo-noir into all noir, which leaves much less room for classic noir on their thin lists and think pieces written by people who haven’t actually done deep dives into the genre. Whatever the case, this is a wonderful film and one of my favorite discoveries on this Odyssey. Track it down – it’s worth the effort.\n\nScore: *****\n\nThe Film Noir Odyssey\n\nWriter: Frank Gruber\n\nBased on the novel by Eric Ambler\n\nDirector: Jean Negulesco\n\nCast: Peter Lorre, Sydney Greenstreet, Zachary Scott\n\nCinematography: Arthur Edeson\n\nMusic: Adolph Deutsch\n\nStudio: Warner Bros.\n\nRelease: June 23, 1944\n\nMany great noir films have been created about the search for the truth behind a person. “The Killers,” “The Locket” and “The Third Man” come to mind immediately, but despite all of those being great films, they still are outgunned by the masterpiece of masterpieces: “Citizen Kane.” This thematic idea is one director Orson Welles would be obsessed with his entire career – from “Kane” to “Mr. Arkadin” to “The Stranger,” but stop me before I get started.\n\nI’m a big fan of movies like this, and “The Mask of Dimitrios” falls squarely into that subgenre. It never comes close to the excellence of the movies I’ve listed above there, but it is two-thirds of a very good movie. The casting of Zachary Scott as the title character is the major error that the filmmakers make – the guy is out of his depth and never convinces you he’s anything close to a powerful villain. Because of Scott, the movie never achieves greatness. Well, that and the brownface.\n\nDespite bafflingly being billed fourth, Peter Lorre stars as our hero, the awesomely named Cornelius Leyden. He’s a popular mystery writer currently visiting Turkey, and the local police chief is a fan. He tells Cornelius about a body recently discovered bloated on the beach – a master criminal named Dimitrios (Scott). The more Cornelius heard about Dimitrios, the more obsessed he becomes about learning everything about the man, and begins ping-ponging all over the continent to learn more. Into his search steps the mysterious Mr. Peters (Sydney Greenstreet), whose motives remain unknown – at first Cornelius suspects Peters of being a villain, but soon the two become friends. Together and apart, they speak to those who have had their lives destroyed by Dimitrios, slowly realizing that the dead man may not be so dead after all.\n\nAll of the sequences taking place in the present are well done and engaging. Lorre is a perfect match for this type of character, and is paired beautifully with his friend and oft-sparring partner Greenstreet. In one of their first scenes together, Cornelius returns to his hotel room to see Peters has sacked it and is holding a weapon on him. Peters essentially tells Cornelius: “Hey, so I know this looks bad but we’re on the same side. I can’t tell you what exactly is happening or what my motives are, but I need you to travel to other countries for me and trust me. Cool?” As farfetched and silly as that sounds, the dialogue crackles and the two men share such off-the-charts chemistry that you can’t help but go along for the ride.\n\nThe flashback sequences are less successful. The writing is fine throughout, but like any movie told in multiple points-of-view, some are better than others. But despite most of the truth tellers giving good performances, the center simply does not hold because of Scott. I don’t buy his performance when he’s supposed to be charming, nor does he sell being gleefully evil. His best work comes when he’s basically a ghost in the present storyline, but there his character is supposed to be quiet and still – and frankly the make-up and costuming do most of the work there. It’s such a shame – this was Scott’s first movie under contract for Warner Bros., and he would soon darken the door of many other noir films with his wooden personality.\n\nAnd yet despite the flashbacks hurting the pacing of the second and third acts, I still found myself getting emotional as it all dovetailed together in a beautifully rendered climax. Lorre and Peters had done so much heavy lifting with their characters that you are almost screaming at the screen because you don’t want anything bad to happen to either of them. The way they regard one another on the final staircase, both before and after the gun goes off, is hugely impactful.\n\nJean Negulesco was one of the most dependably good directors of the ‘40s and ‘50s, as long as the movie was not named “Titanic.” His “Road House” is one of my favorite noir films ever created, and in the same year he also made the great “Johnny Belinda,” which isn’t noir but contains one of the most terrifying sequences ever placed on film. Here he makes what was clearly a shoestring budget feel like just enough – he didn’t have enough money for major exteriors in all the different cities and countries visited, but still captures the ambiance of the places well… aside from the aforementioned unfortunate brownface. He’s also clearly having a ball with Lorre and Greenstreet, and would soon work with them again in the 1946 noir “Three Strangers.”\n\nIn a way, a movie like “The Mask of Dimitrios” is more frustrating than a straight-up bad movie. This is because all the ingredients were there for greatness but the film just didn’t quite make it. It’s a worthwhile watch for the dynamic duo of Lorre and Greenstreet, but expect you’ll walk away wishing for a little bit more.\n\nScore: ***1/2\n\nThe Film Noir Odyssey\n\nWriter: Garrett Fort and Lester Cole\n\nStory: Brian Marlow and Lester Cole\n\nDirector: Stuart Heisler\n\nCast: Albert Dekker, Harry Carey, Susan Hayward, Frances Farmer\n\nCinematography: Theodor Sparkuhl\n\nMusic: Gerard Carbonara\n\nStudio: Paramount\n\nRelease: December 19, 1941\n\nThis movie is nuts.\n\nYou’d think that most films would save the “your twin brother who you thought was dead is actually a psychotic murderer and has been held captive in your decaying Southern mansion for 20 years” plot development as a major climactic twist… but not “Among the Living.” All that comes out in the first six minutes.\n\nAlbert Dekker plays both the good twin John and evil twin Paul. As the film begins, John is returning to a small town named after his family to inherit a shitload of money and businesses after the death of his father. But instead, he learns that local Doctor Saunders (Harry Carey) faked Paul’s death and, with former family servant Pompey (Ernest Whitman), has been holding Paul hostage in their abandoned mansion for years. Soon Paul has murdered Pompey and is wandering around town, killing randos and romancing the greedy Millie (Susan Hayward) while John and Saunders hunt him down.\n\nThe movie seems least interested in the most fascinating aspects of the story. Despite killing multiple people in horrifying ways, screenwriters Garrett Fort (“Ladies in Retirement”) and Lester Cole (“High Wall”) spent way, Way, WAY too much time on Paul just wandering aimlessly and buying Millie whatever she wants. And the fundamental noir tenant of fate seems ideal for this story – John thinks that he is going to inherit a future, but instead discovers it comes attached to a dark, horrifying secret that may cost him his life. But the movie barely touches on that, with John simply telling Saunders once or twice that he’s not a good person and then moving forward.\n\nWe never get a big barnburner scene between the brothers where all the knives come out (physically and metaphorically), though they do share a few scenes together. And despite having been held hostage in a basement for over a decade, Paul becomes well-adjusted to society almost instantly, with the only signs that he’s off is his slowed speech and an untucked shirt. Nothing ever comes of his romance with Millie, and Paul’s fate is an afterthought in the movie’s climax. It barely has any fun with the twin aspect until the third act, when the movie suddenly becomes Fritz Lang’s “Fury” with a mob trying to bring “Paul” to justice even though they’ve got their hands on John.\n\nI guess what I’m saying is that for a movie this crazy, I wish that it owned the crazy or double downed on it instead of shying away from its weirdest aspects.\n\nDirector Stuart Heisler made a bunch of noir films, some of them excellent (“The Glass Key”) and some pretty awful (“Tokyo Joe”). Which is this? Huh. Well, I’m halfway through this article and honestly don’t know whether I liked his movie or not. It was made in 1941 as the noir genre was just taking off, and is as much a Southern gothic melodrama, straight horror film and social drama as it is a noir.\n\nI feel like better casting would have made this a more fun watch, particularly the male cast. Dekker is bland and boring as John and not nearly deranged enough as Paul. Someone like Sydney Greenstreet could have had a ton of fun in Carey’s doctor role, but it was not to be.\n\nThe women pick up some of the slack, but the screenplay is clearly not interested in their characters, so there is only so much they can do. Hayward (who would later reunite with Heisler for her Oscar-nominated performance in “Smash-Up: The Story of a Woman”) is clearly better than the material she’s given, and you can tell this in every scene. Frances Farmer plays John’s wife Elaine in a role so inconsequential that I didn’t even mention her in the plot synopsis. But she is very good in the thin role, and I wish the movie would have exploited her confusion and horror over having a murderous maniac who looks just like her husband on the loose.\n\nDespite the convoluted story, the film excels when mixing the stylings of noir with the Southern setting. The cinematographer is the excellent Theodor Sparkuhl, who Heisler would also reunite with in the aforementioned “The Glass Key.” The first exploration of the dilapidated mansion is something awesome to behold, and the centerpiece murder set-piece, where Paul chases a woman down a narrow corridor into the shadows to kill her, is beautifully rendered. It’s clear from the start that Sparkuhl’s excellent work is the real reason this movie is categorized as noir.\n\nI’m not unhappy I watched “Among the Living,” but this is a minor noir in just about every aspect. It was created by a bunch of fascinating filmmakers, all of whom would go on to do better work elsewhere within the genre. But if you’ve already seen all their better movies, like “The Glass Key,” “Ladies in Retirement,” “Deadline at Dawn,” and “The Killing,” then chances are you’ll have some fun with this film too.\n\nScore: **1/2\n\nThe Film Noir Odyssey\n\nWriter: Irwin Gielgud\n\nDirector: Joseph M. Newman\n\nCast: Dennis O’Keefe, Gale Storm, Jeff Chandler, Marjorie Rambeau\n\nCinematography: William H. Daniels\n\nMusic: Walter Scharf\n\nStudio: Universal\n\nRelease: October 6, 1949\n\nAt first glance, “Abandoned” seems like just another in the laundry list of procedural noir films created in the wake of 1945’s surprise hit “The House on 92nd Street.” But in making its protagonist a reporter instead of an officer of the law and putting the emphasis on character as much as it does the investigation, it quickly becomes its own distinct, interesting film. More than that, it stuffs enough plot developments and supporting characters into its 79 minute runtime to fill four movies, so it’s certainly never boring.\n\nGale Storm stars as Paula, who heads to Los Angeles after her sister goes missing. With the help of reporter Mark (Dennis O’Keefe), Paula uncovers that her sister has been murdered… but what happened to the dead woman’s newborn baby? With the help of Mark and Police Detective MacRae (Jeff Chandler), Paula follows a trail of clues that leads her to a black-market baby ring. But their progress is hindered by private dick Kerric (Raymond Burr), who is playing both sides by seeming to help Paula while informing on her progress to the head of the baby ring: Mrs. Donner (Marjorie Rambeau).\n\nPhew, that’s a lot. And trust me, there are still like six major supporting characters and several B-plots I have not even gotten to, most notably a pregnant woman named Dottie (Meg Randell) going undercover to help expose the ring.\n\nCredit screenwriter Irwin Gielgud (“I Was a Shoplifter”) for stuffing so much interesting material into such a short film. Okay, if I’m being really honest, it’s a little bit of overstuffing. By the time we reach the climactic action sequence and multiple bad guys are pulling double crosses as the bullets fly, I was having trouble keeping track of why everyone was mad at everyone else. I give Gielgud all the credit in the world for taking such a big swing with all the twists and a large ensemble, so it’s easy to forgive his reach for somewhat exceeding his grasp.\n\nI also appreciate that Gielgud steers the film away from your usual procedural noir. Though we get the token unnecessary voiceover, it is rare. And Gielgud altering the spotlight from a police investigation to a scrappy reporter and the sister of the main victim allows the content to feel fresh – it personalizes the crime and makes our protagonists feel like they have a bigger mountain to climb in order to achieve their goals.\n\nThat said, the forced romance between Paula and Mark feels incredibly shoe-horned into the already full script. Paula literally just learned about the death of her sister, is grieving the loss and desperately searching for her newborn niece… if the niece is still alive. None of this seems to add up to her character being in a place to accept a new romance in her life, you know? But Mark romances her nonetheless, though Gielgud deserves some credit for not making his pursuit of her as creepy as it could have been. Still, the moment we get to the old clam where Paula and Mark must make out in a car to avoid detection by the baddies made me roll my eyes.\n\nPart of the problem is that O’Keefe and Storm have no chemistry whatsoever. O’Keefe (“T-Men”) is an old hand at the noir procedural subgenre and never makes much of an impact in the noir films I’ve seen him in before. Now given better dialogue, he is more engaging… but still. He’s not great. Hilariously, I think he has more chemistry with both Burr and Chandler’s characters than he ever has with Storm’s Paula.\n\nStorm is very good in early scenes, particularly the one where she sees a photograph of her sister’s dead body in the Jane Doe book at the morgue. But as her character becomes more passive while allowing Mark to lead the investigation, you can see Storm flounder with the material. Still, she nails the moment Kerric hands the baby over to her in a seedy apartment building.\n\nSpeaking of Burr, he knocks it out of the park here. He’s one of the most dependable character actors in the genre… and is especially excellent playing both sides. You can say the same of most of the supporting ensemble as well – they outshine the leads in many respects. I suspect this is because of the screenplay… giving them a little more to dig into than usual motivated them to do some excellent work.\n\nDirector Joseph H. Newman was clearly working with a tight budget, and so instructed legendary cinematographer William Daniels to exploit Los Angeles as much as possible, and boy-oh-boy does Daniels make the city shine in the same way he did New York City in “The Naked City.” The location photography is the high point of the film, and the shoot out at the end looks like something from a much higher-budget production, despite being very self-contained in a small-ish space.\n\nThanks to the unnecessary romance and awkwardly cast leads, “Abandoned” never quite becomes the minor classic it could have been. But there is a lot of fun to be had with the multi-faceted baby thief storyline, and Burr’s delicious performance makes the film more than worthwhile, especially at less than 80 minutes.\n\nScore: ***1/2\n\nThe Film Noir Odyssey / The Joan Harrison Odyssey\n\nWriter: Philip Macdonald\n\nDirector: Jacques Tourneur\n\nCast: Ray Milland, Patricia Roc, Marius Goring, Hugh Sinclair\n\nCinematography: Oswald Morris with Gilbert Taylor\n\nMusic: Robert Farnon\n\nStudio: RKO Pictures\n\nRelease: May 21, 1951\n\n“Circle of Danger” is the most interesting of mystery noir films in that it seems completely uninterested in the mystery driving the story. Instead, it seems obsessed with exploring many different humans who may or may not know anything about the reason our hero is going on this journey. The movie shouldn’t work… and yet, somehow, it does.\n\nRay Milland stars as an American (?!) named Clay, who has been working for four years to make enough money to travel to England and investigate the death of his younger brother. The young man was felled during WWII with a bullet to the head… but it turns out the bullet did not come from a Nazi gun, but a British one. Was it the superior officer Hamish (Hugh Sinclair)? Or fellow officer Sholto (Marius Goring)? Also in play is Hamish’s kinda sorta girlfriend Elspeth (Patricia Roc), who immediately takes a liking to Clay.\n\nThe only noir that I can think of that “Circle of Danger” compares to is another British one: Carol Reed’s excellent “Odd Man Out,” in which James Mason played an injured man wandering from person to person in a snowstorm as he slowly bleeds to death. That film was not interested in Mason’s character as much as those he encountered, and the same could be said for Clay in this film. Milland is perfectly suited for a role like this – charming and magnetic enough to lead the film, but he knows when to yield the stage to someone else.\n\nProducer Joan Harrison loves to hire novelists to write her screenplays, and here writer Philip Macdonald (“The Body Snatcher”) excels at crafting impactful characters with just a few lines. Many of his books like “The Rasp” are noted for their structure, but his later books like “Nightmare” showed just how deeply he could dive into character work.\n\nMost notable here is Sholto, who is the guy you’ll be talking about after the film ends. He’s gay, and the first thing Clay does upon meeting him is express surprise that he was *gasp* in the army. Homophobic, but it was a different time blah blah. Macdonald has a field day playing with how much Sholto knows or doesn’t know, and it’s a testament to the character (and Goring’s performance) that Macdonald allows the climax to be a conversation between him and Clay instead of a protracted action sequence. And what a conversation it is, quietly emotionally shattering and somehow way more exciting than any shootout could have been.\n\nThe romantic subplot between Clay and Elspeth is the least interesting subplot in the film and honestly feels a little like a tacked-on development – the fact that she is cross with Clay for pursuing his brother’s murderer instead of going on a date with her feels pretty silly. Luckily, Milland and Roc have ample chemistry with one another, despite the age difference, so watching the scenes is kind of cute… even if you want to roll your eyes half the time.\n\nMilland is very good with what amounts to a thankless role, and it’s a shame that the director frames the moments after he learns the truth about his brother in a medium shot where we can’t really read his emotions. Roc is also stuck in a likewise thankless role but does the best she can. Goring is absolutely outstanding and commands the screen every moment he inhabits it. Sinclair excels in one of the best sequences, where Hamish tries to remain friendly with Clay while avoiding giving Clay the information he wants at all costs.\n\nThe director is the legendary Jacques Tourneur, who redefined the horror movie with producer Val Lewton in the ‘40s with movies like “Cat People” and “I Walked With a Zombie.” He also directed perhaps the only perfect film noir with “Out of the Past.” In the interior scenes, he seems content to get out of the way of his performers, which is the smart move. His exterior scenes, especially those in Scotland, are all sorts of astonishing. Oswald Morris gets primary credit for the Cinematography, with Gilbert Taylor getting additional credit. Both men are legends, with Morris responsible for “Fiddler on the Roof” and Taylor lensing “Dr. Strangelove.”\n\n“Circle of Danger” is film noir, but doesn’t feel that way. It feels much more like a quiet character piece than a thriller, despite being quite thrilling in places. I like it when a movie like this takes such wild storytelling chances, and the fact that it succeeds is just a bonus.\n\nSpeaking of taking chances, this brings us to the end of our mini-Odyssey on Joan Harrison. It’s odd, because I have loved her lesser-known films like this and “They Won’t Believe Me” much more than her more recognized films like “Phantom Lady” and “Ride the Pink Horse.” This would be Harrison’s last film – she would soon reunite with director Alfred Hitchcock to produce his iconic anthology series “Alfred Hitchcock Presents” before moving on to other hit shows. I feel her stamp on these films just as much as any director or screenwriter, and that’s a testament to her talents – her contributions to this genre are invaluable.\n\nScore: ****\n\nThe Film Noir Odyssey / The Joan Harrison Odyssey\n\nWriter: Hugo Butler and Ian McLellan Hunter\n\nDirector: Robert Montgomery\n\nCast: Robert Montgomery, Leslie Banks, Felix Aylmer, Andrew Cruickank, Michael Ripper\n\nCinematography: Gerald Gibbs\n\nMusic: Malcolm Arnold\n\nStudio: Warner Bros.\n\nRelease: March 6, 1950\n\nAs a film noir, “Your Witness” (also known as “Eye Witness”) fails the litmus test – but since its filmmakers include Joan Harrison and Robert Montgomery, we’re going to make an exception. As a mystery movie, you know the solution to the mystery the moment a key character introduces herself – and even if you didn’t, the poster spoils it.\n\nThat said, it’s still pretty fun.\n\nMontgomery directs and stars (in his final film role before he segued into television) as a big-time US attorney named Adam, who one day receives word that a man named Sam who once saved his life during the war (Michael Ripper) is now on trial for murder in rural England. He flies overseas to try to help Sam beat the accusation… only to find that Sam did kill the man, but claims he did so in self-defense. The key to getting Sam released lies in a potential witness who was there the night of the shooting – a woman. But if she was the man’s lover, she may well want to see Sam hang for what he did.\n\nThe screenplay by Hugo Butler (“He Ran All the Way”) and Ian McClellan Hunter (“The Amazing Mr. X”) takes its time setting up the story. Like, one hell of a lot of time. In any other film, the set-up would take about 10-12 minutes. Here it takes 40 minutes. That’s not an exaggeration. And since we’ve already figured out the solution to the mystery simply by meeting an otherwise superfluous character who is introduced with importance, after that the viewer starts to play a waiting game for the characters to catch up.\n\nAnd were this a different movie, I would honestly be really fucking annoyed at the pacing. And for the first fifteen minutes or so, I was. But once Adam arrives in England and starts to speak to the locals, I settled and realized that the film was much more interested in the fish-out-of-water aspects of the story and its characters than the mystery itself. It took me a minute to get on the filmmakers’ wavelength, but once there, it’s a much more enjoyable watch.\n\nMy favorite recurring bit that the screenwriters conjure is that, even though everyone in the film speaks English, the different accents of the characters make for a bunch of fun lost in translation moments. Once Adam arrives in the town, he tries to rent a room for a few weeks, and by the end both he and the innkeeper Are. Speaking. So. Slowly. And. Loudly. In. Order. To. Be. Understood. Then less than ten minutes later, Montgomery and his writers unleash a seven-minute scene (!!!) of Adam desperately trying to determine who he can speak to in order to see the crime scene while speaking to a lowly bobby at the station. After two minutes, I was crawling up the wall, but somewhere in minute three I started laughing, and by the end, I was completely in tears.\n\nAnd that’s the strength of “Your Witness.” It’s a movie of moments. Of characters. Taken in that regard, it’s wonderful. But to approach it in any other storytelling manner and everything falls apart. Sam is the one who is going to be hung for murder, but he’s such an afterthought in his own story that you wouldn’t even remember what he looked like between scenes except that he is played by Michael Ripper. And in the investigation, there is only one moment of any genuine interest – when Adam suspects his lady friend Alex (Patricia Cutts) of being the witness, he takes her to look at the crime scene. Noting two doors, he puts on the guise of re-creating the murder and tells her to run into the bedroom – she tries, but goes into the wrong door, confirming to Adam that she isn’t the woman he’s looking for.\n\nMontgomery is both a steady leader of the film in front and behind the camera. He lands all the punchlines he needs to and also knows the perfect moments to let his hardened demeanor crack. Plus he has a nice easy chemistry with Cutts – you can’t help but smile when he misses his plane to walk in the garden with her.\n\nAs a director, he and cinematographer Gerald Gibbs (“The Safecracker”) never do much of anything showy, instead content to let the lovely English countryside do the work for them. But a bunch of atmosphere and shadows would not have been right for the movie anyway – it would have made the tone dire and darker than the light screenplay can sustain.\n\n“Your Witness” is inessential almost by design, but it’s nonetheless a good movie. The case matters to the story as much as it did back in “The Thin Man” series – you showed up because you loved Nick and Nora, not because whoever was murdered wherever.\n\nScore: ***1/2\n\nThe Film Noir Odyssey / The Joan Harrison Odyssey\n\nWriter: Jonathan Latimer\n\nBased on the book by Gordon McDonell\n\nDirector: Irving Pichel\n\nCast: Robert Young, Rita Johnson, Jane Greer, Susan Hayward\n\nCinematography: Harry J. Wild\n\nMusic: Roy Webb\n\nStudio: RKO Pictures\n\nRelease: July 16, 1947\n\nWhen Joan Harrison produced the 1945 noir “The Strange Affair of Uncle Harry,” Universal was horrified by an early test audience’s reaction and demanded the ending be reshot with all the murder waved away as a dream. Instead of yielding to them, badass Harrison walked away from her contract with Universal and refused to oversee the reshoots. Two years later, this time the Production Code was giving her grief about the dark finale of “They Won’t Believe Me” and insisting on reshoots. This time she stayed onboard and, stunningly, the rejiggered ending of the film actually adds to its power – the film should be considered a noir classic.\n\nThe fact that it isn’t (yet) probably has something to do with (wait for it) studio cuts. The released version was 80 minutes, and a few years ago 15 minutes were finally restored. This version, which I watched for this article, is an astonishing accomplishment, and I can only hope that as the years go on, it garners the reputation it deserves.\n\nRobert Young stars as Larry, who is on trial for murder when the film opens. He gets on the stand and narrates a series of flashbacks that show how he got there. A homme fatale, he is one of those cockroaches who just keeps skittering no matter how many times you hit it with a shoe. Though he is married to the rich Greta (Rita Johnson), he is banging one of her best friends Janice (Jane Greer) on the side. He’s about to leave Greta for Janice when his wife offers him a job where he’ll be rich in exchange for his promise to stop fucking around. It works for about six months, until he meets secretary Verna (Susan Hayward), and the cycle begins again. Before things are over, Verna and Greta are dead, one in an explosive car accident and the other one decomposing on the banks of a river. Larry is an asshole, but is he a murderer too?\n\nYoung is known for playing nice guys, and interestingly plays Larry as a nice guy… except for the moments when he shows his true colors. You can easily see why women are attracted to him, though once they learn his true personality, that’s on them. The screenplay by Jonathan Latimer (“The Glass Key”) brilliantly gives Larry the voiceover, but then contradicts several of the things he says with what we actually see onscreen. More than that, he’ll make a point that completely makes sense in his sick mind and the film will cut to an unamused jury member staring him down, not buying his “logic” for a second.\n\nAnd despite this being Larry’s story, it’s the three women who make the most impact in the film. Latimer makes each one a three-dimensional character, sympathetic in many ways but flawed in others. Greta knows what kind of monster Larry is and still genuinely loves him, but should have left him leave instead of trying to possess him. Janice hates herself for what she is doing to her best friend, and later tries to fix her mistakes. And Verna is clearly a femme fatale in training, but the most resonant moment of the film is where she allows herself to be vulnerable with Larry, hoping he would leave Greta… even though he doesn’t. It’s shattering to watch the hope leave her eyes.\n\nThe trio of performances are all excellent. Johnson gets the most to do upfront – she nails the scene where Larry is trying to break up with her and she starts packing for him. Hayward is a live wire, and that is when she is at her best as a performer, and the movie misses her after she makes her fiery exit. Greer seems like an afterthought at first, but gets a lot of complex scenes in the third act to sink her teeth into, and ably rises to the occasion. This was the film that convinced RKO executives to cast her in “Out of the Past,” and it’s easy to see why.\n\nThe original ending purported to see Larry committing suicide before the jury deemed him Not Guilty. After the Production Code interference, we now see the verdict about to be read when Larry suddenly bolts, crawling through the window. Is he trying to escape? Or kill himself? The ambiguity of the moment adds to the power. He’s then shot by a trigger-happy Bailiff and dies before the Judge orders the “Not Guilty” verdict read. I have to say, despite all the interference, I kinda love the madness of these final moments. Whatever you think Larry was trying to do, it fits the cowardice of his character. Do I think the point would have been better made with a simple shot of the “Not Guilty” paper on the floor instead of the Judge preposterously demanding it is read despite a guy bleeding out a few feet away? Absolutely. But there’s still a lot of power to the moment, and I love the anarchy of it.\n\nIrving Pichel (“Quicksand”) directs with a sure hand, getting grand performances from his actors and collaborating brilliantly with Cinematographer Harry J. Wild (“Nocturne”). Extra points must be given to the set designer, who crafted some brilliant sets, including several clubs that I wish I could visit. The one with the crazy fountain is especially memorable.\n\n“They Won’t Believe Me” is mandatory viewing for any noir lover. It’s a shame it has been lost to history as long as it has been, and that needs to change. Seek out the 95-minute version and get ready to be swept away in its awesomeness. Believe me, it’s great.\n\nScore: *****\n\nThe Film Noir Odyssey / The Joan Harrison Odyssey\n\nWriter: Jonathan Latimer\n\nStory: Roland Brown and Frank Fenton\n\nDirector: Edwin L. Marin\n\nCast: George Raft, Lynn Bari, Virginia Huston, Joseph Pevney\n\nCinematography: Harry J. Wild\n\nMusic: Leigh Harline\n\nStudio: RKO Pictures\n\nRelease: October 29, 1946\n\nAnd now we come to one of the most important voices in the film noir movement: Joan Harrison. As a screenwriter, she wrote or co-wrote such classics as “Rebecca,” “Foreign Correspondent” and “Dark Waters.” As a producer, she crafted iconic director Robert Siodmak’s first noir, “Phantom Lady,” as well as other notable films like “Ride the Pink Horse” and “The Strange Affair of Uncle Harry.” In this mini-Odyssey, we’ll be exploring four films that she produced, beginning with “Nocturne.”\n\nGeorge Raft stars as Los Angeles Police Detective Joe Warne, who is on the case after a noted composer is found shot in his Hollywood Hills home – everyone believes it was suicide, but Joe notices that a piece of music called “Nocturne” sits unfinished on the piano he died at… and he suspects murder. His superiors are certain it’s suicide and keep telling Joe to stop, even going so far as suspending him, but he can’t. The suspects include the composer’s girlfriends and ex-girlfriends, all of which he called Dolores (?!), including Frances (Lynn Bari), who Joe finds himself falling for.\n\nRKO assigned Harrison George Raft as the lead, and Raft’s studio contract ensured he could hire the director of his choice, and that was journeyman Edwin L. Marin. Marin had a longtime working relationship with Raft – he had directed him before (“Johnny Angel”) and would again (“Intrigue”) after this. This could have been disastrous for Harrison: if you have read any of my previous articles spotlighting any movie Raft starred in… or have ever seen a Raft film… then you know he’s a terrible actor.\n\nThat said, this is the best performance from him that I have seen. He’s not good, but his work is perfectly adequate, so we can all be thankful for that. I think his work her sparks whereas other performances do not is because of screenwriter Jonathan Latimer (“The Glass Key”), who makes the Joe character much more fascinating than comparable film detectives. I love the fact that he lives with his mother (Mabel Paige, who is wonderful) and the two are genuinely adorable together. They have conversations about the case while making dinner, and Joe asks questions like if she would be okay if he married a murderer. Her response? “I wouldn’t mind, as long as she’s a nice girl.”\n\nLatimer was one of the best mystery novelists working at that time and would follow this screenplay up with a one-two punch of awesome noir movies: “They Won’t Believe Me” and “The Big Clock.” He does a decent job of setting up all of the pieces and clues, though the double cross at the end is fairly predictable. But what makes the movie work is Latimer’s excellent characterization and dialogue. More than Joe and his mom, every character gets a moment to shine, from the big ape of a man who wants to break Joe’s jaw to the woman who gives Joe dance lessons and jokes that Joe could never be a cop because he doesn’t have his hat on.\n\nThough Raft and leading lady Bari don’t spark much chemistry-wise, she all but steals every scene she is in. It’s a shame she never became a bigger star. The rest of the cast is aces too, with Virginia Huston particularly interesting as the good girl, at least on the surface. In other words, everyone seems happy to have a screenplay that gives even the bit players a little more than usual to do.\n\nI have almost no experience with Marin as a director, but he acquits himself very well with the ensemble. The film is also visually distinguished. Here Marin was paired with ace Cinematographer Harry J. Wild (“Murder, My Sweet”), and the pair showcase ‘40s Los Angeles about as well as any other noir out there. The location photography is just that good. But it goes beyond that – the slow dolly into the fated-to-die composer’s home that opens the movie is the perfect way to set a scene. And the climactic reveal of the villain, a slow pan across an empty club that lasts an eternity, is glorious.\n\nHarrison would stick with RKO for her next film, 1947’s “They Won’t Believe Me,” and it’s interesting to see which members of the crew she retained for her next production. Specifically, she was smart to keep Latimer as her Screenwriter and Wild as her Cinematographer. She also famously wanted Jane Greer for Bari’s role, though Raft put the kibosh on that. Harrison made a point to hire Greer for “Believe Me” in a complex role that led to her being hired for her best role, as one of the all-time great femmes fatale in “Out of the Past.”\n\n“Nocturne” isn’t as good as either of those aforementioned movies, and to think of it with Robert Mitchum or John Garfield in the lead is to imagine a much better film. But it’s still a fun watch – crackling with good dialogue and enjoyable all the way through.\n\nScore: ***1/2\n\nThe Film Noir Odyssey / The Ida Lupino Odyssey\n\nWriter: Collier Young and Ida Lupino\n\nDirector: Don Siegel\n\nCast: Ida Lupino, Steve Cochran, Howard Duff, Dorothy Malone\n\nCinematography: Burnett Guffey\n\nMusic: Leith Stevens\n\nStudio: The Filmakers\n\nRelease: September 3, 1954\n\nWhen Ida Lupino and then-husband Collier Young formed their production company The Filmakers, they didn’t just want to break the rules of spelling. They wanted to create a series of low-budget productions that tackled serious issues of the day that were not being explored in mainstream films. And they did just that – using (at the time) audacious methods to get money like *gasp* product placement to help fund their vision. The films themselves, all created quickly over the course of six years, vary widely in quality: my favorite is “The Bigamist,” which explores the idea of… wait for it… bigamy. But they also tackle disability (“Never Fear”), rape (“Outrage”), pregnancy out of wedlock (“Not Wanted”), depression & suicide (“On the Loose”) and police corruption (“Private Hell 36”).\n\nWe’re covering that last film today, as we close out our Mini-Odyssey covering Lupino’s career. She always joked that, as a director, she was a poor man’s Don Siegel, so it’s fitting that she’d get Siegel himself to direct her in the Filmakers’ penultimate film before shuttering.\n\nThe movie begins and ends with two shootings involving officer Cal (Steve Cochran) – in the first, he kills a man and, in the second, he is killed. In between, he and his partner Jack (Howard Duff) follow a trail of counterfeiters. When a phony $50 lands at the station after the shooting, they track it back to a lounge singer named Lilli (Lupino), who agrees to help them… and also falls in love with Cal. But after the two men discover a case of stolen money and Cal pockets $80,000 of it, Jack finds himself in a moral quandary about whether to turn his partner in or not.\n\nIf the above sounds super scattered, that’s because it is. “Private Hell 36” is about one hell of a lot of things, but unfortunately none of them ever comes to the fore – you enjoy the movie on a minute-by-minute basis, but when you step back and ask yourself simple questions about the structure, you can’t answer them. Co-writers Lupino and Young create six movies in one, most of them good, but none of them given the space they need to breathe.\n\nThe most interesting sections are the ones centered on Lilli and Cal – Lupino and Cochran have fiery chemistry with one another (this even though Lupino had divorced Collier by that point and was married to Duff offscreen), and you cannot look away when they share the screen together. Lilli gets all the best lines in the movie, and Lupino sells them beautifully – plus we get a reprise of the sing/speaking she did so well in “Road House.” It’s a testament to how good these sections are that you worry about what’s to become of Lilli after Cal dies at the climax.\n\nOf course, the unfortunate thing is that their subplot is the least essential to the film itself. What should be the driving force of the storyline – the men finding that money and the ethical dilemma of what to do with it – happens so late in the running time that it barely gets explored. And what little is explored is boring – Jack just drinks and broods, so boringly a good guy that you start counting the minutes until he tells Cal he’s going to turn him in.\n\nJack is also part of the worst written and performed scene – where he comes home one night and his wife Francey tells him that he has doubts about him being a policeman. It’s such a clam, and was even then, and I feel like I’ve seen 400 versions of it so far on this Odyssey… and even considering that, this is bottom of the barrel. Francey is played by Dorothy Malone, who is clearly an incredible actress, but she’s terrible in that scene, overacting every unbelievable line and putting unnecessary emphasis on nearly every syllable she speaks.\n\nMeanwhile Duff is perfectly acceptable in a role that is completely an afterthought by the screenwriters – Lupino and Cochran blow him offscreen in every one of their scenes.\n\nThough his work with the actors is hit and miss, Siegel (“The Lineup”) unsurprisingly does a workmanlike job handling the directing from a visual standpoint. The movie was clearly low, low budget, so the filmmakers were very smart to hire noir superstar Burnett Guffey (“In a Lonely Place”) to enhance their standard sets and sequences. And Guffey does just that, turning the boring looking trailer park at the center of the story into a labyrinth of shadows and doom.\n\nHowever unfocused “Private Hell 36” ultimately feels, it’s still a worthwhile watch for Lupino and Cochran. Though I’m hot and cold on her feature work as a director, I love that she got the opportunity to tell these important stories on her own terms… and in the process take a huge step forward for female directors. As an actor in noir, Lupino’s performances are almost unparalleled in diversity and quality: she helped to create the femme fatale with “They Drive By Night” and never looked back. She also gave two of my all-time favorite noir performances, in my beloved “Ladies in Retirement” and “Road House.”\n\nSimply put, Lupino is a legend. All hail one of the queens of noir.\n\nScore: ***"
