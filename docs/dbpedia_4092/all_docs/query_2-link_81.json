        "text": "Film Noir Odyssey / The Ida Lupino Odyssey\n\nWriter: David Evans and Warren Douglas\n\nBased on the Novel by Helen Fowler\n\nDirector: Irving Rapper\n\nCast: Edmund Purdom, Ida Lupino, Ann Harding, Jacques Bergerac\n\nCinematography: Ernest Haller\n\nMusic: Paul Dunlap\n\nStudio: Allied Artists Pictures\n\nRelease: September 2, 1956\n\n“Strange Intruder” is a film that I really appreciate and want to like because it tackles subject matter most mainstream films of the time would only imply or avoid entirely – specifically the deep, lasting effects of PTSD created in soldiers when they are at war. That said, as much respect as I have for the movie, the filmmakers make it really difficult for me to actually surrender.\n\nJames Mason… er… Edmund Purdom stars as Paul, a soldier in the Korean war who is held and tortured in a prison camp. His best friend in the camp Adrian (Donald Murphy) gets a letter from his wife Alice (Ida Lupino) which confesses that she has been unfaithful to him. Things get worse for poor Adrian when he is gravely injured during a breakout and dies in Paul’s arms… babbling as he dies that he does not want his two kids raised by the man Alice cheated with and making Paul promise not to allow it to happen. Paul is rescued and placed in a mental health facility, and months later is allowed a weekend out even though he hasn’t recovered yet.\n\nHe travels to Adrian’s hometown and meets his entire family, including his kids Libby (Mimi Gibson) and Johnny (Eric Anderson). The family immediately sparks to Paul and accept him as one of their own, but as the weekend progresses, Adrian’s dying words cause Paul to spiral mentally… and this is exacerbated by the appearance of the man Alice cheated with: Howard (Jacques Bergerac). How far will Paul go to keep his promise?\n\nIt’s not a bad premise at all, especially considering how seriously writers David Evans (“Snowbound”) and Warren Douglas (“Jack Slade”) take the subject matter. The idea that an injured man’s final, incoherent ramblings before death could become so engrained into a man’s psyche because of the trauma he experienced before and after that it would affect his ability to function is fascinating. The prologue, which shows the horrors of the camp and the daily tortures the people held there went through, is by far the strongest in the film.\n\nBut once the visit actually begins, the script falters in a major way. The way the screenwriters turn Alice into some sort of a saint within a few lines of dialogue is baffling – she slept with another man because she missed Adrian and she had to tell him because she loved him too much not to? Seriously? You’re trying to sell us that as a motivation? Yikes. And while I have no problem with Paul being welcomed into the family as a surrogate version of Adrian, I truly struggle when every character repeats “You’re just like Adrian!” over and over in multiple scenes when they’ve only known him for like two hours. It’s sloppy at best, disastrous at worst… especially since it diminishes Adrian’s memory with those he loved most.\n\nBut the worst development happens when the screenwriters attempt to sell that Paul has become so unhinged with his PTSD that he might murder Adrian’s kids. Audacious in theory, even the dimmest of viewers will understand what the filmmakers are going for thematically… which means this entire subplot is a big ‘ole nothingburger. It’s false suspense and wasted time when they would have been much more successful focusing on whether or not Paul would overreact and murder the Howard character – their confrontation with a knife is the most tense the film gets after Paul escapes the war camp.\n\nIrving Rapper is usually an excellent director – he crafted an wonderful adaptation of “The Glass Menagerie” and one of my all-time favorite films in “Now, Voyager.” Frankly, I’m not sure what happened here because his strong suit is providing grounded melodrama. There are a few moments here he nails, like the moment Paul executes an obvious metaphor by providing a key to start a clock that has stopped working the moment Adrian left for war. But the vast majority of the scenes feel too long, with characters underlining their point three too many times.\n\nPurdom is okay as the lead – quite excellent in the opening moments but much less believable in the second half of the movie. He doesn’t present his PTSD in an engaging or interesting way… it feels like someone who knows nothing about a subject trying to act like he’s experiencing it.\n\nI have no idea why Lupino was cast as essentially the fourth lead of the film – perhaps she did it as a favor because she believed in the subject matter? Worse, she’s saddled with a nearly impossible character to play, and though she does her best… it’s still not great. That said, she does have the best acted moment in the film – as she hears Paul playing an instrument while she approaches her home… the emotions she goes through without saying a word are wonderful. The rest of the ensemble earns their checks, but not much more.\n\nSloppy, disjointed and ultimately not worth the investment, “Strange Intruder” is the kind of noir film that you forget about as soon as you finish watching it. Now… what movie was I talking about?"
