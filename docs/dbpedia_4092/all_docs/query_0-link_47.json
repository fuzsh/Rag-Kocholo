        "text": "My What I’ll Remember posts are an ongoing tradition in the Top Ten By Year Project. A logbook of sorts, they pay tribute to all the year-specific viewing I’ve done over the past however many months. It also stresses that, while the Top Ten list is the crux of this whole project, it’s really a means to an end. It goes without saying, but the process and journey of watching and re-watching these films is most important. I’ve recently looked back on previous What I’ll Remember posts and they evoke the feeling of a photo album, flipping through filmic memories of all shapes and sizes. Top Ten By Year: 1930 will be up by the end of the month.\n\nPosts in the What I’ll Remember tag: 1925, 1943, 1958, 1965, 1978, 1992, 2012, 2013, 2014\n\nTop Ten By Year: 1930 Coverage\n\nTop Ten By Year: 1930 – Poll Results\n\nMovie Poster Highlights: 1930\n\n100 Images from the Films of 1930\n\nFavorite Fashion in 1930 Film\n\n1930 aka The Year Garbo Spoke and The Year Lon Chaney Died\n\nThe oh-so-brief but oh-so-magical forerunners of the widescreen format, the too ambitious for its time 70mm Fox Grandeur film (The Big Trail, Song o’ My Heart) and MAGNAFILM (The Bat Whispers)\n\nAs much as anything else, for me 1930 is The Year of Lillian Roth. She is one of my favorite screen presences and esoteric pop culture figures of all time, a gifted comedienne with a crinkly nose and a practiced yet untouched vivacity. Her initial film career only lasted from 1929-1930, and 1933. She only appeared in 13 feature length films across her lifetime. Five of those were in 1930 when she was 20 years old. They were The Vagabond King, Honey, Paramount on Parade, Madam Satan, Animal Crackers, and Sea Legs.\n\nThe bedroom farce that is Madam Satan, the disaster film that is Madam Satan, the awkward musical that is Madam Satan, the outrageous and doomed masquerade party on a zeppelin that is Madam Satan, the rekindled love story that is Madam Satan. In short; Madam Satan\n\nMay I Present The Dull As Fuck Leading Man Brigade of 1930: Rod la Rocque (Let Us Be Gay), Douglass Montgomery (Paid), Chester Morris (The Divorcee), Clive Brook (Anybody’s Woman), Charles Starrett (Fast and Loose), Gavin Gordon (Romance), Jack Buchanan (Monte Carlo), Ralph Graves (Ladies of Leisure), John Garrick (Just Imagine), Ben Lyon (Hell’s Angels)\n\nSpotting Ann Dvorak, another all-time favorite of mine, as a chorus girl in Free and Easy\n\nIntroducing!\n\n(actors in their feature film debut in something more substantial than extra/bit part):\n\nSpencer Tracy (Up the River), James Cagney (Sinners Holiday, The Doorway to Hell), Miriam Hopkins (Fast and Loose), Jean Harlow (Hell’s Angels), Laurence Olivier (The Temporary Widow), Irene Dunne (Leathernecking), Bing Crosby (King of Jazz), Herbert Marshall (Murder!), Una O’Connor (Murder!), Rose Hobart (Liliom), Una Merkel (The Bat Whispers, Abraham Lincoln, etc.)\n\nThe American West in The Big Trail\n\nMGM starlets playing characters named Jerry/Gerry – can we please bring back this trend? (Norma Shearer in The Divorcee, Joan Crawford in Our Blushing Brides)\n\nThe sing-song jury meeting scene in Murder!\n\nFailed Bids for Sustained or Successful Hollywood Fame\n\n(mostly musical-based careers, not exhaustive):\n\nMarilyn Miller, Lawrence Tibbett, Vivienne Segal, John McCormack, Fanny Brice, Dennis King, Winnie Lightner, Paul Gregory, Zelma O’Neal, Helen Kane, Betty Boyd, Bernice Clare, Sharon Lynn, Jeanette Loff, Alice White, James Hall, The Sisters G, Ona Munson (later character actress), Claudia Dell, Charlotte Greenwood, Norma Terris, Ethelind Terry\n\nThe sequence in Follow Thru when Jack Haley and Eugene Pallette sneak into the girls locker room to steal a ring. They come up with hand signals. They pretend to be plumbers. The girls are in various stages of undress. It all builds to a moment of perfect anarchy\n\nThe Rise Of:\n\nMarlene Dietrich, Robert Montgomery, Marie Dressler, Wallace Beery, William Powell, Barbara Stanwyck, John Wayne, Kay Francis, Helen Twelvetrees, Ann Harding, Jean Harlow\n\nTwo-Strip Technicolor! (Follow Thru, King of Jazz, portion of Hell’s Angels)\n\nThe sheer existence of King of Jazz, the most elaborate and audaciously overproduced spectacle film I’ve ever seen from the Golden Age of Hollywood\n\nThe privilege of seeing Jean Harlow in color and with natural eyebrows (Hell’s Angels). Also realizing that tomboy Jean Harlow is the most attractive Jean Harlow\n\nThe last year before the modern movie genre begins to get in formation, allowing for a final round of bizarre and unrepeatable genre hybrids (Madam Satan, Liliom, The Bat Whispers, King of Jazz, Just Imagine)\n\nKnowingly playing with artificiality (Murder!, Liliom, The Blue Angel)\n\nThe unintentional meta symbolism of Louise Brooks’s onscreen death in Prix de Beauté\n\nThe eye candy that is John Wayne in The Big Trail\n\nMovies Interacting with Other Movies:\n\nJoan Crawford in MGM’s Paid going to see MGM’s Let Us Be Gay in the theater, Fast and Loose playing Follow Thru’s “Peach of a Pear” in the background during a scene, King of Jazz giving a shout-out to Universal’s upcoming All Quiet on the Western Front\n\n♫♫”Look out, look out the dumb police are on your trail”♫♫ (Liliom)\n\n♫♫ We’re going somewhere\n\nWe’re going nowhere\n\nWe’re going everyyyyywhere ♫♫\n\n(Madam Satan)\n\nMeta Moments:\n\n(Murder!, Die drei von der Tankstelle, The Bat Whispers, Free and Easy)\n\nAlfred Hitchcock using Murder! as a platform to blatantly experiment with sound from all conceivable angles\n\nJean Grémillon using La petite Lise as a platform to inconspicuously experiment with integrating sound as tapestry\n\nLoaded glaring and ample cowardice in The Big House\n\nHoward Hawks using sound in The Dawn Patrol as a platform for more natural dialogue and an immersion into the communal and isolated male experience of wartime\n\nRealizing I’d much rather see an all-male story over a film that clearly wants to be an all-male story but throws a woman in the mix that it has zero time or respect for\n\n(The Dawn Patrol and All Quiet on the Western Front vs. Hell’s Angels and The Big House)\n\nScary Images of 1930 Cinema:\n\nChester Morris’s shadowy confrontational glare (The Bat Whispers), Paul Whiteman as a winking moon (King of Jazz), Jack Haley’s spastic eyebrows (Follow Thru), the creepy man-baby (King of Jazz), Emil Jannings: The Humiliated Clown (The Blue Angel), Buster Keaton: The Humiliated Clown (Free and Easy)\n\nElectric fans as plot point! (Anybody’s Woman)\n\nMy first wholly depressing experience with Buster Keaton’s trademark bassoon baboon talkie moron in Free and Easy. The humiliations endured by Keaton here are a special level of cruel, not to mention that he’s forced to act in an MGM film within an MGM film\n\nLearning to appreciate Chester Morris when his characters operate outside the confines of the typical romantic lead (The Bat Whispers, The Big House as opposed to The Divorcee)\n\nThe four central day-trippers in People on Sunday are great and all but I’m all about Annie (Annie Schreyer), the beautiful lazy loafer who sleeps all weekend\n\nThe Dawn Patrol > All Quiet on the Western Front > Hell’s Angels\n\nFinding eroticism and profundity in rain and simple gestures (Ladies of Leisure)\n\nAmerican sound films that feel refreshingly free from the pressures of plot\n\n(Laughter, The Dawn Patrol, King of Jazz, Animal Crackers)\n\nAhh Golden Dawn, a movie with bottomless racism and a song (“A Tiger”) that features a woman singing about explicitly wanting a man to straight-up beat her\n\nGetting to watch one of my favorite men, Robert Montgomery, in his early career mode of sexy cad (Our Blushing Brides, The Divorcee, Free and Easy)\n\nThat damn car horn in Die drei von der Tankstelle\n\nOne of my favorite niche genres in film: Department Store Gals (Our Blushing Brides, Au bonheur des dames)\n\nThat kiss in Morocco\n\nThe unforgettable schizophrenic feeling of Borderline\n\nUncle hits a breaking point in one of the most unsettling and feverish sequences in silent cinema (Au bonheur des dames)\n\nThe Fall Of:\n\n(once major stars declining in popularity or quality of work, either momentarily or permanently) Clara Bow, John Gilbert, Al Jolson, Corrine Griffith, Norma Talmadge, Charles Farrell, Mary Pickford, Dolores Costello, Buster Keaton, Douglas Fairbanks\n\nDouglas Fairbanks Jr’s adorably playful drunken interaction with the German officer who shot him down in The Dawn Patrol\n\nThe way Kent (Robert Montgomery) is used to subvert audience expectations in The Big House\n\nThe radical modernity and spontaneity of Barbara Stanwyck’s performance in Ladies of Leisure\n\nHerbert Marshall looking like a straight-laced Jack Lemmon in Murder!\n\nEverywhere, Everywhere, Miniatures Everywhere:\n\n(including but not limited to Ladies of Leisure, Liliom, Madam Satan, Murder!, The Bat Whispers, Under the Roofs of Paris, Outward Bound)\n\nHaunting child deaths (L’age d’Or, The Doorway to Hell, Blood of a Poet)\n\nMy favorite moment in The Doorway to Hell: Doris (Dorothy Mathews) is talking on the phone to Mileaway (James Cagney) about how lame Louie (Lew Ayres) has become now that he’s removed himself from gangster life. Then Louie comes in wearing the above outfit and says “I’m a fine golfer”\n\nThe rigorous tailoring of Marlene Dietrich’s image is born in the short time between filming The Blue Angel and Morocco (though American audiences saw Morocco first)\n\nMarjorie Rambeau playing a kindly pitiful drunk (Her Man) and a wretched pitiful drunk (Min and Bill)\n\nWatching the incredible aerial footage of Hell’s Angels knowing that several pilots died because of Howard Hughes’s unstoppable ambition\n\nThe tiresome trend of introducing unrelated low comedy subplots to lighten things up (Min and Bill, The Big Trail, Her Man, Golden Dawn)\n\nThe formal rule-breaking of the prison sequence in La Petite Lise\n\nRunning through the wheat fields in City Girl\n\nThe staggering stop-motion animation of Le Roman de Renard (The Tale of the Fox). Figures, flow, range of expression. Like watching Fantastic Mr. Fox eighty years before the fact\n\nThe Claire Denis-esque way that Tilly Losch’s dance and body movements are shot in the short Dance of the Hands\n\nGreat Character Names:\n\nTripod McMasters (Wallace Beery; Way for a Sailor) Mrs. Bouccy Bouccicault (Marie Dressler; Let Us Be Gay), Amy Jolly (Marlene Dietrich; Morocco), Mileaway (James Cagney; The Doorway to Hell) Pansy Gray (Ruth Chatterton; Anybody’s Woman), Arabella Rittenhouse (Lillian Roth; Animal Crackers), Dulcinea Parker (Marion Davies; Not So Dumb) Countess Olga Balakireff (Kay Francis; A Notorious Affair), Lem Tustine (Charles Farrell; City Girl)\n\nBeing hypnotized by the close-up movement of gears in the avant-garde short Mechanical Principles\n\nEsme Percy’s ‘half-caste’ homosexual drag performer killer in Murder!\n\nThe messy but unshakable loyal friendship between Morgan and Butch (Chester Morris and Wallace Beery) in The Big House\n\nWanting to live in the proto-French New Wave romantic bloom of People on Sunday and its immaculate footage of 1930 Berlin\n\nThe angle of this shot, which takes place during a song, should give you a sense of how sophisticated and ahead of its time Die drei von der Tankstelle is within the context of ‘1930 musical’\n\nMops/Mopsi; Lilian Harvey’s nickname for her father in Die drei von der Tankstelle\n\nJean Cocteau’s trademark surrealist special effects, showing us a portal to another world and a statue that clings to its maker in Blood of a Poet\n\nBeing reminded that The Blue Angel disturbs me more than most films\n\nNorma Shearer going full dowdy (Let Us Be Gay)\n\nThe bleak ending of Street of Chance, with an unseen level of implied violence that makes way for the much more famous ending of 1931’s The Public Enemy\n\nFilms with a leftover from silents; intertitles\n\n(includingAnybody’s Woman, The Big Trail, Liliom, Follow Thru, A Notorious Affair, Not So Dumb)\n\nKay Francis giving interior life to her intoxicating Countess vamp in one of the worst films I’ve ever seen (A Notorious Affair). Her work, and the above image, deserve so much better\n\nSound films that don’t capitalize on dialogue, instead using sound as an extension of silent film (Prix de beaute, L’age d’Or, La petite Lise, The Blue Angel, Blood of a Poet. Basically; the non-American films)\n\nThe confirmation that I don’t much care for the two most canonized films of 1930, L’age d’Or and The Blue Angel\n\nThe Nutshell Pictures Corporation logo, which features an animated dog pissing into a plant (Dance of Her Hands)\n\nBusby Berkeley choreography appears on film for the first time ever in Whoopee!\n\nDiscovering the sassy greatness that is Marie Prevost. Once a leading lady, by 1930 (because of weight gain and alcohol abuse) she was relegated to the goofy “best friend” roles which she used to steal every film she appeared in (Paid, Ladies of Leisure, War Nurse)\n\nOnly in an MGM film would a character have an art deco loft hidden in a tree (Our Blushing Brides)\n\nJosef von Sternberg’s trademark absolute submission to love and desire in The Blue Angel and Morocco. The former filled with despair, the latter with triumph and a dash of hope.\n\nSpeaking of, the incredible final scene and shot of Morocco. The radical act of linking up with a group of women following their men into the desert and the unknown\n\nRooting with all my heart for Lem and Kate (Charles Farrell and Mary Duncan) in City Girl\n\n1930’s James Cagney is as sexy as sexy gets in case you needed to be reminded (The Doorway to Hell)\n\nFrances Marion dominating the early world of talkie screenwriting with credits for Min and Bill, Anna Christie (adapted by), The Rogue Song, Let Us Be Gay (continuity and dialogue), Good News (scenario), and for being the first woman to win a non-acting Oscar for her work on The Big House.\n\nThe use of interior space in Laughter\n\nJeanette MacDonald going bonkers and rustling up her precious hair in Monte Carlo\n\nFavorite Characters: Kate (Mary Duncan; City Girl), Douglas Scott (Douglas Fairbanks Jr.; The Dawn Patrol), Lola Lola (Marlene Dietrich; The Blue Angel), Annie (Annie Schreyer; People on Sunday), Paul Lockridge (Fredric March; Laughter), Countess Olga Balakireff (Kay Francis; A Notorious Affair), Trixie (Lillian Roth; Madam Satan), Jimmy Wade (Roland Young; Madam Satan), Dot Lamar (Marie Prevost; Ladies of Leisure)\n\nLeast Favorite Characters: Jack Martin (Jack Haley; Follow Thru), Professor Emmanuel Rath (Emil Jannings; The Blue Angel), Andre (Georges Charlia; Prix de beaute), Mr. Tustine (David Torrence; City Girl), Paul Gherardi (Basil Rathbone; A Notorious Affair), everyone in Golden Dawn, Count Rudolph Falliere (Jack Buchanan; Monte Carlo)\n\nFredric March suddenly kissing Nancy Carroll behind the neck while driving in Laughter, one of the sexiest gestures ever committed to film\n\nThe sketchy but catchy “Trimmin’ the Women” song in Monte Carlo\n\nProto-screwball comedies (Not So Dumb, Fast and Loose)\n\nThe mock-up symbolic hallucinatory carnival in Liliom\n\nThe most unintentionally hilarious bit from any 1930 film (Golden Dawn)\n\nThe forgotten and incomprehensible mega-fame of El Brendel (Just Imagine, The Big Trail, Her Golden Calf, New Movietone Follies of 1930).\n\nOrgasm from hair treatment in Monte Carlo\n\nBased on a Play (Paid, Romance, Fast and Loose, The Bat Whispers, Liliom, Ladies of Leisure, Follow Thru, Murder!, A Notorious Affair, Animal Crackers, Her Man (well, kind of), Not So Dumb, Let Us Be Gay, Outward Bound)\n\nThe revelation that Joan Crawford is, at least in Paid, a dead ringer for Sigourney Weaver\n\nThe onscreen persona of Wallace Beery amounts to a real-life Baloo the Bear (The Big House, Way for a Sailor, Min and Bill). He manages the impossible by remaining lovable even when talking about his murder rap or domestic abuse. A rare gift that.\n\nThe distinct hilarity Miriam Hopkins wrings out of “I’m sorry” is the epitome of what makes her so great (Fast and Loose)\n\n♫♫ She wanted to take it further\n\nSo she arranged a place to go\n\nTo see if he\n\nWould fall for her incognito ♫♫\n\n(Madam Satan & “Babooshka” by Kate Bush)\n\nThe wholesome sex comedy is born with Follow Thru\n\nMarie Dressler beating the piss out of Wallace Beery and tearing apart his room in Min and Bill\n\nFredric March casually drinking coffee in a polar bearskin rug in Laughter\n\nThe wordless sequence in which Jerry (Norma Shearer) allows herself to be illicitly seduced by playboy Don (Robert Montgomery) in The Divorcee\n\nThe names of the party guests in Madam Satan (Miss Conning Tower! Mr. and Mrs. Hot & Tot! Mr. & Mrs. High Hat! Miss Victory! Miss Movie Fan! Fish Girl!)\n\nThe “I Want to Be Bad” number in Follow Thru\n\nQUOTES:\n\n“I’ve balanced our accounts”\n\n(Norma Shearer in The Divorcee, talking to her husband about her promiscuity)\n\n“I know now how a man feels about these things”\n\n(Norma Shearer in Let Us Be Gay, talking to her husband about her promiscuity)\n\n“It’s that coin that makes them so sassy Cassidy”\n\n(Paid)\n\n“I’m an orchid and he wants to change me into a lily” (Barbara Stanwyck in Ladies of Leisure)\n\n“I never knew you had pale blue eyes. I hate pale blue eyes. Funny, I never noticed it before” (Kay Francis in A Notorious Affair)\n\nTed: “Who’s the man?”\n\nJerry: “Oh, Ted, don’t be conventional!”\n\n(Chester Morris and Norma Shearer in The Divorcee)\n\n“The memory of you makes them much happier than you ever could”\n\n(The Magistrate in Liliom)\n\n“What are you doing with those fingers?”\n\n“Nothing. Yet.”\n\n(Marlene Dietrich and Gary Cooper in Morocco)\n\n“Wise as a tree full of owls, that’s me”\n\n(Paid)\n\n“Oh, and a cup of coffee”\n\n“Large or small?”\n\n“Do I look like a small cup of coffee?”\n\n(Marie Prevost and a waiter in Ladies of Leisure)\n\n“Well, do you see my flowers here?”\n\n“You’re crushing them”\n\n“Oh, what does it matter?

I’ll be all right in a minute. Left-handed moths ate the painting, eh?”\n\nChico: “Yeah, it’s a-my own solution.”\n\nGroucho: “I wish you were in it. Left-handed moths ate the painting. You know, I’d buy you a parachute if I thought it wouldn’t open.” (Animal Crackers)\n\n“Press the flesh. Who’d you croak?” (The Big House)\n\n“If you don’t watch your step you’re gonna find a way to treat yourself to a handful of clouds” (The Doorway to Hell)\n\n“When a man begins to talk about inhibitions, it’s time to look at the view.” (Joan Crawford in Our Blushing Brides)\n\n“It already has proved dangerous to wipe yourself off on the furniture”\n\n(Blood of a Poet)\n\nGroucho’s Strange Interlude bit in Animal Crackers, particularly: “This would be a better world for children, if the parents had to eat the spinach.”\n\n“Oh Mary, don’t be so 1890”\n\n(Paid)\n\n“When does she dunk her body?” (of course this is Eugene Pallette’s way of asking when a woman takes a bath in Follow Thru)\n\n“Four years ago you took my name and replaced with with a number. Now I’ve taken that number and replaced it with your name”\n\n(Joan Crawford in Paid)\n\nAngela: “Here’s the newspaper”\n\nBob: “Anything new?”\n\nAngela: “Not much. Only that you’re a bigamist” (Madam Satan)"
