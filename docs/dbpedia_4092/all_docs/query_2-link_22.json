I know it won an Oscar but still surprised whenever it misses these lists.\n\nOh I definitely like a lot how this film looks, great, great work. I love how Cloquet and Unsworth often set Tess in her surroundings, whether as contrast or as part of it.\n\nThe thing with Top Tens is, that there are only ten (or a bit more if you include honorable mentions) spots.\n\nPost by jimmalone on\n\nLawrence of Arabia (Freddie Young)\n\nRoad to Perdition (Conrad L.

Love the inclusion of Inception.\n\nPost by JangoB on\n\nI don't have a definitive list (I often have these urges to make one but I haven't yet sat down to properly work on it) but in a way off the top of one's head answers are often just as telling and truthful in cases like this. So off the top of my head:\n\n- Gone with the Wind\n\n- The Conformist\n\n- Barry Lyndon\n\n- 2001: A Space Odyssey\n\n- 8½\n\n- Schindler's List\n\n- Saving Private Ryan\n\n- Lawrence of Arabia\n\n- Apocalypse Now\n\n- Citizen Kane\n\nThese are not ranked, I just posted them in order of when they came into my mind. Next ones to pop up were Persona, Kagemusha, Black Narcissus.\n\nPost by jimmalone on\n\nI don't have a definitive list (I often have these urges to make one but I haven't yet sat down to properly work on it) but in a way off the top of one's head answers are often just as telling and truthful in cases like this.

Next ones to pop up were Persona, Kagemusha, Black Narcissus.\n\nWas expecting you to have at least one of Kaminski's both wins on that list. Both definitively great works, which would make a list of mine if it was just a bit longer.\n\nPost by themoviesinner on\n\nIn chronological order, these are probably my very favorite, but there are several others that I could mention as well:\n\nThe Seventh Seal (1957)\n\nThe Red And The White (1967)\n\nRed Psalm (1972)\n\nThe Hourglass Sanatorium (1973)\n\nStalker (1979)\n\nAlexander The Great (1980)\n\nThree Crowns Of The Sailor (1983)\n\nYeelen (1987)\n\nLandscape In The Mist (1988)\n\nHero (2002)\n\nPost by Deleted on\n\nstephen while Refn is somewhat hit or miss for me I still think OGF is 1 of the most underrated films of the last decade, and the cinematography is incredible.
