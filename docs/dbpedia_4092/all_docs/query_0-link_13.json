        "text": "Synopsis:\n\nFormer Broadway actress Joyce Heath (Bette Davis) has become a penniless alcoholic. Wealthy New York architect Dan Bellows (Franchot Tone, original Mutiny on the Bounty) finds Joyce drunk at a restaurant and takes her to his Connecticut home, so she can sober up. Being a huge fan of the actress, Dan decides to rehabilitate Joyce.\n\nReaction & Thoughts:\n\n“I’m bad for people. I don’t mean to be, but I can’t help myself.”\n\nWarner Bros.’s Dangerous is a low-budget, ordinary B-movie directed by Alfred E. Green (Disraeli and The Jolson Story) and written by Laird Doyle (Oil for the Lamps of China and The Prince and the Pauper). It’s also a perfect example of how super-star Bette Davis could turn a piece of coal into gold by utter determination.\n\nLoosely based on the tragic life of stage and film actress Jeanne Eagles (1890-1929), Dangerous is one of many low-cost productions Warners made at the height of the Depression era. It’s the kind of movie that has no artistic aspirations. Except that leading actress Davis grabbed the script and treated it like a Shakespearean text.\n\nI’ve always admired actors who are able to rise above the ordinary. It’s easy to be great when you are working with quality material, but it’s hard to excel with less-than stellar stuff. Despite the fact that she’s up to her knees in B-movie suds, the titanic Davis magically makes everything work and won an Oscar in the process.\n\nFilm critic E. Arnot Robertson wrote, “I think Davis would probably have been burned as a witch if she had lived two or three hundred years ago. She gives the curious feeling of being charged with power which can find no ordinary outlet.” That pretty much summarizes how I feel about Davis’s performance.\n\nDangerous also benefits from Franchot Tone’s smart performance. Tone was a good choice for the leading male character. From the first moment Tone appears, you know that he is no token female escort. The character he plays is hopelessly underdeveloped, but Tone is able to suggest intelligence and class. That gives Davis something she can bounce herself against, and the sparks start flying almost immediately.\n\nDavis and Tone are a good screen couple, and I wish they had made more movies together. There are two more good performances in the film: Margaret Lindsay (Lady Killer and Jezebel) is lovely as Tone’s fiancé, and Alison Skipworth (The Girl from 10th Avenue and Satan Met a Lady) does a fine job as Tone’s housekeeper. The film was shot by Ernest Haller (Gone with the Wind and What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?).\n\nConclusions & Final Thoughts:\n\nDangerous is worth seeing for Bette Davis’s Oscar-winning performance alone. She often said that the Oscar was a consolation prize for not winning for Of Human Bondage (1934). Perhaps she’s right, but I believe the movie contains one of the actor’s best early performances. Also with Douglas Wood (John Ford’s The Prisoner of Shark Island), and Dick Foran (The Petrified Forest). B&W, 79 minutes, Not Rated."
