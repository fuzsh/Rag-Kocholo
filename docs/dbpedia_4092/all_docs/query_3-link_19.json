But his five nominations in fact tell more about his reputation within Hollywood itself. Haller produced quality work for 45 years. He came into his own during the 1950s and was known within industry circles for his expert location shooting.\n\nHaller's roots in the film business went back to Hollywood's origins. After leaving high school, he began in 1914 with Biograph as an actor, but switched to the camera department the following year. His first work behind the camera came with an early serial, TheHazards of Helen. He then moved his way up through the on-the-job training system which was then in force, and was credited for his first film as cinematographer in 1920. An Ernest Haller film would then appear every year until 1965.\n\nAt Warner Brothers during the early 1930s, work was fast and furious, and Haller helped grind films out at the rate of one every two months. Representative titles included Howard Hawks's The Dawn Patrol and Frank Lloyd's Weary River. But he worked on every possible genre, and did what he was told. By the late 1930s Ernest Haller had worked his way up to strictly A-budget feature films. He worked with all the major stars on the Warner lot, from Errol Flynn to Humphrey Bogart to James Cagney. If he had a specialty it was photographing the films of Bette Davis and Joan Crawford. Indeed he won an Oscar nomination for Davis's Jezebel and Crawford's Mildred Pierce. The latter film was one of the pioneering efforts in the early days of film noir.\n\nWith the coming of age of independent film production in the 1950s, Haller began to freelance like nearly all other cameramen. He formally left Warners in 1951 and worked on some poor films, and also on some of Hollywood's best. In the latter category we certainly must include Rebel without a Cause, directed by Nicholas Ray and a pioneering effort in CinemaScope, and Man of the West directed by Anthony Mann, a great director of westerns.\n\nYet despite his long association with Warners and other distinguished work, Haller will always best be remembered for his work behind the camera for Gone with the Wind. He was not David O. Selznick's original choice for cinematographer, and he started long after production was well underway, replacing Lee Garmes. Historians note that although Haller receives sole credit for the camerawork on the film (and received the film's Oscar for camerawork), Lee Garmes was responsible for most of the first hour of the picture. Yet certainly the bulk of Gone with the Wind is Haller's picture, and will always be noted as the most important color film made in Hollywood prior to the 1950s.\n\n—Douglas Gomery"
