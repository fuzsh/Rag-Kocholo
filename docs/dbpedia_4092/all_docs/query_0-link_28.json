        "text": "The Film Noir Odyssey\n\nWriter: Robert Rossen\n\nBased on the play “Hot Nocturne” by Edwin Gilbert\n\nDirector: Anatole Litvak\n\nCast: Richard Whorf, Betty Field, Priscilla Lane\n\nCinematography: Ernest Haller\n\nMusic: Heinz Roemheld\n\nStudio: Warner Bros.\n\nRelease: November 15, 1941\n\nAwards: The title song was nominated for Best Original Song at the Oscaars but lost to “The Last Time I Saw Paris” from “Lady Be Good”\n\nPercent Noir: 60%\n\nWhen I heard tell of a film noir musical, you better believe it was in my Amazon cart within thirty seconds. The filmmakers are all dependable, the cast is solid and the title song is, of course, legendary. Still, I didn’t have high hopes because the film is so unknown today – it seems like something as odd as a noir musical would be more well known, if only as a punchline.\n\nI shouldn’t have been worried.\n\nTurns out, this movie is bananas in all the best ways.\n\nFirst things first, this is not a musical in the sense that the characters sing as part of everyday life a’la “Funny Face” or “The Wizard of Oz.” This is a musical where all the numbers are performances the central band or supporting characters are playing. So it’s like the performances in “Gilda,” except “Blues in the Night” has way more of them.\n\nSpeaking of that central band, its leader/our main character is Jigger (just wait, the names get way worse), played by Richard Whorf. He’s a talented pianist who is trying to save jazz just like Ryan Gosling, and over the first act we see his band come together. These include singer Character (told you they got worse), played by Priscilla Lane, and her husband, trumpeter Leo (Jack Carson). Elia Kazan (yes, that Elia Kazan!) plays clarinet-player Nicky, Billy Halop plays drummer Peppi, who is obviously gay and in love with Jigger but the movie delightfully doesn’t make a big deal about it, and Peter Whitney as Pete… a character I’ve already forgotten about.\n\nThe group becomes a makeshift family in all the ways you’d expect – they finish each other’s sentences, they play on boxcars as they ride the rails from town to town, and when Character becomes pregnant they all panic in the doctor’s office like they’re the father. Aside from a one-minute barroom brawl started by Jigger as the movie opens, these characters genuinely seem like the most innocent of innocent human beings. Almost like characters from an MGM musical of the era. Their interactions, speech patterns… everything specifically seems to mimic that “type.”\n\nThat’s what makes what comes next all the more interesting.\n\nThe band encounters another man riding the rails named Del (Lloyd Nolan), who holds them up for five dollars but, when the group doesn’t turn him into to security, invites them to come perform at his bar The Jungle, which he immediately turns into an illegal casino. Also at The Jungle is femme fatale Kay (Betty Field), who is desperately in love with Del – since he doesn’t return her affection, she sets her sights on Jigger to make Del jealous. And suddenly, the cast of an MGM musical has walked into a film noir, complete with real stakes and actual murder & mayhem.\n\nJigger becomes obsessed with Kay and she seduces him into leaving the group and going to the big city with her, but soon enough it becomes clear that Kay is only using Jigger (mostly because she tells him this repeatedly). Jigger has a nervous breakdown and must be rescued, mentally and physically, by the band… but Kay isn’t done with Jigger yet. Or Del. And as the third act plays out, she really lives up to the “Fatale” part of her name.\n\nI have to admit, I’m kind of stunned at how well the two genres work when mashed up together. I was completely onboard during the early, light sequences and emotionally engaged with the darker turns. I liked and cared about our heroes (except for Pete, who I still don’t remember), and Kay is a fantastic femme fatale, crackling and dangerous like a sparking live wire.\n\nA lot of this has to do with the screenplay by Robert Rossen (“Desert Fury”), which manages to pull off the tightrope act with aplomb. It’s also because the crackling, fast-paced dialogue we expect from a good noir is a close cousin to the crackling, fast-paced dialogue we expect from a good musical. There’s also a lot of genuine humanity to be found – there’s a moment where several of the soon-to-be bandmates find themselves in jail and listen to the neighboring inmates sing an incredible rendition of the title song, and it so moves them that they decide to become a band. The singers are black, and the song is accompanied by a montage of their difficult lives in the South, which works better than you’d expect. The song feels almost like an island unto itself – perhaps purposely so that censors could easily snip it out before showing the film in the deep south – and yet it serves to place a beating heart into the proceedings.\n\nThe director is Anatole Litvak, who brings a sure and steady hand to the film. He’s more well known for his films noir “Sorry, Wrong Number” and “The Long Night,” neither of which I like, and if there were any justice in the world “Blues in the Night” would be rediscovered and take its place rightly as his best noir.\n\nThe ensemble is roundly excellent. Aside from Lane, they are mostly unfamiliar to me (well, I know Kazan, but not as an actor) but everyone except stupid Pete made a good impression and I’m hoping to see them in more things as the Odyssey continues. Field in particular provides us with a femme fatale for the ages.\n\n“Blues in the Night” was a genuine surprise to me in all the best ways. If you’d never heard of it before (like I hadn’t), you owe it to yourself to track it down. The performance of the title song along makes it worth the price of admission."
