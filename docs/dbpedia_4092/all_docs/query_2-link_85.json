        "text": "I’m going to be honest, I found John Huston’s body of work as a director to be frustrating. His highest highs are very high indeed, but his lows are really low. And, in addition, there’s a whole lot in the milquetoast middle that seems to be missing something, some key ingredient, that could have elevated the film around it. Huston went on record late in life that he’d take directing jobs just because they were set in places that he wanted to travel to (it’s hard to imagine what else would have attracted him to the material of The Barbarian and the Geisha other than the fact that he got to make it in Japan), and that lack of care about the film as a whole manifests in different ways across his career.\n\nAlthough it wasn’t always the case. I never felt like, even in something as so obviously a studio assignment as In This Our Life, that he was just phoning it in until the failure of Beat the Devil. It felt like an attempt to replicate the success of The African Queen, and no one seems to have liked it. After the drubbing that he took behind the scenes on The Red Badge of Courage, it seems to have broken him and he entered, what Vincent Canby of The New York Times called, his “tired period”. Movie after movie where it felt like he showed up to just manage the set, no matter what the state the script was in.\n\nDespite the fact that movies like A Walk with Love and Death exist because Huston wanted to make a medieval movie starring his daughter, or Freud: The Secret Passion because he liked Freudian analysis and wanted to do something with dreamlike imagery, or The List of Adrian Messenger felt like an effort to just play in a James Bond-like space, Huston seems to have still been attracted to projects that had some motif or thematic idea of men who want more in a materialistic world that can never give enough to satisfy the hunger in the human soul. That is an interesting idea from an interesting perspective, and I was glad to pick it up from time to time when it came along with surprising regularity.\n\nDon’t get me wrong. There is his own fair share of good stuff, but even that good stuff felt like they were letting a whole lot on the table that Huston could have used to push them higher.\n\nAnyway, I finished, and now the listicle gods must be appeased. Here be ye, list, and bask in the definitiveness. And don’t forget to check out the rest of the definitive rankings. They’re definitive.\n\n36. The Kremlin Letter\n\n“Huston was simply out of his depth here. He had no idea how to make a thriller, and it showed.”\n\n35. The Roots of Heaven\n\n“The result is a complete mess of a message film that can’t get it’s own message straight while piling in a bunch of other stuff, confusing itself with its array of characters and bad structure, and doing everything possible to make the nicest terrorist fiction could create.”\n\n34. Phobia\n\n“There was never going to be any saving the film without going back into the writer’s room for a year, and he just wanted to get it over with. Not that Huston was above making bad decisions, especially on thrillers, but I really just get the sense that he refused to give his contractual obligations more time than required.”\n\n33. The Mackintosh Man\n\n“That The Mackintosh Man falls flat, at this point, is not really that much of a surprise, though. This is the third attempt that Huston has made at a thriller, and it’s not a passable as his first (The List of Adrian Messenger), but at least it’s not as unwatchable as The Kremlin Letter.”\n\n32. The Unforgiven\n\n“I complain a lot, but overall, the film is…fine. I didn’t hate it. If you can turn away from the nearly constant incoherence of its subtext, it’s a finely made western adventure and little else. It’s…okay.”\n\n31. The List of Adrian Messenger\n\n“So, meh. Huston has made worse, but this is, at best, middling fare that was rightly forgotten by the cinematic world. Huston really feels like he’s just coasting along from one job to the next, just finding the weirdest little reasons to pick up projects without trying to make them the best that they can be.”\n\n30. The Barbarian and the Geisha\n\n“Is it good? No, not at all. Is it a disaster? Not really.”\n\n29. Beat the Devil\n\n“It’s unfortunate that the film doesn’t really work, but this was outside of Huston’s forte of hard men doing hard things in hard places. He wasn’t outside of comedy, but poking fun at a genre requires a different set of narrative muscles that he didn’t really have, so bringing in Truman Capote to provide comedy only went so far in achieving what he wanted to do. Still, it seems like he, Capote, and Bogart had a great time on set. I guess that’s what was really important.”\n\n28. Freud: The Secret Passion\n\n“Huston was obviously trying something here, but I don’t think he gave the kinds of things he wasn’t experimenting with the kind of attention necessary to make it work. Throw in the fact that he was obviously completely enamored of Freudian analysis itself, and you’ve got what essentially amounts to a secular saint in his mind that he could never stand against.”\n\n27. Prizzi’s Honor\n\n“He wasn’t there to craft a work of art. He was there to make sure that things were filmed well while good performances got captured with that camera. That sort of approach can work, but here I think it’s just off.”\n\n26. We Were Strangers\n\n“Overall, the film does easily fit with the overall thrust of Huston’s work thematically. Tony is that sort of Fred Dobbs character who takes things too far when he becomes too obsessed and too into the work, but that sop to audiences at the end for a happy ending and a romance just hobble things. Still, I got a real kick out of watching Jennifer Jones firing away with a machine gun. That was delightful.”\n\n25. Reflections in a Golden Eye\n\n“So, I think it’s a near miss. Huston found this script interesting, probably because of the hidden sexuality of the piece that aligned with his obvious interest in Freudianism while, once again, being able to work with famous movie stars that he was probably friends with. Also, there’s a lot of horseback riding.”\n\n24. Annie\n\n“So, I just wish there was something more of a throughline over it all. The staccato nature of the little vignettes to bring in details from the greater comic strip work against the central plot which ends up getting sidelined for long stretches. The bit with FDR feels like an insult to the author instead of part of the story. However, it’s handsomely produced and the songs are fun. I wouldn’t go so far as to call it good, but it’s pretty solid, almost enough.”\n\n23. A Walk with Love and Death\n\n“It’s not really good, but it’s far from bad. It looks good. It’s acted well. It has a point. However, it just feels like Huston could have pushed it into a better direction, elevating the material, and chose to simply film it as it was, offering nothing but his technical prowess to the production when it needed a creative hand to move it more.”\n\n22. The Life and Times of Judge Roy Bean\n\n“The irony is, I think, that Huston really, really tried with this. The filmmaking is more interesting than it has been since, probably, Freud: The Secret Passion ten years prior, and it really feels like Huston put himself more into this film than in anything else he had made in a decade. He also lost himself in the fun of having one of the biggest movie stars in the world and a bear on set, and he let that come through on the final film.”\n\n21. Sinful Davey\n\n“Anchored by an amusing performance from Hurt (though Albert Finney in Tom Jones just oozed more effortless charisma), Sinful Davey is underseen, over-maligned, and, well, lightly amusing.”\n\n20. The Night of the Iguana\n\n“The actors are all very good. The story works and doesn’t really go anywhere that interesting. The writing is impeccable in terms of creating characters and throwing them at each other. Huston brings his professional sense to the production, not only getting the great performances from his actors but framing everything effectively and well (his best shots now feel like the sorts of things that Wyler would have settled with).”\n\n19. Under the Volcano\n\n“Under the Volcano is not Huston’s best work, but it’s an interesting look at hopelessness and inaction carried by a strong central performance. It’s not of great note, but it’s something of a throwback to his period around The Roots of Heaven in the middle of his final stage of more mainstream work.”\n\n18. Moulin Rouge\n\n“It’s an interesting experiment from Huston that does work. Embracing Technicolor at a level that even The African Queen didn’t and telling the story of a man his polar opposite in physicality, Huston found another solid, respectable success. It may not be his best film, but it’s another testament to his abilities as a filmmaker.”\n\n17. In this Our Life\n\n“Still, as Huston’s second effort, a largely forgotten film except by Bette Davis completists, it’s a solid work. The acting is good, Huston’s lens (managed by cinematographer Ernest Haller) is accomplished and complex, the story is multi-faceted and well-done overall. I have my issues, but I think it’s a worthwhile film despite them.”\n\n16. Fat City\n\n“Still, Huston comes out with a solidly good dual character study, and it works. There’s still no real fire to Huston’s filmmaking like he had in the beginning of his career, but the benefits of being a solid technician comes through here.”\n\n15. Across the Pacific\n\n“Across the Pacific is a minor work, hindered by a few things, but ultimately entertaining as a thriller and interesting as a look at America immediately post-Pearl. That it ends up working a bit better than Air Force isn’t that much of a surprise since the ending, while uneven, is still in alignment with the rest of the film leading up to it.”\n\n14. The Asphalt Jungle\n\n“Still, it’s an accomplished film. Huston shows his continued modification of his Wyler influences by bringing in more shadow-work inspired by German Expressionism. He’s a strong filmmaker, and he managed something that went against the MGM house style under Louis B. Mayer. It’s really not a wonder that he didn’t last long under that contract.”\n\n13. The Bible: In the Beginning…\n\n“So, on the one hand, this is Huston pushing himself while well-utilizing a huge budget from Italian sources for 20th Century Fox. On the other, he’s too loyal to the source, dragging it down as a film. I did like the film and enjoyed the experience on the whole, but I still feel like it could have been more.”\n\n12. Heaven Knows, Mr. Allison\n\n“It’s a story of war, about connection in war, and its impermanence. That it doesn’t quite connect as well as Ford’s film is probably because Huston just kind of gave up when he realized he couldn’t push it as far as he wanted with the Hays Office in power.”\n\n11. The Red Badge of Courage\n\n“The combination of images, performance, and basic story come together to make something solidly good and interesting, but the mystery of that original cut will always remain. No one seems to have preserved a copy and, much like Orson Welle’s original ending to The Magnificent Ambersons, it’s probably lost to time. I’m glad to see the shadow of a potential masterpiece here. It’s solidly good, demonstrating some of Huston’s greatest technical strengths, but it always does feel like there’s a masterpiece hidden just around the corner.”\n\n10. Wise Blood\n\n“That combination of Huston’s technical skill, finding the right actors and letting them go, and the focused eye of the writers on set created this fascinating little film adapting O’Connor’s prose into cinematic language.”\n\n9. Escape to Victory\n\n“Is it great? No. Is it fun and amusing? I’d say so pretty definitely. It’s unchallenging, evoking better movies from the past (mainly The Great Escape and a host of sports films like Rocky), but handsome and effective. This is one of those films that relies on a base-level of character to get us invested, some editing tricks to keep things exciting, and a rousing score to get the blood pumping.”\n\n8. The Misfits\n\n“The dredges that had been the broken storytelling of The Roots of Heaven, The Unforgiven, and The Barbarian and the Geisha have given way for a much more perceptive and well-built story in The Misfits, putting John Huston back on track. All of these stories deal with the kinds of things near and dear to John Huston as an artist (yes, there is an atomic bomb reference), but the script here is simply better than the stuff Huston has been working on for years.”\n\n7. The African Queen\n\n“So, I don’t hold this up in the highest annals of Huston’s body of work. It’s really fun, well-built, and really quite pretty, using color cinematography for the first time in Huston’s career to film the beautiful corners of Africa to great success, but I just find the middle section a bit flabbier and unfocused than it could be.”\n\n6. Moby Dick\n\n“So, my problems with the film are Peck and that some of the special effects aren’t great. The rest? Gold. It’s a great distilling of the ideas and story of Melville into cinematic form. The world of the whaling vessel looks great, the ideas of madness in pursuit of too much are intact, and the characters well drawn.”\n\n5. The Maltese Falcon\n\n“Huston entered the WB system as director in the early 40s, made a very fun and accomplished entry in their house style while applying the filmmaking lessons he’d learned from Wyler and keeping Hammett’s storytelling intact. He bred a new movie star in the process and got his own directing career into a great opening state. The Maltese Falcon is a very good first film, and a fun movie in its own right.”\n\n4. Key Largo\n\n“If this film was only about 70 minutes long, I’d call it Huston’s best film without even getting too deep into it. At the whole 100-minutes, I still think it’s great, but not as blindingly great as the hurricane section makes it. This is still a professional, intelligent film with something to say about heroism, desire, and the limits of materialism, and Huston brings his best eye to all of the action while directing his actors (including Trevor’s well-deserved Oscar-winning performance) with great style.”\n\n3. The Dead\n\n“The Dead is a touching film, a quiet exploration of a country at a crossroads, the individuals that make up the country, and those disconnected from it despite living right there. It’s also one of Huston’s best films.”\n\n2. The Treasure of the Sierra Madre\n\n“It’s a tale of greed, paranoia, and madness, all done beautifully with everyone at the top of their game. That it did not inspire great box office returns isn’t much of a surprise, though. It isn’t much of a crowd pleaser.”\n\n1. The Man Who Would Be King\n\n“This is the John Huston movie I’ve been waiting for and wanted for the past nearly two decades of his output. I know he won’t match it again, but it’s nice to see him finding that right groove one more time.”"
