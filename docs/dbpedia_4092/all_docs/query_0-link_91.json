        "text": "Directed by: Vincente Minnelli\n\nWritten by: Alan Jay Lerner\n\nThe other Oscars it won: Minnelli (Best Director); Lerner (Best Adapted Screenplay); Joseph Ruttenberg (Best Cinematography – Color); William A. Horning, E. Preston Ames, Henry Grace, and F. Keogh Gleason (Best Art Direction); Cecil Beaton (Best Costume Design); Adrienne Fazan (Best Film Editing); André Previn (Best Score – Musical); Frederick Loewe and Lerner (Best Original Song)\n\nWhat it beat for Best Picture: Auntie Mame, Cat on a Hot Tin Roof, The Defiant Ones, Separate Tables\n\nYes, the creepiest, most pedophiliac movie ever to win Best Picture is this list's worst. How to define \"worst\" in this context, especially when judging Gigi — a movie musical some people love now, and certainly many people loved in 1958 — against films that were barely movies as we currently recognize them? This list is, of course, totally subjective: I factored in my personal feelings about each movie, along with how well it has held up, how influential it is, and what it was up against. And then there's the ineffability of common wisdom, which I also have taken into account. No matter how I feel about Annie Hall or about Schindler's List, for example, I know I'm in a minority view in my dislike — and that matters. Not with Gigi, though, in which Leslie Caron plays a Parisian girl being trained to be a courtesan who ends up in a push-and-pull relationship with the much older Gaston (Louis Jordan). This is the movie that gave us that disturbing cultural artifact, the song \"Thank Heaven For Little Girls.\" If you want disturbing psychosexual movies from 1958, let's agree that Vertigo, which was nominated only for Best Art Direction and Best Sound, is preferable. To reiterate: Gigi is the worst.\n\nDirected by: William A. Wellman\n\nWritten by: Hope Loring and Louis D. Lighton\n\nThe other Oscars it won: Roy Pomeroy (Engineering Effects)\n\nWhat it beat for Best Picture: 7th Heaven, The Racket\n\nWhere to put Wings, the first movie ever to win Best Picture at the first-ever Academy Awards (which were not yet called \"Oscars\")? It's a silent film, and, until The Artist, was the only one ever to have won in the top category. And, as with some of these early winners, it's more important to film history than it is enjoyable to watch now. I mean… it's long! Almost two-and-a-half hours long. Still, I'd rather watch this story about two friends who become pilots in World War I, featuring Clara Bow and a young Gary Cooper, than, say, Crash ever again. (Fun fact: The first Academy Awards took place on May 16, 1929. It was almost two years after Wings was released. But the first ceremony honored films released in 1927 and 1928.)\n\nDirected by: Alejandro González Iñárritu\n\nWritten by: Alejandro González Iñárritu, Nicolás Giacobone, Alexander Dinelaris, Armando Bo\n\nThe other Oscars it won: Iñárritu (Best Director); Iñárritu, Nicolás Giacobone, Alexander Dinelaris, Armando Bo (Best Original Screenplay); Emmanuel Lubezki (Best Cinematography)\n\nWhat it beat for Best Picture: American Sniper, Boyhood, The Grand Budapest Hotel, The Imitation Game, Selma, The Theory of Everything, Whiplash\n\nGleefully overblown in every way, Birdman opened to generally rapturous reviews about Michael Keaton's welcome comeback, the supporting performances of Edward Norton and Emma Stone, and the camera work of Emmanuel Lubezki (which made the movie look like one continuous shot), and the movie on the whole. Only when Birdman swept the guild awards —the Screen Actors Guild award for Best Ensemble, the Directors Guild award for Iñárritu, and the Producers Guild award for the movie — did panic begin to set in: Might the Academy also think Birdman was actually better than Richard Linklater's beautiful, loving, humane achievement for the ages, Boyhood? Yes. Yes, it did. In Birdman, Keaton plays Riggan Thomson, an un-fun-house mirror version of himself: an aged actor from a superhero franchise of yore, struggling to come back to find relevance and validation. (Thank god Keaton was in Spotlight in 2015, a movie in which he was able to actually show off his subtle, intelligent skills.) In his Broadway directing/writing/acting debut, Riggan is surrounded by caricatures of theater fools. These include Mike (Norton), a hothead egoist and star of the stage; Lesley (Naomi Watts), a desperate actor and woman who never ceases announcing phrases like \"This is Broadway, and I'm here finally!\"; and Laura (Andrea Riseborough), Riggan's girlfriend and co-star, who doesn't develop as a character beyond wanting more from Riggan. Without its achievements in cinematography, Birdman would be seen for what it is: an indulgent character dramedy dipped in magical realism about the worst, most annoying people we will — if we're lucky — never meet. There are movies on this list that have not aged well after decades. Birdman, with its references to bloggers and virality and Meg Ryan's plastic surgery, has managed to feel dated already. Watching it again, I felt that the feathered, threatening figure of Birdman spoke for me when he said to Riggan, \"How did we end up here? This place is horrible.\"\n\nDirected by: Michael Anderson\n\nWritten by: James Poe, John Farrow, and S.J. Perelman\n\nThe other Oscars it won: Poe, Farrow, and Perelman (Best Adapted Screenplay); Lionel Lindon (Best Cinematography – Color); Gene Ruggiero and Paul Weatherwax (Best Film Editing); Victor Young (Best Score – Dramatic or Comedy)\n\nWhat it beat for Best Picture: Friendly Persuasion, Giant, The King and I, The Ten Commandments\n\nThis damn movie is three hours long. It also features horrifyingly cringe-inducing ethnic stereotypes from, you know, around the world. But if you are in bed sick with the flu, and this movie is on, you can have fun looking for the crazy cameos, which include Marlene Dietrich and Frank Sinatra, as you slip in and out of consciousness. And in that respect, the movie represents the wrangling achievements of Mike Todd, the producer (of Elizabeth Taylor husband fame). The 1957 Oscars is also notable for two dubious reasons: John Ford's The Searchers was nominated for zero awards, and the Hollywood blacklist hung over the screenwriting categories. (Both Dalton Trumbo and Michael Wilson, blacklisted writers, were nominated, and could not receive credit.)\n\nDirected by: Guillermo del Toro\n\nWritten by: Guillermo del Toro and Vanessa Taylor\n\nThe other Oscars it won: del Toro (Best Director); Paul D. Austerberry, Jeffrey A. Melvin, Shane Vieau (Best Production Design); Alexandre Desplat (Best Original Score)\n\nWhat it beat for Best Picture: Call Me by Your Name, Darkest Hour, Dunkirk, Get Out, Lady Bird, Phantom Thread, The Post, Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri\n\nIn a movie released a few months before the 2018 Academy Awards, audiences saw Sally Hawkins' character plummet into the water. As she is submerged in the murky deep, she grips the hand of her not-quite-human loved one and stares into his eyes. They're imperiled, but connected. It's an intimate, wordless moment between two characters who love each other as they find salvation. And that scene — though it also describes the final sequence in 2017's Best Picture winner — is in the wonderful Paddington 2. As for The Shape of Water...meh! The interspecies romance between Elisa (Hawkins), who is mute, and an unnamed amphibian-man referred to as the Asset (Doug Jones), wants to be a pastiche of ideas — about the Cold War, about the sinister side of early 1960s America, about otherness — wrapped up in del Toro's always gorgeous aesthetics. The film succeeds on one of those levels: The look of The Shape of Water, with cinematographer Dan Laustsen's camera work doused in aquatic blue-gray hues, is a reason enough to see the movie — once! And most of the performances — Hawkins, Richard Jenkins (as Giles, Elisa's gay neighbor), Octavia Spencer (as Zelda, Elisa's fellow janitor at a Baltimore lab where the Asset has been taken) — are strong. Jones, who acts with his whole body while encased in the Asset costume, is a wonder. (Michael Shannon as the super-evil government official in charge of the Asset is too much of a moustache-twirling villain for my taste, but it's a very Shannon-y performance, so devotees may love it.) But if not for the depth they’re given by Spencer and Jenkins, the chatty (practically sassy!) Zelda and tragic Giles would otherwise be flat, if not caricaturish. And the higher aspirations of this movie — to be a sci-fi thriller, a vessel for bigger themes — never bear out. As a romance, once you get past the novelty of Elisa and the Asset totally doing it — which isn't nothing! — The Shape of Water is empty. And so slow. But hey, it could have been worse: Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri could have won instead!\n\nDirected by: Bruce Beresford\n\nWritten by: Alfred Uhry\n\nThe other Oscars it won: Uhry (Best Adapted Screenplay); Jessica Tandy (Best Actress); Manlio Rocchetti, Lynn Barber, and Kevin Haney (Best Makeup)\n\nWhat it beat for Best Picture: Born on the Fourth of July, Dead Poets Society, Field of Dreams, My Left Foot\n\nThere are, naturally, exceptions to what I'm about to assert: But the '80s were a total mess, movie-wise. And Oscars-wise. Driving Miss Daisy is an example of a film of the time that was well-reviewed (check out Roger Ebert's loving words for it here) and had wonderful performances (both Jessica Tandy and Morgan Freeman were great, of course). But its racial politics do not work anymore, and this movie is not \"Best.\" (Before you say that the Oscars rarely are the \"Best,\" and look at this whole list, and what do I expect? Yes, I agree. But let's just agree to hold the Academy to the standards of the best movies on this list, or else why take the Academy Awards seriously at all? Onward!)\n\nDirected by: Ron Howard\n\nWritten by: Akiva Goldsman\n\nThe other Oscars it won: Howard (Best Director); Goldsman (Best Adapted Screenplay); Jennifer Connelly (Best Supporting Actress)\n\nWhat it beat for Best Picture: Gosford Park, In the Bedroom, The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring, Moulin Rouge\n\nThe year 2001 saw the releases of a number of movies I prefer over A Beautiful Mind — including the first Lord of the Rings and Gosford Park, which were nominated, and Memento, which was not. But one notable thing about this year was what A Beautiful Mind went through during Oscar season, which included lots of stories about John Nash, the real man whom Russell Crowe played in the movie. There were pieces about him being an anti-Semite and bisexual, all of which were likely disseminated to diminish the movie's chances of winning. (Read this New York Times story if you're interested in knowing more.) Clearly, it didn't work.\n\nDirected by: Robert Zemeckis\n\nWritten by: Eric Roth\n\nThe other Oscars it won: Zemeckis (Best Director); Roth (Best Adapted Screenplay); Tom Hanks (Best Actor); Arthur Schmidt (Best Film Editing); Ken Ralston, George Murphy, Stephen Rosenbaum, and Allen Hall (Best Visual Effects)\n\nWhat it beat for Best Picture: Four Weddings and a Funeral, Pulp Fiction, Quiz Show, The Shawshank Redemption\n\nWhile there are plenty of movies I dislike more than Forrest Gump, I can't think of many that I found to be as culturally damaging. And not because the whole country was saying things like, \"Stupid is as stupid does\" for a few years. (Which was awful.) But because telling the story of American upheaval during Vietnam and the Civil Rights movement through the perspective of a Southern white man with an IQ of 75, Forrest Gump managed to distill the most important, meaningful, brave, countercultural things that happened in the second half of the 20th century into some fast-food-like McRevolution, packaged and sold so that everyone (even Forrest!) could understand. And when I start thinking about the Jenny character (played by Robin Wright), the promiscuous, drug-addicted hippie who contracts an illness the movie chooses not to name as AIDS for some reason, I freak out. It's hard to play a character as exaggerated as Forrest, and while someone like Dustin Hoffman pulls it off in Rain Man, Tom Hanks — who is often nuanced — falls into immediate caricature. So why is Forrest Gump not ranked even lower, then? Because it provoked fruitful conversations, no matter how maddening it is — and that is a gift movies packed with ideas give us, even if I find those ideas repellent. Beating Pulp Fiction, though? I mean, of course it did. But come on. (And I'm sure partisans of The Shawshank Redemption have some things to say about the 1995 Oscars as well.)\n\nDirected by: Vincente Minnelli\n\nWritten by: Alan Jay Lerner\n\nThe other Oscars it won: Lerner (Best Screenplay); Alfred Gilks and John Alton (Best Cinematography – Color); Cedric Gibbons, Preston Ames, Edwin B. Willis, and Keogh Gleason (Best Art Direction – Color); Orry-Kelly, Walter Plunkett, and Irene Sharaff (Best Costume Design – Color); Johnny Green and Saul Chaplin (Best Score — Musical)\n\nWhat it beat for Best Picture: Decision Before Dawn, A Place in the Sun, Quo Vadis, A Streetcar Named Desire\n\nThe music, by George and Ira Gershwin, is, of course, still wonderful. Any time Gene Kelly is dancing on screen, all is right with the world. And the movie's famous closing, an 18-minute musical number, is impressive and daring. Yet there's something sour about An American in Paris — perhaps Kelly's character didn't always seem like such a jerk, but he does to modern eyes. It was a shock at the time that this movie won Best Picture, given that it was up against A Place in the Sun and A Streetcar Named Desire. Those movies have aged better than this one has, and so has the similar Kelly classic Singin' in the Rain, which came out a year later.\n\nDirected by: John Ford\n\nWritten by: Philip Dunne\n\nThe other Oscars it won: Ford (Best Director); Donald Crisp (Best Supporting Actor); Atrhur C. Miller (Best Cinematography – Black and White); Richard Day, Nathan Juran, and Thomas Little (Best Art Direction – Black and White)\n\nWhat it beat for Best Picture: Blossoms in the Dust, Citizen Kane, Here Comes Mr. Jordan, Hold Back the Dawn, The Little Foxes, The Maltese Falcon, One Foot in Heaven, Sergeant York, Suspicion\n\nBecause How Green Was My Valley beat Citizen Kane at the 1942 Oscars, it is often called one of the worst Best Pictures of all-time. The anger is understandable — and The Maltese Falcon is also a better movie than How Green Was My Valley. But it was directed by John Ford. And features little Roddy McDowell! As a result, scientists have proven that How Green Was My Valley is, in fact, the 31st worst Best Picture of all-time. (I am the \"scientists\" in this instance using methods that I will reveal in a study to be made public at a future date.)\n\nDirected by: Sam Mendes\n\nWritten by: Alan Ball\n\nThe other Oscars it won: Mendes (Best Director); Ball (Best Original Screenplay); Kevin Spacey (Best Actor); Conrad L. Hall (Best Cinematography)\n\nWhat it beat for Best Picture: The Cider House Rules, The Green Mile, The Insider, The Sixth Sense\n\nMy friend David Jefferson has a theory that certain actors and actresses are prone to turning into drag queen versions of themselves — in certain roles, their tics get exaggerated, they rely on old tricks, and they go way over the top. Meryl Streep in August: Osage County, for example (though I haven't cleared that one with David). Or Anthony Hopkins in pretty much everything he's done after The Silence of the Lambs. This is all to say that American Beauty is when Kevin Spacey began his drag journey — it lasted years to ill effect (K-PAX, Casino Jack), but now he has put those shade tendencies to good use on House of Cards. From Spacey's narration down to the plastic bag, American Beauty drives a lot of people crazy. (I like it fine.) Note the weak competition.\n\n[Update: This entry was written in 2014, long before Anthony Rapp accused Spacey of making an advance on him when Rapp was 14, effectively ending Spacey's career. Whether there is any appetite whatsoever for audiences to watch Spacey's obsession with a high school girl as it unfolds in American Beauty — well, I doubt it.]\n\nDirected by: Oliver Stone\n\nWritten by: Oliver Stone\n\nThe other Oscars it won: Stone (Best Director); Claire Simpson (Best Film Editing); John K. Wilkinson, Richard D. Rogers, Charles \"Bud\" Grenzbach, and Simon Kaye (Best Sound)\n\nWhat it beat for Best Picture: Children of a Lesser God, Hannah and Her Sisters, The Mission, A Room With a View\n\nHaving little to do with the movie itself, Platoon hasn't aged well. Oliver Stone has become a strange figure in American pop culture, and it's hard to watch Charlie Sheen in anything these days. Platoon also was not universally beloved upon its release — the Variety review, for instance, refers to Sheen's voiceover in the letters he writes home as \"simpy narration,\" and says the movie doesn't go far enough. Also, as we now know better than we did then, Stone does not have a light touch. But as a release during the hawkish Reagan '80s, Platoon gave audiences something to think about, and the acting, especially Willem Dafoe and Tom Berenger, was strong and evocative. It's also worth mentioning that in the bleak desert where the '80s and the Oscars converged, the 1987 ceremony featured some good entries. Beyond Platoon's Best Picture rivals, Aliens, The Color of Money, Hoosiers, and Blue Velvet were also in the mix in the major categories.\n\nDirected by: James Cameron\n\nWritten by: James Cameron\n\nThe other Oscars it won: Cameron (Best Director); Russell Carpenter (Best Cinematography); Peter Lamont and Michael Ford (Best Art Direction); Deborah L. Scott (Best Costume Design); Conrad Buff, Cameron, and Richard A. Harris (Best Film Editing); James Horner (Best Original Score — Dramatic); Horner and Will Jennings (Best Original Song); Gary Rydstrom, Tom Johnson, Gary Summers, Mark Ulano (Best Sound); Tom Bellfort and Christopher Boyes (Best Sound Effects Editing); Robert Legato, Mark Lasoff, Thomas L. Fisher, and Michael Kanfer (Best Visual Effects)\n\nWhat it beat for Best Picture: As Good as It Gets, The Full Monty, Good Will Hunting, L.A. Confidential\n\nThe hardest movies to write about are the ones that have changed for you over the years. I saw Titanic the day it opened, in a packed — and emotionally packed — theater in New York City on a freezing December day. It was, I'm not embarrassed to say, a magical experience. The movie is a massive spectacle, and the story is epic. I cried more than once. Upon repeated viewings, on smaller screens, and with the phenomenon of Titanic (as opposed to the film Titanic) as a backdrop, the movie's flaws — its terrible, cartoonish screenplay — glare. And yet, there will always be that first time I saw it. And that was a gift.\n\nDirected by: Tom McCarthy\n\nWritten by: Josh Singer and Tom McCarthy\n\nThe other Oscars it won: Singer and McCarthy (Best Original Screenplay)\n\nWhat it beat for Best Picture: The Big Short, Bridge of Spies, Brooklyn, Mad Max: Fury Road, The Martian, The Revenant, Room\n\nAlejandro González Iñárritu's The Revenant was the Best Picture favorite all throughout awards season until the week before the Oscars, when some pundits switched their predictions and correctly called it for Spotlight. Hallelujah, and what a relief! There is a lot to appreciate about The Revenant: Iñárritu's huge scope and ambition, Leonardo DiCaprio's undaunted Best Actor–winning performance, and Tom Hardy's over-the-top villain, Fitzgerald. It's all very big. Spotlight, on the other hand, is understated and precise. It's a step-by-step, practically surgical look at how the Boston Globe's investigative team, known as Spotlight, not only uncovered dozens of pedophiliac priests in the Boston area, but — more importantly — implicated the powerful archbishop of the city in their investigation. Cardinal Bernard Law, a pillar of the city, was directly complicit in coverups and payoffs, in shuffling the pedophiles from one parish to another, and in overseeing the mechanisms that concealed (and therefore allowed) these hideous crimes against children. Spotlight's plot is sensational by nature, but the movie is never garish or exploitative — director Tom McCarthy treats even the attacks of Sept. 11, which interrupted the group's reporting, with subtlety. The ensemble acting (which won a SAG Award) is triumphant, with the main cast — Michael Keaton, Rachel McAdams, Mark Ruffalo, Brian d'Arcy James, Liev Schreiber, and John Slattery — delivering quiet (with the exception of Ruffalo!) and realistic performances as dogged journalists (in pleated pants, no less). But the casting excellence doesn't stop there: There's Stanley Tucci as the slightly unhinged lawyer who sets off the movie's course of events with his lawsuits against one priest; there's Billy Crudup as a fancy lawyer who's made a cottage industry out of sex abuse settlements; there's Paul Guilfoyle as a dead-eyed Catholic Church spokesman who tries to use his influence to chill the investigation; and there are Michael Cyril Creighton and Jimmy LeBlanc — neither of whom I'd ever seen before — as survivors. Even Richard Jenkins, playing a former priest who is an expert on abuse in the Catholic Church, is excellent — and he's only heard on the phone, for god's sake! What I mean is: Every tiny piece of Spotlight works together to make a satisfying, propulsive whole. Rewatch it now if you want to feel better about the world.\n\nDirected by: Steven Spielberg\n\nWritten by: Steven Zaillian\n\nThe other Oscars it won: Spielberg (Best Director); Zaillian (Best Adapted Screenplay); Allan Starski and Ewa Braun (Best Art Direction); Janusz Kaminski (Best Cinematography); Michael Kahn (Best Film Editing); Christina Smith, Matthew Mungle, and Judy Alexander Cory (Best Makeup); John Williams (Best Original Score)\n\nWhat it beat for Best Picture: The Fugitive, In the Name of the Father, The Piano, The Remains of the Day\n\nSchindler's List is one of the most important movies of the 20th century, and critics are nearly unanimous that it's the best movie ever made about the Holocaust. And probably ever will be. It's certainly a stunning technical and visual achievement for Steven Spielberg. Not coincidentally, it's yielded Spielberg his only Best Picture Oscar (so far). And Liam Neeson, who was not well known when the movie came out, grounds the movie. If you're looking for a dissenting voice on Schindler's List, do read Liel Leibovitz's 2011 essay in Tablet in which he dissects the movie's flaws: that the Jewish characters \"do not matter\"; that the villain, Amon Goeth (Ralph Fiennes), is \"otherworldly\" (like the shark in Jaws) instead of a realistic, ordinary person; and that it's troubling that the only movie most people will ever see about the Holocaust is about life instead of death.\n\nDirected by: Peter Jackson\n\nWritten by: Fran Walsh, Philippa Boyens, and Peter Jackson\n\nThe other Oscars it won: Jackson (Best Director); Walsh, Boyens, and Jackson (Best Adapted Screenplay); Grant Major, Dan Hennah, and Alan Lee (Best Art Direction); Ngila Dickson and Richard Taylor (Best Costume Design); Jamie Selkirk (Best Film Editing); Peter King and Taylor (Best Makeup); Howard Shore (Best Original Score); Walsh, Shore, and Annie Lennox (Best Original Song); Christopher Boyes, Michael Semanick, Michael Hedges, and Hammond Peek (Best Sound Mixing); Jim Rygiel, Joe Letteri, Randall William Cook, and Alex Funke (Best Visual Effects)\n\nWhat it beat for Best Picture: Lost in Translation, Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World, Mystic River, Seabiscuit\n\nHas the legacy of Peter Jackson's superlative Lord of the Rings trilogy been tainted by his mediocre Hobbit trilogy? I feel that way myself but don't know how widespread that sentiment is. These movies really are ambitious wonderments, and though the first two were nominated for Best Picture, it apparently took the Academy two years of voting to get used to the idea of it winning. And then they really went crazy: The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King was nominated for 11 awards and won every single one for the biggest sweep in Oscars history.\n\nDirected by: William Friedkin\n\nWritten by: Ernest Tidyman\n\nThe other Oscars it won: Friedkin (Best Director); Tidyman (Best Adapted Screenplay); Gene Hackman (Best Actor); Gerald B. Greenberg (Best Film Editing)\n\nWhat it beat for Best Picture: A Clockwork Orange, Fiddler on the Roof, The Last Picture Show, Nicholas and Alexandra\n\nPopeye Doyle, the vicious and single-minded cop determined to bring down a heroin ring, is the defining role of Gene Hackman's long career as a character actor. But he was the lead here, and was rewarded for it. The French Connection is propulsive, and is defined by the car-versus-subway chase scene, though to see the movie now, you may not be as impressed since William Friedkin's direction of it has been imitated for more than 40 years. That's OK, though: The movie stands on its own merits, even if seems like an odd Oscar movie to us. (Do you think A Clockwork Orange should have won here? There are certainly lots of people who do.)\n\nDirected by: William Wyler\n\nWritten by: Robert E. Sherwood\n\nThe other Oscars it won: Wyler (Best Director); Sherwood (Best Adapted Screenplay); Fredric March (Best Actor); Harold Russell (Best Supporting Actor); Daniel Mandell (Best Film Editing); Hugo Friedhofer (Best Original Score – Dramatic or Comedy); Russell (Honorary Award)\n\nWhat it beat for Best Picture: Henry V, It’s a Wonderful Life, The Razor’s Edge, The Yearling\n\nThere are movies like Gentleman's Agreement that try to address the wounds of World War II and fail to. And then there is The Best Years of Our Lives. This gutsy story about three veterans of the war who've returned home physically and psychologically damaged is touching, and rarely dogmatic despite how recently the war had ended. One Oscars oddity about this movie: Harold Russell, who plays Homer Parrish, was not an actor, but a veteran who had lost both of his hands in the war. He won Best Supporting Actor and a special Oscar \"for bringing hope and courage to his fellow veterans through his appearance in The Best Years of Our Lives.\"\n\nDirected by: George Cukor\n\nWritten by: Alan Jay Lerner\n\nThe other Oscars it won: Cukor (Best Director); Rex Harrison (Best Actor); Gene Allen, Cecil Beaton, and George James Hopkins (Best Art Direction – Color); Harry Stradling (Best Cinematography – Color); Cecil Beaton (Best Costume Design – Color); Warner Bros. Studio Sound Department and George R. Groves (Best Sound); André Previn (Best Score — Adaptation or Treatment)\n\nWhat it beat for Best Picture: Becket, Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb, Mary Poppins, Zorba the Greek\n\nTo express his enthusiasm for My Fair Lady, Roger Ebert aped its premise, writing, \"It is unnecessary to summarize the plot or list the songs; if you are not familiar with both, you are culturally illiterate, although in six months I could pass you off as a critic at Cannes, or even a clerk in a good video store, which requires better taste.\" Just under three hours, George Cukor's adaptation of the musical does sweep you up. And with distance coupled with the pervasive non-singing era in which we live, we can now appreciate Audrey Hepburn, whose Eliza was under great scrutiny because Hepburn was not Julie Andrews (who played the character on stage) and because she did not sing the songs herself. What an odd time 1964 was to yield both this old Hollywood Warner Bros. production and Stanley Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove.\n\nDirected by: Franklin J. Schaffner\n\nWritten by: Francis Ford Coppola and Edmund H. North\n\nThe other Oscars it won: Schaffner (Best Director); Coppola and North (Best Screenplay); George C. Scott (Best Actor); Urie McCleary, Gil Parrondo, Antonio Mateos, and Pierre-Louis Thevenet (Best Art Direction); Hugh S. Fowler (Best Film Editing); Douglas Williams and Don Bassman (Best Sound)\n\nWhat it beat for Best Picture: Airport, Five Easy Pieces, Love Story, M*A*S*H\n\nThere are a few movies on this list that I've noted have been forgotten; Patton's director, Franklin J. Schaffner, who won Best Director here, and also made The Planet of the Apes, Papillon, The Boys From Brazil, and had a prolific career in television during the Golden Age, is, if not forgotten, then overlooked. Patton is riveting because of George C. Scott's intensity, of course, but also because of Schaffner's choices to make Scott the center of every scene. There's also the movie's signature stunning visual that goes along with Scott's famous speech.\n\nDirected by: Victor Fleming\n\nWritten by: Sidney Howard\n\nThe other Oscars it won: Fleming (Best Director); Howard (Best Adapted Screenplay); Vivien Leigh (Best Actress); Hattie McDaniel (Best Supporting Actress); Ernest Haller and Ray Rennahan (Best Cinematography – Color); Lyle R. Wheeler (Best Art Direction); Hal C. Kern and James E. Newcom (Best Film Editing); R.D. Musgrave and Selznick International Pictures (Technical Achievement Award); William Cameron Menzies (Honorary Award)\n\nWhat it beat for Best Picture: Dark Victory, Goodbye, Mr. Chips, Love Affair, Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, Ninotchka, Of Mice and Men, Stagecoach, The Wizard of Oz, Wuthering Heights\n\nWhen we watch Gone With the Wind, we're asked us to put aside both our knowledge of and feelings about the pre-Civil War South (with the movie's troublingly bucolic imagery of plantation culture), and then of and about the Civil War itself. In that way, Gone Wth the Wind shares something with All Quiet on the Western Front, in which the audience identifies with German soldiers from World War I. But you could argue that's what movies are for. Gone With the Wind is a true epic, and time passes for these characters, taking us along with it. It feels massive as you watch it, and it's a credit to Vivien Leigh and Clark Gable they are not dwarfed by the movie itself.\n\nDirected by: Barry Jenkins\n\nWritten by: Barry Jenkins (screenplay by) and Tarell Alvin McCraney (story by)\n\nThe other Oscars it won: Jenkins and McCraney (Best Adapted Screenplay); Mahershala Ali (Best Supporting Actor)\n\nWhat it beat for Best Picture: Arrival, Fences, Hacksaw Ridge, Hell or High Water, Hidden Figures, La La Land, Lion, Manchester by the Sea\n\nIt's difficult to write about a film as lyrically beautiful as Moonlight​, because words ​can't describe the experience of seeing it, which is both emotional and cerebral​.​ Though its ideas​ form an intricate mosaic, its premise is simple, showing the life of a man named Chiron in three parts​. We follow him​ as a child (Alex Hibbert),​ saddled with the terrible nickname \"Little,\" and bullied into monosyllabism​​; then as​ a teenager (Ashton Sanders),​ still being bullied​, and further burdened by his mother's drug addiction; and then as a​ bulked-up​ adult (Trevante Rhodes)​, wearing his new body like it's armor​​. In the story's first segment, his mother, Paula (Naomie Harris), is largely absent — first because she works too much, then because she becomes an addict — but he's shown kindness by a drug power broker named Juan (Mahershala Ali, who won Best Supporting Actor because there is some justice in the world) and Juan's girlfriend, Teresa (compassionately played by Janelle Monáe). They take Chiron in to the extent they can (and that Paula will allow). There's also a boy, Kevin (played by Jaden Piner at first, then by Jharrel Jerome, and finally by André Holland), who is almost Chiron's friend, and with whom he has a tender sexual experience as a teenager — but then circumstances and Kevin's need to please force them apart, which sets an unfortunate new path for Chiron. When Chiron and Kevin reunite in Moonlight's final chapter, you realize you've actually been watching a love story among the other things Moonlight is, and it's a glorious, gratifying surprise. Chiron's reconciliation with Paula is also masterfully acted by Harris (who earned a Best Supporting Actress nomination) and by Rhodes, whose single tear running down his cheek says all the words Chiron can't. In addition to Ali's win and (obviously) Best Picture, Moonlight won Best Adapted Screenplay for Tarell Alvin McCraney ​(it's based on his play In Moonlight Black Boys Look Blue) and Barry Jenkins, who also directed the film. Jenkins should have won Best Director — he constructed a stunning work of art — but that award went to La La Land's Damien Chazelle, and I will bite my tongue here. (Cinematographer James Laxton should have won as well — his camera composed a painting — but that Oscar also went to La La Land. Tongue! Still being bitten!) The ridiculous envelope mix-up that led to Faye Dunaway and Warren Beatty mistakenly announcing that La La Land had won Best Picture was a mess. But the good thing about it is that the audience will always remember that Moonlight — which documents so many parts of the American experience that have never been on film — won. As it fucking should have. At least one good thing happened in 2017!\n\nDirected by: Steve McQueen\n\nWritten by: John Ridley\n\nThe other Oscars it won: Lupita Nyong'o (Best Supporting Actress), John Ridley (Best Adapted Screenplay)\n\nWhat it beat for Best Picture: American Hustle, Captain Phillips, Dallas Buyers Club, Gravity, Her, Nebraska, Philomena, The Wolf of Wall Street\n\nTwo hours into 12 Years a Slave — with 15 minutes remaining in the movie — there is a scene in which violinist, father, and husband-turned-slave Solomon Northup (Chiwetel Ejiofor) simply thinks in an uninterrupted medium close-up shot. He stands outside and looks around a bit, but mostly, he's just having thoughts the audience isn't privy to. The 90-second scene did not register with me the first time I saw 12 Years a Slave because I had been braced in a tight clench for two hours at that point — I'm sure that when I saw Solomon having a quiet moment, I was terrified about what violence might interrupt him. (Nothing does.) But to watch 12 Years a Slave a second time is to appreciate the movie for its dust particles instead of its mallets. Steve McQueen's vision is precise, and each scene is blocked with exactness, like when the psychotic, drunken slavemaster Epps (Michael Fassbender) greets Solomon and some other returning slaves he had rented to a neighbor, and casually leans on one woman as if she were a dresser. In the now famous scene in which Solomon, who had nearly been lynched, must stand on his tiptoes to avoid being strangled by the noose still around his neck, plantation life goes on behind him, as slaves pretending not to see what’s happening go about their day (except for one woman who gives him water). And then there's the last time we see Patsey (Lupita Nyong'o), Solomon's friend, Epps' obsession, and 12 Years a Slave's picture in the attic (she is the body that wears slavery's horrors). As Solomon sets off with his rescuers, having finally been proven to be a free man, his face is in close-up — and Patsey, left behind and far away in every sense, collapses in the blurry background. But the movie's aforementioned mallets are crucial here too. There have been films about slavery before, but given its importance in world history, surprisingly few. McQueen, who is British, and American screenwriter John Ridley (who adapted Northup's book) took on a massive responsibility with 12 Years a Slave, yet it succeeds in both telling the story of one atypical man and in giving an illuminating glimpse at an entire institution. It's a marvel, and one for the ages.\n\nDirected by: Michael Cimino\n\nWritten by: Deric Washburn\n\nThe other Oscars it won: Cimino (Best Director); Christopher Walken (Best Supporting Actor); Peter Zinner (Best Film Editing); Richard Portman, William McCaughey, Aaron Rochin, and Darin Knight (Best Sound)\n\nWhat it beat for Best Picture: Coming Home, Heaven Can Wait, Midnight Express, An Unmarried Woman\n\nMy colleague — and friend! — Adam B. Vary thinks I am ranking The Deer Hunter too high on this list. He says I think it's better than it is, and that the different segments of The Deer Hunter don't hang together in one great movie. I can see that — but I disagree. Considering how soon after the Vietnam War this movie was released, its perspective was fresh on the damage the war had done to its soldiers, and the results are disjointed and painful. The Russian roulette scenes, so controversial at the time (since they were probably fabricated for the movie), are horrifying to watch; the scene in which Steven (John Savage) is in an underwater cage being bitten by rats is a nightmare. Personally, I think The Deer Hunter is a fearless, glorious mess.\n\nDirected by: Frank Capra\n\nWritten by: Robert Riskin\n\nThe other Oscars it won: Capra (Best Director); Riskin (Best Adapted Screenplay); Clark Gable (Best Actor); Claudette Colbert (Best Actress)\n\nWhat it beat for Best Picture: The Barretts of Wimpole Street, Cleopatra, Flirtation Walk, The Gay Divorcee, Here Comes the Navy, The House of Rothschild, Imitation of Life, One Night of Love, The Thin Man, Viva Villa!, The White Parade\n\nCould It Happened One Night be the most charming movie ever made? As directed by Frank Capra, Claudette Colbert and Clark Gable — playing, respectively, a famous heiress on the run from her controlling father and a surly newspaperman who sees her as his way back into employment — look like they're having more fun than any of us ever will in our lives. Comedy ages worse than drama, but It Happened One Night remains a warm, laugh-out-loud movie. It's as much of a love story between you and the movie as it is between the two lead characters.\n\nDirected by: David Lean\n\nWritten by: Carl Foreman and Michael Wilson\n\nThe other Oscars it won: Lean (Best Director); Alec Guinness (Best Actor); Foreman, Wilson, and Pierre Boulle (Best Adapted Screenplay); Jack Hildyard (Best Cinematography); Peter Taylor (Best Film Editing); Malcolm Arnold (Best Score)\n\nWhat it beat for Best Picture: 12 Angry Men, Peyton Place, Sayonara, Witness for the Prosecution\n\nA different sort of World War II movie from anything else on this list — and there are a bunch, as you have probably noticed — David Lean's Bridge on the River Kwai tells the story of Col. Nicholson, as played by Alec Guinness, who won Best Actor. As a British officer being held in a Japanese POW camp in Burma, Nicholson is tasked with building the titular bridge, but the movie follows his descent into obsessive madness. It's a well-acted, exciting, smart film about how people lose perspective during war, with a thrilling and morally opaque ending. Interestingly, American movies in 1957, and the 1958 Oscars, seemed to be working out some feelings about Japan: Sayonara, in which Marlon Brando plays a pilot in the Korean War who falls in love with a Japanese woman, was The Bridge on the River Kwai's rival in a number of categories.\n\nDirected by: David Lean\n\nWritten by: Robert Bolt and Michael Wilson\n\nThe other Oscars it won: Lean (Best Director); John Box, John Stoll, and Dario Simoni (Best Art Direction – Color); Frederick A. Young (Best Cinematography – Color); Ann Coates (Best Film Editing); Maurice Jarre (Best Substantially Original Score); John Cox, Shepperton Studio Sound Department (Best Sound)\n\nWhat it beat for Best Picture: The Longest Day, The Music Man, Mutiny on the Bounty, To Kill a Mockingbird\n\nTwo David Lean movies in a row here: His Lawrence of Arabia is stunningly beautiful, super long (216 minutes!), and inventively acted. It wouldn't have worked without Peter O'Toole as T.E. Lawrence, even though he didn't win Best Actor. (He lost to Gregory Peck for To Kill a Mockingbird: hard to argue with that.) As an aside, one of my other favorite movies, The Manchurian Candidate, was eligible for the 1963 Oscars — but it was nominated only for Best Editing and Best Supporting Actress (Angela Lansbury, of course).\n\nDirected by: Jonathan Demme\n\nWritten by: Ted Tally\n\nThe other Oscars it won: Demme (Best Director); Anthony Hopkins (Best Actor); Jodie Foster (Best Actress); Tally (Best Adapted Screenplay)\n\nWhat it beat for Best Picture: Beauty and the Beast, Bugsy, JFK, The Prince of Tides\n\nAm I going to get shit for putting this movie so high up? I can't tell — but I also don't care. The Silence of the Lambs is the only thriller ever to win Best Picture, which it did because it was impossible to forget once you saw it, and created an entire genre of popular culture. Jodie Foster as Clarice Starling — the insightful, hard-working, brave F.B.I. agent — was iconic as soon as the movie was released the day before Valentine's Day in 1991. And do I need to say the same about Anthony Hopkins as Hannibal Lecter? Every role, from Brooke Smith as Buffalo Bill's kidnap victim to Ted Levine as Buffalo Bill himself, makes an impression. Jonathan Demme's direction is sharply terrifying (recall the scene when the F.B.I. is about to raid what they think is Buffalo Bill's house), but also beautiful (the splayed body in the cage). And he never lets the audience forget that Clarice is literally surrounded by men. Released in a different time for LGBT representation — as in, there was none — The Silence of the Lambs was troubling in 1991. To me, the movie has aged out of that problem, and I love it without hesitation or asterisks.\n\nDirected by: Francis Ford Coppola\n\nWritten by: Francis Ford Coppola and Mario Puzo\n\nThe other Oscars it won: Coppola (Best Director); Coppola and Puzo (Best Adapted Screenplay); Robert De Niro (Best Supporting Actor); Dean Tavoularis, Angelo P. Graham, and George R. Nelson (Best Art Direction); Nino Rota and Carmine Coppola (Best Original Score)\n\nWhat it beat for Best Picture: Chinatown, The Conversation, Lenny, The Towering Inferno\n\nThere are plenty of people who would rank The Godfather Part II over the original. I hear them, but I am not among them. Its highs are high, for sure: the increasing corruption and isolation of Michael Corleone (Al Pacino); the flashbacks to Robert De Niro as young Vito; the downfall of Fredo (John Cazale); Talia Shire's heartbreaking scene as Connie in which she begs Michael to forgive Fredo; and Lee Strasberg's turn as Hyman Roth. If you wanted to argue about it being better than The Godfather, let's have a drink and do that; I am here. As far as the Oscars go, The Godfather Part II is the only sequel to a Best Picture-winner to go on to win Best Picture also. And Coppola won Best Director, which he did not for the original. The score also won for Part II, which, as basically another character in the movie, was something that should have happened in the first place. Also: Check out the amazing competition in the 1975 Academy Awards above! The Best Picture category didn't even include François Truffaut's Day for Night or John Cassavetes' A Woman Under the Influence (Coppola beat both for Best Director). One whine: Though De Niro won for Best Supporting Actor, Cazale was not even nominated.\n\nDirected by: Michael Curtiz\n\nWritten by: Julius J. Epstein, Philip G. Epstein, and Howard Koch\n\nThe other Oscars it won: Curtiz (Best Director); Epstein, Epstein, and Koch (Best Screenplay)\n\nWhat it beat for Best Picture: For Whom the Bell Tolls, Heaven Can Wait, The Human Comedy, Madame Curie, The More the Merrier, The Ox-Bow Incident, The Song of Bernadette, Watch on the Rhine\n\nCasablanca combines war and romance in what many film fans and historians would argue is the classic American studio movie. The accomplishments of the final film may have been a surprise to those who worked on it — as the now out-of-print book Round Up the Usual Suspects: The Making of Casablanca details — but I guess these things can happen. Everything fell into place here: The screenplay, for instance, has plenty of famous lines, but without Humphrey Bogart saying them, would we remember each one? Please note that Bogart did not win Best Actor — the 1944 trophy went to Paul Lukas for his role as an anti-Nazi crusader in Watch on the Rhine, a movie that, it's safe to say, has not aged as well as Casablanca.\n\nDirected by: Francis Ford Coppola\n\nWritten by: Mario Puzo and Francis Ford Coppola\n\nThe other Oscars it won: Puzo and Coppola (Best Adapted Screenplay);\n\nMarlon Brando (Best Actor)\n\nWhat it beat for Best Picture: Cabaret, Deliverance, The Emigrants, Sounder\n\nThere had been gangster movies before The Godfather, but Coppola opened up an entirely new vein so resonant that real-life mobsters decided to aspire to it. The Godfather is gorgeous to look at and sprawling in its story. It's hard to separate the excellence of this movie from its mythology — Marlon Brando's voice and delivery as Vito Corleone, the horse head in the bed, the excruciating transformation of the reluctant Michael (Al Pacino) from an ordinary young man to a Mafia Don — until you actually begin watching it. Then you're swept away. If you're wondering who beat out Coppola for Best Director, it was Bob Fosse for Cabaret; and if you can't imagine who dared win over Pacino for Best Supporting Actor (and James Caan and Robert Duvall, also in the same category), it was also someone from Cabaret: Joel Grey (a classic performance as the Master of Ceremonies).\n\nDirected by: Joseph L. Mankiewicz\n\nWritten by: Joseph L. Mankiewicz\n\nThe other Oscars it won: Mankiewicz (Best Director); Mankiewicz (Best Screenplay); George Sanders (Best Supporting Actor); Edith Head and Charles LeMaire (Best Costume Design – Black and White); Thomas T. Moulton, 20th Century-Fox Studio Sound Department (Best Sound Recording)\n\nWhat it beat for Best Picture: Born Yesterday, Father of the Bride, King Solomon's Mines, Sunset Blvd.\n\nAll About Eve is a character study of both Eve Harrington (Anne Baxter) and Margo Channing (Bette Davis), and it is perfect. The two women's roles created lasting archetypes: Eve is the backstabbing climber, and Margo is the aging viper whose secret kindness and vulnerability is matched only by her need for the world to revolve around her. Mankiewicz's dialogue — he based the screenplay on a short story by Mary Orr that had been published in Cosmopolitan — is sharp and memorable; the actors' deliveries of it, especially from Davis' mouth, give the movie a pace and sound that works as well now as it did in 1950. It's an examination of women's (rightful) fears about getting older, a glamorous look at post-World War II New York theater society, and the perils of ambition without morality. George Saunders, who plays the vicious \"fishwife\" critic Addison DeWitt, is another of the movie's famous characters, and his motives are complicated and opaque as he hones in on Eve. (Chew on this, from Addison to Eve: \"You're an improbable person, Eve, and so am I. We have that in common. Also a contempt for humanity, an inability to love and be loved, insatiable ambition, and talent. We deserve each other.\") Looking back, it's fascinating that All About Eve and Sunset Blvd., with their similar themes, were released the same year, and there are plenty of people who would argue that Billy Wilder's movie is the better one: I love both! What I don't love, though, is that Davis did not win Best Actress for her portrayal of Margo. Since she and Baxter were both nominated in the category — the first time at that point that two actresses from the same movie faced each other — it's likely that they split the All About Eve vote, and Judy Holliday won for Born Yesterday instead. As Margo would say, it's funny business, a woman's career. At least the Academy got it right on Best Picture — one of the best ever made."
