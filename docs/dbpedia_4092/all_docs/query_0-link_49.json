        "text": "Nicholas Ray\n\n(Galesville, Wisconsin, USA, 1911-New York, USA, 1979)\n\nHis real name was Raymond Nicholas Kienzle\n\nand after dropping out of the University of Chicago\n\nhe studied at Frank Lloyd Wright’s Taliesin\n\nFellowship thanks to the support of his professor,\n\nThornton Wilder. In 1930 he married Jean Evans\n\nand ten years later he divorced her. In 1934 he\n\nmoved to New York, where he began to collaborate\n\nwith the theatrical company Theatre of Action\n\nand came into contact with Elia Kazan, with\n\nwhom he collaborated in 1945 on the film A Tree\n\nGrows in Brooklyn, in which he also appears.\n\nAfter moving to Hollywood he directed his first film\n\nfor RKO right as it was changing over into Howard\n\nHughes’ hands, an event that postponed the release\n\nof They Live by Night (1948) by two years. He met\n\nhis second wife, Gloria Grahame, on the set of\n\nA Woman’s Secret (1949). He was able to avoid\n\nbeing put on Senator Joseph McCarthy’s black list\n\nthanks to the protection of Howard Hughes and\n\nin the following years he made numerous films for\n\nRKO, including Flying Leathernecks, starring John\n\nWayne, On Dangerous Ground and The Lusty\n\nMen, starring Robert Mitchum. During that same\n\nperiod he also directed Knock on Any Door and\n\nIn a Lonely Place for Humphrey Bogart’s\n\nindependent production company, Santana Pictures\n\nCorporation. After leaving RKO, in 1954 he shot\n\nJohnny Guitar, starring Joan Crawford and Sterling\n\nHayden. This film was much appreciated by the\n\ncritics of “Cahiers du cinéma,” who right from the\n\nstart put Nicholas Ray on their list of directors of\n\nnote (there is a famous quote by Godard regarding\n\nBitter Victory, “Nicholas Ray is cinema”). The next\n\nyear he obtained his greatest commercial success\n\nwith Rebel Without a Cause, which marked the\n\ndefinitive rise to stardom of James Dean, who died\n\nin a car accident one month before the film was\n\nreleased. During the second half of the Fifties he\n\ndirected films such as Bigger Than Life (1956),\n\nproduced by and starring James Mason, The True\n\nStory of Jesse James (1957) and Party Girl (1958),\n\nstarring Cyd Charisse. In 1958 he married Betty\n\nUtey and three years later made the blockbuster\n\nKing of Kings; after surviving a heart attack during\n\nthe filming of 55 Days at Peking (1963), he was\n\nmarginalized by the Hollywood film industry.\n\nBurdened by health problems, alcoholism and drug\n\naddiction, during the early Seventies he taught at\n\nthe Harpur College of Arts and Sciences in New\n\nYork, where he and his students shot a film entitled\n\nWe Can’t Go Home Again; a working copy of the\n\nfilm was projected at the 1973 Cannes Film Festival.\n\nIn the same period he met Susan Schwartz who\n\nthen became his fourth wife. In 1974 he shot\n\nan episode of the erotic film Wet Dreams.\n\nThree years later Ray played a little role in The\n\nAmerican Friend by Wim Wenders and in 1979\n\nin Hair by Milos Forman. With Wenders he also\n\ncollaborated on the film Lightning over Water,\n\na chronicle of his last days; Nicholas Ray died\n\nbefore the film was completed.\n\nFILMOGRAFIA"
