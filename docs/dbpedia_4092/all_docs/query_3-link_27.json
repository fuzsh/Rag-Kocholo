        "text": "Oct 21 - Tenzin Phuntsog\n\nTenzin Phuntsog is a Tibetan-American artist living and working between San Francisco and New York and working with the mediums of film, installation, multi-media, and performance. He works primarily as an artist and director, and lenses his own hybrid projects. In his work, Phuntsog, who has had his repeated attempts to enter his ancestral home denied, confronts his existence in a state of exile. The practice touches into themes of presence and belonging as well as landscape and language. His works have previously exhibited and screened at The Rubin Museum, New York; Anthology Film Archives, New York; The Eye Filmmuseum, Amsterdam, The Netherlands; Galerie Vermelho, São Paulo, Brazil; Video Brasil, São Paulo, Brazil; among others. Recent Fellowships and residencies include a Marble House residency (2022), NARS Residency (2021), and a Flaherty Fellowship (2019). Tenzin Phuntsog received a BA in Media Arts from the University of California, Los Angeles and an MFA in Visual Arts from Columbia University in New York.\n\nhttps://tenzinprojects.com/\n\nNov 4 - Cecelia Condit\n\nPresenting Cecelia Condit with the Vision Award. Since 1981, Condit’s videos have created heroines whose lives swing between beauty and the grotesque, innocence and cruelty, youth and fragility. Her work puts a subversive spin on the traditional mythology of women in film and the psychology of sexuality and violence. Exploring the dark side of female subjectivity, her “feminist fairy tales” focus on friendships, age, and the natural world. She has shown internationally in festivals, museums and alternative spaces, and is represented in collections including the Museum of Modern Art in NYC, the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis, Minnesota and Centre Georges Pompidou Musee National d'Art Moderne, Paris, France. She has received numerous film festival awards, and grants from the Guggenheim Foundation, American Film Institute, National Endowment for the Arts, and the Mary L. Nohl Foundation. She’s a professor emerita in the Department of Film, Video, Animation & New Genres at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, where she was the director of the graduate program in film for 30-years.\n\nhttps://www.ceceliacondit.com/"
