        "text": "A Century of Film\n\nCinematography\n\nCinematography has always been recognized as one of the most important aspects of film-making. It was one of the original Tech categories at the very first Academy Awards and is the only Tech category to remain since that initial awards. While film encompasses many things, it is primarily a visual medium and the look of the film, the way we sees things as they come through from the camera is one of the most important aspects of it. Hell, that was obvious right from the start, in 1903, when Edwin S. Porter had the cowboy fire the gun towards the camera and even before that when trains were filmed coming towards the camera, frightening people in the cinema in 19th Century.\n\nI won’t cover the whole history of Cinematography because a lot of this is covered among a few of the listed cinematographers listed below and in the history bits for each of the various awards.\n\nMy Top 5 Cinematography Jobs in Film History:\n\nLawrence of Arabia\n\nThe Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring\n\nThe Godfather\n\nCitizen Kane\n\nDoctor Zhivago\n\nThe other 9 Point Films (chronological):\n\nSunrise\n\nM\n\nThe Wizard of Oz\n\nThe Grapes of Wrath\n\nCitizen Kane\n\nThe Maltese Falcon\n\nChildren of Paradise\n\nLa Belle et la Bete\n\nGreat Expectations\n\nThe Third Man\n\nSunset Blvd.\n\nA Streetcar Named Desire\n\nRashomon\n\nSeven Samurai\n\nThe Bridge on the River Kwai\n\nTouch of Evil\n\nBonnie and Clyde\n\n2001: A Space Odyssey\n\nThe Wild Bunch\n\nCries and Whispers\n\nThe Exorcist\n\nChinatown\n\nThe Godfather Part II\n\nBarry Lyndon\n\nJaws\n\nStar Wars Episode IV: A New Hope\n\nApocalypse Now\n\nAlien\n\nRaging Bull\n\nKagemusha\n\nThe Elephant Man\n\nThe Shining\n\nRaiders of the Lost Ark\n\nExcalibur\n\nFanny & Alexander\n\nA Passage to India\n\nRan\n\nBlood Simple\n\nPlatoon\n\nEmpire of the Sun\n\nThe Last Emperor\n\nGlory\n\nBorn on the Fourth of July\n\nGoodFellas\n\nThe Silence of the Lambs\n\nThe Last of the Mohicans\n\nUnforgiven\n\nSchindler’s List\n\nThe Age of Innocence\n\nThe English Patient\n\nL.A. Confidential\n\nBoogie Nights\n\nSaving Private Ryan\n\nCrouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon\n\nMulholland Drive\n\nThe Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers\n\nGangs of New York\n\nRoad to Perdition\n\nThe Pianist\n\nThe Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King\n\nThe Aviator\n\nHouse of Flying Daggers\n\nA Very Long Engagement\n\nBrokeback Mountain\n\nKing Kong\n\nMunich\n\nPan’s Labyrinth\n\nThere Will Be Blood\n\nAtonement\n\nNo Country for Old Men\n\nThe Dark Knight\n\nnote: I rate all aspects of film on a 9 point scale. They also correspond to the 100 point scale for Best Picture. Films above *** (76-99) all land on the scale. 1 point is for 76-79, just worth mentioning. 2 points is for 80-83, a weak mention, 3 points is for 84-87, near great, 4 points is for 88-89 (which is ****), a solid nominee, 5 points is for 90-91, a very solid nominee, 6 points is for 92-93, a weak winner, a 7 points is for 94-95, a worthwhile winner, 8 points is 96-97, the kind of winner you can’t complain about even if it’s not your #1 choice and 9 points is for 98-99, the very best of all-time. The films on the above list are my 9 point films for Cinematography through 2011, listed chronologically.\n\nnote: The list is a little odd when you think about the Oscars. There are 75 films listed and 22 of them won the Oscar, 24 of them were nominated and 29 of them weren’t even nominated. So we have different tastes, the Academy and I.\n\nMy Single Favorite Shot\n\nAt the end of The Godfather, after he has finished removing all of his enemies from his life, Michael Corleone goes in to see his brother-in-law, the man who arranged the hit on Michael’s older brother. As he sits down, dispensing judgement, the shadow falls across his face and he is half in shadow and half in light. It’s a truly remarkable shot and my single favorite of all-time. Kudos to Gordon Willis for this shot.\n\nMy Single Favorite Take\n\nWhat does it say when my single favorite take in film history doesn’t even win the Nighthawk? It says that it comes from an absolutely amazing year. Which is true, because 2007 was a hell of a year for Cinematography. Overall, from start to finish, my #1 film is There Will Be Blood. But there is the Dunkirk scene in Atonement, to me, the single most astonishing, breath-taking sequence cinematic take ever put on film.\n\nThe Cinematographers\n\nGregg Toland\n\nOne of the great losses to film, when Toland died in his sleep at age 44, just barely older than I am now. On my Absolute Points list, he first appears in 1935 and by 1940, even before Citizen Kane, is #2 and only two points behind #1 and he shoots way above everyone else in 1941. In Nighthawk Points, he was tied for #1 from 1946 to 1972 (and is still in the Top 10), in the Weighted Points, he was #1 from 1941 to 1973 and is still #5. He was so far ahead of his time with his work on The Grapes of Wrath and Citizen Kane that in my Absolute Points list, even though he died at 44, no one came within 50 points of him (the equivalent of a job worthy of an Oscar) until he had been dead for over a decade. I think if he had not died he would still be near the very top.\n\nKey Films: The Grapes of Wrath, Citizen Kane, The Best Years of Our Lives\n\nSven Nykvist\n\nNykvist started working with Ingmar Bergman in 1953 and in the 1960’s would become his regular cinematographer. Eventually, the Academy would realize his greatness and he would win Oscars for Cries and Whispers and Fanny & Alexander and earn a third nomination for The Unbearable Lightness of Being. He makes my list 14 different times just working with Bergman but his mastery of shadows (in black-and-white) and color would also come through in films for Philip Kaufman, Woody Allen, Bob Fosse and Andrei Tarkovsky.\n\nKey Films: Cries and Whispers, Fanny & Alexander, The Unbearable Lightness of Being\n\nConrad L. Hall\n\nHall would earn two early Oscar nominations in the late 60’s for The Professionals and In Cold Blood and then would win the Oscar in 1969 for Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. Thirty years later, while earning some Oscar nominations and doing strong work, he would win another Oscar for American Beauty and then three years later would win a posthumous Oscar for Road to Perdition just three months after he died.\n\nKey Films: Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, American Beauty, Road to Perdition\n\nGordon Willis\n\nHow do you know when you screwed up? When you’re the Cinematography branch of the Academy and an honorary Oscar is given to a man you only nominated twice. Gordon Willis was the defining cinematographer of the 70’s, shooting three Best Picture winners (The Godfather, The Godfather Part II, Annie Hall) not to mention influential films like Klute, All the President’s Men, Interiors and Manhattan. He earns 407 Absolute Points for the decade, the second highest total by any cinematographer in any decade. He received no Oscar nominations during the decade. The idiots in the branch would eventually nominate him for Zelig and The Godfather Part III but the honorary award in 2009 kind of says it all.\n\nKey Films: The Godfather, The Godfather Part II, All the President’s Men\n\nRobert Richardson\n\nBecause his rise began in the mid 80’s, Richardson didn’t finish 1st in Absolute Points in the 80’s or 90’s but he was second in both decades and his 323 points in the latter was the third highest to-date. He has done great work with Oliver Stone (an Oscar, two other nominations) and Martin Scorsese (two Oscars) and Quentin Tarantino (Oscar nom) as well as doing very good work for those same directors that didn’t make the Oscar lists. He’s won four Nighthawks. He’s been nominated by the ASC an astounding ten times and yet has never won.\n\nKey Films: Platoon, Born on the Fourth of July, The Aviator\n\nRoger Deakins\n\nAlmost certainly the most widely respected cinematographer at work today. By the time he is done, I don’t think there’s any question that he will own all the records. Certainly he will be the top director at the ASC, the BAFTAs and the Nighthawks and if he isn’t at the Oscars that’s because until the late 60’s, there were 10 nominees a year instead of 5. He’s most known for working with the Coens, for whom he has earned 5 Oscars nominations as their cinematographer, but he’s actually been Oscar nominated with five different directors.\n\nKey Films: Fargo, The Man Who Wasn’t There, No Country for Old Men\n\nJanusz Kaminski\n\nWhile Deakins seems like a one director cinematographer, Kaminski pretty much is. He’s made my list 12 times and 10 of them are for working with Spielberg. He’s basically been Spielberg’s cinematographer since Schindler’s List, which has earned him two Oscars and two other nominations (plus another for The Diving Bell and the Butterfly).\n\nKey Films: Schindler’s List, Saving Private Ryan, Munich\n\nThe Academy Awards\n\nSummary:\n\nAs I wrote above, Cinematography is one of the original categories from the 1st Academy Awards. It has continued, with only minor changes, all the way to today. From 1939 to 1966 (with the exception of 1957), it was split into Black-and-White and Color categories, the later done too early and the former kept too long. It was often slow to change, not recognizing innovative work from cinematographers like Arthur Edeson, Karl Freund or Gregg Toland, ignoring Gordon Willis almost entirely and being slow to accept foreign cinematographers. But one thing to mention is the work of James Wong Howe, pictured above. Howe, who faced racism and legal difficulties (his marriage to a white woman wasn’t recognized until 1948) was nominated for 10 Oscars at a time when he was one of the very few Asian-Americans working in any of the technical positions in film.\n\nDirectors:\n\nMany directors have directed three films that won Best Cinematography but David Lean tops them all with five films that won (Great Expectations, The Bridge on the River Kwai, Lawrence of Arabia, Doctor Zhivago, Ryan’s Daughter). The only director to win back-to-back in this category is Henry King who won three in a row, sort-of (he won 1942 in Color, 1943 in Black-and-White, 1944 in Color). William Wyler, Mervyn LeRoy and Billy Wilder are tied with the most nominations (11) but they were almost all in the years when there were two categories while Steven Spielberg (tied with Wyler with the most points – 325) has all of his in the later years with only one category (plus he’s still active).\n\nFranchises:\n\nSurprisingly, the first sequel to earn a nomination was Star Trek IV, the only film in the franchise to earn a nomination. It took until the third Godfather film to even earn a nomination. Fellowship of the Ring won the Oscar and then no other film in the franchise even earned a nomination. Yet, the sixth Harry Potter film earned a nomination as have three Batman films, including the widely derided Batman Forever.\n\nGenres:\n\nDrama does account for the most nominations, just barely over half of all the nominations (289 of 575), though it wins considerably more often (65 of 111). The only other genres that even make up 5% of the nominees are Musicals (10.78%), Comedy (8.00%) and War (7.13%). Westerns and Musicals with 8 wins each (7.21%) are the only other winners with more than 5%. Every genre has at least 9 nominees and the only genre without a win is Suspense, surprisingly. Kids won way back in 1946 (The Yearling) and Comedy hasn’t won since the 50’s (The Quiet Man, Around the World in 80 Days). The only years without any Drama films among the nominees are 1967 and 1972.\n\nBest Picture:\n\nThere have been 26 films that won both Picture and Cinematography but it has gone in waves. It happened in 1928, then not again until 1939, but then four straight years, then a gap until 1951, then 11 times from 1951 to 1966 but then not again until 1982 (with three Gordon Willis films not even earning nominations). Six films in the 90’s won both but since then only Slumdog Millionaire has managed it. But many other Picture winners have earned Cinematography nominations. There have been three separate streaks of at least eight straight Picture winners earning at least a Cinematography nomination (1938-45, 1953-62, 1993-2000) and the longest Picture winning streak without a Cinematography nomination is only six years (and since 1938 only four years). In addition to the 55 Picture winners that have earned a Cinematography nomination, another 174 films have earned nominations in both categories. In 1958, when there were two Cinematography categories, all five Picture nominees were nominated for Cinematography and in 2010 when there were 10 Picture nominees, all five Cinematography nominees were among them. Most years have at least two films that overlap and the only year with no Picture nominees among the Cinematography nominees is 2006.\n\nForeign Films:\n\nA Foreign Film would be nominated for Best Picture (1969) before Cinematography (1973). Cries and Whispers finally broke that in 1973, even winning the Oscar. There have now been 18 Foreign language nominees, 10 since 2000 and there have been four winners (Cries, Fanny & Alexander, Crouching Tiger, Pan’s Labyrinth). In 2004, three of the nominees weren’t in English but that does include The Passion of the Christ.\n\nSingle Nominations:\n\nA whopping 83 films have earned a Cinematography nomination with no other nominations. That seems like a lot, but Cinematography has among the most nominations of any category and so that’s only 14.43% of all its nominees which is low for a Tech category. What’s more, only 22 of those have come since 1967 when the two categories were combined into one, so it averages about one every other year. Bizarrely, while only once from 1967 to 2005 were there two such films in one year (1980 – The Blue Lagoon, The Formula), it happened in both 2005 (Batman Begins, A New World) and 2006 (The Black Dahlia, The Illusionist). Only four films with just a Cinematography nomination have won the Oscar, three of them in the first four years of the Oscars and then one last time in 1949 in Color Cinematography (She Wore a Yellow Ribbon).\n\nOther Categories:\n\nAlong with Picture and Director, Cinematography is the other category that every film with at least 12 Oscar nominations has been nominated in. It is a pretty equal opportunity collaborator when it comes to Oscar nominations. The only category that hasn’t been nominated with it is Animated Film and the only non-defunct category with less than 20 overlapping films is Foreign Film (just six). The ones with the most are Art Direction (261 films), Score (233 films) and Picture (229 films). Not only that, but at least one film has won Cinematography and won at least one of every other category. In fact, the only category that doesn’t pair with Cinematography with a film just winning those two awards are Adapted Screenplay (where every film to win both it and Cinematography won at least 5 Oscars), Makeup and Foreign Film. Even Picture (Rebecca), Director (The Quiet Man) and Song (Three Coins in the Fountain) have paired with it. But Art Direction is the most frequent collaborator with people liking the look of a film awarding it in both categories. As I wrote, 261 films have earned nominations in both but also 44 films have won both awards (the next highest pairing with Cinematography is Editing with 28) and a whopping 8 films have won both awards and won no other Oscars. Films with a Cinematography nom have earned just one other nom pairing up with every category except Picture, Director and Sound Editing. As could be guessed, in general, far more films earn 2 nominations than 3 or 4 (more films earn 2 than 3 and 4 combined) but with Cinematography, only 63 films have two nominations while 71 have four and 77 have five. In fact, while over 9 times as many films at the Oscars have received 2 nominations than 10 or more, there have actually been more films to earn 10 or more nominations while earning a Cinematography nomination (70) than 2 nominations.\n\nOscar Nominees I Haven’t Seen:\n\nThe Devil Dancer, 1927-28 (lost film)\n\nThe Magic Flame, 1927-28 (lost film)\n\n4 Devils, 1928-29 (lost film)\n\nThe Right to Love, 1930-31\n\nSand, 1949, Color\n\nThe Academy Awards Top 10:\n\nLeon Shamroy – 550\n\nCharles Lang – 475\n\nRobert Surtrees – 475\n\nHarry Stradling – 450\n\nJoseph Ruttenberg – 350\n\nGeorge Folsey – 325\n\nConrad L. Hall – 325\n\nJames Wong Howe – 300\n\nWilliam V. Skall – 275\n\nVictor Milner / Ray Rennahan / Arthur Miller / Joseph LaShelle – 250\n\nnote: Wins are worth 50 points and nominations are worth 25.\n\nTop 5 Oscar Winners:\n\nLawrence of Arabia\n\nThe Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring\n\nDoctor Zhivago\n\nBarry Lyndon\n\nCries and Whispers\n\nWorst 5 Oscar Winners:\n\nCleopatra (1934)\n\nWilson\n\nShip of Fools\n\nAnna and the King of Siam\n\nAnthony Adverse\n\nTop 5 Oscar Years:\n\n2001 (The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring, The Man Who Wasn’t There, Black Hawk Down, Moulin Rouge, Amelie)\n\n2002 (Road to Perdition, Gangs of New York, The Pianist, Far From Heaven, Chicago)\n\n2005 (Memoirs of a Geisha, Brokeback Mountain, Good Night and Good Luck, Batman Begins, A New World)\n\n2007 (There Will Be Blood, Atonement, No Country for Old Men, The Diving Bell and the Butterfly, The Assassination of Jesse James)\n\n1997 (Titanic, L.A.

In this one, it’s comparing my top five films to the ones the Oscars actually nominated. So, in the first one, it’s how good are the nominees. In this one it’s how good are the nominees compared to what else was eligible.\n\nWorst 3 Oscar Years (Color, 1939-1966) by Oscar Score:\n\n1963 – 0 (Cleopatra, The Cardinal, How the West Was Won, Irma La Douce, It’s a Mad Mad Mad Mad World)\n\n1945 – 0 (Leave Her to Heaven, Anchors Aweigh, National Velvet, A Song to Remember, Spanish Main)\n\n1951 – 6.3 (An American in Paris, David and Bathsheba, Quo Vadis, Show Boat, When Worlds Collide)\n\nWorst 3 Oscar Years (Black and White, 1939-1966) by Oscar Score:\n\n1946 – 0 (Anna and the King of Siam, The Green Years)\n\n1965 – 10.0 (Ship of Fools, King Rat, In Harm’s Way, Morituri, A Patch of Blue)\n\n1948 – 13.3 (The Naked City, A Foreign Affair, I Remember Mama, Johnny Belinda, Portrait of Jennie)\n\nWorst 5 Oscar Years (1928-1938, 1967-2011) by Oscar Score:\n\n1934 – 0 (Cleopatra, The Affairs of Cellini, Operator 13)\n\n1936 – 0 (Anthony Adverse, The General Died at Dawn, The Gorgeous Hussy)\n\n1968 – 12.8 (Romeo and Juliet, Oliver, Star, Funny Girl, Ice Station Zebra)\n\n1930-31 – 13.0 (Tabu, Morocco, Cimarron, The Right to Love, Svengali)\n\n1928-29 – 13.8 (White Shadows in the South Seas, Street Angel, In Old Arizona, The Divine Lady, Our Dancing Daughters, 4 Devils)\n\nnote: 4 Devils is lost. Given that it was directed by F.W. Murnau, there’s a good chance the cinematography is quite good. But I can’t see it. That doesn’t count against the year, though because I only count as many films as I have seen that earned nominations.\n\nTop 5 Films to win the Oscar (based on quality of film not cinematography):\n\nCries and Whispers\n\nBonnie and Clyde\n\nLawrence of Arabia\n\nCrouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon\n\nThe Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring\n\nWorst 5 Films to win the Oscar (based on quality of film not cinematography):\n\nCleopatra (1963)\n\nCleopatra (1934)\n\nThe Towering Inferno\n\nBlood and Sand\n\nThree Coins in the Fountain\n\nWorst 5 Films to earn an Oscar nomination (based on quality of film not cinematography):\n\nThe Silver Chalice\n\nThe Bad Seed\n\nDr. Dolittle\n\nButterfield 8\n\nThe Formula\n\n5 Most Critically Acclaimed Cinematography Jobs Not to Win the Oscar (based on Consensus Awards percentage):\n\nThe Tree of Life\n\nFar From Heaven\n\nChildren of Men\n\nThe Man Who Wasn’t There\n\nThe Thin Red Line\n\n5 Least Critically Acclaimed Cinematography Jobs That Did Win the Oscar:\n\nJFK\n\nLegends of the Fall\n\nA River Runs Through It *\n\nGlory\n\nRomeo and Juliet (1968)\n\nnote: Though A River Runs Through It had a higher percentage than JFK or Legends of the Fall, it is the only Oscar winner to finish lower than 3rd at the Consensus Awards (it finished 4th).\n\n5 Most Critically Acclaimed Cinematography Jobs Not to Earn an Oscar Nomination:\n\nEd Wood\n\nBarton Fink\n\nThe Black Stallion\n\nBlade Runner\n\nWings of Desire\n\nnote: All five of these films won the Consensus Award even without an Oscar nomination.\n\nYears in Which the Worst of the Nominees Won the Oscar:\n\n1934: Cleopatra over The Affairs of Cellini and Operator 13\n\n2009: Avatar over Inglourious Basterds, The Hurt Locker, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince and The White Ribbon\n\nOscar Scores by Decade:\n\n1930’s: 37.7\n\n1940’s: 49.4 (Color) / 41.3 (Black and White)\n\n1950’s: 32.2 (Color) / 46.3 (Black and White)\n\n1960’s: 43.0 (Color) / 34.2 (Black and White) / 31.9 (regular)\n\n1970’s: 44.8\n\n1980’s: 75.5\n\n1990’s: 77.8\n\n2000’s: 84.6\n\n2010’s: 97.2\n\nAll-Time (Regular): 64.8\n\nAll-Time (Color): 41.8\n\nAll-Time (Black and White): 40.9\n\nKudos to the Oscars – the best post 1968 Cinematography Jobs Nominated only by the Oscars:\n\nExcalibur\n\nThe Exorcist\n\nThe French Connection\n\nThe Prestige\n\nThree Colors: Red\n\nThe BAFTAs\n\nSummary:\n\nThough the BAFTAs began in 1947, they would not add a Cinematography category until 1963. To be fair, it was the first Tech category they added (even before they added supporting acting categories). Even though by 1963, there was little reason to distinguish between Black-and-White and Color films, the BAFTAs decided to do just that for the first five years of the category’s existence. I also do not count it towards Consensus awards because for those first five years, the category only acknowledged British films. In 1968, like with other categories, the BAFTAs would normalize the category with four regular nominees (a few years had more but there were still only four cinematographers nominated) and dropping the limitations. It wouldn’t take long for the BAFTAs to agree with the Oscars with both groups giving their award to Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid although that would show a different problem which was that the Oscar was in 1969 and the BAFTA was in 1970, showing how for the first 20 years, the award years often didn’t match up. But, through 1990, the Oscar winner almost always earned a BAFTA nom (only missing two) and would win about every second or third year (8 out of 22). Then there was a strange stretch of four years where three Oscar winners didn’t even earn BAFTA noms (JFK, A River Runs Through It, Legends of the Fall). Since then, every Oscar winner has earned a BAFTA nom though only six of 16 won both awards.\n\nThe early “British” years would help establish three British cinematographers who would stay near the top of the points chart from then all the way through to today: Oswald Morris (three early wins), Geoffrey Unsworth (a win and a nomination, then won the first non-British year for 2001 which he is pictured above filming) and Douglas Slocombe (early win, two other nominations, another nomination in 1968). All three would continue to do strong work through the 70’s, helping them stay at the top. Morris would lead until 1974 when the other two would tie him with 200 points, Unsworth would take over in 1977 and with the exception of three years in the early 80’s, Unsworth and Slocombe would hold a tie for the lead all the way to today, though Roger Deakins, who has done much better at the BAFTAs than the Oscars (winning twice) is quickly moving up.\n\nFranchises:\n\nIndiana Jones and the Temple of Doom was the first sequel to earn a nomination. Since then, Two Towers and Dark Knight both earned nominations while Return of the King won the BAFTA.\n\nGenres:\n\nDrama dominates this award with 45.23% of the nominees (no other category breaks 10%) and 54.55% of the winners. Comedy is next in nominations (9.13%) followed by War (7.88%) but The Artist is the only Comedy to win the award while 5 War films (9.09%) have won. Kids, with 2 nominations, is the only genre with less than 5 nominations. Mystery is the only genre that has never won the award, although several genres have only won once.\n\nBest Picture:\n\nIn the early “British Cinematography” days, there was little overlap with A Man for All Seasons the only Picture winner to even earn a Cinematography nomination. But, starting in 1970, Picture winners generally earned a Cinematography nomination at least. Since then, well over half of all Picture winners haver been nominated for Cinematography and The Queen (2006) is the only Picture winner since 1997 not to earn a nomination in Cinematography. It’s not necessarily likely to win though, with less than half of the Picture winners that earn a Cinematography nomination winning both awards. It’s also much less likely to overlap with the Best British Film category. From 1998 to 2011, 13 Best Picture winners earned a Cinematography nomination while in that same period, only four British Film winners did (one of which was The King’s Speech which won both Picture awards). Since the British Film category was reinstated in 1992, the only film to win both British Film and Cinematography was Elizabeth in 1998.\n\nNot only are Best Picture winners not necessarily going to win Cinematography, but if they don’t, it usually goes to a film that isn’t even nominated for Best Picture. From 1980 to 2005, seven films won both awards. However, only two films in that time won Cinematography while only being nominated for Picture (Amadeus, 1985 and Elizabeth, 1998). It’s an interesting statistical phenomenon. In that stretch, only 47 films (out of 111, 42.3%) were nominated for Cinematography but not Picture but they account for 18 of the 27 winners (66.7%). But, in the six years since then, while the number of Cinematography nominees without a Picture nomination has actually gone up (to 46.7%), only 1 of the 6 winners failed to earn a Picture nomination (Children of Men, 2006).\n\nSingle Nominees:\n\nDuring the five years of the split British awards, 15 films were nominated for Cinematography with no other nomination (though only From Russia with Love, 1963, won the award). In the over 40 years since then, only 16 films have done so, with only two since 1990 (The Man Who Wasn’t There, 2001 and The Road, 2009) although the former is the only other film to win the award with no other nominations.\n\nForeign Films:\n\nThe BAFTAs do better here than the Oscars with 19 Foreign language films earning Cinematography noms. However, while four of these films have won Cinematography, surprisingly, no film has won both Cinematography and Foreign Film. Eleven films have been nominated for both awards and six of those won Foreign Film and three won Cinematography but, amazingly, no film, even Fanny & Alexander (which lost Foreign Film to Danton) has won both.\n\nOther Categories:\n\nLike at the Oscars, Cinematography is most connected to Art Direction. It has the most films nominated for both awards (134 – the next highest is Editing with 114) and the most films to win both awards (15). There has never been consecutive years of a Cinematography winner not being nominated for Art Direction. On the low end are Supporting Actress (34 films nominated for both, only The English Patient won both) and Visual Effects (37 nominated for both, only Return of the King won both).\n\nBAFTA Nominees I Haven’t Seen:\n\nThe Crimson Blade – 1963, British Color\n\nThe BAFTA Top 10:\n\nGeoffrey Unsworth – 325\n\nDouglas Slocombe – 325\n\nOswald Morris – 225\n\nDavid Watkin – 225\n\nRoger Deakins – 225\n\nConrad L.

The other two were bad choices.\n\nnote: I did not include Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland from 1972 because it co-won the award with Cabaret (both were done by Geoffrey UnsworthI and so I’m assuming it was more about Cabaret.\n\nKudos to the BAFTAs – the best Cinematography Jobs Nominated by the BAFTAs but no one else\n\n2001: A Space Odyssey\n\nThe Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers\n\nKagemusha\n\nThe Age of Innocence\n\nThe Elephant Man\n\nThe Broadcast Film Critics Awards (Critics Choice)\n\nSummary:\n\nThis award began in 2000 with an award to Gladiator and then was dropped again until the BFCA expanded their awards in 2009. They twice awarded films that won the Oscar but not the Consensus (Avatar, Inception) then splitting the award in 2011, awarding the film the won the Consensus but not the Oscar (Tree of Life) and a film that was just a nominee for both (War Horse).\n\nLowest Critical Acclaim for a BFCA Winner: War Horse\n\nHighest Critical Acclaim for a BFCA nominee: True Grit\n\nLowest Critical Acclaim for a BFCA nominee: Drive\n\nHighest Critical Acclaim for a BFCA snub: The White Ribbon\n\nBest Cinematography from a BFCA snub: The White Ribbon\n\nThe American Society of Cinematographers Awards\n\nSummary:\n\nThe ASC was at the forefront of the second wave of guild awards. When it began in 1986, it was the fifth guild award to come along but it was the first in a whopping 25 years. It was followed by the PGA just three years later and within a decade of that, almost every guild had its own awards. They were determined from the start to do their own thing. Of the first 8 winners, five of them received no other nominations from any guild and while all 8 were Oscar nominated, only Dances with Wolves won the Oscar, it was the only one to win a critics award, the only one to win the Consensus Award and one of only two to even receive a BAFTA nomination (Empire of the Sun won the BAFTA as well). What’s more, three of those eight don’t even make my Top 10 for the year, so we clearly have different ideas. Even so, through 2011, only six films have won the ASC, Oscar and the BAFTA. They have given much more love to Roger Deakins than the Academy has. They also like Robert Richardson but don’t really, really like him because he has been nominated 10 times and has never won.\n\nLowest Critical Acclaim for an ASC Winner: The Patriot / A Very Long Engagement\n\nHighest Critical Acclaim for an ASC nominee: Schindler’s List\n\nLowest Critical Acclaim for an ASC nominee: The Ghost and the Darkness\n\nHighest Critical Acclaim for an ASC snub: Ed Wood\n\nBest Cinematography from an ASC snub: GoodFellas\n\nBest ASC Nominee Not Nominated by Any Other Group: King Kong\n\nWorst ASC Winner: Blaze\n\nWorst ASC Nominee: Pearl Harbor\n\nThe ASC Top 10:\n\nRoger Deakins – 300\n\nRobert Richardson – 250\n\nConrad L. Hall – 225\n\nJohn Toll – 150\n\nAllen Daviau – 125\n\nJohn Seale – 125\n\nEmmanuel Lubezki – 125\n\nStephen H. Barum – 100\n\nCaleb Deschanel – 100\n\nJanusz Kaminski / Chris Menges / Dion Beebe / Wally Pfister – 100\n\nThe Critics Awards\n\nSummary:\n\nThe critics groups were late to come to Cinematography even though it was the first Tech award given by any of them. The New York Film Critics and National Board of Review began in the early 30’s but the former wouldn’t start giving a Cinematography award until 1980 and the latter still doesn’t give one. The first critics group to do so was actually the National Society of Film Critics in their second awards year in 1967. The LA Film Critics followed suit when they began in 1975 as did Boston in 1980. But thanks to fits and starts, there wouldn’t be five awards in the same year until 1993 and then it skipped 1994.\n\nSweep Winners:\n\n5 of 5 Critics Groups:\n\nFar From Heaven (2002)\n\nThe Tree of Life (2011)\n\n4 of 4 Critics Groups:\n\nThe Killing Fields (1984)\n\nEd Wood (1994)\n\nBig Winners:\n\n4 of 5 Critics Groups:\n\nBarton Fink (1991) – missing BSFC\n\nSchindler’s List (1993) – missing CFC\n\nCrouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (2000) – missing NSFC\n\n3 of 4 Critics Groups:\n\nThe Last Emperor (1987) – missing NSFC\n\nWings of Desire (1988) – missing BSFC\n\nThe Fabulous Baker Boys (1989) – missing NYFC\n\nBest by Group\n\nNYFC: Schindler’s List\n\nLAFC: Barry Lyndon\n\nNSFC: Barry Lyndon\n\nBSFC: Ran\n\nCFC: The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring\n\nWorst by Group\n\nNYFC: Elephant\n\nLAFC: Still Life\n\nNSFC: Diva\n\nBSFC: Safe\n\nCFC: Se7en\n\n5 Most Acclaimed Cinematography Jobs to Not Win Any Critics Awards:\n\nButch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid\n\nCabaret\n\nBraveheart\n\nRoad to Perdition\n\nMemoirs of Geisha\n\nThe Nighthawk Awards\n\nnote: Because my awards go, retroactively, all the way back through 1912, there are a lot more nominees and winners than in the other awards.\n\nDirectors:\n\nThere are 10 directors whose films have earned at least 225 points: Kurosawa, Spielberg, Scorsese, Bergman, Hitchcock, Lean, Kubrick, Lang, Wyler and Wilder. The first three are all tied with 425 points with different win and nomination totals (Kurosawa – 14 noms, 3 wins; Scorsese – 13 noms, 4 wins; Spielberg – 12 noms, 5 wins). Lean is also tied for the most with 5 wins. Directors with consecutive wins in the category are Murnau (28-29), Welles (41-42), Wilder (44-45), Spielberg (81-82) and Jackson (01-03).\n\nFranchises:\n\nAs is often the case, I am more inclined towards franchises than most other awards groups. The first Godfather film wins while the second is nominated. The 1989 Batman is nominated while The Dark Knight wins. The sixth Harry Potter film is nominated. The original Star Wars wins as do all three Lord of the Rings films.\n\nGenres:\n\nDrama is by far the highest, at 41.41% while no other genre is above 10% with Crime (9.18%) and War (7.76%) the only other ones above 6.5%. Every other genre is over 2% except for Kids which, with only two nominees (The Wizard of Oz, Mary Poppins) is at 0.47%. Surprisingly, every genre has won at least once. The two genres which considerably higher winning percentages are Fantasy (6 of its 10 nominees have won) and Sci-Fi (4 of 10 nominees). War is in second place (11.76%), the only genre aside from Drama that breaks 10%. Drama has almost the exact same percentage of winners as it has of nominees (42.35%).\n\nBest Picture:\n\nThe vast majority of my Picture winners at least get nominated for Cinematography (79 of 85) and well over half win both awards (59 films). Only three films have won Cinematography without a Picture nomination (Ryan’s Daughter, Barry Lyndon, E.T.) and the last two were both **** films that ranked at #7 in their respective years. A whopping 272 films are nominated in both categories, well over half of all the nominees. Only 56 of the 425 Cinematography nominees didn’t land in the Top 10 in their respective years and only 18 of them weren’t in the Top 20. Only four films earned Cinematography noms while landing outside the Top 40: Out of Africa, The Mission, Titanic and Memoirs of a Geisha, all of which, I will note, won the Oscar for Cinematography.\n\nForeign Film:\n\nNinety of my 425 nominees for Cinematography and Foreign Films. This includes 16 winners, including 4 directed by Bergman and 3 by Kurosawa. It would take until 1935 to not have a Foreign nominee and in 1929 they accounted for 4 of the 5 nominees. Foreign Films accounted for at least 3 of the nominees six of seven years from 1958 to 1964. There is at least one nominee every year from 1952 to 1970 except 1957. In 1963, Foreign Films would not only make up all five nominees but 8 of the Top 9 and 12 of the Top 20.\n\nSingle Nominations:\n\nI have little inclination to nominate a film for Cinematography and nothing else. Of the 9 films that are nominated at the Nighthawks for Cinematography with nothing else, all but one are also among the 56 films not in the Top 10 in their respective years (the one exception is The Southerner which is #6 in a very weak year for Picture). Only two Tech categories (Editing, Art Direction) have fewer films with no other nominations and Cinematography is one of only six categories (Picture, Director, Adapted Screenplay, Editing, Sound Editing) in which no winner has just the one nomination.\n\nOther Categories:\n\nIt’s not surprising (to me) that Cinematography pairs off the most with Director. In both cases, the look of the film goes together in my mind’s eye. It’s true that there’s a lot more to directing than just the Cinematography, but it shows you one of my inherent views on cinema (right or wrong). A whopping 309 films are nominated for both (almost 3/4) and 64 films win both awards. Until 2006 there isn’t a stretch of more than two consecutive years where the Cinematography winner doesn’t win Director (although there is then a four year stretch, oddly, from 2006-2009). The only Cinematography winner not to be nominated for Best Director is Ryan’s Daughter. The only Director winners not to be nominated for Cinematography are Dr. Strangelove and Hannah and her Sisters. After Director, it’s Picture that lines up the best (272 films nominated for both, 59 win both) then Editing (266 nominated for both, 48 win both). Of the Tech categories, Visual Effects has by far the least overlap, with only 70 films nominated for both (38 fewer than any other category) and only 16 films winning both (2 fewer than any other).\n\nMy Top 10\n\nSven Nykvist – 375\n\nRobert Richardson – 325\n\nRoger Deakins – 250\n\nGordon Willis – 225\n\nAsakazu Nakai – 225\n\nArthur Edeson – 200\n\nGregg Toland – 200\n\nJanus Kaminski – 200\n\nRobert Burks – 175\n\nAndrew Lesnie – 175\n\nMy Top 10 weighted\n\nSven Nykvist – 569\n\nRobert Richardson – 469\n\nGordon Willis – 444\n\nRoger Deakins – 444\n\nGregg Toland – 315\n\nMichael Ballhaus – 299\n\nJames Wong Howe – 298\n\nAsakazu Nakai – 290\n\nArthur Edeson – 274\n\nConrad L. Hall – 273\n\nnote: This based on a scale from 20-1 based on Top 20 placement at the Nighthawks. A win is worth 20 points in Makeup, a 20th place finish is worth 1 point (if the list goes a full 20).\n\nMy Top 20 Absolute Points List:\n\nRoger Deakins – 874\n\nRobert Richardson – 831\n\nSven Nykvist – 805\n\nGordon Willis – 642\n\nMichael Ballhaus – 536\n\nJanusz Kaminski – 528\n\nConrad L.

That means, for instance, that in 1993, both Janusz Kaminski (Schindler’s List) and Michael Ballhaus (The Age of Innocence) earn the maximum 57 points. This version of the list is more fair to great years.\n\nThe Top 5 Absolute Points by Decade\n\n1912-1929\n\nG.W. Bitzer – 211\n\nKarl Freund – 149\n\nHendrick Sartov – 119\n\nBen F.

The first is that none of them is what I consider a good film (*** or above). The second is that all of these have what I consider very good Cinematography (4 points or higher on my scale, or good enough to be a solid Oscar nominee). Third, in all six cases, the Cinematography is the only good part of the film in that in earned no other points from any other category. I am listing them in chronological order. It is interesting to note that three of them are notable for nude scenes (in one case a body double, in the other two cases, significant nudity) of beautiful young actresses.\n\nThe Blue Lagoon (1980, **)\n\nNever Cry Wolf (1983, **.5)\n\nParis, Texas (1984, **.5)\n\nThe Lover (1992, **)\n\nSnow Falling on Cedars (1999, **.5)\n\nThe Dreamers (2003, **.5)\n\nCinematographers Shouldn’t Direct\n\nThis is not a hard and fast rule. First of all, some directors work as their own cinematographers (Paul Thomas Anderson, Steven Soderbergh). Second, some cinematographers do a good job directing, like Sven Nykvist, whose film The Ox was Oscar nominated for Best Foreign Film and is quite good. Jack Cardiff earned an Oscar nomination for Best Director for Sons and Lovers. After multiple Oscars for Cinematography, Chris Menges made the very good A World Apart. But the maxim is that editors make better directors than cinematographers because editors see how to construct a story through film while cinematographers see things in terms of images. What’s interesting is that the most critically acclaimed director who began as a cinematographer, Nicolas Roeg, suffers sometimes from that exact problem, as his films looks beautiful but have story-telling deficiencies. Of the former cinematographers who have taken turns in the director’s chair, I have only seen two films I rate at **** (Ronald Neame’s Tunes of Glory and Roeg’s Don’t Look Now) and that’s with trying to see all great films. But it’s very easy to find terrible films directed by former cinematographers. Here’s a good list of them.\n\nThe 10 Worst Films Directed by Cinematographers Who Have Made my List (the worst being #1)\n\nTrog (dir. Freddie Francis)\n\nThe Legend of the Lone Ranger (dir.

Malkiewicz has also done a book just about film lighting while Mullen is a member of the ASC>\n\nCinematography (Mike Goodridge & Tim Grierson, 2012)\n\nA worthwhile glossy book that interviews a number of prominent cinematographers with a lot of stills from their work as well as covering several “legacies” (James Wong Howe, Raoul Coutard, Jack Cardiff, Sven Nykvist, Freddie Young). However, it has three glaring omissions and even if they didn’t want to do interviews (I don’t know if that’s the case), the book should have covered Gordon Willis, Roger Deakins and Robert Richardson (although Caleb Deschanel does acknowledge his huge debt interning under Gordon Willis).\n\nSince 2011\n\n9 Points Cinematography Jobs:\n\nGravity\n\nBirdman\n\nThe Revenant\n\nLa La Land\n\nDunkirk\n\nEmmanuel Lebezki: Chivo, as he is commonly known (and will be referred to several times below) was already well established by 2011. He had earned Oscar nominations in 1995 (A Little Princess), 1999 (Sleepy Hollow) and 2005 (The New World) and then not only earned Oscar noms but actually won the Consensus Awards in both 2006 (Children of Men) and 2011 (The Tree of Life). So, he already had 125 Oscar points (tied for 38th), 50 BAFTA points and had won the BFCA while winning the ASC twice. But then he went through the roof. In 2013, he had the second highest Consensus Score ever (behind his own Tree of Life) for Gravity, winning seven total awards, becoming the first Cinematographer to sweep the Oscar, BAFTA, ASC and BFCA. Then, in 2014, he did it again with Birdman. In 2015, he wouldn’t win any critics awards, but would for the third straight year pull off the awards sweep for The Revenant. This made him the first Cinematographer to win three Oscars in a row. It’s a three year stretch unlike almost anyone else in film history in any category.\n\nKey Films: Gravity, Birdman, The Revenant\n\nOscar Notes: The key thing is that Chivo would become the first Cinematographer to win three straight Oscars. He would also make Alejandro González Iñárritu the first director since 1945 (or first ever, depending on how you want to count it) to have back-to-back wins in the category. Spielberg has also had one more film earn a nomination, thus pushing him into a four way tie for most nominations (11) and 1st place with most points (350). Also, Roger Deakins would finally win an Oscar in 2017 and is now up to 5th place with 375 points. None of Deakins’ five nominations since 2011 have been for the Coens and three have been for Denis Villenueve, who has four nominations for his films since 2011. In 2017, Rachel Morrison would become the first female to earn an Oscar nomination for Cinematography.\n\nBAFTA Notes: Since 2011, every Oscar winner has also won the BAFTA. In 2017, Blade Runner 2049 became the first film since 2006 to win Cinematography without a Picture nomination. Not only have no more films earned just a single Cinematography nom but the only Cinematography nominee with as few as 2 total nominations is Ida (2014). The average Cinematography nominee in the last six years has 6.6 other nominations, By 2011, the only film win both Cinematography and Visual Effects was Return of the King. Since then, three films have done it (Life of Pi, Gravity, Blade Runner). Surprisingly, no film has won both Cinematography and Art Direction since 2011. You now need 150 points to make the Top 10, with Roger Deakins now tied for 1st with 325 points after his 2017 win, Emmanuel Lubezki up to 200 points after his three straight wins in 2013-2015 and Janusz Kaminski now at 150 points. The group of nominees in 2014 is the 3rd best with 5 nominees (Birdman, Grand Budapest Hotel, Ida, Interstellar, Mr Turner).\n\nASC Notes: Since 2011, while Robert Richardson has received no more nominations, Chivo won three awards (moving up to 275 points) while Roger Deakins lost against Chivo all three times and won in 2012 and 2017, so Deakins is now at 475 and way above any other director.\n\nBFCA Notes: By 2011, no cinematographer had more than 50 points. Now, Chivo has 200 points with four wins, including three straight from 2013-2015 and Roger Deakins has 150 with five nominations (three straight from 12-14) and a win in 2017. No one else has more than 75 points as of yet. Both Carol and Moonlight beat True Grit‘s mark for Highest Critical Acclaim for a BFCA Nominee but The Martian has the Lowest Critical Acclaim for a BFCA Nominee.\n\nNighthawk Notes: Scorsese’s films have earned 2 more noms but Spielberg has earned one more nom and one more win. That puts Spielberg at the top both with 6 wins and with 500 total points from his films while Scorsese has the most noms (15). González Iñárritu became the latest director with two straight wins in 14-15. In the six years since 2011, six different genres have won, including only the second win for Adventure (The Revenant) and Musical (La La Land). In those six years only one film has earned a Cinematography nom without any other noms (Prisoners) and Life of Pi (2 noms) is the only other nominee with less than 7 nominations. Roger Deakins is still in 3rd place but is now at 325 points. Janusz Kaminski is now in 4th place with 275 points. Chivo has leapt onto the list and is tied with Willis and Nakai with 225 points. On the Absolute Points list, Deakins passes Willis in 2012, Richardson in 2013 and Nykvist in 2017, taking over 1st place with 574 points. Kaminski, who was 7 points off the list in 2011, is now in 5th place with 370 points and Chivo, who was in 39th place in 2011 is now in 7th with 313. On the all-time Absolute Points list, Deakins and Richardson are still #1 and 2 but now they have 1099 and 944 points while Chivo has moved up to 6th place with 593 points and Rodrigo Prieto has gone up to 487 points and bumped Nakai from the list.\n\nTop 5 Absolute Points, 2012-2017\n\nRoger Deakins – 212\n\nEmmanuel Lubezki – 202\n\nRodrigo Prieto – 175\n\nHoyte von Hoytema – 169\n\nBradford Young – 162\n\nNighthawk Winners: 2012-2017\n\n2012: Lincoln (Janusz Kaminski) (Oscar, ASC, BAFTA, BFCA)\n\n2013: Gravity (Emmanuel Lubezki) (Oscar, ASC, BAFTA, LAFC, BSFC, CFC, BFCA)\n\n2014: Birdman (Emmanuel Lubezki) (Oscar, ASC, BAFTA, LAFC, BSFC, CFC, BFCA)\n\n2015: The Revenant (Emmanuel Lubezki) (Oscar, ASC, BAFTA, BFCA)\n\n2016: La La Land (Linus Sandgren) (Oscar, ASC, BAFTA, CFC, BFCA)\n\n2017: Dunkirk (Hoyte von Hoytema) (Oscar, ASC, BAFTA, BSFC, BFCA)\n\nChart / Consensus Notes: As you can see below, Gravity and Birdman both won 7 awards, tying for the most and they are both in 2nd place for points with 330. Since 2011, we’ve had another very close finish in 2012 and again in 2016 and in neither case did the Oscar winner win the Consensus."
