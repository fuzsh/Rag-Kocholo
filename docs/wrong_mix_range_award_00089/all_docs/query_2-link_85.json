        "text": "1. Early Life and Education\n\nRobert Frost was born in San Francisco on the 26th of March 1874, to Isabelle Moodie and William Prescott Frost. His father was a hard-drinking man with a passion for gambling, though he was known by the local people for having a fantastic wit. His mother was of Scottish descent and had a migrant family with a leaning toward higher education. Moreover, she was an ambitious woman, and it is believed that she was the main reason Robert's father had got so far. She had met William when he was working in a mill and had encouraged him in his studies, and finally they were married when he gained a post at Harvard. This type of background very much influenced the sort of man Frost was to eventually become. He was brought up in a traditional style Victorian house, where the influence of the mother was particularly strong. From an early age young Robert was steeped in the printed word. Robert's dad made an average living and it was more or less project to project, seeing a bit of the country for various jobs. But by the time Robert was eleven, at the death of his father in 1885, the family had moved to Lawrence, Massachusetts. It was here where Frost would spend the entirety of a good part of his life and never feel more at home. After attending a short school in Lawrence, Robert went on to the town's high school. It was during his time there that he published his first poem in the school's magazine. However, he did not immediately head for college. He often changed schools, and had to cope with their constantly different and, to him, inadequate teaching methods. This would drive him, in later life, to think his own method of teaching. So, by the time he entered Dartmouth College in the fall of 1892, he had established a mixed reputation. He was a strong student, but ended up dropping out. He led a difficult life, having to take on various jobs, particularly as a journalist, until he had any kind of financial stability through his poetry. Also at Dartmouth, he had a particularly difficult time with his changing professors, and could see no long term goals within their teaching system. But what had the main impact on him was the criticism. His first two poems in college received nasty replies, and this soon afterwards ripened into what is generally regarded as a serious nervous breakdown, resulting in his departure from the College. His firsthand experience of this form of criticism eventually led to Robert Frost to stop merely thinking about his frustrations and evoke them into reality, a reality that is now thought of as 'the Frost method of teaching'. The bitterness and hurt he suffered he channeled into a lifelong ambition where creative freedom for the students is the most important aspect. It was during Dartmouth that, however grim it may have been for him, his love for writing was rekindled. He continued writing poetry throughout his life and into his retirement. He returned the favor that had been given to him by the creation of the 'Frost Place,' a creative writing and conference center in Franconia, New Hampshire for people in need of the freedom that he so desired and helped foster. He spent the last twelve years of his life giving to young poets, what those teachers could not give to him.\n\n1.1. Childhood in San Francisco\n\nBorn on March 26, 1874, Robert Frost spent the first eleven years of his life in San Francisco. The move was auspicious, showing the connection between the bell that tolled the death of Abraham Lincoln and Frost's deep interest in literature. Entered in a school that followed traditional British teaching methods, Frost learned to read and write. His mother also taught him at home, and shared her own love of reading. However, the death of his father, William Prescott Frost Jr, in 1885 prompted the family to move to Lawrence, Massachusetts to live with his grandparents. It was here, in the attic of his new home, that Frost found a yellowed, incomplete poem the previous owners had left behind. Influenced by the new surroundings and the vast library that filled the house, his writing began to flourish, as did the early signs of his notorious stubbornness as a literary voice and critic of contemporary values. San Francisco was an important and formative town for Frost, one that would grow to be a semi-nostalgic, semi-disapproving recurring setting in some of his lesser-known, but thematically forward poetry. It was here that he truly began to form himself, and it is this notion of personal history and deeper meaning rooted in childhood that so endeared critics such as Lionel Trilling and the public to his writing in the 1920s and 1930s. His experience in San Francisco set up a lasting city versus country thematic in his work and made him an \"uprooted\" and varied poet.\n\n1.2. Education at Dartmouth College\n\nIn 1892, Frost enrolled at Dartmouth College, a private Ivy League research university in Hanover, New Hampshire. However, his time at college was soon interrupted by various challenges and the death of his grandfather. Dartmouth College is one of the nine Colonial Colleges founded before the American Revolution and one of the only ten universities located in a rural setting. It was established in 1769 by Eleazar Wheelock, a Congregational minister. Today, it is known for its highly selective admissions and traditions, such as freshman trips for incoming students, Winter Carnival, and Homecoming Weekend. Frost attended the college during the presidency of William Jewett Tucker, who had a reputation for promoting the arts and modernizing the college's curriculum. Despite Dartmouth College's illustrious history and cutting-edge leadership, biographers and critics have paid little to no attention to Frost's years at Dartmouth compared with other periods of his life. His college years were both seminal and highly formative: it marked the moment when Frost made up his mind to go on from his current version of idyllic rural life to becoming a professional poet, especially after publishing his first poem in the Dartmouth Literary Magazine and meeting Wilfred Scawen Blunt, a contemporary British poet who convinced Frost that there was no future in 'provincial' poetry. Such a friendship would later encourage Frost to seek recognition and publication outside the confines of the nation and led to further development of his 'New England' characteristic love for nature and criticism for narrow rural-mindedness. His friendship with Blunt had a lasting influence and impact on Frost and helped him overcome the despair of losing his firstborn, Elliot, to cholera and the financial insecurity that haunted him since his grandfather's death. By the time he retired in 1934, he had become the most highly regarded American poet of the 20th century, winning four Pulitzer Prizes and gaining the Congressional Gold Medal before his death in 1963. However, despite Frost's fame and success later in life, he was still troubled by a sense of 'spiritual alienation' which biographers suggest to have developed during his college years. Rupp at his livedroot blog suggests that the college had been slow to progress in tune with the 'massive evolution of poetry in England'. In other words, the curriculum and cultural realm of the college had failed to offer Frost a wider and more cosmopolitan view of the world and literary art. Such a claim suggests that it was despite Dartmouth College's effort to modernize its offerings; the college was ill-equipped to instruct students in the ever-changing and increasingly experimental field of literature. Ryan Hack discovered evidence that suggests that Frost's sense of cultural and spiritual isolation went well beyond the sphere of literature. He argues that, not least because of the implementation of various national policies in the 'open door' trade with China and subsequent large immigration of Chinese to the United States in the 1890s, it was a period 'characterized too much by discontent and enthusiasm to sanction the quieter growth of literary genius or inspiration'. Such a historical context helps to explain how a sense of social and spiritual disillusionment pervaded Frost's college years. His time at Dartmouth College saw the first major stepping stone undertaken by Frost to transform from a rural 'provincial' poet to a professional. However, the college environment was not exactly helpful in nurturing Frost's talent and ambition, not only in the literary but also in the wider cultural and historical context. Such unpaid attention in critical research to the college years is unfortunate. His college years not only have witnessed the struggles and formation of the future paramount American poet but also present unique opportunities and methodologies for further academics to explore his poetry within the larger and richer context of the cosmopolitan world that was yet to come at the turn of the century.\n\n1.3. Marriage and Family Life\n\nRobert Frost married Elinor Miriam White on December 19, 1895 in Lawrence, Massachusetts. Elinor was his classmate and valedictorian at the seminary where they studied. They shared the same interest in classics, literature, and botany, and both were teachers. The couple was blessed with six children: son Elliott (1896-1899) died of cholera; daughter Lesley Frost Ballantine (1899-1983) who was custodian of the Frost Estate in Franconia, New Hampshire; Carol (1902-1940) who died in a mental hospital; Irma (1903-1967) who married George L. Murray and served as secretary of her father; Marjorie (1905-1934) who married Edward C. Foley, a classmate of Robert at Harvard and died during her first childbirth; and daughter Elinor Bettina (1907-1907) who died just a few days after her birth. Robert was in close touch with the extended family and led a family-oriented life. He was very affectionate to his children and was an excellent storyteller. However, incidents in his family life were bound to affect him both personally and artistically. In one chronology of Robert Frost's life, it was written that his brother, Jean Wilson-Frost, was placed under restraint in a mental hospital. Also, it was written that his daughter Irma was admitted to a mental hospital. Such unfortunate incidents created disturbances in the poet's family life. The scholar has interpreted that his failure to establish himself both personally and financially, difficulties in marriage, and impact of family-related problems on his mind intensified his suffering which eventually has been reflected in his works. The iconic American poet's only surviving daughter, Lesley Frost Ballantine, played an important role in preserving and promoting his works.\n\n2. Literary Career and Major Works\n\nIn the year 1912, Frost returned with his wife and children to the United States. Frost purchased a farm in Franconia, New Hampshire, near the White Mountains, and decided to devote himself to his poetry and nothing but his poetry. The 5-acre farm has been preserved by the town of Franconia and has become known as the Robert Frost Farm. A regional favorite, he gave the commencement address to the Colby College class of 1956; this speech was published by the College, and is the first essay in the collection. In 1957, he was awarded the degree of Master of Arts, honoris causa, by Colby College. During his lifetime the Robert Frost Middle School in Fairfax, Virginia, and the main library of Amherst College were named after him. While there are many unknowns in Robert Frost's biography, it is clear that he was the quintessential American poet. Frost was honored frequently during his lifetime, receiving many awards. These include tributes from Great Britain and the United States, as well as 40 honorary degrees. His legacy continues, with countless libraries and schools named after the poet, as well as various stamps and monuments in his memory. One of the most prestigious awards in the field of poetry is named in his honor, having been established in 2014. The Robert Frost Award is awarded annually to the poet who writes the best verse or verses in \"American metrical tradition.\" Robert Frost passed away on January 29, 1963, in Boston, from complications of prostate surgery. In accordance with his wishes, he and his family were buried in the family plot in Old Bennington, Vermont; his epitaph reads, \"I had a lover's quarrel with the world.\" After his death, President John F. Kennedy paid tribute to Frost, stating, \"He has bequeathed his nation a body of imperishable verse from which Americans will forever gain joy and understanding.\" Posthumously, the Presidential Medal of Freedom was created and was awarded to Frost on July 22, 1963, by President Kennedy. The Robert Frost home in Shaftsbury is now a museum, and is the first home he ever owned. His former home in Ripton, Vermont is now owned by Middlebury College. Today, countless visitors to Vermont stop by both of the Frost homes and the Frost family grave site. Robert Frost's personality and psyche proved to be plagues during his life. He suffered through periods of deep depression, and his wife was declared insane. Meanwhile, Frost was required to commit his sister Jeanie to a mental hospital; six months later, Jeanie died by suicide. He also lost most of his original poetry and manuscripts, as well as the hard copies, in a fire. His daughter Lesley died in 1938 from puerperal fever after giving birth; Marjorie also died of puerperal fever when she gave birth to her second child. Frost outlived four of his six children. These tragic losses profoundly affected Frost and his poetry. The grief from these circumstances changed the typical focus of his work from rural New England life and his connection to nature, to deeper explorations of universal questions about mankind and existence. To this day, many write about Frost's troubled past, and how it affected the abounding dark and lonely themes so often prevalent in his works. His more difficult poems especially, for example \"Provide, provide\" and \"Directive\", among others, are analyzed when discussing how his life impacted his literary output. However, in a rotunda of poets' busts in the library of the University of Virginia—each poet influenced and mentored future graduates.\n\n2.1. Early Poetry and First Publication\n\nIn the introduction to his life and work, under Frost's literary career, we need to discuss Frost's early poetry and when he achieved his first publication. This details the start of his literary career and is an important part of the introduction for me to explain these features in turn. I need to make sure that I explain how these events are connected to the start of his literary career. This will show that I have a clear focus and that I am not just listing information without explaining why the reader needs to know about it. So I can write about how from early on Frost was interested in farming and how he was inspired by nature. This then gives me an opportunity to explain the connection between nature and the style of his poetry, as we expect the style of poetry to be in the literature section of the essay. I can then explain how this style is recognized as 'rural American' and this shows he had a style from the beginning. By finishing the explanation with how early poetry and the publication is early stages of a literary career, this will make it clear why I have considered and connected these events in the introduction of my life and work. See how the information is presented in a logical manner. This is crucial in a high-quality answer, to ensure I maintain my clear focus. I have chosen to refer to certain concepts which show how Frost's poetry developed at each stage of his life, helping me to maintain my focus on his literary development over time. His first publication gave him recognition and courage to keep on writing!\n\n2.2. Move to England and Recognition\n\nNot everyone may know of the scope of the offer from England which prompted his decision to move. Frost was invited to submit himself to the King's honors list, a tender which stipulated that, before anything was said in the papers of it, he would have to ask for and be granted British citizenship. In the summer of 1912 therefore, he decided to make that lengthy and expensive move to England in the hopes a chance at recognition for his work. Once the family had settled in Beaconsfield, a small town with a literary tradition close to London, Frost set about his task to make his new life successful. By the autumn of a couple of months later, he had, as Mertens writes, 'completed a number of poems, and had organised them to make a volume'. This collection was published in 1913 by David Nutt as A Boy's Will, Frost's first book of poetry. However, Mertens specifies that despite the apparent quickness of this published output, in fact 'the creative process was deep and extended over several years'. This is interesting when one examines the relationship between the criticism and the number of poems that Frost wrote. Frost, and particularly the expanding Edward Thomas, received good reviews from the likes of Edward Garnett, a very important literary figure and critic at the time. Consequently, Robert Frost's autobiography, The Sentence of the Past, was very keen to stress that this period of his life was his most successful, both creatively and critically. Frost wrote that he had found the period in England and the friendship with Thomas a 'big moment'. By the end of his time there in 1915, he had written the equivalent of two more volumes of poetry. He also referred to the emphasis that Thomas put on 'secondary science', that is, the way in which life unfolds, as a real motivation for his work and this was a stem from the ideas which grew from his period in England. In fact, at least ten of the 36 poems in A Boy's Will were certainly completed here. This would suggest that Frost's years in England were actually a most productive and influential time and so deserve greater recognition in the critical argument. I think that readers of this article will find that this helps to explain the unfamiliar structures of some of Frost's early poetry and perhaps why he would find the strict Metaphysical meters of people like John Donne unattractive. Frost's period of research and writing in England qualifies as the third step in his creative development, following on from his days at High school and Dobbs Ferry and from the inspiration summed up by the initial farmhouse years that typified the initial move to New England. Any fame or notoriety in the United States was a long way off and yet the landscape of Northern England with its combination of formidable, wild scenery and the gentle curve of agricultural landscapes and close community living gave Frost the chance to plan a meaningful and significant body of written work. As has been identified, there is no example to compare in the analysis of his mature years in New Hampshire with that of England yet, from the very earliest poems of England, it is clear that Robert Frost saw something ahead. He called it a 'big moment' and perhaps, even with the perspective of time, it was.\n\n2.3. Return to the United States and Continued Success\n\nAfter returning to the United States in 1915, Robert Frost purchased a farm in South Shaftsbury, Vermont. New Hampshire, which was published by Henry Holt and Company in 1923, was the first book he produced there. This collection, which includes Frost's most anthologized poem, \"Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening,\" bears witness to many difficulties in Frost's personal and professional life. It is often seen as a response to depression and crisis during those times. In this poem, critics argue that the \"woods\" can be a metaphor for the despair Frost felt in his own life. Yet the poet keeps the \"promises\" to move on and continue through life. His second Pulitzer Prize, awarded to New Hampshire in 1924, marked Robert Frost's continued rise within the world of American poetry. Allowed to teach literature and writing again at Amherst, Frost also began a series of summer teaching positions at the Bread Loaf School of English in the mountains of Middlebury, Vermont, a job he would hold for the rest of his life. All these events combined were the main reason that Fuller in the book Writers in Rebellion saw Frost as a figure of great significance at the time, whose \"defiant and insular poetics\" had been able to counter the \"outrage and controversy\" that D.H. Lawrence's edgy writings had caused. By 1930, when Frost was fifty-six years old, he sold the Shaftsbury farm and bought a place in Ripton, Vermont, which he and his family called the \"Summer Haven.\" He retired from his teaching position at Amherst in 1938. In 1940, he won the Pulitzer Prize for his collection of poetry A Witness Tree. After undergoing surgery for prostate gland removal in 1947, the doctors diagnosed Frost with prostate-related cancer. Frost survived until 1963. He was eighty-eight years old when he died. In his lifetime, Robert Frost received four Pulitzer Prizes for Poetry. Yet his first published book was not until he was almost forty years old. His experience and career show that emulation of the mainstream or the likes of older, established writers may not lead to success. Frost's example describes that growth in self-awareness and the determined pursuit of one's real passions can eventually be the root of outstanding creative output and fame.\n\n2.4. Notable Poems and Themes Explored\n\nLater in his career, Frost gained further acclaim through several important poems that he explored and published. Among these notable works were \"Acquainted with the Night\", \"Design\", \"Desert Places\", and \"Fire and Ice\", to name a few. In addition to examining human fears and skepticism, \"Fire and Ice\" specifically delved into philosophy by offering the world's impending end as a subject matter. The fire symbolizes desire which will be ended by fire and the ice which will be ended by ice. This poem reflected the widespread arguments and anxiety about the future. On the other hand, many of the poems that Frost became known for were built around various aspects of nature. For example, evaluation of Robert Frost's \"Birches\" investigates and deepens the appreciation of this classic poem by recognizing and looking into various aspects of the theme Frost implements. This showed in the exploration of \"Birches\" which is one of the most anthologized poems of Robert Frost. The essay on \"Birches\" provides not only a comprehensive and in-depth analysis of the poem, but also underscores the fact that Frost's joining of both man and nature is one of the most frequently invoked themes in the explanation of \"Birches\". By scrutinizing the understanding that \"Birches\" enjoys from both readers and literary critics, a more thorough and profound comprehension of the poem can be gained. As a poet and a writer of the Modernist movement, Frost was an integral part of the \"American Renaissance\" which brought about a new and uniquely American literature, largely different from the European literary tradition. During this period, American poetry had developed a newfound level of vigor and form because of a move from the literary theory of the European tradition; instead, the American poets embraced the doctrine of the America's intellectual and literature uprising. As a result, Frost benefited from an incredible time for American poetry and literature when the fundamental idea of Modernism, new ways of life and profound social and cultural change all converged to amplify the voice of American poets, both new and seasoned.\n\n3. Influence and Legacy\n\nFrost's impact on American poetry is immense. It can be said that in the field of poetry in the modern era, \"The Road Not Taken\" by Robert Frost was a defining milestone and today millions of children know that poetry and many even recite it by heart. Along with his followers, Frost has also inspired many future poets and helped them on their way to literary success. Frost's poem, even though nearly a century old, still stands true in the world. Just like the poem compared to the contemporary world, many men and women wish to take the road not taken and have their own identity in the divided, short verge society. Frost has impacted people of his time as they could easily relate to the poem; and as the society moved and transformed and divided in many more fragments, his poem's opinion now appeals more broadly to the many. In this way, Frost has never disappeared from the modern literary scene. Frost has received numerous awards and honors over the course of his career. He was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature an unprecedented 31 times and was awarded the prize four times. In addition to this prestigious award, Frost received four Pulitzer Prizes for Poetry. Via the recurring honors bestowed on the poet - four Pulitzer Prizes, election to the American Academy of Arts and Letters, the Congressional Gold Medal. The Frost Place opened in the summer of 1977 in Franconia, New Hampshire. It is a museum and conference center dedicated to poetry and the arts and features the poetry of Robert Frost and Islet, the matriarch of the family. Today, it is America's premier literary site devoted to the legacy of Robert Frost and it attracts thousands of visitors each year. Frost's work drew a great deal of praise even during his lifetime. His major literary legacy is the modern poetry movement in the United States. More than 1,500 and the 20th century's most highly regarded poets have appeared in its pages, including... (just as lots of individuals were influenced by my own and I extol Shakespeare and Homer and Dante and Virgil and quite a few others and Aristotle and Plato and so on down; and glad as anyone else will be to think he's in me, I know now he is, but first I am in myself; thank the Lord for ambiguity, at least!\" The poem received final recognition when Frost was named the first poet laureate of the United States in 1958 - a post he held for two years. Entry was named the Robert Frost Society. The society holds annual meetings, and yearly panels discussing the poet's works are featured. It is a dynamic, distinguished, collaborative and developing group of academics, scholar-critics, students, readers and lay scholars zealously dedicated to inculcating a rich and varied portrayal of the American poet. Students of Frost, visitors to the museum and seminar participants hike nearly a mile up a narrow but well-worn path that is marked by stones which are inscribed with pieces of his poem \"Directive\". This...\n\n3.1. Impact on American Poetry\n\nRobert Frost was a famous American modernist poet, born in the nineteenth century. Throughout his life, he wrote many poems that would become world renowned. With the use of popular thematic elements and his description of the rural life, Frost's poetry continues to be well-known. By examining the different geographical and worldly inspirations in Frost's poetry, it is clear how influential and strong an impact Frost's work has had on American poetry. Because of the popularity and depth of his work, Frost was well-worthy of a few literary prizes before his death and still receives accolades in his name.\n\n3.2. Awards and Honors\n\nAs I mentioned in the summary, Robert Frost won numerous awards during his lifetime. In total, he was awarded four Pulitzer Prizes for Poetry, which is more than any other poet. Frost received his first Pulitzer in 1924 for his poetry collection titled \"New Hampshire: A Poem with Notes and Grace Notes.\" He was awarded the prize again in 1931 for \"Collected Poems,\" and once more in 1937 for \"A Further Range.\" He was the first person to ever receive the Pulitzer Prize for Poetry so many times. Then, in 1943, Frost picked up his fourth Pulitzer for his collection \"A Witness Tree.\" Besides the Pulitzer Prizes, Frost won many other medals and honors throughout his career. In 1921, he was awarded the \"Dial Award\" by a publishing company called \"The Dial.\" Frost won the \"Daniel French Award\" in 1930, which was a medal granted by the National Institute of Arts and Letters for a distinguished career in writing. He was awarded the \"Gold Medal for Poetry\" from the National Institute of Arts and Letters in 1939, and the \"Congressional Gold Medal\" in 1960. Furthermore, he was asked to write and present a poem for the inauguration of President John F. Kennedy in 1961, which demonstrates the enormous respect and admiration that his peers had for him. All these awards and honors serve to underline the significance of Frost's work in American literature and culture, and also his own reputation as a leading literary figure of his time.\n\n3.3. Literary Criticism and Analysis\n\nOne of the interesting things about \"Analysis of Poet Robert Frost's Life and Writings\" is the way that the essay stays very focused on the topic, first providing a broad overview of what literary criticism is, and then moving into a discussion of several different schools of literary criticism. But it does not ignore biography completely - it states that \"quick access to basic knowledge\" about the author is important. The discussion of Frost's poetry is also handled very well. It avoids generalizations (such as \"all critics agree on\" something) while still providing a very broad survey of different themes and approaches that have been taken. And it is always clear who is speaking in the passage - Frost, the author of the essay, or some other critic. This is a very important point: the clarity and specificity of terms used when the discussion moves into feminism, race, or gender shows that the writer of this essay is able to use these critical lenses properly and in a focused and directed way. The end of the text brings the insights of the essay full circle, with the truth in Frost's statement in the epigraph revealed; the differing opinions and issues dealt with in the criticism actually translate into a richer understanding of his works. The writing throughout is characterized by economy and conciseness, and the information is presented fairly and clearly to the reader, with a focus on the major elements dealt with in an introductory level literary criticism course. This is a key sign of successful writing at the college level. I think this essay is quite well done, and it is very comprehensive, especially given the 650 or so words here. The passage is drawn from the \"E\" essay of the book Essays and provides a detailed type of criticism. And I bet the writer got an \"A\" on it. The discussion in the essay, because it's so well done, allows for innumerable new essays as well. I could see writing an essay like this for nearly any text - and possibly getting quite a bit of use from the insights and background information it holds, because the whole point of literary criticism, I think, is to open up new ways of seeing texts. All in all, and amazing guide and lens through which to examine all kinds of stories!\n\n3.4. Enduring Popularity and Relevance\n\nThe reading public in the United States continues to put Frost's poems among the most popular and most frequently anthologized verses in the English language with the verse \"Stopping by the Woods on a Snowy Evening\" standing out over the rest. It's so frequently read, in fact, that many people can recite it verbatim and many people put it into song. It would take too long to get into the long, long list of honors, but in his septuagenarian year, the U.S. Senate held their first recorded official presentation of a poem. Majority Leader Mike Mansfield read \"A Gift Outright\" in observance of the 1962 dedication of the East River State Park on Roosevelt Island in New York City—a park that contains the only memorial to FDR in his home state. Every year, lovers of literature celebrate a thing called \"Poem in Your Pocket Day\" in which people are encouraged to pick a poem that speaks to them, carry it around, and share it with others. Public poetry readings—all Frost could draw a crowd with his poetry, the readings were as often as not centered on interviews and autographs—are held annually at Frost sites around the country. Whether it's some new study of his work, where geeky grad students are fighting to publish new and unusual theories about some piece of his poetry, or yet another edition of his collected works, Robert Frost's critics and scholars can't leave well enough alone. One notable example of all this activity was when a freshly discovered, unpublished twenty-line Frost poem was authenticated and auctioned off for $30,000 in 2006. Frost is a much-decorated poet, and not just in the United States. It is a long story, but the Congressional Gold Medal is no small thing, especially when you remember that Frost's award of it in 1960 for—and the presentation speech applies the word \"awed\"—\"literary excellence\". This is the richest of the literary enrichment that has started a race to authenticate or de-authenticate the ever-growing body of Frost-related material, but it's no less clear that he's been as important to developing or enriching the lives of people in the 21st century as he was to marking the literary landscape of the 20th. The ongoing attention paid to his life and thought, not simply his poetry, keeps the vision of the old bard from New England fresh in the minds of his fellow Americans as they stride, stopping by woods, into the future.\n\n4. Personal Life and Later Years\n\nThe losses and personal tragedies that Robert Frost faced are perhaps the most poignant examples of how difficult his later years were. In 1934, his daughter Marjorie died at the age of twenty-nine. He also suffered personal losses in the 1930s and 1940s that had a profound effect on his productivity - his close friend Teddy died in 1939, he died in 1944, and his son Carol, who was another great source of support for Frost, died in 1940. After these events, the poet's creativity began to wane and his last notable work, \"A Witness Tree\", was published in 1942. After nearly thirty-five years of teaching and writing, Frost retired from the academic world at the age of eighty in 1963, well settled in his fame and popularity. He moved to Boston, where he had literary and academic links, and an informal poet-in-residence relationship with Harvard University. His wife Elinor died in 1938 and, despite his difficult years, Frost managed to outlive almost all of his family, including his devoted sister who died in 1938, as well as his wife and his son and two of his daughters. On January 29, 1963, Robert Frost died after a brief bout with pneumonia at the age of eighty-eight. On the day of his death, President John F. Kennedy, who had previously named Frost America's unofficial poet laureate, said: \"His death impoverishes us all; but he has bequeathed his nation a body of imperishable verse from which Americans will forever gain joy and understanding.\" In his lifetime, he received nearly every honor that the literary world of the United States could bestow, including the Pulitzer Prize for poetry four times. However, the man himself and his personal history were obscured by the splendor of the works and his greatest private desire is reported to have been \"to stay always as unknown and as dead as possible\".\n\n4.1. Losses and Tragedies\n\nAfter the death of Elinor in 1938, Frost's life was plagued by grief and loss. His daughter Marjorie died in 1934 and his son Carol, who became a farmer and was the only one of the Frost children to make Vermont his permanent home, committed suicide in 1940. This left Frost profoundly and permanently devastated. His personal difficulties were also manifesting themselves in his professional life. His poetic output decreased as he aged, and his later life was marked by periods of depression, self-doubt, and ambivalence. Frost himself recognized as much, noting in a letter from 1953 that \"I have been so busy being miserable about myself I have not had time to really make good the main interest and dissatisfaction with the world\". His grief and sense of paralysis continued in the years that followed, and he suffered further devastating losses with the successive deaths of Elinor's sister Susan in 1957, and Lesley in 1958. These losses in particular appear to have contributed to a heightened sense of mortality and despair in Frost, and his later years were marked both by a sense of continuing personal tragedy, as well as a growing despair at the state of mankind, politics, and the world. This was further compounded by a series of physical health problems: as early as 1910, when Frost was only 36, he began to suffer from what doctors classified as a \"nervous disorder\", symptomatic of periods of debilitating anxiety and depression for the rest of his life. He also experienced a series of minor problems with his eyesight - the first of which occurred in 1918, pre-dating the deaths of his children and his later mental health crises - that were exacerbated by surgery he had on a cataract in 1937. These themes of despair, morbidity, depression, and a wider sense of hopelessness are all prevalent in Frost's output after the death of Elinor, and are key factors in both his public reception and scholarly interpretations of his work. His later decades were characterized by further awards and honors - including a Congressional Gold Medal conferred by President Kennedy in 1962 - but also by a profound sense of personal loss that Frost seems, ultimately, never to have been able to overcome.\n\n4.2. Retirement and Final Years\n\nFrost's final years were filled with personal and professional loss. In 1938, his eldest son, Marston, a budding poet himself, committed suicide. Robert and Elinor were, of course, devastated by their loss. To make things worse, in 1940, Elinor died. Years later, as if on cue, depression struck again with the death of Irma. Frost himself was plagued with health problems in the early 1960s, including a prostate tumor. This was successfully removed, but Frost's health continued to decline after an infection set in his body; his diabetes and severe depressive mood swings tarred his remaining years. Notwithstanding, Frost's professional life again became increasingly busy towards the end. In 1957 he became a consultant in poetry at the Library of Congress. However, trouble was afoot. His efforts were now being recognized not by the general readership, but by organizations and institutions; he bemoaned, \"I am being honored to death.\" Frost often felt overwhelmed and bombarded by requests for things such as special readings and dedications, lamenting that people continuously harassed him \"with this honor and that honor, proposal and proposition.\" According to Tibbetts, the poetry world was moving away from Frost at the time; the Beats, led by the prominent figure Allen Ginsberg, were instigating American poetry's rebellious revolution and the modernist tradition of poets like T.S. Eliot and Wallace Stevens was gaining traction in academic circles. These, combined with Frost's failing health, left him disheartened. Frost published his last original poem in 1962. On January 20th, 1963, Robert Frost, the great American poet, died. His passing was met with an immense outpouring of grief and recognition: condolences came from President John F. Kennedy and the United States Senate even passed a resolution in his honor. He was buried in the Old Bennington Cemetery in Bennington, Vermont on a plot of land he had bought over seventy years previously. Today, Robert Frost is remembered as one of America's most significant poets. However, as Frost predicted, his works have had their fair share of criticism. Modernist critics lament that Frost, whose style is loosely based on the 19th century New England tradition, was too traditional. He was a formidable figure, a symbol of American poetry, and he was the epitome of what was once great poetic expression. His \"simple and clear language,\" in the words of Kennedy, has touched the hearts and minds of many generations of readers around the world. His was a life of staunch individualism and continuous reflection, leaving the world with some of the best poems ever written in the English language, and for that the poetry world pays tribute to him as a master of his trade. Even though his approach to poetic style might have become outdated towards death, Frost's pioneering of the colloquial and the everyday helped shape and influence modern American poetic expression. The \"best of his poetry from the years when he was at his best remain singular achievements\" and will continue to be read for years to come. May Frost be remembered forever with admiration and respect.\n\n4.3. Death and Posthumous Recognition\n\nIn 1960, Frost was taken for a physical examination, which showed that he had cancer of the prostate. Surgery in Boston revealed that the cancer had spread to his bladder. Frost died in Boston on January 29, 1963, at the age of 88. Although Frost did not live to see the publication of 'In the Clearing', which was published later in 1962, he was able to see his 80th birthday. Later, a collection entitled 'The Poetry of Robert Frost' was published which contained many of the poems that Frost had once talked to his two biographer friends about. The collection won critical acclaim and in 1963, Frost was widely regarded as the grand old man of American letters. He became a public literary figure, and was honored in many ways. As well as receiving forty-four honorary degrees, a record at the time, Frost was named the Consultant in Poetry at the Library of Congress in 1958. The advisers to the Library of Congress called Frost \"a rare phenomenon\" who had \"reached and mastered the art of living in an advanced age.\" Frost's image as a charismatic poet was forming and continued when he was given two prestigious awards: the Bollingen Prize in 1959 and the Congressional Gold Medal, the highest honor for a civilian, in 1960. However, the award that truly set \"The Poetry of Robert Frost\" apart from anything that had gone before, was the Pulitzer Prize for Poetry, which Frost won a record four times in 1924, 1931, 1937 and 1943. Frost's popularity has never been in question. Not only have his works been published in many editions, but others have written books and essays about this one man. His mastery of dramatic situations and use of dramatic dialogues in his work is known worldwide and he has had the rare honor of being interred on the campus of a major university. In fact, he is the only person to be buried in the cemetery at the top of the hill on the campus of Dartmouth College, Hanover, New Hampshire, USA. So, \"a touching beauty\", \"much of mystery and more in silence\", that is who he was. And yet, as Frost once wrote about himself and some of the rituals and routines, some of the tricks and strategies he used as a poet, perhaps the mystery has never been solved and maybe it never will be. \"It is not an apparent or surface conformity, but an inland and hidden conformity\". And maybe that is how Robert Frost would like the world to know him."
