        "text": "In the aftermath of the Great War, Ivo Andrić published a number of poems, essays and short stories describing the hard won victorious outcome as transient to the dire reality of the inordinate loss of human lives and suffering. Yet , personal experiences although perceived as ephemeral, helped to define the historical discourse capturing man’s resolve to persist in his chosen mission. Over time, Serbian literature and fine arts sustained an unfinished dialogue of the past and the present, merging the individual voices with the collective voices to construct the national narrative. The young writer Miloš Crnjanski observed the sights of destruction and despair that seemed to pale in new literary works pertaining to the war. His novel, A Diary about Čarnojević, was closely related to his own perilous wartime journey as a conscript in Austrian army. The vastness of Pannonian plains and Galician woods must have invoked a comparison of sorts with another historic chapter in the collective consciousness of his nation: the Great Serbian Migration under Patriarch Arsenije III Čarnojević . The title of the novel alone, contained a powerful reference to the migration, and its illustrious historic leader which has not been discussed or explored before.\n\nDownload\n\nPrimerjalna književnost\n\nThis article is dealing with the topic of two past twentieth-century epochs in a few representative Serbian novels at the turn from the twentieth to the twenty-first century. These are the 1980s and the New Wave era in Yugoslavia, an epoch close to the past that can still be written about from the perspective of an immediate witness, and the avant-garde era, that is, the period between the two world wars marked in art by different movements of the historical avant-garde. The novels Milenijum u Beogradu (Millennium in Belgrade, 2000) by Vladimir Pištalo, Vrt u Veneciji (The Garden in Venice, 2002) by Mileta Prodanović, and Kiša i hartija (Rain and Paper, 2004) by Vladimir Tasić are being interpreted. In these novels, it is particularly noteworthy that the two aforementioned epochs are most commonly linked as part of the same creative and intellectual currents in the twentieth century.\n\nDownload"
