        "text": "LLCE, 2020\n\nBy Marijana Bošnjak\n\nMagic realism is more a stylistic formation than a particular genre with a tendency to understand the paradox of connecting the opposites. In other words, the concept of magic realism represents the intertwining of what is real and unreal, what is true and imaginary, and what is historical and mythical in the accelerated rhythm of narration. Consequently, the notion of magic realism is suitable for denoting the reality that arises from mythical foundations and in which nobody is surprised by the constant presence of the supernatural. Toward the end of the 1920s and 1930s, Croatian literature featured a renewal of the realistic novel with a distinct social function. Nevertheless, in relation to the tradition, this paper presents the deviations of the realistic novel such as Ivo Andrić’s The Bridge on the Drina (1945) and the tendency of aestheticizing narration and stylistic diversity that contribute to the complexity of the structure. Therefore, the opposition implied by magic realism manifests itself, on the one hand, in the construction of Andrić’s novel as the discovery of the collective consciousness and destiny of the aesthetic being of a nation on the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina during the tragic historical circumstances that took place with the arrival of the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy and the departure of the Ottoman Empire (between East and West), as well as in the revelation of the myth’s significance and demythologizing the past. On the other hand, it manifests itself in the construction of a critical work that, with the lucid consciousness of a European intellectual, perceives the entire development of the national being. In doing so, Andrić’s novel justifies the vision of magic realism set by Latin American writers whose magic was not the product of a random or spontaneous, but a culturally determined choice....Read more\n\nRelated Papers\n\nMAGIC REALISM IN WORLD LITERATURE MAGIC REALISM IN WORLD LITERATURE, 2021\n\nThis article examines the question of the origins of magical realism. It is reported that works of magical realism have spread in the twentieth century in the literature of different countries and have taken a strong position in world literature in recent decades. And also, that the magical realism that emerged in the 1920s is a syncretic genre, not only because it, by definition, implies a fusion of the real and the illusory, but also its representatives managed to find an extremely successful and unusual way to tell about everyday life in a new way, social, moral problems that have already bored humanity. Attention is paid to iconic works in modern Latin American literature, written in the mainstream of magical realism.\n\nDownload\n\nThis research paper is concerned with an examination of Latin American Literature in relation to the popular culture of the region. In this case, the research will focus on literature within the genre called Magical Realism. The scope of this investigation is based on case studies of Gabriel Garcia Marquez in Colombia, Mario Vargas Llosa in Peru, Jorge Luis Borges in Argentina and Carlos Fuentes in Mexico. The time frame under consideration in this research will be the 1920, the beginning of the genre, present times; with specific attention to the historical time periods surrounding the authors and their respective works. The purpose of this research is to examine Latin American History in the context of Magical Realism, the ways in which the movement portrays historical events as well as the reaction of contemporary and modern day people to the products of the literary movement. In order to explore the role of Magical Realism in literature and history, this paper will analyze the following: Of Love and Other Demons by Garcia Marquez, The Green House by Vargas Llosa, The Garden of Forking Paths by Borges and The Good Conscience by Fuentes. In addition, this paper will pay particular attention to the work of Garcia Marquez as well as his biography. In this context, the primary sources under consideration include: the painting titled “Cuadro de Castas,” the Nobel Prize acceptance speeches of Garcia Marquez and Vargas Llosa, The New York Times literary releases for all the works. The secondary sources are JSTOR articles : “Decadence and Modernity in the Unfinished Society: The Latin American Novel” by Larry S. Caney and “Symbolism and the Clash of Cultural Traditions in Colonial Spanish America in Garcia Marquez’s Del Amor y Otros Demonios” by Arnold M. Penuel. In relation to the sources that are to be used, the historical components of the analysis will consider the social and political environment that led to the development of the movement of Magical Realism. Likewise alongside this consideration, the impact of these literary works on the public will be taken into account. To this effect, the questions that are to be examined include: What are the origins of Magical Realism? What are the stylistic characteristics that define the movement? How does each author implement these stylistic elements in the selected works? What are the social and political references found in the works? What are the social and political messages and themes explored by the author individually and collectively? These substantial questions will be the bulk of the paper and in this way they aim to make the reader aware of the historical context from which these literary works and their authors came. Overall, the scope and methodology to be used in this paper aims to provide an examination of the historical relevance that can be found in the selected works. Furthermore, the purpose is to demonstrate what makes these pieces of literature part of the movement of Magical Realism. In this way, as a form of popular culture, literature is one of component that leads to a rounded understanding of the historical events that shaped the Latin American countries under consideration.\n\nDownload\n\nThe Routledge Handbook to the Culture and Media of the Americas, 2020\n\nMagical realism has offered the world a literary model of resistance, being rebellious, anti-establishment, non-European, and anti-colonialist in its origins. It has firmly established itself as another postcolonial form of writing back against the dominant realist mode of Western beliefs. In Latin America, though, the genre in its original calling and form has already perished.

Thus with particular reference to The Famished Road and Songs of Enchantment, this paper proposes to locate how Ben Okri's use of magical realism, while shifting the paradigms of Carpentier's \"lo real maravilloso,\" aims to extend our sense of the real world itself to include myths, dreamscapes, magical events and the cultural modalities of the ex-centric (African) within it, and thereby arrive at a conclusion that in Okri's novels, it is the \"magical\" which qualifies the \"real\".\n\nDownload\n\nhttp://www.ijelr.in, 2015\n\nMagic realism acts as resistance against Western hegemony1. In One Hundred years of Solitude Gabriel Garcia Marquez rediscovers the history of Latin America in an allegorical way. Magic realism is a narrative technique which acts as an identity of Latin America and on the other hand its hybrid characteristic is a protest against the conventional Western norm. Magical realism, unlike the fantastic or the surreal, presumes that the individual requires a bond with the traditions and the faith of the community, that s/he is historically constructed and connected. Like many Latin American writers, Gabriel Garcia Marquez has been inextricably linked to this style of literature,\" magical realism.\" Literature of this type is usually characterized by elements of the fantastic woven into the story with a deadpan sense of presentation. Gabriel Garcia Marquez uses the technique of magical realism in his novels as well as his short stories. Marquez uses magical realism to blend reality and fantasy so that the distinction between the two erases. Magical realism is often considered a subcategory of postcolonial fiction due to its challenge to hegemony and its use of techniques similar to those of other postcolonial texts, such as the distortion of time. Magical realists incorporate some other techniques that have been linked to post-colonialism, with hybridity being a primary feature. Magic realism itself is hybrid. Specifically, magical realism is illustrated in the inharmonious arenas of such opposites as urban and rural, and Western and indigenous. The plots of magical realist works involve issues of borders, mixing, and change. Authors establish these plots to reveal a crucial purpose of magical realism: a more deep and true reality than conventional realist techniques would illustrate. Latin America once had a thriving population of native Aztecs and Incas, but, slowly, as European explorers arrived, the native population had to adjust to the technology and capitalism that the 1 Hegemony) is a concept that has been used to describe the existence of dominance of one social group over another, such that the ruling group-referred to as a hegemon-acquires some degree of consent from the subordinate, as opposed to dominance purely by force.\n\nDownload\n\nPhilological Studies, 2011\n\nSummary: This paper considers to what extent contemporary discourses about magical realism might contribute to a comparative understanding of the works of Milorad Pavić, especially his novel Dictionary of the Khazars. Comparative analysis of elements of magical realism in Pavić's exemplary novel reveals characteristics of both European and Latin American forms of magical realism. Therefore, the paper places Pavić's novel into the context of magical realism.
