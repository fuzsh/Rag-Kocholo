The Carillon Historical Park in Dayton, Ohio is a 65-acre complex filled with dozens of museum buildings which showcase the region’s industrial innovations, transportation achievements, and contributions to world progress.

The Carillon Historical Park came into existence through the philanthropy of Colonel Edward A. Deeds (1874-1960) and his wife, Edith Walton Deeds (1869-1949). According to one sign:

“Colonel Deeds, inventor, industrialist, and Board Chairman of the National Cash Register Company, envisioned a museum complex filled with educational exhibits about the history of transportation and Dayton’s contributions to world progress.”

The Carillon Historical Park opened to the general public in 1950.
