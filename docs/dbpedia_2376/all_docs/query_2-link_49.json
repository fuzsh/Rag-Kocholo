        "text": "DAYTON, Ohio (WKEF) -- For 20 years, Carillon Historical Park has hosted Heritage Day with the Dayton Philharmonic Orchestra. It's an all-day event, where the park honors Dayton's rich history through live interpretations, allowing people to explore all museum exhibits, and live performances.\n\n\"Hope to welcome hundreds if not thousands of people here today,\" said Brady Kress, President and CEO of Carillon Historical Park.\n\nKress said each year, he gets more and more excited to host Heritage Day.\n\n\"I actually moved to Dayton probably about 10 years ago from North Dakota so it's my first time at Carillon Park and I'm enjoying every minute of it,\" said Bonnie King, an event attendee.\n\nThe endless number of activities were unique and appropriate for all ages.\n\n\"Dayton Philharmonic Orchestra will be playing today at 7 p.m. and leading into that is our Carillon Park concert band,\" said Kress.\n\nKing, who attended Heritage Day for the first time, said she was most excited to see the exhibits and hear the Dayton Philharmonic.\n\n\"I have taken some pictures of the houses and walked through a few buildings that I've been interested in seeing. I like listening to all kinds of music, so anytime I can listen to something outside I'm for it,\" said King.\n\nKress said he's excited that the park can bring enjoyable events like this to the community.\n\n\"It is fun and it's a different experience if you love classic music and of course with it being Memorial Day, this is a patriotic concert, so to hear that kind of music in an environment like Carillon Park is really special for people,\" said Kress.\n\nKing said she'll definitely be back for Heritage Day next year.\n\n\"I'm just on going around Ohio and enjoying every minute I can,\" said King."
