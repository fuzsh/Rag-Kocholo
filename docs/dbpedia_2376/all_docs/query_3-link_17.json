        "text": "Group of Students Watching the Water-powered Gristmill at Carillon Historical Park, ca. 1950s\n\nAs one of the original buildings here at Carillon Park, the Gristmill has provided entertainment for a lot of visitors over the years. The Gristmill has served a duel function over the years: providing both educational insight of a historical process and a place in which the Park’s caretaker could live on-site. Outfitted with an original millstone, the mill is operated by water power provided by the sizable wooden water wheel located on the left side of the structure. A large picture window installed in the lower level of the building allows visitors the opportunity to see how a similar mill would have operated. Seen here are a group of young school children during a tour of the park in the early 1950s, shortly after the park opened. Recently, a group of trained and dedicated volunteers at Carillon Historical Park, constructed and installed a new wooden water wheel for use at the Gristmill. This photo is from the NCR Archive at Dayton History."
