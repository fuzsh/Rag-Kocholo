        "text": "The Dayton Art Institute (DAI) is a world-class art and educational institution located in Oakwood, Ohio. The museum claims to be home to \"one of the finest art collections in America,\" which includes everything from ancient Greco-Roman sculpture and French impressionist paintings to works by modern American artists like Andy Warhol.\n\nDAI was founded in the late 1800s by John Herron, who began collecting art pieces after securing a $50,000 grant. The museum is split into 4 different areas: European Art, Decorative Arts & Design, American Art, and special exhibitions. Everything inside is free for visitors to see (but there may be an admission fee for special exhibitions).\n\nFor those interested in historic artifacts, The Dayton Art Institute features over 120,000 objects in their Decorative Arts & Design collection. While they do not have drones to take pictures of the whole collection at once, there are some great examples of American Art that they offer on their website.\n\nThe Dayton Art Institute houses some truly interesting art ranging from the 19th century to the modern. The building itself, designed by Hawgood and Herling, was built in the Georgian style with Roman Baroque elements. My favorite part of the building had to be the ceiling, which is decorated like a Greek temple. I couldn't get enough of the paintings on the walls and be impressed with how many there were. There are also two floors of exhibition space to explore.\n\nAll in all, it's definitely worth a trip if you're looking for something interesting to do around Dayton!\n\nBaker Heating & Cooling\n\nBusiness Information:\n\nBaker Heating & Cooling\n\n2500 N Main St, Dayton, OH 45405, United States\n\n(937) 274-9966"
