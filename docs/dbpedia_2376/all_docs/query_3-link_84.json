        "text": "Neil Armstrong was born in 1930 on the farm of his mother’s parents, southwest of Wapakoneta. After living in a number of Ohio communities, the Armstrongs returned to Wapakoneta in 1944, purchasing a home on W. Benton St. At the time, Neil was in high school. His family included his parents, Stephen and Viola, his sister June, and brother Dean. This is a private residence and should be viewed only from the sidewalk.\n\nSituated in the midst of suburban Wapakoneta, the Temple of Tolerance is truly a whimsical and classic American roadside attraction. The massive labyrinth of walkways and hidden gardens circles through the backyard of Jim Bowsher, the temple's creator. The massive boulders and unique antiques scattered throughout the property took over twenty years to put together. The attraction is open year-round and is free to the public.\n\nUnveiled in July of 2022, \"the Helmet\" is an 11 foot tall art installation that resembles a stylized version of a NASA spacesuit helmet. Accompanying the aluminum and stainless steel spectacle is a granite monument with an engraved image of an Apollo landing mission, an enlarged bootprint from Apollo 11 on the ground, and the four handprints from the Apollo 11 Navy Frogmen, the team that recovered the astronauts after walking on the Moon. This attraction is in the middle of downtown Wapakoneta and can be viewed any time of year for free.\n\nWalking down Auglaize Street, shoppers are greeted by a smiling Neil Armstrong statue, waving to the world as he sits upon a granite bench. The statue is based upon a photograph of Armstrong taken during his homecoming return to Wapakoneta in September of 1969.

Today, people can relive that excitement by sitting and snapping a photo with Wapakoneta's hometown hero.\n\nBlack Hoof was a Chief of the Shawnee. His native name was Catahecassa. Black Hoof fought at the Battle of Fallen Timbers and represented the Shawnee at the signing of the Treaty of Greenville in 1794. He supported peace with the Americans and encouraged all Shawnee to do the same, but conflicts continued. Black Hoof proved to be a major problem for Tecumseh and the Prophet as they tried to unite the local tribes against settlers during the early 1800s. Black Hoof died in 1831, just a year before the Shawnee were removed to Kansas. The monument honoring Chief Black Hoof was erected at the St. Johns Cemetery in 1976.\n\nNeil Armstrong attended Blume High School, graduating from here in 1947.
