        "text": "DAYTON, Ohio (WKEF/WRGT) -- The Dayton History Organization announced on Tuesday it will be expanding one of Carillon Historical Park’s most popular exhibits: The Print Shop.\n\nOn October 15, the organization will break ground that will double the shop’s size, as well as physically linking the expanded shop to two adjacent, existing exhibit buildings. This will help create a new thematic zone within the park that will focus on a portion of the region’s industrial history.\n\nThe Print Shop originally opened in 1988, three years after the idea was introduced to preserve Dayton’s rich history of letterpress printing. It was the first exhibit building that was funded independently of the trust fund established by Colonel Edward A. and Edith Walton Deeds. In the 30-plus years since then, the chop’s dedicated volunteers have worked to utilize equipment dating from the 1880s to the 1930s to produce a variety of printed products for use at the historical park and for the public to buy. Through this effort, the shop is not just a static display, but an active, working exhibit.\n\nThe expansion, which has been funded through the generosity of a Dayton couple who have asked to remain anonymous, was designed to more fully share stories of Dayton’s printing heritage. It will also demonstrate aspects of the letterpress trade that were not previously exhibited. Plus, it will seven more operational printing presses to be installed, as well as related equipment. These pieces, used for decades in Dayton, include: a Kelly Model C, a Miehle Vertical, a Heidelberg Windmill, a Little Giant, a Mergenthaler Linotype, and a Dayton-made Seybold Paper Cutter.\n\n“This expansion is another exciting step toward the implementation of our master plan for the entire Carillon Historical Park campus. As a private, non-profit organization, all of our expansion and improvement projects are funded through the generosity of private individuals, families, foundations, and corporations,” said Dayton History President/CEO Brady Kress. “The philanthropic couple whose gift made this particular project possible is committed to our organization’s educational mission, and to the preservation of Dayton’s significant role in the history of letterpress printing. We are delighted that work is now underway on what will be one of our nation’s premier, working exhibits on the history of America’s early 20th century printing industry.”"
