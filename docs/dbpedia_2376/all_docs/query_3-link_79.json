        "text": "It may seem like a simple statement, but it is crucial to the one who receives it. We need to be needed.\n\n“It is not good for man to be alone.” The Bible records those words as coming from the mouth of God, and they are so true. We need only to look at the recent Covid-induced, forced isolation to see how separation from others wreaks havoc on our psyches. We were created to be in relationships.\n\nAsk a nursing home resident, a soldier overseas, an exhausted mother caring for a newborn, or an inmate in a prison cell what they desire most, and family/companionship will be at the top of their list. You can read it on the smooth faces of a toddler trailing behind siblings or parents, hand raised upwards to grasp a loved one’s hand. You can read it on the wrinkled, tear-streaked face of the elderly woman as her hands turn the worn pages of her photo album full of images of moments passed and friends long gone. We need to be loved. Isolation leads to depression and depression leads to isolation in a vicious circle of downward spiraling darkness.\n\nIt is not good for man to be alone.\n\nThis reality is on my heart as I type these words because of two factors in my own life. Yesterday my wife and I celebrated our 49th wedding anniversary. When we entered the boyfriend/girlfriend phase of our relationship as 13-year-olds, our opposite backgrounds drew us together. I came from a two-parent home of 6 children. Her parents had divorced when she was a baby, and she was an only child. (It might be more accurate to that she was a lonely child.) I first realized how lonely she was on her 14th birthday. My mother always baked and decorated a birthday cake for us on our special days. We were celebrated. So, it was only natural that Mom did the same on my girlfriend’s birthday. When we arrived at the house and she saw the homemade birthday cake and heard the “Happy birthday!” wishes, she broke down and cried. No one had ever baked her a birthday cake before. She had never been celebrated in that way. Secondly, we have two adopted granddaughters. Having come through very different foster home experiences, one battles strong self-worth scars. Being held and loved as an infant, toddler and preschooler is so important, and she was denied those foundational assurances. Even when we are too young to understand, we need to be needed. We need to be cherished.\n\n“You are important to me.” can be spoken in both words and actions.\n\nWe can see that truth played out in wildlife as well. Very few animals are true loners. Just think of all the terms we have to express community in nature. Fish have schools. Sea mammals have pods. Deer have herds. Birds have flocks. (We even have different names for the communal gathering of different species of birds.) Lions have prides. Bees have swarms. Community has value and purpose. And so it is with eagles.\n\nAlthough eagles only tend to gather together in large numbers when other environmental conditions encourage them to do so, eagles still need companionship. The lifelong pair-bond illustrates that reality. Wandering juvenile and sub-adult eagles will find another eagle or two to “hang out with” as they explore. Watching Orv and Willa care for their young and watching the eaglets interact with each other shows how these nurturing days are so vital.\n\n(So much has happened since my last posting. [I have solved the issues from last month regarding the posting of images. I just needed to invest more money in WordPress to keep my blog rolling along.] The eaglets have names and are both flying now. In keeping with the practice of naming the eaglets after Wright brothers, aviation or Dayton history, the Carillon Park folks have named them Delco and Hawthorn.)\n\nThis is Delco. Delco was named in honor of the Dayton Engineering Laboratory Company, founded in 1909 by Daytonians, Col. Edwards Deed and Charles Kettering. Delco later became a subsidiary of the General Motors Corporation and a global supplier of automobile parts as well as other products.\n\nThis is Hawthorn. “Hawthorn” reflects the name of the street where Wright family lived in west Dayton as well as Hawthorn Hill, the Wright mansion in Oakwood. Although Wilbur died in May of 1912, before the home was completed, Orville lived there until his death in January of 1948. (Dayton History’s Carillon Historical Park offers regular tours of the mansion.) Delco fledged almost a week before Hawthorn, and both are doing well.\n\nOrv and Willa have been wonderfully diligent parents. As with their 14 previous eaglets, the parents have been quite inspirational in regard to their dedication and abilities in childcare. That devotion enables and encourages their offspring to step out with confidence into the world beyond their aerie. Already the young flyers are learning new skills and exhibiting a freedom that we earthbound beings only dream about.\n\nAs in the past 6 years, Delco and Hawthorn prefer to land on unobstructed perches. As they develop even greater confidence and skills, the leafy tree canopy will become less of a threat for safe perching. This current fondness for park benches, picnic tables, fences and buildings leave them more exposed. This exposure provides advantages to photographers and park visitors in viewing the pair, but also makes them more vulnerable. As urban eagles they will have to accept the presence of humans within their habitat, but they must not become too acceptable of human beings. Juvenile eagles can become human-imprinted if they see people as a source of food or companionship, so I stress a deep respect for their “wildness” to park patrons. Some humans cannot be trusted, and others might become fearful of the presence of a large bird of prey nearby. Both juvenile and adult eagles need a healthy wariness of man for long term survival.\n\nBut eagles desperately need each other, especially when young and curious. Unable to yet hunt for themselves, they are reliant on Orv and Willa for food. Yesterday morning Orv caught a duck on the Great Miami River, just outside the park. He flew into the park and found both Delco and Hawthorn on the top of the operating, 1930 era print shop within the park. The hungry kids were anticipating the ‘roofdash’ delivery. Orv plucked some feathers from breakfast and enjoyed a few bites. Being the messy eater that he is, Orv had a few feather fibers stuck to his beak as he stepped aside.\n\nBefore long, hungry Hawthorn took its turn. After about 10 minutes, Dad shooed Hawthorn away and allowed Delco to dine. Both Orv and Hawthorn looked on as if wondering if a morsel or two might remain after Delco had had its fill.\n\nAfter grabbing a few more bites from the leftovers, Orv flew off to his guard post overlooking the river and Delco and Hawthorn flew to the lowest limb of a nearby tree. There they would perch for hours as visitors passed by, and camera shutters chattered.\n\nWith full crops, they sat on that limb, exchanged a few words and then drifted off to sleep. Napping comes easy after a good meal with the security of family and friends nearby.\n\nEven when no words are spoken, companionship speaks volumes. Just knowing that someone is there, just knowing that you are important, can soothe a weary heart. This period of youthful vulnerability will pass quickly for our juveniles, but the need to for companionship will be with them for a lifetime. In 5 years, as they reach maturity and begin nesting with a forever mate, they will pass on what they have experienced to a new generation. They are lessons we have all known. As summertime blossoms and brings opportunity to join together with loved ones, may we all remember that it is not good for man to be alone. We need one another.\n\nThough we may never meet in person, dear reader, be assured that you are important to me.\n\nMother’s Day became a recognized holiday 110 years ago, when President Woodrow Wilson designated the second Sunday in May as a day to honor mothers. (Much to the delight of greeting card companies and florists, I’m sure.)\n\nMothers are indeed worthy of the honor.\n\nI lost my own sweet mother 33 years ago, but I still miss her dearly. She was the quiet support of my early life. A World War II veteran (as was my father) she served in the U.S. Army Nursing Corps, an experience that came in handy while raising us 5 boys and 1 girl. (Someone was always sporting a bandage on something.) She was a true homemaker. Her humble spirit blessed all who crossed the thresholds. Daily, routine and mundane chores, like doing laundry with an old ringer washer, hanging wet clothes on the backyard clotheslines, vacuuming, sweeping, scrubbing the kitchen linoleum floors, planning and making dinners on a tight budget, inspecting behind the ears of sweaty boys to ensure proper hygiene… were all done with a smile in her heart and a song on her lips. That woman loved to sing. One of my fondest childhood, memories is one of lying on the living room floor and listening to Mom sing as she ironed clothes. It was a hot summer day, and without air conditioning, the windows were open while the warm breeze wafted through the house and intermixed with the aroma of the steam iron and freshly, pressed fabric. There stood my precious mother, hair tied back in a scarf, sweat on her brow, iron in hand and softly singing her way through the day. My mother was indeed my first love.\n\n“Love”\n\nThere you have it. The one word that captures what it means to be a mother is “love.” Mom was the one who kissed away our toddling boo-boos. She was the one who tucked us in at night. During the traumatic and dramatic emotions of our teenage years, Mom would quietly hold our hands in hers as she listened to the sobbing laments of broken hearts, while Dad threatened to “give us something to cry about.”\n\nI remember watching those gentle hands change over the decades. Strength slowly faded and the skin grew thin. I witnessed the arms that joyously embraced her children and grandchildren lose their strength to the passage of time. My heart still aches as I remember the last time I held those hands as we said our final good-byes. The time had come for her to go home to Jesus. Her race was finished. Her crown had been won. She would soon hear her Savior’s greeting, “Well done, my good and faithful servant!” and she would be embraced in the strongest arms this world has ever known and feel His scarred and gracious hand upon her back. I knew then that or parting was temporary, but oh, how much I missed her… and still do. I have been so greatly blessed.\n\nLove is manifested in devotion. And devotion is what we are seeing from our eagle, Willa, these days.\n\n(I apologize for the lack of recent postings. Unfortunately, WordPress, the online provider for my blog, has changed their software, making it impossible to upload images to my posts. The images are the heart of Orv and Willa’s story, but until the problem is corrected, only text can be shared. WordPress is working on the problem.)\n\nBut let me catch you up. Eggs were lain around on February 19th and 21st. Pipping took place around March 25 and 27. The two eaglets are now 47 and 45 days old. As usual, school fieldtrips have been making their way to the park, including 771 visitors just last Friday. So, several hundred children were able to see the youngsters in the nest and many shouted with excitement as the adults flew in and out!\n\nThe eaglets are in the middle of their accelerated growth period. They should be as big as Mom and Dad by the end of May and ready to fly about two weeks later.\n\nWilla is a great mother. (I wish I could post the images of her feeding the eaglets, bringing soft grass to the nest to carpet the nursery floor and of her carrying fish home to the hungry duo.)\n\nMy mother was my greatest defender. She grew fierce when anyone or anything threatened her children. (Close up image of Willa flying directly toward the camera with a very determined look on her face, should go here.)\n\nI wonder if any of the previous eaglets ever bring her a gift for Mother’s Day?\n\nMothers are a true blessing. If your mother is still around, let her know how much you appreciate her dedicated sacrifices over the years. Surprise her with flowers, candy, a nice dinner out, or even a freshly caught fish. (OK, maybe the fish should be left for the eagles.) But make the effort to spend time with Mom while you still have the opportunity to do so. Time together is the best way to say, “Happy Mother’s Day!”\n\nOften we will run across the phrase, “seasons of life” on a printed page, or in a conversation, or elsewhere. Just as the calendar passes from spring to summer to autumn and to winter, life seems to pass through various seasons as we journey along its course. All seasons are periods of activity, each differing from one another, each bearing its own distinct characteristics.\n\nWhen we were carried along through the carefree days of childhood, time seemed somewhat endless. Each school day somehow dragged on for what seemed like months, and the month of December languished for decades as we awaited the holidays. Those were simple times where the bigger issues of life were handled by our parents and others. Our late teens and early twenties ushered in a season of exploration, independence and decision making as we answered the “What now?” questions of life after mandatory schooling. Our late twenties, thirties and most of our forties were seasons of being carried along on the winds of necessity. Employment requirements, mortgage payments, childrearing, grocery bills and every other immediate demand had us jumping from task to task, pausing to catch our breath only during the annual vacation, before putting nose to the grindstone again. Somewhere in the late forties, early fifties, our homes grew quiet while our own children entered their new seasons. We began to contemplate the reality of aging bodies, the potential of changing incomes and the need to plan with a deeper sense of urgency. Then our sixties ushered in a season of real change. Our bodies begin to show the wear and tear of life. We look at young people and wonder if we were ever that spry. (They call it being “over the hill”. What hill? I don’t even remember a hill! Maybe that is why the forties and fifties were so challenging. Was I going uphill all that time and too busy to notice? Once over the hill, things pick up speed as we careen down the other side. The previous decades of life seem to have flashed by. [Was that appearance of The Beatles on Ed Sullivan really 6 decades ago!?] On this side of the hill gravity seems stronger. Just getting up off the floor is proof of that fact. My physique shows the reality of the growing gravitational pull as well. What use to be chest muscles have given into the strain and have sunk down to my waistband, losing firmness in the process. Loosening my belt might prove disastrous!) Then the “Golden Years” welcome us with open arms and aching bodies. Doctors begin to pass us along from one to another like an inner office memo carried from one in/out tray to the next. We feel like an automobile as they hoist us onto the lift and check the pressure in our tires, draw oil for analysis, and hook up wires to check the timing of our engines. (At least we are finally considered classics.) It can leave us feeling dented and deflated. But by now, we have had enough miles on the odometer to take it in stride. Seasons come and seasons go.\n\nBut, have you ever considered the “seasonings of life”? Seasonings give food flavor. Some seasonings preserve. Life’s seasonings are many. The sweetness of a smile from a newborn child or grandchild, the memory of a long-gone parent’s hug or voice, a song that reminds us of a sweeter day of yesteryear… Then there are more bitter seasonings of life like loss, a wayward child, an unexpected diagnosis… Both sweet and bitter seasonings blend together to make life palatable and even tasty. Without one, we would lack appreciation of the other. And we cannot forget the preservative quality of salty tears. Isn’t it wonderful that times of great sorrow and times of great joy are seasoned with tears? And just like the ability of tastebuds to savor the flavor of food, God has blessed us with hearts that can savor the flavor of life and memories to keep them fresh forever! How truly blessed we are.\n\nLife’s seasons embrace our eagles as well.\n\nAs the calendar turns from 2023 to 2024 we find Orv and Willa returning their focus to home. Nestorations are ongoing and mating has begun! Both eagles are wearing their “Sunday best”, crisp, clean feathers that glisten in the sunlight! They make sure that every feather is perfect!\n\nEven after years of togetherness, they like to look their best when courting. (And boy, are they spectacular!!!)\n\nWherever they are, they are alert and looking for any roaming eagles that might intrude on their domain. As we get closer to egg-laying in mid-February, Orv and Willa will become even more territorial.\n\nAnd they have good reasons to be on the lookout! We have seen more nomadic eagles in the area this year than ever before! Winter is the time to spot them as young adult pairs search for unclaimed territory while sub-adults, immatures and juveniles congregate around waterways, lakes and ponds. Leafless trees make then all easier to spot.\n\nOf course, every couple will have the occasional disagreement. Orv and Willa are no different. But Willa seems to have a way of always getting the final word.\n\nNo matter what season of life in which you find yourself, may it be one of gratitude for the blessings that come your way. We may not know what tomorrow holds, but we know that whatever comes our way comes through God’s loving hands. The new year is here and coming on strong. Sometimes blessings are hard to see, but whether sweet, bitter or salty, may 2024 find you savoring the flavor of the seasonings of life!\n\nDo we ever get too old to be amazed?\n\nMaybe too busy, too stubborn or too proud, but never too old. The world is full of amazing things from a tiny ant laboriously lugging a scrap of food home, to the blur of hummingbird wings, to the vast depth of a desert sky, we are surrounded by amazing blessings. The challenge is for us to take the time – to make the time – to slow down and humbly take note of their presence.\n\nThat can be a real problem amid the busyness of the holiday season. Isn’t it funny how we take a day set aside to remember a tiny infant, born in the humblest surroundings on a silent, oil lamp-lit night, and smother it in so much glitz and glitter, hustle and bustle that we find ourselves weary and frustrated rather than renewed and amazed?\n\nI am thankful that Orv and Willa seem to (literally) rise above it all. Their domain is aglow with lights, serenaded with carols, and full of scurrying humans this month as the Carillon Christmas is in full swing. What? You have never seen the yuletide celebration at Carillon? Well, grab your coat, scarf and gloves climb into my Highlander. It may not be a one-horse open sleigh and we haven’t seen the first flake of snow, but we are sure to see eagles!\n\nThe sun is sinking low in the western sky as we approach the park. Exiting the highway and cruising along the levee of The Great Miami River, we smile as we notice two friends contentedly watching the traffic zipping along the highway. They love to sit in the sun, above the fray and the din of ever-rushing humans. Orv and Willa’s presence atop the electrical tower brings smiles because it reminds us that they are devoted to one another, and that commitment bodes well for the promise of more eaglets in 2024. It also means that we are in for a treat. We know that every night at sunset they wing their way home and we haven’t missed it! They are extremely punctual. Last night they flew in at 5:38, the day before at 5:40 and two days ago at 5:36! It is already 4:45 and we still are a mile from the park we have no time to waste!\n\nWe leave the love birds behind as we drive on. The Carillon tower has been converted into a huge Christmas tree of lights that will be illuminated soon. The nip in the air has kept the crowd down tonight so parking is no problem at all. We exit the car and head for the main door of the Kettering Educational Center. Inside we are immediately greeted by a friendly volunteer. After paying for our admission, we head to the rear doors that open onto the green. On our way through the building, we pass by the open doors of Culp’s Cafe, one of the park’s two restaurants. I comment on how I watched as they lowered the restored Barney and Smith (a Dayton company) streetcar into the building during construction.\n\nAs we exit into the park the brisk air testifies that it is December after all. Wanting to beat Orv and Willa to their nest, we bypass the historic buildings, many housing holiday exhibits like roasting chestnuts, puppet shows and the like. The fading daylight adds a rather festive touch to the millions of lights that adorn our pathway. As we pass the new “industrial block” housing the working 1930s print shop and the old Sunoco filling station, we notice that the lights of the Carillon belltower have come to life.\n\nWe talk about “the good old days” when gas stations were truly service stations as we ascend the steps to Wright Hall. I recall, “Back in the day, the ‘ding, ding’ of the service station bell brought uniformed attendants to your car window. They politely greeted you, offered to check your car’s oil level and wiper blades as well as clean your windshield while they pumped the gas. All the while you could sit in the nice warm car.” You point out that I sound more and more like a grandfather when I make those statements. (Well, if the shoe fits…)\n\nOrv and Willa’s nest (also known as the Hillside Condo), above Wright Hall, is unoccupied as we arrive. We turn to scan the northern skies for any sign of their approach. Nothing yet. The lights are becoming even more festive as the daylight wanes.\n\nIt is only 5:15 now and the first few visitors venture past us as we wait. “Have you folks noticed our bald eagles’ nest up in that tree?” I ask. “The what?” a gentleman inquires. “The bald eagles’ nest up there.” I say as I point upward. “Wow!!!” is the relatively universal response to the first glimpse of the nest. We smile again. As I share about Orv and Willa’s 2018 arrival here in the park and a bit of their successes and challenges over the years, more and more people gather. I share that the eagles should be arriving any minute now. (One woman immediately grabs her cellphone and calls her husband, who is apparently elsewhere in the park. With her phone on speaker mode, we cannot help but overhear the conversation: “Hello?” – “Joe! Get over here! The eagles should be flying in soon!” – “The what?” – “The eagles!” – “Real eagles?” – “Yes! Real eagles!” – “Where are you?” – “Across from the gas station! Hurry!” – “On my way!” As she turns back towards the group, we are all smiling. A bit embarrassed she says, “My husband loves eagles.” Oh, I understand” I assure her. In about 2 minutes Joe comes jogging up with a cup of hot chocolate in each hand. [Scenes like that play out all day long here in the park and I never tire of witnessing those moments. Amazement is a wonderful thing.]) By now it is 5:30 and darkness is falling. As I answer questions from the group of about 15 people, I point to the northern sky and call out, “Eagle!” Here they come! In the fading light a dark image emerges. Willa skirts over the treetops with Orv about five feet behind her. They head directly to the nest as the crowd watches in amazement. I explain that they usually fly to the nest for a minute or two before relocating to their roost tree. Our new friend Joe asks, “Why? Don’t they sleep in the nest?” I joke that they only fly to the nest to turn off the coffee maker and lock up. Then I explain that the nest is just a nursery, so when there are no eggs or eaglets in the nest, Orv and Willa roost overnight in a large tree just west of the nest tree. The words are barely out of my mouth when both eagles relocate to the roost tree. There they will lock their feet, ankles and knees as they drift of to sleep, unimpressed by the ongoing Christmas festivities. Normally the park closes at 5PM and sunset is much later in the summer, so Carillon Christmas provides a rare and fleeting opportunity to witness eagles coming home to roost. We stand there chatting with passing park patrons as Orv and Willa settle down for a long winter’s nap.\n\nEven the frequent passing of the new Carillon train doesn’t disturb them. Urban eagles are adapting well to noisy, crowded environments. Rural eagles would become agitated at unusual human activity near their nests. This is just one more wonderful aspect of Orv and Willa’s presence here in the park.\n\nNow that the sun has set, the bitterness begins to grow in the air. We decide to seek the warmth of some of the historic buildings and exhibits throughout the park. (Maybe we can even discover where Joe found that hot chocolate.) We stroll west toward the brightly lit steel bridge.\n\nBuilt by the Columbia Bridge Company of Dayton, the bridge features a wooden floor. As we look north towards the Transportation Building, we see the glow of a strategically placed Christmas tree.\n\nThe trees reflection is visible in each panel of the large, curved building.\n\nCrossing the bridge, we pause to look west at the old Gem City clock that for decades adorn the top of the Callahan Building at Third and Main Streets downtown. Those were the days when a town clock kept everyone synchronized.\n\nAs we make our way back through the park, we stop into the print shop where the presses are running. On a table there we find many samples of their work for sale. They even have a few pictures of Orv and Willa for sale that were taken by me and others over the years. Leaving the print shop we pass by the Old River light tower. This structure once stood on the center walkway of the swimming pool at N.C.R.’s Old River Park. (I cannot pass that tower without remembering the long summer hours my wife and I spent at that pool as teenagers, decades and decades ago.)\n\nWe zip our coats a little tighter to ward off the chill. As we pass the sign for the Wright Brother’s National Museum, a National Park within the private Carillon Historical Park grounds, we look back over the Wright Cycle Company building and Wright Hall to take one last glance at the Hillside Condo and our local eagles asleep for the night. All is calm, all is bright.\n\nThe momentary silence is broken by the laughter of children. High on the hillside kids are frolicking through the big tube slides that run down the hill. The walkway is festooned with white lights and the slides are decorated with alternating rings of red and white lights to resemble giant candy canes. Some of the children have taken off their winter coats as they play. Brrrr! Amazing!\n\nJust to the east we strike pay dirt! Here we find the Little Carillon Cafe and the source of Joe’s hot chocolate! This quaint little building served as a park Culp’s Cafe restaurant until the larger venue was built inside the Kettering Building a few years ago. We stop inside to warm up our bodies, inside and out.\n\nWith our second cups of hot beverage in hand, we make our way toward the exit, passing by the outdoor patio next to the little cafe. Giant nutcrackers guard the patrons, warming themselves by an open fire.\n\nJust a bit further we discover that the new Carillon train has pulled into the station to welcome aboard new passengers. The beautiful little engine looks quite Christmasy as it glistens in the darkness. Although it is really electric powered, it sure looks like an authentic steam locomotive.\n\nThe Kettering Educational Building houses the bulk of the park’s smaller exhibits along with Culp’s Cafe, a large meeting venue, the Museum store, a Dayton-themed carousel and much, much more. As we reenter the doors, we glance one last time towards the nest, but the night’s darkness has swallowed it from sight.\n\nJust inside the building we pass under a Wight kite and pass by the big Carillon mural. We hurry along for the hour is getting late and the air is getting colder. But we cannot leave the park without stopping by the bell tower wearing its Christmas tree lights.\n\nExiting the front door we get our first view of the region’s tallest “Christmas tree”. At around 170 feet tall, it is truly impressive. The closer we get to the tower, the more amazing it becomes!\n\nThe Carillon is ringing out Christmas carols as we approach. The tree of lights can regularly draw a crowd, but the bitter air means we have it almost all to ourselves.\n\nAs we climb the small rise, we are even more amazed by the striking contrast of the lights against the darkness.\n\nWe pass through the entryway and find ourselves inside the tree! The big bells of the tower ring out loud and clear in the crisp night air, proclaiming, “Christ the Savior is born!”\n\nLooking back down the slope to the Kettering Center we begin to wonder. How many marriage proposals have these lights witnessed over the years? How many twirling children have become dizzy looking up at these lights? How many embraces, kisses, smiles…?\n\nLeaving the tower and unanswered musings behind, we head back to my Highlander. With the heater running full blast, we make our way to the highway. We make a quick stop down the road to look back across the Stewart Street bridge for one last glance at the huge tree. Light splitting the darkness, reminds me of why we celebrate that silent night when light came into the darkness of mankind.\n\nWe drive home in reverent silence as we think of all the wonders we have encountered: the devotion of the eagles, the beauty of the lights, the smiles on the faces, the joyous glow of the tower against the stifling darkness, the proclamation that Christ the Saviour is born! May your home be filled with love and laughter this Christmas as you gather and ponder the true message of Christmas. May your heart be encouraged as you consider how we are surrounded by blessing after blessing. May we never grow too old to be amazed. May you find God’s good tidings of great joy to be … well, simply amazing!\n\nMany decades ago, those three words of encouragement seemed to be everywhere. Everything from bumper stickers, blankets and the occasional billboard reminded the weary that struggles were temporary and better times were ahead if we would just remember to “Hang in there!” Millions of posters boldly proclaimed the hopeful words, most of which featured the image of a kitten dangling from a tree branch, held there only by its front claws. The image was meant to show the reality of weakness and vulnerability facing a reliable and sure determination.\n\nMore recently, the phrase “Keep calm and carry on.” has reemerged as a popular slogan. Although this particular phrase was first popularized in Great Britain during the second world war, the newer versions have taken on some modern twists. Posters, bumper stickers, tee shirts and other things proclaim, “Keep calm and carry a…” ending the sentence with gun, big stick, Bible, voter registration card or another item.\n\nWhether one is hanging in there or keeping calm, the success in the challenge is heavily reliant on the item to which we have attached ourselves. How sturdy is that branch from which we dangle? How useful is the item we choose to carry? Determination and a stiff backbone can serve us well, but trusting in something that is untrustworthy may prove to be disastrous! Misplaced faith is often painful. That is a bit of wisdom we usually learn as we age. I am grateful for those lessons and for God’s faithfulness in protecting me through my adolescent foolishness all those decades ago.\n\nSpeaking of “carrying on”, the annual explosion of autumn color was spectacular this year. My wife and I were able to spend a week in the Shenandoah region of Virginia in October and the trees were singing in a way that only they can! What a beautiful world we live in!\n\nAnd back here at home Orv and Willa’s Hillside Condo was awash with the autumn regalia as well. From the park’s namesake Carillon tower…\n\nto the 65 acres of historical buildings and exhibits…\n\nto the hillside below their nest,\n\nthe leaves were carrying on with their annual, brief burst of exuberance before the upcoming winter’s rest. Like a last hurrah of summer or a crescendo in the final measure of the growing season’s symphony, the colors were a joy orchestrated for our eyes.\n\nThe concept of “hanging in there” in difficult and challenging circumstances is common for wildlife. Survival is full of such trying times. I’ve often discussed the manmade obstacles for survival in these postings, like electrical lines, lead fishing weights, discarded monofilament line, lead shot, automobile traffic, but there are many natural challenges too. The scarcity of food may be a threat. Attacks from predators can be life-threatening. Even simple accidents can lead to terrible results. While we were away in Virginia, Willa survived one such accidental event. Roger captured the following images of Willa as she struggled high in a treetop where she had managed to wedge her right foot in the tight fork of her perch! I can only imagine the feeling of fear and helplessness that Roger felt as he documented her 4-minute attempt to dislodge her foot. Having witnessed similar situations, I am sure Roger was talking out loud, saying things like, “No, no, no! Come on girl! You can do it!” as if the eagle could understand.\n\nWhat a relief it must have been for both human and eagle when she finally succeeded if freeing her foot and becoming airborne again!\n\nThat was taking “Hang in there!” a step too far!\n\nShe escaped from the ordeal with no apparent injury, except maybe to her pride. A few days later I was able to capture a few closeup images of her feet, just to be sure talons and toes all looked healthy.\n\nAn eagle’s feet are its primary weapons of offense and defense as well as their means of snatching prey, so healthy feet are necessary for healthy life.\n\nChallenges can happen at any time. Like Willa, we can often trust in our God-given abilities to overcome those events. As those circumstances arise – because they will – may we all be able to be more than conquerors. May we, like Willa, find ourselves smiling on the other side of the struggle, having been tried and tested by turmoil and having grown during those unexpected times when we were forced to hang in there.\n\nTaken for granted, bewildered and spurned\n\nWith the passage of time there are lessons to learn.\n\nHow can a blessing we once held so dear\n\nDiminish as treasure as year follows year?\n\nNo one likes to be taken for granted, but it happens to everyone sooner or later. As I pondered that reality, I realized that probably the most taken for granted people on Earth are found in families.\n\nParents know that “Mom and Dad” are titles filled with blessings and struggles, and that those placed within our lives who earn us those titles seldom voice their appreciation for the loving sacrifices made on their behalf. But generally, parents don’t mind. The love they have for their children is enough to supersede any desire for acknowledgement or recognition. Love is like that. Still, there are times when a “Thank you.” or an “I love you.” can lift one’s spirits and brighten one’s day, especially in those moments of self-doubt or when age limits one’s ability and self-perceived usefulness. Maybe more important is true appreciation within a marriage. Husbands and wives once enthralled simply by the presence of one another often pass through life in such a way that they become overly accustomed to their spouse’s reliability and presence. Unresolved hurts and unappreciated sacrifices leave emotional scarring over time making communication difficult and warm affection blocked by cold clouds of indifference and a suffocating feeling of futility. It becomes easier to avoid confronting the issues as they gradually build upon themselves, brick by brick resulting in a fortress that seems impenetrable.\n\nBut love is stronger than any fortress.\n\nI guess this topic is on my heart today because I have attended way too many funerals lately. I am a teacher at heart. It is the way God has designed me. It is a blessing to teach about our eagles, but I also have the privilege of co-teaching Bible classes on Tuesday evenings and Sunday mornings and over the last few years I have attended memorial services for 8 dear friends from the Sunday morning class. Although they were all advanced in age, they all left grieving loved ones behind. Spouses, children, grandchildren who are no longer able to mend the smoldering bridges of the past. I have reached the age where every day I read that another musician, celebrity or other person from my childhood days has passed away. I feel for their families. One of the most tragic sentences ever uttered is “We just drifted apart.” Drifting requires very little effort.\n\nOur eaglets have drifted apart from Orv and Willa. They are off to new adventures, exploring new frontiers. We will see more juveniles along our rivers as the winter approaches, but we will not be able to identify our own.\n\nOrv and Willa are drifting too. But they are drifting together. Wild eagles seldom hold grudges. They know that survival depends on committed teamwork and mutual devotion. They are strengthening their pair-bond through spending time together.\n\nWhether the weather has left them unsettled and soaking wet…\n\nor quietly sleeping high and dry on a sunlit day…\n\nthey are enjoying this brief season of relative calm. In a few weeks their attention will again turn to home as together they begin the necessary work of preparing the nest for the 2024 eaglets.\n\nWhatever the challenge might be, Orv and Willa will look it straight in the eye…\n\nand do whatever is necessary to triumph, together!\n\nI am sure that young adult eagles are currently busy building their first nests somewhere in the Dayton region. As leaves fall, new nests will be revealed. Some folks are already becoming accustomed to their return and are no longer surprised by their appearance. But many of us are still fascinated by these majestic creatures that were missing from our skies for 7 decades. We still gather to watch and learn as they teach us new lessons about commitment, survival and overcoming obstacles. I mean, how could a face like this ever be taken for granted?\n\nOne force of nature that is seldom recognized and even less often appreciated is drifting. But drifting happens everywhere and drifting is constant.\n\nMost dictionaries define drifting as “carried slowly by a current of air or water.” (I believe that definition falls far short of capturing the totality of the term, but then I have never published a dictionary, so let’s start with that definition and see where my thoughts drift.)\n\nMany of us have had the experience of playing in the waves along the seashore, perhaps buoying on an inflatable float, swimming or just jumping into the breaking waves. After even ten or fifteen minutes of carefree frolicking we are often surprised to discover that our beach towels have quite mysteriously moved some distance up the beach from where we find ourselves. Did someone move the towels as soon as our backs were turned? Of course not! We simply drifted with the currents. Similarly, resting in raft on a lazy river can provide a relaxing, carefree escape from the problems of life as we drift along, at least until we hit the rapids that demand our attention. I find a special thrill in watching our eagles drifting along on a thermal updraft, effortlessly gaining more and more altitude. I confess that I become a bit envious when realizing that such a carefree experience is beyond my abilities.\n\n“Drifting” and being “carefree” seem to waft along together like two close friends always finding comfort in their companionship. (Come to think of it, the conversation between close friends often drifts from topic to topic so naturally that it is difficult to recall how they have arrived at the current topic from where they had started.) Drifting happens.\n\nBut drifting isn’t always positive. Couples unfortunately drift apart. Children make poor choices when finding friends and drift into trouble. Cultures drift away from once-treasured standards and eventually collapse. Unbridled spending can cause one to slowly drift into bankruptcy. My problem with that dictionary definition is that water and air are not the only things that have currents and currents can go unnoticed because they are often gentle movements. The challenge with drifting is recognizing where the current is heading. Waterfalls are both beautiful and dangerous.\n\nSo, what is the solution for drifting when potential disaster looms downstream? An anchor! Devotion to one’s spouse is an anchor. Respect for your parents’ guidance in deciding with whom you congregate is an anchor. Seeing the value in established norms is a cultural anchor. Commitment to a budget is a financial anchor. For me personally, my faith in God and my commitment to His word is the trustworthy anchor that has never failed me through countless storms and raging currents. Anchors are true necessities in life, even in the wildlife that surrounds us.\n\nOur trio of eaglets are unknowingly releasing the anchor that has secured their foundation to the area. Any day now the youngsters will begin to drift away from Carillon Park and the iconic carillon tower that not only gives the park its name but has served for an occasional perch for the kids.\n\nI am sure that they do not comprehend how their lives are changing as self-proficiency severs the tethers that have anchored them to Orv and Willa. As they are now hunting for themselves and allowing their curiosity to lead them away from Mom and Dad’s constant oversight, they are becoming independent.\n\nThey will remain true drifters for about 5 years, wandering throughout the region until they each pair-bond with a lifelong mate and begin nesting and putting down roots. (It is hard to drift when you are well-rooted.)\n\nOrv and Willa have done a remarkable job bringing the trio to this point. Like so many parents, they look a bit tired and contemplative these days.\n\nThey will enjoy several weeks of well deserved, restful togetherness as they strengthen their bond to one another. Their continued success at their Hillside Condo reinforces the reliability of their anchor to both nest and territory. They rule the skies for miles around, and they have mastered the currents that would carry them away.\n\n(Speaking of the condo, I snapped this image from directly under the nest just hours ago. I am still concerned about its stability and the lack of a supporting limb on the south side of the structure that is seen toward the bottom of the image. An eagle’s aerie is more than a bundle of random sticks. The timbers are somewhat interlaced with each other and the soft materials [leaves, grasses, pine boughs, etc.] that are built into the nest fill voids, makes the nest a rather solid structure. As the image shows, the current nest is almost evenly built on either side of a sturdy limb and that decaying, dead limb that first drew their attention 5 years ago and runs through the north side of the nest is looking pretty dark as it deteriorates. If the under-supported south side should fall, the remainder of the nest will follow. That is exactly what happened back on February 17th of 2022. Should that happen, Orv and Willa will very likely rebuild for a third time.)\n\nThe challenges in life are constant, but the joy of life makes overcoming the struggles worth the effort. We can have carefree experiences without being careless. That is one of life’s big lessons as we gain maturity. Anchors are necessary and important tools when subtle currents tend to lull us into a disregard for the potential dangers of drifting.\n\nHappy Independence Day America! Today we celebrate the birth of our nation 247 years ago. There will be backyard cook-outs, parades, fireworks and other festivities to commemorate that historical event when declaring our independence brought freedom.\n\nBut what is freedom?\n\nSome dictionaries define freedom as “the ability to act as one wishes, without constraints or restrictions.” That definition within a societal setting seems to lead toward chaos as well. The truth is that freedom always walks hand-in-hand with responsibility.\n\nThat balance was something our Founding Father wrestled with way back then. So what were their foundational ideas upon which they constructed a nation? Well, if we look at the historic text of The Declaration of Independence we will find that after a brief paragraph explaining why they were breaking the bonds with England citing “the laws of nature and of nature’s God,” they were quick to note the cornerstone of that foundation in the opening sentence of their carefully and intentionally drafted second paragraph of the document. “We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.” Let’s take a moment to reflect on that sentence. “Truths” that are “self-evident” are undeniable realities that are obvious. (Somehow, today we struggle to admit the obvious.) “All men are created equal” means all human beings are of equal value, regardless of race, gender, social status etc. (Boy, have we struggled with that self-evident truth, then and now.) “Endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights” reflects their foundational assertion that the true source of each and every right is God and God alone, not government, ruling classes, societal movements, or anything/anyone else. The Founders further stated that these rights were “unalienable” meaning that these rights could not be given away or taken away. Then they listed a few (“among these”) of the many rights bestowed on mankind from God: “Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness”. (Again, we find that we struggle to define these once simple concepts.) This document was the start of it all. It resulted in the need to set up a working government with checks and balances and a constitution to better define that government and how those rights would be protected. Freedom and responsibility walking hand-in-hand.\n\nFreedom has many interpretations. Some see freedom as a free-for-all ability to do whatever they want, regardless of the consequences of their actions. The Bible states the true freedom can only be found in Christ. (This is a freedom that I can personally attest to over the last 5 decades of my life. A deep freedom that grows more precious every day and has carried me through loss, heartache and agony with peace and joy in the midst of the struggles.) No matter how one describes freedom, it is never free. It is always obtained and maintained by the blood of those willing to sacrifice whatever it takes to secure it.\n\nInterestingly, when that declaration was signed and proclaimed on July 4th, 1776, Congress appointed a committee to decide on a national symbol for the new nation. That committee took 6 years to agree on the American bald eagle as that symbol. The bald eagle officially received that designation on June 20, 1782.\n\nOur bald eagles at Carillon successfully launched all three eaglets last weekend! Ace, Aerial and Glider are currently gracing the canopies of the stately trees throughout the park. They are honing their abilities and seem to be quite adventurous. Park visitors are thrilled to see the juveniles low in the trees, perched upon rooftops and even together on the ground as the youngster’s curiosity often gets the better of them. They have so much to learn. Ace was the first to fledge late on June 22nd or very early on the 23rd. Aerial fledged at 1:33 on the afternoon of June 23rd and Glider flew from the nest on the afternoon of June 25th. The initial flights were all without injury. Aerial did become a bit entangled in leafy branches upon its first landing but was able to free itself under Orv’s watchful eye.\n\nFor the next few weeks they will be easy to spot within the park, flying gracefully overhead or standing erect on tree limbs.\n\nWherever they are found, they are constantly watching and learning. Highly intelligent and with the unbridled curiosity of childhood, if they are awake, they are searching their surroundings gaining new information and hoping for another food delivery by Mom or Dad.\n\nTo my heart, true freedom is exemplified in those majestic birds. I am blessed to be able to witness them daily after decades of longing to see wild eagles. As I look at their inquisitive gaze, I cannot but wonder what lies in the future for these youngsters as they embrace their God-given freedom!\n\nMaybe I’m just getting old. Maybe I am out of touch with today’s culture. But it sure seems to me that integrity and commitment are harder to find these days.\n\nAs Father’s Day approaches I find myself remembering my own father and his immeasurable impact on my life. I was taught the meaning of each of those words by my loving, but strict father. He modeled those values and made sure that they became firmly embedded in my character. Together, integrity plus commitment equal respect, and respect was BIG with Dad. Case in point: When I was around 12 years of age I wanted to have some spending money, so I started my own neighborhood mowing service. Since I had no cash yet on hand, Dad loaned me the money to purchase a gas-powered, push mower. Profits from my first few mowing jobs went back to Dad to repay the loan. As my “business” was getting off the ground, my father made sure that I modeled integrity and commitment into my work in respect for the trust my customers were placing in me. Dad insisted on one more rule from the start. He knew that there were a number of elderly, widowed ladies in the area who were unable to keep up with the demands of lawn maintenance. Dad had me contact each of those dear ladies and offer to mow their lawns each week for no charge. (At the time I did not like the idea as generating spending money seemed to be my initial goal in starting the endeavor.) As I served these ladies I discovered that they had other needs as well, like the trimming of shrubs and minor repairs. Soon I realized that there are profits that go beyond mere money. I never received a penny from those customers, but I did discovery that elderly widows make wonderful sandwiches and refreshing iced tea. I spent many post-mowing minutes seated in the shade with these ladies as I sipped tea, ate ginormous sandwiches and chatted about neighborhood activities, as they shared their memories and their hearts with me.\n\nIt seems to me that many of our cultural standards have eroded away in the past few decades. Maybe I am just getting old.\n\nTwo of the attributes that I admire in our bald eagles are their integrity and commitment. It seems to come naturally to them, instinctively driven to do what needs to be done without complaint.\n\nThe demands of rearing a trio of eaglets can be daunting, but both Orv and Willa take those demands in stride. As I type these words the “kids” are 64, 62 and 60 days old. Two months ago they were just a few inches long, in just over a week they will be as large as Mom and Dad! That rapid growth has put quite a strain on Orv and Willa as they have met the caloric needs of the trio.\n\nThe needs are great but there is no shortage of available prey. They frequently add goslings, small rodents, ducks or turtles to the menu that mostly features fish, fish and more fish. It seems like as soon as one entree is consumed; it is time to fly off to catch the next course.\n\nFor some time I was concerned about the welfare of the youngest eaglet as older siblings might feed so aggressively that the smaller, more vulnerable eaglet might become severely undernourished. Our images were only capturing two eaglets, but we had no way of determining if they were always the same two birds. Now that the babies are larger, we are clearly seeing all three! In about 2 weeks they should begin fledging! That is always both an exciting and dangerous time.\n\nAlthough the eaglets are now able to tear into the food that is delivered to the nest, Mom and Dad do still feed them beak to beak at times. Doing this allows the youngest and smallest eaglet a better chance to get a fair portion of the food and reduces the squabbles that can develop among the siblings during a feeding frenzy. When Mom and Dad are away from the nest the youngsters entertain themselves by watching the world around them. Whether it is a bird passing over high above them or an equally curious photographer far below the nest, the eaglets are always watching and learning.\n\nAs for Orv and Willa, they are faithfully fulfilling their other duties as well, and there are many duties to fulfil. Orv seems to take great pride in protecting his domain from any threat that may appear. He perches for hours in the trees between the Hillside Condo and the Great Miami River. The most likely threat would be from an unknown bald eagle wanting to take over the domain. That threat would come from the sky above the river because eagles are apt to follow the rivers as they venture from place to place. The resident red-tailed hawks can be frequently seen swooping and screaming at the eagles in an attempt to chase them from the area. Even smaller birds, like the red-winged blackbirds that hang out on the river banks, can be a swooping annoyance. Should a threat approach the nest Orv will launch and chase it away and then patrol the skies near the nest before settling down again.\n\nI am grateful for my father and cherish my memories of him. Boys often need a strong hand to guide them and a father’s high (but reasonable) expectations to spur them on to look beyond themselves and their own desires. It may be possible that a catalyst for our eroding culture may be dads who are uninvolved in the lives of their children or dads who allow their desire to be their child’s friend to overpower the child’s need to have him be their guide and guardian. That is not an issue with Orv. His God-ordained, instinctive drives mold his character with integrity and commitment."
