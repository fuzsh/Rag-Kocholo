        "text": "2024 Featured Marques\n\nThis year we celebrate the 125th anniversary of Packard, the automobile that featured elegant and rakish lines that define wealth with swift, purring speed. These are the hallmarks that define Packard along with their sales campaign, “Ask the man who owns one.” The Concours will also pay tribute to the “Pony Car”, which includes Mustang, Camaro, Challenger and others built from 1964 to 1972 at the 17th Dayton Concours d'Elegance at Carillon Park on Sunday, Sept. 15, 2024. The Dayton Concours d'Elegance at Carillon Park presented by AAA is the Midwest’s premier classic & antique automobile and motorcycle show. The Concours will also have a variety of classes for cars from the Brass Era through Future Classics. Motorcycles and race cars will also be displayed. The invitational event brings some of the finest historical cars and motorcycles together inside the grounds of the 65-acre historical park.\n\nThe vehicles are either restored to original or preserved in original condition. Cars from the early 1900s are displayed along side the classics of the '50s and '60s, as well as a variety of two wheeled machines. Entries are judged and compete in a number of classes and also for special awards.\n\nEvent Highlights\n\nThe traditional Saturday morning Cars & Coffee gathering is being replaced this year with a Casual Country Road Tour, presented by Hanson Audio, through the area and ending at America’s Packard Museum for lunch. Open to pre-1998 cars and motorcycles, you can find entry information here. Saturday evening brings the Preview Party at the Carillon Park serving adult beverages and food with entertainment and a Silent Auction. Ten automotive fine artists will be displaying their work in the Art Pavilion on Saturday evening and all day Sunday. Preview Party tickets can be ordered here."
