        "text": "Dayton History is proud to welcome the original “Party in the Park” back to its first home – Carillon Historical Park. Guests can enjoy a sampling of the more than 400 different wines that will be poured that day. Local restaurants will be serving their signature gourmet dishes to compliment the drinks of the day.\n\nWith a Belgian Beer Garden and live music throughout the afternoon, there is something for everyone to enjoy. Toward the end of the day, great wines, baskets, and one-of-a-kind experiences will be up for bidding in the silent auction. We hope everyone will join us for this special event to celebrate wine and support Dayton History."
