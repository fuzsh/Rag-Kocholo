With Baz Luhrmann's remake of seminal novel The Great Gatsby out tomorrow (trailer!), everyone's gone mad for the 1920s all over again. Lavish theme parties, mood music, flapper-esque costumes from Prada and bejeweled diadems a la Tiffany's... and the list goes on. But what about its geography? Sure, this is fiction, and F. Scott Fitzgerald was apparently not overly concerned with accuracy while working on the novel across the pond in France and Italy. But to look at the city through Gatsby-colored glasses is to see it at a romantic, decidedly different time, and that's why we made this map: nostalgia.

The novel is set in the New York of 1922, and Midwestern transplant Nick Carraway, his enigmatic neighbor Jay Gatsby, and societal creme de la creme Daisy and Tom Buchanan and golf star Jordan Baker divide their time between the North Shore of Long Island and the city, where they eat, drink, drive, flirt, and generally live the good life?embracing very kind of vapid values and utter carelessness that Fitzgerald ultimately skewers by the end. But man, did they have a good time doing it. "I began to like New York," Carraway, our narrator, says, "the racy adventurous feel of it at night and the satisfaction that the constant flicker of men and women and machines gives to the restless eye." (So maybe not that much has changed.)

Much of the plotline takes place in West and East Egg?modern-day Great Neck and Port Washington, respectively?which is excluded from our blog's purview. But characters frequent Manhattan and even the no-man's-land middle ground of Flushing, Queens, to further their debauchery, carry on affairs both illicit and endearing, and battle out their most intense arguments.

"As a social historian, Fitzgerald utilized real places and real details for the denotations and connotations these references generated in informed readers," writes the late F. Scott expert Matthew J. Bruccoli. "As an impressionist, Fitzgerald sought to convey, by means of language and style, the emotions associated with actual and fictional settings." So the inclusion of places like the Plaza Hotel and the Yale Club, and areas from Central Park to Washington Heights, were completely intentional. Here now, 19 real-world NYC counterparts to locations in The Great Gatsby, complete with excerpts that shed some light on a bygone era, one that was defined by so much more than parties.

What's now this park was formerly home to "the valley of ashes," where Tom Buchanan's mistress, the ill-fated Myrtle, and her husband Wilson lived near his car-repair shop. It was, at the time, where the Long Island Railroad tracks came up alongside the highway between West Egg and the city, now Northern Boulevard. It was a dump, according to late Fitzgerald expert Matthew J. Bruccoli, who described it in the book's endnotes as a "swamp that was being filled with ashes, garbage, and manure." Flushing was apparently also the home of Fitzgerald acquaintance and used-car salesman Max Gerlach, who probably introduced F. Scott to the expression "old sport" (Gatsby's catchphrase) and who, unfortunately, shot himself in 1939. The parallels to Wilson in profession, area of residence, and personal details are likely not an accident.

The bridge was the last hurdle for the Long Islanders before they reached their beloved Manhattan, driving their fancy cars at top speed toward the parties and festivities ahead. Crossing it was a significant, empowering moment, as narrator Nick Carraway observes: "Over the great bridge, with the sunlight through the girders making a constant flicker upon the moving cars, with the city rising up across the river in white heaps and sugar lumps all built with a wish out of non-olfactory money. The city seen from Queensboro Bridge is always the city seen for the first time, in its first wild promise of all the mystery and beauty in the world.... 'Anything can happen now that we've slid across this bridge,' I thought. 'Anything at all.'"

Nick's commute continues, giving us a sense of the vitality of 1920s street life. Nick, like all New Yorkers, harbored fantasies about total strangers, as he was at once surrounded by people and at the same time not able to shake a sense of isolation: "I liked to walk up Fifth Avenue and pick out romantic women from the crowd and imagine that in a few minutes I was going to enter their lives, and no one would ever know or disapprove. Sometimes, in my mind, I followed them back to their apartments on corners of hidden streets, and they turned and smiled back at me before they faded through a door into warm darkness. At the enchanted metropolitan twilight I felt a haunting loneliness sometimes..." That sense of disconnectedness and soullessness amid the busy city continues as Nick walks towards Penn: "Again at eight o'clock, when the dark lanes of the Forties were five deep with throbbing taxi cabs, bound for the theater district, I felt a sinking in my heart. Forms leaned together in the taxis as they waited, and voices sang, and there was laughter from unheard jokes, and lighted cigarettes outlined unintelligible gestures inside." Nick, in this moment, feels excluded from the city's private, exclusive, hard-to-crack social scene.

A hotel on 43rd Street and Broadway (apparently the first to be entirely kitted out with running water in every room) that was home to a notorious murder. Gatsby and Meyer Wolfsheim wax nostalgic about their old hangout ("filled with faces dead and gone... filled with friends gone now forever"), even though it was built in 1912, only 10 years before the novel is set. (The occurrence of World War I in the interim undoubtedly changed the vibe for regulars.) It is nearby, in an unnamed "well-fanned Forty-second Street cellar," where Gatsby and Nick have lunch and run into Wolfsheim. Wolfsheim and Gatsby also met for the first time on 43rd Street, at the fictional Winebrenner's poolroom, when Gatsby was poor and just out of the army.

The iconic hotel is where Nick Carraway has tea with Jordan Baker, and, later, where the whole gang gathers on a hot summer day in the parlor of a suite for some raucous arguments between Gatsby and Tom Buchanan over Daisy that precede a sad accident on the way home to Long Island. It turned out that their attempt to beat the heat merely resulted in more heat: "The notion originated with Daisy's suggestion that we hire five bathrooms and take cold baths, and then assumed more tangible form as 'a place to have a mint julep.'... The room was large and stifling, and, though it was already four o'clock, opening the windows only admitted a gust of hot shrubbery from the Park."
