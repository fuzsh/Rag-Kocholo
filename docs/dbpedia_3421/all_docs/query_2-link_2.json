        "text": "From the Golden Globes to the Grammy’s to the Oscars, Awards Season is officially underway. While New York City is often referred to as “Hollywood east,” industry insiders and the real film buffs know that Long Island’s unparalleled array of natural settings have served as the backdrop for hundreds of famous films, iconic movie scenes, television series and music videos, from Martin Scorsese’s cinematic classics to Taylor Swift’s “Blank Space” to your favorite Adam Sandler laugh fests.\n\nIf you haven’t visited our mansions, historic villages, or romantic beaches and lighthouses in person, you’ve definitely seen them on the big screen. Long Island’s connection to film history dates to the silent cinema when opulent parties and renowned mansions attracted international stars such as Charlie Chaplin. Fast forward to today, Long Island is home to state-of-the-art movie studios including Grumman Studios as well as Bethpage’s Gold Coast Studios where “The Gilded Age” just wrapped their second season. These studios have housed dozens of A-List stars and blockbuster hits including Avengers, Salt, John Wick, Oceans 8, The Amazing Spider-Man 2, and The Bourne Legacy to name a few.\n\nSo, if you’re celeb-obsessed or a self-proclaimed film buff, a tour of these popular Long Island film sites should be high on your bucket list.\n\n1. Lloyd Harbor and Caumsett State Park\n\nCaumsett State Historic Park is the former estate of Marshall Field III and is situated on a scenic peninsula in Lloyd Harbor, extending into the Long Island Sound. It remains essentially undeveloped, offering miles of bridle paths, hiking, biking, cross-country skiing and nature trails over acres of woodland, meadows, rock shoreline and salt marsh and also served a film location for Angelina Jolie’s film, “Salt.” Most recently, Julia Roberts’ new Netflix film, “Leave the World Behind” filmed in the Lloyd Neck section of Lloyd Harbor (as well as in Riverhead).\n\n2. Oheka Castle\n\nA breathtakingly beautiful historic mansion located on the famed Gold Coast of Long Island between New York City and The Hamptons, Oheka Castle’s stunning European style and dramatic surroundings continue to make the castle a popular backdrop for professional film, television, video, and still photography productions.
