        "text": "is set in the last year—1976—when I lived in Enniscorthy, the small town in the southeast of Ireland where I was born. But, in fact, I have never really abandoned its dreamy streets, even during years spent in Spain or later in the United States, where I am now.\n\nIt is not simply that I remember Enniscorthy. Nor is it simply that I can name each street and recall names of shops and shop owners. Nor it is even that I know where each family plot is situated in the town graveyard.\n\nIt is something more solid and fundamental than that.\n\nI see the town almost as a living thing, as though it can breathe and wake and sleep. And it is as if the people in Enniscorthy mix and mingle under a dome or in a bubble. If one person falls in love or goes to the pub, or if there is a big wedding, then it is never just an individual act. It is oddly communal and shared even, strangely, by those who might have left the town and gone to live elsewhere.\n\nThe intimacy offered by a small town can appear as suffocating nosiness and claustrophobia. But it can also offer a sense of intense belonging.\n\nMy four grandparents were born in Enniscorthy. And it was in the streets of the town that my parents first got to know each other. My mother remembered standing at the door of her family house in Court Street in Enniscorthy—it must have been 1936—and seeing a young man on a bicycle and discovering that he was home from university where he was studying Latin. She found the idea glamorous and alluring!\n\nIf you move just one door away from where my mother stood, you will see the house where my fictional character Nancy Byrne was born. And then a few doors further to the right, you will reach the house of the Lacey family. This is where Eilis Lacey was born.\n\nThe intimacy offered by a small town can appear as suffocating nosiness and claustrophobia. But it can also offer a sense of intense belonging.\n\nIn Mrs. Lacey, Eilis’s mother, will be 80 years old soon. Her life is about to be transformed because her daughter Eilis will return from America and soon be followed by her two teenage children, who have never been in Ireland before.\n\nEilis left the town 25 years earlier. In Brooklyn, where she worked in a department store, she felt like a ghost in the streets. In Enniscorthy, everyone had known her; they knew whose daughter she was, whose sister. In her town, she would be greeted familiarly and warmly. Now, in America, it was as if she had become nobody much.\n\nLike most immigrants, Eilis developed a resilience. Her real life was lived not in the streets of Brooklyn or at work, but in her room in a boarding-house where she could be private. It was easier somehow, in the new country, to be alone.\n\nThe world outside seemed closer to fiction; it had to be imagined. Only the town she had left behind in Ireland was real, and that town was now on the other side of the Atlantic.\n\nWhen Eilis fell in love, it seemed like something from a story that had to be interpreted. In Ireland, she would have known who Tony was. One of her brothers might have been to school with him. She would have seen him in the town. Now, he was a young man from Brooklyn at a dance. She had no way of verifying the stories he told. He had no context. He was charming and good-looking. When he took her home, his Italian-American family seemed like nice people. She took a chance with him.\n\nAnd soon after they married, they moved to Long Island, as so many others did, and they raised a family.\n\nFor Eilis, the real world became three or four rooms in that small house on Long Island. She put much of her energy and her considerable intelligence into raising her two children. Tony, her husband, remained charming, good-humored, considerate. It was, in its own way, perfect.\n\nBut when the perfection broke, it did not merely result in unhappiness. What had held Eilis’s contentment in place was, we learn, brittle and fragile, wafer-thin. Long Island was mere surface for her; what was substantial, even after a quarter of a century, was the town in the southeast of Ireland. It was the town to which she longed to return.\n\nWhich life is her dream life? Which place is real? Where is home for her?\n\nShe plans to go back to Enniscorthy on her own. The children will come a few weeks later. Tony will be left behind.\n\nAt first, in her mother’s house, sleeping in her old bedroom, Eilis could not have predicted how isolated and lonely she would feel once home, how little control she would have over her days. The town seems strange. She almost wishes she were back on Long Island. This visit to Ireland will, it seems, be just an interlude.\n\nAnd then something happens that will change her. It begins almost casually, like a chance encounter. But there is nothing casual about it; it feels like her destiny and it is overwhelming.\n\nWhich life is her dream life? Which place is real? Where is home for her?\n\nAnd slowly, it is as though the town itself, after a long slumber, wakes up. Its topography comes alive again. The walk from Rafter Street to Court Street, or from Court Street to the public phone booth at the bottom of Parnell Avenue, might seems short. But for Eilis now, these small journeys in Enniscorthy take on a strange intensity.\n\nIt was essential for me writing the novel that these names are real. If Eilis turns a corner in Enniscorthy, that corner exists. Even the shop names are exact. I didn’t need to consult a map. I know the names.\n\nThe town is not, for me, a dream place or a place of memory. Even as I invented the characters and the story, the town and then the people did not feel like fiction. I tried to write as though it were real.\n\nThus, if you go to Enniscorthy at night and linger in the Market Square, you might even see Eilis. Or that figure flitting across the Square as the cathedral bells rings out at two in the morning might be her friend Nancy Sheridan. What is Nancy doing walking around the town so late at night? Where has Nancy just been?\n\nAs we consider these questions, we have become townspeople as much as readers. We watch from windows as much as we turn the page. We go to Court Street to see if Eilis’s rented car is still parked outside her mother’s house. As she appears in the street, we realize, before she does, that Eilis wavers between two worlds—Long Island and Enniscorthy. And if one is real, then the other is real, too, but in different ways at different times, just as the concept of home, a place you are sure about, can dissolve and then take new form.\n\nThis is the story of one woman, one life, but it is also what happens to anyone who leaves home, or changes countries, or crosses borders. At first, the new place has to be imagined and the old place remembered. But what is the difference between imagining and remembering? All we know, as we read novels, is that nothing is simple, that there is no single way of feeling at ease or at home, no single way of remembering or experiencing the world.\n\n© Colm Tóibín"
