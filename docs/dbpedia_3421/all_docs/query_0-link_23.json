He is brutalised, held for ransom and then returned to his family. Miraculously, Carl, his wife and his three kids are left to move on with their lives, and resume their prized places in the ongoing saga of the American dream.\n\nBut nearly forty years later, when Carl's mother dies, the trauma that has been bubbling beneath the Fletchers' lives all this time surfaces at last. It becomes apparent that Carl has been quietly pursuing closure to the kidnapping for all these years, and his wife and children must face that the money that they believed bought them safety was actually never capable of doing any such thing.\n\nLong Island Compromise spans generations, winding through decades of history all the way through to the wild present, dealing along the way with all the mainstays of American Jewish life and the timeless questions about wealth, trauma, and the American soul.\n\nMORE PRAISE FOR LONG ISLAND COMPROMISE:\n\n'The status book you'll want to be seen with' STYLIST\n\n'This author's talents are boundless' LA TIMES\n\n'Substantive and profound' CATHY RENTZENBRINK\n\n'Greatness so often comes at the expense of what is enjoyable.
