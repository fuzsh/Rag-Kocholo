He just came out with Frats about gangs with Greek names when he was growing up in Long Island.”\n\nGangs With Greek Names is the title of my novel about the same basic subject matter. Ace was joking, and I’m not accusing Snider of stealing my book, so cool your jets if you thought that’s where this was going."
