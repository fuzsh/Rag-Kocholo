        "text": "In a competitive situation, Apple has acquired the rights to Taffy Brodesser-Akner’s upcoming novel Long Island Compromise to develop as a series.\n\nJust like she did with the FX adaptation of her debut novel, Fleishman Is In Trouble, Brodesser-Akner will write Long Island Compromise, which she will executive produce with Richard Plepler through his Apple-based Eden Productions as well Fleishman Is In Trouble executive producers Sarah Timberman and Carl Beverly of Timberman/Beverly Productions and Susannah Grant.\n\nAhead of its July 9, 2024 publication by Random House, Long Island Compromise created a stir when it hit the TV marketplace earlier this year. Multiple studios pursued the book, with bids involving as much as $1M upfront, before the actual deal is negotiated.\n\nIn the end, the property, with Brodesser-Akner and her Fleishman Is In Trouble collaborators Timberman, Beverly and Grant, landed at Apple. For Timberman/Beverly, the project falls outside of the company’s deal at Lionsgate Television.\n\nLong Island Compromise is set nearly forty years after a wealthy businessman was kidnapped and brutalized before his family paid ransom for his release. It examines the lasting impact of the ordeal on the man, his wife and their three grown children and spans the family’s history, winding through decades and generations and confronting the mainstays of American Jewish life: tradition, the pursuit of success, the terror of history, fear of the future, old wives’ tales, evil eyes, ambition, achievement, boredom, dybbuks, inheritance, pyramid schemes, right-wing capitalists, beta-blockers, psychics, and the mostly unspoken love and shared experience that unite a family forever.\n\nBrodesser-Akner, a staff writer at the New York Times Magazine, created and executive produced FX’s 2022 limited series Fleishman Is In Trouble, based on her 2019 debut novel. It earned seven Emmy nominations, including Outstanding Writing for a Limited or Anthology Series or Movie for Brodesser-Akner and Outstanding Limited or Anthology Series, which she shared. Brodesser-Akner is repped by CAA and attorney David Schachter."
