        "text": "From Jill's 3 favorite reads in 2023.\n\nBy Jill Stoddard Author\n\nWhy did Jill love this book?\n\nThis is a book that kept me thinking about it for weeks after I finished it!\n\nIt's not my typical book; I had to suspend some disbelief and be willing to think metaphorically rather than literally, and if it hadn’t been recommended to me, I probably would have judged the book by its cover and not read it. I’m SO glad I did!\n\nThe middle-aged woman-power that jumps off the pages of this book made me (even more) proud to be a middle-aged woman. The characters were so relatable, and I couldn’t not cheer for these women every step of the way. It also gave me some ideas for how to handle my awful neighbors, but I held back (tee hee.)\n\nI highly recommend this unique, powerful, and much-needed read for women over 40 who want to see themselves better represented in fiction.\n\nBy Kirsten Miller,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n3 authors picked The Change as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\n'A perfect contradiction, existing in the shades of grey that real life is so often painted in . . . A story that's as furious as it is tender' Emily Henry\n\n'A roar of rage, a pacy page-turner, I loved it with all my broken heart. Read it. You'll love it' Marian Keyes\n\n'A propulsive plot and characters that roar off the page, this is a novel that's unafraid to take on societal misogyny while being satirical and even funny at the same time' Guardian\n\n'An addictive, fast-paced crime novel like nothing you've ever read before' Red magazine\n\n* *…\n\nPreview\n\nFrom my list on Book starring tortured artists.\n\nBy Theodore Carter Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nI’m the descendant of three generations of visual artists, a gene I thought had skipped me. However, art popped up in many of my stories when I started writing fiction. In 2012, I published The Life Story of a Chilean Sea Blob, and to promote it, I launched a street art campaign that included putting plaster blobs on the streets of Washington, D.C. This blossomed into several other street art projects and earned attention from The Washington Postand several D.C. TV news stations. My next two books centered around Frida Kahlo and Edvard Munch.\n\nTheodore's book list on Book starring tortured artists\n\nWhy did Theodore love this book?\n\nIn trademark Vonnegut fashion, Bluebeard uses humor to juxtapose the horror and violence of World War II. In this way, it is similar to Slaughterhouse-Five.\n\nHowever, Vonnegut skewers the art movement born out of the war’s aftermath: abstract expressionism. Bluebeard is the story of Rabo Karabekian (who first appeared in Breakfast of Champions), a war veteran and failed illustrator who accidentally found success as a contemporary of Rothko and Pollock. At the end of his life, he’s ready to unveil one final secret locked away in a damp potato barn.\n\nBy Kurt Vonnegut,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked Bluebeard as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\n“Ranks with Vonnegut’s best and goes one step beyond . . . joyous, soaring fiction.”—The Atlanta Journal and Constitution\n\nBroad humor and bitter irony collide in this fictional autobiography of Rabo Karabekian, who, at age seventy-one, wants to be left alone on his Long Island estate with the secret he has locked inside his potato barn. But then a voluptuous young widow badgers Rabo into telling his life story—and Vonnegut in turn tells us the plain, heart-hammering truth about man’s careless fancy to create or destroy what he loves.\n\nPraise for Bluebeard\n\n“Vonnegut is at his edifying best.”—The Philadelphia Inquirer…\n\nPreview\n\nFrom my list on mysteries to cozy up with on a cold night.\n\nBy Syrl Kazlo Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nI am the author of the cozy mystery series Samantha Davies Mysteries. Before beginning to write my series, I read hundreds of cozies and loved each one, especially those featuring a small-town setting, an amateur sleuth, and a dog. Since I live in a small upstate New York town, am married to a retired state trooper, and am the mom to a lovable dachshund, what better than to feature all this in a cozy mystery series. So, the Samantha Davies Mystery series was born.\n\nSyrl's book list on mysteries to cozy up with on a cold night\n\nWhy did Syrl love this book?\n\nI loved that just when I thought I knew who killed William Bassette, I was proven wrong. The twists and turns are many.\n\nI love the setting of rural Vermont, since I am familiar with that area, living close to it. I love the surprising reason for the murder.\n\nBy Amy Patricia Meade,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked Game Over at Guild Hall as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\n“It’s game on when the longtime organizer of the annual Game Supper is murdered right in front of the diners. Readers who enjoy mysteries set in colorful rural settings will love Game Over at Guild Hall.” —Sue Ann Jaffarian, author of the Odelia Grey and Ghost of Granny Apples mysteries\n\nIn rural Vermont, where hunting and trapping are a way of life, nothing is bigger than the annual wild game supper at Guild Hall. Stella can’t wait to sample the exotic dishes prepared by her neighbors, but when the longtime organizer of the supper falls dead, a victim of poisoning,…\n\nPreview\n\nFrom my list on the tragedy of F. Scott Fitzgerald.\n\nBy Libby Sternberg Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nI’ve loved F. Scott Fitzgerald’s stories ever since I read The Great Gatsby as a teenager. After that, I devoured all of his works, thanks to a membership in one of those book subscription services where you have to send back monthly book selections if you don’t want them. I read almost all his short stories, all his novels, including the unfinished The Last Tycoon, and everything I could find on him and his wife Zelda. When The Great Gatsby entered the public domain a couple years ago, I started daydreaming of how I'd love to revisit the story from a fresh perspective, which led me to penning Daisy.\n\nLibby's book list on the tragedy of F. Scott Fitzgerald\n\nWhy did Libby love this book?\n\nWhen I first read this book, I could hear Roberta Flack’s famous song “Killing Me Softly” playing in my head.\n\nI felt as if the author had peered into my own heart and articulated everything I felt about F. Scott Fitzgerald’s greatest work, The Great Gatsby. Corrigan covers an enormous amount of territory—everything from her personal reflections on the novel to how it didn’t sell well at first to how it gained in popularity as GIs read it during WWII as part of a free books program designed just for them up to the four film iterations of the tale.\n\nAlong the way, though, she explores why Gatsby still moves so many readers and why it’s considered The Great American Novel.\n\nBy Maureen Corrigan,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked So We Read on as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nThe \"Fresh Air\" book critic investigates the enduring power of The Great Gatsby -- \"The Great American Novel we all think we've read, but really haven't.\"\n\nConceived nearly a century ago by a man who died believing himself a failure, it's now a revered classic and a rite of passage in the reading lives of millions. But how well do we really know The Great Gatsby? As Maureen Corrigan, Gatsby lover extraordinaire, points out, while Fitzgerald's masterpiece may be one of the most popular novels in America, many of us first read it when we were too young to fully…\n\nPreview\n\nWhy did Larry love this book?\n\nFirst published in 1980, Gaywyck was the first historical gay gothic romance. Virga, whose day job for forty years was as photo editor, turns his extraordinary eye on turn-of-the-last century New York.\n\nThe tangled lives, dark secrets, and mad love – all conventions of the romance genre – are stood on their heads in this reimagining. “I realized genre has no gender,” Virga says, and set about cannily reversing roles and inverting tropes to fashion a puzzle wrapped in an enigma of requited and unrequited love.\n\nGaywyck stands the test of time and remains a modern classic.\n\nBy Vincent Virga,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked Gaywyck as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nGaywyck is the first gay Gothic novel. Long out of print, this classic proved that genre knows no gender. Young, innocent Robert Whyte enters a Jane-Eyre world of secrets and deceptions when he is hired to catalog the vast library at Gaywyck, a mysterious ancestral mansion on Long Island, where he falls in love with its handsome and melancholy owner, Donough Gaylord. Robert's unconditional love is challenged by hidden evil lurking in the shadowy past crammed with dark sexual secrets sowing murder, blackmail, and mayhem in the great romantic tradition. As Armisted Maupin urged, “Read the son of a bitch!…\n\nPreview\n\nWhy did Art love this book?\n\nI liked this book so much that I read it three times. Of all of DeMille’s novels, which take place throughout the Northeast of America, I particularly liked this one because it combines mystery, romance, and the Mafia.

Here two men are destined for an explosive collision: John Sutter, Wall Street lawyer, holding fast to a fading aristocratic legacy; and Frank Bellarosa, the Mafia don who seizes his piece of the staid and unprepared…\n\nPreview\n\nWhy did Geoff love this book?\n\nThe Gate House is a sequel to DeMille’s successful novel The Gold Coast, which I really enjoyed. Who wouldn’t like a tale of seduction, betrayal, and violence set about a Mafia don moving into a wealthy WASP enclave on Long Island’s North Shore.\n\nI found The Gate House to be even better. The narrating hero of The Gold Coast returns ten years later. He’s older, wiser, but no less sly, cynical, and funny. His ex-wife is also back, and despite his thinking that she is more than a little crazy (and maybe a bit homicidal), he’s still attracted to her. To top things off, the Mafia don’s son, now himself the don, is looking for vengeance.The Gate House is full of sex, humor, and ultimately, violence.\n\nBy Nelson DeMille,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked The Gate House as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nWhen John Sutter's aristocratic wife killed her mafia don lover, John left America and set out in his sailboat on a three-year journey around the world, eventually settling in London.

That combination of horror and techno-thriller greatly impacted my writing style and genre. I love a page-turner and chapters that end with a cliffhanger. I love that creepy feeling of dread that washes over you when engrossed in a scary scene. I love when you put a book down for the night, turn off the light, and then wince when you hear a strange noise in the other room. I love a story that's so believable that you can't help but wonder, \"Could this happen...maybe even to me?\" If you do, too, you may enjoy my books.\n\nMJ's book list on scaring and thrilling you without bathing you in blood\n\nWhy did MJ love this book?\n\nGrowing up in Rhode Island, I can't tell you how many times I told someone where I was from, and they would respond with, \"Oh, Long Island, New York.\" Ugh.\n\nNaturally, a haunted house story set in Long Island caught my eye. I can honestly say this book gave me nightmares. Oddly enough, I'm not easily sucked into supernatural thrillers because they often require too big of a leap of faith. The Amityville Horror was different.\n\nMy sisters and I all read the book and regularly tried to scare the crap out of each other with scenes from the story. We had a planter shaped like a pig and would carry it into a room, screaming, \"Jodie is here!\" The book is terrifying and well done.\n\nBy Jay Anson,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n2 authors picked The Amityville Horror as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\n“A fascinating and frightening book” (Los Angeles Times)—the bestselling true story about a house possessed by evil spirits, haunted by psychic phenomena almost too terrible to describe.\n\nIn December 1975, the Lutz family moved into their new home on suburban Long Island. George and Kathleen Lutz knew that, one year earlier, Ronald DeFeo had murdered his parents, brothers, and sisters in the house, but the property—complete with boathouse and swimming pool—and the price had been too good to pass up.\n\nTwenty-eight days later, the entire Lutz family fled in terror.\n\nThis is the spellbinding, shocking true story that gripped the…\n\nPreview\n\nWhy did Susan love this book?\n\nThough I have read and relished all of Alice McDermott’s novels,Child of my Heart is my favorite. Theresa, age 15, is East Hampton’s most sought-after babysitter when her favorite cousin, eight-year-old Daisy, comes to spend the summer in this gorgeous coming-of-age novel. Though Theresa and Daisy share a magical world, Theresa eventually realizes the ongoing bruises on Daisy’s feet and body mean she is seriously ill. While the cousins intuitively conceal Daisy’s condition, Theresa becomes aroused by and wary of her sexual attraction to the father of Flora, a toddler she babysits. Through the haunting presence of death and her dawning sexuality for a much-older man, Theresa crosses into adulthood.\n\nBy Alice McDermott,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked Child of My Heart as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nOn the cusp of fifteen, pretty Theresa is the town's most sought-after babysitter - cheerful, beloved, adored by children and animals, but also a solitary soul with an already complex understanding of human nature. She is Titania among her fairies, the one person to call on for help with a child in extreme distress. Theresa does not doubt her power over the fathers of her adoring charges either, like the elderly artist whose signature and doodles may fetch a fortune, but whose potential lechery Theresa toys with like a kitten with yarn. Yet, during this unforgettable summer, it is her…\n\nPreview\n\nFrom my list on books that utilize COVID in the plot.\n\nBy Jeanne McWilliams Blasberg Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nI am an author who also penned a novel during the pandemic, with a timeline that stretched into the first six months of the pandemic–against the advice of my agent and the publishing industry at large. I know many authors choose not to write about intense political and social happenings, but that “life will never be the same again” feeling was something I couldn’t avoid. The pandemic threw people together and kept us apart at the same time. I was intensely interested in its incubator effect as well as the silo aspect quarantining had on all of our lives.\n\nJeanne's book list on books that utilize COVID in the plot\n\nWhy did Jeanne love this book?\n\nThe opening of this book knocked me out, and I was hooked.\n\nI usually veer toward literary, slower, familial dramas, but this book combined what I love in literary family dynamics with the frightening premise of an inexplicable disaster occurring in the outside world. The suspicion we were quick to possess about others during the early days of the pandemic is heightened to a new level with two couples pitted against each other, one preoccupied with the welfare and antics of their children.\n\nI loved the construct that had even spouses second-guessing each other. The intensity of the situation brought out the worst and eventually the better sides of all the characters, a phenomenon that resonated as I read this book during the first year of the pandemic, at the same time rioters invaded our nation’s capital.\n\nBy Rumaan Alam,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n3 authors picked Leave the World Behind as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\n*A THE TIMES #1 BESTSELLER*\n\n*THE NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER*\n\n*A BARACK OBAMA SUMMER READING PICK 2021*\n\n'Easily the best thing I have read all year' KILEY REID, AUTHOR OF SUCH A FUN AGE\n\n'Intense, incisive, I loved this and have still not quite shaken off the unease' DAVID NICHOLLS\n\n'I was hooked from the opening pages' CLARE MACKINTOSH\n\n'Simply breathtaking . . .
