        "text": "Nelson DeMille is the bestselling author of adventure and thriller novels, and with over thirty titles under his belt and a handful of pen names to boot, it can be hard to know where to start with his work! If you’re looking to get started reading DeMille’s books, why not start with the John Corey books? John Corey is one of DeMille’s most iconic characters, a retired homicide detective turned anti-terrorist special agent, and he first appeared in 1997 with the publication of Plum Island! Since then, six more books about John Corey and his cases involving terrorism, international politics, and mastermind criminals have followed. If you want to read the John Corey books in order from start to finish, this list will guide you!\n\nPlum Island introduces readers to John Corey, a retired NYPD officer who has stepped back from his job as a homicide detective after receiving three bullet wounds...but he's far from ready to back down from the action! While recovering from his injuries, Corey heads to a small town on Long Island to rest up and figure out what his next career move ought to be. There, a young couple he is acquainted with is found dead on their porch, murdered. Stumped, the local police chief asks John to consult on the case, as he has more experience with murder investigations. John agrees, and the course of the investigation changes his life forever.\n\nThis item is a preorder.

When a Libyan terrorist known as The Lion boards a flight for JFK with the intention of defecting to the West, Corey and his new partner Kate plan to meet him at the gate. Except, something terrible happens aboard the flight, and Corey realizes that The Lion is not coming in quietly. Instead, he has a plan to wreak havoc on the U.S., and Corey must stop the bloodshed on American soil before more people are hurt.\n\nThis item is a preorder.

Five years later, John Corey and his partner-turned-wife Kate are determined to uncover the real reason why the flight crashed. They're a part of an anti-terrorism task force, though, and they need hard proof. Their witnesses may have proof–on tape, even–but they have more than a couple of good reasons to keep it hidden. It'll be up to John and Kate to find the truth before it's too late.\n\nThis item is a preorder.

And they're right to be suspicious, because the more they probe the club and its members, the more is revealed about an alarming plan for the most powerful men in America to take matters into their own hands and deliver vigilante justice for the 9/11 attacks.\n\nThis item is a preorder. Your payment method will be charged immediately, and the product is expected to ship on or around November 6, 2006.

When a face-to-face confrontation in New York City alerts John Corey of the Lion's intent, he engages in a fierce game of wits and firepower to try to stop The Lion before he can reign even more terror on the U.S.\n\nPrice\n\n$10.99\n\nPrice\n\n$13.99 CAD\n\nThis item is a preorder.

But they don't know the rules in Yemen, nor whom to trust. As they launch into the investigation, they slowly discover that they aren't stalking the Panther–the Panther is stalking them.\n\nThis item is a preorder.

But maybe not...when he realizes that Russia poses a much larger threat than the government seems to realize. When a member of the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service disappears while vacationing in the Hamptons, Corey investigates and stumbles into a much larger conspiracy...\n\nThis item is a preorder.
