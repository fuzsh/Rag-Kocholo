        "text": "The Vanderbilt’s Charles and Helen Reichert Planetarium opened its doors to the public in 1971. The Planetarium enhanced Museum offerings and now offers cutting-edge programming in the most technologically advanced theater of its kind on Long Island. We serve local school districts, our community, and out-of-town visitors. The Planetarium has diverse programming that includes fulldome films, live star talks, laser shows, concerts, and special events. The Planetarium is also available as a venue for corporate events and other engagements.\n\nIn 2013, the Planetarium and its William and Mollie Rogers Theater with a 60-foot dome underwent a $4-million dollar renovation – including 147 oversized comfort seats, a powerful 5.1 surround sound system, and one of the finest star projector and fulldome video projection systems in the world. The theater’s hybrid Geministar III system can show an incredibly realistic starry sky that seamlessly cross-fades with the fulldome video system to lift audiences off Earth and have them travel anywhere in the known universe! Audiences can visit planets, moons, stars, exoplanets, black holes, stellar nurseries, galaxies, and even the entire universe itself from the farthest vantage points known. Visitors find it a truly wonderful, awe-inspiring experience.\n\nThe Planetarium has a rooftop Observatory which is open to the public every Friday night, weather permitting. There, guided by an astronomy educator, visitors can examine the night sky through the Vanderbilt’s 16-inch Meade reflecting telescope."
