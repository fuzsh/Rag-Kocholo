        "text": "Summer is just around the corner and those looking for something to read on the beach, by the pool or even indoors are in luck. The most anticipated books of summer 2024 seem to offer something for everyone, from a heart-pounding mystery from Rachel Howzell Hall to a hip-hop history lesson from Questlove.\n\nFrom Memorial Day to Labor Day, you can relax with memoirs from Dr. Anthony Fauci, artist Anna Marie Tendler, and the long-time assistant to the late Joan Didion. Chill out with debuts from exciting up-and-comers like film producer Essie Chambers and Palestinian journalist Yasmin Zaher. Or heat things up with Casey McQuiston, who is back with a romance that they call their “spiciest” book yet, and memoirist Glynnis MacNicol, who shows how a few months in post-pandemic Paris helped her get her groove back.\n\nBelow, the 24 most anticipated books of the summer.\n\nSwift River, Essie Chambers (June 4)\n\nEssie Chambers’ debut novel, Swift River, is a heartbreaking, yet hopeful coming of age story about the high cost of family secrets. In 1987, a lonely, overweight biracial teenager named Diamond Newberry struggles to make sense of her dad’s mysterious disappearance seven years earlier. (The only thing they ever found were his sneakers, placed along the titular New England mill town’s namesake river, with his wallet and house keys tucked inside.) While Diamond’s mom fights to declare her husband legally dead in order to collect his much-needed insurance money, the 16-year-old receives a letter from a long-lost relative that has her convinced that her dad is still alive. And if that’s the case, she wonders, why doesn’t he want to be found?\n\nBuy Now: Swift River on Bookshop | Amazon\n\nFire Exit, Morgan Talty (June 4)\n\nWith his spellbinding follow-up to Night of the Living Rez, Morgan Talty offers a compassionate portrait of a man who is desperate to understand who he is and where he came from. A river on Maine’s Penobscot Reservation is all that separates Charles Lamosway from the daughter he secretly fathered more than 20 years ago and has watched from afar since her birth. When she suddenly goes missing, Charles finds himself revisiting the most consequential events of his life—his tough childhood on the reservation, his too-short relationship with his daughter’s mom, and the tragic death of his stepfather—in the hopes that he will be able to tell her the truth of his identity before it’s too late.\n\nBuy Now: Fire Exit on Bookshop | Amazon\n\nThe Friday Afternoon Club, Griffin Dunne (June 11)\n\nActor and director Griffin Dunne is the son of investigative journalist Dominick Dunne, and the nephew of legendary writers John Gregory Dunne and Joan Didion. In his debut memoir, The Friday Afternoon Club, he attempts to make sense of his well-known family’s strange, and often tragic history and his place in it. He shares Hollywood tales about being saved from drowning by Sean Connery, trying to hook up with Janis Joplin in his teens, and forming a lifelong bond with Carrie Fisher while she filmed Star Wars. But it’s the 1982 death of his sister, Dominique, at the hands of her ex-boyfriend, and the trial that followed that looms large over the book. Written with candor and heart, The Friday Afternoon Club is more than just a juicy celebrity autobiography, it’s a loving portrait of a complicated but resilient family.\n\nBuy Now: The Friday Afternoon Club on Bookshop | Amazon\n\nThe Sons of El Rey, Alex Espinoza (June 11)\n\nA family of luchadores, Mexican wrestlers known for donning vibrant masks and costumes, are the subject of The Sons of El Rey, Alex Espinoza’s gripping novel about masculinity and migration. In present-day East Los Angeles, Mexican born-LA raised former lucha libre wrestler Freddy Vega struggles to save his dying dad Ernesto’s gym. On his deathbed, Ernesto, better known as famed luchador El Rey Coyote, has visions of his late wife and his alter-ego, who force him to confront the choices he made back in 1960s Mexico City. Meanwhile, Freddy’s openly gay American-born son, Julian, struggles to find a place for himself in a sport that has not always been accepting of queer people. With affection and humor, The Sons of El Rey shows how three generations of one luchador dynasty wrestle with their demons, desires, and destinies.\n\nBuy Now: The Sons of El Rey on Bookshop | Amazon\n\nThe Uptown Local, Cory Leadbeater (June 11)\n\nFor nine years, Cory Leadbeater worked as Joan Didion’s personal assistant—but The Devil Wears Prada this is definitely not. In Leadbeater’s debut memoir, The Uptown Local, he makes it abundantly clear that working for Didion, who died in 2021, was a dream job for a then aspiring novelist in his early twenties. He writes longingly of the revered author and the time they spent together in her final years as roommates entertaining “Oscar winners, California governors, and Supreme Court justices”in her Manhattan co-op. But he also admits that this once in a lifetime gig couldn’t have come at a more inopportune time. He writes honestly of the depression, addiction, and trauma stemming from an abusive childhood that made it hard for him to get up everyday. The Uptown Local is a touching tribute to an unlikely friend and mentor who changed his life and writing in ways he could have never imagined.\n\nBuy Now: The Uptown Local on Bookshop | Amazon\n\nWhat Fire Brings, Rachel Howzell Hall (June 11)\n\nBest-selling author Rachel Howzell Hall’s latest thriller, What Fire Brings, is a riveting psychological mystery that will keep you guessing until the very end.

And, as it turns out, neither of those women are the first to mysteriously disappear on his property.\n\nBuy Now: What Fire Brings on Bookshop | Amazon\n\nI'm Mostly Here to Enjoy Myself, Glynnis MacNicol (June 11)\n\nI’m Mostly Here to Enjoy Myself is a provocative travelog that covers one woman’s search for radical pleasure. After spending the height of the COVID-19 pandemic alone in her tiny Manhattan apartment, author Glynnis MacNicol jumped at the opportunity to sublet her friend’s Paris home in August 2021. At 46, childless, and unattached, she wanted to prove to herself—and to a world that is not always kind to women of a certain age—that she still had a lot of living to do. Over the course of one Parisian summer, she finds gratification in good food, good wine, and really good sex. (The book’s cover is a cheeky nod to just how much time she spends in the nude.) By giving herself over to her indulgences, MacNicol learns to live her best life. With her book, she encourages others to do the same.\n\nBuy Now: I'm Mostly Here to Enjoy Myself on Bookshop | Amazon\n\nHip-Hop Is History, Questlove (June 11)\n\nHip-Hop Is History, Ahmir “Questlove” Thompson’s fifth book, traces the lineage of the titular musical genre alongside his own upbringing in Philadelphia. In the spiritual sequel to his 2021 book, Music Is History, the celebrated musician and Oscar-winning director chronicles the first 50 years of hip-hop through insightful and passionate analysis that celebrates the big-named artists who popularized the style, as well as those lesser-known creatives who quietly influenced rap’s rise.

When Jasmyn starts digging into the community’s history, she uncovers a shocking secret about Liberty’s founders that threatens to tear her family apart.\n\nBuy Now: One of Our Kind on Bookshop | Amazon\n\nParade, Rachel Cusk (June 18)\n\nRachel Cusk, the author of The Outline trilogy, has never been afraid to get experimental with her writing. In the case of Parade, she is once again pushing the boundaries of the literary form. The follow-up to her more conventional 2021 novel, Second Place, is a work of abstract fiction that follows G, an artist who takes on nearly a half-dozen different personas. Across four sections, G is a chauvinist painter who creates portraits of his wife upside down, a 19th century female painter who dies in childbirth, a male filmmaker fleeing his repressed parents, a female painter in a dysfunctional marriage, a Black painter excluded by his peers, and a suffering female sculptor. Despite their core differences, each version of G forces readers to ask important philosophical questions regarding art, gender, motherhood, creativity, and objectification.\n\nBuy Now: Parade on Bookshop | Amazon\n\nOn Call, Anthony Fauci (June 18)\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic made Dr. Anthony Fauci a household name, but that was just one chapter in the 83-year-old’s long and storied career as an infectious disease expert. In his first memoir, On Call, Fauci recounts his time as the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the National Institutes of Health (NIH), a role he held for nearly 40 years before stepping down in 2022. During his tenure, Fauci worked under seven presidents, starting with Ronald Reagan and ending with current President Joe Biden, and writes about those relationships in the book.
