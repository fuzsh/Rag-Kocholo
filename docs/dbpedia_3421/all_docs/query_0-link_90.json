        "text": "For over forty-five years, the Long Island High School for the Arts (LIHSA) has transformed the lives of young emerging artists from across Long Island through both its high school and summer programs. The Hofstra University/LIHSA summer partnership provides an unparalleled experience for students in Grades 7-12 to be guided by faculty mentors and staff who understand the unique needs of young artists.\n\nThese classes are held on the LIHSA campus. LIHSA’s facilities are specially designed to support the school’s mission. LIHSA’s 38,000 square feet across three buildings are filled with professional workspaces and facilities. It is situated on 4.5 acres in Syosset Long Island, with plenty of courtyard space to have a picnic lunch and draw artistic inspiration. With four dance studios on campus, a larger theatre that holds 350 audience members with lighting and sound equipment, two smaller black box theatres, an audio-recording studio, numerous classroom spaces, practice rooms, art studios, film editing room, dark room, digital music space and a carpentry shop for scenic design, it is a great place to spend for a young artist to spend their summer!\n\nPrograms are flexible—choose to enroll in a one week offering or combine several to be on campus for all four weeks! Programs take place from 9 a.m.-3 p.m. Tuition price is listed with each course.
