        "text": "Updated November 22nd, 2023\n\nThis post might contain affiliate links. That means I may earn a small commission at no extra cost to you, if you buy through my site. I appreciate your support of my site.\n\nWhen you can’t travel to NYC in person, you can still travel to the Big Apple in spirit through books set in New York City! It’s funny that I never remember any enjoyment from learning history in school, but I can spend hours wandering through history museums or delving into a good historical fiction novel. While living in New York I spent all my time on the subway reading. As I commuted I not only was transported from my apartment to school, but also to the New York of decades ago.\n\nThis post is full of many of the great historical fiction books set in New York City. I have personally read and enjoyed all of them. From reading these books about New York I have learned so much about the city and many of the people who lived there. If you live in NYC you will see the city in a whole new way after learning about the history of different landmarks, streets, and neighborhoods you pass everyday. You will be inspired to visit and learn more about the places mentioned in the books. Recommendations on where to visit in NYC, based on the books, are included.\n\nEven if you don’t live in NYC or have plans to visit soon, it is still fun to read books that take place in the city that never sleeps! For more of the best books about New York City check out chick lit set in New York City and children’s books about New York City for younger readers.\n\nHistorical Fiction Books Set in New York City\n\nThe Best New York City Historical Fiction Novels with Dual Time Periods\n\nI have always loved stories that are told from alternating perspectives. Historical fiction lends itself well to not only different characters’ perspectives, but also different time periods. Within this first group of books set in NYC are all stories that feature at least two different character’s voices within two distinct periods of history. It’s a great way to see how the New York of today compares to the New York of yesterday.\n\nThe Lions of Fifth Avenue\n\nThe New York Public Library is one of the most iconic locations in the city. Who doesn’t want to read a novel centered around this famous 5th avenue institution? I bet you didn’t know that there used to be an apartment in the library! The Lions of Fifth Avenue by Fiona Davis is a historical fiction novel with a bit of mystery thrown in thanks to some book thieves. With some romance, female empowerment, and family dynamics, Davis’s book really has it all. The early 1900s and 1990s time periods in the book are well connected due to the library setting. It’s hard to choose favorites, but I really do think it is one of the best books about New York set in the past.\n\nWhere to Visit: If you weren’t already, you will of course be intrigued about the New York Public Library after reading the Lions of Fifth Avenue. I did the free tour at the library before reading the book and it helped me to visualize the layout of the building when it was referenced many times in the plot.\n\nA Fall of Marigolds\n\nIf you want to read top historical fiction novels look no further than Susan Meissner’s novels. She is known for her fiction stories that focus around different historical events. A Fall of Marigolds connects two tragic events in New York’s history, the Triangle Shirtwaist Fire and 9/11. The story is told from two women’s perspectives who are connected through a 100 year old scarf and their shared grief. It is from stories like this one that I have truly learned about NYC’s history and what a resilient city it is.\n\nWhere to Visit: Clara from the early 1900s deals with her grief by working at Ellis Island. Take a combined tour of the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island. Ellis island was the getaway to America and has a fascinating history. The audio tour tells the stories of many people passing through Ellis Island with the hope of a better life.\n\nTaryn tries to move through her grief from her husband’s death at the World Trade Towers by staying busy on the Upper West Side. Visit the One World Observatory and the 9/11 Memorial & Museum. The museum is quite sobering, but an important place to visit in an attempt to make sense of this tragic day.\n\nAstor Place Vintage\n\nAstor Place Vintage by Stephanie Lehmann spans 100 years in history. Amanda’s storyline takes place in 2007 where she owns a vintage clothing shop and discovers Olive’s journal from 100 years earlier. Amanda escapes her own problems in modern day Manhattan with those of Olive’s in the financial crisis and lack of women’s rights in 1907. It is clear that Lehmann did her research and included a lot of accurate details of NYC during the early 1900s.\n\nWhere to Visit: Astor Place is an actual street in lower Manhattan. Check out the area and you will definitely find some vintage clothing stores nearby in the East Village. It’s hard to say if you will find a hidden journal or not!\n\nThe Subway Girls\n\nThe New York City subway system may not be on the list of the top attractions in the city, but it really has been the quintessential New York way of life since 1904. Susie Orman Schnall’s The Subway Girls focuses on a 1949 Miss Subway contestant and an advertising executive from today. You can’t help but root for each woman as you become immersed in their lives.\n\nWhere to Visit: If the book piques your interest in the history of the subway, take a visit to the NY Transit Museum. They have permanent exhibits on the history of transportation in the city as well as changing special exhibits. I have been there three times and always learn something new. If I am not mistaken they once had an exhibit on the actual subway girls.\n\nHistorical Fiction Books Set in New York City by Decade\n\nWhile the dual time period novels are ideal for connecting the past and present, novels that focus primarily on one time period help you learn more about one era in particular. The following books set in New York City cover the late 1800s to the 1960s, starting with the earliest decades.\n\nThe Social Graces\n\nLavish balls, opulent mansions, and elaborate gowns were staples of the late 1800s during the Gilded Age. The Social Graces takes place during this period and focuses on the well-off Alva Vanderbilt and Caroline Astor. The book is told in alternating perspectives between these two society ladies and from “Society” in general.\n\nRenée Rosen, the best-selling author of several historical fiction novels, does a great job helping the reader relate to these frivolous and materialistic protagonists. From chapter 1 you will be immediately swept up into the rules of society and the extravagance of this era. The Social Graces quickly became one of my favorite books about New York City.\n\nWhere to Visit: As the novel took place over 120 years ago, New York has changed quite a bit since that time. Many of the Vanderbilt and Astor properties have since been torn down. Mrs. Astor’s home on 34th St & 5th Ave is now the site of the Empire State Building. Alva’s mansion at 660 Fifth Avenue is office buildings.\n\nThere are still plenty of original mansions from the Gilded Age though. Most of them are no longer homes and have commercial businesses or museums inside. Take a walk in the Upper East Side along 5th avenue to admire these buildings. 647 Fifth Avenue was originally a Vanderbilt mansion and now is a commercial building.\n\nThe Personal Librarian\n\nThe majority of adults know about the fighting against slavery in the Civil War, the atrocities of WWII, and the resistance to the Vietnam War. What I love about the best historical fiction books set in New York is that it brings so many lesser known stories to light. The Personal Librarian by Marie Benedict and Victoria Christopher Murray is the perfect example of that.\n\nYou probably have heard of JP Morgan, but do you know Belle da Costa Greene, his personal librarian? As an African American with Portuguese heritage she was able to pass as a white woman and build Morgan’s library with the most sought after books, manuscripts, and works of art. The book focuses primarily on the first half of the 20th century and the many decades Belle da Costa Greene ran the library.\n\nWhere to Visit: Many of the opulent mansions of early New York are no longer standing or have been turned into private residences or offices. Thanks to the help of Belle da Costa Greene, The JP Morgan Library & Museum from 1906 is open to the public. Along with admiring the library and building itself, there are other special exhibits in the building.\n\nIt’s definitely one of the many museums in NYC you should visit.\n\nThe Ice Cream Queen of Orchard Street\n\nUnlike most of the NYC novels in this section The Ice Cream Queen of Orchard Street by Susan Jane Gilman spans quite a bit of time. The story begins in 1913 when Russian Malka Treynovsky convinces her family to immigrate to America. Losing her family and the hard life of the Lower East Side of Manhattan isn’t even close to what she imagined before the trip. The story spans 70 years as Malka, who changes her name to Lilian, makes quite a name for herself in the ice cream business. While a good portion of the story takes place in the Lower East Side and includes a lot of historical details from this time, there are also parts from across America. No matter where she is, Lilian is quite the character!\n\nWhere to Visit: I came across The Ice Cream Queen of Orchard Street when browsing the gift shop at the Museum of Chinese in America in Chinatown. It’s a small, but excellent museum on the history, culture, and experiences of Chinese people in America. While there is some connection to the book, I think the Tenement Museum is the most related place to check out, along with the streets of the Lower East Side. The Tenement Museum offers various themed tours of former tenement buildings in the neighborhood. Malka may have very well lived in one of them!\n\nEmpire Girls\n\nThe roaring 20s was an opulent and exciting time in New York City. Discover it for yourself in Empire Girls. Two sisters head to NYC in the 20s to search for their long lost brother and reclaim their family home. The chapters alternate between the two sisters perspectives with the authors Suzanne Hayes and Loretta Nyhan each writing one. It’s a really fun story where a bond develops between the two sisters who previously had very little in common all within the backdrop of the glamorous 20s.\n\nWhere to Visit: Secret New York has some fun ideas on how to go back to the roaring 20s in NYC!\n\nThe Chaperone\n\nThe Chaperone by Laura Moriarty also takes place in the glamorous 20s when Cora Carlisle accompanies Louise Brooks as a chaperone from Kansas to New York City. The plot is based loosely on the true story of Louise Brooks, a dancer and actress known as a sensual flapper girl. While the story is written from both Cora and Louise’s voices, much more is focused on Cora’s life and experiences than Louise’s. Cora was taken on an orphan train from New York to Kansas when she was young and begins researching her early life while in the city.\n\nWhere to Visit: Visit some of the places and buildings that have been in New York since the 20s. Check out The Back Room, which is one of the only hidden bars in NYC today that was also a speakeasy during the 20s.\n\nFifth Avenue Glamour Girl\n\nRenée Rosen worked her writing magic and did it again with another fantastic novel, Fifth Avenue Glamour Girl. This book focuses on the cosmetic businesswoman Estée Lauder and her friend Gloria. The majority of the book takes place in the late 1930s and early 1940s as Estée Lauder begins growing her business.\n\nSimilar to many of her historical fiction books Rosen writes about a real woman, but tells the story from the perspective of someone connected to the woman. The historical timeline of Estée Lauder’s rise to fame works perfectly alongside Gloria’s fictional story of making it in NYC on her own after she becomes estranged from her family. While Gloria is inspired by Estée’s gumption, I admit she gave me an extra boost of motivation as well!\n\nWhere to Visit: Gloria orders catering from Nom Wah Tea Parlor. You can still eat at this popular dim sum restaurant from 1920 in Chinatown! Many intersections in the Upper East Side, Upper West Side, and Midtown are specified. As far as I know the other restaurants in the book were fictional or are no longer in operation, but you can visit these locations and see what is located there today.\n\nSaks Fifth Avenue is of course the obvious place to shop after reading the book. Don’t forget to visit the cosmetics department!\n\nCity of Girls\n\nFrom Elizabeth Gilbert, the author of the wildly popular Eat, Pray, Love comes City of Girls. This long, but intriguing novel takes place in the 1940s New York theater world. Vivian, the main character, is kicked out of college and goes to live with her Aunt Peg. Vivian tells the story as an older woman looking back on her life and exciting times in the city.\n\nThere are quite a bit of sexual exploits and partying within the narrative. Typically I wouldn’t be drawn to a book like this, but the cast of characters is compelling and the lives of those connected to the theater during this time are fascinating. None of the characters were written to portray real people as far as I know, but the look into this bygone era made it one of my favorite historical fiction books about New York City.\n\nWhere to Visit: It makes you want to go to the theater doesn’t it!? My guide on how to find discount Broadway tickets will help you see a show without breaking the bank.\n\nGrand Central: Original Stories of Postwar Love and Reunion\n\nNew York City alludes a sense of romance or at least a hope of romance. Grand Central is full of short love stories written by a handful of different authors that all take place in the world-famous train station. All the stories happen on one day sometime after WWII. The common setting, both in place and time is clearly consistent throughout the story. Other than that there are only some small connections between the different stories that you need to pay attention closely to in order to notice. Each story is unique in the sense that it might make you dab at your eyes or perhaps melt your heart.\n\nWhere to Visit: Grand Central Station of course! As you pass each person it will make you wonder about their story, won’t it? Take a guided tour and discover all of the places mentioned in the stories or eat at the famous Oyster Bar.\n\nBrooklyn\n\nIn Colm Tóibín’s novel Brooklyn, Eilis Lacey travels from Ireland to Brooklyn in the 1950s. Eilis comes to Brooklyn to better her life. In addition to finding work she also finds love.\n\nDoes this novel sound familiar? It was turned into a movie with the same name. Ironically I knew the movie was based on a book but when I watched it I hadn’t remembered reading the book. Throughout the first half of the movie this nagging sensation of familiarity kept tugging at me until I finally realized I had indeed read the book! My forgetfulness has more to do with the number of books I read and nothing to do with it not being a good historical fiction book!\n\nWhere to Visit: Visit Fulton Street in Brooklyn which is still a commercial shopping district and imagine Eilis working in one of the department stores. Head to Coney Island in southern Brooklyn for a famous hot dog, a walk on the beach, a Cyclones baseball game, or a ride on the Cyclone. This wooden roller coaster has been in Coney Island since 1927.\n\nThe Spectacular\n\nFiona Davis writes some of the best historical fiction books set in New York City. All of her novels feature iconic NYC landmarks. The Spectacular is no different as it primarily takes place in 1956 at one of New York’s most famous concert halls, Radio City Music Hall. Since Radio City’s opening in 1932 the Rockettes have been the star feature.\n\nIn the novel Marion auditions to be a Rockette against her father and boyfriend’s approval. While Marion is ecstatic to be chosen, she has to deal with her family’s disapproval and new life in Manhattan. On top of her grueling rehearsal and performance schedule she also takes an active role in catching the Big Apple Bomber who is based on the real “Mad Bomber” from the 50s. The storyline is inspired by many of the real details from that scary, yet widely unknown period in Manhattan.\n\nWhere to Visit: If you are in NYC in December you definitely need to buy a ticket to the Radio City Christmas Spectacular! Rest assured that the Big Apple Bomber is long gone and you can enjoy the most spectacular performance from the Rockettes just as New Yorkers and visitors have been doing for almost 100 years now!\n\nNot visiting during the winter holidays? Don’t fret! All year-round you can visit Radio City on a guided tour that takes you behind the scenes.\n\nThe Swans of Fifth Avenue\n\nMelanie Benjamin’s The Swans of Fifth Avenue is a captivating story full of characters portraying real life people from 1950s & 1960s high society New York. The narrative is focused on Babe Paley and Truman Capote’s friendship and ultimate literary scandal. It is a whole new look at life as a socialite in Manhattan.\n\nWhere to Visit: Feel like a socialite yourself at the one and only Plaza Hotel on 5th avenue. Even if you don’t want to splurge on the nightly rate you can wander around the hotel and eat at the hotel. The Plaza Food Hall is a higher priced food hall, but more affordable than the sit down restaurants in the hotel.\n\nAre you familiar with the Eloise books? They are not historical fiction books, but they are a fun children’s collection of books that feature Eloise, a little girl who lives at the Plaza. Take a peek at the large pink Eloise shop.\n\nPark Avenue Summer\n\nPark Avenue Summer is another one of the great books set in NYC by Renée Rosen. This 1960s novel focuses on the true story of Helen Gurley Brown, Cosmopolitan magazine’s former editor in chief. The story is also about Alice, Helen’s secretary, who moves from the Midwest to NYC in hopes of becoming a photographer. She is a loyal assistant to her boss as Helen goes through all the trials and tribulations of running a magazine as a woman in a male dominated world.\n\nWhere to Visit: Walk along Park Avenue and see if you can visualize what the city looked like during Helen’s time. You’ll see many buildings that have been around since at least the 60s, like the Waldorf Astoria, the Helmsley Building, the MetLife Building, and Grand Central Station.\n\nThere are so many books set in New York. It can be really hard to choose the best books about NYC. I hope you found some of these NYC novels set in the past that you want to add to your reading list!\n\nLet me know if you have any more suggestions on historical fiction books set in NYC that I need to read!\n\nMore About NYC\n\nBOOKS SET IN NYC\n\nChick Lit\n\nChildren’s Books\n\nBROADWAY\n\nHow to Get Discount Broadway Tickets\n\nCHRISTMAS\n\nThe Best Things to Do in New York in December\n\nITINERARIES\n\n4 Days for First Time Visitors\n\n5 Days: One Day in Each Borough\n\nLIFE IN NYC\n\nMoving to NYC Alone\n\nHow to Save Money Living in NYC\n\nMUSEUMS\n\nNYC Museums by Category\n\nNew York Historical Society\n\nMuseum of the City of New York\n\nTOURS\n\nThe Best NYC Tours\n\nWHERE TO STAY\n\nGrandview Hotel (Queens)\n\nWhere to Stay in Brooklyn"
