        "text": "Published by Doubleday on May 28, 2024\n\nJohn Grisham is at his best when he works racial injustice into his stories. In a 2022 interview, Grisham said he “grew up in the Jim Crow South. A very segregated, racist society was almost in my DNA. It’s a long struggle to overcome that and to look back at the way I was raised and not be resentful toward my parents and other people who helped raise me for their extreme racism. It was such a hard right-wing, racist society that I grew up in.”\n\nCamino Ghosts is Grisham’s third novel set on Camino Island, a fictional location off the northeast coast of Florida. A central character is a descendent of slaves. The novel reminds the reader that Florida entered the union as a slave state. I assume that will be enough to get the novel banned in Florida’s school libraries because Ron DeSantis thinks it is wrong to offend the imagined sensibilities of white children by teaching them the truth about southern history. Most rational people believe children should be taught to learn from the past, but denial and ignorance are the preferred tools of education in today’s Florida.\n\nThe descendent in question is Lovely Jackson. Now about 80 years old, Lovely lives on Camino Island but was born on a nearby island that the locals call Dark Isle. The island is said to be haunted and enough people have died after venturing to the island that the legends are cautiously regarded as true.\n\nLovely wrote a book that recounted the oral history her ancestries passed down about their lives. The first island settlers had been captured in Africa for sale into slavery. A few Africans survived a shipwreck, killed the white survivors who enslaved them, and protected their new island home from white men.\n\nNalla was one of the survivors. Lovely is one of Nalla’s descendants. Nalla was raped by one of the slave traders and was pregnant with his child. She used the witchcraft she learned in her childhood to place a curse on the island. White men who set foot on the island are doomed. The curse has so far been completely effective.\n\nDevelopers are itching to get their hands on Dark Isle because it has a beach. Until Hurricane Leo, building a bridge to the island was impractical. The hurricane changed the topography, making it possible for Tidal Breeze, an unscrupulous real estate developer, to demand that the state pay for a bridge so it can fill the beaches with condos for rich people. Most local residents are tired of developments that displace less affluent people with wealthy condo dwellers, although a few are persuaded that development brings economic benefits that outweigh the environmental destruction that has devastated Florida.\n\nSteven Mahon is an environmental lawyer who wants to throw a wrench in Tidal Breeze’s plan to bulldoze Dark Isle. He realizes that, as the last inhabitant of Dark Isle, Nalla may have a claim to ownership of the island through adverse possession. Proving that Nalla owns the island would be the quickest way to prevent Tidal Breze from destroying it. The problem is that Nalla has no corroborating evidence to prove that she was born on Dark Isle or that her ancestors ever lived there. The state claims ownership of all uninhabited islands near Florida and Tidal Breeze has engineered a behind-the-scenes sweetheart deal to buy it from the state.\n\nThe story follows two characters who appeared in earlier Camino Island novels. Bruce Cable owns a successful independent bookstore that caters to island residents and tourists. Mercer Mann is a novelist who spends part of the year on the island. Mercer decides that Lovely has a story worth telling. Bruce is a fan of Lovely’s self-published book about the island and is responsible for the few sales that Lovely made. He encourages Mercer to tell Lovely’s story in a work of nonfiction and to bring Tidal Breeze into the narrative.\n\nPolitical corruption and environmental destruction are two of the novel’s themes, from Tidal Breeze’s attempt to influence a judge to its use of campaign contributions to assure that state officials ignore the environmental consequences of its development projects. The larger theme is Florida’s history as a slave state and the continuing impact that slavery has had on the state’s Black residents. I was particularly moved by Lovely’s testimony that she wanted to tell her story because so many stories of slaves have not been told — a truth that seems particularly evident in Florida, where a majority of the state’s legislators seem to believe that stories about white slaveowners are best forgotten.\n\nI am hot and cold on Grisham, but I enjoyed the trial scenes in Camino Ghosts. Lovely is a fun and sympathetic character. The plot is simple but compelling. The present day story might be too upbeat to be credible, but Grisham balances the good feelings with the harrowing reality of the slave trade. My primary reason for giving Camino Ghosts a strong recommendation is that it is so different from most legal thrillers. It’s always good to read something fresh in a genre that tends to rehash stale plots.\n\nRECOMMENDED"
