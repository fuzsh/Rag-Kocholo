        "text": "IMAGINE living in Rome and never seeing the Vatican. Or visiting Orlando and ignoring Walt Disney World. Man-made wonders are meant to be seen, no matter one's religion or age. Yet every day thousands of Long Islanders pass by an extraordinary wonder.\n\n\"This is really something,\" John Cooney of Kings Park said as he and Phil Battaglia had their first look at the hidden treasure, Our Lady of the Island shrine in Eastport.\n\nWe're so high up,\" Mr. Battaglia said. The South Shore is not known for hilly terrain. It is about as flat as Florida, where the highest peak may be Space Mountain in Disney World. But in Eastport there is a high hill, courtesy of a glacier that descended centuries ago. The glacier deposited not only the hill, but also a huge rock on top of it. \"That rock probably came from Canada,\" said Ned Dougherty of Westhampton Beach, who visits the site often.\n\nOn top of the rock the Montfort Missionaries erected an 18-foot-tall statue of Mary, holding Jesus. The shrine, which has survived several hurricanes, and the panoramic view surrounding it, are an incredible sight. For many people the first reaction on seeing it is simply, \"Wow!\"\n\n\"Wow, there's the ocean,\" Mr. Battaglia said as he looked down over farmlands and the small residential communities that have cropped up on the Hamptons fringe. Mr. Battaglia and Mr. Cooney are volunteer firefighters. \"We were out here for the Westhampton fire,\" Mr. Battaglia said. \"But that was at night. We never knew this was here.\"\n\n\"I'm amazed at the amount of local people who don't know this exists,\" said Jean Benvenuto of Center Moriches, who has worked for 17 years in the shrine's gift shop. On the 70 acres surrounding the statue there are several attractions including the gift shop, where miniature copies of the shrine are sold; a cafeteria, a chapel, a hall where Sunday Masses are celebrated, a Rosary walk through the woods, the Stations of the Cross and a large Pieta.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
