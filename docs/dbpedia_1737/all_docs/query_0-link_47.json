        "text": "The Kaiju no 8 episode 8 release date is fast approaching, and the battlefield is a mess, with our heroes facing more than they bargained for.\n\nThe Defense Force’s Third Division, which includes our heroes Kafka Hibino, Reno Ichikawa, and Iharu Furuhashi, will have to work overtime if they hope to return in one piece.\n\nAfter the action-packed events of episode 7, this next installment promises an even more intense fight between the Defense Force and the monsters that threaten humanity.\n\nBuckle up for episode 8, where the Third Division’s struggle for survival continues.\n\nKafka Hibino versus Soshiro Hoshina — Kaiju no 8 episode 7 recap\n\nEpisode 7, titled Kaiju no 9, threw Reno Ichikawa and Iharu Furuhashi headfirst into danger.\n\nA mysterious humanoid kaiju launched a surprise attack, wounding the officers. The two tried to call for backup, but the enemy kaiju disrupted their communication line with the Third Division.\n\nThanks to intel from Kikoru Shinomiya’s previous encounter, Reno narrowly avoided a fatal blow. He urged Iharu to retreat and run to call for backup, but Iharu selflessly leaped back into the fray to defend his comrade.\n\nJust as the situation seemed dire, Kafka Hibino arrived and transformed into Kaiju no 8. With his superior strength, Kafka delivered a series of powerful attacks that exposed the enemy’s core.\n\nHowever, the arrival of two patrolling Defense Force members caused Kafka to hesitate, giving the humanoid kaiju a chance to escape.\n\nKafka disappeared from the scene to avoid further conflict with the Defense Force. Unfortunately during his retreat, he encounters vice-captain Soshiro Hoshina, who, believing that Kaiju no 8 attacked Reno and Iharu, activated his combat suit to 92 percent combat power, ready to neutralize.\n\nThe episode ends on a cliffhanger, leaving viewers to wonder about Kafka’s fate and the growing suspicion surrounding his true identity.\n\nWho is Kaiju no 9?\n\nAt the time of writing, Kaiju no 9 serves as the series’s main antagonist. This humanoid kaiju is known for reviving the monsters killed by the Defense Force for unknown reasons.\n\nKaiju no 9 first appeared in chapter 6 of the manga and episode 3 of the anime. It has infiltrated the Professional Kaiju Cleaning Company Monster Sweeper Inc., which gave the monster access to neutralization zones.\n\nStanding out with a tall, beige, skeletal body, spikes on its shoulders, and a head with two hammerhead shark-like protuberances, Kaiju no 9 is cold and calm.\n\nIt is ruthless and driven, completing its missions without hesitation and eliminating enemies crossing its path. Kaiju no 9’s goal is to study humans and evolve monsters to become stronger.\n\nWho is Soshiro Hoshina?\n\nSoshiro Hoshina is the vice-captain of the Third Division of the Defense Force, who comes from the renowned Hoshina Family, a clan of swordsmen from the Muromachi period. He is the younger brother of Soichiro Hoshina — another important figure in the Defense Force.\n\nFirst appearing in chapter 4 of the manga and episode 3 of the anime, Soshiro is an extraordinarily athletic fighter of average height. He has a lean, muscular build and short, dark violet hair styled in a bob cut.\n\nWhile on duty, Soshiro wears the standard Defense Force uniform and combat suit, wielding a special kaiju weapon to enhance his monster-fighting abilities.\n\nDespite his laid-back demeanor and tendency to make fun of others, especially Kafka Hibino, he has a serious side where he speaks firmly and opens his eyes wide to emphasize his words.\n\nWhile his firearms skills are below average, Soshiro excels in using a blade and engaging in close-quarters combat, making him highly effective against small to mid-sized kaiju.\n\nKaiju no 8 episode 8 release date\n\nThe next episode airs on Saturday, June 1, 2024, at 11:00 p.m. (JST) Japanese Standard Time.\n\nThe release times and schedule for international viewers vary based on their time zone.\n\nWhere to watch Kaiju no 8\n\nAmazon Prime Video\n\nDisney Plus\n\nNetflix\n\nCrunchyroll\n\nYou can watch the anime on streaming platforms.\n\nAvailability may differ depending on your region."
