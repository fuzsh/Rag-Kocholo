These include the Dagi, Khasa, Hali, Koli, Dhaugri, Kanaura, Dasa and Kirat tribes, who have occupied these lands from the time of the Indus Valley civilization.\n\nA series of kings and empires came, conquered and have lived in Himachal Pradesh since then. Some of the more noteworthy were the Gupta Empire, King Harshavardhan, Rajput princes, Timur, Sikander Lodi and even the Delhi Sultanate. However, on the whole, the provinces of Himachal Pradesh enjoyed their independence to quite an extent. Then came the Kingdom of Gorkha, who conquered Shimla and slowly expanded their empire. But their rule was not to last too long once the British came in. The Gorkhas were expelled and the British became the dominant force in the region.\n\nIt was after Independence, in 1948 that 28 princely states of the region were integrated into the province of Himachal Pradesh. Finally, in 1971 the state of Himachal Pradesh was born."
