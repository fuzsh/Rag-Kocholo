        "text": "Slowest Train In India Name: Indian Railways network spans over 63,000-km of rail routes and 6,800 stations. There are hundreds of trains that ferry people from across the length and breadth of the country.\n\nAt a time when the government is planning to introduce semi-high-speed trains, there is a train that covers a distance of 46-km in 5 hours at an average speed of 9 kmph.\n\nNilgiri Express Route, Train Number\n\nNilgiri Passenger originates from Mettupalayam railway station and terminates at Ooty station (56136/56137).\n\nThe Mettupalayam-Ooty Nilgiri passenger train is the slowest train in India, running at a speed of 9 kmph, which is roughly 16 times slower than the fastest train in India.\n\nNilgiri Express Route\n\nThis slowest train in India passes through Keller, Coonoor, Wellington, Lovedale and Ootacamund stations.\n\nAccording to the UNESCO website, the construction of the Nilgiri Mountain Railway was first proposed in 1854, but due to the difficulty of the mountainous location, the work started in 1891 and was completed in 1908.\n\nUNESCO also said that this railway scaling an elevation of 326 metres to 2,203 metres, represented the latest technology of the time.\n\nMettupalayam Ooty Nilgiri passenger train timings\n\nMettupalayam Ooty Nilgiri passenger train coaches are in blue and cream colour made of wood, with large size windows to enjoy the scenic beauty of Nilgiri hills.\n\nThe train has both First Class and General Category coaches. This train leaves from Mettupalayam station at 7:10 am and reaches Ooty by around 12 noon.\n\nThe train starts from Ooty at 2 pm and comes back to Mettupalayam station at 5:30 pm.\n\nHow to book ticket for Mettupalayam Ooty Nilgiri passenger train\n\nTickets can be booked on the Kalka-Shimla Toy Train at a railway station counter or IRCTC website."
