Every day, it transports millions of passengers, touching countless lives and stories. Whether you're a daily commuter, a casual traveler, or someone looking to explore the length and breadth of India, Indian Railways has something for everyone.\n\nUnderstanding Indian Railways: An Overview\n\nHistory and Evolution of Indian Railways\n\nLet's embark on a journey back in time, tracing the roots of Indian Railways. The story begins in 1853, when the first passenger train in India rolled out from Bombay to Thane. Since then, Indian Railways has grown and evolved, overcoming numerous challenges and milestones.

These zones are further divided into divisions, each managed by a Divisional Railway Manager. From the Northern Railways headquartered in Delhi to the Southern Railways in Chennai, each zone has its unique characteristics and challenges.\n\nThese zones work tirelessly to ensure the smooth functioning of the railway network. They cater to the diverse needs of the regions they serve, from managing the bustling suburban networks in cities to ensuring the smooth operation of trains in the scenic and challenging terrains of the hills.\n\nHere is the complete table for the 18 zones in Indian Railways:\n\nPopular Train Routes and Services\n\nIndian Railways offers a wide array of train services, designed to cater to the varied needs of its passengers.
