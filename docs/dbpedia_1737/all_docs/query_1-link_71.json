While the rest of the country bears the scorching heat, people in Himachal Pradesh enjoy the awesome weather. However, some people prefer the chilly weather in the state. Before you go for the Himachal tour packages, it is better to know about the months that you may like to plan your trip.\n\nSummer in Himachal Pradesh\n\nMonsoon in Himachal Pradesh\n\nWinter in Himachal Pradesh\n\nSummer in Himachal Pradesh\n\nThe summer season starts in Himachal Pradesh in March and you can travel to this place till June.

The state boasts eight national highways and 19 state highways that keep Himachal Pradesh connected with other states in the country. If you are traveling by your own car or are booking a cab, then you can visit even the remote places here. However, if you travel via bus, you have to follow a certain route.
