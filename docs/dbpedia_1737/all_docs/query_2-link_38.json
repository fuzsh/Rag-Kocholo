        "text": "Synopsis\n\nIn Haryana, the ruling BJP-led NDA faces challenges ahead of the 2024 Lok Sabha Elections. Economic slowdown, farming issues, and unemployment stir discontent among voters, potentially weakening the incumbent's hold. Opposition parties like Congress and AAP eye this opportunity, vying for support.\n\nHaryana, strategically positioned between Delhi and Punjab, plays a pivotal role in North India's political landscape. As the 2024 Lok Sabha Elections draw near, the state's political climate is under close scrutiny. Currently held by the BJP-led NDA alliance, which swept all 10 Lok Sabha seats in 2019, Haryana faces potential challenges due to brewing discontent among the populace. Issues such as economic slowdown, agricultural distress, and unemployment simmer beneath the surface, potentially eroding the incumbent's stronghold. Opposition parties like Congress, AAP, and regional players like INLD are viewing this discontent as an opportunity to rally support and mount a significant challenge against the BJP-led NDA's dominance.\n\nHaryana Lok Sabha Elections 2024: Dates\n\nThe Election Commission has announced the schedule for polling in Haryana for the Lok Sabha polls 2024. The state will go to polls in a single phase on May 25. The results will be declared on June 4.\n\nHaryana Lok Sabha Elections 2024: Phases\n\nGiven the relatively small number of seats, Haryana will once again witness its Lok Sabha Elections conducted in a single phase on May 25th.\n\nMORE STORIES FOR YOU✕\n\n« Back to recommendation stories\n\nI don't want to see these stories because\n\nThey are not relevant to meThey disrupt the reading flowOthers\n\nSUBMIT\n\nHaryana Lok Sabha Elections 2024: Constituencies\n\nRanking 18th in India's roster of Lok Sabha seat allocations, Haryana boasts a modest tally of ten seats.
