        "text": "Nasya treatment means putting nasal drops. While you might be already knowing about usage of nasal drops to relieve nasal congestion, Ayurvedic nasya therapy is quite different from this usual practice. While putting the drops into nostrils remains the same, the purpose of this treatment varies in Ayurveda.\n\nWhile there are many types of Nasya treatments, there is one type which can be done on a daily basis for the overall improvement of health and to prevent diseases.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe learned physician should administered nasya karma in disease of head because nose is the gate way of head and as such drug administered by this route pervades the head and thus destroys the diseases of Shirovirechana, Shirovireka and Murdha virechana are the synonyms of Nasya karma.\n\nDefinition\n\nAyurvedic texts define nasya as-“Oushadham oushadha siddha sneham va nasikayaam deeyate inti nasyam”\n\nIt means, procedure where the medicated drugs or oils are administrated through the nostrils.\n\nNote: There are many types of Nasya using powders, juice extracts, decoctions, herbal fumes etc. But they are used for therapeutic purposes. Here, I am only concentrating on the one that everyone can use on daily basis.\n\nNasal medication is especially described for the treatment of diseases of the parts above the shoulders;\n\nNose is considered as the gateway for the head, spreading through this, the nasal medication reaches all the parts of the head and neck and cures the diseases of respective region.\n\nNasya Procedure for healthy people\n\nThis is if anyone is interested to do on a daily basis. Consult your doctor for the right advice.\n\nThis is the procedure –\n\nIf there is urge to urinate or defecate, finish that first.\n\nIt is better to brush the teeth first, if you are doing it in the morning.\n\nTake sesame oil and do gentle massage over the entire face and neck.\n\nFor the purpose of massage, you can use\n\nMaha Narayana oil, if you are targeting headache and sinusitis.\n\nNalpamaradi taila / Kumkumadi Taila – for good facial skin and complexion\n\nBala Ashwagandhadi Taila / Ksheerabala taila 101 – to improve strength of sense organs.\n\nWhile massaging, avoid eye lids and eyes.\n\nAfter this, you need to give some sort of heat treatment.\n\nIt can be\n\n– exposing to early morning sunlight,\n\n– gentle exercise to warm up the face,\n\n– washing face with lukewarm water\n\n– gently heating a towel over a Dosa pan and patting over face, avoiding eyes.\n\nHot fomentation should be given to face and neck, avoiding eyes and eye lids.\n\nLie on a cot in a room devoid of breeze or excess sunlight.\n\nFor convenience, keep a thin pillow below neck.\n\nLie straight with his face upwards, extending arms and legs.\n\nTake Anu Tailam – the best oil for Nasya procedure, available in any local Ayurveda store. The oil is slightly warmed in hot water bed, just before administration. It should not be too hot. It should just be lukewarm.\n\nTwo drops of the oil are instilled into each nostril.\n\nThis can be done by another person as self administration may be difficult.\n\nAfter instilling, soles, neck, palms, ears etc. should be massaged mildly.\n\nFor next 10 minutes, sputum along with medicine may come out. You have to spit it all out.\n\nIf you feel excess of heat / burning sensation, then wash your face with cold water.\n\nAfter this procedure, one should lie with the face upwards, for 2 minutes.\n\nThen, ideally, smoke inhalation with medicated herbs and mouth gargling should be done, to cleanse the throat.\n\nThis is preferably done on empty stomach, before tea, coffee, at least 30 minutes before bath, in the morning, after bowel evacuation.\n\nIf you get any doubts, if you have any underlying disease, please consult your Ayurveda doctor before taking up this nasya procedure.\n\nIf you do Jala Neti, then better to maintain a gap of 30 minutes between that and Nasya.\n\nNasya indications\n\nIndications\n\nThis type of Nasya is applicable to all healthy people.\n\nSpecifically it is helpful in people suffering from\n\nStiffness of the head\n\nStiffness of the teeth\n\nStiffness of the neck\n\nObstruction of the throat\n\nStiffness of the jaw\n\nRhinitis – running nose\n\nUvulitis\n\nTonsillitis\n\nCorneal disorders\n\nHyper pigmentation, freckles\n\nMigraine, headache\n\nNeck stiffness\n\nStiffness of shoulder\n\nDiseases of the oral cavity\n\nNasal disorders\n\nEar disorders\n\nEye diseases\n\nHeadache\n\nFacial paralysis\n\nMotor neuron disorders\n\nConvulsions\n\nGoitre\n\nGingivitis\n\nLoose teeth\n\nHoarse voice\n\nSlurred speech\n\nNeuro muscular disorders\n\nOne who practices nasal therapy in time according to the prescribed method, his eyes, nose and ears are not affected by any morbidity.\n\nHis hair and head never become white or grey; he never experiences hair fall; those rather grow luxuriously.\n\nBeing nourished by inhalation, his veins, joints, ligaments and tendons of head and neck gain greater strength. His face becomes cheerful and plumpy; and his voice becomes sweet, stabilized and stertorous. Here ‘plumpy’ signifies well grown cheek and chin bones along with healthy amounts of muscles and fat.\n\nAll the sense organs become clear and three is considerable strength.\n\nDiseases relating to head and neck do not attack such a person. Even though, he might be growing old, old age does not affect his head (in the form of grey hair etc (reference: Charaka Sutrasthana 5th chapter)\n\nHow to Use Ayurvedic Nasal Drops for Headache?\n\nIndications of Nasya karma:\n\nShira sthambha – stiffness of head\n\nManya sthambha – stiffness of neck\n\nPinasa – running nose, upper respiratory tract infection\n\nDanta sthambha – stiffness in teeth\n\nHanusthambha – stiffness in jaw\n\nGalashaluka – throat disorders with a feeling of constriction / foreign body\n\nGalashundika – tonsillitis\n\nShukragata Roga – eye disorders of sclera\n\nTimira – vision disorders\n\nVartma Roga – eye lid disorders\n\nVyanga – discolored skin patches on face\n\nAmsashula – pain in the upper back\n\nArdhawabhedaka – migraine\n\nKarnashula – earache\n\nGreewa Roga – neck pain\n\nNasashula – pain in the nasal region\n\nMukha Roga – oral disorders\n\nAksi shula – eye pain\n\nSira shula – headache\n\nArdita – paralysis\n\nApatantraka, Apatanaka – seizures\n\nGalaganda – cervical lymphadenitis, thyroid disorders\n\nDantashula – toothache\n\nDantaharsha – tingling sensation in teeth\n\nArbuda- tumours\n\nVakgraha – voice disturbances\n\nSwarabheda – hoarseness of voice\n\nNasya contraindications\n\nPersons unsuitable to nasal medication :-\n\nNasal medication should not be administered to persons who\n\nhave just then consumed water, wine, artificial poison (Garavisha – chronic poisoning) and fat (as part of Snehana therapy) or who wish to consume them, soon,\n\nwho is suffering from indigestion,\n\nwho have taken food just then,\n\nwho have just taken bath or who desire to take bath-soon.

route, passes via Shrigantaka marma and enters all the sense organs and strengthens them.\n\nAs per modern principles, medicines administered nasally can have an impact on eye, facial skin, ears, nose and oral cavity.\n\nInstruction to patient\n\nInstructions for the patients during Nasya:\n\nAs described by Charaka, Vagbhata and Sushrtha the following instructions should be observed by a patient while undergoing Nasya karma.\n\nSwedana and Mardana on the Shira, Gatra and Manya\n\nShira (head) should not be excessive flexed or extended\n\nPatient should lie Supine (Uttana ) for a time interval

improves eye sight, bestows sturdiness to the teeth and mitigates the Vata.\n\nShirahshula (headache)\n\nIndriya Bibhrama (confusion)\n\nKapha Srawa (salivation)\n\nRationality of nasya therapy\n\nIt is a well-known factor that the olfactory center is located in the temporal lobe of the brain. The filaments of first cranial nerve, Olfactory nerve arise from the upper parts of the nasal mucosa, from where the minute fibrils pass to meet with the fibres from olfactory bulb. This nerve passes the cribriform plate present over here and joins the olfactory center in the temporal lobe of the brain.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, the numerous capillaries embedded in the nasal mucosa absorb the medicinal principles administered through nasya and produce various kinds of local and systemic effects by mechanical and chemical reactions.\n\nThe discharge secreted contain the blocking materials and are evacuated through nasal route.\n\nThus the pathological condition is reversed and the disease is relieved.\n\nRemedy for throat irritation after Nasya\n\nQ: I feel throat irritation after Nasya with Anu taila. Remedies?\n\nA: After nasya treatment, gargle with hot water and spit out for 2 minutes time.\n\nTake half a teaspoon of turmeric powder. Add just a small pinch of black pepper powder, mix it with ghee, burn and inhale fumes. This will dry up the remnant Kapha, leftover after nasya.\n\nIf you are okay with spices, taking 1 gram of Trikatu powder with honey should also be useful. Or ginger juice – 1 teapsoon with a little honey is also fine to take.\n\nExcessive sneezing after nasya\n\nThis can occur in people with allergy or hyper-sensitivity. For them, before doing Nasya, gentle face massage with a few drops of sesame oil, gentle fomentation with lukewarm water face wash is recommended before taking up Nasya.\n\nIf the oil quality is very low, this can also cause sneezing and local irritation.\n\nChoice of liquids for Nasya\n\nI have given below commonly used nasal drops. But you need to consult an Ayurveda doctor to check what suits you. Learn about nasya therapy in detail here\n\nThe common dose is 2 drops to each nostril on an empty stomach.\n\nIt is ideal to massage face and neck with a few drops of sesame oil, leave it for 3 minutes then wash the face with lukewarm water, before putting nasal drops.\n\nDefault nasal drops is\n\nAnu oil or anu tailam. It is prepared with sesame oil base and contains safe and effective herbs of both hot and cold qualities.\n\nGeneral benefits: Radiant skin, strong shoulders, Improvement in voice, strong sense organs, improved hair quality and prevention of early greying of hair.

Read more about almond benefits\n\nModern Steam inhalation vs Nasya\n\nIn modern steam therapy for nasal congestion, an essential oil mix such as Camphor, Chlorothymol, Eucalyptol, Terpinol, and Menthol are used. The essential oils are sold in capsule form. It is cut open and put into hot water and steam is inhaled. Here the goal is to undo the chest congestion and help in breathing.\n\nBut this is not same as nasya therapy. Here, the goal is to not only detoxify and strengthen the respiratory tract. All organs in head and neck region are targeted with Nasya. Even thyroid hormone complications, migraine, neuralgia etc are treated with nasya therapy.\n\nGentle face and neck massage with oil and sweating treatment is advised ahead of nasya therapy to loosen the toxins. Nasal drops administered after massage and sweating help in easy evacuation of loosened toxins.\n\nModern steam therapy with essential oils is not recommended on a daily basis for healthy people. Whereas, Nasya therapy with minimal dose, is recommended as a healthy daily routine.\n\nIs it a good idea to use essential oil steam therapy, ahead of Nasya treatment?\n\nAfter oil massage, before nasya treatment, sweating therapy is advised as per Ayurveda. The sweating treatment on face can be given with a towel dipped in hot water. Not only this, even herbal teas are also used for sweating treatment. Hence, it is fine to use essential oil sweating treatment ahead of Nasya therapy, with the following conditions\n\nThe essential oil should be very mild.\n\nOnly one drop of it can be used.\n\nIt should not cause eye irritation.\n\nDo not use it everyday. Use it only once a week.\n\nGhee As Nasal Drops\n\nCan ghee be used as nasal drops?\n\nGhee is frequently used as nasal drops – Nasya therapy.\n\nGhee balances Vata and Pitta Dosha. Hence for many Vata and Pitta related complaints, such as –\n\nmigraine\n\npsychiatric disorders\n\ndepression\n\nanxiety,\n\nphobia,\n\nlack of sleep etc. issues, ghee nasya is suitable.\n\nFor nasya, cow ghee can be used directly or herbal ghees can also be used.\n\nMaha Kalyanaka, brahmi ghrita are useful to improve brain functions, in psychiatric disorders.\n\nSaraswata ghrita is speech improvement.\n\nRead more about cow ghee benefits here\n\nMigraine – Nasal Drops\n\nFor Migraine , Which medicine can be used as nasal drops?\n\nThe choice of oil for migraine cure depends on the nature and intensity of the migraine.\n\nIf there is severe pain in the face, neck, sensitivity to sound, scalp tenderness (pain on touching the head), then Vata Dosha is more dominant. In such a case, Mahanarayana tailam or Shadbindu oil or Anu oil is useful.\n\nIf there is aura, blurred or impaired vision, seeing flash of light, burning sensation increased warmth, redness of eyes, nausea and vomiting, then Pitta is more dominant. In such a case, Varanadi Ghritam (herbal ghee), Ksheerabala 101 oil are useful.\n\nWarming the Liquid\n\nShould the Nasya Oil be Warmed Before Administration?\n\nUsually, oil or ghee used for Nasya is slightly warmed just above normal room temperature before administration. Lukewarm oil absorbs faster and quickly spreads in the body.\n\nHow to warm it?\n\nNasya oil or ghee is a very heat sensitive product. The blend of oil and herbs is very delicate. Direct heating may cause loss of medicinal principles from the oil. Hence, it is best to warm it in a water bath. take a wide mouthed vessel. Take water in it. Bring it to around 50-60 degree Celsius. Then dip the nasya oil or ghee bottle in the water for 1-2 minutes. Before using the oil, test the oil for its temperature. You can do this putting a drop of the oil on to your hand. It should not be very hot.\n\nWith Sesame oil\n\nSesame oil is sweet, bitter in taste and has astringent sub-taste. It has the capability to enter into minute body pores and bring about soothing action. It is hot, strong and piercing in nature.\n\nBelow-mentioned benefits of sesame oil can be expected when it is used as nasal drops.\n\nLekhana – scraping action – Useful in case of sinusitis\n\nDeepana – improves digestion strength\n\nSroto Vishodhana – clears and cleanses body channels\n\nTvachya – good for skin, useful in dry facial skin, dry hairs.\n\nVayasthapana – anti aging, rejuvenating, improves qualities of hair and face. Avoids early graying of hair, hair fall and wrinkling of skin\n\nMedhakara – Improves intelligence\n\nSmrithikara – improves memory\n\nTime gap for food\n\nIn the morning, better to do it on empty stomach, wait for 30 minutes, then have your morning beverage or breakfast.\n\nIf you do it in the evening, maintain a gap of at least 30 minutes between nasal drops and food.\n\nIt is always good to do nasya before food. Doing it after food can cause vomiting and increased chances of weak digestion strength due to Kapha accumulation.\n\nSynonyms, meaning\n\nSnuff, Errhine , Sternutatory\n\nSynonyms of nasya –\n\nShiro virechana, murdha virechana and shiro vireka – term virechana means purgation, thus nasya is a treatment of purging head of its impurities. Shira means head.\n\nNasta prachardana – here prachardana means to cause emesis. Nasya is to expel doshas accumulated in head by a similar procedure as that of emesis, it is like causing head to vomit and expel its doshas. Since kapha is main dosha located in head, term prachardana could have been used synonymous for nasal medication. This treatment is equally useful in combating vata and pitta aggravation in head.\n\nNavana – also means sternutatory\n\nNavana nasya\n\nIt is an important type of Nasya, which can be used always.\n\nIt can be mainly classified into Snehana and Sodhana.\n\nScholar sushrutha called it as Snehana nasya.\n\nNavana is administered by instilling the drops of a medicated oil in the nose. Anutaila is used for this type of nasya.\n\nIn this type of nasya the pichu of karpasa is made and dipped into Sneha, the drops, formed after taking the pichu out of the Sneha, are dropped into the nostrils. Navana is gererally a sneha nasya and is known as nasya in general.\n\nThe naavana nasya is indicated in following conditions:\n\nClassification\n\nTypes of Nasya:\n\nCharaka has classified nasya as follows:\n\nCharaka Siddhi Sthana\n\nNavana: Snehana and Shodhana\n\nAvapida: Shodhana and Stambhana\n\nDhumapana – herbal smoking\n\nDhumra nasya: Prayogika; Virechaniya; Snehaniya\n\nPratimarsha: Snehana and Virechana\n\nThe above mentioned 5 types of nasyas are grouped according to their actions in the following three classes.\n\nRechana (Purification)\n\nTarpana (Nourishing)\n\nShamana (Retraining)\n\nCharaka also described 7 types of nasyas on the basis of the usable parts of the nasya drugs:\n\nPhala nasya – using fruits\n\nPatra nasya – leaves\n\nMoola nasya – roots\n\nKaanda nasya – stem\n\nPushpa nasya – flowers\n\nTwak nasya – bark\n\nNiryaasa nasya – extract / exudate\n\nAll the above mentioned drugs can be used for nasya in the form of Churna, kalka, swarasa, ksira.

So, the medicinal principles spread from this marma, reach the target organ and do healing action.\n\nAs you can above, about the timing of nasal drops, there is no mention of just ahead of bed time.\n\nSo, it is not a good idea to put the nasal drops just before going to sleep.\n\nYou might argue, it may improve the quality of sleep and in some cases decongest the nasal cavity.\n\nIt is true that Brahmi taila / Kalyanaka ghrita as nasal drops are administered during evening or night time to improve the quality of sleep. But it is not like applying a couple of drops of it makes the person sleep instantly. The way it works is by gradually relaxing the mind, soothing the nerves, decreasing unnecessary thoughts, calms down Vata Dosha and then improves the quality of sleep. It may take at least 10-30 minutes to show this action.\n\nSaline water is used as nasal drops as a decongestant at night. But these are not to be used just ahead of bed time.\n\nIf some drops remain in the nasal cavity, it can lead to congestion, difficulty in breathing etc.\n\nIt is best to maintain at least a gap of 30 minutes between bed time and the nasal drops.\n\nCommonly used nasal medicines\n\nNasya Ausadhi kalpana – commonly used:\n\nChurna – kalpana\n\nKatphala Churna\n\nTrikatu Churna\n\nKatu tumbi Churna\n\nPippali Churna\n\nMaricha Churna\n\nVidanga Churna\n\nHerbal oils\n\nAnu taila\n\nSadbindu taila\n\nJatyadi taila\n\nPadmakadi taila\n\nPanchaguna taila\n\nKumkumadi taila\n\nVacha\n\nGhrta\n\nGhanasara yoga\n\nExcessive phlegm after nasal drops?\n\nAfter putting anu taila, I feel excessive phlegm collection in the nose, causing blockage.\n\nIn extreme winters and spring and in Kapha dominant people, this is a common issue.\n\nHere are the remedies:\n\nMake sure to do sesame oil face massage and mild sweating therapy of face by mopping the face with a towel dipped in lukewarm water or lukewarm water wash or gentle steam. This is essential to loosen up the toxins and Kapha Dosha, ahead of nasya treatment.\n\nAfter nasya treatment, gargle with hot water and spit out for 2 minutes.\n\nAvoid nasal drops prepared with coconut oil as base oil. It is a coolant and can increase Kapha Dosha. Prefer nasal drops prepared with sesame oil.\n\nTake half a teaspoon of turmeric powder. Add just a small pinch of black pepper powder, mix it with ghee, burn and inhale fumes. This will dry up the remnant Kapha, leftover after nasya.\n\nIf you are okay with spices, taking 1 gram of Trikatu powder with honey should also be useful.\n\nWith all these, if still the symptoms are persisting, it is better to consult an Ayurveda doctor in person.\n\nSome of the Nasya Kalpas indicated by Sharangadhara —\n\nGudadi nasya: – It is indicated in diseases of eyes, ears, nose, head, neck, lower jaw, throat, shoulders and back.\n\nMadhuka saradi nasya: It is indicated in apasmara (epilepsy), unmade (insanity) sannipatha (severe fevers) and apatantraka (tetanus)\n\nSaindavadi nasya: It relieves excessive drowsiness, tandra.\n\nMarichadi nasya: It forms a good pradhamana nasya.\n\nBrahmana nasya kalpana: It is indicated in diseases of head, nose, eyes, suryavarta, ardhavabheda, dantarogas, for debilitated persons.

Along with it, if jalaneti is done, it will make the area cold. This can lead to worsening of cold, cough, sinusitis etc.\n\nHence, I would not recommend doing anuthailam nasya and jala neti together.\n\nAt least there should be half an hour gap between these two.\n\nNose, throat irritation side effect\n\nWhat should be the exact posture of the head when putting shadbindu oil in nose? Also what is the exact procedure? Please clarify, since I have noticed that as soon as I use this, my nose and throat gets irritated.\n\nToday, we will discuss Nasya procedure and popular Ayurvedic formulation ‘Shadbindu taila’ which is used for Nasya treatment.\n\nLet us discuss Nasya first. Nasya is nasal administration of medicine. According to Ashtaanga Hrudaya, the definition of nasya is –\n\nनासायां भवं नस्यं ।\n\nnāsāyāṃ bhavaṃ nasyaṃ |\n\nNaasayaam Bhavam nasyam\n\nThe treatment which is performed through the nose is known as “Nasya”.\n\nऊर्ध्व जत्रुविकारेषु विषेशान्नस्यमिष्यते ।\n\nनासाहि शिरसो द्वारं तेन तद्व्याप्य हन्ति तान् ॥\n\nūrdhva jatruvikāreṣu viṣeśānnasyamiṣyate |\n\nnāsāhi śiraso dvāraṃ tena tadvyāpya hanti tān ||\n\nAshtanga Hrudayam Sutrasthana 10/1\n\nThe shloka means, for the disorders affecting oordhva jatru, that means, for organs of head and neck, such as eyes, ears, nose, throat, brain etc., nasal drops therapy is suitable.\n\nNasa hi shiraso dvaaram – means, nose is the door or entry point for the head. Hence, medicines administered through the nasal route help to target the diseases of head and neck.\n\nGenerally, nasal drops are administered to relieve nasal congestion. But Ayurvedic nasya procedure is quite different from the usual practice and the purpose of the treatment is just not limited to relieving nasal congestion.\n\nNasya… is one among the Panchakarma procedures, which is done by nasal administration of medicated oil, ghee, powder, fresh juice of herbs etc.\n\nThe person who wishes to undergo nasya, should undergo gentle facial massage with a suitable Ayurvedic oil and then mild fomentation is given to forehead, face and neck.\n\nThen, he should lie down in a supine (sUpine) position on a nasya table. His head should be slightly down and legs raised.\n\nHis Head should be slightly hanging, without excessive extension.\n\nA small pillow or folded towel can be kept under the neck for support.\n\nThis helps in easy passage of the oil/medicine in the downward direction (derection ) inside the nose. Eyes should be covered with a clean cloth or a cotton pad. Then the nasya medicine is instilled into the nostrils, drop by drop.\n\nMaintaining a proper posture is very important while performing nasya, especially the position of the head. If proper head posture is not maintained, there is a chance of nasya medicine entering in different directions, causing complications.\n\n‘Shadbindu taila’ is an herbal (erbal) nasya oil.\n\nIt is mainly used in complaints related to teeth, hair, vision and\n\ncervical spondylitis etc.\n\nThe word Shad… bindu means 6 …drops, which suggests that the common dosage of this oil is six drops.\n\nBut, the dosage can be increased or decreased according to the patient’s strength or disease condition. It can be used for a few days to several weeks.\n\nSesame (sesame)oil and the goat milk are the two familiar ingredients used in preparation of this oil. Castor, ginger, rock salt, cinnamon etc. are the other main ingredients.\n\nComing to the question of nose and throat irritation after nasya,\n\nUsually in this treatment, the patient feels the irritation. This is normal because of some of the ingredients used in the nasya medicine. But, if the irritation is severe or persists for a longer period, it is advisable to contact your doctor immediately.\n\nSo. It is always advised to undergo nasya treatment under the supervision of a qualified Ayurveda practitioner.\n\nPrecautions for nasya during pregnancy\n\nAbout Nasya Bindu and drops\n\nQ: No classical text says about drops. Bindu and drops are different. Sneha nasya Bindu pramana has been already standardised. Kindly update it. https://www.jaims.in/jaims/article/view/909\n\nThe mentioned research paper is just a small study on bindu and it cannot be standardized just with one single study with small number of patients.\n\nLike drops were non existent in ancient India, metric system was also non existent. Also, volume of the bindu changes with each liquid with different densities – ghee, castor oil, decoction water etc.\n\nConsidering all these, it is safe to explain concepts in terms of drops.\n\nReferences\n\nBOOKS AUTHORS\n\nCharaka Samhita Dr. Ramkaran Sharma and Vaidya Bhagwan Das\n\nSushrutha Samhita Kaviraj Kunjalal, Bhishagratna\n\nSharangadhara Samhita Prof. K.R.
