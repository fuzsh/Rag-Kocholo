Otherwise, a “resend login link” button should be offered.\n\nHas this already been implemented somewhere?\n\nIf not: which machinery exists, which could be used to implement it?\n\nYes. This is our prominent way to log into the forum. But for a big part of the users, this seems to be too difficult.\n\nIn addition, we face the problem that some users use non-identical email addresses in their communication. For example, (at)gmail.com and (at)googlemail.com, or email addresses with or without added dots in the username. They do not remember which email address they once wrote on the paper (yes, sorry, it’s Germany) registration form and are either unaware of these problems or of the possibility to learn about their “login email address” by checking their mail headers.\n\nTherefore, I am investigating a way that links sent to users allow users to log in without further knowledge of how to use the Discourse login procedure."
