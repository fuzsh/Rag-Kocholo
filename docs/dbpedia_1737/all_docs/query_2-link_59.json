        "text": "How to reach\n\nBy Road:\n\nDelhi - Chandigarh - Ropar - Nangal - Una - Mubarakpur - Bharwain - Chintpurni Route\n\nDelhi and Himachal State Transport run buses on the Delhi-Chandigarh-Chintpurni route. Buses running direct on the Delhi-Dharamshala and Delhi-Palampur route bypass Chandigarh and stop at either Bharwain or Chintpurni. Frequent State Transport bus services are also available from most important cities of Punjab, Haryana and Jammu and Kashmir. There are also very frequent buses plying on the Delhi-Chandigarh route (about 5 hours). Chintpurni is another 5 hours away by bus from Chandigarh.\n\nHimachal State Road Transport Corporation runs a Volvo tourist coach service from Delhi to Dharamshala which stops at Bharwain by request. The coach leaves Delhi Inter State Bus Terminus, Kashmiri Gate at 8 pm and arrives at Bharwain just after 4 am. The fare is approx. Rs 600. This is a very comfortable and fast service. Please inform the driver of the coach that you would like to get down at Bharwain. The downside is that you arrive very early at Bharwain and may have to wait for at least 1 hour before you can catch any kind of transport for the 3 km to Chintpurni. For the return journey to Delhi, you have to go to Kangra in person to make the necessary bookings. Online bookings can be made in advance as well.\n\nMore information is available from the Himachal State Road Transport Corporation website www.hrtc.gov.in\n\nBy Rail:\n\nClosest railheads are at Hoshiarpur (42km) and Amb Andaura (19 km).

A Jan Shatabdi Express leaves New Delhi at 2.35 pm and arrives at Una (via Chandigarh) at 10.10 pm.
