        "text": "Spending an evening at the best restaurants in Delhi is a love letter to the city’s glorious history of food. While some of these eateries have gone on for generations, others are creating new experiences for the young kids on the block. Like hipster cafes operating as chill pads for dudebros. Okay, that’s the worst example. What we mean is that the capital has a long time habit of telling stories through food. And only the top restaurants in Delhi have got that lingo right down to the tee.\n\nNow, hearing stories (or writing love letters ) is the least of your priorities. We get it. If you’re a working professional in the capital’s cutthroat corporate culture or a student navigating your hectic life through campus. And if you’re also new to the city, you’re probably too overwhelmed to focus on either of these things. But don’t worry. We’ve got you covered. Because we, at Stanza Living residences, know a thing or two about navigating your journey in the capital. From our first residence in the North campus, we’re now present in 20+ cities and housing 70,000+ residents all over the country. Afterall, we continue to make your lives easier. Where else would you find a place that serves healthy and homely meals, professional housekeeping, and a chill entertainment zone? Plus, weekly events to keep your fun quotient high and your stress levels low? Also, we even help you out whenever you need to go out and explore the city. So you can relax and spend more time on yourself. See, we’ve even made this list of the 15 best restaurants in Delhi just for you. So all you have to do is bookmark this page, and write down these names as quickly as you’d avoid those dudebros on dating apps!\n\nBest Restaurants in Delhi\n\nThese are the top 15 restaurants in Delhi for sure:\n\nIndian Accent, Chanakyapuri\n\nDum Pukht, Chanakyapuri\n\nMasala House, Sundar Nagar\n\nUnited Coffee House, Connaught Place\n\nGulati, Pandora Road\n\nPlum by Bent Chair, Aerocity\n\nOlive Bar and Kitchen, Mehrauli\n\nSagar Ratna, New Defence Colony\n\nThe Grammar Room, Kalka Das Marg\n\nGuppy, Lodhi Colony\n\nBo Tai, Kalka Das Marg\n\nTown Hall, Khan Market\n\nRustom’s, Bahadur Shah Zafar Marg\n\nYeti the Himalayan Kitchen, Greater Kailash II\n\nCoast Cafe, Hauz Khas\n\nIndian Accent, Chanakyapuri\n\nThe Indian Accent is a highly acclaimed restaurant by award-winning chef Manish Mehrotra. Also, it’s often included in the list of the ‘best places to eat in the world’. The menu is known for serving traditional Indian cuisine with global ingredients and unique cooking techniques. Basically, the Indian Accent is the A.R Rahman of all the top restaurants in Delhi. No doubt about it.\n\nDum Pukht, Chanakyapuri\n\nLocated in the luxurious ITC Maurya hotel, ‘Dum Pukht’ is an oasis for the finest of the fine-dine lovers. The restaurant specializes in a 200 year old Awadhi technique of slow cooking on a low flame. Plus, the dazzling chandeliers and elegant white marble add layers to your experience here. The only thing not elegant about this place is their name (unless you stop reading it like that? *facepalm*)\n\nMasala House, Sundar Nagar\n\nOne of the best fine dining restaurants in Delhi, the Masala house features modern Indian cuisines. Though mostly around North Indian, Kerala and Tamil Nadu’s Chettinad region. Also, the decor inside this place is nothing extravagant, but carefully designed to please all your five senses. Basically, they really put the ‘Sundar’ in Sundar Nagar, don’t they?\n\nUnited Coffee House, Connaught Place\n\nUnited Coffee House is a 75 year old vintage restaurant in Connaught Place. The diverse menu walks you through the many eras this place has witnessed. Like you’ll find a lot of authentic British food served here. That too with servers always willing to share a little bit of history of this place with you. Also, the restaurant has the most elegant decor. Just enough to make you anxious about dropping their cutlery.\n\nGulati, Pandora Road\n\nThe Gulati is an iconic restaurant in Delhi. And for good reasons. Actually, just one. They make the best butter chicken in Delhi. Tough thing to pull off as almost anybody in North India can claim to serve the best butter chicken, no? Yes. But they legit won an award for the same. So unless it was presented by your class teacher, no one’s complaining.\n\nPlum by Bent Chair, Aerocity\n\nThe Plum is often said to be the most Instagrammable restaurant in India. The decor is gorgeous with loads – we mean – LOADS of creative decorables. From the cutlery to the wall art, from the furniture to the food. Also, you can buy a lot of their decorables on the spot. Basically, if Pinterest was a restaurant, this would be exactly it.\n\nOlive Bar and Kitchen, Mehrauli\n\nOlive Bar and Kitchen is one of the more famous restaurants in Delhi. Perfect for a Sunday brunch, you can enjoy their fine Mediterranean cuisine along with some sparkling wine. Or if you’re underage, their signature Milano Smooch. Also, they’re housed in a renovated Mughal mansion with a view of the Qutub Minar. So if you wanna hop on a time machine and experience Mehrauli, this is the place for you.\n\nSagar Ratna, New Defence Colony\n\nIf you’re looking for South Indian restaurants in Delhi, then look no further than the Sagar Ratna. It’s now a chain spread all over the city with the original one located in New Defence Colony. Also, we recommend ordering their South Indian coffee. Served in an old-school steel glass, it’ll remind you of your dad’s morning routine with a newspaper and chai.\n\nThe Grammar Room, Kalka Das Marg\n\nThe Grammar Room looks more sophisticated than Daniel Craig in, well, everything he does. The menu serves some of the most aesthetically pleasing yet healthy breakfasts in town. Plus, the mocktails are super refreshing too. And nope, you’ll not find any grammar nazis getting on your nerves at this place. Only helpful staff who’ll politely guide you through the complex menu.\n\nGuppy, Lodhi Colony\n\nThe Guppy is a sought after name in the culinary world. Thanks to their constant pursuit of reinventing Japanese food. Our personal recommendation would be ordering their sashimi platters, the gyoza, and of course, the ramen bowls. Frankly, the ramen is so tasty, the Guppy will seem like the real-life version of Naruto’s favourite ramen joint in the hidden leaf village.\n\nBo Tai, Kalka Das Marg\n\nBo Tai is easily one of the best Thai rooftop restaurants in Delhi. Although you might think they have a Thai name, it actually does refer to a bow-tie. Everything from their napkins to their table accessories have metal bow-ties attached to them. Now, we don’t know much about bow-ties, but if the servers (wearing bow-ties too) look like a bunch of Justin Timberlakes giving us food, then we ain’t complaining.\n\nTown Hall, Khan Market\n\nThe Town Hall is chef Augusto Cabrera’s brainchild. The renowned chef was kinda the first one to introduce the concept of sushi to Delhites back in 2014. So if you wanna try good sashimi, sushi or yakitori, then this is where you go. The prices are a bit on the expensive side, but it’s in Khan market, folks. So no surprises there.\n\nRustom’s, Bahadur Shah Zafar Marg\n\nIf you’re in the mood to introduce yourself to good Parsi food, then you should head to Rustom’s. You should try their berry pulao with homemade raspberry soda. Pretty soon, it’ll be your second favorite thing named Rustom, followed closely by Dr. Rustom from Munnabhai MBBS. Ok, no relation. But we still wanted to point that out.\n\nYeti the Himalayan Kitchen, Greater Kailash II\n\nOne place where you can experience authentic Nepalese, Tibetan, and Himalayan cuisine is The Yeti. And like any other Himalayan restaurant, the place is a heaven for meat lovers. Just try ordering their Cheley (fried buff offals), and Dopa Khatsa (goat maws). Given your Himalayan bike trip isn’t happening anytime soon (cuz pandemic!), you can do a more ‘bite-sized’ trip to the mountains from right here.\n\nCoast Cafe, Hauz Khas\n\nFew places can serve lip-smacking Mexican food like the Coast Cafe. Located in the midst of Hauz Khas, this restro-cafe definitely holds its own in HKV’s competitive market. The decor is fresh and clean with loads of natural light filtering through its large windows. So before you even realise, you’ll be defending this restaurant against your bestie’s choice for another. Or should we say, you’ll soon gonna turn into a – wait for it – ‘coast’ guard. Ok. Sorry. Bye.\n\nFAQs on Restaurants in Delhi"
