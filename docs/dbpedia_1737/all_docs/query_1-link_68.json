        "text": "Above you, a rich spread of stars twinkling in the night sky. Under you, the softcover of green grass. Ahead of you, the gentle curves of hills rising and falling. All while the wind whispers to you in gentle murmurs and the houses on the hills are illuminated with the warm glow of lights. This is Shimla tourism in a nutshell – an abundance of beauty wherever you look.\n\nThe city of Shimla is spread across the northern parts of the foothills of the Himalayas. The pristine pine trees owe their existence to the high-altitude of 2100 metres above sea level.\n\nShimla Tourism: A Quick Overview Currency Indian Rupee (INR) Population 1.7 lakhs Time Zone GMT +5:30 (IST) Area 35.34 Sq. Kms. State Himachal Pradesh Dial Code 0177 Location The Sevem Hills of Shimla Official Language Hindi\n\nHighlights of Shimla\n\nNature and Camping In Shimla\n\nWouldn’t you love to watch the sunset with a steaming cup of chaai and the mountains for the company? Well then, we have the perfect spot for you! Or perhaps you prefer a holiday with more excitement and would prefer to climb and conquer these undulating hills? If you are a beginner and don’t really have much time, you could go on a trek to the Dhanu Devta temples. These three temples are in the southern slopes of the city. You could start from the Mall Road and go downwards to the High Court passing through Bemloe. If you want a challenge, Tara Devi temple is the place to go. You will have to take a bus to Tara Devi from Shimla and then make your way uphill for four kms, wandering through the forest paths. If you want to sleep under the stars and contemplate life; you could always go for outdoor accommodation rather than taking the mainstream hotel arrangement. There are several camping sites in Shimla that offer you an enchanting view of the green hills around you. Head to Shogi, Sarahan, Sandasu and Chirgaon. The best time to go camping would be from December to February.\n\nCuisine Of Shimla\n\nShimla has food for the soul with its piping, hot delicacies. Dive into the local cuisine and try its famous food, Madra originating from the Chamba district of Himachal Pradesh. This dish comprises soaked chickpeas or veggies, turmeric, a dash of cinnamon garnished with some spices. You must also try Thukpa which is a noodle soup of Tibetan origin. This is the one dish that parents will never stop their children from having since it has the nutrition of all veggies as well as protein. It can be prepared as both vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes. If you are a meat lover, you must try the Himachal delicacy Chha Gosht comprising flavoured meat, yoghurt, garnished with coriander and spices. If you are missing home and craving maa ki dal then do have maash dal made with black lentils. Ginger, garlic and mustard are added for some seasoning.\n\nShop and explore At Shimla\n\nIn sharp contrast to the tranquil hills that surround Shimla, the bustling Mall Road lies at the heart of the city. With theatres, shops and food joints, Mall Road is one of the many famous places to visit in Shimla. However, the theatres here are a tad bit different from the ones we are used to. The Gaiety theatre hosts many cultural activities and events. This road also offers a wide range of Himachali handicrafts and souvenirs to take back home. You could also visit the Tibetan Market and put your bargaining skills to test. Mufflers, scarves and gloves to keep yourself warm and some Tibetan rugs to accessorise your home are available at reasonable prices. You will also find some antiques as you wander further into these crowded lanes. If you want an escape from the chaos of this popular tourist spot, then you must head to Kufri. Thirteen kilometres away from Shimla, this hill station is colder, calmer and bathed in sheets of snow in the winter.\n\nAdventure sports In Shimla\n\nThe open-air ice-skating rink is the only natural ice-skating rink in Southeast Asia. You try this activity during the winter since the temperature during this time prevents it from melting and cracking under pressure. As you explore Shimla, discover the adventure enthusiast in you too! If you want to try your hand at rafting, then you must go to Tattapani, situated fifty kilometres from Shimla. The jacuzzi-like, hot water springs and green valleys make Tattapani the most preferred site for the ideal rafting experience. Skiing is one of the most popular activities to do in the city. Speed your way amidst the snowy slopes! If you do lose balance and fall, the thick sheets of snow will make sure you don’t hurt yourself!\n\nBest time to visit Shimla\n\nIf you are an adventure enthusiast and want to head out and participate in some outdoor activities, then you must go during the months of March to June. The weather is agreeable and suitable to try paragliding, trekking and rafting. However, if you are looking for some relief from the abundance of tourism in Shimla, you could attempt a trip between July to September. Be advised though that the area receives heavy rainfalls and the threat of landslides, so do proceed with caution. Once the season is done, the rainfall does leave behind some lush greenery to marvel at. If snow is what you’re after – fighting with it, making snow angels, letting the flakes flutter onto your skin – then do visit during the months of October to February!\n\nHow to Reach Shimla\n\nBy Road: Being one of the most accessible and most frequented hill stations by the tourists, Shimla is well connected with all the major cities in the north.

Wanting to create a shelter amidst the dense forests of the hill station, the Assistant Political Agtates - Lieutenant Ross - built a wooden British residence. It soon became a refuge for the women from the heat in the plains and a hangout or resting spot for the British soldiers after the Gurkha war. Soon enough more homes were built, and Shimla became a rejuvenation spot for the British. Since the Britishers were in such awe of this city, it became the summer capital in 1864. Later, it was made the capital of Punjab, post-Independence. Today, Shimla is the capital of Himachal Pradesh.\n\nInteresting facts about Shimla\n\nShimla has the only natural ice-skating rink in the whole of Southeast Asia since it was founded by a Britisher.
