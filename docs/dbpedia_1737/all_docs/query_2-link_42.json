        "text": "Stalking the ghosts of the British raj is probably nowhere more rewarding than in the Himalayan hill stations of northern India, those outposts of rural England, complete with timbered houses, parish churches and flower gardens that were created as refuges from the subcontinent's searing summer heat. The queen of them all was Simla, for more than a century the summer capital of British India. Spread over a series of steep hills 6,000 to 8,000 feet high and accessible at first only by a grueling trek of many days on horseback or sedan chair from the edge of the plain, Simla - still not exactly easy to get to - stands as testimony to the audacity if not the absurdity of the British empire in India.\n\n''Isn't it strange to dine in silk stockings in such a place, to drink a bottle of Rhine wine and another of champagne every evening,'' the French naturalist Victor Jacquemont said after visiting Simla in 1831. The altitude, he said approvingly, seemed to enhance the flavor of a truffled pate of hare from Perigord.\n\nSimla is now the capital of Himachal Pradesh, one of India's Himalayan states and a favorite resort of Indians from New Delhi and beyond. But from Christ Church on the Ridge to the Viceregal Lodge on Summer Hill to the deep bathtubs at Clarkes Hotel or the dahlias and roses at Wildflower Hall, the memories of another age live on.\n\nSimla (pronounced SHIM-lah by most Indians) first attracted the attention of the British when, in 1815, forces were sent to put down gurkhas who had been fortifying a number of hills. By the 1830's summer homes had begun to change the landscape. In the 1860's the viceroy, Sir John Lawerence, made the annual migration official, and Simla became the summer headquarters of the supreme government in India.\n\nToday's visitor can find in Simla a welcome break from the dust and heat of much of India. Because of its attraction to Indian tourists and its size (more than 100,000 people) and importance as a state capital and the headquarters of the Indian army's western command, Simla has 2,000 hotel rooms and is accessible all year round by car, bus and narrow-gauge railway. Astride the old Hindustan-Tibet Road, it serves as a comfortable base for exploring other, smaller hill stations in the area. To the southeast is Chail, where, legend has it, a maharaja who was banished from Simla for attempting to abscond with a viceroy's daughter set up a town to rival it. His summer house is now the Palace Hotel, and for $40 a night one can sleep in his suite.\n\nFarther south is Kasauli, the hill station closest to the Punjabi Plain, a spot favored for summer homes by a number of noted Indians. North and west of Simla, toward the higher Himalayas, are the ski runs at Kufri and Narkanda. A longer journey north and west - requiring at least a day on the road -brings the visitor to the high mountain valley towns of Kulu, Manali, Palampur and Dharamsala, where the exiled Dalai Lama holds court.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
