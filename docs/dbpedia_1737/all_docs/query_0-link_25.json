At this point, Kaiju No. 9 stirs, with the No. 2 head still protruding from its body.\n\nAs Kafka and Mina prepare for battle, Mina thanks Kafka for being by her side.\n\nKafka realizes that standing by Mina is the one childhood dream he can still fulfill.\n\nThe two promise to exterminate the Kaiju together.\n\nThe chapter ends with a poignant panel of their childhood selves before returning to the present, where their adult selves are ready to face Kaiju No. 9.\n\nSpeculations for Kaiju No. 8 Chapter 110\n\nFollowing Mina and Kafka’s resolute decision to fight and defeat No. 9, fans are on the edge of their seats, eager to see the next significant development in this climactic battle.\n\nThe upcoming chapter is likely to set the stage for the final act of the fight, highlighting the teamwork and strategies that Mina and Kafka will employ against No. 9.\n\nHowever, it’s also possible that Kaiju No. 9 has more tricks up its sleeve, which could be unveiled in chapter 110 and subsequent chapters.\n\nThis unpredictability makes it challenging to determine who might gain the upper hand next in the battle.\n\nFinal Words\n\nAs Kaiju No. 8 chapter 110 approaches, the excitement among fans is palpable.\n\nWith a release date set for July 5, 2024, at 12 AM JST, readers across the globe are gearing up to witness the next phase of Kafka and Mina’s epic confrontation with Kaiju No. 9.\n\nWhile specific details about the upcoming chapter remain under wraps, the anticipation and speculation only add to the thrill of the unfolding story.\n\nFans can look forward to reading the new chapter on official platforms like Viz Media, MANGA Plus, and the Shonen Jump+ app.\n\nWhether it’s through the emotional flashbacks or the intense present-day battles, Kaiju No. 8 continues to captivate its audience with its blend of action, character development, and storytelling.\n\nAs we wait for chapter 110, the promise of an exhilarating showdown keeps the excitement alive."
