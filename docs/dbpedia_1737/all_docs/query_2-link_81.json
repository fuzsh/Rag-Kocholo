This spiritual institution is part of the Gaudiya-Vaishnava denomination of Hinduism. Interestingly, even though the Hindu culture believes in polytheism (the presences of innumerable gods), Gaudiya-Vaishnava is monotheistic. It primarily believes in worshipping the deity of Krishna. The context is derived from the Bhagavad Gita, accorded the place of scriptures, which was written in Sanskrit many centuries ago.\n\nThe ISKCON brand was founded by A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada in July 1966 in New York City. The Krishna Consciousness Movement took off, and over a few decades, 108 ISKCON temples sprang up across the world while Srila Prabhupada still lived. In his days, this movement had gathered about 10,000 followers worldwide.\n\nHistory Behind the ISKCON Temple\n\nEven though the ISKCON movement is much older, the temple in Delhi opened many years later, on the 5th of April in 1998.
