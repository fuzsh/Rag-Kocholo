We view the Red Fort from the outside and Jami Masjid Mosque, built by Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan and one of the biggest in India.\n\nOvernight stay at Hotel\n\nSun 15 Oct 23 - Delhi\n\nThis morning we will visit the more modern part of the city, New Delhi. The Indian capital has long been a phoenix rising again and again out of its own ruins. New Delhi was the creation of the British Raj of the 1930s. On our tour, we will view the Lok Sabha (Parliament), India Gate, and the Rajpath buildings. We will also explore the Qutub Minar and Humayun's Tomb, set in peaceful gardens away from the often chaotic Delhi traffic.\n\nAfternoon Free\n\nOvernight stay at Hotel\n\nMon 16 Oct 23 - Delhi to Agra by surface (Approx. 210 Kms, 4 Hrs)\n\nAfter breakfast check out from Hotel an drive from Delhi to Agra medieval city on the banks of the Yamuna River. It was founded by Sultan Sikandar Lodi in the year 1506. Agra achieved fame as the capital of the Mughal emperors from 1526 to 1658 and remains a major tourist destination because of its many splendid Mughal-era buildings. Most notably the Taj Mahal, Agra Fort and Fatehpur Sikri, all three of which are UNESCO World Heritage Sites\n\nUpon arrival at Agra, check in at Hotel\n\nRest of the day at leisure and Overnight stay at Hotel\n\nTue 17 Oct 23 - Agra\n\nThis morning's early start is rewarded with the spectacular sight of the sun rising over the Taj Mahal during our visit. Over 300 years have elapsed since the construction of what is arguably the worlds most perfect and poetic building, yet its beauty and symmetry seem unscarred by age. Created by Shah Jahan as a funerary monument to his favourite wife, Mumtaz, it took 22 years to build. The Great Mosul lies beside his beloved under the white marble dome. After our visit, we will return to the hotel for breakfast and some downtime. Later in the morning, we will visit the imposing Agra Fort and the Itimad-ud-Daulah or 'Baby Taj'. Either side of the river, the grandeur of these two impressive sites either side of the Yamuna river explains why Agra was the first capital of the Mughal Empire. In-between both visits we will have some time to stop for lunch and potentially try some local delicacies such as petha (a dry dessert) or paan (a betel leaf which you chew). To finish our sightseeing in Agra we will head over to te Mehtab Bagh, a park offering a different perspective of the gleaming Taj Mahal with the Yamuna river in the foreground.\n\nOvernight stay at Hotel\n\nWed 18 Oct 23 - Agra to Kalakho by surface (Approx. 265 Kms, 6 hrs)\n\nEarly this morning, we continue our journey west and soon reach the deserted city of Fatehpur Sikri. Founded in 1569 and abandoned scarcely 16 years later, it is a perfectly intact example of Akbar'simperial court. Among the many noteworthy buildings is the five-storied Panch Mahal, probably a pleasure pavilion for the ladies of the harem. In the centre of the courtyard is the Pachisi Board, where the emperor played a game like chess, with dancing slave girls as pieces. Perhaps the finest structure of all though is the lotus-shaped carved central pillar of the Diwan-i-Khas (Hall of Private Audience). Leaving Fatehpur Sikri we will drive towards the city Jaipur stopping en route at the Chand Baoristepwell. (Without guide) Built over a thousand years ago, the stepwell is the equivalent of a modern day water storage unit built to provide water to the area all year round. The stepwell is today not used for these purposes but our stop here will allow us to marvel at the structure and its perfect symmetry with hundreds of slanted steps leading to the water on each side. Then we'll make our way to Kalakho, a small town with more of a rural feel. Our family-run heritage hotel is an accommodation highlight here, encouraging us to feel like we have stepped back in time to the days of the Raj. The rest of the day is left free to relax in the gardens, watch the sunset from the terrace and then join the family for an evening prayer ceremony at the small temple in the grounds.\n\nThu 19 Oct 23 - Explore an organic veg garden before driving to Jaipur\n\nVisit the phenomenal observatory and City Palace\n\nWe have a relaxed start to the morning. There is a chance to take a walk through the organic gardens, hearing from the family what's in season and the favourite dishes that are made with the freshest ingredients. Alternatively make the most of the heritage-style rooms and enjoy a lie in! Saying goodbye to our hosts we take the 2 hour drive to Jaipur. Often known as the 'Pink City', Jaipur was first painted terracotta pink by Maharaja Sawai Ram Singh to celebrate the visit of Prince Albert in 1853. On arrival we will visit the extraordinary Jantar Mantar - a star-gazing observatory built by JaiSingh, the great Maharaja- astronomer. Before checking in to our hotel we will also visit the nearby lavish and well-preserved city palace. Here, we will find a fine collection of textiles, costumes and armory.\n\nFri 20 Oct 23 - Jaipur\n\nToday we will visit the Palace of the Winds, a five-storied facade built around 1760, which features onmany an India postcard. Afterwards, we will drive to the Amber Fort. This impressive hilltop fortresspossesses what must be the world's finest Chamber of Mirrors and affords glorious views of thesurrounding plains. As we return back to our hotel for a free afternoon in Jaipur, we will get theopportunity to stop and view the Jal Mahal palace. Meaning 'water palace', as its name indicates thesandstone palace sits in the middle of the Man Sagar Lake and is a great photographic opportunity.This afternoon has been left free toexploremore of Jaipur in your own time. You may choose to visitone of the famous bazaars which are bursting with delights, from marble statues to antique textiles;traditional print blocks to local musical instruments. In the evening you may be able to take in afamous Bollywood movie at the Raj Mandir cinema, an art deco style cinema where the locals cheeron their favourite movie stars.\n\nSat 21 Oct 23 - Drive Back to Delhi via The Heritage Transport Museum\n\n(Closed on Monday)\n\nAfter breakfast we start our return journey to the capital from Jaipur, a journey of approximately six to seven hours without stops. A couple of hours outside of Delhi we will stop at India's Heritage transport museum. This building offers a fascinating journey through the country's many transport methods from the pre mechanised era including wooden carriages and bullock carts to a classic selection of over 75 vintage cars and motorbikes. The museum also has several interactive screens with videos on the different transport methods on display. We will also get the chance to view the documentary movie 'Living in the age of airplanes'. After visiting the museum we will drive to Delhi for an Overnight stay\n\nSun 22 Oct 23 - Delhi to Kalka by train Shatabadi Express: 0740- 1145 Hrs\n\nKalka to Kandaghat by surface\n\nKandaghat to Shimla by toy train: 1521 1730 Hrs\n\nEarly morning our representative meet you at Hotel lobby and transfer to New Delhi railway station in time to\n\nboard train for Kalka.\n\n1145 Hrs: Arrive at Kalka\n\nUpon arrival meet & assist at the railway station and drive to Kandaghat railway station in time to board the toy train to Shimla (non air-conditioned) Toy train offers the charm of old-world travel amidst lofty pines and lush green, misty mountains. Laid out on a 96 km long narrow gauge track that passes through 103 tunnels and across more than 800 bridges and viaducts, it is one of the most beautiful hill railways in India. It was considered the crown jewel of the Indian National Railways during British times.\n\n1730 Hrs: Arrive at Shimla\n\nUpon arrival meet & assist at the railway station and transfer to Hotel Shimla. The ambiance of this hill city attracted the British so much that it seemed justifiable to shift the complete administration of an Empire from Calcutta to Shimla every summer because of its colonial charm, - and cooler air.\n\nOvernight stay at Hotel\n\nMon 23 Oct 23 - Shimla\n\nAfter breakfast Heritage Walk of Shimla. This soft walk will commence at the Mall and will end near Cecil Hotel en-route admiring the important buildings constructed during the days of the British Raj.
