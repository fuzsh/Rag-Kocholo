Gaining an edge over the monster with the help of Kikoru's revelations, they initially steered clear of any major damage. However, No. 9 still effectively turned out to be the more powerful entity in this confrontation. As Reno and Iharu couldn't handle his blows anymore, Kafka's last-minute entry saved the day as he emerged as their knight in shining armour.\n\nEncountering a mightier enemy, No. 9 unleashed all its fury. Despite harnessing the full extent of his powers, No. 9 succumbed to Kafka's blows. Although he emerged as the champion in this fight, Kafka bore the brunt of the cuts once the Defense Force witnessed his Kaiju transformation.\n\nIn the upcoming episode, Kafka will be pushed to the edge, with his abilities tested to the limit, as he faces off against Vice-Caption Hoshina."
