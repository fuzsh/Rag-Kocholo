        "text": "This post collects most of my encounters with Terence Blanchard, who recently added to his formidable c.v. the Artistic Director position at SFJazz. The announcement came a few months after the Metropolitan Opera staged his opera, Fire Shut Up In My Bones, following its 2021 staging of Champion. In the meantime, Blanchard has continued to add to his film scoring credits, recently played a weekend retrospective of his jazz activity at Jazz at Lincoln Center, and spent a good chunk of summer 2023 on tour with Herbie Hancock. You can read all about the maestro’s current activities elsewhere, but this omnibus post — with the transcript of a 1995 WKCR Musician Show, a 1997 DB Blindfold Test, a 2001 DB cover story (and interviews for the piece with Clark Terry and Branford Marsalis), a 2015 piece for Jazziz and a 2020 piece for Jazziz — is interesting to scan. (I seem not to have a digital file of a 2009 Jazziz piece that touched on Blanchard’s excellent album Choices.)\n\n**********\n\nTerence Blanchard Interview for Jazziz– 2020:\n\nWhen I last spoke with Terence Blanchard, in 2015, I asked him to discuss the synergy between the detailed, painstaking process of composing movie soundtracks and the no-holds-barred approach to improvising he’s projected during a 38-year career as one of the world’s most esteemed jazz trumpeters and bandleaders.\n\n“My jazz background allows me to think quickly on my feet in the film world,” Blanchard responded. “A given story contains various emotional components, and you see the limitless nature of music, how one idea, one through-line, can be expressed in so many ways. Some people think it’s limiting to stay within the context of the story, but it’s actually very liberating,”\n\nTestifying to Blanchard’s ability to contextualize narrative with notes and tones is an end-of-2020 c.v. containing 100-plus film, television and theater scores. Many were commissioned by Spike Lee, beginning with Jungle Fever in 1991, and including such high-profile works as Malcolm X, Four Little Girls, Bamboozled, Inside Job, Chi-Raq, and BlacKkKlansman, for which Blanchard earned a 2019 Oscar nomination.\n\nMost recently, Lee recruited Blanchard for Da 5 Bloods, a daring, sardonic Vietnam epic that proceeds to Blanchard’s vivid symphonic canvas. Shortly after its June Netflix release, HBO aired the audaciously noirish 8-episode Perry Mason, set in Jim Crow Los Angeles at the height of the Great Depression in 1932. Blanchard conjured a novelistic score to propel and signify on the twists and turns of a multi-layered narrative that features the title character as a PTSD-afflicted World War I survivor, reimagines his colleague Della Street as queer, and morphs his chief investigator Paul Drake into a Black man.\n\nAdd to Blanchard’s 2020 credits two directorial debuts: Bruised, by Halle Berry, who plays the lead as a traumatized boxer; and A Night In Miami, by 2019 Best Supporting Actress Oscar winner Regina King, a well-acted ensemble piece portraying the course of a 1964 encounter between Malcolm X, Muhammad Ali Jim Brown and Sam Cooke in Malcolm’s motel room after Ali – then Cassius Clay – won the heavyweight championship of the world.\n\n“I love the grandness, the emotional quality of Terence’s scores,” says Kasi Lemmons, who commissioned her fourth on the 2019 release Harriet, in which, under Lemmons’ direction, Anglo-Nigerian actress Cynthia Arivo inhabits Harriet Tubman’s persona. Lemmons concurrently wrote the libretto for Blanchard’s second opera, The Fire That Burns Within, initially staged by the St. Louis Opera in 2018, which is scheduled to open the Metropolitan Opera’s 2021-22 season.\n\n“Terence elevates whatever you’re trying to work on,” Lemmons says. “I told him that this was my version of a superhero movie, and that the soul and driving momentum of Nina Simone’s ‘Sinner Man’ felt very appropriate. I talked to him about ancestors. He understood it, like he always does. He nailed it.”\n\nPerry Mason’s Executive Producer and primary director, Tim Van Patten — who served that same function for four seasons of Boardwalk Empire after directing 20 episodes of The Sopranos — was similarly enthusiastic about Blanchard’s intuitive mojo. “Terence was completely dialed-in to the tone of this show — the narratives and identified themes,” Van Patten, says. “I’d give him a few notes and say, ‘Go for it.’ I felt no ego at all. He created a forensic arc, where you could track the characters through his music within the eight hours. He did what we call end title scores that commented emotionally on each individual episode and gave a nod to the next episode. That’s complicated stuff, and it’s a lot of writing. I’ve never come across that before. It blew my mind. I was in the hands of a master.”\n\n**********************\n\nTERENCE BLANCHARD: Tim told me, “We have to think of it like a long film with eight chapters.” The music had to take you on that journey as the episodes evolved. I didn’t want to do period music, which I thought would be too on the nose. Instead, I used elements from the early 1930s and tried to make them more contemporary. They found great locations, created a great look, the acting was amazing — everything was on point. All the emotional content was right on the screen. My job was to enhance it; there was no need to push any buttons or go deeper into anything.\n\nJAZZIZ: Perry Mason isn’t a “Black” show, quote-unquote. It’s not associated with a Black director or an African-American theme.\n\nTB: People probably think a Black composer may not be right for that project. That couldn’t be further from the truth. It’s such a daring approach to a remake of Perry Mason — it was logical to try something daring for the music in post-production.\n\nHow long did it take to write the score?\n\nTB: I started before Covid. It affected how we could record. For one thing, I probably would have had a big band, but instead I used five saxophones, string quartet, piano, bass, drums and myself. Normally we’d have a bunch of musicians play together in the room, the engineer mixes it and then sends it off. Instead, everybody did everything individually. We’d send their parts to an editor, who put them in ProTools and made sure everything lined up. Then we’d send that to a mixer. It was pretty arduous.\n\nIn distinction to your other recent soundtracks, you play a fair amount of trumpet.\n\nTB: Yes, on every episode I’m playing someplace. That wasn’t at all what I set out to do. But Covid limited the number of musicians I could use at a session, and I couldn’t be in the room with someone else if a lead instrument was needed – so I felt it was up to me to be lead voice.\n\nA very different ambiance than One Night in Miami.\n\nTB: Initially I gave Regina King some Latin-based and blues-based demos. But she kept coming back to bluesy, jazz-based solo piano with a gospel influence. I immediately thought Benny Green would be perfect, and sent him thematic ideas. Once Regina started to hear where I was going, we got into more detail about what the piano should do improvisationally during specific scenes. There is the main theme. There is the Malcolm X theme that starts off when he’s praying, where I introduce the duduk. The main theme winds up being a more playful thing for Cassius Clay. With Jim Brown, it’s introspective; with Sam Cooke it’s fun-loving. There are a couple of other transitional groove-based things. I also generated some atmospheric stuff, and there’s a song in the front that I wrote with Tank and the Bangas and Keb Mo, the great blues guitarist, that Jim Brown listens to while he’s driving through Georgia. But the main focus of the score is piano.\n\nI love that the film portrays these four African-American men expressing various modes of thinking that we experience in our community that are all very valid. In my mind, the score is another character — a character of unity, like the conscience of the characters. It’s right there with all the action, but it isn’t underscoring everything. It’s not trying to make huge statements. It’s another tone.\n\nIt’s a different sonic approach from Bruised, where I use a lot of atmospheric tones, but most of the score is centered around cello, played by Malcolm Parsons, who is part of the Turtle Island String Quartet. I recently recorded an album of Wayne Shorter’s music with them and the E-Collective — we’re still trying to figure out how to release it. Since we couldn’t be in a studio, I sent things to Malcolm, he’d record and send them back. I’d mix them into my session with everything else I had going on — rhythmic, sonic, harmonic — and send to Halle for critiques. It’s a brooding score, because Halle’s character is struggling through some dark elements to find herself on the other side of what she’s going through in her life. It’s very powerful.\n\nFor Da 5 Bloods you used a 90-piece orchestra, as you’d done some years before on Spike Lee’s Miracle of Saint Anna. Talk about your process.\n\nTB: It was like working on anything Spike sends my way. First I step back a second, because I’m captivated by what I’m watching. With 90 pieces, you have room to shape colors and tones that can constantly evolve and grow, and then diminish, and then grow again. At the beginning of the session, with 90 people sitting in front of you, there’s always this nerve-wracking moment, hoping that all the music is right. But then you get the incredible experience of feeling the power of 90 people play something you’ve written. By the way, young African-American musicians came from all over to be part of that session — some from Canada, some from New York, some from Mexico.\n\nSpike uses source music to cover the period and location, so I never have to worry about that, even though I may use some of those elements in the score. Here, the songs from Marvin Gaye’s What’s Going On made total sense. I was thinking: How do I make this a grand story? How do I rise to the occasion? That opening sequence, where the helicopter is shot down, has so much information, it took me five days to score it — three days to plot it out on piano, the next few days to orchestrate it. That set the tone for the rest of the film. My job is to connect the audience to the characters themselves. For example, for the theme with Clarke Peters (Otis) and the woman he had the child with, Tiên, I bring in the duduk. The music shows Otis’ softer side — and actually a bit of his comedic side — when he sees the young girl and starts to drink the wine. Even though Tiên hasn’t said anything, we know what’s going on as soon as the girl walks into the frame.\n\nHow did Kasi Lemmons present Harriet to you?\n\nTB: That she saw Harriet Tubman as a superhero, that it wasn’t a slave film — only in the first five minutes does Harriet deal with slavery in the form we normally see. The rest is about Harriet’s journey, how she became this incredibly strong woman on a mission to save all these souls. The first scene where she crosses the river is the one that informed me what the film should be.\n\nEveryone on Harriet felt we had to do 110%. During the shooting, whenever someone got weak or tired, we’d think: Harriet Tubman was a diminutive woman but her energy and spirit was boundless. We kept that in front of us as motivation. No one talked about anything extraneous. It was: “What are we going to do for Harriet?” People probably will refer to this film for many years. It may be used in classrooms to teach about Harriet Tubman. When you think about it on that scale, you can freak out a bit. The last time that happened to me was when I did Malcolm X for Spike. Everybody was a little nervous. Wynn Thomas [cinematographer] told me: “Look, we all want to do 150%, but if we want to do that, the best thing is to do our jobs.” That calmed me down. I thought about it during Harriet: “Ok, let me do what I have been doing and focus on helping tell the story.”\n\nKasi Lemmons also wrote the libretto for your second opera, Fire Shut Up In My Bones, adapted from Charles Blow’s memoir.\n\nKasi told me she loved opera when I first worked with her on Eve’s Bayou; we talked about this opera when we spoke about Harriet. I’ve always loved her writing, and I knew she’d write something fantastic. Opera Theater of St. Louis brought Charles, Kasi and myself to St. Louis for a meeting. Kasi followed Charles everywhere, like a super-sleuth investigator, asking questions. So I knew she’d come up with ideas. When she started creating the imagery with Jim Robinson, the director, it set me thinking what I might do for the different characters. Now that it’s going to the Metropolitan Opera, we’ll meet again to make changes and develop some of the characters.\n\nI’ve seen clips on Youtube that show a demotic, vernacular libretto. Does the score mirror that?\n\nTB: No, I wouldn’t say that. My composition teacher, Roger Dickerson, told me years ago that my respective experiences as a jazz musician and a film composer will probably come together in a way that I couldn’t yet envision. He said: “You should think about how to notate some of those things you do in jazz for the orchestra.”\n\nThat’s what I thought about when it came time to write Fire Shut Up In My Bones. I tried to draw upon all my experiences as a musician — from jazz, from orchestras, from teaching — to hopefully create something a little different in the opera world. I thought about Benny Golson. I thought about all the great jazz artists who have come before me. I thought about some of the great classical voices I’ve heard. And I tried to write something that would have the flow of a jazz composition and the strong melodic content of great Classical American music. Puccini’s La Boheme is one of my favorite operas, and one thing that blows my mind every time I listen to it (which happens in old American musicals, too) is how the melody develops like the words do. How they’re so intertwined. I didn’t want my opera to sound like I was jerking off just to try to make a musical point. I wanted to marry the development of the melodic line to the emotional development of the words being sung. That’s more important to me than anything.\n\nIs your process for opera and film similar or different?\n\nTB: With opera, I might sit at the piano for a day, trying to find a rhythm that makes sense for a couple of lines. On films I have less time to flesh those things out. I’m sitting at my keyboard, surrounded by all my other colors and instruments.\n\nMost of your development as a composer was not the product of formal study at an institution of higher learning. You were a working musician when you attended Rutgers.\n\nTB: During high school, I studied with Dr. Bert Braud at New Orleans Center for Creative Arts, and then privately with Roger Dickerson. Both are brilliant and taught me all my techniques without opening a book. They gave me the rules and wrote out the lessons in a notebook. Roger was so adept at knowing what I needed to hear, what I needed to work on.\n\nWhen we did my first opera, Champion in Washington D.C., I flew out Roger and his wife. The second night, we went to dinner with friends; one of them asked him really intricate questions. Roger started out saying, “You know, four-bar phrases are the death knell of creativity.” I went, “Damn, I thought that was my idea.” Every time he said something I’d think, “Wow, I thought that was mine, too.” So I started to realize how much this guy influenced my life. He helped shape my thinking in all areas. Later, I read Paul Hindemith’s The Craft of Musical Composition, and found that everything Roger taught me was in that book! Roger said: “You were a kid, just 16 years old. So I figured out ways to give you the same information.”\n\nIn past conversations, you’ve described learning to play jazz by listening to one thing in granular detail, rather than studying a lot of different things. Was this your process in becoming a film composer?\n\nTB: The exact same thing. Denzel Washington took me to the premiere of Glory. Then I got the soundtrack, listened to it over and over, and started to break it down into core elements. Once I got one thing, I’d move on to another. Then I became a big fan of Thomas Newman’s score to Shawshank Redemption, and did the same thing. I listened over and over to the cue from the scene where James Whitmore hung himself. It’s simplistic, but very beautiful.\n\nI’m that nerd, man. My kids and my wife laugh at me. Even when I’m not working, if I’m not practicing or watching sports, I’m online reading about gear, or reading about processes, or reading about something – trying to learn and get better. I don’t have a team of people like some others do. It’s just me. So I need to constantly fine-tune. Years ago, I saw a Magic Johnson interview where he said that, every off-season, he tried to add something to his game. I try to do that as a musician. After I finish Bruised, I’m going to get back into practicing. Because of Covid, I don’t have any performances. So I’ll have time to sit down and focus on some things. I’m excited.\n\nYou played piano before you were serious about the trumpet. Any remarks on your piano background and the impact of your father’s musical taste and character and personality on the way you function?\n\nTB: I started playing piano when I was 5 years old, because my grandmother had a piano at the house and I’d always try to find some sounds in it. Then they started me on lessons. In my house, we heard operatic music and classical music. So my early musical upbringing was based on a classical sensibility. The jazz that I heard was Oscar Peterson and Andre Previn on the Tonight Show or some televised production.\n\nMy father was an insurance salesman. He was great with numbers, and would play little math games with me. He loved music, and he was a workaholic. That’s probably why I’m the way I am now. If my father wasn’t working on balancing the books from his insurance accounts, he was sitting at the piano, going through music he had to sing that weekend in church or at a performance. He was a one-finger piano player. He’d sing his part, then play the tenor part against what he’d sung, then play the alto and soprano parts. Essentially, he knew everybody’s part. I thought he was nuts. But later I realized that he had a serious passion for music. Sometimes he’d put on an opera: “Hey, hey, boy, come here; sit down, listen… Now listen to those strings. You see how the oboe comes in right there?” It’s almost like he was planting the seed within me to do opera now, without my even realizing it.\n\nI recall a remark you made that your father and Roger Dickerson and Ellis Marsalis and Alvin Batiste gave you models for successful African-American men in that particular moment.\n\nTB: Nobody had money. Nobody was living a lavish lifestyle. But that didn’t diminish their passion or love for what they were into. They were men of integrity who worked their hardest to be the best they could at whatever they were doing. When I was young, that’s just who they were to me. I didn’t know any better. When I was around Ellis or Roger, it was the same energy as being around my dad, or my Uncle Rick, who sang with my dad, or a guy at my church, Osceola Blanchet, who taught operatic music to my dad and all these other Black men in New Orleans. Or being around Kidd Jordan, who was totally different than those dudes, but just as passionate for what he did as they were for what they did. They all appreciated each other. I feel blessed that those images in early life helped shape who I am.\n\nGiven the scope of your recent activity, do you feel very conscious about your status as one of a fairly small number of Black film composers?\n\nTB: I don’t want to ever be the guy who dropped the ball. Benny Golson, Oliver Nelson, all those dudes broke their backs for me to have this opportunity — even though they did it for me inadvertently. That’s the fear when I’m standing in front of a 90-piece orchestra. I’m not going to be the guy who’s unorganized, who seems like he doesn’t know what he’s doing.\n\nI used to joke with Marcus Miller that we couldn’t be in the same room at the same time, because if the building blows up there’s two-thirds of the Black film composers gone. It’s an awful joke to tell, but it reflects the reality. And now, it’s not just about African-Americans, but also women — more people getting opportunities to score. They’re bringing different sensibilities, which is cool. I used to ask Miles Goodman about helping me learn more about film scoring, and he said: “No, I’m not going to work with you. Your weaknesses are your strengths. You’re going to bring something different to the world of film. If I teach you, you may wind up doing some similar things as I do. I don’t want that. Your uniqueness is what the film world needs.”\n\nTerence Blanchard, “Blanchard’s Groove” – Jazziz 2015:\n\nThe origin story of Breathless, Terence Blanchard’s spring Blue Note release with his new group, E-Collective, dates to 2006, when Blanchard recorded the soundtrack he’d composed for Inside Man, the Spike Lee caper film in which Denzel Washington plays a hard-boiled old-school detective. He hired drummer Oscar Seaton for the session, and dug Seaton’s mighty grooves. Seaton enjoyed the process, too, and they agreed to collaborate in the future. Around this time, Blanchard, who lives in New Orleans, where he was born and raised, had a similar conversation with bassist Donald Ramsey, an old Crescent City acquaintance.\n\nNothing happened right away. Blanchard attended to his duties as Artistic Director of the Thelonious Monk Institute and, after 2011, the Henry Mancini Institute at the University of Miami. He composed more soundtracks, two Broadway shows, an opera, and music for several albums by the working quintet — in this period, either Bryce Winston or Walter Smith on tenor saxophone, Fabian Almazan on piano and keyboards, Derrick Hodge or Joshua Crumbly on bass and Kendrick Scott or Justin Brown on drums — that had been his default basis of operations since the early 1990s. Then, last spring, Blanchard decided to commit. He asked Almazan to join a plugged-in band with Seaton, Ramsey and guitarist Charles Altura, whom he’d heard on a YouTube clip with Ambrose Akinmusire, once Blanchard’s student at the Monk Institute.\n\nDuring the summer, Blanchard, 54, wrote a batch of danceable tunes built on funk, Afro-pop and hip-hop beats, with succinct melodies and enough harmonic information to facilitate improvisational flexibility. In October he brought E-Collective to New Orleans for two days of rehearsal, and embarked on a three-and-a-half-week European tour for beta-testing and refinement. In December, he reconvened the musicians in New Orleans for the recording.\n\nIn February, Blanchard brought a modified version of E-Collective — Burniss Earl Traviss played bass; Kimberley Thompson played drums — to Russia’s Triumph of Jazz Festival for three weekend concerts at separate venues in St. Petersburg and Moscow. During the final, Sunday event, at Moscow’s International House of Music, they played five instrumentals from Breathless, among them “See Me As I Am,” a funky-yet-plaintive 9-note theme with a stomping, work song feel; “Confident Selflessness,” which refracted Afro-fusion a la[i] Joe Zawinul; and “Soldiers,” a brisk blues over a skittery New Orleans groove. It was a compelling tour de force — freewheeling, experimental, kinetic — marked by balls-out, thematically cogent solos from the front-liners.\n\nThe leader directed the flow with body language and transitional passages on laptop synth, and said his piece on a string of inflamed declamations that exploited his full-bodied command of the trumpet’s higher register and an ability to calibrate cries, shrieks and whoops precisely, sometimes unplugged, sometimes with real-time, foot-pedal-triggered processing. He danced his way through the rhythmic web in the manner of ’70s-era Miles Davis, bobbing and weaving, leaning back and bending forward, prancing left and right, forward and back.\n\nOn Breathless, Blanchard contextualizes the instrumentals with a palpable narrative arc, mirroring such recent opuses as 2007’s A Tale of God’s Will (A Requiem For Katrina) and 2009’s Choices. As on Choices, he conveys his core message via a soliloquy by Cornell West, in this case a meditation on Dr. Martin Luther King’s “prescient and prophetic” warnings on the enduring costs to America of economic inequality, racism and militarism. “You break the barrier at the highest level, break through the ceiling, even with a black man and a black woman and two impressive black children in the White House,” West intones. “But too many folks are in the basement — because they’ve never been concerned about the poor … nobody on his economic team.”\n\nUnlike its recent predecessors, Breathless features a vocalist, the New Orleans singer P.J. Morton, who opens the proceedings with an incantatory reading of Gene McDaniels’ cynical, demotic Vietnam-era lament “Compared to What,” his sweet, church-inflected tenor setting up a fierce Blanchard solo. Morton quiet-storms Hank Williams’ melancholy, posthumously issued ballad “I Ain’t Got Nothin’ But Time.” His rendering of Blanchard’s despairing lyric on “Shutting Down” oozes plaintiveness, echoed by the composer’s long, piercing wails on trumpet.\n\n[BREAK]\n\nBlanchard’s bandmates, each young enough to be his child, returned to the United States on Monday morning, but he remained behind for a Tuesday concert with the Moscow State Jazz Orchestra at Spaso House, the official residence of the U.S. Ambassador to Russia. He took time off from fine-tuning the rough mix of Breathless to meet me for lunch in the restaurant of the opulent hotel next door to the concert hall.\n\n“At the rehearsals, I told the band I wanted groove-based music, to appeal to young people and get them more interested in playing instrumental music on a high level,” Blanchard said. “But I vacillated about how far to go creatively. Should it be more like Weather Report or more R&B-based? Then I decided not even to go down that road, but let it unfold as the guys played together — let it be what it’s supposed to be.”\n\nBlanchard was asked about the match-up of his no-holds-barred attitude to improvising and the detailed, painstaking process of composing movie soundtracks. The Internet Movie Database lists 58, including 13 for Spike Lee, among them Malcolm X, Jungle Fever, Four Little Girls and When the Levees Broke: A Requiem in Four Acts. “Some people think it’s limiting to stay within the context of the story, but it’s actually very liberating,” he said. “The story contains various emotional components, and you see the limitless nature of music, how one idea, one through-line, can be expressed in so many ways. We try to tell a story throughout the entire show, not just on a particular piece. My background as a composer shows me how to develop my ideas, while keeping the content within that context. I remember watching Betty Carter, who went seamlessly from tune to tune, not even giving you a chance to blink. It involved you in her world.”\n\nThrough film, Blanchard added, “I’ve realized you’re trying to tap into a bigger purpose than the notes or the rhythm or the harmony.” He referenced aphorisms to this effect from Art Blakey, who employed him in the Jazz Messengers between 1982 and 1986 (“We’re all trying to find our grits”), and Cornel West (“We’re always trying to find our own truths”), and also paraphrased John Coltrane (“You’ve got to learn how to become in tune to the universe when you play”). A tour with Herbie Hancock about a decade ago introduced Blanchard to Buddhist practice; he meditates and chants to still his mind.\n\n“You need to remove that chatter in the brain,” he said. “‘Am I good enough to do this? Should I be here doing this? Man, look at all the records I’ve listened to.’ When you start to play, you might have an idea — a shape — of what the solo should be. You’ve got to throw that away, or someone else will play something unrelated to what’s in your mind, and you’ll be fucked. I always tell myself to try to find my voice. Think in terms of a soulful calling — trying to express an honest emotion. Let it roll. Sometimes it’s through melody. I try to make sure the melodies are free and not bound by what’s happening harmonically. Sometimes I get caught up in what the guys are playing, and I stop just to let it hang.\n\n“The cry you hear is from trying to be heard, to get my point across. When are people truly going to learn that we’re all the same? You would think in our country, where we want to talk about American exceptionalism and being the best at everything, we would be the best at race relations — and we’re not.”\n\nBlanchard attributed his embrace of a no-safety-net attitude to private lessons with composer Roger Dickerson circa 1977-78, when he transferred from a prestigious Catholic high school to spend mornings in a public high school and afternoons at the New Orleans Center for Creative Arts. His classmates included Wynton and Branford Marsalis, who would facilitate his recruitment to the Jazz Messengers, and Donald Harrison, his front-line partner in the Messengers, with whom he would form the influential Harrison-Blanchard Quintet in 1984.\n\n“Roger told me to learn to listen to the music tell you what it’s supposed to be,” Blanchard said. “When you compose, these little ideas are screaming at you; your ego is telling you it needs to be something else, that it’s not related to what you’re writing.” To reinforce this truism, Dickerson taught a concept called “If I could tell you, I would,” which he had distilled, Blanchard found out a decade later, from Arnold Schoenberg’s The Craft of Musical Composition.\n\n“I teach it wherever I go,” he continued. “I have the students manipulate those words into as many sentences as they can, to show how many permutations one can create in what appears to be a limited set of circumstances. Then I take any musical theme they have, and run it up every degree of the scale or whatever key it’s in. All the intervallic relationships change, but the melodic shape stays the same. That proves that the shape, not the intervals, is the musical idea; they can create an entire composition using only their original ideas.”\n\nMoving in the fast company provided by the Marsalis brothers and Harrison also facilitated Blanchard’s development and spurred his work ethic. “I first met them after fifth grade, and when I saw them again, those dudes were playing their behinds off,” he stated. “I knew I had a lot of work to do, but I had a passion for it. My dad had put in a fake bar with lights that turned when you turned on the record player in it, and weekends, instead of going out, I’d sit home and play my Miles Davis records. I’d listen to one track over and over, first listening to the trumpet, then the saxophone, then the bass — trying to figure out what is jazz. But all of us were driven. Wynton and I made a pact that if we ever caught each other doing some bullshit, we needed to call each other on it.”\n\nBlanchard also cited the active influence of a cohort of African-American male role models, not least his father, Joseph Oliver, who sold insurance and sang opera locally. “Dad would practice his pieces at the piano, and when he finished, he’d balance his books on an adding machine on a cardboard table,” Blanchard said. “At NOCCA, Ellis Marsalis constantly talked about practicing and how much he had to work. He and Kidd Jordan and Alvin Batiste and Roger were my benchmark for being a successful African-American man in this country. They weren’t making money or getting stardom. They were serious about their craft because they loved it. That’s my orientation. I work hard at this stuff for no other reason than the mere fact that I love it.”\n\n[BREAK]\n\n“I’m looking for musicians who are inquisitive,” Blanchard said. That aspiration was evident throughout Sunday’s concert in Moscow, not least on Almazan’s “Everglades,” which emerged from Blanchard’s dreamy synth line that steered the composer into a Chopin-esque ballad upon which he created stark, forceful variations from which Blanchard piggybacked into a fiery, processed solo that incorporated mysterious overtones and echoes into the flow.\n\n“Sometimes in jazz, you learn a certain style and improvise within that style,” Blanchard said. “Well, Wayne Shorter said jazz means ‘I dare you.’ I want people who are willing to try anything, and then help me to learn from those things as they are learning.”\n\nIf the band’s unconstrained approach to the raw materials reflected Blanchard’s leadership style, so did the inclusion of Almazan’s contribution, the latest in a string of pieces Blanchard has incorporated from younger personnel — Edward Simon, Eric Harland, Lionel Loueke, Aaron Parks, Derrick Hodge, Bryce Winston, Walter Smith III and Almazan — on the leading edge of 21st-century jazz expression.\n\n“I’d never really played in 5/4 and 7/4, and those guys did it well, so I felt like the one who was behind the 8-ball,” he said of the salutary effects of eliciting original music from younger partners, as Art Blakey did when he and Donald Harrison played together in the Messengers. “To develop a high level of expression, they have to write and have a place to perform it and work it out. Where better than in a band with people you play with regularly, whose rhythmic and harmonic sensibilities you trust? Hearing your compositions up against something else can be a wakeup call, but that only happens with guys who really are trying to find themselves.”\n\nIn a sense, Blanchard said, he experiences this dynamic in meeting the varied challenges presented by film scoring. “I always say that my jazz background allows me to think quickly on my feet in the film world,” he said. He described his process on Inside Job, which includes old-school funk, atonal string music and remixes of the Sufi-based pop song “Chaiyya Chaiyya,” which Spike Lee appropriated from the Bollywood romantic thriller Dil Se.\n\n“Spike found the Indian song, and told me he’d use it for the opening and closing, which made it an element. For one area at the end, he wanted a string quartet. ‘Oh-kay! A string quartet it is.’ He decided to use a love theme I’d written as the main theme. I had to figure out how to make this very intimate sound that I initially heard into something more menacing. The Roger Dickerson experience was extremely helpful. It allowed me to see all those musical ideas in various forms.”\n\nBlanchard’s experience with Dickerson and his other New Orleans mentors is a key reason why he returned to the Crescent City from Brooklyn midway through the ’90s, as was his desire to be near his children after a divorce. “I learned a lot in New York, but every time I went home I’d remember why I was doing this,” he said. “Being in New Orleans kept my feet to the ground, reminding me every day of the guys I heard growing up whose dedication came from sheer passion.\n\n“Art Blakey and Dizzy Gillespie aren’t around to tell people any more. It’s up to us. We have to start saying, ‘Listen, this is how I did this, and this is how you can do this.’”\n\nSIDEBAR\n\nTitle: Punchy Music\n\nTerence Blanchard has recently been making his mark as a composer in Broadway theater, with credits that include the Chris Rock vehicle The Motherf**ker With A Hat and a revival of Tennessee Williams’ A Streetcar Named Desire. But no recent achievement gives him greater joy than his first opera, Champion: An Opera In Jazz, commissioned by the St. Louis Opera Theater, which staged six sold-out shows in June 2013.\n\nChampion is a two-act, 10-scene account of the life and times of welterweight boxing champion Emile Griffith. (The libretto is by Tony-Award winning playwright Michael Cristofer, with whom Blanchard worked on the films Gia and Original Sin.) Griffith, who died in 2013, is best remembered for the denouement of his third title match with the Cuban boxer Benny “the Kid” Paret, who Griffith knocked out to win the championship in 1961, lost to in a split decision later that year, and defeated again in 1962, attacking his opponent — who had outed and mocked Griffith’s closeted homosexuality during the weigh-in — with such ferocity that Paret died as a consequence.\n\nBlanchard is no stranger to contact sports, having played Pop Warner football well enough in late-adolescence to be placed on an all-city team (“I was strong for my age”), before his father forbade further activity. “My dad sang opera, and it was very important for me to get through this,” he said. “When they brought me onstage to take a bow after the premier, Arthur Woodley, who plays the older Emile, grabbed me and said, ‘Your dad would be proud.’ I was like a little baby.”\n\nFor Blanchard — who trains with former world heavyweight champion Michael Bentt, who he met during the early ’00s while working on Dark Blue, with director Ron Silver — boxing is analogous to jazz. “After you learn the fundamentals and proper technique, it all goes out the window when the bell rings,” he said. “It’s a chess match — out-thinking your opponent, being a couple of moves ahead. Michael never felt one of his greatest knockout punches; he was in a zone, and it seemed effortless. I feel that way sometimes on the bandstand, that I’m witnessing myself as the audience is.”\n\nHe stated that high-level boxers feel the same passion for their sport as his own peer group feels for music. “I was in the gym with Virgil Jones, who trains [WBA super-middleweight champion] Andre Ward. I was hitting the heavy bag, and some trainers saw me. They didn’t know who I was. They said, ‘Man, you got a nice power shot.’ They don’t care. I’m not competing! It’s the same thing with musicians. If you go out and hear a kid who can play, you go, ‘Man, that guy’s got a good sound.’”\n\nBy his estimation, Terence Blanchard has spent 12 to 14 months out of the last 18 on the road, primarily with his band, so his itinerary on this Friday doesn’t vary so greatly different from his quotidian routine. The previous evening Blanchard interrupted his work on the score for “Original Sin,” a feature film starring Angelina Jolie and Antonio Banderas scheduled for early 2001 release, to board a late-night flight to New York; after a few hours sleep, he met a crew from “CBS Sunday Morning” to shoot street footage and interviews for a forthcoming segment. Now he’s sitting in a stuffy van that is crawling crosstown through afternoon Manhattan traffic en route to the waterfront Long Island home of Clark Terry to shoot the photographs of the issue you have in hand. Along for the ride are Robin Burgess, who is Blanchard’s manager and his wife, photographer David Bartolemi, who is doubling as chauffeur, Bartolemi’s 20-year-old assistant, a publicist and a journalist. As we nibble takeout Pad Thai and Dim Sim, the discussion ranges from the “game face” that Sonny Rollins suddenly took on directly before the curtain rose on a Rollins-Blanchard Carnegie Hall concert several years before, segueing to complaints about journalists who pose sneak-attack questions, morphing to disquisitions on athletes who are and are not role models — as we approach Terry’s home, it concludes with a heartfelt critique on the manner in which jazz business inhibits the creative endeavors of musicians.\n\nBlanchard’s performance fees are not insubstantial, but, with 29 films under his belt, he doesn’t tour out of financial necessity. “There’s been a lot of question about my sincerity as a jazz musician,” he had noted the previous Monday in a phone conversation from his office in the New Orleans Garden District. “For me, that’s a ludicrous question. I could easily make more money just writing films, but I’m still out on the road. I love playing music, I love playing jazz, and it will never be my choice to give that up.”\n\nThis year’s release, “Wandering Moon,” reinforces that assertion. It’s a de facto suite of Blanchard compositions that touch metaphorically on the alienation from family and roots that road life necessitates while emphatically celebrating the imperatives that keep him traveling. “It culminates some ideas I set in motion a while ago,” the 38-year-old trumpeter says. “During my shows, I’d play some of my tunes and then things by Duke Ellington or Wayne Shorter or some standards, and started to hear the deficiencies in my own writing style. It was a wakeup call. I realized that I needed to internalize other people’s music by playing it on the road for a while.” Blanchard documented that search with “The Billie Holiday Songbook” (1994); the Grammy-nominated “The Heart Speaks” (1996), an interpretative collaboration with Brazilian composer-singer Ivan Lins on which Blanchard’s consonant, vocalized sound and romantic sensibility were fully on display; and the well-received “Jazz On Film” (1999), on which, with help from an A-list ensemble, he rescored and rearranged eight film music classics plus his theme for Spike Lee’s “Clockers.”\n\n“It seemed to be the right time to get back to original music,” Blanchard remarks of “Wandering Moon”; as the “Downbeat” electorate noted, the album is a triumph. Blanchard’s resourceful young working band (Brice Winston, tenor sax; Aaron Fletcher, alto sax; Ed Simon, piano; Eric Harland, drums), seasoned by authoritative veterans Branford Marsalis on tenor and Dave Holland on bass, interprets with a no-holds barred improvisational attitude the leader’s rhythmically intricate extended form compositions, replete with memorable melodies that define harmonic progression. They take their cue from Blanchard, who seems able to execute any idea that enters his mind. His instrumental voice denotes a man comfortable in his own skin, capable of articulating a vocabulary that encompasses a wide range of human experience. Some have described the voice as dark; it could as easily be termed urbane, cerebral, erotic, lyric, immutably inflected with a blues sensibility.\n\n“My favorite instrument in the world is the human voice, but I can’t sing,” Blanchard laughs. “I read a quote by Maurice Andre where he talked about having the experience of not feeling the horn in his hands, like he was just singing through the instrument. I’ve never gotten there, but my quest has been to get to the point where the instrument no longer exists…in a sense. You try to get a vocal quality through the horn, the quality you hear when you listen to Miles Davis or Louis Armstrong.”\n\nA decade ago, around the time when he was writing the music for Spike Lee’s “Jungle Fever,” Blanchard took a hiatus from a successful career — he could look back on a four-year stint with Art Blakey and the Jazz Messengers and co-leadership of the influential Harrison-Blanchard Quintet — to change his embouchure. “I wasn’t developing technically,” he says. “Emotionally and musically, I was growing. I kept hearing ideas in my head that I wanted to play but couldn’t execute, and that was very frustrating. My bottom lip was rolled over my teeth and I was cutting my lip. Art Blakey’s whole thing was, ‘Don’t lie to yourself; just tell yourself the truth.’ When you lie to yourself, you’re covering up inadequacies, and you can’t grow that way. Once I figured out what the problem was, I had the opportunity to fix it. Then it was a matter of being diligent, staying on course, taking my time and being disciplined. When I made the change, it immediately allowed me to open up my sound. Technically I got to the point where I could play over the horn from low to high with a certain amount of ease. That allowed me the freedom to explore more musical ideas. Before I would put the time in but I wouldn’t gain the results I wanted. Now there’s no excuse. If there’s something I want to do, then I have to put in the time to develop the ability to do it.”\n\nPutting in the time was never an issue for Blanchard, who learned about the aesthetic rewards of hard work from his father, Oliver Joseph Blanchard, to whom he dedicated “Joe and O,” a lovingly disputatious call-and-response tune on “Wandering Moon.” Pere Blanchard, who died in 1998, was an opera lover who sang professionally in the 1930’s and ’40s, and continued to sing in the church choir and other groups long after he began to sell insurance in New Orleans for a small black-owned company. “My father was a one-fingered piano player,” Blanchard recalls, “and whenever he had a performance, he would be at the piano all day. He was a baritone. He would play his part and learn it, then he would play the tenor part and sing his part against it. I’d go out and play football for hours, and he’d still be at the piano when I came back.\n\n“He loved the earlier jazz, people like Louis Armstrong and Earl Hines. He wasn’t interested in bebop and what happened after that. He said, ‘Man, those guys play too many notes. Listen to Pops. You can hear melody there.’ I come from Miles Davis and Clifford Brown, and we would have musical discussions all the time. He allowed me to have my opinion, and he wanted me to convince him that he was wrong! Then, I started playing with Art Blakey, who was the last guy I expected to talk about Louis Armstrong, and Art would say, ‘Yeah, Miles and Clifford were cool, but Pops had a sound.’ That made me go back and research that music again.”\n\n“Terence was always diligent,” says Branford Marsalis, who preceded Blanchard in the Jazz Messengers, and has been his friend since they — along with Wynton Marsalis and Donald Harrison — attended the New Orleans Center of Creative Arts in the 1970’s. “He went to a predominantly black Catholic school called St. Augustine, which has a great marching band, but had a terrible music program. They consistently had the best talent that the city had to offer, and did nothing with it. At some point in his sophomore year Terence realized that the school wasn’t going to fulfill his needs. So he quit, and went to a public school that would allow him to go to NOCCA. In hindsight, that was a helluva thing for him to do. He’s always been the kind of person to be honest enough to figure out the surroundings, and then be proactive about it.\n\n“I think that Terence’s decision to change his embouchure changed him as a person and changed his musicianship. There was a mild competition between he and Wynton, which is only natural — they play the same instrument and both want to excel. Terence was willing to undergo two years of absolute misery for long-term gain. For a professional working musician to decide to take a hit like that shows an enormous level of personal honesty that is rare even amongst musicians who make our living by trying to be relatively honest.”\n\nAfter NOCCA, Blanchard decided to study at Rutgers, an hour’s drive from New York; there he studied with trumpet guru William Fielder and band instructor Paul Jeffreys, who placed the young trumpeter in Lionel Hampton’s band, in which he played for a year-and-half on weekends. In February 1982, on Wynton Marsalis’ recommendation, Blanchard and Harrison auditioned for and got the gig with the Jazz Messengers\n\n“I grew so much just in the first month,” Blanchard states. “Wynton had told Art that I could write. So the first thing Art said was, ‘I know you’ve got a box of tunes; pull them all out — we’re going to play them all!’ When you see someone like that apply their musical knowledge to newer compositions, the practicality of the process makes you want to reinvestigate all of your records. Art made me understand that as long as I set my goals and worked towards them, I could do anything I wanted. I got a chance to play with some great musicians who were my peers on a consistent basis; we grew and learned and made mistakes together, which was a great learning experience. I got a chance to see guys get better, which motivated me. Even though my embouchure was incorrect, my sound started to get stronger. Plus we were playing with Art! You’re in the Messengers, and you realize that this guy had listened to Clifford Brown, Freddie Hubbard, Lee Morgan, Donald Byrd, Woody Shaw…the list is endless. Now he’s listening to me.”\n\nEarlier, as the van was inching towards Clark Terry’s house, Blanchard looked back on his first encounter with the most recent member of the Downbeat Hall of Fame. “When I was 17, Clark came to New Orleans to give a master class, and later I went to his show at the club in the Hyatt Regency Hotel,” Blanchard recalled. “He remembered me from the school, called me up to play a tune with him, and I played his horn. He was the first guy I saw play who really made me understand what I needed to work on in terms of technique and control. I used to listen to records by Clifford Brown and Freddie Hubbard and even by Clark, and imagined people gyrating all over the stage to get those phrases out of the instrument. The man barely moved, but he was so expressive and made it look so incredibly easy that I wanted to run home and pick up my horn and start practicing. Then I really found out how difficult it was!”\n\nAfter the outdoor portion of the hour-plus shoot — the old master and his heir posed on a backyard bench 20 feet from the Long Island Sound shoreline, engaging in focused conversation and extemporaneously playing “the Flintstones Theme” and “What A Wonderful World” for the “CBS Sunday Morning” crew — I grab a few minutes with Terry by the piano in his award-festooned living room.\n\n“After you’ve been around as long as I have you can tell what a subject is or is not going to be,” Terry comments. “I saw right away that Terence had something extra-special, because of his personality and his seeming ability to detect a situation that was musical. Terence never broke tones. It was always straight, melodic tones. And even at the age when I first met him, he seemed to have a great knack for mellifluousness. You could tell from the start he was already on the right track, and he kept developing. Every time I have an opportunity to play with him, I’m amazed at how beautiful and fluid and professional he has become through the years.”\n\nAs Bartolemi and the TV crew pack up, Terry and Blanchard sit at the kitchen counter, near a basket with a world-class selection of hot sauces, exchanging hilarious ribald parables between mouthfuls of sandwich and sips of Dry Seck. Then it’s time to pile back in the van to get Blanchard and Burgess to LaGuardia Airport for their 8 o’clock return flight to New Orleans; by 9 the next morning Blanchard expects to resume work on “Original Sin.”\n\n“I would say that the vibration I get from Terence is that he is a trumpeter of genuineness,” Terry concludes. “You can tell who are the name brands and who are the off-brands and substitutions. He always would be recognized as a name brand, not an also-ran. He’s a leader. He has his own sound. I can recognize him right away. Now, you can have your sound and it can be a horrible sound. But he has his own sound which is a marvelous sound. He studied and worked hard. If you work diligently enough and go through the right channels, all the beautiful things within you are capable of coming out. Terence was smart enough or clever or gifted enough to choose the right channels, and you can’t hold talent down when it’s given the right nourishment.”\n\n“When you watch Ruby Dee,” Blanchard commented toward the end, “you forget you’re watching a movie, and get into her character. That’s what happens to me when I listen to Bird or Coltrane or Monk or Miles or Dizzy, and it’s what I aspire to in my music. It’s time for musicians in my generation to throw away the shackles of the past, to investigate some other areas. Not much true exploration is occurring. I think cats like Steve Coleman and Branford are working in interesting directions. It’s hard to do. Our challenge as musicians is to be honest with ourselves and reevaluate what we’re doing and where we’re going.”\n\n1. Dizzy Gillespie, “Africana,” from Gillespiana, Verve, 1961/1993), Gillespie, trumpet; Lalo Schiffrin, arranger.\n\nIt’s Dizzy, obviously, but I don’t know the tune or the arranger. 5 stars for Dizzy and the arrangement. [LATER] Lalo incorporates some elements that are distinctly like jazz big band and some are that are very orchestral; he only brings the trumpet in for certain big moments. Dizzy sounds great. He played with such command of his instrument. It’s a good pick, because he’s playing unlike Dizzy, if you know what I mean, but you can tell it’s him by his sound and phrasing. It sounds like they recorded everybody live in one room, and then you hear Dizzy playing over the band. The sound is huge.\n\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n2. Bill Dixon, “Summer Song/Three/Aurorea/Dusk,” (from In Italy, Vol. 1, Soul Note, 1980), Dixon, trumpet.\n\nIs it Don Cherry? Then I don’t know who this is. [LATER} He played something in the lower register which made me think of Don, but he has a bigger sound. His facility made me think of Booker Little, but I don’t remember Booker making this kind of record. I thought it was good, creative and interesting, but I must admit that it isn’t my cup of tea. It’s hard for me to rate it. You hear right off is that he really believes in this, and I can’t fault anyone for that. I’m interested in the intent behind the music. I believe there’s a lot of room for everybody to express themselves in various variations or iterations of this thing we call jazz.\n\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n3. Ornette Coleman-Don Cherry, “Sound Manual”(#8) (from In All\n\nLanguages, Harmolodic, 1987). Ornette Coleman, alto saxophone; Don Cherry, trumpet; Charlie Haden, bass; Billy Higgins, drums\n\nI want to have that! As soon as you drop the needle it’s like, “Oh, okay.” I always loved that band. 5 stars. That was recorded in ’87? Get out of here! It’s obvious how they influenced Miles’ band. Don had a way of reinventing lyrical lines; they aren’t in any specific meter, they’re freed up in time and space, and they flow. Those guys were ____ renegades. Just think about the time they were doing this stuff, the crowd of people they were surrounded by; they had to be brave to come out and do this. I’ve never thought of them as free musicians, and I don’t know why people do. They did what everybody wants to do in jazz. Once you learn the language and understand how this music functions and operates, then you devise a platform on which everything you do is based on musically. _________________________________________________________________\n\n4. Art Farmer, “Raincheck,” (from Listen To Art Farmer & The Orchestra, Mercury, 1962/1997). Art Farmer, flugelhorn; Oliver Nelson, arrangement.\n\nIt’s a wild recording; I don’t know the trumpeter or arranger. Art Farmer and Oliver Nelson? The arrangement threw me off; the harmonies and orchestrations, with the woodwinds and electric guitar, sounded a little bit like some West Coast stuff. Art sounded great. He hit all those notes right on the head, played them in tune and phrased them beautifully. 5 for the performance, 4 for the arrangement.\n\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n5. Freddie Hubbard, “Thermo”, (from Above And Beyond, Metropolitan, 1982/1999)\n\nThat was “Thermo.” I remember busting my lips trying to play it. Freddie Hubbard is one of the all-time greats in this music, not just a trumpet player but a great composer as well. I did a gig with Freddie and Woody Shaw when I was really young. It was wild, because nothing I played belonged to me — it belonged to one of them. Every time I played something, “Whoa, can’t do that.” [LAUGHS] I always admired his facility, the weight of his sound and phrasing — right in the middle of the beat. 5 for the performance and 5 for the composition.\n\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n6. Wynton Marsalis, “Spring Yaounde,” (from City Griot, Columbia, 1991). Wynton Marsalis, trumpet.\n\nObviously Wynton. It’s nice. Wynton has definitely developed his own sound. He’s had that for a long time. Anything he plays you’ve got to give him a 5. He’s a serious technician, with a unique way of twisting lines and rhythms. The composition I don’t feel as strong about; I’ll give it a 4. To me subtext has always been his thing; you’ve always got to check out what’s going on underneath the melody. I’ve known him since elementary school, and he and Branford and Kent Jordan all influenced me to practice and want to be better. I’ll always appreciate knowing them for that reason alone, aside from just enjoying their music.\n\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n7. Brian Lynch, “I’ve Grown Accustomed To Your Face,” Spheres of Influence, Sharp-9, 1997). Brian Lynch, trumpet.\n\nI don’t know who it is. [LATER] I knew it would come to me after a while! I’ll give the performance a 5. Brian has always been a good player; he’s been around and knows what he’s doing. The arrangement was interesting, particularly the introduction, which I didn’t expect to go where it did; I’ll give it a 4. Brian’s style is musically direct. Art Blakey always used to tell us, “never speak down to anybody or speak over them; speak right to them,” and all the guys who played with Art had that right-to-the-point approach.\n\nThis was wild! When you hear all of this, you realize the vast number of distinctive styles in this music of people playing the same instrument. That’s always that fascinated me about playing jazz as opposed to playing Pop or Classical music. There’s a readily discernible difference in all these guys, and we’re all playing the same instrument and the same three valves.\n\n[-30-]\n\n[MUSIC: Blanchard: “Divine Order,” “Going to Mecca,” “Malcolm’s Theme,” “Poems,” “Don’t Explain.”\n\nTP: I’d like to talk about your relation to different trumpet stylists when you were coming up as a trumpeter, and I gather Clifford Brown was someone you heard rather early on.\n\nBLANCHARD: Yes. Clifford Brown and Miles Davis were the first people that I really paid attention to. Clifford was the first. I think the thing that caught me about Clifford was just his mastery of the instrument. Prior to that I had heard trumpet players who could play high, I had heard trumpet players who could do little tricks. But Clifford’s lyrical and rhythmical knowledge of music that he displayed on the instrument was very fascinating to me. I remember listening to “Sweet Clifford” for the first time, and was totally amazed at his technique. Miles Davis was totally at the opposite end of the spectrum for me. The first time that I heard him play I was just taken by his purity, and his thoughts, his musical thoughts.\n\nTP: What were the circumstances under which you heard them play? At home? In school?\n\nBLANCHARD: At first it was in school. I went to the New Orleans Center of the Creative Arts, and Ellis Marsalis put on some of these records for me. Prior to that I wanted to be a Jazz musician, but at this time there wasn’t any Tower Records, and the stores’ stock of Jazz product was very limited. Most of the stuff that you could get at that time, you had to order. So we weren’t really knowledgeable about a lot of things, and that’s where Ellis played a big role.\n\nTP: What was your experience in Jazz before being exposed to Ellis Marsalis and that quite remarkable little class he had at that time?\n\nBLANCHARD: [LAUGHS] I knew about Louis Armstrong and I knew about some of the earlier musicians, like Earl “Fatha” Hines, because my father used to talk about Earl Fatha Hines and Pops all the time. Of course, the popular people, the famous people like Dizzy Gillespie who you used to see on television all the time, and people like Oscar Peterson and Sarah Vaughan. But as far as the modern era of Jazz, I wasn’t really up on that, people like John Coltrane, Clifford and Ornette Coleman.\n\nTP: Had you been playing trumpet from an early age?\n\nBLANCHARD: I started playing trumpet in my fourth grade in elementary school, but I didn’t really take a lesson until my junior year in high school. So I had the trumpet for a long time.\n\nTP: Were you involved in second line type things in New Orleans?\n\nBLANCHARD: Not as much as I would like to have. At that time, “when I became serious,” I started devoting all of my time to staying at home and studying and listening to music and practicing — because I had a lot of stuff to do. I didn’t have a chance to play in some of the New Orleans style bands. I did get a chance to play with some of the Jazz bands. I played more of the modern stuff. Dick Stabile(?) had a big band at the Fairmont Hotel, and I used to sub for Emory Thompson all the time there. There were a couple of other gigs that we used to have. I used to sit with people at a club called Tyler’s in New Orleans (it’s closed now), and Snug Harbor, which used to be called the Farber(?) at that time.\n\nTP: Talk about Ellis Marsalis’ mode of teaching. Apart from the innate talent of the students, how did everyone come out of there so prepared?\n\nBLANCHARD: I think it was an effort of all of the faculty. Ellis taught Jazz Improvisation and sight singing. But we had a number of different opportunities. We studied theory and analysis, we had different project classes where people would work on special things, depending upon what it was that you wanted to do later on in life. We also had to be in the chorus, and we learned about breathing and phrasing and stuff like that. So it was a number of different things. We also had a performance class, where you were graded not only on your performance, but your critique of other performances.\n\nTP: Terence Blanchard commented on Clifford Brown combination of virtuosity and tremendous lyricism, and it was never better illustrated on the Clifford Brown with Strings record, from which we’ll play “Can’t Help Lovin’ That Man Of Mine.”\n\n[MUSIC: Clifford Brown, “Can’t Help Lovin’ That Man Of Mine,” “Sweet Clifford”; Miles Davis, “Old Folks”]\n\nTP: If you’d been in here with Terence Blanchard, who programmed that material, you’d have seen him singing the solos pretty much note for note, all of them, plus the tenor solos, doing the drum arrangements, and basically reminiscing about absorbing this music when he was a teenager in New Orleans and later. Would you repeat what you were saying about Miles Davis right before we went on mike?\n\nBLANCHARD: What I loved about this band is that there were no wasted notes, not by anybody in the band, whether they were accompanying a soloist or whether they were out front. Everything seemed to be just right on. It takes special musicians to be able to do that, because sometimes musicians wanted to be out front, their ego gets the best of them. But these guys really seemed to play in tune with the music. I love that band.\n\nTP: There’s a quality of spontaneous composition and refinement of the arrangement going on all the time, it seems, with Miles Davis’ band.\n\nBLANCHARD: Yeah. And see, the thing about it is there’s a large amount of control that the band has as a group. Because anybody can step out and just play some stuff that’s melodically hip or rhythmically hip. But it takes a lot of control to restrain yourself and be able to play what’s perfect for the moment, which may be different from what you intended to play when you walked into the studio or walked into the club that night.\n\nTP: Or maybe right the instant before you started playing the solo.\n\nBLANCHARD: Oh, definitely.\n\nTP: You made another comment about Miles which has been commonly made, which is that on the first note, he can play the one note, and you know it’s him.\n\nBLANCHARD: Well, that’s the thing I love about this music. From the guys that I really admire and love and really appreciate from the very first note, you can tell it’s their music. That’s the great thing about being with Jackie McLean for a week at the Blue Note. You open the door in the dressing room… Jackie wasn’t even playing; I think somebody else was playing. But you can hear the compositions and you say, “That’s Jackie McLean’s music.” That’s a fascinating thing for me, because we still use all those same 12 tones. People say you have to find something new, but I think you just have to be yourself, and I think that’s what those musicians were doing.\n\nTP: Why is it so hard to play with the type of economy that Miles Davis played with?\n\nBLANCHARD: Well, I think it takes special musicians to be able to do that. Because sometimes musicians can be a little selfish. Let’s face it. Sometimes our egos can get the best of us.\n\nTP: Well, you’ve spent a lot of time perfecting your instrument, and you want to show your stuff off!\n\nBLANCHARD: [LAUGHS] Right. You want to display your wares, so to speak. I think what made that band so great was the fact that they could put all that stuff aside, and understand that playing as a unit… You say more by playing for the moment, and not trying to reach that peak or not trying to display that technical prowess on every song.\n\nTP: Yet, getting back to technique, let’s say a few words about what specifically you would think technically about Miles Davis’ playing and Clifford Brown. You had the chance to play next to Sonny Rollins a few years ago at Carnegie Hall and had the chance to play some of the things he’d played with Clifford Brown, like “Pent-Up House” and maybe “Kiss and Run” as well.\n\nBLANCHARD: The thing that I find interesting is that… Of course, everybody always talks about Clifford Brown’s dexterity over his instrument, which is very obvious. He had a tremendous amount of control over his instrument, not only technically, but also with his sound. But I think Miles gets slighted a bit when it comes to that. First of all, he had a beautiful tone, and it takes a lot of control to be able to play with a beautiful tone like that. And he had a great attack, which also takes a lot of technique and control. He was no slouch! I mean, “My Funny Valentine” live, he’s nailing some of those G’s and A’s [LAUGHS] up there pretty consistently on that session.\n\nSo I think both those guys were technically proficient in their own right, but had different styles. That’s the beauty of the music, is that this music allows people to really express themselves in the way they see fit.\n\nTP: Well, the next trumpeter up is Clark Terry, known for his impeccable technique and tremendous imagination in small groups, big bands, studios, reading, trumpet, flugelhorn, mute, everything for almost 50 years, and also as a teacher. Your impressions of Clark Terry, first hearing him, etc.\n\nBLANCHARD: Well, Clark Terry was the first guy that I saw play live who really made me understand what it was I needed to work on in terms of my technique and control. I used to listen to the Clifford Brown records, like I said, and I listened to Freddie Hubbard records and even Clark Terry’s stuff, and just imagined people all over the stage gyrating to get those phrases out of the instrument. The first time I heard him play was at a hotel in New Orleans. The man barely moved. But he was so expressive through his instrument. It really amazed me. He made it look so incredibly easy that I wanted to run home and just pick up my horn and start practicing. And then I really found out how difficult it was! I mean, I’d always had a lot of respect for Clark Terry, but my love and passion for his genius just really grew from that point on.\n\n[MUSIC: C. Terry w/ Ellington, “Perdido” (1952); Freddie Hubbard, “Birdlike” (1961)]\n\nTP: We listened to a tune that’s been a challenge to just about every trumpet player that’s come up in the last 25 years and more, Freddie Hubbard’s “Birdlike” from 1961. I think Terence described that as a 21-chorus solo, though you might have been off by one or two. And what a great solo by Clark Terry on “Perdido”.\n\nBLANCHARD: It was great. I remember the first time I heard that. I was in college, at Rutgers, and somebody was playing it over the loudspeaker system in the hall. It drew me into the hall. I ran into the hall, trying to figure out who the hell was that playing the trumpet. It was an amazing thing.\n\nTP: He just goes right into the solo, and he keeps building. Every time you think he’s upped the ante to the max, he comes up with something else.\n\nBLANCHARD: Well, the thing that amazed me about it was the fact that it was “hip.” It was beyond the Swing Era to me.\n\nTP: He quotes “Parisian Thoroughfare” at the end of the solo.\n\nBLANCHARD: He played a lot of ideas which were very contemporary for the period.\n\nTP: Well, Miles Davis and Dizzy Gillespie spoke of Clark Terry as a musician who was totally conversant with everything that was happening during the innovations of the mid-’40s. Talk about Freddie Hubbard’s impact on the world of trumpet.\n\nBLANCHARD: Freddie Hubbard scared me to death. I saw him play live one time in New Orleans, and I was just totally amazed at everything that he did, harmonically and rhythmically. He was definitely one of my heros. I got a chance to meet him that night, too. Actually he called me up to play; I was about 18 years old. It was a great honor meeting him. Plus I grew up listening to all the stuff he did with Art Blakey, and then the stuff he did on his own, Red Clay and some of the Pop stuff, Funk stuff.\n\nTP: What happened when he called you up to sit in?\n\nBLANCHARD: Oh, he was totally cool. What happened was, I was at a jazz band competition earlier that day, and the judges heard me play, and they took me to the club actually, and they knew Freddie and introduced me to him. They told him about me, and he said he wanted to hear me play. So he called me up and he gave me his trumpet, and he played the flugelhorn, and we played a blues.\n\nTP: Put on the teacher’s hat again and talk about what Freddie Hubbard’s done and where he stands amidst the various trumpet styles of the period.\n\nBLANCHARD: Well, for me, Freddie has changed the style of the trumpet from the Dizzy Gillespie, Clifford Brown, and even Miles Davis period. He came into the music with a freshness that was very different, and you could tell that he was very influenced by the saxophonists of his period.\n\nTP: How does being influenced by saxophone players manifest itself in a trumpet style?\n\nBLANCHARD: Well, he played some things that weren’t really associated with the trumpet. Some of those arpeggiated things he played, some of the more technical things he would do and some of the extended harmonic things he would do, and the rhythmical things all interspersed between those, weren’t really associated with the instrument. It was associated more with the saxophone players of the period, like Trane, Sonny Rollins, people like that.\n\nPeople don’t talk about this a lot with Freddie. But Freddie and Woody Shaw, to me, had a very unique rhythmical concept to the things they played, and it had a very large impact on me. That’s the thing I always noticed about him. Sometimes Freddie’s phrases can turn on a dime, so to speak. Especially the way he played later on. I heard him play at the Blue Note one night, and he amazed me, because as soon as you think he’s going to resolve a phrase one way, he turns and goes another direction. Not only does it go in another direction in terms of ascending-descending, but also harmonically. It was just an amazing thing to listen to, because he does that on tunes that are harmonically complex. So it was more of a testimony to his genius.\n\nI think people need to be more aware of that side of him. I think sometimes Freddie gets labelled as a guy who is just technically proficient on his instrument, but I think he’s definitely created and developed his own style that’s influenced a lot of us. When I listen to the record we just played… I’ll give you an example. Once I played with Freddie Hubbard and Woody Shaw at Russian River Festival, and it was the most frustrating and the most enjoyable concert in my life. It was enjoyable to be on the bandstand with them. It was frustrating because everything that I played belonged to one of them. Everything! It was just amazing, because I didn’t realize it up until that point. They’d play something, and I thought, “Wow, oh, that’s right; I got that from that record.” Then Woody would play something and I’d say, “Oh, right, okay.”\n\nTP: Back to square two anyway.\n\nBLANCHARD: I said, “Yeah, now it’s time for to start dealing with something else.”\n\nTP: Well, I guess a lot of trumpet players had that reaction to Louis Armstrong when they heard his innovations in the ’20s and ’30s — “Where do we go from here?”\n\nBLANCHARD: Oh, definitely.\n\nTP: Being from New Orleans, I’d think you’d have been aware of Pops from Square One.\n\nBLANCHARD: Not directly. I was aware of Louis Armstrong, I was aware of who he was, but I really hadn’t listened a lot to his music. I’d heard people in New Orleans playing in that style all while I was growing up. But it wasn’t until I joined Art Blakey’s band, and I started listening to Art talk about Louis Armstrong…\n\nTP: What did he say about him?\n\nBLANCHARD: Well, he just talked about him being a genius. He talked about his prowess on his instrument, and how he had a really big sound, how he could really sing. Art Blakey always talked about that. He said Pops could really sing through his instrument. I had to go back and reexamine Pops, because I kept looking at him from a social standpoint and not being comfortable with what I thought he represented socially. But then I had to go back and reevaluate the period from which it was created and what he did for music, and how he really changed the course of music. He’s still, to me, probably one of the greatest Jazz musicians who ever walked this planet, for a number of reasons. First of all, not only was he able to really master his instrument, but he also had the ability to combine a lot of aspects that musicians have trouble dealing with today. He was an entertainer, and he also was a genius musically. The music stands on its own. He didn’t water down his music for commercialism. He had a way of incorporating all those elements together, which I think made him one of the greatest of all time.\n\n[MUSIC: Pops, “Muskrat Ramble,” “Struttin’ With Some Barbecue” (1956)]\n\nTP: Terence, your music publishing company is Joseph Oliver Music, and I’d thought it referred to King Oliver, but you told me different.\n\nBLANCHARD: No, really it’s about my father. My father, as I knew him growing up, his name was Oliver Joseph Blanchard, but when I became a teenager we found his birth certificate, and his birth certificate had it labeled as Joseph Oliver Blanchard. That’s where the title comes from.\n\nTP: Growing up in New Orleans, you mentioned hearing a lot of older musicians playing in that style. Was that a major part of your musical development?\n\nBLANCHARD: Oh, yes.\n\nTP: Talk about that a bit, and let’s talk about the culture of New Orleans and the continuity of this style of music.\n\nBLANCHARD: One of the things I loved about growing up in New Orleans was that everybody had some kind of appreciation for Jazz, whether they were really into the music or not. Because you heard it all the time. That was the big thing, to hear the trumpet call before the Second Line. Everybody knew what was about to occur. Or to see one of the Jazz funerals, when the band would split and let the body pass by, and then they would get into their thing of celebrating the passage from one life to another. Or just hearing bands on Bourbon Street and the French Quarter. When I was in high school, I always caught the bus or the streetcar to Canal Street, and then I would have to switch to a bus. But sometimes I would walk up Bourbon Street, because they had 24-hour music, and I would hear a lot of guys, like Teddy Riley, who’s a great trumpet player, Emory Thompson is another one, Wallace Davenport. I would hear these guys playing in the style of the music, and it really affected me, moreso when I started playing with Art and later on than it did at that particular time — because I started to reflect on my upbringing. Because I used to sit in with those guys in the French Quarter all the time, and I learned a lot.\n\nTP: How would the older musicians in New Orleans treat an eager young musician? Were they salty? Were they helpful and friendly?\n\nBLANCHARD: For me they were very, very helpful. They would always encourage me. I never really had a problem with anybody. They always told me things. They always pulled me aside and said, “Look, you need to deal with this” or “you need to check this out” or “I know you guys don’t want to hear this, but go listen to this style of music.” That was always helpful for me. Or they would do it on the bandstand. Sometimes Emory would play me some tunes, and I didn’t know what the hell they were or what key they were, but it really helped me to develop my ears. And just watching those guys, how they… I saw Emory one night, and he didn’t have a plunger mute, but he used a paper cup, and just to watch his technique with the cup, watching him make the horn speak, it was very unusual for me. And I have a great appreciation for all of those guys, for the things that they contributed.\n\nTP: Two aspects of New Orleans style playing that continue to have an impact on the music are the polyphonic ensemble playing we heard on the Pops tracks and the special rhythmic feeling of New Orleans. Can you talk about those aspects of music-making?\n\nBLANCHARD: That’s one of the things I love about Pops. When you listen to those guys play those ensembles it’s like a revival almost! It’s a special thing. It really gets you going. The music is very passionate and very powerful. But rhythmically that music has always had an identity all its own. It has a heavy root on the fourth beat. Everything seems to revolve on the fourth beat. If you’re counting in 4/4, it’s 1-2-3-4… Whether they play it or not, you can hear where everything revolves around it. Which makes it interesting, because everybody kind of knows what’s about to occur, and either you can go with it or you don’t have to. The thing that makes it interesting is the arrangements sometimes. You can hear it on “Muskrat Ramble.” They would set up like they were about to play something on the top, and then they didn’t — which really adds an element of surprise. I’ve traveled all over the world, and in other styles of music I can always hear the influence of New Orleans traditional music and other musics, which I think is great.\n\nTP: A lot of the older musicians you heard on Bourbon Street probably had other interests apart from that music. That was a functional thing, a way of making your living in New Orleans. But I’d think a number of them must have been aware of the advances in the music from the 1940’s and ’50s.\n\nBLANCHARD: Oh yeah, they were very aware of that. Those guys knew about everybody. That’s the thing that was great for me, because I didn’t get a chance to talk to Miles Davis or Dizzy Gillespie at that point in my life. I had those guys, and they were very helpful. Willie Singleton was the kind of guy who wasn’t really a soloist, but he was a great trumpet player, and he would talk to me all the time about stuff. It was interesting being around him, because I could hear him, like, read some Clifford Brown solos, and his sound and technique was just amazing. He would talk to me about how Clifford phrased certain things and how he developed things, and he would actually play them for me. Emory Thompson was the same way. He talked to me about Clifford and Miles and the things that he observed. He’d seen those guys play live, and he had talked to them about certain things. Plus he was a great player in his own right, so he had a lot of knowledge about the instrument.\n\n[MUSIC: Diz-Bird, “Bloomdido” (1950); Diz-Stitt-Getz, “Wee” (1956)]\n\nTP: Terence, put on your analyst hat and talk about Dizzy Gillespie.\n\nBLANCHARD: With Dizzy it was a gradual thing. I knew about Dizzy early on in my career, because like I said, you’d see him on television and hear him play. When I started listening to his recordings with Bird, it blew me away. He had the same impact on me that Clifford had, in terms of just marveling at what he could do with the instrument, the way he could phrase and just capture your attention. The things that he played rhythmically with the trumpet were very unique. I asked him about it, and he’d always make a joke, “Well, I was just trying to keep up with Bird.” I said, “Well, you were doing more than just keeping up!” When you listen to the melody of “Bloomdido,” it’s an amazing thing. Those solos, and just the melodies themselves are a real lesson in bebop; just learning how to play the melodies correctly and how to phrase them correctly.\n\nTP: Getting deep inside them is a lesson in and of itself.\n\nBLANCHARD: Definitely. When you look at the tune “Confirmation,” it’s definitely a lesson in the Blues and how to deal with alternate changes on the Blues — because that’s basically what it is, with a bridge. The thing that’s great about the Bebop era for me is that those guys played, for lack of a better term, a lot of notes, but all those notes still had meaning. They weren’t notes for the sake of crowding a specific space with music. When you listen to tunes like “Bloomdido,” all the things that Bird and Dizzy did, all of the notes had a purpose, and a lot of the stuff was very melodic. That’s the thing that I think is really the genius behind that, that throughout all of it there’s still melody.\n\nTP: We’ll move now to Thelonious Monk, one of the unique melodists in all of music. Both he and Dizzy were very close to your former employer, Art Blakey. There’s a story that in the Billy Eckstine band, when Art Blakey came in, Dizzy Gillespie danced out the rhythms for Buhaina, and Buhaina took off from there more or less. Did Art ever talk about that.\n\nBLANCHARD: He never talked about that specifically, but he did talk about that band a great deal, and he did talk about Dizzy and Bird being in that band, and he talked about how much he learned from those guys. He felt like he didn’t really have a lot together when he got in that situation, and those guys took him by the hand and nurtured him and helped him to really develop his craft.\n\nTP: We’ll hear one of Terence’s favorite’s on Monk Plays Ellington, “I Let A Song Go Out of My Heart.”\n\nBLANCHARD: One of the things about this album that I really love is the fact, first of all, that Monk would take the time to do this project and express his appreciation for a person he obviously learned a great deal from. The other thing is he did it in such a fashion that he’s still Monk. He’s not trying to play like Duke Ellington. He’s being Thelonious Monk playing the music of Duke Ellington. When you listen to all of this stuff, that combination adds a uniqueness to the entire project that I think is quite wonderful — and very beautiful.\n\n[MUSIC: Monk, “I Let A Song Go Out of My Heart” & “Caravan” Ellington, “Anatomy Of A Murder: Main Title”]\n\nTP: At the end of “I Let A Song Go Out of My Heart” Terence said, “That’s bad! We have to play another.” You had the solos memorized, the bass solo, all the chords down. The things you find out doing a Musician Show!\n\nThe Ellington soundtrack had a big influence on you, Terence, when you began your own scoring endeavors with Spike Lee for X and before that for Mo’ Better Blues.\n\nBLANCHARD: Not so much for Mo’ Better Blues, because I just wrote one piece of music for that. [END OF SIDE, MISSED A BIT] …Stravinsky’s “Rite of Spring” so I could get a handle on both idioms. The sad thing was that I didn’t really get a chance to use much of what I learned from either. The first thing I learned from doing film is that the story really will tell you what type of music it needs. But hopefully, I’ll get a chance to really stretch out, so to speak, in the future.\n\nTP: You said as a youngster the reason you were able to sing the bass solo, the piano solo and the drum part simultaneously is because you were listening real hard to these records, trying to figure out what Jazz is. I said, “Well, maybe that’s why it was natural for you to become a composer.”\n\nBLANCHARD: I never thought of that, but it’s probably true. I remember when I started listening to Clifford and Miles, it just seemed that everybody around me at that time had more of a grasp on what Jazz was and they knew more about the music and really had a love for it. I felt like I had to play catchup. So I would go home and I would listen to these records all the time, and I would play them and I’d listen to just the saxophone, then I’d go back and listen to the same song and listen to the trumpet, trying to figure out, “Wait a minute; there must be some formula to this.” The thing that was good about it was I’d started to understand how the instruments function in small groups, especially listening to Miles Davis’ band with Herbie, Ron, Tony and with George Coleman and Wayne Shorter. That band really helped me develop my interest in composition.\n\nTP: Talk about your early efforts. Did that begin more or less with the Messengers, or the Harrison-Blanchard group shortly after?\n\nBLANCHARD: No, it started in high school. I started writing some things in high school. It was funny. I remember the first time I learned about a minor chord with major seventh. I wrote a song very similar to “Chelsea Bridge,” which is kind of funny because I thought I came away with something unique, then I heard the record and I said, “Wow, that’s my song; wait a minute, it’s not mine…” [LAUGHS] But I started writing things at an early age. One of them we recorded with Art Blakey. It was a tune called, “Oh, By The Way,” which I think I had written as a junior in high school.\n\nTP: We’ll hear some soundtrack music,. We couldn’t find the CD of Shawshank Redemption, of which you think very highly , but we do have the soundtrack to Glory, composed and conducted by James Horner and performed by the Boys Choir of Harlem. A few words about both soundtracks.\n\nBLANCHARD: They’re both very unique, obviously. Shawshank I really love because I think Thomas Noonan is a very talented composer. He has a wide range of emotional tone colors at his disposal with an orchestra, and I find that to be very amazing. The score James Horner did for Glory was very unique to me, because given the subject matter I would probably have thought of a different style of music to go with the film. But I really loved the music that he chose to go with the film, and I learned a lot from this score as well.\n\n[MUSIC: Glory, “The Whipping,” “Charging Fort Wagner”; Coltrane, “Resolution”]\n\nTP: Terence Blanchard was saying that as many times as he’s listened to this record, he’s never blase. Terence was playing the drum part, the bass, singing the melody, and said this is how he gets every time he listens to Love Supreme.\n\nBLANCHARD: Yes, it has that power. It draws you right to the music. It’s very powerful. The thing I always express to young musicians about it, one of the things that’s amazing to me about it is that people listen to John Coltrane’s music, and especially drummer will listen to Elvin Jones, and I think they miss the point to a degree. When you listen to Elvin Jones, he’s playing with a lot of intensity and the music is very emotional, but he’s not playing loud and he’s not bashing on the drums. He’s playing with a lot of control. But it’s the content. That’s what draws the intensity out of the music.\n\nTP: What do you think are the sources of Coltrane’s music from which he derived the intensity that really permeates all of his playing?\n\nBLANCHARD: Well, I think he started to come in touch with something within himself. That’s the only way I can explain it. You hear stories about how he became spiritually aware of a lot of things in his life, and I think that’s the thing that really comes out in all of his music, is that searching for the truth in life. This album, and that particular cut, used to keep me up at nights when I was with Art Blakey. We would finish a show and I’d be dead tired, and I’d go back to my room and say, “Man, I’m just going to go to bed,” and I’d mess around and put this on. Next thing you know, I would listen to it literally until my batteries would wear down, because his music has such a power. You hear exactly what he’s talking about when he says, “A Love Supreme.” You just feel it immediately in his music.\n\nTP: From that, we’ll go to Ornette Coleman from 1959. Again, your first hearing Ornette Coleman, the impact it had on you, and the dynamics of the music.\n\nBLANCHARD: You know, I kind of fell into Ornette, because I was heavily into Miles Davis. I was really listening to some of the later stuff Miles did, with albums like Nefertiti and The Sorcerer and that stuff. The more I listened to that stuff and the direction they were going into, when I heard Ornette it kind of fell in place for me, because I could kind of hear where Miles was borrowing.\n\nTP: Be more explicit about that.\n\nBLANCHARD: When you listen to some of the stuff with Miles, when Miles would play his solos, sometimes the piano would lay out and Miles would try to play very free. They would manipulate the time, they would play beyond the standard swing patterns, or sometimes they would play different kinds of rhythmical patterns, and just trying to really free up the music harmonically and rhythmically. When I started listening to Ornette I heard that right away; especially in some of the stuff he did with Don Cherry, I heard the correlation. Actually it happened one night in New Orleans late one night, when I was in high school. I was driving someplace and I turned on a radio station, and they played some Ornette Coleman, and I mistook the first couple of bars of the trumpet solo for Miles Davis. I started listening closely, then I said, “Okay, this is somebody different,” who I wasn’t really aware of.”\n\nTP: Two aspects of Ornette’s quartet music is the polyphony in the front line between Ornette and Don Cherry, sort of co-composing as they’re playing, interweaving in and out of each other, and also Edward Blackwell’s ability to play extremely clear drum patterns that buttress the music, that are almost African in a certain way but come directly from the drum culture of New Orleans.\n\nBLANCHARD: Well, there’s an interesting dynamic going on with that band. Sometimes, when you listen to Ornette and Don Cherry just play the melodies, and the way that Ed Blackwell would play in between the melodies… There’s a certain language that they established with that band that was very unique unto that band that definitely influenced a lot of other people. Because some of that stuff was free. And it’s interesting to me, because I consider Ornette’s music to be very free in one sense, and very beautiful and very traditional in another sense.\n\nTP: Want to elaborate on that?\n\nBLANCHARD: Well, you definitely hear the traditions of the music. You definitely hear the traditions of Swing and Blues in Ornette’s music. But you also hear where he was dealing with some new things and expounding on those, and breaking out of certain traditions, and cutting new ground.\n\nTP: Talk about structure in your music. Do you set up everybody’s parts in your music? Talk about your compositional process?\n\nBLANCHARD: Well, sometimes for the Jazz band I may come in with set ideas. But what I’m learning to do now with the band that I have is not to do that as much. Because I really respect the musicians in the band, and I give them a chance to bring something to the compositions. For instance, on the title cut of the new album, Romantic Defiance, I wanted Troy Davis to do something very specific. I wanted more of like a military kind of drum dirge, something built around that. So I would tell him that, and I wouldn’t give him a specific pattern or anything, but that would be the instruction or pattern I’d give him, and he’d take it from there, But generally, on most of the stuff, these guys bring a lot to the music.\n\n[MUSIC: Ornette, “Peace” (1959); Joe Henderson, “Lazy Afternoon” (1968)]\n\nTP: A few words about Joe Henderson. That again raises the issue of people on other instruments influencing your style, be it instrumentally, compositionally, and so forth?\n\nBLANCHARD: Well, the thing I love about Jazz is that the instrument is one thing, but what you say with it is the thing that matters. I get inspiration from all these guys. It doesn’t matter what instrument they play. If they have something to say and something to offer that really touches me, I’ll listen and try to learn from as many people as possible.\n\nTP: Some of the people whose music we did not get a chance to play this evening were Wayne Shorter and McCoy Tyner, and you’d also chosen Dexter Gordon’s version of “Body and Soul,” and Ben Webster and Harry Sweets Edison. I know Sweets has been important to you.\n\nBLANCHARD: Definitely. I’m really sorry we didn’t get a chance to listen to that, because he’s definitely one of the pioneers in the music.\n\nTP: Finally, we’ll hear music from Romantic Defiance, the latest CD on Columbia. You’ve recently changed format, and gone from a two-horn front line to performing as trumpet with rhythm section, which is a somewhat more challenging but I guess gives you more room to stretch out.\n\nBLANCHARD: It started when we did the Billie Holiday record. When we went on tour with that we just had the quartet plus Jeannie Bryson doing the vocals. I learned a lot from that situation, and I felt it was going to give me a chance to strengthen my chops and learn more about my instrument — and that’s exactly what it’s done. So playing quartet has been challenging, but it’s also been a lot of fun for me."
