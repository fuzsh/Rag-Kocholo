        "text": "Kino Lorber Studio Classics has unveiled the details of their June 2021 Blu-Ray releases including works from such icons as Mae West, Benny Hill, Chris Rock, Dave Chappelle, Jennifer Connelly, Robert Altman, Alastair Sim, Cary Grant and more. Get all the details on this incredibly packed lineup below:\n\n[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tL0wunQtbco]\n\nTHE BLUE LAMP (SPECIAL EDITION)\n\nStreet Date: 6/1/21\n\nSynopsis: An immensely popular British crime film, The Blue Lamp was scripted by ex-policeman T.E.B. Clarke (The Lavender Hill Mob) and directed by the great Basil Dearden (Dead of Night). This classic film noir concentrates on interrelated episodes in the lives of several London policemen. A veteran cop is murdered by small-time delinquents Tom Riley (Dirk Bogarde, The Mind Benders) and Spud (Patric Doonan, The Man in the White Suit). Rookie cop Andy Mitchell (Jimmy Hanley, Radio Cab Murder), who looked up to the veteran policeman as a father figure, embarks on a perilous search to bring his mentor’s killers to justice. Shot in a pioneering semi-documentary style by Gordon Dines (Pool of London), the film focuses on ordinary heroes and a new breed of young criminal, hardened by the war years, whose recklessness and violence contrasts with the discipline of the older criminal fraternity. Jack Warner (It Always Rains on Sunday) leads a great cast featuring Robert Flemyng (The Blood Beast Terror), Bernard Lee (Dr. No) and Peggy Evans (Calling Bulldog Drummond).\n\nBonus Features: NEW Audio Commentary by Entertainment Journalist and Author Bryan Reesman | Partial Audio Commentary by Writer Jan Read and Academic Charles Barr | Locations Featurette with Film Historian Richard Dacre | BBC Radio 3 The Essay: British Cinema of the 40s – The Blue Lamp Audio Featurette | Trailers\n\nWHO DONE IT?\n\nStreet Date: 6/1/21\n\nSynopsis: Comedy legend Benny Hill (The Italian Job) stars as Hugo Dill, an inept ice rink attendant, amateur detective and extremely clumsy master of disguise. When Hugo stumbles into an international espionage plot, he’s thrown into a crazy case of mistaken identity, murderous spies, a bumbling romance with a beautiful strongwoman (Belinda Lee, It Happened in ’43) and a top-secret machine that can control the world’s weather. David Kossoff (The Mouse That Roared) co-stars in this Ealing Studios slapstick hit directed by the great Basil Dearden (Dead of Night, The Mind Benders) and written by T.E.B. Clarke (The Lavender Hill Mob).\n\nBonus Features: 4K Restoration from the Original Camera Negative | NEW Audio Commentary by Entertainment Journalist and Author Bryan Reesman | The Waiters: A 1969 30-Minute Short Film Written by and Starring Benny Hill | Trailers\n\nTHE GREEN MAN\n\nStreet Date: 6/1/21\n\nSynopsis: An irreverent black comedy adapted by Frank Launder (The Lady Vanishes) and Sidney Gilliat (Night Train to Munich) from their play Meet a Body, The Green Man marked the directorial debut of camera operator Robert Day (Tarzan the Magnificent). A scintillating Alastair Sim (An Inspector Calls) plays Hawkins, a timid watchmaker with a part-time job—he is also a professional assassin who bumps off the people we love to hate. But when pompous MP Sir Gregory Upshott (Raymond Huntley, So Evil My Love) is the intended target, bungling vacuum cleaner salesman William Blake (George Cole, Cleopatra) always gets in the way. As the time of the assassination draws even closer and Hawkins tracks his victim to a dilapidated seaside hotel called The Green Man, the laughs and the tension steadily rise to a brilliant climax. A perfect companion piece to Alexander Mackendrick’s The Ladykillers, The Green Man is an enormously entertaining farce that dutifully ticks all the genre’s expected boxes (mistaken identities, compromising positions, much panicking and slamming of doors). Co-starring comedy legend Terry-Thomas (Those Daring Young Men in Their Jaunty Jalopies).\n\nBonus Features: 4K Restoration from the Original Camera Negative | NEW Audio Commentary by Film Historian David Del Valle | Trailers\n\nCARTOUCHE (SPECIAL EDITION)\n\nSynopsis: Screen legends Jean-Paul Belmondo (Le Doulos, Le Professionnel) and Claudia Cardinale (Once Upon a Time in the West, Blindfold) star in the exciting swashbuckler Cartouche. Belmondo charms as 18th-century master thief, swordsman and rogue Louis-Dominique Bourguignon, alias Cartouche. But when Cartouche meets the beautiful bandit Venus (the luscious Cardinale), the pair launch a series of scandalous raids that rock the Parisian aristocracy. Can the most wanted man in France now steal the hearts of rich and poor alike or will he discover that true love may be the most dangerous caper of all? Jean Rochefort (The Tall Blond Man with One Black Shoe) and Jess Hahn (The Night of the Following Day) co-star in this sumptuous and surprising adventure co-written and directed by Philippe de Broca, the internationally acclaimed director of King of Hearts, That Man from Rio and Le Magnifique.\n\nBonus Features: 4K Restoration from the Original Camera Negative | NEW Audio Commentary by Film Critic and Author Simon Abrams | Adventure with a Capital “C” – Documentary with Alexandra de Broca & Journalist Thomas Morales | Theatrical Trailer\n\nLE MAGNIFIQUE – AKA THE MAN FROM ACAPULCO\n\nSynopsis: Screen greats Jean-Paul Belmondo (Cartouche, Le Doulos) and Jacqueline Bisset (The Deep, The Mephisto Waltz) star in the uproarious Le Magnifique (a.k.a. The Man from Acapulco). Belmondo plays Francois, a reclusive novelist whose wild imagination gets the best of him in this delightful blend of fantasy and adventure. Becoming the lead character from his own book, the dashing spy-hero Bob Saint-Clair, Francois is hysterically thrown into the middle of his latest espionage case, “How to Destroy the Reputation of the Greatest Secret Agent.” Only with the help of Francois’ beautiful and enticing neighbor (Bisset aptly filling the role of his seductive assistant, Tatiana) can the author save the world from his editor, who has been transformed into dastardly secret agent Karloff. Together, our duo gets caught in a hilarious whirlwind of chases, betrayals, confrontations and mutual attraction. Long before Austin Powers, this cleverly written French comedy outrageously portrays the spy game like it’s never been seen before! Co-written and directed by Philippe de Broca (That Man from Rio) and beautifully shot by René Mathelin (Max and the Junkmen).\n\nBonus Features: NEW Audio Commentary by Film Historians Howard S. Berger, Steve Mitchell and Nathaniel Thompson | Includes Both French and English Audio Tracks | Theatrical Trailer\n\nTHE RAILWAY CHILDREN\n\nSynopsis: In turn-of-the-century London, Roberta “Bobbie” Waterbury (Jenny Agutter, Walkabout, Logan’s Run) lives a perfect upper class life with her parents, sister and brother until one fateful night when her father is mysteriously arrested. Suddenly impoverished, the children and their mother are forced to move to a dusty cottage far away in the country perched on the edge of a railroad. But along these magical tracks, in the nearby station and on the mighty trains themselves, Bobbie and her siblings will discover adventure, face danger and forge friendships that will change their young lives forever. Dinah Sheridan (Genevieve) and Bernard Cribbins (Carry On Spying) co-star in this heartwarming hit based on the beloved novel by E. Nesbit (The Enchanted Castle) and filmed on location in the breathtaking Yorkshire countryside. Nominated for three British Academy Awards, The Railway Children remains one of the best-loved family classics of our time and was recently named one of the top 100 British films of the 20th century by the British Film Institute. Acting great Lionel Jeffries (The Amazing Mr. Blunden) wrote the screenplay and directed this extraordinary film for the whole family.\n\nBonus Features: NEW Audio Commentary by Filmmaker and Film Historian Paul Anthony Nelson | Theatrical Trailer\n\nTAKE THIS JOB AND SHOVE IT\n\nStreet Date: 6/15/21\n\nSynopsis: Robert Hays (Airplane!) and Barbara Hershey (Hannah and Her Sisters) co-star in this keg of laughs that never runs dry! When corporate hotshot Frank Macklin (Hays) is sent back to his hometown to upgrade the Pickett Brewery, he just wants to get in, make the changes and get back out. But once Frank has had a tall drink of refreshing down home life, instituting cold-hearted productivity increases at the plant becomes tougher. And when his bosses tell Frank his job is to betray the workers, he’ll have to act fast to save the good times… and the good brew! The excellent cast features David Keith (Heartbreak Hotel), Tim Thomerson (Trancers), Martin Mull (Clue), Penelope Milford (Coming Home), Royal Dano (The Outlaw Josey Wales), Eddie Albert (TV’s Green Acres), Art Carney (TV’s The Honeymooners) and country music legends Charlie Rich, Johnny Paycheck, David Allan Coe and more.

M. Harry Smilac (Dirk Benedict, TV’s The A-Team) is a talent agent who’d sell his mother for a dollar… fifty cents after negotiations. But Harry finally hits the big time with a rhythm-and-bruise road show that combines rock music and professional wrestling. Tanya Roberts (TV’s Charlie’s Angels) co-stars with a bevy of real-life wrestling greats including Roddy Piper (They Live), Sam “The Tonga Kid” Fatu (Highlander) and Captain Lou Albano (Wise Guys) in this raucous action-comedy from the king of death-defying Hollywood mayhem! The stellar cast also includes Barry Gordon (A Thousand Clowns), Charles Nelson Reilly (TV’s The Ghost & Mrs. Muir), Billy Barty (Foul Play), John Fujioka (American Ninja) and John Astin (TV’s The Addams Family).\n\nBonus Features: Brand New 2K Master | NEW Interview with Actor Barry Gordon | Two Theatrical Trailers\n\nCAREER OPPORTUNITIES\n\nSynopsis: Written by John Hughes, the legendary screenwriter of National Lampoon’s Vacation, Mr. Mom, Pretty in Pink, Ferris Bueller’s Day Off and Home Alone, comes this hilarious film with maximum comedy at minimum wage! The town con (Frank Whaley, The Doors) and the town beauty (Jennifer Connelly, The Hot Spot) team up to outwit a half-wit pair of would-be burglars, real-life brothers Durmot Mulroney (Young Guns) and Kieran Mulroney (Nowhere to Run). Whaley stars as Jim Dodge, a smooth-talking small-town guy with a knack for putting up a front—but no talent for holding down a job. But Jim’s life suddenly takes a turn for the fantastic when he finds himself locked inside the local department store one night with Josie McClellan (Connelly), the daughter of the town’s wealthiest citizen, and two bumbling criminals. Directed by television veteran Bryan Gordon (Curb Your Enthusiasm) and co-starring Barry Corbin (My Science Project), William Forsythe (Raising Arizona) and comedy legend John Candy (Spaceballs) in an unbilled cameo.\n\nBonus Features: NEW Audio Commentary by Chicago Critics Film Festival Producer Erik Childress | Theatrical Trailer\n\nCB4 (SPECIAL EDITION)\n\nSynopsis: Sex, Rhymes and Keepin’ It Real! Comedy superstar Chris Rock (Lethal Weapon 4, New Jack City) stars in CB4, an off the-hook, hilarious look at the world of gangsta rap. Rock plays Albert, a.k.a. MC Gusto, the leader of the hot new rap group CB4 (short for “Cell Block 4”). The trio of CB4— MC Gusto, Stab Master Arson (Deezer D, TV’s ER) and Dead Mike (Allen Payne, Jason’s Lyric)—are living large as their hardcore albums blow up the charts. Their rise to fame takes an unfortunate turn when they’re caught up as subjects of a documentary by corny filmmaker A. White (Chris Elliott, Cabin Boy) and victims of a political campaign by Republican Virgil Robinson (Phil Hartman, TV’s Saturday Night Live). And when the reality hits the streets that these cats are just three middle-class kids posing as ex-con thugs, their world of money, power and respect takes a beat-down in the most embarrassing and ludicrous ways. This outrageous “rapumentary” is packed with cameos by real O.G. rap legends like Ice-T, Flavor Flav and Easy E, and studded with special guest appearances by Tommy Davidson, Halle Berry and Shaquille O’Neal. Directed by Tamra Davis (Billy Madison, Half Baked) and co-starring Charlie Murphy (Norbit and TV’s Chappelle’s Show), CB4 is a hysterical stroll through the streets of hardcore hip-hop!\n\nBonus Features: NEW Audio Commentary by Film Historians Alexandra Heller-Nicholas and Joshua Nelson | STRAIGHT OUTTA LOCASH: Interview with Co-Writer Nelson George | STREET CRED: Interview with Director Tamra Davis | Trailers\n\nHALF BAKED (SPECIAL EDITION)\n\nStreet Date: 6/22/21\n\nSynopsis: They’ll do anything to save their best bud!

But just when the guys have mastered a plan, everything comes dangerously close to going up in smoke! Co-written by Chappelle and comedian Neal Brennan (The Female Brain) and directed by Tamra Davis (CB4, Billy Madison), Half Baked is packed with memorable performances by Rachel True (The Craft) as Mary Jane Potman, Clarence Williams III (52 Pick-Up) as the criminal kingpin Samson Simpson and stand-up comedy legend Steven Wright as The Guy on the Couch, with special appearances by Tommy Chong, Snoop Dogg, Jon Stewart, Willie Nelson, Stephen Baldwin, Tracy Morgan, Janeane Garofalo and Bob Saget.\n\nBonus Features: Audio Commentary by Director Tamra Davis | 8 Outrageous Deleted Scenes | Alternate Ending | Five Minutes with the Guy on the Couch | Different Types of Smokers | Granny’s Guide to Bakin’ | Theatrical Trailer\n\nSHE DONE HIM WRONG (SPECIAL EDITION)\n\nStreet Date: 6/29/21\n\nSynopsis: This is the story of Lady Lou (Mae West, I’m No Angel)—a bawdy nightclub singer in the 1890s, who spends most of her time tossing witty barbs at the overheated clientele. With her old man locked up in the slammer, Lou is forced to amuse herself with the legions of men fighting for her attentions. She keeps her many admirers at arm’s length, even if she does accept the generous diamond-studded gifts they bestow upon her. But the tough cookie soon finds her heart melting for a handsome young man who works at the local mission. Based on West’s play Diamond Lil, She Done Him Wrong co-stars screen legend Cary Grant (Notorious) with Gilbert Roland (Thunder Bay) and Noah Beery (Wings of the Hawk).

In addition to circus acts, Tira (West) performs some questionable business maneuvers and takes a job as a lion tamer to escape jail.
