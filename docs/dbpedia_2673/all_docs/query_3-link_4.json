With a few manuscript ink annotations, and a single copied manuscript notation to page 81 noting a single line of dialogue in Chinese. A young boy cons a friend out of a toy magnet and, consumed by guilt, donates the magnet to a man collecting items for a charity auction. The story of the boy's assumed sacrifice drives the bids for the magnet up higher and higher, and the lowly magnet begins to take on astronomical significance. Set and shot on location in New Brighton, Wirral, Cheshire, and Liverpool. Tan titled wrappers, noted as Draft Shooting Script on the front wrapper, dated 13th January, 1950. Title page present, noted as DRAFT SHOOTING SCRIPT. 100 leaves, with last page of text numbered 96. Mimeograph duplication, rectos only, with undated pink revision pages throughout. Pages Very Good plus, wrapper Very Good plus, bound with two silver brads."
