        "text": "Perhaps best remembered as Ebenezer Scrooge in A Christmas Carol, Alastair Sim became a leading star of British cinema after spending five years as a lecturer of elocution at the University of Edinburgh. Classes are now back in session, as Sim demonstrates the fine art of comedy in this hilarious 4-disc collection spotlighting his most laughter-inducing film roles.\n\nTHE BELLES OF ST. TRINIAN’S (1954, directed by Frank Launder)\n\nThe schoolgirls of St. Trinian’s are more interested in men and mischief than homework and hockey, but even greater trouble beckons with the arrival of two new students. Features Alastair Sim playing dual roles as the headmistress, Miss Millicent Fritton, and her twin brother, Clarence.\n\nSCHOOL FOR SCOUNDRELS (1960, directed by Robert Hamer)\n\nHenry Palfrey (Ian Carmichael) tries hard to impress but always loses out to the rotter Delauney (Terry-Thomas). Then he enrolls in the “College of Lifemanship” run by “Professor” Stephen Potter (Alastair Sim) and learns “how to win without actually cheating!”\n\nLAUGHTER IN PARADISE (1951, directed by Mario Zampi)\n\nPractical joker Henry Russell (Hugh Griffith) leaves 50,000 pounds to his four surviving relatives, including his cousin, retired army officer Deniston Russell (Alastair Sim). There’s just one stipulation – each of them has to undertake a task completely out of character for one month.\n\nHUE AND CRY (1947, directed by Charles Crichton)\n\nThe first of the Ealing Studios “comedies.” After discovering that his favorite comic is being used to send messages between a master criminal and his gang of thieves, teenager Joe Kirby (Harry Fowler) sets out to alert writer Felix Wilkinson (Alastair Sim) and turn the page on the crooks."
