        "text": "StudiocanalÂ has announce the release of a spectacularÂ 4K restoration of one of the most-loved British comedies from Ealing Studios,Â The Lavender Hill Mob, written by T.E.B. Clarke (winner of the Best Original Screenplay Oscar), directed by Charles Crichton (A Fish Called Wanda) and starring Alec Guinness (Kind Hearts & Coronets, The Man in The White Suit), Stanley Holloway (My Fair Lady), Sid James (the Carry OnÂ films) and Alfie Bass (Alfie).Â TheÂ enduringly funny story of a nobody bank employee’s ingenious plan to rob the Bank of England and the motley crew that he assembles to carry out the raid, will be released in UK cinemas on 29 March and as a 4K UHD Collector’s Edition and on Digital from 22 April.Â\n\nHenry Holland (Alec Guiness) has worked faithfully for 20 years as a bank transfer agent for the delivery of gold bullion. Â A shy retiring man, completely inconsequential to his employers, he has long dreamt of a way to execute his plan of the perfect gold robbery â the only catch being how to move the gold on once stolen. One day he befriends Pendlebury (Stanley Holloway), a maker of souvenirs. Â Holland remarks that with Pendlebury’s smelting equipment, he could forge the gold into harmless-looking toy Eiffel Towers and smuggle the gold from England into France. Â Soon after, the two plant a story to gain the services of professional criminals Lackery (Sid James) and Shorty (Alfie Bass). Together the four plot their crime, leading to unexpected twists and turns.\n\nOscar-winning writer T.E.B. Clarke was inspired for the screenplay, to write about a clerk robbing his own bank whilst researching jewellery heists for the filmÂ Pool of London, and he even consulted with the Bank of England on the script. The Lavender Hill Mob was memorably shot on location in the streets of the City of London, still bearing the scars of the Blitz, and by the river Seine and Eiffel Tower in Paris.Â Ranked by the British Film Institute as the 17thÂ greatest British film of all time, the film was extremely popular at the box office on its original release in 1951, and won several awards including the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay, the BAFTA Award for Best British Film, and the Best Actor Academy Award nomination for Alec Guinness.Â\n\nThe new 4K restoration release ofÂ The Lavender Hill MobÂ is part of a wider celebration by Studiocanal and UK cinemas of the Golden Age of Ealing Studios, when it was run by Michael Balcon.Â TheÂ ‘Once More with Ealing’Â season will see audience-favourites screening in cinemas, includingÂ Kind Hearts & Coronets, Whisky Galore!Â andÂ Passport to Pimlico, which all celebrate their 75thÂ Anniversary this year.Â\n\nStudiocanal will also releaseÂ Kind Hearts & Coronets on UHDÂ for the first time on 22 April, and will have lesser-known Ealing dramasÂ The Bells Go Down, Cage of GoldÂ andÂ Lease of LifeÂ released on its Vintage Classics label later in the year.\n\nThe Lavender Hill MobÂ was restored in 4K using a 35mm duplicating positive as the original negative was unavailable. Â Thanks to the latest film scanning technology and restoration tools, we were able to achieve a high standard image from the positive that was used. Silver Salt Restoration restored and colour graded the film producing a new 4K DCP, HDR Dolby Vision and HD master.\n\nThe Lavender Hill MobÂ released as a 4K UHD Collector’s Edition and on Digital on 22 April 2024, which has been priced on Amazon at Â£40.\n\n4K UHD COLLECTOR'S EDITION CONTENTS:\n\n2 discs (UHD and BD)\n\n64 page booklet\n\n2 posters - new and original artwork designed by Matt Griffin\n\n4 pop-art artcards designed by Art & Hue\n\n4K UHD COLLECTOR'S EDITION SPECIAL FEATURES:\n\nNewÂ The Perfect Heist: Benedict Morrison on The Lavender Hill Mob.Â Â Benedict is aÂ Senior Lecturer in Literature and Film at Exeter UniversityÂ and author ofÂ Eccentric Laughter: Queer Possibilities in Post-War British Film Comedy.\n\nNewÂ London Comedy Film Festival Q&A with Paul Merton\n\nThose British Faces: Stanley Holloway\n\nIntroduction by Martin Scorsese\n\nExtract from BEHP Audio interview with Charles Crichton\n\nGood Afternoon: Mavis interviews T.E.B.
