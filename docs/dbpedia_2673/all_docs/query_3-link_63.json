Somerset Maugham's original stories, along with the screenplay for each story:\n\n• \"The Ant and the Grasshopper\"—story and screenplay\n\n• \"Winter Cruise\"—story and screenplay\n\n• \"Gigolo and Gigolette\"—story and screenplay\n\nThe screenplays, written by T.E.B. Clarke, Arthur Macrae, and Eric Ambler, comprised the 1951 film Encore. The book includes film directions and details, as well as a black-and-white photographic still from each film.\n\nNote from WorldCat: Verso of title-page reads \"First published 1951\" but the book was actually published in January, 1952\n\nWilliam Somerset Maugham was born in Paris in 1874. He spoke French even before he spoke a word of English, a fact to which some critics attribute the purity of his style.\n\nHis parents died early and, after an unhappy boyhood, which he recorded poignantly in Of Human Bondage, Maugham became a qualified physician. But writing was his true vocation. For ten years before his first success, he almost literally starved while pouring out novels and plays.\n\nMaugham wrote at a time when experimental modernist literature such as that of William Faulkner, Thomas Mann, James Joyce and Virginia Woolf was gaining increasing popularity and winning critical acclaim. In this context, his plain prose style was criticized as 'such a tissue of clichés' that one's wonder is finally aroused at the writer's ability to assemble so many and at his unfailing inability to put anything in an individual way.\n\nDuring World War I, Maugham worked for the British Secret Service . He travelled all over the world, and made many visits to America. After World War II, Maugham made his home in south of France and continued to move between England and Nice till his death in 1965.\n\nAt the time of Maugham's birth, French law was such that all foreign boys born in France became liable for conscription. Thus, Maugham was born within the Embassy, legally recognized as UK territory."
