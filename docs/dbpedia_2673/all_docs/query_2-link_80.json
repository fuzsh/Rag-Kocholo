        "text": "LOS ANGELES, July 18 - Gavin Lambert, an incisive observer of life in Hollywood through his screenplays, novels and film histories, died on Sunday at a hospital in Los Angeles. He was 80.\n\nThe cause was pulmonary fibrosis, said Mart Crowley, the executor of his estate.\n\nMr. Lambert's fiction and nonfiction speak candidly about the realities of Hollywood stardom and about the potentially destructive effects of the industry's harsh demands on artistry. His sharp and often droll insights are evident in an acclaimed book of short stories about Hollywood, \"The Slide Area: Scenes of Hollywood Life,\" first published in 1959; in his novel \"Inside Daisy Clover,\" which he adapted for the screen for Natalie Wood; and in a 2004 biography, \"Natalie Wood: A Life.\"\n\nMr. Lambert became part of a close-knit circle of Hollywood stars and literary and artistic figures. In addition to Wood, his friends included George Cukor, Leslie Caron, Tennessee Williams and David Hockney. The writer and composer Paul Bowles became a friend in Tangier, where Mr. Lambert spent half of each year from 1973 to 1990.\n\nBorn on July 23, 1924, in Sussex, England, Mr. Lambert was educated at St. George's School and Cheltenham College before studying English literature at Magdalen College at Oxford University. He left Oxford after a year when he was told he would have to learn medieval English to earn a degree.\n\nMr. Lambert's first job was writing scripts for two-minute commercials shown in movie theaters; he was also writing film criticism and short stories. In 1948 he collaborated with Lindsay Anderson, a friend from Cheltenham, in founding an influential film journal, Sequence. That led to an offer from Sight and Sound, which he edited from 1950 to 1956.\n\nHe moved to Hollywood in the late 1950's to be a screenwriter and personal assistant to the director Nicholas Ray. He was a writer on Ray's \"Bitter Victory,\" and Mr. Crowley said he also did uncredited work on two other Ray films, \"The True Story of Jesse James\" and \"Bigger Than Life.\" He became a United States citizen in 1964.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
