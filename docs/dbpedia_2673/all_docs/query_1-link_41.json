        "text": "Mac Little's Collection of Flying Discs\n\nOn view: July 18, 2024 - August 31, 2024\n\nOn Thursday, August 1st, we enjoyed a collector talk and throwing demonstration with Mac Little. After learning the stories behind his discs, we head to the North Lawn where we all practiced throwing discs ourselves!\n\n“When a ball dreams, it dreams it’s a frisbee.” -Stancil Johnson\n\nI have been competitively throwing frisbees for over 15 years, which includes five glorious years playing for the University of Georgia’s club Ultimate program. Like a lot of Ultimate players, I picked up disc golf during the pandemic, which brought a completely new perspective and discipline to the art of throwing a piece of plastic.\n\nWhat unites the two flying disc sports is what we like to call “the bug”, a condition in which a new player quickly becomes obsessed with this seemingly silly activity. Symptoms of this bug include playing every chance you get, scouring the internet for any videos related to the sport (which has become exponentially easier compared to when I started), and gradually coalescing into a surprisingly large and equally infected community.\n\nI’d like to think that the last part, the community, is what is on display here at the Lyndon House. Because with community, we not only get the personal connections we make with our fellow flying disc enthusiasts, but also the rich, colorful history of what came before us. I’m aware that the words “rich”, “colorful” and “frisbee” lend themselves to strong visions of American counterculture. While that’s undoubtedly true, this collection is an attempt to showcase something a little more simple: pure, uncontaminated expression.\n\nAs the quote above so succinctly states, the flight of a football or basketball is tethered to a certain return to the ground. A flying disc? Sure, after losing its spin and momentum, it to will eventually come back to earth, but that moment of flight, glide is an inspiring parallel to what happens when we seek to express ourselves. With a little bit of aim and a pop of force and momentum, we put the disc in flight, a blatant mockery of the forces and realities of gravity.\n\nA couple of specifics on the collection:\n\nAll of the ultimate discs and memorabilia from the 1980’s were given to me by Mark Farrar, a fellow UGA ultimate alumni. I met Mark a few years ago at the annual college national championships and he just so happened to have a lot of great mementos from the early days of UGA Ultimate.\n\nThe Flying Eye Open is a disc golf tournament held at The Crucible, a legendary disc golf course just a few miles north from here. When I started playing disc golf in Athens, I had heard whispers about a course that was only available to play during the tournament. When I got a chance to play the tournament last year, I fully understood why it was held in such high regard. It’s easily one of the best courses in Georgia and my hope is that it can be fully open for play year-round some day in the future. Special thanks to Nate Wickander for loaning me past Flying Eye Open discs for this collection.\n\nMy hope is that one or two discs in this collection catch your eye and inspire you to pick up a disc (or two, three…) and marvel at the flight.\n\n-Mac Little\n\nNate Mitchell's Collection of 45 Record Boxes\n\nAbout the collection:\n\n\"My collection on display is a fine assortment of carry cases designed to fit seven-inch vinyl records, aka “singles” or \"45s,\" since they typically have one song per side and play at 45 revolutions per minute. Collecting these cases is a combination of practicality and decorative flourish. Each little box tends to have a unique color, pattern, or design and will house a specific subgenre of music (i.e., rockabilly, surf, British invasion, garage rock, soul, funk, disco, jazz, etc.).\n\n45s originated in the early 50s, and carry cases became a common accessory shortly thereafter. In the ‘50s and ‘60s, toting a box of 45s to a friend’s house was a pretty typical way for young people to share music with one another. Nowadays, I’m usually bringing one of these boxes to share my music via a DJ gig.\n\nI really like the visual aesthetic of the record labels, picture sleeves, and carry cases, as well as the extra punch of the songs themselves. 45’s play louder and hit harder than full-length albums. Portability is a plus!” -Nate Mitchell\n\nIlka McConnell's Collection of Pyrex\n\nThe Lyndon House Arts Center’s Collections from our Community features unique collections of objects found in the closets, cabinets, shelves of Athens-area citizens. This winter, we have the pleasure of hosting a variety of Pyrex casseroles and dishware from the collection of Ilka McConnell.\n\n“The delight of Pyrex began with a set of Pyrex Daisy pattern mixing bowls my Mom received from my Great-Grandmother that we used for all sorts of recipes growing up. Those cheerful yellow bowls with the little flowers have always been such a burst of sunshine in her kitchen. To outfit my first apartment after college in the late 1990s, I went to many garage sales, and scored the first gem: a small yellow Pyrex casserole dish for $3. A little blue thrift-store markdown Pyrex bowl soon joined it, and the fun had begun! Mom passed along a Mamie-Eisenhower-pink casserole dish (Pink Scroll pattern) that my Dad had discovered in the attic of our old house in Pennsylvania, which had a pink tile bathroom and pink curtains and carpet when they moved in.” – Ilka McConnell\n\nNena Gilreath's Collection of Ballet Toe Shoes\n\nNena Gilreath is a dancer and the program and facility supervisor of the East Athens Educational Dance Center. This collection will display toe shoes worn by Nena in past shows throughout her dance career.\n\n\"I have loved the art of ballet from the time I first saw a performance on PBS Dance in America. It was so beautiful and engaging. It was something that I felt I was meant to do. From the time I started taking ballet I wanted to be able to dance on my toes or sur la pointe. I always wanted to float across the stage.\n\nHere is a collection of my pointe shoes from throughout the years. I have also included a couple of pairs of my students that matriculated through Ballethnic Academy of Dance and became professional dancers in the company. They are Laila Howard and Karla Tyson. They are part of a very important legacy of providing the opportunity for women of color to dance sur la pointe and to be able to dance professionally in the Southern region and travel throughout the world.\n\nThe pointes shoes are painted skin tone or flesh tone to match the color of each individual dancer’s skin. This is the revolutionary process and innovation that came from Dance Theatre of Harlem in New York City. After years of training and performing in pink tights I was happy to change and never looked back. I shared this innovation with my students and made it a staple in the South after dancing in New York with Dance Theatre of Harlem and moving to Atlanta.\n\nThe pointe shoes in the collection are from rehearsals, and performances. Some of them are from Ballethnic’s signature ballet The Leopard Tale, in which shoes are painted to match the animals that the dancers portray in the ballet. Some of these shoes are very sentimental because they are the shoes that I wore the last time I performed certain roles in The Leopard Tale.\n\nPointe shoes are made of layers of satin, glue and cardboard and a strip of leather on the sole. In the case of my shoes, they do not contain the leather. This makes for a very light and strong shoes. Because my feet are so small, my shoes were custom made in San Francisco. Unfortunately, the maker of my shoes went out of business during the Pandemic.\n\nI feel very blessed to have realized my dream as a ballerina and to be able to share my passion with so many others.\" - Nena Gilreath\n\nFast forward to the mid-1990s and I had purchased a restored 1924 home in the Normaltown area of Athens. Needing \"nick-nacks and what nots \" to fill built-in bookcases, one afternoon in an antique store on Prince Avenue, I stumbled upon an antique typewriter. Computers had years earlier taken the place of typewriters, but the image of such an interesting piece of history caught my eye. Home with me it went, to be proudly displayed among other such curious items. From there, the collection grew. Never was it my intention to work with them, just to have them as tokens to a by-gone era I was lucky enough to be a part of, if only for a few years.\n\nInterestingly, during this same period I was restoring a 1946 Indian Chief motorcycle. Through odd twists of fate, a national vintage motorcycle publication contacted me concerning a story of the restoration. While happy to oblige, I thought what could be better than submitting a story on a vintage motorcycle restoration written on an antique typewriter! So, one of these portables was called into action! The article published, and as proud as I was about that, I was more proud to tell my friends I wrote the article on a 60s-era manual, portable typewriter.\n\nTypewriters now are as old school as sun dials, and journalists may still imagine themselves as hard-edged, chain-smoking exciting figures admired by beautiful, dangerous women. But when they enter the newsroom to sit at a computer screen to file copy, the romance ends. The silence of a keyboard will never replace the urgency and romance of a manual keyboard. At least to this hard-edged reporter!\n\nOver the years, I have added dozens of books to my collection. Some were written by former Kennedy staff members, some by historians, some by folks who never met Jackie. Many of the books are really amazing and informative, while others were just gossip.\n\nAs a History major at the University of Georgia, I took every opportunity to make Jackie the subject of my research papers. I could write pages on her impact on the American fashion industry, her work on restoring the White House, her influence on the arts, her support of historic preservation, and her role in developing the John F. Kennedy Library.\n\nWhat I learned from reading books on Jackie, is she is much more than a fashion icon, an arts patron, an historic preservationist, and defender of her husband’s legacy, she is really a survivor, literally and figuratively, who had a huge impact on our country that is still felt today.\" - Cathy Padgett\n\nCathy Padgett serves as the Community Outreach Program Specialist for the Athens-Clarke County Leisure Services Department. A native Athenian, she is a graduate of the University of Georgia with a bachelor’s degree in History. When not building her book collection you will find her antiquing, watching college football, or deciding the next documentary to watch.\n\nThe techniques and methods for making tiny things are essentially the same as full sized items. Materials include, wood, fabric, clay, metal, polymer clay, glass, and plastic. Tools are much smaller, of course; and materials are scaled down. Miniature projects encompass many scales. One inch per foot is the most popular; then ½”= 1 foot. Many miniaturists are devoted to ¼” scale. There are several quarter scale projects in the exhibit. Work is even done in 1/8” scale and smaller.\n\nInspiration is all around you in the “miniature world”: shops, shows, special occasions, the challenge of a particular skill, or fascination with a certain item. For a time, I was intrigued by small handmade bears, as small as 1/8” and as large as 2”. Suddenly, I had a collection of over 80 bears that needed a display home, thus the Lovey Bear Shop.\n\nMiniature clubs or societies as some are called exist in almost every metropolitan location in the country. This is also true internationally – especially in the EU and the Asia-Pacific region. As we have moved around the country from: Savannah, GA; Cedar Rapids, IA; Columbus, OH; Atlanta, GA; and Baltimore, MD; I have been active in a miniature group in each place we lived. It was in Baltimore that I learned to paint authentic Baltimore Screens which I painted in miniature for the domed display in the exhibit.\n\nWhen living in Atlanta during the 1980’s I became very involved in the Atlanta Miniature Society and maintain a membership today after retiring and moving to Athens in 2004. My work with miniatures continues though not on more challenging and intricate projects. I am content to do creative, fun things like a large dollhouse decorated for Christmas – completion date TBD. \" - Nancy Songster\n\n\"The real collecting began in 2020, after we received our first Covid stimulus checks! My tarot collection has grown to over 200 decks. I do not collect every kind of tarot deck. In fact, I resist owning any Rider-Waite tarot decks, of which there are many iterations now. I’m a non-conformist at heart, I suppose. I do specifically collect darker-themed decks, as I am a fan of ShadowWork —working through personal trauma as an aspect of spiritual growth and healing. I actively collect Halloween decks. I actively collect out-of-print, dark decks. I also like to collect unique, artistic decks from Etsy and Kickstarter creators. Supporting artists is important to me.\n\nI do read tarot cards. I have a preference for reading spreads that speak to the querent’s soul journey vs. the concrete aspects of the material world. I use the Tarot to help unlock the subconscious and get to the root of one’s personal and spiritual journey. I also host a Tuesday Tarot study group in my home for others who are interested in learning the esoteric meanings associated with the Tarot.\n\nWhat do crystal skulls have to do with any of this? Skulls represent death. Death in the Tarot represents change (not actual death). The skull also represents a housing unit for three of the four chakras in the energetic body: Vishuddha (throat chakra – emitted by the mouth/jaw), Ajna (third eye chakra – seat of intuition) and Sahasrara (crown chakra – connection to Source, the All That Is).\"\n\nAbout Carrie: I am an Athens resident and ACCGov employee working in the Organizational Development Division.

Every year for his birthday he received cars and trucks. For Christmas, he received cars and trucks. He inherited his grandfather’s cars. He painted his own trucks. It grew to be quite a collection: firetrucks with ladders, spinning cement mixers, Hot Wheels with doors that open, and dump trucks with hydraulic lifts. His days were filled with play and the collection grew.\n\nWinfield moved to Athens in 1988, and the cars and trucks stayed behind in Savannah.\n\nIn 2011, Winfield and his wife Winnie were visiting his home in Savannah. In the closet, under the stairs, they found his collection! Cars and trucks hidden in the closet for over 20 years waiting to be played with again! Winnie was pregnant with their son Winfield, so they decided all the cars and trucks would come back to their home in Colbert to fill the baby’s nursery.\n\nThey have been loved and regularly played with ever since, first by Winfield, then by his little brother McNeal. Some are on shelves, but not for long. There are cars and trucks under beds, in baskets, and covering the floors. Some cars and trucks even wind up in the bath or in mud puddles in the yard. All of them are unforgiving to bare feet and stubbed toes.\n\nThere are always more cars and trucks (and planes and trains) being added to the collection, such as Hess Trucks from the 1990s. But none of them are as special as the originals from Savannah.\n\nArthur Johnson’s Collection of Sharks\n\n“My shark collection began inadvertently when I was a student at UGA in the early/mid-eighties. My friend Greg Germani decided he wanted to give someone a nickname, and he decided it would be me, and he decided the nickname would be Shark, for no particular reason that he can recall now. The nickname stuck and was used often by my small circle of friends, who would occasionally give me a shark item, such as a plastic toy shark or candy dispenser or a Hot Wheels Sharkruiser. Some years later when I started touring with a band in Boston, I decided it would be a good use of my time and per diems to shop for sharks while I was on the road, and then my collection really took off. I’ve bought a lot of sharks over the years, but I’ve also been given many sharks; I think people enjoy the challenge of finding a shark I don’t own or haven’t even seen before. It’s difficult to say exactly how many shark objects and images I have, because they kind of permeate our household—besides the sharks displayed around our office, there’s shark art displayed around our house and in our backyard, and many shark-shaped kitchen utensils (bottle openers, pizza cutters), plus I’ve got storage tubs full of sharks that I don’t have room to display—but a thousand and one sharks seems like a good estimate. These are photos of a few favorites. Some are handmade: a hand-stitched pillow by Annika Tamura; a metal shark fabricated from street signs by Matt Haffner; a shark carved out of soap by Athens’ own Jennifer Hartley; a whirligig by R. A. Miller that we bought from R. A. himself back in the early ‘90s; a wire shark that I commissioned from an artist who was set up at the Harvard T stop in Cambridge; a shark from the 1970s board game JAWS that Stephen Larkworthy painted to look like Plastic Man, one of my identities as a member of Atlanta’s Box Heroes. Others I picked up during my touring days (a Fisher-Price shark flashlight I bought at a Woolworth’s in Munich’s Old Town in 1992 or 1993, a shark comb I found during a late-night stop at South of the Border) or I received from friends or family over the years (shark patches that my lifelong best friend Todd Butler collected for me, a Mark Trail cartoon that Boston artist Keith Maddy gave me, a Richard Scarry shark car that is one of many thoughtful gifts from my mom over the years). And to clarify: I don’t love sharks per se—it’s more that I love representations of sharks.”\n\n“Born and raised in Atlanta, I first visited Athens in the fall of 1978 at the age of 14, when I rode the Greyhound bus here to see my sister Carole and we attended a midnight showing of Eraserhead at the South PJ on the UGA campus and then a UGA football game the next day (I stayed at the late, lamented Downtowner in Five Points). I enrolled at UGA myself in 1982 and graduated in 1986, and then spent a few more years here having fun with my band, the Bar-B-Q Killers, before my then-girlfriend, now-wife Donna Ashley and I decided to move to Boston, where we stayed for seventeen wonderful years before moving back to Atlanta at the end of 2005. Since returning to Georgia, I’ve worked as a freelance editor/copyeditor/proofreader/permissions editor while also occasionally playing drums hither and thither with my old Boston band, Come, and with friends in Atlanta and Athens, including Ted Hafner and David Barbe.” —Arthur Johnson\n\nJulie Rutledge’s Grandparents’ Collection of Avon Bottles\n\nFebruary 2 - April 10, 2021\n\n“My grandparents, Sadie and Tom Rutledge, began collecting Avon bottles in the early 1970s. They were always interested in antiques and collecting treasures in their own attempt to preserve history. One of their past times was going to flea markets and as Sadie said, “looking at all the treasures.” Sadie and Tom were drawn to Avon bottles because they were intrigued with all the different designs and shapes.\n\nSadie and Tom found a lot of Avon bottles at J&J Flea Market and the Pendegrass Flea Market. Once they started collecting them, friends would also collect bottles so they would have many duplicates. They got a lot of bottles from an old friend who owned a junk store off 441 in Nicholson. He’d put aside any bottles he found.\n\nOvertime, my grandfather built bookshelves in the basement to store all the Avon bottles. No one ever used the fragrances. They just enjoyed looking at them. In the end, they collected more than 2000 bottles.\n\nI was in college when my grandfather died. I always enjoyed coming home to walk through the basement with my grandmother to look at all the treasures. She especially enjoyed pausing in front of the 6 bookshelves full of Avon bottles and remembering her husband.\n\nSadie died March 1, 2019. She would have been thrilled to have the Avon bottle collection on display for others to enjoy.” – Julie Rutledge\n\nJulie Rutledge is an English and ESOL teacher who took time off to raise her son. She has worked part-time at the Athens Community Career Academy for the last two years and has enjoyed working with such an ambitious and motivated group of students while also having flexibility to be home more with her son. She and her family like to be outside as much as possible, biking and walking around town. She also enjoys gardening, painting and ceramics\n\nHue and Carole Henry’s Collection of Banana Peels\n\nWhat is creativity anyway? Does it have to be lasting? Can creative moments be collected? These are some of the questions that Hue and Carole Henry’s collection of banana peel photos can bring to mind.\n\n\"The collection began with a banana and a glass of water – a daily routine while watching “Morning Joe” each day. The banana peel was initially tossed into the trash, but one day a year ago Hue, a retired local attorney active in community theater, took the peel, inverted it into the empty glass and gave it new meaning. Carole, a retired UGA art education professor and former middle school art teacher, started photographing the banana peel “sculptures” at first by themselves but then in different settings both inside and outside, sometimes in natural settings and other times with decorative objects found around the house. Some choices were governed by the weather; others by serendipitous events like the sight of a visiting friend’s bright yellow kayak, strapped to the top of their parked car.\"\n\n\"The photos served to document the act of looking at one thing (the banana peel) and seeing or imagining something else (perhaps a flower) in a way that was fun and unique. Each banana peel was different, some riper than others, and each background an unexpected juxtaposition. Seeing them all together- over 100 images in all (only 16 are included here) documents moments of creativity that are themselves ephemeral.\" - Carole Henry\n\nMichael Lachowski’s Collection of Trail Trash\n\nWhen Michael Lachowski goes hiking or backpacking he picks up trail litter. When he gets home, no matter what it may be, how much or how little, he puts it in a sandwich bag, labels it with where he went, what trail, and who he was with. Trail mix bags, lots of cigarette butts, a lead ball / bear bullet, foil, a glow stick, shotgun casings, and fishing lure. Some trails are more littered than others — one bag contains a single lollipop stick. At first the collections seem insignificant, but when you start aggregating it, something as simple as this, little pieces of trash in a bag, have a story to tell. It shows the impact of other people and Michael, wanting to be a good little camper, wants to tidy up.\n\nMichael Lachowski came to the University of Georgia to study photography in the art department back when the building was on Jackson Street near downtown. His scene was built around the art school party crowd and was intensely interested in the new music of the time, leading him and his roommate Randy Bewley to form the band Pylon. Pylon broke up after two albums and lots of touring in order to “make art again,” and all of the band chose to remain in Athens. Lachowski made art and worked at Dixons Bicycles, then opened the design agency Candy, which he also turned into a DJ store and then a clothing store for men and women. Pylon reunited twice, ending for good when guitarist Bewley died of a heart attack. Lachowski published the magazine Young, Foxy & Free in Athens and then expanding to Atlanta. In 2012 he settled down with a job doing PR for the Georgia Museum of Art at the University of Georgia.\n\nLola Brooks’ Collection of Accessories: Vintage Rhinestone Glasses, Matching Wallet Sets and Vera Neumann Scarves\n\nLola Brooks relocated to Athens from New York to be the UGA Dodd Chair in 2012 and ended up moving to town permanently. She currently lives in Farmington and makes fantastic, complicatedly layered, shimmering sculptural jewelry. This winter she shares her collection of rhinestone glasses, matching rainbow-colored wallet sets and gorgeous Vera Neumann vintage scarves.\n\nLola is an obsessive collector. Concerned that her collecting borders on hoarding, she explains that everything she has is really fabulous. So it’s not like a filthy hoarder, it’s a highly curated intentional hoarding. She meticulously organized the pieces by color and sets parameters for herself to insure the collecting does not spin out of control. For example, the glasses must come from the 60’s and 70’s and the wallets must have a matching keytainer to even be considered. Combing through the Salvation Army, trolling flea markets, and scouring ebay, Lola has amassed impressive treasures.\n\nA twenty-year-old Lola bought her first pair of vintage rhinestone glasses after being wow-ed by a woman walking down the street in New York wearing an outrageous pair. Not only did she start wearing glasses again for the first time since 4th grade (it was great to be able to see again!) it also sparked this obsession. Since then, thirty years in the making, her collection has grown to include over 150 dazzling frames and a colorful assortment of Pucci sunglasses.\n\nGrowing-up, Lola was a latch key kid and spent a lot of time on her own in a downstairs closet, digging through her mother’s purse collection. She would put on her mom’s Herb Alpert records and fill her Lady Buxton wallet with homemade credit cards and Monopoly money. Later on, in the early days of Ebay, Lola was just perusing and recalled those times in the purse closet. She searched “Lady Buxton” and thus began her rainbow collection of wallets and matching keytainers.\n\nThe scarves all designed by Vera Neumann are from the 1940’s to the 1970’s. The bold designs, heavily influenced by Japanese textiles are signed “Vera” with a little ladybug. Marilyn Monroe and Grace Kelly wore Vera scarves and First Lady Bess Truman selected Vera fabrics to decorate the third floor solarium windows and upholstery of the White House. Lola organizes the scarves by color. Only a small portion of her impressive collection is on display in the case.\n\nThe idea of building this collection is similar to building Lola’s jewelry works. This act of collecting glasses, wallet sets and vintage scarves is similar to collecting material such as the precious stones and the ivory roses used in her work. Each piece becomes a hoard in its own right, a sparkling pile, a glittering tangle.\n\nRachel Barnes' Collection of White Ceramic Cats\n\nRachel saw her first white ceramic cat in her early 20s at Agora (which is now Atomic). It was priced too extravagantly for her in those days but she began to covet these 1970’s mold-made kitties. After Lori from Dynamite gave her the first one word spread and friends started helping with her collection. Many evenings she comes home to find a new little friend waiting for her on the porch.\n\nRachel is a crazy cat lady, obsessed with cats and got that way thanks to her grandmother. It was just their thing, they loved them and for every birthday and occasion people gave them cats. Now Rachel has a bathroom dedicated to her ever growing non-white kitty collection but the white cats sit in a place of honor, where their monochromatic elegance can be appreciated, in the living room. Her husband Alfredo gets major props for not only embracing this cat colony but also helping with the interior design to feature them in their best light, in the front window.\n\nGetting to live with the cats every day, Rachel has come to notice and love the fact that despite every puss being fluffy white, having a pink nose, pink ears and blue eyes each one is so different and has such a unique personality. Even the ones that are made from the same mold- a curling eyelash, a slanted eye, a pink protruding tongue makes each figure an individual. Many of these pieces were made in the 70’s when mold-made pottery painting was the hot new fad. It’s fun to see the artist take creative license- some having more success than others at painting the features. Rachel loves the odd ones the most, the family portrait with mom and her kittens done-up with hot pink lips and Tammy Faye eyes, the runt of the litter that looks like a cross between a cat, a lamb and a demon dog and the chubby little guy with a very chunky tail and melancholy eyes framed by curled lashes. Their idiosyncrasies are intriguing.\n\nMike Landers’ Collection of Cookie Jars\n\nAs a lifelong collector of stuff, I’ve learned that collecting anything requires me to set limits on the collection -- not just things I like — but things that fall within specific criteria for being considered for the collection. There is so much stuff to collect, you’ve got to limit and define your criteria for collecting.The first cookie jar I bought was a Humpty Dumpty cookie Jar from the 1940s designed by Brush Pottery. But I realized that if I was going to collect more, I needed to narrow my selection criteria. I decided that any cookie jar that I would collect would need to be a head-shaped cookie jar.\n\nMy collection is predominantly three dimensional likenesses of familiar two-dimensional cartoon characters. It contains many of the cartoon characters that I loved when I was a kid - Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Fred Flintstone and Barney Rubble, Mr. Magoo, Pinocchio, Popeye the Sailor, Yogi Bear, and Smokey the Bear. However, I think the most interesting and strange ones are the oldest ones. I have three stoneware jars that look like newspaper cartoon illustrations from the 1930s-1940s, Oscar the Doughboy, Mustache Man and Sailor Girl.\n\nLeslie Litt’s Collection of Enamellist Society Trade Pins\n\nThese are a collection of unique pins traded by the members of the Enamellist\n\nSociety. Those that make and share their pins at the conferences are rewarded with a nice selection to take home with them. As a member of the Enamellist Society for over 14 years, Leslie Litt has gone to 6 Enamellist Society conferences, missing only the year she moved to Athens.\n\nLeslie enjoys creating a unique designs that other enamellists would want to have and trade. She has amassed quite a large collection. It is interesting to see the materials, textures and techniques that are used. Sand, plastic, mesh, copper, steel, beads, copper scrubbies, silver foil and decals are a few of the materials that are utilized. The techniques are as varied as the materials and include:\n\nembossing, form folding, Scraffito, laser printing, stenciling, Cloisonné, crackle and graphite.\n\nNot all the pins are signed but some of the more notable artists are: Leslie Perrin, Averill Shepp, Dorothy Crockell, Gail Bradshaw, Vicki Mathieu, Suzanne Kustner, Michelle Hall Scott, Judy Stone, Tixh White, Barbara Louise Bowling and Steve Artz.\n\nConnee Flynn's Collection of Angels\n\nWhen you enter into my world (my home) there are angels everywhere but you have to be aware of them. The same applies to our perception of their existence.\n\nIn the early 1950’s they started appearing in my artwork (too much imagination?). This peaked my interest.\n\nI started collecting them slowly and quietly. I brought home angels from Europe and Mexico. My family and friends noticed the collection. From there the collection grew in all manner and form.\n\nConnee Marchell Flynn, a native of New York City, began her art training in high school. She studied at the Brooklyn Museum of Art School, the Franklin School of Professional Art, The Art Students League and by invitation with graphic designer M. Peter Piening. After working for advertising agencies and a catalog\n\npublishing firm, she freelanced for several years before her marriage.\n\nConnee Flynn has lived in Athens since 1968. After her children were grown she returned to wood block printing and watercolor painting. Although her interest in all mediums remains, she finds the spontaneity of watercolors exciting and printmaking challenging. Her love of nature is apparent in her works.\n\nRich Panico's Collection of clay works from 1976-2017\n\nRich Panico began to work in clay in 1976. He started out apprenticing with Rick Berman at Callenwolde in Atlanta. His first works focused on an Oriental‪,‬ functional aesthetic in high fire and raku. An artistic community‪,‬ including Michael Simon, Bernard Leach and Michael Cardew strongly influenced his work during this time‪,‬ as well as Ron Meyers and Peter Voulkous‪,‬ who both had cultivated original voices in American ceramics‪,‬ while preserving strong links to both Oriental and European traditions. These friendships inspired a six year period of creative experimentation of which only a few pieces remain.\n\nFrom the beginning, Panico's artistic undertakings have been interwoven with a career in medicine. By the early 80's the demands of his medical practice pushed clay work into a back seat. In 1990, Panico developed an auto-immune disorder which was not adequately diagnosed until 2012. Ironically, this created an opportunity to better balance and create a more reflective life in which, by necessity he was forced to become comfortable with \"living in the questions.”\n\nNena Gilreath's Collection of Barbies\n\nBarbie ballerinas, princesses, brides and clad in their commemorative holiday gowns, East Athens Educational Dance Center Supervisor, Nena Gilreath, shares her collection with us.\n\n\"I Am Black Dance because I live dance through my heritage, though my ancestry, & through my art. Black Dance is creative. It's colorful.\" -Nena Gilreath\n\nMrs. Gilreath is a graduate of the North Carolina School of the Arts where she received a Bachelor of Fine Arts in Dance. She began her career by moving to Atlanta and joining the Ruth Mitchell Dance Theatre. She later joined the Dance Theatre of Harlem, touring nationally and internationally. In 1988, Ms. Gilreath returned to Atlanta to dance with the Atlanta Ballet. Finally, on January 15, 1990, along with husband and choreographer Waverly T. Lucas, II they created Ballethnic Dance Company. She has implemented numerous outreach programs including the BUDDY Project through the Atlanta Project, which served as a model for the existing Danseur Development Project. Ms. Gilreath currently serves as co-founder and co-artistic director of Ballethnic Dance Company and Ballethnic Academy of Dance. She received the 2008 Atlanta NAACP President’s Award for their positive influence on today’s youth.\n\nEric Krasle's Collection of Athens Area Dug Bottles\n\nThis collection is representative of more than 30 years of digging bottles. The collection includes a large chemical bottle (circa mid 1800’s) that is one of a set recovered by Jeffrey Weinberg from what was once the Crawford W. Long Apothecary in Athens, GA on Broad Street. Also in the collection is a medicine bottle that was produced specifically for the Harris Drug Company of Athens. It is a rare surviving example of the once common practice of specifically “minting” bottles for local drug stores. The photograph of the Harris Drug Company depicts the “Just what the Doctor ordered” script that matches the embossing on the bottle.\n\nAn original non-decorative Athens-embossed Bludwine bottle which contained a cherry flavored soda is from approximately 1930. A name change to Budwine was the result of censorship pressure by fundamentalists in Athens, included is an early Budwine bottle from just after the “l” was removed. Among the many Coca-cola bottles in the collection is a straight-sided embossed Athens, Georgia bottle that was produced in the early 1900’s and a gold “hobbleskirt\" edition.\n\nJeff Montgomery's Collection of Floaty Pens\n\n&\n\nKatherine Winslow's Collection of Push Puppets\n\nFloaty pens, are those delightful tourist souvenir picture scenes of landmarks.\n\n“While on a foreign study program with Furman University that ventured in part to Israel in the winter of 1994, I stumbled across \"The Last Supper\" floaty pen somewhere along the way. I found this floaty pen so endearingly kitschy with its sliding loaf of bread and wine that I purchased it on the spot.” – Jeff Montgomery\n\nPush Puppet are wonderful spring loaded figures that dance when you press the bottom of their platform stage.\n\n“I’ve been collecting push puppets for years, and have found them throughout the United States and in Europe in toy stores, restaurants and gift shops. Among my 49 push puppets is an alien figure from Roswell, N.M., “Pinocchio” from Rome, a royal guard from London, and the Krtek (“little mole”) cartoon character from Prague.” – Katherine Winslow"
