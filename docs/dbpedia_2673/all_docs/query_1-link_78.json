        "text": "Curated by leading academics from the University of Sussex and partner institutions, in collaboration with the BBC, 100 Voices and Connected Histories of the BBC is an AHRC funded project that shines a light on the hidden stories of broadcasting.\n\nBelow are the key people featured in the project, originally divided into eight collections: Entertaining the UK, The BBC and the Cold War, The BBC and World War Two, Pioneering Women, People, Nation, Empire, Radio Reinvented, The Birth of TV, and Elections.\n\nThe final 100 Voices, Inventing the Future is now published.\n\nThe BBC Oral History Project\n\nProfessor David Hendy outlines the unique value of oral history, and its longstanding importance at the University of Sussex. He explains how the 100 Voices collections reveal unique insights about the BBC, as well as uncovering the changing relationship between the broadcaster, the cultural life of the UK, and the wider world. Image: Tim Stubbings Photography / AHRC.\n\nSearch the Collections\n\nSearch the Collections around key historic themes.\n\nYvonne Adamson\n\nYvonne Adamson began her BBC radio career in 1945 as a reporter in North Region, part of the BBC to which she remained committed for the rest of her working life. Originally based in Newcastle she developed a love for the North-East in particular where she believed there wasnât a \"living soul\" who didnâtâ have âsomething original, something interesting to relate\".\n\nJohn Ammonds\n\nJohn Ammonds always dreamt of working in radio comedy. He approached the BBC in 1941 with a speculative letter offering himself up as a junior engineer. He was asked if he would be interested in becoming a sound effects operator. For the next 13 years he could be found in the BBC's variety department. A move to television in 1968 saw Ammonds become one of the main producer/directors for Morecambe and Wise.\n\nDoris Arnold\n\nDoris Arnold was the BBCâs first woman music presenter, on-air from 1938. Arnold joined the BBC in 1929, as a typist, but was interested in live radio. Her first radio appearance was as stand-in for a pianist who was unwell. Those You Have Loved was her first programme, where she played light classical recordings. The programme ran until 1977. Picture shows Doris Arnold with fellow pianist.\n\nDavid Attenborough\n\nDavid Attenborough initially approached the BBC for a position in radio talks programmes for which he was rejected. However the BBC Television Service showed interest in him and after a three-month training course, Attenborough joined the BBC staff in 1952. By the early 1960s he had become Controller, BBC Two (1965-69), and then pursued a freelance career, presenting and producing iconic award winning series such as Life on Earth (1979), and A Perfect Planet (2021).\n\nJoan Bakewell\n\nAward winning journalist and presenter Joan Bakewell became nationally known when she appeared as one of the main presenters for Late Night Line-Up, a television review programme seen on the fledgling BBC Two channel (1965â72 and 2008). She was one of the very few serious women television journalists on air in the 1960s, and was dubbed \"the thinking man's crumpetâ by comedian Frank Muir, such was the level of sexism amongst male colleagues at the time. She has since enjoyed a prolific career as a writer, commentator and communicator.\n\nElisabeth Barker\n\nElisabeth Barker (1910 - 1986) was a diplomatic correspondent for the BBC throughout the 50s and 60s, where her intimate knowledge of Eastern Europe was invaluable. Barker started in the news library in 1934, and was a sub-editor during the War. She was there in June 1940 when General de Gaulle delivered his historic broadcast.\n\nEdward Barnes\n\nEdward Barnes made Blue Peter a TV reality, and was the programme's assistant director, later moving on to produce the series. Barnes was also the mastermind behind children's television news programme Newsround, in April 1972. He became the head of BBC children's programmes for eight years until 1986.\n\nDonald Baverstock\n\nDonald Baverstock began his BBC career in the BBC television talks department, producing regular live magazine programmes such as Tonight. From 1961 he moved into BBC management as BBC Assistant Controller of Programmes, responsible for the Television Service. He also devised the long running religious programme Songs of Praise.\n\nBruce Belfrage\n\nBruce Belfrage was a familiar voice on the BBC as a newsreader and announcer. He started in the early days of radio but achieved fame on the night in 1940 when a bomb went off in Broadcasting House. Belfrage was on air at the time but carried on as though nothing had happened.\n\nAnthony Wedgwood Benn\n\nAfter graduating from New College, Oxford (M.A., 1949), Tony Benn worked as a BBC radio producer (1949-50). He was first elected to Parliament in 1950, and renounced his peerage in 1963. He was Postmaster General (1964), Secretary of State for Industry, and Secretary of State for Energy (1975-79).\n\nJana Bennett\n\nJana Bennett joined the BBC News Trainee Scheme in 1979, and started her career producing news for Look North (Newcastle) and Radio Sheffield.
