        "text": "My local cinema has closed‚ùóÔ∏èA very sad day indeed for a regional picture house that has been running for 96 years. (It is just over half hours drive to this town from my location). Many people will be sad to see this iconic venue no longer operating. Statement provided to The Ballarat Courier: \"It‚Äôs with a great amount of sadness that we have taken the decision to cease operations effective immediately. We have arrived at this point after a great deal of consideration and as result of a number of factors that have contributed to the heart breaking decision to close the business. We would like to thank the Ballarat community for their support over the years. \" Further information will become available (via other media) in the days to come. Management, Regent Cinemas Here is a little history from our exhibition ~ Hoyts‚Äô Regent opened on the 31st March, 1928, with Adam and Evil (Robert Z. Leonard, 1927) and The Magic Flame (Henry King, 1927). The opening night programme lavishly described the new 1,950 seat cinema as the ‚Äútheatre palatial‚Ä¶ scintillating in all its beauty, fascinating in all its splendour, bewildering in all its mightiness.‚Äù In July 1929, the theatre was refitted to screen sound pictures, the first cinema in Ballarat to show the ‚Äòtalkies.‚Äô The theatre was gutted by fire on the 15th January, 1943, with only the fa√ßade surviving. The Courier reported that large numbers of ‚Äústrangers to Ballarat‚Äù were reportedly smoking in the dress circle, and rumours swirled that U.S. Forces stationed in town were to blame. While the theatre was rebuilt, Hoyts‚Äô smaller 600-seat Plaza Theatre on Camp Street screened the Regent‚Äôs first-run films. The Regent reopened on the 14th October the same year, with the war film, In Which We Serve (Noel Coward and David Lean, 1942). Hoyts‚Äô operated The Regent for 43 years, screening their last film on May 22nd, 1971. In 1975, the Regent was taken over by Village Theatres (Ballarat), led by John ‚ÄòJack‚Äô Anderson. Anderson had been running the Astor in Ararat, the Vegas ‚Äô70 at the Ballaarat Mechanics‚Äô Institute, and by this time controlled the two drive-in cinemas in Ballarat. Anderson refurbished the historic Regent with modern comforts, while retaining the cinema‚Äôs historic aesthetic. For the lobby, Anderson salvaged the chandelier from the recently closed Hoyts‚Äô Esquire theatre in Melbourne, formerly the Hoyts De Luxe, which had opened in 1915. The Regent had its grand reopening on November 11th 1976, with the epic Gone with the Wind (Victor Fleming, 1939), attended by a contingent of suitably costumed interpreters from Sovereign Hill. The Regent closed again for much of 1988 to convert the historic single-screen theatre into a three-cinema multiplex, the first in regional Victoria. In 1996, the theatre was expanded to six cinemas, and in 2015 to nine screens. ‚ù§Ô∏è üçø\n\nCHITTY CHITTY BANG BANG The book was based on bedtime stories #ianFleming told his son about a race car with magic powers. The car, was supposedly named after the Zborowski vehicles, assuming the name Chitty Chitty Bang Bang because it was noisy BUT if you continue to read through to the end I will give you the origins of the title. In Fleming‚Äôs version of the story, Chitty Chitty Bang Bang is the beloved car of the Potts family. After some loving restoration, Chitty Chitty Bang Bang is transformed. The car, which seems to have nearly human senses, has the ability to sprout wings, become a hovercraft, and/or even track down some pretty nefarious kidnappers. While Fleming lived to finish the book, he never saw it published. Fleming had died two months earlier. On his son‚Äôs 12th birthday‚Äîthe son who inspired the story behind the movie that even today, is loved by so many other children. As Ian Fleming came up with the TITLE from his knowledge of the armed forces. When soldiers were granted leave from the barracks they were given a ‚Äúchit‚Äù for a limited period of time. The most usual reason the soldier wanted to have his chitty was to be with a woman for intimate relations. This was commonly known as ‚Äúa bang‚Äù back then. He combined the words together chitty chitty bang bang which he thought was rather amusing. Not many people know this background information. üòÄ"
