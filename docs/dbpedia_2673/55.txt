A warm and affectionate tribute to the London metropolitan police in the daily performance of their duties is cleverly interlaced with a good running crime melodrama of a conspicuously realistic sort in the British-made film, "The Blue Lamp," which came to the Park Avenue Theatre yesterday. Full of fresh human interest touches, as well as honest admiration for the police, this film combines lively entertainment with a solid chunk of social argument.So congenial and familiar is this picture in its initial approaches, indeed, that it early assumes the characteristics of a documentary about the police. And one might suspect at the beginning that it is going to be one of those jobs describing the London "bobby," his life, his workâ€”and no more. For the initial personality introductions and accumulation of pictorial evidence are centered around the "bobbies" of the station at Paddington Green, with quaint glimpses of their mundane duties and their prosaic habits at home.And in this limited area, the camera's observations are such as to stimulate genial amusement and arouse little expectation of any more. There's the "bobby" who knows the neighborhood children and has a hobby of raising flowers; there's the one he and his wife take in as lodger. And there's the station-house choral group. The pungent flavor of a London police station, marked by the traditional "blue lamp," is in this film.But then the accumulation of a compounding act of crime, committed by a pair of juvenile hoodlums assisted by a neighborhood girl, is smartly insinuated; and the first thing the bland observer knows, the whole film is racing pell-mell in the toils of a manhunt and chase, with one of our favorite "bobbies" murdered and the force, including detectives, in pursuit.T. E. B. Clarke has written a most fluid and cleverly jointed script and Basil Dearden has directed it in a stunningly naturalistic style. Especially is a sizzling wind-up in White City Stadium, with the killer pursued among the patrons and the bookies at a dog-racing meet, executed with fascinating demonstration of local atmosphere.And a large cast of excellent actors has been handled beautifully, with such well-known performers as Jack Warner and Robert Flemyng doing modest roles. Mr. Warner, Jimmy Hanley and Meredith Edwards are notably good as uniformed police, and Mr. Flemyng and Bernard Lee (of "The Third Man") do detectives excellently. Dirk Bogarde is unhealthy and malevolent as the leader of the juvenile gang, with Patric Doonan and Peggy Evans playing his associates well.This film was produced by Michael Balcon as a national service, obviously. But it was one of the most popular pictures to show in Britain last year, and it well deserved that popularity. It should meet with limited but warm success here.
