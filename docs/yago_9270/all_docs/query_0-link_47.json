She had given a noteworthy performance in James Whale’s cult classic Old Dark House (1932, an adaptation of J. B. Priestley’s Benighted) with Charles Laughton, Raymond Massey and Boris Karloff. She had played opposite Claude Rains in The Invisible Man (1933); as the ingénue in Gold Diggers (1935); and in Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm (1938) with Shirley Temple."
