        "text": "Ada\n\nMississippi-born writer Wirt Williams learned firsthand about the underbelly of Louisiana politics during his 1946–49 stint as a reporter for The New Orleans Item. His exposés for that paper unearthed corruption in state government and earned him a Pulitzer Prize nomination. Williams subsequently transitioned from journalist to novelist, obtaining a Ph.D. in English from the University of Iowa and accepting a teaching position at Los Angeles City College. His novel Ada Dallas, which brought another Pulitzer nomination, drew upon his Louisiana experiences, telling the story of a woman who puts herself through college working as a prostitute, has an affair with a television reporter, marries a man who becomes governor, and maneuvers herself into becoming the state’s first female chief executive, eventually imposing martial law.\n\nProducer Lawrence Weingarten (under his Avon Productions banner) acquired the film rights to Ada Dallas for M-G-M six weeks prior to its publication by McGraw-Hill on October 29, 1959. Weingarten initially pursued Elizabeth Taylor to take on the lead role, but after BUtterfield 8 the actress had had her fill of playing a prostitute (and was relieved to be finished with her M-G-M contract, in order to star in Fox’s Cleopatra). While Weingarten did not snag BUtterfield 8’s star, he did employ its director, Daniel Mann; by August 1960, Susan Hayward and Dean Martin were also on board, with Arthur Sheekman adapting the novel for the screen.\n\nIn December 1960, M-G-M shortened the title of the picture from Ada Dallas to simply Ada, in deference to the 1937 Samuel Goldwyn production Stella Dallas. Consequently, the story’s governor became “Bo Gillis.” The changes to the novel’s scenario did not stop there. The final script, credited to Sheekman and TV writer William Driskill, moved the timeframe from the present day to 1936, the location from Louisiana to an unnamed Southern state (near Alabama) and transformed the novel’s dark plot into a Capra-esque story wherein “regular folks” elected to office outwit machine politicians.\n\nThe film’s Ada (Hayward) is an experienced call girl hired to entertain guitar-strummin’ Collins County sheriff—and gubernatorial candidate—Bo Gillis (Martin) for an evening. The two unexpectedly hit it off, and before long Gillis proposes to—and elopes with—Ada, sparking consternation among his advisors, from cynical-but-honest speechwriter Steve Jackson (Martin Balsam) to corrupt political boss Sylvester Marin (Wilfrid Hyde-White). After concocting a fake biography for the candidate’s new wife, Marin engineers a Gillis victory through underhanded dealings spearheaded by Col. Yancey (Ralph Meeker), chief of the state police, who openly expresses his lust for Ada. Once ensconced in the governor’s mansion, Gillis finds himself a mere figurehead; when he and his reform-minded lieutenant governor, Ronnie Hallerton (Frank Maxwell), challenge Marin’s shady backroom dealings, the political boss responds by blackmailing Hallerton into resigning his post. After Ada finagles her way into an appointment as Hallerton’s replacement, Gillis lands in the hospital when an assassination attempt nearly claims his life. Gillis turns on Ada, thinking she conspired with Marin in the failed plot; meanwhile, after assuming the role of acting governor, Ada wastes no time in proving her husband wrong.\n\nAlthough most of the filming took place on M-G-M’s lot in Culver City, the cast and crew did venture 400 miles north to Sacramento in February 1961 to shoot scenes in the rotunda of the California State Capitol. While other productions had used exterior shots of the capitol building, Ada was the first to film inside the structure. The original schedule called for the location work to coincide with a legislative recess, but delays resulted in the shooting taking place alongside Assemblymen at work and other routine goings-on. On one occasion, filming paused due to a previously scheduled performance by two college choirs, prompting the studio timekeeper to record the cause of the delay as a “choral break.”\n\nEven though Hayward’s previous collaboration with Mann and Weingarten had resulted in an Oscar nomination—for 1955’s I’ll Cry Tomorrow (FSMCD Vol. 7, No. 13)—her by-the-numbers performance in Ada generated considerably less acclaim. Martin proved to be at home playing the folksy candidate, but had little to do during the latter half of the picture, while Variety offered that Balsam, Meeker and Maxwell provided “[e]ffective key support” in their limited roles. The performance that drew the most attention from critics was that of Wilfrid Hyde-White: many reviewers noted that, while he was horribly miscast (his British accent keeps poking through an affected Southern drawl), he stole the picture with his smiling malevolence. Time wrote that the actor “dominates the audience as a waving cobra captivates a mouse,” while Philip K. Scheuer in the Los Angeles Times found him “miscast yet he succeeds in giving the film’s sharpest performance.” On the other hand, Joseph Morgenstern in the New York Herald-Tribune deemed the British actor “utterly and wildly wrong for the part,” failing to believe him as “a Southern political boss and not a raffish Englishman who walked into the wrong studio.”\n\nMany critics also pointed out one glaring anachronism: the use of a portable tape recorder as a key plot point late in the film. Another of the picture’s touches possessed more verisimilitude, however: a song crooned by Martin early on, “May the Lord Bless You Real Good.” A 1957 composition by Wally Fowler and Atlanta disc jockey Warren Roberts, the tune had actually been used during a 1958 Alabama gubernatorial campaign. Fowler and a group called the Sons of Song accompanied candidate A.W. Todd across the state during the Democratic primary, singing patriotic and religious selections at each stop. The Todd campaign printed a songbook with some of these tunes, and a May 5, 1958, Life photo essay even included an excerpt from “May the Lord Bless You Real Good” along with a picture of Fowler and his fellow musicians in action. Fowler later recorded the song with the Oak Ridge Boys Quartet (a group he founded, later famously known simply as the Oak Ridge Boys).\n\nComposer Bronislau Kaper, reuniting with director Daniel Mann after BUtterfield 8, employed the Fowler-Roberts tune in his main title and—sparingly—in other cues later in the picture. Kaper’s original contributions center on his theme for Ada, introduced as source music early in the film. Mack David later added lyrics to the theme to create a song called “Ada,” although apparently no singer ever recorded the vocal version. Leroy Holmes, however, did include an arrangement of the theme (featuring wordless chorus) on his album Leroy Holmes & His Orchestra Play the Love Theme From Lolita and Other Movie Favorites (MGM SE 4064), which Billboard described as “[s]olidly musical and easy on the ear all done with gloss and polish.”\n\nAs Variety noted in its review of the film, “Bronislau Kaper’s score is unobtrusive, except for the burst of campaign parade melody under the titles that deserves to be heard.” The low-key approach works quite admirably, offering dramatic support when needed, but otherwise staying out of the way during numerous drawn-out dialogue scenes. Jack Mollitt in Limelight wrote that “Bronislau Kaper’s score heighten[s] the emotional values” of the film, while James Powers in The Hollywood Reporter merely stated: “Bronsilau Kaper’s music is an asset.”\n\nWhile the Ada CD program groups the non-Kaper source music together in a bonus section following the main score presentation, the track-by-track analysis below discusses the cues in film order."
