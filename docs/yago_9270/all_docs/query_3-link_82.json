For sheer scope, guts and beauty I can think of no picture... to compare with it.

You'll relish the whole thing. - Kansas City Star\n\nRead More | Posted Nov 09, 2022\n\n99%\n\nThe Shop Around the Corner (1940) The boy and the girl story is surrounded by the life of the store which is revealed through a set of characters whom you'll love and recognize as the friends and heel of your workaday life. - Kansas City Star\n\nRead More | Posted Nov 07, 2022\n\n91%\n\nStalag 17 (1953) A truly remarkable job has been done in toning down Stalag 17 from the stage version while preserving the rowdy profane humor as well as the melodrama which made this play a solid Broadway hit. - Kansas City Star\n\nRead More | Posted Nov 05, 2022\n\n96%\n\nShanghai Express (1932) If you want a lot of film for your money, stay through to the end. If you prefer quality to quantity, get up when they fade out the scene of Anna May Wong playing solitaire. - Kansas City Star\n\nRead More | Posted Oct 21, 2022\n\n79%\n\nThe Rogue Song (1930) The Rogue Song cannot be put down as one of the best Laurel-Hardy efforts, but it cart be said these two funny men accomplish their purpose of balancing Mr. Tibbett's fine singing with lampoonish tricks that are sure-fire audience appeal. - Kansas City Star\n\nRead More | Posted Jun 29, 2022\n\n92%\n\nVertigo (1958) Alfred Hitchcock tops his own fabulous record for suspense with Vertigo, a super-tale of murder, madness and mysticism that stars James Stewart and Kim Novak. - Hollywood Reporter\n\nRead More | Posted May 13, 2022\n\n88%\n\nFrom Here to Eternity (1953) From Here to Eternity is more than just an absorbing story. It is essentially a montage of human emotions, intermingling the passions of love, hate, brutality and courage to such an extent that at times they are indistinguishable to the principals. - Kansas City Star\n\nRead More | Posted Mar 17, 2022\n\n77%\n\nWhite Christmas (1954) It will be a poor showman who can't get an audience into the theatre when he can base his sales talks upon such expertly assembled and tangible box office ingredients. - Hollywood Reporter\n\nRead More | Posted Dec 20, 2021\n\n99%\n\nHis Girl Friday (1940) The smartest and most sophisticated piece of entertainment in a week that is notable for its high entertainment average. - Kansas City Star\n\nRead More | Posted Oct 14, 2021\n\n100%\n\nThe Philadelphia Story (1940) It was a great play and it's even a better picture. - Kansas City Star\n\nRead More | Posted Jun 10, 2021\n\n93%\n\nGold Diggers of Broadway (1929) Gold Diggers of Broadway has enough plot to keep it interesting.

An \"Undersea Ballet\" permits the use of technicolor to a spectacle sequence. - Kansas City Star\n\nRead More | Posted Mar 06, 2021\n\n81%\n\nThe Private Life of Helen of Troy (1927) [The Private Life of Helen of Troy] should cause dancing in the streets, and old men to throw away their canes. - Kansas City Star\n\nRead More | Posted Jan 05, 2021\n\n86%\n\nConvention City (1933) The laughs are fast and raucous.

It's a little early to announce the results of this experiment. But she and Mr. Wilde have a bedroom scene that really arouses emotion and that, they tell me, is the primary intention of acting. - Esquire Magazine\n\nRead More | Posted Nov 04, 2020\n\n78%\n\nThe Bachelor and the Bobby-Soxer (1947) It's one of the happiest of the season's comedies and as appropriate to August relaxation as a mint julep and a porch swing. - Esquire Magazine\n\nRead More | Posted Oct 21, 2020\n\n100%\n\nGreat Expectations (1946) The British director, David Lean, is the real star of this offering.

It comes pretty close to being the perfect comedy. - Esquire Magazine\n\nRead More | Posted Oct 21, 2020\n\n67%\n\nBlue Skies (1946) Bing Crosby, Fred Astaire and Joan Caulfield are the inhabitants of this fictional vacuum, and do their best to blow into it a breath of life. Fortunately, their best is pretty good. - Esquire Magazine\n\nRead More | Posted Oct 07, 2020\n\n--\n\nShock (1946) A vast studio like Twentieth Century-Fox... seldom can afford to experiment. But, when the budget is held down and young blood is called in, it is interesting to note that even so unwieldy an organization can achieve a rather dull imitation of Gaslight. - Esquire Magazine\n\nRead More | Posted Oct 07, 2020\n\n100%\n\nThe Jolson Story (1946) The Jolson Story says that most show people have the same struggles, the same desire for a home, and the same love of family that motivate other Americans. - Esquire Magazine\n\nRead More | Posted Oct 07, 2020\n\n--\n\nFiesta (1947) You'll find much to like in this tuneful and relaxing Technicolor musical. - Esquire Magazine\n\nRead More | Posted Oct 07, 2020\n\n40%\n\nThe Two Mrs. Carrolls (1947) The play kept experienced theatergoers on the edge of their seats. The picture will keep them on the edge of a nervous breakdown. - Esquire Magazine\n\nRead More | Posted Oct 07, 2020\n\n--\n\nDear Ruth (1947) The hit play becomes a mediocre picture. You can't blame the script. Arthur Sheekman's screenplay retains almost all of Krasna's good dialogue. - Esquire Magazine\n\nRead More | Posted Oct 07, 2020\n\n--\n\nThe Perils of Pauline (1947) The picture is a triller as well as a thriller, with a bang-up score written by Frank \"Praise The Lord and Pass the Ammunition\" Loesser. - Esquire Magazine\n\nRead More | Posted Oct 07, 2020\n\n78%\n\nMy Favorite Brunette (1947) It's full of gags and it doesn't try to sabotage anything -- except gloom. In fact it's just the sort of \"escapist\" entertainment that the Communists find \"subversive.\" Let those who will enjoy it. I did. - Esquire Magazine\n\nRead More | Posted Oct 07, 2020\n\n100%\n\nThe Farmer's Daughter (1947) The Farmer's Daughter is an honestly liberal movie with no concealed jokes. It is thoroughly democratic and thoroughly entertaining. - Esquire Magazine\n\nRead More | Posted Oct 07, 2020\n\n76%\n\nBoomerang! (1947) The picture is a masterpiece of suspense. Dana Andrews gives another fine performance as the ethical prosecutor. Arthur Kennedy is excellent as the prisoner. Lee J. Cobb is splendid as an honest cop, and Sam Levene does outstanding work as a reporter. - Esquire Magazine\n\nRead More | Posted Oct 07, 2020\n\n--\n\nWelcome Stranger (1947) Arthur Sheekman's screenplay is full of funny situations and dialogue. Unlike the screen version of The Late George Apley, Sheekman's screenplay gets its regional laughs not by burlesque and character, but by shrewd interpretive humor. - Esquire Magazine\n\nRead More | Posted Oct 07, 2020\n\n--\n\nIt Happened on 5th Avenue (1947) There's nothing very original about either the theme or the plot. The idea of a poor man being rich in all-that-matters is as old as is the notion that rich men can be spiritually poor. Yet Del Ruth blends these clichés into a minor masterpiece. - Esquire Magazine\n\nRead More | Posted Oct 07, 2020\n\n--\n\nThe Other Love (1947) A chic sadness pervades The Other Love. With the aid of Barbara Stanwyck, David Niven, and a smoothly tailored script, the producer makes death seem fashionable, if not popular. - Esquire Magazine\n\nRead More | Posted Oct 07, 2020"
