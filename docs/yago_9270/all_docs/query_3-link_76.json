        "text": "It isn't a very weighty subject that is being casually kicked around in M-G-M's \"Young Man With Ideas,\" which came to the Globe yesterday, and there doesn't appear to be much confidence in the way it is being shown. But this cheerful and unpretentious flurry of straight domestic farce has a lot more to recommend it than you'll find in some of the studio's heavier, gaudier films.In the first place, it has an elastic and pleasingly written script, knocked out by Arthur Sheekman, that is tangled with gay, amusing twists. What Mr. Sheekman is pondering is the plight of a young married man who is badly restricted by shyness in his pursuit of a legal career and who sometimes is pushed a bit too rudely by his loving but ambitious wife. It's a slight tale, a candid contrivance, but it is blessed with a germ of common sense and it is studded with lively situations. That's the first score for the film.Then it is lifted by direction of a measuredly careless, off-beat sort that clips you with sudden droll surprises and for which Mitchell Leisen takes the bow. And, at last, it is played with seeming relish by a comparatively second-flight cast that appears to be thoroughly delighted to have something bouncy to do.Glenn Ford as the diffident lawyer who limpidly smirks his way through life until suddenly he is faced with the necessity of being aggressive in defending himself in a knockabout trial is amazingly cock-eyed and loose-jointed for a fellow whose previous toils have been mostly in grimvisaged dramas and down-by-the-dump action films. And Ruth Roman, also a sad-sack in most of her previous deploys, cuts some adroitly agile capers as the gentleman's hard-driving wife.Nina Foch as a lady law student who makes a bold, sexy pitch for the gent is also insidiously beguiling, and Denise Darcel is jovial and broad as a nondescript cafe entertainer from whom the fellow tries to collect a bill. Sheldon Leonard is comic in a brief bit as a standard hard-boiled gambling-racket mug and a little girl named Donna Corcoran makes something real out of the lawyer's eldest child.In the shade, with the light behind it, this little picture might compare to \"The Marrying Kind.\" It is that close to something unsual. At least, it is a pleasant surprise.\n\nYOUNG MAN WITH IDEAS, screen play by Arthur Sheekman; directed by Mitchell Leisen; produced by Gottfried Reinhardt and William H.
