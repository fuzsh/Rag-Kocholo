        "text": "Oscar-nominee Gloria Stuart, who played Old Rose in \"Titanic,\" had died at age 100.\n\nStuart, whose film career began in the 1930s, was diagnosed with lung cancer several years ago, according to her daughter Sylvia Thompson. Early in her career, she starred in such films as \"The Invisible Man,\" \"Roman Scandals\" and \"The Prisoner of Shark Island.\"\n\n\"Titanic\" earned Stuart her first and only Oscar nomination in 1998. At 87, she was at the time the oldest Oscar-nominee in history.\n\nBorn in Santa Monica, Calif., Gloria attended the University of California at Berkeley and was married twice. Her first marriage to Blair Gordon Neill lasted from 1930 to 1934.\n\nLater in 1934, she married Arthur Sheekman. The pair were together until his death in 1978."
