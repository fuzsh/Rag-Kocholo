        "text": "You probably are not aware of it but you and I have a completely different conception of me. You regard me as a kind of ancient crone--a talkative old chatterbox who upon the receipt of any kind of news--no matter how trivial--breathlessly rushes out to broadcast it to the world at large. I, on the other hand, regard myself as a mute stoic, silent as the Sphinx--a graven image, who, even if burning fagots were applied to his bare feet, would never reveal the slightest information to anyone. Perhaps I fit somewhere between these two poles.\n\nThe husband who wants a happy marriage should learn to keep his mouth shut and his checkbook open.\n\nGROUCHO MARX, attributed, Wise Words and Quotes\n\nI find television very educational. Every time someone switches it on I go into another room and read a good book.\n\nGROUCHO MARX, attributed, Halliwell's Filmgoer's Companion\n\nI'm not crazy about reality, but it's still the only place to get a decent meal.\n\nGROUCHO MARX, attributed, Philosophy on the Go\n\nFrom the moment I picked up your book until I put it down, I was convulsed with laughter. Some day I intend reading it.\n\nGROUCHO MARX, letter to S. J. Perelman\n\nHumor is reason gone mad.\n\nGROUCHO MARX, attributed, The Laughter Prescription\n\nPolitics is the art of looking for trouble, finding it everywhere, diagnosing it incorrectly and applying the wrong remedies.\n\nGROUCHO MARX, attributed, Try and Stop Me\n\nIn Hollywood, brides keep the bouquet and throw away the groom.\n\nGROUCHO MARX, attributed, The Ultimate Book of Quotations\n\nMarriage is the chief cause of divorce."
