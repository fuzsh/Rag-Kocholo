        "text": "Some Came Running, American dramatic film, released in 1958, that was especially noted for the performances by Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin—in their first screen pairing—and Shirley MacLaine.\n\nThe film follows Dave Hirsh (Sinatra), a famous writer who returns to his small hometown in Indiana after serving in World War II. Once there he discovers that he is still the local black sheep, ostensibly welcomed by the pretentious townspeople but secretly resented by everyone, including his estranged brother (played by Arthur Kennedy). Much of the film centres on Hirsh’s juggling his love affairs with both “good girl” Gwen (Martha Hyer) and the fun-loving Ginnie (MacLaine). Hirsh ultimately marries Ginnie, but their happiness is short-lived, as her ex-boyfriend (Steven Peck) returns and fatally shoots her.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nOscar-Worthy Movie Trivia"
