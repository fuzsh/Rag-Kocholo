        "text": "We'll never let go of the love we have for the epic 1997 film Titanic, which told the tale of the ill-fated \"unsinkable\" ship through the fictionalized stories of people on board, most notably Kate Winslet's wealthy Rose and Leonardo DiCaprio's scrappy Jack. Since its release (and subsequent re-releases), the James Cameron-directed film has made more than $2.2 billion at the box office, and continues to hold a place in pop culture history thanks to its beloved stars, heartbreaking storyline and breathtaking cinematography.\n\nThe ship itself — which sank in the Atlantic Ocean after hitting an iceberg on April 15, 1912 — is still an obsession for many, with the wreckage quite intact two miles below sea level and a tourism industry around it growing (though controversially).\n\nHere, ensure your heart will go on by catching up with the film's stars, then and now.\n\n01 of 11\n\nKate Winslet (Rose DeWitt Bukater)\n\nThe better question is where hasn't Winslet been? In the decades since Titanic's release, she's become one of the most respected actresses in Hollywood. She won an Oscar in 2008 for The Reader (that is, after racking up five other nominations — and one more since then), as well as Golden Globes in 2022 for Mare of Easttown, 2016 (for Steve Jobs), 2012 (Mildred Pierce) and two in 2009 (The Reader and Revolutionary Road, which saw her teaming up with her Titanic costar Leonardo DiCaprio) and Emmys in 2011 for Mildred Pierce and 2021 for Mare of Easttown. At the encouragement of her kids, she joined Titanic director James Cameron for the second installment of his Avatar franchise, Avatar: The Way of Water (2022).\n\nWinslet is married to businessman Edward Abel Smith (legally known as Ned Rocknroll from 2008 to 2019), and has three children: Mia, Joe and Bear. Though she's a long way from her Titanic days, she's still super close with DiCaprio, who walked her down the aisle at her wedding to Smith and whom she still speaks fondly of during interviews.\n\n02 of 11\n\nLeonardo DiCaprio (Jack Dawson)\n\nLike Winslet, DiCaprio's career took off after Titanic, and he became a frequent collaborator of famed director Martin Scorsese, starring in several of Scorsese's movies like The Departed, Gangs of New York and The Aviator. After four Oscar nominations as an actor (and an additional one as a producer), DiCaprio finally won his long-awaited Oscar in 2016, for the film The Revenant, with Winslet cheering him on throughout awards season. He was nominated again for an Oscar for his role in 2019's Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood. DiCaprio led a star-studded cast as an astronomy professor in Adam McKay's apocalyptic satire Don't Look Up (2021) and joins fellow Scorsese regular Robert De Niro in the director's 2023 crime drama, Killers of the Flower Moon.\n\nWhen he's not making movies, DiCaprio is a vocal activist for taking action on climate change, speaking at the United Nations and hosting an annual auction to raise money for the cause. (And at the Saint-Tropez event in 2017, he reunited with Titanic costars Winslet and Billy Zane.)\n\n03 of 11\n\nBilly Zane (Caledon Hockley)\n\nHe played Rose's rich but unlikable fiancé in Titanic, but in real life, Zane isn't quite so evil. Since the movie's release, he's been acting consistently, churning out multiple projects a year, like the film The Believer (with Ryan Gosling) and on TV in Charmed, Community and The Boys. He also took to the stage for a stint on Broadway in Chicago. Oh, and he played himself in Zoolander and Zoolander 2 as well as in a Titanic-inspired cameo in the comedy Holmes & Watson.\n\n04 of 11\n\nKathy Bates (Molly Brown)\n\nBy the time Bates starred in Titanic as the \"unsinkable\" Molly Brown, she was already an Oscar winner (in 1991, for Misery). After the film wrapped, she continued to star in screen success after screen success, like Midnight in Paris, About Schmidt, Richard Jewell and Revolutionary Road, which reunited her with Winslet and DiCaprio, and earned an additional three Oscar nominations.\n\nBates has embraced television with great results, thanks to her talked-about roles in shows like Harry's Law, The Office, American Horror Story, Feud and Disjointed. She's had some personal health battles, too: she was diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2003, and breast cancer in 2012, but has beaten both diseases.\n\n05 of 11\n\nBill Paxton (Brock Lovett)\n\nPaxton was already pretty well-known by the time he appeared in Titanic, due to his roles in blockbusters like Aliens, Terminator, Twister and Apollo 13. Titanic was just another success on the list, which continued with movies like Mighty Joe Young and Edge of Tomorrow. He also starred in the HBO series Big Love, about a polygamist family in Utah, for five seasons and was featured on Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. Sadly, he died after facing complications during surgery in February 2017.\n\n06 of 11\n\nFrances Fisher (Ruth DeWitt Bukater)\n\nStage veteran Fisher has been working on-screen since Titanic, in Laws of Attraction (with Julianne Moore), Jolene (with Jessica Chastain), Woman in Gold (with Ryan Reynolds) and Awake (with Gina Rodriguez). In 2017, she appeared in an episode of Fargo with her daughter Francesca Eastwood — they played older and younger versions of the same character. After that, Fisher appeared in episodes of Watchmen, The Rookie and The Sinner. She's politically active, too, and was a supporter of Senator Bernie Sanders's first presidential campaign.\n\n07 of 11\n\nGloria Stuart (Old Rose)\n\nStuart earned an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actress for Titanic at 87 years old, making her the oldest-ever acting nominee, a title she held until 2018 when Christopher Plummer was nominated at age 88 for All the Money in the World (Stuart is still the oldest-ever nominated actress). She even won the Screen Actors Guild Award for the same category, tying with Kim Basinger.\n\nThough the height of her career was during her younger years, in the 1930s, Stuart still acted into her 90s, in films like The Million Dollar Hotel and in the soap opera General Hospital. Her last role, in the film Land of Plenty, was in 2004. She died of respiratory failure in 2010 at age 100.\n\n08 of 11\n\nVictor Garber (Thomas Andrews)\n\nGarber, who played ship creator Thomas Andrews in Titanic, is one of those actors who seems to be in everything. A few of his select credits? Tuck Everlasting, Legally Blonde, Milk, Argo, Sicario and Happiest Season, as well as Alias, Eli Stone, Legends of Tomorrow, Web Therapy, The Orville and Family Law on TV. He's a close friend of Jennifer Garner from their Alias days, and is the godfather of her eldest child, Violet. Garber has been nominated for six Emmy Awards, including in 2005 for a guest appearance on Will & Grace. A prolific stage actor, he returned to Broadway in 2018 as the replacement for Horace Vandergelder in the Tony Award-winning revival of Hello, Dolly!.\n\n09 of 11\n\nDanny Nucci (Fabrizio)\n\nJack's best friend may not have made it off the Titanic, but his real-life counterpart has fared much better. Nucci has been working steadily, particularly on television, popping up on shows like NCIS, CSI, Arrow and Castle. From 2013 to 2018 he starred in the Freeform series The Fosters and has since appeared in The Offer, Dynasty and 9-1-1. He's also been married to fellow actress Paula Marshall since 2003.\n\n10 of 11\n\nDavid Warner (Spicer Lovejoy)\n\nWarner's character, Lovejoy, had an ironic name, as he was one of the least joyful characters in the entire movie. However, Warner could crack a smile. After Titanic, he appeared in films like Planet of the Apes, Black Death and Mary Poppins Returns, which was his final film role.\n\nWarner died on July 22, 2022 of a lung cancer-related illness at the age of 80.\n\n11 of 11\n\nSuzy Amis (Lizzy Calvert)\n\nFor Amis, who played Lizzy Calvert, Rose's great-granddaughter, Titanic was one of her last acting roles before quitting acting entirely in 1998.\n\nHowever, she's not too far away from Hollywood, as she has been married to Titanic director James Cameron since 2000 (the couple met on the film's set). Since then, she's focused on activism, spearheading initiatives like Red Carpet Green Dress, focusing on sustainable fashion, and Food Choice Task Force, which aims to show how eating meat can impact the environment."
