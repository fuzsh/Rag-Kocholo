        "text": "LOS ANGELES — Gloria Stuart, a 1930s Hollywood\n\nleading lady who earned an Academy Award nomination for her first\n\nsignificant role in nearly 60 years — as Old Rose, the centenarian\n\nsurvivor of the Titanic in James Cameron’s 1997 Oscar-winning film — has died. She was 100.\n\nStuart, a founding member of the Screen Actors Guild\n\nwho later became an accomplished painter and fine printer, died Sunday\n\nnight at her West Los Angeles home, said her daughter, writer Sylvia Thompson.\n\nStuart had been diagnosed with lung cancer five years ago.\n\n“She also was a breast cancer survivor,” Thompson\n\nsaid, “but she just paid no attention to illness. She was a very strong\n\nwoman and had other fish to fry.”\n\nIn July the actress was honored at an “Academy Centennial Celebration With Gloria Stuart” at the Samuel Goldwyn Theater in Beverly Hills.\n\nAs a glamorous blond actress under contract to Universal Studios and 20th Century Fox in the 1930s, Stuart appeared opposite Claude Rains in James Whale’s “The Invisible Man” and with Warner Baxter in John Ford’s “The Prisoner of Shark Island.”\n\nShe also appeared with Eddie Cantor in “Roman Scandals,” with Dick Powell in Busby Berkeley’s “Gold Diggers of 1935” and with James Cagney in “Here Comes the Navy.” And she played romantic leads in two Shirley Temple movies, “Poor Little Rich Girl” and “Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm.”\n\nBut mostly she played what Stuart later dismissed as\n\n“stupid parts with nothing to do” — “girl reporter, girl detective,\n\ngirl nurse” — and “it became increasingly evident to me I wasn’t going\n\nto get to be a big star like Katharine Hepburn and Loretta Young.”\n\nAfter making 42 feature films between 1932 and 1939, Stuart’s latest studio contract, with 20th Century Fox, was not renewed. She appeared in only four films in the 1940s and retired from the screen in 1946.\n\nBy 1974, “the blond lovely of the talkies” had become an entry in one of Richard Lamparski’s “Whatever Happened to” books.\n\nWriter-director Cameron’s $200 million “Titanic” changed that.\n\nStuart played Rose Calvert, the\n\n100-year-old Titanic survivor who shows up after modern-day treasure\n\nhunters searching through the wreckage of the sunken ship find a\n\ncharcoal drawing of her wearing a priceless blue diamond necklace.\n\nStuart’s performance as Old Rose frames the 1997 romantic-drama that starred Leonardo DiCaprio as lower-class artist Jack Dawson and Kate Winslet as the upper-class young Rose.\n\nIn “Gloria Stuart: I Just Kept\n\nHoping,” her 1999 autobiography, Stuart said that after reading the\n\nscript, “I knew the role I had wanted and waited for all these many\n\nyears had arrived! I could taste the role of Old Rose!”\n\nCameron told the Los Angeles Times in a 1997\n\ninterview that he chose Stuart because he was “looking for a pro from\n\nthe ’30s or ’40s, someone probably retired, maybe off the Hollywood radar for awhile.”\n\n“I had to have someone who’d play the latter part of the life of someone we’d recognize, Kate Winslet, so it couldn’t be someone like Katharine Hepburn.\n\nWe know so well what she looked like (when she was young),” Cameron\n\nsaid. “Gloria had just enough distance, and she gave this fantastic\n\nreading.”\n\nAt 87, Stuart became the oldest actress ever nominated for an Academy Award.\n\nIn addition to Oscar and Golden Globe nominations,\n\nshe won a Screen Actors Guild award for outstanding performance by a\n\nfemale actor in a supporting role (tying with eventual Oscar-winner Kim Basinger for “L.A. Confidential”).\n\nIn the multiple-Oscar-winning blockbuster’s wake,\n\nStuart found herself swamped with fan mail and interview requests. She\n\nalso was faced with being recognized in the supermarket and finding her\n\nold films resurfacing on television. People magazine even named her one\n\nof the 50 most beautiful people in the world.\n\nIn 2000, several hundred fans gathered on Hollywood Boulevard next to the Egyptian Theater for the unveiling of Stuart’s star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.\n\n“I cannot begin to tell you how rewarding and\n\nnourishing and warming it is,” she said at the ceremony. “I wake up\n\nevery day and say, ‘What a wonderful life. How lucky I am.'”\n\nA third-generation Californian, she was born Gloria Stewart in Santa Monica on the Fourth of July,\n\n1910. She later changed the spelling of her last name to Stuart,\n\nreasoning that the six letters would balance perfectly on a theater\n\nmarquee with the six letters in “Gloria.”\n\nWhile attending the University of California, Berkeley, where she acted in a campus theatrical group, Stuart met a handsome young sculptor, Gordon Newell. They were married in 1930 and moved to Carmel, where she appeared in little theater productions.\n\nIn 1932, after playing Masha in a little theater production of Chekhov’s “The Seagull” in Carmel, the visiting director asked her to play the role again in a small theater in the Los Angeles area.\n\nCasting directors from both Paramount and Universal saw her performance and offered her screen tests. She wound up signing a seven-year contract with Universal.\n\nStuart’s union activities began while making Whale’s 1932 horror comedy “The Old Dark House” with Boris Karloff and Melvyn Douglas.\n\n“All of us were just exhausted by the long hours, and Melvyn Douglas leaned over to me in this theatrical way,” she recalled in a 1998 Times\n\ninterview. “He whispered the word ‘union’ in my ear. And I thought,\n\n‘Yes!'”\n\nDespite stiff studio resistance, the Screen Actors Guild was founded in 1933.\n\nDiscovering that she “took to politics like a duck\n\nto water,” Stuart helped form the Hollywood Anti-Nazi League in 1936,\n\nthe same year she and writer Dorothy Parker helped\n\norganize the League to Support the Spanish War Orphans. She also became\n\na member of the Hollywood Democratic Committee and was on the executive\n\nboard of the California State Democratic Committee.\n\nStuart’s fledgling movie career took a toll on her\n\nmarriage to Newell and they divorced. In 1934, she married screenwriter\n\nArthur Sheekman, with whom she had her daughter Sylvia.\n\nStuart, whose career at Universal failed to take off, signed with 20th Century Fox in 1935.\n\nAfter Fox declined to renew her contract in 1939, she acted in summer theater on the East Coast and made a failed attempt at Broadway before returning to Hollywood and turning her creative energies into the art of decoupage.\n\nIn 1954, inspired by an exhibition of Impressionist paintings in Paris, she began painting. Her first one-woman show, at the Hammer Galleries in New York in 1961, was a critical hit. She went on to have exhibits in major galleries.\n\nIn 1975, four years after her husband was stricken\n\nwith Alzheimer’s disease, Stuart decided to return to acting. From 1975\n\nto 1988, she had about a dozen minor roles on TV and in movies,\n\nincluding dancing with Peter O’Toole in a nightclub scene in the 1982 film “My Favorite Year.”\n\nAs her husband became ill, Stuart began taking\n\nclasses in bonsai. She became an honored member of local bonsai clubs,\n\nand her trees are in the bonsai collection at the Huntington Library,\n\nArt Collections and Botanical Gardens in San Marino, Calif.\n\nFive years after Sheekman’s death in 1978, Stuart renewed a friendship with an old friend from her college years: Ward Ritchie,\n\nwho had become a world-renowned master printer. The friendship quickly\n\ngrew into an autumn romance. From Ritchie, Stuart developed an interest\n\nin fine letter-press printing and bought her own hand press.\n\nShe devoted much of her time to designing and\n\nprinting artists’ books (handmade, letter-press printed books in\n\nlimited editions, with her own artwork and writing). Her work is in the\n\nJ. Paul Getty Museum in Los Angeles, the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City, the Victoria and Albert Museum in London and other museums.\n\nBesides her daughter, Stuart is survived by four grandchildren and 12 great-grandchildren.\n\n———\n\n(c) 2010, Los Angeles Times.\n\nVisit the Los Angeles Times on the Internet at http://www.latimes.com/.\n\nDistributed by McClatchy-Tribune Information Services."
