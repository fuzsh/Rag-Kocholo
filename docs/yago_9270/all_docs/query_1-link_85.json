        "text": "GLORIA STUART, AN ACTRESS REDISCOVERED LATE\n\nBy ALJEAN HARMETZ and ROBERT BERKVIST\n\nPublished: September 27, 2010\n\nGloria Stuart, a glamorous blond actress during Hollywood’s golden age who was largely forgotten until she made a memorable comeback in her 80s in the 1997 epic “Titanic,” died on Sunday at her home in Los Angeles. She was 100.\n\nHer daughter, Sylvia Vaughn Thompson, confirmed the death.\n\nMs. Stuart had long since moved on from Hollywood when James Cameron, the director of “Titanic,” rediscovered her for the role of Rose Calvert, a 101-year-old survivor of the ship’s sinking. She was 86 at the time.\n\nHer performance earned her an Academy Award nomination, for best supporting actress. It was her only Oscar nomination, and she was the oldest person ever to receive one for acting. (She lost to Kim Basinger.)\n\nRose’s wistful recollections of a love affair aboard the ship as it headed for disaster on its maiden voyage form the frame of “Titanic.” Kate Winslet, who was nominated for best actress, played the character as a young, well-to-do, romantically restless passenger in first class who falls in love with a poor would-be artist in steerage, played by Leonardo DiCaprio. The movie won 11 Oscars and was the top-grossing film of all time until it was overtaken in 2009 by “Avatar,” also directed by Mr. Cameron.\n\nAudiences in 1997 had little if any memory of Ms. Stuart’s early screen career, but it had been substantial: a total of 46 films from 1932 to 1946. She abandoned movies, she said, after growing tired of being typecast as “girl reporter, girl detective, girl overboard.”\n\n“So one day, I burned everything: my scripts, my stills, everything,” she told The Chicago Tribune in 1997. “I made a wonderful fire in the incinerator, and it was very liberating.”\n\nIn the best of her early movies, Ms. Stuart, a petite and elegant presence, was forced to seek shelter with Boris Karloff in James Whale’s classic horror film “The Old Dark House” (1932) and was horrified when Claude Rains, her mad-scientist fiancé, tampered with nature in “The Invisible Man” (1933), also directed by Whale.\n\nShe was James Cagney’s girlfriend in “Here Comes the Navy” (1934), Warner Baxter’s faithful wife in John Ford’s “Prisoner of Shark Island” (1936), Shirley Temple’s cousin in “Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm” (1938) and the spoiled rich girl who falls in love with penniless Dick Powell in “Gold Diggers of 1935.”\n\n“Few actresses were so ornamental,” John Springer and Jack Hamilton wrote in “They Had Faces Then,” a book about the actresses of the 1930s. “But ‘undemanding’ is the word for most of the roles she played.”\n\nAfter a small role in the limp 1946 comedy “She Wrote the Book,” Ms. Stuart had had enough and left the film world, not to be seen again until she appeared in a television movie almost 30 years later.\n\nAlthough Screen Play magazine had called Ms. Stuart one of the 10 most beautiful women in Hollywood, she was more than a pretty face. She was a founding member of the Screen Actors Guild and helped found the Hollywood Anti-Nazi League, an early antifascist organization.\n\nAfter she left Hollywood, Ms. Stuart taught herself to paint. In 1961 she had her first one-woman show, at Hammer Galleries in New York.\n\nIn 1983 the master printer Ward Ritchie taught her to print, and she started a fresh career as a respected designer of hand-printed artists’ books and broadsides. She produced illustrated books and broadsides under her own imprint, Imprenta Glorias, including “Haiku,” “Beware the Ides of March” and “The Watts Towers.”\n\nMs. Stuart and Mr. Ritchie also began an autumn romance that lasted until Mr. Ritchie’s death in 1996 at the age of 91. Her print work is in the collections of the Getty Museum in Los Angeles and the Victoria and Albert Museum in London.\n\nGloria Frances Stewart was born in Santa Monica, Calif., on July 4, 1910, two years before the Titanic sank. When she started in movies, Ms. Stuart wrote in her autobiography, “I Just Kept Hoping” (Little Brown, 1999), a collaboration with her daughter, she shortened “Stewart” to “Stuart” “because I thought — and still do — its six letters balanced perfectly on a theater’s marquee with the six letters in ‘Gloria.’ ”\n\nShe attended the University of California, Berkeley, where she met her first husband, the sculptor Gordon Newell. Settling in Carmel, Calif., in 1930, she and Mr. Newell joined a bohemian community that included the photographer Edward Weston and the journalist Lincoln Steffens. Ms. Stuart acted at the Golden Bough Theater and wrote for a weekly newspaper.\n\nIn 1932 Mr. Ritchie, who was Mr. Newell’s best friend, drove her to Pasadena, where she had been offered a role at the prestigious Pasadena Playhouse. “The morning after I opened in Chekhov’s ‘The Sea Gull,’ ” Ms. Stuart remembered, “I signed a seven-year contract with Universal.”\n\nSoon came movies like “The Girl in 419” (1933), in which she played a mysterious woman who witnesses a murder. Her social circle included Dorothy Parker, Robert Benchley and other New York intellectuals who had settled at the Garden of Allah hotel while writing and acting in movies. An excellent cook whose oxtail stew with dumplings was praised by M. F. K. Fisher in her book “The Gastronomical Me,” Ms. Stuart liked to cook Sunday dinners for them.\n\nMs. Stuart and Mr. Newell divorced in 1934; later that year she married Arthur Sheekman, a screenwriter who worked on Marx Brothers movies.\n\nAfter Ms. Stuart gave up on Hollywood, the Sheekmans sailed around the world and settled in New York. She had a daughter with Mr. Sheekman and later moved to Italy with them and started to paint. Mr. Sheekman died in 1978.\n\nBesides her daughter, Ms. Thompson, Ms. Stuart is survived by four grandchildren and 12 great-grandchildren.\n\nMs. Stuart made brief returns to film and television acting in the 1970s and had a cameo role in the 1982 film “My Favorite Year,” in which she danced with Peter O’Toole, who starred as a worn-at-the-edges film idol.\n\nBut it was “Titanic,” 15 years later, that made Ms. Stuart a celebrity again. She was interviewed on television, invited to Russia for the opening of the movie there and chosen by People magazine as one of the 50 most beautiful people in the world. Her newfound fame resulted in more film and television work into her 90s.\n\nIf she had been more famous as an actress, Ms. Stuart might never have won the role of Rose Calvert; Mr. Cameron wanted a lesser-known actress for the part, one who, as Ms. Stuart said in a 1997 interview, was “still viable, not alcoholic, rheumatic or falling down.”\n\nMs. Stuart was so viable that it took an hour and a half each day to transform her youthful 86-year-old features into the face of a 101-year-old woman.\n\nWhen the script of “Titanic” was sent to her, Ms. Stuart told The Chicago Tribune, she thought, “If I had been given plum roles like this back in the old days, I would have stayed in Hollywood.”\n\nSOURCE\n\n***********************************************************\n\nBUDDY COLLETTE, MUICIAN WHO PLAYED WITH JAZZ GREATS\n\nBy DENNIS HEVESI\n\nPublished: September 29, 2010\n\nBuddy Collette, a jazz saxophonist, flutist, clarinetist and bandleader who blended his usually soothing, often pungent sounds with those of many jazz greats and who was a leader in the struggle to break racial barriers in the music industry, died on Sept. 19 in Los Angeles. He was 89.\n\nThe cause was complications of pneumonia, said his son, Robert.\n\nMr. Mantell was a familiar figure on television beginning in the 1950s, appearing in guest roles on numerous series — dramas including “Alfred Hitchcock Presents,” “Wanted: Dead or Alive,” “The Twilight Zone,” “The Defenders,” “Mission: Impossible” and “Lou Grant”; and situation comedies like “My Three Sons,” “Maude” and “Barney Miller.” In the early ’60s he had a regular role on the comedy “Pete and Gladys,” and in the late ’60s he had a recurring part on the detective drama “Mannix.”\n\nIn the movies he appeared in “Onionhead,” with Andy Griffith, and “The Sad Sack,” with Jerry Lewis. In “The Birds,” Hitchcock’s classic horror film about avian madness in a California town, he played a traveling salesman who advises, “Kill them all!”\n\nBut he was probably best known for playing a couple of sidekicks. In “Marty,” the Oscar-winning 1955 film adapted by Paddy Chayefsky from his own teleplay about a lonely Bronx butcher (Mr. Borgnine) and his search for love, Mr. Mantell played the title character’s best pal, Angie. Angie began almost every conversation with the same question — “What do you feel like doin’ tonight?” — and always got the same answer: “I don’t know, Ange. What do you feel like doin’?”\n\nFor Mr. Mantell, who was nominated for an Oscar himself for best supporting actor, it was actually a reprise; in the television play, broadcast live in 1953, he had played Angie opposite Rod Steiger.\n\nIn 1974, Mr. Mantell appeared in the celebrated nouveau-noir sleuth film “Chinatown” as Walsh, an associate of Jake Gittes (Mr. Nicholson), a private eye who becomes embroiled in a complex mess involving water rights, incest and murder. It was a small role for Mr. Mantell, made notable by his final line, also the final line of the film, which was set in the Los Angeles of the 1930s. Gittes, shaken by the violent conclusion of events (which takes place in the sorry neighborhood that gives the film its name) is encouraged to go home and take it easy.\n\n“Forget it, Jake,” Walsh says. “It’s Chinatown.”\n\nJoseph Mantel was born in the Greenpoint section of Brooklyn on Dec. 21, 1915. His parents were immigrants from Poland who ran a butcher shop. He served in the Army during World War II and, some time between his discharge and his film debut, in 1949, he changed his name, adding an “l” and altering the pronunciation from “MON-tle” to “man-TELL.”\n\nIn addition to his work onscreen, Mr. Mantell was also a stage actor whose credits included a Broadway musical, “Buttrio Square,” in 1952. Two decades later he appeared in a post-Broadway tour of “Twigs,” a play by George Furth that starred Sada Thompson in a Tony-winning performance.\n\nIn addition to his son, who lives in Lancaster, Calif., Mr. Mantell is survived by his wife, Mary; two daughters, Jeanne, of Encino, and Cathy, of Studio City, Calif.; a grandson and a step-grandson.\n\nSOURCE\n\n*************************************************************\n\nSTEPHEN J. CANNELL, PROLIFIC TV WRITER\n\nBy BILL CARTER\n\nPublished: October 2, 2010\n\nStephen J. Cannell, one of television’s most prolific writers and series creators, whose work encompassed the “The Rockford Files” and “Wiseguy” to “The A-Team” and “The Greatest American Hero,” died Thursday at his home in Pasadena, Calif. He was 69.\n\nThe cause was complications from melanoma, his family said.\n\nFor 30 years, beginning in the early 1970s and extending through the 1990s, television viewers could hardly go a week without running into a show written by Mr. Cannell. His writing credits include more than 1,000 episodes of various series, primarily crime dramas, and he is listed as the creator of almost 20 series — some long-running hits like “The Rockford Files,” and “The Commish,” others quick flame-outs like “Booker. ” At one point in 1989, Mr. Cannell’s company was producing five series on three networks. One of them, “21 Jump Street,” introduced a future Oscar nominee to public acclaim: Johnny Depp.\n\nBut that was not unusual. Mr. Cannell’s shows often opened doors for emerging actors. Jeff Goldblum gained his first wide notice in a short-lived but well-remembered Cannell series, “Tenspeed and Brown Shoe.” And “Wiseguy” gave another future Oscar winner, Kevin Spacey, a chance to stand out in a memorable extended turn as a villain.\n\nMr. Cannell, who regarded his writing less as an art than a craft to which he was both committed and devoted, never writing less than two hours a day, shifted late in his career to crime novels and again proved he had a popular touch. Several of his 16 books, many featuring the detective Shane Scully, were best sellers.\n\n“Most of my things strike to the same theme,” Mr. Cannell said in an interview this year in Success magazine, “which is not to take yourself so seriously that you can’t grow.”\n\nIn many ways Mr. Cannell’s own success mirrored the formula he repeated in so many of those episodes. It was a three-act, feel-good story of overcoming debilitating flaws.\n\nBorn Feb. 5, 1941, in Los Angeles, to an affluent family (his father owned an interior design business), Mr. Cannell suffered from extreme dyslexia, which went undiagnosed and all but ruined his school years. Despite inheriting his family’s intense work ethic, he failed three grades and was unable to retain a football scholarship to the University of Oregon because of his academic record.\n\nBut a professor there recognized his writing gifts and encouraged him. Once he tried to break into television writing, Mr. Cannell quickly found he had a knack for its basics. He was fast and dependable. From early work on shows like “It Takes a Thief” and “Toma” he graduated to more serious efforts, like a script for the notoriously demanding “Columbo.”\n\nHe was successful and happy, unlike many of his Hollywood writing contemporaries. He married his grade-school sweetheart, Marcia Finch, in 1964. She survives him, along with two daughters, Tawnia and Chelsea; a son, Cody; and three grandchildren.\n\nIt was while banging out a script for “Toma” that Mr. Cannell created a character named Jim Rockford. Like Rockford, Mr. Cannell often pointed out, his lead characters were flawed men who somehow found a way to get the right thing done.\n\nRockford was an ex-con turned reluctant detective who would rather crack wise than fight. The series, which was a hit for seven seasons, has since been credited with helping to signal a cultural shift away from the perfect physical and moral specimens of the movies and early television and toward more realistic heroes, the kind viewers had come to expect, given the harder-edged reality they saw on the evening news.\n\n“Culture changed, and as that happened, so did our need for a hero,” Mr. Cannell said in a 1999 interview. “That square-jawed good guy began to look like an idiot to us.”\n\nRockford also introduced another staple of Mr. Cannell’s best work: humor. His shows tended to be leavened either with wry comedy, which so fit the performing style of that show’s star, James Garner, that he seemed inseparable from the role, or extremely broad comedy, typified by “The A-Team,” the loud, seemingly mindless action series that ran for five years in the mid-’80s, all but saving the NBC network in the process. That series included big set-piece action sequences with explosions and crashing vehicles — and people were hardly ever killed.\n\nCritics and viewers often questioned how a show like that, and other Cannell titles like “Riptide, “Renegade” and the late-night series “Silk Stalkings” could spring from the same mind that created a complex, groundbreaking crime drama like “Wiseguy,” which has often been cited as a forerunner to “The Sopranos” (though David Chase, creator of that HBO series, never actually saw it).\n\nMr. Cannell shrugged off such puzzlement, saying he didn’t know why his work ranged so widely. “But I do know it’s easier to think of me simply as the guy who wrote ‘The A-Team,’ ” Mr. Cannel told the Associated Press in 1993. “So they do.”\n\n“I’m generally a very happy guy, because I’m doing what I want,” Mr. Cannell said in the Success interview. “I’m willing to tell you that there are people who are much better than I am in writing. I don’t have to be the fastest gun in the West.”\n\nSOURCE\n\n****************************************************************\n\nARTHUR PENN, DIRECTOR OF ‘BONNIE AND CLYDE’\n\nMore Photos »\n\nBy DAVE KEHR\n\nPublished: September 29, 2010\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~"
