        "text": "SANTA MONICA, Calif. — Yes, Gloria Stuart has slowed down and uses a cane these days — she is 100 after all — but\n\nthe legendary actress is still stunningly beautiful, witty and impishly\n\ncharming.\n\nDuring a recent visit to her Santa Monica\n\nhome, her grandson Benjamin offers a guest a glass of orange juice and\n\nStuart a glass of water. Stuart declines; she wants a glass of white\n\nwine.\n\n“Would you like some wine instead?” she asks her visitor.\n\nNo, thanks. I don’t drink wine.\n\n“You don’t drink?” she says, smiling. “I do.\n\nOn Thursday evening she will be honored with an\n\n“Academy Centennial Celebration With Gloria Stuart” at the Samuel\n\nGoldwyn Theater in Beverly Hills.\n\nEvery year, the Academy of Arts and Sciences presents centennial\n\ntributes to actors, directors, composers and other noted individuals\n\nfrom the world of cinema. The evenings usually are comprised of clips,\n\nscreenings and reminisces from family, co-workers and friends because\n\nthe subject being feted has long since died.\n\nStuart, who turned 100 on July 4, is delighted to be around for her own tribute.\n\n“Isn’t it wonderful,” Stuart says, her blue eyes sparkling. “I have waited a long time.”\n\nAcademy programmer Ellen Harrington notes that Stuart is the only living Screen Actors Guild board member\n\nof the 1930s. But that’s just the tip of the iceberg for the “Titanic”\n\ncostar.\n\n“It’s rare to see somebody who has had the whole\n\nexperience of being discovered, getting the studio contract and working\n\nin the studio system and making so many films in the 1930s and ’40s,”\n\nHarrington says. “Then she goes on and becomes a very accomplished book\n\nartist and printer and then comes back and gets an Oscar nomination at\n\n87 for ‘Titanic.'”\n\nStuart is excited by the academy event, which will\n\ninclude film clips from several of her films including, 1932’s “The Old\n\nDark House,” which she made for James Whale, 1936’s “The Prisoner of Shark Island” for director John Ford, 1938’s “Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm,” which starred Shirley Temple, 1982’s “My Favorite Year,” in which she dances with Peter O’Toole and of course, “Titanic,” in which she played Old Rose, the 85-year-old survivor of the 1912 ocean liner disaster.\n\nBesides chatting onstage with her friend, film\n\nhistorian and critic Leonard Maltin, the celebration will feature\n\nseveral of her paintings on view in the theater’s lobby as well as the\n\nsecond floor and her artist’s books she has written, printed and\n\npressed and bound. Several of her limited edition artist’s books are in\n\nthe Metropolitan Museum, the Library of Congress, the Getty and the\n\nHuntington.\n\nA few days after her birthday celebration on July 4 at the ACE Gallery in Beverly Hills, thrown by “Titanic” director James Cameron and his wife Suzy Amis (she played Rose’s granddaughter in the film), Stuart is holding court in the dining area of her home.\n\nGrandson Benjamin and great-grand daughter Deborah\n\nare bringing in gifts from the event, as well as her artwork that was\n\non display at ACE for her birthday. Deborah, a senior at Brandeis,\n\nsits in during the interview not only to listen to her stories but to\n\nmake herself available to “Great Gloria,” as Deborah calls her, if she\n\nneeds help remembering.\n\nBorn in Santa Monica, Stuart attended UC Berkeley, where she began acting on stage. She was discovered by Universal at the Pasadena Playhouse.\n\nAfter making her film debut 1932’s “Street of Women,” Stuart appeared\n\nin such films as Whale’s “Old Dark House” and 1933’s “The Invisible\n\nMan,” 1933’s “Roman Scandals” with Eddie Cantor, “Golddiggers of 1935,” opposite Dick Powell and even 1939’s “The Three Musketeers,” with the comedy team of the Ritz Brothers.\n\nMarried to second husband Arthur Sheekman, who wrote\n\nfor the Marx Brothers, in 1934, she began a second career in the fine\n\narts in the 1940s. She slowly started working again in small parts in\n\nthe 1970s. With “Titanic,” she became the oldest person nominated for\n\nan acting Oscar.\n\nGrowing up, she says, “I wanted acting the most. I\n\nwas not thinking of being an artist; only an actress and the best\n\nactress in the world. Everything I did contributed to it — the\n\nexercise, the dieting, the reading, the practicing.”\n\nStuart says she thanks Cameron every night for giving her the role in “Titanic.”\n\n“It was a ball,” she says of making the film. “The people, including Mr. Cameron, were extremely bright and extremely finished.”\n\nStuart has written a number of books, including her latest about famed scientist J. Robert Oppenheimer, whom she dated when she was young student at Berkeley in the late 1920s.\n\n“I wanted to be a Communist,” Stuart says. “Berkeley was considered a little off the mainstream. I knew all the pinkos in Berkeley. Oppenheimer could not get a job at a lot of universities, but Berkeley\n\nhired him. He was given a big party by his fraternity brother. There\n\nwere 100 people at the party. I was introduced to him. I came home from\n\nclass one afternoon and my roommate said, ‘Gloria, Oppenheimer called\n\nand he wants to take you to the opera in San Francisco on Sunday.’ I had been very lively, showing off at the party.”\n\nIt seems, though, Stuart didn’t know a lot about opera.\n\n“At the end of the opera, he leaned over and said,\n\n‘Did you enjoy it?’ I said, ‘Oh yes, it’s wonderful when you hear the\n\nthree B’s at all one time.’ He said, ‘The three B’s?’ I said, ‘Yes,\n\nBach, Beethoven and Brahms.’ He said, ‘Tell me, Stuart. Is there a music course at Berkeley during the summer?’ I said, ‘I think so.’ He said, ‘Take it.'”\n\n———\n\n(c) 2010, Los Angeles Times.\n\nVisit the Los Angeles Times on the Internet at http://www.latimes.com/\n\nDistributed by McClatchy-Tribune Information Services."
