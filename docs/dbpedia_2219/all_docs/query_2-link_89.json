        "text": "Nokia Corporation (Template:Pron-en) (Template:OMX, Template:Nyse, Template:FWB) is a Finnish multinational communications corporation that is headquartered in Keilaniemi, Espoo, a city neighbouring Finland's capital Helsinki.[1] Nokia is engaged in the manufacturing of mobile devices and in converging Internet and communications industries, with over 123,000 employees in 120 countries, sales in more than 150 countries and global annual revenue of EUR 41 billion and operating profit of €1.2 billion as of 2009.[2] It is the world's largest manufacturer of mobile telephones: its global device market share was about 39% in Q4 2009, up from 37% in Q4 2008 and 38% in Q3 2009, and its converged device market share was about 40% in Q4, up from 35% in Q3 2009.[2] Nokia produces mobile devices for every major market segment and protocol, including GSM, CDMA, and W-CDMA (UMTS). Nokia offers Internet services such as applications, games, music, maps, media and messaging through its Ovi platform. Nokia's subsidiary Nokia Siemens Networks produces telecommunications network equipment, solutions and services.[3] Nokia is also engaged in providing free digital map information and navigation services through its wholly-owned subsidiary Navteq.[4] 3 April 2003\n\nNokia has sites for research and development, manufacture and sales in many countries throughout the world. As of December 2009, Nokia had R&D presence in 16 countries and employed 37,020 people in research and development, representing approximately 30% of the group's total workforce.[2] The Nokia Research Center, founded in 1986, is Nokia's industrial research unit consisting of about 500 researchers, engineers and scientists.[5][6] It has sites in seven countries: Finland, China, India, Kenya, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the United States.[7] Besides its research centers, in 2001 Nokia founded (and owns) INdT – Nokia Institute of Technology, a R&D institute located in Brazil.[8] Nokia operates a total of 15 manufacturing facilities[9] located at Espoo, Oulu and Salo, Finland; Manaus, Brazil; Beijing, Dongguan and Suzhou, China; Farnborough, England; Komárom, Hungary; Chennai, India; Reynosa, Mexico; Jucu, Romania and Masan, South Korea.[10][11] Nokia's Design Department remains in Salo, Finland.\n\nNokia is a public limited liability company listed on the Helsinki, Frankfurt, and New York stock exchanges.[9] Nokia plays a very large role in the economy of Finland; it is by far the largest Finnish company, accounting for about a third of the market capitalization of the Helsinki Stock Exchange (OMX Helsinki) as of 2007, a unique situation for an industrialized country.[12] It is an important employer in Finland and several small companies have grown into large ones as its partners and subcontractors.[13] Nokia increased Finland's GDP by more than 1.5% in 1999 alone. In 2004 Nokia's share of the Finnish GDP was 3.5% and accounted for almost a quarter of Finland's exports in 2003.[14]\n\nIn recent years, Finns have consistently ranked Nokia as one of the best Finnish brands. In 2008, it was the 27th most respected brand among Finns, down from sixth place in 2007.[15] The Nokia brand, valued at $34.9 billion, is listed as the fifth most valuable global brand in the Interbrand/BusinessWeek Best Global Brands list of 2009 (first non-US company).[16][17] It is the number one brand in Asia (as of 2007)[18] and Europe (as of 2009),[19] the 42nd most admirable company worldwide in Fortune's World's Most Admired Companies list of 2009 (third in Network Communications, seventh non-US company),[20] and the world's 85th largest company as measured by revenue in Fortune Global 500 list of 2009, up from 88th the previous year.[21] As of 2009, AMR Research ranks Nokia's global supply chain number six in the world.[22]\n\nHistory[]\n\nTemplate:Double image\n\nPre-telecommunications era[]\n\nThe predecessors of the modern Nokia were the Nokia Company (Nokia Aktiebolag), Finnish Rubber Works Ltd (Suomen Gummitehdas Oy) and Finnish Cable Works Ltd (Suomen Kaapelitehdas Oy).[24]\n\nNokia's history starts in 1865 when mining engineer Fredrik Idestam established a groundwood pulp mill on the banks of the Tammerkoski rapids in the town of Tampere, in southwestern Finland, and started manufacturing paper.[25] In 1868, Idestam built a second mill near the town of Nokia, fifteen kilometres (nine miles) west of Tampere by the Nokianvirta river, which had better resources for hydropower production.[26] In 1871, Idestam, with the help of his close friend statesman Leo Mechelin, renamed and transformed his firm into a share company, thereby founding the Nokia Company, the name it is still known by today.[26]\n\nThe name of the town, Nokia, originated from the river which flowed through the town. The river itself, Nokianvirta, was named after the archaic Finnish word originally meaning a small, dark-furred animal that lived on the banks of the Nokianvirta river. In modern Finnish, noki means soot and nokia is its inflected plural, although this form of the word is rarely if ever used. The old word, nois (pl. nokia) or nokinäätä (\"soot marten\"), meant sable.[27] After sable was hunted to extinction in Finland, the word was applied to any dark-furred animal of the genus Martes, such as the pine marten, which are found in the area to this day.[28]\n\nToward the end of the 19th century, Mechelin's wishes to expand into the electricity business were at first thwarted by Idestam's opposition. However, Idestam's retirement from the management of the company in 1896 allowed Mechelin to become the company's chairman (from 1898 until 1914) and sell most shareholders on his plans, thus realising his vision.[26] In 1902, Nokia added electricity generation to its business activities.[25]\n\nIndustrial conglomerate[]\n\nIn 1898, Eduard Polón founded Finnish Rubber Works, manufacturer of galoshes and other rubber products, which later became Nokia's rubber business.[24] At the beginning of the 20th century, Finnish Rubber Works established its factories near the town of Nokia and began using Nokia as its product brand. In 1912, Arvid Wickström founded Finnish Cable Works, producer of telephone, telegraph and electrical cables and the foundation of Nokia's cable and electronics businesses.[24] At the end of the 1910s, shortly after World War I, the Nokia Company was nearing bankruptcy.[30] To ensure the continuation of electricity supply from Nokia's generators, Finnish Rubber Works acquired the business of the insolvent company.[30] In 1922, Finnish Rubber Works acquired Finnish Cable Works.[31] In 1937, Verner Weckman, a sport wrestler and Finland's first Olympic Gold medalist, became President of Finnish Cable Works, after 16 years as its Technical Director.[32] After World War II, Finnish Cable Works supplied cables to the Soviet Union as part of Finland's war reparations. This gave the company a good foothold for later trade.[32]\n\nThe three companies, which had been jointly owned since 1922, were merged to form a new industrial conglomerate, Nokia Corporation in 1967 and paved the way for Nokia's future as a global corporation.[33] The new company was involved in many industries, producing at one time or another paper products, car and bicycle tires, footwear (including Wellington boots), communications cables, televisions and other consumer electronics, personal computers, electricity generation machinery, robotics, capacitors, military communications and equipment (such as the SANLA M/90 device and the M61 gas mask for the Finnish Army), plastics, aluminium and chemicals.[23] Each business unit had its own director who reported to the first Nokia Corporation President, Björn Westerlund. As the president of the Finnish Cable Works, he had been responsible for setting up the company’s first electronics department in 1960, sowing the seeds of Nokia’s future in telecommunications.[34]\n\nEventually, the company decided to leave consumer electronics behind in the 1990s and focused solely on the fastest growing segments in telecommunications.[35] Nokian Tyres, manufacturer of tyres split from Nokia Corporation to form its own company in 1988[36] and two years later Nokian Footwear, manufacturer of rubber boots, was founded. During the rest of the 1990s, Nokia divested itself of all of its non-telecommunications businesses.[35]\n\nTelecommunications era[]\n\nThe seeds of the current incarnation of Nokia were planted with the founding of the electronics section of the cable division in 1960 and the production of its first electronic device in 1962: a pulse analyzer designed for use in nuclear power plants.[34] In the 1967 fusion, that section was separated into its own division, and began manufacturing telecommunications equipment.\n\nNetworking equipment[]\n\nIn the 1970s, Nokia became more involved in the telecommunications industry by developing the Nokia DX 200, a digital switch for telephone exchanges. In 1982, a DX 200 switch became the world's first microprocessor controlled telephone exchange and the first fully digital exchange to be taken into service in Europe. The DX 200 became the workhorse of the network equipment division. Its modular and flexible architecture enabled it to be developed into various switching products.[37] In 1984, development of a version of the exchange for the Nordic Mobile Telephony network was started.[38]\n\nFor a while in the 1970s, Nokia's network equipment production was separated into Telefenno, a company jointly owned by the parent corporation and by a company owned by the Finnish state. In 1987, the state sold its shares to Nokia and in 1992 the name was changed to Nokia Telecommunications.\n\nIn the 1970s and 1980s, Nokia developed the Sanomalaitejärjestelmä (\"Message device system\"), a digital, portable and encrypted text-based communications device for the Finnish Defence Forces.[39] The current main unit used by the Defence Forces is the Sanomalaite M/90 (SANLA M/90).[40]\n\nFirst mobile phones[]\n\nThe technologies that preceded modern cellular mobile telephony systems were the various \"0G\" pre-cellular mobile radio telephony standards. Nokia had been producing commercial and some military mobile radio communications technology since the 1960s, although this part of the company was sold some time before the later company rationalisation. Since 1964, Nokia had developed VHF radio simultaneously with Salora Oy. In 1966, Nokia and Salora started developing the ARP standard (which stands for Autoradiopuhelin, or car radio phone in English), a car-based mobile radio telephony system and the first commercially operated public mobile phone network in Finland. It went online in 1971 and offered 100% coverage in 1978.[43]\n\nIn 1979, the merger of Nokia and Salora resulted in the establishment of Mobira Oy. Mobira began developing mobile phones for the NMT (Nordic Mobile Telephony) network standard, the first-generation, first fully-automatic cellular phone system that went online in 1981.[44] In 1982, Mobira introduced its first car phone, the Mobira Senator for NMT-450 networks.[44]\n\nNokia bought Salora Oy in 1984 and now owning 100% of the company, changed the company's telecommunications branch name to Nokia-Mobira Oy. The Mobira Talkman, launched in 1984, was one of the world's first transportable phones. In 1987, Nokia introduced one of the world's first handheld phones, the Mobira Cityman 900 for NMT-900 networks (which, compared to NMT-450, offered a better signal, yet a shorter roam). While the Mobira Senator of 1982 had weighed Template:Convert and the Talkman just under Template:Convert, the Mobira Cityman weighed only Template:Convert with the battery and had a price tag of 24,000 Finnish marks (approximately €4,560).[42] Despite the high price, the first phones were almost snatched from the sales assistants’ hands. Initially, the mobile phone was a \"yuppie\" product and a status symbol.[23]\n\nNokia's mobile phones got a big publicity boost in 1987, when Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev was pictured using a Mobira Cityman to make a call from Helsinki to his communications minister in Moscow. This led to the phone's nickname of the \"Gorba\".[42]\n\nIn 1988, Jorma Nieminen, resigning from the post of CEO of the mobile phone unit, along with two other employees from the unit, started a notable mobile phone company of their own, Benefon Oy (since renamed to GeoSentric).[45] One year later, Nokia-Mobira Oy became Nokia Mobile Phones.\n\nInvolvement in GSM[]\n\nNokia was one of the key developers of GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications),[46] the second-generation mobile technology which could carry data as well as voice traffic. NMT (Nordic Mobile Telephony), the world's first mobile telephony standard that enabled international roaming, provided valuable experience for Nokia for its close participation in developing GSM, which was adopted in 1987 as the new European standard for digital mobile technology.[47][48]\n\nNokia delivered its first GSM network to the Finnish operator Radiolinja in 1989.[49] The world's first commercial GSM call was made on 1 July 1991 in Helsinki, Finland over a Nokia-supplied network, by then Prime Minister of Finland Harri Holkeri, using a prototype Nokia GSM phone.[49] In 1992, the first GSM phone, the Nokia 1011, was launched.[49][50] The model number refers to its launch date, 10 November.[50] The Nokia 1011 did not yet employ Nokia's characteristic ringtone, the Nokia tune. It was introduced as a ringtone in 1994 with the Nokia 2100 series.[51]\n\nGSM's high-quality voice calls, easy international roaming and support for new services like text messaging (SMS) laid the foundations for a worldwide boom in mobile phone use.[49] GSM came to dominate the world of mobile telephony in the 1990s, in mid-2008 accounting for about three billion mobile telephone subscribers in the world, with more than 700 mobile operators across 218 countries and territories. New connections are added at the rate of 15 per second, or 1.3 million per day.[52]\n\nPersonal computers and IT equipment[]\n\nTemplate:See also\n\nIn the 1980s, Nokia's computer division Nokia Data produced a series of personal computers called MikroMikko.[53] MikroMikko was Nokia Data's attempt to enter the business computer market. The first model in the line, MikroMikko 1, was released on September 29, 1981,[54] around the same time as the first IBM PC. However, the personal computer division was sold to the British ICL (International Computers Limited) in 1991, which later became part of Fujitsu.[55] MikroMikko remained a trademark of ICL and later Fujitsu. Internationally the MikroMikko line was marketed by Fujitsu as the ErgoPro.\n\nFujitsu later transferred its personal computer operations to Fujitsu Siemens Computers, which shut down its only factory in Espoo, Finland (in the Kilo district, where computers had been produced since the 1960s) at the end of March 2000,[56][57] thus ending large-scale PC manufacturing in the country. Nokia was also known for producing very high quality CRT and early TFT LCD displays for PC and larger systems application. The Nokia Display Products' branded business was sold to ViewSonic in 2000.[58] In addition to personal computers and displays, Nokia used to manufacture DSL modems and digital set-top boxes.\n\nNokia re-entered the PC market in August 2009 with the introduction of the Nokia Booklet 3G mini laptop.[59]\n\nChallenges of growth[]\n\nIn the 1980s, during the era of its CEO Kari Kairamo, Nokia expanded into new fields, mostly by acquisitions. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, the corporation ran into serious financial problems, a major reason being its heavy losses by the television manufacturing division and businesses that were just too diverse.[60] These problems, and a suspected total burnout, probably contributed to Kairamo taking his own life in 1988. After Kairamo's death, Simo Vuorilehto became Nokia's Chairman and CEO. In 1990–1993, Finland underwent severe economic depression,[61] which also struck Nokia. Under Vuorilehto's management, Nokia was severely overhauled. The company responded by streamlining its telecommunications divisions, and by divesting itself of the television and PC divisions.[62]\n\nProbably the most important strategic change in Nokia's history was made in 1992, however, when the new CEO Jorma Ollila made a crucial strategic decision to concentrate solely on telecommunications.[35] Thus, during the rest of the 1990s, the rubber, cable and consumer electronics divisions were gradually sold as Nokia continued to divest itself of all of its non-telecommunications businesses.[35]\n\nAs late as 1991, more than a quarter of Nokia's turnover still came from sales in Finland. However, after the strategic change of 1992, Nokia saw a huge increase in sales to North America, South America and Asia.[63] The exploding worldwide popularity of mobile telephones, beyond even Nokia's most optimistic predictions, caused a logistics crisis in the mid-1990s.[64] This prompted Nokia to overhaul its entire logistics operation.[65] By 1998, Nokia’s focus on telecommunications and its early investment in GSM technologies had made the company the world's largest mobile phone manufacturer.[63] Between 1996 and 2001, Nokia’s turnover increased almost fivefold from 6.5 billion euros to 31 billion euros.[63] Logistics continues to be one of Nokia's major advantages over its rivals, along with greater economies of scale.[66][67]\n\nRecent history[]\n\nTemplate:Article issues\n\nMilestones and releases[]\n\nNokia opened its Komárom, Hungary mobile phone factory on May 5, 2000.[68]\n\nIn March 2007, Nokia signed a memorandum with Cluj County Council, Romania to open a new plant near the city in Jucu commune.[11][69][70] Moving the production from the Bochum, Germany factory to a low wage country created an uproar in Germany.[71][72]\n\nIn May 2007, Nokia announced that its Nokia 1100 handset, launched in 2003,[41] with over 200 million units shipped, was the best-selling mobile phone of all time and the world's top-selling consumer electronics product.[73]\n\nIn November 2007, Nokia announced and released the Nokia N82, its first (and currently, only) Nseries phone with Xenon flash.\n\nAt the Nokia World conference in December 2007, Nokia announced their \"Comes With Music\" program: Nokia device buyers are to receive a year of complimentary access to music downloads.[74] The service became commercially available in the second half of 2008.\n\nIn April 2008, Nokia began finding new ways to connect people, asking the \"audience\" to use their creativity and their mobile devices to become Nokia’s production company – to take part in filming, acting, editing and producing a collaborative film. Nokia Productions was the first ever mobile filmmaking project directed by Spike Lee. This was a collaborative experience that existed across borders and perspectives, working off a common script. The film premiered in October 2008.[75]\n\nIn 2008, Nokia released the Nokia E71 which was marketed to directly compete with the other BlackBerry devices offering a full keyboard and cheaper prices.\n\nNokia announced in August 2009 that they will be selling a high-end Windows-based mini laptop called the Nokia Booklet 3G.[59]\n\nOn 2 September 2009, Nokia launched two new music and social networking phones, the Nokia X6 and Nokia X3.[76] The Nokia X6 features 32GB of on-board memory with a 3.2\" finger touch interface and comes with a music playback time of 35 hours. The Nokia X3 is a first series 40 Ovi Store-enabled device. The X3 is a music device that comes with stereo speakers, built-in FM radio, and a 3.2 megapixel camera.\n\nOn 10 September 2009, Nokia unveiled a new handset, Nokia 7705 Twist, a phone with a sports square shape that swivels open to reveal a full QWERTY keypad.[77] The new mobile, which will be available exclusively through Verizon Wireless, features a 3 megapixel camera, web browsing, voice commands and weighs around 3.44 ounces.\n\nReorganisations[]\n\nIn April 2003, the troubles of the networks equipment division caused the corporation to resort to similar streamlining practices on that side, including layoffs and organizational restructuring.[78] This diminished Nokia's public image in Finland,[79][80] and produced a number of court cases and an episode of a documentary television show critical of Nokia.[81]\n\nOn February 2006, Nokia and Sanyo announced a memorandum of understanding to create a joint venture addressing the CDMA handset business. But in June, they announced ending negotiations without agreement. Nokia also stated its decision to pull out of CDMA research and development, to continue CDMA business in selected markets.[82][83][84]\n\nIn June 2006, Jorma Ollila left his position as CEO to become the chairman of Royal Dutch Shell[85] and to give way for Olli-Pekka Kallasvuo.[86][87]\n\nIn May 2008, Nokia announced on their annual stockholder meeting that they want to shift to the Internet business as a whole. Nokia no longer wants to be seen as the telephone company. Google, Apple and Microsoft are not seen as natural competition for their new image but they are considered as major important players to deal with.[88]\n\nIn November 2008, Nokia announced it was ceasing mobile phone distribution in Japan.[89] Following early December, distribution of Nokia E71 is cancelled, both from NTT docomo and SoftBank Mobile. Nokia Japan retains global research & development programs, sourcing business, and an MVNO venture of Vertu luxury phones, using docomo's telecommunications network.\n\nAcquisitions[]\n\nTemplate:Mainlist\n\nOn 22 September 2003, Nokia acquired Sega.com, a branch of Sega which became the major basis to develop the Nokia N-Gage device.[90]\n\nOn 16 November 2005, Nokia and Intellisync Corporation, a provider of data and PIM synchronisation software, signed a definitive agreement for Nokia to acquire Intellisync.[91] Nokia completed the acquisition on 10 February 2006.[92]\n\nOn 19 June 2006, Nokia and Siemens AG announced the companies would merge their mobile and fixed-line phone network equipment businesses to create one of the world's largest network firms, Nokia Siemens Networks.[93] Each company has a 50% stake in the infrastructure company, and it is headquartered in Espoo, Finland. The companies predicted annual sales of €16 bn and cost savings of €1.5 bn a year by 2010. About 20,000 Nokia employees were transferred to this new company.\n\nOn 8 August 2006, Nokia and Loudeye Corp. announced that they had signed an agreement for Nokia to acquire online music distributor Loudeye Corporation for approximately US $60 million.[94] The company has been developing this into an online music service in the hope of using it to generate handset sales. The service, launched on 29 August 2007, is aimed to rival iTunes. Nokia completed the acquisition on 16 October 2006.[95]\n\nIn July 2007, Nokia acquired all assets of Twango, the comprehensive media sharing solution for organizing and sharing photos, videos and other personal media.[96][97]\n\nIn September 2007, Nokia announced its intention to acquire Enpocket, a supplier of mobile advertising technology and services.[98]\n\nIn October 2007, pending shareholder and regulatory approval, Nokia bought Navteq, a U.S.-based supplier of digital mapping data, for a price of $8.1 billion.[4][99] Nokia finalized the acquisition on 10 July 2008.[100]\n\nIn September, 2008, Nokia acquired OZ Communications, a privately held company with approximately 220 employees headquartered in Montreal, Canada.[101]\n\nOn 24 July 2009, Nokia announced that it will acquire certain assets of cellity, a privately owned mobile software company which employs 14 people in Hamburg, Germany.[102] The acquisition of cellity was completed on 5 August 2009.[103]\n\nOn 11 September 2009, Nokia announced the acquisition of \"certain assets of Plum Ventures, Inc, a privately held company which employed approximately 10 people with main offices in Boston, Massachusetts. Plum will complement Nokia’s Social Location services\".[104]\n\nCorporate affairs[]\n\nCorporate structure[]\n\nDivisions[]\n\nSince 1 October 2009, Nokia comprises three business groups: Devices, Services, Solutions and Markets.[105] The four units receive operational support from the Corporate Development Office, led by Mary T. McDowell, which is also responsible for exploring corporate strategic and future growth opportunities.[105]\n\nOn 1 April 2007, Nokia’s Networks business group was combined with Siemens’ carrier-related operations for fixed and mobile networks to form Nokia Siemens Networks, jointly owned by Nokia and Siemens and consolidated by Nokia.[106]\n\nDevices[]\n\nThe Devices division is responsible for developing and managing Nokia's mobile device portfolio, including the sourcing of components, headed by Kai Öistämö.[105] The division consists of the previous mainline Mobile Phones division with the separate subdivisions Multimedia (Nseries devices) and Enterprise Solutions (Eseries devices) as well as formerly centralized core devices R&D – called Technology Platforms.\n\nThis division provides the general public with mobile voice and data products across a wide range of mobile devices, including high-volume, consumer oriented mobile phones and devices, and more expensive multimedia and enterprise-class devices. The devices are based on GSM/EDGE, 3G/W-CDMA and CDMA cellular technologies. Nokia's Nseries Multimedia Computers extensively uses Symbian OS.\n\nIn the first quarter of 2006 Nokia sold over 15 million MP3 capable mobile phones, which means that Nokia is not only the world's leading supplier of mobile phones and digital cameras (as most of Nokia's mobile telephones feature digital cameras, it is also believed that Nokia has recently overtaken Kodak in camera production making it the largest in the world), Nokia is now also the leading supplier of digital audio players (MP3 players), outpacing sales of devices such as the iPod from Apple. At the end of the year 2007, Nokia managed to sell almost 440 million mobile phones which accounted for 40% of all global mobile phones sales.[107]\n\nServices[]\n\nThe Services division operates in five areas of consumer Internet services: music, maps, media, messaging and games.[105] The division consists of the previous enterprise and consumer driver services businesses previously hosted in Multimedia and Enterprise Solutions divisions, as well as a number of new acquisitions (Loudeye, Gate5, Enpocket, Intellisync, Avvenu and OZ Communications), headed by Niklas Savander.\n\nThe group works with companies outside the telecommunications industry to make advances in the technology and bring new applications and possibilities in areas such as online services, optics, music synchronization and streaming media.\n\nSolutions[]\n\nSolutions is responsible for Nokia's offering of solutions, where the mobile device, personalized services and content are integrated into a package for the consumer. The unit is led by Alberto Torres.\n\nMarkets[]\n\nThe Markets division, the successor organization to Nokia's Customer and Market Operations division, is responsible for the management of the supply chains, sales channels, brand and marketing functions of the company, headed by Anssi Vanjoki.[105]\n\nSubsidiaries[]\n\nNokia has several subsidiaries, of which the two most significant as of 2009 are Nokia Siemens Networks and Navteq.[105] Other notable subsidiaries include, but are not limited to Vertu, a British-based manufacturer and retailer of luxury mobile phones; Qt Software, a Norwegian-based software company, and OZ Communications, a consumer e-mail and instant messaging provider.\n\nUntil 2008 Nokia was the major shareholder in Symbian Limited, a software development and licensing company that produced Symbian OS, a smartphone operating system used by Nokia and other manufacturers. In 2008 Nokia acquired Symbian Ltd and, along with a number of other companies, created the Symbian Foundation to distribute the Symbian platform royalty free and as open source.\n\nNokia Siemens Networks[]\n\nMain article: Nokia Siemens Networks\n\nNokia Siemens Networks (previously Nokia Networks) provides wireless and wired network infrastructure, communications and networks service platforms, as well as professional services to operators and service providers.[105] Nokia Siemens Networks focuses in GSM, EDGE, 3G/W-CDMA and WiMAX radio access networks; core networks with increasing IP and multiaccess capabilities; and services.\n\nOn 19 June 2006 Nokia and Siemens AG announced the companies are to merge their mobile and fixed-line phone network equipment businesses to create one of the world's largest network firms, called Nokia Siemens Networks.[93] The Nokia Siemens Networks brand identity was subsequently launched at the 3GSM World Congress in Barcelona in February 2007.[108][109]\n\nAs of March 2009, Nokia Siemens Networks serves more than 600 operator customers in more than 150 countries, with over 1.5 billion people connected through its networks.[110]\n\nNavteq[]\n\nMain article: Navteq\n\nNavteq is a Chicago, Illinois-based provider of digital map data for automotive navigation systems, mobile navigation devices, Internet-based mapping applications, and government and business solutions.[105] Navteq was acquired by Nokia on 1 October 2007.[4] Navteq’s map data is part of the Nokia Maps online service where users can download maps, use voice-guided navigation and other context-aware web services.[105] Nokia Maps is part of the Ovi brand of Nokia's Internet based online services.\n\nCorporate governance[]\n\nThe control and management of Nokia is divided among the shareholders at a general meeting and the Group Executive Board (left),[111] under the direction of the Board of Directors (right).[112] The Chairman and the rest of the Group Executive Board members are appointed by the Board of Directors. Only the Chairman of the Group Executive Board can belong to both, the Board of Directors and the Group Executive Board. The Board of Directors' committees consist of the Audit Committee,[113] the Personnel Committee[114] and the Corporate Governance and Nomination Committee.[115][116]\n\nThe operations of the company are managed within the framework set by the Finnish Companies Act,[117] Nokia's Articles of Association[118] and Corporate Governance Guidelines,[119] and related Board of Directors adopted charters.\n\nTemplate:Clear\n\nFormer corporate officers[]\n\nChief Executive Officers Chairmen of the Board of Directors [120] Björn Westerlund 1967–1977 Template:Pad Lauri J.

All documentation is written in English, and is used in official intra-company spoken communication and e-mail.\n\nUntil May 2007, the Nokia Values were Customer Satisfaction, Respect, Achievement, and Renewal. In May 2007, Nokia redefined its values after initiating a series of discussions worldwide as to what the new values of the company should be. Based on the employee suggestions, the new values were defined as: Engaging You, Achieving Together, Passion for Innovation and Very Human.[121]\n\nOnline services[]\n\n.mobi and the Mobile Web[]\n\nNokia was the first proponent of a Top Level Domain (TLD) specifically for the Mobile Web and, as a result, was instrumental in the launch of the .mobi domain name extension in September 2006 as an official backer.[122][123] Since then, Nokia has launched the largest mobile portal, Nokia.mobi, which receives over 100 million visits a month.[124] It followed that with the launch of a mobile Ad Service to cater to the growing demand for mobile advertisement.[125]\n\nOvi[]\n\nMain article: Ovi (Nokia)\n\nOvi, announced on 29 August 2007, is the name for Nokia's \"umbrella concept\" Internet services.[126] Centered on Ovi.com, it is marketed as a \"personal dashboard\" where users can share photos with friends, download music, maps and games directly to their phones and access third-party services like Yahoo's Flickr photo site. It has some significance in that Nokia is moving deeper into the world of Internet services, where head-on competition with Microsoft, Google and Apple is inevitable.[127]\n\nThe services offered through Ovi include the Ovi Store (Nokia's application store), the Nokia Music Store, Nokia Maps, Ovi Mail, the N-Gage mobile gaming platform available for several S60 smartphones, Ovi Share, Ovi Files, and Contacts and Calendar.[128] The Ovi Store, the Ovi application store was launched in May 2009.[129] Prior to opening the Ovi Store, Nokia integrated its software Download! store, the stripped-down MOSH repository and the widget service WidSets into it.[130]\n\nMy Nokia[]\n\nNokia offers a free personalised service to its subscribers called My Nokia (located at my.nokia.com).[131] Registered My Nokia users can avail free services as follows:\n\nTips & tricks alerts through web, e-mail and also mobile text message.\n\nMy Nokia Backup: A free online backup service for mobile contacts, calendar logs and also various other files. This service needs GPRS connection.\n\nNumerous ringtones, wallpapers, screensavers, games and other things can be downloaded free of cost.\n\nComes With Music[]\n\nOn 4 December 2007, Nokia unveiled their plans for the \"Nokia Comes With Music\" initiative, a programme that would partner with Universal Music Group International, Sony BMG, Warner Music Group, and EMI as well as hundreds of Independent labels and music aggregators to bundle 12, 18, or 24 months worth of unlimited free music downloads with the purchase of a Nokia Comes With Music edition phone. Following the termination of the year of free downloads, tracks can be kept without having to renew the subscription. Downloads are both PC and mobile-based.[74]\n\nNokia Messaging[]\n\nOn August 13, 2008, Nokia launched a beta release of \"Nokia Email service\", a new push e-mail service, since graduated as part of Nokia Messaging.[132]\n\nNokia Messaging operates as a centralised, hosted service that acts as a proxy between the Nokia Messaging client and the user's e-mail server. It does not allow for a direct connection between the phone and the e-mail server, and is therefore required to send e-mail credentials to Nokia's servers.[133] IMAP is used as the protocol to transfer emails between the client and the server.\n\nControversy[]\n\nNSN's provision of intercept capability to Iran[]\n\nIn 2008, Nokia Siemens Networks, a joint venture between Nokia and Siemens AG, reportedly provided Iran's monopoly telecom company with technology that allowed it to intercept the Internet communications of its citizens to an unprecedented degree.[134] The technology reportedly allowed it to use deep packet inspection to read and even change the content of everything from \"e-mails and Internet phone calls to images and messages on social-networking sites such as Facebook and Twitter\". The technology \"enables authorities to not only block communication but to monitor it to gather information about individuals, as well as alter it for disinformation purposes,\" expert insiders told The Wall Street Journal. During the post-election protests in Iran in June 2009, Iran's Internet access was reported to have slowed to less than a tenth of its normal speeds, and experts suspected this was due to the use of the interception technology.[135]\n\nThe joint venture company, Nokia Siemens Networks, asserted in a press release that it provided Iran only with a 'lawful intercept capability' \"solely for monitoring of local voice calls\". \"Nokia Siemens Networks has not provided any deep packet inspection, web censorship or Internet filtering capability to Iran,\" it said.[136]\n\nIn July 2009, Nokia began to experience a boycott of their products and services in Iran. The boycott was led by consumers sympathetic to the post-election protest movement and targeted at those companies deemed to be collaborating with the Islamic regime. Demand for handsets fell and users began shunning SMS messaging.[137]\n\nLex Nokia[]\n\nIn 2009, Nokia heavily supported the passing of a law in Finland that allows companies to monitor their employees’ electronic communications in cases of suspected information leaking.[138] Contrary to rumors, Nokia denied that the company would have considered moving its head office out of Finland if laws on electronic surveillance were not changed.[139] The Finnish media dubbed the name Lex Nokia for this law, named after the Finnish copyright law (the so-called Lex Karpela) a few years back.\n\nNokia-Apple patent dispute[]\n\nOn October 2009, Nokia filed a lawsuit against Apple Inc. in the U.S. District Court of Delaware citing Apple infringed on 10 of its patents related to wireless communication including data transfer.[140] Apple was quick to respond with a countersuit filed in December 2009 accusing Nokia of 11 patent infringements. Apple’s General Counsel, Bruce Sewell went a step further by stating, \"Other companies must compete with us by inventing their own technologies, not just by stealing ours.\" This resulted in an ugly spat between the two telecom majors with Nokia filing another suit, this time with the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC), alleging Apple of infringing its patents in \"virtually all of its mobile phones, portable music players, and computers.\"[141] Nokia went on to ask the court to bar all U.S. imports of the Apple products including the iPhone, Mac and the iPod. Not one to be pushed behind, Apple countersued by filing a complaint with the ITC in January 2010, the details of which are yet to be confirmed.[140]\n\nEnvironmental record[]\n\nElectronic products such as cell phones impact the environment both during production and after their useful life when they are discarded and turned into electronic waste. According to environmental organization Greenpeace, Nokia has a good track record in limiting the amount of toxic chemicals in its products, supporting recycling, and reducing impact on climate change, compared to other market leaders in the electronics industry. In the 14th Greenpeace Guide to Greener Electronics, Nokia stays in first place with a total score of 7.3/10.[142][143]\n\nIn version 13 of the Guide, Nokia scored maximum points for its voluntary take-back program, which spans 84 countries with almost 5,000 collection points for end-of-life mobile phones.[144] It also scored top marks for the information it provides on what to do with discarded products.[145] However, the recycling rate of Nokia phones was only 3–5% in 2008, according to a global consumer survey released by Nokia.[146] The majority of old mobile phones are simply lying in drawers at home and very few old devices, about 4%, are being thrown into landfill and not recycled.[146]\n\nNokia scored very well on toxic chemical issues; it launched new models free of PVC at the end of 2005, first products without components containing BFRs from January 2007, and aims to have all new models free of all brominated and chlorinated compounds and antimony trioxide from the beginning of 2010.[147] Nokia scored maximum points for committing to reduce absolute [[Carbon dioxide|Template:Co2]] emissions by a minimum of 10% in 2009 and 18% in 2010 from a baseline year of 2006.[148] Top marks were given for product energy efficiency as all but one of its mobile phone chargers exceed the EPA’s Energy Star requirements by 30–90%.[149] Since 2001, Nokia has provided eco declarations of all its products.[150]\n\nNokia is currently actively researching the use of recycled plastics in their products, which are currently used only in packaging.[151] In an effort to further reduce their environmental impact in the future, Nokia released a new phone concept, Remade, in February 2008.[152] The phone has been constructed of solely recyclable materials.[152] The outer part of the phone is made from recycled materials such as aluminum cans, plastic bottles, and used car tires.[153] The screen is constructed of recycled glass, and the hinges have been created from rubber tires. The interior of the phone is entirely constructed with refurbished phone parts, and there is a feature that encourages energy saving habits by reducing the backlight to the ideal level, which then allows the battery to last longer without frequent charges.\n\nResearch cooperation with universities[]\n\nNokia is actively exploring and engaging in open innovation through selective research collaborations with major universities and institutions by sharing resources and leveraging ideas. Current collaborations include:[154]\n\nAalto University School of Science and Technology, Finland\n\nÉcole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne, Switzerland\n\nETH Zurich, Switzerland\n\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology, United States\n\nStanford University, United States\n\nTampere University of Technology, Finland\n\nTsinghua University, China\n\nUniversity of California, Berkeley, United States\n\nUniversity of Cambridge, United Kingdom\n\nUniversity of Southern California, United States\n\nSee also[]\n\nTemplate:Companies portal\n\nLists\n\nList of Nokia products\n\nList of acquisitions by Nokia\n\nGeneral\n\nSymbian – An open source operating system for mobile devices.\n\nGnokii − A suite of programs for communicating with mobile phones.\n\nMaemo − Software and development platform and an operating system.\n\nMeeGo − Merger of Maemo and Moblin projects\n\nNokia Beta Labs − Nokia beta applications.\n\nNokia Ovi Suite – Allows user to sync content with his Nokia device, send and receive text messages, take backup from device, transfer map files into device and update device software\n\nNokia PC Suite − A software package.\n\nNokia Software Updater − Mobile device firmware updater.\n\nForum Nokia − Developer community and support program.\n\nNokia head office − Nokia's headquarters.\n\nNokia, Finland − A Finnish town.\n\nNokian Tyres − A Finnish manufacturer of tires split from Nokia Corporation in 1988.\n\nNokian Footwear − A Finnish manufacturer of boots split from Nokia Corporation in 1990.\n\n[]\n\nOfficial Nokia portal (with complete list of regional websites)\n\nNokia Corporation Company Profile at Yahoo!\n\nNokia Siemens Networks\n\nOfficial Forum Nokia for developers\n\nOfficial Russian Forum Nokia\n\nNokia Interactive Advertising\n\n[1]\n\n[upcoming smartphone 1]"
