        "text": "The Omega-Infinity Limit of Single Spikes\n\nCERN Document Server\n\nAxenides, Minos; Linardopoulos, Georgios\n\nA new infinite-size limit of strings in RxS2 is presented. The limit is obtained from single spike strings by letting their angular velocity omega become infinite. We derive the energy-momenta relation of omega-infinity single spikes as their linear velocity v-->1 and their angular momentum J-->1. Generally, the v-->1, J-->1 limit of single spikes is singular and has to be excluded from the spectrum and be studied separately. We discover that the dispersion relation of omega-infinity single spikes contains logarithms in the limit J-->1. This result is somewhat surprising, since the logarithmic behavior in the string spectra is typically associated with their motion in non-compact spaces such as AdS. Omega-infinity single spikes seem to completely cover the surface of the 2-sphere they occupy, so that they may essentially be viewed as some sort of \"brany strings\". A proof of the sphere-filling property of omega-infinity single spikes is given in the appendix.\n\nLimited angle STIM and PIXE tomography of single cells\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nAndrea, T.; Rothermel, M.; Werner, R.; Butz, T.; Reinert, T.\n\n2010-01-01\n\nSTIM (scanning transmission ion microscopy) tomography has been shown to be a valuable method for the three-dimensional characterization of microsamples. It has, however, rarely been employed for the study of single cells, since a free-standing sample is needed for an ordinary tomography experiment. This requirement places high demands on sample preparation techniques. In this study cells fixated on a substrate rather than free-standing were used for tomography. Since the substrate prevented a full rotation of the sample an algorithm for limited-angle tomography was devised. STIM projections covering only a limited angular range of ca. 120 o were supplemented with simulated projections generated from a back and forth iteration between real space and Radon space. The energy loss caused by the substrate was subtracted from each projection. The cells were reconstructed using filtered backprojection. The surface of the cells as well as some interior structures could be reconstructed. Following the STIM projections a lesser number of PIXE (particle induced X-ray emission) projections were taken in order to obtain information about the elemental distribution of the sample. From the PIXE projections the three-dimensional phosphorus distribution within the cell was reconstructed using limited-angle tomography. Superimposition of the STIM and PIXE tomograms revealed the location of intracellular structures. Whereas STIM tomography is sensitive to density contrast, which are greatest at the surface, PIXE tomography is sensitive to changes in elemental concentration. Hence, the combination of the two methods can be very fruitful, while the limited angle approach can compensate some of the difficulties associated with tomography of single cells, namely preparation difficulties and excessive sample damage.\n\nPlastic limit loads for cylindrical shell intersections under combined loading\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nSkopinsky, V.N.; Berkov, N.A.; Vogov, R.A.\n\n2015-01-01\n\nIn this research, applied methods of nonlinear analysis and results of determining the plastic limit loads for shell intersection configurations under combined internal pressure, in-plane moment and out-plane moment loadings are presented. The numerical analysis of shell intersections is performed using the finite element method, geometrically nonlinear shell theory in quadratic approximation and plasticity theory. For determining the load parameter of proportional combined loading, the developed maximum criterion of rate of change of relative plastic work is employed. The graphical results for model of cylindrical shell intersection under different two-parameter combined loadings (as generalized plastic limit load curves) and three-parameter combined loading (as generalized plastic limit load surface) are presented on the assumption that the internal pressure, in-plane moment and out-plane moment loads were applied in a proportional manner. - Highlights: â¢ This paper presents nonlinear two-dimensional FE analysis for shell intersections. â¢ Determining the plastic limit loads under combined loading is considered. â¢ Developed maximum criterion of rate of change of relative plastic work is employed. â¢ Plastic deformation mechanism in shell intersections is discussed. â¢ Results for generalized plastic limit load curves of branch intersection are presented\n\nBallistic Limit Equation for Single Wall Titanium\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nRatliff, J. M.; Christiansen, Eric L.; Bryant, C.\n\n2009-01-01\n\nHypervelocity impact tests and hydrocode simulations were used to determine the ballistic limit equation (BLE) for perforation of a titanium wall, as a function of wall thickness. Two titanium alloys were considered, and separate BLEs were derived for each. Tested wall thicknesses ranged from 0.5mm to 2.0mm. The single-wall damage equation of Cour-Palais [ref. 1] was used to analyze the Ti wall's shielding effectiveness. It was concluded that the Cour-Palais single-wall equation produced a non-conservative prediction of the ballistic limit for the Ti shield. The inaccurate prediction was not a particularly surprising result; the Cour-Palais single-wall BLE contains shield material properties as parameters, but it was formulated only from tests of different aluminum alloys. Single-wall Ti shield tests were run (thicknesses of 2.0 mm, 1.5 mm, 1.0 mm, and 0.5 mm) on Ti 15-3-3-3 material custom cut from rod stock. Hypervelocity impact (HVI) tests were used to establish the failure threshold empirically, using the additional constraint that the damage scales with impact energy, as was indicated by hydrocode simulations. The criterion for shield failure was defined as no detached spall from the shield back surface during HVI. Based on the test results, which confirmed an approximately energy-dependent shield effectiveness, the Cour-Palais equation was modified.\n\nMeasurement of quantum noise in a single-electron transistor near the quantum limit\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nXue, W. W.; Ji, Z.; Pan, Feng; Stettenheim, Joel; Blencowe, M. P.; Rimberg, A. J.\n\n2009-09-01\n\nQuantum measurement has challenged physicists for almost a century. Classically, there is no lower bound on the noise a measurement may add. Quantum mechanically, however, measuring a system necessarily perturbs it. When applied to electrical amplifiers, this means that improved sensitivity requires increased backaction that itself contributes noise. The result is a strict quantum limit on added amplifier noise. To approach this limit, a quantum-limited amplifier must possess an ideal balance between sensitivity and backaction; furthermore, its noise must dominate that of subsequent classical amplifiers. Here, we report the first complete and quantitative measurement of the quantum noise of a superconducting single-electron transistor (S-SET) near a double Cooper-pair resonance predicted to have the right combination of sensitivity and backaction. A simultaneous measurement of our S-SET's charge sensitivity indicates that it operates within a factor of 3.6 of the quantum limit, a fourfold improvement over the nearest comparable results.\n\nGeneration of Fourier-transform-limited heralded single photons\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nU'Ren, Alfred B.; Jeronimo-Moreno, Yasser; Garcia-Gracia, Hipolito\n\n2007-01-01\n\nIn this paper we study the spectral (temporal) properties of heralded single photon wave packets, triggered by the detection of an idler photon in the process of parametric down conversion. The generated single photons are studied within the framework of the chronocyclic Wigner function, from which the single photon spectral width and temporal duration can be computed. We derive specific conditions on the two-photon joint spectral amplitude which result in both pure and Fourier-transform-limited heralded single photons. Likewise, we present specific source geometries which lead to the fulfillment of these conditions and show that one of these geometries leads, for a given pump bandwidth, to the temporally shortest possible heralded single photon wave packets\n\nSingle maximal versus combination punch kinematics.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nPiorkowski, Barry A; Lees, Adrian; Barton, Gabor J\n\n2011-03-01\n\nThe aim of this study was to determine the influence of punch type (Jab, Cross, Lead Hook and Reverse Hook) and punch modality (Single maximal, 'In-synch' and 'Out of synch' combination) on punch speed and delivery time. Ten competition-standard volunteers performed punches with markers placed on their anatomical landmarks for 3D motion capture with an eight-camera optoelectronic system. Speed and duration between key moments were computed. There were significant differences in contact speed between punch types (F(2,18,84.87) = 105.76, p = 0.001) with Lead and Reverse Hooks developing greater speed than Jab and Cross. There were significant differences in contact speed between punch modalities (F(2,64,102.87) = 23.52, p = 0.001) with the Single maximal (M+/- SD: 9.26 +/- 2.09 m/s) higher than 'Out of synch' (7.49 +/- 2.32 m/s), 'In-synch' left (8.01 +/- 2.35 m/s) or right lead (7.97 +/- 2.53 m/s). Delivery times were significantly lower for Jab and Cross than Hook. Times were significantly lower 'In-synch' than a Single maximal or 'Out of synch' combination mode. It is concluded that a defender may have more evasion-time than previously reported. This research could be of use to performers and coaches when considering training preparations.\n\nGap-related trapped magnetic flux dependence between single and combined bulk superconductors\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nDeng, Z.; Miki, M.; Felder, B.; Tsuzuki, K.; Shinohara, N.; Uetake, T.; Izumi, M.\n\n2011-01-01\n\nHighlights: â Rectangular YBCO bulks to realize a compact combination. â The gap effect was added to consider in the trapped flux density mapping. â The trapped-flux dependence between single and combined bulks is gap related. â It is possible to estimate the total magnetic flux of bulk combinations. - Abstract: Aiming at examining the trapped-flux dependence between single and combined bulk superconductors for field-pole applications, three rectangular Y 1.65 Ba 2 Cu 3 O 7-x (YBCO) bulks with a possibly compact combination were employed to investigate the trapped-flux characteristics of single and combined bulks with a field-cooling magnetization (FCM) method. A gap-related dependence was found between them. At lower gaps of 1 mm and 5 mm, the peak trapped fields and total magnetic flux of combined bulks are both smaller than the additive values of each single bulk, which can be ascribed to the demagnetization influences of the field around the bulk generated by the adjacent ones. While, at larger gaps like 10 mm, the situation becomes reversed. The combined bulks can attain bigger peak trapped fields as well as total magnetic flux, which indicates that the magnetic field by the bulk combination can reach higher gaps, thanks to the bigger magnetic energy compared with the single bulk. The presented results show that, on one hand, it is possible to estimate the total trapped magnetic flux of combined bulks by an approximate additive method of each single bulk while considering a demagnetization factor; on the other hand, it also means that the performance of combined bulks will be superior to the addition of each single bulk at larger gaps, thus preferable for large-scaled magnet applications.\n\nGap-related trapped magnetic flux dependence between single and combined bulk superconductors\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nDeng, Z., E-mail: zgdeng@gmail.co [Laboratory of Applied Physics, Department of Marine Electronics and Mechanical Engineering, Tokyo University of Marine Science and Technology, Tokyo 135-8533 (Japan); Miki, M.; Felder, B.; Tsuzuki, K.; Shinohara, N.; Uetake, T.; Izumi, M.

It is initially difficult for surgeons with limited experience to perform the surgery. We describe two cases of left adrenalectomy with a LESS combined with the addition of an accessory port. After a 2.5-cm skin incision was made at the level of the paraumbilicus to insert the primary 12-mm trocar for the laparoscope, a 5-mm nonbladed trocar was placed through the skin incision side-by-side with the primary trocar. A second 3-mm nonbladed trocar was then placed along the anterior axillary line; a multichannel trocar was not used as a single port. Both adrenalectomies were completed successfully. In patients with a minor adrenal tumor, a combined technique using LESS and an additional port is easier than LESS alone and may, therefore, be a bridge between the conventional laparoscopic approach and LESS.\n\nCombining p-values in replicated single-case experiments with multivariate outcome.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nSolmi, Francesca; Onghena, Patrick\n\n2014-01-01\n\nInterest in combining probabilities has a long history in the global statistical community. The first steps in this direction were taken by Ronald Fisher, who introduced the idea of combining p-values of independent tests to provide a global decision rule when multiple aspects of a given problem were of interest. An interesting approach to this idea of combining p-values is the one based on permutation theory. The methods belonging to this particular approach exploit the permutation distributions of the tests to be combined, and use a simple function to combine probabilities. Combining p-values finds a very interesting application in the analysis of replicated single-case experiments. In this field the focus, while comparing different treatments effects, is more articulated than when just looking at the means of the different populations. Moreover, it is often of interest to combine the results obtained on the single patients in order to get more global information about the phenomenon under study. This paper gives an overview of how the concept of combining p-values was conceived, and how it can be easily handled via permutation techniques. Finally, the method of combining p-values is applied to a simulated replicated single-case experiment, and a numerical illustration is presented.\n\nEfficient generation of 3.9 W of diffraction-limited green light with spectrally combined tapered diode lasers\n\nDEFF Research Database (Denmark)\n\nMÃ¼ller, AndrÃ©; Jensen, Ole Bjarlin; Andersen, Peter E.\n\nWe propose an efficient concept increasing the power of diode laser systems in the visible spectral range.

The Armstrong-Frederick kinematic hardening model is adopted and the Voce hardening law is incorporated for isotropic hardening behavior. Analytically, we extend sequential limit analysis to deal with combined isotropic/kinematic hardening materials. Further, exact solutions of plastic limit pressure were developed analytically by conducting both static and kinematic limit analysis. The onset of instability was also derived and solved iteratively by Newton's method. Numerically, elasticâplastic analysis is also performed by the commercial finite-element code ABAQUS incorporated with the user subroutine UMAT implemented with user materials of combined hardening. Finally, the problem formulation and the solution derivations presented here are validated by a very good agreement between the numerical results of exact solutions and the results of elasticâplastic finite-element analysis by ABAQUS. -- Highlights: â¢ Sequential limit analysis is extended to consider combined hardening. â¢ Exact solutions of plastic limit pressure are developed. â¢ The onset of instability of a spherical vessel is derived and solved numerically\n\nThe Combination of Micro Diaphragm Pumps and Flow Sensors for Single Stroke Based Liquid Flow Control.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nJenke, Christoph; PallejÃ Rubio, Jaume; Kibler, Sebastian; HÃ¤fner, Johannes; Richter, Martin; Kutter, Christoph\n\n2017-04-03\n\nWith the combination of micropumps and flow sensors, highly accurate and secure closed-loop controlled micro dosing systems for liquids are possible. Implementing a single stroke based control mode with piezoelectrically driven micro diaphragm pumps can provide a solution for dosing of volumes down to nanoliters or variable average flow rates in the range of nL/min to Î¼L/min. However, sensor technologies feature a yet undetermined accuracy for measuring highly pulsatile micropump flow. Two miniaturizable in-line sensor types providing electrical readout-differential pressure based flow sensors and thermal calorimetric flow sensors-are evaluated for their suitability of combining them with mircopumps. Single stroke based calibration of the sensors was carried out with a new method, comparing displacement volumes and sensor flow volumes. Limitations of accuracy and performance for single stroke based flow control are described. Results showed that besides particle robustness of sensors, controlling resistive and capacitive damping are key aspects for setting up reproducible and reliable liquid dosing systems. Depending on the required average flow or defined volume, dosing systems with an accuracy of better than 5% for the differential pressure based sensor and better than 6.5% for the thermal calorimeter were achieved.\n\nLimit loads for pipe bends under combined pressure and in-plane bending based on finite element limit analysis\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nOh, Chang Sik; Kim, Yun Jae\n\n2006-01-01\n\nIn the present paper, approximate plastic limit load solutions for pipe bends under combined internal pressure and bending are obtained from detailed three-dimensional (3-D) FE limit analyses based on elastic-perfectly plastic materials with the small geometry change option. The present FE results show that existing limit load solutions for pipe bends are lower bounds but can be very different from the present FE results in some cases, particularly for bending. Accordingly closed-form approximations are proposed for pipe bends under combined pressure and in-plane bending based on the present FE results. The proposed limit load solutions would be a basis of defective pipe bends and be useful to estimate non-linear fracture mechanics parameters based on the reference stress approach\n\nProtein structural model selection by combining consensus and single scoring methods.\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nZhiquan He\n\nFull Text Available Quality assessment (QA for predicted protein structural models is an important and challenging research problem in protein structure prediction. Consensus Global Distance Test (CGDT methods assess each decoy (predicted structural model based on its structural similarity to all others in a decoy set and has been proved to work well when good decoys are in a majority cluster. Scoring functions evaluate each single decoy based on its structural properties. Both methods have their merits and limitations. In this paper, we present a novel method called PWCom, which consists of two neural networks sequentially to combine CGDT and single model scoring methods such as RW, DDFire and OPUS-Ca. Specifically, for every pair of decoys, the difference of the corresponding feature vectors is input to the first neural network which enables one to predict whether the decoy-pair are significantly different in terms of their GDT scores to the native. If yes, the second neural network is used to decide which one of the two is closer to the native structure. The quality score for each decoy in the pool is based on the number of winning times during the pairwise comparisons. Test results on three benchmark datasets from different model generation methods showed that PWCom significantly improves over consensus GDT and single scoring methods. The QA server (MUFOLD-Server applying this method in CASP 10 QA category was ranked the second place in terms of Pearson and Spearman correlation performance.\n\nThe Combination of Micro Diaphragm Pumps and Flow Sensors for Single Stroke Based Liquid Flow Control\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nChristoph Jenke\n\n2017-04-01\n\nFull Text Available With the combination of micropumps and flow sensors, highly accurate and secure closed-loop controlled micro dosing systems for liquids are possible.

The design was a cohort study (nâ=â1075) among adults aged 60 years and older. Obesity was defined as body-mass index greater than or equal to 28âkg/m 2 . Mobility limitation was defined as participants scoring in the top 20% on the timed up and go test or in the slowest 20% for the 4-m walking test. The mean age of the study population was 67.4âÂ±â5.4 years (age range: 60-86 years), and 57.4% were women. Overall, 5.1% of women and 1.9% of men had both obesity and mobility limitations. During 3-year follow-up, the new incidence of T2DM was 2.98% and the adjusted risk of the new incidence of T2DM was progressively greater in obese subjects without mobility limitation, but not greater in the single mobility limitation subjects. The combination of mobility limitation and obesity (odds ratioâ=â10.3, 95% confidence intervalâ=â2.25-70.13) has a significantly higher risk than obesity only or mobility limitation only. What is more, obesity with mobility limitation could be an independent predictor of 3-year mortality compared with the other subjects. We demonstrated the associations between obesity and mobility limitation and thus the increased risk of developing, with the combination over time, T2DM and mortality.\n\nOptical power limiting and transmitting properties of cadmium iodide single crystals: Temperature dependence\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nMiah, M.

S.; Kellerman, A. C.; Spasojevic, M.; Kondrashov, D. A.; Ghil, M.; Aseev, N.; Castillo Tibocha, A. M.; Cervantes Villa, J. S.; Kletzing, C.; Kurth, W. S.\n\n2017-12-01\n\nIncreasing volume of satellite measurements requires deployment of new tools that can utilize such vast amount of data. Satellite measurements are usually limited to a single location in space, which complicates the data analysis geared towards reproducing the global state of the space environment. In this study we show how measurements can be combined by means of data assimilation and how machine learning can help analyze large amounts of data and can help develop global models that are trained on single point measurement. Data Assimilation: Manual analysis of the satellite measurements is a challenging task, while automated analysis is complicated by the fact that measurements are given at various locations in space, have different instrumental errors, and often vary by orders of magnitude. We show results of the long term reanalysis of radiation belt measurements along with fully operational real-time predictions using data assimilative VERB code. Machine Learning: We present application of the machine learning tools for the analysis of NASA Van Allen Probes upper-hybrid frequency measurements. Using the obtained data set we train a new global predictive neural network. The results for the Van Allen Probes based neural network are compared with historical IMAGE satellite observations. We also show examples of predictions of geomagnetic indices using neural networks. Combination of machine learning and data assimilation: We discuss how data assimilation tools and machine learning tools can be combine so that physics-based insight into the dynamics of the particular system can be combined with empirical knowledge of it's non-linear behavior.\n\nFinite element-based limit load of piping branch junctions under combined loadings\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nXuan Fuzhen; Li Peining\n\n2004-01-01\n\nThe limit load is an important input parameter in engineering defect-assessment procedures and strength design. In the present work, a total of 100 different piping branch junction models for the limit load calculation were performed under combined internal pressure and moments in use of non-linear finite element (FE) method. Three different existing accumulation rules for limit load, i.e., linear equation, parabolic equation and quadratic equation were discussed on the basis of FE results. A novel limit load solution was developed based on detailed three-dimensional FE limit analyses which accommodated the geometrical parameter influence, together with analytical solutions based on equilibrium stress fields. Finally, six experimental results were provided to justify the presented equation. According to the FE limit analysis, limit load interaction of the piping tees under combined pressure and moments has a relationship with the geometrical parameters, especially with the diameter ratio d/D. The predicted limit loads from the presented formula are very close to the experimental data. The resulting limit load solution is given in a closed form, and thus can be easily used in practice\n\nFixed combinations in the pragmatic management of hypertension: focus on aliskiren and hydrochlorothiazide as a single pill\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nMichel Burnier\n\n2010-05-01\n\nFull Text Available Michel BurnierService of Nephrology and Hypertension, University Hospital, Lausanne, SwitzerlandAbstract: A majority of hypertensive patients need more than one antihypertensive drug to control their blood pressure. For this reason, most guidelines have introduced the possibility of prescribing fixed-dose combination therapies as first-line treatment in hypertension. Today, the concept of fixed-dose combinations has evolved and the term single pill combination might become more appropriate to reflect the large choice of drug combinations available on the market. Recently, a new single pill combination has been launched which combines the first direct renin inhibitor aliskiren and low doses of hydrochlorothiazide. This paper reviews the potential advantages of single pill combinations and presents the first results obtained with the aliskiren/HCTZ single pill combination in hypertension.Keywords: hypertension, drug adherence, combination therapies, diuretics, renin inhibition\n\nAll-fiber 7x1 signal combiner for incoherent laser beam combining\n\nDEFF Research Database (Denmark)\n\nNoordegraaf, Danny; Maack, Martin D.; Skovgaard, Peter M. W.\n\n2011-01-01\n\nWe demonstrate an all-fiber 7x1 signal combiner for incoherent laser beam combining. This is a potential key component for reaching several kW of stabile laser output power. The combiner couples the output from 7 single-mode (SM) fiber lasers into a single multi-mode (MM) fiber. The input signal ...... in device temperature is observed. At an intermediate power level of 600 W a beam parameter product (BPP) of 2.22 mm x mrad is measured, corresponding to an M2 value of 6.5. These values are approaching the theoretical limit dictated by brightness conservation....\n\nComposite Estimation for Single-Index Models with Responses Subject to Detection Limits\n\nKAUST Repository\n\nTang, Yanlin; Wang, Huixia Judy; Liang, Hua\n\n2017-01-01\n\nWe propose a semiparametric estimator for single-index models with censored responses due to detection limits. In the presence of left censoring, the mean function cannot be identified without any parametric distributional assumptions, but the quantile function is still identifiable at upper quantile levels. To avoid parametric distributional assumption, we propose to fit censored quantile regression and combine information across quantile levels to estimate the unknown smooth link function and the index parameter. Under some regularity conditions, we show that the estimated link function achieves the non-parametric optimal convergence rate, and the estimated index parameter is asymptotically normal. The simulation study shows that the proposed estimator is competitive with the omniscient least squares estimator based on the latent uncensored responses for data with normal errors but much more efficient for heavy-tailed data under light and moderate censoring. The practical value of the proposed method is demonstrated through the analysis of a human immunodeficiency virus antibody data set.\n\nComposite Estimation for Single-Index Models with Responses Subject to Detection Limits\n\nKAUST Repository\n\nTang, Yanlin\n\n2017-11-03\n\nWe propose a semiparametric estimator for single-index models with censored responses due to detection limits.

The accessible brightness in this approach is limited by the fill factor, both in slow and fast axis. By using a geometry that accesses the BPP of the individual diodes, generating a multi kilowatt diode laser with a BPP comparable to fiber lasers is possible. We will demonstrate such a modular approach for generating multi kilowatt lasers by combining single emitter diode lasers. Single emitter diodes have advantages over bars, mainly a simplified cooling, better reliability and a higher brightness per emitter. Additionally, because single emitters can be arranged in many different geometries, they allow building laser modules where the brightness of the single emitters is preserved. In order to maintain the high brightness of the single emitter we developed a modular laser design which uses single emitters in a staircase arrangement, then coupling two of those bases with polarization combination which is our basic module. Those modules generate up to 160 W with a BPP better than 7.5 mm*mrad. For further power scaling wavelength stabilization is crucial. The wavelength is stabilized with only one Volume Bragg Grating (VBG) in front of a base providing the very same feedback to all of the laser diodes. This results in a bandwidth of BPP better than 7.5 mm*mrad, which can easily coupled into a 100 Î¼m fiber and 0.15 NA.\n\nOn the scalar electron mass limit from single photon experiments\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nGrivaz, J.F.\n\n1987-03-01\n\nWe discuss how the 90% C.L. lower limit on the mass of the scalar electron, as extracted from the single photon experiments, is affected by the way the background from radiative neutrino pair production is handled.

The literature on the use of this combination for vertebral surgery is limited. Our objective was to compare a combination of paracetamol 1 g and a lower dose of tramadol (1 mg/kg: group 1T) with a combination of paracetamol 1 g and a higher dose of tramadol (1.5 mg/kg: group 1.5T) for postoperative pain after microdisectomy surgery. Our main outcome measure was Visual Analogue Scale pain scores for 4 hours postoperatively. This prospective randomized triple-blind clinical trial was conducted at Aga Khan University Hospital, Karachi. Ninety-four patients aged between 18 and 50 years scheduled for elective single-level microdisectomy were allocated randomly into 1 of 2 groups. Twenty minutes before the end of the surgery, patients received the study drugs. There was no significant demographic difference between groups. None of the patients experienced severe pain (VAS>6). There was no significant difference in the mean pain score between groups. The mean score at 4 hours was 2.17 (1.38) in group 1.5T and 1.74 (1.37) in group 1T. The difference was not statistically significant (P=0.14). In group 1.5T, 13 patients reported having nausea and vomiting compared with 2 patients in group 1T. This was a statistically significant difference (P=0.004). The sedation score was similar between groups. The combination of low-dose tramadol (1 mg/kg) and paracetamol has comparable analgesia and a decreased incidence of nausea and vomiting compared with the higher dose of tramadol (1.5 mg/kg) and paracetamol combination.\n\nMulti-photon absorption limits to heralded single photon sources\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nHusko, Chad A.; Clark, Alex S.; Collins, Matthew J.; De Rossi, Alfredo; CombriÃ©, Sylvain; Lehoucq, GaÃ«lle; Rey, Isabella H.; Krauss, Thomas F.; Xiong, Chunle; Eggleton, Benjamin J.\n\n2013-01-01\n\nSingle photons are of paramount importance to future quantum technologies, including quantum communication and computation. Nonlinear photonic devices using parametric processes offer a straightforward route to generating photons, however additional nonlinear processes may come into play and interfere with these sources. Here we analyse spontaneous four-wave mixing (SFWM) sources in the presence of multi-photon processes. We conduct experiments in silicon and gallium indium phosphide photonic crystal waveguides which display inherently different nonlinear absorption processes, namely two-photon (TPA) and three-photon absorption (ThPA), respectively. We develop a novel model capturing these diverse effects which is in excellent quantitative agreement with measurements of brightness, coincidence-to-accidental ratio (CAR) and second-order correlation function g(2)(0), showing that TPA imposes an intrinsic limit on heralded single photon sources. We build on these observations to devise a new metric, the quantum utility (QMU), enabling further optimisation of single photon sources.

This combination of DPM with the SPI scheme overcomes a low optical throughput problem that has occasionally prevented us from obtaining quantitative-phase images in DPM through use of a high-sensitivity single-channel photodetector such as a photomultiplier tube (PMT). The introduction of a PMT allowed us to perform PC with ease and thus solved a dynamic range problem that was inherent to SPI. As a proof-of-principle experiment, we performed a comparison study of analogue-based SPI-DPM and PC-SPI-DPM for a 125-nm-thick indium tin oxide (ITO) layer coated on a silica glass substrate. We discuss the basic performance of the method and potential future modifications of the proposed system.\n\nlimit loads for wall-thinning feeder pipes under combined bending and internal pressure\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nJe, Jin Ho; Lee, Kuk Hee; Chung, Ha Joo; Kim, Ju Hee; Han, Jae Jun; Kim, Yun Jae\n\n2009-01-01\n\nFlow Accelerated Corrosion (FAC) during inservice conditions produces local wall-thinning in the feeder pipes of CANDU.

Based on finite element limit analyses, this paper compare limit loads for wall-thinning feeder pipes under combined bending and internal pressure with proposed limit loads.

Raheel; Hong, Melissa J.; Kim, Yun-Hee; Hong, Keum-Shik\n\n2015-01-01\n\nDeception is a human behavior that many people experience in daily life. It involves complex neuronal activities in addition to several physiological changes in the body. A polygraph, which can measure some of the physiological responses from the body, has been widely employed in lie-detection. Many researchers, however, believe that lie detection can become more precise if the neuronal changes that occur in the process of deception can be isolated and measured. In this study, we combine both measures (i.e., physiological and neuronal changes) for enhanced lie-detection. Specifically, to investigate the deception-related hemodynamic response, functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is applied at the prefrontal cortex besides a commercially available polygraph system. A mock crime scenario with a single-trial stimulus is set up as a deception protocol. The acquired data are classified into âtrueâ and âlieâ classes based on the fNIRS-based hemoglobin-concentration changes and polygraph-based physiological signal changes. Linear discriminant analysis is utilized as a classifier. The results indicate that the combined fNIRS-polygraph system delivers much higher classification accuracy than that of a singular system. This study demonstrates a plausible solution toward single-trial lie-detection by combining fNIRS and the polygraph.

D.; Skovgaard, P. M. W.; Johansen, J.; Becker, F.; Belke, S.; Blomqvist, M.; Laegsgaard, J.\n\n2011-02-01\n\nWe demonstrate an all-fiber 7x1 signal combiner for incoherent laser beam combining. This is a potential key component for reaching several kW of stabile laser output power. The combiner couples the output from 7 single-mode (SM) fiber lasers into a single multi-mode (MM) fiber. The input signal fibers have a core diameter of 17 Î¼m and the output MM fiber has a core diameter of 100 Î¼m. In a tapered section light gradually leaks out of the SM fibers and is captured by a surrounding fluorine-doped cladding. The combiner is tested up to 2.5 kW of combined output power and only a minor increase in device temperature is observed. At an intermediate power level of 600 W a beam parameter product (BPP) of 2.22 mm x mrad is measured, corresponding to an M2 value of 6.5. These values are approaching the theoretical limit dictated by brightness conservation.\n\nQuartz-Seq2: a high-throughput single-cell RNA-sequencing method that effectively uses limited sequence reads.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nSasagawa, Yohei; Danno, Hiroki; Takada, Hitomi; Ebisawa, Masashi; Tanaka, Kaori; Hayashi, Tetsutaro; Kurisaki, Akira; Nikaido, Itoshi\n\n2018-03-09\n\nHigh-throughput single-cell RNA-seq methods assign limited unique molecular identifier (UMI) counts as gene expression values to single cells from shallow sequence reads and detect limited gene counts. We thus developed a high-throughput single-cell RNA-seq method, Quartz-Seq2, to overcome these issues. Our improvements in the reaction steps make it possible to effectively convert initial reads to UMI counts, at a rate of 30-50%, and detect more genes. To demonstrate the power of Quartz-Seq2, we analyzed approximately 10,000 transcriptomes from in vitro embryonic stem cells and an in vivo stromal vascular fraction with a limited number of reads.\n\nPredictive inference for best linear combination of biomarkers subject to limits of detection.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nCoolen-Maturi, Tahani\n\n2017-08-15\n\nMeasuring the accuracy of diagnostic tests is crucial in many application areas including medicine, machine learning and credit scoring. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve is a useful tool to assess the ability of a diagnostic test to discriminate between two classes or groups. In practice, multiple diagnostic tests or biomarkers are combined to improve diagnostic accuracy. Often, biomarker measurements are undetectable either below or above the so-called limits of detection (LoD). In this paper, nonparametric predictive inference (NPI) for best linear combination of two or more biomarkers subject to limits of detection is presented. NPI is a frequentist statistical method that is explicitly aimed at using few modelling assumptions, enabled through the use of lower and upper probabilities to quantify uncertainty. The NPI lower and upper bounds for the ROC curve subject to limits of detection are derived, where the objective function to maximize is the area under the ROC curve. In addition, the paper discusses the effect of restriction on the linear combination's coefficients on the analysis. Examples are provided to illustrate the proposed method.

The novel design is based on a standard 6.3 mm i.d. fiber-optic SMA adapter with a drilled opening for the separation capillary to go through, to which two concentrically positioned C(4)D detection electrodes with a detection gap of 7 mm were added on each side acting simultaneously as capillary guides. The optical fibers in the SMA adapter were used for the photometric signal (absorbance), and another optical fiber at a 45 degrees angle to the capillary was applied to collect the emitted light for FD. Light emitting diodes (255 and 470 nm) were used as light sources for the PD and FD detection modes. LOD values were determined under flow-injection conditions to exclude any stacking effects: For the 470 nm LED limits of detection (LODs) for FD and PD were for fluorescein (1 x 10(-8) mol/L) and tartrazine (6 x 10(-6) mol/L), respectively, and the LOD for the C(4)D was for magnesium chloride (5 x 10(-7) mol/L). The advantage of the three different detection signals in a single point is demonstrated in capillary electrophoresis using model mixtures and samples including a mixture of fluorescent and nonfluorescent dyes and common ions, underivatized amino acids, and a fluorescently labeled digest of bovine serum albumin.\n\nSingle-stage posterior transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion, debridement, limited decompression, 3-column reconstruction, and posterior instrumentation in surgical treatment for single-segment lumbar spinal tuberculosis.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nZeng, Hao; Wang, Xiyang; Zhang, Penghui; Peng, Wei; Liu, Zheng; Zhang, Yupeng\n\n2015-01-01\n\nThe aim of this study is to determine the feasibility and efficacy of surgical management of single-segment lumbar spinal tuberculosis (TB) by using single-stage posterior transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion, debridement, limited decompression, 3-column reconstruction, and posterior instrumentation. Seventeen cases of single-segment lumbar TB were treated with single-stage posterior transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion, debridement, limited decompression, 3-column reconstruction, and posterior instrumentation. The mean follow-up was 36.9 months (range: 24-62 months). The kyphotic angle ranged from 15.2-35.1Â° preoperatively, with an average measurement of 27.8Â°. The American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) score system was used to evaluate the neurological deficits and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) used to judge the activity of TB. Spinal TB was completely cured in all 17 patients. There was no recurrent TB infection. The postoperative kyphotic angle was 6.6-10.2Â°, 8.1Â° in average, and there was no significant loss of the correction at final follow-up. Solid fusion was achieved in all cases. Neurological condition in all patients was improved after surgery. Single-stage posterior transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion, debridement, limited decompression, 3-column reconstruction, and posterior instrumentation can be a feasible and effective method the in treatment of single-segment lumbar spinal TB.\n\nMajor Limitations of Satellite images\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nAl-Wassai, Firouz A.; Kalyankar, N.

Fixed-dose combinations (FDCs) of these drugs are widely recommended. Objectives To compare the efficacy, safety, and acceptability of anti-tuberculosis regimens given as fixed-dose combinations compared to single-drug formulations for treating people with newly diagnosed pulmonary tuberculosis. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Infectious Disease Group Specialized Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, published in the Cochrane Library, Issue 11 2015); MEDLINE (1966 to 20 November 2015); EMBASE (1980 to 20 November 2015); LILACS (1982 to 20 November 2015); the metaRegister of Controlled Trials; and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP), without language restrictions, up to 20 November 2015. Selection criteria Randomized controlled trials that compared the use of FDCs with single-drug formulations in adults (aged 15 years or more) newly diagnosed with pulmonary TB. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion, and assessed the risk of bias and extracted data from the included trials. We used risk ratios (RRs) for dichotomous data and mean differences (MDs) for continuous data with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We attempted to assess the effect of treatment for time-to-event measures with hazard ratios and their 95% CIs. We used the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' assessment tool to determine the risk of bias in included trials. We used the fixed-effect model when there was little heterogeneity and the random-effects model with moderate heterogeneity.

In this paper, we present a high-resolution fluorescence microscope setup which combines the advantages of SMLM with SIM in order to provide high-precision localization and structural information in a single setup. Furthermore, the combination of the wide-field SIM image with the SMLM data allows us to identify artifacts produced during the visualization process of SMLM data, and potentially also during the reconstruction process of SIM images. We describe the SMLM-SIM combo and software, and apply the instrument in a first proof-of-principle to the same region of H3K293 cells to achieve SIM images with high structural resolution (in the 100 nm range) in overlay with the highly accurate position information of localized single fluorophores. Thus, with its robust control software, efficient switching between the SMLM and SIM mode, fully automated and user-friendly acquisition and evaluation software, the SMLM-SIM combo is superior over existing solutions.\n\nStrategies and limits in multi-stage single-point incremental forming\n\nDEFF Research Database (Denmark)\n\nSkjÃ¸dt, Martin; Silva, M.B.; Martins, P.

The solution is based on the net-section plastic collapse concept and, therefore, gives limit load values based on the Tresca yielding criterion. Solutions for both cases with and without crack face contact are derived when whole or part of the crack is located in the compressive stress zone. From the solution, particular global limit load solutions for plates with extended surface cracks and through-thickness cracks under the same loading conditions are obtained. The solution is consistent with the limit load solution for surface cracks in plates under combined tension and positive bending due to Goodall and Webster and Lei when both the applied end force and bending moment are positive. The solution reduces to the limit load solution for plain plates under combined end force and cross-thickness bending when the crack vanishes. - Highlights: â A global limit load solution for plates with surface cracks in plates is derived. â Combined positive/negative end force and positive/negative cross-thickness moment are considered. â The solution is based on the net-section plastic collapse concept.\n\nEvaluation of a single-item screening question to detect limited health literacy in peritoneal dialysis patients.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nJain, Deepika; Sheth, Heena; Bender, Filitsa H; Weisbord, Steven D; Green, Jamie A\n\n2014-01-01\n\nStudies have shown that a single-item question might be useful in identifying patients with limited health literacy. However, the utility of the approach has not been studied in patients receiving maintenance peritoneal dialysis (PD). We assessed health literacy in a cohort of 31 PD patients by administering the Rapid Estimate of Adult Literacy in Medicine (REALM) and a single-item health literacy (SHL) screening question \"How confident are you filling out medical forms by yourself?\" (Extremely, Quite a bit, Somewhat, A little bit, or Not at all). To determine the accuracy of the single-item question for detecting limited health literacy, we performed sensitivity and specificity analyses of the SHL and plotted the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve using the REALM as a reference standard. Using a cut-off of \"Somewhat\" or less confident, the sensitivity of the SHL for detecting limited health literacy was 80%, and the specificity was 88%. The positive likelihood ratio was 6.9. The SHL had an AUROC of 0.79 (95% confidence interval: 0.52 to 1.00). Our results show that the SHL could be effective in detecting limited health literacy in PD patients.\n\nCombination of structured illumination and single molecule localization microscopy in one setup\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nRossberger, Sabrina; Best, Gerrit; Birk, Udo; Cremer, Christoph; Baddeley, David; Heintzmann, Rainer; Dithmar, Stefan\n\n2013-01-01\n\nUnderstanding the positional and structural aspects of biological nanostructures simultaneously is as much a challenge as a desideratum.

The development of new biomaterials combined with modern endodontic and periodontal regeneration techniques may improve dental prognosis and maintain the affected teeth. Moreover, 1 of the replacement options for those teeth, dental implants, has shown an increasing number of biological and technical complications. Five patients were included in this case series study. Full periodontal and radiographic examination revealed generalized chronic periodontitis. Moreover, endodontic-periodontal lesions affecting single-rooted teeth were detected in those patients with tissue destruction beyond the apex. After splinting those teeth, conventional endodontic and nonsurgical periodontal treatment was performed. Three months later, periodontal regeneration was applied at those teeth in order to reconstruct supporting tissues and to improve dental prognosis. After a follow-up period ranging from 14Â months to 17Â years, it was observed that all teeth remain asymptomatic and in normal function. No signs of apical pathosis were observed, and the periodontium was stable. All patients were included in a strict maintenance program to check the periodontal and apical status. This case series shows that it is possible to change the prognosis of teeth affected by combined endodontic-periodontal lesions, even if the periodontal support is destroyed beyond the apex.

We predict two metastable single-layer In phases, one sqrt[7]Ãsqrt[3] phase with a coverage of 1.4 monolayer (ML; here 1Â ML refers to one In atom per top Si atom) and the other sqrt[7]Ãsqrt[7] phase with 1.43Â ML, which indeed agree with experimental evidences. Both phases reveal quasi-1D arrangements of protruded In atoms, leading to 2D-metallic but anisotropic band structures and Fermi surfaces. This directional feature contrasts with the free-electron-like In-overlayer properties that are known to persist up to the double-layer thickness, implying that the ultimate 2D limit of In overlayers may have been achieved in previous studies of double-layer In phases.\n\nA numerical analysis on forming limits during spiral and concentric single point incremental forming\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nGipiela, M. L.; Amauri, V.; Nikhare, C.; Marcondes, P. V. P.\n\n2017-01-01\n\nSheet metal forming is one of the major manufacturing industries, which are building numerous parts for aerospace, automotive and medical industry. Due to the high demand in vehicle industry and environmental regulations on less fuel consumption on other hand, researchers are innovating new methods to build these parts with energy efficient sheet metal forming process instead of conventionally used punch and die to form the parts to achieve the lightweight parts. One of the most recognized manufacturing process in this category is Single Point Incremental Forming (SPIF). SPIF is the die-less sheet metal forming process in which the single point tool incrementally forces any single point of sheet metal at any process time to plastic deformation zone. In the present work, finite element method (FEM) is applied to analyze the forming limits of high strength low alloy steel formed by single point incremental forming (SPIF) by spiral and concentric tool path. SPIF numerical simulations were model with 24 and 29 mm cup depth, and the results were compare with Nakajima results obtained by experiments and FEM. It was found that the cup formed with Nakajima tool failed at 24 mm while cups formed by SPIF surpassed the limit for both depths with both profiles. It was also notice that the strain achieved in concentric profile are lower than that in spiral profile.\n\n[Treatment of pediatric distal femur fractures by external fixator combined with limited internal fixation].\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nWei, Sheng-wang; Shi, Zhan-ying; Hu, Ju-zheng; Wu, Hao\n\n2016-03-01\n\nTo discuss the clinical effects of external fixator combined with limited internal fixation in the treatment of pediatric distal femur fractures. From January 2008 to June 2014, 17 children of distal femur fractures were treated by external fixator combined with limited internal fixation. There were 12 males and 5 females, aged from 6 to 13 years old with an average of 10.2 years, ranged in the course of disease from 1 h to 2 d. Preoperative diagnoses were confirmed by X-ray films in all children. There were 11 patients with supracondylar fracture , and 6 patients with intercondylar comminuted fracture. According to AO/ASIF classification, 9 fractures were type A1, 5 cases were type A2,and 3 cases were type C1. The intraoperative and postoperative complications, postoperative radiological examination, lower limbs length and motion of knee joints were observed. Knee joint function was assessed by KSS score. All the patients were followed up from 6 to 38 months with an average of 24.4 months. No nerve or blood vessel injury was found. One case complicated with the external fixation loosening, 2 cases with the infection of pin hole and 3 cases with the leg length discrepancy. Knee joint mobility and length measurement (compared with the contralateral), the average limited inflexion was 10 degrees (0 degrees to 20 degrees), the average limited straight was 4 degrees (0 degrees to 10), the average varus or valgus angle was 3 degrees (0 degrees to 5 degrees). KSS of the injured side was (96.4 +/- 5.0) points at final follow-up, 16 cases got excellent results and 1 good. All fractures obtained healing and no epiphyseal closed early was found. External fixator combined with limited internal fixation has advantages of simple operation, reliable fixation, early functional exercise in treating pediatric distal femurs fractures.\n\nA neoteric multidrug combination: novel approach to limited cutaneous systemic scleroderma involving the face\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nKumar, M Hari; Kumar, M Siva; Kumar, Sabitha Hari; Kumar, Kingsly Selva\n\n2016-01-01\n\nLimited cutaneous scleroderma is a subtype of scleroderma limited to the skin of the face, hands, feet and forearms.

In vitro assays and mucosal tissues were used to evaluate anti-HIV activity. Viability (Lactobacilli only) and epithelial integrity in cell lines and mucosal tissues defined safety. The gels were acidic and viscous. DPV gel had an osmolality of 893Â mOsm/kg while the other gels had an osmolality of <100Â mOsm/kg. MVC release was similar from the single and combination gels (~5Â Î¼g/cm(2)/min(1/2)), while DPV release was 10-fold less from the single as compared to the combination gel (0.4331Â Î¼g/cm(2)/min(1/2)). Titrations of the gels showed 10-fold more drug was needed to protect ectocervical than colonic tissue. The combination gel showed ~10- and 100-fold improved activity as compared to DPV and MVC gel, respectively. All gels were safe. The DPV/MVC gel showed a benefit blocking HIV infection of mucosal tissue compared to the single entity gels. Combination products with drugs affecting unique steps in the viral replication cycle would be advantageous for HIV prevention.\n\nCoherent laser beam combining\n\nCERN Document Server\n\nBrignon, Arnaud\n\n2013-01-01\n\nRecently, the improvement of diode pumping in solid state lasers and the development of double clad fiber lasers have allowed to maintain excellent laser beam quality with single mode fibers.

Performance improved with increasing feature contrast and was strongly correlated among both tasks. Subjects performed significantly better with combined cues than with single cues. The improvement due to cue summation was stronger than predicted by the assumption of independent feature specific mechanisms, and increased with the performance level achieved with single cues until it was limited by ceiling effects. Further, cue summation was also strongly correlated among tasks: when there was benefit due to the additional cue in feature contrast detection, there was also benefit in figure identification. For the same performance level achieved with single cues, cue summation was generally larger in figure identification than in feature contrast detection, indicating more benefit when processes of shape and surface formation are involved. Our results suggest that cue combination improves spatial form completion and figure-ground segregation in noisy environments, and therefore leads to more stable object vision.\n\nEfficacy and safety of the single-capsule combination of fluticasone/formoterol in patients with persistent asthma: a non-inferiority trial\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nMarti Antilla\n\n2014-12-01\n\nFull Text Available OBJECTIVE: Fluticasone and formoterol are effective in the treatment of asthma. When a corticosteroid alone fails to control asthma, combination therapy is the treatment of choice. The objective of this study was to compare the efficacy and safety of formulations containing budesonide/formoterol (BUD/FOR, fluticasone alone (FLU, and the single-capsule combination of fluticasone/formoterol (FLU/FOR on lung function in patients with mild-to-moderate persistent asthma. METHODS: This was a randomized, multicenter, open phase III trial conducted in Brazil. The primary efficacy analysis was the assessment of non-inferiority between FLU/FOR and BUD/FOR combinations regarding FEV1 (in L at the final visit. The secondary analyses were PEF, level of asthma control, serum cortisol levels, frequency of adverse events, adherence to treatment, and appropriate inhaler use. RESULTS: We randomized 243 patients to three groups: FLU/FOR (n = 79, BUD/FOR (n = 83, and FLU (n = 81. In terms of the mean FEV1 after 12 weeks of treatment, the difference between the FLU/FOR and BUD/FOR groups was 0.22 L (95% CI: â0.06 to 0.49, whereas the difference between the FLU/FOR and FLU groups was 0.26 L (95% CI: â0.002 to 0.52. Non-inferiority was demonstrated by the difference between the lower limits of the two 95% CIs (â0.06 vs. â0.002. The level of asthma control and PEF were significantly greater in the FLU/FOR and BUD/FOR groups than in the FLU group. There were no significant differences among the groups regarding patient adherence, patient inhaler use, or safety profile of the formulations. CONCLUSIONS: The single-capsule combination of FLU/FOR showed non-inferiority to the BUD/FOR and FLU formulations regarding efficacy and safety, making it a new treatment option for persistent asthma.\n\nInactivation of Listeria in Foods Packed in Films Activated with Enterocin AS-48 plus Thymol Singly or in Combination with High-Hydrostatic Pressure Treatment\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nIrene Ortega BlÃ¡zquez\n\n2017-11-01\n\nFull Text Available The aim of the present study was to determine the efficacy of films activated with enterocin AS-48 plus thymol singly, or in combination with high-hydrostatic pressure (HHP on the inactivation of Listeria innocua in sea bream fillets and in fruit puree stored under refrigeration for 10 days. L. innocua proliferated in control fish fillets during storage. The activated film reduced viable Listeria counts in fillets by 1.76 log cycles and prevented growth of survivors until mid-storage. Application of HHP treatment to fillets packed in films without antimicrobials reduced Listeria counts by 1.83 log cycles, but did not prevent the growth of survivors during storage. The combined treatment reduced viable counts by 1.88 log cycles and delayed growth of survivors during the whole storage period. L. innocua survived in puree during storage. The activated film reduced Listeria counts by 1.80 and 2.0 log cycles at days 0 and 3. After that point, Listeria were below the detection limit. No viable Listeria were detected in the purees after application of HHP treatment singly, or in combination with the activated film. Results from the study indicate that the efficacy of activated films against Listeria is markedly influenced by the food type.\n\nCombined EGFR and VEGFR versus single EGFR signaling pathways inhibition therapy for NSCLC: a systematic review and meta-analysis.\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nXinji Zhang\n\nFull Text Available BACKGROUND: Lung cancer is a heterogeneous disease with multiple signaling pathways influencing tumor cell survival and proliferation, and it is likely that blocking only one of these pathways allows others to act as salvage or escape mechanisms for cancer cells. Whether combined inhibition therapy has greater anti-tumor activity than single inhibition therapy is a matter of debate. Hence, a meta-analysis comparing therapy inhibiting both VEGFR and EGFR signaling pathways with that inhibiting EGFR signaling pathway alone was performed. METHODOLOGY AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We searched PubMed, EMBASE database and the proceedings of major conferences for relevant clinical trials. Outcomes analyzed were objective tumor response rate (ORR, progression-free survival (PFS, overall survival (OS and toxicity. Besides, subgroup analyses were performed to investigate whether the combined inhibition therapy is best performed using combination of selective agents or a single agent with multiple targets. Six trials recruiting 3,302 patients were included in the analysis. Combined inhibition therapy was associated with a 3% improvement in OS as compared with single-targeted therapy, but this difference was not statistically significant (HR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.89-1.05; P=0.472. Patients receiving combined inhibition therapy had significant longer PFS than the group with single-targeted therapy (HR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.67-0.95; P=0.011. There was no difference in the ORR between the groups (OR, 1.44; 95% CI, 0.95-2.18; P=0.085. Subgroup analysis revealed that combined inhibition therapy using combination regimens was associated with statistically significant improvement in both ORR and PFS. Toxicity was greater in combined inhibition therapy. CONCLUSIONS: There is no evidence to support the use of combined inhibition therapy in unselected patients with advanced NSCLC. However, given the significant advantage in ORR and PFS, combined inhibition therapy using combination\n\nCombining features from ERP components in single-trial EEG for discriminating four-category visual objects\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nWang, Changming; Xiong, Shi; Hu, Xiaoping; Yao, Li; Zhang, Jiacai\n\n2012-10-01\n\nCategorization of images containing visual objects can be successfully recognized using single-trial electroencephalograph (EEG) measured when subjects view images. Previous studies have shown that task-related information contained in event-related potential (ERP) components could discriminate two or three categories of object images. In this study, we investigated whether four categories of objects (human faces, buildings, cats and cars) could be mutually discriminated using single-trial EEG data. Here, the EEG waveforms acquired while subjects were viewing four categories of object images were segmented into several ERP components (P1, N1, P2a and P2b), and then Fisher linear discriminant analysis (Fisher-LDA) was used to classify EEG features extracted from ERP components. Firstly, we compared the classification results using features from single ERP components, and identified that the N1 component achieved the highest classification accuracies. Secondly, we discriminated four categories of objects using combining features from multiple ERP components, and showed that combination of ERP components improved four-category classification accuracies by utilizing the complementarity of discriminative information in ERP components. These findings confirmed that four categories of object images could be discriminated with single-trial EEG and could direct us to select effective EEG features for classifying visual objects.\n\nSingle and combined toxicity of copper and cadmium to H. vulgare growth and heavy metal bioaccumulation\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nÅ½altauskaitÄ J.\n\n2013-04-01\n\nFull Text Available The single and combined effects of copper (Cu and cadmium (Cd (0.1-10 mg Lâ1 in spring barley (Hordeum vulgare L. plants grown in hydroponics are investigated. The aim of the study was to investigate the interactive effect of the binary mixture of Cu and Cd to the growth of H. vulgare and accumulation of these metals by the plants. Single and combined metal treatment led to major effects in the growth of roots and shoots and dry weight of barley. Exposure to metals altered the content of photosynthetic pigments and caused lipid peroxidation. It was observed that combined effects of heavy metals to plants are endpoint and concentration depending. The binary mixture Cu+Cd exhibited additive or less than additive interaction for dry weight, root length and shoot height. Analysis of tissue metal concentrations showed that Cu and Cd were mainly accumulated in the roots and the combination of Cu+Cd had less than additive response of metal bioaccumulation in the leaves and roots.\n\nA calderÃ³n-preconditioned single source combined field integral equation for analyzing scattering from homogeneous penetrable objects\n\nKAUST Repository\n\nValdé s, Felipe; Andriulli, Francesco P.; Bagci, Hakan; Michielssen, Eric\n\n2011-01-01\n\nA new regularized single source equation for analyzing scattering from homogeneous penetrable objects is presented.

Indeed, the sensitivity of dark-adapted vision approaches limits set by the quantal nature of light. This sensitivity requires neural mechanisms that selectively transmit quantal responses and suppress noise. Such mechanisms face an inevitable tradeoff because signal and noise cannot be perfectly separated, and rejecting noise also means rejecting signal. We report measurements of single-photon responses in the output signals of the primate retina. We find that visual signals arising from a few absorbed photons are read out fundamentally differently by primate On and Off parasol ganglion cells, key retinal output neurons. Off parasol cells respond linearly to near-threshold flashes, retaining sensitivity to each absorbed photon but maintaining a high level of noise. On parasol cells respond nonlinearly due to thresholding of their excitatory synaptic inputs. This nonlinearity reduces neural noise but also limits information about single-photon absorptions. The long-standing idea that information about each photon absorption is available for behavior at the sensitivity limit of vision is not universally true across retinal outputs. More generally, our work shows how a neural circuit balances the competing needs for sensitivity and noise rejection. Copyright Â© 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
