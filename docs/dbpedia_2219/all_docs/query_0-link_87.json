        "text": "Participatory music making in/as participatory culture: Music Learning and Teaching at the Online Academy of Irish Music’s Offline Summer School, Liscannor, Ireland In “Music as Social Life: The Politics of Participation,” Thomas Turino posits that music making be “conceptualize[d] in relation to different realms or fields of artistic practice” (2008, p. 15). For ‘real-time’ music making, Turino explains, this means that performances can be divided into one of two categories: 1) presentational music making, whereupon “one group of people, the artists, prepare and provide music for another group, the audience,” and 2) participatory music making, in which “there are no artist-audience distinctions, only participants and potential participants performing different roles, the primary goal being to involve the maximum number of people in some performance role” (p. 26). The latter of the two categories is of particular importance for this paper because central to Turino’s proposition is the idea that social music learning in community is necessary in order for successful participatory music making to occur. Similar to Turino’s idea of ‘participatory music making’ is what media researcher Henry Jenkins theorizes as ‘participatory culture,’ that is, the culture that results when “private persons do not act as consumers only, but also as contributors or producers” within an affinity group; Jenkins originally developed the idea of ‘participatory culture’ with new media education settings in mind (2006, p. 6). By drawing on this ongoing ethnographic/cyber ethnographic qualitative study of the Online Academy of Irish Music (OAIM) – an online music school based in Ireland and which also sponsors offline “summer schools” for its members – the purpose of this paper is to discuss the relevance of Turino’s and Jenkins’ ideas but applied instead to a convergent on and offline music learning and teaching context. Both concepts were used to frame this study, with ‘participatory music making’ situated within the larger context of ‘participatory culture.’ While Turino’s and Jenkins’ ideas come from wildly divergent fields – ethnomusicology and new media respectively – both are based on similar social learning ideals, that, when integrated, have implications for music learning and teaching. In the online OAIM, formal music instruction within formal music learning practices and delivered digitally through video, audio and community forums; OAIM students thus learn in a re-contextualized setting through immersion online. In 2013, from its location in Liscannor, Ireland, the OAIM began sponsoring offline “summer school” music weeks to its students, with the aim of intertwining skills already developed through virtual instruction with teaching in a more “authentic” geographical setting delivered face-to-face by OAIM’s tutors. Questions include: How do participants perceive the difference(s) between the “real thing” – live, unfettered, participatory music making in the culture of origin – and music learning and teaching in a structured online environment, which, it could be argued, is a simulacrum of participatory music making? How does “embeddedness” in a culture – even for a short amount of time – influence music learning (if indeed it does)? Does “situatedness” matter”? How does the intersection of on and offline facilitate music learning and teaching?\n\nSocietal and technological progresses have created a multitude of new ways for people to engage with music, and as a result music can nowadays be learned from an ever-expanding variety of sources. In this article, we engage in a theoretical exploration of the underpinning societal forces that have enabled this expansion, as well as its significance for the development of musical identity and knowledge. The exploration proceeds through sociological theories of modernity and theories of sociocultural learning. Examples from a recent ethnographic study of the Finnish online music community Mikseri provide insight into how musical identities can be constructed and maintained in web-based reality, as well as how online music sites may function as communities of practice where the members, through sharing and discussing their own music, develop music-related knowledge. A discussion about the implications of the current media-musical situation for music education practice and research is provided."
