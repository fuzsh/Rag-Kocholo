In October 2019, over one million people marched through the streets of Santiago whilst President Sebastian Piñera declared a state of emergency. Demonstrators used a range of mediums for expression, like artistic performances in the form of music collaborations; these included renditions of Chilean ‘nueva canción’ (‘new song’) compositions.\n\nRecognised as an enduring Latin American cultural phenomenon combining folk and protest symbolism within its compositions, ‘nueva canción’ remains connected with revolutionary narratives, particularly with the rise of Salvador Allende’s government (Diaz-Inostroza, 2016; McSherry, 2015; Garcia, 2013). Even though it emerged in the early 1960s with Violeta Parra’s contribution and matured in the early 1970s alongside performers like Victor Jara and ensembles such as Quilapayún and Inti-Illimani, the movement has persisted in being deeply connected with Chilean leftist ideals overall.\n\nThis paper will explore the active role of ‘nueva canción’ within Chile’s contemporary context of social protests and widespread discontent, looking to decipher how an artistic movement that arguably belongs in the past, can still be accessed and reformulated into contemporary significance. From impromptu collective street performances to more structured and coordinated orchestral renditions, compositions and features of this musical movement continue to function as effective vehicles of expression. This evaluation will attempt to provide a sharper vision of ‘nueva canción’ as a persistent and rich repository of protest culture and revolutionary themes.\n\nReferences:\n\nAndrade, E.

Within hip-hop scholarship there is a common distinction made between conscious rap and gangsta or party rap. Much of the analysis and understanding of hip-hop’s political capacities has been located in lyrical content, for good reason. Yet, there are other capacities of hip-hop beyond the lyrical, and beyond the explicitly political, that have yet to be fully explored for their transformative and decolonial potential. The core hip-hop ethic to represent combined with the aesthetics of remixing and practices of sampling provides a method for reorienting, reframing, and re-embodying, ancestral knowledge and practice for the future delinking from the colonial discourse of tradition as locked in the past. In doing so hip-hop facilitates a maintenance of ways of being in opposition to colonial thinking, structures and stereotypes. The dominant oppressive discourses countered in much conscious rap all have deep effects on the mind (Thiongo 1985) and the body with profound impact on how bodies are affectively inhabited (Fanon 1967). The embodied affect of coloniality is perpetuated through ‘subtle’ interactions between bodies as Fanon’s reflection on his encounter with the white gaze articulates. Hip hop provides a particular stance, or mode of inhabiting the body – a way of grasping the world (Merleau-Ponty 1964) - of navigating post-apocalyptic lifeworlds through a mode of rhythmic embodied wording that centres knowledge of self and deep connection to place.\n\nDrawing on ethnographic research on Xhosa hip-hop in South Africa and Warlpiri hip-hop in Australia, this paper argues for a sensory understanding of emcee practice, for the hip-hop body as a locus of political practice.\n\nSudiipta Shamalii Dowsett is a Research Associate at the University of New South Wales working on the ARC Linkage project Indigenous Futurity: Milpirri as Experimental Ceremony. Her broader research focuses on how hip-hop functions as a decolonial practice. Her PhD (2017) on hip-hop in Khayelitsha, South Africa and subsequent work explores how artists utilise hip-hop to make sense of complex neo-colonial contexts, revitalise language and culture, and embody and embed Ancestral art forms within the contemporary global performance culture of hip-hop by active forms of cultural (re)production, remixing, asserting and claiming place in the world.\n\nRadoš Mitrović, University of Arts in Belgrade\n\nHip Hop Song as the “Soundtrack” of Major Political Upheaval in Montenegro\n\nAfter adopting the so-called Law on Freedom of Religion in Montenegro, 27.12.2019. massive civil protests were launched. They followed the principles of non-violent civil resistance, with very innovative tactics of activism. Well designed, without violence, with active use of social networks, and especially the so-called meme pages, the citizens managed to fight for the changes that followed in 2020. At these mass demonstrations, appropriate musical songs were also regularly played, among which one stood out, and became a kind of protest soundtrack. It is the song “Sviće, sviće rujna zora” by the socially active hip-hop group Beogradski Sindikat (Belgrade Syndicate). It is based on the elements of traditional Montenegrin music, as well as the song “Još ne sviće rujna zora”. Using, in fact, strong symbolism, which can be found both in music and lyrics, this song sends a clear message and has the function of raising the morale of the protesters. The music video itself was designed as a series of authentic recordings from the protest, i.e. “litije”, as these walks were called. In this sense, the track is full of dramatic elements that affect the emotional awareness of the recipients (currently the song has almost 6 million YouTube views, which, bearing in mind that Montenegro, according to the last census, has a little more than 600,000 inhabitants, is certainly a huge success). In my paper, I will analyze the different levels of meaning of this song, as well as the ways of its effect. It is an activist song, which undoubtedly significantly contributed to the massive fight against, not only the law but also the entire system.\n\nRadoš Mitrović (Радош Митровић) (Belgrade, 1989) PhD.

Leidinger, University of Groningen\n\nBaraye Azadi – Music at the 2022 Iranian Feminist Protest Movement\n\nSince the 1979 revolution, women as well as ethnic, religious and queer minorities have been massively oppressed in Iran. Over the years, there have been repeated uprisings against the mullahs' regime, which have been violently dispersed. Following the death of 22-year-old Iranian Kurdish woman Mahsa Jina Amini in early September 2022 after being taken into custody by the morality police, she has become the leading figure of the biggest protest movement in Iran since 1979. And if she is the face of the movement, the song \"Baraye Azadi\" (\"For Freedom\") by Iranian singer Shervin Hajipour is the soundtrack of the protest movement. Hajipour, who was allegedly arrested after the release of this song, assembled the lyrics using hundreds of tweets describing what people in Iran are protesting for (i.e. \"for freedom, for my sister, for the future of my kids\"), and provided the protesters with a musical voice through this song. In this conference presentation, I will place the Iranian feminist protest wave 2022 in the historical context of women's rights movements in Iran before examining the song \"Baraye Azadi\" in relation to protest music in Iran in order to draw attention to the specific meaning of this song and to describe why this protest wave is like no previous one.\n\nNora Leidinger is a research master student in Arts, Media and Literary studies and junior lecturer and researcher in the department of Arts, Culture and Media at the University of Groningen.

The collective sharing and practice of voting and streaming tutorials clearly demonstrate their movement of strategic consumption as cultural consumers. Some fan communities, such as the BTS fandom, have begun to use this collective power to raise their voices on social issues in addition to using it as a means for their own internal interests. Could this fan activism contribute to human, individual and collective flourishing? On what societal issues does their collective consciousness be awakened? How are movements organized and carried out to make their voices heard? This series of questions will ultimately provide an opportunity to know, at least in part, whether grassroot movement of participatory culture has potential as an alternative to the culture of consumption as Jenkins (2006) hoped and as a lever for individual and collective flourishing for which Hesmondalgh (2013) emphasized the important valeur of music in our individual and collective life. The goal of this study is therefore to analyze the value of the music fan community in our collective life. To do this, we conducted an online ethnographic observation of the Facebook pages of the two BTS fan clubs, who were active in this collective movement en France (BTS France and BTS ARMY France). As a result of the study, it was found that their collective consciousness was more sensitive to environmental and racism issues. They learn how to act for others and for the planet by undertaking various charitable and environmental projects. In particular, when there have been problems of racism towards artists and Asian and black communities, the French ARMY has shown strong cooperation and solidarity to inform and condemn it and to support the collective movement.\n\nWoojin Na: I am a PhD student in Information and Communication Science at the University of Paris 8 and currently belong to the laboratory of CEMTI (Center for Studies on Media, Technology, and Internationalization).

In parallel, Jackson’s sacred music, whether she sung in churches, concerts or political events, conveyed a highly effective sonic subtext of social uplift and hope. With an ability to craft an effective musical message to various audiences, Jackson brought gospel music to the highest levels of national attention. For example, scholarship notes her performance of the national anthem of the United States at an inaugural gala for President John F. Kennedy in 1961 as a hallmark of gospel music’s recognition. Jackson also sung the Spiritual “I’ve Been Buked and I’ve Been Scorned” and gospel song “How I Got Over” before Martin Luther King Jr. gave his “I have a Dream” speech at the March on Washington in 1963. These two distinct occasions demonstrate her versatility and major accomplishments as a gospel singer. Yet, a closer study of her nationally significant performances suggests that her experiences in politics were more nuanced than current writings indicate. Furthermore, the spiritual dimensions of her musical work remain understudied. Hence, through the study of varied archival sources I seek to offer a newly detailed account of Jackson’s remarkable contributions to American political life.\n\nNina Öhman, Ph.D. is a Core Fellow at the Helsinki Collegium for Advanced Studies, University of Helsinki.

The band was scheduled to perform at the Harare International Festival of the Arts (HIFA) in 2014, but was deported from the country shortly before the concert was to take place and only allowed to return to perform four years later.\n\nThe paper wants to position the song and its accompanying music video in the social and political landscape of Zimbabwe at the time and use it as an example to showcase the relationship between music and social/political struggles as well as music as a social/political force. To do this, the situation in Zimbabwe and the position of Robert Mugabe will be retraced to the point of the song’s release and the ensuing consequences.\n\nAt the same time, the paper will also look at Freshlyground’s role as a multi-national band addressing social issues in their music. In addition, the consequences of performing the song in Zimbabwe will be highlighted in connection to issues such as artistic freedom and freedom of speech. In this sense, Freshlyground will be looked at as musical activists that try to spread messages for social change in their music, inspiring their audience to take a stand for positive change.\n\nStefanie Barschdorf is an independent researcher, who completed her PhD at the University of Vienna.

However, they rarely explain what ‘solidarity’ means, and how music may generate, sustain, strengthen, or express it. This paper therefore investigates how solidarity as a political concept intertwines with musical practices. It develops a model with four prongs: ontology, sociality, mobilisation, and intentionality. Each explores a different facet of solidarity as a relation between people that centres a sense of togetherness and support.\n\nTo delimit this research, I focus on popular music during the 1984–85 UK miners’ strike. The strike was a crisis in a period characterised by polarisation not dissimilar to the 2020s. It thus emerges as a relevant moment for the study of music and solidarity. Artists like Billy Bragg, Paul Weller, and Bronski Beat openly supported the miners. Using discourse analysis, musical analysis, and philosophical inquiry, I examine how these musicians and activists mobilised the word ‘solidarity’ when discussing music, what this music sounded like, and what these discourses and sounds uncover about perceptions of solidarity and music’s connection to politics.\n\nI argue that ‘solidarity’ is a multivalent and underdefined, yet rhetorically powerful word. It is therefore perfectly suited to imbue popular music with political meaning and agency, particularly during moments of crisis. In turn, popular music is perceived as a medium that can rescue solidarity from extinction, co-construct its meaning, and broadcast this meaning to the people. Musicological analysis can reveal underlying assumptions about solidarity, including its fundamental processes of in- and exclusion. Music researchers can therefore make meaningful contributions to both scholarship and activism, by critically investigating the history and use of concepts central to the connection between music and politics.\n\nMoira de Kok recently graduated with an MA in Musicology from Utrecht University in the Netherlands. She is broadly interested in the intersections between music, media, and socio-political themes. A prime example of this is her master’s thesis on the connection between solidarity and popular music in the 1984–85 miners’ strike, which she will present in abridged form at the Music, Research, and Activism conference. Other enduring interests include the Eurovision Song Contest, the aesthetics of music on YouTube, and music’s ability to cross and blur diegetic lines. She is currently preparing for her PhD journey.\n\nMathieu Guillien, Université d’Évry\n\nThe Politics of Techno\n\nFrom chanson française to chilean Nueva canción, popular music from the twentieth century often stems from political movements. More than most, the African-American musical tradition, born in slavery, is in itself a statement of political and cultural resistance. During the second half of the twentieth century, this tradition both enhanced and sublimed the Civil Rights movement through soul music, funk and rap.\n\nWith the advent of the hip-hop culture, another music genre, albeit African-American as well, was significantly overlooked : namely techno. Amongst other clues explaining this incongruity, we can pinpoint the proximity of techno with disco and the LGBTIQ culture, as well as more strictly musical specificities such as techno's absence of lyrics, which made the genre a less likely candidate than rap to champion the political message arising from the African-American ghetto.\n\nAnother bias is at work when considering the political dimension of techno. Indeed, rather than immediately associating the genre with African-American societal issues, one generally considers techno to be correlated with key political moments of the European popular music scene : the English youth rebelling against the Thatcher administration, the suppression of the rave scene in France, or the German reunification, when Berlin became the epicenter of a cultural renewal with techno as its soundtrack.\n\nThrough a study of Underground Resistance, the prominent techno label from Detroit, the goal of our paper is to highlight the inherent activism of techno, from its anti-capitalist creed to the defense of the Native American cultural heritage, by way of environmental and social justice issues, anti-war protest and defense of cultural diversity.\n\nBorn in Paris in 1983, Mathieu Guillien discovered electronic dance music at the age of 10. Already following a classical music training to become a pianist, various encounters encouraged him to eventually undertake academic studies and write about techno music, at a time when such a topic was unwelcome in the French academia. This led to the completion of his doctoral thesis in 2011, published three years later under the title La Techno minimale. He has been teaching the history of African-American music between 2005 and 2015 at the Sorbonne Nouvelle University, and since 2017 at the University of Evry.\n\nResistance and Community Organisation 4\n\nSession 8, Wed 10 May, at 14:00, Topelia: C 120\n\nDominik Schlienger, University of the Arts Helsinki, and Liisa Tuomi, University of Helsinki\n\nGaia Lava – A low carbon performance stage\n\nIn this joint presentation, we introduce the Gaia Lava project, a (low carbon) platform for artistic research and practices.\n\nGaia Stage (or Gaia Lava) is a zero-carbon performance stage for music and other performances and art events. Its main power source are generator bikes, swings, and weights — kinetic energy produced by the participating audience, additionally supported by locally sourced wind and solar power. Rather than using batteries as buffer storage, the energy shall be stored in a water-filled flywheel.\n\nGaia Stage implements alternative, simple, and sustainable technologies in a socially sustainable way: the organisation to run Gaia Stage, will be a rekisteröity yhdistys, and everybody who works for it shall be paid the same wage. As an association, Gaia Stage can raise money through organising events – but it can also receive donations tax free, and will be independent from investors who expect returns. Artists who perform on Gaia Stage hence know that every cent goes back into a more sustainable infrastructure.\n\nGaia Stage as an organisation has 3 aims:\n\n1.) Raising awareness of environmental issues in the music industry and beyond.\n\n2.) Providing a (low carbon) platform for artistic research and practices.\n\n3.) Development of alternative economic models for infrastructure projects in the music industry\n\nGaia stage is experimental in multiple ways: it enables experimental performance practices, experimental technologies, even experimental social economy. The experimental possibilities engender a whole series of research questions.\n\nThe multidisciplinary nature of the project, its definition via artistic practice and conceptual art, is only possible through a multitude of independences:\n\nGaia Stage is not associated to one university in particular, so it can get involved with a number of them, and even engender collaborations across institutions. As Gaia Stage is not a business either, there are no commercial conflicts between academia and the business world. Its techniques and technologies are developed according to participatory design principles and entirely open source.\n\nGaia Stage enables emergent research: Through its experimental nature, new research topics can emerge, not everything is predetermined: Experimentation, and non-predetermination are important principles in the Gaia Lava project.\n\nLiisa Tuomi Dr. Mus, MSc Sociology, recently defended her thesis “Pop Singer in the Media.

Case study of LGBTQ+ Mixed Choir Vikerlased\n\nMusic is a powerful tool for regulating emotions and maintaining mental well-being. Making music together connects people, as 'our music' creates a sense of belonging and unity. Choral singing has been a common activity among minority and under-represented groups, as well as by people with similar values. In our study, we examine the motivation of the members of the Estonian LGBTQ+ mixed choir Vikerlased (founded in 2017), focusing on psychological and identity-political aspects of singing. Furthermore, we look at how the joint singing contributes to the mental well-being of the choir members, both on the individual and group level, including within the choir and as supposedly people with LGBTQ+ identity in Estonian society. More broadly, we look at a globally widespread phenomenon – identity-based music – in a local context, focusing on the concert experience at the LGBTQ+ community's most symbolic series of events, the Pride Festival in Helsinki. For data gathering, we will use combined methods: participatory observation, a questionnaire and focus group interviews. Results will be analysed globally and locally within the local LGBTQ+ movement history and the Estonian choir movement.\n\nBrigitta Davidjants studies the subcultural organization during the transition from late socialism to a post-communist society in Estonia.

Nearly five percent of Finns sing in a choir, but little research has explored the potential of such music hobbies to become spaces for social and environmental activism.\n\nOur case study focuses on the Finnish mixed choir Koiton Laulu that is well known for its strong linkages to the political song movement in the 1970s. We wanted to examine what kind of societal causes the choir has prioritised in its activities from 1970s to 2020s, and how the choir supports the growth of its members as humans.\n\nThe data consist of semi-structured individual interviews (N=16) and two Timeout group dialogue discussions (N=27) organised with members of the choir in the fall of 2020. Interviewees had joined the choir at various times in the past five decades. Qualitative content analysis was used to analyse the data, using the concepts of ecosocial Bildung, inclusion and collaborative learning as theoretical background.\n\nOur results indicate that Koiton Laulu still maintains its traditional themes of labour rights, peace, and international solidarity, but the past two decades have brought global sustainability issues such as human rights and environmental issues more to the forefront. Although the repertoire and performances of the choir lean strongly on the values of social justice, the ideals of equity in participation do not always materialize within the choir itself. According to the interviewees, challenges in the internal functioning of the choir could be addressed through increased dialogue promoting safer, equal, and pluralistic interaction.\n\nThe research findings will be composed into a choral piece and performed at an event celebrating the 70th anniversary of Koiton Laulu in early 2023. Parts of that piece could potentially be played during the paper presentation.\n\nThe research team is composed of chorists from interdisciplinary backgrounds: MA Riikka Suhonen is a Doctoral Researcher in the Faculty of Educational Sciences (University of Helsinki) with background in humanities and social sciences; Dr. Hannele Cantell is Associate Professor and University Lecturer in the Faculty of Educational Sciences (University of Helsinki); Dr. Hanna Weselius is University Lecturer in Photography in the Department of Art and Media (Aalto University), and MA Terhi Kouvo with background in Ethnology is currently working within science publishing in the field of adult education.\n\nResistance and Community Organisation 5\n\nSession 12, Wed 10 May, at 15:45, Topelia: C 120\n\nSam Coley, Birmingham City University\n\nBallade de la Désescalade: Profiling Graeme Allwright as Activist\n\nThis paper explores the life and work of musician/activist Graeme Allwright and considers his legacy as a champion of social justice. When Allwright died in 2020 at the age of 93, his obituary in Le Monde referred to him as “a humanist singer with an atypical life” and hailed his early songs as “the anthems” of the 68 French student rebellion. Allwright’s translations/adaptations of protest songs by Bob Dylan, Pete Seeger and Woody Guthrie, amongst others, made the socialist themes of 50s, 60s American folk music accessible to French audiences and especially resonated with the ‘soixante-huitards’ who brought down the Gaullist regime. I consider the distinctions between Allwright’s interpretations and the original works he translated, alongside an assessment of his own protest related compositions. The paper then explores the various protest movements Allwright was aligned to throughout his life and considers how these causes impacted on his musical output. Allwright was a truly global artist. Born in New Zealand in 1926, he moved to France in 1948 and subsequently travelled the world, capturing experiences that fed into his work. His repertoire was intensely humanist: consistently anti-militarist, anti-nuclear, and anti-consumerism. Yet while he was well known in the 60s and 70s, I suggest his refusal to follow traditional artist/fan relationships led to his marginalisation in later life. This paper calls for a reappraisal of Allwright’s position in the pantheon of ‘la chanson Francaise’, and as an influencer of French left-wing counterculture.\n\nDr Sam Coley is Associate Professor (International) for the Faculty of Arts, Design and Media at Birmingham City University UK, where he teaches a range of audio production modules.

This was expressed not only in opposition to the Communist state, with its police, army, education and psychiatric facilities, but also in attacks on the ‘conformist’ working class under late socialism and particularly on the Roma community, who were seen as a Communist-protected minority. As such, some punks engaged in radically anti-social acts that resembled those of the predominantly right-wing skinheads and hooligans. Meanwhile, a new and more self-reflective group of Czech punks with ties to alternative culture was voicing its opposition to fascism and moving steadily towards anarchism. Anarchist punks, in particular, were instrumental in organizing the first groups to oppose the far right. They were joined by other young members of alternative scenes, including relatively new ones that had emerged among Czech young people at the end of 1980s (for example, skateboarding and hardcore scenes) as well as some remnants of former underground and alternative groups under socialism. While Czech antifascism after 1989/1990 was based to some degree on a blank slate after the fall of the communist dictatorship, research on earlier modes of anti-fascism has helped identify key anti-fascist tropes, particularly from Germany. Both the history of political violence in western Germany and the German autonomist movement strongly influenced Czech antifascism. As a result, the latter tended to have a revolutionary mission that understood antifascism as the first step in the radical re-building of society. Research in punk fanzines of the early 1990s, also proved their green anarchist leanings by opposing nuclear energy, promoting the activities of Animal Liberation Front, and with critiques of militarism, and the direct action tactics of radical ecologists were also put into practice in violent protests against the annual horse race in Pardubice in 1991 and 1992.\n\nOndřej Daniel, PhD is working as a historian in the Seminar on General and Comparative History within the Department of Global History at Charles University’s Faculty of Arts.

On the one hand, the distinction of the Mexico-U.S. border as the world’s busiest land crossing point illustrates the dimension of the existing dynamics and flows. On the other hand, the policies and means employed by the U.S. government have been characterized by a material, legal and psychological harshness.\n\nBottom-up practices, in the form of activism or that use art forms and cultural traditions, have proven to be meaningful in the mediation of intercultural communications between diverse societies, particularly in contexts such as the Mexico-U.S. border where asymmetric power relations exist.\n\nThe current paper presents a case study, Fandango Fronterizo. An annual cultural event that operates in the Mexico-U.S. border and whose activities are rooted on a traditional form of community celebration, the fandango, that includes music, dance, and singing.\n\nThe aim of this paper is to present the bottom-up organizational practices and means in which social value and justice are created at this event, as well as the impact of this traditional practice to local and migrant communities on the border.\n\nFinally, the non-Western values, principles, narratives, images, socio-cultural outcomes, and other elements produced by Fandango Fronterizo’s practices are assessed in terms of how they mediate intercultural communications between diverse societies. Therefore, proposing the case as an example of non-state, decolonial, and bottom-up form of cultural diplomacy.\n\nPaola Nieto is a cultural manager and performing artist from Mexico City, based in Helsinki.

Yet the Siraya have been strengthened with a spiritual awareness and determination that has helped them to thrive in contemporary Taiwan. Similar to the experiences of other indigenous communities elsewhere in the world, the Siraya people face a struggle to assert their identity and have their rights officially recognized by the Taiwanese government. In recent years, their cause has gained momentum due to the activism of Filipino-Taiwanese musician Edgar Macapili, his Sirayan-based household, and the Sirayan alliance. I investigate and assess the efficacy of Macapili’s musicking advocacy to achieve full official recognition of the Siraya community in Taiwan. In addition, I explore how contextual theology reflects an appreciation for ecology expressed within Siraya Christian music-making. I also analyze how Macapili’s music mediates in a reformed context, and what do cultural rights mean in Siraya music? This prompts the question how the contextualization concept revitalizes Siraya cultural identity, as they continue to deploy music as a vehicle for social justice, with their unrelenting efforts to pressure the Taiwanese government for equity and inclusion, hopefully leading to official recognition.\n\nChia-An (Victor) Tung was born in Tainan City, Taiwan.

A three-year research project at the University of Oulu and Jyväskylä University of Applied Sciences combine science and art, focusing on deafness and deaf history. Methodological starting point for the study is oral history research as the focus of the research is on the deaf people's memories of music education.\n\nBased on the interviews (N=85), it is possible to classify the lack of actual music education, especially during the oralistic period of education (officially until 1970). Many scholars and activists compare the era of oralism to colonialism: sign language and deaf people were oppressed in a society and school system that favored the hearing and speaking. Among the older generation of deaf people there are a few memories related to music education, as it depended entirely on the teachers’ own attitudes and skills. During the oralistic period, music education was strongly associated with the training of hearing and speech. Teachers used music to teach deaf and hard of hearing students to hear and speak, rather than to learn or enjoy music. However, the hegemony of the hearing in music and music education has been challenged in recent years.\n\nIn this presentation we ask following questions: what is deaf music like? How do deaf people perceive music? Based on preliminary results show that most of them sense with their body, but if they use hearing aids one can sense through hearing, depending on the high or low sound. In addition to that, deaf people experience vibrations and sound waves with their bodies. The presentation takes the form of a dialogue between a deaf and hearing researcher\n\nOuti Ahonen is a PhD researcher, and Senior Lecture at Humak University of Applied Science.\n\nKatja Sutela is a post doc researcher, and a University Lecturer in music education at University of Oulu.

While the material power of white gay men afforded them access to leisure spaces, London’s lesbians worked in a cultural contraflow to provide their own spaces of pleasure. This activism was anti-capitalist and inclusive, it came from a DIY (Do it Yourself) approach, grounded in post-punk methods and Black British sound system culture’s influences. Designing, printing and distributing their own flyers and publicity, lesbian promoters and DJs worked collaboratively to secure venues and club nights upsetting the city’s gendered spaces and practices (Massey). These were fragile and short-lived events that existed on the peripheries and edges of the straight and gay club scenes.\n\nThe music of the Black Atlantic played on this scene (funk, soul, jazz and reggae) offered imaginings of hope and redemption (Gilroy). The messages in the music chimed with many of London’s Black, white and diasporic lesbians, presenting a sonic and imagined escape from the oppressive and threatening environments that women faced every day, at home, in work, on the street, and as lesbians. The music played was repurposed and refashioned in these women-only spaces by the lesbian dancers and DJ’s, creating an alternative imaginary world and offering ‘wiggle room’ (Ahmed) for women to expand into and express themselves.\n\nThis paper offers ephemeral items (flyers, mixtapes, playlists) as a method to recover and retell the history of the cultural activism that lesbians were involved in. Connecting these archival fragments with queer oral history accounts from lesbians who were on this scene, the resulting stories disrupt (Summerskill et al) existing histories of nightclubbing, centring on the experiences of queer women to tell a vibrant musical history.\n\nKatherine Mary Griffiths: A former and some-time DJ who played in London in the 1980s and 1990s on the lesbian and straight scenes.

Ethnomusicology, activism and community engagement in Ons Island (NW Iberian Peninsula)\n\nThe ethnomusicological studies proposed from the more conventional Academy offer a neutral and objective analysis of the data collected in the field, thus turning ethnomusicologists into neutral, non-political observers of the cultural and social processes of their objects of study. However, problems as urgent as ethnic inequalities, class inequalities, the right to cultural representation and the protection of cultural diversity seem to be left out of the ethnomusicological research agenda. Building on Appadurai's concept of \"research from below\" (1996) and \"performance studies\" proposed by Diana Taylor (2003), I propose a type of activist ethnomusicological research that is both politically engaged and scholarly.\n\nIn this communication I will address the problems that arise from the application of activist research methodologies, such as (self)reflection on my political positions and how these affect my research projects, collaboration during the research process with members of the local community and, ultimately, the social responsibility of the Academy. To do this, I will start from the long-term ethnographic fieldwork carried out with the women of Ons Island (NW Iberian Peninsula) between 2018 and 2021, which led to the creation of an audiovisual archive in collaboration with the Galician Culture Council and the recovery by the local community of its vocal musical repertoire accompanied with tambourines as well as its most representative dances.\n\nXulia Feixoo (Vigo, 1987) has a degree in Ethnomusicology (Vigo, 2016), a degree in History of Art (Santiago de Compostela, 2010) and in Percussion (Vigo, 2010).

Today, ‘the rise of populism’, which pits ‘good people’ against ‘corrupt elites’, pervades the political climate; with Poland and Hungary exemplifying its rapid escalation. The nationalism and authoritarianism of many European parties are now often inseparable from their populism. Popular music is at times used by populists to normalize their ideas, but so far, its role in movements that resist populism has been under-researched. In my presentation, I analyze the different multimodal strategies of resisting (right-wing, authoritarian) populism as expressed in protest music based on examples from Poland.\n\nIn 2015, a populist-nationalist party, Law and Justice (PiS) won the elections in Poland. Since then, widespread opposition to the party’s increasingly authoritarian and nationalist policies continues to manifest within movements that bring anti-populism to the streets; often with song and dance. By now, over 80 songs have been written to challenge PiS’ continued rule, diverse anti-PiS playlists have been shared on Spotify, and music became the central practice of protests with the emergence of so-called ‘techno-blocades’ and with lyric-inspired protest banners.\n\nAs I will show, the dichotomies that authoritarian populism relies on per definition are challenged within much of such protest music which presents new ways of defining ‘the will of the people’. Through lyrics, sound, and visuals, the protesters subvert populist-nationalist narratives, combine transgressive fun with serious political commentary, while also often reaching the cultural mainstream. By showing how social divides can be complicated, protest music has the potential to deconstruct right-wing populists’ self-proclaimed monopoly on the ‘will of the people’ and undermine their myth that society can be cleanly divided into fundamentally opposed groups of ‘the [conservative] people’ and the liberal ‘(pseudo)elites’.\n\nJoanna Zienkiewicz is a PhD candidate at the University of Groningen.

Indeed, U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders, for many the leading figure of the contemporary U.S. Left, recently held a talk on U.S. working class music, during which his recorded examples were overwhelmingly drawn from this period. In fact, two of the seven recordings were taken from the same 1941 album, CPUSA-affiliated musical group the Almanac Singers’ “Talking Union.” However, this has led to a situation in which the musical cultures of the U.S. diverse working classes have been coded as trans-historically Appalachian, as it was on the musical styles of this region that CPUSA folk-revivalists developed their notions of ‘folk-music.’\n\nFor example, the music of the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW), arguably the U.S. socialist organization best-known for its musical output (1909-1917), is almost always recorded in an Appalchian-derived style, despite there being little evidence that its famous songs were performed this way. In fact, primary sources relevant to the early IWW’s music indicate a heterogeneous performance practice reflective of its international, multi-ethnic membership. The earliest extant recording of an IWW song, Finnish-American singer Hannes Saari’s 1928 Finnish-langauge recording of Joe Hill’s 1915 IWW anthem “Workers of the World, Awaken” (“Proletaaarit Nouskaa”), arranged as a march and performed by a small orchestra, lends further credence to the thesis that IWW music was performed in a diversity of styles. Through a systematic analysis of the relevant evidence, this presentation will reveal the diversity of the IWW’s musical life in order to break the hold Popular Front folk-revivalism has on contemporary U.S. left-wing musical practice.\n\nJackson Albert Mann is a Ph.D student in ethnomusicology.

South Africa is a country steeped in histories of jazz closely tied to black-led anti-colonial, and later, anti-apartheid struggle, and questions of violent gender dynamics have always been raised within these histories.\n\nThe post-democratic state prioritized both racial and gender injustices, and contemporary jazz musicians are embedded within social discourses superficially interested in “change.” This paper will draw on qualitative material offered by South African women jazz artists to interrogate their multi-layered gendered experiences through an intersectional lens as marginal individuals and how these experiences tie into traditional African constructions of gender and sexuality, and subsequent limitations they place on women jazz performers. It will be a critical analysis of the presence, practice and impact of hegemonic notions of gender and sexuality within normative jazz culture in South Africa, and will illuminate some of their narratives on gendered surveillance over their bodies and careers, and explore these artists’ strategies to subvert this.\n\nAimée George is a South African contemporary jazz vocalist and emerging intersectional pro-feminist scholar.

In her previous research endeavors, Aimee interrogates the intersections and complexities of gender, power and sexuality dynamics for jazz women performers in Cape Town. Her intellectual interests are rooted in the constructions and representation of gender identity, gender performativity and displays of masculinity/femininity within jazz arenas, the politics and multiplicity of blackness within jazz scholarship as well as African feminist and queer epistemology.\n\nGrace Healy\n\nFrom the Archives: British Punk, Fanzines and Rock Against Prejudice!\n\nWhen punk exploded onto the music scene in the 1970s, the wider socio-political environment in Britain was one of resurgent fascism, racial tensions and misogyny. In 1976 the National Front gained political ground winning 18.5% of the vote in Leicester and 10% in Bradford, and the national press engaged in relentless attacks on immigrants. In 1979, an anti-abortion bill was introduced by Conservative MP John Corrie, posing a threat to women's rights. This paper examines, primarily through an engagement with the punk fanzine collection and other archival material at Bishopsgate Institute (London, UK) the strong anti-racist, anti-fascist and anti-sexist thread running through 1970s British punk-rock. It examines the role both music and fanzines played in the creation and ongoing development of social movements Rock Against Racism (RAR) and Rock Against Sexism (RAS), and the ways in which RAR and RAS organised and campaigned alongside other movements to combat the threat of racism and misogyny in both the punk scene itself and wider British society.\n\nGrace Healy has a PhD from the University of Huddersfield, UK.

This includes the ways in which vocalists use their lyrics, music videos, stage aesthetics and album imagery to engage with their feminism and do feminist activism. This paper will dedicate attention to the reasons why vocalists are choosing to do feminist activism through their music with consideration of the importance vocalists attribute to their feminism and their ability to bring their feminist activism into the genre. This is significant given the historically anti-feminist and misogynistic environment extreme metal has fostered. Nevertheless, the rise of feminism in the genre in recent years has allowed extreme metal to become a space where vocalists are able to shout back against oppressive narratives and experiences in the genre. The motivations for choosing specific feminist topics, both specific to extreme metal and wider society, will be highlighted, including why they have spoken about these topics within extreme metal. Lastly, the paper will examine what the conventions of extreme metal music can do for feminists by addressing the ways in which extreme metal allows feminists to do feminist activism in new and exciting ways.\n\nMelissa Arkley is a third year PhD student in Communications, Media and Cultural Studies at the University of Huddersfield, UK.

He inscribed his violins, violas, and cellos with the letters ‘TIMBFG NBOS’, meaning ‘this instrument may be freely given, never bought or sold’, a label that stripped his creations permanently of monetary value at their very inception. Besides his rejection of the market economy he also eschewed all electric tools, preferring to embrace and rediscover, through research and experimentation, the most traditional aspects of the luthier’s craft. He tracked down old materials for his instruments and in the 1980s made the first ensemble of ‘baroque’ instruments on the continent. From that decade he also gave thousands of hours of demonstrations in public exhibitions and museums around Australia, and volunteered at the Powerhouse Museum, Sydney. Public accolades of Johnson late in his life, as well as articles published in his memory, acknowledged that his generosity was connected to his political convictions. In 1932 he joined the Communist Party, in which he later met his wife Phyllis Johnson, née Mather (1917-2009). They were active in demonstrations for the decolonisation of Indonesia in the mid-1940s, and lifelong supporters of union movements. Johnson spent time in the Torres Strait and advocated for the rights of the islands’ Indigenous populations; in Sydney he contributed to the raising of awareness of Aboriginal people’s struggles. In the 1990s he constructed a string quartet in honour of Jessie Street (1889-1970), a prominent campaigner for women’s rights and Indigenous rights, and Australia’s first woman delegate to the United Nations. When publicly exhibiting these instruments-in-progress, he displayed information about Street’s life and work.

Music, Performance, and Corporeality in the Feminist Movements in Vienna\n\nThe surge in the cases of gender-based violence and femicide in Latin America in recent years has sparked a social outburst in the region. Feminist groups are addressing this social problem calling for protests and leading actions of visibility and denunciation through growing efforts coming from collectives and organizations, as well as from scholarly and artistic spaces. In their struggle against patriarchal violence, the ideas and practices articulated through music and artistic performances have gained increasing visibility expanding to other feminist groups outside the region who adopt and transfer these ideas and practices to their own context.\n\nThe basis for this paper is the analysis of the practices and processes that music and the artistic performance afford and promote within these feminist movements. We focus on the autonomous feminist movement in Vienna around the alliance \"Claim the Space\" and take as an example the performance of Las Tesis \"Un violador en tu camino\" and Vivir Quintana's song \"Canción sin miedo\". Both have achieved great popularity in Vienna with versions in different languages and adaptations into the context of a variety of political and social struggles.\n\nFor the analysis, we depart from understanding music and sounds as iterable musical marks with the ability to adapt to different social and political contexts. This musical mark has a close link with corporeality and the body in the performance, which entails an impact on the way in which the activist message is articulated, transmitted, and reproduced. Our purpose is to examine the interaction and dynamics between music, corporeality, and discourse in the transmission of the activist message, to determine the extent to which participation in the artistic performance in the context of feminist protests can help strengthen the sense of community and thus empower new participants and new forms of activism.\n\nTessa Balser-Schuhmann (she/her) is a musicologist working on her master's thesis on voice and the category of social class.

The role and scope of contemporary music and sound art are increasingly considered against the backdrop of modernist tradition and dogmas such as aesthetic purity, the ideal of l'art pour l’art, and detachment from societal or earthly matters. Thanks to the Frankfurt School of thought in general, and Adorno and his Philosophy of New Music in particular, contemporary music composers and organizers for too long remained wary of possible criticism the social and political engagement of contemporary music might spark. In recent years, this seems to be less and less the case as contemporary music and sound art festivals are proving to be actively engaging in positive social change, promoting diversity, equity, and inclusion, questioning their power structures, and engaging in expanding their communities, audiences, networks, collaborators, and partners. This mobilization of communities takes place at festivals through a wide variety of activities, formats, and initiatives. One of them is the Sounds Now network, an initiative of 9 European music festivals and art centers that address music and sound curating as a creative strategy that enables the reshuffling of the hierarchical power structures while allowing new and underrepresented voices to enter the professional field. In this paper, I would like to consider the agency, empowerment, community-building capacities, and resistance of contemporary music and sound art as intrinsic and address it as an aesthetic category integral to the compositional and sound art practice. If contemporary music and sound art are to remain sustainable, relevant, and necessary in our current turbulent times of political, societal, and environmental upheaval, we need to radically reconsider their social and political potential for community building, transnational solidarities, justice, and care.\n\nMonika Żyła is a musicologist, cultural theorist, author, artistic director, and pianist.

With the rise of the ecological movements, they have also accompanied the rise of environmental awareness and eco-activism. The use of feminine characteristics associates nature with care, nourishment, and life-giving roles such as conception and birth (Hrdy 2000). Therefore, nature is shaped by gender conflicts and sexist conventions: The perception of nature as a benevolent, permissive, but violated woman is open to affective approaches. At the same time, it promotes the idea that nature, if treated appropriately, can serve as a commodity.\n\nIn response to this problem, Ecofeminism emerges as an academic, intellectual, and social current within the environmental movements. Its manifestations range from the anti-nuclear-movement (e.g. Mütter gegen Atomkraft in Germany) to the testimonials of ecological “heroines” (Radkau 2011) such as Wangaari Maathai, Vandana Shiva, and Medha Paktar. Their binding link is to explore intersections of environmentalism and feminism and to draw on a feminist position to reconcile humanity’s relationship with nature.\n\nTo what extent is ecofeminism a topic of pop music? And in which way does ecofeminist pop music contribute to political activism through music? Is there any potential for political education? Whereas the Welsh singer MARINA, in cooperation with the Russian band Pussy Riot, delivers a sharp critique of the patriarchal system and its environment consequences (Man’s World, 2020; Purge The Poison, 2021), Icelandic artist Björk offers a Gaia-inspired invitation to reconciliation (Náttúra, 2011) and singer-songwriter Tracy Chapman reflects environment-related guilt and violation (The Rape of the Earth, 1995). Across genres, songs popularize ecofeminist tropes, shorten them to stereotypes, and complement them with aesthetic stimulus. The analysis of textual and sound regimes not only offers a hybrid mirror of political communication on ecofeminism through politainment (Riegert/Collins 2016); it also permits to discover latent structures of social systems (Luhmann 2005) by unveiling societal dynamics which are mostly ignored in the public discourse.\n\nHrdy, S.B.

Grounded in the recently published chapter Victims No More: How Women and Non-binary Musicians are Collaborating for Gender Justice in Jazz (Nunes & Arnaut, 2022), this presentation will discuss applied strategies from women and non-binary activists in jazz, that in the last decade have been collaborating in structured organizations in order to overcome imbalanced power dynamics, such as sexual harassment and abuse. Even though scholars agree that jazz persists as a heteronormative male environment, questions remain on how to achieve gender equality. The actions taken by women and non-binary jazz feminists and activists address these lingering questions.\n\nThis presentation frames the struggles and contributions of women and non-binary activists advocating for gender minorities in jazz, regarding a historical overview of the intersection of women’s rights and jazz since the 1970s, and documenting the contributions of contemporary organziations such as ‘Jazzwomen and Girls Advocates’, ‘We Have Voice’ and ‘Women in Jazz Organization’. Data collection includes a literature review and interviews with activists and musicians Ellen Seeling, Roxy Coss and Sara Serpa.\n\nBy investigating these organizations’ policies, achievements and different perspectives about the concepts of gender and intersectionality, we discuss their main strategies such as networking, creating mentorship programs and non-normative educational sites, targeting festivals’ hiring policies and pledging for parity in music industry.\n\nBeatriz Nunes is a Phd student in Ethnomusicology at Universidade Nova de Lisboa with the research project “Jazz, gender and performance in a conservatory cultural system”.

The literature is consistent in placing this instrument in warlike contexts dated back to the 17th century, and its use in the present-day Mapuche musical practices is very significant. This paper aims to inform the first findings from a larger ethnographic research that examines some popular musics performed in the Region of Los Lagos, Chile, which incorporate music elements linked to the Mapuche culture. The main aim of that research relates to the study of musical representations that may reveal links between the music performed by some musicians and his territorial activism. In this paper, I present the background information that shows the construction of a Mapuche musical movement, as well as the analysis developed that exposes the emergence of some music elements that could be understood as topic representations. As a result of that, I found the presence of a musical topic that I regard as “Mapuche in resistance”, which is based on the object of “the trutruka playing in warlike context” and expressed through musical items performed by a trutruka, or that incorporate mimetic allusions about this instrument. Finally, I discuss the possible uses of this analysis and its influence for decentralizing the ethnomusicology practices in the Chilean context, as well as the capability of diverse approaches to determine musical topics.\n\nIgnacio Soto-Silva holds a Ph.D in musicology from University of Valladolid.

When the transculturation happens between cultures with equal power relations – cultures that don’t dominate over the other – there is hardly any issue involved with it. But when the musical inspiration is drawn from oppressed cultures, there is a risk of cultural appropriation. However, even strong, live cultures can be misrepresented and stereotyped through music. Much has changed since Rameau’s and Puccini’s orientalist ballets and operas, when exoticizing foreign cultures in Western art music was fashionable. Recently Western opera houses have started to consider more carefully how to stage opera characters that engage with racist stereotypes.\n\nThese notions are more easily detected in stage music or theatre, but how to apply cultural sensitivity to instrumental music? What is the performer’s responsibility when representing cultures that are foreign to the performer and/or the composer? How much background knowledge should the performer obtain to assess the cultural validation of the music?\n\nMy artistic research is addressing these questions from the performer’s point of view. In this paper I discuss my case study piece, Juha T. Koskinen’s “Dream Transmission” (2019) for solo clarinet and electronics through a concise analysis of the music and performance notes of its 5 movements. The composition mixes Japanese culture, Buddhist ritualistic gestures and classical Italian literature into a piece of music that from the performer’s perspective has some problematic information. Is it necessary for the performer to be “culturally correct” when the composer’s idea is to create a fantasy world through music? Is orientalism still an issue in contemporary music? We cannot count on not having to care about cultural faux pas in the age of digitalization.\n\nReetta Näätänen has been working as a clarinetist in Tampere Philharmonic Orchestra for over 20 years.

The mutual synchronizing of sonic and bodily experiences creates a bond that is pre-communicative and perhaps deeper than shared conscious meaning. This can happen through the interaction of composers and performers, performers and performers, performers and listeners, and listeners and listeners. The more involved a person is in doing music, whether in composing, performing, or listening, the tighter the bond is.” (William Roy, Reds, Whites, and Blues)\n\nThis quote from sociologist William Roy speaks directly to the praxis of choral singing, a social activity that is practiced around the globe. In the Western choral tradition, there has recently been a growing trend to address important social concerns through new compositions and innovative programming. Composers have taken on such topics as racism, LGBTQ and women’s rights, gun violence, as well as other pressing social issues. One of the subgenres of this socially conscious repertoire is music that focuses on environmentalism and the growing anxiety regarding climate change.\n\nThis presentation will address recent activity in the eco-choral genre, including new compositions, grassroots organizations in the U.S., and current sociological, psychological, and musical research related to the topic. Musical examples from recent live performances will be shared, including works by American composers John Luther Adams, Sarah Kirkland Snider, Stacy Garrop, Jake Runestad, and Robert Kyr. A case will be made for choral music’s utility in mobilizing an effective environmentalist movement within the field, as well as strategies for achieving a synergistic course of action. With hundreds of thousands singers participating in choral music around the world, a coordinated campaign to address climate change through singing is not only possible, but necessary.\n\nKirsten Hedegaard has enjoyed a varied career as singer, conductor, and scholar.

Its critics claim both that it does nothing to advance the causes it is tied to (‘preaches to the choir’), and that it is unnuanced, and uninteresting as art (‘on the nose’). While practitioners will disagree with these arguments, they are nonetheless worthwhile provocations to contend with in creating effective, meaningful, work. In this paper I will argue that a path towards this end could be found in shifting the focus from political to activist works. Using a practice-as-research approach the paper will discuss two recent compositions. Custodian an Oratorio for a Choir that Acts (2018) is a civil disobedience piece which was staged on the footsteps of the Jewish National Fund headquarters to resist their attempts at displacing a Palestinian family, the Sumreens, from their home in Silwan, East Jerusalem. In Or Never (2022) performers’ participation is tied up with their political choices: they do or do not play sections of the piece depending on their answers to questions such as “is it moral to eat an avocado?”, “have you had a meaningful conversation about climate this week?”, “have you ever participated in a climate protest?” and “do you know how to dismantle a pipeline?”. The paper will explore the artistic possibilities afforded by focusing on activism, and take stock of the impacts these pieces have had on audiences, performers, and the struggles they are tied to.\n\nUri Agnon is a Jerusalemite composer, activist, and researcher currently based in London. A PhD candidate at the University of Southampton, he explores possible relationships between activist strategies and compositional practices.

This article discusses Leftraru’s perceptions about his own music and how it relates with his political activism. By analysing some Leftraru’s interviews and documents that engaged in aesthetic and ideological perceptions about his music, we organized two categories wherein his ideas can be grouped: one that focuses on language revitalization, and another that incorporates aspects related to traditional Mapuche music into his creative practices. The conclusions indicate that these categories are key in understanding the notions of territory articulated by this musician, which allows the emergence of reinterpretations about some traditional notions, in this case Mapuche singing.\n\nJavier Silva-Zurita is an academic at the Department of Humanities and Arts, in the Universidad de Los Lagos, Chile.

First, as the director of Fascinating Fascism and its Affective Heritage in the Finnish Culture (a research project funded by the Kone Foundation, 2021–2023), that combines research and artistic activity, I wish to briefly introduce this seven-member project, and its main ideas. Notably, we have several researchers working on music and sound, and we are also working on a series of performances He sanoivat: “Rajat kiinni ja uunit auki” (They said: “Close the borders and open the ovens”. Second, I will highlight examples of my own research on the ariosofic use of The Kalevala, the Finnish national epic, by Finnish Neo-Nazis, and on Finnish neofolk music with fascist undertones.\n\nNeofolk, also sometimes known as apocalyptic folk, is a form of experimental music, with roots in folk and industrial genres. It can be either solely acoustic music or combine acoustic and electric sounds. A great lyrical emphasis has been placed on old, mostly European mythologies, esoteric rituals, and references nocturnal/gothic culture and nature. Many bands across the genre have either been outright fascist with their themes or at least ambivalent in relation to fascist aesthetics. It could be argued that this kind of beautiful, dramatic music could be used as a form of propaganda. The nostalgic longing for mythical past is obviously something that resonates with populist themes. There are, however, also antifascist neofolk artists, and I will talk about my own artistic work in this context – my singer-songwriter albums The Bone of My Bones (Svart Records 2013), and Eye for an Eye (Svart Records 2017) have been labelled as neofolk by many journalists.\n\nDr Kimi Kärki is a Lecturer at Cultural Study of Music, Sibelius Academy, Uniarts Helsinki (Seinäjoki unit), and holds a title of Docent in Cultural Heritage Studies (University of Turku) and Area and Cultural Studies (University of Helsinki).

Ironically, Villa sat at the intersection of almost every minority group on the island. Indeed, he was Black, gay, and a practitioner of santería— “a Yorùbá-diasporic religion... incorporating certain Catholic elements” (Conner 2004). While most of the English-language scholarship on Villa has overemphasized his sympathy for the Cuban Revolution (Jacobs 1988; Jacobs 1991), almost nothing has been said as to how this artist became a symbol of Cuban-ness both before and during the Castro administration, which was known for its persecution of homosexuals and santeros. In this essay, I explore this issue and engage with his music as an avenue for the politicized expression of his identity. I argue that, although the revolutionary government may have seen Villa’s race and cultural background as the perfect attributes for a Cuban “[musical] ambassador” (Barnet 2021), it was Villa’s status as an internationally renowned artist and his involvement with the cultural movement known as Afrocubanismo that shielded him from the anti-homosexual and anti-santero persecution of the 1960s (Ocasio 2002; Moore 1997). I contend that, while Villa developed a revolutionary public persona, he also engaged in a form of non-overt resistance by positioning himself within the shifting Cuban cultural field and by using his music and the open secret of his homosexuality as main vehicles. I close the essay with discussion of two songs recorded by Villa: his arrangement of Moisés Simons’ “Chivo Que Rompe Tambó” and his own “Pero Tú Nunca Comprenderás.” I tease out musical cues in these pieces and contextualize them in terms of Villa’s identity, particularly as they serve to reappropriate Afrocubanista compositions and convey potential political meanings through embodied cognition (Cox 2016).\n\nCarlos Pérez Tabares is a Ph.D. candidate in music theory at the University of Michigan.

In his three videos “Yonkers” (2011), “Buffalo” (2015) and “Find Your Wings” (2015), Tyler seems to propose a trilogy of his evolution and maturation as a black artist who does not fit in long-term stereotypes related to black masculinity in American rap music. In all of them, feelings of inadequacy and awkwardness are evidenced through a significantly racial play between whiteness and blackness in order to expose Tyler’s outsider condition in the hip-hop context. Understanding such intriguing artist and his emblematic music videos is crucial in a political moment in which the racial debate is prominent and necessary. In this paper, I will briefly analyze Tyler’s audio-visual trilogy in order to discuss important contemporary matters such as race, gender and popular culture.\n\nGustavo Souza Marques is a music scholar and producer also known under the stage names Gusmão and Gusashi.

On the surface level, Hatari present themselves as a gothic-industrial techno-pop trio. Their sonic world combines danceable electronic beats with the brute authoritarian masculinity of Nordic black metal and the ethereal falsettos of Icelandic post-rock artists such as Björk and Sigur Rós. Visually, the band draws on both totalitarian imagery and BDSM culture.\n\nHowever, at the crux of Hatari lies a thoroughly mediatised and deeply political art performance. Using humour, satire, and absurdist détournement in each of their highly curated audio-visual performances, the group radically confronts the many tacit power imbalances of modern-day society. For instance, although the trio insistently introduce themselves as an ‘award-winning anti-capitalist band’ (already a contradictio in terminis), the group competed in the 2019 Eurovision Song Contest in Tel Aviv, which, with 200 million viewers, is inarguably the epitome of televised capitalism in the music entertainment industry. While proceeding through to the finals, Hatari deliberately used the alleged political neutrality of Eurovision as a platform for staging several radically pro-Palestine provocations, thus emphasising Iceland’s geopolitical position on the ongoing Israeli–Palestinian conflict. In several of the audio-visual performances surrounding the contest, Hatari explicitly tackle issues of gender and sexual normativity, populism, and late-stage capitalism.\n\nThis paper assesses the many ways in which Hatari’s mediatised and carefully curated audio-visual performances radically disrupt and undermine the alleged political neutrality of the Eurovision Song Contest. The paper shows how the group use humour and satire to turn the rules, values, and traditions of the contest against itself, and by doing so, signal a clear message about Iceland’s geopolitical perspectives on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\n\nDr Christine Dysers is a postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Musicology at Uppsala University.

The visual album Lemonade depicts the journey of twenty-first-century Black women navigating the triple jeopardy of race, class and gender in the United States of America. Beyoncé draws on a myriad of elements, including Black feminism, the #BlackLivesMatter movement and various music genres, to address intersectional issues, such as misogynoir, marital infidelity and structural classism. Lemonade is set within the context of the Black Southern traditions of the USA; however, it addresses intersectional issues that are experienced by people, particularly Black women, across the world. This presentation explores perceptions in South Africa of how intersectionality is portrayed and interpreted in the visual album. The data was collected through a combination of diary entries and semi-structured interviews from a diverse group of 20 participants (ages 20 to 54). After a thematic analysis of the data, it became apparent that many of the participants relate to the intersectional issues portrayed through Lemonade. Intersectionality was perceived through lyrics that narrate the experiences of Black women, mise-en-scène that portrays various historical and contemporary elements inspired by Black culture, poetry that reflects the emotions of Black women, and musical accompaniment that evokes Black musical styles. Not all of the participants appreciated Beyoncé’s methods, as some were perceived as commercial and unrelatable. However, the most predominant perception was that Beyoncé plays a pivotal role in the portrayal of intersectionality in the popular music genre and, subsequently, popular culture. The study’s findings reveal that Beyoncé’s methods of advocating for intersectional justice are understood in a South African context and can be applied in settings beyond the borders of the USA, further illustrating the role that popular music has in shaping narratives across the world.\n\nJames Paradza is a Doctor of Music (Musicology) candidate at the University of Pretoria (UP). He completed his Bachelor of Music and Master of Music in Performing Art degrees (both with distinction) at UP.
