        "text": "Effects of atrial fibrillation on myocardial washout rate of thallium-201 on myocardial perfusion single-photon emission computed tomography.\n\nPubMed\n\nKurisu, Satoshi; Nitta, Kazuhiro; Sumimoto, Yoji; Ikenaga, Hiroki; Ishibashi, Ken; Fukuda, Yukihiro; Kihara, Yasuki\n\n2018-04-20\n\nMyocardial perfusion single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) with thallium (Tl)-201 is an established modality for evaluating myocardial ischemia. We assessed the effects of atrial fibrillation (AF) on the myocardial washout rate (WR) of Tl-201 on myocardial perfusion SPECT. A total of 231 patients with no evidence of myocardial ischemia were enrolled retrospectively in this study. Patients were divided into two groups on the basis of the ECG at the time of myocardial perfusion SPECT. The mean myocardial WR of Tl-201 was calculated from the stress and the redistribution Bull's eye maps. There were 34 patients with AF and 197 patients with sinus rhythm. There were no significant differences in clinical variables, except for older age and higher heart rate in patients with AF. Myocardial WR of Tl-201 was significantly lower in patients with AF than those with sinus rhythm (46Â±12 vs. 51Â±8%, P=0.03). Multivariate analysis including these factors showed that female sex (Î²=0.18, P=0.02), AF (Î²=-0.14 P=0.03), hemoglobin (Î²=-0.18, P<0.01), and serum creatinine (Î²=0.24, P<0.01) were determinants of myocardial WR of Tl-201. Our data suggest that AF is associated with reduced myocardial WR of Tl-201 on myocardial perfuison SPECT.\n\nThe washout rate of (123)I-BMIPP and the evolution of left ventricular function in patients with successfully reperfused ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction: comparisons with the echocardiography.\n\nPubMed\n\nBiswas, Shankar K; Sarai, Masayoshi; Yamada, Akira; Toyama, Hiroshi; Motoyama, Sadako; Harigaya, Hiroto; Hara, Tomonori; Naruse, Hiroyuki; Hishida, Hitoshi; Ozaki, Yukio\n\n2010-02-01\n\nThe evolution of the oxidative metabolism of (11)C acetate parallels the recovery of left ventricular(LV) contraction following acute myocardial infarction(AMI). This study was designed to unravel, for the first time, the impact of the global washout rate(WR) of (123)I-beta-methyl-p-iodophenylpentadecanoic acid (BMIPP) on the recovery of LV function followingAMI, as evidenced from conventional echocardiography.Twenty consecutive patients (age: 58 +/- 13 years; 16 males and 4 females) with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) were enrolled and all of them underwent successful percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). (123)I-BMIPP cardiac scintigraphy was performed at 7 +/- 3 days after admission. The WR was calculated from the polar map and the regional BMIPP defect score was calculated using a 17 segment model. Echocardiography was performed within 24 h of admission and at 3 months to record the ejection fraction (EF), the wall motion score index (WMSI), the ratio of the mitralinflow velocity to the early diastolic velocity (E/E0)and the myocardial performance index (MPI). The mean global WR of the BMIPP was 22.12 +/- 7.22%, and it was significantly correlated with the improvement of the WMSI (r = 0.61, P\\\\0.004). However,the relative changes of the EF, E/E0 and MPI were not correlated with the WR. The BMIPP defect score (18 +/- 10) was significantly correlated with the WMSI on admission (r = 0.74, P = 0.0002), but the defect score was not correlated with the relative changes of any of the echocardiographic parameters. We proved that the WR of the BMIPP is a promising indicator of improvement of the LV wall motion (WMSI) following ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction and successful reperfusion.\n\nCan the Contrast-Enhanced Ultrasound Washout Rate Be Used to Predict Microvascular Invasion in Hepatocellular Carcinoma?\n\nPubMed\n\nZhu, Wei; Qing, Xiachuan; Yan, Feng; Luo, Yan; Li, Yongzhong; Zhou, Xiang\n\n2017-08-01\n\nThe objective of this study was to investigate use of the washout rate of hepatocellular carcinoma on contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) for pre-operative determination of the presence of microvascular invasion. The study included 271 patients who underwent liver resection for hepatocellular carcinoma between April 2008 and December 2012, and were examined with contrast-enhanced ultrasound before surgery. Patients were followed up at 3-mo intervals for 3Â y. Four washout patterns were classified according to the start time of washout: rapid, portal, delayed and slow. Rapid washout, presence of two or more tumors and tumor size â¥5Â cm were identified as independent pre-operative predictors of microvascular invasion on multivariate analysis. Recurrence rates for patients with none, one, two or three predictors were 22.6%, 34.7%, 57.6% and 75.0%, respectively. In combination with tumor number and tumor size, contrast-enhanced ultrasound washout rate may have a role in identifying hepatocellular carcinoma patients with microvascular invasion.

The strong feedback provided by these objects and their subsequent supernova (SN) explosions are decisive for a variety of astrophysical topics such as the cosmic matter cycle. Consequently, understanding the properties of WR stars and their evolution is indispensable. A crucial but still not well known quantity determining the evolution of WR stars is their mass-loss rate. Since the mass loss is predicted to increase with metallicity, the feedback provided by these objects and their spectral appearance are expected to be a function of the metal content of their host galaxy. This has severe implications for the role of massive stars in general and the exploration of low metallicity environments in particular. Hitherto, the metallicity dependence of WR star winds was not well studied. In this contribution, we review the results from our comprehensive spectral analyses of WR stars in environments of different metallicities, ranging from slightly super-solar to SMC-like metallicities. Based on these studies, we derived empirical relations for the dependence of the WN mass-loss rates on the metallicity and iron abundance, respectively.\n\nProtection of mice against fission-neutron irradiation by WR-2721 or WR-151327\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nSteel, L.K.; Jacobs, A.J.; Giambarresi, L.I.\n\n1987-01-01\n\nTwo phosphorothioate compounds, WR-2721 and WR-151327, were examined for their radioprotective efficacies against the effects of fission-neutron irradiation in male and female mice. Within sex groups no significant difference in lethality at 30 or 100 days postirradiation was found between WR-2721 or WR-151327 pretreatment. The dose-modification factors (DMFs) for male mice treated with either compound were 1.29 (LD50/30) and 1.24 (LD50/100), and those for drug-treated female mice were 1.21 (LD50/30) and 1.19 (LD50/100).

WR-151327 (500 mg/kg, ip) was found to be significantly more toxic to both male and female B6D2F1 mice than equimolar amounts of WR-2721. Small but significant sex differences in radioprotection were found: the DMFs for female mice pretreated with either compound were lower than those for similarly treated male mice; the incidence of mortality 31-100 days postexposure in male mice pretreated with WR-151327 was greater than for female mice. In addition, sex differences were noted in drug toxicity. Toxic death in female mice given WR-151327 (500 mg/kg, ip) is 2.6 times more probable than in males.Â«Â less\n\nProtection of mice against fission neutron irradiation by WR-2721 or WR-151327\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nSteel, L.K.; Jacobs, A.J.; Giambarresi, L.I.\n\n1987-03-01\n\nTwo phosphorothioate compounds, WR-2721 and WR-151327, were examined for their radioprotective efficacies against the effects of fission neutron irradiation in male and female mice.

We fitted this model to experimental data from 15 human subjects, for whom subject-specific parameters were known, multiple washout carboxyhemoglobin (COHb) levels were available, and CO exposure conditions were identical, to investigate the contributions of exposure conditions and individual variability to CO washout from blood. We found that CO washout from venous blood was biphasic and that postexposure times at which COHb samples were obtained significantly influenced the calculated CO half times (P < 0.0001). The first, more rapid, phase of CO washout from the blood reflected the loss of CO to the expired air and to a slow uptake by the muscle compartment, whereas the second, slower washout phase was attributable to CO flow from the muscle compartment back to the blood and removal from blood via the expired air. When the model was used to predict the effects of varying exposure conditions for these subjects, the CO exposure duration, concentration, peak COHb levels, and subject-specific parameters each influenced washout half times. Blood volume divided by ventilation correlated better with half-time predictions than did cardiac output, muscle mass, or ventilation, but it explained only approximately 50% of half-time variability. Thus exposure conditions, COHb sampling times, and individual parameters should be considered when estimating CO washout rates for poisoning victims.\n\nRadioprotective Thiolamines WR-1065 and WR-33278 Selectively Denature Nonhistone Nuclear Proteins\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nBooth, Valerie K.; Roberts, Jeanette C.; Warters, Raymond L.; Wilmore, Britta H.; Lepock, James R.\n\n2000-01-01\n\nDifferential scanning calorimetry was used to study the interactions of nuclei isolated from Chinese hamster V79 cells with the radioprotector WR-1065, other thiol compounds, and polyamines. Differential scanning calorimetry monitors denaturation of macromolecules and resolves the major nuclear components (e.g. constrained and relaxed DNA, nucleosome core, and nuclear matrix) of intact nuclei on the basis of thermal stability. WR-1065 treatment (0.5-10 mM) of isolated nuclei led to the irreversible denaturation of nuclear proteins, a fraction of which are nuclear matrix proteins. Denaturation of 50% of the total nonhistone nuclear protein content of isolated nuclei occurred after exposure to 4.7 mM WR-1065 for 20 min at 23 C. In addition, a 22% increase in the insoluble protein content of nuclei isolated from V79 cells that had been treated with 4 mM WR-1065 for 30 min at 37 C was observed, indicating that WR-1065-induced protein denaturation occurs not only in isolated nuclei but also in the nuclei of intact cells. From the extent of the increase in insoluble protein in the nucleus, protein denaturation by WR-1065 is expected to contribute to drug toxicity at concentrations greater than approximately 4 mM. WR-33278, the disulfide form of WR1065, was approximately twice as effective as the free thiol at denaturing nuclear proteins. The proposed mechanism for nucleoprotein denaturation is through direct interactions with protein cysteine groups with the formation of destabilizing protein-WR-1065 disulfides. In comparison to its effect on nuclear proteins in isolated nuclei, WR-1065 had only a very small effect on non-nuclear proteins of whole cells, isolated nuclear matrix, or the thiol-rich Ca (2+) ATPase of sarcoplasmic reticulum, indicating that WR-1065 can effectively denature protein only inside an intact nucleus, probably due to the increased concentration of the positively charged drug in the vicinity of DNA.\n\n99Â mTc-MIBI washout as a complementary factor in the evaluation of idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (IDCM) using myocardial perfusion imaging.\n\nPubMed\n\nShiroodi, Mohammad Kazem; Shafiei, Babak; Baharfard, Nastaran; Gheidari, Mohammad Esmail; Nazari, Babak; Pirayesh, Elaheh; Kiasat, Ali; Hoseinzadeh, Samaneh; Hashemi, Abolghassem; Akbarzadeh, Mohammad Ali; Javadi, Hamid; Nabipour, Iraj; Assadi, Majid\n\n2012-01-01\n\nRapid technetium-99 m methoxyisobutylisonitrile (99 mTc-MIBI) washout has been shown to occur in impaired myocardia. This study is based on the hypothesis that scintigraphy can be applied to calculate the myocardial 99 mTc-MIBI washout rate (WR) to diagnose and evaluate heart failure severity and other left ventricular functional parameters specifically in idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (IDCM) patients. Patients with IDCMP (n = 17; 52.65 Â± 11.47 years) and normal subjects (n = 6; 49.67 Â± 10.15 years) were intravenously administered 99 mTc-hexakis-2-methoxyisobutylisonitrile (99 mTc-MIBI). Next, early and delayed planar data were acquired (at 3.5-h intervals), and electrocardiogram (ECG)-gated myocardial perfusion single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) was performed. The 99 mTc-MIBI WR was calculated using early and delayed planar images. Left ventricular functional parameters were also analyzed using quantitative gated SPECT (QGS) data. In target group, myocardial WRs (29.13 Â± 6.68%) were significantly higher than those of control subjects (14.17 Â± 3.31%; P < 0.001). The 99 mTc-MIBI WR increased with the increasing severity of the NYHA functional class (23.16 Â± 1.72% for class I, 30.25 Â± 0.95% for class II, 32.60 Â± 6.73% for class III, and 37.50 Â± 7.77% for class IV; P = 0.02). The WR was positively correlated with the end-diastolic volume (EDV) index (r (2) = 0.216; Î² = 0.464; P = 0.02 [ml/m(2)], the end-systolic volume (ESV) index (r (2) = 0.234; Î² = 0.484; P = 0.01 [ml/m(2)]), the summed motion score (SMS) (r (2) = 0.544; Î² = 0.738; P = 0.00), and the summed thickening score (STS) (r (2) = 0.656; Î² = 0.810; P = 0.00); it was negatively correlated with the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) (r (2) = 0.679; Î² = -0.824; P = 0.00). It can be concluded that 99 mTc-MIBI scintigraphy might be a valuable molecular imaging tool for the diagnosis and evaluation of myocardial damage or dysfunction severity.\n\nThe CHARA Array resolves the long-period Wolf-Rayet binaries WR 137 and WR 138\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nRichardson, Noel D.; Shenar, Tomer; Roy-Loubier, Olivier; Schaefer, Gail; Moffat, Anthony F. J.; St-Louis, Nicole; Gies, Douglas R.; Farrington, Chris; Hill, Grant M.; Williams, Peredur M.; Gordon, Kathryn; Pablo, Herbert; Ramiaramanantsoa, Tahina\n\n2016-10-01\n\nWe report on interferometric observations with the CHARA Array of two classical Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars in suspected binary systems, namely WR 137 and WR 138. In both cases, we resolve the component stars to be separated by a few milliarcseconds. The data were collected in the H band, and provide a measure of the fractional flux for both stars in each system. We find that the WR star is the dominant H-band light source in both systems (fWR,137 = 0.59 Â± 0.04; fWR,138 = 0.67 Â± 0.01), which is confirmed through both comparisons with estimated fundamental parameters for WR stars and O dwarfs, as well as through spectral modelling of each system. Our spectral modelling also provides fundamental parameters for the stars and winds in these systems. The results on WR 138 provide evidence that it is a binary system which may have gone through a previous mass-transfer episode to create the WR star. The separation and position of the stars in the WR 137 system together with previous results from the IOTA interferometer provides evidence that the binary is seen nearly edge-on. The possible edge-on orbit of WR 137 aligns well with the dust production site imaged by the Hubble Space Telescope during a previous periastron passage, showing that the dust production may be concentrated in the orbital plane.\n\nInvestigation of nonlinear motion simulator washout schemes\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nRiedel, S. A.; Hofmann, L. G.\n\n1978-01-01\n\nAn overview is presented of some of the promising washout schemes which have been devised. The four schemes presented fall into two basic configurations; crossfeed and crossproduct. Various nonlinear modifications further differentiate the four schemes. One nonlinear scheme is discussed in detail. This washout scheme takes advantage of subliminal motions to speed up simulator cab centering. It exploits so-called perceptual indifference thresholds to center the simulator cab at a faster rate whenever the input to the simulator is below the perceptual indifference level. The effect is to reduce the angular and translational simulation motion by comparison with that for the linear washout case. Finally, the conclusions and implications for further research in the area of nonlinear washout filters are presented.\n\nWashout and non-washout solutions of a system describing microbial fermentation process under the influence of growth inhibitions and maximal concentration of yeast cells.\n\nPubMed\n\nKasbawati; Gunawan, Agus Yodi; Sidarto, Kuntjoro Adjie\n\n2017-07-01\n\nAn unstructured model for the growth of yeast cell on glucose due to growth inhibitions by substrate, products, and cell density is discussed. The proposed model describes the dynamical behavior of fermentation system that shows multiple steady states for a certain regime of operating parameters such as inlet glucose and dilution rate. Two types of steady state solutions are found, namely washout and non-washout solutions. Furthermore, different numerical impositions to the two parameters put in evidence three results regarding non-washout solution: a unique locally stable non-washout solution, a unique locally stable non-washout solution towards which other nearby solutions exhibit damped oscillations, and multiple non-washout solutions where one is locally stable while the other is unstable. It is also found an optimal inlet glucose which produces the highest cell and ethanol concentration. Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier Inc.

V.; Stringfellow, G. S.; Kniazev, A. Y.; Todt, H.; Hamann, W.-R.\n\n2013-03-01\n\nTwo optically obscured Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars have been recently discovered by means of their infrared (IR) circumstellar shells, which show signatures of interaction with each other. Following the systematics of the WR star catalogues, these stars obtain the names WR 120bb and WR 120bc. In this paper, we present and analyse new near-IR, J-, H- and K-band spectra using the Potsdam Wolf-Rayet model atmosphere code. For that purpose, the atomic data base of the code has been extended in order to include all significant lines in the near-IR bands. The spectra of both stars are classified as WN9h. As their spectra are very similar the parameters that we obtained by the spectral analyses hardly differ. Despite their late spectral subtype, we found relatively high stellar temperatures of 63 kK. The wind composition is dominated by helium, while hydrogen is depleted to 25 per cent by mass. Because of their location in the Scutum-Centaurus Arm, WR 120bb and WR 120bc appear highly reddened, A_{K_s} â 2 mag. We adopt a common distance of 5.8 kpc to both stars, which complies with the typical absolute K-band magnitude for the WN9h subtype of -6.5 mag, is consistent with their observed extinction based on comparison with other massive stars in the region, and allows for the possibility that their shells are interacting with each other. This leads to luminosities of log ({textit {L}/L}_{odot }) = 5.66 and 5.54 for WR 120bb and WR 120bc, with large uncertainties due to the adopted distance. The values of the luminosities of WR 120bb and WR 120bc imply that the immediate precursors of both stars were red supergiants (RSG). This implies in turn that the circumstellar shells associated with WR 120bb and WR 120bc were formed by interaction between the WR wind and the dense material shed during the preceding RSG phase.\n\nProperties of selected S-nitrosothiols compared to nitrosylated WR-1065.\n\nPubMed\n\nWhiteside, William Michael; Sears, Devin N; Young, Paul R; Rubin, David B\n\n2002-05-01\n\nWR-1065 ([N-mercaptoethyl]-1-3-diaminopropane), the active form of the aminothiol drug Ethyol/Amifostine, protects against toxicity caused by radiation, chemotherapy and endotoxin. Because WR-1065 and other thiols readily bind nitric oxide (NO), injurious conditions or therapies that induce the production or mobilization of NO could alter the effects of WR-1065. S-Nitrosothiols were prepared from various thiols by a standard method to compare properties and stability. Heteromolecular quantum correlation 2D nuclear magnetic resonance was used to characterize nitrosylated glutathione (GSH) and WR-1065; both S- and N-nitrosothiols were observed, depending on the experimental conditions. Three categories of S-nitrosothiol stability were observed: (1) highly stable, with t(1/2) > 8 h, N-acetyl-L-cysteine nitrosothiol (t(1/2) 15 h) > GSH nitrosothiol (t(1/2) 8 h); (2) intermediate stability, t(1/2) approximately 2 h, cysteamine nitrosothiol and WR-1065 nitrosothiol; and (3) low stability, t(1/2) < 1 h, cysteine nitrosothiol and Captopril nitrosothiol. Similar relative rates were observed for Hg(+2)-induced denitrosylation: WR-1065 reacted faster than GSH nitrosothiol, while GSH nitrosothiol reacted faster than N-acetyl-L-cysteine nitrosothiol. Mostly mediated by mixed-NPSH disulfide formation, the activity of the redox-sensitive cysteine protease, cathepsin H, was inhibited by the S-nitrosothiols, with WR-1065 nitrosothiol > cysteine nitrosothiol > N-acetyl-L-cysteine nitrosothiol and GSH nitrosothiol. These observations indicate that, relative to other nitrosylated non-protein thiols, the S-nitrosothiol of WR-1065 is an unstable non-protein S-nitrosothiols with a high reactive potential in the modification of protein thiols.\n\nA comparison of washout filters using a human dynamic orientation model. M.S. Thesis\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nRiedel, S. A.\n\n1977-01-01\n\nThe Ormsby model of human dynamic orientation, a discrete time computer program, was used to provide a vestibular explanation for observed differences between two washout schemes. These washout schemes, a linear washout and a nonlinear washout, were subjectively evaluated. It was found that the linear washout presented false rate cues, causing pilots to rate the simulation fidelity of the linear scheme much lower than the nonlinear scheme. By inputting these motion histories into the Ormsby model, it was shown that the linear filter causes discontinuities in the pilot's perceived angular velocity, resulting in the sensation of an anomalous rate cue. This phenomenon does not occur with the use of the nonlinear filter.\n\nKrogh-cylinder and infinite-domain models for washout of an inert diffusible solute from tissue.\n\nPubMed\n\nSecomb, Timothy W\n\n2015-01-01\n\nModels based on the Krogh-cylinder concept are developed to analyze the washout from tissue by blood flow of an inert diffusible solute that permeates blood vessel walls. During the late phase of washout, the outflowing solute concentration decays exponentially with time. This washout decay rate is predicted for a range of conditions. A single capillary is assumed to lie on the axis of a cylindrical tissue region. In the classic \"Krogh-cylinder\" approach, a no-flux boundary condition is applied on the outside of the cylinder. An alternative \"infinite-domain\" approach is proposed that allows for solute exchange across the boundary, but with zero net exchange. Both models are analyzed, using finite-element and analytical methods. The washout decay rate depends on blood flow rate, tissue diffusivity and vessel permeability of solute, and assumed boundary conditions. At low blood flow rates, the washout rate can exceed the value for a single well-mixed compartment. The infinite-domain approach predicts slower washout decay rates than the Krogh-cylinder approach. The infinite-domain approach overcomes a significant limitation of the Krogh-cylinder approach, while retaining its simplicity. It provides a basis for developing methods to deduce transport properties of inert solutes from observations of washout decay rates.

To further gain insight into this process, we have studied /sup 22/Na/sup +/ washout from cultured Wistar rat skin fibroblasts and vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). In these preparations, /sup 22/Na/sup +/ washout is described by a general three-exponential function. The exponential factor of the fastest component (k1) and the initial exchange rate constant (kie) of cultured fibroblasts decrease in magnitude in response to incubation in K+-deficient medium or in the presence of ouabain and increase in magnitude when the cells are incubatedmoreÂ Â» in a Ca++-deficient medium. As the magnitude of the kie declines (in the presence of ouabain) to the level of the exponential factor of the middle component (k2), /sup 22/Na/sup +/ washout is adequately described by a two-exponential function. When the kie is further diminished (in the presence of both ouabain and phloretin) to the range of the exponential factor of the slowest component (k3), the washout of /sup 22/Na/sup +/ is apparently monoexponential. Calculations of the cellular Na/sup +/ concentrations, based on the /sup 22/Na/sup +/ activity in the cells at the initiation of the washout experiments, and the medium specific activity agree with atomic absorption spectrometry measurements of the cellular concentration of this ion. Thus, all three components of /sup 22/Na/sup +/ washout from cultured rat cells are of cellular origin. Using the exponential parameters, compartmental analyses of two models (in parallel and in series) with three cellular Na/sup +/ pools were performed. The results indicate that, independent of the model chosen, the relative size of the largest Na+ pool is 92-93% in fibroblasts and approximately 96% in VSMCs. This pool is most likely to represent the cytosol.Â«Â less\n\nX-rays from the colliding wind binary WR 146\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nZhekov, Svetozar A.\n\n2017-12-01\n\nThe X-ray emission from the massive Wolf-Rayet binary (WR 146 ) is analysed in the framework of the colliding stellar wind (CSW) picture. The theoretical CSW model spectra match well the shape of the observed X-ray spectrum of WR 146, but they overestimate considerably the observed X-ray flux (emission measure). This is valid in the case of both complete temperature equalization and partial electron heating at the shock fronts (different electron and ion temperatures), but there are indications for a better correspondence between model predictions and observations for the latter. To reconcile the model predictions and observations, the mass-loss rate of WR 146 must be reduced by a factor of 8-10 compared to the currently accepted value for this object (the latter already takes clumping into account). No excess X-ray absorption is derived from the CSW modelling.\n\nWR 148 and the not so compact companion\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMunoz, Melissa; Moffat, Anthony J.; Hill, Grant M.; Shenar, Tomer; Richardson, Noel D.; Pablo, Herbert; St-Louis, Nicole; Ramiaramanantsoa, Tahina\n\n2017-11-01\n\nThe objective is to determine the nature of the unseen companion of the single-lined spectroscopic binary, WR 148 (= WN7h+?). The absence of companion lines supports a compact companion (cc) scenario. The lack of hard X-rays favours a non-compact companion scenario. Is WR 148 a commonplace WR+OB binary or a rare WR+cc binary?\n\nAssociation of Deep Brain Stimulation Washout Effects With Parkinson Disease Duration\n\nPubMed Central\n\nCooper, Scott E.; McIntyre, Cameron C.; Fernandez, Hubert H.; Vitek, Jerrold L.\n\n2016-01-01\n\nBackground Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) improves symptoms of Parkinson disease (PD), including bradykinesia. When stimulation ceases abruptly, bradykinesia returns gradually. The duration of the gradual, slow washout varies across patients, and although the origin of this variability is unclear, it is hypothesized to be related to 1 or more clinical characteristics of patients. Objective To determine if a correlation exists between clinical characteristics of patients with Parkinson disease (age, age at disease onset, disease severity, disease duration, medication dose, or time since surgery) and the washout rate for bradykinesia when STN DBS is discontinued. Design Serial quantitative assessments of bradykinesia were performed during a defined period following cessation of STN DBS. Setting Academic research. Patients Twenty-four patients with Parkinson disease who underwent STN DBS were enrolled in the study. Patients were assessed while off medication (medication had been discontinued 10Â½ to 16Â½ hours before testing), and stimulator settings were unchanged for a mean (median) of 20 (14) months. Main Outcome Measures We measured bradykinesia in the dominant hand by assessing finger tapping (item 23 on the Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale), which was quantified using an angular velocity transducer strapped on the index finger. Finger tapping was assessed every 2 minutes for 20 seconds at a time. This was performed during a 20-minute period with DBS on (baseline period), during a 50-minute period following discontinuation of STN DBS for the dominant hand, and again during a 20-minute period after turning on the device. Results When STN DBS was turned off, an initial fast but partial loss of benefit was observed, which was followed by a further slow washout of the residual therapeutic effect. The half-life of the slow washout phase varied significantly across patients, and this variation was strongly related to disease\n\nCO2 Washout Testing of NASA Space Suits\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nNorcross, Jason\n\n2012-01-01\n\nDuring the presentation \"CO2 Washout Testing of NASA Spacesuits,\" Jason Norcross discussed the results of recent carbon dioxide CO2 washout testing of NASA spacesuits including the Rear Entry I-suit (REI), Enhanced Mobility Advanced Crew Escape Suit (EM-ACES), and possibly the ACES and Z-1 EVA prototype. When a spacesuit is used during ground testing, adequate CO2 washout must be provided for the suited subject. Symptoms of acute CO2 exposure depend on the partial pressure of CO2 (ppCO2) available to enter the lungs during respiration. The primary factors during ground-based testing that influence the ppCO2 level in the oronasal area include the metabolic rate of the subject and air flow through the suit. These tests were done to characterize inspired oronasal ppCO2 for a range of workloads and flow rates for which ground testing is nominally performed. During this presentation, Norcross provided descriptions of the spacesuits, test hardware, methodology, and results, as well as implications for future ground testing and verification of flight requirements.\n\nWashout policies in long-term indwelling urinary catheterisation in adults.\n\nPubMed\n\nShepherd, Ashley J; Mackay, William G; Hagen, Suzanne\n\n2017-03-06\n\nfour were parallel-group randomised controlled trials (RCTs). Of these, two trials were added for this update (one parallel-group RCT with 40 participants and one cross-over RCT with 67 participants). Analyses of three cross-over trials yielded suboptimal results because they were based on between-group differences rather than individual participants' differences for sequential interventions. Two parallel-group trials had limited clinical value: one combined results for suprapubic and urethral catheters and the other provided data for only four participants. Only one trial was free of significant methodological limitations, but there were difficulties with recruitment and maintaining participants in this study.The included studies reported data on six of the nine primary and secondary outcome measures. None of the trials addressed: number of catheters used, washout acceptability measures (including patient satisfaction, patient discomfort, pain and ease of use), or health status/measures of psychological health; very limited data were collected for health economic outcomes. Trials assessed only three of the eight intervention comparisons identified. Two trials reported in more than one comparison group.Four trials compared washout (either saline or acidic solution) with no washout. We are uncertain if washout solutions (saline or acidic), compared to no washout solutions, has an important effect on the rate of symptomatic urinary tract infection or length of time each catheter was in situ because the results are imprecise.Four trials compared different types of washout solution; saline versus acidic solutions (2 trials); saline versus acidic solution versus antibiotic solution (1 trial); saline versus antimicrobial solution (1 trial). We are uncertain if type of washout solution has an important effect on the rate of symptomatic urinary tract infection or length of time each catheter was in situ because the results are imprecise.One trial compared different\n\nLocation of WR stars in NGC 6744\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBibby, Joanne; Crowther, Paul; Sandford, Emily\n\n2013-06-01\n\nFollowing our recent survey of Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars in NGC 6744 we present a preliminary investigation into the location of these stars. Using high spatial resolution HÎ± images we find that the majority of WR stars are associated with nebular emission, albeit faint in many cases. We can use this HII association to constrain the lifetime and mass of the WR star since HII regions are such short-lived.\n\nDo catheter washouts extend patency time in long-term indwelling urethral catheters? A randomized controlled trial of acidic washout solution, normal saline washout, or standard care.\n\nPubMed\n\nMoore, Katherine N; Hunter, Kathleen F; McGinnis, Rosemary; Bacsu, Chasta; Fader, Mandy; Gray, Mikel; Getliffe, Kathy; Chobanuk, Janice; Puttagunta, Lakshmi; Voaklander, Donald C\n\n2009-01-01\n\nBlockage of long-term indwelling catheters with mineral deposit is an ongoing management issue, but evidence on optimal management is lacking. Our purpose was to examine whether catheter washouts prevent or reduce catheter blockage. A multisite randomized controlled trial. Adults with long-term indwelling catheters that required changing every 3 weeks or less, living in the community, and requiring supportive or continuing care were recruited. Participants were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 groups: control (usual care, no washout), saline washout, or commercially available acidic washout solution (Contisol Maelor Pharmaceuticals Ltd, Wrexham, UK). At baseline visit, the catheter was changed and participants were followed weekly for 8 weeks, with checks for catheter patency and urine pH. Participants randomized to saline or commercial solution had a weekly washout with the appropriate solution. Endpoints were 8 weeks (completion data), 3 or more catheter changes in the 8-week period, or symptomatic urinary tract infection (UTI) requiring antibiotics. The study hypothesis was that catheter life would be extended by 25% in the commercial solution group. It was not possible to blind participants or research nurses to washout versus no intervention, but participants in the saline and washout solution groups were blinded to solution type. One hundred twelve potential participants were screened; 73 were enrolled, randomized, and included in the final analysis. Of these, 53 completed the full 8 weeks of data collection; 16 terminated early because of 3 catheter changes or self-reported 'UTI'. Other reasons for termination were hematuria, latex sensitivity, deceased/severe illness, or personal choice. Analysis of variance was used to analyze mean differences on demographic variables and mean number of weeks in study. Kaplan-Meier survival curve analysis showed no statistical difference between the groups in time to first catheter change. At this time, the evidence is\n\nCreating an enabling environment for WR&R implementation.\n\nPubMed\n\nStathatou, P-M; Kampragou, E; Grigoropoulou, H; Assimacopoulos, D; Karavitis, C; GironÃ¡s, J\n\n2017-09-01\n\nReclaimed water is receiving growing attention worldwide as an effective solution for alleviating the growing water scarcity in many areas. Despite the various benefits associated with reclaimed water, water recycling and reuse (WR&R) practices are not widely applied around the world. This is mostly due to complex and inadequate local legal and institutional frameworks and socio-economic structures, which pose barriers to wider WR&R implementation. An integrated approach is therefore needed while planning the implementation of WR&R schemes, considering all the potential barriers, and aiming to develop favourable conditions for enhancing reclaimed water use. This paper proposes a comprehensive methodology supporting the development of an enabling environment for WR&R implementation. The political, economic, social, technical, legal and institutional factors that may influence positively (drivers) or negatively (barriers) WR&R implementation in the regional water systems are identified, through the mapping of local stakeholder perceptions. The identified barriers are further analysed, following a Cross-Impact/System analysis, to recognize the most significant barriers inhibiting system transition, and to prioritize the enabling instruments and arrangements that are needed to boost WR&R implementation. The proposed methodology was applied in the CopiapÃ³ River Basin in Chile, which faces severe water scarcity. Through the analysis, it was observed that barriers outweigh drivers for the implementation of WR&R schemes in the CopiapÃ³ River Basin, while the key barriers which could be useful for policy formulation towards an enabling environment in the area concern the unclear legal framework regarding the ownership of treated wastewater, the lack of environmental policies focusing on pollution control, the limited integration of reclaimed water use in current land use and development policies, the limited public awareness on WR&R, and the limited availability of\n\nWashout policies in long-term indwelling urinary catheterisation in adults.\n\nPubMed\n\nHagen, Suzanne; Sinclair, Lesley; Cross, Stephen\n\n2010-03-17\n\nanalyses reported for the two cross-over trials were inappropriate as they were based on differences between groups rather than differences within individuals receiving sequential interventions. Two parallel-group trials had limited value: one combined results for suprapubic and urethral catheters and one had data on only four participants. Only one trial was free of significant methodological limitations, but its sample size was small.Three trials compared no washout with one or more washout solution (saline or acidic solutions) and authors tended to conclude no difference in clinical outcomes between washout and no washout. In the one trial which had data of sufficient quality to allow interpretation, no difference was detected between washout and no washout groups in the rate of symptomatic urinary tract infection or time to first catheter change. Three trials compared different types of solution: saline versus acidic solutions (two trials); saline versus acidic solution versus antibiotic solution (one trial). Authors tended to report no difference between different washout solutions but the data were too few to support their conclusions. The one trial which warranted consideration concluded no difference between saline and an acidic solution in terms of symptomatic urinary tract infections or time to first catheter change. The data from five trials comparing differing washout policies were sparse and trials were generally of poor quality or poorly reported. The evidence was too scanty to conclude whether or not washouts were beneficial. In the first instance we require further rigorous, high quality trials with adequate power to detect any benefit from washout being performed as opposed to none. Then trials comparing different washout solutions, washout volumes, frequencies/timings and routes of administration are needed.\n\nSpace Suit CO2 Washout During Intravehicular Activity\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nAugustine, Phillip M.; Navarro, Moses; Conger, Bruce; Sargusingh, Miriam M.\n\n2010-01-01\n\nSpace suit carbon dioxide (CO2) washout refers to the removal of CO2 gas from the oral-nasal area of a suited astronaut's (or crewmember's) helmet using the suit's ventilation system. Inadequate washout of gases can result in diminished mental/cognitive abilities as well as headaches and light headedness. In addition to general discomfort, these ailments can impair an astronaut s ability to perform mission-critical tasks ranging from flying the space vehicle to performing lunar extravehicular activities (EVAs). During design development for NASA s Constellation Program (CxP), conflicting requirements arose between the volume of air flow that the new Orion manned space vehicle is allocated to provide to the suited crewmember and the amount of air required to achieve CO2 washout in a space suit. Historically, space suits receive 6.0 actual cubic feet per minute (acfm) of air flow, which has adequately washed out CO2 for EVAs. For CxP, the Orion vehicle will provide 4.5 acfm of air flow to the suit. A group of subject matter experts (SM Es) among the EVA Systems community came to an early consensus that 4.5 acfm may be acceptable for low metabolic rate activities. However, this value appears very risky for high metabolic rates, hence the need for further analysis and testing. An analysis was performed to validate the 4.5 acfm value and to determine if adequate CO2 washout can be achieved with the new suit helmet design concepts. The analysis included computational fluid dynamic (CFD) modeling cases, which modeled the air flow and breathing characteristics of a human wearing suit helmets. Helmet testing was performed at the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, to provide a gross-level validation of the CFD models. Although there was not a direct data correlation between the helmet testing and the CFD modeling, the testing data showed trends that are very similar to the CFD modeling. Overall, the analysis yielded\n\nRandomized, Double-Blinded, Phase 2 Trial of WR 279,396 (Paromomycin and Gentamicin) for Cutaneous Leishmaniasis in Panama\n\nPubMed Central\n\nSosa, NÃ©stor; CapitÃ¡n, Zeuz; Nieto, Javier; Nieto, Melissa; Calzada, JosÃ©; Paz, Hector; Spadafora, Carmenza; Kreishman-Deitrick, Mara; Kopydlowski, Karen; Ullman, Diane; McCarthy, William F.; Ransom, Janet; Berman, Jonathan; Scott, Charles; Grogl, Max\n\n2013-01-01\n\nIn this randomized, double-blinded Phase 2 trial, 30 patients with Leishmania panamensis cutaneous leishmaniasis were randomly allocated (1:1) to receive once daily topical treatment with WR 279,396 (15% paromomycin + 0.5% gentamicin) or Paromomycin Alone (15% paromomycin) for 20 days. The index lesion cure rate after 6 months follow-up was 13 of 15 (87%) for WR 279,396 and 9 of 15 (60%) for Paromomycin Alone (P = 0.099). When all treated lesions were included, the final cure rate for WR 279,398-treated patients was again 87%, but the final cure rate for Paromomycin Alone-treated patients was 8 of 15 (53.3%; P = 0.046). Both creams were well tolerated with mild application site reactions being the most frequent adverse event. The increased final cure rate in the WR 279,396 group in this small Phase 2 study suggests that the combination product may provide greater clinical benefit than paromomycin monotherapy against L. panamensis cutaneous leishmaniasis.

The X-ray light curves folded over a period of '208 d in the 0.3 - 10.0 keV energy band showed phase-locked variability where the count rates were found to be maximum near the periastron passage. The X-ray spectra of WR 25 were well explained by a two-temperature plasma model with temperatures of 0.64 Â± 0.01 and 2.96 Â± 0.05 keV and are consistent with previous results. The orbital phase dependent local hydrogen column density was found to be maximum just after the periastron passage, when the WN type star is in front of the O star. The hard (2.0 - 10.0 keV) X-ray luminosity was linearly dependent on the inverse of binary separation which confirms that WR 25 is a colliding wind binary.\n\nFamily ties of WR to LBV nebulae yielding clues for stellar evolution\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nWeis, K.\n\nLuminous Blue Variables (LBVs) are stars is a transitional phase massive stars may enter while evolving from main-sequence to Wolf-Rayet stars. The to LBVs intrinsic photometric variability is based on the modulation of the stellar spectrum. Within a few years the spectrum shifts from OB to AF type and back. During their cool phase LBVs are close to the Humphreys-Davidson (equivalent to Eddington/Omega-Gamma) limit. LBVs have a rather high mass loss rate, with stellar winds that are fast in the hot and slower in the cool phase of an LBV. These alternating wind velocities lead to the formation of LBV nebulae by wind-wind interactions. A nebula can also be formed in a spontaneous giant eruption in which larger amounts of mass are ejected. LBV nebulae are generally small (< 5 pc) mainly gaseous circumstellar nebulae, with a rather large fraction of LBV nebulae being bipolar. After the LBV phase the star will turn into a Wolf-Rayet star, but note that not all WR stars need to have passed the LBV phase. Some follow from the RSG and the most massive directly from the MS phase. In general WRs have a large mass loss and really fast stellar winds. The WR wind may interact with winds of earlier phases (MS, RSG) to form WR nebulae. As for WR with LBV progenitors the scenario might be different, here no older wind is present but an LBV nebula! The nature of WR nebulae are therefore manifold and in particular the connection (or family ties) of WR to LBV nebulae is important to understand the transition between these two phases, the evolution of massive stars, their winds, wind-wind and wind-nebula interactions. Looking at the similarities and differences of LBV and WR nebula, figuring what is a genuine LBV and WR nebula are the basic question addressed in the analysis presented here.\n\nThe Orbit and Distance of WR140\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nDougherty, S. M.; Trenton, V.; Beasley, A. J.\n\n2011-01-01\n\nA campaign of 35 epochs of milli-arcsecond resolution VLBA observations of the archetype colliding-wind WR+O star binary system WR 140 show the wind-collision region (WCR) as a bow-shaped arc of emission that rotates as the highly eccentric orbit progresses. The observations comprise 21 epochs from the 1993-2001 orbit, discussed by Dougherty et al. (2005), and 14 epochs from the 2001-2009 orbit, and span orbital phase 0.43 to 0.95. Assuming the WCR is symmetric about the line-of-centres of the two stars and ``points'' at the WR star, this rotation shows the O star moving from SE to E of the WR star between these orbital phases. Using IR interferometry observations from IOTA that resolve both stellar components at phase 0.297 in conjunction with orbital parameters derived from radial velocity variations, the VLBA observations constrain the inclination of the orbit plane as 120Â°Â±4Â°, the longitude of the ascending node as 352Â°Â±2Â°, and the orbit semi-major axis as 9.0Â±0.1 mas. This leads to a distance estimate to WR 140 of 1.81Â±0.08 kpc. Further refinements of the orbit and distance await more IR interferometric observations of the stellar components directly.\n\nThe massive star O+WR binary Î³ Velorum\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nDe Marco, O.; Willis, A. J.; Colley, S. R.\n\n2001-12-01\n\nThe Î³ Vel O+WR binary system is known to have colliding winds from its X-ray properties. Here we use the stellar parameters of the two stars in the system, derived from the non-LTE models of De Marco & Schmutz (2000) and De Marco et al. (2000), to aid in the interpretation of the optical line variability in terms of the geometry and distribution of the gas around the two stars. We find that the rich dataset (high signal-to-noise ratio, high resolution optical spectra finely sampling the orbital period) allows a very accurate determination of the opening angle of the wake formed as the WR wind impacts the O star. This can lead to understanding whether radiative breaking (of the WR wind gas by the O star radiation field) is efficient in this system. From the location of the emission line forming regions within the WR wind (from the non-LTE models), and the variability patterns of those lines, it is possible to construct a detailed map of the WR wind.

Aperture-masking interferometry has been utilized to recover images at the diffraction limit of the Keck I telescope, less, similar50 mas at 2.2 Âµm. Multiepoch observations spanning about 1 yr have resolved the dust shell into a \"pinwheel\" nebula, the second example of a new class of dust shell first discovered around WR 104 by Tuthill, Monnier, & Danchi. Interpreting the collimated dust outflow in terms of an interacting winds model, the binary orbital parameters and apparent wind speed are derived: a period of 565+/-50 days, a viewing angle of 35&j0;+/-6 degrees from the pole, and a wind speed of 99+/-23 mas yr-1. This period is consistent with a possible approximately 588 day periodicity in the infrared light curve, linking the photometric variation to the binary orbit. Important implications for binary stellar evolution are discussed by identifying WR 104 and WR 98a as members of a class of massive, short-period binaries whose orbits were circularized during a previous red supergiant phase. The current component separation in each system is similar to the diameter of a red supergiant, which indicates that the supergiant phase was likely terminated by Roche lobe overflow, leading to the present Wolf-Rayet stage.\n\nSpectroscopy of the archetype colliding-wind binary WR 140 during the 2009 January periastron passage\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nFahed, R.; Moffat, A.

The observational campaign consisted of a constructive collaboration between amateur and professional astronomers. It took place at six locations, including Teide Observatory, Observatoire de Haute Provence, Dominion Astrophysical Observatory and Observatoire du Mont MÃ©gantic. WR 140 is known as the archetype of colliding-wind binaries and it has a relatively long period (?8 yr) and high eccentricity (?0.9). We provide updated values for the orbital parameters, new estimates for the WR and O star masses and new constraints on the mass-loss rates and colliding-wind geometry.\n\nSingle-Dose Absorption and Pharmacokinetics of WR 6026.

J., Jr.; Conkin, J.\n\n1983-01-01\n\nFive subjects were tested to assess the influence of drinking hypotonic water (distilled water) on whole body tissue nitrogen washout. During the test, the subjects breathed aviators' oxygen for three hours. Each subject performed two baseline nitrogen washouts in a two-week period. The third washout, in the third week, was done under a transient hydrated condition. This was accomplished by having the subjects drink 1.5 liters of hypotonic water 30 minutes before the washout. Five-minute plots of tissue nitrogen removal from the three separate washouts were analyzed to ascertain if the hydration technique had any effect. Our results clearly indicate that the hydration technique did not alter the tissue nitrogen washout characteristics to any degree over three hours. An increase in tissue nitrogen washout under a transient hydrated condition using hypotonic fluid was not demonstrated to be the mechanism responsible for the reported benefit of this technique in preventing Type I altitude decompression pain in man.\n\nSuzaku monitoring of the Wolf-Rayet binary WR140\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSugawara, Yasuharu; Maeda, Yoshitomo; Tsuboi, Yohko; Hamaguchi, Kenji\n\n2010-07-01\n\nWe report the preliminary results of the Suzaku observations of the W-R binary WR 140 (WC7+O5I). We executed the observations at four different epochs around periastron passage in Jan. 2009 to understand the W-R stellar wind as well as the wind-wind collision shocks. The total exposure was 210 ksec. We detected hard X-ray excess in the HXD band (>10 keV) for the first time from a W-R binary. Another notable discovery was a soft component which is not absorbed even by the dense wind. The spectra can be fitted by three different components; one is for the stationary cool component with kT ~0.1 keV, one for a dominant high temperature component with kT ~3 keV, and one for the hardest power-low component with Î~2. The column density at periastron is 30 times higher than that at pre-periastron, which can be explained as self-absorption by the W-R wind. The emission measure of the dominant, high temperature component is not inversely proportional to the distance between the two stars.\n\nColliding winds in five WR+O systems of the Southern hemisphere\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nFahed, R.; Moffat, A. F. J.\n\n2012-08-01\n\nWe present the results of an optical spectroscopic follow-up of five WR+O systems of the Southern hemisphere that have not been studied so far for wind-wind collisions: WR 12 (WN8h), WR 21 (WN5o+O7V), WR 30 (WC6+O7.5V), WR 31 (WN4o+O8) and WR 47 (WN6o+O5). Observations were made over an entire contiguous month using the Garrison spectrograph attached to the 0.6-m Helen Sawyer Hogg telescope at Complejo Astronomico El Leoncito. We obtain improved orbital elements for these five systems and provide an estimation of the orbital inclination and shock-cone opening angle for four of them by analysing excess emission profiles with the geometrical model of LÃ¼hrs. We argue that line variability in one of the stars (WR 12) might be dominated by some dynamic instabilities in the shocked plasma, making the model inappropriate in this case. A sixth star, WR 69 (WC9d+OB), was observed in the programme based on its published photometric period of 2.293 Â± 0.005 d. While we found a probable spectroscopic period of 2.15 Â± 0.04 d compatible with that of Marchenko et al. (1998), the period is unlikely related to orbital effects, rather to (relatively fast) rotation of the WC9d component of a much longer binary system.\n\nLarge-scale Periodic Variability of the Wind of the Wolf-Rayet Star WR 1 (HD 4004)\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nChenÃ©, A.-N.; St-Louis, N.\n\n2010-06-01\n\nWe present the results of an intensive photometric and spectroscopic monitoring campaign of the WN4 Wolf-Rayet (WR) star WR 1 = HD 4004. Our broadband V photometry covering a timespan of 91 days shows variability with a period of P = 16.9+0.6 -0.3 days. The same period is also found in our spectral data. The light curve is non-sinusoidal with hints of a gradual change in its shape as a function of time. The photometric variations nevertheless remain coherent over several cycles and we estimate that the coherence timescale of the light curve is of the order of 60 days. The spectroscopy shows large-scale line-profile variability which can be interpreted as excess emission peaks moving from one side of the profile to the other on a timescale of several days. Although we cannot unequivocally exclude the unlikely possibility that WR 1 is a binary, we propose that the nature of the variability we have found strongly suggests that it is due to the presence in the wind of the WR star of large-scale structures, most likely corotating interaction regions (CIRs), which are predicted to arise in inherently unstable radiatively driven winds when they are perturbed at their base. We also suggest that variability observed in WR 6, WR 134, and WR 137 is of the same nature. Finally, assuming that the period of CIRs is related to the rotational period, we estimate the rotation rate of the four stars for which sufficient monitoring has been carried out, i.e., v rot = 6.5, 40, 70, and 275 km s-1 for WR 1, WR 6, WR 134, and WR 137, respectively.

Their wind-wind collisions produce hard X-rays that have been monitored extensively by several X-ray telescopes, including RXTE. To interpret these RXTE X-ray light curves, we apply 3D hydrodynamic simulations of the wind-wind collision using smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH). We find adiabatic simulations that account for the absorption of X-rays from an assumed point source of X-ray emission at the apex of the wind-collision shock cone can closely match the RXTE light curves of both Î· Car and WR140. This point-source model can also explain the early recovery of Î· Car's X-ray light curve from the 2009.0 minimum by a factor of 2-4 reduction in the mass loss rate of Î· Car. Our more recent models account for the extended emission and absorption along the full wind-wind interaction shock front. For WR140, the computed X-ray light curves again match the RXTE observations quite well. But for Î· Car, a hot, post-periastron bubble leads to an emission level that does not match the extended X-ray minimum observed by RXTE. Initial results from incorporating radiative cooling and radiative forces via an anti-gravity approach into the SPH code are also discussed.\n\nWR and LBV stars\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKochiashvili, Nino; Beradze, Sophie; Kochiashvili, Ia; Natsvlishvili, Rezo; Vardosanidze, Manana\n\nEvolutionary scenarios of massive stars were revised in recent decades, after finding \"unusual\", blue progenitor of SN 1987A and after detecting the more massive stars than the accepted 120 M â maximum limit of stellar masses. A very important relation exists between WR and LBV stars. They represent the earlier, pre-SN evolutionary states of massive stars. WR and LBV stars and \"classic\" evolutionary scheme of the relation between the different type massive stars are discussed in this article. There also exist the newest evolutionary scenarios for low metallicity massive stars, which give us a different picture of their post main-sequence evolution. There is a rather good tradition of observations and investigations of massive stars at Abastumani Astrophysical Observatory. The authors discuss the new findings on the fate of P Cygni, the LBV star. These results on the reddening of the star and about its next possible outburst in the near future were obtained on the basis of UBV long-term electrophotometric observations of P Cygni by Eugene Kharadze and Nino Magalashvili. The observations were held in 1951-1983 at Abastumani Observatory using 33-cm and 48-cm reflectors.\n\nWashout policies in long-term indwelling urinary catheterization in adults: a short version cochrane review.\n\nPubMed\n\nSinclair, Lesley; Hagen, Suzanne; Cross, Stephen\n\n2011-09-01\n\nprotocol were addressed in these trials. Some trials addressed more than one comparison (e.g., washout vs. no washout and one type of washout solution vs. another). The analyses reported for the two cross-over trials were inappropriate as they were based on differences between groups rather than differences within individuals receiving sequential interventions. Two parallel-group trials had limited value: one combined results for suprapubic and urethral catheters and one had data on only four participants. Only one trial was free of significant methodological limitations, but its sample size was small. Three trials compared no washout with one or more washout solution (saline or acidic solutions) and authors tended to conclude no difference in clinical outcomes between washout and no washout. In the one trial which had data of sufficient quality to allow interpretation, no difference was detected between washout and no washout groups in the rate of symptomatic urinary tract infection or time to first catheter change. Three trials compared different types of solution: saline versus acidic solutions (two trials); saline versus acidic solution versus antibiotic solution (one trial). Authors tended to report no difference between different washout solutions but the data were too few to support their conclusions. The one trial which warranted consideration concluded no difference between saline and an acidic solution in terms of symptomatic urinary tract infections or time to first catheter change. The data from five trials comparing differing washout policies were sparse and trials were generally of poor quality or poorly reported. The evidence was too scant to conclude whether or not washouts were beneficial. Further rigorous, high quality trials with adequate power to detect any benefit from washout rather than no washout being performed are required in the first instance. After that, trials comparing different washout solutions, washout volumes, frequencies/timings, and\n\nDifferential antimutagenicity of WR-1065 added after irradiation in L5178Y cell lines\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nEvans, H. H.; Horng, M. F.; Ricanati, M.; McCoy, E. C.\n\n1999-01-01\n\nThe purpose of this study was to determine the antimutagenicity of WR-1065 added after irradiation of cells of cell lines differing in their ability to rejoin radiation-induced DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). The postirradiation antimutagenicity of WR-1065 at the thymidine kinase locus was demonstrated for L5178Y (LY)-S1 cells that are deficient in repair of DNA DSBs. Less postirradiation antimutagenicity of WR-1065 was observed in LY-R16 and LY-SR1 cells, which are relatively efficient in DSB repair. Postirradiation treatment with WR-1065 had only a small stimulatory effect on DSB rejoining. A 3-h incubation of irradiated LY cells with WR-1065 caused slight changes in the distribution of cells in the phases of the cell cycle that differed between LY-S1 and LY-SR1 cells. Both LY-S1 and LY-SR1 cells were protected against the cytotoxic and mutagenic effects of radiation when WR-1065 was present 30 min before and during the irradiation. We conclude that the differential postirradiation effects of WR-1065 in the LY-S1 and LY-SR1 cells are not caused by differences in cellular uptake of the radioprotector or in its radical scavenging activity. Possible mechanisms for the postirradiation antimutagenicity of WR-1065 are discussed.\n\nAre the O stars in WR+O binaries exceptionally rapid rotators?\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nReeve, Dominic; Howarth, Ian D.\n\n2018-05-01\n\nWe examine claims of strong gravity-darkening effects in the O-star components of WR+O binaries. We generate synthetic spectra for a wide range of parameters, and show that the line-width results are consistent with extensive measurements of O stars that are either single or are members of `normal' binaries. By contrast, the WR+O results are at the extremes of, or outside, the distributions of both models and other observations. Remeasurement of the WR+O spectra shows that they can be reconciled with other results by judicious choice of pseudo-continuum normalization. With this interpretation, the supersynchronous rotation previously noted for the O-star components in the WR+O binaries with the longest orbital periods appears to be unexceptional. Our investigation is therefore consistent with the aphorism that if the title of a paper ends with a question mark, the answer is probably `no'.\n\nApplication of nonlinear adaptive motion washout to transport ground-handling simulation\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nParrish, R.

Additions to both the aircraft math model and the motion washout system are discussed. The additions to the simulated-aircraft math model provided improved modeling fidelity for braking and reverse-thrust application, and the additions to the motion-base washout system allowed transition from the desired flight parameters to the less restrictive ground parameters of the washout.\n\nX-ray Modeling of Î· Carinae & WR140 from SPH Simulations\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nRussell, Christopher M.

II. GOING FAINTER: 71 MORE NEW W-R STARS\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nShara, Michael M.; Faherty, Jacqueline K.; Zurek, David\n\nWe are continuing a J, K and narrowband imaging survey of 300 deg{sup 2} of the plane of the Galaxy, searching for new Wolf-Rayet (W-R) stars. Our survey spans 150 Degree-Sign in Galactic longitude and reaches 1 Degree-Sign above and below the Galactic plane. The survey has a useful limiting magnitude of K = 15 over most of the observed Galactic plane, and K = 14 (due to severe crowding) within a few degrees of the Galactic center. Thousands of emission-line candidates have been detected. In spectrographic follow-ups of 146 relatively bright W-R star candidates, we have re-examined 11 previouslymoreÂ Â» known WC and WN stars and discovered 71 new W-R stars, 17 of type WN and 54 of type WC. Our latest image analysis pipeline now picks out W-R stars with a 57% success rate. Star subtype assignments have been confirmed with the K-band spectra and distances approximated using the method of spectroscopic parallax. Some of the new W-R stars are among the most distant known in our Galaxy. The distribution of these new W-R stars is beginning to trace the locations of massive stars along the distant spiral arms of the Milky Way.Â«Â less\n\nRadioprotection of mouse skin vasculature and the RIF-1 fibrosarcoma by WR-2721\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nPenhaligon, M.\n\n1984-09-01\n\nThe degree of radioprotection obtained with WR-2721 is critically dependent upon the oxygen tension of the tissue concerned. It was therefore considered of interest to examine the response of vascular tissue, which would be supposedly well oxygenated, to treatment with WR-2721 plus X rays. The response of this tissue is of interest because of its role in late radiation damage. In addition, for therapeutic gain an agent must protect normal tissue without concomitant tumor protection. However, data on tumor radioprotection have been conflicting and therefore the effect of WR-2721 on an experimental tumor was also tested. Vascular damage was assessedmoreÂ Â» using the fact that tumors grow more slowly in irradiated beds (Tumor Bed Effect). WR-2721 injected 30 minutes before 5 to 30 Gy X rays protected skin stroma by a factor of 1.6. However, WR-2721 given 10 to 60 minutes before 20 Gy X rays to the RIF-1 tumor had either no effect or was protective, according to the method of immobilizing the mice during irradiation.Â«Â less\n\nWash-out in N{sub 2}-dominated leptogenesis\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nHahn-Woernle, F., E-mail: fhahnwo@mppmu.mpg.de\n\n2010-08-01\n\nWe study the wash-out of a cosmological baryon asymmetry produced via leptogenesis by subsequent interactions. Therefore we focus on a scenario in which a lepton asymmetry is established in the out-of-equilibrium decays of the next-to-lightest right-handed neutrino. We apply the full classical Boltzmann equations without the assumption of kinetic equilibrium and including all quantum statistical factors to calculate the wash-out of the lepton asymmetry by interactions of the lightest right-handed state. We include scattering processes with top quarks in our analysis. This is of particular interest since the wash-out is enhanced by scatterings and the use of mode equations withmoreÂ Â» quantum statistical distribution functions. In this way we provide a restriction on the parameter space for this scenario.Â«Â less\n\nCompartmental analysis of washout effect in rat brain: in-beam OpenPET measurement using a 11C beam\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHirano, Yoshiyuki; Kinouchi, Shoko; Ikoma, Yoko; Yoshida, Eiji; Wakizaka, Hidekazu; Ito, Hiroshi; Yamaya, Taiga\n\n2013-12-01\n\nIn-beam positron emission tomography (PET) is expected to enable visualization of a dose verification using positron emitters (Î²+ decay). For accurate dose verification, correction of the washout of the positron emitters should be made. In addition, the quantitative washout rate has a potential usefulness as a diagnostic index, but modeling for this has not been studied yet. In this paper, therefore, we applied compartment analyses to in-beam PET data acquired by our small OpenPET prototype, which has a physically opened field-of-view (FOV) between two detector rings. A rat brain was located at the FOV and was irradiated by a 11C beam. Time activity curves of the irradiated field were measured immediately after the irradiations, and the washout rate was obtained based on two models: the two-washout model (medium decay, k2m; slow decay, k2s) developed in a study of rabbit irradiation; and the two-compartment model used in nuclear medicine, where efflux from tissue to blood (k2), influx (k3) and efflux (k4) from the first to second compartments in tissue were evaluated. The observed k2m and k2s were 0.34 and 0.005 min-1, respectively, which was consistent with the rabbit study. Also k2m was close to the washout rate in cerebral blood flow (CBF) measurements by dynamic PET with 15O-water, while, k2, k3, and k4 were 0.16, 0.15 and 0.007 min-1. Our present work suggested the dynamics of 11C might be relevant to CBF or permeability of a molecule containing 11C atoms might be regulated by a transporter because the k2 was relatively low compared with a simple diffusion tracer.\n\nWR 148: identifying the companion of an extreme runaway massive binary*\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMunoz, Melissa; Moffat, Anthony F. J.; Hill, Grant M.; Shenar, Tomer; Richardson, Noel D.; Pablo, Herbert; St-Louis, Nicole; Ramiaramanantsoa, Tahina\n\n2017-05-01\n\nWR 148 (HD 197406) is an extreme runaway system considered to be a potential candidate for a short-period (4.3173 d) rare WR + compact object binary. Provided with new high-resolution, high signal-to-noise spectra from the Keck observatory, we determine the orbital parameters for both the primary WR and the secondary, yielding respective projected orbital velocity amplitudes of 88.1 Â± 3.8 km s-1 and 79.2 Â± 3.1 km s-1 and implying a mass ratio of 1.1 Â± 0.1. We then apply the shift-and-add technique to disentangle the spectra and obtain spectra compatible with a WN7ha and an O4-6 star. Considering an orbital inclination of Ë67Â°, derived from previous polarimetry observations, the system's total mass would be a mere 2-3M_{â}, an unprecedented result for a putative massive binary system. However, a system comprising a 37 M_{â} secondary (typical mass of an O5V star) and a 33 M_{â} primary (given the mass ratio) would infer an inclination of Ë18Â°. We therefore reconsider the previous methods of deriving the orbital inclination based on time-dependent polarimetry and photometry. While the polarimetric results are inconclusive requiring better data, the photometric results favour low inclinations. Finally, we compute WR 148's space velocity and retrace the runaway's trajectory back to the Galactic plane (GP). With an ejection velocity of 198 Â± 27 km s-1 and a travel time of 4.7 Â± 0.8 Myr to reach its current location, WR 148 was most likely ejected via dynamical interactions in a young cluster.\n\nCharacterization of Carbon Dioxide Washout Measurement Techniques in the Mark-III Space Suit\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nMeginnis, Ian M.; Norcross, Jason; Bekdash, Omar; Ploutz-Snyder, Robert\n\n2016-01-01\n\nA space suit must provide adequate carbon dioxide (CO2) washout inside the helmet to prevent symptoms of hypercapnia. In the past, an oronasal mask has been used to measure the inspired air of suited subjects to determine a space suit's CO2 washout capability. While sufficient for super-ambient pressure testing of space suits, the oronasal mask fails to meet several human factors and operational criterion needed for future sub-ambient pressure testing (e.g. compatibility with a Valsalva device). This paper describes the evaluation of a nasal cannula as a device for measuring inspired air within a space suit. Eight test subjects were tasked with walking on a treadmill or operating an arm ergometer to achieve target metabolic rates of 1000, 2000, and 3000 British thermal units per hour (BTU/hr), at flow rates of 2, 4, and 6 actual cubic feet per minute (ACFM). Each test configuration was conducted twice, with subjects instructed to breathe either through their nose only, or however they felt comfortable. Test data shows that the nasal cannula provides more statistically consistent data across test subjects than the oronasal mask used in previous tests. The data also shows that inhaling/exhaling through only the nose provides a lower sample variance than a normal breathing style. Nose-only breathing reports better CO2 washout due to several possible reasons, including a decreased respiratory rate, an increased tidal volume, and because nose-only breathing directs all of the exhaled CO2 down and away from the oronasal region. The test subjects in this study provided feedback that the nasal cannula is comfortable and can be used with the Valsalva device.\n\nBurr Hole Washout versus Craniotomy for Chronic Subdural Hematoma: Patient Outcome and Cost Analysis\n\nPubMed Central\n\nRegan, Jacqueline M.; Worley, Emmagene; Shelburne, Christopher; Pullarkat, Ranjit; Watson, Joseph C.\n\n2015-01-01\n\nChronic subdural hematomas (CSDH), which are frequently encountered in neurosurgical practice, are, in the majority of cases, ideally treated with surgical drainage. Despite this common practice, there is still controversy surrounding the best surgical procedure. With lack of clear evidence of a superior technique, surgeons are free to base the decision on other factors that are not related to patient care. A retrospective chart review of 119 patients requiring surgical drainage of CSDH was conducted at a large tertiary care center over a three-year period. Of the cases reviewed, 58 patients underwent craniotomy, while 61 patients underwent burr hole washout. The study focused on re-operation rates, mortality, and morbidity, as measured by Glasgow coma scores (GCS), discharge Rankin disability scores, and discharge disposition. Secondary endpoints included length of stay and cost of procedure. Burr hole washout was superior to craniotomy with respect to patient outcome, length of stay and recurrence rates. In both study groups, patients required additional surgical procedures (6.6% of burr hole patients and 24.1% of craniotomy patients) (P = 0.0156). Of the patients treated with craniotomy, 51.7% were discharged home, whereas 65.6% of the burr hole patients were discharged home. Patients who underwent burr hole washout spent a mean of 78.8 minutes in the operating suite while the patients undergoing craniotomy spent 129.4 minutes (P < 0.001). The difference in mean cost per patient, based solely on operating time, was $2,828 (P < 0.001). This does not include the further cost due to additional procedures and hospital stay. The mean length of stay after surgical intervention was 3 days longer for the craniotomy group (P = 0.0465). Based on this retrospective study, burr hole washout is superior for both patientsâ clinical and financial outcome; however, prospective long-term multicenter clinical studies are required to verify these findings.

We executed the observations at four different epochs around periastron passage in Jan. 2009 to understand the W-R stellar wind as well as the wind-wind collision shocks. The total exposure was 210 ks. We detected hard X-ray excess in the HXD band (> 10 keV) for the first time from a W-R binary. Another notable discovery was a soft component which is less absorbed even by the dense wind. The spectra can be fitted by three different components; one is for the cool component with kT=0.1--0.6 keV, one for a dominant high-temperature component with kT Ë3 keV, and one for the hardest power-law component with the photon index of Ë2. As periastron approached, the column density of the high-temperature component increased, which can be explained as self-absorption by the W-R wind. The emission measure of the dominant, high-temperature component is not inversely proportional to the distance between the two stars.\n\nA Chandra grating observation of the dusty Wolf-Rayet star WR 48a\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nZhekov, Svetozar A.; GagnÃ©, Marc; Skinner, Stephen L., E-mail: szhekov@space.bas.bg, E-mail: mgagne@wcupa.edu, E-mail: stephen.skinner@colorado.edu\n\nWe present results of a Chandra High-Energy Transmission Grating (HETG) observation of the carbon-rich Wolf-Rayet (WR) star WR 48a. These are the first high-resolution spectra of this object in X-ray. Blueshifted centroids of the spectral lines of â¼ â 360 km s{sup â1} and line widths of 1000-1500 km s{sup â1} (FWHM) were deduced from the analysis of the line profiles of strong emission lines. The forbidden line of Si XIII is strong and not suppressed, indicating that the rarified 10-30 MK plasma forms far from strong sources of far-ultraviolet emission, most likely in a wind collision zone. Global spectralmoreÂ Â» modeling showed that the X-ray spectrum of WR 48a suffered higher absorption in the 2012 October Chandra observation compared with a previous 2008 January XMM-Newton observation. The emission measure of the hot plasma in WR 48a decreased by a factor â¼3 over the same period of time. The most likely physical picture that emerges from the analysis of the available X-ray data is that of colliding stellar winds in a wide binary system with an elliptical orbit. We propose that the unseen secondary star in the system is another WR star or perhaps a luminous blue variable.Â«Â less\n\nRisk Assessment for the Explosive Washout Lagoons (Site 4), Umatilla Depot Activity Hermiston, Oregon\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n1992-03-01\n\nActivity .............................. 2 2-2 Explosive Washout Lagoons (Site 4) and Washout Plant Area ............................... 2-3 3-1 Site 4...ponds for liquid wastes from bomb-washing operations in the washout plant .

However, since diffusion into surrounding tissues and removal by the vascular system are major factors in the overall distribution of lidocaine in vivo, true kinetics of drug/neural tissue interactions must be studied in the absence of those confounding factors. Methods Uptake: Ensheathed or desheathed isolated rat sciatic nerves were exposed to [14C]-lidocaine for 0-180min and then removed and the lidocaine content of nerve and sheath analyzed. Washout: Isolated nerves were soaked in [14C]-lidocaine for 60min and then placed in lidocaine-free solution for 0-30min, with samples removed at different times to assess the drug content. Experimental variables included the effects of the ensheathing epineurium, lidocaine concentration, pH, presence of CO2-bicarbonate, and incubation duration. Results The equilibrium uptake of lidocaine increased with incubation time, concentration and the fraction of molecules in the non-ionized form. The uptake rate was unaffected by drug concentration, but was about halved by the presence of the epineurial sheath, with the washout rate slowed less. Slight alkalinization, from pH 6.8 to pH 7.4, by bicarbonate-CO2 buffer or a non-bicarbonate buffer, enhanced the neural uptake, and to the same degree. The washout of lidocaine was faster after shorter incubations at high concentrations than when equal amounts of lidocaine were taken up after long incubations at low lidocaine concentrations. Conclusion Lidocaine enters a nerve by a process other than free diffusion, through an epineurial sheath that is a slight obstacle. Given the rapid entry in vitro compared to the much smaller and transient content measured in vivo, it seems highly unlikely that lidocaine equilibrates with the nerve during a peripheral blockade.

Of the many functions provided by the spacesuit and portable life support subsystem within the AEMU, delivering breathing gas to the astronaut along with removing the carbon dioxide (CO2) remains one of the most important environmental functions that the AEMU can control. Carbon dioxide washout is the capability of the ventilation flow in the spacesuit helmet to provide low concentrations of CO2 to the crew member to meet breathing requirements. CO2 washout performance is a critical parameter needed to ensure proper and sufficient designs in a spacesuit and in vehicle applications such as sleep stations and hygiene compartments. Human testing to fully evaluate and validate CO2 washout performance is necessary but also expensive due to the levied safety requirements. Moreover, correlation of math models becomes challenging because of human variability and movement. To supplement human CO2 washout testing, a breathing capability will be integrated into a suited manikin test apparatus to provide a safe, lower cost, stable, easily modeled alternative to human testing. Additionally, this configuration provides NASA Johnson Space Center (JSC) the capability to evaluate CO2 washout under off-nominal conditions that would otherwise be unsafe for human testing or difficult due to fatigue of a test subject. Testing has been under way in-house at JSC and analysis has been initiated to evaluate whether the technology provides sufficient performance in ensuring that the CO2 is removed sufficiently and the ventilation flow is adequate for maintaining CO2 washout in the AEMU spacesuit helmet of the crew member during an extravehicular activity. This paper will review recent CO2 washout testing and analysis activities, testing planned in-house with a spacesuit simulator, and the associated analytical work\n\nAntimutagenicity of WR-1065 in L5178Y cells exposed to accelerated (56)Fe ions\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nEvans, H. H.; Evans, T. E.; Horng, M. F.\n\n2002-01-01\n\nThe ability of the aminothiol WR-1065 [N-(2-mercaptoethyl)-1,3-diaminopropane] to protect L5178Y (LY) cells against the cytotoxic and mutagenic effects of exposure to accelerated (56)Fe ions (1.08 GeV/nucleon) was determined. It was found that while WR-1065 reduced the mutagenicity in both cell lines when it was present during the irradiation, the addition of WR-1065 after the exposure had no effect on the mutagenicity of the radiation in either cell line. No marked protection against the cytotoxic effects of exposure to (56)Fe ions was provided by WR-1065 when added either during or after irradiation in either cell line. We reported previously that WR-1065 protected the LY-S1 and LY-SR1 cell lines against both the cytotoxicity and mutagenicity of X radiation when present during exposure, but that its protection when administered after exposure was limited to the mutagenic effects in the radiation-hypersensitive cell line, LY-S1. The results indicate that the mechanisms involved differ in the protection against cytotoxic compared to mutagenic effects and in the protection against damage caused by accelerated (56)Fe ions compared to X radiation.\n\n[Research on the eventual cross-reactivity of anti-Wr(a) with various viral, bacterial and mycotic antigenes (author's transl)].\n\nPubMed\n\nGarelli, S; Valbonesi, M; Picerno, G; Vazzana, A\n\n1978-09-01\n\nAmong the sera of 1011 blood donors, they have been collected 34 anti-Wr(a) antibodies. By IgG antiglobulin test, the titer was 1/8 or more in 21 sera. After absorption on viral, bacterial and mycotic antigens, the sera were still reactive with Wr(a) + red blood cells. These results show that no tested antigen is cross-reactive with Wr(a) antigen. However, the AA. suggest that the research of a widley diffused antigen, cross-reactive with Wr(a) + red blood cells, is a valuable approach to the problem of IgG anti-Wr(a) antibodies in normal, never transfused blood donors.\n\nDetermination of the cytoprotective agent WR-2721 (Amifostine, Ethyol) and its metabolites in human blood using monobromobimane fluorescent labeling and high-performance liquid chromatography.\n\nPubMed\n\nSouid, A K; Newton, G L; Dubowy, R L; Fahey, R C; Bernstein, M L\n\n1998-01-01\n\nWR-2721 [S-2-(3-aminopropylamino)ethylphosphorothioic acid] is a chemoprotective agent that is currently in pediatric clinical trials. It is a prodrug that is dephosphorylated by alkaline phosphatase to the active free thiol form, WR-1065 [S-2-(3-aminopropylamino)ethanethiol]. It is likely that adequate and sustained cellular levels of the drug are necessary for optimum cytoprotection. To date, a method to measure both plasma and cellular levels of WR-2721 and its metabolites in clinical samples has not been available. In the study reported here the monobromobimane (mBBr) fluorescent labeling method was used to measure these levels when drug was added in vitro to blood samples from normal volunteers. In addition, we present pharmacokinetic data from a pediatric patient receiving WR-2721 (825 mg/m2 x 2). The results can be summarized as follows: (1) WR-2721 was detected in the patient's plasma with a half-life of about 10 min; (2) the WR-1065 concentration in the blood cellular fraction was similar to that of plasma; (3) both WR-1065 and WR-SS-low molecular weight (WR-SS-LMW) metabolites disappeared from plasma and the cellular fraction by 3.6 h after WR-2721 infusion; (4) a large proportion of WR-1065 was oxidized in plasma to WR-SS protein and WR-SS-LMW; (5) a large proportion of WR-1065 in the cellular fraction was oxidized to WR-SS-protein; (6) the WR-SS-LMW concentration in the cellular fraction was low; and (7) saturation of plasma and cellular protein binding sites was possible. The pharmacokinetic data that were generated with this technique could guide clinical trials using WR-2721.\n\nPhysical properties of the WR stars in Westerlund 1\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nRosslowe, C. K.; Crowther, P. A.; Clark, J. S.; Negueruela, I.\n\nThe Westerlund 1 (Wd1) cluster hosts a rich and varied collection of massive stars. Its dynamical youth and the absence of ongoing star formation indicate a coeval population. As such, the simultaneous presence of both late-type supergiants and Wolf-Rayet stars has defied explanation in the context of single-star evolution. Observational evidence points to a high binary fraction, hence this stellar population offers a robust test for stellar models accounting for both single-star and binary evolution. We present an optical to near-IR (VLT & NTT) spectroscopic analysis of 22 WR stars in Wd 1, delivering physical properties for the WR stars. We discuss how these differ from the Galactic field population, and how they may be reconciled with the predictions of single and binary evolutionary models.\n\nA New Surgical Device for Anterograde Intraoperative Rectal Washout.\n\nPubMed\n\nRondelli, Fabio; Santinelli, Roberto; Stella, Paolo; Bugiantella, Walter; Ceccarelli, Graziano; Balzarotti, Ruben Carlo; De Rosa, Michele; Avenia, Nicola\n\n2018-06-01\n\nColorectal cancer is the fourth most diffuse cause of death in the world and local recurrence is associated with a reduced long-term life expectancy, with a reduced quality of life. Rectal washout at the anastomosis site leads to a statistically significant reduction of local recurrences. We developed the idea of a new laparoscopic stapler with an integrated washout system that could decontaminate the rectal stump before resection, without the need to enlarge the standard surgical incision or even to distort the incision site, closing the rectal stump just below the inferior part of the cancer, and then proceeding with the resection and stapling of the distal part of the tumor. Combined with these canonical functionalities, the new device, equipped with a patented washout system (patent number EP 3103401A1) will also allow to inject in the closed bowel a physiologic saline liquid. In force of the mechanical action of the liquid injected, carcinogenic exfoliated cells eventually floating in the affected region of the colonic lumen will be expelled through the anal orifice. The intraoperative rectal washout, both in minimally invasive and in traditional open surgery, thus becomes a simple, effective, and reproducible procedure. We describe the technical features and the possible clinical applications of a potentially new surgical laparoscopic stapler coupled with an integrated irrigation system. We have patented the system and we are developing a prototype with the aim to start an experimental pilot study.\n\nCharacterization of Carbon Dioxide Washout Measurement Techniques in the Mark-III Space Suit\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nMeginnis, I; Norcross, J.; Bekdash, O.\n\n2016-01-01\n\nIt is essential to provide adequate carbon dioxide (CO2) washout in a space suit to reduce the risks associated with manned operations in space suits. Symptoms of elevated CO2 levels range from reduced cognitive performance and headache to unconsciousness and death at high levels of CO2. Because of this, NASA imposes limits on inspired CO2 levels for space suits when they are used in space and for ground testing. Testing and/or analysis must be performed to verify that a space suit meets CO2 washout requirements. Testing for developmental space suits has traditionally used an oronasal mask that collects CO2 samples at the left and rights sides of the mouth. Testing with this mask resulted in artificially elevated CO2 concentration measurements, which is most likely due to the dead space volume at the front of the mask. The mask also extends outward and into the supply gas stream, w"
