The Conversion of Mary Magdalene is an oil painting, an early work by the Italian Renaissance artist based in Venice, Paolo Veronese (1528–1588). He was known for his sumptuous paintings with a dramatic and colourful style. Dating from circa 1545–1548, the painting was commissioned by a noble patron in Verona. It is held by the National Gallery in London.

The subject of the painting had been debated: the general opinion is that it depicts the conversion of Mary Magdalene, as described in Pietro Aretino's 1535 book L'umanità di Cristo; this version of the Gospels was widely distributed and read in Northern Italy at this time. In the legend that inspired the painting, Mary went to a temple where the teachings of Jesus inspired her to convert to a pious life. In the painting she is depicted in dress inappropriate for the religious building, which Veronese used to symbolise her prior sinful life. She is shown on her knees and blushing as she listens to Jesus.
