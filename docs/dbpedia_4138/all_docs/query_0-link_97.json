        "text": "Oil on canvas; 124.7 x 89.5 cm (35 x 48 ¾ in)\n\nEXHIBITED:\n\nA. Orlando, I Fiori del Barocco. Pittura a Genova dal Naturalismo al Rococò, exhib. cat., Genoa, 2006, no. 73 (entry by Angela Acordon), pp. 214-215.\n\nIn this early work by the Genoese painter Giovanni Andrea de Ferrari the young and beautiful Magdalene, is placed at left, half-length behind a draped table. Before her is a detailed still-life comprised of a silver urn of flowers, a glass pyxis, a gossamer scarf and a long string of pearls. She wears a deep blue gown over a fine lace-trimmed chemise, and is lavishly accessorized with jewellery in fine-wrought gold with blue stones. While combing her long strawberry blond hair, she turns her arrested gaze to her ‘sister’ Martha at right, who is dressed in a more modest, but still richly coloured gown of silvery mauve over a plain linen chemise. Her dark hair is bound in a gold scarf worn round her head in the manner of a turban, the long ends draped over her shoulder. In profile, with her hands clasped, she turns to the Magdalene and pleads with her to abandon all that ties her to worldliness and sin in favour of following Christs path. Carlo Volpe first recognised this picture as an autograph work by Giovanni Andrea and the attribution was confirmed by Angela Acordon who pronounced the work to be qualitativamente assai notavole, dating it to between 1625 and 1630."
