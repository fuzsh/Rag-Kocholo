        "text": "Format for Holy Hour\n\nScripture Reading: Luke 7:36–50\n\nContext: Simon, a Pharisee, invited Jesus to dinner at his house. It was a common courtesy that guests be welcomed with a kiss, be anointed on the head with oil and be given water to wash their feet when they arrive. Simon did not offer any of these courtesies.\n\nThis story, however, is not so much a complaint about the lack of hospitality of Simon as it is about the sincere goodness of this repentant woman. Jesus points to the fact that she is forgiven because “she loved much.” Thus, her love and Jesus’ merciful forgiveness are the central focus.\n\nThis story also shows that Simon is very judgmental. Jesus reads his thoughts and gently reproves him for his lack of love but honors the woman for her deep love.\n\nReflection: Prayerfully read the Scripture passage above and use these reflection points if useful in your meditation:\n\nImagine the arrival of Jesus at Simon’s house. Notice the lack of hospitality. Try to imagine Simon.\n\nReflect upon the courage of this sinful woman. Think about her as she must have worried about coming to the party without an invitation. Consider the fears she had to overcome.\n\nTry to look into her heart as her eyes met Jesus’ for the first time. Imagine the interior emotions that led her to bow to the ground, kiss His feet, anoint Him with her perfume and cry uncontrollably.\n\nLook into Jesus’ heart. See His compassion and sincere concern for her.\n\nPonder the words, “Your sins are forgiven.” And “Your faith has saved you; go in peace.”\n\nFeatured Image: Rubens-Feast of Simon the Pharisee\n\nIntroduction to Meditations for Ordinary Time\n\nBaptism of the Lord\n\nTwo Standards\n\nThree Classes of Men\n\nTemptation\n\nCalling of Apostles\n\nWedding at Cana\n\nCleansing the Temple\n\nSermon on the Mount\n\nCalming the Storm\n\nWalking on Water\n\nThe Apostles were Sent to Preach\n\nConversion of Mary Magdalene\n\nHow Christ Fed the Five Thousand\n\nTransfiguration of Christ\n\nResurrection of Lazarus\n\nSupper in Bethany\n\nThree Ways of Humility"
