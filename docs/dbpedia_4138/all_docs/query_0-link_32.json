        "text": "By Charlotte Phillips\n\nOn July 22, we will celebrate the feast of St. Mary Magdalene. Scripture does not tell us a whole lot about this remarkable woman, but I believe she is an incredible saint and one we can all look up to and admire for her radical conversion and faith in Jesus.\n\nLuke 8:1-2 tells us, “Afterward he journeyed from one town and village to another, preaching and proclaiming the good news of the kingdom of God. Accompanying him were the Twelve and some women who had been cured of evil spirits and infirmities, Mary, called Magdalene, from whom seven demons had gone out.”\n\nWhat do these two verses tell us about Mary Magdalene? We know she was one of the women who followed Jesus and the twelve apostles. We also know Jesus freed her from seven demons. As you may know, seven is a symbolic number in scripture. It is seen as fullness or completeness. So before following Jesus and his apostles as they traveled to spread the Good News, Mary Magdalene was completely consumed by demons, or by a spirit not of God.\n\nJesus, full of love and compassion, not only freed her of these demons, but Mary Magdalene had a complete conversion. She not only believed in Jesus, but she accompanied him on his mission and was with him as he was crucified on the cross.\n\nAll four gospels also tell us she was the first person the Risen Christ appeared to after his death. In John’s Gospel, we read how Mary Magdalene stayed outside of the tomb weeping for Jesus before she realized it was him who appeared to her. After realizing it was Jesus, John 20:18 tells us, “Mary of Magdala went and announced to the disciples, “I have seen the Lord,” and what he told her.”\n\nWhy is this important for us today? The Risen Christ first appeared to someone, who before having faith in Jesus, was not just a sinful person; she was completely consumed by a spirit not of God. Mary Magdalene, like each of us, was broken and in need of Jesus’ great love and mercy. And just like he did with Mary Magdalene, Jesus is also here to offer us mercy and love in our sin and our brokenness. Like Mary Magdelene, because of Jesus’ great love and mercy for us, we too are called to go out and proclaim, “I have seen the Lord” and spread the Good News of Jesus."
