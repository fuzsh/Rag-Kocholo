        "text": "Mary Magdalene is one of the most speculated about people in the New Testament. Even in early Gnostic writings from the second century, wild claims have been made about her that simply are not true.\n\nWe do know from Scripture that when Mary Magdalene met Jesus Christ, he cast seven demons out of her (Luke 8:1-3). After that, she became his faithful follower, along with several other women. Mary proved to be more loyal to Jesus than even his own 12 apostles. Instead of hiding after his arrest, she stood near the cross as Jesus died. She also went to the tomb to anoint his body with spices.\n\nIn movies and books, Mary Magdalene is often portrayed as a prostitute, but nowhere does the Bible make that claim. Dan Brown's 2003 novel The Da Vinci Code invents a scenario in which Jesus and Mary Magdalene were married and had a child. Nothing in the Bible or history supports such a notion.\n\nThe heretical Gospel of Mary, often attributed to Mary Magdalene, is a gnostic forgery dating from the second century. Like other gnostic gospels, it uses a famous person's name to try to legitimize its content.\n\nMary Magdalene has often been confused with Mary of Bethany, who anointed Jesus' feet prior to his death in Matthew 26:6-13, Mark 14:3-9, and John 12:1-8.\n\nWhen Mary Magdelene Meets Jesus\n\nWhen Mary Magdalene met Jesus, she was set free from seven demons. From that day forward, her life was forever changed. Mary became a devoted believer and traveled with Jesus and the disciples as they ministered throughout Galilee and Judea.\n\nOut of her own wealth, Mary helped care for Jesus and the needs of his disciples. She was deeply devoted to Jesus and stayed with him at the foot of the cross during his crucifixion when others fled in fear. She and other women bought spices to anoint the body of Jesus and appeared at his tomb in all four Gospels.\n\nMary Magdalene was honored by Jesus as the first person he appeared to after his resurrection.\n\nBecause Mary Magdalene was charged in all four Gospels to be the first to share the good news of Christ's resurrection, she is often called the first evangelist. She is mentioned more often than any other woman in the New Testament.\n\nMary Magdalene is the subject of much controversy, legend, and misconception. There is no evidence to back up claims that she was a reformed prostitute, the wife of Jesus, and the mother of his child.\n\nLife Lessons From Mary Magdalene\n\nBeing a follower of Jesus Christ will result in hard times. Mary stood by Jesus as he suffered and died on the cross, saw him buried, and came to the empty tomb on the third morning. When Mary told the apostles Jesus had risen, none of them believed her. Yet she never wavered. Mary Magdalene knew what she knew. As Christians, we too will be the target of ridicule and distrust, but we must hold onto the truth. Jesus is worth it.\n\nKey Verses\n\nLuke 8:1–3\n\nSoon afterward Jesus began a tour of the nearby towns and villages, preaching and announcing the Good News about the Kingdom of God. He took his twelve disciples with him, along with some women who had been cured of evil spirits and diseases. Among them were Mary Magdalene, from whom he had cast out seven demons; Joanna, the wife of Chuza, Herod’s business manager; Susanna; and many others who were contributing from their own resources to support Jesus and his disciples. (NLT)\n\nJohn 19:25\n\nNear the cross of Jesus stood his mother, his mother's sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene. (NIV)\n\nMark 15:47\n\nMary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joseph saw where he was laid. (NIV)"
