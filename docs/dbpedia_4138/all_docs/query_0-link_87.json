        "text": "St. Mary Magdalene lived during the time of Jesus. Scriptures tell us that she was a close friend of Jesus. She was also present during the formation of the Early Church.\n\nSt. Mary Magdalene is considered one of the great female saints in the Church. You can use this novena to seek intercession from this holy woman in your life!\n\nAbout St. Mary Magdalene\n\nIt is not known for certain what year St. Mary Magdalene was born, but the Bible tells us she was an adult during the time of Jesus’ public ministry and death.\n\nSome sources hold that Mary Magdalene was a prostitute or a sexually immoral woman before she encountered Jesus. But the Bible does not say that this was the case. It is likely that she lived among the Gentiles and lived as they did, despite her Jewish heritage.\n\nScripture says that Mary was a great sinner of some kind before meeting Christ. He cast seven demons out of her, and she then became one of His followers. It is thought that she also told several other women what Jesus had done for her and that these women became His followers as well.\n\nSome scholars hold that Mary Magdalene is the sinful woman mentioned in St. John’s Gospel who washes Jesus’ feet with her tears and dries them with her hair. But other scholars are less certain that this woman was St. Mary Magdalene. Nonetheless, scholars do agree that Mary Magdalene was a repentant sinner who became one of Jesus’ followers. Some believe that she was part of a group of women who traveled with Jesus and His Disciples.\n\nDuring the Passion and Death of Jesus, Mary Magdalene was probably among the group of women who watched from a distance.\n\nScripture also tells us that Mary Magdalene was one of the first people Christ appeared to after He rose from the dead. According to the Gospel of St. John, Mary Magdalene went to Jesus’ tomb early in the morning on the first day of the week. She saw that the stone had been removed from the tomb, so she ran to tell the Apostles.\n\nAfter Peter and John saw the empty tomb and the burial clothes, they returned home. Mary Magdalene stayed outside the tomb crying. But then she saw two angels in the tomb, who asked her why she was weeping. She told them she was weeping because someone had taken Jesus’ body.\n\nThen, Jesus appeared to her but she did not recognize Him. When He said her name, she recognized Him and clung to Him. Then, she told the Apostles she had seen Him.\n\nIt is traditionally believed that Mary Magdalene remained among the early members of the Church in the years following Christ’s Ascension into Heaven. Legend says that she was eventually put into a boat without oars or paddles along with some other Christians, and that the boat landed in the south of France. She lived the rest of her life alone in a cave.\n\nSt. Mary Magdalene’s Feast Day: July 22nd\n\nWhy Pray the St. Mary Magdalene Novena?\n\nSt. Mary Magdalene is the patron saint of women. You can seek her intercession if you are a woman, or you can ask her to pray for a particular woman in your life.\n\nSt. Mary Magdalene is also the patron saint of converts and penitent sinners. You can ask her to pray for you if you are a convert to Catholicism or if you have come back to the Faith after a sinful past. You can also ask her to pray for someone you know who is a convert or a revert to the Faith.\n\nAdditionally, St. Mary Magdalene is the patron saint of glove makers, hairdressers, perfumeries, pharmacists, and tanners. You can ask her to pray for you if you work in one of these professions, or you can ask her to pray for someone you know who works in one of these professions.\n\nYou can pray the St. Mary Magdalene Novena for any intention!"
