From then on, Mary Magdalene supported the Apostles throughout their ministry.\n\nShe followed Jesus to His crucifixion and stood beside His mother and St. John at the foot of the cross.\n\nRoad to Sainthood\n\nAfter the Sabbath, Mary Magdalene returned to an empty tomb and became the first witness of Christ’s Resurrection.\n\nShe ran and brought the good news to the Apostles, becoming the first to announce the rising of Christ to new life. The Apostles went on to proclaim to the world this truth they learned from her.\n\nIn 2016, Pope Francis elevated the status of her liturgical celebration to a feast in order to stress her importance as a disciple and evangelizer.\n\nMary Magdalene in the Bible\n\nMary was a faithful witness to Jesus. Consider this passage from Scripture in the holy Gospel according to John:\n\nJesus said to her, “Woman, why are you weeping? Whom are you looking for?” She thought it was the gardener and said to him, “Sir, if you carried him away, tell me where you laid him, and I will take him.” Jesus said to her, “Mary!” She turned and said to him in Hebrew, “Rabbouni,” which means Teacher. Jesus said to her, “Stop holding on to me, for I have not yet ascended to the Father. But go to my brothers and tell them, ‘I am going to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God.’” Mary of Magdala went and announced to the disciples, “I have seen the Lord,” and what he told her.\n\nSt. Mary Magdalene, pray for us!\n\nMary Magdalene Prayer\n\nTry this short prayer asking for St. Mary Magdalene’s intercession:\n\nSaint Mary Magdalene, woman of many sins, who by conversion became the beloved of Jesus and remained at His cross, thank you for your witness that Jesus forgives through the miracle of love. You, who already possess eternal happiness in His glorious presence, please intercede for me, so that one day I may share in the same everlasting joy. Amen.\n\nMary Magdalene and Your Prayer Life\n\nLook to Mary Magdalene’s intercession when you’re feeling unworthy or inadequate. Ask her to intercede for you when you feel drawn to past sins or old, bad habits.\n\nPatronage\n\nSt. Mary Magdalene Church – Columbus, Ohio\n\nSt. Mary Magdalene Church – Humble, Texas\n\nSt. Mary Magdalene School – Apex, N.C.\n\nRelated Saints\n\nOur Lady of Guadalupe\n\nOur Lady of Chiquinquira\n\nRelated Prayers"
