        "text": "The Conversion of Mary Magdalene, by Elizabeth Zelasko,\n\nwas commissioned by Avodah in 2022.\n\nTHINGS TO MEDITATE ON.\n\n*The image reads left to right. Mary is being called out of sin and into a new life. You will\n\nsee symbols of death on the left and symbols of life on the right.\n\n*You see the tomb on the upper left. Dry and broken bones. These are the symbols that\n\nMary Magdalene carried during a life of sin.\n\n*The human skull on the bottom left has been stoned to death by sin; a death that Jesus\n\nsaved Mary from. Not only physically but spiritually.\n\n*The laid down stones represents the sins committed by Mary but also of the sins\n\ncommitted by others against her.\n\n*Mary is wearing the colors of lent and penance but there is a glow of red as she is lit up\n\nfrom her encounter with Christ. Red is the color she will wear in icons when depicted as a saint.\n\n*In many icons Mary has six strands of hair showing. This represents her lack of\n\nperfection as seven is the number of perfection.\n\n*Her body language is one of imitating Christ. This is what she will do after her\n\nencounter with him. She is almost not even aware that her hands are imitating him. Her\n\ngaze is intensely caught up in his. She becomes Christlike.\n\nAs we move to the right you will notice life.\n\n*Christ has drawn a line in the sand. Some scholars have speculated that he was\n\nperhaps writing the sins of others. This is possible. The same word in Greek is used\n\nhere for “writing in the earth” as was used when speaking of God “writing the law into\n\nthe tablets” for Moses. I find that most interesting. Moses came down and smashed the\n\ntablets after having caught God’s people in an act of adultery. The same sin that Mary\n\nhas been found guilty of.\n\n*Visually Christ and the line create a perfectly right angle. His line in the sand here\n\nrepresents the law. He is calling Mary to cross over this line into a new life.\n\n*He meets her where she is at, and reaches over this line lovingly to help her. Their\n\nhands a bit reminiscent of Michelangelo’s creation scene. This is the creator reaching\n\ndown to his creation and saying, “Follow me.”\n\n*The oil jar and red eggs represent the symbols of her new life that she will pick up,\n\ncarry and be remembered by. In iconography Mary is shown holding these things- the\n\noil jar for the costly nard that she anointed Jesus with and red (for the blood of Christ\n\nand new life) Easter eggs as she is the first one to see Jesus after his resurrection from\n\nthe dead.\n\n*At the top of the canvas you see a tomb for death and as you move to the right there\n\nare mountains. Mountains in iconography always symbolize the spiritual journey\n\nupwards towards God and reaching new heights. The often look like stairs for this\n\nreason. They are never shown as coming to a perfect peak because even creation\n\nbows down to its creator.\n\n*Sin and death are a desert and Christ is the oasis that teams with life and living water. I\n\nhave added plant life behind Christ to illustrate this point.\n\n*As is typical in iconography, the 14K gold sky is the light from the new Jerusalem.\n\n*Please note that your order is fulfilled by Printful on museum-quality matte paper.
