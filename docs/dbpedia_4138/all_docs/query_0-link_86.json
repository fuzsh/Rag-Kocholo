        "text": "The Conversion of Saint Mary Magdalene is a work by French artist Paul Delaroche (1797 - 1856). It's one figure and tableau oil on millboard painting created in 1834-1835. The painting is owned by the museum of The Wallace Collection - London, one of the museums with the most Paul Delaroche works, and is accessible to the general public. Paul Delaroche was influenced by Romanticism and Academic Art, and made most paintings about figure and tableau and portrait.\n\nFor faithful reproductions, our artists will study the oeuvre and techniques of Paul Delaroche. The original painting of The Conversion of Saint Mary Magdalene is about 17\" wide and 8\" high. You may customize the painting's size and frame, for d√©cor or gifting, from 42\" by 20\" to size as huge as a wall. Our artists use oil on canvas by default. You may also request non-oil media.
