        "text": "Adoration is love, and eucharistic adoration is love of Christ present in the Blessed Sacrament. In the Gospels there are few people who understand love for Jesus as well as Mary Magdalene, which is the reason she is a prophetess of eucharistic love.\n\nThis work is an extended meditation on the life of Saint Mary Magdalene, known as the \"Apostle to the Apostles\" because the Risen Christ appeared to her first and then sent her to announce the Resurrection to the apostles. Based on the biblical texts traditionally associated with Mary Magdalene, this book helps readers to learn from her inspiring example and to enter more deeply into adoration of Jesus Christ truly present in the Blessed Sacrament.\n\nIn telling the story of Mary Magdalene's profound conversion after the Lord had to expel seven demons from her soul, this book shows how she is a shining witness to the transforming power of an encounter with Jesus Christ. Mary Magdalene is the perfect model for those who have experienced the redeeming love of Christ and who seek to deepen their devotion to him and to the Eucharist.\n\nPaperback: 208 pages\n\nPublisher: Ignatius Press (February 2, 2017)\n\nLanguage: English\n\nISBN-10: 1621640922\n\nISBN-13: 978-1621640929\n\nProduct Dimensions: 5.2 x 0.8 x 8 inches\n\nFather Sean Davidson is a member of the Missionaries of the Most Holy Eucharist. He spent two years serving at the magnificent Basilica of Saint Mary Magdalene in Provence, France, where he received the inspiration for this work. He is currently serving at the Eucharistic Retreat Center in the Seminary of the Immaculate Conception, Long Island."
