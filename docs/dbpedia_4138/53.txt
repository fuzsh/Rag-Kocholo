The Conversion of Mary Magdalene, by Elizabeth Zelasko,

was commissioned by Avodah in 2022.

THINGS TO MEDITATE ON.

*The image reads left to right. Mary is being called out of sin and into a new life. You will

see symbols of death on the left and symbols of life on the right.

*You see the tomb on the upper left. Dry and broken bones. These are the symbols that

Mary Magdalene carried during a life of sin.

*The human skull on the bottom left has been stoned to death by sin; a death that Jesus

saved Mary from. Not only physically but spiritually.

*The laid down stones represents the sins committed by Mary but also of the sins

committed by others against her.

*Mary is wearing the colors of lent and penance but there is a glow of red as she is lit up

from her encounter with Christ. Red is the color she will wear in icons when depicted as a saint.

*In many icons Mary has six strands of hair showing. This represents her lack of

perfection as seven is the number of perfection.

*Her body language is one of imitating Christ. This is what she will do after her

encounter with him. She is almost not even aware that her hands are imitating him. Her

gaze is intensely caught up in his. She becomes Christlike.

As we move to the right you will notice life.

*Christ has drawn a line in the sand. Some scholars have speculated that he was

perhaps writing the sins of others. This is possible. The same word in Greek is used

here for “writing in the earth” as was used when speaking of God “writing the law into

the tablets” for Moses. I find that most interesting. Moses came down and smashed the

tablets after having caught God’s people in an act of adultery. The same sin that Mary

has been found guilty of.

*Visually Christ and the line create a perfectly right angle. His line in the sand here

represents the law. He is calling Mary to cross over this line into a new life.

*He meets her where she is at, and reaches over this line lovingly to help her. Their

hands a bit reminiscent of Michelangelo’s creation scene. This is the creator reaching

down to his creation and saying, “Follow me.”

*The oil jar and red eggs represent the symbols of her new life that she will pick up,

carry and be remembered by. In iconography Mary is shown holding these things- the

oil jar for the costly nard that she anointed Jesus with and red (for the blood of Christ

and new life) Easter eggs as she is the first one to see Jesus after his resurrection from

the dead.

*At the top of the canvas you see a tomb for death and as you move to the right there

are mountains. Mountains in iconography always symbolize the spiritual journey

upwards towards God and reaching new heights. The often look like stairs for this

reason. They are never shown as coming to a perfect peak because even creation

bows down to its creator.

*Sin and death are a desert and Christ is the oasis that teams with life and living water. I

have added plant life behind Christ to illustrate this point.

*As is typical in iconography, the 14K gold sky is the light from the new Jerusalem.
