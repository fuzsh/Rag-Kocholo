        "text": "Archives of Maryland\n\nHistorical List\n\nUnited States Representatives\n\nThe U.S. House of Representatives is composed of members chosen every two years by the voters of the respective states. After each federal census, Congress determines the number of representatives for each state on the basis of population (U.S. Constitution, Art. 1, sec. 2).\n\nOver the years, the number of representatives from Maryland has fluctuated:\n\n1789-1793 - 6 representatives\n\n1793-1803 - 8 representatives\n\n1803-1833 - 9 representatives\n\n1833-1843 - 8 representatives\n\n1843-1863 - 6 representatives\n\n1863-1873 - 5 representatives\n\n1873-1953 - 6 representatives\n\n1953-1963 - 7 representatives\n\n1963- 8 representatives\n\nThe legislature of each state prescribes when elections are to be held for U.S. Representatives (U.S. Constitution, Art. 1, sec. 4). Since 1868, Maryland has elected its U.S. Representatives on the first Tuesday in November of each even-numbered year.\n\nBoundaries of Maryland's congressional districts are defined by legislation enacted by the General Assembly. These boundaries have changed over time, and they continue to change. Local boards of election supervisors are empowered to redefine precinct boundaries but cannot alter the election districts or wards designated by the legislature. Consequently, the boundaries defined by law for some modern congressional districts may have undergone changes at the precinct level between enactments of the General Assembly (Code 1957, Art. 33, sec. 2-12).\n\nCongress meets in session at least once every year (U.S. Constitution, Art. 1, sec. 4). From 1789 to 1933, Congress convened on the first Monday in December unless another day was set by law (U.S. Constitution, Art. 1, sec. 4). Since 1934, the first session of Congress has been held on the third day of January unless a different day has been appointed by law (U.S. Constitution, Amendment 20, sec. 2).\n\n1st CONGRESS,
