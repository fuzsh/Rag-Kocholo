        "text": "Riley\n\nThis is the Peter Edelman interview as a part of the Bill Clinton Presidential History Project. Again, let me express our gratitude for your coming down, especially on a very hot day like today, to help out with the project.\n\nEdelman\n\nIt is my pleasure to be here.\n\nRiley\n\nThere are a couple of administrative chores that we usually take care of at the beginning of the interview. The first is for me to reiterate, on the record, the rules of confidentiality governing the proceedings. Nobody in the room is free to report anything that is said in here except you. We do this to encourage you to be completely candid in speaking to the record. We’re not trying to create a record just for the use of the people sitting at this table, but more importantly for scholars and students of American politics and American history, who may be approaching these materials 30 or 40 years down the road. So we’re hoping that we can create an accurate record and as a part of that pledge to you we’re not going to report anything that you say here until the transcript is cleared for use.\n\nThe second thing we do is get a voice ID at the outset so that the transcriptionist will be able to know who is speaking. Kurt here will also be keeping notes, which is a record of each of the interventions to assist in that process and also taking down proper names, so if you see him scribbling a lot, that’s what he’s up to. So I’ll begin. I’m Russell Riley, I’m an associate professor here at the Miller Center and am heading up the Clinton Presidential History Project.\n\nEdelman\n\nI’m Peter Edelman, I’m a professor of law at Georgetown University Law Center.\n\nBerkowitz\n\nI’m Ed Berkowitz, I’m a professor of history at George Washington University.\n\nGermany\n\nI’m Kent Germany, I’m assistant professor at the Miller Center of Public Affairs.\n\nHohenstein\n\nI’m Kurt Hohenstein, recent graduate of the University of Virginia in history and I teach at Hampden-Sydney College.\n\nRiley\n\nVery good. We thought we’d begin by asking you some questions about your own personal biography. I don’t know whether this was being discussed before I came in. Tell us a little bit about your upbringing. Where were you born?\n\nEdelman\n\nThis part makes me a little self-conscious. I was born in Minneapolis, Minnesota, January 9, 1938. I’m Jewish. All of my parents’ parents immigrated to the United States and came to Minnesota. My mother’s parents came to Grand Rapids, Minnesota, birthplace of Judy Garland, and my grandfather was a leading citizen, established and ran the dry goods store there, the local small department store. My father’s parents came to St. Paul.\n\nRiley\n\nWhere did they emigrate from?\n\nEdelman\n\nSome place in what would now be Byelorussia. My surviving aunt, who is 90, is apologetically unable to—I’ve asked her repeatedly to identify exactly where, but someplace in Byelorussia. My father’s family came from someplace near Minsk. His father came from a little town called Rebzevitz. They were all rabbis on my father’s side.\n\nBerkowitz\n\nSo you were not German Jewish.\n\nEdelman\n\nWe were not. No, we were from that section of Russia. My great-grandfather for whom I’m named was evidently quite a distinguished rabbi and a kind of mystical healer, someone who was regionally renowned and a great scholar. My father was very pleased to discover that his father’s brother—this is a sad discovery, but he always thought of his father as having achieved not much, his father was a Hebrew teacher in St. Paul, Minnesota, very poor family. But his father’s brother had been the spiritual leader and stayed back in this little town. My father went and did some genealogical research in some of the collections, the work that had been done with reparations money. He found that his father’s brother had, in a very dignified way, been marched off by the Nazis with other town leaders. What can one say about something so tragic, but he was very proud of that, to discover there was some distinction on his father’s side of the family.\n\nMy father started working at the age of ten to support his entire family. He got noticed by one of his newspaper customers when he was perhaps 12 and was brought in to be the bookkeeper in that man’s office. The man was some kind of a grain merchant in downtown St. Paul. My father worked his way through college and law school at the University of Minnesota.\n\nBerkowitz\n\nReally, your dad went to college.\n\nEdelman\n\nBoth my dad and mom went, yes.\n\nBerkowitz\n\nThat puts you way ahead of the game.\n\nEdelman\n\nWe were not a poor family. My father came from a very poor family but he was ultimately very successful. He did work his way all the way through and support his own family, and certainly bore the scars of someone who has had those kinds of struggles.\n\nHe went to law school with Harold Stassen and he used to tell stories about how they kicked Harold Stassen off the law review, and how Harold Stassen shook his fist at them. I don’t know what Stassen had done that cost him that, maybe he hadn’t done his work or something, but he said, You’ll see, I’m going to be a United States Senator someday, and about ten years later he was Governor.\n\nBerkowitz\n\nIt was all downhill after that.\n\nEdelman\n\nMy father was a successful private practitioner in Minneapolis. My mother came to the university from Grand Rapids, and they met there. She was a very talented musician, and she was a stay-at-home mother. She died very young, died in 1953, and it was a great loss. I went to public school. I went to West High School in Minneapolis. I have a biological sister, biological brother. I put it that way because my father remarried a year after my mother died, and so I have two stepbrothers and two stepsisters as well.\n\nMy sister was widowed early, raised six kids in the Bay Area. My brother is a lawyer in Washington, D.C. Just small salient facts that I think are formative—I started school early and skipped a grade and I think suffered a bit from being slightly maladroit socially and certainly extremely maladroit athletically, which would have been true had I been in my own regular grade, but it was exacerbated.\n\nRiley\n\nNot a hockey player.\n\nEdelman\n\nNo, no, not any kind of a player. Pretty good at ping-pong. For the first six years I was the only Jewish kid in the school, some self-consciousness about that. I tell my students in constitutional law, when we talk about separation of church and state, that they used to have religious training release time during school hours, and those of us who didn’t want to participate stayed back. So there was me and the Unitarian and the atheist. Actually I didn’t mind, but you definitely felt like you were different.\n\nRiley\n\nDid the other students mind?\n\nEdelman\n\nNo, and the three of us enjoyed each other.\n\nBerkowitz\n\nSo that meant that your parents decided to live in a non-Jewish neighborhood?\n\nEdelman\n\nI don’t know why. They did. There’s a substantial Jewish population and indeed, not that far away there were Jewish people. We were across a boundary line. Certainly half a mile away there was a moderate number of Jewish people, but in my school I was the only Jewish kid. I was always the smartest kid in the class and had to find later on that the world had a whole lot of smarter people in it.\n\nI always wanted to run for something and maybe that was to make up for being younger or being a lousy athlete, so I always ran for student offices and things like that.\n\nRiley\n\nSuccessfully?\n\nEdelman\n\nWell, mostly not, but I was president of the All-City Student Council in high school, and I was governor of the Hi-Y model legislature, having lost as governor of Boys’ State at the end of my junior year of high school. Some of my supporters, when we got to the Hi-Y model legislature the next year, just made it happen, and I was quite pleasantly surprised.\n\nBerkowitz\n\nSo when you were a boy, Hubert Humphrey was mayor.\n\nEdelman\n\nNot only was Hubert Humphrey mayor, my father had been a supporter of his and was appointed to his newly formed Human Relations Commission. The minority in Minneapolis were Jews. People of color were not known to people from Minneapolis or St. Paul. There were Native Americans who were what we would now call homeless people, in those days we called them bums and winos. It was a very white place. Carey McWilliams of The Nation once wrote, right about 1946, that Minneapolis, or the Twin Cities, was the capital of anti-Semitism in the country. Everything was separate. There was a whole Jewish economy that was just separate from the larger economy, quite successful but separate from the larger economy. There was a Jewish country club, Jewish downtown, and so on.\n\nSo Humphrey appointed him to that. Now when I was in sixth grade I was the kid—this is in the days long before any modern technology other than streetcars—who he school would send down to city hall, where the board of education was, to pick up the films to show to the students. I’d ride the streetcar down. The school was on the edge of town so it was a long ride down, and I would always go up to Humphrey’s office to see if he was around. Now and again he would be there, and I would be admitted to see him and we would have a little chat.\n\nOnce he was needing to appoint a chief of police and he asked me who he should appoint. I had been reading the paper, or my parents had been reading the paper, and I said, the guy who was the sheriff, a guy named Ed Ryan, and he turned out to appoint that guy, so I was very proud of myself.\n\nRiley\n\nYou mentioned the anti-Semitism. Did you feel that?\n\nEdelman\n\nReally not. The only time I ever remember overtly was that we had, I was about five years old and I was at Jimmy Peller’s house. There was a Catholic school that a lot of the kids in the neighborhood went to, didn’t go to the public school. We were in his driveway, the older kids were playing basketball, and he informed me that the Jews had killed Christ.\n\nI went home and asked my mother. She said, That’s what they teach them at that Catholic school. But literally, that’s the only instance that I remember and really that I know of.\n\nBerkowitz\n\nSo you went to Harvard, right?\n\nEdelman\n\nYes.\n\nBerkowitz\n\nWhat year did you get there?\n\nEdelman\n\nI graduated from high school in 1954. I was 16 when I graduated from high school, and I was the valedictorian of my high school class. As I say, I’d been very involved in student politics. But not elected either president of my class or president of the student council. You want to get into things that I probably would have to tell a therapist about, the difference that all made.\n\nBerkowitz\n\nLike FDR [Franklin Delano Roosevelt] not getting into Porcellian [Club].\n\nEdelman\n\nBut why did I go to Harvard? My father’s law partner was a wonderful man, brilliant man, died much too young, who had been at Nuremberg [war crimes trials]. A man named Sidney Kaplan had been at Nuremberg with Justice [Robert] Jackson as a prosecutor along with Ben Kaplan (not related to Sidney) who became my professor at Harvard Law School and then later Justice on the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts.\n\nMy father and Sidney and his brother, Sheldon, established a law firm together right after World War II. My father had been at a different law firm, and he and Sidney were very close. After my mother died, the woman my father married, they lived about a block from Sidney and his wife Lenore, and he and Sidney went walking every night. It wasn’t enough that they saw each other all day long. They went for a walk every night to talk about what was going on in the office. They were absolutely bound. He was a very acerbic, probing man. He was constantly asking me hard questions, made me very uncomfortable, and he was just my hero.\n\nI knew that he’d gone to Harvard. The only thing I didn’t realize was he hadn’t gone to Harvard College, he’d gone to Harvard Law School. I didn’t know the difference. Harvard recruited, their notion—quite nice—of diversity at the time was geographical, and they really were trying very hard to get students from all over the country. It was a very conscious policy. There was a man named Don Peddie who worked for the Minneapolis newspaper, Star and Tribune, and he was the local recruiter. Somehow I came to his attention and so got a little bit of recruiting and ended up going because Sidney had gone there, except I was wrong. So that was how I happened to—\n\nBerkowitz\n\nYou were recruited, that’s very impressive. You must have been in the minority when you got to Harvard as somebody who’d gone to public school.\n\nEdelman\n\nI think by that time Harvard was probably slightly more public than private. The change was already going on. There were lots of Jews around, certainly not black or—\n\nBerkowitz\n\nDid you have Jewish roommates?\n\nEdelman\n\nYes.\n\nBerkowitz\n\nBecause that was something I think they did, they kind of kept the people together. Certainly awareness of who was Jewish and who—\n\nEdelman\n\nActually, maybe so. I wasn’t aware of that. The freshman year there were four of us, one was not Jewish. Maybe they thought he was. His name was Kraus with a K. Father taught German at GW [George Washington University], and they lived a block away from where I now live. So anyway, I went to Harvard.\n\nBerkowitz\n\nClass of ’58 then.\n\nEdelman\n\nClass of ’58, yes.\n\nRiley\n\nWhat did you study as an undergraduate?\n\nEdelman\n\nEconomics. Is that enough on growing up?\n\nRiley\n\nKent, do you want—\n\nGermany\n\nOne question I had was dealing with what sort of Judaism your family practices.\n\nEdelman\n\nThat question connects up to the present in an important way, so I appreciate your asking that. The family were Conservative, and I was bar mitzvah in a Conservative synagogue. In those days Reform Judaism was no yarmulke and mostly English. We were very derisive about that. If you know anything about what’s happened to Judaism, Reform Judaism has become much more traditional, comparatively speaking. I am a Reform Jew now.\n\nI went to Hebrew school, so going back to that question of why we lived in a place where there were no Jews and my not knowing why, they did send me to Hebrew school. One of the memorable experiences of my life was, they sent a taxicab every day to pick up the people who lived a bit far away. There were four or five of us who rode in that taxicab every day, a pair of twins, a guy with cerebral palsy who could barely talk, he was the sweetest kid. I learned all the dirty jokes, all the ten- and eleven-year-old dirty jokes, could still tell you some of them, in that taxicab.\n\nMore important, I went to Hebrew-speaking camp. For a short period of time I was way, way more observant than my parents were. My mother was totally non-observant, and my father went to synagogue only on high holy days.\n\nBut from college on I was not active religiously. Our children were bar mitzvah, but otherwise I wasn’t active. I wasn’t rejecting anything, I just wasn’t active. But in the late 1980s I got involved with Israel’s policies toward the Palestinians. The first intifada had begun and I was very upset about Israel’s responses to that. Some people reached out to me and I got involved with the American support group for the peace movement in Israel, Shalom Achshav, Peace Now.\n\nI was actually recruited to be the co-chair of the board, which, I must say, made me think they must have been rejected by large numbers of people before they came to me. I’ve been very active on Israel ever since. I’m now the board president of something called the New Israel Fund, which is quite a substantial organization, a $20 million organization that works on social justice issues within Israel, including the status of Arab citizens of Israel. So asking me about our kind of Judaism is actually very connected to who I am now.\n\nGermany\n\nSo early in your life you had a fairly clear sense of Jewish identity, in some ways because of being the only Jewish child in school. Did that persist into Harvard and then beyond? Did you maintain this?\n\nEdelman\n\nIt was inside my head. I was not observant and I was not affiliated from approximately the mid ’50s until the late ’80s. So it was kind of sitting there. I didn’t ever reject anything, I was never mad at anybody about anything. I always identified culturally and historically and ethnically. But it’s been an interesting odyssey, just some sort of sub part if you will.\n\nBerkowitz\n\nYou went to college in ’54, so your senior year of high school was when the Brown [Brown v. Board of Education] decision came out, which everyone is talking about right now. Was that on your map of—?\n\nEdelman\n\nNot much. Sure, I knew about it, in our house we talked about it. We were a Democratic-Farmer-Labor household. But not very politically conscious. My father was very cynical about politicians. He was only moderately close to Humphrey despite the story that I told, and didn’t participate. He had friends who were labor leaders, particularly on the CIO [Congress of Industrial Organizations] side. But organized politics—he didn’t trust those people and he conveyed that.\n\nIn general, consciousness about public issues in the household, yes. My wife, on the other hand, her father passed away a week before the Brown decision came down, and she tells how they waited every week to see if it was coming down. It’s an interesting contrast.\n\nRiley\n\nExactly, exactly. Did you get a sense that your parents had a career path picked out for you?\n\nEdelman\n\nNo. I think it was always assumed that I would go to law school but there was no pressure about anything. I admired my father tremendously and he was a great role model. When I was in college I did a tiny bit of rethinking, but I must say a very tiny bit of rethinking. I discovered literature, American literature, English literature, literature in the English language, and got very enamored of that but not really in a pre-professional way.\n\nBerkowitz\n\nYou were an econ major—\n\nEdelman\n\nYes, and I almost switched out of economics.\n\nBerkowitz\n\nYou know that there’s a quote about President [John F.] Kennedy which said they talked to him about economics and they asked what do you know? And he said, I studied with Russ Nixon so you’d better tell me everything. Was Russ Nixon still there?\n\nEdelman\n\nI didn’t study with Russ Nixon, so I apparently—I could tell you a good Bobby Kennedy story there, but no, I studied with Carl Kaysen and Jim Duesenberry. Alvin Hansen was still alive and I took a course from him. There was Ken [John Kenneth] Galbraith, whom I didn’t respect as much as I should have because the economists all said he wasn’t a real economist, and I was very impressionable. Barbara Ward, Lady Jackson, was around a lot. John Meyer, who’s a pretty well known economist, was my tutor. I studied with very good economists. It was before the quantitative thing had completely captured everything. They spoke in words, that was good.\n\nBerkowitz\n\nBut Alvin Hansen was very closely identified with Keynesianism and that was a big—\n\nEdelman\n\nThe economics I learned was Keynesianism, very much so. So I was very imbued with that. That’s quite right.\n\nBerkowitz\n\nDoesn’t sound like it was the same sort of intellectual epiphany as the English literature. It’s interesting you mentioned that as something—\n\nEdelman\n\nIt was interesting, but right, I wrote my undergraduate thesis on urban renewal in St. Paul, Minnesota. Jim Duesenberry was, among other things, interested in housing so you can see that I wasn’t at the heart of the discipline there. Ed Kuh, who was an economist at MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology], offered to form a group of economists to advise Robert Kennedy. I must have asked him casually one day, Would you be willing to do this? Or maybe we exchanged a note or something, so I formed it. The day came and I sent a letter in to remind him that they were going to actually meet with him. And he wrote me back and on the bottom he put, Peter, help! I got a D in Economics A. So that’s the equivalent—\n\nBerkowitz\n\nThe Russ Nixon story.\n\nEdelman\n\nYes, the Russ Nixon story.\n\nRiley\n\nDid you maintain your interest in student government and politics when you went to Harvard?\n\nEdelman\n\nA little. I ran for what was called the Freshman Smoker Committee. There used to be a beer bust, a beer something or other in the middle of the year to sort of let off steam. There was a committee that organized that and I ran on a slogan of Crudity, Lewdity and Stewedity. I was soundly defeated.\n\nBerkowitz\n\nWas that the 1950s?\n\nEdelman\n\nYes, it was apparently inappropriate for the 1950s.\n\nRiley\n\nAhead of your time.\n\nEdelman\n\nI was just being honest, right? There you go, that was the end of my undergraduate political career.\n\nRiley\n\nBut you made up your mind at that point that you wanted to go to law school.\n\nEdelman\n\nI was just assuming. It was really never much of an issue that I was going to go to law school. My father used to take me around with him to things. If I had a day when I wasn’t in school, sometimes the teachers would be on strike or a vacation day or something like that. I had this vague idea that he stood up and argued and so on, but I didn’t really know what it was. It was just an assumption that I would like it because he did it. And I did. I am the ironic person of being, the way I have done my life, very little of a lawyer, and somebody who actually likes the law. When I’ve occasionally done something law related, I’ve generally enjoyed it. In the late 80s when I had a part-time relationship with a law firm, I did some things that I enjoyed very much, more than when I had full-time practice. So it’s kind of ironic.\n\nBerkowitz\n\nWhat about people you met at Harvard in terms of your lifetime?\n\nEdelman\n\nIt’s a great question because there are so many fabulous people who went to Harvard and friendships with people that you always see. There are more from the law school than the college. One friend who got famous was Erich Segal, not a close friend, but I knew him well enough—\n\nBerkowitz\n\nHe was probably a classics major.\n\nEdelman\n\nHe probably was. I was in London raising money for the New Israel Fund last year, and I went out to see him and his wife. She’s a member of our board there. I went out to see them at their home. But, I must say, mostly people you wouldn’t have heard of. Jared Diamond was in my class, but I don’t know him. Jonathan Kozol was in my class and he’s a very dear friend of mine, but not from then. In fact, we had already become friends and I had to tell him that we were college classmates. So there are people who have done well. John Kramer, who was my colleague at Georgetown, got to be the dean of the Tulane Law School. Anyway, I could go on.\n\nThe law school friends are more like Bernie Nussbaum, a law school classmate of mine whom you interviewed for this project. We’ve stayed close over the years. Some judges, Larry Silberman who was a [Ronald] Reagan appointee, is now the co-chair of some commission, they have so many commissions, one of the latest commissions.\n\nBerkowitz\n\nI see. You got to college in 1954, so you finished college when John F. Kennedy was running for reelection for Senate.\n\nEdelman\n\nYes.\n\nBerkowitz\n\nWere you involved?\n\nEdelman\n\nNo, saw him once or twice in Littauer [then the building of the School of Public Administration], which was then—\n\nBerkowitz\n\nWhat the Kennedy School now—\n\nEdelman\n\nBut no. I didn’t have any particular idea of being involved in politics. I was going to be a lawyer. I got out of law school and was fortunate enough to get a clerkship with Henry Friendly on the Second Circuit who was one of the great Court of Appeals judges. We just had a reunion of his law clerks last week. It’s a very distinguished bunch, have done very well. Then through him I was appointed a clerk for Justice [Felix] Frankfurter who retired from the court three days before I was supposed to go to work for him. He had a stroke in the spring of 1962. He had a rule that you weren’t to come see him, his clerks were picked by people at Harvard, Al Sacks at Harvard.\n\nBerkowitz\n\nContinuing the tradition of him picking clerks for [Louis] Brandeis.\n\nEdelman\n\nYes. So I got a call one day and Al Sacks said, How would like to clerk for Justice Frankfurter? Yes, I think I’d like that, Professor Sacks. You weren’t to go see Justice Frankfurter unless you were in Washington for some other reason. So my then wife and I concocted some reason, and we went to see him, which I was always very grateful for because that was before his stroke. That was the one time I met him, and it was just two hours of very lively conversation.\n\nIn any case, Arthur Goldberg was appointed. The Chief Justice told him he shouldn’t keep Frankfurter’s clerks because anybody Frankfurter would have appointed would be some sort of evil conservative. He apparently looked into my background and that of the other clerk and he chose to keep us.\n\nGermany\n\nDid you have any experience in the labor movement?\n\nEdelman\n\nIn the labor movement, no. I’ve always had good friendships in the labor movement, people more in the CIO tradition if you will, more in the industrial unions, UAW [United Auto Workers] people, now SEIU [Service Employees International Union] people and AFSCME [American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees] people, some of the people around John Sweeney. I was a card-carrying member of the Teamsters when I was in college. I was a warehouseman and I still have a Teamsters union card somewhere in a desk drawer, but not really, no.\n\nWhen you do politics on the Democratic side, you get to know people. Then the Center for Community Change, which I’ve been on the board of for almost 25 years, was founded in Robert Kennedy’s memory by a number of people who had been associated with Walter Reuther. So that became another point of connection.\n\nBerkowitz\n\nYou’ve mentioned this first wife a few times.\n\nEdelman\n\nYes.\n\nBerkowitz\n\nRight after college?\n\nEdelman\n\nShe was the daughter of a federal judge in Chicago, Jewish, named Julius Minor. There was also Julius Hoffman who got famous later on in the Chicago Seven trial. Her father used to call himself Just Julius. She went to Wellesley. I was finished with all my class work and everything in the spring of 1958, and we did a production of Of Thee I Sing in our house—there’s a little thread of liking to appear in public here. So I got cast in the role of Throttlebottom, the Vice President, and she was in the chorus. We had this absolutely red-hot romance and got married a couple of years later. Unfortunately, it was a sad, ultimately sad result. Didn’t have any children and she passed away in 1975, had a lot of personal problems. I’m close to her brother and have stayed in touch with her sister as well, a lovely person. Very funny and charming and delightful, but life was not kind to her. So yes, we got married after my second year in law school, June of 1960.\n\nRiley\n\nAnybody in particular in law school who was especially influential for you?\n\nEdelman\n\nWell, Ben Kaplan, whom I mentioned, on the faculty, was a great influence, and we stayed in touch. I owe him a visit now because his wife passed away and he’s in his 90s. I saw him a couple of years ago. But this is a man who spoke prose that came out of his mouth as though he had edited it for days, absolutely precise sentences, paragraphs, it was the most remarkable thing. Never otherwise. Never any halting, never uh or you know or any of that.\n\nRiley\n\nWhen you spend your time, your life, working on and editing transcripts you recognize how miraculous it is.\n\nEdelman\n\nThat’s right, when you see yourself in a transcript the first time, you go, Oh, my God. That is absolutely right. But it was so unusual, and he was very kind to me as well. Paul Freund, the constitutional scholar, was somebody I got to know pretty well and admired very much. I wrote my third-year paper with him and took his seminar. Albert Sacks, whom I mentioned. Nobody else in particular on the faculty. Lots of people in the student body, particularly the year ahead of me, were people I liked a lot. Phil Heymann remains a friend to this day. You’ll probably interview him. He was the Deputy Attorney General at the beginning of the Clinton administration; he was a year ahead of me. There were a number of others who were good role models.\n\nRiley\n\nWas it a foregone conclusion that you were going to go to Harvard Law rather than someplace else?\n\nEdelman\n\nYes. I applied, the same thing with college. College I applied to Harvard and Yale and the University of Minnesota, not knowing what I was doing, as I said. I applied just to Harvard and Yale. I had done well on the LSATs [Law School Admission Test], and I had good grades, so it was fairly obvious that I would get into Harvard.\n\nBerkowitz\n\nThey had LSATs then, must have been one of the earlier times, among the first years of that.\n\nEdelman\n\nI don’t know, I don’t know the history of the LSAT. I know a lot about it now, but it was required and we took it.\n\nGermany\n\nWe won’t ask you your score.\n\nEdelman\n\nIt was high, it was good. I’m a good test taker. That doesn’t mean I’m smart, that’s a different point as we know.\n\nGermany\n\nWhen did your association with Robert Kennedy begin? Was it through Justice Goldberg?\n\nEdelman\n\nJustice Frankfurter always said to his clerks, Go home. I think that’s good advice. If you look at the history of what happened to his law clerks, some became Washington lawyers, many became academics, but I would bet you that there’s a disproportionate number who went back to their home community because that was his philosophy. Given his own, I suppose, elitism, that might seem like surprising advice, but he did.\n\nWe all heard the story of Ed Prichard who had gone home to Kentucky and been very promising and then got caught on election fraud and went to jail, and got out and was still a leading citizen because, you know, it’s just election fraud. So had I clerked for Frankfurter he probably would have said, Go to Minnesota, and I might have. Goldberg said to me, You know this Kennedy administration is really quite unusual and there won’t be that many like it in your lifetime. You should find a way to work in the administration.\n\nRiley\n\nWhat did he mean by that?\n\nEdelman\n\nIf your politics is on the Democratic side, you can see what he meant by it. It was rather prophetic. But I was thinking Franklin Roosevelt, Harry Truman, even Dwight Eisenhower. What’s he talking about? Onward and upward, American progress, we always have good Presidents now. It’s a long time since Herbert Hoover. But nonetheless I took the advice. I had a military obligation, and I served in the Air National Guard. One of the problems was I didn’t know how long I was going to have to serve. Once I got signed up for that, it was actually eight weeks of basic training and then no more active duty, just having to go to reserve meetings and summer camp.\n\nThere was a new Assistant Attorney General in the civil division named John Douglas, who is still a dear friend, the son of Senator Paul Douglas of Illinois. There was a tradition at that time, a new tradition with the Kennedy period, that Supreme Court law clerks went to be special assistants to either the Deputy AG [Attorney General] or any of the Assistant AGs. Phil Heymann had gone, for example, to Nicholas Katzenbach, my co-clerk David Filvaroff went to Katzenbach, others went to others, Lou Oberdorfer and so on. So Douglas had just been appointed and didn’t have anybody, and I was the only law clerk without a job because of the uncertainty about the military. So somebody put us together and he said, You come whenever, it doesn’t matter.\n\nThat was very nice of him and it turned out I came in a timely way, in September of 1963.\n\nBerkowitz\n\nIt turns out very timely, September of 1963.\n\nEdelman\n\nWell, in a sad, awful way, sure. It wasn’t that Goldberg introduced me to Kennedy. I met Kennedy when I was clerking, not that he would have remembered it.\n\nRiley\n\nBobby or—\n\nEdelman\n\nBobby. JFK [John F. Kennedy] I met once, I think, one of those times in Littauer that I mentioned. I never was in the White House when he was President and otherwise never saw him or talked to him. But Robert Kennedy came to have lunch with the law clerks, who knows when. Sometime in the 1962, ’63 time frame, and I happened to sit next to him. He was talking, quite interesting, articulate, all of that. And I noticed that underneath the table, his hands were just trembling. I thought, What is this about? To some extent I think he was always, in a way, less composed than he appeared.\n\nBerkowitz\n\nHe was just really fidgety though, wasn’t he? As his brother was too.\n\nEdelman\n\nYes, he was rather fidgety. But I think he was actually a little intimidated by all these people who finished first in their class or high in their class at all these prestigious law schools. At least that was my theory at the time.\n\nI then went to work for John Douglas, that was fabulous—\n\nRiley\n\nCan I interrupt and ask you, were there any cases particularly noteworthy during your time at the Supreme Court?\n\nEdelman\n\nGideon v. Wainwright was decided that term and there was a habeas corpus case that was quite important. You know, we were the rookies so we didn’t get great stuff to do. The first opinion that I worked on had to do with when television stations bought old films to show late at night. The practice at the time was that the movie companies did what was called tie-in sales, which meant that in order to get Casablanca you had to also buy some turkey.\n\nRiley\n\nSome old Ronald Reagan movie?\n\nBerkowitz\n\nWhich is a continuation of their block booking practices that had previously been outlawed in film distribution.\n\nEdelman\n\nYes, right, but they were continuing. So we outlawed it as a matter of antitrust law for the selling to television. That was the first opinion I worked on. Otherwise I worked on a case that involved whether you could lose your citizenship for leaving the country to avoid the draft, which was quite significant. There were two cases together. One of them involved a man who’d gone to live in Prague, and Marian [Wright Edelman] and I looked him up in 1968 when we went to Prague. He wasn’t very grateful. We had saved his citizenship, but he was still subject to prosecution if he came back to the United States. Somehow he didn’t think we had done as much as he needed.\n\nIn terms of some of the cases later on, Goldberg wrote a dissenting opinion to a refusal to grant certiorari in a capital punishment case, where he questioned capital punishment. He wrote a famous concurring opinion in Griswold v. Connecticut, the contraceptive case. He wrote an important concurring opinion in New York Times v. Sullivan. These things all happened in the subsequent two terms that he was on the Court.\n\nRiley\n\nTwo other questions about that. One, is there anything about your time at the Court, any kinds of relationship observations that you made among the Justices that—\n\nEdelman\n\nFirst of all, my relationship with Justice Goldberg was wonderful. It was so different from—I know it’s not the question you’re asking, it was so different from the relationship with Judge Friendly. Judge Friendly was a very formal man and he did like me, he especially liked my then wife, who was absolutely charming. But he was very stern, didn’t smile very much. He would ask you a question, and you got one chance to answer. If he didn’t like your answer, he was on to something else, no amendments. Robert Kennedy had the same quality, oddly enough.\n\nGoldberg was this warm, effusive person. Anybody who had anything to do with him was invited to his home. Actually, Judge Friendly did invite us to his home for dinner, so that was not different, but Passover Seder was a cast of 30 or 40 people at Justice Goldberg’s house. Once we were in the middle of something and I said, Oh, my God, I’ve got a dentist appointment. He said, That’s right, that’s what you should do. You need to go to the dentist.\n\nBerkowitz\n\nSounds like you got to know him a little bit. There’s this book about Goldberg now, that David Stebenne wrote. I’m just curious.\n\nEdelman\n\nYou mean the terrible biography?\n\nBerkowitz\n\nYes, it’s not very good. This is an off-the-wall question. Was Goldberg on the phone to Willard Wirtz or Ted Sorensen or the United Steel Workers when he was a Supreme Court Justice?\n\nEdelman\n\nHe was on the phone, of course. I don’t know who he was on the phone with, but he kept his hand in, there’s no question about it. He was probably on the phone to the President. Whatever it was, he was not sealed off, and maybe spoke to people like the ones you’ve mentioned. You could ask Willard Wirtz, he’s still alive. I had dinner with him two weeks ago, quite wonderful.\n\nAnyway, he became a friend for life, and I ran the issues in his campaign for Governor in 1970 if you want to get to that. So we had a wonderful relationship. I got very exasperated with him later on, but that’s the later part of the story.\n\nAs far as the Court then is concerned, Justice Goldberg was very close to Justice [William] Brennan, and they were in and out of each other’s chambers all the time. The other Justice I got to know on a personal level was Justice Brennan. Justice Goldberg would send me or his other clerk by to work with Justice Brennan now and then on some opinion. The chambers were very collaborative, and they became dear friends.\n\nI couldn’t tell you then who didn’t speak to whom. People didn’t like Justice [William] Douglas very much, he was kind of a mean man. There was a story about him, which Goldberg told me although Douglas was a friend of his. During the war, he sublet an apartment to Justice Douglas. Goldberg was in the OSS [Office of Strategic Services], and he had this apartment—I don’t know where his wife Dorothy was, maybe back in Chicago. But he had this Washington apartment, and there was a man who was the concierge or valet for everybody, took their dry cleaning in. A black man who, whether he was self-appointed, whatever. So Goldberg came back from overseas, and he resumed living in the apartment. Goldberg said, Sam, how was it having Justice Douglas here? Sam looked at him and said, Well, Mr. Goldberg, he may be a great fellow for the common man, but he sure wasn’t a great fellow for this common man. [laughter] Douglas was not well liked.\n\nBerkowitz\n\nAnother guy with Kennedy connections by the way. With the old man.\n\nEdelman\n\nJustice [John] Harlan was a prince, everyone loved him. I just happened to talk to a couple of guys the other day who had clerked for him. Just a courtly, sweet man.\n\nGoldberg did not have a lot of respect for [Earl] Warren’s intelligence. He would go to see Warren. Goldberg immediately took on a role that was consistent with his labor history, his history as a mediator. He had a genius for figuring out what would bring people together. There was a water dispute, Arizona v. California, during the year I clerked. The Justices were just all over the lot and nobody agreed on anything. It was original jurisdiction, one of the rare cases, under the Constitution, where you can have this dispute between states and you start in the Supreme Court.\n\nGoldberg went around and saw everybody and figured out what the common threads were, what would knit together a majority in that. Well, fairly often he would go to see the Chief with some proposition or another that he thought was the rationale to decide a case, or the way to bring people together. Many of those times he would come back quite frustrated, and he used to speak pejoratively about the Chief’s intelligence.\n\nRiley\n\nThat’s interesting, because at least from the outside, and I’m somebody who doesn’t study the courts, but one of Warren’s strong suits was as a political figure on the Court.\n\nEdelman\n\nRight. Certainly the story of Brown v. Board of Education, although that’s heavily a Frankfurter story, too. But in any case, that year, that was Goldberg’s experience with the Chief.\n\nRiley\n\nThe other question I wanted to ask you, if you know about it, is his departure from the Court.\n\nEdelman\n\nI know his story, which I’m going to tell you—\n\nBerkowitz\n\nIt was ’65?\n\nEdelman\n\nYes. Adlai Stevenson died in the summer of 1965. It’s a story that ought to be on the record. There’s a dispute among Goldberg’s ex-clerks, and I can’t remember who falls on which side, but it’s a short list and includes Justice [Stephen] Breyer and Alan Dershowitz. Some of his ex-clerks think that he was bored on the Court and that he was happy to get out of there. I never saw that. I always thought the Court was his life’s dream. Here’s the story, which is factual as far as it goes.\n\nFor whatever reason, I was out walking on First Street Northeast between what is now the Dirksen Building and the Supreme Court, right by the Methodist Building, which is on the corner of Maryland and First. And I ran into him. It was about 2 o’clock in the afternoon and I don’t know why, maybe I hadn’t had lunch, maybe I was just walking to clear my head, and there he was. It had been announced in the paper that he was going to be appointed the UN [United Nations] Ambassador. I said, Mr. Justice, what is this all about?\n\nHe said, Well, Peter, Mrs. Kurgans—that was Dorothy Goldberg’s mother, who was in the hospital dying— and I was there with Dorothy, and President [Lyndon] Johnson started to call me up and he said to me, ‘Arthur, who should I make the UN Ambassador?’ I said to him this and that one, and on every one of them he gave me some reason as to why that wasn’t the right one, and finally he said, ‘Arthur, it’s you.’\n\nGoldberg said to me, I didn’t want to do that. I said, ‘Mr. President, no, no, no, I’m happy on the Court.’ He said, ‘Arthur, your country needs you. You’re the only one who can make peace.’ Ego. The man did have a big ego. ‘You’re the only one who can make peace.’ Of course we know what Johnson did with that, sent him on that bogus trip all around the world at the end of 1965.\n\nSo that was the ego part. Then he said, Your country needs you. Goldberg was an immigrant. I think he was himself an immigrant, maybe the son of immigrants. But in any case, Johnson always knew how you got somebody. He appealed to ego, he appealed to patriotism, and he got him. That’s the story he told me. Now, does that mean the other people are wrong who said he was bored on the Court? Well, maybe there’s some of that. Maybe he was a little gettable. But that is the story. And it was too bad, it ruined him. He got a lot of public attention as UN Ambassador. In fact came to realize he was being used, broke with Johnson internally, would never say it publicly. Gave Johnson a lot of trouble in late 1967 and into 1968 and finally resigned. Didn’t say why he was resigning, but he resigned because he disagreed with Johnson’s policy on the war. After that he was really never the same.\n\nHe started with Paul, Weiss and then he ran for Governor very unsuccessfully, a horrible candidate for Governor.\n\nBerkowitz\n\nI remember that, he was very bad on television in that campaign.\n\nEdelman\n\nOh, I could tell you, if you want, I could tell you stories. [Jimmy] Carter sent him to be the delegate to some kind of East-West talks in Belgrade. He was totally underutilized for basically the last 20 years of his life.\n\nRiley\n\nI read something in relation to this that indicated he may have felt that he was going to get reappointed to the Court.\n\nEdelman\n\nI think so. I have no evidence on that and in this project you may or may not find somebody who knows, but it was always my view that there was a deal when he left the Court. There was a deal that he would be reappointed and indeed that he would be appointed Chief Justice, that Chief Justice Warren was going to go and then they would appoint Goldberg. And it makes it all the more to his enormous credit that when he broke with Johnson he lost his change to get back on the Court. If there was a deal, of course, part of it was that it was a way for Johnson to keep a hold on him. So it would have been, whether Johnson intended it or not, it would have been a brilliant thing for Johnson to do. Don’t give me trouble here, Arthur, because I’ve got this hold over you. But he gave that up when he broke with Johnson. That’s always been my opinion, that there was such a deal.\n\nGermany\n\nDid he break with Johnson before the [Abe] Fortas affair?\n\nEdelman\n\nOh, yes. The Fortas thing happened, let’s see, Fortas gets appointed Chief Justice in—well, anyway, it’s in the same time frame, but I’m sure it’s before that.\n\nRiley\n\nCan we take a two- or three-minute break here?\n\nEdelman\n\nAre we doing all right?\n\nRiley\n\nWe’re doing great, thank you. I’m trying to keep you fresh. We have a long day ahead of us.\n\nEdelman\n\nI’m happy. You tell me if I’m going off into tangents.\n\nRiley\n\nNot at all, we’re budgeted to spend a good deal of time on this because I think it’s important for people to know what your roots are when you come.\n\nBerkowitz\n\nThere is a whole series of LBJ recorded conversations about the Goldberg UN appointment.\n\nEdelman\n\nIs that right? What does he say?\n\nBerkowitz\n\nI haven’t listened to them.\n\nGermany\n\nThey’re here, right?\n\nBerkowitz\n\nYes.\n\nGermany\n\nBecause he belittled people a lot, right? Sometimes directly, he would make fun of them, no?\n\nBerkowitz\n\nIt depends.\n\nEdelman\n\nIf they were capable of handling being belittled.\n\nGermany\n\nI don’t mean directly.\n\nBerkowitz\n\nOh, yeah.\n\nRiley\n\nEd, you wanted to start some questioning?\n\nBerkowitz\n\nJust wanted to get back to your relationship with Robert Kennedy if we’ve got the time. We know, for example, that Robert Kennedy was Attorney General in 1963 and he ran for Senator in 1964. So when do you come into the picture?\n\nEdelman\n\nI come into the picture in the sense of being in the right place at the right time, the beginning of September 1964. I was trying to figure out what to do with my life. I’d taken a job with Cleary Gottlieb [Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton] on Wall Street, and I was slated to begin in November of 1964. My idea had been that my then wife and I would travel in Europe in the fall of ’64, just to have a nice two-month break. But I got intrigued by the idea of being involved in a political campaign that fall, and first I tried to get involved in Hubert Humphrey’s campaign for Vice President.\n\nOn a plane I had run into Don Fraser, the Congressman from Minneapolis, and his father had been my father’s law school dean. I knew Don slightly and actually had Don come speak at my school when I was 11 years old. He was a city councilman then. So I knew him a little, he’s become a good friend since. He said, I think about the best I can do for you is get you involved as an advance man. If you’d like to do that, I’ll get back to you. Then he didn’t get back to me, and I was deeply offended. I was young, not understanding how these things work.\n\nMeanwhile, Kennedy decided to run for the Senate so I said to John Douglas, Do you think I could get involved in the campaign? Adam Walinsky was around in the Justice Department at the same time and he and I had clerked together on the Second Circuit. We knew each other, and John became his rabbi if you will about getting the two of us in the campaign. Even that was difficult because the people in the campaign were saying, What do those two know? and What do we need anybody else for anyway? and so on. At the time it seemed like an eternity but it took two or three weeks before John was able to sell the powers-that-be in the campaign that Walinsky and I would be useful.\n\nSo I was assigned to Bill vanden Heuvel, the chief issues person on the research side, and Adam was assigned to Milt Gwirtzman, the chief speechwriter. That was right. Adam was and is just a brilliant writer. Got a screw or two loose in other respects, but he’s a brilliant writer. So that’s how I got involved in the campaign. It wasn’t from any personal contact with Kennedy. It was all arranged in a way that maybe Kennedy said yes to it but not to my face and he didn’t interview me or anything like that.\n\nBerkowitz\n\nAnd the powers-that-be that you talked about, they sound like they’re JFK people too. Was that the—\n\nEdelman\n\nThe powers-that-be would have been Steve Smith mainly—\n\nBerkowitz\n\nBrother-in-law.\n\nEdelman\n\nBrother-in-law, and maybe Peter Straus, who I always thought was more of a figurehead, but he was nominally the chair of the campaign, married to a member of the [Arthur] Sulzberger family and owned a radio station at the time. He’s still around, she died. Not sure who else.\n\nBerkowitz\n\nSo a combination of New York and Kennedy people.\n\nEdelman\n\nYes, precisely.\n\nBerkowitz\n\nNew York is a new project really, even though they had lived there as a family.\n\nEdelman\n\nYes. The campaign certainly was a combination of New York and Kennedy people. In terms of who would have decided to hire Adam and me, I don’t exactly know, but your statement is precisely right. So they had, for example, Al Blumenthal who was a state assemblyman, who has since passed away. Jerry Kretchmer—these are the West Side people—who was a state assemblyman who now owns restaurants. Ronnie Eldridge who is now married to Jimmy Breslin, the journalist, she was on the city council for some time, may still be. These were the New York types. Joe Crangle from Buffalo they got to know quite well. Quite a long list. John Burns became the state chairman later on from upstate. Then, you know, lots of Ted Sorensen types, ex-JFK people—\n\nBerkowitz\n\nWho were in pretty bad shape too after that, weren’t they? That’s always struck me that these were people who were running the world and then all of a sudden, one afternoon, they’re not running the world. A lot of them seemed to have a sort of depression, as opposed to Bobby.\n\nEdelman\n\nWhen RFK died, [McGeorge] Mac Bundy gave about eight senior members of Bobby’s staff, including me, a year of Ford Foundation support. He said he was doing that because nobody had done that for the JFK people when JFK died, and some of them had a difficult time. Anytime you finish, having been at that level and so on, there’s an adjustment.\n\nBob Wood, for whom I worked, who had been the Undersecretary and briefly the Secretary of HUD [Department of Housing and Urban Development], there’s a story that they tell in their family about how he drives up in the chauffeur-driven car for the last time to the driveway at their house on Lowell Street, in Cleveland Park in Washington, and his daughter leans out the window and says, Hello, Mr. Nobody. So it’s difficult in any case, but I think, yes, they must have had a particularly—I mean, such a horrible shock.\n\nRiley\n\nWhere were you?\n\nEdelman\n\nThe day JFK was murdered? I had had lunch with my friend Tim Dyk, we were both in the Justice Department. He had clerked for the Chief when I clerked for Goldberg. He’s my college and law school classmate. He’s now a judge of the federal circuit so we go back a long way. I spoke at his investiture. He was a very successful lawyer in private practice for a long time. I’d had lunch with him, and we came back to the Justice Department and someone told us what had happened. We left and went to his house. At the time he was married to William L. Shirer’s daughter, so he and his wife and my wife and I just sat in front of the television at his house. We all know where we were.\n\nBerkowitz\n\nDid you go to the Capitol?\n\nEdelman\n\nI was in the Air National Guard. I did go to the Capitol, but I was called up for the day and was assigned to be by the side of the road to help keep order in my little green fatigues. I was also a security person at the march on Washington in August of 1963. So talk about being a fly on the wall.\n\nGermany\n\nWhat are your impressions of the transition within the Justice Department from Kennedy to Johnson’s administration?\n\nEdelman\n\nNot much. My impression is basically one of continuity, just about total continuity. LBJ left Bobby alone, Bobby left the department alone. He wasn’t there for quite a considerable period of time. I think I saw him once. Bobby had a way of roaming the halls and sticking his head into people’s offices, line attorneys, and saying, What are you working on?\n\nGermany\n\nThat’s pretty frightening.\n\nEdelman\n\nBut he learned a huge amount that way. It was a great thing to do. That stopped, of course, in November of 1963. He also had a tradition of having the younger lawyers who had just been hired come up to his office in groups to talk to him.\n\nGermany\n\nWas Katzenbach more in charge of actual day-to-day operations?\n\nEdelman\n\nOn a day-to-day basis. And you have this very strong cast of characters. By then I think John Doar in the Civil Rights Division, I think Burke [Marshall] had gone by then. Lou Oberdorfer, whom I mentioned before, in Tax, Ramsey Clark in Lands as it was called then, Jack Miller in Criminal, John Douglas in Civil. Antitrust I think by then may have been Don Turner, I think Lee Loevinger was gone. Bill Orrick was there, too. Bill Orrick was Civil and was replaced by John Douglas. So these were probably as strong a cast of Assistant Attorneys General as there has ever been in the history of the country. They were all very bright, very accomplished, very distinguished people. What I saw was complete continuity. No change whatsoever. I was sitting with the Assistant Attorney General, so it was not that I was a kid and totally unaware. I wasn’t just a line attorney. As far as I could tell the decision-making was entirely within the department.\n\nBerkowitz\n\nWhen did Bobby quit?\n\nEdelman\n\nSeptember of 1964.\n\nGermany\n\nYou started working for the campaign when?\n\nEdelman\n\nSeptember of 1964. Remember, I said, it seemed like an eternity, but it took about—\n\nGermany\n\nThe transition was later then in some ways. You were gone by the time of the transition.\n\nEdelman:\n\nKennedy to Johnson said to me JFK to LBJ, that’s the way I heard that question. In terms of when RFK is out of the way, what that means in terms of Johnson having more sway, yes, that’s later.\n\nRiley\n\nThe Robert Kennedy election was, I’m rusty on my ’60s history, it was in ’64, so he didn’t quit until September for a November election.\n\nEdelman\n\nCorrect.\n\nGermany\n\nYou remember that he spoke in Atlantic City where the Democratic convention was in ’64, got that huge ovation with Senator [Henry] Scoop Jackson in the background—\n\nRiley\n\nWere you at the convention?\n\nEdelman\n\nNo.\n\nGermany\n\nThen he ran that fall.\n\nEdelman\n\nRight.\n\nGermany\n\nAnd you start in September.\n\nEdelman\n\nI started in September. He may have quit in late August, I’m not sure.\n\nRiley\n\nBut the interval was very small.\n\nEdelman\n\nVery short, and I was there almost from the beginning of the campaign. They’d probably been there three weeks or so.\n\nRiley\n\nIt’s striking on sensibilities today, as long as campaigns are now.\n\nBerkowitz\n\nThe other thing, I think, and you can correct me, he was sort of in play for Vice President at the time.\n\nEdelman\n\nOh, no, that was over a lot earlier. You remember when Johnson said, late spring, early summer, I’m not going to have anybody in my Cabinet as my Vice President. That’s earlier.\n\nBerkowitz\n\nThat’s one of the reasons he stayed as Attorney General, didn’t he? Or he couldn’t think of anything better to do with himself.\n\nEdelman\n\nI don’t know. He stayed from November ’63—Part of it was just that he was in shock. I suppose he could have quit, I don’t know.\n\nGermany\n\nSo when were you first in his presence then in this—?\n\nEdelman\n\nIn the campaign, I’m producing these little memos on this or that, which, once they’re vetted a little bit, are going to be handed to the speechwriters to use.\n\nRiley\n\nThis is issue based.\n\nEdelman\n\nYes, I’m an issue guy, I’m a policy wonk.\n\nRiley\n\nBefore there were policy wonks.\n\nEdelman\n\nOh, I’m one of the nation’s first opposition researchers, which is the real story here.\n\nRiley\n\nOkay, do tell.\n\nEdelman\n\nBecause they got Bill Haddad, I don’t know if you know who that is, who had been the Inspector General in the Peace Corps, he was very close to Sarge [Sargent Shriver] and had run unsuccessfully against Leonard Farbstein in a Democratic primary for a congressional seat that year. He had been set up with a guy named Bob Clampitt in an opposition research operation. They were in a different building and nobody could tell what the hell they were producing and nobody exactly— Robert Kennedy once said to me, If you trust everything that Bill Haddad produces for you and you don’t double check it, you’ll wind up in jail.\n\nSo Haddad had this whole operation, nobody even knew how many people he had or what they were doing and so on. So John Douglas came to me one day. He was popping up, kind of being an ombudsman, checking on things. He said, We don’t know what we’re getting and we’ve got to do something about [Ken] Keating. So I went to the Congressional Quarterly and I produced the material for an ad that became Keating versus Keating. It was a full-page New York Times ad. John Douglas and I and maybe Joe Dolan was involved, we wrote that ourselves. Keating as an upstate member of Congress against Keating as Senator, the point being that he had made himself into a more liberal person for political reasons.\n\nGermany\n\nHe was also dean of the Industrial Relations School at Cornell. I assume he had that background of being—\n\nEdelman\n\nIf he had been it was either way, way before, or you might have it confused, maybe later.\n\nGermany\n\nI’m sure Goldberg would have known. They were in similar kind of labor circles, labor mediation, that kind of thing.\n\nEdelman\n\nMaybe so. In any case, there was inconsistency, which may have been simply because he was now a statewide figure instead of a Congressman. So we had this ad, Keating versus Keating and all these inconsistencies. It had a big bang because Ken Keating was regarded as a liberal exactly like [Jacob] Javits. Fresh from our huge success, we did what we called the box score ad that had Humphrey, Javits, Keating, [Barry] Goldwater. It showed that Humphrey and Javits had voted the same or taken the same position on a whole bunch of things, and that Keating and Goldwater were exactly the same on a whole bunch of things.\n\nMeanwhile, Bill Haddad is going crazy. Who’s producing this stuff? Where is this coming from? Then I produced a thing that was like a Rube Goldberg thing. It was one of the two ads, it must have been the second one, and then it had all these flaps on it. So in this one prop I had the total knowledge that I had about Keating’s bad record. They would summon me whenever Kennedy was going to have a press appearance where he might be asked about Keating’s record. I would put it on a bed in the Hotel Carlyle and I would point stuff out to him. I would use my prop. That’s how I started to spend time with him.\n\nRiley\n\nWas this all self-generated, you weren’t relying on a template of somebody else’s—?\n\nEdelman\n\nNo, I made it up. John Douglas was sort of there with me, popping in and out.\n\nBerkowitz\n\nWe were talking about biographies before. You said the one about Arthur Goldberg was bad. Surely the one about Bobby Kennedy is pretty good then, Arthur Schlesinger. He talks about how listless Kennedy was. Did you find that to be the case?\n\nEdelman\n\nFor a variety of reasons, which no one can know completely, he wasn’t a good candidate. Whether he was worried about living up to his brother, whether he was just a back-room guy who was uncomfortable being out in front, he just wasn’t very good at it. It seemed like he was campaigning on the basis of being his brother’s brother, but he was embarrassed about doing that. So there was a lot of stuff going on that didn’t quite work.\n\nRiley\n\nWas he shy?\n\nEdelman\n\nHe was. That’s another fact about him. He was a very shy person. It was odd, because publicly he could be very aggressive and in fact, probably some of the extra aggressiveness was because he was making such an effort to make up for his shyness. That’s a very important point.\n\nThere came a time, it’s got to be in all the books. There are two things actually. It must be in mid-October. He liked Keating, that was part of the problem, he didn’t really feel comfortable attacking him. Keating accused him of mishandling the Interhandel case. Interhandel was the General Aniline and Dye, it was the U.S. takeover of the assets of this, IG Farben and all that kind of thing. These German companies that had assisted the Nazi war effort in one way or another. I couldn’t tell you the exact thing, but it was called Interhandel and it had something to do with General Aniline and Dye and with IG Farben.\n\nLloyd Cutler had been appointed to be the lawyer for the process of somehow deciding what to do with the assets. Some kind of deal had been made to sell the assets or move them through bankruptcy for some renovated entity to emerge. Keating accused Kennedy of mishandling it and it just pissed him off. So that was a very important energizing fact. At that time there was a fair campaign practices committee headed by [Edwin] Palmer Hoyt, the then editor of the Denver Post, and we filed a complaint with them. So that was one of the things that lit a fire under him.\n\nThe other thing was, he went to Columbia to meet with a bunch of students. They were giving him a very hard time about this or that, and he sort of woke up and gave it back to them. It was filmed and pieces of that were used. I think the whole thing might have even been rebroadcast, we might have bought time. But those two events really, as I recall it, energized him. Meanwhile, he was just acquiring experience going out and talking before crowds.\n\nRiley\n\nHe’s still a very young man at this point.\n\nEdelman\n\nYes, he was not 40.\n\nGermany\n\nDid you travel with him?\n\nEdelman\n\nIn the campaign?\n\nGermany\n\nYes.\n\nEdelman\n\nNo.\n\nGermany\n\nSo you worked in the city.\n\nEdelman\n\nI worked at the Chatham Hotel on East 48th Street, which of course does not exist anymore. When I saw him was when I was directed by somebody or other to go to the Carlyle Hotel and meet with him and show him my—\n\nGermany\n\nHe lived in the Carlyle, that’s where his—\n\nEdelman\n\nYes.\n\nGermany\n\nThat’s a family thing too, huh?\n\nEdelman\n\nYes, he lived in the Carlyle.\n\nGermany\n\nI see.\n\nEdelman\n\nHe had that place out in Long Island that was a rented house, which is what was publicized. But he actually stayed in the Carlyle.\n\nGermany\n\nDid you talk about the carpetbagger issue a lot with him, how you’re going to handle it?\n\nEdelman\n\nI’m a kid.\n\nGermany\n\nSo you’re just—\n\nEdelman\n\nMy job is—\n\nGermany\n\nBecause as I recall that was the main thing that was going on.\n\nEdelman\n\nIt was a big thing that was going on but, no, my job is Senator, you’ve got a debate coming, or a press appearance coming, here’s the stuff that you have to have in mind about Keating. For whatever reason, he wanted it face to face, he didn’t want a memo. Apparently he liked the way I did it the first time, so I got to go back and do it over and over again.\n\nRiley\n\nSo how quickly after the election are you approached about—\n\nEdelman\n\nThey say to me after the election, Stay in touch, maybe the Senator-elect would be interested in hiring you. I go off with my then wife to Acapulco, come back in a couple of weeks and I’m directed to call Ed Guthman, who had been his press secretary in the Justice Department. Ed Guthman says, Can you come to Washington? Whatever he called him would like to see you.\n\nThis interview takes place at the White House. Why at the White House? Because Kennedy has hurt his knee playing touch football, so he goes to White House Physician Janet Travell, who had been President Kennedy’s physician, to have her look at his knee. We walk in together at that side entrance between the Old Executive Office Building and the White House and she bangs around on his knee, gets done with that. We walk out and he perches himself on the fender of a car that’s parked there.\n\nBerkowitz\n\nWe’re talking about that alleyway, that driveway between the two of them?\n\nEdelman\n\nYes.\n\nRiley\n\nExecutive Avenue.\n\nEdelman\n\nSo I’m ready, he’s going to ask me what books I’ve read lately, what are my strengths and weaknesses. All he says is, You going to go to work for me? I said, How much are you going to pay me? That’s the only thing I could think of to say. He said, You can work that out with Ed here. I said, Oh, well, I have this problem. I’m three and a half years out of law school and I haven’t practiced law. He says, I had that problem and I worked it out.\n\nBerkowitz\n\nBecame Attorney General. [laughter]\n\nEdelman\n\nSo that was it. Then I was working for him. Although I didn’t see him a lot between then and when we started in January. I saw him some. I did travel with him upstate, he went around to thank people and I went along, but I don’t have a lot of recollection of what happened between—that was, say a month or so.\n\nRiley\n\nYou did mention when we chatted earlier that you’ve done an oral history for Bobby Kennedy, so—\n\nEdelman\n\nYes.\n\nRiley\n\nSo if we hit the high points here we’re not—\n\nEdelman\n\nSure, whatever you like.\n\nBerkowitz\n\nI’m just curious about the—that’s typical that the money stuff, that none of them know about money, but they also used to pay more, that’s the rumor—\n\nEdelman\n\nPay what?\n\nBerkowitz\n\nPay more than the other people on the Hill, like the other Senator Edward Kennedy’s staff so, maybe, I don’t know where that money came from, the family or—\n\nEdelman\n\nYes, but not a lot. I think we got a couple of thousand more than the salary. I mean nothing, very small. Then when he would get royalties from something that he wrote that one of us had helped on he would give those to us or share those. In any case, supplement it in that way. We didn’t have any complaint about it, we thought it was fine, but it wasn’t as though it was some massive subvention.\n\nRiley\n\nWhat was your portfolio in the Senate office?\n\nEdelman\n\nEverything that wasn’t Adam’s, or Adam’s was everything that wasn’t mine. Adam was more foreign policy, I was more domestic. Adam was more speechwriter and I was more issues. Things that involved legislative hearings I was more likely to handle. Managing floor statements, things that went on on the floor, I was relatively more likely to handle. But Adam did a lot of work on education and some of the poverty work. I had a long, long list of things. I had agriculture, transportation, veterans. One of the first things that happened was Johnson tried to close down three veterans’ hospitals. That’s where I cut my teeth. We conducted a huge fight, a rather nasty fight, where we screamed at the poor veterans administrator who was just being told by Johnson what to do. He didn’t care what hospitals got closed. He was a nice man. I think he was actually probably a pro-Kennedy person. As time passed, the plurality of my work was about poverty and race.\n\nGermany\n\nWhat kind of relationship did you have with Larry O’Brien and Mike Manatos?\n\nBerkowitz\n\nWho was working for the White House—\n\nEdelman\n\nMike Manatos I don’t think I ever met. Larry O’Brien, not much. Kenny O’Donnell we used to see a lot. I knew Kenny pretty well.\n\nGermany\n\nThe impression that Larry O’Brien really did get, he worked for Johnson, which was anathema for—\n\nEdelman\n\nYes, so he was sort of out of the picture. I don’t know if Bobby talked to him, but my sense is that Bobby thought he’d gone over to the other side.\n\nBerkowitz\n\nBy 1965 it’s already pretty clear there are two sides, right?\n\nEdelman\n\nOh, you bet, very quickly. The relationship with Sarge was very uncomfortable for that reason. I’ve come to love Sarge in later years, but the impression I had of Sarge while I was working for Bobby was that Sarge was pursuing his own agenda, in business for himself, that kind of thing, not really loyal to the family.\n\nGermany\n\nSo you think that Johnson’s Congressional Liaison staff didn’t work closely with Kennedy’s Liaison staff because of the so-called feud between the two, or was it a more party—\n\nEdelman\n\nI don’t know. The relationships that we had in the White House were—Joe Califano was one I talked to fairly frequently, not every day but now and then. When Johnson established the Urban Institute, I think in 1968, for reasons that I didn’t understand and still don’t, Joe Califano called to tell me to tell the Senator they were doing that. I guess it was because they were worried that we had been so critical of Johnson on urban policy. So we didn’t have a lot of relations. Bill Moyers from time to time.\n\nBerkowitz\n\nBill Haddad was chief of the Office of Inspection of the OEO [Office of Economic Opportunity], did you have relations with him? He was there briefly. Did things carry over from the campaign?\n\nEdelman\n\nHe was gone by then. That was before the ’64 campaign, I believe. Does he come back?\n\nBerkowitz\n\nI’m not sure of the chronology. He’s only there briefly.\n\nEdelman\n\nBill’s a friend of mine. I don’t remember working particularly with him during those years. No, mostly we didn’t have a lot to do with the Johnson White House. We had relationships in the Executive Branch, some of them were ex-JFK people who were still there, who revered JFK’s memory or wanted Bobby to be President. There was a guy named Jim Thornton who was just a middle-level bureaucrat in USDA [United States Department of Agriculture] who—Orville Freeman and Bobby had a good continuing relationship, but I don’t know whether this guy was doing it on his own or because Freeman told him to. He called up and said to me, as the agriculture expert, I’d like to get the Senator involved in some agricultural issues in New York state, and I’d like to take you, Peter, on a tour to show you some rural poverty and some farm-related issues.\n\nSo Jim Thornton and I went in a small puddle-jumper plane. It was all connected to the Ag [Agriculture] School at Cornell too, they were in this play somewhere. Maybe they had put him up to it because they wanted to have a good relationship with our office. But I learned about chicken shit. It turns out it’s like pig shit. It’s very difficult to dispose of. There had been some kind of building that had been absolutely filled with chicken shit and the wall had collapsed and this was in the Catskills. It was right near Grossinger’s [Grossinger Golf and Country Club] and all the big hotels in the Catskills. And this putrid smell of chicken shit had crossed the countryside and all of the tourists were appalled, What’s that smell? So it was very important for the government to invest some money in figuring out a way to transform chicken shit into something else so that there wouldn’t be this problem anymore.\n\nWe went and we looked at that on our tour. But I remember the first time I ever smelled poverty. There’s a certain smell that’s associated with poverty because people live in a house that’s rotted and there’s a lot of mildew. I remember walking into a house somewhere upstate, and I had never smelled that smell before. You could see the space between the floorboards, you could see the dirt, you could see space on the walls, and this was just shocking to me. A brand-new experience for me.\n\nGermany\n\nOf course that became your issue, certainly his issue. Did you say you went to Mississippi with him? Were you involved in all that?\n\nEdelman\n\nYes, that’s how I met my wife.\n\nGermany\n\nWhat year was that, ’67?\n\nBerkowitz\n\nApril ’67.\n\nEdelman\n\nYes, the first big thing we did, because the Thornton thing is about the relations with the Johnson administration, except I love the chicken shit story.\n\nBerkowitz\n\nJohnson always liked to say he knew the difference between chicken shit and chicken salad.\n\nEdelman\n\nYes, well, we did too. We just didn’t flaunt it. One thing I did early on was in November of ’65. Kennedy was on his way to Latin America and, because I was being left behind, he asked me to go with him to Los Angeles. He was giving a speech at the Commonwealth Club in LA. So he just asked me to go with him, he didn’t really need me to go with him.\n\nBerkowitz\n\nCommonwealth Club in LA, not San Francisco.\n\nEdelman\n\nNo, definitely LA. Maybe it’s something else, maybe it’s not called the Commonwealth Club, but it was definitely LA because we went to Watts afterward. That’s also the day where he made the comment about giving blood to the Vietcong.\n\nBerkowitz\n\nAnd when you went to Watts, what was that like?\n\nEdelman\n\nWe got done with the speech, we had this flap about the blood for the Vietcong. I’d gotten on the phone, he’d gotten on the phone, we’d handled that. Didn’t have anything to do. I said, Maybe we should go to Watts. He said, Good idea, let’s do that. Do you know anything about it? I said, Well, I read about the Watts Towers in the New Yorker. There was this guy who had built this incredible thing of Coke bottle caps and things. So we got in a taxi and said to the guy, Take us to Watts. He dropped us off at some street corner in the middle of Watts, and Kennedy started talking to people.\n\nBerkowitz\n\nWhen he said, Do you know anything about it? you didn’t say, Well, I read about the Watts riots.\n\nEdelman\n\nWell, no, we both knew—\n\nBerkowitz\n\nThat was built-in comment.\n\nEdelman\n\nHe’d given a big speech right after the riots and I’d worked some on the speech. He meant did I know anything about the specific local geography.\n\nRiley\n\nWere there press people following you?\n\nEdelman\n\nNo, it was just the two of us.\n\nRiley\n\nWas he comfortable in that environment?\n\nEdelman\n\nTotally.\n\nRiley\n\nThe shyness fades away when he’s in that—\n\nEdelman\n\nOh, he loves to talk to people. That’s different. He loves to talk to children particularly, that goes back to the shyness. But there was this man who, he said to him—I don’t know that the guy knew who he was. He just said, How you doing, so and so. So what’s the problem out here? The fellow said, It’s the flustration [sic]. The point of the story is, I was beginning to learn about stuff.\n\nBerkowitz\n\nIt sounds like you’re getting close to him too.\n\nEdelman\n\nBack in about April of ’65, he testified—I wrote some testimony about the New Haven Railroad, like I was the expert on that, too—there’s just two of us, Walinsky and me. Later on there’s Jeff Greenfield and there’s Mike Curzan and Wendell Pigman and Lew Kaden, but at the beginning there’s just two of us. So on 15 or 20 different subjects, I’m a huge expert.\n\nRiley\n\nWhat’s the age differential? How much older is he?\n\nEdelman\n\nHe’s 39? His birthday was in November. He’s 39, and I’m 27 in January ’65. So he gets done testifying—this was in New York about the New Haven Railroad—and he says, Let’s go see Jackie [Jacqueline Kennedy].\n\nBerkowitz\n\nAnd you were pretty good with that style where they have no hours and you’re at their beck and call, and there’s that informality that I’m sure was maddening to a lot of people who were in that setting. That didn’t bother you. You liked that he’d call you—\n\nEdelman\n\nHe didn’t call you in the middle of the night, but he expected to have something done when it was supposed to be done. He didn’t care if you had to stay up all night to do it. I didn’t mind that, no.\n\nHe ran a completely open-door office, so if he was around you didn’t have to make an appointment that you’ll see him at 11 o’clock, you could just say to Angie [Novello], Is he in there? Is he on the phone?\n\nBerkowitz\n\nWas he smart?\n\nEdelman\n\nHe was brilliant, absolutely brilliant. He had a capacity to finish your sentence. You could start talking about a subject he knew nothing about and he would get the drift like that [snapping fingers] and he would finish your idea. It was an intuitive brilliance, he could just figure out what something was about with the smallest amount of input.\n\nBerkowitz\n\nIt sounds like he was aural—\n\nEdelman\n\nVery aural.\n\nBerkowitz\n\nHe didn’t read, but he could hear.\n\nEdelman\n\nOh, he did read. We would send memos. He was a five-sense person. He loved to go out and talk to people; he loved to see people and listen to them and the example of the story about the man in Watts, and talking to the people when we went down to Mississippi, playing with the hungry child. Trying to get a reaction from the child who was half starving on the floor of the house there in Mississippi or talking to the families in Appalachia. He was a reader, he always had a book with him. He was really a five-senses person.\n\nBerkowitz\n\nAnd you were there too, it seems to me, in this time of transition, so if he’s conservative, he becomes a liberal before he dies. You don’t think he was ever a conservative when you saw him?\n\nEdelman\n\nThere are two schools of thought about that. There’s the good Bobby/bad Bobby and some sort of a switch from the one to the other. Then there’s the evolution Bobby. I’m definitely in the latter camp. You look at who he befriends, who he is interested in growing up. The pop psychology, if it is that, of Evan Thomas. Is it that he’s the seventh out of nine? That he’s got to sort of fight for the food on the table? Is it that he had to fight for his father’s attention, the Evan Thomas theory? He’s clearly a very mixed bag of a human being as he’s growing up. There are so many stories of his rudeness and his priggishness, his moralism, how judgmental he is.\n\nThe [Joseph] McCarthy thing, I think ironically didn’t have anything to do with his agreeing with McCarthy. I think he did that to please his father. But nonetheless, the fact that he didn’t have the sense to stay away from that—he learned fast. He didn’t stay there very long. So I actually don’t include that much on my list. But he clearly was, in many ways, an unattractive person. There are so many examples of his anger. But at the same time, he’s always most interested in people who aren’t like him and who don’t come from privileged backgrounds. Why does he get friendly with Dave Hackett at Milton Academy?\n\nBerkowitz\n\nDave Hackett was this charismatic, athletic guy, no?\n\nEdelman\n\nYes, but—\n\nBerkowitz\n\nAnd that fits into this sort of worshipful personality that he had.\n\nEdelman\n\nWrong. David Hackett is a townie. David Hackett is from a poor family, he’s a scholarship boy, and he doesn’t live on campus and in fact he’s a loner.\n\nBerkowitz\n\nOkay.\n\nEdelman\n\nSo it absolutely fits the story.\n\nGermany\n\nSo why do you think he looked to Hackett for the juvenile delinquency?\n\nEdelman\n\nBecause the Kennedys had this thing about anybody can do anything, which is only partially correct. That’s why. That’s my friend and he’s a smart guy and I really think he’s good at anything, so I’ll install him— David didn’t know anything about any of that stuff. That was why.\n\nFor example, the first thing he does as Attorney General is he installs David Hackett in an office that opens into his office to work on juvenile delinquency, which really means disadvantaged youth, at-risk youth.\n\nBerkowitz\n\nBut again, isn’t it the case that that’s a good example of how that’s a part of his personality because the whole business of juvenile delinquency was a Eunice [Kennedy Shriver] thing. They have also this universe of issues that they handle governed by the family within the family.\n\nEdelman\n\nHe likes kids. I don’t know whether it’s Eunice. He’s always very interested in children, no question about it. He sees the question of race and poverty through a prism of, in this case, young people. During the whole run up to the Bay of Pigs, he goes and gives some speech in Manhattan about anti-Communism, and he and Dave Hackett walk up to Harlem together where they have meetings with gangs, one black, one Italian. Sure, it’s a little complicated and fits in with various prisms and so on and so on. But what it’s basically about is that he’s interested in these kids who don’t have enough opportunity and that’s long before JFK dies.\n\nYou know Nick Rodis was his friend when he was in the Navy and I think they were the best man at each other’s weddings, or one of them anyway, and Nick Rodis is a working class guy from Connecticut. He always had that instinct for people who were outsiders, so it was always a more complicated picture.\n\nGermany\n\nDo you think he thought of you as an outsider?\n\nEdelman\n\nMe? I don’t think so. I’m just a smart kid. I think that’s all I am.\n\nBerkowitz\n\nYou’re not Dave Powers, you’re Ted Sorensen.\n\nEdelman\n\nWell, I guess so, as far as the comparison goes.\n\nRiley\n\nOr Peter Edelman.\n\nBerkowitz\n\nHe had those types too, they were the kind of hangers-on—\n\nEdelman\n\nBobby didn’t have much of that.\n\nBerkowitz\n\nHe didn’t have that, unlike Jack.\n\nEdelman\n\nNo, he didn’t have much of that. I don’t think there was a Dave Powers. He was so eclectic. He was friends with movie stars and Russian poets, and he did admire Douglas MacArthur and he was very eclectic.\n\nBut just to finish the point, as they went along with that David Hackett planning, they became quite aware that it was about poverty. There was a point at which Len Duhl told me—Len Duhl is my friend who was working at the National Institute of Mental Health at the time—Bobby called the whole Cabinet together and locked the door and made them sit there and talk about poverty. So it’s just not a bright line transition.\n\nTwo things are true after November 1963. One is, however you’re going to put the grief into the equation, and it’s definitely in there, and the other is now he’s on his own. He can be whatever he is. Up until that time, he’s JFK’s guy and so whatever he does is going to be for JFK, not what he himself would do left to his own devices.\n\nGermany\n\nHow did he feel about OEO after Johnson really put his stamp on it? Because OEO had really been a Kennedy product and then Johnson—\n\nEdelman\n\nHe was very supportive. Now remember that there were two pieces of OEO that were his creation that came out of these meetings I was talking about. One is maximum feasible participation, and Bobby’s really the father of community action, for better or for worse, since it became very controversial. And the other is VISTA [Volunteers in Service to America]. He had a huge commitment to the idea that young people should have the opportunity to serve the community. And he’s a big backer of OEO.\n\nWhat were we doing going to Mississippi when I met my wife in 1967? The Head Start program down there, which was the largest Head Start program in the country, was under virulent political attack from the Mississippi political establishment. We were going down there as part of a set of field hearings about reauthorization of the poverty program, but we were going down there to give a stage, a microphone, and a voice, to the Child Development Group of Mississippi [CDGM].\n\nRiley\n\nCan you tell us that story now?\n\nBerkowitz\n\nBefore you do, just to set that up. Bobby’s committees I guess were Education and Labor.\n\nEdelman\n\nYes, it was called Labor and Public Welfare then.\n\nBerkowitz\n\nWhich was not Harrison Williams—\n\nEdelman\n\nHarrison Williams was a member of the committee and Chairman of the Migratory Labor Subcommittee, so that when we went to see Cesar Chavez, Harrison Williams chaired the hearings. This was Joe Clark and it was called the Employment, Manpower and Poverty Subcommittee.\n\nBerkowitz\n\nAnd they set up field hearings—\n\nEdelman\n\nThey set up the field hearings.\n\nBerkowitz\n\nIn Mississippi.\n\nEdelman\n\nYes. There was a field hearing in Chicago, there was one out in California that I didn’t go to, Frank Mankiewicz went to staff that. There were a number of them.\n\nBerkowitz\n\nAnd the one in Mississippi, when was that exactly?\n\nEdelman\n\nApril of 1967. That’s how I met my wife.\n\nGermany\n\nHad you been to Mississippi before this?\n\nEdelman\n\nNo, I never had been. The main thing about that story is that we saw—it’s all in my book if anybody wants to pick that up—what’s most of interest about that was that we saw this incredible hunger in this wealthy country. There’s the famous story of his going into this house where there was this child on the floor and getting down to try to get some response from the child. My wife—not then my wife—and I happened to be standing there and saw that. The other part is he comes home and this man who could be so taciturn, who could just sit for hours at a time and not say anything, can’t stop talking about it. His children remember that vividly. I’ve talked to Kerry [Mary Kerry Kennedy Cuomo] about it in particular. He says to them, You’ve got to do something about this. She said to me that he never lectured them about their responsibility to do public service. He never told them what they were supposed to do. Perhaps it was just understood. That’s the only time she can remember where he said, You’ve got to do something about this. It was powerful. Of course it was. Seeing these children with swollen bellies and sores that wouldn’t heal. It was just horrible.\n\nBerkowitz\n\nDid you have any dealings with Senator [John] Stennis or Senator [James] Eastland?\n\nEdelman\n\nWe did. There was a group of physicians that went down there, financed by the Field Foundation—\n\nBerkowitz\n\nRobert Coles?\n\nEdelman\n\nRobert Coles and others. Ray Wheeler in particular, who was the only southerner, was a physician from Charlotte, North Carolina, and a man named Gordon Harper, and I don’t remember who the others were. They examined hundreds of children and found pernicious anemia and rickets and all these exotic diseases we didn’t think we had in the United States. So Robert Kennedy and Joe Clark arranged to have a hearing where the physicians could come and present their findings, and invited Stennis and Eastland to that hearing and they came. Eastland sat there with his huge cigar, but he sat there the whole time. Ray Wheeler talked about how ashamed he was as a southerner to have that in his native region.\n\nThen about a month later, I don’t have the exact time frame, we were in Harlem for some completely other reason. We got a phone call that Stennis had offered a $10 million amendment to get some money for hunger. We had this conversation about whether we should attack it or not, and Kennedy said, No, let’s just welcome it. That’s only a start but it’s a start and it’s in the right direction.\n\nBerkowitz\n\nIn the Senator’s mind, was this a black thing? Did he connect it with race? The discussion of poverty, it was a disgrace that black people were poor or was it more general than that? It’s a disgrace that people are poor.\n\nEdelman\n\nRemember he’s got a background in Appalachia as well, going back to President Kennedy, and he’s always very interested in Native Americans. So no, he doesn’t see poverty solely in black terms. He understands and sees it disproportionately as opposed to white people, being people of color or minorities. Cesar Chavez, farm workers, that’s not black. So no.\n\nYou know the story about why there’s so much hunger in Mississippi—because the powers-that-be decided to try to drive black people out of Mississippi. So it’s definitely racist. I can give you the details of that, but that’s essentially what was going on. But he wanted to hold hearings about hunger in other places. We only ended up doing one other trip, which was to eastern Kentucky, which is white, in February of 1968.\n\nRiley\n\nAt what point does he start thinking about running for President?\n\nBerkowitz\n\nNovember 1963?\n\nEdelman\n\nI was going to say you’d have to have an x-ray of his brain to know about that, but in terms of taking on Johnson as opposed to waiting until 1972, it must begin to cross his mind after Pleiku, after Johnson escalates the war in ’65. Then in February of ’66, he gives that speech about sharing power and responsibility, which is very confrontational with Johnson. By that time there clearly are two camps in the Democratic Party.\n\nThen in the ’66 elections he really goes and campaigns for Democrats all over the country, which is intrinsically the right thing to do but has to be related to other things. Adam Walinsky writes a brilliant memo after the ’66 elections saying, Johnson is finished and you’ve got to think about running. Kennedy pretended to ignore that.\n\nSo it’s there all the way along. In the fall of ’67, Allard Lowenstein comes along very explicitly urging him to run, and we were definitely across a line at that point in terms of being out in the open. But as you said—\n\nBerkowitz\n\nHe tells Allard Lowenstein no, right?\n\nEdelman\n\nYes, he does.\n\nBerkowitz\n\nSo that was still the official line at that point.\n\nEdelman\n\nYou’ll never know. If he was still alive you wouldn’t know because he was such a complicated man, and in any case, we all have different influences, different things—he came from a family that believed in winning. He’s the quintessential transitional figure in so many ways. He has one foot squarely in machine politics. He knows how to do nuts-and-bolts, traditional Democratic politics, how to relate to bosses, all that stuff. And he’s friends with Tom Hayden and all the new politics of the time, and that’s all swirling around in his head. So there’s a part of him that is a cause-oriented person, and he’s very conflicted about that. But his daddy taught him you don’t go into something you can’t win.\n\nSo that’s all going on there. Besides that, he’s got this feeling that he expressed many times—not so much around whether he should run or not—but that was clearly there, which is anything he does that’s confrontational to Lyndon Johnson is going to make Lyndon Johnson do something worse. I notice you had Jeff Shesol. Jeff wrote that terrific book about the conflict. If you haven’t read it, it’s a great book. Why does Kennedy stop talking about Vietnam after February of 1966? He doesn’t say anything about Vietnam until about a year later when he makes the speech about stopping the bombing, because he’s really worried that if he takes on Johnson too directly, Johnson’s just going to drop more bombs.\n\nBerkowitz\n\nYes, and he had to decide that that’s not what Jack would have done, right? That would have been another way he could—\n\nEdelman\n\nNo, I wouldn’t say so, not by then.\n\nBerkowitz\n\nHe’s free of Jack?\n\nEdelman\n\nI think it’s still on his mind maybe in ’65. He gives that speech that’s a criticism of going into the Dominican Republic in May of 1965, or late April. Arthur Schlesinger wrote it, it has a part in it about questioning what we’re doing in Vietnam. It’s his first public statement questioning the war in Vietnam. There was a reporter named Ted Knap, from the old Scripps-Howard World Telegram, who calls me up and says, Is the Senator saying that this isn’t what President Kennedy would have done? I said, I don’t know, Ted, maybe. The next day, huge headline: RFK: JFK would have done it differently.\n\nSo I went in and I confessed and I said, This is all I said. He’s twisted it. That was totally unfair. He was furious at me. He stayed mad at me for, I don’t know, a couple of weeks. I was in the doghouse. So that’s got to be reflecting some internal struggle that’s going on. He said, Don’t you ever speculate what President Kennedy would have done. He’s up there, we don’t know what he would have done. So I think it’s about breaking free.\n\nBerkowitz\n\nDid you feel comfortable talking on that subject? I’ve noticed that’s something that when people meet members of the Kennedy family, there’s a question of whether one talks about that or not.\n\nEdelman\n\nWhat’s the subject?\n\nBerkowitz\n\nThe national tragedy, that his brother is dead and so on.\n\nEdelman\n\nWell, what’s to talk about?\n\nBerkowitz\n\nDid he talk about his relationship with his brother or was that something that was just not mentioned with his staff?\n\nEdelman\n\nMostly not. Sometimes he would say something they had done if it was relevant to a conversation, Well, we did so on and so forth. This is how we handled this when it came up before. Some analogous thing. When there was a business reason for it. Maybe with somebody, but I told you before, this is a very introspective man, who doesn’t share his introspection, who resists being analyzed by anybody else. So the answer is no. But it’s not because it’s taboo, maybe it is taboo, but you just don’t talk about it.\n\nGermany\n\nOne quick question about the relationship you had as his assistant. You primarily focused on the domestic side. Did you find that you became more focused on international issues as his profile got much larger in terms of taking it—I’m thinking of ’67 and ’68.\n\nEdelman\n\nOn Vietnam, we were all in it. I didn’t write, but anytime there was something major, like after the February ’66 speech where Johnson unleashed everybody on him, and quite calculatingly unleashed RFK’s own friends in the Cabinet, made them go out and attack him. It was a very unpleasant time. We were hunkered down in his office for a period of two, three, four days. It wasn’t a big staff. It was Joe Dolan and I think Frank Mankiewicz was there by then and Adam and me. He would maybe talk to Dick Goodwin or Arthur Schlesinger or Burke Marshall on the phone. It was a very small number of people. So I was in anything that went on related to foreign relations.\n\nGermany\n\nThis is assuming that Mississippi is not considered a foreign country.\n\nEdelman\n\nBut I didn’t go to South Africa with him. I wasn’t involved in the planning. I didn’t go to Latin America with him. Any speech that had to do with Vietnam I was certainly there. There was a time on the stop-the-bombing speech, in 1967, I had strep and I’d been home and I struggled into the office. They sent the draft by and I had read it and had struggled into the office to be there for the last meeting on it. He didn’t say, How you doing? How are you feeling? He said, Am I dove enough for you?\n\nRiley\n\nWell, I’ve been notified that they’re ready for us downstairs so why don’t we break now for lunch and we’ll come back and try to wrap up—it’s a fascinating discussion.\n\nBerkowitz\n\nIt seems to me that we have two things on the table. One is we haven’t talked about the campaign—\n\nRiley\n\nPresidential campaign?\n\nBerkowitz\n\nThe 1968 campaign. But then we have that Mississippi story and Marian Wright Edelman and so on.\n\nEdelman\n\nIf you want the story in more detail, I’ll tell you, I’ve written that whole thing in my book, not to waste your time. I’m perfectly happy to do it. It’s not any reserve or reluctance on my part, but I do tell that whole story in my book.\n\nRiley\n\nI think we can go ahead and continue with the biographical questions although we’ll probably need to move a little more expeditiously up to the subject matter.\n\nEdelman\n\nSure, I’ll move as fast as you want to move.\n\nRiley\n\nI do think it would be useful for us to hear a couple of things that will be relevant when we come to the later period, at least from my perspective, and I don’t want to completely shut this off because I want to check with these two also about their interest in the pre-Clinton years. But that would be the presidential campaign work that you did, which began in ’68. Then in 1980 you had a prominent role in the Edward Kennedy campaign. Then of course we’d like to transition from that into your earliest associations with Bill Clinton, when those come up.\n\nBut that means that there’s an awful lot of stuff that I’m not touching on and again, I want to make sure, there may be some areas of discussion, recognizing we can’t get to everything that my colleagues here would want to probe you a bit about and I think we have enough time to spend some energy—\n\nBerkowitz\n\nI might ask a UMass question.\n\nEdelman\n\nDo you want me to do what you just said then, or do you want to do something else first?\n\nGermany\n\nI think that would be great. Somewhere in there I’d like, at some level, to talk about your role in New York State in the Division for Youth.\n\nEdelman\n\nWhy don’t we do those two after we do that or either way around, we can do those two and then do that.\n\nBerkowitz\n\nWhy don’t we start taking about the 1968 campaign?\n\nEdelman\n\nThe 1968 campaign, that follows on where we were before. First of all, the question of his decision to run. He had so many conflicting stimuli and conflicts inside himself. One little story I want to tell is that he and I were in San Francisco at the end of 1967 for some hearings on education of Native American children. We went to have a meeting with Jesse Unruh who was the Speaker of the California Assembly at that time, or maybe he was already Treasurer of the State of California by then, to explore what Unruh would be willing to do if Kennedy did decide to run. That’s important in a number of ways, because it says that he’s thinking about it, regardless of what he has said to people. It was just Kennedy and me and Unruh and maybe one of Unruh’s aides.\n\nThey danced around all evening. About all he got out of Unruh was a commitment that Unruh would be willing to pay for a poll to see how Kennedy would run in California. We walked out of there and he said to me, You know, if I had Larry O’Brien with me, I could have left him behind to continue the conversation because he could talk the balls off a brass monkey. We get into the car and I say, Senator, you’ve been talking to lots of people all fall. You know where I stand on this but I haven’t said it out loud, so I want to tell you I hope you’ll run for President.\n\nHe said to me—and I’m sure it was just temporizing, because I think he was actively thinking about running—he said, I don’t have anybody to do for me what I did for my brother. Now that’s a very interesting comment if you think about its implications. I’m sure there are other things other people can tell you, or that I’ve forgotten. He goes to the [Godfrey] Sperling breakfast on what turns to be the morning of the Tet offensive. The news of the Tet offensive comes over the wire while he’s in there, not known to him. While he is in there he says that under no foreseeable circumstances will he run for President and walks out of the Sperling breakfast to find that this has happened. That is a major piece of unfortunate timing, because it tied his hands at least for a while, where if he hadn’t said that, he would have been able to move sooner.\n\nDo you all know what the Sperling breakfast is?\n\nRiley\n\nSure.\n\nBerkowitz\n\nI don’t.\n\nEdelman\n\nGodfrey Sperling was the long-time Christian Science Monitor Washington correspondent who had a regular breakfast that journalists could come to. They had to pay their ten bucks or whatever it was. I think it was off the record, but of course, everybody knew that he had said that and that would have been one where lots and lots of reporters would have been there.\n\nBerkowitz\n\nThat would have been January of 1968.\n\nEdelman\n\nJanuary 30th.\n\nBerkowitz\n\nSo [Eugene] McCarthy is already in the race.\n\nEdelman\n\nOh, McCarthy is already in the race—\n\nBerkowitz\n\nWhich I take it was not considered a very serious thing by Kennedy.\n\nEdelman\n\nRobert Kennedy had very little respect for Eugene McCarthy. I don’t know what he thought initially. By that time, Dick Goodwin was in the McCarthy campaign. So by that time he’s getting reports back from New Hampshire at night. Dick is calling and he’s saying, Bob, he’s really doing well up here. Bob, there’s polling data that says he might win this thing.\n\nBy January 30th, Kennedy knows some of that and nonetheless makes that statement at the Sperling breakfast.\n\nRiley\n\nMaybe not in an era of CNN, the news probably comes here before it gets—\n\nEdelman\n\nWhat do you mean?\n\nRiley\n\nI’m sorry. It’s a digression but I’m struck by the fact that he gets the news of Tet after the meeting, although the information is probably flowing through the pipeline as he’s addressing the meeting. I’m trying to put that in a contemporary context and say, well—\n\nEdelman\n\nSomebody would have a cell phone that printed out the message while they’re sitting in there and they would say, Senator, the news has just come— That’s right, the technology is quite different.\n\nThe next piece, in terms of what I have to say about it personally, is that on March 10th, two days before the New Hampshi"
