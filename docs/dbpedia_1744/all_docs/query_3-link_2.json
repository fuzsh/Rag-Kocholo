The investigation resulted in the prosecution and conviction of four individuals. At that time the Governor became known as a sharp-eyed overseer of the public good, and had a habit of involving himself in the operations of many state agencies. His reforms included concentrating power in the Governor's office and abolishing a number of redundant state boards and commissions, replacing them with a single official who was held responsible for results. The Philadelphia Bulletin supported the Governor's reform efforts stating,\n\nThere has probably never been a governor of Pennsylvania who has employed the veto power so extensively in dealing with the bills of a single legislative session as Governor Stuart has in the past thirty days. He has prevented scores of crude, ill-considered... bills from becoming laws and he has reduced the improvident appropriation to the extent of more than twenty million dollars. In the midst of all the vetoing it has been difficult for any one to challenge the justice of the governor's judgement. Every veto has rested on a sound reason in the public interest.\n\nAmong the bills he vetoed included the building of a statewide system of state roads, a cause he supported, but chose to sacrifice for fiscal prudence and accountability.\n\nStuart Hall on the campus of Penn State University is named in honor of Governor Stuart.\n\nHe is buried at West Laurel Hill Cemetery, Bala Cynwyd, Pennsylvania."
