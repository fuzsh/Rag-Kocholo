        "text": "Stuart History, Family Crest & Coats of Arms\n\nOrigins Available:\n\nEngland\n\nScotland-Alt\n\nScotland\n\nIreland\n\nThe origins the old family name Stuart can be found within medieval Scotland. While the patronymic and metronymic surnames, which are derived from the name of the father and mother respectively, are the most common form of a hereditary surname in Scotland, occupational surnames also emerged during the late Middle Ages. Many people, such as the Stuart family, adopted the name of their occupation as their surname. However, an occupational name did not become a hereditary surname until the office or type of employment became hereditary. The surname Stuart was an occupational name for a steward, the official in charge of a noble household and its treasury. One common alternate spelling of the name is a result of the influence of Mary, Queen of Scots, who was educated in France, and consequently spelled the name Steuart or Stuart.\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly Origins of the Stuart family\n\nThe surname Stuart was first found in Oswestry, Shropshire, where they had been granted lands by William the Conqueror, their liege Lord.\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly History of the Stuart family\n\nThis web page shows only a small excerpt of our Stuart research.

The British continued to expand the settlements including setting the First Federation in the British West Indies by 1674; some of the islands include Barbados, Bermuda, Cayman Island, Turks and Caicos, Jamaica and Belize then known as British Honduras. By the 1960's many of the islands became independent after the West Indies Federation which existed from 1958 to 1962 failed due to internal political conflicts. After this a number of Eastern Caribbean islands formed a free association. 13\n\nStuart Settlers in West Indies in the 17th Century\n\nRobert Stuart, who settled in Jamaica in 1689\n\nRobert Stuart, who landed in Jamaica in 1689-1690 6\n\nContemporary Notables of the name Stuart (post 1700) +\n\nJames Stuart (1897-1971), 1st Viscount Stuart of Findhorn, Conservative Party politician and Secretary of State for Scotland\n\nAlexander John Mackenzie Stuart (b. 1924), Scottish judge\n\nImogen Stuart (1927-2024), (nÃ©e Werner), German-Irish sculptor\n\nEdwin Sydney Stuart (1853-1937), American politician, Governor of Pennsylvania from 1907-1911\n\nMohammed \"Dino\" Stuart (1945-1946), Namibian politician, Member of the National Assembly of Namibia\n\nChristopher Elliot \"Chris\" Stuart (1949-2022), British journalist, songwriter and radio and television presenter and executive producer of the BBC Two quiz series Only Connect\n\nChad Stuart (1941-2020), English singer and musician, best known as one half of the duo Chad & Jeremy\n\nBarry Stuart (1934-2020), Australian Olympic sprint canoeist who competed from the late 1950s to the late 1960s\n\nJames Ewell Brown \"J.E.B.\" Stuart IV (1935-2020), American army colonel, financial planner, museum chairman, and public speaker, awarded the Legion of Merit, Bronze Star Medal with oak leaf cluster, Defense Meritorious Service Medal, Army Meritorious Service Medal with an oak leaf cluster, Army Commendation Medal and the Vietnamese Honor Medal 1st Class (Vietnam)\n\nMs. Sheena Ann Stuart M.V.O., British Housekeeper for Balmoral Castle, was appointed Member of the Royal Victorian Order on 29th December 2018 14\n\n...

Mottoes first began to be shown with arms in the 14th and 15th centuries, but were not in general use until the 17th century. Thus the oldest coats of arms generally do not include a motto. Mottoes seldom form part of the grant of arms: Under most heraldic authorities, a motto is an optional component of the coat of arms, and can be added to or changed at will; many families have chosen not to display a motto.\n\nMotto: Noblis est ira leonis\n\nMotto Translation: The wrath of the lion is noble.\n\nSuggested Readings for the name Stuart +\n\nAlexander Stewart, his Scots Ancestry and American Descendants by Dorothy Kintigh Sidfrid.\n\nStewart Family History, 1821-1982 by Ruth Ann Reiser Stewart.\n\nCitations +\n\n\"What are the 5,000 Most Common Last Names in the U.S.?\".
