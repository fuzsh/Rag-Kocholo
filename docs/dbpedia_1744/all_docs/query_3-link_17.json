        "text": "Edward John Eyre (born August 5, 1815, Whipsnade, Bedfordshire, England—died November 30, 1901, near Tavistock, Devon) was an English explorer in Australia for whom Lake Eyre and the Eyre Peninsula (both in South Australia) are named. He was subsequently a British colonial official.\n\nEmigrating from England for reasons of health, Eyre reached Australia in March 1833. As a sheep farmer he became a pioneer “overlander,” driving stock from Sydney to Adelaide. He explored the desert northwest of Adelaide and then (June 1840–July 1841) made an extremely hazardous journey around the Great Australian Bight. For several years he served as a magistrate and protector of Aborigines, whose language and customs he learned.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nExploration and Discovery"
