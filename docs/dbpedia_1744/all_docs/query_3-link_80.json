Historical personages alluded to in the volume and certain minor officials are not identified. All titles and positions are American unless there is an indication to the contrary.\n\nIn this list and in other editorial material throughout the volume (document headings, footnotes, and editorial notes), every effort has been made to provide recognizable and consistent transliterations of names of individuals from countries using non-roman alphabets. The transliterations adopted for proper names were those most commonly used by the Department of State at the time, or in documents or official publications of the countries concerned. (In the case of Arabic names, differences arise in the transliteration of vowels, The editors have generally rendered the definite article as ah rather than el-, and have omitted diacritical marks.) The editors have in all cases retained the spelling used in the original documents."
