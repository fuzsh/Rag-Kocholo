        "text": "In Finnegans Wake, the most woke book in history, James Joyce alludes in his own unique oblique fashion to a match between two Scottish football clubs, Partick Thistle and St Mirren, a fixture played at Love Street, Paisley, on Holy Saturday, the 7th of April 1928, which ended in a 2-2 draw. (1) The University of Glasgow is hosting the International Joyce Symposium from 14-19 June 2024. The conference title, ‘Across the Waters’, is well-chosen, for as my colleagues organising this event point out, Joyce has a connection with this city that goes back to his earliest travels and forward to his last great work: ‘For James Joyce, as for many Irishmen and women, Glasgow was the first city he saw beyond his native shores. During the Summer of 1894, Joyce crossed to Scotland from Dublin on a Duke Line steamer with his father. It was also the city where his last book, Finnegans Wake, was printed by the firm of James MacLehose & Sons in Anniesland during the 1930s. 130 years after Joyce’s visit, the University of Glasgow is welcoming the James Joyce Foundation to Scotland for the first time to hold the 29th International Joyce Symposium.’ (2) Joyce was twelve years old at the time of his visit to Glasgow, and the short version is that it rained and his father drank too much and got into a fight. We only know about this jaunt at all thanks to his younger brother, Stanislaus, who describes it briefly but poignantly in his memoir, My Brother’s Keeper, published in 1958. James Joyce died in 1941, and Stanislaus in 1955, so neither brother was around to elaborate further on that Scottish journey. Richard Ellmann could take the story no further forward in his 1959 biography of Joyce, and scholars have subsequently lamented the fact that we have only a sketchy account of the writer’s first trip outside of Ireland. (3) Joyce’s visit to Glasgow with his father is touched on briefly by their respective biographers, who clearly haven’t visited the city in June, the rainy season, judging by comments like ‘The visit was spoiled by rain’, and ‘Depressingly, it poured with rain.’ I laughed out loud when I read those remarks. So, we don’t know much about Joyce’s Glasgow bucket list, except that it bucketed, but perhaps we know more than we think we know. We certainly know enough about the route Joyce would have taken to Glasgow by boat and train, and the things he might have seen on the way, to be able to follow in his footsteps – or wallow in his wake – up to a point. What I aim to do here is map out Joyce’s journey as far as is possible given the scarcity of sources and the barebones information provided by Stanislaus. (4)\n\nJoyce’s first sight of Scotland would be the view of Princes Pier Station at Greenock, where the Duke Line docked. This was the first port of call for passengers on the way to Glasgow, some twenty miles from their final destination. In fact, we know exactly what Joyce’s first view of Scotland was, because we have some remarkable photographs of his landing point in 1894, the year after that it was revamped to compete with the neighbouring port of Gourock. (5)\n\nThe new station opened on 25th May 1894, so the Joyces would have disembarked here. But what did they see on their journey from Dublin? Imagine if we could join the young James Joyce on that trip with his father and see the journey through his eyes. Luckily we can, thanks to a tour guide from the time. Although published in June 1884, exactly ten years before Joyce’s journey, this account describes the overnight sea crossing in some detail, and points to the landmarks that passengers would pass as they travelled, from dawn to dusk, from Dublin to Greenock, from the Liffey to the Clyde. (6)\n\nIn Ulysses there’s a reference to ‘Dublin and Glasgow Steam Packet Company – The Duke Line, 70-72 North Wall Quay.’ Joyce was precise about these things. The Duke Line – or the Dublin & Glasgow Steam Packet Co., to give it its official title, as Joyce does – was formed in 1823, and sailed from the North Wall Quay on the Liffey to Princes Pier in Greenock and onwards by connecting train to Glasgow Central railway station, a total journey time of around 12-14 hours, the last leg by train in Joyce’s time taking between 45 minutes and an hour.\n\nWe don’t know the exact date of Joyce’s journey, though it probably took place sometime around June. We don’t have passenger lists for travel between Ireland and Scotland for this period so we don’t know which boat Joyce sailed on or the dates of travel. He could have been aboard any of the ‘splendid saloon paddle steam ships’ run by the company, including the Duke of Argyll, the Lord Clyde, and the Lord Gough. Joyce might have been onboard the iron paddle steamer, Duke of Leinster, built by Robert Duncan & Co. of Port Glasgow and launched in 1870. It was a vessel with a troubled history. On the 19th of November 1874 it ‘ran down jolly boat of HMS AURORA off Prince’s Pier (outward for Dublin); 15 of 30 in the rowing boat were drowned or killed by the impact.’ (7) Whatever vessel they travelled in, Joyce and his father would have stepped onto Princes Pier into a town that was a home from home.\n\nFirst off, upon arrival in Greenock the Joyces may have been met by John Joyce, a 41-year-old railway porter living in the town at 21 Wellington Street. (8) They would have heard Irish accents aplenty. According to Shaun Kavanagh: ‘In the whole of Britain, by 1871 only London had more Irish migrants per head of population than Greenock.’ (9) Greenock was a hub of Irish cultural and political activity. The Greenock Irish National Association founded in 1865 would prove a seedbed for the Scottish contribution to the Easter Rising of 1916. (10)\n\nJoyce would have been interested to know of the Greenock Burns Club, founded on 29 January 1802, and known as ‘The Mother Club’ because of its pioneering advocacy of the poet’s work. (11) Originating in Greenock Ayrshire Society in 1801, by the time of Joyce’s arrival in the town it was a bastion of Burns enthusiasm. According to the current website: ‘In 1894 the club’s activities were described thus: “Few if any clubs of a similar kind have done such excellent and praiseworthy work among the young people of the community. It has encouraged the reading of the great master’s poems, singing of his pure songs…and created and fostered a taste for the works of the other poets and literary men who shine with him in the galaxy of enduring fame.”’ The 1894 Invitation to the Greenock Burns Club reads: ‘Dr Nansen finds himself forestalled at the NORTH POLE by the proverbial Scotsman, but is consoled by an invitation to the local BURNS CLUB DINNER’, a reference to Norwegian Nobel prizewinning polymath Fridtjof Nansen’s polar expedition. Nansen is part of the ‘nansense’ of the Wake. (12)\n\nThere is so much to say about Greenock, this historic port town, the gateway to Glasgow for the young James Joyce, but what did the twelve-year-old Joyce make of Glasgow itself? Not much would be the short answer if we looked no further than Stanislaus, who speaks of a ‘visit of a few days in summer to Glasgow, at the invitation of the captain of one of the Duke liners, who was a friend of my father’s. The great joke of the visit, which was spoiled by rain, was that my father, soused to the gills on the return trip, had a heated and noisy argument about politics with the captain, an anti-Parnellite. Fortunately, the captain was a teetotaller on board though not one on shore. “By God, man”, my father would conclude in telling this wonderfully good story, “if he had been drinking he would have thrown me overboard.”‘ John Joyce was steaming on the steamer home, and steaming in Glasgow too. Stanislaus closes this account of his brother’s Glasgow visit with a couple of sentences that strike a chord: ‘I can picture my brother as a handsome young boy, all eyes and nerves, traipsing about in the muggy drizzle of Glasgow after his tipsy father. In Dublin I have more than once seen children, younger than my brother was at that time, trying to lead a staggering mother home.’ (13)\n\nSo there it is. On the surface, we know very little about Joyce’s Glasgow visit other than that it pissed, his father got pissed, and pissed off the ship’s captain, biting the hand that fed them their passage. All very Glasgow. (14) Not much trickledown besides the rain, the drink, and the piss. Yet 1894 was no ordinary year for the city. Joyce’s visit coincided with a defining moment for the arts and culture. The Glasgow Institute of the Fine Arts organised an ‘Exhibition Illustrative of Old Glasgow’ at the Galleries at 175 Sauchiehall Street. Items on display included books, chap-books, maps, magazines, manuscripts, periodicals, and portraits. Many were personal donations, but the University of Glasgow featured prominently as a contributor to the contents. A short prefatory note to the 450-page catalogue of the exhibition, published in July 1894, reads: ‘The Council of the Glasgow Institute of the Fine Arts have organized the Exhibition in order to illustrate the history and progress of Glasgow. The exhibits range in date from the earliest times until about the middle of this century. All the exhibits have a direct connection with Glasgow and its industrial, social, and civic life.’ (15)\n\nSo much for culture, what about sport. What might Joyce have made of Glasgow’s two great football clubs at the time – Celtic FC and Partick Thistle FC. We know that the name of the latter stuck in his mind from that mention in Finnegans Wake. It’s unlikely that Joyce saw a football match in Glasgow with his father in 1894, since he was there around June during close season, but he would have been aware of the importance of football as a form of popular culture. In season 1893-94, Celtic won League Division 1, finishing seven points ahead of their nearest rivals, Heart of Midlothian. The list of teams below them in the table of ten features some unfamiliar names to modern eyes: St Bernard’s, Third Lanark, Leith Athletic, and Renton. Partick Thistle finished fifth in League Division 2, topped by Hibernian. Again, a few unfamiliar names finished above and below them, including Cowlairs, Port Glasgow Athletic, and Abercorn.\n\nAt the risk of embarking on a wild goose chase, and providing some useless information, let me take a brief detour now and scrape some barnacles off the boat. It’s well-known that the starting-point for Joyce’s second novel, Ulysses, was his date with Nora Barnacle on 16th June 1904, ten years after his Glasgow trip, and that ‘when James Joyce’s father heard the surname of the girl with whom his son had run away, he exclaimed, as unable as his son ever to resist a pun, “Barnacle? She’ll never leave him”’. (16) If we go back to Glasgow ten years earlier we find another Barnacle, a Bearsden Barnacle. On the 19th of March 1894 Mary Ann Clark died in Bearsden (also known as New Kilpatrick) of apoplexy and congestion of the lungs. (17) She was 57 years old. Mary Ann’s maiden name was Barnacle, and her father, Thomas Barnacle, was a Master Baker. Norah Barnacle, Joyce’s first love and the muse behind the Bloomsday scenario, was also the daughter of a baker called Thomas. This is the kind of coincidence Joyce thrived on. But perhaps it was more than a coincidence. Perhaps Mary Ann was a relative of Norah’s. (18) Barnacle was a West of Ireland name, and Norah’s father, according to her biographer, ‘came from a line of Galway bakers’. (19) Whether that line stretched from Galway to Glasgow at some point in the mid-nineteenth-century I leave to others to untangle. Nora’s biographer, Brenda Maddox, tells us that ‘In the west of Ireland Barnacle was a common enough surname.’ (20) Conversely, there were only a handful of Barnacles in Scotland in the nineteenth century. (21) I wouldn’t wish to get into a bareknuckle fight with Joyceans – notoriously pugnacious – about whether Mary Anne Barnacle was a relative of Norah’s, although from my research it looks like neither she nor her father were born in Scotland.\n\nThus far James Joyce in Glasgow, but what about Glasgow in James Joyce. He appears not to have made much of his visit, but Joyce’s association with Glasgow did not end with that rowdy return trip to Dublin with his drunk dad. As Richard Barlow remarks, ‘Scotland provided Joyce’s first taste of a physical escape from Ireland. Later its literary culture would provide a different type of withdrawal.’ (22) Indeed when Stanislaus was trying to bail out his brother, Scotland became a great getaway story: ‘Stanislaus, still struggling to pay the debts Joyce had left behind, had new instructions for creditors: tell them he had gone to Scotland.’ (23) Stanislaus’s own admiration for Scottish literary culture is expressed in his memoir: ‘Scotland, too, has its Gaelic poets; but it has a host of poets even before Burns, in comparison with whose songs Anglo-Irish love poetry until Yeats is a very thin vintage.’ (24)\n\nThere are some passing allusions to Glasgow in the short story collection Dubliners, which has a Glasgow connection insofar as the publisher, Grant Richards, was born in Hillhead in the neighbourhood of the University. In ‘Grace’, Mrs Kernan reflects on her offspring: ‘Her two eldest sons were launched. One was in a draper’s shop in Glasgow and the other was clerk to a tea-merchant in Belfast. They were good sons, wrote regularly and sometimes sent home money.’ (25) In ‘The Dead’, Gabriel Conroy asks Mrs Malins about her crossing: ‘She lived with her married daughter in Glasgow and came to Dublin on a visit once a year. She answered placidly that she had had a beautiful crossing and that the captain had been most attentive to her. She spoke also of the beautiful house her daughter kept in Glasgow, and of all the friends they had there.’ (26)\n\nReferences to Glasgow have been detected in Ulysses too, including Stephen’s line, ‘I suspect […] that Ireland must be important because it belongs to me’, which makes one editor ask ‘Could this be an allusion to the popular Scottish drinking song? “I belong to Glasgow, / Good old Glasgow town, / But what’s the matter with Glasgow / For it’s going round and round? / I’m only a common old working chap, / As anyone here can see, / But when I’ve had a couple of drinks of a Saturday, / Glasgow belongs to me.”‘ (27) ‘I Belong to Glasgow’ was written by Will Fyffe in 1920. Joyce would have liked the story behind it; ‘Fyffe, or so the story goes, met his greatest inspiration late one night at Central Station, Glasgow. […] That night at Central Station he met a drunk. According to Albert Mackie’s The Scotch Comedians (1973), the drunk was “genial and demonstrative” and “laying off about Karl Marx and John Barleycorn with equal enthusiasm.” Fyffe asked him: “Do you belong to Glasgow?” and he replied: “At the moment, at the moment, Glasgow belongs to me.”’ (28) ‘I Belong to Glasgow’ was not the only Scottish song that registered with Joyce. Stanislaus mentions a trip to London by James and his father in April 1900: ‘My father came back with funny garbled versions of popular songs, and my brother declared that the music hall, not poetry, was a criticism of life.’ (29) In ‘A Little Cloud’, one of the stories in Dubliners, Joyce alludes to the 1911 music hall song co-written and sung by Harry Lauder, ‘A Wee Deoch an Doris’. (30) Lauder became a weel-kent face in London as a stage Scotsman, but his professional debut took place in Larkhall in 1894. Joyce could have caught him in Dublin in July of that year when Lauder played in Dame Street. (31)\n\nJoyce’s last work, Finnegans Wake was printed by the firm of James MacLehose & Sons, printers to the University of Glasgow, at their printing and bookbinding works at 15 Foulis Street in Anniesland in 1939. In 1972 MacLehose printworks, purpose-built in 1905, was taken over by another expanding business with strong University of Glasgow connections, Barr & Stroud Ltd, optical instrument engineers, co-founded by Archibald Barr, a former student of the University and later Regius Professor of Civil Engineering and Mechanics. Barr & Stroud were makers of periscopes and rangefinders for the navy and army, and built Scotland’s first minicomputer between 1958 and 1963. (32) In Finnegans Wake, in a passage rich in fleeting allusions to Scottish waterways like ‘so firth and so forth’ (200.13), ‘That’s the thing I’m elwys on edge to esk’ (202.15), and ‘Drop me the sound of the findhorn’s name’ (204.21), we find the following: ‘Linking one and knocking the next, tapting a flank and tipting a jutty and palling in and pietaring out and clyding by on her eastway’ (202.10-12). James Atherton noted that ‘“cly” with the meaning of “carry off illegally” is probably a part of “clyding” […] together with “gliding” and the river Clyde’. (33) Lawrence Rainey suggested ‘clyding merging “gliding” with the river Clyde in Scotland’, and ‘eastway echoing the word “estuary,’” but also saying which way the Liffey flows.’ (34) In ‘clyding’ we might also hear ‘colliding’ and ‘colluding’, and in ‘eastway’ we might detect the Clyde Estuary as well as the eastward direction of Joyce’s youthful journey from the lips of the Liffey to the mouth of the Clyde.\n\nThe bibliographical bloodhound will enjoy sniffing out more allusions to Glasgow and Scotland in Joyce. (35) In Finnegans Wake we find the query, ‘Arran, where’s your nose?’ (204.31-2.) This is, we are told, a reference to the notorious smell of Arran Quay on the Liffey in Dublin, the quay named after Richard Butler, Earl of Arran, whose title applied to the Aran Islands off the West coast of Ireland, not to be confused with Arran Island, ‘belonging to the Duke of Hamilton’, which Joyce’s boat nosed past at sunrise in the summer of 1894, unless, like the man himself, we rejoice in such confusion.\n\nI end this excursus with a portrait of the Dublin artist by Glasgow counterpart, Gerry Mangan. The border text reads: ‘Portrait of the artist as an elderly metempsychotic, plucking the heartstrings on a minor quay of the Anal Livia harking to a harpie blowing his own Sireen ni Houlihan singing cocks and muscles alive aliffey a plurabell book and candlewicker to wake up Finnegan to begin again to plug in the five-pin djinn again to forge the cochlea of his race in the Smithfield of his sole mio before he flies too close to – yes – the Sony and melts the wax in his ear phoney in nomine patrimony et filibuster et mollification.’\n\nIMAGE CREDITS\n\nThe images of Princes Pier Greenock in 1894 and Robert Maclehose the Printers in 1968 are courtesy of http://canmore.org.uk/collection.

Megan’s’ (Finnegans Wake, 378.18-19) is mentioned alongside a game between Crystal Palace and Walsall and the coincidence of the two results – a 4-goal draw and a 4-goal victory (Palace beat Walsall 5-1 at Selhurst Park) – has been painstakingly traced to this date. See Peter J. Reichenberg, ‘Finnegans Wake: The Dating Game’, James Joyce Quarterly 46, 2 (2009): 362-365, at 363. According to Richard Barlow: ‘Probably the similarity of “Partick” and “Patrick” attracted Joyce; the team name almost brings together the patron saint of Ireland with the national symbol of Scotland.’ Barlow, The Celtic Unconscious, pp.254-255, n30. Reichenberg offers more detail: ‘Partick Thistle and St. Mirren evoke the names of two Irish saints: Saint Patrick and Saint Mirren. The name Partick, from the Gaelic aper dhu ec, means the place at the mouth of the dark river. Partick is an area of Glasgow on the north bank of the River Clyde. Saint Mirren was an Irish monk, the founder and abbot of Paisley Abbey, Renfrewshire, Scotland. He is the patron saint of Paisley and of the St. Mirren Football Club.’ Reichenberg, ‘Finnegans Wake: The Dating Game’, p.364. The nicknames of these two clubs – the Jags and the Buddies – captures their prickly but friendly rivalry, and with St Mirren being also known as ‘the Saints’, and the Partick/Patrick pun, we can see why Joyce fastened on this particular pairing.\n\n(2) Across the Waters: XXIX International James Joyce Symposium University of Glasgow, 14-19 June 2024, https://ijjf2024.glasgow.ac.uk/.\n\n(3) I first became interested in Joyce and Scotland 25 years ago when I published a newspaper article on the subject: Willy Maley, ‘Bloomsday Scenario: James Joyce had a lot to say about Scotland … almost all of it bad’, The Sunday Herald (Seven Days: Scotland’s Current Affairs Magazine, 13 June 1999), p.10. The following year I published a critical essay on the subject: Willy Maley, ‘“Kilt by Kelt Shell Kithagain with Kinagain”: Joyce and Scotland’, in Derek Attridge and Marjorie Howes (eds.), Semi-Colonial Joyce (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2000), pp.201-218.\n\n(4) Richard Barlow, the major authority on James Joyce and Scotland, sets the bar high with his erudition and insight. In his groundbreaking book, The Celtic Unconscious, Barlow says: ‘It is unfortunate that so little is known about Joyce’s trip to Scotland.’ Barlow, The Celtic Unconscious, pp. 14-15. Despite the lack of flesh on the bones of Joyce’s Scottish sojourn, Barlow suggests that ‘it is highly likely that it would have brought him into contact with the results of waves of emigration, the mass movement of Irish labor-seekers into western Scotland in the late nineteenth century and early twentieth century. Indeed, given the very high numbers of Irish immigrating to Glasgow and environs in this period, it would have been difficult to avoid coming into contact with Irish workers.’ Barlow, The Celtic Unconscious, p.54.\n\n(5) ‘Greenock Princes Pier was rebuilt for the Glasgow and South Western Railway in 1894 in a grand Italianate style. This was to counter the Gourock extension of the Caledonian Railway which opened in 1889 (and even the opening of Craigendoran Pier on the north bank in 1882).’ ‘Greenock Princes Pier (2nd)’, Railscot, https://www.railscot.co.uk/locations/G/Greenock_Princes_Pier_2nd/#:~:text=Greenock%20Princes%20Pier%20was%20rebuilt,the%20north%20bank%20in%201882). More information on the excellent Canmore site: ‘Princes Pier Railway Station, an impressive railway terminus overlooking the Firth of Clyde, was designed by the Glasgow architect, James Miller, and built in 1893 for the Glasgow & South Western Railway Company. The architectural photographer, Harry Bedford Lemere, was commissioned to photograph the building in 1894. The booking office occupied the central part of the terminus. It had a first-floor balcony with views across the pierside to the water, and was flanked by large Italianate stair-towers with tile-hung walls and pyramidal roofs that acted as imposing beacons for the paddle steamers drawing up to collect the train passengers at the quayside. In the late 19th century new rail networks encouraged leisure travel, and the Glasgow & South Western Railway Company’s line from Glasgow allowed holidaymakers to travel directly to Greenock to embark onto the paddle steamers that would take them ‘doon the water’ to the popular seaside resorts of Helensburgh, Dunoon and Rothesay on the Firth of Clyde.

The Irish Revival had strong roots in Greenock: ‘In Greenock, this cultural revival took the form of associational culture; organisations like the Ancient Order of Hibernians and Gaelic football clubs such as St Patrick’s, Sarsfields, and Eire Og in Port Glasgow, fostered a sense of ethnic Irish identity in Greenock. Indeed, this new ethnic and cultural confidence led members of the republican Young Ireland Society to stand in defiant separation from electoral politics. In the process, they distanced themselves from the majority of the Greenock-Irish community. The pursuit of Gaelic ethnic virtues would ultimately be attained through political separatism. By rallying and maintaining support for anti-British sentiment and emotional Irish nationalism, Irish republicans appealed to simple expatriate feeling, evoking images and memories of ‘home’ through organisational meetings, and readily accessible writings and songs. In short, Irish republicanism in Greenock provided a portable identity – a way of ‘being Irish’ outside Ireland.’ Kavanagh, ‘Home Rule, Sinn Féin and the Irish Republican Movement in Greenock’, p. 96.\n\n(11) See Clark McGinn, ‘The True Date of the Foundation of the Greenock Burns Club’, Burns Chronicle 131, 2 (2022): 156-170.\n\n(12) https://ichscotland.org/wiki/greenock-burns-club.

S. Eliot (New York: Viking Press, 1958), p. 60. On this passage, and Stanislaus’s own qualities as a writer, see Wyatt Mason, ‘A Staggering Mother’, Harper’s Magazine (July 2, 2008), https://harpers.org/2008/07/a-staggering-mother/.\n\n(14) Joyce’s visit to Glasgow with his father is touched on briefly by their respective biographers, who clearly haven’t visited the city in June, the rainy season, judging by comments like ‘The visit was spoiled by rain’, and ‘Depressingly, it poured with rain.’ Richard Ellmann, his first critical biographer, drawing on the recollection by Stanislaus observes: ‘He was the only one of the children who got along easily with their father. The two liked to travel together, and that summer of 1894 John Joyce brought James along on a trip to Glasgow. He had made friends with the captain of one of the Duke liners that sail between Dublin and Glasgow, and took up the captain’s invitation to make the journey. The visit was spoiled by rain, but it gave John Joyce another sea story; on the return trip he and the captain quarreled violently over Parnell. “By God, man,” John Joyce would say afterwards, “if he had been drinking he would have thrown me overboard.”‘ Richard Ellmann, James Joyce: New and Revised Edition (New York: Oxford University Press, 1982; first published 1959), pp.40-41. The biographers of Joyce’s father likewise touch on the episode: ‘In June news came that Jim had vindicated his father’s boasts about him to Fr Conmee and had been awarded £22 for himself and £1 2-4s.od for the College in the 1894 Preparatory Grade Intermediate Examination. The money was paid to John but he passed it on to Jim, who promptly began to spend it, even taking his parents out to dinner at an expensive restaurant. It was probably this windfall and the goodwill it engendered between them that prompted John to invite Jim to accompany him on a summer trip to Scotland (perhaps, as “The Dead” seems to hint, for the wedding or funeral of one of the Malinses) . John did not have to pay for the sea crossing: as a seafaring man who knew the language since his Queenstown days, he had made friends with some of the personnel of the shipping companies when he was a Collector in the North Dock Ward and persuaded the captain of one of the Duke Line steamers to allow them an unused berth up the Irish Sea. Jim with his winnings could help to subsidise food, entertainment and somewhere to stay.\n\nAs Stanislaus remembered, they went first to Glasgow, then a city with a greater claim than Dublin to be the Second City of the Empire: its industrial vigour – in shipbuilding and locomotives – was quite unlike anything to be found in Dublin. James Joyce’s notes for Stephen Hero, however, strongly suggest that their final destination was beyond Glasgow and that a visit to Edinburgh featured in the lost chapters of that book – the existing parts of which are firmly rooted in fact. Depressingly, it poured with rain, which likely forced them to spend much of their time sheltering in city gin palaces. In delineating the development of the father-son relationship on this jaunt, another Stephen Hero note on the same page states darkly: “We cannot educate our fathers.” On the return voyage to Ireland the kindly captain was severely provoked by his inebriated friend who insisted on arguing vehemently and tediously with him about his favourite subject – Parnell. Afterwards, as he acted out an entertaining version of the story for the family, John reflected wryly that he was lucky not to have been seized bodily and thrown into the Irish Sea. Jim may not have been able to educate his father, but he was certainly learning a good deal from him and about him.’ John Wyse Jackson and Peter Costello, John Stanislaus Joyce: The Voluminous Life and Genius of James Joyce’s Father (London: Fourth Estate, 1998; first published 1997), pp.185-6.\n\n(15) Glasgow Institute of the Fine Arts: Exhibition Illustrative of Old Glasgow (Glasgow: William Hodge and Company, 1894), p.vi.\n\n(16) Brenda Maddox, Nora: The Real Life of Molly Bloom (New York: Houghton Mifflin, 2000), p. 9.\n\n(17) Mary Ann’s death certificate was viewed at https://www.scotlandspeople.gov.uk. Mary Ann was married to Edward Clarke in the Kelvin Registration District of Glasgow in 1877.

Her birth took place in the Galway City Workhouse, not because her family was penniless — they were not — but because the handsome limestone-terraced institution, which had sheltered more than a thousand people during the Great Famine of 1847-48, later served as general hospital for the city.’ Maddox, Nora, p. 9. Norah Barnacle became Nora after meeting Joyce, dropping the ‘h’. She was ‘Norah’ on her birth certificate but ‘Nora’ after she met Joyce.

The idea for the musical came out of discussion in the Special Unit between inmates, students of the RSAMD, and members of Glasgow band The Basement. There are five songs in the show – John Maclean; Sandman of Peterhead; We’ll Take Our Chances; Tell us who you are, John Maclean; and No Mean Fighter.\n\nJohn Maclean is well-known as a Red Clydesider. What people sometimes forget is that John Maclean was also a Peterhead prisoner, a man who did time in one of Scotland’s toughest jails. His experiences mirror those of modern inmates. Speeches by Maclean, and tributes to him, are interwoven with material from Special Unit inmates based on their experiences of Peterhead.\n\nPeterhead Prison, situated 34 miles north of Aberdeen, was built in 1888. It’s history goes back to 1881 when a Committee on the Employment of Convicts reported that the ‘most likely prospect for benefitting the shipping and fishing interests of the country at large and at the same time profitably employing convicts is the construction of a harbour of refuge at Peterhead in Aberdeenshire’. Peterhead was designated a General Convict Prison for male prisoners sentenced to a minimum of five years.\n\nJohn Maclean was kept out of circulation in prison. He complained of his food being tampered with, and being constantly fed false information by the authorities about his family and friends. Red Clydeside is gone, but Peterhead still feeds off young Scotsmen.\n\nTwo prisoners, John Maclean and another are in solitary in Peterhead in the same cell at different times. Their experiences are told through speeches, poems, songs and voices. We also hear the views of other prisoners, visitors and a warder.\n\nScene 1\n\nGOVERNOR: Our aim is to provide a secure environment within which all who live and work at Peterhead Prison are encouraged to participate in a positive and progressive yet structured and controlled regime. We are committed to developing a constructive working relationship at all levels. Thus forming the basis for mental trust and consensus. We must continue to shape and respond to society’s expectations, and to meet the objectives of the Scottish Prison System.\n\nSecurity. Control. Humanity. Opportunity. Responsibility.\n\nScene 2\n\n[Prisoner hides knife and finds diary]\n\nPRISONER: What’s this? A wallet? Naw. It’s a book. Somebody’s diary.\n\nPRISON OFFICER: Still here Maclean?\n\nJOHN MACLEAN: Aye, caged in body but not in spirit. Shiteing out the poison yous are feeding me.\n\nPRISON OFFICER: Paranoia you suffer from, laddie. That and allusions of grandeur.\n\n[Maclean returns to writing furtively in diary]\n\nJOHN MACLEAN: I had for some months here starting in December been feeling very ill, with what I can only describe as a chemical-induced pain. I went on sick roll. Now then, I come to the doctor. The doctor I refer to is the prison doctor.\n\nDOCTOR: Well, saviour of the human race, what ails you this time?\n\nMACLEAN: I told you, when I first arrived in Peterhead it was plain sailing.\n\nPRISON OFFICER: Aye. Now you’ve realised you’re marooned. Got bored with four walls for scenery.\n\nMACLEAN: Doctor, I was fevered up. And being able to combat that, I then chilled down. Two men came to see me at the end of December.\n\nPRISON OFFICER: Santa and a pal?\n\nMACLEAN: Doctor, do I have to suffer these types of remarks while describing the state of my health?\n\nDOCTOR: He’s not interrupting me. You were just about to mention your two visitors.\n\nMACLEAN: One a prominent lecturer in this country, and Mr Sutherland MP. And to them I protested that my food was being drugged. I said that there was alcohol in the food.\n\nDOCTOR: Nonsense.\n\nMACLEAN: Doctor, I know alcohol in the food can lower my temperature. I know also that potassium bromide is given to people in order to lower their temperatures. I was aware of what was taking place in Peterhead from hints and statements from other prisoners.\n\nDOCTOR: Are you complaining, or boasting? Alcohol!\n\nPETERHEAD PRISONER: Don’t let them play mind games with you, John. You keep it going, man. We’re all with you.\n\n[Song: ‘John Maclean’]\n\nJohn Maclean, John Maclean, tell us who’s to blame?\n\nJohn Maclean, John Maclean, you’re like a burning flame.\n\nWhen you were here, when you were here, the Clyde was red.\n\nSince you’ve been gone, since you’ve been gone,\n\nall the colours bled.\n\nIn Peterhead. In Peterhead. Oh they wished you dead.\n\nBut you returned, yes you returned,\n\nwith a vision instead.\n\nJohn Maclean, John Maclean, tell us who’s to blame?\n\nJohn Maclean, John Maclean, you’re still a burning flame.\n\nMACLEAN: I know you’re watching me. I can hear you breathing. I know I’m under observation. You’ll not intimidate me. When I get out I’ll make sure people know what’s going on in here. This is inhumane. I’m sick of your petty tyrannies. If you’re a doctor, you ought to be ashamed of yourself. How can you expect a man to keep his health in these conditions? If you’re a turnkey, you’re wasting your time. There’s nothing to see here.\n\nWARDER: Talking to yourself again, Maclean? My God you’re paranoid.\n\nMACLEAN: I won’t be cowed by your bullying.\n\nWARDER: There’s time yet. Don’t be in a hurry to be a hero.\n\nMACLEAN: I’m only a man, mister. I never pretended to be anything else. No saint. No sinner. Just a man.\n\nWARDER: A man with convictions, eh? And time on his hands. Well, I’m a man, too, Maclean. One of your precious working men. Earning an honest shilling. You can see I love my work. The bosses are good to me. What’s all your talk done for you?\n\nMACLEAN: I am a teacher. I am a socialist. I am a fighter for justice.\n\nWARDER: Socialism? The war put a stop to all that. It’s all king and country now. Except for traitors and troublemakers.\n\nMACLEAN: What about the Rent Strikes?\n\nWARDER: You don’t need to worry about rent strikes, Maclean. You can stay here rent-free.\n\nMACLEAN: Nothing’s free. The state is paying to keep me out of its hair, and the money comes from the workers. All this ugly business is being done in their name. I’m a prisoner of war. Class war.\n\nWARDER: The war’s over for you, Maclean. You’ve had your war. Now give us peace.\n\nMACLEAN: There’s no peace in Peterhead. It’s always war here. Did you hear me? I said there’s no peace in Peterhead!\n\nWARDER: Not for you!\n\nMACLEAN: Not for anybody. You’re in jail, too, mister. You’re just too bloody stupid to notice it!\n\n[Maclean returns to scribbling in his diary]\n\nMACLEAN: “From January to March, the so-called winter period, the doctor is busy getting the prisoners into the hospital. Breaking up their organs and systems…I give notice that I take no food inside your prison. Absolutely no food. If food is forced upon me, and if I am forcibly fed, then my friends have got to bear in mind that if any evil happens to me I am not responsible for my actions”. (Delirious, repeating his famous speech from the dock) No human being on the face of the earth, no government is going to take from me my right to protest against wrong, my right to do everything that is for the benefit of mankind. I am not here, then, as the accused; I am here as the accuser of Capitalism dripping with blood from head to foot.\n\nPRISON OFFICER: Are you pulling yourself in there, Maclean?\n\nMACLEAN: (Writing) “… I’ve seen the monster face to face. There’s no velvet glove in Peterhead. Only an iron fist. This is where the bosses show their true colours. The poor men in here are testimony to the injustice of the capitalist system. I leave this account here for a future inmate. It may be my last will and testament. I don’t know if I’ll ever get out of here alive. What I leave to mankind, my only worldly possession, is my rage against tyranny”.\n\n[He hides the notebook].\n\nScene 3\n\nPETERHEAD PRISONER: Who’s that? Who’s there? Bastards!\n\nPRISON OFFICER: What do you want, son?\n\nPETERHEAD PRISONER: A pen and some paper.\n\nPRISON OFFICER: What do you want with a pen?\n\nPETERHEAD PRISONER: I want to write.\n\nPRISON OFFICER: Then scratch the walls, son. That’s what everybody else does. This isn’t a school, you know.\n\nPETERHEAD PRISONER: They say the pen is mightier than the sword. Frankly, ah’d rather get chibbed with a pen. But then again, a nib’s a chib. You can take some bastard’s lamp out with it!\n\n[Song: No Mean Fighter]\n\nThis man was a visionary, a teacher, and a writer\n\nWhen he raised his fist on Glasgow Green\n\nHe was No Mean Fighter\n\nThis man he defied the law, its chains were pulling tighter\n\nSo they poisoned him in Peterhead\n\nHe was No Mean Fighter\n\nThis man was a burning flame, a flame still burning brighter\n\nThe people they recall his name\n\nHe was No Mean Fighter\n\nThis man had no stolen wealth, to make his burden lighter\n\nAll he had was his own self\n\nHe was No Mean Fighter\n\nThis man took a narrow mind, and made it open wider\n\nHe made them see who once were blind\n\nHe was No Mean Fighter\n\nThis man was a Glasgow Boy, and a Red Clydesider\n\nThey sent him to an early grave\n\nHe was No Mean Fighter\n\nScene 4\n\n1st WOMAN: They used to send them to Australia.

Travelling all day. And for what? To look at a broken man through a glass partition.\n\n1st WOMAN: A couple of hours once a month. Twelve hours on a bus for that.\n\n2nd WOMAN: They built the prison there so that the prisoners could build the harbour.\n\n3rd WOMAN: Now the harbour’s built, and the quarry’s closed, but the men are still there.\n\n1st WOMAN: Isn’t there something in Glasgow they could build?\n\n2nd WOMAN: Like houses.\n\n3rd WOMAN: They don’t build houses anymore, just jails.\n\n1st WOMAN: They’ve made prisoners of us too.\n\n2nd WOMAN: Breaking up families.\n\n3rd WOMAN: Like stones in a quarry. Smashed to pieces. Good for nothing but breaking glass.\n\n1st WOMAN: Dirty protests.\n\n2nd WOMAN: Hunger strikes.\n\n3rd WOMAN: Solitary confinement.\n\n1st WOMAN: Rooftop protests.\n\n2nd WOMAN: Ugly suicides.\n\n3rd Woman: Cries for help we never hear.\n\n1st Woman: Voices in the wilderness.\n\n2nd WOMAN: Like a seabird in a storm.\n\n3rd WOMAN: They come out worse than they went in.\n\n1st WOMAN: On an elastic band.\n\n2nd WOMAN: No future.\n\n3rd WOMAN: Shell-shocked.\n\n1st WOMAN: Further away from us than ever.\n\n2nd WOMAN: Pacing up and down.\n\n3rd WOMAN: Turning outside in.\n\n1st WOMAN: They had them making nets. To catch fish.\n\n2nd WOMAN: Cold eyes staring into space.\n\nTOGETHER: Gutted!\n\nScene 5\n\nPRISON OFFICER: Aye, you were a big man in court, MacLean. But you’re no such a big man now! If they could see you, they bloody comrades of yours. Standing there in your drawers, with your shirt tail hanging out.\n\nMACLEAN: Freedom is a flame that never goes out.\n\nPRISON OFFICER: Aye, you’re a political animal alright, MacLean. But there’s no politics in Peterhead, only animals. How does it feel, MacLean, to be locked up with murderers and thieves?\n\nMACLEAN: Don’t tell me there’s policemen, and bosses, and government ministers in here!\n\nPRISON OFFICER: You’re always on about the workers, MacLean. Well you’ll get plenty of work to do here. All the prisoners are workers.\n\nMACLEAN: And all the workers are prisoners.\n\nPRISONER: Yes, get it up you!\n\nPRISON OFFICER: Keep that noise down!\n\nMACLEAN: You can break my body, but you’ll never break my spirit. You can take away my clothes, but you’ll never take away my dignity. You can take me out of the struggle, but you’ll never take the struggle out of me.\n\nPRISONER: Well said, my man!\n\nPRISON OFFICER: Quiet in there!\n\nPRISONER: (Holding up Maclean’s prison diary, reciting poem by Hugh MacDiarmid)\n\nLook at it, you fools, with unseeing eyes,\n\nAnd deny it with lying lips!\n\nBut your craven bowels well know what it is\n\nAnd hasten to eclipse\n\nIn a cell, as black as the shut boards of the Book\n\nYou lie by the light no coward can brook.\n\nAs Pilate and the Roman soldiers to Christ\n\nWere Law and Order to the finest Scot of his day,\n\nOne of the few true men in our sordid breed,\n\nA flash of sun in a country all prison-grey.\n\nSpeak to others of Christian charity; I cry again\n\nFor vengeance on the murderers of John Maclean.\n\nLet the light of truth in on the base pretence\n\nOf Justice that sentenced him behind these grey walls.\n\nAll law is the contemptible fraud he declared it.\n\nLike a lightning-bolt at last the workers’ wrath falls\n\nOn all such castles of cowards whether they be\n\nUniformed in ermine, or blue, or khaki.\n\nPRISON OFFICER: We’re all equal in here, Maclean. There are no leaders here. No saviours either. You’re on your own. No big crowds to cheer you on. No flags waving. No fists clenched but your own. Look at him. Look at the saviour of the working class. Where’s yer comrades now, Maclean? Your friends have deserted you. Your wife has left you. You’re losing your mind, Maclean.\n\nMACLEAN: Liar!\n\nPRISON OFFICER: The red flag’s flying at half-mast now, Maclean.\n\nMACLEAN: Where e’er we go, we’ll fear no foe. We’ll keep the red flag flying high.\n\nPRISON OFFICER: I’ll weave you a red flag alright, and make you wear it for a shroud.\n\nPRISONER: Nothing changes.\n\nMACLEAN: Not without struggle.\n\nPRISONER: Where Were you when we needed you?\n\nPRISON OFFICER: Is that you talking to yourself, Maclean?\n\nMACLEAN: Who’s that?\n\nPRISONER: Who’s there?\n\nPRISON OFFICER: Keep that bastarding noise down.\n\n[Song: The Ghost of John Maclean]\n\nI can feel your heartbeat next to mine\n\nThough we live in different times\n\nOh how times have change\n\nBut in Peterhead, they’re still the same\n\nI can feel your pain\n\nTell me who you are, John Maclean\n\nJohn Maclean …\n\nI can feel your anger towards me\n\nJohnny can’t you see\n\nNo-one knows like me\n\nWhat it’s like to be insane.\n\nI can hear you breathing in my sleep\n\nPacing up and down will you greet\n\nYou were just a working man trying to lend a hand\n\nI understand.\n\nThere is no answer I can give to you\n\nThey lock you up for what we do\n\nKnock you black and blue\n\nYes that’s what they do, well it’s true.\n\nI can feel your heartbeat next to mine\n\nThough we live in different times\n\nOh how times have changed\n\nBut in Peterhead, they’re still the same.\n\nWOMAN: No child is born a criminal: no child is born an angel: he’s just born.\n\nScene 6\n\n[Woman at home.

The less time you’re here the better.\n\nMAN: Some homecoming. I didn’t think it would be like this when I saw the house again.\n\nWOMAN: You weren’t home when you were needed.\n\nMAN: I’m sorry.\n\nWOMAN: I had to arrange everything myself.\n\nMAN: There was nothing I could do about that. I couldn’t get here any earlier.\n\nWOMAN: You should never have been away in the first place.\n\nMAN: We’ve been through all this a thousand times.

He got more than he wanted…\n\nMAN: Stop it!\n\nWOMAN: …All my scars are on the inside.\n\nMAN: I tried to tell him right from wrong.\n\nWOMAN: He didn’t listen to what you said. He learned from what you did. I’m burying two men today. I mean it. You can stay in that tomb up there till hell freezes over.\n\nMAN: Please. Don’t…\n\nPRISON OFFICER: (Intruding) When you two are finished fighting we should go. The cars are waiting.\n\nMAN: It’s our funeral, you bastard!

Colleague of mine lost an eye. Some monster with a coat hanger. Can’t trust them with anything. If they’re no wanking and working-out, then they’re up to something. Okay, so I’m bitter. But that disnae mean I’m bad, does it? We’re not all brutes, ye know. We’re not the way we’re made out to be. I take my kids to the pictures. To the park. I prefer the park. I like open spaces. Truth be told, I’m a bit of a fresh air fiend. A bit of a one for the great outdoors. Well, you don’t get much fresh air in the tin pail, do you? Not when there’s people emptying their pisspots over you. Kicked a young fella to death, so they did. Nobody lifted a finger. They won’t grass. Grassing’s worse than murder in their book. If they want the prison population reduced and our job made easier, then give the public what they want. Bring back the noose.

Nice and glossy, eh? “The Secretary of State for Scotland has expressed his concern that steps should be taken to minimise the harmful effects of the prisoner’s removal from normal life (particularly in terms of family responsibilities and job prospects). Paragraph 4 – Access to Families. We agree the prisoner must have greater access to his family, however, it would be very difficult to provide the additional visit facilities within already cramped prison sites, and it would also be very expensive. We feel that this approach would, in any case, only increase the artificiality of the prisoner’s access to his family.”\n\nCan you imagine the mental torture of having your wife and wens an arm’s length away from you, once a month, for five years, without being able to touch them?\n\nScene 10\n\n[Women in visits.

Do you think I’m living the life of Riley or something? I’ve got more locks on my door than you. I couldn’t afford to feed a dog … It’s no easy being a woman on your own … Don’t start that. It’s not a fucking man I need. It’s a babysitter and a job … Aye, he came round with it last week … Of course I appreciate it. It got a bag of messages … It’s called inflation. You wouldn’t know much about it … I’m no raising my voice …\n\n2nd WOMAN: … The wee yin’s with her granny … It’s no exactly a day oot, is it? … I wasn’t well … That’s you all over.

Your nose’ll bleed for me in a minute … Damn right I will … You dare … What did you do with the last one I gave you? … In that case you can look at a magazine instead. I’m no posing like that again. I couldn’t look my sister in the eye … Alright. Calm down. I’ll see what I can do … You bought me that six years ago.

It took me six hours to get here … No if you meet me with a greetin face it’s no … You cracked up the last time when Big Alex gave me a lift … That’s your problem … Every man’s your enemy or your friend. There’s nobody in between. It’s a feast or a famine with you… I dream about you, too. Though God knows at times it’s more like a nightmare … George was asking for you … Aw, has he been excommunicated as well? … They’ve got lives to live the same as you … No, they’re no doing a lifer, but they cannae just drop everything and come running because you need them … No, neither can I …. Exactly, “Till death us do part”, no “till Peterhead do us part”. There wisnae any provision for this … I know you didnae plan it. I didnae plan to marry you either … That’s no what I meant. We’ve made our beds now … Mine’s might as well be a jail bed for aw the warmth there is in it …\n\nScene 11\n\nGOVERNOR: You know, it’s alright knocking authority. Lampooning leadership. Mocking management. Taking the mickey out of your superiors. Who was it said, “Sarcasm is the lowest form of wit”? Some sarky bastard, no doubt. Satire is the sport of the impotent, that’s my view. My humble opinion. We all have our crosses to bear, and if society washes its hands of these people, somebody’s got to step in and take control. Somebody’s got to put their shoulder to the wheel. It’s alright kidding and swanking, joking aside, though, it’s a bit of a cliche, call me old-fashioned if you like, but at the end of the day, when all is said and done, the buck stops here, with those who bear the burden of responsibility. Of course, maintaining order in an establishment such as this is no easy task. The prisoners are often recalcitrant, anti-social and disruptive towards the prison community – staff and other inmates alike. Firmness is essential when dealing with cases like the one I am about to hear this morning. A vicious, sustained and unprovoked assault upon an officer during a mail call. Bring in the prisoner!\n\n[Prisoner – John Morrison – brought in by warder, obviously in some pain]\n\nPRISON OFFICER: Stand to attention, back straight, hands out of pockets – prisoner Morrison, Sir!\n\nGOVERNOR: Thank you, officer. Morrison?\n\nPRISONER: Yes sir?\n\nGOVERNOR: Morrison, you are charged with… This prisoner appears to be experiencing some difficulty in standing upright, officer.\n\nPRISON OFFICER: Prisoner Morrison required some considerable restraint, sir.\n\nGOVERNOR: I see. You know what Rule 42 is?\n\nPRISONER: Yes, sir.\n\nPRISON OFFICER: Silence when addressing the Governor!\n\nGOVERNOR: Rule 42 – our disciplinary system revolves around it and it’s eighteen sub-sections. Where would we be without it, officer? Where would we be?\n\nPRISON OFFICER: Drowning in a sea of chaos, sir.\n\nGOVERNOR: How true, how very true. I’ve said it so many times myself. Drowning in a sea of chaos. And the particular brand of chaos you instigated yesterday was of a sort I will not, I repeat, will not tolerate under any circumstances. I regard an assault on a member of my staff as an assault not only on the officer concerned, but as an attack on the very fabric of our establishment, of our authority, of our system of criminal justice which is our only bulwark against … against…\n\nPRISON OFFICER: Mindless anarchy and mob rule, sir!\n\nGOVERNOR: Thank you, officer!\n\nPRISON OFFICER: Sir! Stand to attention, Morrison!\n\nPRISONER: Yes, sir.\n\nPRISON OFFICER: Silence!\n\nGOVERNOR: Yes, mindless anarchy and mob rule. Therefore I have no hesitation, in view of our…Aw fuck it! All this sanctimonious patter’s fine for the cameras and the Scottish Office but you cannae talk to scum like that, they’d think you were a poof or something – anyway, I’m new here and I don’t want anybody thinking that they can take advantage. I’ve got to make it crystal clear to all and sundry that I’m the Governor. I’m the daddy in here, biggest barn on the block, as hard as… as… as…\n\nPRISON OFFICER: A very hard thing, sir?\n\nGOVERNOR: Aye, that’ll do. The likes of him would never respect you otherwise. Okay then, big man, fill me in?\n\nPRISON OFFICER: Sir?\n\nGOVERNOR: Tell me what happened. Slag’s going to solitary anyway.\n\nPRISON OFFICER: Right then sir, for the record. I was handing out the mail and I called out this one’s name and he went for us.\n\nGOVERNOR: Oh, did he now? This wee bastard thinks he can gub one of my officers, does he? Do you, Morrison? Do you really think you can get away with it? Do you?\n\nPRISONER: Sir. No I don’t, sir.\n\nGOVERNOR: So would you care to attempt to explain yourself to me?\n\nPRISONER: Well sir – I was in the hall – mail came round – and this officer shouts us over – says it’s a “Dear John” – and – sir …\n\nGOVERNOR: A “Dear John”? Is this correct, officer?\n\nPRISON OFFICER: Yes, sir.\n\nGOVERNOR: A “Dear John” prisoner Morrison!\n\nPRISONER: Sir?\n\nGOVERNOR: What’s your name, Morrison?\n\nPRISONER: Sir, my name sir? It’s Morrison, sir.\n\nPRISON OFFICER: The prisoner is being disrespectful, sir. Shall I. … ?\n\nGOVERNOR: Not just yet officer. I meant your first name, Morrison.\n\nPRISONER: Sir, my first name, sir?\n\nPRISON OFFICER: His name is John, sir. John Morrison.\n\nGOVERNOR: I see. Get him out of here. Oh, and officer …\n\nPRISON OFFICER: Sir?\n\nGOVERNOR: No accidents, please. Just re-acquaint the prisoner with our regulations.\n\nPRISON OFFICER: As you say, sir.\n\n[Prisoner is led away]\n\nGOVERNOR: A new broom. I’ll show them who’s in charge here. There will be no fucking about in my jail!\n\n[Prison officer strikes prisoner, who falls]\n\nScene 12\n\n[Woman and man seated at table]\n\nMAN: Any other mail?\n\nWOMAN: Just bills. That bloody Poll Tax as well. I’m no paying it anyway. Neither is anybody in the street.\n\nMAN: You tell them.\n\nWOMAN: That tea’s like tar.\n\nMAN: It always is.\n\nWOMAN: You were always complaining about mine being weak, too.\n\nMAN: Hot water knocked stupid.\n\nWOMAN: It was you that was knocked stupid.\n\nMAN: You’re right there.\n\nWOMAN: I was always right.\n\nMAN: How’s Daniel?\n\nWOMAN: The usual. Never in. Takes after his father.\n\nMAN: Tell him I’ll take after him.\n\nWOMAN: You’d have to be fast to catch him. He’s like a bloody whippet.\n\nMAN: Sure, I raced whippets for years, did I not?\n\nWOMAN: I’m getting a new bed from the social.\n\nMAN: What are you telling me that for?\n\nWOMAN: I thought you’d be pleased. The springs were coming through on the old one.\n\nMAN: Happy days.\n\nWOMAN: It’s nearly time.\n\nMAN: It flies when you’re enjoying yourself.\n\nWOMAN: The weather’s been a lot better. In Glasgow anyway.\n\nMAN: It’s been miserable here. What I’ve seen of it.\n\nPRISON OFFICER: Finish off your visits now please!\n\n[The couple clasp hands and stare at one another]\n\nScene 13\n\nPRISONER: They fucking beasts. Hanging’s too good for them. Fucking castration, that’s what they want. Let’s fucking riot and fling them off the roof along with the slates. Scumbags. Slags. Rides. Fucking perverts. Them and the grasses. Rapists. Muggers. Fucking low-lifes. Over the bannisters with them. That one Tarzan’d a wee boy. Him there raped a lassie then beat her to a pulp. We’ll be the fucking judge and jury with they bastards. Take a razor to their balls. A sheet with a knot in it. Under the ear. Watch them kicking, and screaming, and shiteing their trousers. Fucking vermin.\n\nScene 14\n\nWOMAN: You’ve got that look in your eyes again. It’s getting stronger every time I come. What’s this place done to you that you can’t even trust your wife? You keep saying I don’t understand. Of course I don’t. How could I. But I am trying. I am trying to see what they have done to you that’s making you a stranger to me. My eyes are searching yours, looking for some sort of sign, but the shutters are down. I can’t see past the “Trust no-one” signals that are flashing as strong as the love that once used to be there. Of course I long for someone at night, to wake up in the morning and feel wanted instead of lonely, to love and be loved. But you won’t believe me when I tell you again and again it’s only you I yearn for. Have these bastards degraded you so much that you don’t feel human any more? That you don’t believe I could still love you as wholly and as consuming as before. The mental barriers are closing down slowly, bit by bit until one day I know I will be told to go away. It’s you that’s leaving me not the other way round. I hope those bastards can sleep at night, cos I can’t.\n\nScene 15\n\n[Psycho in Solitary – poem by Tommy Campbell]\n\nPRISONER: I wish I had a spider\n\nI’d feed it your guts\n\nFucking wee fly bastards\n\nI’ve never liked you much\n\nSplat!\n\nThere goes another one\n\nZap!

Keeping him locked up. It’s no right. He wisnae bad, he was just sick with the drugs. And to see the weans and that, the way they were. They had nothing. Stealing for need, is that a crime? Christ, what chance did he have? Keeping him locked away, it’s no right, so it’s no. That’s all he ever did. Folk that wanted to turn the key on him. In the cupboard under the stairs. Locked in the headmaster’s office. Stuck in the jail for Christ’s sake! Just a wean too, so he is. Jails for weans, for Christ’s sake.\n\nStill jail weans now too, so they do. They do, you know. or maybe we do, you know. In our names. You used to only have to be late in, in the old days, and they could jail you, so they could. Call you a whore and jail you. Well, they cannae do that now. And one day there’ll be no more jail, so they’ll no. One day, somebody up there, it’s going to dawn on them. And they’re going to have to say, “That was barbaric that, wasn’t it? How could they have done that to folk? That was terrible, that”, they’ll say, “bit short-sighted”, they’ll say, “in the long run”. Aye, one day, and I’ll tell you again, there’ll be no more jail. “They couldn’t have known about it”, they’ll say. “Jailed more young folk than anyone else in Europe. It’s hard to believe. No the Scots. They were well-educated. Had a sense of nationhood, so they did. They probably didn’t realise. Aye, that’s it. It was probably kept secret from them”. “Or maybe they were just feart, somebody else will say, “you know, temporarily lost the use of their imagination… and their compassion… desensitised to the horror… it’s called sensory deprivation, you know…”\n\nPRISONER: You fucking looking at, eh? What are you fucking looking at. What do you know, eh? What do you care? Who the fuck are you? See me. I’ve done more time than Big Ben. I’ve had more porridge than Goldilocks. I’ve done more solitary than Howard Hughes. What do you know about me, eh? Do you want to welcome me back into your community? Oh, welcome home, son. All is forgiven. Well, answer me this.

I didn’t know who he was or where “here” was. It slowly became clear, while Billy spoke nineteen-to-the-dozen, that he was in prison, doing life: in HMP Barlinnie Special Unit to be precise. We had a mutual friend, Jamie Burns, who had been working with Billy on Glasgow Boy, a play about his life. Jamie had mentioned me as someone Billy might like to know, since my father was from the Calton, my mother from Cowcaddens, and I was from Possilpark, three places Billy knew well. A play I’d co-written with my brother, From the Calton to Catalonia, had been on at the Pearce Institute in Govan in December 1990, and Jamie had been telling Billy about it. Billy was steeped in the Calton – he had been a member of notorious Glasgow gang the Calton Tongs in the 1960s. Something clicked. We were from similar backgrounds, but I was an aspiring academic and Billy was serving a life sentence for murder, as were other inmates of the Special Unit.\n\nI visited the Special Unit the following day, then the following week, then every week for the following year. I was fascinated by Billy’s stories. Looking back now it’s obvious there was a Pip and Magwitch dimension to the relationship, though I didn’t see that at the time: I was too caught up in his endless tales about growing up in Glasgow. I gradually got to know the other inmates and their visitors and learned about the lives of these lifers. Because of my commitment, my education, and my background, the Governor, Dan Gunn, asked if I’d like to act as a writer-in-residence for a few months. The Unit was famous for attracting people from the arts and Dan felt that since I’d been in the Unit so much and knew the “community” – as the inmates plus staff were called – I would be a good person to work with them on developing some writing projects.\n\nMy first task was organising an arts festival and exhibition in the Unit in December 1991. Visitors included artists and writers as well as families and friends and at that event I got to know Irvine Allan, a final year drama student at the RSAMD (Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama). I told him about the plan to put a play on at Mayfest, Glasgow’s community arts festival, a prison drama based on discussions I’d had with Billy over the previous months. Irvine came up to the Special Unit in January with a group of drama students keen to collaborate, to listen and to learn. That led to the spark of an idea for a collectively-written musical drama, No Mean Fighter. The drama students in the cast were joined by Special Unit visitor James McHendrie, a talented writer and actor who brought a streetwise directness to the table.\n\nNo Mean Fighter had begun to take shape around conversations with a group of Special Unit inmates who had served time in Peterhead Prison during the riots and dirty protests there in 1987. Billy had heard that John Maclean, the Scottish socialist leader, had been kept in the same cell as him, back in 1916. That was the seed for the play – a latter-day inmate finding a prison diary that linked the past to the present. We wanted to explore the links between a notable political prisoner and historical figure like Maclean and the conditions that persisted in Peterhead into the 1980s. Social class was a factor in the makeup of prisons, so the politics was there to begin with. Maclean, the renowned Red Clydesider, had famously said, “I would rather be immediately put to death than condemned to a life sentence in Peterhead.” His experiences there seemed to echo those I spoke to who had been incarcerated there. We learned that Maclean was kept out of circulation in prison. He complained of his food being tampered with, and of being constantly fed false information by the authorities about his family and friends.\n\nPeterhead Prison, built in 1888, had its roots in an 1881 report by the Committee on the Employment of Convicts which declared that the “most likely prospect for benefitting the shipping and fishing interests of the country at large and at the same time profitably employing convicts is the construction of a harbour of refuge at Peterhead in Aberdeen shire.” Peterhead was designated a General Convict Prison for male prisoners sentenced to a minimum of 5 years.\n\nThe premise of the play is that two prisoners, John Maclean and another, are in solitary confinement in Peterhead in the same cell at different times. Their experiences are told through speeches, poems, songs and voices. We also hear the views of other prisoners, visitors and a prison officer, interwoven with extracts from the fictitious diary of Maclean. One scene early in the play captures the voices of the women who make the journey from Glasgow to Peterhead to visit their menfolk and distils the history of the prison and its location:\n\nScene 4\n\n1st WOMAN: They used to send them to Australia. Had them building roads and railways hell-knows-where.\n\n2nd WOMAN: Now they’ve got them caged at the other end of the country.\n\n3rd WOMAN: Getting there from Glasgow is a nightmare. Travelling all day. And for what? To look at a broken man through a glass partition.\n\n1st WOMAN: A couple of hours once a month. Twelve hours on a bus for that.\n\n2nd WOMAN: They built the prison there so that the prisoners could build the harbour.\n\n3rd WOMAN: Now the harbour’s built, and the quarry’s closed, but the men are still there.\n\n1st WOMAN: Isn’t there something in Glasgow they could build?\n\n2nd WOMAN: Like houses.\n\n3rd WOMAN: They don’t build houses anymore, just jails.\n\n1st WOMAN: They’ve made prisoners of us too.\n\n2nd WOMAN: Breaking up families.\n\n3rd WOMAN: Like stones in a quarry. Smashed to pieces. Good for nothing but breaking glass.\n\n1st WOMAN: Dirty protests.\n\n2nd WOMAN: Hunger strikes.\n\n3rd WOMAN: Solitary confinement.\n\n1st WOMAN: Rooftop protests.\n\n2nd WOMAN: Ugly suicides.\n\n3rd WOMAN: Cries for help we never hear.\n\n1st WOMAN: Voices in the wilderness.\n\n2nd WOMAN: Like a seabird in a storm.\n\n3rd WOMAN: They come out worse than they went in.\n\n1st WOMAN: On an elastic band.\n\n2nd WOMAN: No future.\n\n3rd WOMAN: Shell-shocked.\n\n1st WOMAN: Further away from us than ever.\n\n2nd WOMAN: Pacing up and down.\n\n3rd WOMAN: Turning outside in.\n\n1st WOMAN: They had them making nets. To catch fish.\n\n2nd WOMAN: Cold eyes staring into space.\n\nTOGETHER: Gutted!\n\nThe writing team included Kate Dickie, Billy Elliott, John Gordon, James McHendrie and myself, with poems by Tommy Campbell and Hugh MacDiarmid. All the songs were written and performed by Derek Lang, with lyrics to “John Maclean” by Billy Elliott, based on a melody by Joe Kidd. I was script editor and contributed the words to the title song. Cast improvisations directed by Irvine also fed into the final script, and there were extracts from printed sources including The Gateway Exchange “Independent Inquiry into the Peterhead Riots”, The 1990 Scottish Prison Service Report, a report from the European Committee for the Prevention Of Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, John Maclean’s “Condemned from the Dock” speech, and James D. Young’s John Maclean: Clydeside Socialist. With so many fragments in front of him, Irvine had to be much more than a director. He proved to be an expert tailor who took the patchwork of speeches and songs given to him and sewed them into a magnificent banner. Irvine reflected on the creative process at the time:\n\n“Some say great plays come through individual genius. The making of No Mean Fighter […] has been a collaboration involving many people in research, writing, improvising and song-writing. It was my job to find a shape for the myriad of ideas, scripts, poems and songs which emerged, and to harness the creative energies of all involved. During this process I have tried to circumvent the strict divisions of labour which normally apply in the creation of a play, by allowing all those who wanted to contribute the chance to do so.”\n\nTheatre, like all the arts, is full of egos, but there was something about this play and this project that made a diverse and strong-willed set of individuals want to work together and sink their egos into the collective pool. I mentioned cast improvisations. One cast member, drama student Kate Dickie, contributed to the script at a crucial stage when we were looking for a series of intercut monologues before the big ending. Kate came in with a standout speech that she performed, one that nailed the inside/outside relationships that the play sought to explore:\n\n“WOMAN: You’ve got that look in your eyes again. It’s getting stronger every time I come. What’s this place done to you that you can’t even trust your wife? You keep saying I don’t understand. Of course I don’t. How could I. But I am trying. I am trying to see what they have done to you that’s making you a stranger to me. My eyes are searching yours, looking for some sort of sign, but the shutters are down. I can’t see past the ‘Trust no-one’ signals that are flashing as strong as the love that once used to be there. Of course I long for someone at night, to wake up in the morning and feel wanted instead of lonely, to love and be loved. But you won’t believe me when I tell you again and again it’s only you I yearn for. Have these bastards degraded you so much that you don’t feel human anymore? That you don’t believe I could still love you as wholly and as consuming as before. The mental barriers are closing down slowly, bit by bit until one day I know I will be told to go away. It’s you that’s leaving me not the other way round. I hope those bastards can sleep at night, cos I can’t.”\n\nBecause it was a drama and not a policy document we had different voices offering different perspectives. For example, in one scene a prison officer sick of dirty protests and violence among the inmates gets it off his chest:\n\n“PRISON OFFICER: Scumbags the lot of them. No loyalty among thieves. Sell one another for a cigarette. Too many bleeding hearts these days. What about the victims? What about their families? There’s open visits at the cemetery. They do it to their own kind as well. No fucking loyalty. Colleague of mine lost an eye. Some monster with a coat hanger. Can’t trust them with anything. If they’re no wanking and working-out, then they’re up to something. Okay, so I’m bitter. But that disnae mean I’m bad, does it? We’re not all brutes, ye know. We’re not the way we’re made out to be. I take my kids to the pictures. To the park. I prefer the park. I like open spaces. Truth be told, I’m a bit of a fresh air fiend. A bit of a one for the great outdoors. Well, you don’t get much fresh air in the tin pail, do you? Not when there’s people emptying their pisspots o’er you. Kicked a young fella to death, so they did. Nobody lifted a finger. They won’t grass. Grassing’s worse than murder in their book. If they want the prison population reduced and our job made easier, then give the public what they want. Bring back the noose. The only place they bastards should be kicking is at the end of a rope.”\n\nThe voices of prisoners are heard too – tender and paranoid in visits, frightened and threatening in solitary, angry and dangerous out of their cells, addressing the audience directly on one occasion:\n\n“PRISONER: You fucking looking at, eh? What are you fucking looking at. What do you know, eh? What do you care? Who the fuck are you? See me. I’ve done more time than Big Ben. I’ve had more porridge than Goldilocks. I’ve done more solitary than Howard Hughes. What do you know about me, eh? Do you want to welcome me back into your community? Oh, welcome home, son. All is forgiven. Well, answer me this. What fucking community? Eh? What fucking community? Community care? Community charge? Community policing? Community service? That’s all that’s left of your fucking community! Reform? Rehabilitation? Resettlement? Care? Who cares? Reform yourself, ya slag! Rehabilitate yourself, ya bastard! Resettle you, ya hopeless case! It’s got to be bad in here. Sure it’s bad in here. It’s got to look bad in here. That way it doesn’t look so bad out there. Am I right? Just tell me! Where do you live? How much freedom have you really got? How much time? How much space? How many visitors? How do you sleep? What’s your number? I don’t envy you. I don’t need your sympathy. The only place I want your bleeding heart is on the end of a fucking skewer. What are you fucking looking at, eh? Don’t look at me. Look at you. There’s your fucking prisoner! You’re doing life, ya mug. You’re doing a seventy stretch, but you don’t even know it! Who rattled your cage?”\n\nWe formed a company around the play called Cat. A, named after Category A prisoners, “those that would pose the most threat to the public, the police or national security should they escape”. In other words, the kind of men who ended up in the Special Unit. The cast – Tony Curran, Steve Cooper (aka Stephen Clyde), James McHendrie, Derek Lang, Carol Rafferty, Claire Miller, Suzie Fannin, Kate Dickie, Stephen McDowall, Michael Connolly and Derek Munn – did an outstanding job, putting in performances that lit up the stark set, and we had a hugely supportive crew in Gillian Hamilton, Fraser Kerr, Colin Begg, Gary Brunton, Suzie Fannin, Mark Stevenson, and Jake McIlvenna. Pavla Milcova and Mark Stevenson took some striking photos.\n\nThe play was performed first at Mayfest in 1992, with a run at the Arches Theatre as well as a community and prison tour. Joyce McMillan’s review in The Guardian on 8th May was the first sign that we had something special on our hands:\n\n“The Category A theatre company’s No Mean Fighter at the Arches Theatre – a devised piece by a team of five writers and a 12-strong cast, including professional performers and people with direct experience of the Scottish prison system – is one of those shows which could have been a self-indulgent shambles. Instead it emerges as a powerful, strikingly well-acted polemic against the regime in Scotland’s top security prison at Peterhead, using the words of the great Glasgow political activist John Maclean – himself a prisoner in Peterhead 70 years ago – to expose the brutalisation and agony the system imposes on prisoners, their families, and prison officers alike.” (1).\n\nA review in Scotland on Sunday two weeks later was equally enthusiastic:\n\n“No Mean Fighter has the directedness and strength of a protest song. It is a series of scenes, monologues and ballads about prison life which have been tightly meshed into an emphatic performance by the director, Irvine Allan, a final year student at the RSAMD. […] The issues are familiar enough: the brutality of the system breeding monsters amongst both prisoners and staff; the suffering of wives, mothers and girlfriends torn between two worlds; the inhuman stupidity of society’s sledgehammer solution to crime. The performance rises above the level of documentary, however, creatively channelling its anger into expressive, vehement theatre.” (2)\n\nAfter Mayfest and a tour of community and prison venues the play went to the De Marco Gallery for the Edinburgh Fringe Festival. The play was extremely well-received in Edinburgh. Flagged as a Critics’ Choice in The Sunday Times on 30th August, it justified its billing, winning a Scotsman Fringe First for Outstanding New Production. I was credited as Project Co-ordinator and got my name on the much sought after Fringe First wee bronze plaque (now lost, but the memories are golden). John Linklater’s review of the play says a great deal both about the production and the background against which it was staged:\n\n“Employing an effective spareness of set and lighting, Cat A Theatre Company recreate the degrading world of Peterhead Prison with individual inmates occupying small square pallets spread like rafts around the open stage. There are no iron bars or cages to introduce the false notion that the lives portrayed in this collaborative piece, and the issues raised by it, can be conveniently dubbed up and forgotten. Society imprisons itself if it ignores the inhumanity of its penal system, and you can quote no less a source than Churchill to that effect. […] The impressive thing about Cat A’s treatment is that it focuses strongly on the damaging effects of imprisonment for wives and family, and its emphasis on the men’s responsibilities in this area is just one of the strands which saves the piece from polemic. Neither is the piece blind to the needs of its audience. Songs performed by the ensemble, with Derek Lang on guitar, are of high quality, and there are some splendid theatrical touches. The women confront the audience with their grievances. The men throw theirs down in a game of cards. The riot scene at the end is loud enough to drown out the bulldozers outside on Blackfriars Street, thoughtfully provided yesterday by Lothian Region for road operations in the final week of the Festival.” (3)\n\nReflecting on Festival highlights in a Guardian review a few days later, Joanna Coles applauded “the excellent No Mean Fighter by Category A”. (4) On the same note, Jackie McGlone, writing in The Herald pointed to the play as a dramatic high spot: “It has been a vintage year for high-voltage performance, with the acting honours going to Cat A’s powerful ensemble drama No Mean Fighter”. (5) A further run followed in the spring of 1993, with dates at The Tron Theatre in Glasgow and The Lemon tree in Aberdeen, as well another community venue and prison tour. That tour was accompanied by an exhibition with research by Julia Allan and layout by Celine McIlmunn and Gerry Clark.\n\nDuring the spring 1993 tour of the play Irvine was interviewed by his former mentor George Byatt, known for This Man Craig, The Troubleshooters, and Sutherland’s Law. Irvine told George: “There has got to be something wrong with a society where you can go to prison for months if you strip the lead off a roof but can get a knighthood if you strip the assets of a company.” George thought the play Irvine had woven out of workshops was a form of political theatre that deserved a wider audience and praised the new company for its social awareness and class politics: “No Mean Fighter with its authentic and committed writing, passionate acting and powerful presentation, lives up to the company’s aims as described by Irvine Allan. If any group deserves to inherit the mantle of John McGrath’s 7:84 (Scotland), it is this one.” (6)\n\nOne of the most insightful reviews of No Mean Fighter was penned by Stewart Hennessey, who homed in on the play’s movement between political drama, prison drama and domestic drama:\n\n“This impressionistic drama, whose seven writing credits include inmates of Barlinnie Special Unit, works as a hard-hitting fast-paced catharsis. However, the in-your-face action and emotional outpourings don’t always square tidily with the wide ranging attitudinising which underpins the play. The unrelenting energy, while pulling the play along at an entertaining rate, is less persuasive and moving than the tragedy implicit in the love-sex dynamics. The first-rate performers (including students from the RSAMD), imbue the visiting scenes with an almost awesome futility. Lonely, impoverished wives waiting years for degraded men, amid stifling suspicion and bitterness, lend eloquence to the play’s one consistent and indisputable contention; isn’t it enough punishment to lose liberty? Aside from gratifying the base urge for revenge, what purpose does it serve to treat men as animals? And why be surprised if they then leave jail ready to commit more crimes?” (7)\n\nEqually insightful and even more incisive was the response of Ajay Close, who went to the heart of the play’s tensions and contradictions in a review as hard-hitting as the drama it described:\n\n“Politics encloses No Mean Fighter like electrified wire, leaving the audience two choices: inside or outside. Only fools and masochists sit on the fence. Cat. A is one of the success stories of the Barlinnie Special Unit, a theatre company whose purpose is to ‘agitate, educate and inform.’ Its current concern is the brutal prison regime which provoked the Peterhead riots, and this stirring piece of theatre certainly makes an unanswerable case for change. But by placing John Maclean, Glasgow’s Bolshevist consul, at the heart of the drama, the argument goes beyond penal reform into social analysis, identifying crime as a product of capitalism and projecting a utopian future where no one need lose their liberty. Sympathisers who wimp out of the complete package are liable to find themselves straddling 1,500 volts. Devised by inmates of the special unit and drama students at the RSAMD, the play is a collage of songs and scenes which betrays its collaborative origins by never quite forming an organic whole. This is both its failure and its strength, allowing the polemic to be subverted by odd moments of raw truthfulness. Tony Curran, all milk white skin and sinew, eyes glittering like some medieval martyr, does his best to bring Maclean’s words to life, but they’re no match for the best of the contemporary dialogue. The most powerful scenes in the play concern the pressure prison places on emotional relationships, the interplay of love and resentment, the longed for visits passed in bickering or silence. Both Stephen Cooper and James McHendrie make uncomfortably plausible hardmen, ‘saft as shite’ with their women until crossed, then petrifying into fist clenching domestic tyrants. Archetypes abound in this production: hardmen with soft centres, feisty, yet self sacrificing wives. It’s easy to dismiss this as crude stereotyping, but it is a cliche of life, not art. For me it provides one of the play’s more interesting insights: the lifeline between myth and powerlessness, the sustaining but ultimately limiting comfort of the old roles. The Glasgow hardman is simultaneously deplored and celebrated, at once th"
