        "text": "Who Is the Current Governor of Pennsylvania?\n\nJosh Shapiro, is the 48th person to hold the title of Governor of Pennsylvania, and the current governor of the Keystone State too. Pennsylvania, which holds the distinction of being the second state in the U.S., is also home to approximately 13 million people. Pennsylvania governors should also be well acquainted with the attention that comes with governing one of the more prominent states on the political landscape. Pennsylvania governors have an important role, both locally and nationally, but recent history suggests a strong future for this historic State. That is also good news for the current and future governors to take the mantle and for the people of Pennsylvania.\n\nWhat Political Party Has Had More Governors?\n\nA common battleground state during the Presidential elections, the entire nation is often paying attention to the state of Pennsylvania. The party that wins the governorship in Pennsylvania often goes reflects the general voting patterns of the majority of the country's voters. Pennsylvania's economic status is often viewed as a litmus test for the political party in power. As a result of this battleground status, there has been a fairly balanced number of Republican and Democratic governors. Before Shapiro took office in 2023, Democrat Tom Wolf served two terms, following one-term Republican governor Tom Corbett.\n\nWho Was the First Governor of Pennsylvania?\n\nBecause Pennsylvania was the second U.S. state, it has a long history of governors. Thomas Wharton was the state's first governor from 1776 to 1778. The most famous governor is the state's sixth; Benjamin Franklin served as the governor of Pennsylvania from 1785 to 1788."
