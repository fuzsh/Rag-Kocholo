        "text": "FIRMLY ESTABLISHED\n\nIt gives me a deep sense of pleasure to write about this gentleman. Not only have I known him all my life but realizing the challenges he dealt with throughout his life made me admire him even more. Edwin was born the seventh child of William Francis Wilson 3rd, and Ismay Winifred Rebecca Wilson (Dill) he had 4 sisters and 4 brothers he is from a family of mixed heritage and deeply religious. His grand mother was Marion Calder DeMinks Ferrier and grand father John Thomas Dill. On his Wilson side his grandmother Agnes Louise Wilson(Smith) his grandfather William F. Wilson 2nd. was the builder and Lay reader of the St. Monica’s Church in North Village, his mother’s family were originally stanch worshippers of Christ Church in Devonshire. His lineage is a mixture of Peruvian Indian, Portuguese, African and European.\n\nEdwin was born July 1935 and enjoyed the first ten years of his life just like any other young boy, he was seldom seen without a book in his hands. At the early age of 11 years he had an industrial accident while his father was building his home when Edwin lost his right hand in a Cement Mixer a few weeks later he fell and broke his left arm and for at least three months he had to rely on his mother to do everything for him. This became a bigger challenge because he had a teacher who could or would not grasp the fact that he could no longer write with a hand that he did not have and had to learn to write with his left hand, in stepped mom and got that matter settled. Edwin though very self conscious of his disability excelled in his studies and in each year at Central he came head of his class. He was a studious person and without a doubt was determined to excel in whatever he attempted to do. He attended Sandy’s Secondary School and later went on to Wilberforce University with such friends as Cecil and John Smith, Reginald Burrows all branching out of the Vernon Temple A.M.E. Church Bermuda. He was blest with the gift of gab; and through many trials, God guided him to his future. He became a musician, learning the harmonica and sang with the St. Monica’s Junior Choir and with Nellie Swan performers. He became a Theatrical performer and performed overseas and in Bermuda. He earned his B.A. degree in Education from Wilberforce and received his M .A. degree in Education Administration at Michigan State University. Although he changed his major from studying the Ministry he became the preacher in the family. His first teaching job was at the school where he studied, Sandy’s Secondary where he taught English Literature and Drama he eventually became Deputy Head before retiring and going into another Government field."
