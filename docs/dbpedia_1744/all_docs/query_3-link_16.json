        "text": "SUMMARY\n\nThe following list includes all governors, lieutenant governors, presidents of the Council, and other officials who are known to have served as chief executive of Virginia, whether by appointment, by election, or as temporary substitutes for the regularly chosen executives. The list includes those who held the royal commission as governor but did not go to Virginia, as well as those who, under a variety of titles, actually discharged the governor’s duties in Virginia. Gaps in the records make it impossible to give an exact date for the beginning and end of every administration. Where there is any uncertainty, an approximate date is given. Beginning with the administration of Governor Henry Lee in 1791, party affiliations are included at the end of the service date to reflect the governor’s party affiliation at the time of election. In addition, life dates and place of residence at the time of election are also included. If the area of residence is now an independent city but was not at the time of election, the county is also included (for example: Winchester, Frederick County).\n\nGovernors under the Virginia Company of London, 1607–1624\n\nThe chief executive of Virginia during the first two years of the colony’s existence was the president of the Council, who was chosen by the Council at Jamestown.

No governor could serve more than three consecutive terms or be elected again until after an interval of four years. When the office became vacant by death or resignation, the president or senior member of the Council of State acted as governor until the assembly was able to choose a successor. The Constitution of 1830 left the election of the governor with the General Assembly but changed the term of office to three years with no eligibility for immediate reelection. Since the adoption of the Constitution of 1851, the voters have elected the governors for four-year terms with no eligibility for immediate reelection.

Smith did not formally surrender his office until May 20.\n\nGovernor under the Restored Government, 1861–1865\n\nDuring the American Civil War (1861–1865), Virginia had two state governments, one at Richmond, under the Confederate States of America; and the other, first at Wheeling, (until West Virginia became a state in 1863) and then at Alexandria, under the United States of America.\n\nFrancis Harrison Pierpont (1814–1899), from Marion County (now West Virginia), governor of Restored government at Wheeling, June 20, 1861–August 28, 1863; governor of the Restored government at Alexandria, August 28, 1863–May 9, 1865, Unionist.\n\nGovernors under the Commonwealth, 1865–\n\nBetween 1934 and 1958 the terms of the commonwealth’s executive officers expired the day prior to the inauguration of their successors; thus for a twenty-four-year period the dates of term expiration and initiation do not agree. Until the General Assembly in 1956 remedied the discrepancy, with the voters’ later approval of a constitutional amendment to take effect in 1958, Virginia was without an executive administration for approximately a half-day each inaugural year. The official line of gubernatorial succession differs from the complete list because the official count includes only those governors who were elected by convention (1776), the General Assembly, or by the voters.\n\nFrancis Harrison Pierpont (1814–1899), from Marion County (now West Virginia), provisional governor, May 9, 1865–April 4, 1868, Republican.\n\nHenry Horatio Wells (1823–1900), a native of New York but resident in Alexandria County, provisional governor, April 4, 1868–September 21, 1869, Republican.\n\nGilbert Carlton Walker (1833–1885), a native of New York but resident in the city of Norfolk, provisional governor, September 21–December 31, 1869; governor, January 1, 1870–January 1, 1874, Republican.\n\nJames Lawson Kemper (1823–1895), from Madison County, January 1, 1874–January 1, 1878, Conservative.\n\nFrederick William Mackey Holliday (1828–1899), from Frederick County, January 1, 1878–January 1, 1882, Conservative.\n\nWilliam Evelyn Cameron (1842–1927), from the city of Petersburg, January 1, 1882–January 1, 1886, Readjuster.\n\nFitzhugh Lee (1835–1905), from Stafford County, January 1, 1886–January 1, 1890, Democrat.\n\nPhilip Watkins McKinney (1832–1899), from Buckingham County, January 1, 1890–January 1, 1894, Democrat.\n\nCharles Triplett O’Ferrall (1840–1905), from Rockingham County, January 1, 1894–January 1, 1898, Democrat.\n\nJames Hoge Tyler (1846–1925), from Pulaski County, January 1, 1898–January 1, 1902, Democrat.\n\nAndrew Jackson Montague (1862–1937), from the city of Danville, January 1, 1902–February 1, 1906, Democrat.\n\nClaude Augustus Swanson (1862–1939), from Pittsylvania County, February 1, 1906–February 1, 1910, Democrat.\n\nWilliam Hodges Mann (1843–1927), from Nottoway County, February 1, 1910–February 1, 1914, Democrat.\n\nHenry Carter Stuart (1855–1933), from Russell County, February 1, 1914–February 1, 1918, Democrat.\n\nWestmoreland Davis (1859–1942), from Loudoun County, February 1, 1918–February 1, 1922, Democrat.\n\nElbert Lee Trinkle (1876–1939), from Wythe County, February 1, 1922–February 1, 1926, Democrat.\n\nHarry Flood Byrd (1887–1966), from the city of Winchester, February 1, 1926–January 15, 1930, Democrat.\n\nJohn Garland Pollard (1871–1937), from the city of Williamsburg, January 15, 1930–January 16, 1934, Democrat.\n\nGeorge Campbell Peery (1873–1952), from Tazewell County, January 17, 1934–January 18, 1938, Democrat.\n\nJames Hubert Price (1882–1943), from the city of Richmond, January 19, 1938–January 20, 1942, Democrat.\n\nColgate Whitehead Darden Jr. (1897–1981), from the city of Norfolk, January 21, 1942–January 15, 1946, Democrat.\n\nWilliam Munford Tuck (1896–1983), from South Boston, Halifax County, January 16, 1946–January 17, 1950, Democrat.\n\nJohn Stewart Battle (1890–1972), from the city of Charlottesville, January 18, 1950–January 19, 1954, Democrat.\n\nThomas Bahnson Stanley (1890–1970), from Henry County, January 20, 1954–January 11, 1958, Democrat.\n\nJames Lindsay Almond Jr. (1898–1986), from the city of Roanoke, January 11, 1958–January 13, 1962, Democrat.\n\nAlbertis Sydney Harrison Jr. (1907–1995), from Brunswick County, January 13, 1962–January 15, 1966, Democrat.\n\nMills Edwin Godwin Jr. (1914–1999), from Nansemond County (now the city of Suffolk), January 15, 1966–January 17, 1970, Democrat.\n\nAbner Linwood Holton Jr. (1923–2021), from the city of Roanoke, January 17, 1970–January 12, 1974, Republican.\n\nMills Edwin Godwin Jr. (1914–1999), from the city of Suffolk, January 12, 1974–January 14, 1978, Republican.\n\nJohn Nichols Dalton (1931–1986), from the city of Radford, January 14, 1978–January 16, 1982, Republican.\n\nCharles Spittal Robb (1939– ), from Fairfax County, January 16, 1982–January 11, 1986, Democrat.\n\nGerald Lee Baliles (1940–2019), from the city of Richmond, January 11, 1986–January 13, 1990, Democrat.\n\nLawrence Douglas Wilder (1931– ), from the city of Richmond, January 13, 1990–January 15, 1994, Democrat.\n\nGeorge Felix Allen (1953– ), from Albemarle County, January 15, 1994–January 17, 1998, Republican.\n\nJames Stuart Gilmore III (1949– ), from the city of Richmond, January 17, 1998–January 12, 2002, Republican.\n\nMark Robert Warner (1954– ), from the city of Alexandria, January 12, 2002–January 14, 2006, Democrat.\n\nTimothy Michael Kaine (1958– ), from the city of Richmond, January 14, 2006–January 16, 2010, Democrat.\n\nRobert Francis McDonnell (1954– ), from the city of Virginia Beach, January 16, 2010–January 11, 2014, Republican.\n\nTerence Richard McAuliffe (1957– ), from Fairfax County, January 11, 2014–January 13, 2018, Democrat.\n\nRalph Shearer Northam (1959– ), from the city of Norfolk, January 13, 2018–January 15, 2022, Democrat.\n\nGlenn Allen Youngkin (1966– ), from Fairfax County, January 15, 2022– , Republican."
