        "text": "Summary: Edwin Sydney Stuart was very active in the Republican Party and Pennsylvania politics. He served as a Philadelphia select councilman, delegate to the Republican national conventions, mayor of Philadelphia, 1891-1895, and governor of Pennsylvania, 1907-1911. His business interests included bookselling with Leary's Bookstore (later renamed Leary, Stuart, and Co.), and then directing Bell Telephone Company of Pennsylvania. The bulk of the collection is correspondence, 1886-1905. Some of this material is on Stuart's business, Leary's Bookstore; the majority, however, covers his political activities as a member of Republican organizations, as a select councilman, and as mayor of Philadelphia. Some of the issues are: Stalwart Republicanism, powers of favorable press, city improvements, especially street pavements, and political loyalty over business qualifications. John Wanamaker, Matthew Quay, and Simon Cameron are among Stuart's influential constituents. Business and political papers comprise a small part of the collection. Invoices, receipts, and insurance information of Leary, Stuart and Co. may be found among the business papers. More significant are the political papers which include endorsements for the mayoralty in support of Stuart. One endorsement comes from \" a group of colored voters from West Philadelphia calling themselves the Edwin S. Stuart Club.\" Invitations and announcements for various social functions complete the collection. Collection also contains correspondence of Edwin Sydney Stuart from January to April 1899."
