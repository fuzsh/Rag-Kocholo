Whilst in prison he studied and gained his Matric, a BA and B.Comm Degrees. Released in 1979 he was subjected to three five year banning orders including house arrest. He joined the African National Congress. Against the prevailing racial laws of S.Africa and at the age of 55 he married a white woman choosing to comply with God’s laws rather than the racial laws.
