        "text": "So, in the summer of 2004, I went to South Africa for two weeks with my then-girlfriend-eventually-ex-wife, Kim.\n\nWe stood in the prison cells that held Nelson Mandela and, earlier, Mohandas Ghandi, where South Africa now has its Supreme Court.\n\nWe toured the home where Mandela lived on the day he was taken and returned to on the day he was released.\n\nWe ate at Wandie’s, which was an ANC hangout in SoWeTo.\n\nWe met Eddie Daniels, who was incarcerated in the political prisoner wing of Robben Island Prison with Mandela for fifteen of the 25 years Nelson was in prison.\n\nWe toured Robben Island prison; Eddie was our tour guide. A thirty minute boat ride through cold, shark infested waters from Capetown, it is a place designed to take you out of the world and rob you of hope.\n\nWe saw the cairn, a pile of rocks, that was started by Mandela on the first day that Apartheid was outlawed. Each day the prisoners added a rock until the day Mandela was released. This is how long it takes between admitting you are wrong and starting to try to make it right: African History and Culture\n\nWe met ministers and government officials who helped Mandela create and execute the Truth And Reconciliation Commission and were permitted to witness up close the successes and failures of that grand plan.\n\nWe were taught the word Ubuntu. “I am who I am, because of you; you are who you are because of me.” Each human is inextricably linked to every other.\n\nWhen I say Nelson Mandela changed the world I mean not just the world; he changed my perspective of it. I am who I am because of him, and Kim, and the other people on our tour, and Eddie, and Reverend Rose, and Reverend M’tini, and you. Having read this, part of who you are is now because of me, and them, and Nelson."
