Mobley’s background in the gospel and jazz worlds, combined with his classical training and skillful Baroque performance make for a unique programme.\n\n“Farewell Songs presents an alternate history of true exchange between ancient Chinese instruments and the early-music practice of the European Baroque ensemble on the shores of Canada in 2024. The texts are taken from Tang dynasty poets Mèng Hàorán and Wang Wei, are freely interpreted and translated into English by the composer. Earlier translations of these texts were used by Gustav Mahler in his song cycle Das Lied von der Erde. Part of the idea in the Farewell Songs is how French and German translations (as available to Mahler 120 years ago), numerous English versions, and now a direct translation of the original Chinese, have created a multiplicity of references and interpretations of the poems. The original Chinese text is narrated by erhu player Lan Tung during the performance, bringing it back to the ‘purity’ of its original intentions. Similarly, the music oscillates between Chinese and Baroque music, and contemporary musical elements; between the accuracy of historic practice and the freely creative (re)-interpretation of it.”- Edward Top, Vancouver, November 2023\n\nThere will be a pre-concert talk at 6:45 p.m. with Alexander Weimann and Edward Top, hosted by Suzie LeBlanc\n\nThis concert is generously sponsored by the RPC Family Foundation and Simon Murphy\n\nPROGRAMME\n\nHenry Purcell\n\nO Solitude\n\nMusic for a while\n\nAn Evening Hymn\n\nRodney Sharman\n\nShe Walks in Beauty\n\nEdward Top\n\nFarewell Songs* WORLD PREMIERE\n\nJazz standards\n\nStrange Fruit\n\nSo in Love\n\nPick yourself up\n\nIn my solitude\n\nAutumn Leaves\n\nPROGRAMME NOTES\n\n“Musick for a while / Shall all your cares beguile . . . ”: when Henry Purcell wrote his incidental music for Oedipus, he no doubt knew how heavy the “cares” treated by the play would turn out be. Theatre-goers of the late seventeenth century had a taste for sensation and spectacle, and John Dryden and Nathaniel Lee (the adapters of Sophocles’ great tragedy) ensured that the remaining acts following Purcell’s music held psychological turmoil and bloody death in store for most of the characters. In spite of all that, though, Purcell’s music does what it says: it provides an interlude, a place of rest, comfort and light, even while it holds the darkness in view. It seems appropriate that English musicians of the time referred to the kind of repeating bass line on which this song is built—and which Purcell cultivated so brilliantly—as a “ground,” because it gives listeners something solid to hold onto or stand on. It is a changing landscape; Purcell’s ability to move almost unnoticed to other key areas and to weave the vocal line in endlessly new ways around the bass makes sure of that. But is also one that remains reassuringly and radiantly the same—for a while.\n\nListening to Purcell’s ground bass songs is like entering a golden moment that seems like it might go on forever and that you wish would never end. In contrast to the predominantly straightforward progressions that were the stock-in-trade of musicians across baroque Europe, Purcell often designed grounds that were extended and tangled while remaining entirely clear in their overall direction. This reflects the songs’ emotional complexity: there is a gentle irony in the fact that “O solitude,” his melancholy but tender hymn to the consolations of being alone, was first published in a 1687 collection entitled Comes Amoris: Or The Companion of Love. (The printers who assembled the collection may have been aware that their title contained a further musical pun: comes had by then entered the language of compositional theory as a name for the musical “companion” or “follower” that answers the first statement of a theme (“dux,” or “leader”) in an imitative composition.) Music, it is implied, provides a time and space for companionship all of its own, even within “solitude.” “An Evening Hymn,” published the following year as the first piece in a collection of sacred music printed by Henry Playford, takes up the theme of a relationship that transcends seclusion, reaffirmed quietly and ecstatically in the moments before sleep.\n\nRodney Sharman’s She Walks in Beauty has a similar twilight quality. An internationally recognized composer and a champion for new music in Canada, Sharman has said that he thinks about composition as the exploration of “sonic images”; here, he surely has in mind the ethereal play of “dark and bright” depicted by Byron’s 1814 love lyric. Sharman originally wrote She Walks in Beauty as a lute song for the experimental soprano Catherine Fern Lewis, another passionate advocate for Canadian contemporary music. He prepared an adaptation for countertenor voice in 2016 specially for Reginald Mobley.\n\nThe mixed glow of old and new captured by Sharman’s work can also be seen in this programme’s blend of baroque and jazz music, two styles that seem sometimes like soul siblings spanning the centuries. Although the products of very different histories, both are harmonically driven, virtuosic but also intensely collaborative, motivated by newfound expressive capabilities of voices and instruments alike. Much as jazz musicians gather a repertoire of “licks” that can be recombined on the spur of the moment, baroque players and composers produced collections of diminution patterns—passaggi—and contrapuntal formulae with which to turn the simplest melodic motions into breathtaking improvisatory flourishes. And whereas musicians of the sixteenth, seventeenth and eighteenth centuries might rely on familiar progressions like the romanesca, bergamasca, passamezzo, and ciaccona as common ground for improvisation, jazz has its own long list of standards, drawn from the blues tradition and the show tunes of the Great American Songbook as well as from the works of jazz composers.\n\nAll extensively recorded and reimagined, this programme’s jazz selections range from witty numbers by Jerome Kern and Dorothy Fields (“Pick Yourself Up,” introduced by Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers in the 1936 movie Swing Time) and Cole Porter (“So in Love,” a sultry hit from the Shakespeare-inspired musical Kiss me, Kate) to blues-inspired, era-defining masterpieces like “Strange Fruit” and Duke Ellington’s “(In my) Solitude,” both of which were powerfully recorded by Billie Holiday. “Strange Fruit” (written by Abel Meeropol, a child of Russian Jewish immigrants who wrote under the pen name “Lewis Allen”) is such an unflinching indictment of racial violence that Holiday’s decision to record it attracted an institutional backlash that changed the course of her life and career; it nevertheless became a fixture of her performances. Joseph Kozma’s “Autumn Leaves,” first heard as Les feuilles mortes with lyrics by the poet Jacques Prévert, is perhaps one of the greatest standards of all and also one of the most baroque in design; it is built on the same recurring harmonic patterns (or sequences) beloved of composers like Antonio Vivaldi.\n\nThe centrepiece of this concert, the world premiere of Edward Top’s Farewell Songs, reimagines another complex story of cultural encounter. Born in the Netherlands, Top has served as composer-in-residence for the VSO (2011-2014), as Head of the Composition Department at the Vancouver Academy of Music and as a lecturer in composition at UBC. Farewell Songs reflects the powerful presence of East Asian culture in Top’s life and music, drawing on classic poetry from the Tang dynasty (618-907) and the sounds of the Chinese erhu, a two-stringed fiddle with similarly ancient roots. Top describes this special commissioned work:\n\n“The Farewell Songs present an alternate history of true exchange between ancient Chinese instruments and the early-music practice of the European Baroque ensemble on the shores of Canada in 2024. In addition, a countertenor sings texts from Tang dynasty poets Mèng Hàorán and Wang Wei. These texts are freely interpreted and translated into English by the composer. Earlier translations of these texts were used by Gustav Mahler in his song cycle Das Lied von der Erde. Part of the idea in the Farewell Songs is how French and German translations (as available to Mahler 120 years ago), numerous English versions, and now a direct Google translation of the original Chinese, have created a multiplicity of references and interpretations of the poems. The original Chinese text is narrated by erhu player Lan Tung during the performance, bringing it back to the ‘purity’ of its original intentions. Similarly, the music oscillates between Chinese and Baroque music, and contemporary musical elements; between the accuracy of historic practice and the freely creative (re)-interpretation of it.” (Edward Top, Vancouver, November 2023)\n\nConnor Page\n\nReginald Mobley, countertenor\n\nNoted for his ‘shimmering voice’ (BachTrack), American countertenor Reginald Mobley is highly sought after for the baroque, classical and modern repertoire.\n\nReginald leads a very prolific career on both sides of the Atlantic. In the United States, where he resides, he became the first ever programming consultant for the Handel & Haydn Society following several years of leading H&H in his community engaging Every Voice concerts.

He has also extensively toured with the Monteverdi Choir and Orchestra under the baton of John-Eliot Gardiner, and more recently performed a series of English music programmes in Germany with the Freiburger Barockorchester under the leadership of Kristian Bezuidenhout.\n\nHis recordings have been received with great critical acclaim, most recently American Originals with Agave Baroque ensemble, recorded with Acis Productions, which has been nominated for a GRAMMY Award, following A Lad’s Love with Brian Giebler on BRIDGE 9542 label. Reginald features on several albums with the Monteverdi Choir and Sir John Eliot Gardiner, including a recording of Bach’s St Matthew Passion and Magnificat, where Reginald ‘encapsulates whimsical pathos’ (Classical Music Magazine) His solo recording debut with ALPHA Classics will be released in June 2023. Reginald’s work has earned him both a 2023 Grammy Awards and 2023 Classical Music Awards Nomination.\n\nread more...\n\nAlexander Weimann, director\n\nThe internationally renowned keyboard artist Alexander Weimann has spent his life enveloped by the therapeutic power and beauty of making music.
