        "text": "This post contains research conducted by Khrisma McMurray, a summer 2022 Junior Fellow at the Library of Congress.\n\nAs we honor the legacy of Martin Luther King, Jr. this year, we invite your families to explore the different ways that children participated in the civil rights movement and the impact that Martin Luther King, Jr. had on young people using resources from the Library.\n\nChildren’s Crusade: What Would You Do if Martin Luther King, Jr. Invited You to March?\n\nMartin Luther King Jr.’s influence on one child was profound, as activist Freeman Hrabowski recounted in an oral history included in the Civil Rights History Project held at the Library. At minute mark 30:00, Hrabowski shares how, in 1963 at age twelve, he heard a guest speaker at his Montgomery, Alabama church propose involving children in the city’s ongoing protests. When Hrabowski asked the speaker’s name, people responded, “King, King.” This was Hrabowski’s first encounter with Martin Luther King, Jr.\n\nAfter hearing King speak, Hrabowski felt personally invited to participate in the Birmingham Children’s March—a pivotal moment of the civil rights movement involving over 5,000 young protesters. The children made front-page news nationwide as they endured being knocked to the ground by powerful water hoses, attacks by police dogs, and up to five days of detention in jail without their parents. At minute mark 41:00, Hrabowski recollects that one of his jobs in jail was to comfort incarcerated 8-year-olds.\n\nWhile the details are disturbing and the move to expose children to such risks was controversial, the event galvanized the movement. Today, historians consider it a turning point and for Hrabowski, it was a personal watershed. As he recalled at minute mark 42:48, “What the experience taught me was that even children can make decisions that can have an impact on the rest of their lives, and that children know the difference between right and wrong.”\n\nHow A Play About Martin Luther King Jr. Inspired a Youth Sit-In\n\nIn this oral history interview, Marilyn Luper Hildreth recalls how a theatrical adaptation of King’s story catalyzed the NAACP Youth Council in Oklahoma City. When Hildreth was in elementary school in 1957, her mother wrote the play “Brother President” based on Martin Luther King, Jr.’s life. After experiencing integration when travelling through the north to perform the play, Hildreth and her friends—age six to sixteen—staged a sit-in at the lunch counter of Katz’s Drug Store. Despite enduring physical and verbal abuse, their action was successful. As Hildreth shared at the 8:00 minute mark, “We went from restaurant to restaurant to restaurant until the walls of segregation starting falling down in Oklahoma City.”\n\nChildren Act Against Injustice\n\nRuby Bridges was born in 1954—the year the Supreme Court, in the landmark Brown vs. Board of Education case, ruled that segregated schools are inherently unequal.\n\nDespite the ruling, many districts across the South resisted integration. In November of 1960—six years after the decision—Ruby Bridges began her education as the first African-American student at William Frantz Elementary School in New Orleans. White families pulled their students from the school in retaliation, and Bridges had to attend classes by herself with the one teacher who was willing to teach her, Barbara Henry. She was jeered by a mob each day on her way to school and surrounded by federal marshals for her protection.\n\nToday, Ruby Bridges is a speaker and children’s book author, who appeared virtually at the 2022 National Book Festival to discuss her new book “I Am Ruby Bridges.” Watch the video below with children in your life to learn more about her life and writings today. At minute 14:38, for example, she talks about how books can help children understand the world.\n\nIn addition to hearing from a child activist from the past, you can also learn from Tybre Faw, the subject of the book Because of You, John Lewis, which compares Martin Luther King, Jr.’s mentorship of John Lewis to Tybre’s relationship with the late Congressman. In this video, also from the 2022 National Book Festival, children can hear how today’s civil rights activists can be inspired by leaders of the past.\n\nActivities and Reflection:"
