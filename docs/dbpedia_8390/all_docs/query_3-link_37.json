        "text": "Activism\n\n“Our knowing that Asian Americans waged struggles against militarism and imperial expansionism, that Asian American students fought for Third World and ethnic studies, that Asian American activists worked in solidarity with Black Power and Third World anticolonial activists, that Filipino farmworkers engaged labor battles alongside Chicana/o farmworkers, that Japanese Americans protested their World War II incarceration, that Asian American feminists helped to build the U.S. Third World feminist movement, and that Asian American queer communities collectively organized for visibility matters. It has been through Asian American activism scholarship—in addition to cultural, journalistic, activist, and oral traditions—that we and others have come to know and be inspired by our own Asian American histories of struggle” (114).\n\n— Diane C.
