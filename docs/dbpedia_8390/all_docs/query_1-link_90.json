His family made the journey to Canada in 1963 and settled in the west end of Toronto. His outgoing nature and love of music naturally brought together a close knit community of friends and family. Within this community he met his future wife and best friend Carmen. Soon after their marriage in 1972, they moved out of the city limits to Bramalea and began to raise a family. Edmund and Carmen along with their three daughters Jennifer, Valerie and Stephanie stayed in their home on Mancroft for over three decades. All the while “Eddie,” as he was affectionately known, would work long days in the printing business (for many years at Stanley Manufacturing and would go on to start his own business PSI Graphics) but saved nights and weekends for playing and performing in his band – Boa Esperança. As the girls grew up, Eddie began to feel the pull northward to cottage country. He found a waterfront lot in Mckellar where he brought his family up for entire summers and any free weekends to enjoy the quiet outdoors. He eventually built the family cottage that became the heart of the extended family where reunions, parties and weddings would play host. Anyone lucky enough to attend one of the many gatherings held at the cottage knew they were in for a joyful time of great food, plenty of laughs and the always memorable campfire sing-a-long with Eddie’s acoustic guitar at the center of it all.\n\nIn the fall of 2015, Eddie and Carmen moved to Huntsville to be closer to family. Jennifer and her husband Jonathan had made Huntsville home in 2007, followed by Valerie and her husband Greg in 2010. In 2011 Valerie and Greg welcomed their daughter Leila into the world followed by their son Nathan in 2013. Eddie “Avô” and Carmen “Avó” were delighted with the idea of being grandparents and the chance to play a role in their upbringing.\n\nEdmund is survived by his beloved wife Carmen, three daughters Jennifer (Jonathan), Valerie (Greg) and Stephanie and adoring grandchildren Leila and Nathan.
