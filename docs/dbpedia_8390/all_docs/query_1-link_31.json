        "text": "Albert Sidney Foley Jr. was born in New Orleans, Louisiana, on November 6, 1912. He was the second child and eldest son of Albert Sidney Foley and Gertrude Emily Mavor Foley. The elder Albert’s father and served as General Albert Sidney Johnston’s flag bearer during the Civil War, and had named his son in remembrance of the general. The elder Albert Sidney worked as the assistant manager of the American Sugar Refining Company in New Orleans. Gertrude was a housewife. As a boy the younger Foley’s family was served by a succession of domestics, and he was schooled by his family in the “Civil War traditions” present in his boyhood home.(1) Foley’s family christened him at St. Stephens Church on Napoleon and Camp streets ten days after his birth. He alter attended Holy Name of Jesus elementary and Jesuit High schools, graduating in\n\n1929.\n\nEven as a young boy, Foley knew that one day he would become a priest. “I was MEANT to be a Jesuit priest,” he later told his administrative assistant.(2) As a schoolboy, he served as an altar boy. Part of his duties included delivering to the sacristan of the Holy Name Church the alter bread made by the Creole sisters at their convent located behind St. Louis Cathedral. One “colored” sister, who had been the order’s doorkeeper for many years, Sister Berchmans, would introduce Foley to others saying “This is my little altar boy who wants to be a priest.”(3)\n\nFoley's first exposure to Spring Hill College, the school to which he would devote the last thirty-seven years of his life, and to Thomas Toolen, the diocesan bishop under who he would serve until 1969, occurred in 1927. Toolen took over the diocese on May 18, 1927. Four days later he presided over the laying of the cornerstone of Mobile Hall, located on the campus of Spring Hill. Foley’s family traveled to the city to see the new bishop. Toolen’s “corpulent” figure dismayed the fourteen-year-old boy. The two men were to have their disagreements over the years.(4)\n\nIn 1929, at age 17, Foley joined the Society of Jesus by entering their novitiate at Grand Coteau, Louisiana. The novitiate was the first step a Jesuit scholastic took on the prescribed passage to full ordination in the church. The novitiate consisted of two years spent in a religious community where the Jesuit candidate learned the traditions, rules, and expectations of the Society. Following the novitiate, the scholastic took his first vows of poverty, chastity, and obedience to his superiors, allowing him to put the acronym “S. J.” (for Society of Jesus) after his name. After that two-year period, the Jesuit hopeful bean his juniorate, which was devoted to the study of Latin, Greek, and the humanities. Next, the Jesuit spent three years in philosophical studies followed by the three-year regency. During the regency the Jesuit taught in a Society high school or college. A priest was ordained after the third year of a four-year theological study. The final phase of the process included one year of prayer, spiritual studies, and a pastoral ministry, a period known as tertianship.\n\nAt Grand Coteau, Foley took his first vows, helped his superiors with retreats for the area’s Catholic high school students, and participated in outreach programs for the poor and needy. In 1931, he attended St. Louis University, where he took minor orders. At St. Louis he earned an AB in 1935 and a MA in Latin in 1936. For his regency, Foley returned to his New Orleans alma mater, Jesuit High School, for the 1936-1937 school year. After the school year, he moved on to Mobile, where he served as the director of debating and the prefect of discipline at Spring Hill College for the years 1937 through 1939. After his regency, the New Orleans native went to St. Mary’s College in Kansas to begin his theological study. Foley was ordained on June 17, 1942. For his tertainship, Foley went to Our Lady of the Martyrs in Auriesville, New York. However, World War II affected his ability to finish that period. A Spring Hill College professor of sociology had left to serve in Europe and Foley was called on to replace him. From 1944 through 1947 he taught religion, speech, and sociology at the college. This is also the period when then issues of racial prejudice and segregation began to become of paramount importance to the young priest.\n\nFoley was assigned to take over the teaching of a course entitled “Migration, Immigration, and Race.” Not being trained in the field of sociology, however, he began to read in preparation for the course. The volumes he read and the studies he conducted made him realize how illogical prejudice was and how much injustice segregation caused. With a new awareness about color in America, Foley ventured into the field of race relations. He organized a Mobile Student Interracial Union on the campus of the college and conducted surveys among black Catholics and his students into racial opinions and treatment. These steps, however, earned him the censure of his local bishop, Archbishop Thomas Toolen, and he was shortly reassigned.\n\nAnother incident that happened during Foley’s first tour of duty at Spring Hill College was the organizing meeting in 1946 of a provincial Institute of Social Order. At that meeting a group of nearly two dozen Jesuit priests established, among other committees, a subcommittee on interracial relations, which they selected Foley to head.\n\nOn February 3, 1947, Foley took his final vows. That same year he returned to St. Louis University for an MS in sociology. While there he worked with the Institute of Social Order, directed by Leo Brown, S. J. He also worked with Daniel Lord, S. J., the publisher of The Queen’s Work. Foley also joined the Midwest Clergy Conference on Negro Welfare and the Catholic Committee of the South. He was involved with the Commission on Interracial Cooperation, which was to evolve into the Southern Regional Council, another organization he joined in the 1950s.\n\nAfter receiving his MS, Foley went to the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, where he studied under Howard Odum and Guy Johnson in their sociology graduate program. Under Odum and Johnson, Foley wrote his dissertation on “The Catholic Church and the Washington Negro.” Finished in 1950, the dissertation was never published because it never received the official sanction of the church.\n\nIn 1951, Foley returned to St. Louis and to his work with the Institute of Social Order. Asked to direct a summer workshop in human relations at St. Louis University, which subsequently fell through, he continued his education with a post doctorate fellowship in a methodological approach to human relation known as Group Dynamics. For the 1952-1953 school year he attended the Research Center for Group Dynamics at the University of Michigan under a grant secured from the Carnegie Foundation.\n\nWith a firmer knowledge for the dynamics of human relations, Foley began a thirty-seven year run of small group workshops in human relations, race relations, and community relations, first at Loyola University of New Orleans, then as Our Lady of the Lake College in San Antonio, Texas, and finally at his own Human Relations Institute at Spring Hill College, to which he was reassigned in 1953. That year, the college determined to finally implement desegregation, a process the board of trustees has discussed for several years.\n\nIn 1955, Foley became an establishing member of the Alabama Council on Human Relations, the state branch of the Southern Regional Council, an organization of an interreligious, interracial nature dedicated to educating others about the issue of race. By 1960 he had established the Human Relations Institute at Spring Hill College. From this venue he held small group workshops in race relations, police/community relations, executive development, and other areas. Around 1961, he was also appointed to the Alabama Advisory Committee to the U. S. Civil Rights Commission, a group established under the 1957 Eisenhower Civil Rights Act.\n\nIt was as a member of the Alabama Council and the Alabama Advisory Committee, and as a religious figure concerned about the conditions blacks faced in the Jim Crow South, that Foley found himself in the midst of the civil rights struggle in Birmingham in 1963. During the protests led by Martin Luther King Jr., Ralph Abernathy, the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, Fred Shuttlesworth, and the Alabama Christian Movement for Human Rights, Foley became embroiled in a confrontation with leaders of the Civil Rights Movement and, in the process, was forced to confront his beliefs about race head on, a course of events that left him scarred and returned him to the comfort of small group workshops.\n\nAfter 1963, Foley’s concern for the plight of the poor and dispossessed was manifested less with public pronouncements, as had been the case in Birmingham, and more with education through his workshops. From 1956 through 1968 he conducted workshops on school desegregation in Mobile and Birmingham, designed to changed attitudes and bring about the process in a peaceful way. For the last seventeen years of his life, Albert Foley worked through federal grants with the Job Training Partnership Act and the Headstart Program, among other things. He continued to\n\nteach at Spring Hill until 1979, becoming professor emeritus, and continued his work with the Human Relations Institute until his death in 1990. He is buried on the campus of Spring Hill College."
