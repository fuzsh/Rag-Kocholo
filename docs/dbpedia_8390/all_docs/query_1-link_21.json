        "text": "THE GUSTAVE BONNETE FAMILY\n\nof\n\nAvoyelles Parish, Louisiana\n\nThis is definitely a work in progress. If you are a descendant of Gustave Bonnette and Leocade Riche, I would sincerely enjoy your comments, corrections, and naturally additions, especially photographs of the children of Gustave and Leocade that I do not have, which are many!! As you may observe there are many of us. If you have been omitted or misidentified, please let me know and I will take immediate action to remedy the error. Please enjoy! auRayvoir! Ray L. Bellande, July 12, 2006, Ocean Springs, Mississippi (228) 257-6350.\n\nTHE FAMILY of GUSTAVE BONNETTE (1844-1895)\n\nGustave Bonnette (1844-1895) was born on February 6, 1844, at Avoyelles Parish, Louisiana. His parents were Jean-Baptiste Bonnette (1811-1870+) and Aimee Fuqua (Fouquier) (1814-1866+). Jean-Baptiste Bonnette was born in January 1811, the son of Jean Bonnet (b. 1774), a native of Montagne in the province of St. Onge, France and Francoise Gaspard (born ca. 1778), a native of St. Charles Parish, Louisiana. Francoise Gaspard was the widow of Augustin Juneau II (1778-1803). Their marriage on September 9, 1806 at Marksville, Louisiana commenced the Bonnette family in Avoyelles Parish. Aimee Fuqua was the daughter of Charles Pierre Fuqua and Helen Aymond(1790-1832+).(Gremillion and Gremillion, 1980, p. 147 and http://worldconnect.genealogy.rootsweb.com/cgi- bin/igm.cgi?op=REG&db=decuir&id=I3826)\n\nJean Bonnette related in November 1814, that he came to reside in Avoyelles Parish in August 1803. At this time the Spanish occupied this area of the Gulf Coast.(American State Papers, Vol. 3-1994, p. 179)\n\nAlida 'Ida' Riche Ducote (1857-1945)\n\n[Courtesy of Judith Rabelais Scola-February 2011]\n\nLeocade 'Leah' Riche Bonnette (1853-1930)\n\n(Courtesy of Marjorie Lemoine Rabalais (1921-2008), Plaucheville, Louisiana)\n\nGustave Bonnette married Leocade Riche (1853-1930), called Leah, on November 30, 1869 in Avoyelles Parish, Louisiana. She was born in March 1853, the daughter of Elphege Riche (1831-1859+) and Helena Lemoine (1832-1859+), the widow of Valerien Bordeleon. The progenitor of the Riche family in Louisiana was Louis Riche (c. 1708-1749) a native of Treves in Lorraine, Eastern France. He married Marie Catherine Frederic (c. 1724-1766) at New Orleans in February 1740. She was the daughter of Johann (Jean) Frederic and Catherine de Boulair. (Dufour, V. 1, 1979, p. 30 and Gremillion and Gremillion, 1980, p. 325))\n\nIn the 1860 Federal Census of Avoyelles Parish, Leah Riche was the eldest of three siblings, Arcadus Riche (b. 1856), Elida Riche (b. 1858), and Irene Riche (b. 1859). In her later life, Leah resided with her son, Elis Bonnette, at Alexandria, where she helped rear her grandchildren, James Lee Bonnette (b. 1920) and Frances Lillian Bonnette (b. 1922).\n\nIron cross grave marker of Leocade Riche Bonnette\n\nMater Dolorosa Cemetery-Plaucheville, Louisiana\n\n[image made in March 1998 by Ray L. Bellande]\n\nFrom the land records of Avoyelles Parish, Louisiana, it appears that Gustave Bonnette and family settled in Ward 8, T1S-R5E, on Bayou Choupique near Plaucheville, Louisiana. He made his livelihood as a farmer cultivating about sixty acres of land that he acquired between 1885 and 1895 in the Bayou Choupique section. After his death in December 1895, Leocade R. Bonnette petitioned the Probate Court of Avoyelles Parish to be tutrix of her eight minor children: Ulysse Bonnette, Irma Bonnette, Ida Bonnette, Inez Bonnette, Irene Bonnette, Philibert Bonnette, Elis Bonnette, and Nettie Bonnette. She further requested that Floreval Bonnette be appointed under tuter.(Probate Proceedings of Avoyelles Parish, Louisiana, Book J, pp. 405-406).\n\nIn 1900 Federal Census, Leocade R. Bonnette told the census taker that she had birthed twelve children and that ten were living in 1900. Gustave Bonnette left her a small estate and these eight minor children.\n\nThe corporal remains of Gustave Bonnette rest in the Mater Dolorosa Cemetery at Plaucheville, Louisiana in Section B-3, Row 9, Plot 30. He expired on December 7, 1895. Leah Riche Bonnette died from cancer at Plaucheville, Louisiana on November 11, circa 1930, where she was residing with her daughter, Inez B. Lemoine (1886-1938). Her remains were interred in the Mater Dolorosa Cemetery. Her grandson, Wiltz Lemoine (1908-1969), a welder, made an iron cross for her gravesite. The metal nameplate on the crucifix has disappeared with time.\n\nCHILDREN OF GUSTAVE BONNETTE AND LEOCADE RICHE\n\nCELINA VIOLETTE BONNETTE (1870-?)\n\nHer birth is noted in the genealogical column of Nelson Gremillion, Our Heritage, \"The Bonnette Family\", inThe Avoyelles Journal, October 9, 1983. No further information.\n\nBOSSIER FLOREVAL BONNETTE (1872-1905)\n\nFloreval Bonnette Farm\n\nFlorival Bonnette's farm was situated on Bayou Cane Brulle near Highway No. 245 and Highway No. 1182, northeast of Plaucheville, Louisiana. [image made March 1998 by Ray L. Bellande]\n\nBossier Floreval Bonnette (1872-1905), known as Floreval Bonnette, was born in Avoyelles Parish on August 11, 1872. His aunt, Pauline Bonnette (b. 1843), wife of Valery A. Guillot, named her first child, Bossier Sylvestre Pelfrey Guillot. Bossier Floreval Bonnette was baptized at St. Joseph's Catholic Church in Marksville, Louisiana. Floreval married Delphine “Emily” Emelie Gremillion (1874-1908), the daughter of Felicien Oneil Gremillion and Marie Zeline Plauche, on December 9, 1891. The 1900 Federal Census of Avoyelles, Louisiana indicates that Floreval was a farmer and that he and Emily G. Bonnette lived adjacent to his mother, Leocade R. Bonnette, and his younger siblings. Emily Bonnette gave birth to four children born before 1900, but only two survived: Walter J. Bonnette (b. June 1896) and Bloome Bonnette (b. January 1898).(LaCour, V. 3, 1986, p. 64 and 1900 Avoyelles Parish, Louisiana Federal Census, T623 558, p. 3B, ED 21)\n\nTwo daughters were born after 1900: Blanche Bonnette (1902-1917) and Norma Bonnette (1903-1982) who was born on July 31, 1903. Norma Bonnette married Lemmie L. Gremillion (1900-1962). Norma B. Gremillion passed on November 18, 1982. She and Lemmie L. Gremillion are interred with her father.\n\nFloreval Bonnette died on November 14, 1905. His obituary in The Times Democrat read as follows: Floriall (sic) Bonnette, Plaucheville, thirty-eight years old died at his home on Lower Choupique yesterday after a long and severe illness. He leaves a wife and four children. Funeral at Church of the Sacred Heart. Father J.B. Limague officiated.(The Times Democrat, November 17, 1904, p. 8, c. 6)\n\nThe corporal remains of Florivall Bonnette and those of Blanche Bonnette (1902 -1917), Norma Bonnette Gremillion, and Lemmie L. Gremillion are interred in the family plot at Mater Dolorosa Cemetery at Plaucheville, Louisiana.(LaCour, 1983, p. 38)\n\nChildren of Florival Bonnette and Emily Gremillion\n\nWalter Joseph Bonnette (1896-1931)\n\n[in the second image from left, the lady may be Maxine Washington, the 1929 spouse of Waler J. Bonnette]\n\n[Images courtesy of Maudry Ferrand Bonnette, Slidell, Louisiana-March 1998]\n\nWalter J. Bonnette\n\nWalter Joseph Bonnette (1896-1931) was born June 1896 in Plaucheville, Louisiana. I have acquired some anecdotal information on this colorful individual as follows: He joined the U.S. Navy and was stationed at New York where he expired. A nurse with legal marriage documents claimed his estate.(from L.G. Gremillion, Moreauville, Louisiana-March 1998) This family lore is corroborated by Maudry Bonnette Ferrand of Slidell who adds that Walter died from pneumonia at New York in 1928.\n\nIn recent years, some of the obfuscation of Walter J. Bonnette life have been removed. In 1920, Walter was a Boatswain's Mate 1/C in the US NAVY and serving on the USS Pennsylvania (BB-38). This battleship had been built by Newport News Ship Building & Dry Dock Company and launched in March 1915. It was sailing out of New York at this time. The USS Pennsylvania was damaged at Pearl Harbor in December 1941, but recovered to fight the Japanese in the South Pacific from 1942 to 1945. She was used at Bikini toll in 1946 for atomic bomb tests and decommissioned in 1948 and sank off of Kwajalein Lagoon.(1920 USS Pennsylvania Federal Census T625_2040, p. 2A)\n\nIn 1930, Walter J. Bonnette was a resident of Mt. Vernon, Westchester County, New York and had married in 1929, Maxine Washington(1904-1930+),the daughter of Thomas Washington (1856-1914) and Isabelle Kearney (1878-1920+). Maxine was probably born at Liberty, Sullivan County, New York and grew up on a farm. At this time, he was unemployed and listed as a disabled war veteran.(1930 Westchester County, New York Federal Census R1662, p. 2A, ED 237)\n\nGreg Cusack [gcusack@verizon.net],a descendant of the Kearney family, contacted me in August 2010 and provided the following information. Walter J. Bonnette died in 1931 and was buried in St. Peter's Cemetery at Liberty, Sullivan County, New York. Walter and Maxine lived at Mt. Vernon, New York. Maxine played the organ for the New Rochelle orchestra and taught school in Liberty, New York for most of her life. She had no children.\n\nBloome Bonnette (1899-1977) and spouse?\n\n[Courtesy of Maudry Ferrand Bonnette, Slidell, Louisiana-March 1998]\n\nBloome B. Bonnette\n\nBloome Benedict Bonnette (1898 or 1899-1977) was born in Avoyelles Parish, Louisiana on January 8, 1899 [SSDI]. Circa 1916, he married Azalie Goudeaux (1898-1979), the daughter of the son of Joseph Goudeau (1869-1930) and Catherine Josephine Marchal (1872-1939). In 1920, Bloome and Azalie were living with Nick Goudeaux (1892-1947), her brother, and Nettie Bonnette Goudeaux, his aunt, on Levin Street at Alexandria, Louisiana. Bloome was a foundry worker and probably worked with his uncles, Filbert Bonnette and Lee Bonnette, who were foundry moulders in Alexandria.(1920 Rapides Parish, Louisiana Federal Census, T625_626, p. 18A, ED 56)\n\nBy 1930, Bloome and Emily Bonnette had relocated to New Orleans and were domiciled on Dumaine Street. They had three children: Emily M. Bonnette (1919-1984) married James \"Jay\" P. Hebert (1918-2000); Maudry Bonnette (1922-2014) married Elmer L. Ferrand (1923-2003); Gordon J. Bonnette (1924-2009) married Marie ?; Rogers John Bonnette (1931-2009) married Muriel H. ?; and Huey Bonnette (b. 1935) married Grace ? Bloome worked as a laborer in a dry dock.(1930 Orleans Parish, Louisiana, R803, p. 22A, ED 73)\n\nBloome Bonnette expired at Metairie, Louisiana in July 1977. Azalie Bonnette followed him in death in July 1979.\n\nCHILDREN\n\nMAUDRY BONNETTE\n\nMaudry Bonnette Ferrand (1922-2014), passed away peacefully Monday, February 24, 2014 at the age of 92. Beloved wife of the late Elmer L. Ferrand; mother of Rodney L. Ferrand (Gail), Glenn D. Ferrand (Susie), Brian L. Ferrand (Priscila), and Janell Ferrand Berman (Jesse). She is also survived by her brother and multiple nieces and nephews. Maudry was a devoted grandmother to eight grandchildren and one great-grandchild. She lived most of her life in Metairie, Louisiana and the last 30+ years in Slidell, Louisiana. She made a career of raising her children, loving and nurturing her grandchildren. She enjoyed and rarely missed her one (maybe two glasses) of red wine. She was loved by everyone, and will be missed by all.\n\nRelatives and friends are invited to a Memorial Mass at Lake Lawn Metairie Funeral Home, 5100 Pontchartrain Blvd. (in Metairie Cemetery) on Saturday, March 1, 2014 at 1:00 PM. Visitation will begin at 11:00 AM. Our special lady's favorite color was red; please feel free to join the family in wearing something red in her honor. Burial will be at a later date.(The Times-Picayune, February 28, 2014)\n\nROGERS J. BONNETTE\n\nRogers John Bonnette Sr. (1931-2009), age 78 years old of Albany, died Friday, November 20, 2009, at his residence. He was born on Thursday, February 5, 1931, in Marksville.
