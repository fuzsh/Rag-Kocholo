Well, what if we build a new world order based on the principles of the Enlightenment? The ones upon which the constitutions of all Western democracies were written. The ones we all seem to feel in our guts have somehow gotten lost. After all, it was our own governments that armed and trained the fanatics we now call enemies.

A wife can only surrender to a desert night by betraying her husband. An artist struggles to honor his own aspirations as well as society’s expectations of him. A missionary brutally converted to the worship of a tribal fetish is left with but an echo of his identity. Whether set in North Africa, Paris, or Brazil, the stories in Exile and the Kingdom are probing portraits of spiritual exile, and man’s perpetual search for an inner kingdom in which to be reborn. They display Camus at the height of his powers.” Camus won The Nobel Prize for Literature in 1957.\n\nRachel Carson, Silent Spring New York: Houghton Mifflin Company, Anniversary Edition, 2002\n\n“The classic that launched the environmental movement.

Carson’s passionate concern for the future of our planet reverberated powerfully throughout the world, and her eloquent book was instrumental in launching the environmental movement.

Frankl, Man’s Search for Meaning\n\nAustria: Verlag für Jugend und Volk, 1946\n\nBoston: Beacon Press (English), 1959\n\n“Frankl survived the horrors of one of the 20th Century’s bleakest tragedies: Auschwitz. Some refer to such events as ‘dark nights of the soul.’ At such times we are given a choice: to die or to find some way to move on and live. To move on implies to learn and grow from the experience and implies introspection as much as action. For Frankl, this meant coming to the conclusion that human beings’ innermost motivation for existence is meaning, purpose.”\n\nCharles Ferguson\n\nInside Job: The Financiers That Pulled Off The Heist of the Century\n\nNew York: Crown Business, 2012\n\n“The definitive big picture on the 2008 financial crisis, from the man behind the Oscar-winning documentary film, Inside Job, that exposed the workings of the new economic elite.”\n\nPredator Nation: Corporate Criminals, Political Corruption, and the Hijacking of America\n\nNew York: Random House, 2013\n\n“Charles H.

He explores how morality evolved to enable us to form communities, and how moral values are not just about justice and equality – for some people authority, sanctity or loyalty matter more. Morality binds and blinds, but, using his own research, Haidt proves it is possible to liberate ourselves from the disputes that divide good people.”\n\n“A landmark contribution to humanity’s understanding of itself.” – The New York Times\n\nPaul Hawkin, Drawdown: The Most Comprehensive Plan Ever Proposed to Reverse Global Warming\n\nNew York: Penguin Books, 2017\n\nNew York Times bestselling book by Project Drawdown as its inaugural body of work on climate solutions, which hasbecome a seminal text on climate solutions, drawing on humanity’s collective wisdom about the practices and technologies that can begin to reverse the buildup of atmospheric carbon by mid-century.

It consists of the necessary elements that can inspire greatness in each of us. Based on Harvey’s concepts of Sacred Activism, a global initiative designed to save the world from its downward spiral of greed, pain, and self-destruction, the book is an enlightening text that reflects our world today, while in turn, shapes our future.”\n\nThe Return of The Mother\n\nNew York: Tarcher 2000\n\n“Here is Andrew Harvey’s most complete statement on Mary and his vision of the Divine Mother as both a social and spiritual revolutionary. “Perhaps the most radical aspect of Harvey’s message is also the simplest: “Only the transforming power of love can make the salvation of the human race possible.”\n\nChris Hedges, War Is a Force That Gives Us Meaning\n\nNew York: Random House, 2002\n\n“As a veteran war correspondent, Chris Hedges has survived ambushes in Central America, imprisonment in Sudan, and a beating by Saudi military police. He has seen children murdered for sport in Gaza and petty thugs elevated into war heroes in the Balkans. Hedges, who is also a former divinity student, has seen war at its worst and knows too well that to those who pass through it, war can be exhilarating and even addictive: “It gives us purpose, meaning, a reason for living. Drawing on his own experience and on the literature of combat from Homer to Michael Herr, Hedges shows how war seduces not just those on the front lines but entire societies, corrupting politics, destroying culture, and perverting the most basic human desires.”\n\nChris Hedges and Joe Sacco, Days of Destruction, Days of Revolt\n\nNew York: Nation Books, 2012\n\n“Pulitzer Prize winner Chris Hedges and award-winning cartoonist and journalist Joe Sacco set out to take a look at the sacrifice zones, those areas in America that have been offered up for exploitation in the name of profit, progress, and technological advancement. They wanted to show in words and drawings what life looks like in places where the marketplace rules without constraints, where human beings and the natural world are used and then discarded to maximize profit. Days of Destruction, Days of Revolt is the searing account of their travels.”\n\nJames Hillman. The Soul’s Code: In Search of Character and Calling\n\nNew York: Random House, 1996\n\n“Hillman presents a brilliant vision of our selves not defined by family relationships or the mentality of victimization. Drawing on the biographies of such disparate people as Ella Fitzgerald and Mohandas K. Gandhi, James Hillman argues that character is fate and shows how the soul, if given the opportunity, can assert itself even at an early age. The result is a reasoned and powerful road map to understanding our true nature and discovering an eye-opening array of choices — from the way we raise our children to our career paths to our social and personal commitments to achieving excellence in our time.”\n\nbell hooks. Teaching to Transgress: Education as the Practice of Freedom\n\nNew York: Routledge, 1994\n\n“bell hooks–writer, teacher, and insurgent black intellectual–writes about a new kind of education, education as the practice of freedom. Teaching students to “transgress” against racial, sexual, and class boundaries in order to achieve the gift of freedom is, for hooks, the teacher’s most important goal. hooks speaks to the heart of education today: how can we rethink teaching practices in the age of multiculturalism? What do we do about teachers who do not want to teach, and students who do not want to learn? How should we deal with racism and sexism in the classroom? Full of passion and politics, Teaching to Transgress combines a practical knowledge of the classroom with a deeply felt connection to the world of emotions and feelings. This is the rare book about teachers and students that dares to raise critical questions about eros and rage, grief and reconciliation, and the future of teaching itself.”\n\nGreg Jobin-Leeds, When We Fight, We Win: Twenty-First-Century Social Movements and Activists That Are Transforming Our World\n\nNew York: The New Press, 2016\n\nWesley Lowery, They Can’t Kill Us All\n\nNew York: Back Bay Books, 2017\n\nChalmers Johnson, Sorrows of Empire: Militarism, Secrecy, and the End of the Republic (The American Empire Project) 1st Edition\n\nNew York: Metropolitan, 2006\n\nIbram X.

She introduces us to a dozen species, some already gone, others facing extinction, including the Panamian golden frog, staghorn coral, the great auk, and the Sumatran rhino. Kolbert provides a moving account of the disappearances occurring all around us and traces the evolution of extinction as concept, from its first articulation by Georges Cuvier in revolutionary Paris up through the present day. The sixth extinction is likely to be mankind’s most lasting legacy; as Kolbert observes, it compels us to rethink the fundamental question of what it means to be human.”\n\nJonathan Kozol, Savage Inequalities: Children in American Schools, 2nd Edition\n\nNew York: Broadway Books, 2012\n\nIn 1988, Kozol set off to spend two years with children in the American public education system in neighborhoods across the country, from Illinois to Washington, D.C., and from New York to San Antonio.

Marrying wisdom, insight, and passion, Lederach explains why we need to move beyond “traditional” diplomacy, which often emphasizes top-level leaders and short-term objectives, toward a holistic approach that stresses the multiplicity of peacemakers, long-term perspectives, and the need to create an infrastructure that empowers resources within a society and maximizes contributions from outside.”\n\nJames W.
