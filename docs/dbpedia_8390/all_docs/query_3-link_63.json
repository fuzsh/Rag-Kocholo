        "text": "“… If he were a soldier, he would be the first one jumping out of the foxhole and leading the charge across the field of battle. His view is that leaders must not only lead, they must be seen to be leading – that is part of the job description. … Even in personal relationships, he believed that you should take the lead. If there is something bothering you, if you feel you have been treated unfairly, you must say so. That is leading too.\n\nLeading from the front meant many things. Sometimes he took the words literally, as when he first came onto Robben Island: He stepped to the front of the line of prisoners entering the island, under the stares and taunts of the guards, in order to show the others how to react. Right from the start you had to stand up to the guards, he told his colleagues, and he took the lead in doing so.\n\nBut leading from the front also meant doing things that did not necessarily attract attention. It meant not accepting any special preferences and doing the same tasks as other prisoners – like cleaning the warder’s chamber pots, or those of his fellow prisoners. There is nothing beneath a leader. Eddie Daniels recalls when he first came onto the Island in the early sixties, Mandela strode across the courtyard to introduce himself. Daniels was in awe of Mandela, and talked about how just watching Mandela was inspiring.\n\n…\n\nDanny, as everyone called him, recalls that once he was ill and did not have the strength to clean his chamber pot. Mandela walked by his cell and “he bent down and took my balie, and then walked to the bathroom to clean it. One’s not keen on cleaning someone else’s mess. Next morning, Nelson came along. He was the leader of the biggest organization in prison. He could instruct anyone to help me. He came in that morning, and he had his balie under his arm. He said, ‘How are you Danny?’ He came in and took my balie.”\n\n…\n\nWhen you lead from the front, you can’t let your colleagues get too far behind. So after these private talks [to negotiate with the government to lift apartheid laws and free political prisoners] had begun, Mandela made a request to see his comrades. He wanted to tell them what he had done and to make sure they were with him. Even though they were just three floors apart, the request to see them had to go to the prison authorities, then to the bureaucracy in Cape Town, and finally to government headquarters in Pretoria. This time the authorities would only permit him to see his colleagues individually. Instead of resisting, Mandela agreed. His first meeting was with Walter. His oldest friend and colleague, his mentor, the man who had first seen a mass leader in that rough and gangly youth from the Transkei. He told Walter of the secret negotiations.”\n\n- Richard Stengel, Nelson Mandela: Portrait of an Extraordinary Man, p.57 – 59, 67-68\n\nThis being the first posthumous Mandela Day, we are perhaps called upon to celebrate and reflect on Madiba more so as to ensure that we carry the baton and legacy which he has left for us. That being the case, we can learn the following lessons from the great leader that was Madiba -\n\n# 1 - If he were a soldier, he would be the one jumping out of the foxhole and leading the charge across the field of battle: What makes it inspiring and perhaps even compelling to follow a leader like Madiba is that he led by example. He was a “do as I do” and not a “do as I say” kind of leader and while the latter kind of leadership often losses credibility, the former always gains it. Stengel says that Madiba was not only genuinely “leading from the front”, he was also of the “view that leaders must not only lead, they must be seen to be leading – that is part of the job description”. Moreover, because Madiba took the lead even in personal relationships, we learn that we should all aspire to lead from the front because not only those regarded as leaders because of positions of leadership which they occupy organisationally or professionally have personal relationships. We can all lead in our one-on-one relationships.\n\n# 2 - He took the words literally – he stepped to the front – in order to show the others how to react: We are naturally inclined to follow leaders who inspire us into action (as opposed to commanding us into action) through the powerful lead by example. Perhaps because as beings this is how we have been raised by our parents and care-givers, we emulate immensely a lot of what was taught to us by way of example, this is only natural to us. Whether it is Madiba, Ghandi or Lincoln, the mark of the greatest leaders of all time is how they were able to lead from the front by example. We once again learn that leadership is a life calling, a way of living, not a 09h00 to 17h00 position which we might be occupying.\n\n# 3 – But leading from the front also meant doing things that did not necessarily attract attention: There are many things which constitute leading from the front, but what it certainly is not is grandstanding. In an article by Eric Barker called 10 Things the Greatest Leaders All Have in Common, he says the greatest weakness and the cause for the downfall of many great leaders is “Hubris”, pride, arrogance, vanity, conceit, name it what you will. In our observation, what kept the greatest leaders in check was their humility and the ability to still get their hands dirty. This seems to be the secret to keeping humble, to assume leadership as a role of service to others, not as a position for being served. The perfect example is when Christ washed the feet of his disciples (John 13:1-17). Serving has a way of keep us down to earth, it is an antidote for hubris. Former Robben Island prisoner and anti-apartheid activist Eddie Daniels relates the powerful story of how Madiba used to help him with his chamber pot when Eddie was ill and could not clean his own “balie” as they called them. It is an incredibly inspiring story from which we learn about the humility of Madiba. As the leader of the biggest anti-apartheid movement on Robben Island, Madiba could have very well chosen to instruct someone else to attend to Eddie’s balie, but he chose instead to clean it himself together with his own balie. This was the quality of leader we had in Madiba."
