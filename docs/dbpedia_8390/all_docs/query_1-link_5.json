        "text": "media release\n\nAugust 7, 2024\n\nTIFF Docs 2024 delivers revelatory documentaries on unforgettable figures and era-defining global topics\n\nToronto — TIFF is delighted to announce the 2024 selection for its Docs programme presented by A&E IndieFilms, featuring 21 titles from 24 countries around the world. This year’s lineup covers a wide range of experiences: comical, infuriating, revelatory, audacious, and profound, with an underlying theme of pushing back against corrupt systems. Audiences will encounter unforgettable figures such as former Vice host Eddie Huang, novelist Edna O’Brien, US politician Adam Kinzinger, disability rights activist Patrice Jetter, aerial cameraman Joe Jennings, and the haenyeo fisherwomen of South Korea. The 49th edition of the Toronto International Film Festival, presented by Rogers, will take place September 5–15, 2024.\n\nNew this year, we have asked a few TIFF Programmers to share their insights into this year’s films. Watch Docs Lead Programmer Thom Powers’ summary here:\n\nThe TIFF Docs programme features candid and unscripted stories, and the best in non-fiction cinema from around the world. The programme will open with Huang’s Vice is Broke, in which the former Vice contributor investigates the media company’s rise and fall.
