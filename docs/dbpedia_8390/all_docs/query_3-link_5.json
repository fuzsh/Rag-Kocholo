        "text": "Amina Cachalia, anti-apartheid activist\n\nNelson Mandela came to my 21st birthday party, and was a friend and confidant all my life. We were parted when he was sent to Robben Island in 1964, and I didn't see him again for another quarter of a century.\n\nI tried many applications to visit him on Robben Island but was always turned down. Finally, they gave my husband, Yusuf, and me permission to visit when he was moved to Pollsmoor prison. It was scary in a way. I was so excited and so absolutely beside myself because I didn't realise what I was going to be confronted with. I was worried: would he be the same, would he look the same man I had seen 25 or 26 years before?\n\nIt proved a wonderful visit, it was just a tremendous time. But his skin was a sort of sallow colour. I kept asking him: \"Are you well? You've lost so much weight and your skin has changed colour.\"\n\nHe said: \"My skin can't change colour.\" He was ill already – I don't think he knew he was so ill – and just a week or so later he took very ill. Yet he wasn't depressed at all. He was very jovial and wanted to know about the children and what they're doing and about other members of the family. He was his usual talkative self. We couldn't talk politics. There were these policemen sitting very close to us, listening to every word. We kept to the family situation.\n\nLater Mandela was moved again to Victor Verster prison, his final place of incarceration, and I went to visit again. Someone had given me a camera so I could take what would be the first picture of him that anyone had seen for decades. But he stopped me.\n\nWe were at the lunch table and I was reaching for my handbag. He stopped me because I didn't realise the place was bugged and if I did proceed with the photograph they would probably have confiscated the camera and terminated my visit there and then. I told him long after: \"You know, you deprived me of becoming a millionairess, I would have sold your damn picture to everybody I could think of, I would have been a very, very wealthy woman!\"\n\nSo he said: \"Yeah, you always used me, didn't you?'\n\nI said: \"I don't know, you used me sometimes too!\"\n\nHe stood by his principles but his family suffered a great deal. He hadn't seen his children very much even before he went to prison because he was always busy running around, hiding underground. He hardly saw the babies. I think if anything ever bothered him in prison, apart from not being able to fight for liberation outside prison walls, it was the fact that he couldn't care for his family.\n\nHe never wanted to be put on a pedestal. His family will remember him as the man he has been all his life. A caring man, a dedicated man to the freedom and people of South Africa. I think that's how I would remember him: as my friend who cared for all of us. There are many who did the same, but he lasted longest. The day he was released was so, so, so special. I think the world stood still for us that day.\n\nAmina Cachalia died in January 2013. After her death her son revealed that she had rebuffed a marriage proposal from Mandela in the 1990s.\n\nAlbie Sachs, South African judge and activist\n\nThroughout the time I knew Nelson Mandela – a period spanning more than 50 years – there was always that smile, that grace, that warmth and assuredness that set him apart.\n\nI knew him both as the legend and as a person. I knew him in the 1950s when he was a young lawyer and I was a student at the University of Cape Town. Then I saw the legend grow when I was in exile and he was in prison, and I knew him as a comrade when we negotiated South Africa's transition to democracy.\n\nAs a student in the early 1950s I would, whenever I came up to Johannesburg, drop in to the law practice that Mandela and Oliver Tambo had set up. It would always be packed: there were workers, peasants, men and women from all walks of life with a variety of problems. Mandela, despite the limited time he had, would always ask how the struggle was progressing in the Cape and offer a cup of tea. We had lots of leaders then, but Mandela had begun to emerge as a figure of authority.\n\nI met him again when he was underground in the early 1960s. Even then, that magnetic smile shone through, that same dignity.\n\nWhen we were negotiating with the National party and others at the World Trade Centre outside Johannesburg in the early 1990s we would work late into the night. One day when only Cyril Ramaphosa, Mac Maharaj and I were left, the National party put a new proposal on the table that had the potential to move things forward significantly. They wanted an answer urgently. We could not on our own make that decision so we decided to drive to the then still very white and affluent suburb of Houghton where Mandela lived. It was about midnight when we got there.\n\nIt was dark and there were no bodyguards. We could not get anyone to wake up. Cyril decided to stand in the street and throw stones at an upper-floor window he believed was that of Mandela's bedroom. In the meantime he half shouted and half whispered: \"Tata! Tata! [Father! Father!] It's us!\"\n\nThe light came on, then another in the living room, then the door opened. Mandela emerged in his sleeping gown, laughing: \"I thought these would be my last moments.\"\n\nWe saw more of his anger in those days. During negotiations, when Mandela kept on insisting the voting age should be lowered to around 15, I was sent by the other ANC leaders to go and speak to him and make him realise this was not feasible. The first two times I went to see him he was very firm and said no. The third time he realised this was a serious matter. He was stung and a bit angry.\n\nLater that day he came over and had a cup of tea with me. He said it was not personal and that was that. It was over. He later admitted that he was wrong and said that even presidents can be wrong.\n\nBut throughout, for me, there was a dignity, a sense of assuredness, polish, style about him. And he looked great in a dressing gown.\n\nBenjamin Pogrund, South African journalist\n\nAt the age of 41, Nelson Mandela was already a proven leader in the struggle against apartheid. He was elected head of the ANC in the Transvaal; in the 1940s he had been a founder of the ANC Youth League; in the 1950s he was volunteer-in-chief in the defiance campaign against unjust laws. Severe banning orders barred him from public political activity, and as the 1960s began he was a defendant in the Treason Trial.\n\nHe could hardly have shown greater commitment to the cause of freedom yet a playboy image clung to him in the ANC. The whisper among some was that he was not to be taken seriously. It sprang from his imposing appearance: tall, handsome, impeccably dressed in a suit when most black people were poor and shabby; there was his reputation as a ladies' man and his second marriage to the beautiful Winnie; there was the fact that he was a solicitor, one of the tiny number of the elite among black people; and he owned a car, a rarity among black people at the time.\n\nThe tumultuous events that swept through South Africa after the police shooting of 69 unarmed protesters at Sharpeville on 21 March 1960 tested Mandela to the limit. The ANC and the rival Pan Africanist Congress – whose call for action had precipitated Sharpeville – were banned and the government began to seize and imprison the leaders. Mandela went underground and started to plan a stay-at-home strike against the government for May 1961.\n\nThe entire police force hunted him. He eluded them. He was known as the Black Pimpernel. The playboy nonsense was never heard again.\n\nI already knew Mandela because I was reporting black politics for the then Rand Daily Mail in Johannesburg. We set up secret meetings by sending messages through trusted people. We met at the home of Adelaide and Paul Joseph (who later moved to London) near Johannesburg city centre, or I would park my car at night in a dark spot in a quiet street and Mandela would appear. His disguise, doing little to conceal him, was a worker's boiler suit.\n\nWe did not discuss great political principles but dealt with the problems and challenges he was dealing with every day. I was deeply impressed. There was purpose and determination in him. I was conscious that he had deliberately walked away from a comfortable and secure life at a level to which very few black people could have aspired at that time. He was leaving behind Winnie and their two young daughters and putting his life on the line. There was never a single word of complaint or regret.\n\nGovernment pressures ensured his call for a mass strike failed. He phoned me at the end of the first day. I was miserable because my newspaper had blundered: a special edition in the morning had mistakenly downplayed the effects of the strike, destroying any chance of it succeeding. With astonishing generosity, Mandela told me he knew it was not my fault. Later that night, he phoned again – with the first public statement that he believed there was no longer a place for non-violent resistance to apartheid. Shortly after, he led the ANC in switching to a policy of armed resistance.\n\nI did not see or speak to Mandela again for the next 20 years. He slipped out of the country, returned months later, was betrayed and captured, put on trial twice, and sentenced to life imprisonment for seeking to overthrow the government. He ended up in Robben Island maximum security prison and vanished from the world's gaze and knowledge. His name seldom featured, even though he was remembered and respected among black people in South Africa. Among white people, except for a few, it was bad manners even to mention his name.\n\nDespite the lack of contact, word was coming out of Robben Island that Mandela was assuming a new stature. Released prisoners reported that he had become the acknowledged leader of all the political prisoners; that not only the ANC, but also Pan Africanist Congress members, the African Resistance Movement and others respected him and accepted his authority. He was the wise man who adjudicated in disputes.\n\nHis name was also slowly assuming new significance in the country. Afrikaner leaders were beginning to realise that they could not hold on to power and privilege for ever. They were worried lest Mandela, now in his 60s, died in prison and became a martyr in the apartheid struggle. Offers of release were made to him, provided he agreed to retire to the Transkei Bantustan \"homeland\". He rejected the overtures.\n\nAs a sign of the shifting scene he and five other ANC leaders were moved from Robben Island to Pollsmoor prison on the mainland. He was the same warm and friendly person I had known all those years before. But there was a gravitas to him. He had come through the fire and was steeled and strong. His visits were still restricted and it took a long time to set up another one.\n\nMandela told us about an illness, for which he was treated in a nearby private hospital. Winnie had come to visit him: \"The sun came into the room,\" he said. He said he had been taken on a drive and had walked on grass for the first time in more than 20 years. He had to work out how to open the car door: years before, car handles protruded and now they were recessed.\n\nThese details apart, Mandela was a commanding figure. The prison officer in the room deferred to him. When we were saying goodbye in the entrance hall it was hard to believe that this was a man who was going to be locked in that night.\n\nIt was to be another four years before he was released. When I visited him there, I came away knowing that this was a changed man.\n\nMac Maharaj, politician, friend and fellow prisoner\n\nMandela used the time in prison for rigorous self-examination, not just in a personal sense but examination of the political goals and vision that were driving him and the ANC. One of his strengths was his ability to look at himself; this was something he deepened and broadened during 27 years in prison. He had a willingness in our discussions in jail to say \"maybe we were wrong\", which didn't play well in many quarters.\n\nWhen you are in prison, your first instinct is to say: \"Shut up, don't question yourself … if you question yourself, you weaken yourself in the eyes of the enemy.\" And yet he would ask: \"Were we right, when we resisted removal from Sophiatown\" – a multi-racial township cleared in 1954 – \"with the slogans 'We shall not move' and 'Over our dead bodies'?\" We were not ready to defend our people when push came to shove, yet we created a slogan that created an expectation. He would ask: \"What is it about a slogan? What's its role? What's its foundation?\"\n\nOur years in prison were also vital in that they gave us a chance to interact with our white jailers – we were cheek by jowl with them on Robben Island; they were almost imprisoned with us – to try to begin to understand what was driving them.\n\nWhen we went to prison most of us were not speaking Afrikaans. I argued with Mandela about whether we should study the language. He'd say: \"Let's do it together.\" I'd say I'm not interested in this language, first of all it's not even an international language, and second it's the language of the oppressor. He'd reply: \"Look, man, we're in for a long struggle, a protracted struggle. It's going to be a war of attrition.\" He'd say: \"How are we going to lead the enemy forces into an ambush? To do that we look at the enemy's commander and try to understand him. To do that, we've got to read his literature, read his poetry. So shall we study Afrikaans?\"\n\nWe were locked up in cells with a window to the corridor, but two panes were removed so we could talk to the warder. Most of us saw the jailers as the enemy, but Madiba was always polite to them. There were situations where they did things that annoyed him and to which he took strong exception, for example the times when a prisoner was beaten up. There were enough reasons to take great exception to them, and there were some very nasty characters. There was a warder, we called him Suitcase, but his name was Van Rensburg; he had a swastika on his hand.\n\nThe work in prison was quarry work. They used to have a tradition: each warder would select a prisoner who was their \"handy boy\" who would carry their flask and their lunchbox. Suitcase would shout for a prisoner to \"bring the baas his coffee\" and to carry his suitcase – his lunch pack. He'd grown up in the prison system. It was an abusive relationship, the idea that authority was there in his skin. Madiba did not allow any of them to provoke him. His attitude was: \"They're just the cannon-fodder of the system and we've got to focus on what's behind them.\"\n\nIt was often bloody cold, and the regulations say you were to be given three blankets. But they didn't specify warm blankets. If you wanted to get good blankets … well, that depended on your interaction with them.\n\nThe ordering of your day-to-day life depended on your interaction with the warders. You could do what they wanted – maybe call them \"baas\" and in doing so imply that you accepted the racial paradigm – that you were their inferior. Or you could do it the way we did it. We never called them \"baas\"; we were not going to run when they said run. They wanted you to run, and we said: \"No, we're going to work and we will walk like dignified human beings.\" We wanted to maintain a relationship as a result of which we were starting to shape the environment, to turn it into what we wanted it to be.\n\nHelen Suzman, veteran politician who opposed apartheid\n\nI do not believe Nelson Mandela was a saint. On many occasions he expressed his anger, sometimes even in public. But in my interactions with him from 1967 when snhI first visited him and other political prisoners on Robben Island, he always had a remarkable sense of humour. He had an amazing way of communicating with people, particularly the young, He mesmerised them. It was not a politician's way: unlike many politicians he had a warmth to him, a real warmth.\n\nWhen I first visited Robben Island, I was the lone member of the Progressive party in parliament, the sole opposition. I had heard about ill-treatment of prisoners on the island and I had decided to see for myself. That was my slogan as an MP: \"See for yourself!\"\n\nAt the time the minister of justice was Piet Peltzer, and he said all the allegations of ill treatment were untrue. When I arrived I was taken to the single cells where the political prisoners were. Eddie Daniels' cell was the closest to the door. When I went to him, he said: \"We know who you are. Go right to the end and you will find our leader, Nelson Mandela.\"\n\nSo even then his leadership was acknowledged. I remember that even in that first meeting I thought that he was a man who exuded a lot of authority. His understanding of the situation in the country, just from a few minutes of discussion, convinced me that he would be an essential component of any negotiation process on the country's future. I did not realise that it would take so long to get there, of course.\n\nMandela was very courageous in that meeting. The head of the prison was with me and yet he was not cowed. He told me they had a particularly vicious warder called Van Rensburg who displayed a swastika on his arm. He told me their clothes were not warm enough, they were not allowed visits and the food was very bad. Finally Van Rensburg was removed from Robben Island.\n\nI continued to see Mandela at Robben Island and later when he was moved to Pollsmoor and Victor Verster prisons. Seeing and chatting to him made me stronger in certain ways – I made speeches every year in parliament calling for the release of all political prisoners. And I continued to agitate for changes to the inhumane conditions. So bed rolls became beds, they had access to newspapers and study privileges.\n\nI do not think that our country would have become what it is without the magnanimity that he and FW de Klerk showed in the late 1980s and early 90s. That is their greatest achievement.\n\nHelen Suzman died in 2009\n\nZackie Achmat, anti-apartheid and HIV campaigner\n\nIn July 2002 I became ill with a lung infection. I was in bed and could not move. I was refusing to take any antiretroviral drugs because I believed that the government of South Africa should roll out treatment to all affected South Africans who wanted to get the drugs. The government was dragging its feet.\n\nI had only met Mandela once before, at an awards ceremony. One day, while I was lying in bed, the telephone rang and my housemate said to me: \"Zackie, it's Nelson Mandela on the line.\" In his usual blunt manner he said: \"Zackie, I want you to take your medicine.\" I told him that I did not do business that way and that what I was doing was part of a principled stand. Why should I live when millions were being allowed to die?\n\nHe did not give up. He sent Jakes Gerwel, one of his closest confidantes, to negotiate with me and the Treatment Action Campaign (TAC). His view was that I should take the drugs and live to continue the fight. In December that year he came to Cape Town and saw me and my comrades in the TAC. I was still not taking the drugs. One of the TAC leaders, Mercy Damane, gave him a T-shirt with the words \"HIV positive\" as a gift. He immediately took it out of its wrapper and put it on.\n\nHe was the first South African leader to openly identify with and embrace people living with HIV. I decided that day to start antiretroviral treatment. I believe it was through his courageous action that our government finally relented and started rolling out HIV drugs.\n\nFor me his contribution to the cause of removing the stigma and denial around Aids is far more important than his participation in the liberation struggle: with the struggle he was swimming with the tide – he had around him leaders such as Oliver Tambo and Walter Sisulu. But he was the only one who stood up and called for the country to deal with HIV. He has been let down by a government that failed to deal with the issue aggressively.\n\nMandela was a surrogate father for me – as he was for many young South Africans. He was a mythical figure for us activists. We did not agree with him in the early 1990s when he was reconciliatory towards the apartheid regime, but we respected and trusted him.\n\nAs a former political activist and as an Aids activist, I would say Mandela is not only responsible for giving me freedom but also for giving me my life.\n\nFW de Klerk, last president of apartheid-era South Africa\n\nMy first meeting with Nelson Mandela was on the evening of 13 December 1989 – a few months after I became president and before his release – at a secret encounter at my office in Tuynhuys, Cape Town. He was taller than I expected though a little stooped by his 71 years. I was immediately struck by his charm and his leadership qualities.\n\nWe discussed the ANC demand for majority rule on the one hand and the need for structural guarantees for minorities on the other. At the end of our brief meeting I concluded he was a man with whom I would be able to do business.\n\nHe had a great sense of dignity. He was courteous and self-confident. Later in my relationship with him I learned that he could also be remorseless and harsh – but then we were, after all, political opponents. He had the leadership of a natural aristocrat. One should remember that in his youth he was trained to become a key adviser to the paramount chief of his Thembu people.\n\nHe showed the power of perseverance and of reconciliation. There is a fairytale quality to the idea of a boy who herded cattle in Qunu becoming the president of a modern state and an international icon. His great contribution lies in the fact that he emerged from 27 years of imprisonment with so little bitterness and was able to make such a great contribution to national reconciliation and to the birth of the new South Africa.\n\nMangosuthu Buthelezi, founder of Inkatha Freedom party\n\nI first met Nelson Mandela when I visited the law offices he shared with Oliver Tambo in Johannesburg. Mandela was a friend of my late father-in-law, Zachariah Mzila. They sometimes played draughts at the Bantu Men's Social Centre in Eloff Street extension – just down the road from my father-in-law's home. We developed a strong friendship. I remember that even at that very first visit to their offices, he invited me to have dinner in his home in Orlando, Soweto. He was then still married to Evelyn, his first wife.\n\nThe great bond was of course our membership of the ANC. He would speak at ANC rallies in Durban, where I lived after I was rusticated from the University of Fort Hare.\n\nWe continued to correspond when he was in jail. He would sometimes address letters direct to me on some occasion, such as when my Cousin King Cyprian died. He would address some letters to my wife Irene, but they were my letters. I held many rallies, both in Durban and Johannesburg, at which I campaigned for his release. On one occasion I celebrated his birthday with a rally at Umlazi stadium. We last corresponded in 1989, just a few months before he was released – he was concerned about the internecine violence between members of the United Democratic Front-ANC axis and members of Inkatha; 20 000 people had died. He expressed the hope that when he was released he would come to see me so that we together could do something about the violence.\n\nGerry Adams, Irish republican politician\n\nI first met Nelson Mandela in June 1995. It was almost a year after the IRA cessation and just over a year since the first post-apartheid election, which returned Madiba as president of a free South Africa. Several colleagues and I had travelled there at the invitation of the ANC to speak to senior figures from that party who had been centrally involved in the negotiations.\n\nThe ANC also arranged meetings with representatives from the National party, General Constand Viljoen, leader of the Freedom Front party, and Niel Barnard, the head of the apartheid regime's National Intelligence Service.\n\nIn developing the Sinn Féin peace strategy towards the end of the 1980s and into the early 1990s, Irish republicans had recognised the importance of the international community as an ally for making progress in a peace process and as a source of inspiration and information for our own endeavours.\n\nWhile much of our focus was on America, which had the greatest concentration of the Irish diaspora, Irish republicans had always had a close affinity with the struggle in South Africa. In my youth I had taken part in protests against the visit of the Springbok rugby team and I was a long-time supporter of the anti-apartheid movement. The purpose of our trip in 1995 was to learn the lessons of South Africa's approach to conflict resolution and to brief people on the difficulties in our process.\n\nWalter Sisulu, Cyril Ramaphosa, Thabo Mbeki, Cheryl Carolus and many other leaders of the ANC made us very welcome. However, for all in our group the highlight of our visit was the meeting with Madiba. He was self-effacing in his humour, relaxed and focused. As ever the British government, and sections of the British media, had made much about whether or not there would be a handshake, a photograph and so on. The Major government had lobbied hard for Mandela not to meet me. We shook hands in his office: \"Ah, comrade Gerry,\" he said. \"I'll not wash my hand for a week.\"\n\nI met Madiba many times afterwards. Even after leaving the presidency, his mind was razor-sharp, and he was as conversant with the twists and turns of our process as he was with the affairs of his own continent. Nelson Mandela remains one of my heroes and was, in my view, the greatest political leader of our time.\n\nDouglas Hurd, foreign secretary 1989-1995\n\nThe job of building a friendly relationship between Margaret Thatcher's government and the ANC under Nelson Mandela was never going to be easy. In the past Margaret had referred to it as a terrorist organisation. She had consistently opposed anything except the gentlest of sanctions against the apartheid government. Yet we clearly needed a friendly relationship and the job had to start somewhere.\n\nMy diary shows that I spent much of the independence celebrations in Namibia in March 1990 trying to avoid a meeting with Yasser Arafat and trying to bring about a meeting with Mandela. I managed to see him for a few minutes at the end of the final banquet.\n\nWe must have met half a dozen times between that first encounter, slightly edgy on my side, and the Queen's visit in 1995, over which he presided as the president of a new South Africa. Trust between us grew. He was ready to go beyond courtesy and talk frankly about his problems and the choices before him.\n\nThis process prospered because Mandela knew more than the rest of the world about Margaret's real attitude on South Africa. Although she thoroughly disliked being pushed around on sanctions, she was never in doubt that apartheid was bound to fail. In private she leaned on the two last presidents of white South Africa, PW Botha and FW de Klerk. In particular, she urged them to release Mandela. Moreover, she and her foreign secretary were just about the only figures in the outside world who could encourage De Klerk to persevere with negotiation.\n\nAlthough I never watched De Klerk and Mandela negotiating with each other, I heard a great deal from each about the other. They were never at ease with one another. Mandela recognised that De Klerk was not apologising for apartheid or admitting that it was wrong. De Klerk had simply come to the conclusion, like De Gaulle in Algeria, that the game was over and that in the interests of South Africa as a whole he must hand over to the black majority as much power as their leader Mandela insisted on.\n\nDe Klerk's great contribution was that he reached this conclusion while he still maintained full physical control of the country. There was no penitence in his negotiating stance but it gave Mandela what he needed. He explained to me his frustrations as the negotiations wound on, and in particular his worry at the danger of armed conflict in the townships.\n\nI continued to be enveloped in Mandela's exceptional courtesy. He was one of the three politest men I ever met, the others being Sir Alec Douglas-Home and King Hussein of Jordan. All three came from the aristocracy of their country. They never needed to consider who they were or worry about their status. They thus gained the assurance to treat others as equals.\n\nMandela's courtesy in small things derived more widely from his underlying belief that the way forward for South Africa lay in discussion and reconciliation.\n\nIt would have been strange if I had become an intimate of Mandela and I never did; but I came to understand and deeply respect the nature of his vision.\n\nJessie Duarte, anti-apartheid activist and assistant to Mandela\n\nIn May 1990, just a few months after his release from prison, I got a call to come and see Madiba at Shell House [the ANC's headquarters]. As you can imagine I went with alacrity. Like everyone else I had grown up with stories about this man and knew well his famous words from the Rivonia Trial.\n\nI was very struck by his humility. He said: \"Would you like to work for me?\" I got to know him quite well after that and never once did I see him being unkind or inconsiderate to people. I worked with him through the negotiations for democracy and saw him, on many occasions, listen to people and change his views.\n\nThe Mandela legacy? When I started working with him he was obsessed with including all sectors of the country in the process we were going through. I think his key legacy is dialogue. He got the bitterest of enemies to speak to each other. He was never afraid of opening up debate and talking things through until there was a possibility of a solution.\n\nHe did not have much patience for narrow interests and believed in consulting everyone. He was a very big human, with a big heart, yet always saw himself as the smallest of people.\n\nGillian Slovo, novelist and daughter of Ruth First and Joe Slovo\n\nIn the early morning of 6 January 1995 my two sisters and I found ourselves sitting opposite Nelson Mandela. Our father, Joe Slovo, who had had cancer, had just died. Mandela, who had visited the previous day to say goodbye, had been the first person we had phoned with the news, and he had immediately come over. Or at least not immediately, for despite being president of the country, he first had to organise himself a lift to the house Joe shared with his second wife, Helena. When he arrived, he went to view Joe's body and then he came into the living room to sit with us.\n\nWe were in shock. He made the conversational running, which was one of his many skills. He described the hoops he'd had to jump over to reach us, telling us how he'd rung this comrade and that, – he carefully named each of them – all of whom, because it was so early, and he did not try to hide his amusement for this frailty, had failed to pick up. Finally he remembered a man who had been suspended by the ANC for some minor infraction of discipline and who was only too pleased to show repentance by driving his president anywhere he wanted at any time of day or night.\n\nA pause and then Mandela changed the subject. He looked at us three sisters sitting together and then told us how once, when he had gone to hug one of his daughters she had shied away from him. When he'd asked her what was wrong, her reply was that although he had been the father of all the nation, he had never been a father to her. And why was he telling us this story on that early morning within hours of our father's death? Because what he was really saying, and what he went on to say, was that he understood the sacrifices that the families of activists had to make. This, he continued, was his greatest, perhaps his only, regret: that his children, and the children of his comrades, had suffered for their parents' commitment.\n\nIt was a fitting story: a validation of the difficulties we children had endured in our parents' long march to freedom [Ruth First was killed by a parcel bomb]. And it was the mark of the tremendous humanity of the man, and his great gift for connection, that he chose to say it then.\n\nMandela was not unique in this. If apartheid had made South Africa a place of grief and family break-up, the generation to which Mandela belonged and which included other greats such as Walter Sisulu and Oliver Tambo, cleaved hard to the importance of family. And by family they meant not just blood relations but the wider family that was the ANC.\n\nThe men who had been locked up on Robben Island for life at a time when life really did seem to mean life, took each of their children's successes and difficulties to their communal hearts. When, in the mid 1970s, after the Soweto rebellions, some of these children started joining Steve Biko's Black Consciousness party, they discussed what should be their response – and decided, together, that just as they had had their own paths to political maturity so then must their children be left to make their own decisions. And they did this in the full knowledge of the stony paths their choices had laid down for their families.\n\nGiven the costs of their commitment it is remarkable that so many of those children – Thabo Mbeki springs to mind, as well as the large Sisulu clan – involved themselves in the struggle that caused them further loss, imprisonment, torture and exile.\n\nEmerging from prison Mandela seemed to delight in the company of children. My daughter was often on his knee or being shown by him the way to the toilet in the middle of a formal meal. A friend's child, whose father Mandela had removed from the cabinet, got an early-morning call from him apologising for the pain that this demotion must have caused her. And, when visiting London, Mandela invited us three sisters to come to lunch during which he spoke shamefacedly of how long he had been out of touch and how wrong this was – since he, with the death of Joe, had become our father.\n\nThis stress on family and the importance of continuity was one of the ANC's great strengths. And yet that contradiction that had always existed between people who cared so much about humanity that they were prepared to jeopardise their family's security was, now that the worst of the struggle was over, increasingly clear.\n\nIt was illustrated by the anger of Mandela's daughter and by the moment when, in 1990, the plane carrying some of the men who had spent decades jailed in Robben landed in Lusaka, Zambia, then headquarters of the exiled ANC. On the tarmac was collected a welcoming committee. As the doors to the former prisoners opened, Max Sisulu broke ranks to hug his father, Walter.\n\nYet in that same lineup was another son – Thabo Mbeki – and he waited patiently for his father, Govan, to shake each hand in turn until he reached his son who, he was later to remark, was a comrade like any other. He was unwilling to show favouritism – a stark reminder of the sacrifices that the children of activists always had to make.\n\nThe older generation might answer the charges of their children, as Joe Slovo did, by saying that \"the world would be a poorer place if it was peopled by children whose parents risked nothing in the cause of social justice, for fear of personal loss\", but this loss still existed. It is a mark of the complexity of the man that Mandela not only knew it but he was also able to name it. His children may not entirely agree – the family pictures of the Mandela generations reunited seemed both celebratory and simultaneously poignant – but this was perhaps a circle that could never have been squared.\n\nAlan Titchmarsh, gardener and broadcaster\n\nMaking a garden for Nelson Mandela will remain one of my proudest boasts. There were those who raised their eyebrows at Groundforce, a TV makeover show, being allowed to construct a garden for such a legendary figure, but I like to think we gave him a garden that pleased him. It certainly seemed that way, and it was gardening, after all, that got him through those seemingly interminable years on Robben Island.\n\nPlants, he told me, were special. They were the one thing over which a prisoner could exercise control. He grew his own crops in the prison garden on the edge of the compound: nurturing, watering and cultivating a handful of plants, including a few tomatoes. When one of them died, he felt the loss so keenly that he gave it a formal burial, laying its roots and shoots in a hole and covering them with dust.\n\nNothing about the man was disappointing. His quiet charisma was awe-inspiring. He exuded a gentle kind of strength. Feeling him enter a room – or a garden – was to feel a kind of heat, a towering presence. Powerful, yet never overbearing. But there were one or two surprises: he was taller than I had imagined – over 1.8 metres (6ft) – and his smooth and wrinkle-free hands seemed to be those of a 30-year-old – all the more surprising knowing the amount of rock they had broken over a quarter of a century of incarceration.\n\nWhen I asked why he felt no bitterness his answer was typically pragmatic: \"There is no time for bitterness; there is too much to do.\"\n\nAs I showed him round the garden he kept muttering \"Gee-whizz!\" like an amazed schoolboy. We stayed for tea and cakes, and chatted about this and that. \"What do you remember about being released?\" I asked.\n\n\"I remember my first public meeting,\" he replied. \"It happened to be a church meeting. We were outdoors. There were people all down the valleys and up the hills; wherever I looked, all I could see was faces. There were thousands of them.\"\n\nThen he looked at me and winked. \"It took them two weeks to count the collection.\"\n\nJustice Malala, political analyst and journalist\n\nOn the evening of 6 August 1990 I sat around a small radio with a group of young activists and wept. Nelson Mandela had just announced that the African National Congress's armed struggle had been suspended.\n\n\"This is the only weapon we have. How could he do this?\" Joseph Mogale, a leader of the local ANC Youth League branch, asked. It was a debilitating announcement. For the angry youths we were then, it meant capitulation. In our view, Mandela had offered everything, even though the apartheid regime had offered nothing in return. We cursed him.\n\nThat evening hundreds of ANC leaders swarmed into black townships across the country, addressing – cajoling – young men and women at rallies and meetings. They begged for calm. They said this was a strategic retreat, not surrender. But the anger would not go away. Mandela, we muttered, had gone soft.\n\nIn the Pretoria Minute, the document in which both parties agreed to end the armed struggle, we saw nothing of Mandela's vision for a new South Africa. In the townships, thousands of black people were dying as a result of action by the armed forces and government-sponsored \"black-on-black violence\".\n\nThis would not be the last time that we, the young ones, would be angry with Mandela. In 1996, when the Truth and Reconciliation Commission got into its stride, we wondered again: has Mandela gone soft? Why is he bending over backwards to accommodate white people?\n\nNumerous black people took to the TRC stage and told of the torture and hunger they had suffered at the hands of the apartheid government. Mothers appeared and wept for lost sons and daughters. Young women told of rape and violation by white policemen. And from South Africa's white people there was a white silence. None of them, it seemed, had supported apartheid. No policeman had taken part in torture and the killings of thousands of activists.\n\nWhose Truth Commission was it? For many of us, the TRC was an instrument through which we would find out from the authorities how our fellow activists had died and why. We wanted to look into the eyes of the killers and torturers and get at least an admission of guilt.\n\nNone came. Instead, they hired batteries of lawyers and spokespersons to defend themselves. Even while the commission sat, many guilty people were destroying intelligence files containing incriminating evidence.\n\nAnd Mandela? Well, Mandela, now president of our country, kept saying that the commission would, in time, be of benefit to all South Africans.\n\nAnd he was right, of course, just as he had been when he signed the Pretoria Minute six years earlier. Despite the fact that we have not uncovered the truths of the deaths of many of our friends, many of us now recognise the beauty of the TRC: it was for us – to bring about our own confrontation with what happened, and to enable our own healing.\n\nFor those who had stood against apartheid, emotions had been largely suppressed or ignored in the march towards victory. In the TRC we finally spoke among ourselves about what happened. It was about us and not about our former oppressors.\n\nMandela was not always the one. I grew up in the 1970s when it was all about the Black Consciousness Movement, and he didn't really count. I remember my brother would come home and spin stories of an Africa free from colonial rule. He would talk to us of student firebrand Stephen Bantu Biko, of Mamphela Ramphele and others. The 1976 Soweto riots were inspired by the Black Consciousness Movement. My brother had an afro. \"We are black and we are proud! Uhuru! [freedom]\" he would shout. Nelson Mandela was an old guy, talked of reverentially by my father, but to us he seemed distant, a shadow.\n\nHowever, the activists of the 1970s were driven into exile by the apartheid regime, and in exile they began to be absorbed into the ANC, which used them effectively. Some became propagandists, some ambassadors, many became political commissars and soldiers. Early in the 80s they began to return to the country with the cry that the struggle must be intensified from within.\n\nIt was at this time that I and other young South Africans discovered the power of Mandela. A friend of my brother, I recall, was at the University of the North and would send home banned reading material from the ANC. They exhorted the youth to call for Mandela's release. Having been a shadow figure, he now became immediate and urgent to us. Mention of his name in the wrong circumstances could get one detained without trial for months. The apartheid regime vilified him as a communist and agitator. The more they did, the more we loved him.\n\nBy 1986 Mandela's name was so powerful that for many black South Africans the immediate focus of the struggle wasn't freedom from apartheid – we simply wanted Mandela out of jail. If anything displayed the iniquity of the apartheid regime it was his continued incarceration.\n\nWinnie Mandela fed the fire of our discontent. She took on an almost papal symbolism: she would tell of Mandela's wellbeing and the messages he sent from jail. She was his representative among us. Every morsel of information she fed us added to the magic of the Mandela name.\n\nAs a young student in Cape Town in 1989 one of the first things my friends and I did was to walk up Table mountain. \"He is there,\" said one of the leaders when we had gone high enough and could see Robben Island.\n\nFew of us knew what he looked like; few of had ever seen pictures of him (they were banned). In the late 1980s student activists began putting sketches of him on T-shirts. It was an invitation for immediate beating and detention.\n\nMandela hauled the young ones into a new South Africa. Along the way, particularly in the 1990s, he was called everything from soft to a stooge of the regime. But today we know the necessity of his actions.\n\nMandela managed to drag the young and angry along with him because he had once been a very angry young man himself. In the late 1940s and early 50s he had been one of the powerful young ANC leaders who installed a radical new leadership and programme of action.\n\nHow do I remember Nelson Mandela? In George Orwell's famous story a young British policeman stationed in Burma walks towards an elephant that has just killed a villager. There are 2,000 Burmese following him. He is the only one with a gun. They all want him to kill the elephant. He knows that it would be wrong to do so because the elephant no longer poses a threat to anyone. But he is scared of looking a fool – and regarded as weak – by the villagers. So he shoots the elephant.\n\nWhen Mandela came out of prison there were millions of us behind him. We all urged him at the top of our voices to act radical, to shoot the apartheid elephant and cause a conflagration. He did not.\n\nHe is the greatest, most courageous and honest leader we ever had. He gave us – the so-called \"lost generation\" of South Africa – a future. He saved us."
