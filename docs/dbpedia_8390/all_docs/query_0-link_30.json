        "text": "espYOUNGLEGEND 2019 EDGAR MUZAH & FRIENDS (SA)\n\nEdgar Muzah is a bass player originally from Zimbabwe and now residing in Port Elizabeth, South Africa, and the winner of espAfrika’s 2019 talent search competition. Muzah has toured extensively in Zimbabwe and South Africa as well as to other countries across the world.\n\nNotably, he has performed at the Bayimba Festival in Uganda, Belfast Alive in Ireland and the Finnish Jazz Festival in Finland. He makes his debut at the Cape Town International Jazz Festival in March 2019. Project Dimensions, one of his initiatives featuring most of the artists he has worked with, produced and written music for, has also toured to various European countries.\n\nApart from personal projects, Muzah has also worked as a producer and composer for a number of other artists. His efforts with Zimbabwean world music artist Willis Wataffi received three Zimbabwe Music Awards awards in 2016. Other award-winning musicians he has worked with include Chumani Ngojo, the 2015 Crown gospel award winner; Phumlani Mtiti, a 2013 South African Music Award winner; and multi-award winner and platinum selling afro soul rising star Nathi.\n\nTUKU MUSIC - A Celebration of Oliver Mtukudzi’s life through his music (ZIM/SA)\n\nThis tribute show will commemorate the life of Oliver Mtukudzi who was originally scheduled to perform at this year’s CTIJF with Vusi Mahlasela.\n\nMahlasela will be joined on stage by Berita, Maduvha and Mbeu. The Sotho singer-songwriter is often called “The Voice” of South Africa and his music is generally referred to as African folk. ​\n\nZimbabwean-born, South African-based Gugulethu Khumalo is an award winning singer-songwriger who uses the stage name Berita. The Afro-soul singer shared the stage with Mtukudzi on occasion and collaborated with him and Hugh Masekela on the single Mwana Wa Mai. Born Ashton Nyahora, the Afro-fusion artist known as Mbeu was a product of Tuku’s Pakare Arts Centre in Chivero in Mashonaland West, Zimbabwe and often collaborated with Mtukudzi. They recorded the single My Better Half together. Maduvha Madima, generally better known as Queen Vele from Muvhango, is a SAMA nominated vocalist in her own right, who collaborated with Mtukudzi on the track Ndimecha on his album Eheka! Nhai Yahwe.\n\nALISTAIR IZOBELL (SA)\n\nAlistair Izobell has been mesmerising audiences since he played the role of newspaper vendor Broertjie in Taliep Petersen and David Kramer’s District 6 - The Musical, as a nine-year-old in 1986. Three years later, as a member of Ricardo and Friends, he was invited to perform Children of the World at the infamous World Popular Song Festival in Tokyo. The song was chosen as the National Anthem of UNICEF and they were special guests performing alongside the likes of Stevie Wonder and Bonnie Tyler.\n\nIn the following years, Izobell has worked with some of the most successful of South Africa’s recording artists such as Brenda Fassie, PJ Powers, Dr Victor & the Rasta Rebels and Walk This Way. He was one of the lead vocalists for The Rockets for three years and has worked on several successful musical theatre productions.\n\nThe title track of his first solo album, Venus, still receives regular airplay more than 20 years since its release and is regarded as his signature tune. Today Izobell is a sought-after producer, songwriter, comedic MC and musician with eight albums to his credit. His latest CD offering, Just Me - Net So, was released to popular acclaim.\n\nAMANDA BLACK (SOUTH AFRICA)\n\nRaised in Port Elizabeth in the Eastern Cape, Amanda Benedicta Antony goes by the stage name Amanda Black. The singer/songwriter sings in a mix of English and Xhosa, describing her music as Afro-soul with a fusion of hip-hop, a bit of soul and R& B. She often adorns her face with white stipples of Xhosa face paint as an expression of her roots.\n\nBlack took part in three editions of South African Idols before moving to Joburg at the beginning of 2016 to pursue her music career. The singer/songwriter achieved recognition in 2016 following the release of her hit single Amazulu, off her debut studio album, also named Amazulu. The song gained nationwide rotational radio airplay and earned her nominations in five categories at the Metro FM Music Awards, where she went on to win Best R&B Single and Listener’s Choice Award.\n\nShe also bagged Album of the Year, Best Newcomer of the Year, Best Female Artist of the Year and Best R&B Soul Reggae Album and was nominated in the Record of the Year category at the 2017 South African Music Awards.\n\nBLINKY BILL & SIBOT'S AFROFUNK SPACESHIP (KENYA/ SOUTH AFRICA)\n\nBlinky Bill (Bill Sellanga) is a Kenyan musician/producer/DJ and founding member of forward thinking art/music collective ‘Just a Band’, with whom he has released three albums.\n\nHe is an alumnus of the US State Music Program One Beat Music (2013) and participated at the Red Bull Music Academy Tokyo in 2014. Blinky Bill released a debut solo EP We Cut Keys While You Wait in 2016 and is currently in studio working on full length album Everyone’s Just Winging It and Other Fly Tales - supposedly a mix of Afrofunk, hip hop, jazz and electronic.\n\nFor the 2018 CTIJF Blinky Bill will collaborate with producer/composer/DJ Sibot (Simon Ringrose). The Cape Town-based artist has played a pivotal role in the emergence of electronica as a real force on the national and international music scene.\n\nSibot’s influence goes back to early 2000s when he collaborated with the likes of Waddy Jones (Ninja from Die Antwoord) Spoek Mathambo and Markus Wormstorm. These releases off iconic label African Dope, helped carve out a new sound in South African underground electronic music, which paved the way for much of what exists today.\n\nCLAIRE PHILLIPS (SOUTH AFRICA)\n\nVocalist, songwriter, producer, Claire Phillips hails from Belhar, Cape Town. She began singing as a toddler and taught herself to play guitar, piano, saxophone, drums and bass guitar. Nowadays Phillips leans more towards the guitar as instrument of choice, but it is her unique voice that makes her stand out. Phillips’ first foray on to the professional stage was as a cover artist, but she quickly built up a repertoire of original, self-penned work.\n\nShe became the first female South African artist to win a South African Music Award (SAMA) for a debut album when Say My Name won the Best R&B/Soul album category in 2007. Her second album was released in 2012, named By Request because of the number of people who kept on asking for her next CD.\n\nPhillips played at the CTIJF for the first time in 2014, where she met one of her idols Jill Scott, and she has opened the stage locally for international stars such as Joe McBride, Diane Reeves and reggae icon Eddy Grant. Currently working on her third studio album, Phillips has started playing tracks off her next offering such as Holding On which features Capetonian hip hop artist Youngsta.\n\nCORINNE BAILEY RAE (UNITED KINGDOM)\n\nFrom Leeds, England, singer/songwriter Corinne Bailey Rae released her self-titled debut album in 2006, which debuted at number 1 in the UK (the fourth female British act in history to do so) and number 4 in the USA. The album features global hits Put Your Records On and Like a Star.\n\nHer debut album and her second one - The Sea (2010) - have together, sold more than five million copies worldwide.\n\nShe embarked on her first international tour in 2006 with John Legend and played a set at the 5th 46664 concert in Joburg in 2007, but has not performed in South Africa since. In 2008, she won a Grammy Award for Album of the Year, for her work as a featured artist on Herbie Hancock’s River: The Joni Letters and in 2012 she won a Best R&B Performance Grammy Award for her take on the Bob Marley classic, Is This Love.\n\nIn May 2016, she released her third studio album, The Heart Speaks in Whispers. Her literature studies (instead of music) at university, shine through in her songwriting, which tends towards narratives examining the trajectory of emotion, perfectly suiting her laid back style of languid enunciation over jazz-informed ballads.\n\nespYOUNGLEGEND 2018 winner - JARRAD RICKETTS (SOUTH AFRICA)\n\nMulti-disciplinarian Jarrad Rickets, has tried everything from performing in art installations to acting, but singing seems to be netting him the most success.\n\nBorn and raised in Cape Town, Rickets has carved out a career as an on-board entertainer, performing regularly on the Baltic Sea on the Tallink Silja Cruise Ship. In 2012, he led a six-month solo show while based on Menorca Island, Spain, performing at theatres and hotels.\n\nLocally, he has leveraged a corporate events career, playing a mix of covers and original material, that has garnered him a popular following across the country. He was one of the cast members of David Kramer’s Orpheus in Africa, which was first performed at the Fugard Theatre and created and performed in music show Cape Town Crooners at the 2017 Suidoostefees.\n\nRickets was crowned the winner of the third annual espYoungLegends 2018 competition. This is what garnered him a billing at the 19th annual CTIJF.

At 18 he self-released his debut EP Franklin’s Room in 2013 via Bandcamp. The 2014 EP Groove Curse received strong support from North America and Europe and Rakei made the pilgrimage to London where the self-confessed introvert, forced himself to throw himself into the music scene.\n\nHis debut album Cloak (2016) propelled him to tour across Europe, the UK, Asia and Australia.

As a teenager, he played bass for the Grammy All-American High School Jazz Band & Choir, then studied at the Colburn School of Music in Los Angeles, receiving his undergraduate degree in music at UCLA.\n\nSince then, the Californian has expanded his repertoire to master the bass and a vast array of instruments, blending jazz with rock, funk and R&B. He successfully combines bow work, pedal effects and an, ‘in-your-face’ dexterity that has created his unique signature sound - .a blend of jazz, soul, funk and rock.\n\nA founding member of the acclaimed collective, The West Coast Get Down, Mosley has released albums containing his own solo work plus recorded and toured with artists such as Lauryn Hill, Jonathan Davis (Korn), Kendrick Lamar, India Arie, Chris Cornell and Common.

His first two albums - Afro-Latin Soul, Volumes 1 & 2 were virtually indistinguishable from other Latin-jazz records released in 1966, but some tracks foreshadow his later work.\n\nIn the early 70s he brought this new sound, which he called Ethio-jazz, to his homeland while still working in the US. He recorded in New York and Ethiopia, with Yekatit Ethio Jazz, being the album that strongly demonstrated his skill at creating a hybrid sound drawing on traditional Ethiopian music and American jazz, funk and soul.\n\nThe Ethiopian civil war of the 70s, forced many Ethio-jazz luminaries to flee their country and by the 80s his music was largely forgotten outside of his home-country. Fortunately, early 90s record collectors re-discovered his work with the first Ethiopiques CD reissue to feature a single artist being Astatke. Ever since, Astatke has not only been sampled extensively by hip hop artists, but he has worked on bigger and bigger collaborations and performances around the world.\n\nNDUDUZO MAKHATHINI: INNER DIMENSIONS COLLECTIVE (SOUTH AFRICA / SWISS)\n\nBorn into a musical family to a pianist mother and guitar-playing father, Nduduzo Makhathini took to music naturally. He got his first taste for performing thanks to one of his father’s isicathamiya groups, while his mother made sure he was steeped in the life of choirs and church music.\n\nMakhathini became the Standard Bank Young Artist for Jazz 2015 just days before he launched his first two albums, Sketches of Tomorrow and Mother Tongue, conceived at different times but released together. His third album, Listening to the Ground was nominated for best jazz album at the South African Music Awards in 2016. Album number 5, Inner Dimensions, won best jazz album at the 2017 SAMA’s as well as best traditional jazz album at the Mzantsi Jazz Awards 2017.\n\nMakhathini is adamant that his is improvised music, rather than just plain jazz.

Ikhambi means herbal concoction.\n\nNICHOLAS PAYTON: AFRO-CARIBBEAN MIXTAPE (UNITED STATES OF AMERICA)\n\nNew Orleans-born trumpeter, keyboardist, singer and composer Nicholas Payton, is a dynamic performer, steeped in acoustic jazz and post-bop, whose music often finds him exploring genres beyond the confines of the jazz tradition.\n\nPayton burst onto the New Orleans jazz scene a quarter of a century ago, whilst still a teenager. He started studying at the University of New Orleans with pianist Ellis Marsalis but left to take up a travelling gig with drummer Elvin Jones. He began his solo recording career with Verve Records, who released From This Moment in 1994 and Gumbou Nouveau the next year. A year later, he appeared alongside his jazz contemporaries in director Robert Altman’s film Kansas City.\n\nOver the years, Payton has delved into straight-ahead jazz, post-bop, funk and R&B-influenced sounds and on his 2011 album, Bitches, he not only composed and arranged the entire work, but played every instrument and provided all vocals. Most recently in 2016, Payton returned to a full band-oriented approach with the hip-hop and spoken word-inflected The Egyptian Second Line. And this year he delivered another highly inventive hip-hop and world music-influenced production, Afro-Caribbean Mixtape.\n\nR&R=NOW: ROBERT GLASPER, TERRACE MARTIN, CHRISTIAN SCOFF, DERRICK HODGE, TAYLOR McFERRIN, JUSTIN TYSON (UNITED STATES OF AMERICA)\n\nRobert Glasper is a multi-award winning (three Grammys and currently nominated for an Emmy), hip-hop inspired pianist and record producer from Texas with a knack for mellow yet harmonically complex compositions.

He cites samba schools and Stevie Wonder as major musical influences and is credited by many, as a ‘renewer’ of Brazilian pop samba.\n\nJorge learned to act at Rio’s state university theatre company and saved up to buy his first acoustic guitar in the early 90s. Subsequently, he became a well-known personality on the Brazilian music scene - as the front man of the group Farofa Carioca and eventually released a solo debut, Samba Esporto Fino, in 2001, which was renamed Carolina in the United States. This album found Jorge creating a distinct musical blend by marrying Brazilian samba to other genres.\n\nJorge gained exposure through his work as an actor, appearing in City of God (2002) and in Wes Anderson’s The Life Aquatic with Steve Zisso (2004), in which he played a deckhand who played guitar and sang. He provided much of the film’s soundtrack in the form of Portuguese language cover versions of David Bowie classics.

He started playing the trumpet with no formal training and picked up theory and practical lesson from various artists around his home stomping ground.\n\nIn 1992, he completed a Performer’s Diploma in Jazz Studies at the then University of Natal, under Darius Brubeck and his career started taking off. Over the years, Faku - an accomplished composer, trumpeter and flugelhorn player - has released several solo albums and collaborated with a multitude of local and international artists. He has worked with SA legends such as Thandie Claasen, Basil Coetzee, Bheki Mseleku and Abdullah Ibrahim.\n\nBased in SA Faku regularly travels overseas and has toured the US extensively with SA group Uhadi and with Kesivan Naidoo & the lights.

In 2016, he released le Ngoma, recorded in Switzerland with his Swiss quintet - the Feya Faku Quintet.\n\nTHE LOUIZ BANKS QUARTET (INDIA)\n\nWhile he came from a musical family and studied piano at a college in Darjeeling Louiz Bank, really hit his stride when he discovered jazz in Calcutta in the late 1960s. There he started performing at the Hindustan Hotel, which led to an invite to play at the Blue Fox Restaurant, a popular nightclub famous for its patronage of Western Music. Here he began composing advertising jingles and stage musicals, something he continues to do to this day.\n\nIt is also where he met RD Burman, who invited him to join his troupe in Mumbai where he helped to popularise live jazz in nightclubs. In 1979, he formed the Indo-Jazz Ensemble with Goan saxoponist Braz Gonsalves, composing music on Indian classical scales and jazz rhythms and incorporating instruments such as the ghatam and thavil.

They tend to employ a rhythmic vocal bass line with constant beat boxing, while the remaining voices contribute a choral and polyphonic accompaniment and each one takes a turn in solo vocal performances.\n\nThe Soil released their self-titled debut album in 2012, followed by a deluxe edition the next year. In 2013 they released a live DVD/CD called, Reflections: Live in !Joburg and in 2014, they released their second album, Nostalgic Moments, which was nominated for Best R&B Soul Reggae Album at the South African Music Awards 2015. They also recorded a track (Hamba Uyosebenza) with Ladysmith Black Mambazo in 2014, which was nominated for Best Collaboration at SAMA 2015.\n\nThey released their third studio album, Echoes of Kofifi, in 2016. The Soil has played Womad Festival in Chile and The Sacred Festival in India in 2016 and toured Australia and New Zealand in 2017\n\nTROMBONE SHORTY (UNITED STATES OF AMERICA)\n\nBorn into a musical family steeped in jazz, Trombone Shorty, born Troy Andrews, was encouraged to pick up the trombone because there were already several trumpeters in the family. The multi-instrumentalist however, plays trombone and trumpet, as well as drums, organ and the tuba and has toured with his own band, Trombone Shorty and Orleans Avenue since 2009.\n\nThe 31-year-old started participating in brass band parades as a child, played shows abroad with the Neville Brothers as a teenager, and fresh out of high school, joined Lenny Kravitz’s band.

The only jazz album in Rolling Stone Magazine's \"Best 50 Albums of the Year\", Far From Over has been called \"rambunctious, furiously funny\" (L.A. Times); \"a five-star masterpiece\" (Helsingen Sanomat); and \"spine-tingling jazz for heart, head and feet\" (The Guardian). The sextet, consisting of Iyer's long-time, powerful rhythm section of Stephan Crump (bass) and Marcus Gilmore (drums), fronted by three stellar horn players (Graham Haynes, Steve Lehman and Mark Shim) is \"a dream team of cutting-edge improvisors\" (Rolling Stone). This is the band that will be playing in Capetown. This is indeed \"A band for the ages\" (San Diego Union Tribune).\n\nDARREN ENGLISH (SA/USA)\n\nTrumpeter Darren English was born in Cape Town in 1990. He started exploring music at Muizenberg High School and went on to study at UCT, where his closest playing partner was probably drummer Claude Cozens. With Cozens, he spent time studying in Norway, and appeared at the Norwegian Folk Festival in 2009. English credits much of his professional progress to his willingness to test and hone his skills at jam sessions in and around Cape Town. From that came many musical partnerships and invitations to gig, including a two-year touring stint with Jimmy Dludlu and work with Mark Fransman, Feya Faku and the late Robbie Jansen and Zim Ngqawana, among others.\n\nEnglish appeared at the Grahamstown Jazz Festival and at an early incarnation of the Cape Town International Jazz Festival, where he also featured last year as part of Nduduzo Makhathini’s Listening to the Ground project. English was a two-time winner of the Fine Music Radio Award, and in 2012 scooped the SAMRO Overseas Scholarship, which supplemented his scholarship at Georgia State University. He graduated with a Masters in Jazz Studies and is now based in Atlanta. In 2014 he featured with Grammy nominee Russell Gunn’s Krunk Orchestra at the Atlanta Jazz Festival – one of his many collaborations subsequently across jazz (where his regular saxophone partner is New York Jazz Award winner Gregory Tardy), hip hop and contemporary pop music. Jazz Times has said the work on his debut album, Imagine Nation (with pianist Kenny Banks Jr, bassist Billy Thornton, drummer Chris Burroughs and guests), represents “a force and a voice to be heard and understood”. English is the youngest artist ever to be signed to top Atlanta label Hot Shoe Records. He told Kaya-FM’s Brenda Sisane, “Music can’t be pretentious – especially jazz. Be as honest as you can be, for the song’s sake.”\n\nDOPE SAINT JUDE (SA)\n\nRap artist and activist Dope Saint Jude (Catherine Saint Jude Pretorious) began rapping as a teenager on the Cape Flats, rapidly developing to write her own songs and later designing innovative live presentations. Coming from a Catholic home, with a father who listened to classical music, her sounds draw from a wide palette. She first made waves with the 2014 Hit Politik, followed by The Golden Ratio, and in 2015 released Keep in Touch featuring Angel-Ho.\n\nShe recently dropped her first EP, Reimagine of which reviewer Sabelo Mkhabela said: “a tapestry of emotions – it’s the story of someone living – going through things, spending time with loved ones, getting pissed off by some things and celebrating wins.” Dope Saint Jude is an articulate advocate for feminism, and has lectured on hip hop’s role as a vehicle for social commentary. Music scholar Adam Haupt has credited her with “transforming South African hip hop by queering a genre that has predominantly been male and heteronormative.” She has also facilitated an arts education community project, iNtombi Workshop, in Elsie’s River. Dope Saint Jude was chosen by MIA to be part of international retailer H&M’s awareness-raising campaign video for World Recycle Week in April 2016. In her own words to website OkayAFRICA: “I’m a Cape Flats girl, but now I’m going to America and France. And I think about where my mother and grandmother came from – cleaning houses – it’s my right to flex. It’s a political act.”\n\nEN VOGUE (USA)\n\nIt’s back to the future with all-female RnB group En Vogue, who have sold more than 20 million records to date, starting with their 1990 debut album Born to Sing, which produced the smash hit Hold On, right through to today’s powerhouse vocal outing Déjà Vu, their first single outing in five years. En Vogue have won seven MTV Music Awards, three Soul Train Awards, and two American Music Awards, as well as receiving seven Grammy nominations. In March 2015, Billboard named them the ninth most successful female group of all time. The roots of the music of these ‘real funky divas’ lie in Oakland, California where, in the late 1980s, producers assembled a quartet that they hoped could re-ignite the style, vocal talent and sass of mid-Twentieth Century female vocal groups.\n\nThe singers they selected more than fulfilled that promise. En Vogue are credited with originating the innovative blend of soul and hip hop that was dubbed ‘New Jill Swing” in the 1990s. The stresses of an extremely hardworking touring career have led to several personnel switches over the years, and the departure of two original members. Currently, En Vogue is a trio comprising of original members Cindy Herron-Braggs and Terry Ellis, and featuring Rhona Bennett. The UK Guardian’s Caroline Sullivan described a 2015 London performance as demonstrating how they remain “the girls next door…who make a point of having fun… [but still] make you marvel at their technique.” As for En Vogue themselves, they still love the musical life: “We absolutely love singing. We’re not done just yet. We’re absolutely not ready to put the mics down!” Herron-Braggs told UK publication The Voice online.\n\nESCALANDRUM (ARGENTINA)\n\nEscalandrum is an Argentine sextet led by drummer Daniel ‘Pipi’ Piazzola, grandson of the man who pioneered a revolution in tango music for new urban audiences back in the 1940s. That grandfather, Astor Piazzola, a classically-trained bandoneon player, introduced modern techniques such as chromatic harmony and paved the way for ‘tango nuevo’ (the new tango) to spread beyond its homeland and enchant world music audiences everywhere. Astor’s son Daniel was also a musician, and so grandson Pipi grew up in a house full of jazz and tango, spending many evenings backstage as his father and grandfather performed. Escalandrum was initially formed in 1999 by Pipi and a group of friends who simply loved to jam together, taking its name from a mash-up of the name of a local sand-shark (the Piazzola family love to fish) and the word ‘drum’.\n\nThe group has nine albums to its credit so far – most recently Piazzola Project with guest vocalist Elena Roger. They have toured more than 20 countries and won multiple awards in their homeland, as well as securing a Latin Grammy nomination for their 2011 album Piazzola plays Piazzola. Escalandrum’s music is not simply a revival of tango tradition; it draws inspiration from global as well as local beats, and from folklore as well as city music. Piazzola’s fascination is with claves: the rhythmic patterns used to organise Afro-Cuban, and this plus jazz led the New York Latin Jazz website to declare that he was taking “his grandfather’s tango nuevo in an entirely new direction”. But Piazzola remains conscious of his roots and the tango aesthetic; “It’s in my blood. It’s in the air – and what’s in the air sticks to you.”\n\nERNIE SMITH (SA)\n\nA multiple SAMA, KORA and Metro music award winner, guitarist Ernie Smith, was born in Durban and began playing in his early teens. At that time, his listening was wide, taking in both the experimental approaches of Pat Metheny and the easy listening sounds of George Benson, as well as many others. Closer to home, legendary Durban veteran Sandile Shange and Jonathan Butler were both heroes. From this mix, Smith took the lesson that he had to craft his own voice; a voice that could blend jazz, African and popular influences into a unique personal sound.\n\nHe released his first album, Child of the Light in 2001, followed the next year by Lovely Things, My African Heart (where Butler guested) and then Everything Around Me. His most recent album, Time for Love, reached out to an international audience through his signing to SAIG Entertainment in New Orleans. Ernest Kelly, owner of SAIG and a well-known name on the American jazz scene, said of Ernie that he “brings a unique sound to an American market looking for something new and inspiring. His sophisticated, African-infused contemporary style has already been warmly welcomed.” Smith is also much in demand as a producer, not only of his own material, also but for countless other artists, with his Child of the Light studio in Johannesburg already becoming a hub for a diverse range of SA talent. Billboard’s Diane Coetzer said of Smith’s debut: “[he] is the perfect 21st century artist…offering up a musical melting pot that’s destined to find fans across a wide spectrum of music tastes.” For Smith, the secret of his success is to “work on your craft every day and learn as much as you can about what it’s going to take to get you to where you want to go.”\n\nGRETCHEN PARLATO (USA)\n\nAmerican Jazz singer Gretchen Parlato was born into a musical family in Los Angeles (her father, David Parlato, is a well-known bassist) and earned a degree in Ethnomusicology and Jazz Studies at UCLA. She became the first vocalist to be accepted to the Thelonious Monk Institute of Jazz Performance in 2001. In 2004, she won the Thelonious Monk Institute International Jazz Vocals Competition.\n\nShe has released four albums under her own name: Gretchen Parlato, In A Dream, The Lost and Found (co-produced with Robert Glasper) and Live in NYC. With an extensive international touring schedule, Parlato is an in-demand teacher and performer, her voice appearing on over 70 albums, recording and performing with the likes of Wayne Shorter, Herbie Hancock, Kenny Burrell, Esperanza Spalding, Terence Blanchard, Terri Lyne Carrington, Marcus Miller, and Lionel Loueke. Maintaining top status and worldwide critical acclaim, Parlato has been praised and admired for displaying a musical individuality loaded with paradoxical powers. Her sultry, intriguing voice and unique, rhythmically agile phrasing comes with inescapable centripetal force; the more intimate and understated she sings, the more she draws listeners in. Parlato once told Jazz Times: “We all have our own unique and honest vocal sound. Underneath anything affected or forced is a very pure, simple, completely emotionally connected tone. It seems at a certain point, we should stop trying to sound like anyone else and just sing from our heart, from our soul, sing as we would speak.”\n\nJONAS MOSA GWANGWA & FRIENDS (SA)\n\nThe 40-year career of veteran composer, trombonist, bandleader and director Jonas Mosa Gwangwa, born in Johannesburg’s Orlando East township in 1937, epitomises the marriage of art and activism. The two-time Oscar-nominee began playing while still at high school (St Peter’s College), in the Huddleston Jazz Band. He paid his dues in several well-regarded bands– but was also woodshedding in the modern jazz sessions at the Odin Cinema, eventually becoming a core member of the ground-breaking Jazz Epistles. In 1961, he left South Africa as a cast member of the musical King Kong, eventually securing a scholarship to study at the prestigious Manhattan School of Music in New York. During 15 years in the USA, Gwangwa composed and arranged music for, among many others, Miriam Makeba and, with the patronage and collaboration of singer Harry Belafonte, worked tirelessly to make America aware of the evils of apartheid. From the military camps of Umkhonto we Sizwe across Africa, Gwangwa recruited, trained and directed talented young performers for the Amandla Cultural Ensemble, which toured the world raising awareness and thrilling audiences.\n\nHis work on the score of the film Cry Freedom won both the Ivor Novello and Black Emmy Awards, and was also nominated for Oscar, Grammy, and Ivor Novello, Anthony Asquith and BAFTA awards. He composed music for the massive London Mandela 70th Birthday concert, for South Africa’s Olympic bid, for the launch of the National Coat of Arms and for many documentaries celebrating great South African lives and struggles. Gwangwa holds honorary Doctorates from UNISA and Walter Sisulu University, received a meritorious award from then-president Nelson Mandela and the Order of Ikhamanga in Gold. He has released seven albums as leader since his return from exile. The late producer Koloi Lebona described him as having “seen life’s sunshine and shadows and learned about himself along the way. The tales he tells through his music come from the heart.” But for him, as he told TimesLive “I never had the notion of being a big star or having big money. I was just into the music.”e Thelonious Monk Institute of Jazz Performance in 2001. In 2004, she won the Thelonious Monk Institute International Jazz Vocals Competition.\n\nJAZZ FUNK SOUL WITH EVERETTE HARP, JEFF LORBER & PAUL JACKSON JR. (USA)\n\nThis contemporary jazz supergroup was the brainchild of the Shanachie label, which realised fans would instantly warm to a line-up uniting three of the world’s most admired fusion players: reedman Everette Harp, keyboardist Jeff Lorber and guitarist Paul Jackson Jr. Their self-titled 2014 album debut won instant worldwide acclaim, and a Grammy nomination. That wasn’t the first such nomination for Lorber who started playing piano at the age of four, and who has been touring with various formations – most notably The Jeff Lorber Fusion – since 1977. Lorber, who also composes and produces, has been hailed as one of the founding fathers of contemporary jazz and, among others, launched the career of Kenny G. He continues to work both in collaborations such as Jazz Funk Soul, and on his own projects, most recently the 2015 album Step It Up with Jimmy Haslip. In contrast to Lorber’s cool, laid-back style, Everette Harp brings an assertive, warm, churchy saxophone sound to the stage. Houston-born Harp is a Downbeat Award winner who, like Lorber, leads personal projects and adds lustre to the support bands of many other artists including singers Aretha Franklin and Anita Baker. Reviewing the group’s second album, the 2016 More Serious Business, Allaboutjazz commented that it offered “playing, production and professionalism. Perfect for easy listening after a hard day at work.” Harp can explain why the chemistry of Jazz Funk Soul’s music works so well: “We are very different personalities but we all respect where each other comes from.”\n\nJUDITH SEPHUMA (SA)\n\nAfro funk, jazz and gospel singer Judith Sephuma knew from her early childhood in Polokwane that she wanted to sing. Her voice made her a finalist in the Shell Road to Fame and the SABC Jam Alley Talent Search, and she won the 1999 Old Mutual Jazz into the Future award. Sephuma studied at the FUBA music school and UCT, graduating with honours in jazz performance in 1999. While at university, she worked with many Mother City outfits including Loading Zone, the C-Base Collective and the UCT Big Band.\n\nShe has also toured extensively, both across Africa and worldwide – beginning with the Nantes Fin de Siecle Festival while she was still at college – and also sang at the inauguration of South Africa’s second State President, Thabo Mbeki. Her first album, the 2001 A Cry, A Smile, A Dance was critically acclaimed, and six more have followed, most recently the 2015 Pan-African-influenced One Word and the 2016 The Experience – Live. Critics have admired the warmth of her voice, which News24 described as “one of our national treasures.” Sephuma has also worked as a music mentor, being choirmaster for the Limpopo choir during the 2012 Mzansi Magic Clash of the Choirs contest, and showed other sides of her talent as a contestant on Strictly Come Dancing and in the Zaziwa TV music talk show. Sephuma told The Sowetan’s Lesley Mofokeng: “You have to be that curious singer and see what your voice can do. You have to love your craft enough to want to learn more about it and not be caged.”\n\nLAURA MVULA (UK)\n\nInnovative British singer songwriter and two time Mercury Prize nominee and two time MOBO award winner, Laura Mvula grew up in Birmingham. Mvula first sang in church and later with all female acapella group Black Voices. By 2008 she had formed and was composing for her own jazz/neo-soul outfit Judyshouse. Mvula has also directed various choirs. She is a graduate of the Birmingham Conservatoire and holds a degree in composition.\n\nHer debut album, Sing to the Moon was released in 2013 and garnered multiple award nominations and critical acclaim. Discussing her follow-up, 2016 album The Dreaming Room, the UK Guardian described how Mvula “pulls the listener along with her through the most serpentine songs: however, winding their routes, the melodies are almost always beautiful; however much the musical scenery shifts, it is always striking.” ​\n\nMvula’s songs explore identity, personal dilemmas and social issues. About her hit, Phenomenal Woman, inspired by Maya Angelou (and with a video shot in the Bo-Kaap: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7---iGdDIBQ ), she told the UK Independent: “I try and depend a lot on the women that I surround myself with, the women that through their own vulnerability and ridiculous strength are still moving mountains and doing extraordinary things every day.” www.lauramvula.com/\n\nMANU DIBANGO AND MOREIRA CHONGUICA (CAMEROON/ MOZAMBIQUE)\n\nCameroon and Mozambique meet when two unique African reedmen come together on the CTIJF stage. Veteran Paris-based, Douala-born Manu Dibango, the Grammy-nominated ‘Lion of Africa’, plays saxophone and vibraphone, composes and has led multiple world-acclaimed big bands since 1968. Destined to study medicine in Paris, he instead gravitated towards the music scene, jamming with European and American players and Congolese soukous players. His 1972 hit single Soul Makossa was not only one of the first crossover Afro jazz hits, but also the first to make it on to the New York disco scene, as well as spawning a host of homages and imitations. More than 50 albums have followed, most recently the 2013 Ballade en Saxo. A UNESCO Artist for Peace, Dibango has headed the Cameroun Music Corporation and was named the Special Representative of Francophonie at the 2016 Rio Olympics. Allmusic.com calls him “one of the great innovators of world music” and although he celebrated his 80th birthday with a giant concert in Paris in 2014, he’s still creating fresh concepts. He is, after all, the very first musician to have asserted: “There is an Electric Africa!”\n\nDibango loves to work with younger players, and in Moreira Chonguiça he may have found a match made in heaven. Matola-born, South African-resident Moreira is not only a SAMA-winning reedman but also a composer, producer, music educator and ethnomusicologist who graduated from UCT in 2000. Jazz runs in his veins – not only was it the music his family played, but he’s related to the late Lucky Michaels, who pioneered jazz clubs in Soweto, founding The Pelican in the 1970s. He himself started music early, gave it up for football, and then picked up an instrument again in his mid-teens, certain he’d found his direction. Moreira has two albums as leader to his credit (The Moreira Project Vol I The Journey and Vol II World Citizen) and his eponymous band has featured at all South Africa’s major festivals. Website Allaboutjazz gave his debut 4.5 stars out of 5 and commented that when “groove is melded with a variety of cultural influences, competent musicianship on every instrument and a sense of adventure, you've got something special—like The Journey, an hour and 18 minutes of musical diversity.” When he spoke to photographer Antonia Heil, Moreira underlined his adventurous musical identity: “I play many styles from places such as, Mozambique, Nigeria, Zimbabwe and Congo. It’s a mixture of different genres with a bit of hip hop, funk, and contemporary. Being an artist is a profession of danger - the connection with my ancestors is what inspires me.”\n\nRUDRESH MAHANTHAPPA BIRD CALLS (USA)\n\nReedman Rudresh Mahanthappa has rarely been absent from the jazz polls since 2003; among others, he was the 2011 Downbeat Critics Alto Saxophonist of the Year as well as the Jazz Journalists’ Association Alto Saxophonist of the Year in three successive years (2009 -2011). He has also been the recipient of multiple Rockefeller grants and a Guggenheim research fellowship. Music writer Victor L. Schermer has described him as: “one of a special class of players who have led jazz into the New Millennium, rooted firmly in tradition, while finding new directions and possibilities in a new era...” But it was his 2015 album in homage to Charlie Parker, Bird Calls, that scored the trifecta at the Downbeat Critics poll: Album of the Year, Alto Saxophonist of the Year and Rising Composer of the Year.\n\nBird Calls features trumpeter Adam O’Farrill, bassist Francois Moutin, pianist Matt Mitchell and drummer Rudy Royston. Indian-American Mahanthappa is a graduate of Berklee and Chicago’s DePaul University who moved to New York in 1998 and began collaborations with pianist Vijay Iyer. Since then, he has released 14 albums as leader and close to 20 as a sideman, in the company of musicians as diverse as pianist Danilo Perez, drummer Jack de Johnette and Indian Carnatic saxophonist Kadri Gopalnath. While challenging and redefining the terms of the music he plays are important to Mahanthappa, so is reaching out to listeners. He told Allaboutjazz: “My favorite moments when I'm playing music are when I feel that the audience and the band are one. I'm not playing for you; you're not listening to me. We're in this together. When that clicks, that's the most spiritual moment of playing music for me.”\n\nSIYA MAKUZENI (SA)\n\nTrombonist, vocalist, composer and bandleader Siya Makuzeni is the 2016 Standard Bank Young Artist of the Year for Jazz and won the Mbokodo Award for Women in Jazz in 2013. She has featured at major South African festivals and has also performed in Italy, India, and Kenya, as well as performing and composing for TV drama The Road. Born into a musical family (her mother was a choral organiser, her father a dedicated jazz record collector) she worked her way up through the various national youth jazz ensembles, recording with the National Youth Jazz Band in 2001.\n\nBut her musical education stretched far broader, including two years paying her dues with the East Cape Jazz Band while she was still at school. There, she met many players with whom she was later to collaborate, including trumpeter Marcus Wyatt and pianist Andile Yenana. Since then, her career has flowered, including long-time musical partnerships with Carlo Mombelli and Wyatt, leading her own crossover outfit IppyFuze and, currently, leading a jazz sextet – which often features the 2017 jazz young artist, bassist Benjamin Jephta – that presents her original compositions. Other sextet members include pianist Thandi Ntuli, reedman Sisonke Xonti, trumpeter Sakhile Simani and drummer Ayanda Sikade. City Press critic Lloyd Gedye said of her singing: “Siya Makuzeni has one of those voices. When you hear it, everything stops. All of a sudden, there is magic in the world again.” But for Makuzeni, it’s the trombone that remains her “best friend”, even in formats where she chooses to employ voice and electronic loops: “it’s a beautiful instrument…that has taken me on a lot of explorations.” Makuzeni told the Financial Mail she’s “interested in malleable sounds…an atmosphere or headspace that can take the audience into how I perceive jazz.”\n\nSEKUNJALO EDUJAZZ BAND (SA)\n\nOver the past fifteen years, the Sekunjalo Development Foundation has hosted an annual Sekunjalo Edujazz Concert where young music students share a stage with established jazz artists from Cape Town. Current programme co-cordinator Donovan Witten shared his original vision with Dr Iqbal Survé, and together they established the Sekunjalo Edujazz Project in 2001 to promote development of jazz music in township schools on the Cape Flats.\n\nThe annual serves as a platform for aspiring, young musicians from all Cape Town’s communities and featured bands over the years have included The Little Giants, the Belhar Music Collective, the Athlone Music Academy, the Alexander Sinton High Jazz Band, the Heathfield High Jazz Band, the Zerilda Park Primary Band, the Muizenberg High Jazz Band, Delft Jazz Band, the UWC Wind Orchestra and the Ifidyoli String Ensemble. Established musicians including the likes of Tucan Tucan, Virtual Jazz Reality, Jimmy Nevis, MiCasa, Beatenberg and The Darryl Andrews Jazz Band have shared the stages, and individuals such as Alvyn Dyers, Andre Petersen, Ivan Bell, Camillo Lombard, Amanda Tiffin, George Werner, Sammy Weber and Shannon Mowday have mentored. Workshops run by educators including Frank Paco, Ronel Nagfal, Henriette Weber and Terence Scarr have helped to hone skills. The work bore fruit in a roster of current stars and rising stars, including Kyle Shepherd, Darren English, Claude Cozens, Dylan Tabisher, Leanne Fortuin, Don Vino Prins, Lana Crowster, Jamie Faull and S’pha Mdlalose.\n\nFor 2017, the band will be under the direction of Andrew Ford, an international award-winner recognised by the Cannes Lions, the London International Advertising Awards, the New York Festivals and South Africa’s Loeries. Ford’s arranging skills are constantly in demand by large ensembles – including the Cape Town Symphony Orchestra.\n\nSKYJACK (SA/SWITZERLAND)\n\nSkyjack is an award-winning collaborative band of five jazz musicians from South Africa and Switzerland who work together whenever cross-continental trips are possible. Their interplay creates a wide palette of sound drawing from multiple cultural influences, concentrated into a modern jazz aesthetic. The three South Africans are well known to local audiences. Port Elizabeth-born bassist Shane Cooper was Standard Bank Young Artist for jazz in 2013 and won the 2014 SAMA for Best Jazz Album for his debut as leader, Oscillations. Pianist Kyle Shepherd was 2014 Standard Bank Young Artist for Jazz and winner of the Unisa National Piano Award in 2015.\n\nHis trio album (also including Cooper) Dream State, was nominated for both SAMA and a Metro Music Awards, and he has just released his original soundtrack album for South Africa’s 2017 Oscar entry, Noem my Skollie. New York-based drummer Kesivan Naidoo was Standard Bank Young Artist for Jazz in 2009, and is a SAMRO overseas scholarship winner. Naidoo has said of the music of the new South African generation: “The rest of the world is looking to my generation for that new sound… We have a responsibility to forge that new sound of freedom.” The three South Africans are highly respected artists who have toured widely and worked with the most in-demand jazz names at home and abroad. These include their current Swiss collaborators in this formation: tenor saxophonist Marc Stucki and trombonist Andreas Tschopp. Skyjack first worked together on a South African tour in 2013 where they played among others at the National Arts Festival in Grahamstown. In 2015 they reunited for a tour across Switzerland, where they entered and won the prestigious Swiss BeJazz TransNational competition.\n\nThey recorded their debut album at the legendary Powerplay Studios near Zurich. As winners of the competition, they returned to Switzerland in January 2016 to perform at the BeJazz Winterfestival in Berne. In September Skyjack launched the CD with a 12-gig, 12-day tour. Music writer Gwen Ansell described it as “a delight: by turns intense and thoughtful, and gently impressionistic, but always true to its heart\".\n\nSOWETO STRING QUARTET (SA)\n\nThe Soweto String Quartet was founded in 1989 by violinists Sandile Khemese and Thami Khemese and their brother, the late cellist Reuben Khemese. Childhood friend and viola player Makhosini Mnguni joined them. The SSQ’s existence at that time was an assertion of a rich township classical music tradition denied by apartheid; later, it helped to redefine the image of classical music for the new generation. The Khemese brothers – children of a conductor father and a choralist mother – had attended their uncle Michael Masote’s Madimba School of Music in the township.\n\nSandile and Reuben played with the Soweto Symphony Orchestra until Sandile left to study at the Royal Northern College of Music in Manchester, UK. In the years that followed the group’s foundation, they increasingly spiced their standard classical repertoire with fresh tunes and instrumentation reflecting their African heritage. They played at the inauguration of South Africa’s first post-liberation President, the late Rohilahla Nelson Mandela, and released their first album, Zebra Crossing, in 1998. Since then, they have toured worldwide, released eight further albums, and collaborated with artists as varied as Jimmy Dludlu, HHP, Manu Dibango and the Dance Theatre of Harlem. Jazz Times described their work on their debut as “bringing a freshness and zeal” to the medium of crossover classical playing. The SSQ told documentary-maker Kevin Harris “There is this misunderstanding that Soweto is rough. That is not true. Soweto is a very profound place…it enriches you musically.”\n\nTAYLOR MCFERRIN AND MARCUS GILMORE (USA)\n\nDJ, producer, singer-songwriter, keyboardist and beatboxer Taylor McFerrin cut his performing teeth early, appearing in his teens as a backing vocalist for his father, legendary improvising vocalist/composer/conductor Bobby McFerrin. Vocalese runs in the family. But Taylor’s interest has always been in music with a base in technology, through high school in Minnesota and college in New York in the late 1990s, and even before the role of DJ/producer was acknowledged as a valid musical career. He taught himself to play keyboards, and released an EP, Broken Vibes, in 2007.\n\nBroken Vibes received heavy rotation from DJs including Gilles Peterson, and McFerrin’s subsequent remix work included Corinne Bailey Rae and album tracks for Jose James. An Early Riser EP followed in 2010, with plans for a full album. But it was when he started exploring his material live with drummer Marcus Gilmore and bassist Jason Fraticelli – revisioning the planned Early Riser tracks as fresh blends of jazz and soul inspirations with edgy hip hop credentials – that the Early Riser album finally came together to be released in 2014. Gilmore featured regularly as part of pianist Vijay Iyer’s award-winning trio, and has been a Downbeat Rising Star. Jazz writer Ben Ratliff described his phrasing as possessing “a rolling swing and grace”.\n\nGilmore has worked with artists including Cassandra Wilson and Chick Corea and is the grandson of drum legend Roy Haynes. “Most people think of rhythm as secondary to melody or harmony,” Gilmore told NPR. “But I feel …they are all at the very least paramount in developing one’s musical ability…the most recent innovations in music have their foundation in rhythm.” PopMatters hailed Early Riser as “an album full of subtle surprises”, with guests including Thundercat and Robert Glasper. McFerrin has toured worldwide as a one-man show, playing major festivals such as Glastonbury and venues such as The Apollo, the Blue Note and the Lincoln Jazz Centre. The challenges of creating a fresh soundscape alone, working chemistry and magic with slices of his live takes, move him into new realms of originality. He told Spin Magazine: “The biggest positive to being self-taught is that from the beginning I developed my own sound. The negative is that there is a lot of theory, technique, and basic songwriting classes I wish I'd taken. I feel what makes it work for me is that I came up learning production techniques based around how to piece everything together. That's my main skill.”\n\nTHE RUDIMENTALS (SA)\n\nSouth African Top 20 stars The Rudimentals started out as one of the few South African bands exploring ska music, back in 2001. Since then, they’ve broadened their sound palette to include African, reggae, ragga, rock and dancehall music, regularly featuring emcees from Zimbabwe, Jamaica and New York and intermittently pulling impressive surprise guests out of the bag. At the core of their infectious, assertive sound are the horns of Simon Bates (saxophone), Ross McDonald (trombone) & Jody Engelbrecht (trumpet), with Nikolai Athiros on keys, guitarist Doc Mike Levy, drummer Giovanni Cerci, bassist Errol ‘Bong’ Strachan, and firecracker vocals from Teboho “Teboes”, Cotterell ‘Khaos’ Jop, Whoosain, and Lloyd “King Labash” Charles. The Rudimentals’ track Soundboy Killa has hit No 1 in the charts, staying in the Top 20 for 15 weeks. Among other tracks, Bubbling hit No 2 and their most recent single, We are One, spent five weeks in the Top 10. The title track has also been translated into IsiZulu and used as soundtrack music for the SABC-1 drama series Tempy Pushas.\n\nThe band has featured at major South African festivals, shared stages with acts including the late Lucky Dube, Johnny Clegg, HHP and Freshlyground, and featured in the documentary Punk in Africa. Impatient of any genre label these days, the band told interviewer Nick Darke: “It’s the music that matters.”\n\nTUNE RECREATION COMMITTEE – TRC (SA)\n\nTRC is one of several formations (also including the Amandla Freedom Ensemble) helmed by trumpeter Mandla Mlangeni. Co-founded and led with guitarist Keenan Ahrends, Tune Recreation Committee has long held a presence on the Cape Town music scene since its formation in 2007 by a group of college friends. For this outing it features Mlangeni and Ahrends, plus Nicholas Williams on bass and Claude Cozens on drums. SAMA-nominated (for the Amandla Freedom Ensemble’s 2015 Bhekisizwe) UCT graduate Mlangeni plays, composes and curates music events across a range of musical styles.\n\nHe was a recipient of the 2016 Berne (Switzerland) Artist in Residence, has toured internationally with the Cape Town Opera’s production of Porgy and Bess and worked with the same company’s 2016 production of Oratorio for A Forgotten Youth. The other members are equally in-demand and widely accomplished players who have toured extensively in South Africa and abroad, and received critical acclaim for the other outfits they lead. The TRC is an ever-changing and adaptable ensemble committed to building a musical bridge between the past, present and future. In its inaugural outing at the Cape Town Jazz Festival it will also feature a special guest appearance by critically acclaimed multi-instrumentalist Mark Fransman on accordion, tenor saxophone and bass clarinet. Fransman is a double SAMA award-winner, a former Standard Bank Young Artist for Jazz and winner of the FNB Vita Award, the Johnnie Walker Musician of the Year Award and the UCT Adcock Ingram Jazz Award.\n\nTRC takes original tunes and reinvents them, offering nods to their influences and embracing everything from the vibrant underground music scene of drum and bass to Balkanology. Fusing imported sounds and exporting their own flavours, either going into a Ghoema -tinged feel or just improvising around the melody, TRC is a playground for the interrogation and assimilation of an extended extemporisation from the canon of South African jazz. Says Mlangeni: “More than ever now there’s a need to understand ourselves and our history, and advance our stories and songs, in the face of a continuous onslaught of ‘culture from elsewhere is better; we’re not worthy enough’…But we need to do that with work that interrogates how we handle musical colours, harmonies, improvisation, not with performances that are predictable and formulaic.”\n\nVUDU (SA)\n\nVuDu is a nu-jazz collective from Port Elizabeth and winner of the 2016 esp Young Legends talent search. The band was formed to play straight-ahead jazz standards in the lobby of the Radison Blu Hotel in 2009. The founding members were bassist Alec Mackay, who recruited Virgil Matrass (keys), Sisanda “Sunda” Myataza (vocals) and Kristo Zondagh (drums). From those foundations, it has evolved into an outfit specialising in the fusion of traditional and African jazz with urban contemporary genres. Members soon started writing original material and recorded their first neo-soul single, Why. Their first EP, The Birth of a New Sound, followed, expanding their sound towards more experimental territory. Personnel changed, with new keyboardist Wesley Keet and bass player Grant Allison coming on board. In this fresh incarnation, VuDu released a second EP, Better Late than Never, in December 2013.\n\nAfter this, the band took a break to pursue individual music ambitions. Sunda travelled to Bristol, UK to tour for 6 months and record her debut solo EP. Wesley toured Taiwan twice. Kristo moved to Joburg where he became an in-demand session man, while Grant has worked in other collaborations while completing his Honours degree in music. But the members never lost contact and during this ostensible break, at Sunda’s suggestion, they entered the espYoungLegends contest. The rest, as they say, is history.\n\nANDRA DAY (USA)\n\nIn 2015, Andra Day debuted her album for Warner Bros, Cheers to the Fall, containing the song Rise Up. Since then, the singer has performed at the White House for Michelle Obama’s Better Make Room campaign, featured in an Apple TV spot with Stevie Wonder, and seen the song become one of the anthems for both the Black Lives Matter campaign and Mothers of the Movement (the coalition of those who have lost sons to police or gun violence).\n\nDay has also been nominated for a Grammy and performed again at the White House for a Smithsonian tribute. Cassandra Monique “Andra” Batie was born in Washington State and moved to the gang-riven east side of San Diego when she was three. She attended an arts-focused primary school and sang in her church gospel choir, also studying dance and musical theatre along the way. When she found the music of jazz singers such as Ella Fitzgerald and Billie Holiday in her teens, she wanted to bring that vibe and skill to her music too, but she never wanted to sing purely mainstream jazz. She honed her unique combination of original ideas and musical influences via videos filmed in her sister’s bedroom and posted on YouTube. When it first appeared, not every critic was won over by the eclecticism of Cheers To the Fall, but the UK Guardian’s Ben Beaumont-Thomas observed: “Day has found a vocal style of her own. In firing clean, piercing notes through the torrid waltz of City Burns, she perfectly evokes a tale of urban self-definition.” And then Rise Up was released. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwgr_IMeEgA )\n\nIt wasn’t something Day expected: “I wanted it to be something that was uplifting,” she told the Chicago Sun-Times. “My hope was that [the song] would encourage people… There’s a lot going on culturally and socially right now that I think needs to be talked about, and as an artist I’d be remiss not to bring up what’s going on in our society socially and politically… I just had no idea the bigger meaning the song would take on. But I’m grateful. I think it’s grown me as a person spiritually and emotionally, and continues to remind me that what you do in music can change people’s lives and affect them in a real way.” (https://www.andraday.com/ )\n\nBUDDY WELLS SEXTET (SA)\n\nSaxophonist, composer and arranger Buddy Wells was born into memories of South African urban jazz, from his father, musician and activist Trevor – which perhaps explains his popularity as sideman of choice throughout the history of the Cape Town International Jazz Festival. Royal College of Music graduate, Wells has won many personal awards including 1994 Adcock Ingram Competition for Best Jazz Instrumentalist, and the 1996 SAMRO Overseas Scholarship Competition and has made regular appearances at other prestigious festivals in South Africa, Asia and Europe, with musicians as diverse as Feya Faku, Marcus Wyatt, Manu Dibangu, the late Miriam Makeba and Abdullah Ibrahim, inclduing recordings too numerous to list, most recently Andreas Loven’s project District Six.\n\nJazz writer Gwen Ansell in Business Day called Wells “too self-effacing for his own good. He plays superbly in diverse and sometimes surprising contexts, and has won his share of awards, but has no album out as leader and rarely stars in interviews or media features… [But] his quietness may in fact be a key strength. The unpretentious openness he brings to projects allows him to contribute on whatever wavelength is required – yet his work is always inventive and intelligent, and always adds insight.” When 702’s Afrika Melane interviewed him in Grahamstown and dubbed him a “jazz master”, his typically self-effacing response was: “You can never master jazz, hey.”\n\nThis time, though, Wells will lead his own band. Club audiences who have encountered him in sensitive yet blistering sets in Cape Town (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZl3s1PSfKE ) and Johannesburg know he’s one artist that’s not to be missed. (https://www.facebook.com/buddywellsmusic/ )\n\nCAMILLO LOMBARD presents A CAPE TOWN SHOW CASE (SA)\n\nPianist, composer, arranger, producer and recording artist, Camillo Lombard was born into a musical family. He is a self-taught multi-instrumentalist who started playing piano at the age of four and professionally at nineteen. He received his Performance Diploma from the London College of Music in 2011, Jazz Piano Teachers Diploma in 2014 and Fellowship Degree in 2015. In 2005, Camillo established the Cape Town Showcase, to pay homage to great South African artists and composers.\n\nThis year Camillo Lombard’s Cape Town Showcase will profile consummate Cape Town legends that have made their mark in the music industry over the past four decades. The line-up will include the internationally acclaimed cabaret artist and entertainer Sophia Foster, whose unique voice is as well-known as her sophistication and glamorous gowns; the inimitable female impersonator and entertainer, Terry Fortune (real name Tyrone Robertson); jazz singer, actor, community champion and UCLA graduate, Sylvia Mdunyelwa; legendary bass guitarist Sammy Webber who has been performing for the past 40 years and whose lack of sight, has not kept him from thrilling audiences across the country; and the magical voice of songstress Vicky Sampson, whose song ‘Afrikan Dream’ continues to be a favourite.\n\nThe Cape Town Showcase also boasts a stellar 14-piece band that comprises of a six-piece rhythm section, five horns and three backing vocals.\n\nJAMESZOO (NETHERLANDS)\n\nDance/electronic music producer Jameszoo, aka Mitchel van Dinther, may label his music “naïve”, but he’s using the word in its visual art sense; talking about the open, genre rule innocent approach he takes to collaging and weaving together a range of music that all relate in some way to contemporary jazz on his highly-acclaimed debut album, Fool, which dropped in May 2016 on Brainfeeder. Van Dinther was born in Den Bosch in the southern Netherlands.\n\nHe began as a DJ working with an eclectic selection of avant-garde jazz, prog and kraut rock, electronic experiments, and beat oddities and gravitated towards the greater creative possibilities of production. Van Dinther’s main inspirations were ‘70s albums from Steve Kuhn, Arthur Verocai and Robert Wyatt (the 1974 Rock Bottom which featured South African trumpeter Mongezi Feza). Fool moves away from pure collage, featuring live performances not only from Kuhn (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7cREtQQ1wE ) and Verocai but also Brazilian singer Carlos Dafe, Thundercat and many more. At pitchfork.com, Benjamin Scheim described the album as “at its best, recalling the free spirit of late ‘90s electronic music…strongest when he tones down the overt jazz and instead parses the genre for specific sounds and ideas to embellish his electronic experimentations.” Jameszoo himself says: “I tried to create something that is both tradition and me fooling around. There is something to be said for both sides of the spectrum. If we always remain in tradition there will be no evolution.” (https://www.facebook.com/Jameszoomitchel/ )\n\nJAMESZOO (NETHERLANDS)\n\nJokko is a supergroup of African instrumentalists that brings together five top-ranking players of traditional instruments who are all also fluent in the modern languages of pop, dance and jazz. Renowned balafon (wooden xylophone) player Aly Keita (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NoZkNoblOsw ) comes from a distinguished lineage of traditional bards (griots), but has also worked with Joe Zawinul, Trilok Gurtu, Rokia Traore and more. His 2008 album Akwaba Inisene soared in the European World Music charts. Keita was born in Cote D’Ivoire, but his father took him back to the family village birthplace in Mali to induct him into traditional ways of playing.\n\nBack in Abidjan, he encountered a jazz pianist “who introduced me to the piano and I immediately saw several similarities.” Stringed instrument (guembri and ghayta) player Mehdi Nassouli (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqnUiCDFOns ) spent years studying the Moroccan Gnawa tradition under several masters, but has also played with international stars ranging from Fatoumata Diawara of Mali to English bluesman Justin Adams. Agadir-born Foulane Bouhssine has been hailed as “the Mozart of the ribab” (Berber lute: a single-string bowed instrument that sounds similar to a violin, and, says Bouhssine, “the spinal chord of Berber music”). One of his other projects is the Ribab Fusion movement (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a18NyA0U5as ) that has drawn new, young and international audiences to this ancient instrument. He cites influences ranging from deep tradition to Jimi Hendrix. Mozambican bassist Childo Thomas also plays mbira (thumb piano) and has been a regular touring companion of Cuban pianist Omar Sosa for 15 years (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XUTyds0nCZ8).\n\nFinally, Senegalese drummer Sega Seck (https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLnGex0tVUqnl35WmJXVFuTkEe0I5F4f3I ) is in demand internationally, and has worked in the vibrant, dance-oriented ensemble of Toure Kunda. Each of these players is a star in his own right; the combination is pure magic.\n\nKAMASI WASHINGTON (USA)\n\nSaxophonist, composer and producer Kamasi Washington and his release, the 3-CD The Epic, shook up the jazz critics’ pick lists in 2015. It was rated by the UK Guardian, Pitchfork, Allaboutjazz, Rough Trade, the Rolling Stone Top 50 list and many more, and hit the Top 3 in the Billboard Jazz Albums chart. It also won the 2016 American Music Prize. As if that wasn’t enough attention for a player always highly-respected by music insiders, but without any previous glitzy profile, Washington was also attracting fans from new parts of the music world for his work with Kendrick Lamar on the Grammy-winning To Pimp a Butterfly.\n\nLA-born Washington’s father was also a saxophonist, and in his early teens a curious Kamasi picked up the instrument – untaught – and began to play. He studied at the Hamilton High School Music Academy and then ethnomusicology at UCLA. While still a student, he toured in the Snoop Dogg band, as well as with the Gerald Wilson Orchestra and the touring ensemble of R&B legend Raphael Saadiq. Genre boundaries and barriers have never constrained him. Since then, Washington has worked with the proverbial “who’s who” – but not only of jazz, because his work has taken in greats such as McCoy Tyner, Freddie Hubbard and more, but also the likes of Mos Def, Chaka Khan and Flying Lotus and Thundercat. The Guardian’s Lanre Bakare hailed The Epic as a work that “looked beyond genre limits and tried to push things further”. But for Washington, that’s nothing new. He told Rolling Stone: “I think that it's a relationship that people talk about being new. But it's something that's always been there. You know, if you listen to so many of the great hip-hop records from the past, there are always jazz samples in there. So someone in there has awareness and an understanding of jazz….\n\nThe whole repurposing of music: the way hip-hop uses samples to create new songs, and in jazz, how we take show tunes and turn them into standards. [J]azz in the bebop era …was our way of expressing our intellect and expressing who we were. The thing about hip-hop is, like, that the instruments were taken out of schools [so] we'll take the records and sing over them! Hip-hop and jazz have always been intertwined.” ( http://www.kamasiwashington.com )\n\nMANGO GROOVE (SA)\n\nMultiple award-winning and Platinum-selling group Mango Groove, formed by bassist John Leyden, cut its teeth on the mid-80’s SA alternative music scene and exploded on to national consciousness with the release of its self-titled debut album in 1989. Presenting a unique combination of Claire Johnston’s soaring vocals and the classic African jazz pennywhistle and horn sounds of the late Mickey Vilakazi (who composed their hit Hellfire, but passed away in 1988) and other African jazzmen, the band had appeal across all South African communities. Since then the group, with its uniquely eclectic, big band ‘’Marabi-Pop’’ sound has continued to capture hearts. The group has released six studio albums, nine compilations and two dozen videos and singles, and demonstrated sold-out appeal at venues from the Sun City Superbowl to the Standard Bank Arena. NBC used their music in the broadcast of Nelson Mandela’s release from prison, and the group was subsequently a headliner at the inauguration concert.\n\nInternationally, they’ve also made a big impact, performing at the Hong Kong handover concert, the Paris SOS Racisme concert and the Montreux Jazz Festival and the Apollo in London. They continue to entrance younger audiences at SA festivals including Splashy Fen, Oppikoppi and Rockin’ the Daisies. IOL declared, “30 years on, the group still has juice.” Johnston agrees: “Now we’re the elders in the South African music industry and at a different phase in our career. So it would appear that we still have our fan base. It’s sort of young and old. It’s so thrilling that at OppiKoppi, people go nuts when we walk on stage and that’s the power of music. It never really goes away.” (http://www.mangogroove.co.za)\n\nNOMFUNDO XALUVA (SA)\n\nVocalist, pianist, composer and music educator, and two-time Metro Music Award-winner Nomfundo Xaluva, began her musical life very young. Port Elizabeth born, she started playing piano and singing in her school choir at Victoria Girls Primary Boarding School with never any doubt in her mind that this was what she wanted to do with her life. She holds a Masters in Jazz Studies for a dissertation on Miriam Makeba, whom she considers “a musician’s musician.”\n\nXaluva has shared stages with Sibongile Khumalo and Dianne Reeves, among many others. Her first Metro Award was for her 2013 recorded debut on Universal, Kusile (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxJ0OxEd6fs ). At IOL, critic Munya Vomo praised the outing for its richness and lyricism, and the flexibility of moods it was able to reflect. Now Xaluva has returned with the 2016 From Now On – which also won a Metro – and which pays very contemporary tribute to the styles and genres of classic south vocal jazz as originated by The Skylarks, Victor Ndlazilwane and Busi Mhlongo. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c33gvDnv5Qo&index=3&list=PLjkSmSV3b9LtYtTNGOWRSWxJW5KSGNM_z. She told Afripop magazine: “My music stems from identity. As an African-American art form you can lose your sense of identity in jazz. My music comes from my pride in being black, Xhosa, female, in having something to say – and feeling like that is enough.”\n\n(https://www.facebook.com/Nomfundo-Xaluva-Official-Artist-Page-251612111621339/ )\n\nPOPS MOHAMED (SA)\n\nComposer, multi-instrumentalist and producer “Pops” Mohamed was born Ismail Mohamed-Jan in the vibrant East Rand community of Kalamazoo in 1949. Kalamazoo was sadly soon uprooted to bleak Reigert Park and demolished, but Mohamed’s memories of the community’s vibrant hybridity have shaped his envelope-busting concept of music ever since. “Migrant miners playing their mouth bows with jazz musicians jamming on Count Basie…these sounds are always in my mind.” He learned guitar from jazzmen at Dorkay House, and subsequently worked in multiple hit-making pop outfits, sometimes alongside bassist Sipho Gumede.\n\nAfter cutting albums such as Black Disco (recently reissued: https://matsulimusic.bandcamp.com/album/night-express ) and Movement in the City, Mohamed’s music took a more roots turn. “I figured that protecting and preserving our indigenous music could be my contribution to the struggle. We must know our heritage. I thought: if the Boers take that from us, we’re fucked!” He mastered traditional instruments from kora to mouthbow and didgeridoo, while continuing to arrange and produce for a galaxy of South African jazz artists (including the late Moses Molelekwa’s debut, Finding Oneself), as well as working with, among others, Andreas Vollenweider, the London Sound Collective and ex-Blood Sweat and Tears trumpeter Bruce Cassidy. Most recently, he has been working with the representatives of Kalahari San communities to both preserve and expose their healing sounds, and in Cape Town with Dave Reynolds and Tony Cedras (The Urban Khoisan Project: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDhIT_uwHfU ; At Bluebird Garage https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Up6H8_Jze4 ).\n\nTHANDISWA MAZWAI (SA)\n\nMultiple award-winner Thandiswa Mazwai was born in the Eastern Cape but grew up in Soweto in a highly politically conscious and active family. Thadiswa produces modern music that still manages to remember and acknowledge a heritage that stretches from split-tone singing and bow music to jazz, soul and jive. She studied literature and international relations at Wits, and first came to public notice with Kora, SAMA and Metro winning kwaito music trio Bongo Maffin, formed in Cape Town in 1996. Mazwai released her debut solo project, Zabalaza, in 2004; it reached double platinum sales and won a Kora Award and four SAMAs. Zabalaza was followed by Ibokwe, Song of the Forgotten Free and, late in 2016, Belede, her debut for Universal Music. Belede features pianist Nduduzo Makhathini, bassist Herbie Tsoaeli and drummer Ayanda Sikade: a sensitive and imaginative jazz trio.\n\nIt is primarily a tribute to Mazwai’s late mother, who died when she was young, as well as other women, such as Miriam Makeba, Busi Mhlongo and Dorothy Masuka who created rebellious and questioning music. The album revisits historic South African classics including Nontsokolo and Makeba’s West Wind in a sharply contemporary context that includes acknowledgment of struggles such as the #FeesMustFall movement. The Mail & Guardian’s Kwanele Sosibo said of Belede: “It is a jazz album, yes, but not in the way one might expect.” Mazwai told IOL “I aspire to be a part of a group of musicians that sound entrancingly South African. I grew up in a very strong pan- African and black consciousness home. My mother was a radical Pan Africanist. She wore African clothes.” Mazwai recalled that even when she started out with Bongo Maffin, “I thought about my mother and preserving the memory of what she taught me”. https://www.facebook.com/Thandiswa-Red-Mazwai-142738035837/\n\nTOM MISCH (UK)\n\nUK-based singer/composer, multi-instrumentalist and producer Tom Misch had an unlikely start for a rising star of digital mixes: at four, he started learning violin after being taken to classical concerts by his parents. He added other instruments and by 11 had acquired a loop pedal and was beginning to create his own compositions. By his mid-teens, he had discovered Erykah Badu and J Dilla; two years later what he calls his take on “soulful electronic music” was going out on Soundcloud, attracting the attention of Berlin producer Lamnobodi. That led to the release of Beat Tape 1 via Bandcamp; later Beat Tape 2 (https://tommisch1.bandcamp.com ) appeared – Misch calls it “a combination of beats and more fully-fledged songs” – and now the EP Reverie (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa5HNkGrl8E/)\n\nThe Edge described Reverie as “Chipmunked vocals, slap bass, jazz guitar, G-funk synths, a breathy sax, trip-hop beats, hand claps, a string quartet, steel drums, maracas…such is the heady cocktail that Tom Misch has here concocted…Misch has somehow managed to balance it all perfectly, keeping things afloat.” But Misch’s career is still growing. He is developing his voice via singing lessons, and playing live much more : “I think a big pressure to me right now is the live stuff, because I’ve built up a reputation as a producer and a sort of bedroom music maker guy. Now I’m actually leaving the bedroom and playing shows, and I want to live up to the expectation people have. That’s what’s really shaping how I write my songs,” he told rwdmag. (http://www.tommisch.com)\n\nAMADOU & MARIAM (MALI)\n\nAmadou Bagayoko (guitar & vocals) & Mariam Doumbia (vocals) are a Grammy Award nominated musical couple who have enthralled audiences since getting together in 1983. Influenced by the records of Jimi Hendrix, Eric Clapton and Pink Floyd as well as traditional African music, the couple has overcome personal challenges to forge a successful musical career that has seen them travel the world. Since the late 1990s, their musical style has evolved from sparse vocal and guitar arrangements to a more mature and eminently appealing ‘afro-blues’ sound. Their transition from world music stages to rock festival headliners came with 2005’s Manu Chao-produced Dimanche à Bamako, one of the best-selling African albums of all time, winning a prestigious Les Victoires de la Musique award and two BBC Radio 3 awards for World Music.\n\nThe autobiography Away From The Light, published in June 2010, tells the story of their early years, during which they accepted and adapted to their blindness, and ends with the duo performing to Barack Obama at the Nobel Peace Prize ceremony in December 2009. In between, the book traces the moment they met at the Institute for Young Blind in Bamako and the epic journey that has made the couple the best- selling and best-loved act to come out of Africa this century.\n\nANGIE STONE (USA)\n\nGrammy nominated singer, MC, self-taught keyboardist, and prolific songwriter, Angie Stone's first claim to fame was her membership in the Sequence - an all-female trio that recorded for pioneering hip-hop label Sugar Hill. Several years later, she re-emerged as the lead vocalist for Vertical Hold, where she scored with the smooth urban dance track \"Seems You're Much Too Busy,\" a Top 40 R&B hit during the summer of 1993 that led to her very productive solo career. With the release of her 1999 solo debut, she became one of neo-soul's leading lights, providing sharp insight into romantic relationships with her smoky yet up-front voice. Her most popular hits include “No More Rain (In This Cloud)”, \"Wish I Didn't Miss You\" and “Brotha”. Her new album Dreams will be released on 06 November 2015.\n\nAlso an occasional actor, she appeared in a handful of movies, including The Fighting Temptations and Pastor Brown, as well as the television programs Moesha, Girlfriends, and Lincoln Heights.\n\nBENJAMIN JEPHTA QUINTET (SA)\n\nBassist and composer Benjamin Jephta has already made a name for himself as one of South Africa’s premier jazz double bass and electric bass players. A graduate of the jazz program at the prestigious South African College of Music at the University of Cape Town, he graduated in 2013 with the fourth year class medal. Jephta has performed with a range of local and international musicians including McCoy Mrubata, Sibongile Khumalo, Paul Hanmer, Feya Faku, Jimmy Dludlu, Simphiwe Dana, Mark Fransman, Hugh Masekela, Melanie Scholtz, Marcus Wyatt, Bokani Dyer and many others. He is involved in various original projects ranging from playing double bass in a free jazz orchestra to synth-bass in a pop band.\n\nGrowing up in Mitchell’s Plain, he attended Muizenberg High School where he fostered a love for jazz under the mentorship of Fred Kuit (winner of the 2012 SAJE Lifetime Achievement Award in Jazz Education). Aside from performing in venues and festivals locally since the age of 15, Jephta has also performed with various orchestras and small ensembles in Africa, Europe and Asia. Jephta currently spearheads two projects that play his original material; a six-piece African/ fusion/ funk project called the Tribe of Benjamin, and his acoustic quintet who play music drawing on gospel and South African roots. With his quintet, featuring Kyle Shepherd (piano), Marcus Wyatt (trumpet), Sisonke Xonti (sax) and Sphelelo Mazibuko (drums), he released his debut album Homecoming in January 2015.\n\nJAZZ ATTACK 2015 ft. PETER WHITE, RICK BRAUN and EUGE GROOVE (USA)\n\nFounded by Rick Braun and Richard Elliot in 2005 when they were partners at their record label ARTizen Music Group, Jazz Attack has been winning the hearts of contemporary jazz fans year after year. Rick Braun who will lead the ensemble at the CTIJF in 2016, is a gregarious, charismatic musician-songwriter-producer whose smooth jazz and jazz-funk trumpet playing has amassed a catalogue of No. 1 Billboard Contemporary Jazz chart and radio hits over his career. Although his horn work has been his signature voice establishing him as a pre-eminent player and genre icon, Braun is also comfortable crooning jazz standards that delight his fans and those new to the groove.\n\nGuitarist Peter White brings his uniquely engaging style to the Jazz Attack band. Over the years, he has maintained a reputation as one of the most versatile and prolific acoustic guitarists on the contemporary jazz landscape. He combines elements of jazz, pop and classical guitar to create a sound that is singular and at the same time accessible to a broad audience. His first solo recording Reveillez-Vous, quickly rose to the #1 position in the NAC arena, and his subsequent releases all topped both radio and retail charts across the USA, including the Billboard Contemporary Jazz chart.\n\nChart topping multi-instrumentalist Euge Groove joins Jazz Attack on saxophone and brings his wide ranging musical taste, impeccable musicianship and keen showmanship to the stage. The saxophonist, composer, producer and DJ, has built an impressive career as a free spirit who remains true to his own artistic vision. His first single from the self-titled Warner Bros. debut ‘Vinyl’, set a record by spending 27 weeks on the R&B charts. Since then, his singles and CDs have continued to be at the top of Billboard and R&B charts.\n\nMAFIKIZOLO ft. TSEPO TSHOLA (SA)\n\nTheo Kgosinkwe and Nhlanhla Nciza are Mafikizolo, one of South Africa’s favourite pop groups. Effortlessly combining afro-pop, kwela and marabi, which has become their trademark sound, their seventh album Six Mabone includes overtones of blues and swing and demonstrates why they have such a large and loyal following. Having been in the industry for eight years, the duo took time out after the tragic death of one of their band members to refocus their energy and creative talent. The result is an album that will transport listeners on a musical journey and appeal equally to young and old alike. Criss-crossing a musical heritage from the past and updated with sounds and lyrics of today, Mafikizolo are back with a bang.\n\nJoining them on stage at the 17th Cape Town International Jazz Festival will be the legendary ‘Village Pope’, Tsepo Tshola whose wholesome lyrical messaging is wonderfully intimate and personal, and comes as a creative departure from his previous musical pronouncements on social and political issues. The collaboration is set to be a masterful musical storytelling session.\n\nMARK TURNER (USA)\n\nIn a career that spans two decades and encompasses a broad array of musical ventures, saxophonist Mark Turner has emerged as a towering presence in the jazz community. With a distinctive personal tone, singular improvisational skills and an innovative, challenging compositional approach, he’s earned a far-reaching reputation as one of jazz’s most original and influential musical forces.\n\nA New York Times profile of Turner titled “The Best Jazz Player You’ve Never Heard” called him “possibly jazz’s premier player,” noting his reputation amongst his peers and his influential stature in the jazz world. He has released six albums as a leader to date and been involved in several more as a side-man and collaborative contributor that makes up his diverse discography.\n\nAlways intrigued by the whole history of jazz music and African-American culture, as well as the music itself, Turner feels a connection to his father, also a saxophonist who died when Mark was just 18 months old. Turner’s meticulous and analytical de-construction of the other jazz greats has led him to better understand himself and develop his own unique musical voice. With an impressive musical history already under his belt and more on the way, Mark Turner is clearly on the verge of a creative renaissance. As The New York Times noted, “His best work is clearly still ahead of him.”\n\nMESHELL NDEGEOCELLO (USA)\n\nTen-time Grammy nominated mercurial and masterful, Meshell Ndegeocello is a singer-songwriter, rapper, bassist and vocalist who has survived the best and worst of what a career in music has to offer. She has eschewed genre for originality, celebrity for longevity, and musical trends for musical truths. She has lived through the boom and bust of the industry and emerged just as she entered - unequivocally herself. Fans have come to expect the unexpected from Meshell, and faithfully followed her on sojourns into soul, spoken word, R&B, jazz, hip hop, rock, as well as go-go, new wave and punk. All of her sounds and albums (eleven to date) are bound by a lyrical, spiritual search for love, justice, respect, resolution and happiness.\n\nA bass player above all else, Meshell brings her warm and melodic groove to everything she does and has appeared alongside the Rolling Stones, Madonna, Alanis Morrisette, James Blood Ulmer, The Blind Boys of Alabama, Tony Allen, John Medeski, Billy Preston and Chaka Khan. As for her own bass-playing influences, she credits Sting, Jaco Pastorius, Family Man Barrett and Stevie Wonder. Meshell was the first woman to be featured on the cover of Bass Player magazine and remains one of few women who writes the music, sings the songs and leads the band.\n\nMUZART AND KHULI CHANA (SA)\n\nWhen a locally and internationally award-winning hip hop artist joins forces with a SAMA nominated pop sensation band that’s young and vibrant, you get a magical experience from watching a dynamic fusion of talent on one stage. The on stage chemistry between Khuli Chana and Muzart is a winning formula that appeals to both a youthful and mature audience.\n\nMuzart comprises of multi-talented musicians Tshegofatso \"Tazzy\" Lehutso, Victory “Vic” Chauke and actress, singer, Rorisang \"Rori\" Thandekiso. The group has created a chart topping, afro-pop sound that has been described as “conjuring a vivid vision of unclouded sunshine and positivity; together they sculpt a truly uplifting sound”. Layers of jazz, pop, house, gospel and soul fuse to forge their sound – an interplay of genres, which is underpinned by positivity and a celebration of life and love. In celebrating this love, the group has also been named official ambassadors for the Nelson Mandela Children’s Hospital and is actively involved with related projects.\n\nSinger-songwriter, humanitarian and rapper, Khuli Chana (Kholane Morule) brings a distinct flavour and sound to the hip hop and Motswako music genres. Motswako encompasses elements from various musical backgrounds, involving street-talk and highly influential messages in Setswana, English and other South African languages, which Khuli Chana has dubbed “Tswenglish”. In his short career, there have been many highlights including recently making it to #1 in the UK on BBC 1Xtra with his single ‘No Lie’ featuring Patoranking, and opening up for international acts such as Big Sean and Kendrik Lamar as well as the curtain raiser act for Drake’s South African tour.\n\nNATHI with special guest VUSI NOVA (SA)\n\nWith no formal training, Nathi Mankayi, entered and won a small regional talent search competition called ‘Dare to Dream’. Winning this event, Nathi has embarked on a journey where his dreams and aspirations are indeed coming true. His debut album Buyel'ekhaya has racked up an impressive download following on iTunes with the hit track ‘Nomvula’ winning hearts and fans all over the country - #nomvulafever. The afro-soul singer who is also an artist and sculptor, has had his music described as ”meaningful and authentic”, addressing his past challenges and future hopes with a husky voice and an acoustic air. His story and lyrics resonate with a refreshing honesty that will appeal, inspire and motivate all who listen and truly hear.\n\nThe hugely talented R&B soul singer Vusi Nova heard Nathi sing as a result of the ‘Dare to Dream’ competition and asked the singer to collaborate with him on a single. The result was ‘Noma Kanjani’ which became a critical and popular success. Vusi himself is a multi-award nominated, highly accomplished and popular artist whose songs, ’I’d rather go blind’ and ‘Walk into the Light’ have garnered the respect and following of a loyal fanbase\n\nNDUDUZO MAKHATINI'S LISTENING TO THE GROUND (SA) ft. EDDIE PARKER (UK)\n\nGrowing up in the small town uMgungundlovu near Pietermaritzburg, KwaZulu Natal, the award winning jazz pianist, Nduduzo Makhathini was surrounded by music as a child. Coming from a very musical family – his mother was a pianist and his father a guitarist – it was when he realized that his voice limited his expression that he focused on the piano. He feels his career has developed in what he describes as an organic process, starting with his upbringing and the influence of his mother, his first piano teacher. Makhathini has three albums out: ‘Sketches of Tomorrow’ ‘Mother Tongue’ (nominated for best jazz at the SAMA’s 2015 and ‘Listening To The Ground’. He is also this year’s (2015) Standard Bank Young Artists For Jazz and 1st recipient of the British Academy Newton Advanced Fellowship Masters Scholarship. EDDIE PARKER (UK) Eddie Parker is a multi-instrumentalist, best known as a jazz flautist and composer. He has been central to some of the most important British jazz in recent years. Parker has played with Bheki Mseleku, who also happens to be Mkhize’s former mentor and as such, the current pairing has some of the late masters’ influences. Mkhize and Parker produce new music that is detailed, accessible and exciting to hear. Combining English folk and French Impressionism with the great jazz traditions, the two perform beautiful melodies and exciting grooves that draw from African sounds.\n\nRAHUL SHARMA (INDIA) AND GEORGE BROOKS (USA)\n\nRahul Sharma has carved a niche for himself in the world of Indian classical and fusion music, with over 60 released albums. As an award-winning santoor player, he has experimented with his music and taken the 100-stringed instrument into various genres from classical to new age, jazz and world fusion/electronica. Rahul learnt music and the santoor from his father and Guru Pandit Shivkumar Sharma, who is a music legend in India and the world over. "
