Just a short little post from fractious Quebec ahead of our April election, that I thought might interest some other comms/PR folk on here.

Pierre Karl Péladeau, majority owner of the Quebecor media empire (Sun Media, the Journal de Montréal, TVA, the Videotron cable/Internet/mobile company, etc.) has just entered the race as a candidate in a safe-seat riding. Despite his promise to put his holdings in a blind trust, there are concerns on all sides — plenty of supporters of his new party, the left-of-centre Parti Québécois, feel he runs his companies with an iron fist and is too quick to lock out unionized employees. Some are even former journalists who worked for him, or ex-union bosses who’ve had unpleasant things to say about him in the past. Plenty of PQ opponents are just as worried about the potential for media manipulation and Berlusconi-esque coverage. One Journal de Montréal writer is already predicting a “Péladeau-mania” in Quebec, “and not just because his eyes are the colour of Quebec’s flag.” Her Pulitzer is probably in the mail.
