When he becomes chief executive officer in May, he takes over media businesses with more dismal growth prospects.\n\nHis responsibilities as CEO will include the Sun Media chain of English-language tabloids and Le Journal de Montreal, Quebec’s most-read daily. Sales at the group, which accounts for about a quarter of Quebecor’s total revenue, have dropped every year since 2008 as advertising waned."
