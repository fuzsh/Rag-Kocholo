        "text": "Article content\n\nMONTREAL – Quebecor Inc. has abandoned its national newspaper ambitions as the company shifts its attention to its faster-growing television and wireless business.\n\nWith the company’s announcement Monday that it struck a deal to sell its Sun Media English-language newspaper operations to Postmedia Network Canada Corp. for about $316-million in cash, Quebecor becomes a nearly pure-play telecommunications company with an estimated 97% of its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization coming from the assets of its Vidéotron unit.\n\nWe apologize, but this video has failed to load.\n\nTry refreshing your browser, or\n\ntap here to see other videos from our team.\n\nQuebecor Inc turns focus to wireless as Postmedia deal ends newspaper ambitions Back to video\n\nAdvertisement 2\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nTHIS CONTENT IS RESERVED FOR SUBSCRIBERS ONLY\n\nSubscribe now to read the latest news in your city and across Canada.\n\nExclusive articles from Barbara Shecter, Joe O'Connor, Gabriel Friedman, and others.\n\nDaily content from Financial Times, the world's leading global business publication.\n\nUnlimited online access to read articles from Financial Post, National Post and 15 news sites across Canada with one account.\n\nNational Post ePaper, an electronic replica of the print edition to view on any device, share and comment on.\n\nDaily puzzles, including the New York Times Crossword.\n\nSUBSCRIBE TO UNLOCK MORE ARTICLES\n\nSubscribe now to read the latest news in your city and across Canada.\n\nExclusive articles from Barbara Shecter, Joe O'Connor, Gabriel Friedman and others.\n\nDaily content from Financial Times, the world's leading global business publication.\n\nUnlimited online access to read articles from Financial Post, National Post and 15 news sites across Canada with one account.\n\nNational Post ePaper, an electronic replica of the print edition to view on any device, share and comment on.\n\nDaily puzzles, including the New York Times Crossword.\n\nREGISTER / SIGN IN TO UNLOCK MORE ARTICLES\n\nCreate an account or sign in to continue with your reading experience.\n\nAccess articles from across Canada with one account.\n\nShare your thoughts and join the conversation in the comments.\n\nEnjoy additional articles per month.\n\nGet email updates from your favourite authors.\n\nSign In or Create an Account\n\nEmail Address\n\nor\n\nArticle content\n\nIt also becomes decidedly more Quebec-centric, as the aspirations of previous management to create a continental media and printing powerhouse give way to a retreat into its home market.\n\nWe apologize, but this video has failed to load.\n\nTry refreshing your browser, or\n\ntap here to see other videos from our team.\n\n“This transaction represents a retrenchment,” said former Quebecor chief executive and chairman Charles Cavell, the architect of the company’s purchase of the Sun chain 15 years ago. “I am somewhat disappointed because I think that Quebecor having an English franchise was a good thing. That’s why it was done way back when. What’s changed, I can’t tell you.”\n\nArticle content\n\nQuebecor is taking a bath on the deal. The company paid nearly $1-billion to purchase the Sun chain in 1999 following a heated takeover battle with rival publisher Torstar Corp.\n\nQuebecor shares fell 1.6% to $28.17 in trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange Monday. They’ve gained 16% over the past 12 months.\n\n“Quebecor investors are looking at the telecommunication business as the reason they buy the stock,” said Desjardins Securities analyst Maher Yaghi. “There’s no reason left to hold [the newspapers].”\n\nPostmedia will buy 175 newspapers and publications from Quebecor, including six major urban dailies. The deal also include the online Canoe portal in English.\n\nArticle content\n\nAdvertisement 3\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nQuebecor chief executive Pierre Dion declared this summer that the media conglomerate is “ready, willing and able” to become Canada’s fourth national wireless player to challenge incumbents BCE Inc., Rogers Communications Inc. and Telus Corp. Armed with some key airwave spectrum licenses outside Quebec, it is now seeking regulatory change on wholesale roaming prices before committing funds to a countrywide expansion.\n\nProceeds from the newspaper sale could be dedicated to that effort, which one analyst estimated will cost between as much as $2-billion. The money could also be used to buy back pension fund Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec’s 24.6% ownership position in Quebecor Media, which is up for discussion in 2016.\n\nQuebecor is the dominant media company in Quebec, controlling cable company Videotron as well as the TVA network, the biggest French language broadcaster in North America. In recent years, its newspaper division has contributed a decreasing percentage of the company’s bottom line, with 18% of overall revenue and about 7% of operating income generated by the news media unit in 2013.\n\nAdvertisement 4\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nManagement had acknowledged as recently as last month that the company was open to selling more newspaper assets after unloading a group of Quebec weeklies late last year to Transcontinental Inc. But it gave no hint a deal was imminent.\n\nWe apologize, but this video has failed to load.\n\nTry refreshing your browser, or\n\ntap here to see other videos from our team.\n\nThe deal “comes at a time when the Canadian newspaper business absolutely needs consolidation to remain viable and to compete with digital media,” Mr. Dion said in a statement. “Postmedia possesses extensive expertise and the ability and will to invest in these publications’ long-term development.”\n\nAnalysts say wireless is among Quebecor’s greatest opportunities. Launched four years ago, the company’s wireless business now has 550,000 individual and business subscribers and a roughly 13% market share in Quebec. Desjardins Securities estimates the company will be able to win a 20-25% share within two years as it steals business from rivals.\n\nUnder the deal with Postmedia, Quebecor retains ownership of local paper titles Journal de Montréal and Journal de Québec as well as ownership of the Sun News Network through TVA Group. The Quebec papers remain key elements that fit into the company’s convergence strategy, in which it cross-promotes its various programming across different platforms.\n\nAdvertisement 5\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nQuebecor also owns several publishing houses as well as a stable of French-language magazines.\n\nRecommended from Editorial\n\nPostmedia and Sun Media papers can ‘co-exist and help each other’ in digital era: Godfrey\n\nPostmedia buys Sun Media’s English titles for $316-million including flagship Toronto Sun\n\nPostmedia rolls out reimagined Ottawa Citizen as part of new four-platform strategy\n\nPostmedia is allowing Quebecor to use the Sun logo for one year for the Sun News TV property, after which it has to change it. The long-term future of the conservative-leaning TV station remains in question as Quebecor analyzes the financial impact of two separate decisions last week on distribution by Canada’s broadcast regulator, Quebecor spokesman Martin Tremblay said.\n\nSelling the Sun papers marks an end to the political oddity of a federalist newspaper chain being owned by an avowed separatist, namely Quebecor controlling shareholder Pierre Karl Péladeau.\n\nMr. Péladeau’s father, also an ardent nationalist, bore the brunt of an acerbic anti-separatist tirade in the pages of Sun Media publications during Quebecor’s first run at the Toronto-based chain in 1996. When his son entered politics for the Parti Québécois this past spring with a fist-pumping goal of making Quebec an independent country, the awkwardness intensified.\n\nAdvertisement 6\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nNow a member of Quebec’s National Assembly, Mr. Péladeau is not involved in the daily management of Quebecor but he retains control of the company through super-voting shares.\n\nHe has not put that stock in a blind trust despite despite a March 9 statement from Quebecor indicating he pledged to do so if elected.\n\nThe issue has become a potential liability for Mr. Péladeau as he seeks the PQ leadership. Leadership rival Jean François Lisée said over the weekend that Mr. Péleadeau needs to choose between his company and his political aspirations.\n\n“You can’t be a party leader and control a media empire,” Mr. Lisée was quoted as saying by the Journal de Montréal. “He’s in a particular situation.”\n\nArticle content\n\nShare this article in your social network"
