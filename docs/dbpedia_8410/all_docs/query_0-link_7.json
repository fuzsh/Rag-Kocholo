        "text": "Article content\n\nThe recent application of the Sun News Network television channel for a so-called CRTC “mandatory carriage” licence — which would require cable and satellite services to carry Sun News, and charge subscribers for the service — has raised the ire of certain market purists, including National Post columnist Andrew Coyne. The suggestion seems to be that a news organization that endorses a free-market editorial stance is being hypocritical by asking for the same regulatory treatment as its Canadian competitors.\n\nWe apologize, but this video has failed to load.\n\nTry refreshing your browser, or\n\ntap here to see other videos from our team.\n\nPierre Karl Peladeau: All Sun Media wants is a level playing field Back to video\n\nWe apologize, but this video has failed to load.\n\nTry refreshing your browser, or\n\ntap here to see other videos from our team.\n\nAdvertisement 2\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nTHIS CONTENT IS RESERVED FOR SUBSCRIBERS ONLY\n\nSubscribe now to read the latest news in your city and across Canada.\n\nExclusive articles by top sports columnists Patrick Johnston, Ben Kuzma, J.J.

We’ve backed up our words with action. More than 10 years ago, our cable company, Videotron, introduced a package that allows customers to pay for only those channels they want to watch along with channels deemed mandatory by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission. You will find this only in Quebec. Our main competitor, Bell, does not offer this option in other provinces.\n\nThe Canadian television market is complicated, and its regulations reflect the many competing policy goals and issues that the CRTC has tried to address over the past 40 years. While a free-market approach is a noble vision, and one to build toward, it bears little resemblance to the market as it operates today.\n\nArticle content\n\nAdvertisement 3\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nTelevision distribution continues to be a highly regulated environment. The type of licence granted to a channel by the CRTC has an enormous impact on the availability of that channel to viewers, and what the associated revenues will be. Change is constrained, in part, by a Broadcasting Act that pre-dates the Internet. Central to the act and the CRTC is the goal of promoting Canadian content. This is manifested in a range of requirements, as well as preferential treatment accorded to some channels over others.\n\nCoyne and others may not agree that Canadian content or Canadian news should be treated differently than foreign content. But that does not change the law as it exists today, or the thousands of CRTC decisions that, historically, have served to foster the production and distribution of Canadian content.\n\nAdvertisement 4\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nIn the case of cable news, when CBC Newsworld was launched it received mandatory carriage — a privilege it still maintains in Quebec. CTV News Channel received similar benefits at its launch. Other news channels, such as BNN and CP24, still have “Category A” licences, meaning that cable and satellite providers must offer them to their customers. CRTC officials granted these preferential licences because they believe Canadians should have access to Canadian news content.\n\nThis approach was not taken with Sun News, which was given a highly inferior “Category B” digital specialty licence, meaning there was no obligation for the channel to be distributed and no required distribution fee. Moreover, because this is a “digital” licence, the roughly 25 per cent of Canadians who have traditional analog cable cannot make a “market decision” to watch Sun News.\n\nAdvertisement 5\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nAfter months of negotiations with cable and satellite providers, Sun News was able to gain access to only forty per cent of Canadian households. Major providers such as Telus and MTS were not distributing the channel at all, despite offering countless foreign news channels.\n\nWas Sun News asking too high a price? No. The average monthly subscription price for a Canadian news channel is 33 cents per subscriber. CBC News Network gets 63 cents while Sun News gets as little as six cents.\n\nDid consumers make a choice not to watch Sun News? No. Almost 60 per cent of the market has never even had access to the channel.\n\nMillions of Canadians have a contract with their cable or satellite provider that is combined with Internet and cellular services. To say that customers of Telus or MTS, for instance, should be expected to switch providers in order to gain access to Sun News, is not realistic. Nor is it realistic to say to the 25 per cent of Canadians with analog cable — a significant portion of the Canadian population — that they must buy a digital box if they want Sun News.\n\nAdvertisement 6\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nWe are not looking for special favours. We don’t want to be treated better than others; but we don’t want to be treated worse, either, which is what we are enduring.\n\nIt is why we have asked that Sun News be granted the same privilege of mandatory carriage that CBC, CTV and every other Canadian news channel received when they launched. Once such networks have been exposed to the Canadian public — we suggest a term of five years — they should then transfer to the same type of licence that CBC News Network and CTV News Channel recently moved to. To take another approach would tilt the market heavily toward incumbent channels.\n\nIt would be fatal not just to Sun News, but to any future all-news startups, and to all new channels dedicated to Canadian content.\n\nAdvertisement 7\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nPierre Karl Peladeau is CEO of Quebecor Inc., of which the Sun Media Corp. is a subsidiary.\n\nThe editorial pages editor is Gordon Clark, who can be reached at gclark@theprovince.com.
