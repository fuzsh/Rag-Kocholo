        "text": "Article content\n\nMONTREAL – Quebecor Inc.’s chairwoman has decided to leave the company after three years, a surprise decision that raises further questions about what’s happening behind the scenes at the telecom and media giant in the wake of controlling shareholder Pierre Karl Péladeau’s decision to enter politics to make Quebec a country.\n\nFrançoise Bertrand, who has overseen Quebecor since March 2011 as chairwoman, will not stand for re-election at the company’s annual meeting June 19. Current vice-chairman Brian Mulroney, former prime minister of Canada and a Quebecor board member for 15 years, will be nominated to replace her, according to a company filing.\n\nWe apologize, but this video has failed to load.\n\nTry refreshing your browser, or\n\ntap here to see other videos from our team.\n\nString of surprise departures at Quebecor continues as chairwoman plans exit Back to video\n\nAdvertisement 2\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nTHIS CONTENT IS RESERVED FOR SUBSCRIBERS ONLY\n\nSubscribe now to read the latest news in your city and across Canada.\n\nExclusive articles from Barbara Shecter, Joe O'Connor, Gabriel Friedman, and others.\n\nDaily content from Financial Times, the world's leading global business publication.\n\nUnlimited online access to read articles from Financial Post, National Post and 15 news sites across Canada with one account.\n\nNational Post ePaper, an electronic replica of the print edition to view on any device, share and comment on.\n\nDaily puzzles, including the New York Times Crossword.\n\nSUBSCRIBE TO UNLOCK MORE ARTICLES\n\nSubscribe now to read the latest news in your city and across Canada.\n\nExclusive articles from Barbara Shecter, Joe O'Connor, Gabriel Friedman and others.\n\nDaily content from Financial Times, the world's leading global business publication.\n\nUnlimited online access to read articles from Financial Post, National Post and 15 news sites across Canada with one account.\n\nNational Post ePaper, an electronic replica of the print edition to view on any device, share and comment on.\n\nDaily puzzles, including the New York Times Crossword.\n\nREGISTER / SIGN IN TO UNLOCK MORE ARTICLES\n\nCreate an account or sign in to continue with your reading experience.\n\nAccess articles from across Canada with one account.\n\nShare your thoughts and join the conversation in the comments.\n\nEnjoy additional articles per month.\n\nGet email updates from your favourite authors.\n\nSign In or Create an Account\n\nEmail Address\n\nor\n\nArticle content\n\nMs. Bertrand’s decision to quit marks the second major departure at Quebecor in little over a month. Robert Dépatie, who took over as chief executive from Mr. Péladeau as he settled into a vice-chairman role, is also leaving the company after barely a year as CEO.\n\n“[Mulroney stepping up] creates a little more stability for investors because they were starting to see Quebecor as a separatist company,” said Troy Crandall, a telecom analyst with 3Macs in Montreal. “You’ve got to basically rebuild the relationship somehow.”\n\nArticle content\n\nThe leadership changes come at a sensitive time for Quebecor, which is weighing an expansion of its wireless Videotron business outside its home province after winning 20-year licences for airwaves in Ontario, Alberta and British Columbia. The Harper government is keen on seeing a viable fourth mobile carrier nationally to compete with existing players BCE Inc., Rogers Communications Inc. and Telus Corp.\n\nMr. Dépatie cited health reasons for his decision, announced April 28. He leaves Quebecor with a generous pay package worth $7.8-million, according to the filing, reflecting the board’s decision to reward his long-term contribution to the success of the company.\n\nArticle content\n\nAdvertisement 3\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nMs. Bertrand told a Toronto newspaper that she felt it was time to step down. “The events of this spring led to a lot of changes, and I didn’t feel as comfortable,” she was quoted as saying. She declined to comment when asked if a dispute had led to her departure.\n\nMr. Péladeau stunned voters March 9 when he announced he would seek political office in Quebec as a candidate of the separatist Parti Québécois, denying repeatedly in the weeks before that he would make the jump. He got elected and is now considered a top candidate to lead the party in the wake of Pauline Marois’s departure.\n\nHis decision, and subsequent fist-pumping call “to make Quebec a country,” left nearly no one indifferent. But for Mr. Mulroney, an ardent federalist who mentored Mr. Péladeau for years, it was particularly unsettling.\n\nQuebecor announced that same day that Mr. Péladeau would no longer be a member of its board or management. It also said the father of three, Quebecor’s controlling shareholder, had pledged to place his financial interests in the company in a blind trust if he won a seat in the legislature. “As of today, Mr. Péladeau will no longer take part in any decisions respecting the corporation’s daily or strategic management,” Quebecor said in March.\n\nAdvertisement 4\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nThere is speculation that Mr. Péladeau has continued to exert his power despite the fact he was no longer an executive or director, making things uncomfortable for Mr. Dépatie and Ms. Bertrand.\n\nQuebecor spokesman Martin Tremblay denied Thursday that Mr. Péladeau has any ongoing influence over corporate operations and strategy, adding the remaining team of officers and administrators has several years of experience with the company and will ensure continuity. New CEO Pierre Dion, for example, is a company veteran who’s sat on Quebecor’s executive committee since 2004. Pierre Laurin, who will become vice-chairman and lead director if he’s elected, has been a Quebecor director since 1991.\n\n“I think we have serious stability,” said Mr. Tremblay.\n\nBy assuming greater responsibility within the corporation, Mr. Mulroney will be seen as a calming influence on the company after the leadership flux. He may also have to rebuild any bridges burned with customers and shareholders who don’t like Mr. Péladeau’s politics.\n\n“Mulroney will put the ‘Canada’ back into Quebecor,” said Iain Grant of telecom consultancy SeaBoard Group. “[This] restores balance. Sussex Drive and Bay Street will both be relieved.”\n\nAdvertisement 5\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nThe former statesman is considered an ideal delegate for Quebecor in its dealings with the federal government.\n\nThere may be negotiations over several key areas before Quebecor decides to invest in a national wireless rollout, including how much it can piggyback on the infrastructure of the incumbents. Canada’s telecom regulator is currently examining domestic wholesale roaming prices and industry observers expect it will set limits on what the big national players can charge their smaller rivals to use their networks.\n\nLaunching a Canada-wide wireless footprint will cost Quebecor between $1-billion and $2-billion just to set up things like retail points of sale, Desjardins Securities analyst Maher Yaghi estimates. He said investors would not back such a move for the company without a regulatory change in the current pricing system.\n\nQuebecor shares fell 1.7% to $26.29 on the Toronto Stock Exchange Thursday. They’ve been rebounding from a 2014 low of $23.55 in February. The company’s assets include cable company Videotron, the Sun Media chain of newspapers and television network TVA.\n\nArticle content\n\nShare this article in your social network"
