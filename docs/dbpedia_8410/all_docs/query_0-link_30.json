        "text": "Quebecor Inc., Quebecor Media Inc. and the Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec announced today the completion of a $1.5 billion transaction, decreasing the Caisse’s interest in Quebecor Media from 45.3% to 24.6%.\n\n\"Our intention was to take advantage of the window of opportunity created by the favourable conditions on the debt markets to increase our interest in Quebecor Media. We believe in the company’s future. Repurchasing a portion of the Caisse’s investment, while we continue our partnership, will allow us to benefit from the company’s expected growth over the next few years,\" said Pierre Karl Péladeau, President and Chief Executive Officer of Quebecor, Quebecor Media and Sun Media Corporation.\n\n\"We are convinced of Quebecor Media’s potential to create value. For this reason, we are retaining a substantial stake in the company. In our view, the conditions are right to rebalance our portfolio by divesting a part of the major position we held in the media and telecom sector,\" said Michael Sabia, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Caisse.\n\nBy implementing its corporate strategy, Quebecor Media has more than tripled its operating income since the transaction, reaching more than $1.3 billion in 2011. This sustained growth has enabled Quebecor Media to pay substantial dividends to its shareholders, including a total of $324 million to the Caisse, since 2003.\n\nTransaction highlights\n\nRepurchase by Quebecor Media Inc. of 20,351,307 shares of Quebecor Media Inc. held by the Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec, for an aggregate purchase price of $1.0 billion, payable in cash.\n\nPurchase by Quebecor Inc. of 10,175,653 shares of Quebecor Media Inc. held by the Caisse, in consideration of the issuance by Quebecor Inc. of a $500 million aggregate principal amount of subordinated convertible debentures which are convertible into Quebecor Inc. Class B Subordinate Shares.\n\nThe parties have valued the Caisse’s 45.3% interest in Quebecor Media Inc. at $2.75 billion, pursuant to negotiations between them.\n\nUpon completion of the transaction, the Caisse’s interest in Quebecor Media Inc. will decrease from 45.3% to 24.6%, while that of Quebecor Inc. in Quebecor Media Inc. will increase from 54.7% to 75.4%.\n\nQuebecor Media: A key player in the Quebec economy\n\nQuebecor Media is today one of Quebec’s top five private employers. It has over 12,000 employees in Quebec and an annual payroll in excess of $600 million. At Videotron specifically, more than 4,450 jobs were created in leading-edge sectors since the acquisition, in addition to some 2,500 jobs with the outsourcers and consultants who work directly for the company.\n\nVideotron also invested more than $1 billion in developing a wireless telephone infrastructure, which increased competitiveness and lowered prices in this sector. This is in addition to the substantial improvement in Videotron’s customer service, increase in the supply of information resulting from the launch of several newspapers, the promotion of Quebec’s television and musical heritage, and an annual philanthropic contribution of close to $30 million benefiting approximately 400 organizations.\n\nForward-Looking Statements\n\nThe statements in this press release that are not historical facts are forward looking statements and are subject to significant known and unknown risks, uncertainties and assumptions which could cause Quebecor’s actual results for future periods to differ materially from those set forth in the forward looking statements.
