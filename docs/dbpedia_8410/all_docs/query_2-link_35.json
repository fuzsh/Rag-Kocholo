        "text": "BUCKINGHAM, Quebec — With his media holdings and celebrity, Pierre Karl Péladeau is a combination of Rupert Murdoch and Silvio Berlusconi, so his decision to run as a candidate in Quebec’s legislative elections has drastically altered the campaign. But the commotion he has caused was not what his party, the Parti Québécois, had hoped for when it introduced Mr. Péladeau as its star candidate last month.\n\nDuring the 18 months it has held power, the Parti Québécois routinely dismissed suggestions that it wanted to move swiftly to hold a third referendum on whether the mostly French-speaking province of Quebec should leave Canada. The party has tried to play down the option of separation, mindful that a majority of Quebec’s voters oppose independence, according to numerous polls going back several years.\n\nBut with one fiery declaration, Mr. Péladeau appears to have all but demolished his party’s hopes for victory in Monday’s snap election.\n\n“Today, we have the tools to take control of our own destiny,” he told a crowd last month in his first speech in the Montreal suburb he is campaigning to represent. “My devotion to the Parti Québécois is a devotion based on my most intimate values — that is to say: making Quebec a country.” His raised fist provided an exclamation mark."
