In her interview, Snyder referred to the mediation process as being “a real challenge,” and said she and Péladeau were trying to protect their three young children in the process.\n\n“I hope we will be a good model,” Snyder said.\n\nShe also revealed political life had taken a toll on their family life. She was so stressed during the leadership race she started smoking again.\n\n“Politics is violent,” Snyder said.\n\nBut she also said the day Péladeau asked her to marry him was the “most beautiful day of her life.”\n\n“We wanted to rebuild our family nest, our team,” she said. “We worked a long time on couple’s therapy. My references, my horizons, my country, was Pierre Karl. It’s clear it was everything I had hoped for.”\n\nAides would not say if Snyder’s appearance on the show was directly related to the surprise resignation.\n\nBut late Monday, sources confirmed a child custody battle between Péladeau and Snyder had emerged in the mediation process which explains Péladeau’s statement about having “no alternative,” but to leave politics for the good of the children.\n\nAdvertisement 4\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nThe couple have three children, Romy, 7, and Thomas, 10. Péladeau has a 16-year-old daughter, Marie, from a previous marriage.\n\nThe eighth leader in the PQ’s 40-year history — and the fifth in 15 years — the millionaire media mogul Péladeau leaves the job just short of a year at the helm. In all, he was there for 50 weeks.\n\nRecommended from Editorial\n\nPKP's announcement he is quitting politics sends shockwaves throughout Quebec\n\nStuck in the Middle avec moi: I have even more respect for Julie Snyder after Tout le monde en parle\n\nFive quotes from Pierre Karl Péladeau's resignation speech\n\nTimeline of memorable moments in PKP's political career\n\nAfter a staid leadership race in which it was clear Péladeau — a rare high-profile sovereignist businessman — was an unstoppable force, he was declared the winner May 15, 2015, with 57.58 per cent of the vote.\n\nHis departure means the already struggling PQ — polling at about 26 per cent and with the second opposition party, the Coalition Avenir Québec, nipping at its heels with 25 per cent — is again without a leader.\n\nThe party caucus is to meet Friday in Quebec City and select an interim leader. Taschereau MNA Agnès Maltais is a possible choice as is Jonquière MNA Sylvain Gaudreault.\n\nAdvertisement 5\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nThat person has the daunting task of leading the official opposition in the National Assembly until the session ends in June. Recessed this week, the house resumes sitting Tuesday.\n\nAnd with less than two years to the 2018 election, the party will be distracted and further torn by a leadership race.\n\nWithin moments of his departure, social media was abuzz about possible successors. The names of the candidates in the last race, Rosemont MNA Jean-François Lisée, initially one of Péladeau’s harshest critics, Marie-Victorin MNA Bernard Drainville, the father of the ill-fated charter of values, and Vachon MNA Martine Ouellet, who represents the party’s left wing, started floating.\n\nOne to watch is Lac-Saint-Jean MNA Alexandre Cloutier, who placed second in the 2015 race with about 30 per cent of the vote. If Justin Trudeau incarnated a new generation in the federal Liberals, Cloutier has the same qualities going for him in the PQ.\n\nAnother rising star is the high profile MNA for Joliette, Véronique Hivon, who made a name for herself handling the thorny assisted-death issue. As for possible outsiders, former PQ MNA Jean-Martin Aussant, a protégé of Jacques Parizeau, is a possible candidate.\n\nAdvertisement 6\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nIn the meantime, Péladeau’s short tenure as leader will be dissected again and again starting with the fact that as a businessman he struggled to adapt to public life.\n\nUsed to getting his own way and known for his short temper, he complained about reporters asking him a lot of questions and daring to call him on his mobile phone.\n\nHis speaking style was awkward and his lack of knowledge about the PQ’s history very evident. He slipped up numerous times. Just before Christmas, he candidly admitted he had a lot to learn (les croûtes à manger) about being a political leader.\n\nAfter his spectacular arrival on the political scene, which included the now celebrated fist pump for a country, getting to the promised land proved to be more complicated than he imagined.\n\nThere was a caucus to manage with many feathers to unruffle. In a particularly low period in October 2015, party stalwart, Stéphane Bédard, the MNA for Chicoutimi, resigned after being demoted from his house leader’s job.\n\nPéladeau promised to create a new sovereignty think tank to prepare the way for a future referendum but ended up having to chip in his own money to get it off the ground.\n\nAdvertisement 7\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nHe chose to retain controlling ownership of the Québecor media empire, which left him open to attacks from the other parties.\n\nA promise to put the shares into a blind trust never happened because Péladeau refused to entertain the possibility of someone selling the family holdings left to him by his father Pierre Péladeau.\n\nHe wound up putting the shares in an arm’s length management company, something the Liberals and CAQ said fell short of a real blind trust because the management company was told it was not allowed to sell the shares.\n\nAnd despite the PQ’s hopes for a so-called, “Péladeau effect,” sovereignty continued to languish in public opinion under his watch. In fact, the idea is less popular today than it was the day he took over the PQ.\n\nOn the other hand, Péladeau was hugely popular with the party’s rank-and-file and had a good two years ahead to continue improving himself.\n\nIndeed, over the last three months, he seemed to be coming into his comfort zone as leader suggesting he would peak in time for the 2018 election.\n\nBut there is one more consequence, the biggest, in connection with his departure. The Quebec Liberals lose their best political foil in the form of Péladeau’s hardline sovereignty stance.\n\nThe “scary Péladeau” factor ensured support for the Liberals remained strong. His participation in the 2014 election campaign was considered a turning point, which helped bring down former leader Pauline Marois’s minority government.\n\nMore recently, pollsters pointed to the Péladeau factor as one reason for the “resilience,” of Premier Philippe Couillard’s government despite a series of gaffes and missteps including the arrest of former deputy premier Nathalie Normandeau.\n\npauthier@montrealgazette.com\n\nTwitter.com/philipauthier\n\nArticle content\n\nShare this article in your social network"
