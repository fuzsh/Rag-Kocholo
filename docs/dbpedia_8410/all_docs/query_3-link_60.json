        "text": "MONTREAL, Sept. 29 /CNW Telbec/ - The 13th edition of the Québec Entrepreneurship Contest was launched today in Montréal in the presence of its numerous partners and its new Honorary President, Pierre Karl Péladeau, President and Chief Executive Officer of Quebecor.\n\nThis born entrepreneur has enthusiastically agreed to serve as the Honorary President of the 13th Québec Entrepreneurship Contest since it is, in his own words, \"essential for our society to invest in the business people of the future because in this way we help to build the Québec of tomorrow.\" Founded in 1950 by Pierre Péladeau, Quebecor has become one of the largest media conglomerates in Canada. A beacon in the Québec economy, the company is active in telecommunications, broadcasting, interactive media and newspaper, magazine and book publishing, as well as in the production, distribution and retailing of a broad array of products.\n\nThe provincial organization of the Québec Entrepreneurship Contest is proud that it can count on the participation of Mr. Pierre Karl Péladeau. As the President and Director General of the Contest, Natacha Jean, pointed out, \"We are delighted to have Mr. Péladeau serve as Honorary President of the 13th Québec Entrepreneurship Contest because throughout his career he has shown determination, creativity and audacity—qualities that our participants bring to the Contest!\"\n\nDesjardins Group, presenting partner for the 13th edition\n\nSupported by numerous invaluable partners, the Québec Entrepreneurship Contest is happy to announce that the Desjardins Group is joining forces with it and is acting as the presenting partner for the 13th edition of the Contest. This is a winning combination since both organizations share a common vision. \"Together we must foster the development of a stronger entrepreneurial culture. The Contest is working to pave the way for a new generation of Québec entrepreneurs who possess crucial values in this area. Thanks to the Contest, young people begin to develop these values as soon as they start school, and this is a very promising path,\" said Monique F. Leroux, Chair of the Board and President and Executive Officer of the Desjardins Group.\n\nThe Québec Entrepreneurship Contest can also count on the support of many other financial partners, including the Québec government, through the Youth Entrepreneurship Challenge, a component of the 2009-2014 Youth Action Strategy. We would also like to stress the valuable contributions of the Ministère du Développement économique, de l'Innovation et de l'Exportation and of the Ministère de l'Éducation, du Loisir et du Sport. \"For over 10 years, thousands of inspired and motivated young people have been submitting projects to the Québec Entrepreneurship Contest. Once again this year, my government is very proud to be associated with the Contest through the Youth Entrepreneurship Challenge. Ensuring that there are enough qualified young people to carry on business in Québec will be a major challenge for the province's economy in the years ahead. This is a challenge that we must take up right now, along with the Québec Entrepreneurship Contest, helping it fulfill its mission with our young people,\" declared Premier Jean Charest.\n\nARGENT, a member of the TVA group, is onboard again as a Media partner. The 13th edition of the Contest is also supported by Prestige partners Rogers and Service Canada. We could also name over 30 other organizations that have taken a strong interest in the development of a new entrepreneurial base and are supporting the Contest again this year.\n\nOver $500 000 in cash prizes!\n\nThe deadline for submitting projects is Monday, March 14, 2011, at 4 p.m. The eligibility criteria, along with the list of categories and special prizes, are now available at the following Web site: www.concours-entrepreneur.org. Winners from Québec's 17 regions will share over $500 000 in cash prizes, which will be awarded at the Provincial Grand Prize Gala Ceremony to be held in Québec City on Thursday, June 16, 2011.\n\nOver 75 000 people are expected to take part in the 13th edition of the largest contest of its kind. Last year alone, the new companies taking part in the Contest created 2 344 jobs.\n\nThe Québec Entrepreneurship Contest supports the development of entrepreneurship throughout Québec by rewarding concrete initiatives. The Student Entrepreneurship division encourages the creation of projects that contribute to the development of entrepreneurial qualities in the schools, from elementary school through university. The Business Creation division encourages entrepreneurs who are in the process of starting up a business. In the past 12 years, over one million people have submitted in excess of 56 000 projects.\n\nFor further information:"
