He hopes that Quebecers, suitably reminded by Ottawa of the Clarity Act’s stringent provisions, would “think about the issues and vote accordingly” — i.e., not for the Parti Québécois.\n\nAdvertisement 3\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nI guess that might work. But I sure wouldn’t bet on it. I’d be more inclined to bet on it backfiring.\n\nRead more from Chris Selley …\n\n[/np_storybar]\n\nSince 2000, he has donated three times to Jean Charest’s Liberals, once to the anti-referendum ADQ and only once to the separatist Parti Québécois. But as he hit midlife, his political opinions seem to have crystallized.\n\nMichel Nadeau, the former chief investment officer at the Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec who helped Mr. Péladeau orchestrate the purchase of Videotron, was struck by a speech Mr. Péladeau delivered the night of his surprise 50th birthday party in October, 2011. Having been lured out on the premise of seeing his daughter’s dance recital, a casually clad Mr. Péladeau walked into an east-end nightclub packed with friends and family. Unfazed, he spoke at length and off the cuff that night, thanking those who helped him along the way and making an impassioned pitch for Quebec achievement. “I was a bit surprised by the nationalist tone of the speech,” Mr. Nadeau, a longtime family friend, recalled this week.\n\nArticle content\n\nAdvertisement 4\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nIt was just a taste of what was to come. Last Sunday, following months of rumours, Mr. Péladeau announced his PQ candidacy, pumping a fist in the air and saying the desire to make Quebec a country was part of his “most intimate and profound values.” The PQ is hoping Mr. Péladeau’s commitment to Quebec will translate into a majority victory in the April 7 election and provide the momentum to push the province toward a third referendum on independence. They are banking on an unlikely separatist hero.\n\nIn a sense, Mr. Péladeau’s political path was blazed by his father, the late Quebecor founder Pierre Péladeau, who made no secret of his separatist sympathies. But Pierre Karl had a troubled relationship with his father, marked more by rebellion than a desire to emulate. Bernard Bujold, who worked as Mr. Péladeau, Sr.’s executive assistant from 1991 until his death in 1997, said the father favoured Pierre Karl over his eldest son, Erik, but he never let on. “He was admiring Pierre Karl, but he never told him so,” said Mr. Bujold, who wrote a biography of Pierre Péladeau. “The two barely spoke. They were not close.”\n\nAdvertisement 5\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nPierre Karl — who did not make himself available for an interview — was 15 when his mother, suffering from depression, took her life. He was sent to live with family friends, whose stable household, in the words of his former spouse Julie Snyder, saved his life. “Pierre Karl was perhaps born with a silver spoon in his mouth, but there was no one to hold it,” she told L’actualité in 2010. In his student days, he flirted with communism, changing the spelling of his second name from Carl to Karl in an apparent bow to Karl Marx. He enrolled in philosophy at the more leftist Université du Québec à Montréal, then headed to Paris for graduate studies. But he returned to Montreal a capitalist, having abandoned philosophy for law, and in 1985 he joined his father’s company.\n\nWhile he eventually made it to the top following his father’s death, it was not an easy climb. After taking a hard line against Journal de Montréal pressmen in 1993 and overseeing a lengthy lockout, Mr. Péladeau was undercut by his father, who decided the dispute had gone on too long and settled on terms favourable to the union. Pierre Karl was exiled to Paris soon afterward to take charge of Quebecor’s non-existent European printing operations. There he displayed a knack for deal-making and in the space of four years built annual revenues to $800-million.\n\nAdvertisement 6\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nHe was in Europe when his father suffered a heart attack and fell into a coma in December, 1997. He rushed home to be at his father’s hospital bedside, playing him recordings of his favourite composer, Beethoven, and reading him articles from the Financial Times. But Mr. Péladeau, Sr. never emerged from the coma and died on Christmas Eve. Fifteen months later, Pierre Karl would take over as CEO.\n\nMr. Bujold said Pierre Péladeau’s support for sovereignty was inspired by his experience as a young businessman experiencing bigotry in English Canada. “The father hated anglophone people because he felt he was humiliated when he was young,” he said. But Mr. Péladeau is of a different generation. “For Pierre Karl, it’s not the same thing,” Mr. Nadeau said. Far from bristling at insults from English Canada, Mr. Péladeau has helped promote what some separatists call Quebec-bashing by creating the conservative Sun News Network. “Pierre Karl is very comfortable with Sun News editorial policy,” Mr. Nadeau said. “I told him, ‘Look Pierre Karl, what your guys in Toronto are writing about Quebec is disgusting.’ He said, ‘Michel, they are looking for results, and they have to do what they want to do.’ ”\n\nAdvertisement 7\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nMr. Péladeau’s tactics as CEO, a position from which he stepped down last year, earned him sharp criticism at the time from some of his new sovereigntist bedfellows. Those in the PQ who decried his penchant for locking out employees — epitomized by a two-year lockout of the Journal de Montréal newsroom that ended in 2011 — are now biting their tongues and hailing his entry into the widening sovereigntist coalition.\n\nIf they are prepared to put up with the man considered an enemy of PQ-friendly unions, it is because they think his stature as a pillar of Quebec Inc. could give the sovereignty movement the push it needs. “It is the first time since René Lévesque that someone represents enough strength, character and charisma to get there,” said filmmaker Claude Fournier, a friend of the Péladeau family who says Pierre Karl is like a son to him.\n\nHe said Mr. Péladeau, whose tantrums were the stuff of legend, has matured. “Five years ago, if he could settle something with a fight or without fighting, he would settle it with a fight. He was very combative,” he said. “He has changed a lot. He is much more flexible. He has not softened, but he is better at judging situations and avoids reacting abruptly to situations.”\n\nAdvertisement 8\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nBut others question how he will make the transition to politics. Michael Fortier, the former federal Conservative senator and cabinet minister, is a friend of Mr. Péladeau dating back some 20 years. He hails Mr. Péladeau’s business achievements. “Just because we’re on different ends of the ice here on the topic [of sovereignty] doesn’t mean I can’t recognize that he has accomplished quite a lot as a businessman over the past 15 years,” Mr. Fortier said. “I think Quebecor Media as an asset has been operated brilliantly.”\n\nHe was aware of Mr. Péladeau’s sovereigntist leanings but never thought he would enter active politics. “It’s a tough business. You need to have thick skin. I’m not sure he does,” he said. “He’s adapted in the past, but this is the mother of all adaptations, to be honest. You’re working with all sorts of people that have all sorts of backgrounds that you don’t know, that have been around the party longer than you, that may know the leader more than you, that will not have the same skill set that you do. And he’s a man in a hurry. He’s solution-driven, and he doesn’t suffer fools easily.”\n\nAdvertisement 9\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nHis patience was surely tried this week as he was reduced to a prop for PQ leader Pauline Marois, who at a news conference Thursday regularly jumped in to answer questions addressed to Mr. Péladeau. At one point, she even gently pushed him aside so she could take the microphone. Mr. Péladeau’s declaration of sovereigntist faith Sunday was partly aimed at comforting the PQ legions who look on successful businesspeople with suspicion, but it has placed the campaign focus on independence, something Ms. Marois wanted to avoid.\n\nMr. Péladeau’s arrival has also raised awkward questions about how someone who will remain the controlling shareholder of the province’s largest media corporation would avoid conflict of interest if appointed to cabinet. Jean-Philippe Décarie, a business columnist at La Presse who worked under Mr. Péladeau as editor-in chief at the Journal de Montréal, said Mr. Péladeau was notorious for intervening to shape coverage in the newspaper. In 2008, when he had returned to writing columns, he said he was called into the editor’s office and told, “Pierre Karl is not happy. Your columns are not sufficiently to the right.” He believes Mr. Péladeau’s arrival in government would have a chilling effect in Quebecor newsrooms. “Journalists will do their jobs professionally. It’s the management where a lot of behaviour is internalized now,” Mr. Décarie said. “They know he is still the owner, and he’s going to come back. Watch out when he’s back.”\n\nAdvertisement 10\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=wOtQlP5cvNc\n\nMr. Bujold does not see Mr. Péladeau leading Quebec recklessly into a referendum. “The way of Pierre Karl is playing to win, but he will not bet the house,” he said, adding that he does not share his father’s romantic streak. The sovereignty cause is “just a vehicle to get where he wants to go,” he said. “He wants to be the Premier of Quebec, and it just makes sense, as it makes sense to use Videotron to develop a business.”\n\nEven a committed sovereigntist like Mr. Fournier does not expect Mr. Péladeau to work miracles. “Honestly, I have to say, I don’t think I’ll see it before I die,” the 82-year-old said.\n\n“Pierre Karl is not crazy or impulsive,” he said, suggesting he would be content to negotiate a new arrangement for Quebec within Canada. “He is not an extremist on this question. He is also a businessman. I think he is someone who will try to find a compromise that works without breaking everything all around,” Mr. Fournier said.\n\nNational Post\n\n• Email: ghamilton@nationalpost.com | Twitter: grayhamilton\n\nOur website is the place for the latest breaking news, exclusive scoops, longreads and provocative commentary.
