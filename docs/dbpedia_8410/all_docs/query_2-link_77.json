        "text": "Article content\n\nMONTREAL – Officially, former Parti Québécois leader Pierre Karl Péladeau has left politics and is back running Quebecor Inc., the media and telecom empire founded by his father.\n\nBut from his star turn at a PQ policy meeting last month to his trip to Barcelona last weekend to cheer on separatists in the Catalan referendum, there are growing signs that the Quebecor CEO just can’t shake the political bug.\n\nAdvertisement 2\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nTHIS CONTENT IS RESERVED FOR SUBSCRIBERS\n\nEnjoy the latest local, national and international news.\n\nExclusive articles by Conrad Black, Barbara Kay and others.

The resignation came the day after Snyder’s previous Tout le monde en parle interview, in which she had lamented their breakup and spoke of the strain politics put on their family life.\n\n“I was surprised because I never asked for or wished for Pierre Karl’s resignation,” Snyder said Sunday. “I always supported him, regardless of our personal life, and if I had not believed in him, I would not have followed him and given up my career to support him.”\n\nShe said during her time with Péladeau she saw how hard politics could be and suggested his resignation – two years after he was elected to the Quebec legislature – was not the first time he had considered quitting.\n\nArticle content\n\nAdvertisement 3\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\n“It is really the art of compromise,” Snyder said of politics. “When we were together and there were questions at home for him to stay or leave politics, I always encouraged him to persevere in spite of it all.”\n\nIn a post to his Facebook page Monday evening, Péladeau said he would have preferred not to publicly comment on the breakup. “My first preoccupation, as a father, has always been to protect my children despite this difficult situation. … However, following certain recent statements by Ms. Snyder, I wish to clarify the following,” he wrote.\n\nHe went on to say that he had felt privileged to be elected to the National Assembly and chosen PQ leader and that he had planned “to defend the interests of Quebecers and make Quebec a country.” But Snyder’s actions regarding custody of their two children forced him to step down.\n\n“To feign surprise or claim otherwise with the goal of changing the facts that triggered my resignation is misleading,” he wrote.\n\nThe public foray does nothing to clarify the fuzzy line between Péladeau’s roles as corporate chief and separatist statesman. In September, he made an unannounced appearance at the PQ’s policy convention in Montreal. With his new girlfriend, the actor Lucie Laurier, at his side, he was mobbed by star-struck PQ members as he made his way to the stage to greet his successor as leader, Jean-François Lisée.\n\nAdvertisement 4\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nAsked whether he planned a return to politics, Péladeau replied, “God only knows.” He specified that such a return would not be in the short term, because “the reasons that led me to leave remain today.”\n\nRecommended from Editorial\n\nPéladeau ex Julie Snyder seeks court order to reveal who hired man caught spying on her\n\nPierre Karl Péladeau says he's quitting politics for his children — less than a year after he was elected PQ leader\n\nLast weekend, Péladeau was tweeting from Barcelona, throwing his support behind the Yes side in the Catalonian independence referendum. He posted selfies, photos of people lining up to vote and one picture of a girl sleeping in her mother’s arms with the message, “To this young girl, I wish her a country.”\n\nBefore flying to Spain, he posted to his Facebook page a video shot outside Quebecor’s head office in Montreal. Identified as the company’s president and CEO, he criticizes Justin Trudeau’s Liberal government for refusing to tax Netflix.\n\n“If the federal government persists in not wanting to tax Netflix, we will find ourselves in the same place the (Stephen) Harper government left us,” he said. “It’s ironic to note that we subsidize companies like Netflix, whose market capitalization is more than $80-billion, when it is Quebec businesses that invest massively in our cultural industry.”\n\nThe argument can certainly be seen as defending the interests of Quebecor, which through its Groupe TVA subsidiary spends heavily on cultural productions. But when the man making the argument is the once and perhaps future separatist leader, the economic argument sounds a lot more political.\n\n• Email: ghamilton@nationalpost.com | Twitter: grayhamilton\n\nOur website is the place for the latest breaking news, exclusive scoops, longreads and provocative commentary.
