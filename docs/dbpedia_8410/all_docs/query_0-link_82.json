        "text": "I am two cheques away from the end of my severance package and I am about to embark on a path of my own design. I wake every morning and immediately need to calm an anxiety that is bubbling just below the surface. At the risk of sounding trite, my breath is my sanctuary.\n\nWhen I chose to leave the Vancouver Sun and a 28-year career in journalism, I knew I was stepping into an unknown. I've never feared change. In fact, it's been my greatest teacher and I have learned many lessons by charging into moments of uncertainty.\n\nBut this is different. This if life-changing. On a daily basis, I walk an edge that will determine my destiny. That means burying the doubt and challenging myself to piece together the skills I need to establish a new path. When I feel overwhelmed, I pause and draw on the experiences that helped me get to where I am.\n\nWhen I started 24 hours Vancouver in 2005, I sat at the end of a long table at a press conference in a downtown hotel. Jim Pattison and Pierre Karl PÃ©ladeau were the main attractions and all the questions were directed their way. 24 hours Vancouver had just littered city streets with hundreds of brilliant orange newspaper boxes, breaking so many city bylaws in the process.\n\nMy stomach was in knots throughout the presser and I was relieved no questions came my way. I was plucked from the weekly Richmond News to be the founding editor-in-chief of the upstart free daily. This was the big show and I was untested. At the end of the presser, Jimmy took me aside and his only words were: \"All eyes are on you kid.\" I remember thinking \"wow, no pressure!\" As it turned out I trusted my instincts, relied on my experience and produced a free daily newspaper that was both compelling and relevant that connected with daily commuters. It soared to the top of the Newspaper Audience Databank and was heralded as the best free daily in Vancouver, ahead of Dose and Metro.\n\nAs I work on the next iteration of my career, my stomach is again in knots. But I have a deep belief in the value of what I am doing. In the next few weeks I will launch a site that will give people an opportunity to preserve their stories. I've been working for months on a simple system of storytelling that allows people to explore the defining moments of their life and capture them in a straightforward way. I believe in the power of stories to help make sense of our lives and I believe that should be accessible to everyone.\n\nChange is frightening but it also provides us with the greatest opportunity to rediscover ourselves. Win, lose or draw, there is a lot of life to be gleaned through the process. I have learned more about myself in the last four months than I have in the last four years. It's not without its daily dread, but the process is rejuvenating. And through it all I have again learned to trust my instincts and rely on my experience."
