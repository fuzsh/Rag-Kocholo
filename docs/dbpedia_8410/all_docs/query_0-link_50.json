        "text": "January 7, 2019\n\nPierre Karl Péladeau, President and CEO of Quebecor, is pleased to announce two head office appointments: Marc M. Tremblay becomes Chief Operating Officer of Quebecor while retaining his responsibilities as Chief Legal Officer and Corporate Secretary, and Hugues Simard, who was with Quebecor from 1998 to 2017, becomes Chief Financial Officer of Quebecor.\n\nThe changes at the top at Videotron have afforded us an opportunity to expand the role and increase the responsibilities of some long-time associates of Quebecor. Marc has demonstrated a thorough command of all corporate issues and will have, in his new duties, an even greater role in developing business and operational strategies. I am also very pleased to announce that Hugues Simard is rejoining us. Hugues has an impressive track record and is a proven leader. He will be a key player in the Corporation and will help guide us towards achievement of our financial and business objectives.\n\nMarc M. Tremblay | Chief Operating Officer, Chief Legal Officer and Corporate Secretary\n\nMarc M. Tremblay has been with Quebecor since 2007. He will now assist Pierre Karl Péladeau, President and CEO, in managing Quebecor’s operations and will continue to be involved in business development, in addition to his responsibilities as head of Legal Affairs, Public Affairs, Human Resources, Real Estate, Environmental Affairs and the Corporate Secretariat. Prior to joining Quebecor, Marc M. Tremblay practised law with Ogilvy Renault (now Norton Rose Fulbright Canada). He became a partner in 1990 and director of the employment and labour law group in 2006. Since 2017, he has been Chairman of the Board of the Fondation du CHUM.\n\nHugues Simard | Chief Financial Officer"
