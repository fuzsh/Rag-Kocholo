        "text": "Quebecor Inc. has abandoned its national newspaper ambitions as the company shifts its attention to its faster-growing television and wireless business. With the company’s announcement Monday that it struck a deal to sell its Sun Media English-language newspaper operations to Postmedia Network Canada Corp. for about $316 million in cash, Quebecor becomes a nearly pure-play telecommunications company with an estimated 97 per cent of its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization coming from the assets of its Videotron unit.\n\nIt also becomes decidedly more Quebec-centric, as the aspirations of previous management to create a continental media and printing powerhouse give way to a retreat into its home market.\n\n“This transaction represents a retrenchment,” said former Quebecor chief executive and chairman Charles Cavell, the architect of the company’s purchase of the Sun chain 15 years ago. “I am somewhat disappointed because I think that Quebecor having an English franchise was a good thing. That’s why it was done way back when. What’s changed, I can’t tell you.”\n\nQuebecor is taking a bath on the deal. The company paid nearly $1 billion to purchase the Sun chain in 1999 following a heated takeover battle with rival publisher Torstar Corp.\n\nQuebecor shares fell 1.6 per cent to $28.17 in trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange Monday. They’ve gained 16 per cent over the past 12 months.\n\n“Quebecor investors are looking at the telecommunication business as the reason they buy the stock,” said Desjardins Securities analyst Maher Yaghi. “There’s no reason left to hold (the newspapers.)” Postmedia will buy 175 newspapers and publications from Quebecor, including six major urban dailies. The deal also include the online Canoe portal in English.\n\nQuebecor chief executive Pierre Dion declared this summer that the media conglomerate is “ready, willing and able” to become Canada’s fourth national wireless player to challenge incumbents BCE Inc.,\n\nRogers Communications Inc. and Telus Corp. Armed with some key airwave spectrum licences outside Quebec, it is now seeking regulatory change on wholesale roaming prices before committing funds to a countrywide expansion.\n\nProceeds from the newspaper sale could be dedicated to that effort, which one analyst estimated will cost as much as $2 billion. The money could also be used to buy back pension fund Caisse de depot et placement du Quebec’s 24.6 per cent ownership position in Quebecor Media, which is up for discussion in 2016.\n\nQuebecor is the dominant media company in Quebec, controlling cable company Videotron as well as the TVA network, the biggest French language broadcaster in North America. In recent years, its newspaper division has contributed a decreasing percentage of the company’s bottom line, with 18 per cent of overall revenue and about seven per cent of operating income generated by the news media unit in 2013.\n\nManagement had acknowledged as recently as last month that the company was open to selling more newspaper assets after unloading a group of Quebec weeklies late last year to Transcontinental Inc. But it gave no hint a deal was imminent.\n\nThe deal “comes at a time when the Canadian newspaper business absolutely needs consolidation to remain viable and to compete with digital media,” Dion said in a statement. “Postmedia possesses extensive expertise and the ability and will to invest in these publications’ longterm development.” Analysts say wireless is among Quebecor’s greatest opportunities. Launched four years ago, the company’s wireless business now\n\nhas 550,000 individual and business subscribers and a roughly 13 per cent market share in Quebec. Desjardins Securities estimates the company will be able to win a 20 to 25 per cent share within two years as it steals business from rivals."
