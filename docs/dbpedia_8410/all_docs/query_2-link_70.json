        "text": "Article content\n\nIn the most recent issue of The Hockey News, the respected journal once again put together a list of 100 People of Power and Influence in Hockey. As is usually the case, there are some interesting names on the list, mostly towards the bottom of the rankings. But with all due respect to Carrie Underwood, Tyler Dellow and Lexi Peters, the most interesting name on the list is No. 58: Pierre Karl Peladeau.\n\nAdvertisement 2\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nTHIS CONTENT IS RESERVED FOR SUBSCRIBERS ONLY\n\nSubscribe now to read the latest news in your city and across Canada.\n\nExclusive articles by David Staples, Keith Gerein and others, Oilers news from Cult of Hockey, Ask EJ Anything features, the Noon News Roundup and Under the Dome newsletters.\n\nUnlimited online access to Edmonton Journal and 15 news sites with one account.\n\nEdmonton Journal ePaper, an electronic replica of the print edition to view on any device, share and comment on.\n\nDaily puzzles, including the New York Times Crossword.\n\nSupport local journalism.\n\nSUBSCRIBE TO UNLOCK MORE ARTICLES\n\nSubscribe now to read the latest news in your city and across Canada.\n\nExclusive articles by David Staples, Keith Gerein and others, Oilers news from Cult of Hockey, Ask EJ Anything features, the Noon News Roundup and Under the Dome newsletters.\n\nUnlimited online access to Edmonton Journal and 15 news sites with one account.\n\nEdmonton Journal ePaper, an electronic replica of the print edition to view on any device, share and comment on.\n\nDaily puzzles, including the New York Times Crossword.\n\nSupport local journalism.\n\nREGISTER / SIGN IN TO UNLOCK MORE ARTICLES\n\nCreate an account or sign in to continue with your reading experience.\n\nAccess articles from across Canada with one account.\n\nShare your thoughts and join the conversation in the comments.\n\nEnjoy additional articles per month.\n\nGet email updates from your favourite authors.\n\nSign In or Create an Account\n\nEmail Address\n\nor\n\nArticle content\n\nPeladeau is an interesting name for fans of the Oilers as well, although less so now that the team and the City of Edmonton appear to be on track with an arena deal that both team ownership and the city government find acceptable. Quebec has frequently been mentioned as a potential relocation destination for the Oilers should the arena deal fall through – including by team employee Bob Stauffer, who said this past summer, “You know what happened in Quebec City. … Now Quebec is going to build a fully publicly-funded arena and they’re begging to get a team back.” Commentary like that, along with meetings between Oilers’ brass and Quebec City officials, have made the city an unspoken but nevertheless implicit threat during arena negotiations.\n\nWe apologize, but this video has failed to load.\n\nTry refreshing your browser, or\n\ntap here to see other videos from our team.\n\nThe Man Who Would Certainly Keep Daryl Katz's Oilers Out of Quebec Back to video\n\nPeladeau, however, is the reason that a Daryl Katz-owned team will never relocate to Quebec. Here’s THN‘s writeup on him:\n\nIf the NHL returns to Quebec City, it will do so along Quebecor media mogul Peladeau, 56. He’s the man behind the deal for an NHL-sized arena in the provincial capital. Quebecor has TVA Sports to challenge RDS in the TV market and owns Sun Media, which includes top-selling papers in both Montreal and Quebec City. He has the attention of the hockey and political world.\n\nAn NHL team is a logical extension to Peladeau’s media empire. Regardless of location within Canada, few things sell newspapers and draw eyes to television sets like NHL hockey. An NHL team in Quebec City would give Peladeau’s television network a better chance at going head-to-head with RDS for francophone viewers, while also presumably drawing more eyes to his newspapers.\n\nAdvertisement 3\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nAnd while the synergy involved means that owning an NHL team makes sense for Peladeau, it also means that he could make life difficult for anyone else interested in bringing a team to Quebec City. It would be a brave man indeed who would attempt to circumvent the groundwork already laid by Peladeau for a team, and a braver man still who would attempt to launch a new club without the instant support of Quebecor, which has a near-stranglehold on the French-language media scene in Quebec.\n\nAdd those factors together, and it seems clear that any reborn version of the Nordiques will be owned by Peladeau. Even when arena negotiations were at their most heated, Quebec was never a particularly viable route for Daryl Katz to go – unless he wanted to get out from NHL ownership entirely. Yet, while Quebec City was always exceedingly unlikely to get the Oilers, Peladeau’s presence and desire make it highly likely that eventually some team will either expand or relocate to the provincial capital. Given the media support that Peladeau can muster, it also makes the survival of such a team much more likely.\n\nArticle content\n\nShare this article in your social network\n\nLatest National Stories"
