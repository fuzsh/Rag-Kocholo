        "text": "OTTAWA â€” Kory Teneycke, a Quebecor Media vice-president and main advocate behind the proposed Sun TV News Channel, has announced his resignation.\n\nHe will be replaced by Luc Lavoie, a former aide to Brian Mulroney.\n\nTeneycke, Prime Minister Stephen Harper's former director of communications, said Wednesday he decided to resign because it had become clear his involvement in Sun TV would only \"inflame\" the controversy over the channel, dubbed \"Fox News North\" by its critics.\n\n\"Part of leading a team is knowing when your presence is a detriment to its success, and while I am intensely passionate about this project, it has never been about a political crusade, and it's never been about me,\" Teneycke told reporters at a news conference on Parliament Hill.\n\nTeneycke said he offered his resignation to Quebecor on Tuesday, effective immediately.\n\nIn a news release, Quebecor Media, which owns the Sun brand, said Teneycke's role will be taken over by Lavoie, a veteran executive in the Quebecor empire of chief executive Pierre Karl Peladeau.\n\nOn Tuesday, the online advocacy group that launched a petition to \"Stop Fox News North\" asked Canadian law-enforcement authorities to launch a criminal investigation to determine the identity of the individuals responsible for adding \"fraudulent\" signatures to the group's online petition.\n\nThe issue gained widespread attention after Canadian author Margaret Atwood signed the petition, created by the U.S.-based group Avaaz.\n\nTeneycke didn't say if his departure was related to the Avaaz case."
