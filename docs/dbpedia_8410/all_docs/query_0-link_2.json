        "text": "Defunct Canadian newspaper chain\n\nSun Media Corporation was the owner of several tabloid and broadsheet newspapers in Canada and the 49% owner of the now defunct Sun News Network. It was a subsidiary of Quebecor Media.\n\nOn October 6, 2014, Quebecor Media announced the sale of the remaining English-language print assets of Sun Media to rival Postmedia. The sale included neither the Sun News Network, which subsequently closed when a buyer was not found, nor Quebecor's French-language papers Le Journal de Montréal and Le Journal de Québec.[1] The sale was approved by the federal Competition Bureau on March 25, 2015,[2][3] and closed on April 13.[4] Canoe Sun Media merged with Postmedia rather than being maintained as a separate division.[5]\n\nQuebecor had previously sold its community newspapers in Quebec to TC Transcontinental in June 2014, under a deal first announced in December 2013.[6]\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nSun Publishing was formed on February 4, 1978 through the amalgamation of Toronto Sun Holdings Ltd and Toronto Sun Publishing Ltd. The two companies had been formed in 1971 with the launch of the Toronto Sun by former staffers of the defunct Toronto Telegram. On February 14, 1978, the Edmonton Sun, the second member of what would become the Sun chain, was announced through a partnership of Sun Media and Edmonton Sun Publishing Ltd. The paper was launched on April 2, 1978. In 1981, the outstanding shares of Edmonton Sun Publishing Ltd were acquired by Sun Media. The company purchased the Calgary Albertan on July 31, 1980 for $1.3 million and relaunched it days later as the Calgary Sun, with the same format and appearance as its sister papers.\n\nIn 1979, it purchased the United Press International's Canadian subsidiary, the former British United Press. It ran the news agency for several years before selling it to Canadian Press in 1985.[7]\n\nIn 1983, 50% of Sun Media was acquired by Maclean-Hunter for $55 million. That same year, Sun Media, with Maclean-Hunter's backing, acquired the Houston Post for $100 million in an attempt to expand into the United States. It was sold for $150 million four years later. In 1987, Maclean-Hunter's Financial Post weekly was sold to Sun Media for $46 million and was relaunched as a daily tabloid financial newspaper the following year.[8] In 1988, Sun Media acquired the Ottawa Sunday Herald which it would relaunch as the daily Ottawa Sun.[9]\n\nIn 1994, Maclean-Hunter was purchased by Rogers Communications. Two years later, on October 4, 1996, the management of the Sun chain under the leadership of Paul Godfrey purchased Rogers' share of the Sun Publishing and renamed the company Sun Media. In 1998, the Financial Post was sold to Southam Inc. in exchange for the Hamilton Spectator, the Kitchener-Waterloo Record, the Guelph Mercury, and the Cambridge Reporter. Also in 1998, Sun Media was purchased by Quebecor and maintained as a wholly owned subsidiary of it. Godfrey had sought out Quebecor as a \"white knight\" in order to frustrate an attempted hostile takeover by the Sun's longtime rival, the Toronto Star. In 1999, Quebcor sold the four recently acquired southern Ontario newspapers to the owners of the Toronto Star and became part of its Metroland Media Group. Southam, owned by Conrad Black, would relaunch the Financial Post as the National Post. In 2007, Sun Media acquired and absorbed the Osprey Media chain of small English language newspapers mostly based in Ontario. In 2014, after years of cuts and restructuring, Quebecor sold its Sun Media division to Postmedia which, ironically, had former Sun Media CEO Paul Godfrey as its chief executive. The sale was completed in April 2015 and Sun Media was dissolved with its newspapers being absorbed by the Postmedia chain.\n\nSun Media publications\n\n[edit]\n\nSun newspapers\n\n[edit]\n\nCalgary Sun\n\nEdmonton Sun\n\nOttawa Sun\n\nToronto Sun\n\nWinnipeg Sun\n\nLe Journal newspapers\n\n[edit]\n\nLe Journal de Montréal\n\nLe Journal de Québec (Quebec City)\n\n24hrs newspapers\n\n[edit]\n\n24heures Montreal\n\n24hrs Toronto\n\n24hrs Vancouver\n\nLocal daily newspapers\n\n[edit]\n\nAlberta\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Daily Herald-Tribune - Grande Prairie\n\nFort McMurray Today - Fort McMurray\n\nManitoba\n\n[edit]\n\nPortage Daily Graphic - Portage la Prairie\n\nOntario\n\n[edit]\n\nBelleville Intelligencer - Belleville\n\nBrantford Expositor - Brantford\n\nChatham Daily News - Chatham\n\nCornwall Standard Freeholder - Cornwall\n\nKingston Whig Standard - Kingston\n\nLondon Free Press - London\n\nNiagara Falls Review - Niagara Falls\n\nNorth Bay Nugget - North Bay\n\nNorthumberland Today - Cobourg\n\nOrillia Packet and Times - Orillia\n\nOwen Sound Sun Times - Owen Sound\n\nPembroke Daily Observer - Pembroke\n\nPeterborough Examiner - Peterborough\n\nSarnia Observer - Sarnia\n\nSault Star - Sault Ste.
