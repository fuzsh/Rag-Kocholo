        "text": "In 2003, Quebec actor and writer Louis Morissette co-wrote a two-minute skit parodying Pierre Karl PÃ©ladeau. The skit, which aired on Radio-Canadaâs year-end send-up Ceci nâest pas un Bye Bye, portrayed the former Quebecor CEO as a money-grubbing cherub enticed by a fairyâs monetary and carnal charms to buy into a get-richer scheme involving Quebecor media properties. âWe take 14 nobodies, we have them sign a five-year contract, we donât pay them and we put their faces on the cover of all the magazines,â titters the fairy. âWe wonât call it propaganda, weâll call it convergence!â\n\nThe skit was an obvious dig at Star AcadÃ©mie, an American Idol-style show developed by PÃ©ladeauâs wife, Julie Snyder, and at Quebecorâs burgeoning convergence model, in which its content is spread throughout its myriad television and publishing titles. The fairy was a parody of Snyder, played with ditzy aplomb by Morissetteâs partner, VÃ©ronique Cloutier.\n\nWith no nudity, bad language and only one veiled sexual reference, the skit was tame by Quebec standards. Yet by making fun of PÃ©ladeau, then one of the biggest publishing names in the world, Morissette made himself a target of what critics of the media baron say are PÃ©ladeauâs long memory and thin skin. Morissetteâs gig as a host on a Quebecor show was summarily cancelled, even though heâd already signed a contract, and he says he was cut off from all Quebecor projects.\n\nâThe program director at Quebecor told me they didnât like that I made fun of the boss, that they were very shocked by the skit. I was fired because [PÃ©ladeau and Snyder] didnât like the sketch.â\n\nAs far as Morissetteâs career is concerned, the implications of those two minutes reverberate to this day. A producer as well as an actor, Morissette claims he was placed on Quebecorâs âblacklistâ and is regularly shunned from using Quebecor talent on his own productions. Quebecor-owned media titles, he says, either ignore or are harsh toward his work.\n\nQuebecor public affairs vice-president Martin Tremblay denies the existence of a blacklist at the company, and says the cancellation of Morissetteâs contract was a âbusiness decision.â\n\nAnd yet as critical as he is about Pierre Karl PÃ©ladeau and his wife, Morissette is keenly aware of their power in Quebec, where their cultural footprint is gargantuan. âItâs too late for me, but if I was managing someone today I would say, âThink very carefully about this. Is it really worth making a joke about them? Is it worth being boycotted?â No. Iâd tell them to shut up, go on their television shows, suck up to them, tell them how great they are. Get into the mould, because you donât have a choice. They are the No. 1 broadcaster, producer, distributor in the province.â\n\nMorissetteâs harsh critique and backward praise of Quebecor is hardly unique in Quebec. Outside the province, the Quebecor brand is best known for the struggling Sun chain of newspapers, beset by tumbling circulation and mass layoffs. Yet it is quite a different story at home, where Quebecor looms large over the province, dominating its television (and, increasingly, its cellular) airwaves, cable networks, newspapers, magazines, book publishing, distribution and music industries. Its Journal de MontrÃ©al newspaper has a weekly readership of two millionâequal to about a quarter of Quebecâs population. Le Journal does well because it consistently nails the zeitgeist of Quebec profond: defensively nationalist, excessively proud and self-consciously wary of political elites.\n\nAt the centre of it all is Pierre Karl PÃ©ladeau, who despite having stepped down as CEO of Quebecor in May is still its largest shareholder and chairman of its media and television branches. Fifty-one years old and ostensibly retired, the man known simply as PKP is arguably more powerful in Quebec than everâand just as restless. In April, Quebec Premier Pauline Marois announced his appointment as chairman of Hydro-QuÃ©bec, the provinceâs electrical utility and collective source of pride. He is doggedly pursuing an NHL franchise for Quebec City, which is just the kind of big-money, long-odds deal he is used to. He has been on a two-year, 14-stop speaking tour promoting entrepreneurialship throughout Quebecâand slaying the negative image people often have of him in the process, says Quebecorâs Tremblay.\n\nHe is Quebecâs (and perhaps Canadaâs) most celebrated enigma, a man of seemingly ungulfable contradictions who, many say, has remained purposefully ambiguous on Quebecâs national question to further his own business interests. He is a strong Quebec nationalistâeven a sovereignist, perhapsâwho launched Sun News, a Maple Leaf-draped cable news outfit that is âas Canadian as you are,â according to a promotional video. It begs the question: who is the real PKP, the man who wields an enormous amount of influence over both politics and culture in Quebec? Few really knowâand fewer still inside Quebec dare to ask.\n\nOdd things happen when you write about PÃ©ladeau and Quebecor. People in all sorts of industries in Quebecâmedia, telecom, book publishing, distribution and the likeâsimply wonât talk, even off the record. Anecdotes about PÃ©ladeauâs elbows-out management style are recounted only with the promise that they will be kept off the page. People worry PKP will figure out who talked and either shun or sue them.\n\nSylvain Lafrance, a former senior Radio-Canada executive who PÃ©ladeau sued for defamation in 2007, at first agreed to talk about his legal tussle with PKP. âPierre Karl and I donât hate each other as much as people think,â he told me. Five hours later, Lafranceâs assistant abruptly cancelled the interview.\n\nRepeated requests to interview the man himself are literally laughed off by a senior Quebecor VPâwho nonetheless invites me to his office to pour poison in my ear about a columnist who critiqued PÃ©ladeau in a non-Quebecor title, losing his column shortly thereafter. The columnist wouldnât talk; he has a book coming out, and worries it will be shunned by PÃ©ladeau and Quebecorâs formidable publicity machine. Another journalist at first agrees to tell about his or her firing after crossing PÃ©ladeau, but then begs off because of a book deal with a Quebecor-owned publisher.\n\nâPKPâs problem is that many people hate his methods and his publications, but they are completely dependent on him,â says Ãmilie Dubreuil, a journalist who worked at Le Journal de MontrÃ©al. âThat is the paradox.â (âNothing could be further from the truth,â says Quebecorâs Tremblay.)\n\nPerhaps PÃ©ladeau would rather let his company speak for itself. Even some of his harshest critics admire how he has transformed Quebecor from an old-world print-and-publishing concern to the model of multimedia convergence it is today, with 2012 sales in excess of $4 billion.\n\nHe inherited the company following the 1997 death of his father, Pierre PÃ©ladeauâa man with whom he had a fractious relationship. The younger son from Pierre PÃ©ladeauâs first marriage, Pierre Karl spent much of his formative years rebelling against his father. At 18, he moved out of the PÃ©ladeau mansion in the Laurentians to live with a Journal de MontrÃ©al columnist. âHe said he didnât want a goddamn cent from his from his father,â says Bernard Bujold, PÃ©ladeau pÃ¨reâs executive assistant from 1991 until the latterâs death. PÃ©ladeau entered the business end of the family fold in 1994, though their relations didnât improve. His father sent him away to Paris to head up Quebecorâs European properties.\n\nâI talked a lot with Pierre PÃ©ladeau about his son,â says Bujold, who wrote a book about his time with the father. âHe couldnât talk to Pierre Karl. They fought constantly. There was no dialogue, but he admired his sonâs ingenuity and his deal-making ability.â\n\nWhile he took his fatherâs 13th-floor office in Quebecorâs Rue St-Jacques headquarters in Montreal, PÃ©ladeau the son had a decidedly different outlook from PÃ©ladeau senior. Pierre made his fortune by owning both newspapers and the means to print them. His Journal de MontrÃ©al, founded in 1964, was (and remains) a blue collar tabloid bible, and Pierre PÃ©ladeau maintained his hardscrabble image even after he bought and customized his first Mercedes limousine.\n\nUntil 1994, according to Bujoldâs book Pierre PÃ©ladeau cet inconnu, Quebecorâs head offices had exactly one Internet connection, in his son Ãrikâs office, which he cobbled together with pieces bought at RadioShack. Ãrik, PÃ©ladeauâs oldest son, convinced his skeptical father in 1994 to invest $20 million to create Quebecor Multimedia.\n\nYet it was Pierre Karl, not Ãrik, who took over the company. Though he was a philosophy major in his university yearsâhe changed his name from âCarlâ to âKarlâ in homage to Karl MarxâPierre Karl was, at 36, eager to take over the reins of one of Quebecâs largest and most respected companies. Reticent at firstâÃrik, the mature and grounded eldest son, was then heir apparentâhis father warmed to the idea of Pierre Karl taking over after watching him negotiate Quebecorâs 1995 purchase of FinanciÃ¨re Jean Didier, a printing company, at a deep discount. But Pierre PÃ©ladeau never said anything about succession to Pierre Karl. In fact, says Bujold, the two hardly talked in the months before Pierreâs death in 1997.\n\nNonetheless, it was obvious who would take over once Pierre passed away. âÃrik didnât have the energy to be the next president of Quebecor even if he was the oldest son of the founder,â Bujold says. âHe is a nice guy but he didnât have the killer instinct. His young brother Pierre Karl had it all and even more.â\n\nAs one of his first cost-cutting measures, PÃ©ladeau closed the daycare in Quebecorâs Montreal head office. (Though he has since expressed remorse at the decision, it never reopened.) His sister Isabelle, then head of the companyâs magazine division, abruptly left the company soon after her brotherâs arrival.\n\nâPierre Karlâs secretary told me that when he got back from Paris in 1997 he didnât even know how to send an email. A few years later, he was the king of the Internet in Quebec,â says Bujold. He became as much through the canny purchase of the cable company Videotron in 2000. At the time, Videotron was beset by notoriously bad customer service and recalcitrant unions. With the public pension-fund manager Caisse de dÃ©pÃ´t et placement du QuÃ©bec, which invested some $3.2 billion in public funds, Quebecor acquired Videotron and the television network TVA for a $5.4-billion cash-and-share deal.\n\nWith these purchases, PKP replicated his fatherâs vertical integration model for the digital ageâthough with a hearty nod to Pierre PÃ©ladeauâs newsprint-stained legacy. Pierre Karl also bought up a raft of printing presses around the world to form Quebecor World, along with the Sun newspaper chain and a host of other newspaper and magazine titles in Quebec.\n\nAccording to former prime minister and 14-year veteran of Quebecorâs board of directors, Brian Mulroney, PÃ©ladeau saw a business opportunity in converging the disparate cultural outlets in Quebec. By virtue of being French-speaking, most Quebecers are unique in their cultural consumption. The bulk of the provinceâs television, radio, film and media content is either produced or translated in the province. Effectively, Quebecâs six million francophones are a captive audience.\n\nâIn 2000, I brought Pierre Karl to the Four Seasons in New York to have lunch with Bob Pittman, who was one of the founders of AOL, so they could talk about convergence. Pittman concluded that Pierre Karl had already figured out how Quebec is ideal for convergence because of the linguistic dimension,â Mulroney says. In 2010, PÃ©ladeau launched Videotronâs wireless network, shaking up a market long dominated by Bell and Rogers, which owns Macleanâs.\n\nBujold says PÃ©ladeauâs relentless focus on Quebec also stems in part from the failure of Quebecor World, which collapsed into bankruptcy protection in 2008 under a mountain of debt (it emerged out of bankruptcy the following year). The experience tempered PÃ©ladeauâs enthusiasm to go beyond Canadaâs borders, notes Bujold. âHe could have done what the Bronfmans did, to get out of Quebec andÂ play the international game, but he didnât. He seized the limit of his destiny and that thinkingÂ saved the businessâunlike the Bronfmans, who played too high and gambled too much on glamour and lost almost all,â says Bujold.\n\nToday, Quebecor owns 16 book publishing houses, as well as Archambault, one of the largest chains of French-language CD and bookstores; Select, one of Canadaâs largest music distributors; Messageries ADP, the largest distributor of French-language books in Quebec; and Messageries Dynamique, Quebecâs largest print media distributor. With its recent purchase of the magazine La Semaine, the company now owns seven of Quebecâs People-style glossy magazinesâthe machines that reflect and feed Quebecâs well-developed star systemâgiving it a virtual monopoly of Quebecâs supermarket checkout aisles.\n\nIn television, Morissetteâs satirical vision still rings true: Quebecor is home to two of the provinceâs most popular television shows, Star AcadÃ©mie and La Voix, a French version of the American TV singing competition The Voice. Both are produced by Julie Snyder.\n\nFor Quebecâs cultural arbiters, who frequently decry the lack of French-language music on Quebecâs airwaves, the success of Star AcadÃ©mie and La Voix has been vexing. Artists such as SÃ©bastien âBizâ FrÃ©chette of the rap group Loco Locass have complained of how the cast of handsome participants is dumbing down Quebec culture. Yet Star AcadÃ©mie and La Voix have played an undeniable role in the resurgence of French language music in Quebec. Show participants record songs, which invariably become hits on Quebec radio.\n\nSome artists, though, say Snyderâs production company, Productions J, often undercut the writers and performers. âThey told us what weâd get paid. We had to sign a waiver renouncing the unionâs rate,â said Rudy Caya, lead singer of the rock band Vilain Pingouin. âI was told, âIf you donât want to do it, weâll get someone else.â And if you are out of Quebecorâs good books it can hurt your career.â Vilain Pingouin appeared on Star AcadÃ©mie in 2009. FrÃ©chette joined the showâs coaching team in 2012.\n\nâNo one from our team ever said anything of the sort to Mr. Caya or to Vilain Pingouin,â said Productions J spokesperson Louis NoÃ«l, who stressed that Productions J was âindependent from Quebecor.â Yet in less than 24 hours, Quebecor vice-president Martin Tremblay knew of Macleanâs questions to Production J regarding Vilain Pingouin.\n\nEven Quebec cultural royalty doesnât feel immune from the power of PÃ©ladeau and Snyder, it seems. In 2011, actor and Parti QuÃ©bÃ©cois MNA Pierre Curzi opposed Bill 204, which prevented legal challenges to a contract between Quebecor Media and the city government for the arenaâa key part of PÃ©ladeauâs plan to attract an NHL hockey team to the city. Curzi opposed his partyâs âanti-democraticâ bill because the contract details were kept secret; he and two caucus colleagues resigned as a result.\n\nCurzi is also one of the most celebrated Quebec actors of his generation, having appeared in The Decline of the American Empire and The Barbarian Invasions, among many other films. Yet he says he raised PÃ©ladeauâs ire in opposing the Quebecor-friendly legislation, and believes he may have been cut off from Quebecor productions as a result. âWe arenât friends anymore,â Curzi says of PÃ©ladeau. âI opposed the deal, thatâs fine. I have no problems. But if I had to find work, it would have been complicated. Iâm not sure TVAâs going to hire me.â\n\nQuebecorâs Tremblay denied Curziâs allegations, and noted that Marie Tifo, Curziâs wife, currently stars in a TVA program.\n\nWondering whether or not Pierre Karl PÃ©ladeau is a sovereignist is practically a parlour game amongst Quebecâs chattering classes. Certainly, sovereignists hope heâs on their side, yet PÃ©ladeau himself has forever remained coy on the question, and a look at Quebecorâs business interests doesnât help the divining.\n\nIn 2008, Quebecor announced Projet ÃlÃ©phant, a project to restore, catalogue and broadcast old Quebec films. The typical business mind would probably balk at investing $14 million, according to Quebecor figures, on such a project. Quebec films have limited commercial appeal in other French-speaking societies and next to none anywhere else. âIt helped keep the collective memory of Quebec cinema alive,â says Curzi.\n\nâPierre Karl PÃ©ladeau never hid that heâs a sovereignist. His convictions are sovereignist . . . and then when he started the Sun News Network, everybody was like, âWhat the f--k? Is that just business?â â says Curzi.\n\nItâs hard to tell. When PÃ©ladeau bought the Sun chain of newspapers in 1998, he proclaimed it âa big day for Canada.â In 2011, PÃ©ladeau said the nascent Sun News Network would be an all-Canadian bulwark against the creeping influence of American television. Sun News is Canadaâs cable respite for staunch pro-Canadian right-wing populismâeverything that Quebec culture isnât, in other words. In some respects, the network and the Sun chain of newspapers mirror the same free-market principles and general disdain for the left as Quebecorâs French-language properties, like Le Journal de MontrÃ©al and the Le Canal Nouvelles cable channel.\n\nYet the editorial line of Quebecorâs French media properties is strongly Quebec nationalist, if not outright sovereignist. âThe PÃ©ladeaus have given columns to Bernard Landry and RenÃ© LÃ©vesque, [former PQ ministers] Lise Payette and Joseph Facal, [convicted FLQ kidnapper] Jacques LanctÃ´t and Gilles Duceppe. If you are an old sovereignist, we donât name you to the Senate, because we donât have one. Instead, you get a column in Le Journal de MontrÃ©al,â says the journalist Dubreuil.\n\nAccording to several former Quebec journalists, PÃ©ladeauâs Quebec nationalist side would notably show itself whenever it suited Quebecorâs business interests. In 2009, PÃ©ladeau was in a bidding war with the Molson family for the Canadiens hockey franchise. PÃ©ladeau ultimately lost out to the scions of the Canadian brewing giant, and an article published in Quebecorâs Journal de QuÃ©bec noted PÃ©ladeauâs âregretâ that Canadiens owner George Gillett âpreferred financial considerations, while [PÃ©ladeau] would have liked the Canadiens to be based on a QuÃ©bÃ©cois identity.â\n\nPÃ©ladeauâs dig at the Molson family seemingly played on an old Quebec stereotype: that like many wealthy English families, the Molsons are somehow less QuÃ©bÃ©cois than the French-speaking hoi polloi. According to two former Quebecor journalists who wish to remain anonymous, there was pressure to denounce the Fonds de solidaritÃ© FTQ capital fund, a partner (along with Bell) in the Molson deal to acquire the Canadiens. Interviewed separately, the journalists said there was similar pressure to, as one put it, âsay the Bell deal wasnât a Quebec deal but an Ontario deal,â as one put it. (Quebecorâs Tremblay says the allegation is âtotally false. Our newsrooms are completely independent and it is up to them to determine the editorial line.â)\n\nAntagonizing the Molson family may not help PÃ©ladeauâs bid for an NHL team in Quebec City, which he has been pursuing since his failed bid for the Canadiens. Canadiens owner Geoff Molson is one of 30 NHL governors, who along with commissioner Gary Bettman decide the where and when of league expansion. The deal may not make business sense for Canadiens management, as another Quebec-based team might cannibalize Montrealâs lucrative market, says NHL analyst John Shannon. âIt puts Geoff Molson in a tough position. How would a second team play in Quebec? Would they be taking Canadiens dollars?â\n\nIn terms of sheer animosity, however, few feuds top that between Quebecor and CBC/Radio-Canada. There is a natural rivalry between the public broadcaster and the television station TVA, which is more populist (and more popular). What became TVA was founded in the 1960s as a scrappy, less haughty alternative to the staid Radio-Canada, which until then had the near-monopoly on Quebecâs ears and eyeballs.\n\nWhen PÃ©ladeau and Quebecor acquired TVA in 2000, Le Devoir television critic Paul Cauchon says, âthe rivalry intensified.â Quebecor media properties have attacked the very legitimacy of the CBC, largely spearheaded in French by Journal de MontrÃ©al columnist Richard Martineau, who also hosts a show on LCN, Quebecorâs cable news channel. On Sun News Network, the CBC was a regular target of columnist and host Ezra Levantâs derision, both for its public subsidy and the networkâs purported leftist bias.\n\nPÃ©ladeau himself wrote 12 letters and a handwritten fax to CBC president Hubert Lacroix accusing the public broadcaster of refusing to advertise in Quebecor titles. The letters often included photocopied clippings of CBC advertisements from rival publications. âHeâs a micro-manager. He has his nose in everything,â says a former Quebecor journalist.\n\nQuebecor and the CBC have since buried the hatchet somewhat. Starting in March 2012, the two corporations have entered into a series of content-sharing agreements through which Radio-Canada programming would be offered on Quebecorâs various media outlets. Earlier this year, Quebecor and Radio-Canada announced they are teaming up to televise the World Cup and the Sochi Olympics in 2014.\n\nWhy would someone so obviously put off by the very existence of CBC/Radio-Canada enter into a deal with the public broadcaster? The official Quebecor explanation was that âQuebecor wants to offer the best programming at the best price to our cable customers,â according to Quebecor VP Martin Tremblay.\n\nIndeed, the deal may well appeal to PÃ©ladeauâs Cartesian side. After all, the CBC deal gives TVA access to French-language Radio-Canada Olympic programming, as well as the exclusive French broadcasting rights to Juneâs FIFA Confederations Cup in Brazil. It seems PÃ©ladeauâs noisy feud with CBC was just that: noise. At the end of the day, partnering with the countryâs public broadcaster simply made good business sense.\n\nCoincidentally or not, the Sun newspaper chainâs attacks on the CBC have become far less frequent since the content sharing deal. According to a database analysis of Quebecorâs English language titles, the chain published 19 âCBC money drainâ features in 2011 alone in its newspapers. Since the Quebecor/CBC deals in March 2012, it has published two.\n\nOn May 1, Premier Pauline Marois met with the leaders of Quebecâs three biggest unions in her Quebec City offices to mark International Workersâ Day. The foursome discussed public finances, natural resources and potential changes to the federal Employment Insurance program.\n\nThe otherwise humdrum meeting was significant because it was the first time in nine years that a Quebec premier met with union leaders to honour May Day. Under the previous Liberal government, the day often brought street protests. Maroisâs event was marked only by a cheery press release and a 25 cent increase of the minimum wage.\n\nMaroisâs political embrace of Quebecâs union movement, which historically supports the Parti QuÃ©bÃ©cois, was undercut by a small fact: two weeks before, the premier named Pierre Karl PÃ©ladeau chairman of Hydro-QuÃ©bec. Simply put, PÃ©ladeau and Quebecâs unions do not get along, and the resulting public pas de deux has spanned much of PÃ©ladeauâs career.\n\nThat the premier courts both PÃ©ladeau and the unions speaks to the often contradictory political paths of the modern-day Parti QuÃ©bÃ©cois. It also suggests that PÃ©ladeau has considerable influence within the sovereignist party.\n\nThe position of Hydro-QuÃ©bec chairman is part-time, ceremoniously powerful and typically filled by ex-politicians or apparatchiks with connections to the ruling party of the day. In announcing the appointment, Pauline Marois said PÃ©ladeau approached her with the idea to âserve the state,â as Marois put it, though Pierre Curzi wonders whether it was the other way around.\n\nâShe courts him because heâs a big media player, a big industrial player and a political player,â says the actor, who adds that Bill 204 allowed the PQ to both placate PÃ©ladeau and capitalize on the hockey-mad fervour in Quebec City, where the party is particularly weak.\n\nPÃ©ladeau is useful to the PQ for another reason, according to Curzi. The media tycoon is an ideal counterweight to the Desmarais family, the arch-federalist clan and controlling shareholder of Power Corp., which has close ties to the Quebec Liberal party and owns Le Journal rival La Presse. âThe Liberals are very tight with the Desmarais,â Curzi says. âItâs a clash between federalists and sovereignists playing out between two media corporations.â\n\nThe consequences of this clash were felt by the then-governing Liberals during last yearâs election. âEveryone noted how clear it was that the opinion of Quebecorâs owner was being expressed in Quebecor media properties,â said a senior Liberal campaign source.\n\nAs with most things PÃ©ladeau-related, his move to Hydro-QuÃ©bec prompted much speculation. Is it a result of post-retirement restlessness? Is it a stepping stone to political office? Is it, as one columnist suggested, part of his PR campaign? And will he use it as a bully pulpit to stealthily or otherwise shake up Hydro-QuÃ©becâs union-dominated structure as he did with Videotron?\n\nâI think he just wants to do other things,â says Brian Mulroney. âHe wants to lecture at universities. He wants to run the board of Hydro-QuÃ©bec. His own father wasnât a great father, and he wants to be one. And all you need to do is look at the information circular to figure out that the guy doesnât need any tag days. Heâs got $700 or $800 million in Quebecor stock.â (PÃ©ladeauâs stock was worth $684 million, according to the latest Quebecor filing.)\n\nThe 16-member Hydro-QuÃ©bec board over which PÃ©ladeau presides is almost entirely made up of Liberal appointees, including Michel Plessis-BÃ©lair, vice-chairman of Quebecor rival Power Corp. According to one board member who wished to remain anonymous, the divide between PÃ©ladeau and the board is the elephant in the roomââitâs been a bit like walking on eggshells,â the member saidâbut the meetings have been marked by PÃ©ladeauâs professionalism.\n\nâPierre Karl is aware of all the dossiers, including the negotiations with [Hydro-QuÃ©becâs] unions. He presides, he doesnât question decisions. He asks questions when he thinks something isnât clear, and does so in a very elegant manner. He has a lot of expertise, and we benefit from his presence,â the board member, a Charest appointee, said. Mulroney echoes the thought. âHeâll be a very good chairman, but he wonât be trying to usurp anybodyâs authority at the CEO level. Heâs not going in there with a bulldozer.â\n\nQuebecor, Quebecers might be surprised to hear, is a small player as far as Canadian companies go. Its market capitalizationâthe total value of its sharesâis $5.9 billion, or around one-eighth the size of Bellâs parent, BCE, its frequent sparring partner in matters related to hockey and cable. And yet the company has its fingerprints all over Quebecâand despite his recent retirement as Quebecor CEO, PÃ©ladeau has a firm grip on the company. There are dark spots: Quebecorâs news media revenue is down, its English newspaper titles are hemorrhaging money and staff, and Sun News Networkâs survival is questionable given the recent CRTC decision to not include the channel in Canadaâs basic cable packages.\n\nAs Mulroney points out, however, Quebecorâs French-language newspaper titles, particularly Le Journal de MontrÃ©al, are doing very well. Its cable, telephony and wireless propertiesâacquired and developed by PÃ©ladeau over the last 13 yearsâare âproducing the bulk of Quebecorâs profits,â says the former prime minister. Quebecor also commands much of Quebecâs cultural sphere, as Louis Morissette well knows. The actor has spent much of his career critiquing Quebecorâs ubiquity in all things star-related in Quebec, yet still finds himself in awe of PÃ©ladeauâs success. âThey [PÃ©ladeau and Snyder] are respected, and rightfully so,â he says. âThere are many artists who are very, very well served by Quebecor. Itâs an extremely efficient machine.â\n\nMorissette has tried a next-to-impossible feat in his daily life: avoiding Quebecor altogether. It hasnât gone well. He needs cable, for one, and only Videotron serves his neighbourhood. âAnd my powerâs gone out three times since PÃ©ladeau arrived at Hydro-QuÃ©bec,â he says.\n\nMorissette laughs. Heâs joking, he swears."
