        "text": "Quebecor has started the year by announcing two head office appointments and a new president and CEO of Videotron.\n\nJean-François Pruneau is the new head of Videotron, succeedingManon Brouillette, who announced in October she would step down at the end of the year for personal reasons after helming the company since Spring 2014. Pruneau has been with Quebecor since 2001, most recently as Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.\n\nQuebecor has also made two senior management appointments, naming Marc M. Tremblay as Chief Operating Office while retaining his responsibilities as Chief Legal Officer and Corporate Secretary. Hugues Simard, who was with Quebecor from 1998 to 2017, becomes Chief Financial Officer of Quebecor.\n\n“The changes at the top at Videotron have afforded us an opportunity to expand the role and increase the responsibilities of some long-time associates of Quebecor,” commented Pierre Karl Péladeau in a press release. “Marc has demonstrated a thorough command of all corporate issues and will have, in his new duties, an even greater role in developing business and operational strategies. I am also very pleased to announce that Hugues Simard is rejoining us. Hugues has an impressive track record and is a proven leader. He will be a key player in the Corporation and will help guide us towards achievement of our financial and business objectives.”\n\nTremblay has been with Quebecor since 2007. He’ll now assist Péladeau in managing Quebecor’s operations and will continue to be involved in business development, in addition to his responsibilities as head of Legal Affairs, Public Affairs, Human Resources, Real Estate, Environmental Affairs and the Corporate Secretariat. Prior to joining Quebecor, he practised law with Ogilvy Renault (now Norton Rose Fulbright Canada). He became a partner in 1990 and director of the employment and labour law group in 2006. Since 2017, he has been Chairman of the Board of the Fondation du CHUM.\n\nOver a period of nearly 20 years, Simard occupied a series of key positions with various Quebecor subsidiaries, including Senior Vice-President and Chief Financial Officer of Videotron from 2014 to 2017, Senior Vice-President, Development & Strategy of Quebecor Media, and Vice-President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer of Sun Media Corporation from 2007 to 2014. Until recently, he was Executive Vice-President and Chief Financial Officer of Indigo Books & Music in Toronto.\n\nSubscribe Now – Free!\n\nBroadcast Dialogue has been required reading in the Canadian broadcast media for 25 years.
