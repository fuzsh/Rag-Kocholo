        "text": "At an early age, Pierre Karl Péladeau developed an interest in business and in Quebecor, the company founded by his father in 1965. After entering the family business in 1985, he ran several of the company’s subsidiaries and oversaw a series of acquisitions that would play a decisive role in Quebecor’s future. In 1999, several years after his father passed away, he became President and CEO of Quebecor.\n\nIn 2000, Pierre Karl Péladeau steered the business in a new direction by acquiring Videotron and TVA Group, making Quebecor a major player in the new economy in Canada. In line with his longstanding commitment to preserving and promoting Québec culture, he launched Éléphant: The memory of Québec cinema in 2008, a major philanthropic project dedicated to digitizing, restoring and making accessible Québec’s cinematic heritage.\n\nIn 2013, Mr. Péladeau left the corporate world. He entered politics in the following year, running as the Parti Québécois candidate in Saint-Jérôme riding, and was elected to Québec’s National Assembly in April 2014. He became the party’s leader on May 15, 2015 and served as Leader of the Official Opposition in the National Assembly until May 2, 2016.\n\nReturning to the helm of Quebecor in February 2017, he has also been President of Videotron since last June, in addition to assuming on an interim basis the responsibilities of President of TVA Group.\n\nIn a personal capacity, Pierre Karl Péladeau serves as President of the Fondation Chopin-Péladeau, a private family foundation named after his parents, Raymonde Chopin and Pierre Péladeau. A firm believer in the vital importance of accelerating the Montréal taxi industry’s green shift to electric, he acquired Taxelco, a taxi company that includes Diamond Taxi, Taxi Hochelaga and Téo Taxi, in 2019.\n\nPierre Karl Péladeau has chaired numerous boards of directors, including LA LA LA Human Steps (1994-2004), the Fondation de l'entrepreneurship (2011-2014), and Hydro-Québec (2013-2014). He has also been a member of the board of directors of the Conseil du patronat du Québec (2007-2010) and the Fondation Lionel-Groulx (2012-2014). He received the Québec National Assembly’s Medal of Honour in 2005 and was named a Chevalier of the Ordre de la Pléiade in 2013.\n\nHugues Simard has been Chief Financial Officer of Quebecor since January 2019.\n\nOver a period of nearly 20 years, from 1998 to 2017, Hugues Simard occupied a series of key positions with various Quebecor subsidiaries, including Senior Vice-President and Chief Financial Officer of Videotron from 2014 to 2017, Senior Vice-President, Development & Strategy of Quebecor Media, and Vice-President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer of Sun Media Corporation from 2007 to 2014. His notable achievements include the creation of QMI Agency, an integrated news agency, in 2009 and the organization and implementation of QMI Sales, an integrated sales force for the entire Corporation, in 2007.\n\nBetween June 2017 and his return to Quebecor, Hugues Simard was Executive Vice-President and Chief Financial Officer of Indigo Books & Music Inc. in Toronto.\n\nHe holds an MBA from Harvard Business School and a Bachelor of Applied Science and Engineering degree from the University of Toronto.\n\nMartin Tremblay was appointed Chief Operating Officer of Quebecor Sports and Entertainment Group in August 2017. In that capacity, he is responsible for optimal development and coordination of the Group’s operations. Sports and Entertainment Group includes the Videotron Centre, Gestev, the Québec Remparts and the Blainville-Boisbriand Armada.\n\nAfter joining Quebecor in 2010, Martin Tremblay represented the Corporation in the design and construction of the new Québec City arena. From 2012 to 2017, he served as Vice President, Public Affairs of Quebecor. He previously worked for several years in the office of the Minister of the Environment, the office of the Minister of Municipal Affairs and other Québec government departments.\n\nMartin Tremblay holds a Bachelor’s degree in international relations from Université du Québec à Chicoutimi. He was a member of the board of governors of the Québec Major Junior Hockey League (QMJHL) from 2014 to 2017 and Vice-Chairman of the QMJHL Executive Committee during the last year of that period.\n\nLyne Robitaille is Senior Vice President, Newspapers, Books and Magazines and President and Publisher of Le Journal de Montréal. She is responsible for maximizing the reach of Quebecor’s newspaper brands and TVA Publications’s magazine brands. She also oversees Quebecor's Book Group, which includes the 18 publishing houses in the Librex, Homme and Ville-Marie littérature groups, and the educational publisher CEC Publishing.\n\nLyne Robitaille has occupied many management positions at Quebecor’s newspaper business since joining the organization in 1988, including Vice President, Finance; Operations Manager; President and Publisher; and Executive Vice President, Operations. She has spearheaded numerous strategic initiatives, including the digital shift at the Group’s newspapers, which has made them the media properties with the largest weekly readership in Québec across all platforms. Lyne Robitaille has been responsible for the Magazines segment since 2017 and for the Book Group since June 2021, after previously heading it from 2014 to 2017.\n\nLyne Robitaille graduated from HEC Montréal with a Bachelor’s degree in accounting in 1985. She is a member of the Ordre des comptables professionnels agréés du Québec (CPA, CA)."
