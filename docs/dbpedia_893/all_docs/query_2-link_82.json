        "text": "The new year begins with release shows from the likes of Injury Reserve, the Senators, the Lonesome Wilderness, Mr. Mudd and Mr. Gold, Murkocet, Seven Trill, Vintage Wednesday and BSLFE, to name a few. There's also a 10th anniversary celebration for the Maine, the fourth annual Phoenix Rock Lottery and the YabYum Music Awards competing for your local-music dollar. Here's a guide to help you plan your January 2017 in metro Phoenix.\n\n1/6: Mill’s End Birthday Bash and Cancer Benefit\n\nThis show doubles as a birthday celebration for Mill’s End’s guitar-playing vocalist Jeff Bump and lead guitarist Keith Perrillo, and a benefit for the F C Cancer Foundation, whose mission is to raise awareness and provide education about early cancer detection, ultimately putting an end to late-stage cancer diagnosis. Bump says, “Keith and I have the same birthday so we thought what better way to celebrate it than by playing a show for a great cause. It's also very personal to me because I lost my Mom last year from cancer.” If you’re not familiar with Mill’s End, their sound tends to favor the rowdier side of alternative-country. They’ll be joined by Marc Norman, the Bellwethers and the Hardways.\n\nDetails: 8 p.m. Friday, Jan. 6. Pho Cao, 7436 E McDowell Road. $10 donation. 480-947-2608, phocaoaz.com.\n\n1/6: Expos / Closet Goth release show\n\nThe Expos will release an eight-inch album. Yes, an eight-inch album. Like a seven-inch, but bigger. Aaron Ponzo says, “I made this 30-second song (‘South Mountain’) that I had nothing to do with really in August 2016 and then Colin (guitarist of the expos, Warped Your Records) wanted to make an Expos 8-inch after the success of 2016's WARPED YOUR FEST and I decided to make an album where no song goes over 30 seconds long! After 3 months in my room working on a bunch of different ideas I finally got 18 songs I like and sent them to Colin so they could be pressed! The album takes influences from classic rock artists like Thin Lizzy and Van Halen, pop bands like Dear Nora, Frankie Cosmos, and Alex G, and just other rock shredders like Weezer and Tony Molina!”\n\nCloset Goth says he was “going for a dance record in the least accessible way possible.” “I love dissonance,” he says. “So I went for a No Wave disco sound. This was the first Closet Goth record where I had people help me with recordings, with a few friends on vocals, drums and keys. This project started when I moved to Arizona and wanted to start fresh musically and separate myself from my Pennsylvania roots.”\n\nAlso playing: Diners and Doomed to Bloom.\n\nDetails: 7:30 p.m. Friday, Jan. 6. Trunk Space, 1124 N. Third St., Phoenix. $6. Thetrunkspace.com.\n\n1/7: Rhythm Room House Rent Party\n\nIt’s not really rent. It’s the annual property tax that’s coming due. But that takes money too so these artists have graciously come together for the cause. And it’s a killer lineup, featuring the Rocket 88’s, Dave Riley and Bob Corritore, the Mike Eldred Trio, Sugaray Rayford, Mikel & Meredith (of Sugar Thieves), Smokestack Lightning, George Bowman, JC & the Juke Rockers and more. The party also features three emcees: Jim Crawford, Janice Johnston and Drew Verbis.\n\nDetails: 7 p.m. Saturday, Jan. 7. Rhythm Room, 1019 E. Indian School Road, Phoenix. $10. 602-265-4842, rhythmroom.com.\n\n1/8: Elvis’ Birthday Celebration\n\nIt’s Elvis’ birthday. What more reason do you need to throw a party at the Rhythm Room? Come celebrate the King, without whom I’m not sure we’d still be covering rock culture in 2017, with Brea Burns, the Mike Eldred Trio, Slik 50, Mario Moreno, Laura Walsh, Jimmy Pines & Washboard Jere, Tommy Price of the Stilettos, Pat Roberts, Jerry Lawson of the Persuasions, DL Marble, Whiskey Kiss, Kevin Daly, Bob Corritore, Elgin MacMillan & Thurane, Kenny Love & the Rockafellas, Rooster Coup Deville, Brian Fahey and Che Nemeth. That’s a lot of talent on one bill. As Bob Corritore says, “Some of Phoenix's greatest musicians pay tribute to this great musical icon who influenced us all. And everyone will perform two or three Elvis songs.”\n\nDetails: 6 p.m. Sunday, Jan. 8. Rhythm Room, 1019 E. Indian School Road, Phoenix. $8. 602-265-4842, rhythmroom.com.\n\n1/13: The Senators EP release show\n\nThe Senators are releasing a four-song EP called “Coyotes” that should have no problem speaking to fans of their earlier work while allowing for growth and experimentation with new musical approaches. Front man Jesse Teer says, “When you listen, it’s clear this is a departure from what we’ve done in the past. But, to me, it draws a pretty clear line from where we started to where we are now.” Since their previous release, he says, “life has been full of really high highs for me, and really low lows. I got married, I traveled Europe, I wrote some of the best music I’ve ever written about love and life. But, I also lost my relationship with my brother, who used to be a major part of the Senators. I put my trust in a manager who left us with not much more than a lot of debt and disappointment. My longtime drummer and one of my best friends had to leave the band for his growing family. We all had to face life. In the end, I pretty much had to start from scratch. Now, we’ve brought in some really amazing players, played with arrangements, experimented with genres and come back to a better place than before.”\n\nYou can definitely hear the folk roots shining through the haunting electronic textures of the title track, and Teer says he wrote every song on acoustic guitar. “But this EP is how I brought myself out of all of that conflict and loss,” he continues. “I figured the best answer to hurt is hope and love. So, that’s what I wrote. There are love songs, nostalgic ones, hopeful ones. And, I played with the genre. I love folk music because it’s honest. And I love honest-sounding instruments. So, I wanted to take things that are synthetic -- like synth and 808 drums -- and make them feel really honest, bare and emotional here.”\n\nTheir release show also features the Jon Rauhouse Combo and Dylan Pratt.\n\nDetails: 7:30 p.m. Friday, Jan. 13. Valley Bar, 130 N. Central Ave., Phoenix. $12; $10 in advance. valleybarphx.com.\n\n1/13: Seven Trill release show\n\nThe Mexican/Latino hip-hop artist is releasing an album called “Christopher.”\n\n“When I along with my producers AKT Aktion, Tony Choc and Stevie Hardy were creating the album we had just opened VAUL studio in Scottsdale which is our home base studio and we all were at an all time high as far as hunger goes,” he says. “My mindset and mind state when writing my lyrics of the album was basically me showing everyone in the industry that I can hang on every level that these signed artist possess as far as skill and hunger go. I was going through a split-up with my second baby's mother and I was feeling that 'this is all or nothing' type of feeling. And the hunger still remains. We've already started working on the next album.”\n\nAs for the release show, where he’s joined by DJ Hoppa, Demrick and OSF, Seven Trill says, “It’s going to be a movie!!!”\n\nDetails: 7 p.m. Friday, Jan. 13. Club Red, 1306 W. University Drive, Mesa. $20. 480-258-2733, clubredrocks.com.\n\n1/14: The Darts/Snake! Snake! Snakes!\n\nIf you happen to share my belief that garage-rock is best served with reckless, you should definitely mark your calendar for this one. The Darts are a new all-female foursome fronted by the Love Me Nots’ Nicole Laurenne on vocals and Farfisa, also featuring Christina Nunez (of the Love Me Nots) on bass, Michelle Balderrama of Brainspoon on guitar and vocals, and Rikki Styxx on drums. A raucous first EP that more than lives up to the sum of their assorted reputations earned the girls a deal with Dirty Water Records, the in-house label of a legendary London club night named in honor of the Standells' \"Dirty Water.\" Laurenne says this is \"kind of what I always wanted to do, with the people I want to do it with, and it has been so awesome so far.\" They’re joined by Snake! Snake! Snakes!, who recently followed my pick for best local release of 2016 with a four-song EP banged out in a single weekend that plays to all the same strengths as “Tranquilo” while adding four more future staples to the set list. Also playing, Sunlaand, whose exhilarating take on skate punk makes me think they’d do well on a bill with Fidlar.\n\nDetails: 8 p.m. Saturday, Jan. 14. Valley Bar, 130 N. Central Ave., Phoenix. $8; $6 in advance. valleybarphx.com.\n\n1/14: Injury Reserve release show\n\n“This that raised-by-the-internet ain't-had-no-dad rap.\" These fast-rising hip-hop sensations are throwing a party to celebrate the release late last year of an album called “Floss,” the much-anticipated followup to their acclaimed debut, \"Live from the Dentist Office.\" The Needle Drop blog hailed the album’s release with “Arizona's Injury Reserve threatens the rap establishment with one of the most exciting tapes in the underground right now.” The album was preceded by two videos – “Oh S—t!!!” and “All this Money,” both of which were featured on our monthly singles countdown here at azcentral. It features guest appearances by Cakes Da Killa and Vic Mensa (which speaks volumes to their rising street cred).\n\nDetails: 8 p.m. Saturday, Jan. 14. Crescent Ballroom, 308 N. Second Ave., Phoenix. $10. 602-716-2222, crescentphx.com.\n\n1/14: YabYum Awards\n\nYabYum Music and Arts does an amazing job of capturing the essence of the local scene, and this awards show is a chance for them to honor the talent that has risen to the top, including live performances by any number of finest names in local entertainment, from Phoenix Afrobeat Orchestra and decker. to Fairy Bones, Nanami Ozone and Phantom Party. And Hotrock Supajoint was clearly born to host this sort of thing.\n\nYabYum’s Carly Schorman says, “Every year we take time out of our January schedule to acknowledge some of the releases and bands of the preceding year that really made a lasting impression on us. This year we decided to also give bands physical awards so it seemed fitting that we throw an awards show where bands could come pick up their trophies. Some of this year's award winners will be performing at the show, and we've invited some wonderful people from the community to set up tables at the event, including Radio Phoenix, KWSS, Wasted Ink Zine Distro and Sun Devil Trophy (who partnered with us to make this event possible). And, given that the senior editors spend the majority of our waking hours hidden in a dark room swimming through submissions, this public event has us oscillating between manic excitement and extreme apprehension, but the excitement seems to be taking the lead.”\n\nDetails: 6 p.m. Saturday, Jan. 14. Trunk Space, 1124 N. Third St., Phoenix. Free. Thetrunkspace.com.\n\n1/14: Murkocet release show\n\nPromising, as always, a “continuous beatdown of straight-up cutthroat American heavy metal,” the members of Murkocet are celebrating the release of their first album, “Digging Mercy’s Grave.”\n\nSinger Richie Jano says, “Going into writing all of the songs, we really just wanted to focus on trying to write something aggressive and heavy while also maintaining a sound that would allow anyone remotely close to being fans of the genre to enjoy themselves with smooth but heavy grooves that would transition into those heavy downbeats that would make a crowd move. The goal was to always have music that would make the live show extremely interactive and fun. It's all about trying to get people to move around and enjoy themselves.”\n\nThis is the first time the members of Murkocet have heard these songs recorded at the professional level, and as Jano says, “To us they truly stand out in the ways that were originally envisioned, and the next album will only be that much heavier and more extreme.”\n\nThey’re joined at their release show by Sicmonic, the Exiled Martyr, Pariah, Hollow Terra and In Silence We Die.\n\nDetails: 6 p.m. Saturday, Jan. 14. Club Red, 1306 W. University Drive, Mesa. $13; $10 in advance. 480-258-2733, clubredrocks.com.\n\n1/14: Vintage Wednesday release show\n\nHaving recently won the Alice Cooper Proof is in the Pudding Contest, after which they rocked the crowd at Cooper’s Christmas Pudding concert, Vintage Wednesday will release an EP titled “Heartstrings,” with opening sets by Joe Vito, Newports, Bad Time for Tea and People Who Could Fly. They’re a young band but they clearly live up to their name with a sound that would have been right at home on the AOR stations of the ‘70s. And as I noted in reviewing Christmas Pudding, “Taylor Sackson can wail with the best of them and her bandmates back up those attention-grabbing vocals with real energy.”\n\nWinning Proof is in the Pudding was a thrill for Sackson.\n\n\"I mean, we've been trying to win for quite a long time; it just wasn’t in our cards,\" she says. \"But we learned more and more by competing every single year. The prize was super awesome and we got to meet some of our idols. It was just kind of a lifetime of memories in one night. And now we have that on our resume, that we won Pudding. That’s a pretty big deal, especially in the Phoenix scene.\"\n\nRecorded in Austin with Grammy-nominated Chris \"Frenchie\" Smith (Jet, Toadies, Santana, Meat Puppets).producing, this EP is their second effort and features some of Sackson's favorite work.\n\n\"For me personally, the literature means so much to me,\" she says. \"I could go on for hours about every story behind the lyrics. And the instrumentals were really thought out. We’re just super proud. It’s definitely our baby. This has been in the works for a really long time.\"\n\nFor now, they have an effort titled “Simple Things” on Spotify and iTunes. But Sackson says, “We just feel like we were so young when we released that album and when we recorded it. So to feel that we have something to release that’s a better representation of us is exciting.”\n\nDetails: 8 p.m. Saturday, Jan. 14. Last Exit Live, 717 S. Central Ave., Phoenix. $10. 602-271-7000, lastexitlive.com.\n\nMORE MUSIC: Get the Things to Do app | Top concerts this week | Latest Phoenix concert announcements | January concert guide\n\n1/15: Arizona Blues Hall of Fame Induction Ceremony Fundraiser\n\nJoin the Hall of Fame as it inducts Mike Howard, Andy Gonzales, Jerome Teasley and Anna Warr. Howard, Gonzales and Warr will perform, as will Hans Olson, Texas Red, Sugaray Rayford, Bad News Blues Band, Sistahs Too (with Rochelle Raya and Lila Sherman), George Bowman, Stan Devereaux, Johnny Rapp, R.D. Olson, Bryan Dean Band, Brian Fahey, Johnny Tanner, Johnny D. and the Bob Corritore / Dave Riley Juke Joint Blues Band.\n\nDetails: 3 p.m. Sunday, Jan. 15. Rhythm Room, 1019 E. Indian School Road, Phoenix. $8. 602-265-4842, rhythmroom.com.\n\n1/16: Get Up! A Night of Neo Soul Funk & Good Times\n\nDance the night away on Martin Luther King Jr. Day with Aunt B, the Color 8 and Hi-Dreams Hot Wax. According to no lesser an authority than Aunt B’s Facebook bio, the Gilbert soul revivalists joined forces after Megan and Shane Baskerville got married at the Stax Museum of Soul in Memphis. “When they got back,” we’re told, “they started writing tons of inspired songs from their love of soul, gospel and R&B. Megan has been singing country, punk and ska her whole life and perfected her craft in Charleston working with many of the musicians that lived through the era of classic country and soul. Shane was in punk and ska bands and toured in the bands Helva, US Crush, Ska Daddyz, Butt Trumpet and many more...playing Warped Tours and tons of shows with his punk rock idles. Chad and Tre were in the band Safehouse and developed a strong following in Phoenix and the U.S. Chad has also played in Fivespeed and has toured playing drums with AZ reggae punkers Authority Zero! Benjamin grew up in a musical family playing churches and is part of the School of Rock touring outfit the All Stars. Autumn and Michelle love music, singing and helping to keep the flow of the show going.”\n\nDetails: 8 p.m. Monday, Jan. 16. Rebel Lounge, 2303 E. Indian School Road, Phoenix. $12; $10 in advance. 602-296-7013, therebellounge.com.\n\n1/18: Weird Radicals\n\nThese guys made my list of Best Songs of 2016 with a song called “Sleepwalker,” of which I wrote, “I’m pretty sure this is among the most contagious power-pop recordings any artist has come up with since the golden age of Superdrag, an endless succession of sugar-coated pop hooks with guitars that chug more like the early Who than the Ramones and switch to bashing on the accents.” And they’re already moving on to bigger, better things. The bandleader sent me a rough mix of a new track, “Human Being,” that’s every bit as catchy as the song that made my list but more ambitious complete with a proper string arrangement and a chorus hook that couldn’t be more timeless. This is a great bill top to bottom, with Andy Warpigs, the Edisons and Soft Deadlines.\n\nDetails: 8 p.m. Wednesday, Jan. 18. Rebel Lounge, 2303 E. Indian School Road, Phoenix. $8; $5 in advance. 602-296-7013, therebellounge.com.\n\n1/20: BSLFE album release party\n\nThere’s clearly something to be said for celebrating the release of your album while sharing a bill with a national act, in this case Baby Bash. BSLFE is a hip-hop collective bringing together the skills of Unfadeable Outlaw, SyckSyllables, Pornografick, Killroy, SikkOne and Bstaks.\n\nUnfadeable Outlaw told us: “We feel like we have a very unique sound, and music you can't put a price on. When at the studio, we just go with the flow, vibe and let the music take control.” As for sharing the spotlight with a touring act at their show? “We're anticipating that bringing Baby Bash for our album release party can help us reach a bigger audience as we plan to keep working on putting bigger shows together and bringing more major acts of the same caliber to the Valley. We typically don't follow any trends and make music for the love of the art. We’re not really concerned about critics. We're more focused on making good quality music that can be appreciated by all genres.”\n\nRather than coming together in the studio to work on new material, the members do their own tracks in their own home studios and let the engineer take it from there. “We've tried to bring all five of us together and vibe it out at the studio but instead of work it turns into a huge party,” Unfadeable Outlaw says, with a laugh.\n\nThe project started just for fun while they were working on their individual effort.\n\n“We decided to make a free mixtape as a group for fun and exposure,” Unfadeable Outlaw says. “The idea later turned into something more serious. We started shooting videos and doings shows and noticed that people was really feeling the group. Basically, we've known each other for eight-plus years and worked at the same studios so it's almost like it was meant to be. We're all good friends and do a lot of traveling as a family outside of the music industry so it's never really work when I’m around my brothers. I'm not sure what the future holds but what I do know is we will continue to make music together for years to come.”\n\nDetails: 8 p.m. Friday, Jan. 20. Club Red, 1306 W. University Drive, Mesa. $25-$30 in advance. 480-258-2733, clubredrocks.com.\n\n1/21: 8123 Fest: Celebrating 10 years of the Maine\n\nAmong the more successful local exports of the new millennium, the Maine have thrown themselves an all-day bash for their 10th anniversary, bringing in the Summer Set, the Technicolors, Beach Weather, This Century, Gorgeous War and Brighten.\n\nDrummer Pat Kirch says, “I'm really proud that we have been making music for this long. I'm not sure I would have ever imagined us being a band this long 10 years ago. It just didn't seem possible because so many of the bands I was into in high school only made two albums then broke up. But it really feels like we are just getting started and I still feel like we are the underdog trying to make something happen for ourselves. I hope that feeling never goes away. It will be nice to take a day and look back on everything we have done because we are always so focused on the next album or tour, we don't spend too much energy thinking about what we have done.\"\n\nSo what does he think of the Maine they were 10 years ago?\n\n“I feel like not much has changed,” he says. “We have just gained more knowledge along the way but the passion is still the same and the approach is the same as it was. We have always done things for ourselves. We build the stage setups for tours ourselves. My brother is our manager and he does all our design work like he always has. We have our friends come on tour with us. It really feels the same.\"\n\nThe music has evolved, though.\n\n“We have always been in search of a new sound for our band and have tried to live in a musical world where we didn't let fear control what we created,” Kirch explains. “I think that each of our albums sounds pretty different from the next and that comes from us always discovering new inspiration and putting ourselves in situations where we were forced to do something new. We are never reinventing the wheel but for our band we are each time we make an album.\"\n\nAnd speaking of albums, they’re putting the finishing touches on a new one, which they plan to tour on this year. As Kirch says, “I know we have made our best album yet and just can't wait to share it with everyone.”\n\nDetails: 1 p.m. Saturday, Jan. 21. Crescent Ballroom, 308 N. Second Ave., Phoenix. $25-$35. 602-716-2222, crescentphx.com.\n\n1/21: The Lonesome Wilderness EP release show\n\nThis is the second EP for the Lonesome Wilderness and it shows the sort of growth you’d hope for but don’t often see, exploring a more psychedelic flavor than the first release. As Joe Golfen explains, “For the first EP, we really wanted to focus on capturing the sound of us as a live band, so we recorded the whole thing live in one day with Jalipaz Nelson at Audioconfusion and he did an awesome job. This time around we had the chance to work with some of our friends and their home studios, which gave us a lot more time to try new things and add more elements to the production. Three of these songs, ‘Karma,’ ‘Murder in Chicago’ and ‘Nico,’ have been in our set for years, but we wanted to make sure we had the time to add all the studio elements we were hearing in our heads.”\n\n\"Karma,\" the opening track, was recorded a year ago with Colin Denker for a single. But it turned out better than they’d hoped, so they wanted to save it for an EP. The other four songs were recorded with James T. Mitchell at Bangarang Studio in Tempe. Golfen says, “He was great about just letting the song go in different directions and experimenting with different sounds, without overpowering the song. So we have a lot of classic ’60s psychedelic elements going throughout the album, from Beatles-style harmonies on ‘Alright,’ back-masked guitars on ‘Karma’ or that delay-heavy guitar freakout on ‘Stay Out of the Sun.’”\n\nIf you’re going, do not screw around and get there just in time to see them. This is an excellent showcase for the local scene, with Snake! Snake! Snakes!, No Volcano, Field Tripp and the Human Torch.\n\nDetails: 8 p.m. Saturday, Jan. 21. Rogue Bar, 423 N. Scottsdale Rd., Scottsdale. $7. 480-947-3580, facebook.com/theroguebar.\n\n1/21: Mr. Mudd & Mr. Gold album release party\n\nNamed in honor of a Townes Van Zandt song, these guys are releasing a self-titled debut of banjo-driven, bluegrass-flavored alternative-country recorded with Jalipaz Nelson and Dan Somers at Audioconfusion.\n\nAs Tyler Matock, who sings in addition to playing acoustic guitar, harmonica and kazoo, recalls the sessions, “Being as it was our first time in a professional recording studio, it started off as a sort of nervous and shaky experience for myself. I knew the songs we picked to record were good, but in the back of my mind there was still a little bit of anxiety or doubt. Especially when there’s a bunch of mics pointed at you and your instruments. But after a little while I think I could see some interest from both Jalipaz and Dan. I felt like they were hearing us do something pretty cool, and I think they became fans of it and seemed as excited as we were about the songs and performances of each track. Seeing and feeling them react to the music we were playing was kind of an ice breaker, and it almost instantly relieved me of any fears or doubts I may have had. Then it slowly started to feel like this really natural thing and as close to a ‘live performance’ as possible.”\n\nMatock and Jesse Gray, who plays banjo, electric guitar and a suitcase drum, are both really pleased with the way the recording turned out. “One thing that strikes me all the time with this album,” Matock says, “was how proud we both were when we first listened to it. I’m talking before it was even mixed or mastered. Jal had given us each a copy of just the bare bones recording, and I can remember listening to it with family while parked in the driveway and tears coming down my face upon hearing it. I think we even kind of shocked ourselves after we listened to it, and started thinking that maybe we’ve got a solid and strong representation of where we were as a band at the time, and what we’re capable of doing - and our confidence grew towards how excited we are to share this to everyone. Even outside of our own close family members and friends, I feel like the people we’ve met along the way and gained the attention of, feel more and more like our extended family and friends. I personally feel like we really owe this to them, and I couldn’t be happier with the work we did to fulfill that debt.”\n\nDetails: 8:30 p.m. Saturday, Jan.21. Last Exit Live, 717 S. Central Ave., Phoenix. $10. 602-271-7000, lastexitlive.com.\n\n1/27: Never Let This Go release show\n\nRecorded last summer at ZK Productions in Atlanta with Zack Odom and Kenneth Mount (Cartel/Mayday Parade/ All Time Low), the follow up to 2015's \"Believe\" touches on subjects involving love, loss and perseverance. Singer David Kleinebreil sums it up as his most personable batch of songs yet, written following his mother's multiple bouts with cancer. To coincide with the release, they recently released the above music video for \"Break You\" shot and directed by Jacob Reynolds.\n\nDetails: 7 p.m. Friday, Jan. 27. Rebel Lounge, 2303 E.

From there, the instant bandmates write three songs and learn one cover, all of which they will perform that same night on the Crescent Ballroom stage. As promoter Stephen Chilton says, there’s “something awesome about seeing 500 people show up to see music that doesn't exist yet.”\n\nAll proceeds benefit Rosie’s House and their mission to give the underserved youth of greater Phoenix music education.\n\n“This is always my favorite local show of the year,” Chilton says. “At no other show do you see musicians collaborating with such a diverse group of fellow musicians. In many cases they may never have come together under any other circumstances without the Rock Lottery.”\n\nThis year's participants are: Jef Wright (of Roar / Treasure MammaL), Marty Welker (El West), Pat McCarthy (The Stiletto Formal), Ryan McPhatter (Black Bottom Lighters), Dave Marquez (PAO Phoenix Afrobeat Orchestra / Mariachi de Grand Ave), Amber Johnson (decker.), Chelsey Louise (Fairy Bones), Cassidy Hilgers (Sister Lip / Field Tripp), Jacob Lauxman (Twin Ponies), Alex Benson (Okilly Dokilly), Mark Sunman (The Haymarket Squares), Caleb Dailey (Bear State / Flower Festival), Jake Arrington (There Is Danger / Underground Cities), Corey Gloden (Wyves / Dry River Yacht Club), Zach Zimmerman (American Longspurs), Taylor Upsahl, Holly Pyle (House of Stairs) ,Austin Rickert (Jerusafunk / Playboy Manbaby), Jared Geyer (Weslynn), Jon Rauhouse (who records and tours with Neko Case, among others), Aldy Montufar (PAO Phoenix Afrobeat Orchestra / Fatigo), Thomas Knight (Bear Ghost), Cori Rios (The Hourglass Cats), Joshua Hill (The Hill in Mind) and Austen Mack (Captain Squeegee).\n\nDetails: 8:30 p.m. Saturday, Jan. 28. Crescent Ballroom, 308 N. Second Ave., Phoenix. $15; $12 in advance. 602-716-2222, crescentphx.com.\n\n1/28: The Rebel Set release show\n\nThese garage-punk revivalists are releasing a raucous four-song EP on Hidden Volume Records out of Baltimore complete with classic retrotastic cover art by X10. The music was recorded by the legendary Matt Rendon (Resonars, Knockout Pills, Freezing Hands) at Midtown Island Studios in Tucson.\n\nSinger-guitarist Joe Zimmerman says, “We were trying to broaden our sound somewhat but still sound like us.” Mission accomplished. And they backed it up with killer hooks, from the hand-jive-compatible beat of the opener “Jorge Miguel” to the twangy surf-guitar licks of “Falling Apart” and an organ sound throughout that makes me think of Steve Nieve in his trash-rocking prime. If you even know what \"Nuggets\" is, you should be on board long before they sign off with “Trails,” a garage-rocking gem that manages to come on like a reckless missing link between the Kinks song “Gotta Get the First Plane Home” and the Capitols’ “Cool Jerk.”\n\nThey're joined by the 16 Eyes and the Halahs.\n\nDetails: 8 p.m. Saturday, Jan. 28. Valley Bar, 130 N. Central Ave., Phoenix. Free. valleybarphx.com.\n\n1/29: The Suicide Kings\n\nBruce Connolle, Vince Ramirez, Jon Rauhouse and company will give a rare performance of such local alternative-country classics as “Light at the End of the Bottle,” “I Want to Live Forever” and what’s sure to be a crowd-pleasing version of a honky-tonk lament called “Even Hookers Say Goodbye.” They do, you know. The Kings played John P. Dixon’s Birthday Bash in May and they shared pictures from the studio last month on Facebook. So is this a full return to active duty. \"We are more or less a band again,\" Ramirez says. \"We actually have been at it for the past six months or so but in a very limited capacity. We haven't really rushed out to book a lot of shows. The main reason is the current lineup consists of seasoned players that have a lot on our plates. Either with other projects or life in general, kids, jobs etc. And one of the biggest obstacles is us working around Jon Rauhouse's touring schedule (he tours with Neko Case and other A-list talent). Also playing: Honeygirl.\n\nDetails: 1 p.m. Sunday, Jan. 29. Shady Park Tempe, 26 E. University Drive. 480-474-4222, facebook.com/ShadyParkTempe.\n\n1/29: LeeLee Robert CD release party\n\nThis jazz singer is releasing “Let Me Be The One,” an album she recorded in collaboration with guitarist Alex Zawilak. It features six Robert originals, three standards and three songs by jazz songwriter Blaise Lantana. “I was deeply inspired by the album made by Ella Fitzgerald and Joe Pass where a single guitar and solo vocal collaborated into an intimate, original and exquisite partnership. This was the inspiration behind ‘Let Me Be The One’ – a real dream realized.” As a writer, Robert says, “I like songs that tell a story and give an insight into our humanity that people can identify with. I try to inspire people to reach higher and deeper to get more out of life. I like music that can weave an ambience into ones life without being obtrusive; music that can give you energy for doing what you love doing. This is the sweetest partnership between an artist and listener – a partnership that I have dedicated my life to.”\n\nDetails: 3 p.m. Saturday, Jan. 29. The Nash, 110 E. Roosevelt St., Phoenix. $20 for students, $31.50 for seniors, $35 general admission. 602-795-0464, thenash.org.\n\nThese shows have already happened, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't read up on the bands and catch another show. They're local. They will play again.\n\n1/6: Mill’s End Birthday Bash and Cancer Benefit\n\nThis show doubles as a birthday celebration for Mill’s End’s guitar-playing vocalist Jeff Bump and lead guitarist Keith Perrillo, and a benefit for the F C Cancer Foundation, whose mission is to raise awareness and provide education about early cancer detection, ultimately putting an end to late-stage cancer diagnosis. Bump says, “Keith and I have the same birthday so we thought what better way to celebrate it than by playing a show for a great cause. It's also very personal to me because I lost my Mom last year from cancer.” If you’re not familiar with Mill’s End, their sound tends to favor the rowdier side of alternative-country. They’ll be joined by Marc Norman, the Bellwethers and the Hardways.\n\nDetails: 8 p.m. Friday, Jan. 6. Pho Cao, 7436 E McDowell Road. $10 donation. 480-947-2608, phocaoaz.com.\n\n1/6: Expos / Closet Goth release show\n\nThe Expos will release an eight-inch album. Yes, an eight-inch album. Like a seven-inch, but bigger. Aaron Ponzo says, “I made this 30-second song (‘South Mountain’) that I had nothing to do with really in August 2016 and then Colin (guitarist of the expos, Warped Your Records) wanted to make an Expos 8-inch after the success of 2016's WARPED YOUR FEST and I decided to make an album where no song goes over 30 seconds long! After 3 months in my room working on a bunch of different ideas I finally got 18 songs I like and sent them to Colin so they could be pressed! The album takes influences from classic rock artists like Thin Lizzy and Van Halen, pop bands like Dear Nora, Frankie Cosmos, and Alex G, and just other rock shredders like Weezer and Tony Molina!”\n\nCloset Goth says he was “going for a dance record in the least accessible way possible.” “I love dissonance,” he says. “So I went for a No Wave disco sound. This was the first Closet Goth record where I had people help me with recordings, with a few friends on vocals, drums and keys. This project started when I moved to Arizona and wanted to start fresh musically and separate myself from my Pennsylvania roots.”\n\nAlso playing: Diners and Doomed to Bloom.\n\nDetails: 7:30 p.m. Friday, Jan. 6. Trunk Space, 1124 N. Third St., Phoenix. $6. Thetrunkspace.com.\n\n1/7: Rhythm Room House Rent Party\n\nIt’s not really rent. It’s the annual property tax that’s coming due. But that takes money too so these artists have graciously come together for the cause. And it’s a killer lineup, featuring the Rocket 88’s, Dave Riley and Bob Corritore, the Mike Eldred Trio, Sugaray Rayford, Mikel & Meredith (of Sugar Thieves), Smokestack Lightning, George Bowman, JC & the Juke Rockers and more. The party also features three emcees: Jim Crawford, Janice Johnston and Drew Verbis.\n\nDetails: 7 p.m. Saturday, Jan. 7. Rhythm Room, 1019 E.

Come celebrate the King, without whom I’m not sure we’d still be covering rock culture in 2017, with Brea Burns, the Mike Eldred Trio, Slik 50, Mario Moreno, Laura Walsh, Jimmy Pines & Washboard Jere, Tommy Price of the Stilettos, Pat Roberts, Jerry Lawson of the Persuasions, DL Marble, Whiskey Kiss, Kevin Daly, Bob Corritore, Elgin MacMillan & Thurane, Kenny Love & the Rockafellas, Rooster Coup Deville, Brian Fahey and Che Nemeth. That’s a lot of talent on one bill. As Bob Corritore says, “Some of Phoenix's greatest musicians pay tribute to this great musical icon who influenced us all. And everyone will perform two or three Elvis songs.”\n\nDetails: 6 p.m. Sunday, Jan. 8. Rhythm Room, 1019 E. Indian School Road, Phoenix. $8. 602-265-4842, rhythmroom.com.\n\n1/13: The Senators EP release show\n\nThe Senators are releasing a four-song EP called “Coyotes” that should have no problem speaking to fans of their earlier work while allowing for growth and experimentation with new musical approaches. Front man Jesse Teer says, “When you listen, it’s clear this is a departure from what we’ve done in the past. But, to me, it draws a pretty clear line from where we started to where we are now.” Since their previous release, he says, “life has been full of really high highs for me, and really low lows. I got married, I traveled Europe, I wrote some of the best music I’ve ever written about love and life. But, I also lost my relationship with my brother, who used to be a major part of the Senators. I put my trust in a manager who left us with not much more than a lot of debt and disappointment. My longtime drummer and one of my best friends had to leave the band for his growing family. We all had to face life. In the end, I pretty much had to start from scratch. Now, we’ve brought in some really amazing players, played with arrangements, experimented with genres and come back to a better place than before.”\n\nYou can definitely hear the folk roots shining through the haunting electronic textures of the title track, and Teer says he wrote every song on acoustic guitar. “But this EP is how I brought myself out of all of that conflict and loss,” he continues. “I figured the best answer to hurt is hope and love. So, that’s what I wrote. There are love songs, nostalgic ones, hopeful ones. And, I played with the genre. I love folk music because it’s honest. And I love honest-sounding instruments. So, I wanted to take things that are synthetic -- like synth and 808 drums -- and make them feel really honest, bare and emotional here.”\n\nTheir release show also features the Jon Rauhouse Combo and Dylan Pratt.\n\nDetails: 7:30 p.m. Friday, Jan. 13. Valley Bar, 130 N. Central Ave., Phoenix. $12; $10 in advance. valleybarphx.com.\n\n1/13: Seven Trill release show\n\nThe Mexican/Latino hip-hop artist is releasing an album called “Christopher.”\n\n“When I along with my producers AKT Aktion, Tony Choc and Stevie Hardy were creating the album we had just opened VAUL studio in Scottsdale which is our home base studio and we all were at an all time high as far as hunger goes,” he says. “My mindset and mind state when writing my lyrics of the album was basically me showing everyone in the industry that I can hang on every level that these signed artist possess as far as skill and hunger go. I was going through a split-up with my second baby's mother and I was feeling that 'this is all or nothing' type of feeling. And the hunger still remains. We've already started working on the next album.”\n\nAs for the release show, where he’s joined by DJ Hoppa, Demrick and OSF, Seven Trill says, “It’s going to be a movie!!!”\n\nDetails: 7 p.m. Friday, Jan. 13. Club Red, 1306 W. University Drive, Mesa. $20. 480-258-2733, clubredrocks.com.\n\n1/14: The Darts/Snake! Snake! Snakes!\n\nIf you happen to share my belief that garage-rock is best served with reckless, you should definitely mark your calendar for this one. The Darts are a new all-female foursome fronted by the Love Me Nots’ Nicole Laurenne on vocals and Farfisa, also featuring Christina Nunez (of the Love Me Nots) on bass, Michelle Balderrama of Brainspoon on guitar and vocals, and Rikki Styxx on drums. A raucous first EP that more than lives up to the sum of their assorted reputations earned the girls a deal with Dirty Water Records, the in-house label of a legendary London club night named in honor of the Standells' \"Dirty Water.\" Laurenne says this is \"kind of what I always wanted to do, with the people I want to do it with, and it has been so awesome so far.\" They’re joined by Snake! Snake! Snakes!, who recently followed my pick for best local release of 2016 with a four-song EP banged out in a single weekend that plays to all the same strengths as “Tranquilo” while adding four more future staples to the set list. Also playing, Sunlaand, whose exhilarating take on skate punk makes me think they’d do well on a bill with Fidlar.\n\nDetails: 8 p.m. Saturday, Jan. 14. Valley Bar, 130 N. Central Ave., Phoenix. $8; $6 in advance. valleybarphx.com.\n\n1/14: Injury Reserve release show\n\n“This that raised-by-the-internet ain't-had-no-dad rap.\" These fast-rising hip-hop sensations are throwing a party to celebrate the release late last year of an album called “Floss,” the much-anticipated followup to their acclaimed debut, \"Live from the Dentist Office.\" The Needle Drop blog hailed the album’s release with “Arizona's Injury Reserve threatens the rap establishment with one of the most exciting tapes in the underground right now.” The album was preceded by two videos – “Oh S—t!!!” and “All this Money,” both of which were featured on our monthly singles countdown here at azcentral. It features guest appearances by Cakes Da Killa and Vic Mensa (which speaks volumes to their rising street cred).\n\nDetails: 8 p.m. Saturday, Jan. 14. Crescent Ballroom, 308 N. Second Ave., Phoenix. $10. 602-716-2222, crescentphx.com.\n\n1/14: YabYum Awards\n\nYabYum Music and Arts does an amazing job of capturing the essence of the local scene, and this awards show is a chance for them to honor the talent that has risen to the top, including live performances by any number of finest names in local entertainment, from Phoenix Afrobeat Orchestra and decker. to Fairy Bones, Nanami Ozone and Phantom Party. And Hotrock Supajoint was clearly born to host this sort of thing.\n\nYabYum’s Carly Schorman says, “Every year we take time out of our January schedule to acknowledge some of the releases and bands of the preceding year that really made a lasting impression on us. This year we decided to also give bands physical awards so it seemed fitting that we throw an awards show where bands could come pick up their trophies. Some of this year's award winners will be performing at the show, and we've invited some wonderful people from the community to set up tables at the event, including Radio Phoenix, KWSS, Wasted Ink Zine Distro and Sun Devil Trophy (who partnered with us to make this event possible). And, given that the senior editors spend the majority of our waking hours hidden in a dark room swimming through submissions, this public event has us oscillating between manic excitement and extreme apprehension, but the excitement seems to be taking the lead.”\n\nDetails: 6 p.m. Saturday, Jan. 14. Trunk Space, 1124 N. Third St., Phoenix. Free. Thetrunkspace.com.\n\n1/14: Murkocet release show\n\nPromising, as always, a “continuous beatdown of straight-up cutthroat American heavy metal,” the members of Murkocet are celebrating the release of their first album, “Digging Mercy’s Grave.”\n\nSinger Richie Jano says, “Going into writing all of the songs, we really just wanted to focus on trying to write something aggressive and heavy while also maintaining a sound that would allow anyone remotely close to being fans of the genre to enjoy themselves with smooth but heavy grooves that would transition into those heavy downbeats that would make a crowd move. The goal was to always have music that would make the live show extremely interactive and fun. It's all about trying to get people to move around and enjoy themselves.”\n\nThis is the first time the members of Murkocet have heard these songs recorded at the professional level, and as Jano says, “To us they truly stand out in the ways that were originally envisioned, and the next album will only be that much heavier and more extreme.”\n\nThey’re joined at their release show by Sicmonic, the Exiled Martyr, Pariah, Hollow Terra and In Silence We Die.\n\nDetails: 6 p.m. Saturday, Jan. 14. Club Red, 1306 W. University Drive, Mesa. $13; $10 in advance. 480-258-2733, clubredrocks.com.\n\n1/14: Vintage Wednesday release show\n\nHaving recently won the Alice Cooper Proof is in the Pudding Contest, after which they rocked the crowd at Cooper’s Christmas Pudding concert, Vintage Wednesday will release an EP titled “Heartstrings,” with opening sets by Joe Vito, Newports, Bad Time for Tea and People Who Could Fly. They’re a young band but they clearly live up to their name with a sound that would have been right at home on the AOR stations of the ‘70s. And as I noted in reviewing Christmas Pudding, “Taylor Sackson can wail with the best of them and her bandmates back up those attention-grabbing vocals with real energy.”\n\nWinning Proof is in the Pudding was a thrill for Sackson.\n\n\"I mean, we've been trying to win for quite a long time; it just wasn’t in our cards,\" she says. \"But we learned more and more by competing every single year. The prize was super awesome and we got to meet some of our idols. It was just kind of a lifetime of memories in one night. And now we have that on our resume, that we won Pudding. That’s a pretty big deal, especially in the Phoenix scene.\"\n\nRecorded in Austin with Grammy-nominated Chris \"Frenchie\" Smith (Jet, Toadies, Santana, Meat Puppets).producing, this EP is their second effort and features some of Sackson's favorite work.\n\n\"For me personally, the literature means so much to me,\" she says. \"I could go on for hours about every story behind the lyrics. And the instrumentals were really thought out. We’re just super proud. It’s definitely our baby. This has been in the works for a really long time.\"\n\nFor now, they have an effort titled “Simple Things” on Spotify and iTunes. But Sackson says, “We just feel like we were so young when we released that album and when we recorded it. So to feel that we have something to release that’s a better representation of us is exciting.”\n\nDetails: 8 p.m. Saturday, Jan. 14. Last Exit Live, 717 S.
