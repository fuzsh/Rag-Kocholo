The park is located directly on the shores of Tampa Bay, with acres of plush grass and palm trees. Vinoy Park is the perfect tropical setting for one of the world’s greatest blues music festivals.\n\nThe Blues Festival is an ideal setting to enjoy Florida’s sunshine and warm spring weather. For guests seeking an enhanced festival experience, we offer a special VIP Package with “front” stage seating, a large VIP tent with free food, beer & soda, and beautiful views of Tampa Bay.\n\nThe Tampa Bay Blues Festival has established itself as one of the world’s preeminent blues music events, having presented over 325 of the world’s greatest blues performers. Past artists include such legends as Buddy Guy, George Thorogood, Taj Mahal, Robert Cray, Delbert McClinton, Little Feat, Jonny Lang, Los Lobos, Jerry Lee Lewis, Koko Taylor, Jimmie Vaughan, Irma Thomas, Susan Tedeschi, and others. The festival has truly become a destination event, with friends traveling from throughout the United States and Europe to enjoy Florida’s beautiful weather and this magnificent celebration of music.\n\nA state of the art PA system and lighting will be provided to insure the very best sound and entertainment.\n\nThroughout the festival grounds, you will enjoy tasty food, including seafood, barbeque, Cuban cuisine, and other culinary treats. Festival vendors also include arts & crafts. Premium beer and wine are also available.\n\nIn addition to great music and warm weather, you will also enjoy visiting downtown St. Petersburg, with its many restaurants, clubs, and art museums, including the world famous Dali Museum. From St. Petersburg you may also wish to travel 20 minutes to the beaches of St. Pete Beach, Treasure Island, and Pass-a-Grille. The area’s Ft. DeSoto Beach offers a large, public park and was recently named one of the world’s finest beaches.\n\nThe Tampa Bay Blues Festival prides itself on providing the very best in blues entertainment, in an ideal tropical setting. Proceeds from the event benefit our charity partner, Parc Center for Disabilities. Please make your plans to attend the Tampa Bay Blues Festival, and join us for three great days of Blues by the Bay!"
