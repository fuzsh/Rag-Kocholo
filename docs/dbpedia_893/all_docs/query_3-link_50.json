Certainly, there will be comparisons to his dad, but that can be expected and rightly so. Mud comes as close to the Muddy experience as one can get. He will always pay tribute to his dad with the Chicago blues ensemble sound that Muddy created. But Mud was also brought up musically when soul, Motown and R&B ruled the world. Mud played bass and performed with bands playing the hits of that era. This, along with his blues pedigree, has influenced Mud’s own songwriting skills, which are constantly evolving.”\n\n– R I C K K R E H E R (Muddy Waters’ last guitarist, and Mud’s long-time current guitarist!)\n\nALBUM PRODUCTION & SUPERVISION:\n\nJulia A. Miller & Elbio Barilari\n\nTRACK 1\n\nRECORDED BY Blaise Barton\n\nAT Joyride Studios, CHICAGO, IL, June 1, 2021\n\nARRANGED BY “Studebaker”John Grimaldi\n\nMIXED BY Blaise Barton & “Studebaker”John Grimaldi MASTERED BY Blaise Barton\n\nTRACKS 2-14\n\nPRODUCED BY Bob Corritore\n\nRECORDED Febuary 2011 AT Rax Trax Studios, CHICAGO, IL\n\nENGINEERS: Mike Tholen, Rick Barnes AND Malcolm Giron\n\nTRACKS 2-13 MIXED BY John Wroble, Porcupine Productions, CHANDLER, AZ\n\nANALOG MASTERING BY “Studebaker”John Grimaldi TRACK 14 MIXED BY Julia A. Miller AT Delmark Records\n\nRiverside Studio, August 2022 DIGITALLY MASTERED BY Julia A. Miller\n\nBOB CORRITORE APPEARS COURTESY OF DELTA GROOVE RECORDS\n\nEvery one of McKinley’s descendants has been anointed with his surname, synonymous with never-ending excellence. Mud Morganfield does what he does best – seamlessly merging a traditional blues sound with twenty-first-century sensibilities. His style’s “classic contemporary,” an oxymoron if there ever was one, but it fits like a glove. With understated crooning and fluid, molten-metal instrumentation, Mud’s blues glows red-hot as Damascus steel being poured in a foundry. It’s hard to be a demigod of any art, but he’s well his way to full canonization. – RANDY WETNIGHT"
