        "text": "Cat. no: CDSWMAF19\n\nFormat: CD\n\nBarcode: 634457072763\n\nRelease Date: 11 Mar 2022\n\nGenre: Blues\n\nAt the heart of this album of finely crafted down-home blues is the close friendship and musical chemistry of Louisiana Red and Bob Corritore - They both lived and worked in Chicago, then in Phoenix, Arizona, and continued to perform and record together after Red relocated to Europe - These 11 songs come from seven different recording sessions from 2000 to 2009 ; Red passed away Feb 25, 2012. Red leads us through all original songs with stunning vocals and hardhitting guitar, and Bob's brilliant harmonica is always spiritually and musically connected. The combo of Red and Bob along with the other fine players on this album is pure unadulterated blues power. Appearing in the crack backing bands are Chico Chism, David Maxwell, Bob Margolin, Little Victor's Juke Joint, Buddy Reed, Johnny Rapp, Chris James, Patrick Rynn, and Brian Fahey. Get ready for Louisiana Red and Bob Corritore to tell you 'bout it!\n\nTracks: Mary Dee Shuffle / Early Morning Blues / Alabama Train / Caught Your Man And Gone / New Jersey Blues / Freight Train To Ride / Tell Me 'Bout It /\n\nMore From This Artist:"
