Certainly, there will be comparisons to his dad, but that can be expected and rightly so. Mud comes as close to the Muddy experience as one can get. He will always pay tribute to his dad with the Chicago blues ensemble sound that Muddy created. But Mud was also brought up musically when soul, Motown and R&B ruled the world. Mud played bass and performed with bands playing the hits of that era. This, along with his blues pedigree, has influenced Mud’s own songwriting skills, which are constantly evolving.”\n\n– R I C K K R E H E R (Muddy Waters’ last guitarist, and Mud’s long-time current guitarist!)\n\nALBUM PRODUCTION & SUPERVISION:\n\nJulia A.

Miller\n\nBOB CORRITORE APPEARS COURTESY OF DELTA GROOVE RECORDS\n\nEvery one of McKinley’s descendants has been anointed with his surname, synonymous with never-ending excellence. Mud Morganfield does what he does best – seamlessly merging a traditional blues sound with twenty-first-century sensibilities. His style’s “classic contemporary,” an oxymoron if there ever was one, but it fits like a glove. With understated crooning and fluid, molten-metal instrumentation, Mud’s blues glows red-hot as Damascus steel being poured in a foundry. It’s hard to be a demigod of any art, but he’s well his way to full canonization. – RANDY WETNIGHT\n\nIt’s hard when you are the son of blues royalty. It’s even harder when you are the son of Muddy Waters. No matter how hard you try, you’re never going to be Muddy Waters. So, you have to forge your own path and build your own reputation with your own work.\n\nMud Morganfield has done just that. This soft-spoken, humble man has grown into a giant talent in recent years.\n\n–BARRY KERZNER, AMERICAN BLUES SCENE\n\nMulti-award-winning artist Mud Morganfield is an established star in the world of Blues music. The eldest son of the legendary Muddy Waters, Mud was brought up surrounded by many of the finest musicians in the Blues. Mud’s singing is firmly in the best traditions of Chicago Blues, but he is also a writer of great new songs and he is backed by some of the best musicians playing today. He is acclaimed by artists and critics, including Buddy Guy and Jools Holland for his own musical ability.\n\n“I’ve done and seen many things in my life. From drugs to gang wars, to hustling the streets. I not only have a duty but a responsibility to tell you all that I am a walking testimony to what God can do,” said Morganfield in a statement.\n\nDelmark Records, the oldest continuously operating blues & jazz independent record label in the US, announces a major addition to its roster. Mud Morganfield. Muddy Water’s eldest son just signed with the label. Morganfield’s first release on Delmark will be a digital single entitled “Praise Him”. The song, written and composed by the artist, will appear before September 1st.\n\nMullti-award-winning artist Mud Morganfield is an established star in the world of Blues music. The eldest son of the legendary Muddy Waters, Mud was brought up surrounded by many of the finest musicians in the Blues. Mud’s singing is firmly in best of traditions of Chicago Blues, but he is also a writer of great new songs and he is backed by some of the best musicians playing today. He is acclaimed by both critics and artists such as Buddy Guy and Jools Holland for his own musical ability,\n\nMud’s latest album, They Call Me Mud, was released on March 9, 2018, enjoying extensive airplay and great reviews.\n\nMud’s award-winning album, Son of the Seventh Son, was launched in 2012 and earned great reviews. The album was nominated in the Best Album and the Traditional Blues Male Artist Album categories of the 2013 Blues Foundation Blues Music Awards. In 2014, Mud’s collaboration with Kim Wilson, the album For Pops, attracted more critical acclaim and awards.\n\n“Praise Him”\n\nMud Morganfield\n\nDelmark Records (release date: August 20, 2021)\n\nwww.delmark.com\n\nBy Robert M. Marovich\n\nAlthough Chicago’s Delmark Records is best known for its estimable blues and jazz catalogues, there’s a sacred single in the mix, brought to you by a most surprising source: Mud Morganfield, the eldest son of electric blues pioneer Muddy Waters.\n\nExpressing the religious experience in his own way, Morganfield conjures “Praise Him” as a hoodoo brew built on a pinch of blues, a dollop of gospel, and a generous scoop of Memphis-style soul.\n\nA salvation story sets the scene for this haunting praise song. Morganfield participates in a call-and-response with a trio of singers, while Luca Chiellini’s organ sets a brakeless tempo and guitarists Mike Wheeler and Rick Kreher, along with Mud on bass and Cameron Lewis on drums, offer a seething rhythm section. This track, which could benefit from a radio edit version, is less church hymn, more blunt testimony at a late night revival.\n\nhttp://www.mudmorganfieldblues.com/\n\nRecorded in Chicago and produced by Bob Corritore, PORTRAIT features Mud Morganfield’s earthy, soulful vocals backed by a cadre of blues all-stars, including Kenny Smith on drums, Rick Kreher and Billy Flynn on guitar, Barrelhouse Chuck on keyboards, E.G. McDaniel on bass, and Harmonica Hinds and Bob Corritore on harp.\n\n“I just couldn’t have done this without those cats, man,” Morganfield told writer Terry Mullins in an interview published in Blues Blast Magazine. “They brought something to the studio that will forever live in my heart. It brought out the best in me. It’s a great CD, some of the best work I’ve done so far. It’s got one great song after another on it. “There’s two songs of pop’s on there and with anything I do, I’m gonna add pop,” Morganfield said in the interview. “But the rest of the disc is made up of several songs that I wrote, along with a song that Bob Corritore wrote and one my good friend Studebaker John wrote. But it’s all got that Muddy style to it, because that’s who I am. Without me even trying, I come off like the son of Muddy Waters and I’m proud that it’s like that.”\n\nhttps://www.allmusic.com/album/son-of-the-seventh-son-mw0002311563\n\noriginal review of SON OF SEVENTH SON"
