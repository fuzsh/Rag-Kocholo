        "text": "Biography\n\nDiscography\n\nNorth Mississippi guitarist R.L. Burnside is one of the paragons of state-of-the-art Delta juke joint blues. The guitarist, singer and songwriter was born November 23, 1926 in Oxford, MS, and makes his home in Holly Springs, in the hill country above the Delta. He's lived most of his life in the Mississippi hill country, which, unlike the Delta region, consists mainly of a lot of small farms. He learned his music from his neighbor, Fred McDowell, and the highly rhythmic style that Burnside plays is evident in McDowell's recording as well. Despite the otherworldly country-blues sounds put down by Burnside and his family band, known as the Sound Machine, his other influences are surprisingly contemporary: Muddy Waters, John Lee Hooker and Lightnin' Hopkins. But Burnside's music is pure country Delta juke joint blues, heavily rhythm-oriented and played with a slide. It's only recently that he's been hitting full stride with his tours and his music, thanks to the efforts of Fat Possum Records.\n\nIn recent years, the label has issued recordings made by a group of Burnside's peers, including Junior Kimbrough, Dave Thompson and others. Up until the mid-'80s, Burnside was primarily a farmer and fisherman. After getting some attention in the late '60s via folklorists David Evans and George Mitchell (Mitchell recorded him for the Arhoolie label), he recorded for the Vogue, Swingmaster and Highwater record labels.\n\nAlthough he had done short tours, it wasn't until the late '80s that he was invited to perform at several European blues festivals. In 1992, he was featured alongside his friend Junior Kimbrough (whose Holly Spings juke joint Burnside lives next to), in a documentary film, Deep Blues. His debut recording, Bad Luck City, was recorded and released the following year on Fat Possum Records. Burnside has a second record out on the Oxford-based Fat Possum label, Too Bad Jim (1994). These recordings showcase the raw, barebones electric guitar stylings of Burnside, and on both recordings he's accompanied by a small band, which includes his son Dwayne on bass and son-in-law Calvin Jackson on drums, as well as guitarist Kenny Brown. Both recordings also adequately capture the feeling of what it must be like to be in Junior Kimbrough's juke joint, where both men have been playing this kind if raw, unadulterated blues for over 30 years. This is the kind of downhome, backporch blues played today as it has been for many decades.\n\nIn 1996, Burnside teamed with indie-rocker Jon Spencer to cut A Ass Pocket O' Whiskey for the hip Matador label; he returned to Fat Possum in 1998 for the more conventional Come on In. My Black Name A-Ringin' followed a year later and Mississippi Hill Country Blues was released in 2000.\n\n~ Richard Skelly, All Music Guide\n\nTOP\n\nDiscography\n\nAlbumMy Black Name A-Ringin'\n\nGenes 1969/1999\n\nAcoustic solo and duo sessions. Pretty solid stuff.\n\nSound Machine Groove\n\nHighTone 1980/1997\n\nReissue of a 1980 album produced by Dr. David Evans. R.L. is joined by his sons Daniel and Joseph on guitar/bass and brother-in-law Calvin Jackson on drums. Evans wrote some nice liner notes for the rerelease detailing what a typical R.L. gig in this era was like. The solo version of \"Goin' Down South\" is great.\n\nMississippi Hill Country Blues\n\nSwingmaster\n\nContains 19 acoustic tracks recorded mostly in the Netherlands between 1980-1984 with a couple of interjections from Michell's 1967 recordings. Only available as an import, but it has a lot of songs you won't find anywhere else (Miss Maybell, House Up On the Hill, Just Like a Woman, Greyhound Bus Station...). Thanks to Stephen Davidson for providing the cover scan (with autograph!) at left. Click it for a larger version.\n\nPlays and Sings the Mississippi Delta Blues\n\nSwingmaster 1980\n\nAn entirely different set of songs from his Swingmaster CDs. Thanks to Bob Corritore for the information and cover scan.\n\nMississippi Blues\n\nArion 1984/1997\n\nI don't have this one, but I've been told that it was recorded in France and features eleven acoustic songs: Jumper Hanging Out on the Line, Sweet Little Angel Child, Long Haired Doney, Nightmare Blues, Poor Black Mattie, Catfish Blues, Death, Bells, Dust My Broom, Back Luck and Trouble, Rolling and Tumbling, and When My First Wife Quit Me. Liner notes are by Dr. David Evans.\n\nAcoustic Stories\n\nM.C. Records 1988/1997\n\nSolid stuff. This album was recorded in New York City in 1988 with just R.L. and his harmonica player, John Neremberg. Like the title suggests, it's acoustic, so it's a little more reserved than his other works, but still worth a listen.\n\nBad Luck City\n\nFat Possum 1993\n\nI tried to special order this a while back, but it was out of print in the U.S. I do have a couple of songs from it on a Fat Possum promo disc- they sound decent, but not outstanding. Admittedly, this was the very first Fat Possum release, so they didn't have things down pat yet. For his part, label co-founder Matthew Johnson said of the album, \"I don't know if what we had in mind is what we got. But I guess that's how a lot of first times go.\" There is allegedly an import version available. Write Demon Records Ltd, Brentford, Middlesex, TW89HF for more information.\n\nToo Bad Jim\n\nFat Possum 1994\n\nThis is easily my favorite R.L. alrbum. Produced by Robert Palmer, it mixes great originals with Lightnin' Hopkins covers and other standards. \"Shake 'Em On Down\" opens things off with a bang, and \"Goin' Down South\" brings it to a creepy, hypnotic close. Along with Junior Kimbrough's Sad Days, Lonely Nights, it monopolized my CD player for most of 1995.\n\nA Ass Pocket o' Whiskey\n\nMatador/Fat Possum 1996\n\nI didn't get this for a while because I had heard some less-than-positive reviews, but it's actually pretty fun, in a ragged sort of way. R.L. and Kenny Brown are backed up by the Jon Spencer Blues Explosion. It's a great \"turn it up loud when you're driving\" kind of disc, probably not meant for the blues purist. The best explanation of the sound I heard was something like, \"It's Bo Diddley backed up by the Stooges.\"\n\nMr. Wizard\n\nFat Possum/Epitaph 1997\n\nA solid effort in my opinion. Jon Spencer and the boys are along for the ride again, but only on two songs. It's a little more ragged than Too Bad Jim, but still well worth buying.\n\nCome On In\n\nFat Possum/Epitaph 1998\n\nI didn't like this much at first, but I've definitely come around. It contains some new stuff and previously released tunes remixed by Tom Rothrock and Beal Dabbs. Like A Ass Pocket of Whiskey, it's fun to crank up.\n\nWish I Was In Heaven Sitting Down\n\nFat Possum 2000\n\nLike Come On In, this one has some scratching and unusual effects, but it's a little more understated. The title track and \"Hard Time Killing Floor\" are great tunes; the others I'm not 100% sure about yet. If you'd like more info, you can read reviews by Stephen T. Davidson, Dick Houff, and Alan Haworth\n\nWell Well Well\n\nMC Records 2001\n\nI don't own this one yet, but Amazon describes it as a \"fascinating, scattershot collection of tunes and interviews, recorded between 1986 and 1993.\"\n\nSingles\n\nBad Luck City/Jumper Hangin Out On The Line\n\nHigh Water\n\n45 rpm single, now out of print. Credited to R.L. Burnside and the Sound Machine. Thanks to Bob Corritore for the information and cover scan.\n\nRollin' Tumblin'\n\nBong Load 1998\n\nFeatures remixes by Tom Rothrock and Alejandro Rosso: two versions of Rollin' and Tumblin', one of Going Down South, SHT Bug Story, and the original Fat Possum Rollin' and Tumblin'.\n\nGeorgia Women\n\nSympathy for the Record Industry/Fat Possum\n\nHas \"4 Women\" on the B-side.\n\nCompilations\n\nMississippi Delta Blues: Blow My Blues Away Vol. 2\n\nArhoolie 1967\n\nRecorded by George Mitchell, this disc features ten songs from R.L. plus works by Joe Callicott and Houston Stackhouse. The tunes are all solo acoustic numbers, truly great stuff. Well worth the money.\n\nGoing Down South\n\nSwingmaster 1986/1999\n\nRecorded in New Orleans, February 6, 1986. R.L. is featured on five tracks. Ranie Burnette and Johnny Woods handle the rest. I don't own this one, but the sound clips on Swingmaster's site sound pretty good.\n\nDeep Blues\n\nAtlantic/Anxious Records 1992\n\nSoundtrack to the Robert Palmer/Robert Mugge film. Features R.L., Junior Kimbrough, Jack Ownes, etc. R.L.'s tracks are \"Jumper on the Line\" and \"Long Haired Doney.\" Not currently available in the U.S., although I've been told you can order the video from As Seen On TV, 1004 Van Buren Avenue, Oxford MS 38655, phone: (662) 236-7770, fax: (662) 236-7798. Thanks to Nick for this info.\n\nDuwayne Burnside and the Mississippi Mafia: Live at the Mint\n\nLucky 13 Recordings 1999\n\nFrom Blake: \"Duwayne is R.L. son. This was recorded at the Mint in Los Angeles. R.L. is featured on several songs: Well, Well, Well 5:07, Dust My Broom 5:39 and Hoochie Coochie man 18:49. The album has its strong points, but is weakened by a lack of flow that doesn't transfer from the live setting to the CD.\"\n\nForces of Nature Soundtrack\n\nUNI/Dreamworks 1999\n\nRollin' & Tumblin (Remix) is featured in this Sandra Bullock/Ben Affleck romantic comedy. Go figure.\n\nTangled Up In Blues: The Songs of Bob Dylan\n\nHouse of Blues 1999\n\nvarious artist collection where blues and rock artists are featured covering Bob Dylan songs. R.L. performs \"Everything Is Broken\" (Dylan's original is on \"Oh Mercy\"). Other acts include Taj Mahal, The Band, Issac Hayes, Leon Russell, and John Hammond.\n\nadditions from Bob Corritore and Stephen Davidson, to be formatted soon:\n\n* Hightone/HMG 1008 Various Artists/From Mississippi To Chicago 5 songs by R.L in a solo setting\n\n* Hightone/HMG 1009 Bob Corritore's All-Star Blues Sessions - R.L.
