        "text": "Record label\n\nDelta Groove Productions is an American blues record label in Van Nuys, California, United States. The label was founded by Randy Chortkoff (né Rand Jay Chortkoff; 1949–2015), a producer, concert promoter, and harmonica player.\n\nChortkoff's biography\n\n[edit]\n\nChortkoff died on May 5, 2015, while awaiting a liver transplant and sentencing on multiple criminal felony fraud charges, including cheating investors of over $1,400,000 in a phony movie investment scam. In 2016, Chortkoff's co-defendant Sam Braslau was sentenced to seven years in federal prison in Lompoc, California. Co-defendant Stuart Rawitt previously pled guilty and was sentenced to five years in federal prison. Both co-defendants were ordered by the US Court to pay restitution of $1,600,000. In February 2017, the Chortkoff Estate was ordered by the US Court to pay $153,400 in disgorgement and $12,615 in prejudgment interest in the civil matter with the SEC.[citation needed]\n\nOverview and history\n\n[edit]\n\nThe label started with blues by musicians from Los Angeles. Its first release was That Represent Man (2004), the debut album by The Mannish Boys. The label then expanded to other genres. Jackie Payne Steve Edmonson Band's Master of the Game released in 2006 was the label's first release in soul/R&B. The label's releases are newly recorded materials for the most part, but it has also released some albums that were produced by Chortkoff as independent productions and released by the German record label CrossCut (Kirk Fletcher's Shades of Blue and Frank \"Paris Slim\" Goldwasser's bluju).\n\nApart from its own releases, Delta Groove Productions produced Roy Gaines' The First TB Album, released by Black Gold in 2003.\n\nIn 2007, Delta Groove started a new record label, Eclecto Groove Records, as a home and showcase for other musical styles. In June, 2007, Chortkoff hired industry veteran Robert Fitzpatrick (who died in 2010) to become president of Delta Groove Music and Eclecto Groove Records.[1]\n\nSelected artists\n\n[edit]\n\nDelta Groove releases\n\n[edit]\n\nDate No. Artist Title Remarks November 16, 2004 DGPCD100 The Mannish Boys That Represent Man November 16, 2004 DGPCD101 Kirk Fletcher Shades of Blue CrossCut reissue March 22, 2005 DGPCD102 Hollywood Blue Flames Soul Sanctuary reissue March 22, 2005 DGPCD103 Mitch Kashmar Nickels & Dimes July 19, 2005 DGPCD104 Rod Piazza & the Mighty Flyers For The Chosen Who [CD + DVD] November 15, 2005 DGPCD105 The Mannish Boys Live & In Demand February 21, 2006 DGPCD106 John Long Lost & Found June 20, 2006 DGPCD107 Hollywood Blue Flames Road To Rio (w/bonus disc: Larger Than Life by Hollywood Fats Band) [2CD] June 20, 2006 DGPCD108 Lynwood Slim Last Call September 19, 2006 DGPCD109 Mitch Kashmar Wake Up & Worry October 17, 2006 DGPCD110 Jackie Payne Steve Edmonson Band Master of the Game November 21, 2006 DGPCD111 Phantom Blues Band Out of the Shadows November 1, 2006 DGPCD112 Various Artists Road Tested V.1 [Limited Edition] November 1, 2006 DGPCD113 Phantom Blues Band Sneaking' A Peek [5-song EP] February 20, 2007 DGPCD114 Frank \"Paris Slim\" Goldwasser bluju CrossCut reissue February 20, 2007 DGPCD115 Phillip Walker Going Back Home May 22, 2007 DGPCD116 The Mannish Boys Big Plans August 21, 2007 DGPCD117 The Insomniacs Left Coast Blues reissue August 21, 2007 DGPCD118 Rod Piazza & the Mighty Flyers Blues Quartet ThrillVille 2007 DGPCD119 Phantom Blues Band Footprints 2008 DGPCD120 Sean Costello We Can Get Together 2008 DGPCD121 The Legendary Rhythm & Blues Revue (featuring Tommy Castro) Command Performance [live] June 17, 2008 DGPCD122 The Mannish Boys Lowdown Feelin' July 22, 2008 DGPCD123 Jackie Payne Steve Edmonson Band Overnight Sensation 2008 DGPCD124 Bill Sims Jr. and Mark LaVoie American Blues Roots Duo Digital download only August 19, 2008 DGPCD125 Los Fabulocos (featuring Kid Ramos) Los Fabulocos September 23, 2008 DGPCD126 Elvin Bishop The Blues Roll On October 21, 2008 DGPCD127 Cedric Burnside and Lightnin' Malcolm 2 Man Wrecking Crew November 18, 2008 DGPCD128 Mitch Kashmar Live at Labatt February 17, 2009 DGPCD129 Bobby Jones (featuring the Mannish Boys) Comin' Back Hard 2009 DGPCD130 The Insomniacs At Least I'm Not With You 2008 DGPCD131 Various Artists / 3rd Annual Delta Groove All Star Blues Revue Live at Ground Zero, Vol. 1 2008 DGPCD132 Various Artists / 3rd Annual Delta Groove All Star Blues Revue Live at Ground Zero, Vol. 2 2009 DGPCD133 Candye Kane Superhero 2009 DGPCD134 Rod Piazza & the Mighty Flyers Blues Quartet Soul Monster 2009 DGPCD135 Arthur Adams Stomp the Floor 2010 DGPCD136 Hollywood Blue Flames Deep In America (w/bonus disc: Larger Than Life, Vol. 2 by Hollywood Fats Band) [2CD] 2010 DGPCD137 The Mannish Boys Shake For Me: 5 Year Anniversary 2010 DGPCD138 Elvin Bishop Red Dog Speaks 2010 DGPCD139 Bob Corritore and Friends Harmonica Blues 2010 DGPCD140 Mitch Kashmar and The Pontiax 100 Miles To Go reissue 2010 DGPCD141 Lynwood Slim and the Igor Prado Band Brazilian Kicks 2011 DGPCD142 Los Fabulocos (featuring Kid Ramos) Dos 2011 DGPCD143 Tracy Nelson Victim of the Blues 2011 DGPCD144 Elvin Bishop Raisin' Hell Revue (Live on the Legendary Rhythm & Blues Cruise) 2011 DGPCD145 Shawn Pittman Edge of the World 2011 DGPCD146 Terry Hanck Look Out!
