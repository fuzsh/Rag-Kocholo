        "text": "Opened in May of 2015, The Blues Foundation’s Blues Hall of Fame Museum is a Memphis gem for both serious blues fans and casual visitors. With robust exhibits and in-depth history, the museum exposes, educates, and entertains visitors with all that is blues culture while highlighting over 400 inductees in five key categories: Performer, Individual, Album, Single, and Literature.\n\nOur visitors will enjoy 10 individualized galleries with interactive touchscreen displays along with three master databases where they can hear the music, watch videos, and read the stories of each of our inductees. In addition, each gallery houses one-of-a-kind memorabilia to include such iconic pieces as\n\nPee Wee Crayton’s Fender Stratocaster Guitar\n\nDonald “Duck” Dunn’s Lakland Electric Bass\n\nMatt “Guitar” Murphy’s McHugh Guitar\n\nBettye LaVette’s Kennedy Center Honors Performance Outfit\n\nStevie Ray Vaughan’s Performance Kimono\n\nYou will enjoy viewing hard-to-find album covers and photographs, important awards, unique art, musical instruments and costumes, tour jackets, and other special items that can only be seen at The Blues Foundation’s Blues Hall of Fame Museum.\n\nOur upstairs, Legendary Rhythm and Blues Cruise Gallery hosts traveling exhibits that rotate every four months, offering the visitor a new experience every time you walk through our front doors.\n\nThe museum was built through the generosity and support of Blues fans so that it would serve all four components of The Blues Foundation’s mission: preserving history, celebrating excellence, supporting education, and ensuring the future of the music."
