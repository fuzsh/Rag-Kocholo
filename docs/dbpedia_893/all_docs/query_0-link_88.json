        "text": "Smokin' Joe Kubek & Bnois King\n\nROAD DOG'S LIFE (2013)\n\n\"King's vocals are like aged whiskey, smooth and mellow, with a warm glow that spreads throughout your body when you partake.\"  Blues Revue Magazine\n\n\" the intricate interplay between their differing guitar styles is truly impressive \"  Living Blues Magazine\n\n\"Kubek and King bring a full course meal to the dinner table. With this dynamic duo from Dallas you get great songwriting, two distinctive approaches to the guitar and a singer in Bnois King with a voice and vocal style that delivers the message like very few in the modern blues world.\"  Blues Junction\n\nSmokin' Joe Kubek & Bnois King\n\nCLOSE TO THE BONE (2012)\n\nDelta Groove Music is extremely pleased to welcome the dynamic duo of Smokin Joe Kubek and Bnois King to the Delta Groove family. With over two decades of experience together on stages and in studios around the world, and over a dozen major CD releases, Kubek and King bring the essence of Texas blues to Delta Groove. Their debut release on Delta Groove is the all-acoustic Close To The Bone, and features such special guests as fellow Delta Groove artists Big Pete, Shawn Pittman, Kirk Fletcher, Randy Chortkoff, Bob Corritore, Hollywood Blue Flames keyboard man Fred Kaplan, former Red Devils guitarist Paul Size, and others.\n\nSmokin' Joe Kubek & Bnois King\n\nHAVE BLUES WILL TRAVEL (2010)\n\nSmokin' Joe Kubek & Bnois King take another giant step forward. Kubek and King wrote or co-wrote all twelve songs, and, along with their road-tested rhythm section, they ignite a blues fire with enough heat to fuel an all-night party. The chemistry between Kubek's blistering fretwork and King's savvy vocals and unpredictable, multifaceted guitar work creates a roadhouse blend of muscular blues-rock, hip-shaking shuffles and slow-burning blues that is simply impossible to resist. Each song is infused with deep, from-the-heart musicianship, carefully crafted, true-to-life lyrics and delivered with the occasional wry smile. King calls Have Blues, Will Travel the best record the band has ever made.\n\nSmokin' Joe Kubek & Bnois King\n\nMy Heart's In Texas\n\nBlind Pig Records (2006)\n\nThis blazing New Year's Eve performance at the legendary J&J Blues Bar in Forth Worth, Texas is amazingly this veteran duo's first live recording in their 15 year career. Holiday cheer and roadhouse ambiance make for a uniquely satisfying taste of Joe and Bnois' trademark Texas blues. The companion DVD (BPDVD 6007) has a slightly different program than the CD.\n\n\"A rough, raw and above all, soulful example of Lone Star roadhouse blues-rock.\" - Blues Revue\n\nSmokin' Joe Kubek & Bnois King\n\nShow Me The Money\n\nBlind Pig Records (2004)\n\nShow Me the Money is a worthy successor to Joe and Bnois' acclaimed Blind Pig debut, Roadhouse Research. Kubek's flame-throwing guitar work tempered by the finesse of King's accompaniment and smooth vocals remain the bedrock of a powerful, irresistible combination. Or, as the Minneapolis Star-Tribune put it, \"a rare blend of hot guitars and cool savvy, that does, indeed, smoke.\"\n\nSmokin' Joe Kubek & Bnois King\n\nServed Up Texas Style: The Best of Rounder Records Released 10/04/2005\n\nServed Up Texas Style offers 15 choice cuts of highly energized Texas guitar blues by the Smokin' Joe Kubek Band featuring Bnois King - a blues fan's dream selection all on one platter. Included are two unreleased tracks from the sessions that produced their best-selling Texas Cadillac album, and a special guest appearance by blues legend Little Milton. Spanning ten years and seven albums, this is the one and only quintessential Smokin' Joe Kubek Band collection.\n\nSmokin' Joe Kubek & Bnois King\n\nTake Your Best Shot\n\nRounder Records 01/01/1998\n\n\"In the wake of the epochal Stevie Ray Vaughan, overamplified `white guy' Stratocaster blues has become one of the most overworked subgenres in pop music. But the contrast between Kubek's hot-wired axe and Bnois King's understated street-cool vocals puts this combo in a category of its own.\" --Dan Emerson, Request The Texas blues tradition, as carved by such ax-wielders as Freddie King, T-Bone Walker and Lightnin' Hopkins, is a spectacularly rich one. But the Smokin' Joe Kubek Band has staked their claim in a country of pioneers with all the confidence, swagger and bluster of their heroes, hewing out their own diamond-hard hunk of the Texas rock. Take Your Best Shot is the band's sixth record for Bullseye. Smokin' Joe and Bnois King say it's their best!\n\nThe Smokin' Joe Kubek & Bnois King\n\nGot My Mind Back\n\nRounder Records 01/01/1996\n\n\"They don't call him 'Smokin' ' for nothin'. Smokin' Joe Kubek slings a mighty hot guitar. Put that together with the hurt-so-good vocals of Bnois King and you have just the right recipe for the blues -- Texas style.\" --Chris Flisher, CD Review The Texas blues tradition -- as carved by such ax-wielders as Freddie King, Al \"TNT\" Braggs, Ernie Johnson and Little Joe Blue -- is a spectacularly rich one. But the Smokin' Joe Kubek Band has staked their claim in a country of pioneers with all the confidence, swagger and bluster of their heroes, hewing out their own diamond-hard hunk of the Texas rock. Got My Mind Back is the band's fifth record for Bullseye Blues. Smokin' Joe and Bnois King say it's their best.\n\nThe Smokin' Joe Kubek & Bnois King\n\nTexas Cadillac\n\nRounder Records Released 01/01/1994\n\nWhat you hear on Smokin' Joe Kubek's third Bullseye Blues album is what you get live: Smokin' Joe and Bnois King bouncing guitar riffs back and forth -- Bnois preaching the blues and a rock-solid, road-tested rhythm section that knows its way around a shuffle. . . . With each successive album, and the extensive national touring that has resulted, Joe, Bnois and the band have sharpened their attack and tightened their material. . . . It creates a sound so big, it could only come from Texas! --from liner notes by Jake Guralnick\n\nThe Smokin' Joe Kubek & Bnois King\n\nChain Smokin' Texas Style\n\nRounder Records Released 01/01/1992\n\nSmokin' Joe Kubek, Bnois King and company keep on delivering the goods on their second Bullseye Blues album -- their own brand of Texas blues that starts hot and stays hot. Kubek grew up in the same region of Dallas as the Vaughan Brothers, and played in every nook and cranny of the Texas blues scene, serving his apprenticeship in the bands of Freddie King and Al \"TNT\" Braggs.\n\nThe Smokin' Joe Kubek & Bnois King\n\nSteppin' Out Texas Style\n\nRounder Records (1991)\n\nThe debut recording of a blues band that's been in all the right places -- hailing from Texas, discovered in Memphis, recorded in New Orleans. Smokin' Joe learned his trade from Freddy King, Albert King, John Lee Hooker and Little Joe Blue. Bnois King can just about match Joe lick for lick, and his vocals are the genuine article, right out of Otis Rush."
