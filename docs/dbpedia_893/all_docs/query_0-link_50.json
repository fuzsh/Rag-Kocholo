        "text": "Crawlin’ Kingsnake is the fourth collaboration album for John Primer and Bob Corritore, two artists who have always had the Chicago spark. It was evident on their first release together of 2013 and on each release since.\n\nBut with this particular album, a new height has been achieved: a simultaneous, rocking forcefulness, while also exhibiting an uninhibited, gliding easiness. Crawlin’ Kingsnake also features arguably the best possible A team for Chicago blues! With Bob Stroger on the bass, Jimi Primetime Smith on second Guitar, Anthony Geraci on the piano, and Wes Starr on drums, this band sounds like the Muddy Waters band of decades ago!\n\nBoth Primer and Corritore appear at the top of their game, with Primer recently inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame, as well as numerous award wins, and a Grammy nomination. Likewise, Corritore has been actively hitting the European festival circuit, released five critically acclaimed albums in 2023, was the subject of numerous articles and received numerous nominations, and a number of wins. But all of that is secondary to what happens in the studio, and what you have in your hand is a powerful straight-ahead album of sacred Chicago blues done by two artists who have devoted their entire lives to the purity of the blues.\n\nBob Corritore is one of the most active and highly regarded blues harmonica players on the scene today. His style passionately carries forward the old school of playing that Corritore learned as a young man directly from many of original pioneers of Chicago Blues. His sympathetic, yet fiery harmonica playing is featured on over 100 releases to date, on labels such as VizzTone, Delta Groove, Delmark, HighTone, HMG, Blue Witch, Blind Pig, Earwig, Ruf, Putumayo and many others. Many of Bob’s acclaimed releases have been nominated or winners for various Handy, Grammy, Living Blues, Blues Music Awards and Blues Blast Music Awards. Bob is also widely recognized for his many roles in the blues, as band leader, club owner, record producer, radio show host, arts foundation founder, and occasional writer. His website and his weekly e-newsletter reflect a life thoroughly invested in the blues.\n\nLiving legend John Primer has undisputedly helped build the sound and style of Chicago blues as we know it today. The echoes of tradition bellowing from the birthplaces he played — such as Maxwell Street, Theresa’s, Checkerboard and Rosa’s Lounges — pulse from every chord in his fingers today.\n\nIn case you missed it, the title track breathes new life into this blues classic, reaching deep into the tradition while at the same time infusing vibrant energy. No doubt a launching pad for great solos, but it’s Primer’s Mississippi-drenched vocals that simply steal the show."
