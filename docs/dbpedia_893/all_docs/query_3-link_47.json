        "text": "Dan Bubien & the Delta Struts put a contemporary spin on soulful roots music. Driven by the dynamic guitar playing duo of Shawn Mazzei and Dan Bubien, along with Bubien’s soulful gritty vocals. Their signature sound is highlighted by the precision playing and deep toned-full sound of drummer Mark Pollera and glued together by Christian Caputo’s steady, groove oriented bass playing. They are set to release their first studio album together as a band in early spring of 2019 and Dan’s 3rd album in the past 5 years.\n\nDan Bubien is a singer/songwriter/guitarist born and raised in the small steel town of Aliquippa, Pennsylvania. This rust belt town Northwest of Pittsburgh, has been the launching pad for a career that spans over two decades now culminating with his current band The Delta Struts.\n\nDan’s professional career began in his mid-teens working along side veteran musicians on the local and regional club circuit of Southwest PA. Along the way, Dan founded and recorded with The Sun Kings releasing Rub It In (2006) while continuing to hone his skills as a front man and songwriter. As a solo artist, Dan released “Empty Roads” in 2013 with the help of four-time Grammy Award Winning Producer/Engineer Jay Dudt of Audible Images Studios. Capitalizing on his previous success with “Empty Roads”, Dan released his second solo album in August of 2016 entitled “Grinding These Gears”. Self-produced and recorded by legendary Pittsburgh musician Joe Munroe “Grinding These Gears” achieved critical acclaim and charted on the Blues/Rock and World Wide blues album charts respectively.\n\nFast forward to 2017 and the newest incarnation of Dan’s vision has culminated in the creation of Dan Bubien and The Delta Struts. Gritty and honest, yet always soulful one might think this band hails from a place much further south than the suburbs of northwest Pittsburgh. Dan is constantly refining and redefining his craft using a wide palette of tones and textures, sounds and styles, that express a heart-felt love of all things music. Rooted in soul, and versed in a style that harkens back to the days of a classic STAX recording, Dan Bubien and The Delta Struts consistently break new ground with an eclectic spin on the collective music they make. Backed by the stellar guitar playing of Shawn Mazzei and anchored by rhythm section veterans Mark Pollera (Drums) and Christian Caputo (Bass) The Delta Struts chart a course that begins and ends with the music always being the first priority. After spending much of 2018 recording what was to become “Thieves and Yesterdays” Dan Bubien and The Delta Struts plan on a release date of February 1st and a tour starting in Nashville at the end of March. Check our website for up to date information and reviews about “Thieves and Yesterday’s” as well as updates from the road beginning in March.\n\nFormed in 2016, Smilo and the Ghost have been delivering hard-driving, old-time influenced folk-rock to crowds around the Northeast. Their debut album, Ghost Writers, was voted one of the “Top Three Albums of 2018” by the Erie Reader. Since then, Smilo and the Ghost have opened for national acts like Grammy Award Winning country duo Dan + Shay and alt-rock legends 10,000 Maniacs.\n\nThe band’s recording and performing personnel have included a “who’s who” of regional talent, currently condensed down to the core lineup:\n\nTyler Smilo – Guitar, Vocals\n\nAdam McKillip – Mandolin, Vocals\n\nJassen Wilber – Bass Guitar\n\nDominick DeCecco- Banjo, Vocals\n\nSmilo’s emotionally charged lyrics and vocals are backed up by the virtuosity of Wilber (who has toured the world with American blues guitarist Bernard Allison) and McKillip. Their setlist moves between gritty, hard-luck foot stompers like “Nothing’s Changed” and “Big Guns” to triumphant ballads like “Save Me” and “There’s Nothing Left.” All of which are highlights of Smilo & the Ghost live shows. The band’s songs share Americana country/rock DNA with Trampled by Turtles, Dawes, and Ryan Bingham, while maintaining a voice all their own. The recent addition of DeCecco on banjo has allowed for a deeper exploration of the band’s bluegrass and country chops. These old-timey roots are on full display in their highly-anticipated album, Fingers Crossed and Godspeed, which has been selected as one of Erie Reader’s “Top Three Albums of 2021.” The band isn’t sitting still, though, also recording a live album in early 2022. Smilo and the Ghost combine songs meant for singing and dancing with charismatic, high-energy performing on stage. They’re as comfortable on the main stage as they are in the corner of a local bar and shouldn’t be missed at either venue.\n\n“This band is therapy for me to bring myself back to being a better person, and I hope people come along with me,” says powerhouse singer Clinton Clegg of The Commonheart. The testimonial begins on August 16th when the 9-piece band issues its most potent and purposeful dose of grittily redemptive rock n’ soul, its sophomore album, Pressure (Jullian Records).\n\nClinton didn’t grow up in a Baptist church, and his soul machine of a band isn’t pushing religion. Live and in the studio, the Pittsburgh-based collective is offering feel-good positivity, Golden Rule messaging, and sweat-soaked performances that nimbly ease through blues, vintage soul, and rock.\n\nThe nonet is bonded by familial-like ties and a desire to foster spiritual uplift. Among its ranks are female backup singers, drums, bass, guitar, a horn section, and keyboards. Out front is Clinton, a lightning bolt charismatic front man with dynamically expressive pipes that effortlessly traverse bluesy pleading, and honeyed balladeering. Onstage and in the studio, Clinton evokes B.B. King, Al Green, Otis Redding, and Sam Cooke.\n\nThe Commonheart is known to have transformative powers. Case in point is the band’s own singer. During one gig, while singing “Do Right” from Pressure, Clinton experienced a revelation.\n\n“Seeing the audience’s reaction to the positivity in that song made me feel like I was giving them something they may need.” He pauses thoughtfully, and then continues: “You know blues music is sad as hell, but it makes you feel good. I thought maybe my bad stories could make people feel good, and I could bring a little bit of love to the show.”\n\nPreviously, Clinton was in an eclectic indie band searching for some semblance of artistic focus. He had grown up loving B.B. King and soul music, and recognized the strength of his raspy emotive voice. After some soul searching, he and that band’s drummer decided to do a back-to-basics band centered around Clinton’s singing and a vintage R&B-informed aesthetic. At first the band’s name was a casual variant of The Commonwealth, as in “The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania,” but the moniker later accrued significance as the band began to explore the pent-emotionality inherent in its gospel-tinged tunes.\n\nThe Commonheart’s latest album, Pressure, is both rugged and refined. The 10-song album showcases raw-nerve soul musicianship pristinely recorded. The opening track boasts soulful sandpaper-y lead vocals, swoops of cosmic slide guitar, a driving Sly Stone groove, and rousing female backup vocals. It’s an up-against-a-wall tune about making a living while raising a family, and it speaks to the album’s title. The bluesy ballad title track, replete with pleading emotive vocals, drips yearning and melancholy redemption. “That’s about the daily grind—what it takes to maintain important relationships while you’re away from home, driving thousands of miles in van to pursue a dream,” Clinton confesses.\n\nA spirit of a new-day optimism courses through the aptly titled “Different Man.” The song soars with stirring group backup vocals punctuated by Clinton’s vulnerable confessions. It’s a rousing and uplifting slice of R&B brimming with warm organs, clipped soul-guitar chanks, and triumphant horn melodies. “That song is about begging for a second chance, and building something beautiful after a sordid past,” Clinton reveals.\n\nPressure is an album by a band on a mission. “We are willing to take risks and to go at any lengths for this band,” Clinton says affirmatively. “We are ready to spread positivity and make a stretch of this thing.”\n\nNeed Lodging?\n\nUpgrade your concert experience by booking a room at our partner hotels to receive FREE shuttle service!

Yes, there is something familiar there, the indefinable chemistry that hooked a legion of fans the first time around, but there is a new-found depth, a spark of wisdom, a heightened awareness. The result is a sound that is as it was, only more so, and then some.\n\nThe Healing Power of Music!\n\nMy Story:\n\nI’ve been doing this a long time now… and it has not been easy. In fact, it’s been a wild journey full of extreme ups and downs, highs and lows that I can’t really even explain or begin to digest. It’s been more like a beautiful blur… of amazing people and experiences and sights that goes beyond this world and many of the mundane normal things that we all must endure. It’s been truly spiritual. And I wouldn’t trade a second of it.\n\nMy Bio:\n\nI am an american singer-songwriter and have released 9 studio albums, played over 1,000 gigs, traveled all over the country (either with my bands or solo), and my music is heard worldwide on Spotify, Pandora, iTunes, YouTube, and anywhere else music is streamed…\n\nWhy:\n\nMy mission: To bring peaceful, healing music into the world. I’ve seen firsthand how music can make a difference in people’s lives. How hearing just the right song at just the right time can take someone somewhere else and transport them to a more peaceful, state-of-mind. In my musical journey as both a touring artist and as an internet musician I have seen how this transformation can take place and truly change people’s lives for the better. It can help us overcome the many obstacles of our daily lives, the painful experiences from our past, and the constant grind of our highly ambitious lifestyles. And it can help us have HOPE FOR THE FUTURE!\n\nSincerely,\n\n-Kev\n\nA co-headline concert featuring two Big Rail favorites to cap off our Homebrew fest!\n\nAbout Meeting of Important People\n\nMeeting of Important People is a rock-and-roll-band from Pittsburgh, PA., led by songwriter and singer Josh Verbanets, now playing in support of their new 2024 album release ‘MOIPsgiving!’~ the band’s 4th LP. MOIP is widely known for its spirited live performances over the past two decades, and has gained national acclaim with a body of music showcasing elements of pop, garage-rock, folk influence, and anthemic twists-and-turns.\n\nTwo MOIP albums have been selected as WYEP-FM Hometown Releases of the Year (their 2009 self-titled debut, as well as 2016 album TROIKA); the band has starred in a viral cardboard city music video, and has shared the stage with renowned artists such as Ok Go, The Secret Machines, David Bazan, Flamin’ Groovies, Eve6, Dar Williams, and Dean & Britta. Their debut album received vinyl re-release in 2011 by legendary garage label Get Hip, and many MOIP songs have been featured on E’s KEEPING UP WITH THE KARDASHIANS, MTV’s TEEN MOM, THE REAL WORLD, and JERSEY SHORE, and CBS’ THE GHOST WHISPERER, among others– if you listened hard enough.\n\nMOIP promises to keep the loud parts loud, the pretty parts pretty, and the people happy.\n\nAbout Wine & Spirit\n\n15 years of rock n roll!\n\nWine & Spirit‘s 3rd album “Smiley Street” is now available everywhere!\n\nBorn from the tradition of Bluegrass jams and potlucks, The Plate Scrapers — Derek Kretzer (banjo), Andrew Jordan (guitar), Robbie Mann (fiddle), Jody Mosser (dobro), and Kevin Johnson (bass) — have been putting in the work and showcasing their love for the genre since 2014. They have since released 3 studio albums, 3 live albums, and have toured relentlessly up and down the east coast and into the midwest. In 2019, they won the Podunk Bluegrass Telefunken Band Contest. They have been featured on WAMU Bluegrass Country Radio, performed as an IBMA Official Showcase artist, and their latest release, Destination Horizon (2020) debuted at #9 on the Bluegrass Album Billboard charts with rave reviews from Bluegrass Today.\n\nAs a band that strives to maintain a healthy equilibrium between their diverse musical backgrounds and the traditional Appalachian sounds, they have wowed audiences across the entire spectrum. This progressively minded Bluegrass act truly feels at home on any stage. They’ve provided direct support for bluegrass legends such as The Seldom Scene, Frank Solivan and Dirty Kitchen, and Larry Keel. On the other side of that coin, they aren’t afraid to get weird at a late night festival slot and have become well known for their tastefully balanced and refreshingly diverse song-writing. Catch their live show and you’ll be sure to receive a full helping of hard-driving bluegrass favorites and heart-wrenching country ballads. Dig into their recorded originals, however, and you’ll find tracks ranging from thoughtful folk lyricism to gritty tales of harrowing adventure.\n\n​\n\nThe Plate Scrapers passion for bluegrass and performing shines thru their music and performances. Such is evident in their musical prowess and creative chemistry on stage, guaranteeing a unique and immersive experience each time. The band continues to be fueled by loyal fans and an unrelenting drive to continue moving forward…casually.\n\nDan Bubien & the Delta Struts put a contemporary spin on soulful roots music. Driven by the dynamic guitar playing duo of Shawn Mazzei and Dan Bubien, along with Bubien’s soulful gritty vocals. Their signature sound is highlighted by the precision playing and deep toned-full sound of drummer Mark Pollera and glued together by Christian Caputo’s steady, groove oriented bass playing.

Think bluesy Zeppelin-esqe bombast, Santana style percussion with wild Avett Brothers energy.\n\nAt a Sun King show, you can expect to dance, sweat and have the time of your life.\n\nThe band’s music has garnered radio airplay throughout the US and Canada, and has appeared on Billboard’s Americana chart multiple times.\n\nThe band plays regionally at festivals and clubs throughout the mid-atlantic and have opened for 10,000 Maniacs, Donovan’s former band Rusted Root and many others.\n\nJim Donovan, the band’s founder and writer brings almost three decades of experience to the Sun King Warriors. As a member of the popular 90’s band Rusted Root, he helped shaped the group’s sound and toured with legendary including The Grateful Dead, members of Led Zeppelin, Carlos Santana and the Allman Brothers.\n\nHe also co-authored the band’s biggest hit, “Send Me on My Way,” which has been streamed over 100 million times on Spotify and used as the wakeup music for NASA’s Mars rover.\n\nPress quotes:\n\n“Jim Donovan and Sun King Warriors are one of the most eclectic and exciting bands to come out in some time…” -The Washington Times\n\n“Sun King Warriors channel unabashed enthusiasm into a series of songs that are both rowdy and rejuvenating…” -Relix Magazine\n\nRic Robertson is an American original, pulling influences from the greats that came before, but wholly responsible for creating his own creative universe. Robertson’s voice and lyrics hold a soft Southern burr, a Zen acceptance of humanity’s failings, and, most importantly, a sense of pure playfulness in the music. This is John Prine by way of New Orleans, Harry Nilsson in a Nudie suit, a stoned Dr. John lost in Nashville, Bill Monroe on mushrooms listening to Bessie Smith. Step into his boundlessly creative multi-verse and you’ll find nothing short of American songbook excellence. When Ric’s not writing songs or playing music, his polymath personality fills time learning claymation, filmmaking, playing with puppets, learning pedal steel… He’s relentlessly creative. Robertson is the musician’s musician, as testified by the fact that he’s continuously in-demand as a touring bandmate, having played and recorded with The Wood Brothers, Rhiannon Giddens, Lucius, Sarah Jarosz, David Grisman, Sierra Ferrell, Dirk Powell, Sam Grisman Project, and countless others. A guest list this large and varied is a testament to Robertson’s easygoing musicianship. He’s as comfortable backing up another artist onstage as he is leading his own band, and throughout he anchors his creativity in a sense of playful collaboration.\n\nHis last album, Carolina Child, out now on Free Dirt Records, was Robertson’s break-out moment, a fully-fledged exploration of madcap ideas and creative anarchy, was produced by Dan Molad of Lucius, and features Jess Wolfe and Holly Laessig from Lucius plus a whole host of Robertson’s friends and colleagues: Alex Hargreaves ( Kacey Musgraves, Billy Strings, Steve Martin), Sam Fribush (Charlie Hunter, Hiss Golden Messenger), Nick Falk (Herbie Hancock), Eddie Barbash (Jon Batiste, Cory Wong), Oliver Wood of The Wood Brothers, Kai Welch (Kacey Musgraves, Abigail Washburn) , Logan Ledger, and Dori Freeman. His brand new forthcoming album, “Choices and Chains” (set for release in July 2024), includes many of the same cast of characters plus special features from Grammy winning songstress Sarah Jarosz and the quickly rising star and powerhouse vocalist Sierra Ferrell. Take time to dive in, and you’ll find Robertson’s songs draw inspiration from the fragility of our inner lives, but also from the small moments packed with meaning that surround us. Listen. Go Deep. Enjoy!\n\nBig Rail Brewing X Sprague Farm!!\n\n*We’re teaming up with Sprague Farm for another concert inside their Beer Hall Pavillion. Big Rail beer selections will be available for purchase.\n\n*$5 cover at the door. All money collected at the door is used to help pay for entertainment costs. No outside alcohol permitted.\n\n*Open at 5pm\n\n*Music starts 6pm\n\n…………………………………………………………….\n\nUncle Ben’s Remedy\n\nRoots grow deep in fertile soil. The sound of Uncle Ben’s Remedy is rooted in the small towns of western New York, where community still matters and music is a part of every event. The boys learned to play and sing in this small town atmosphere, giving their music the honest, back porch feel of the country music they love. Uncle Ben’s Remedy is Ben Westlund, Harmony Griffin, Shawn Huestis, Brendan O’Connor and Jimmy Royce, playing all sorts of traditional and rock n’ roll instruments and stomping the floors; all while singing their hearts out in service to the song.\n\nAvailable on iTunes and Google Play and available for streaming on RDIO, Spotify and other outlets, the band released their debut EP “Yesterday’s Clothes” in 2015 and followed by releasing their full length album, “Not Far From the Tree” in April of 2016. Spurred on by local airplay of their single “Fire in the Field” on Buffalo’s Country, Classic Rock, and Alternative stations, UBR quickly sold the first 2500 copies of their record out of their converted school bus, playing every small town and honky-tonk they could find.\n\nUBR won the Summer 2014 Battle of the Bands at the Canalside Concert Series in Buffalo before taking the 2015 Battle of Original Music (BOOM) competition, which landed them a slot at the sold out Kerfuffle on the Lake. In 2017 UBR piled in the bus and hit the festival circuit, including headlining the annual Sportsmen’s Americana Festival and the opening of the Great Blue Heron Music Festival. A finalist in the national Taste of Country Riser contest, UBR brought a huge crowd, filling the venue to capacity with chanting for the band that lasted long after the final notes of their raucous performance.\n\ntheCAUSE is a band consisting of 5 Pittsburgh musicians who have all been around the proverbial block. Playing tunes from Grateful Dead, Phish, The Beatles, Bob Dylan and MORE, including some very tasty originals, theCAUSE packs a punch while still paying close attention to the delicate touch. The players are Eric “Pappy” Weingrad on guitar and vocals (Double Dose, Pappy’s Blues Junction), David Tauberg on bass and vocals (Powers Run Band, Hard to Handle, Cherylann Hawk), Mike South on drums (Left for Dead, Sticky, West Park Road) and, joining us in 2008, Pittsburgh blues veteran Jill Paone Simmons brings a whole new dimension to theCAUSE on vocals and continues to rock with us today. Jill also fronts the all-female Dead band Brown Eyed Women . Michael Cerveris is our permanent part time member playing keyboards (when he doesn’t have commitments with his other great band the Sun Champs)\n\ntheCAUSE also has had the pleasure in 2012 and 2014 of having guitarist Steve Kimock join us on stage and in 2013, 2015 ,2016 ,2017, 2018,2019, 2022 and 2023 Jeff Mattson of Dark Star Orchestra spent an evening jamming with theCAUSE! Lisa Ann Mackey from Dark Star Orchestra sang with us in 2017 ,2018, 2019, 2022 and 2023\n\nWe are beginning the practice of performing an annual show where we pick a Grateful Dead concert from 1965-1995 and attempt to recreate the entire setlist. This has, of course been done by countless Grateful Dead cover bands, and we figured once a year would be just fine for us. These shows will be announced about a week or two before the performance and, in true fashion, the show’s original date will not be announced until we finish playing it (or someone guesses correctly while we’re playing!)\n\nAlso, you will see theCAUSE appear as REUBEN’S PAINTED MANDOLIN once or twice a year. When we announce a show under this monicker, prepare yourself for a full evening of material from the JERRY GARCIA BAND repertoire. It’s always a great time."
