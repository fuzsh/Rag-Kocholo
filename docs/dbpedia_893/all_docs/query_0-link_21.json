        "text": "The brand new Delta Groove Music release entitled, House Party at Big Jonâs, might appear to be the big coming out party for young Jon Atkinson. It is actually Atkinsonâs third CD under his own name. This outstanding release comes on the heels of 2015âs Back Down South and 2014âs Boogie With You Baby, both on the Bluebeat Music label.\n\nNow Delta Groove Music is releasing House Party at Big Jonâs in conjunction with the release of John Longâs Stand Your Ground. Both albums are being marketed under the banner, âUncompromising Blues, No Apologies.â It seems like for the most part the other major blues labels are putting out material which often sounds like the music has been pre-fabricated in a sterile laboratory by a bunch of marketing strategists trying to impress a focus group of hearing impaired Neanderthals with Peter Pan Syndrome. ï»¿\n\nI applaud Jeff Fleenor of Delta Groove Music for following his heart and soul and going against the popular trend which seems afraid of presenting blues music to the public. Most in his position prefer to pander to the watered-down, blues-light, adult contemporary crowd. Â\n\nHouse Party at Big Jonâs is a big portion of gut bucket, electric blues which will remind listeners why they fell in love with this music in the first place.\n\nIn 1988 Atkinson was born into a digital, cyber world which held no interest for a person who is a throwback to another age. His obsession with the blues took hold while still a youngster and led him on a quest to play with the modern masters. However, it was the old timers lining up to play with him. Â\n\nKim Wilson, who immediately took Jon under his wing and into his Blues All-Stars, put it this way, âJon is one of the only guys doing it the right way.Â He knows the music. He knows the gist of it and understands the soul of the music.â\n\nSoon Jon would join that elite fraternity known as Bob Corritoreâs Rhythm Room All-Stars.\n\nThirty five years ago Corritore, a Chicago blues man, relocated to Phoenix, Arizona, and brought with him the blues from the windy city. He not only opened the Rhythm Room, an oasis of cool in the hot Sonoran desert, but a recording studio as well. It is where he has made a series of award winning albums Â which feature Bobâs muscular blues harp in support of this generationâs blues masters as well as the greats who are as old to him as as he is to Big Jon Atkinson.\n\nLast year Corritore went to Jonâs studio in San Diego. Bob said of Big Jon, âJonâs approach to the blues extends right into his recording studio. He records on vintage equipment just like it was recorded back in the old days. What you end up with is an honest performance with that natural saturation and warmth that makes for a beautiful sounding record.â He went on to say, âThis is an example of the beauty and natural camaraderie that the blues inspires. Iâve been doing this a long time and here I am learning from a man who is half my age.â\n\nAs far as Bobâs harp playing is concerned, Jon said, âBobâs playing on this record is the best of his career.â\n\nJoining Jon and Bob is yet a third generation of musicians who make special guest appearances on House Party at Big Jonâs.Â They are vocalists Dave Riley, Alabama Mike, Willie Buck and Tomcat Courtney. They, along with Big Jon, put their own vocal spin and inject their unique personalities into a wonderful sixteen song mix of originals and some interesting covers. As Corritore points out, âThere is, in some cases, a fifty to sixty year age differential between many of the musicians on this record. This speaks directly to the beautiful spirit of the blues that transcends the generations.âÂ Â Â\n\nEverywhere you go there are people who LOVE the blues and are quick to mention how passionate they are for this brand of music. It is generally understood that they just donât make records like they used to and it is hard to find authentic sounding blues these days. Delta Groove Music has the answer. It is House Party at Big Jonâs.\n\nIt is what blues fans have been waiting for. It is an old school, modern masterpiece that will sit side by side with all of those âdesert island discsâ that are so universally cherished. House Party at Big Jonâs is an indispensible addition to any blues library.\n\nThis CD receives my highest recommendation and is an early contender for BLUES JUNCTION Productionsâ Album of the Year.\n\nHouse Party at Big Jonâs scheduled release date is May 20, 2016. It will be available at Charlie Langeâs Bluebeat Music booth at the Doheny Blues Festival in Dana Point, California, taking place on May 21st and 22nd. You can purchase a copy of House Party at Big Jonâs directly from Big Jon as he will be right there in the Bluebeat Music booth on both days of the festival.
