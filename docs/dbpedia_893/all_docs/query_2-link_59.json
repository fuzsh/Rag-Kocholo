        "text": "John Primer has been an icon on the Chicago Blues music scene for decades. His searing guitar work and soulful vocals have defined his unique musical interpretation of the electric Blues throughout his illustrious career. John Primer stands out in a world full of great musicians for his unique style and uncommon grace as a guitarist, bandleader, and vocalist. Bob Corritore is one of the most active and highly regarded blues harmonica players on the scene today. His style passionately carries forward the old school of playing that Corritore learned as a young man directly from many of original pioneers of Chicago Blues. His sympathetic, yet fiery harmonica playing is featured on many Blues Award-winning efforts and an artist of note on over 50 releases to date. He is one of the finest and most sought after harmonica players in the world today. Together Primer and Corritore present a towering Blues presence, and in unison, the power of their blues is unstoppable."
