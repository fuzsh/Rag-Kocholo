        "text": "This album features two of the brightest talents toiling in the blues field today. Both Mikes are accomplished musicians and have been performing for many years even thought they are both relatively young. Here they mine the fertile ground of Chicagoâs West Sideâs soulful blues scene of the 1960âs, but do so with original ideas and songs. Think Ronnie Earl meets Magic Sam. The albumâs title is an homage to the famous Otis Rush album Right Place, Wrong Time. However, the two Mikes are definitely in the right place at the right time. Oh, and as far as the right time is concerned, this wonderful Delta Groove Music release will be out on April 21st. The two Mikes will also be playing at the upcoming Doheny Blues Festival.ï»¿\n\nBob Corritore returns to his familiar musical stomping grounds of Chicagoâs south side. He again picks up John Primer and takes him for a ride on some well traveled pavement. Primerâs long association with Magic Slim is very apparent. It seems the spirit of Morris Holt aka Magic Slim is oozing out all over this album. Backed by the late Barrelhouse Chuck, Henry Gray, Big Jon Atkinson, Troy Sandow, Patrick Rynn, Chris James and Brian Fahey they play what Charlie Lange calls, âstompinâ shuffles, dance floor packers and treacherous slow blues.â Bob and John, along with Henry Gray and Big Jon Atkinson, will also be performing at the upcoming Doheny Blues Festival. ï»¿\n\nThis brand new offering by guitarist Billy Flynn is a very generous 17 track, almost 70 minutes worth of guitar-centric blues which offers literally something for everybody. This CD, Flynnâs tenth solo outing and the first (believe it or not) on the Delmark Records label, has the consummate side man flexing his prodigious chops in several different directions. It seems that there is literally nothing Flynn canât do on guitar and do it better than just about anybody. Traditional as well as contemporary sounds fill this ambitious CD that features sixteen original tunes written by Flynn. He also plays harp, percussion and sings on Lonesome Highway. ï»¿\n\nIt has been twenty years since the neo-swing movement came and went. Now, after all this time singer Adrianna Marie comes blasting out of the gate with a full throttle swing album sans the âneo.â Produced by Duke Robillard, this isnât a bunch of punk or rockabilly musicians trying to latch onto the flavor of the month, but serious players who have virtually lived in the genre for their entire careers. One of the distinguishing characteristics of this album is the use of original material to go along with some creative interpretations of Johnny Otis, Duke Ellington, T-Bone Walker and others. Congratulations to Adrianna Marie for this well conceived and executed foray into this sub-genre of American music. (Click here for a full album review of this CD in this monthâs edition of BLUES JUNCTON.) Adrianna and her fine band will also be performing this year at the Doheny Blues Festival.ï»¿\n\nThis 18 year old Texanâs debut album represents a true beacon on the blues horizon. Original songs highlight this wonderful set. This album produced by Billy Horton at his Fort Horton Studios in Wyldwood, Texas is a real revelation for those (like me) that hadnât followed the career of this young talent. He is backed by a wonderful band of veterans which includes sax giant Doug James. Jimmie Vaughan even guests on two tracks. This release might put listeners in mind of those early Nick Curran records put out on the Texas Jamboree label. Dylan is mature beyond his years and if this CD is any indication, he will be making compelling music for years to come. Dylan was the subject of our Monthly Artist feature in the March edition of BLUES JUNCTION. His interview can be found in the Archive section of our site. ï»¿\n\nFrench singer and harp player Mo Al Jaz creates a faithful rendition of the Best of Little Walter release complete with similar artwork and label design. The band plays true to the stripped down sound of the Aces and Mo plays it straight on the harmonica. Â Mixed by Danny Michel with encouragement from Big Jon Atkinson, this release will appeal to Chicago harp lovers.Â - C.L. ï»¿"
