        "text": "Harmonica player/producer Bob Corritore lovingly assembled this collection of old school down home Southern blues and juke joint dance numbers, the rough-edged predecessors to modern Chicago Blues, all recorded in Phoenix, Arizona between 1995 and 2012 and drawn from Bob's vast vault of recordings. When the 25-year-old Bob Coritore moved from Chicago to Phoenix in 1981, he was soon joined by old friend Louisiana Red, and before long they were playing all over town. Bob started a weekly blues radio show, and in 1991 he opened the now legendary blues club the Rhythm Room. He would book his favorite blues artists at the club and arrange a recording session, capturing numerous amazing performances, now available via Bob's 'From The Vaults' series. This album features exuberant performances by Honeyboy Edwards, T-Model Ford, Henry Townsend, Big Jack Johnson, Robert 'Bilbo' Walker, Smokey Wilson, Tomcat Courtney, Dave Riley, Pecan Porter, and Al Garrett.\n\nTracks\n\n1~1~01 Rooster Blues\n\n1~2~02 Clara Mae\n\n1~3~03 Mean Old Frisco\n\n1~4~04 Nothing But Blues\n\n1~5~05 Didn't Know What I'm Gonna Do\n\n1~6~06 Still A Fool\n\n1~7~07 Baby Baby Baby\n\n1~8~08 Take A Little Walk With Me\n\n1~9~09 Let's Work Together\n\n1~10~10 My Money Dun Run Out\n\n1~11~11 Home In Chicago\n\n1~12~12 Asked For Water\n\n1~13~13 Blue Bird Blues\n\nDetails\n\nFormat: CD\n\nArtist: Bob Corritore\n\nRelease Date: 04 March 2022\n\nGenre: Blues\n\nLabel: Southwest Musical Arts Fnd.\n\nDistributor: MGM Music"
