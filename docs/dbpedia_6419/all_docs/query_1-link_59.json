        "text": "A Paraphrase is...\n\nyour own rendition of essential information and ideas expressed by someone else, presented in a new form.\n\none legitimate way (when accompanied by accurate documentation) to borrow from a source.\n\na more detailed restatement than a summary, which focuses concisely on a single main idea.\n\nParaphrasing is a valuable skill because...\n\nit is better than quoting information from an undistinguished passage.\n\nit helps you control the temptation to quote too much.\n\nthe mental process required for successful paraphrasing helps you to grasp the full meaning of the original.\n\nSix Steps to Effective Paraphrasing\n\nReread the original passage until you understand its full meaning.\n\nSet the original aside, and write your paraphrase on a note card.\n\nJot down a few words below your paraphrase to remind you later how you envision using this material. At the top of the note card, write a key word or phrase to indicate the subject of your paraphrase.\n\nCheck your rendition with the original to make sure that your version accurately expresses all the essential information in a new form.\n\nUse quotation marks to identify any unique term or phraseology you have borrowed exactly from the source.\n\nRecord the source (including the page) on your note card so that you can credit it easily if you decide to incorporate the material into your paper.\n\nSome examples to compare:\n\nThe original passage:\n\nStudents frequently overuse direct quotation in taking notes, and as a result they overuse quotations in the final [research] paper. Probably only about 10% of your final manuscript should appear as directly quoted matter. Therefore, you should strive to limit the amount of exact transcribing of source materials while taking notes.\n\nA legitimate paraphrase:\n\nIn research papers students often quote excessively, failing to keep quoted material down to a desirable level. Since the problem usually originates during note taking, it is essential to minimize the material recorded verbatim.\n\nAn acceptable summary:\n\nStudents should take just a few notes in direct quotation from sources to help minimize the amount of quoted material in a research paper.\n\nA plagiarized version:\n\nStudents often use too many direct quotations when they take notes, resulting in too many of them in the final research paper. In fact, probably only about 10% of the final copy should consist of directly quoted material. So it is important to limit the amount of source material copied while taking notes.\n\nParaphrasing Exercise\n\n\"The Antarctic is the vast source of cold on our planet, just as the sun is the source of our heat, and it exerts tremendous control on our climate,\" [Jacques] Cousteau told the camera. \"The cold ocean water around Antarctica flows north to mix with warmer water from the tropics, and its upwellings help to cool both the surface water and our atmosphere. Yet the fragility of this regulating system is now threatened by human activity.\"\n\nThe twenties were the years when drinking was against the law, and the law was a bad joke because everyone knew of a local bar where liquor could be had. They were the years when organized crime ruled the cities, and the police seemed powerless to do anything against it. Classical music was forgotten while jazz spread throughout the land, and men like Bix Beiderbecke, Louis Armstrong, and Count Basie became the heroes of the young. The flapper was born in the twenties, and with her bobbed hair and short skirts, she symbolized, perhaps more than anyone or anything else, America's break with the past.\n\nOf the more than 1000 bicycling deaths each year, three-fourths are caused by head injuries. Half of those killed are school-age children. One study concluded that wearing a bike helmet can reduce the risk of head injury by 85 percent. In an accident, a bike helmet absorbs the shock and cushions the head.\n\nMatisse is the best painter ever at putting the viewer at the scene. He's the most realistic of all modern artists, if you admit the feel of the breeze as necessary to a landscape and the smell of oranges as essential to a still life. \"The Casbah Gate\" depicts the well-known gateway Bab el Aassa, which pierces the southern wall of the city near the sultan's palace. With scrubby coats of ivory, aqua, blue, and rose delicately fenced by the liveliest gray outline in art history, Matisse gets the essence of a Tangier afternoon, including the subtle presence of the bowaab, the sentry who sits and surveys those who pass through the gate.\n\nWhile the Sears Tower is arguably the greatest achievement in skyscraper engineering so far, it's unlikely that architects and engineers have abandoned the quest for the world's tallest building. The question is: Just how high can a building go? Structural engineer William LeMessurier has designed a skyscraper nearly one-half mile high, twice as tall as the Sears Tower. And architect Robert Sobel claims that existing technology could produce a 500-story building.\n\nParaphrasing Exercise: Possible Answers\n\nHere are sample answers for the paraphrasing exercise:"
