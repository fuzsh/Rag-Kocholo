        "text": "From classical music to modern dance, yearly family traditions to hot concerts, the world’s best artists come to the 2,791-seat, historic Ohio Theatre. The breathtaking details (including the 21-foot-high chandelier!) of its opulent, Spanish-Baroque architecture make any night at the Ohio an event to remember!\n\nThe Ohio Theatre is located at 39 E. State Street, between 3rd and High Streets, across the street from the Ohio Statehouse.\n\nWe offer free booster seats for our youngest patrons at the Ohio Theatre. Booster seats are first come, first served, and our inventory is very limited. To receive a booster seat, please ask for a house manager upon your arrival to the Ohio Theatre.\n\nNEW! The Ohio Theatre now offers 2 nursing stations!\n\nEach nursing station is equipped with a comfortable chair, hand sanitizer, disinfecting wipes, facial tissue, paper towels, access to electrical outlets, and private lighting.\n\nThe nursing stations are in the women’s restroom of the lower level of the Ohio Theatre, and are accessible by elevator. The stations are available while the building is open, and through intermission during performances.\n\nThe easiest way to find the nursing room is to enter the Ohio Theatre through the business office doors, in the walkway between the Ohio Theatre and the Sheraton Hotel."
