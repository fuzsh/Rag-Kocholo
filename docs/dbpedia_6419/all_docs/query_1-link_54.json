Race and Ethnicity in the Cinematic Arts. 3 Credit Hours.\n\nMovies, cinematic arts, episodic narrative, and media arts have played a central role in how we understand diverse racial and ethnic identities. The course will study Hollywood as well as more recent streaming studios such as Amazon and Netflix as they engage in evolving portrayals of African American, Indigenous, Asian American, South American and Mexican descent, Italian American identities and more. From early cinema to the present the course will ask critical questions such as: How are stereotypes built upon century-old cinematic and moving image traditions and how are they functioning still today? What cinematic representations of \"self\" have creators from marginalized racial and ethnic groups developed as a source of engagement and resistance to mainstream commercial views? How do diverse racial and ethnic cinematic representations intersect with gender, class, sexual orientation, religion, disability, and age? The course will trace the impact of racism throughout the history of cinematic arts as well as provide opportunities for group discussion to share personal experiences with diversity through viewing, researching, and critiquing cinematic and media arts.

How do time restraints such as being on the move and constantly changing locations affect the types of images selected and gathered? How does one assemble a future archive from which to draw at a future date in a short period of time? What happens to a culture when it is perceived as \"other\" and how does the lens of defamiliarization, dislocation, and disorientation translate into audiovisual production? What images, sounds and techniques represent the culture and history of a place? Which are site specific and which are transferable? What is the tension between the local and the global? At the end of the course, each student will be asked to produce their own short film based on their experiences and observations living away from home and out of their comfort zone.

Moving Camera Workshop. 4 Credit Hours.\n\nMoving Camera Workshop is a graduate level workshop course that explores the art and practice of moving camera media production. The course covers the range of techniques including hand-held, dolly, jib, virtual/motion sensors and Steadicam operation. Class time will be spent on group discussions/exercises, lectures/screenings, lab instruction and critiquing work. Through a series of production projects, students will work through the aesthetics of moving camera and gain the technical and physical expertise necessary for successful projects. This course will also explore the theory and history of camera movement as well as blocking and directing techniques. Locative and mobile media projects extend the work outside the classroom. Research on new camera movement technologies is used to move toward innovative student media projects.\n\nLevel Registration Restrictions: Must be enrolled in one of the following Levels: Graduate.\n\nRepeatability: This course may not be repeated for additional credits.\n\nPre-requisites: Minimum grade of B in FMA 5242.\n\nFMA 5551.
