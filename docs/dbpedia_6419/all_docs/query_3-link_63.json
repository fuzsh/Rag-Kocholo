        "text": "Who says the death of the groom should stop a wedding from happening? In the new film, “And Mrs,” we see that a little death shouldn’t stop the planned nuptials.\n\nAs seen in the trailer, “And Mrs” tells the story of a woman in London who is excited to marry her fiancé. Unfortunately, just days before the wedding, her fiancé passes away. As she begins to reevaluate her life, she realizes that she needs to continue with the wedding as a way to put the relationship to rest, so to speak. And since this is a comedy, hilarity ensues.\n\nREAD MORE: The Best Films Of 2024 So Far: ‘Challengers,’ ‘Civil War,’ ‘Love Lies Bleeding’ & More\n\nThe cast includes Aisling Bea, Colin Hanks, Billie Lourd, Susan Wokoma, Harriet Walter, and Elizabeth McGovern. The film is directed by Daniel Reisinger, who is a veteran of TV work.\n\n“And Mrs” arrives on September 2. You can watch the brand new trailer below.\n\nHere’s the synopsis:\n\nA hilarious and heartfelt comedy drama about Gemma, a woman living in London whose American fiancé, Nathan, dies shortly before their wedding day. Never a true believer in modern marriage, Nathan’s death makes Gemma re-evaluate the promise of a life spent together. When, with some encouragement from Nathan’s chaotic and unconventional sister, Audrey, she decides to go ahead with the wedding anyway, she has to overcome public opinion, the law of the land and even her own family’s objections for the right to finally say “I do”."
