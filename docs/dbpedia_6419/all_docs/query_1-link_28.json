        "text": "2017\n\nCity Locations\n\nKissimmee and Orlando, FL\n\nLocation Types\n\nHotels/Motels, House, Restaurant, Apartment\n\nLocation Styles\n\nResort, Hotel/Motel Style, Americana/Anywhere, Dilapidated/Neglected, Trailer Park/Manufactured Home\n\nAbout The Florida Project\n\nThe Florida Project, an independent American drama film released in 2017, was crafted under the skilled direction and writing of Sean Baker. The film boasts a talented cast that includes Bria Vinaite, Willem Dafoe, Brooklynn Prince, Valeria Cotto, and Christopher Rivera. Upon its release in October 2017, it received widespread praise from critics and was subsequently nominated for numerous accolades at the prestigious 90th Academy Awards.\n\nThe Florida Project depicts the journey of Halley (Bria Vinaite), a single mother, and her six-year-old daughter Moonee (Brooklynn Prince), residing in a modest motel near Disney World in Orlando, Florida. With Halley struggling to make ends meet, Moonee spends her days playing with other children living in the same motel while her mother desperately looks for ways to keep them afloat. However, the motelâs manager, Bobby (Willem Dafoe), watches out for them and tries his best to protect them from any harm that could come their way.\n\nUpon its debut, the Florida Project was met with high praise, with critics lauding the direction and the performances by Dafoe, Prince, and Vinaite. Willem Dafoe received recognition for Best Supporting Actor at several prestigious award ceremonies, including the 90th Academy Awards, Golden Globes, SAG Awards, Critics Choice Awards, and BAFTA Awards. Meanwhile, Brooklynn Prince clinched the Critics' Choice Movie Award for Best Young Performer.\n\nThe Florida Project Locations\n\nThe Florida Project, released in 2017, is a critically acclaimed drama directed by Sean Baker. To capture the atmosphere of this unique place, the majority of filming was done in Kissimmee, Florida.\n\nKissimmee is located in the center of the state, close to Lake Tohopekaliga and the John F. Kennedy Space Center on Merritt Island. It has an array of attractions like the Old Town amusement park and even big shopping malls like the Loop Shopping Center. The backdrop for most scenes was provided by the Magic Castle Inn & Suites and Futureland Inn, where Moonee lived with her mother Halley. These two properties are gritty landmarks of Kissimmee that were crucial to setting the tone for many of the sequences in The Florida Project. In addition to these locations, nearby sites such as Eliâs Orange World and Jungle Falls Gift Shop also made their way into the film's landscape, providing colorful visual appeal and plenty of optimism despite the poverty depicted on screen.\n\nA trip to Kissimmee would be worthwhile for anyone looking to explore the locations featured in The Florida Project. Fans will get a chance to feel what it's like to walk through some of the same places as Moonee. Immersing oneself within these areas can bring a feeling of nostalgia for a simpler time that so often resonates with viewers after watching The Florida Project.\n\nIn the town of Kissimmee, Florida, a small boy named Dicky (Aiden Malik), dashes off to gather his companions, Scooty (Christopher Rivera) and the six-year-old Moonee. He takes them to an unpolished motel known as Future Land. The trio of children scamper up to the balcony on the second floor and begin to spit on a parked vehicle. As they are engaged in their mischief, Stacy (Josie Olivo), the car's owner, appears and admonishes the children. Amid this, Moonee audaciously spits on Stacy's granddaughter, Jancey (Valeria Cotto).\n\nThe real-life location of this scene is Paradise Inn, situated at 4501 W Irlo Bronson Memorial Highway, Kissimmee. This location was transformed into the fictional Future Land motel for the movie. True to its depiction in the film, Paradise Inn is a no-frills roadside motel that captures the spirit of the story's setting. Its exterior remains unchanged from the movie, maintaining the same look and atmosphere that viewers will recognize.\n\nGetting to Paradise Inn is straightforward. It's located on West Irlo Bronson Memorial Highway, a significant road in Kissimmee. For those traveling from Orlando, it's about a half-hour drive southwest via I-4 W. If you're coming from Miami, it's approximately a three-and-a-half-hour drive north via the Florida Turnpike.\n\nDuring their summer vacation from school, the children fill their days with adventures around the motel and the surrounding area. One of their escapades involves peeping at a middle-aged woman who is sunbathing without her top on, an activity that is abruptly halted by Bobby, who instructs the woman to cover herself. In another instance, the naughty kids infiltrate the maintenance room and shut off the motel's power, much to the annoyance of the residents trying to keep cool on a sweltering day.\n\nThe scenes for the motel Magic Castle were filmed at a location called Developer Inn Highway. The motelâs name was Magic Castle Inn & Suites during filming. Close by is another filming location, Paradise Inn, allowing fans to visit two key locations from the film in one outing.\n\nTo visit these iconic locations, travelers have to head to West Irlo Bronson Memorial Highway in Kissimmee, Florida. If journeying from Orlando, a roughly 30-minute drive southwest via I-4 W will lead you there.\n\nMoonee, Jancey, and Scooty venture to an abandoned house. The children engage in mischievous play, breaking objects and causing general chaos. The situation escalates when Scooty uses a stolen lighter to ignite a pillow under a chimney, sparking a large fire that engulfs the entire house.\n\nThis significant scene was filmed at an abandoned house at 4778 West Irlo Bronson Memorial Highway, Kissimmee, Florida. No details are available about the house's status, including whether it remains in its original state or is privately owned. Regardless, fans can still check out this site.\n\nThose who want to visit this iconic location from The Florida Project for themselves can do so with relative ease. You can find it around half an hourâs drive south of downtown Orlando.\n\nA striking scene unfolds when Ashley (Mela Murder), suspecting Scooty's involvement in recent mischief, forbids him from associating with Moonee any longer. In retaliation, Halley takes Moonee to Ashley's restaurant. She orders an excessive amount of food, which Moonee devours quickly. Ashley is then made to pack the uneaten food for them to take away. However, on returning to the motel, Halley discards the packed food.\n\nThis memorable scene was filmed at Mr Quick Restaurant, located at 5615 W Colonial Drive in Orlando, Florida. The place remains open and virtually unchanged since its appearance in the film, offering fans the chance to fully immerse themselves in the movie's atmosphere while enjoying classic American cuisine.\n\nTo reach Mr Quick Restaurant from downtown Orlando, take W Colonial Drive for approximately five miles. Alternatively, public transportation is available, but please note that it may take longer.\n\nOne of the most heartwarming scenes unfolds on Jancey's birthday. Halley, Moonee, and Jancey hitch a ride to a secluded field far from the bustle of the city. From this vantage point, they are able to watch the enchanting fireworks display from Disney World, a magical sight that fills them with joy and wonder.\n\nThis touching scene was filmed at Windermere Cay Apartments, located at 8200 Jayme Drive, Winter Garden, Florida. Near this location, you can find the same field where the girls watched the mesmerizing spectacle of fireworks. The field is conveniently situated near Magic Kingdom Park, so if you're fortunate, you can witness a fireworks show during the evening hours.\n\nGetting to this location might be tricky as it's pretty far from downtown Orlando, and there's no direct public transport connection (only with transfers). You can get there by car, however, as itâs about a half-hour drive southwest from Orlando.\n\nThe film culminates in an emotionally charged scene where Moonee, overwhelmed with emotion, runs to Jancey's room at Future Land. Unable to articulate her feelings, she breaks down in tears. Sensing her distress, Jancey takes Moonee's hand, and they run away together. Their journey takes them on foot to Walt Disney World Park, where they make their way to the iconic Magic Kingdom castle. This intense, heartrending scene marks the conclusion of the film.\n\nThis climactic sequence was filmed at the renowned Walt Disney World Resort in Orlando, Florida. Known for its enchanting attractions and magical experiences, Walt Disney World Park needs no introduction. To enhance your Disney experience, it is advisable to make the most of the \"Extra Magic Hours\" the park offers. According to the information on the Disney World website, this benefit allows guests staying at Disney Resort and select partner hotels to enjoy additional time in one of the theme parks every day, either before or after it officially closes.\n\nTo get to Walt Disney World Resort from any part of America, you can take a flight directly into Orlando International Airport and then take a bus or taxi from there."
