        "text": "01 of 26\n\n2 Dope Queens (2018–2019)\n\nBased on the popular podcast hosted by comedians Jessica Williams and Phoebe Robinson, HBO's 2 Dope Queens isn't so much a traditional television show as it is a series of comedy specials, each boasting a distinct theme. Consisting of four episodes in Season 1 (centered around the topics of black nerdery, hook-ups, hair, and living in New York City), and four episodes in Season 2 (exploring themes of luxury, music, fashion, and nostalgia), 2 Dope Queens invites comedians and celebrities alike to sit with its hysterical hosts and kibitz for each of the show's hour-long episodes.\n\nDirected by comedian Tig Notaro, 2 Dope Queens — like the podcast on which the show is based — seeks to explore representation, while still exposing audiences to some of the best established and up-and-coming comics circa the late-2010s. An obvious choice for fans of the podcast — as well as newcomers to Williams' and Robinson's work — 2 Dope Queens is a unique and easily bingeable option for comedy lovers from all walks of life.\n\nWhere to watch 2 Dope Queens: Max\n\nCast: Jessica Williams, Phoebe Robinson\n\n02 of 26\n\nAbbott Elementary (2021—present)\n\nIf you're loving our Ted Lasso-era of feel-good comedies, then you need to hop aboard the school bus headed for Abbott Elementary. Created by and starring Quinta Brunson, the sitcom returns to the mockumentary format made famous by shows like The Office and Parks and Recreation, but manages to distinguish itself through its impeccable writing, performances, and armory of adorable child actors.\n\nSet in an underfunded Philadelphia elementary school, Abbott Elementary chronicles the lives of the school's young, idealistic teachers, its established, burnt-out educators, and the school's self-involved, TikTok-loving principal. A critical and commercial hit from the jump, the first season saw Brunson and Sheryl Lee Ralph taking home Emmys, and with education becoming an increasing subject of cultural and political discussion, the show's satirical possibilities are infinite.\n\nWhere to watch Abbott Elementary: Max\n\nEW grade: A– (read the review)\n\nCast: Quinta Brunson, Tyler James Williams, Chris Perfetti, Sheryl Lee Ralph, Lisa Ann Walter, Janelle James\n\n03 of 26\n\nBarry (2018–2023)\n\nThose who like a little action with their comedy need look no further than the Emmy-winning series Barry, created by Bill Hader. The show follows Barry Berkman (Hader), a hitman from Cleveland who travels to Los Angeles on assignment to kill his next victim, but who ends up finding a new career path in the City of Angels: acting. As Barry tries to pursue his new passion onstage in Gene Cousineau's (Henry Winkler) acting class, he must figure out how to cut ties to his criminal past so he can take on more enticing roles.\n\nThe fourth and final season, which premiered its last episode in May 2023, takes on a bleaker tone while still maintaining the show's brilliance, and continues to interrogate the thematic premise of redemption and whether or not people can really change.\n\nWhere to watch Barry: Max\n\nEW grade: B+ (read the review)\n\nCast: Bill Hader, Stephen Root, Sarah Goldberg, Glenn Fleshler, Anthony Carrigan, Henry Winkler, Sarah Burns, Robert Wisdom\n\n04 of 26\n\nThe Comeback (2005, 2014)\n\nAlmost exactly a year after Friends went off the air, Lisa Kudrow was back on TV, starring in HBO's The Comeback. Created by Kudrow and Sex and the City's Michael Patrick King, the show is a unique fusion of sitcom and reality show, chronicling the comeback of fictional sitcom star Valerie Cherish (Kudrow) as she returns to TV. Shot using found footage, the show was stylistically ahead of its time which is maybe why — despite developing a cult following — it was canceled after one season.\n\nHindsight is everything, however, and in 2014, the show returned for a second season, this time following Cherish as she attempts to pitch a pilot to Bravo personality and producer Andy Cohen. Smart, satirical, and offering exceptional insights into the television industry, The Comeback is a delight and a necessary reminder for audiences that Kudrow's comedic talents far exceed what she was allowed to showcase on Friends.\n\nWhere to watch The Comeback: Max\n\nCast: Lisa Kudrow, Malin Åkerman, Robert Bagnell, Lance Barber, Robert Michael Morris, Laura Silverman, Damian Young\n\n05 of 26\n\nCurb Your Enthusiasm (2000–2024)\n\nIn the sitcom Seinfeld, George Costanza's character serves as a stand-in for show creator Larry David, possessing the best and worst of David's neuroticisms, anxieties, and questionable belief systems. In Curb Your Enthusiasm, David ditches the character and goes straight to the source: himself. Over the course of 12 seasons — which has been airing on and off since 2000, with a six-year gap between seasons 8 and 9, and is concluding its final season in 2024 — David stacks the cast with friends and celebrities, most of whom play fictionalized versions of themselves.\n\nThe show follows David, a semi-retired comedy writer and producer, as he navigates life in Los Angeles, his relationship with his wife, Cheryl, his manager, Jeff, Jeff's wife, Susie, and his friend, Leon. Poking fun at L.A. culture, the entertainment industry, and most of all, himself, David spends the series reminding us why he's one of the funniest, most prolific, and most self-aware comedy writers of all time.\n\nWhere to watch Curb Your Enthusiasm: Max\n\nCast: Larry David, Cheryl Hines, Jeff Garlin, Susie Essman, J.B. Smoove\n\n06 of 26\n\nThe Flight Attendant (2020–2022)\n\nTV star Kaley Cuoco jumps from strength to strength, leaving her long-running gig on the sitcom The Big Bang Theory in 2019, only to star in the Max Original comedy drama thriller The Flight Attendant a year later. Cassie Bowden (Cuoco) is a flight attendant whose reckless drinking and proclivity for casual sex with passengers lands her a spot as a person of interest in an FBI investigation into the Bangkok murder of one of her former passengers — and sexual partners.\n\nPossessing no memory of what took place the night of the murder and haunted by hallucinations, Cassie attempts to clear her name and solve the crime, but finds her efforts compromised by her frequent drinking and self-destructive tendencies. Well-received by critics and audiences alike, Cuoco is a scene stealer, even as her hot mess character is drunkenly causing scenes.\n\nWhere to watch The Flight Attendant: Max\n\nCast: Kayley Cuoco, Michiel Huisman, Zosia Mamet, T. R. Knight, Michelle Gomez, Colin Woodell, Merle Dandridge, Griffin Matthews, Nolan Gerard Funk, Rosie Perez, Deniz Akdeniz, Mo McRae, Callie Hernandez, J.J. Soria, Cheryl Hines\n\n07 of 26\n\nFlight of the Conchords (2007–2010)\n\nThe New Zealand comedy duo Flight of the Conchords takes New York City in their self-titled, two season sitcom. The comedians play former shepherds now moonlighting as folk musicians and struggling to make it in America’s biggest city. With frequent appearances from the band’s manager, the band’s only fan, and a pawn shop employee, Flight of the Conchords is beloved for its musical comedy, with a song featured in every episode.\n\nEW’s writer calls the show “very smart and very funny.” writing that the series “has the chilly aesthetics of a Wes Anderson movie and the oddball hangers-on of Pee-wee’s Big Adventure.” Sound interesting? Watch Flight of the Conchords and enjoy the exploits of New Zealand’s fourth most popular folk parody duo.\n\nWhere to watch Flight of the Conchords: Max\n\nEW grade: N/A (read the review)\n\nCast: Jemaine Clement, Bret McKenzie, Rhys Darby, Kristen Schaal, Arj Barker\n\n08 of 26\n\nHacks (2021–present)\n\nAn odd couple comedy, Hacks is the story of two women — both on the outs in the entertainment industry — who are forced to work together, only to find that in spite of their generational and personality differences, they have more in common than either would care to admit. Ava (Hannah Einbinder) is a millennial comedy writer who has recently been \"canceled,\" and Deborah Vance (Jean Smart) is a seasoned Las Vegas stand-up comedian entering the twilight phase of her career, but unwilling to accept it. Since no one else in the industry is willing to work with them, their agent, Jimmy (Paul W. Downs), decides to pair the two together in hopes that they can save each other.\n\nAn excellent option for those looking to fill the Broad City-sized hole in their hearts, Hacks is a witty, relevant examination of the entertainment industry, the evolution of feminism, and the pros and cons of dating in Las Vegas.\n\nWhere to watch Hacks: Max\n\nEW grade: A– (read the review)\n\nCast: Jean Smart, Hannah Einbinder, Carl Clemons-Hopkins, Kaitlin Olson, Christopher McDonald, Paul W. Downs, Mark Indelicato, Rose Abdoo, Megan Stalter\n\n09 of 26\n\nHigh Maintenance (2016–2020)\n\nOne of the most unique comedies on this list, High Maintenance had an unconventional path to broadcast. A former Vimeo web series, the show follows a New York City-based weed dealer — known to his many customers as \"the Guy\" — as he bikes around the boroughs delivering weed and interacting with his eccentric clients. Debuting in 2012 as short episodes clocking in between five and 20 minutes, the show made the leap to HBO in 2016 where it expanded its content to a consistent half-hour format.\n\nAn intimate anthology series that feels specific to the 2010s, the show features different clients each week and uses their specific points of view and living situations as jumping-off points to explore and parody themes like loneliness, connection, politics, and so much more. Featuring some of the most thoughtful, funny, and insightful character studies on TV, the episodes unfold like one-act plays, with the Guy serving as the narrative thread that holds it all together.\n\nWhere to watch High Maintenance: Max\n\nEW grade: A– (read the review)\n\nCast: Ben Sinclair\n\n10 of 26\n\nInsecure (2016–2021)\n\nTwo years after Broad City made the leap from web series to Comedy Central, HBO responded with its own digital-to-broadcast success story. Partially based on Issa Rae's hit YouTube show The Mis-Adventures of Awkward Black Girl, Insecure was codeveloped by Rae and comedian Larry Wilmore, and stars Rae opposite Yvonne Orji as Issa and Molly, two college best friends trying to navigate the real world as adults living in South Los Angeles.\n\nSimple in its premise but refined and hysterical in its execution, the show examines the relatable issues that plague every generation of twentysomethings: uninspired relationships, complicated friendships, career difficulties, and the journey to independence and self-acceptance. A show that created a cult-like fan base and launched Rae into stardom, Insecure is, as EW's critic writes, \"smart, funny, and unfailingly real.\"\n\nWhere to watch Insecure: Max\n\nEW grade: A– (read the review)\n\nCast: Issa Rae, Yvonne Orji, Jay Ellis, Lisa Joyce, Natasha Rothwell, Amanda Seales\n\n11 of 26\n\nLast Week Tonight (2014–present)\n\nThe Daily Show took a hit when Senior British Correspondent John Oliver departed after a seven-year run to host his own late-night series on HBO. A weekly, half-hour talk show that explores topical events through monologues, short satirical segments, and one targeted deep dive per episode, the series instantly charmed viewers and critics while simultaneously evoking ire from many politicians and big businesses who were on the receiving end of its coverage.\n\nOne of the few television series whose content has contributed to real legislative and cultural change, the show has no problem biting the hand that feeds it, inviting more than a few enemies and at least one defamation lawsuit (which ended poorly for the plaintiff). Educational, subversive, silly, and consistently funny, there's a reason that Last Week Tonight With John Oliver has received eight consecutive Emmy wins for Outstanding Writing for a Variety Series.\n\nWhere to watch Last Week Tonight With John Oliver: Max\n\nEW grade: A– (read the review)\n\nCast: John Oliver\n\n12 of 26\n\nLos Espookys (2019–2022)\n\nA Spanish-language comedy series created by and starring Julio Torres, Ana Fabrega, and Fred Armisen, Los Espookys follows a group of friends — and one of their uncles, an esteemed parking attendant, played by Armisen — who form a business aimed at designing and executing fake horror experiences. From faux exorcisms for competitive priests to creating sea monsters and faking abductions, the staff at Los Espookys is happy to serve as the local purveyors of made-up terror. A perfect balance of scary and silly, the first season offers six bingeable episodes (the seventh was delayed by COVID-19), but as an EW critic warns, \"If you're not comfortable laughing out loud to yourself at unpredictable intervals, Los Espookys may not be the show for you.\"\n\nAnother devastating casualty of the pandemic, Los Espookys quickly gained traction when it premiered in 2019, but production delays caused the second season to be pushed back until 2022, and HBO canceled the show soon after. But even as we mourn the loss of another show gone too soon, we have to give credit to Los Espookys, one of the few series capable of scaring you with how funny it is.\n\nWhere to watch Los Espookys: Max\n\nEW grade: A– (read the review)\n\nCast: Bernardo Velasco, Cassandra Ciangherotti, Ana Fabrega, Julio Torres, Fred Armisen\n\n13 of 26\n\nMr. Show With Bob and David (1995–1998)\n\nThe best sketch series from the late '90s that nobody knew about was Mr. Show With Bob and David. Broadcast on HBO between 1995 and 1998, the show amassed a cult-like following of writers, comedians, and in-the-know comedy fans who saw it as the heir apparent to smart, absurdist variety series like Monty Python, SCTV, and Kids in the Hall. Boasting a slew of celebrity admirers — among them Conan O'Brien, Janeane Garofalo, Jordan Peele, and Keegan-Michael Key — Mr. Show was created, written, and executive produced by David Cross and Bob Odenkirk, who somehow also found time to star in the series.\n\nAlthough it never received the network support it needed or found the following it deserved during its four-season cable run, Mr. Show remains must-see TV for comedy lovers and fans of irreverent, satirical humor.\n\nWhere to watch Mr. Show: Max\n\nCast: Bob Odenkirk, David Cross\n\n14 of 26\n\nThe Other Two (2019–2023)\n\nFor every prepubescent YouTube singer that makes it big, there are two adult siblings failing at life. Or at least that's the case in The Other Two, a comedy following the less successful older brother and sister of 13-year-old Chase Dubeck (Case Walker) as the family deals with his overnight success. Chase's viral acclaim comes as something of a shock to Cary Dubeck (Drew Tarver), a gay actor looking to make it big by any means necessary, and his sister, Brooke (Heléne Yorke), a former professional dancer who is now working as a real estate agent, and squatting in the beautiful New York City apartments she shows. While Brooke and Cary struggle to find their way out of Chase's shadow, their mother Pat Dubeck (Molly Shannon) discovers she was made for Hollywood, and easily acclimates to the family's new lifestyle of the rich and the famous.\n\nCreated by two former co-head writers of Saturday Night Live, The Other Two puts the family through absurd situations on their journey through fame, but every now and then, they get a win.\n\nWhere to watch The Other Two: Max\n\nEW grade: A– (read the review)\n\nCast: Heléne Yorke, Drew Tarver, Case Walker, Ken Marino, Molly Shannon, Brandon Scott Jones, Josh Segarra\n\n15 of 26\n\nOur Flag Means Death (2022–2023)\n\nTravel back in time to the 1700s with Our Flag Means Death, Max's pirate rom-com that has captured viewers' attention thanks to its hilarious characters and significant LGBTQ+ representation. The energetic comedy is loosely based on the real life of Stede Bonnet (Rhys Darby) who left his lavish home in Barbados to prove himself as a pirate aboard a ship named Revenge. A cheeky farce featuring Taika Waititi as Blackbeard and Joel Fry as Frenchie, Our Flag Means Death also offers a softer side, and doesn't shy away from creating heartfelt queer romantic arcs for its leading characters.\n\nThe series has also received praise for including a nonbinary pirate, played by Vico Ortiz, who tells EW that part of what made their character — and the show's queer story lines — so authentic was that the writers' room reflected the diversity shown on screen.\n\nWhere to watch Our Flag Means Death: Max\n\nCast: Rhys Darby, Ewen Bremner, Joel Fry, Samson Kayo, Con O'Neill, Nathan Foad, Vico Ortiz, Kristian Nairn, Matthew Maher, Guz Khan, David Fane, Samba Schutte, Rory Kinnear, Nat Faxon, Taika Waititi\n\n16 of 26\n\nPAUSE With Sam Jay (2021–2022)\n\nStand-up comedian and SNL writer Sam Jay brings a unique talk show experience to the network with her series PAUSE With Sam Jay. The show, co-created by the comedian, turns late night into a party — literally. Every week, Sam cohosts a soiree at her apartment and invites her guests to delve into cultural issues ranging from race relations and politics to sexual identity and celebrity. Also featuring interviews, sketches, and animation, PAUSE takes late night out of the studio and into the real world, creating an authenticity and ease that is not generally associated with the genre. With party guests that include some of comedy's most established and up-and-coming talents, PAUSE is a talk show for comedy fans, cultural critics, and anyone who is down for some good conversation.\n\nSeason 2 wrapped in July of 2022, and Jay confirmed in February of 2023 that there will be no season 3. There are only 14 half-hour episodes available between the series' two seasons, which makes PAUSE the ideal show for a weekend binge.\n\nWhere to watch PAUSE With Sam Jay: Max\n\nCast: Sam Jay\n\n17 of 26\n\nPushing Daisies (2007–2009)\n\nThe 2007/2008 Writers Guild strike was responsible for many television deaths, but one of the saddest was the cancellation of Pushing Daisies, an hour-long comedy-drama that aired on ABC for only two seasons, in spite of its seven Emmy wins. The show follows professional pie maker Ned (Lee Pace), who possesses a supernatural, albeit slightly inconvenient, gift: He can bring anyone back to life with just one touch, but if he touches the person more than once, they'll die again. This proves to be something of a catch-22 when Ned brings his childhood crush Chuck (Anna Friel) back to life, only to realize that a physical relationship with her is now out of the question.\n\nAlso starring Kristin Chenoweth and narrated by Jim Dale (whose comforting British accent and timbre you might recognize from the Harry Potter audiobooks), Pushing Daisies offers a whimsical plot and the kind of beautiful production design that would have inspired many a Pinterest board — if Pinterest had been around back in 2007.\n\nWhere to watch Pushing Daisies: Max\n\nEW grade: A– (read the review)\n\nCast: Lee Pace, Anna Friel, Chi McBride, Field Cate, Ellen Greene, Swoosie Kurtz, Kristin Chenoweth\n\n18 of 26\n\nRap Sh!t (2022–2023)\n\nWhen Mia Knight (KaMillion) reaches out to her old high school friend Shawna (Aida Osman), all she's looking for is a babysitter. What she gets instead is a rap group and a viral single. Based on the real-life rap duo City Girls (both of whom are co-executive producers on this series), Rap Sh!t isn't just a show about music — it's a show about friendship, motherhood, and chasing a dream. Mia and Shawna are both musicians, but they have different artistic sensibilities and priorities. Shawna, a college dropout, wants to use her music to advocate for social issues, while Mia believes true female empowerment in music is being able to rap about whatever you want (with an emphasis on sex and partying).\n\nRepresenting Issa Rae's second project with Max after her celebrated hit Insecure, the series launched two seasons before being canceled in January 2024.\n\nWhere to watch Rap Sh!t: Max\n\nCast: Aida Osman, KaMillion, Jonica Booth, Devon Terrell, RJ Cyler\n\n19 of 26\n\nThe Rehearsal (2022–present)\n\nComedian Nathan Fielder has elevated cringe comedy to an art form, and nowhere is this illustrated more clearly than on The Rehearsal, a docu-comedy series created, written, directed by, and starring Fielder. The show's premise is simple: What if you could make all of life's difficult moments easier by rehearsing for them first? The show's execution (and budget), however, are out of this world, taking each rehearsal and heightening it to the extreme through the use of sets, costuming, casting, and — in a few cases — questionable ethics.\n\nThe production value is impressive, but it's Fielder's singular logic, deadpan style of delivery, and willingness to turn the camera on himself and examine his own life that takes the series from high-concept sketch comedy to emotionally investing performance art. In less deft hands, the show could veer dangerously into Punk'd territory, but Fielder's willingness to take accountability for the moments in this social experiment that go sideways helps ground the series in reality. One of the most creative and meta shows on television today (or perhaps ever), the less you know about The Rehearsal going into it, the more you'll enjoy the series.\n\nWhere to watch The Rehearsal: Max\n\nCast: Nathan Fielder\n\n20 of 26\n\nSearch Party (2016–2022)\n\nA fusion of dark comedy, social satire, mystery, and thriller, TBS found themselves with a late-night sleeper hit when they started airing Search Party in the late-2010s. A story of the twentysomething tendency to seek purpose — and the issues that arise when one finds it in the wrong places — the series follows Dory (Alia Shawkat), a Brooklyn resident stuck in a bad relationship and surrounded by self-involved friends, who discovers her college acquaintance Chantal has gone missing. As Dory becomes increasingly obsessed with finding Chantal, her interest propels her into dangerous situations with untrustworthy people, and the more she invests in the girl's life, the more her own falls apart.\n\nA story told over five seasons with an arc that no one saw coming, Search Party is a story of misguided Millennials searching for meaning.\n\nWhere to watch Search Party: Max\n\nEW grade: A– (read the review)\n\nCast: Alia Shawkat, John Reynolds, John Early, Meredith Hagner\n\n21 of 26\n\nThe Sex Lives of College Girls (2021–present)\n\nEvery generation deserves its own version of Sex and the City, and for Gen Z, that show arrives in the form of The Sex Lives of College Girls. Produced by The Office's Mindy Kaling — and receiving far more love than her other project, Velma — the series follows four young women from across the United States as they attend a fictional college in Vermont. Representing different racial and socioeconomic backgrounds, and possessing different sexual preferences and attitudes towards college hookup culture, the show is fast becoming the sexually liberated, comedic romp that SATC was for Millennials.\n\nThe Sex Lives of College Girls has a definite target audience in mind, but that doesn't mean the show doesn't appeal to those outside of that demographic — and with two seasons complete and a third on its way, this Max favorite is well worth a look, if only an exploratory one.\n\nWhere to watch The Sex Lives of College Girls: Max\n\nCast: Pauline Chalamet, Amrit Kaur, Reneé Rapp, Alyah Chanelle Scott, Gavin Leatherwood\n\n22 of 26\n\nSilicon Valley (2014–2019)\n\nIn the 2010s, startup culture demanded to be made fun of — and HBO's Silicon Valley obliged. The six-season comedy series chronicles the story of coder Richard Hendricks (Thomas Middleditch) as he attempts to launch his startup Pied Piper and keep the company relevant in the face of competitors, investors with ill intentions, and the general chaos that governs the tech industry. A show written by nerds, for nerds, and about nerds, Silicon Valley offers some of the best satire of Bay Area geek culture that exists today, parodying the cycle of success and failure that powers the startup community, and humanizing the people who keep it running.\n\nA quick-witted, joke-heavy, buzzword-utilizing time capsule of what the 2010s were like for a certain subset of entrepreneurs, Silicon Valley is funny regardless of the audience's familiarity with the subject matter — but for those who have lived the tech life, the show ascends to another level.\n\nWhere to watch Silicon Valley: Max\n\nEW grade: A– (read the review)\n\nCast: Thomas Middleditch, T.J. Miller, Josh Brener, Martin Starr, Kumail Nanjiani, Christopher Evan Welch, Amanda Crew, Zach Woods\n\n23 of 26\n\nSouth Side (2019–2021)\n\nChicago is one of America's most beloved metropolitans, as evidenced by the number of recent TV projects set within its city limits (we're looking at you, Chicago Fire, Chicago P.D., Chicago Med, Shameless, Empire, and The Bear). South Side, which aired for one season on Comedy Central before being scooped up by Max, tells the story of two furniture repo men — Simon (Sultan Salahuddin) and K (Kareme Young) — who live and grind in the city's Englewood neighborhood.\n\nIntended to serve as a showcase for the area's racial diversity and variety of experiences, the creators once told EW that they saw the show as a \"Black Game of Thrones,\" explaining, \"We have so many different characters that start off in the background and they come to the foreground.\" While the series has received love from both critics and fans, plans for season 4 were unfortunately scrapped by Max in 2023. Luckily for audiences, you can still catch the first three seasons on Max — at least until the streamer decides to repossess them.\n\nWhere to watch South Side: Max\n\nCast: Sultan Salahuddin, Kareme Young, Quincy Young, Chandra Russell, Bashir Salahuddin, Diallo Riddle, Lil Rel Howery, Zuri Salahuddin\n\n24 of 26\n\nTuca & Bertie (2019–2022)\n\nNetflix may have canceled Tuca & Bertie in 2019 after the show's first go-round, but the beloved animated comedy found a new home on Adult Swim (and Max) for the next two seasons — before being canceled again in November 2022. From the mind of BoJack Horseman producer and production designer Lisa Hanawalt, this resilient three-season series presents in a similar animated and comedic style, only now the protagonists take on the form of human-sized birds and anthropomorphic plants.\n\nHanawalt tells EW that she wanted to create something like Broad City, but within the realm of animation. While there are animated shows like Steven Universe that have been created by women, because they're targeted at children, the potential for mature themes is more limited. Hanawalt says she wanted to create a show for adults that reflects the honest, yet comedic lives of women, and interrogates the nuances of substance abuse and assault.\n\nWhere to watch Tuca & Bertie: Max\n\nCast: Tiffany Haddish, Ali Wong, Steven Yeun, John Early, Richard E. Grant, Reggie Watts.\n\n25 of 26\n\nVeep (2012–2019)\n\nJulia Louis-Dreyfus won nine Emmys for her acting and producing work on the political comedy, Veep, and if the show hadn't ended in the spring of 2019, she would probably still be racking up the trophies. Created by Scottish writer Armando Iannucci, the show offers a satirical look at America's political system through the eyes of Vice President Selina Meyer, whose political ambitions far exceed her moral capacities. Surrounded by a team of equally cutthroat D.C. staffers and featuring seven years of some of the best cameo casting comedy has to offer, the show benefited deeply from good timing, airing during the steady polarization of America's political system. (Although, towards the end of the series, it becomes difficult to determine where real-life politics end and the show's heightened, satirical version of them begins.)\n\nOne of the few comedies to truly stick the landing in its season finale, Veep is a show that will only get better with age — and it was already pretty fantastic to begin with.\n\nWhere to watch Veep: Max\n\nEW grade: B+ (read the review)\n\nCast: Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Tony Hale, Anna Chlumsky, Matt Walsh, Reid Scott\n\n26 of 26\n\nThe White Lotus (2021–present)\n\nNow with two seasons under its belt, The White Lotus is a black comedy with a murder problem — but not one severe enough to keep you from daydreaming about booking your own vacation. Set at a fictional chain of luxury resorts called The White Lotus (seasons 1 and 2 have taken viewers to Hawaii and Italy), the series follows the management that keeps the hotels running and the wealthy guests who are lucky enough to score a room there. An anthology with a rotating cast (Jennifer Coolidge and Jon Gries' characters are so far the only ones to appear in multiple seasons), The White Lotus is a fascinating and laugh-out-loud funny look at privilege, class, family, and so much more.\n\nCreated by Mike White — the comedic mind behind School of Rock (2003), still operating at the top of his game decades later — The White Lotus has already been renewed for season 3, which reportedly takes place in Thailand.\n\nWhere to watch The White Lotus: Max\n\nEW grade: B+ (read the review)\n\nCast: Jennifer Coolidge, Jon Gries, Connie Britton, Aubrey Plaza, F. Murray Abraham, Michael Imperioli, Steve Zahn"
