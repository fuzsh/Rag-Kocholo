        "text": "“Playing an action hero and heist boss like Cyrus was a never-ending thrill ride for me. Collaborating with F. Gary Gray, who has directed some of my favourite action films of all time, and working with this incredible cast in some crazy locations took the entire experience to a whole new level.” From screen to screen, Kevin Hart is set to conquer audiences with his latest Netflix film, released on 12 January. It’s a cinematic adventure that doesn’t just take place on the screen, but also in grandiose film locations. Get ready to go behind the scenes for this blockbuster directed by F. Gary Gray, where each set becomes a key part of the plot, transforming a simple backdrop into an immersive cinematic experience. Let us guide you through the unique sets that brought the story to life. Welcome to the fascinating world of Lift, where the action takes off far beyond the screen.\n\nWhat’s the pitch for Lift?\n\n“In the new film from director F. Gary Gray (Friday, Set It Off, The Italian Job, The Fate of the Furious, Straight Outta Compton), a gang of expert criminals led by Cyrus Whitaker (Kevin Hart) are recruited to do what they do best: steal $500 million in gold from a passenger plane. However, they must do so in mid-air at 40,000 feet!”\n\nWhat is the casting list for Lift?\n\nRecognized as Netflix’s first major cinematic release of 2024, Lift features a remarkable ensemble cast. In addition to Kevin Hart, the cast includes Gugu Mbatha-Raw, Vincent D’Onofrio, Úrsula Corberó, Billy Magnussen, Jacob Batalon, as well as Jean Reno and Sam Worthington.\n\nThe trailer for Lift\n\nWhere was Lift filmed?\n\nThe film takes viewers across the world, or at least across Europe. The film was shot in several different locations, including Belfast, Venice, London, Cortina and the Alps. “We ate a lot in Italy,” says F. Gary Gray. “Venice was the most fun and challenging experience, especially when shooting the opening action sequence. Although the city itself is a work of art, with its canals, historic buildings and 600-year-old frescoes, the constraints it can pose make shooting the action extremely complicated. Nevertheless, shooting in a place that is art itself creates the perfect tone for this global art heist film. My director of photography, Bernhard Jasper, did an excellent job capturing the city’s beauty despite these challenges.”\n\nFor the film’s opening sequence, which begins with an auction and concludes with a wild boat chase, the production team flew to Italy. Exterior shots in Venice included the renowned Piazza San Marco and the nearby Lagoon, providing the backdrop for the scene where Kevin Hart guides an unnamed artist (played by Jacob Batalon) to his boat. As for the indoor auction sequence, it was filmed at the Scuola Grande di San Rocco, a historic 16th-century religious and artistic centre adorned with massive masterpieces by Titian and Tintoretto.\n\nMany of the film’s interior scenes were entirely built at Harbour Studios, the main production base for Lift. These include Cyrus’s flat, various parts of the plane’s interior (first class, business class, economy class and the hold), the Brussels Flight Centre, as well as security at Heathrow Airport. Footage for the gimbals, the jet’s stealth cockpit and other scenes was also shot at Loop Studios and Titanic Studios. “We designed custom gimbals and different sized aircraft to capture dynamic angles for the aerial combat scenes,” says Gray. “My art director, Dominic Watkins, did a fantastic job designing and building oversized interiors for these planes, allowing the cameras, stunts, crew and actors to operate in these tight spaces. My stunt coordinator, Steve Griffin, did an excellent job of ensuring that the action sequences were flawlessly executed.”\n\nHart and Gugu Mbatha-Raw’s meeting with Harry was filmed at Belfast’s Crown Liquor Saloon, which first opened its doors in the 1850s under the name The Railway Tavern. Over the next 200 years or so, it became famous for its mosaic floors, carved ceiling and snugs – small private areas where, in Victorian times, ladies, the wealthy and anyone else who wanted to avoid the public eye could sit. An ideal choice for anyone planning a robbery.\n\nThe scenes showing Cyrus’ team preparing for the robbery were shot in an aircraft hangar on a disused military base in Ballykelly, a village north of Belfast. The 250-hectare property opened in 1941 as the Royal Air Force Ballykelly, or simply RAF Ballykelly. It closed in 1971, when the site was transferred to the British Army as Shackleton Barracks and Airfield. The site was decommissioned and sold to a private investor in 2016. It is located on the shores of Lough Foyle.\n\nThe night-time showdown between Mbatha-Raw and Hart took place at London’s Sky Pool. “The Sky Pool is the only swimming pool in the world suspended between the roofs of two buildings,” explained the production. “The 25m long pool, only accessible to residents of the building, is crystal clear and seems to be floating in the sky.”"
