Goodfellas (1990)\n\n\"The 'Funny how?' scene. Joe Pesci is terrifying, and it's made worse by taking place in such an ordinary setting.\"\n\n—noimpillagingeverybody\n\nYou can watch the tense scene here:\n\n20. The Fallout (2021)\n\n\"The scene when they're hiding in the bathroom. I was struck by the sound of the character's heavy breath, crying, and throwing up. You pretty much spend the entire scene just waiting for something to happen — to either be told it's over or for the gunman to come into the bathroom.I had the pause the movie after watching that scene.\"\n\n—nameless_demon\n\nYou can watch the tense scene here:\n\n21. A Beautiful Mind (2001)\n\n\"The scene when the bathtub keeps filling up with water, and the baby in it almost drowns. It gives me a panic attack every time I see it.\"\n\n—ironpatriot1\n\nYou can watch the tense scene here:\n\n22. The Martian (2015)\n\n\"When Captain Lewis can't reach Mark, so he has to jump his way to her. Even then, he's struggling to hold onto the tether as she desperately tries to tangle the rope to reach him faster. The cheer around the world when she announces he's safe was so well deserved, as that sequence was so stressful. One slip, and — after surviving alone on Mars for over a year — he would have just floated off into space, dead.\"\n\n—monikap6\n\nYou can watch the tense scene here:\n\n23. What Lies Beneath (2000)\n\n\"The scene with Michelle Pfeiffer in the bathtub, when she's paralyzed while it slowly fills up to drown her!\"\n\n—itswisa\n\nYou can watch the tense scene here:\n\n24. Misery (1990)\n\n\"For me, it's the scene when Paul picked the lock and escaped his room while Annie was gone. He's exploring the house, and eventually, he grabs a knife and some pills. However, he suddenly hears Annie's car and realizes she's on her way back, so he has to crawl his way back into his wheelchair and into his room before she finds out that he had snuck out. That scene is just so tense.\"\n\n—aidensmith\n\nYou can watch the tense scene here:\n\n25. Brothers (2009)\n\n\"There's a scene after Sam returns home. He, his wife, Grace, and brother, Tommy, are seated at a table. Sam and Grace's daughter gets upset for some reason and gets a balloon and starts squeezing it in her hands. She catches everyone's eye while doing this because it makes a squeaking sound. Sam looks at his daughter with the scariest look to get her to stop, but she keeps doing it while staring her dad down until he eventually snaps at her. In return, she says a ton of horrible things, even saying her mom and uncle were having an affair and that she wants her uncle as her dad instead. That scene broke me. I was so on edge watching it. To this day, the image of her staring her dad down while squeaking that balloon gives me chills.\"\n\n—ravenstone\n\nYou can watch the tense scene here:\n\n26.
