Freedman\n\nMusic by Steven Lutvak\n\nLyrics by Robert L. Freedman & Steven Lutvak\n\nThe Tony Award winning Best Musical, Gentlemanâs Guide to Love and Murder; book and lyrics by Robert L. Freedman, music and lyrics by Steven Lutvak, is the knock-âem-dead, uproarious story of low-born Monty Navarro.\n\nOn the night of his motherâs funeral, Navarro learns an incredible secret: he is actually an Aristocrat and eighth in line for an earldom in the lofty DâYsquith family. Using a great deal of charmâ¦ and a delicious dash of malicious mayhem, Monty attempts to knock off his unsuspecting relatives. Because if he becomes the ninth Earl of Highhurst he might just earn the heart of the stunning and self-centered Sibella or perhaps the pious and witty Phoebe; because murder isnât the only thing on Montyâs mindâ¦.\n\nA Gentlemanâs Guide to Love and Murder is a melodious and murderous romp filled with unforgettable music, non-stop laughs and a scene-stealing role for one actor who plays all eight of the doomed heirs (The DâYsquith Family) as they meet their ends in the most creative and side-splitting ways.\n\nWhat the Constitution Means to Me\n\nOct 17, 2024 - Oct 20, 2024\n\nTicket â Adult $30 (includes fees)\n\nWhat the Constitution Means to Me\n\nby Heidi Schreck\n\nA buoyant, funny, timely and provocative examination by one woman of her civil rights and wrongs. As a teenager, Heidi Schreck, competed in American Legion debate competitions, winning enough prize money to pay her way through college.\n\nWhat the Constitution Means to Me contrasts her thoughts from then and now. All grown-up, and through powerful storytelling, Heidi hilariously reimagines what this living document will mean for the future of America.\n\nA Pulitzer Prize finalist and Tony Award nominee, this bold, optimistic new play was hailed by The New York Times as ânot just the best play to open on Broadway so far this season, but also the most important.â\n\nThe play, What the Constitution Means to Me, humanizes this document we all revere and asks the question â ARE we all âcreated equalâ?\n\nMaking God Laugh\n\nNov 15, 2024 - Nov 24, 2024\n\nTicket â Adult $30 (includes fees)\n\nMaking God Laugh\n\nby Sean Grennan\n\nA priest, an actress, and a football star walk into a living room. Thatâs not the setup for a joke, itâs the recipe for a delightful look at family life as empty-nester parents celebrate the holidays through the decades with their grown up children.\n\nMaking God Laugh by Sean Grennan follows one typical American family over the course of thirty years, starting in 1980. The kids return home on Thanksgiving, Christmas, New Years Eve and Easter and we learn about their plans and dreams.\n\nThe parents contend with their own changes, too, as old family rituals and recipes are trotted out and ancient tensions flare up. As time passes, the family discovers that, despite what we may have in mind, we often arrive at unexpected destinations.\n\nThis comedy-drama is both hilarious and heartfelt because, as Woody Allen once remarked, âIf you want to make God laugh, tell him your plansâ¦â\n\nMatt and Ben\n\nFeb 14, 2025 - Feb 23, 2025\n\nTicket â Adult $30 (includes fees)\n\nMatt and Ben\n\nby Mindy Kaling and Brenda Withers\n\nAs Damon and Affleck struggle to write an adapted screenplay of The Catcher in the Rye by J. D. Salinger, suddenly, a physical manuscript magically appears on the floor of Affleckâs apartment:- it is entitled- Good Will Hunting.\n\nMatt and Ben by Mindy Kaling and Brenda Withers is the story Hollywood has glamorized, publicized, and bombarded us withâhow it all began for the two young men. But are they being tested by a âhigher powerâ? Their quick success is seemingly too good to be true.\n\nMatt and Ben shows the hilarious ups and downs of a true lifelong friendship. The fact that these iconic dudes of the 90s are being played by female actors offers a commentary on celebrity, both permanent and fleeting, and on an industry known as Hollywood.\n\nHamlet II (Better Than The Original)\n\nFeb 14, 2025 - Feb 23, 2025\n\nTicket â Adult $30 (includes fees)\n\nHamlet II (Better Than The Original)\n\nby Sam Bobrick\n\nPutting the ham into Shakespeareâs Hamlet, Sam Bobrick (co-writer of Murder at the Howard Johnsons) tells the story of the Prince of Denmark by turning it into the burlesque-ish spoof Hamlet 2 (Better Than The Original). Itâs like Hamlet but with a happier ending.\n\nThis is not your English teacherâs Shakespeare but, If youâve had trouble grasping the intent of the Bardâs classic endeavor, this should clear it up once and for all. While the plot remains very true to good old Willâs basic fundamentals with all the characters you remember from High School; Bobrickâs hilarious comedy updates the dialogue with witty one liners and new twists and turns that are played for laughs, gaffes and groans.\n\nHamlet the way it should be.\n\nThe Cottage\n\nApr 4, 2025 - Apr 13, 2025\n\nTicket â Adult $30 (includes fees)\n\nThe Cottage\n\nby Sandy Rustin\n\nBroadwayâs fastest, flirtiest and friskiest new comedy is the brand-new, side-splitting romp The Cottage by Sandy Rustin (one of the most produced playwrights in the US), an outrageous tale of sex, betrayal, and desire.\n\nAs one woman decides to expose her latest affair to both her husband â and to her loverâs wife â the true meaning of fate and faith, identity and infidelity, love and marriage are all called into question as a surprising and uproarious web of secrets unravel in this ridiculously funny romantic comedy.\n\nThis charming 1923 English countryside home away from home, turns into a hotbed of hilarity when spouses and lovers arrive. The secrets multiply and comedic chaos ensues. With a tip of the hat to NoÃ«l Coward and sex comedies of the past, The Cottage offers a perfect showcase of endless laughs, hilarious twists, daring physical comedy, and a happy ending for lovers everywhere.\n\nThe theater space at the Cider Mill Stage is available for rental/lease for community and business meetings as well as productions of plays and musical performances. The space is available on a day by day, week or monthly basis.\n\nThe theater is cabaret style seating with seating for 225. There is a snack bar available and ample on-site parking.\n\nPhone (607) 321-9630\n\nOr email cidermillstage@gmail.com"
