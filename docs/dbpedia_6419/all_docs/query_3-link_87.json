His raw energy, talent and comedic skill quickly landed Arnez the coveted hosting slot on BET’s longest-running comedy series “Comic View” for two seasons joining the ranks of hosts such as D.L. Hughley and Cedric the Entertainer. His hilarious new comedy special “Racially Motivated” is now available on Netflix.\n\nArnez J.'s charisma and physical agility are unforgettable. “J is a whirling dervish on stage—he runs, jumps, spins, slides, slips, and mugs through a performance, acting out many of his bits while describing them,” wrote Doug Kaufman in the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. Arnez admits of himself “I've always expressed my things through mannerisms and facial expressions rather than speaking.”\n\nOn his own at age 14, Arnez lied about his age to get a job at a gas station to work his way through school. With dreams to become a professional baseball player, Arnez began working as a flight attendant when those baseball plans fell through. It was while working as a flight attendant that Arnez discovered his comedic talent. He realized that he had the ability to keep the passengers and crew laughing and, upon encouragement from friends, he made his first attempt at stand-up comedy. After that first night on stage, he knew what he wanted to do. He left his job with the airlines and made the decision to devote all of his time to a career in comedy.\n\nArnez got a chance to combine his ambitions as both an athlete and performer when he was recruited by scouts for the famed Harlem Globetrotters basketball team who saw his very physical comedy routine at a local basketball game. However, after several months, a knee injury ended his Globetrotters career, finally clearing the way for him to devote himself full time to standup comedy.\n\nAn Atlanta native, Arnez began working the comedy circuit in Georgia and quickly became one of “Hotlanta's” funniest newcomers. A finalist in the “Bay Area Black Comedy Competition,” he was immediately noticed by the entertainment industry and was asked to make his first television appearance on Showtime's “Comedy Club Network.” Numerous television appearances soon followed including appearances on “The Keenan Ivory Wayans Show,” “Louie Anderson's Comedy Showcase,” Comedy Central's “Make Me Laugh,” NBC's “Friday Night Videos,” “The Mo’Nique Show”, Russell Simmons' “Def Comedy Jam,” his own BET “Comic View Grandstand Hour Special,” and “Comedy Central Presents: Arnez J.” He was most recently seen headlining Showtime’s “Shaquille O'Neal Presents: All Star Comedy Jam.”\n\nToday, Arnez is widely considered one of the best working artists, with a polished and highly entertaining standup routine that keeps his audiences entertained. In keeping with his plan, Arnez keeps up a dizzying pace performing for sold out crowds at arenas and other venues across the country.\n\nThe Thursday, Friday Late, and Sunday Shows Are 18+ | All Other Shows 21+ Unless Otherwise Stated\n\nTwo Drink Minimum Per Person Inside Of The Showroom\n\nValid Photo ID Is Required To Pick Up Your Tickets | You Can Also Print Out Your Tickets Or Pull Them Up On Your Smartphone!\n\nManagement Reserves The Right To Release Your Tickets/Seats If You Do Not Arrive By Scheduled Showtime\n\nALL SALES ARE FINAL AND NO REFUNDS WILL BE GIVEN UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES\n\nPLEASE DON'T PURCHASE TICKETS FROM ANY OTHER SITE.

MILLER is a comedian. He has been diligently working to make people laugh for over two and a half years because life is tragic and the best thing he can do is make you giggle and perhaps pee. He is famous in Norway. A skilled improviser, no show is ever the same. Let me repeat that- no show you ever see will be the same. Dare you? See them all? His hour-long comedy specials DEAR JONAH (YouTube), METICULOUSLY RIDICULOUS (HBO) and NO REAL REASON (Comedy Central) are available to stream now wherever streaming is streamed. His forthcoming special THE PHILOSOPHY CIRCUS showcases his talents as a clown, a juggler, and terrible ventriloquist. Is he a musician? No. However, he has two music albums, THE EXTENDED PLAY E.P., a hip-hop/pop/folk music E.P. with 41 tracks, and THE EXTENDED PLAY E.P.: THE ILLEGAL ART REMIXTAPE- available wherever fake music is listened to.\n\nMiller’s voice stars as Gene in the EMOJI MOVIE and Fred in Disney’s Academy Award-winning BIG HERO 6.

Don’t forget GORBURGER, a show so strange you’ll just have to google it.
