        "text": "Gird your loins for the tragic tale of Lady Jane Grey, the young Tudor noblewoman who was Queen of England for nine days and then beheaded in 1553... F*ck that. We're retelling history the way it should have happened: the damsel in distress saves herself. This is an epic tale of true love and high adventure set in an alt-universe of action, history, fantasy, comedy, romance, and rompy-pompy. Buckle up.\n\nIn 1553, Lady Jane Grey was crowned Queen of England. Nine days later, she lost the throne - and shortly thereafter, her head. But what if history were different?\n\nMy Lady Jane is a satirical comedic fantasy series that reimagines the rise and reign of Lady Jane Grey. When her ambitious mother sells Jane's hand to the highest bidder, Jane is dismayed to discover that her dreaded husband-to-be, Guildford Dudley, is an infuriatingly attractive stranger with a dark secret, one that has the potential to get them both killed. But there are greater conspiracies afoot, like a plot to murder her cousin, King Edward, and throw the entire kingdom into chaos.\n\nA sharp-tongued, warm-hearted story full of romance, adventure, and fantasy, My Lady Jane reveals that true love is real, people are not always what they seem, and even doomed heroines can save themselves. Long live the Queen."
