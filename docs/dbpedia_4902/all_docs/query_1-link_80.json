        "text": "Jarno Trulli was born in Pescara, Abruzzo, Italy. He first made his name as a World Champion in karting, before finding success in German Formula Three in 1996.\n\nThanks to the patronage of Flavio Briatore, he made his Grand Prix debut for Minardi in Australia in 1997. He showed well in his early outings for the team before being invited to join Prost mid-season to stand in for the injured Olivier Panis. He finished fourth at the Nurburgring and against the odds led in Austria in sensational style, before retiring. Jarno had to stand down when Panis returned, but landed a full time seat for the next two seasons alongside Olivier.\n\nThe Italian continued in F1 at Jordan and Renault, before switching to Toyota as a final step in his F1 career.\n\nFrancisco Sacco Landi, better known as Chico Landi was a racing driver from SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil. He participated in 6 Formula One Grands Prix, debuting on September 16, 1951. He scored a total of 1.5 championship points, awarded for his 4th place finish in the 1956 Argentine Grand Prix, a drive he shared with Gerino Gerini. Landi was the first Brazilian driver to drive a Ferrari in a Formula One race (Ferrari 375), albeit not for the works team. He drove one to victory at the Bari Grand Prix in 1948. He died in 1989 at the age of 88.\n\nTiago Vagaroso da Costa Monteiro was born on July 24, 1976 in Porto, Portugal. In 2003, Tiago had his first taste of a F1 car when he was testing with the Renault team at Barcelona. For the 2004 season, Monteiro was signed up as official test driver for the Minardi team.\n\nIn 2005, Tiago raced for the Jordan Team alongside Narain Karthikeyan. He there managed to finish 16 consecutive races, a new record for a rookie driver. He became 3rd at the 2005 US GP after all Michelin teams abandoned the race before the official start because of safety reasons.\n\nFor the 2006 season, Monteiro signed a contract with Midland F1.\n\nTonio Liuzzi was born on 6 August, 1981 in Locorotondo, Italy. In September 2004, Tonio had a test drive with Sauber. In November 2004, again he was given a test drive, this time with the new Red Bull team. The Italian was granted a raceseat for 2005 but had to share it with Christian Klien who was favoured and drove most of the races. Liuzzi signed a contract to move to Scuderia Toro Rosso, the second F1 team of Red Bull, in 2006."
