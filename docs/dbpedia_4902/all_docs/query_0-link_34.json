        "text": "üåü Introducing the Ferrari ‚Äò125 S‚Äô üåü The 1947 May 11th 125 S was Ferrari's first sports car and the first to use Colombo's revolutionary engine. Purpose-built for sports car racing, it won the company's debut race at the 1947 Grand Prix of Rome, driven by Franco Cortese. Of the ten races entered, the car won six, finished second in one, and retired in three. Cortese stated that when compared to his competitors, the 125 S \"was a more modern machine, indeed exceptional for those days.\" During its anniversary celebrations, Ferrari frequently refers to the 125 S as the beginning of its history, citing 1947 as the year it was founded. The 125 S was designed alongside the 125 F1 and debuted during the 1948 Grand Prix season. The engine of the open-wheel racer was similar to the one in the 125 S, with the exception of a single-stage supercharger, which was required by regulations. It debuted at the 1948 Italian Grand Prix, when its impressive performance persuaded Enzo to continue the company's expensive Grand Prix racing program. #Automotive#SolidBrain#Ferrari\n\nIn the 1920s and 1930s, sports racing cars experienced their golden age. These decades witnessed the greatest triumphs and innovations in the world of motor racing. Legendary racers such as Tazio Nuvolari, Louis Chiron and Gustave Larnek became famous behind the wheel of magnificent cars, among them the inevitable members of the Ferrari fleet. Italian automaker Enzo Ferrari founded his company in 1929 and quickly gained a reputation for creating superb racing cars. The models he produced were renowned for their elegance and unstoppable speed. But more importantly, each car was thought out to the smallest detail and assembled using advanced technology. The competitions of those years have gone down in history as the era of the greatest races: the Grand Prix, Le Mans, Targa Florio. These tracks became testing grounds for new technical solutions, and Ferrari cars embodied the best of them. The golden age of sports racing cars ended in the 1940s, when World War II brought changes to the automobile industry. But its legacy has continued to influence the future of motorsport and shape the image of Ferrari as a true legendary brand. #sportsracingcars #goldenage #1920s #1930s #motorsport\n\nWhen it comes to create the most amazing events, Ferrari is second to none in the automotive & motorsport industry. As Ferrari‚Äôs CEO Benedetto Vigna proudly said during the Gala Dinner in front of the top 400 Ferrari‚Äôs customers, this has been the most successful Finali Mondiali ever: +100 488 Challenge EVO +60 599XX/FXX/FXXK +30 Competizioni GT +15 F1 2 LMH Hypercars (Official WEC cars) 2 new models have been unveiled: the fantastic 296 Challenge and the most exclusive Corse Clienti‚Äôs car to date, the 499P Modificata which will be produced in 49 pieces at ‚Ç¨4.9 millions each‚Ä¶ Already sold out. Little to say and I strive to share this vision with all the investors and partners, motorsport offers the unparalleled access to the most exclusive lobbies and connections. Not only is a glamour environment but also offers solid and great performances when it comes to investments.

In the hallowed year of 1975, it emerged as a revolutionary force, introducing the world to a new era of Formula 1 innovation. The transversely mounted gearbox, a strategic departure, bestowed upon it a lower center of gravity, weaving a tale of stability and aerodynamic prowess that would resonate through time. Amidst the tubular steel space-frame chassis and the rhythmic hum of the 3.0-liter flat-12 engine, the 312T became a symphony on the track‚Äîan auditory signature of dominance that echoed across racing circuits globally. Niki Lauda and Clay Regazzoni, the virtuosos behind the wheel, carved a saga of victories, clinching triumphs in the 1975 and 1976 seasons. Yet, the story didn‚Äôt conclude with laurels and podium finishes. The Ferrari 312T evolved, each iteration‚Äîbe it the 312T2 or the 312T3‚Äîa testament to the resilience and adaptability demanded by the ever-evolving landscape of Formula 1. It transcended the realm of a mere racing car, becoming a beacon of inspiration for generations of motorsport enthusiasts and race engineering students alike. #Ferrari312T #f1 #f1driver #f1racing #F1iconiccarflashbacks\n\nüî• Formula 1 is back after a two-week break, and so are we with our Tech. The Australian Grand Prix left us with strong emotions. The teams put forward their boldest strategies and the drivers gave their best on the Melbourne circuit. ‚û°Ô∏è To read the teams' report on the third weekend of the 2024 season, follow this link: https://lnkd.in/dpaDUyGD Here are some highlights: üáÆüáπ Scuderia Ferrari: The Albert Park circuit is surely not a normal one and it can not represent a point of reference for analyzing a car; it is a semi-street circuit and has characteristic features that differentiate it from all the other tracks on the Fl calendar. Having said that, the SF-24 behaved very well there and this is another proof of the fact that, if the rear suspension problem (related to the return spring) is fixed, the car proves to have good potential. üá¶üáπ Red Bull Racing & Red Bull Technology: Since the beginning of the weekend, though, the current World Champion had been complaining about the aerodynamic balance of his car. As observed at the start of the season, this car is an extreme car, oriented to aerodynamic efficiency. It was a weekend full of surprises and twists that kept motorsport fans around the world glued to their screens. üèéÔ∏è Now we just have to look ahead, with the next Japanese Grand Prix scheduled for 7th April. We are ready to fly east and experience new emotions on the track! üáØüáµ #ScuderiaFerrari #RedBull #formula1\n\nüî• Rev up your engines and buckle up because the Formula 1 circus is back in town! üóûÔ∏è The Tech from the first Grand Prix of the season is finally out. Here are some sneak peaks: üáÆüáπ Scuderia Ferrari: Leap forward for the Scuderia Ferrari, as the SF- 24 seems to have a better base than last year‚Äôs car. Ferrari seem to have fixed this problem now and it is evident that the car reacts well to stresses. Regarding the suspension then, are the similar for every car, and it changes only their height in relation to aerodynamics. üá¨üáß McLaren Racing: The papaya team emerged from the inaugural Grand Prix of the 2024 season as the fourth-fastest team, with Red Bull, Ferrari but also Mercedes ahead of them. The MCL38 is an evolution of the MCL60: it's not a limit in the development, but on a practical level it affects the PU, as it's better to build the car around it. Having said that, there are no other big limits. For more detailed insights, check out the link provided (https://lnkd.in/dX5UFMVS) for a comprehensive overview of the weekend's action. üëÄ So, fasten your seatbelts and get ready for a rollercoaster ride of speed, strategy, and spectacle throughout the 2024 F1 season!üîú #McLaren #ScuderiaFerrari #f1\n\nFIA World Endurance Championship: can you name all participating manufacturers?
