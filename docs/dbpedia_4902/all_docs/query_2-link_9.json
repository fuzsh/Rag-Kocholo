        "text": "To be frank I have sympathy with First Sportz on this one. After all, how does one define Grand Prix? Is it anything with Grand Prix in the title, or a shorthand term for something of major international importance? Has nobody ever won the German Grand Prix because it was the Grosser Preis? Do we have to say that there has been a GP winner from Hong Kong because Albert Poon won the Macao GP? With the best will in the world the AGP was not a Grande Epreuve until 1985, and if you take that sort of definition of Grand Prix - perfectly legitimate so to do and in this context the natural meaning - then it is correct.\n\nThe sports history helps keep the modern sport alive for me.\n\nNot for me, though - I have lost all interest in current affairs!\n\nBut you're right, of course, and that's the main problem I see here. How are the young people going to get interested or even only get to appreciate the vast past of the sport if they are continually short changed in this lazy sort of manner. Nobody really NEEDS to know about the history, it's a luxury, but quite an enjoyable one as we all will attest here, yet current fans do not even get the chance to know about it because the (economical) powers that be live in this little bubble of EfffOne 'history' (i.e. statistics, mostly) and ignore everything else. It would be so easy to make a correct statement, without misleading the audience. It's just lazy entitlement that brings us here, and that's a sad loss for those who aren't allowed to know better.\n\nThe great, the good, and the grovelling attended the Governor's Grand Prix Ball at the govvies pad in Melbourne tonite.\n\nI'm always torn about attending these first class-piss-ups as a Republican but after the first two glasses of Taittinger my dominant side, hypocrisy, kicks in.\n\nIts the 60th anniversary of Bruce McLaren's 1964 Tasman Cup victory - the very first Tasman - in the 'very first McLaren’ - aboard a Cooper T70 Climax at Longford in March 1964. The same weekend in which Tim Mayer died in the other T70. When Teddy Mayer overcame his grief and decided he wanted a future in motor racing , the other key foundation piece of Bruce McLaren Motor Racing Ltd was in place.\n\nSo it's fitting that the remaining T70 owned by Melbourne man - and friend - Adam Berryman was on display.\n\nThe other highlight was a long chat to Vern and Jenny Schuppan. Vern turned 81 the other day and is trim, taut, terrific and sharp as a tack. They live in a penthouse apartment in the Adelaide Markets building on the old GP track, have a son who lives in Albert Park with whom they are staying this weekend, and a daughter who lives in Cambridge. They spend about three months a year in the UK, and in Portugal where they have had a home since the 1980s.\n\nGunther what’s-his-name the ‘Drive To Survive’ Star, couldn’t understand a word the prick said, but the chicks loved him.\n\nEdited by MarkBisset, 21 March 2024 - 13:08.\n\nIt's a bit sad of those decrying the pre-World Championship races as 'minor domestic races'...\n\nDo you understand how important those races were to Australians? I doubt you even have a glimmer of an idea.\n\nThe competitors would be from many distant places, they'd overcome many obstacles to get to the events, it was important. For instance, a decision was made in the late thirties that the race should have a serious national significance, it would rotate from state to state to make it truly national and no other race was allowed to carry the title 'Grand Prix'. Well, that latter one fell down temporarily in 1946 and 1958, but generally has held good.\n\nCompetitors bought or built cars just to make it to their Grand Prix with a chance of winning. Jack Brabham came home from Europe to compete in his home Grand Prix. Crowds turned out in droves to watch these 'minor domestic races'. Like 60,000 people in the hot January sun at Lobethal in the Adelaide Hills in 1939. Like the tens of thousands who crammed into Bathurst to see Englishman Peter Whitehead demolish the field in 1938. And when it was part of the Tasman Cup series, with a selection of current F1 drivers dominating proceedings, the crowd at Longford for the 1965 event was the equal of 10% of the population of Tasmania.\n\nTo discount these events from the lineage of the name, Australian Grand Prix, is an insult to those who raced in those events, those who travelled to see them and those who still recall them in vivid colour.\n\nInformation from the always reliable, accurate, trustworthy, and historically correct formula1.com site:\n\nVital statistics\n\nFirst Grand Prix – 1996 (first Australian Grand Prix held at Adelaide in 1985)\n\nTrack Length – 5.278km\n\nLap record – 1m 20.235s, Sergio Perez, 2023\n\nMost pole positions – Lewis Hamilton (8)\n\nMost wins – Michael Schumacher (4)\n\nTrivia – Almost a third of the field retired on the first lap back in 2002 when eight cars pulled out following a dramatic multi-car collision triggered by Ralf Schumacher’s Williams flying over the back of Rubens Barrichello’s Ferrari\n\nPole run to Turn 1 braking point – 271 metres\n\nOvertakes completed in 2023 – 74\n\nSafety Car probability – 67%\n\nVirtual Safety Car probability – 50%\n\nPit stop time loss – 20.1 seconds (including 2.5s stationary)\n\nNeedless to suggest, somewhat myopic view of the event...\n\nOn a parallel note, it is the politics and handbags-at-dawn stuff that makes the history of motor sport so interesting to some of us.\n\nThe Jenkinson Syndrome of ignoring such goings on might be fine for enthusiasts and fans, but it tends to not serve the past, present, and even the future very well.\n\nWe despised, unwanted-and-unloved, and beneath-contempt historians tend to focus on such things because it is often more interesting than the racing itself, along with establishing context.\n\nThe FIA F1 web site is about as shallow and thin as one can get.

I was, for example, thoroughly intrigued and fascinated by the so-called 'FISA-FOCA' war, although I had a somewhat selective or warped view on it at the time.\n\nBut the more recent shenanigans have been more of a turn-off. While the sport has clearly changed enormously over time, I have clearly changed in some way too.\n\nI have become more and more interested in the history since my late teens (nigh on half a century ago), but I suspect I might be in the minority here in attending many current race meetings as well as historic ones.\n\nTo discount these events from the lineage of the name, Australian Grand Prix, is an insult to those who raced in those events, those who travelled to see them and those who still recall them in vivid colour.\n\nAgain, though, how are you defining \"Grand Prix\"? Anything with the name Grand Prix? Is Keith Holland a Grand Prix winner? Lee Han Seng? Billy Monger?\n\nLeaving the Tasman events aside (which of course were not won by domestic racers), at its highest the Australian GP before 1985 was a domestic race, often to a formula far below the elite levels. I would argue it's an insult to say that Max Stewart should be considered at a higher echelon than François Cevert or Jean Alesi for winning a couple of F2 races which happened to have a portentious title.\n\nIn the motor sport context, it is just as legitimate to discount the pre-1985 races when talking about the Australian GP as it is to discount the 1960s races when talking about the Singaporean GP.\n\nIt's a bit sad of those decrying the pre-World Championship races as 'minor domestic races'...\n\nDo you understand how important those races were to Australians? I doubt you even have a glimmer of an idea.\n\nYou seem to think that minor domestic race means one that no-one considers it important. All races are important to those involved - that much is blindingly obvious even to me. The banger races at Wimbledon Stadium were important to those racing or spectating. But nobody outside southern England gave a damn about them, just as nobody outside Australasia cared much about the pre-WC Australian GP. As far as I can see, just one of those races was won by a driver from outside Australia or NZ and that was Prost driving a Formula Pacific Ralt. Hardly the stuff of legends.\n\nThe British GP was won twice by French drivers in French Delage cars. But I doubt if those races are deemed anything but minor domestic races, even in Byfleet or Weybridge, and I would regard anyone who counted them in the tally of British GPs as being a tad over pedantic. I can sort of understand someone wanting to include two Maserati victories in the tally of British GP winning marques as these were at least to F1 regulations and had a few international entries.\n\nEdited by BRG, 21 March 2024 - 16:48.\n\nActually, for the most part I tend to tune out almost all of the \"auto racing history\" stuff from the Winston Smith brigade of scribes along with the usual bullshit from those \"journalists\" who rarely (if ever) let facts get in the way of a good story.\n\nThat the history of motor sport extends beyond the provenance of a particular car/chassis or the race data for an event or the record of a personality or so on and so forth might certainly be a difficult concept for some to grasp, of course.\n\nHistory is both a contact sport and an often odd communal/solo process.\n\nHow we interpret the past certainly changes for a variety of reasons, but facts based upon solid evidence, usually archival material, still tend to be facts.\n\nThat there was an Australian Grand Prix in 1928 and a Canadian Grand Prix in 1961 and a United States Grand Prix for Sports Cars in 1958 are facts.\n\nEtcetera, etcetera, und so wieder...\n\nAnd these people call themselves historians. They seem to forget completely that the meaning of the words \"Grand Prix\" have changed considerably over the years. The first Grand Prix (in motor racing), the 1906 French GP (if I am not mistaken) was a proper top-line event, yet quite different from what we consider a Grand Prix to be today. There have been many years where a lot of races were called Grand Prix, and certainly not only the most important one in a country (sometimes also regarded as the national Grand Prix). Even some front-line countries have selected a sports car race to be their national Grand Prix, because they couldn't win what we now consider the logical race to wear that title. Also there were races, not intended for the top echelon, F1, GP-formula, even F2 (1952-53) called Grand Prix, and doubtless many minor races as well, some lost in the fogs of time. And we should not forget those countries where the name Grand Prix was translated into their own language (Grote Prijs, Gran Premio, Magyar Nagdij etc.\n\nAnother substantial difference came in 1950 when the series of World Championships was started. Initially the majority of races for that championship was called Grand Prix, even the national Grand Prix, but not all of them (Indianapolis!). Besides, there were many races outside the championship that were still called Grand Prix. Some would later join the championship, others didn't. Sometimes there were more than one race per country in the world championship (Pescara/Monza, Sebring/Indianapolis etc.) After 1960 that more or less stabilized for many years, until The USA again got more than one Grand Prix. By now, the rules and the power behind the World Championship was changing a lot, even though successive races never showed a sudden break in development because of that. Non championship races (for Formula 1) became a thing of the past, and the name Grand Prix was suddenly being owned, with the end result that nobody else (in motor racing) could use that name anymore. That was more than 40 years ago, and in those years the wording Grand Prix got more and more the meaning of \"a race in the World Championship\"\n\nNow if today's journalist writes an article intended for today's fanbase, it is quite correct that he uses today's meaning of the word Grand Prix. It is nowhere necessary to give the whole history of the changing meaning of \"Grand Prix\" for his public, because they don't know and don't care. People here don't need that explanation as well, because most of us know perfectly well what has happened (because We do care).\n\nEdited by Henk Vasmel, 21 March 2024 - 17:46.\n\nAnd these people call themselves historians.\n\nActually, they tend to refer to themselves as \"auto racing Historians\" or something very similar.\n\nThey do not tend to be, for the most part it seems, actual historians, but that is of little concern since \"historians\" tend to be very suspect people, of course, making those horrid displays of the knowledge they may have acquired through years of research and scholarship versus simply reading what is on a web site.\n\nAfter all, those wretched, terrible historians tend to muddy the waters with their use of nuance, complexity, and even perplexity in developing their interpretations of the past.\n\nAs Henk points out, there is more than a bit of scattered dots to connect in the past regarding all this.\n\nOne should realize that even the summary Henk provides is subject to question/revision in some aspects, although what he provides is easily better than whatever else is floating around out there.\n\nOne should realize that even the summary Henk provides is subject to question/revision in some aspects.\n\nOh, certainly. I wrote it in a short period of time, while also having something else to take care of. The big sin is that I sent it on the same day that I wrote it. Opinion pieces (like this, as opposed to a collection of easily identifiable facts) should wait a bit for a second review and only sent after that. And I didn't have the chance to discuss with somebody who also knows about these things. So it tends to be a bit quick and one-sided. But a discussion here about it is fine, of course.\n\nThat the Pau Grand Prix pre-dated the French Grand Prix, I missed (Google is your worst enemy, after Bing). I now realize that I knew that, but it didn't pop up in the right moment.\n\nThe shallowness shines through, the ensign and BRG show clearly...\n\nProst and Moreno? I will declare quite frankly that those particular races, the Formula Atlantic events on the piddly Calder circuit, were those least deserving of the 'Grand Prix' title.\n\nEnsign, I covered (I think adequately) the point you've again raised the point about applying the 'Grand Prix' title in a haphazard fashion. You might like to read it again, the decision was made in the late thirties that there would be only one event in Australia called by that title annually. I added that this rule was broken in 1946 (the NSW Grand Prix at Nowra Naval Air Base) and 1958 (the Melbourne Grand Prix named for Stirling Moss and Jack Brabham disputing it in then-current F! Coopers), I forgot the Patriotic Grand Prix in Perth, which raIsed funds for some aspect of World War II in 1941 and the Victory Grand Prix held in the euphoria of the end of that war at Caversham in WA.\n\nHowever, there's something else I feel needs to be taken into account. Using French terms such as 'Grand Prix' is not a natural thing in Australia, it takes some serious application and would have been even harder to sell in the twenties and thirties. My parents, for instance, with country backgrounds, could not pronounce it correctly right through the sixties and they were not alone.\n\nSo the application of that name to an event originally termed '100 Miles Road Race' at Phillip Island in 1928 was a very serious attempt to elevate the status of this race. It was the main motor race held in all of Australia each year. Even at Phillip Island, the 1933 Grand Prix could readily have been overshadowed by a 300-mile event celebrating the centenary of Victoria, it wasn't. The Australian Grand Prix prevailed.\n\nThe only one of the races I listed which could fall into the realms of a 'minor domestic race' was the 1927 affair at Goulburn.\n\nSo why have I landed heavily on the ensign and BRG so heavily?\n\nBecause they mention Prost and Moreno as examples of races of local stature won by a visiting driver of international stature.\n\nHave they not heard of the 1956 Australian Grand Prix at Albert Park? Did they not note that it's not in my list of races won by Australians?\n\nFeaturing several then-current F1 cars and drivers and run over what was then close to a full Grand Epreuve distance, surely it counts?\n\nShould I also delve into the Max Stewart reference for its ills? \"A couple of F2 races which happened to have a portentious title\" indeed...\n\nHave they not heard of the 1956 Australian Grand Prix at Albert Park?\n\nI cannot speak for ensign but, no, I had not heard about that race. If pressed, I might have said that there probably was a race called that in 1956 but that I knew no details of it. I am not a living encyclopedia of minor domestic races. Just because four overseas drivers competed does not make it a big deal, even if one was Stirling Moss. During the Supertouring era of the BTCC, there were often more than four overseas drivers on the grid, but that did not make the series any more relevant globally.\n\nJust because some Australians chose to call their race a \"Grand Prix\" did not make it necessarily a major world event. I am sorry that your national pride is hurt, but you need to be realistic."
