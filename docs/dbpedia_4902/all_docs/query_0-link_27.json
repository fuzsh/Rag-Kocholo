With only 1500 cc, Peter finished third overall in the Delage! This was the first time in about 60 years that anyone had heard a Delage 15-S-8 run in anger -- the scream of the engine is incredible!\n\nGroup 2A, 1927-1951 Racing Cars. The best race of the day, and possibly the whole weekend, in some of the most legendary race cars. Three drivers took turns leading and traded places at least 15 times over the course of nine laps. It was beautiful to watch - a skillful, safe and fair exhibition made more impressive by the drivers coaxing 107 mph speeds out of these great automobiles. Paddins Dowling, 1939 Maserati 4Cl, sat on the pole for this race, but slipped back to the fourth spot early as Jeffrey O'Neill's 1957 Maserati 250F, a later F-1 car somewhat out of place in this group, moved to the front, only to give up the lead on Lap 2 on a beautiful pass in the hairpin by Peter giddings in the legendary 1926 Delage 15-S-8.

Â Giddings stated of the developing consignment list, \"Racing memories come flooding back when I eye the supreme list of cars consigned to the Monterey sale. The 750 Monza truly tugs at the heart strings; having driven both 750 and 860 variants, the Lampredi engine is a real stump-puller in the torque department. Â The Maserati A6CGS/53 is another landmark. Â Credited for inventing the twin nostril nose, Fantuzzi surely designed and built the most beautiful of all coachwork.\"\n\nÂ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSPOKANE FESTIVAL OF SPEED\n\nAt the 2013 Spokane Festival of Speed, June 1-2, Peter finished first in class and fourth overall in Race Group 1.

There were a fair number of cars in the pre-war group, most driving rather sedately, a few vigorously. One of the vigorous ones was an old Alfa. Every lap the Alfa would come through our corner in a partial drift, with the rear trying to spin out, and the driver sawing at the wheel, but with the hammer down. Sure enough, on one lap the car did skid, sending the car off the road to the inside, then starting to roll when the left front wheel hit a slight bank, then completing the roll as the front end jumped the ditch. The car came to rest about 100 feet from the corner with the front on one side of the ditch and the rear on the other side, and the back of the car resting on the driver's head! Of course, no roll bar! We thought we had a fatality for sure. The corner captain and I rush over with the fire bottle and crouch down in the ditch beside the car.
