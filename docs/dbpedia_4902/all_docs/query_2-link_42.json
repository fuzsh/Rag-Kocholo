        "text": "1957\n\n\"El Maestro's greatest lesson\"\n\n​\n\nHaving won the 1956 World Championship, Alberto Ascari was on the top of the world. Il Ciccio had not Only managed to give Lancia their first ever Championship, but that was now his 4th ever title, tying him With the late Achille Varzi. Coming into 1957, Lancia had a great, if aging car and a trio of great Drivers. But even then, everyone knew that once this season was over, Ascari would retire and focus on Sportscar racing, where he would support Lancia along with Castellotti. Over at Ferrari, Mike Hawthorn was back from his trip to BRM, with the young Brit joining Peter Collins to wave the Italian flags of Ferrari. Perhaps the biggest news of the year was Juan Manuel Fangio's return to Maserati, and Stirling Moss joining Tony Brooks over at Vanwall. While the former had already won a Championship With Fangio in '54, Maserati had struggled to replicate their results the previous two years, with Moss coming the closest to lifting the trophy with the Scuderia. But, the new V12-powered 250F looks as fast as it looks, and Fangio is confident that he could win it once more. Vanwall on the other hand presented their first car after spending the last couple of years driving modified Ferraris. With the new VW5, Stirling Moss is hopeful that he could finally step off Ascari and Fangio's shadow and Become Britain's greatest by winning the title.\n\nThe season-opener was like an overture of what was to come, with Fangio dominating the Argentine Grand Prix with his teammate Jean Behra in second place. The Argentine crowd, under the scorching heat of January watched on as the Maseratis finished 1-2-3-4. It was a perfect start for the Italian team, and a show of force thanks to their new V12. Ferrari's team looked down in the dumps, and so did Lancia. Alberto Ascari could only retire in the final laps and let go of 3rd place, as he watched on how the magnificent Maserati machines drove, while Enzo Ferrari was probably baffled by the fact his cars didn't finish, yet the 5 year old 555 \"Supersqualo\" driven by Jose Froilan Gonzalez did.\n\nFangio's conquest continued on in Monaco, but not without having an eventful few laps. Stirling Moss was the one that led at the beginning, but crashed at the chicane. This started a chain reaction in which Peter Collins crashed out at the harbour, followed by Mike Hawthorn ramming into poor Eugenio Castellotti. With Ascari remaining 3rd for most of the race, the Italian comfortably finished behind Tony Brooks, who scored his first podium, but the main star was Fangio, as he now led Behra and Brooks by 11 points. The Maserati was unbelievably quick and above else - reliable. It would take significantly more effort by the other teams to catch up like this. Ferrari's 801 was nowhere near as fast as it was the previous year, and Lancia's D50A was now a dated machine. Vanwall on the other hand could smile, knowing that they had a relatively good car that might take it to the Maseratis if the stars allign.\n\nThe scenes of Hawthorn's Ferrari smashing into Castellotti's Lancia\n\n​\n\nFrance finally saw Lancia reply to this Maserati domination, with their brand new V6-powered D60. The slick little machine was a low-revving, but powerful car capable of 276 hp, and Luigi Musso demonstrated its power by outrunning Behra to the flag, thus scoring his first ever win. With the D60 winning in its first outing, it was now game on, but only if the Lancias could hold on.\n\nMusso behind the wheel of the D60 in his first ever win\n\n​\n\nBritain saw further trouble for Fangio as he ended up retiring from the Grand Prix, while the Vanwalls finally came into their own. Stirling Moss, along with Tony Brooks won in Aitree after dominating the race, but Luigi Musso grabbed all the attention by finishing 2nd, thus bringing him up to only two points behind Fangio. All of a sudden, Fangio's cushion was gone, and El Maestro would need to bring out his heygame if he wanted to take the title. What followed was something out of a movie...\n\nNurburgring-Nordschleiffe, August the fourth. Fangio sits in the pole position, his fourth of the season, ahead of Mike Hawthorn and Jean Behra. In a race where He would need to win in order to make another safe cushion, Fangio would get to do it on his favourite track. As expected, El Maestro got away and led the race with a planned pit stop mid race. He drove with less fuel than anyone else, and with a lighter car - he was able to go significantly quicker than anyone else. Ascari, having gone through a miserable year soon enough retired, while the Lancia D60 was proving to be a hassle to control through the twisty Nordschleiffe track. Hawthorn and Collins both cruised in 2nd and 3rd, hoping to bring some points to Maranello after their miserable few races. Then, Fangio finally pitted with a 30 second lead, and it all went terribly wrong. Maserati's mechanics failed to notice a single nut roll under the car as they removed the tyres, and they spend almmost a minute looking for it, all while Fangio puffed one along the garage and looked on in disbelief. By the time they were done, the Ferraris were almost a minute ahead of Fangio, and El Maestro just decided and sit back and drive to the end. But, with every lap, that gap was getting smaller, and the lap record was being broken. Over the course of nine laps, Fangio chased down the Ferraris and broke the lap record every single time until he finally catched the red cars and passed them on the grass! In one of the greatest ever drives, on Grand Prix Racing's greatest track, El Maestro pulled off his finest lesson in which he made one of the finest charges not seen since the days of Tazio Nuvolari. He claimed that he never drove that fast before, and that he only now mastered the Nurburgring.\n\nFangio leading the two Ferraris\n\n​\n\nFollowing the masterclass in Germany, Fangio would finish 2nd two more times, each time behind Stirling Moss, who brought Vanwall two more wins under their belt. The win in Pescara is especially notable, with that being the longest track ever visited by the Grand Prix circus. The track was so long, so dangerous that Ferrari outright forbid his drivers to go there, while Ascari had to stop at a gas station to get some fuel for his Lancia. The next Grand Prix in Monza then saw the last ever win done by a Streamlined car, with Moss dominating the procedure. Perhaps most symbolically, both Ascari and Fangio scored their final podiums of their careers, and they both shook hands with the man to whom they were passing the torch of greatness - Stirling Moss. With the Asian flu spreading during this time of year, both Ascari and Moss wouldn't start their engines for the inaugural Morocco Grand Prix, and Jean Behra led the rest of the drivers home to take his first, and Maserati's 4th and last Grand Prix win of the year.\n\nThe layout of the Pescara for the Coppa Ciano race\n\nAnd so, Juan Manuel Fangio has finished his career with a fourth title, followed by his greatest apprentice in Moss. With the retirement of both El Maestro and Alberto Ascari, Grand Prix racing was entering the 1958 season without a defending champion, and more notably - without the two men who marked this decade with their great, and gentlemanly rivaalry. Alberto Ascari and Juan Manuel Fangio - the two greatest drivers of the era, are now both hanging up their racing helmets, in what was El Maestro's greatest lesson.\n\nThe championship table\n\n​\n\nWhile the season remains largely similiar to the real 1957, Lancia takes its only win of the year courtersy to what would be the 246 IRL. With them having Vittorio Jano, I think the 246 would have debuted a little earlier, meaning Ferrari will now have to rely on Carlo Chitti's prowess. With both Fangio and Ascari retiring, both Ferrari and Lancia remain with young and promising drivers, while Vanwall is poised to strike with their VW5. Tune in next time for 1958 - A Gentleman's race.\n\n1958\n\n\"A gentleman's race\"\n\n​\n\nWith 1957 coming to a close, a change of guard took place in Grand Prix Racing, one on a magnitude not seen since 1949. Juan Manuel Fangio and Alberto Ascari, two of the sport's greatest Drivers who carried the torch for almost an entire decade were both retiring from Formula 1. While Ascari was simply pulling back to sportscar racing where he would dominate the sport with Lancia and Castellotti, Fangio was retiring for good, after equalling his great Italian rival with four championships. Maserati, having won two championships were pulling out of racing as well due to the ever-increasing costs, along with their finances getting worse during the late 50s, leaving privateers to delve into Grand Prix Racing with their 250F. Lancia would now have to rely on Eugenio Castellotti and Luigi Musso, with Vittorio Jano's D60 receiving an update to its engine, while Ferrari brought in a new and menacing 412 - a V12-powered beast that was a killer at the high-speed tracks, but also a rather stable machine that could navigate the twisty tracks of Monaco and Aintree. Vanwall remained with the VW5, and the reliable trio of Stirling Moss, Tony Brooks and Stuart Lewis-Evans, but they wouldn't appear until the second race of the season in Monaco, so Moss would drive a one-off with Cooper, an unknown minnow team thus far run largely by privateers thanks to its cheap chassis.\n\nYet, it was exactly those minnows who won the first two races of the season, to the shock of everyone in Formula 1! In Argentina, Stirling Moss drove a characteristic race of great patience and skill, and he capitalised on Ferrari having to pit and Eugenio Castellotti's Lancia missfiring to win Cooper's first ever race, while Maurice Trintignant proved that this win was no fluke by dominating the Monaco Grand Prix. Outraged by this once small team winning, along with using an unconventional rear-engined design - Enzo Ferrari labeled the Cooper team as \"Garagistas\". To the old man, these were peasants that made cars due to them not knowing how to make engines. To Vittorio Jano and Gianni Lancia though, this was an interesting design that might just be the gateway to F1's future... Another member of Formula 1's future also showed up in Monaco, that being Colin Chapman and his team Lotus.\n\nStirling Moss behind the wheel of the rea-engined Cooper\n\n​\n\nAt Holland, Stirling Moss continued his run of great form by winning the Grand Prix, this time behind the wheel of the Vanwall. Speaking of Vanwall - the VW5 was class of the field, with Tony Brooks dominating the procedures in the Belgian Grand Prix, only for his VW5 to conk out at the final turn. Mike Hawthorn, who was second, then had his gearbox braking, while Stuart Lewis-Evans suffered a suspension failure. This absolute mayhem meant that out of nowhere, Eugenio Castellotti won his second ever race, thus making him the 3rd different winner of the season, and propelling Lancia to the title fight. Another great story of this race was the emergence of Grand Prix Racing's first lady in Maria Teresa de FIlippis, who drove a quiet but brave race in her private Maserati.\n\nMaria Teresa de Filippis - F1's first lady\n\n​\n\nFrance saw the Ferrari 412 showing its power, as Mike Hawthorn outran all of his rivals to claim his first win in 4 years. Castellotti finished second after chasing the Ferrari throughout the whole race, but that was all overshadowed when, to the horror of everyone watching - Luigi Musso's Lancia rolled down the fields of Reims. Musso was one of the most consistent drivers thus far in the season, and he was doing a great job supporting Lancia in the constructors championship. Luigi Musso; Maria de Filippis' fiancee, was a great rival to Hawthorn and Collins, and a loyal friend to Ascari and Castellotti, his Lancia sang through the Reims one last time. He was only 33.\n\n​\n\nFollowing his retirement in France, along with several previous disputes, Peter Collins was thrown out of Scuderia Ferrari after three years of loyalty. The young Briton angered Enzo Ferrari with his supposed playboy lifestyle, along with him owning a yacht in Monaco. The Scuderia deemed that he was no longer focusing on racing, and promptly sacked him, to the anger of Mike Hawthorn. Out of spite, Collins joined Lancia - and he dominated the British Grand Prix at Aintree. But, just a race later - Lancia curse would strike once again, as Peter Collins lost his life in the Nurburgring while chasing Tony Brooks, who won his first race on that very same track. With two men dying for Lancia in a space of a month, the Italian team was thrown into a complete crisis, and Eugenio Castellotti in particular was hit by this horrible turn of events. He would not race in Portugal, and thus dropped out of the championship fight.\n\nThe remans of Collins' Lancia\n\n​\n\nIn Portugal though, Stirling Moss had a golden chance to extend his Championship lead. Not only did he dominate the Grand Prix, but Mike Hawthorn was disqualified from the race after restarting his car following an incident. But, in a great display of sportsmanship, Moss protested the disqualification and claimed that Hawthorn did nothing wrong. Having done that, Mike Hawthorn retained his 4 point lead over Moss, and only extended it when Moss retired in the following Italian Grand Prix. With Mike finishing 2nd behind Tony Brooks, and with Stirling retiring - Mike Hawthorn had extended his lead to 8 points over Moss. With an assured championship in his hands, Mike began to think about writing a children's book, but something more sinister loomed over poor Mike during his final months, as his kidney infection was worsening...\n\nHawthorn in front of Brooks, Castellotti and Moss\n\n​\n\nThe final race of the season was once again held under the scorching sun in Morocco, where Stirling Moss signed off his year in style by winning his fourth grand Prix of 1958, thus Vanwall won the inaugural Constructors Championship, while Mike Hawthorn had the prestige of becoming Britain's first ever champion. Unfortunately, only 3 months after lifting the championship crown, Mike Hawthorn left the world when he suffered a Fatal crash on a highway. The news shocked F1, as one of the generations' greatest Drivers died. Having lost two of their best Drivers, Ferrari was on course for an overhaul for the following season, while Vanwall hoped that their championship defense would be sharp with Tony Brooks and Stuart Lewis-Evans driving for them. Finally, this tragic year could be left behind, and 1959 could be awaited. Tune in next time for 1959 - \"The horse pushes the carriage\"\n\nMike Hawthorn, Peter Collins and Luigi Musso\n\nGone, but not forgotten\n\nChampionship standings\n\nConstructors Championship\n\n​\n\n1959\n\n\"The horse pushes the carriage\"\n\n​\n\nAfter the horrors of 1958, in which three drivers lost their lives (2 of them during the races), a change of guard within both Lancia and Ferrari followed after both teams lost their Drivers. Jean Behra, after a brief spell in BRM was now heading to Ferrari, while Lancia hired Britain's Cliff Allison, mostly for the development of their D60 and the upcoming and highly anticipated D70P. Ferrari stuck to their 412, and Vanwall introduced an upgraded version of their car - the VW59. Cooper, which had shocked everyone the previous two years introduced their new T51 design, with a refined rear-engined model that looked years ahead of everything else in the competition. Finally, BRM entered their fourth year in Grand Prix Racing with the old P25, and they hoped that this would finally be their year.\n\nDue to monetary reasons, the Argentine Grand Prix would not take place this year. Already in the previous year, there was organisational trouble when the British Teams refused to show up, leading to a grid of only 10 cars. Now though, Argentina lost her place in the calendar, and Monaco had the distinct prestige of opening the new Grand Prix season. In its first outing, Jack Brabham dominated the race in his T51, beating out Tony Brooks in the Vanwall to take his first ever win, and a Dominant one at that. It was a sign of what's to come this year, and Brabham looked very much pleased.\n\nThe start of the Monaco Grand Prix. Note the wide grill of the Lancia\n\n​\n\nWith such a Dominant display in Monaco for the second time in two years, it had finally become apparent that this success by Cooper was no fluke at all. The rear-engined, nimble machine was lighter than anything else on the grid, and combined with its center of gravity being more towards the middle of the car, it was a beast through the corners. With all of that factored in, everyone expected another Cooper Demonstration in Zandvoort. Yet, The Dutch Grand Prix saw a sensation as Jo Bonnier managed to hold off both Coopers of Jack Brabham and Masten Gregory, and the Swedish driver lifted his hand in triumph as he finally brought BRM's first ever win. After years of hard work and failed projects, the Owen Racing Organisation could breathe a sigh of relief, knowing that their P25 had given them something to celebrate for. Bonnier himself was a largely obscure driver in this time, and he would never drive so well ever again for the next 8 years of his career. It was a one win wonder in any sense of the word, but one that won't be forgotten.\n\nJo Bonnier taking BRM's maiden Grand Prix win\n\n​\n\nFrance saw the Grand Prix Circus coming over to their usual location in Reims, and Tony Brooks outran his rivals to take Vanwall to its 8th ever win. While it didn't look like it by then, this would be Tony Brooks' last ever win, and he would only score three more top 3s for the duration of his career. His subsequent drive in Aintree before his Vanwall conked out, saw Tony struggling all the way while the Coopers outran the rest of the competition. Both Ferrari and Lancia didn't show up for the British GP due to Italian strikes, and the next Grand Prix in the Nurburgring was expected to be another Cooper demonstration. But, Lancia came in to Germany with an ace up their sleeve, that being the D70P (P standing for \"Posteriore\"). The first mid-engined car by a non-British manufacturer, the D70P was a slick looking machine with a small but powerful V6 Jano Engine, and Eugenio Castellotti demonstrated the car's immediate pace by outrunning Tony Brooks, while Jean Behra scored his first podium for Ferrari, starting a three-race streak in which the Frenchman dragged through what had thus far been a terrible season for the Prancing Horse.\n\nThe Lancia D70P was already tested in Monaco, but it made its debut in the Nurburgring\n\n​\n\nFollowing the win in Germany, Castellotti was propelled into championship contention along with Brooks and Brabham, who had a tricky run of form after dominating in Britain, but the trio of drivers then had a new challenger in Stirling Moss. Indeed, the man who had been Fangio's Prodigy transferred to Cooper after a miserable campaign with BRM, and his two wins in Portugal and Monza meant that all of a sudden, Moss was Brabham's closest rival in the championship.\n\nHeading into the final race of the season, Grand Prix Racing would return to the United States since 1937, when Mercedes' Rudolf Caracciola won the Vanderbilt Cup. Held at Sebring, the new US Grand Prix had the privilege of hosting the season finale in which Jack Brabham, Stirling Moss, Eugenio Castellotti and Tony Brooks all had a chance to become champions for the first time. Cooper reinforced themselves with the hiring of Stuart Lewis-Evans, who spent his 1959 season struggling with Vanwall and mostly trying to support Brooks in any way possible. Now that he was in Cooper thanks to his friend Bernie Ecclestone, Evans was hopeful that he'll score his first victory in Grand Prix Racing.\n\nThe Qualifying saw local favourite Harry Schell Qualifying third to the joy of the crowd, but was protested by every single team as his lap came right at the end of the Qualifying session, so almost everyone thought it didn't count. Lancia's and Vanwall's personell kept on arguing with the organisers, demanding that Schell would be placed back in 11th where his original time would have taken him, and the shouting match went on even as the Star Spangled banner was being sung. In the end, Schell started 3rd.\n\nAt the start, Moss led away ahead of Brabham and Castellotti, but Tony Brooks suffered a disaster once Wolfgang von Trips rammed him at the first corner. Brooks limped back into the pits with his battered Vanwall, and spent an additional two minutes checking for damage. Once it was confirmed that the VW59 was good to go for the rest of the race - Brooks booked it for what would arguably be his greatest race. Back at the front, Moss continued to lead ahead of Brabham, but he most probably cursed his luck when, in Typical Moss fashion - his Cooper's gearbox failed, and the Brit would once again have to retire and look on as his Championship rivals duked it out. Castellotti remained close behind Brabham and was poised to strike, but his Lancia's clutch then began to slip, and soon enough his D70P could no longer go on.\n\nMeanwhile at the back, Tony Brooks charged through the pack in a desperate attempt to catch up to the leaders, and by the final laps - he was right behind Maurice Trintignant and Bruce Mclaren in the battle for 2nd position. But, Brabham continued to dominate the race, and it looked like he would take his first Championship in a Dominant fashion. That is, until the Aussie's Cooper began to sputter, and he ran out of fuel! Right at the main Airport straight of the circuit, Brabham was now forced to stop. Bruce Mclaren, who emerged from the final corner and began to slow down, but Brabham frantically waved him to keep going, while Brooks was now right up Mclaren's butt. In a spectacular photo finish, Bruce Mclaren came first to take his first ever victory and to become Grand Prix's youngest race winner. With Mclaren taking the win, The young Kiwi managed to defend Brabham's Championship lead. In a spectacular season finale, Cooper have manage to win their first Constructors Championship along with their best driver in Jack Brabham becoming Australia's first Grand Prix Champ. It was a change of the era, where the Rear-Engined car would replace the Front-engined design. Stirling Moss would never again come this close to winning the championship, and neither would Tony Brooks. Jack Brabham on the other hand, had embarked on his journey to become one of Formula 1's finest men, and one of the sports' greatest pioneers. Up next, Lancia strikes back despite a consistent run of bad luck, while Brabham now has the task of keeping that crown on his head. Next time in 1960 - it's \"Red Vs Green\".\n\nJack Brabham desperately pushing his Cooper over the finish line\n\nChampionship standings\n\nConstructors Championship\n\n​\n\n1960\n\n\"Green vs Red\"\n\n​\n\nJack Brabham's Championship triumph, and on a larger scale Cooper's domination of the 1959 season was a change of an era in Grand Prix Racing. Not only was 1959 the first season where a driver from Oceania won a title, but it was also the last time a front-engined car would win a Grand Prix. Indeed, that win in Holland by Jo Bonnier in the green BRM P25 was the last time a car with an engine in front of the driver would ever cross the finish line 1st, and Lancia's transition into a rear-engined car was a further showing of teams seeing this design as the future. BRM would debut their Mid-engined design this year as well, and so would Lotus. But despite all of this, Ferrari remained traditional and stuck to their thirsty, heavy, V12-powered Tipo 412, with Jean Behra leading the Prancing Horse, who himself was opposed to the new designs by the \"Garagistas\".\n\nAmidst all the politicking by the teams, there was a race to be held in January over at Argentina, where Eugenio Castellotti Demonstrated Lancia's superiority over Cooper. Il Bello could be seen smiling as he gave his wife Delia Scalla a kiss. Monaco though saw the debut of Colin Chapman's first masterpiece, when his Lotus Type 18 dominated the Monaco Grand Prix, with Stirling Moss taking his 2nd ever win in the principality, and also the British Team's first ever victory. However, with Castellotti 2nd and Brabham disqualified, the pretty Italian in his Bordeaux car looked rather comfortable in 1st place. But, a rather bleak omen would occur for Lancia when Cliff Allison would ram into the barriers of the Monaco Harbour, sending the young Brit flying off his D60. Allison was left in a critical condition, and it would take months for him to recover until he could even walk. Nonetheless, American Richie Ginther was there to help Lancia qualify both cars for the Grand Prix. The young man from Hollywood was an expert at developing race cars, and he was the one that put in the most miles on the D70P, and His two 6th places in Monaco and Holland showed that he was also a quality racer.\n\nCliff Allison's career-ending crash\n\n​\n\nAnother American soon enough showed up for Lancia in Dan Gurney, who had shown some phenomenal skill over at the sportscar division of Lancia. But, the talented Yankee ran into misfortune when his brakes failed, and he rolled down a hill where an unfortunate Dutchman lost his life. With one spectator dead and two major injuries occurring in the space of a week, Lancia's credibility in motorsport was put into question, and the Italian team was brought into court for the duration of the season, just as Castellotti and Jano had to focus on making a championship campaign.\n\nThe remains of Dan Gurney's Lancia\n\n​\n\nIt was right in Holland where Championship defender Jack Brabham finally put things into motion, with the Aussie taking a firm win, followed by a second place in Belgium, where Castellotti won. But, the Belgian Grand Prix would be remembered for all the wrong reasons when on lap 20 - Chris Bristow went off line at Malmedy while battling for sixth place with the Ferrari of Mairesse. Bristow lost control, crashing into a four-foot high embankment and was thrown from his car, and landed on a barbed wire which beheaded him.\n\nFive laps later, Alan Stacey was hit in the face by a bird at Masta, causing his car to crash, then somersault off the track and land in a field. The car then caught fire, and Stacey, still trapped inside, was burned to death. The sheer horror of such crashes taking place was unimaginable, let alone them happening at the same race. The two Fatal incidents prompted Stirling Moss to react and begin to discuss with his fellow Drivers about a possible association in which they, as drivers, could negotiate with the CIS about the safety standards of the tracks, or lack thereof.\n\nThe scenes of the Belgian Grand Prix\n\n​\n\nAlthough Castellotti showed a great form thus far, the ongoing crisis within Lancia over the court case effectively stopped any sort of development of the D70P, and the subsequent French Grand Prix saw Eugenio finish 12th after his gearbox bit the dust, While Brabham entered a three race streak that went in from Holland to UK. The British Grand Prix also saw Vanwall introduce their response to the rear-engine craze in the VW14, driven by debutant John Surtees. The young motorcycle champ was entering his first few races in 1960, and he was already impressing everyone, While Tony Brooks was looking more and more demotivated as the season wore on. Portugal saw Surtees finally establish himself as a future star when he outran the Coopers to the checkered flag.\n\nJohn Surtees behind the race-winning Vanwall VW14\n\n​\n\nEntering the final two races of the season, Brabham sat head and shoulders above Castellotti in 1st place, with a 14 point lead. But, the organizers of Monza had different ideas, and they decided to go against what the Drivers demanded, and they kept the layout of the Monza 10K circuit, complete with its bankings. Outraged, the British Teams collectively withdrew from the event, leaving the Italian Teams and a bunch of privateers to fight it out for the Italian Grand Prix. Lancia dominated the event, and Jean Behra took Ferrari's only podium of the year, while Maria Teresa de Filippis became the first woman to score points in Grand Prix Racing History. Despite this great win, and with himself closing to Brabham up to 6 points, Eugenio Castellotti announced that he would not race in the last Grand Prix of the season in the United States, citing how he would stay in Italy and develop the upcoming Lancia D80 for the 1961 season. Unbeknownst to everyone, there was more to this than the people thought.\n\nWith Castellotti not showing up in the USA, Brabham was pronounced the World Champion for the 2nd consecutive time, while also making Cooper Constructor Champions once again. The American Grand Prix itself was held in Riverside, California. Stirling Moss led away the proceedings, while Surtees and a young, unknown Scotsman Jimmy Clark crashed at the start, thus ending their race early. Brabham, much like the previous year, was struck by bad luck in America when his Cooper began to misfire, and The Aussie would have to settle into 4th, while Innes Ireland and Bruce Mclaren completed the top 3.\n\nThe Italian officials watching how Castellotti's Lancia navigates the Monza banking\n\n​\n\nWith Moss finishing 1st, the Briton could switch his focus onto 1961. But, this was all a calm before a massive storm that would occur in 1961, where Grand Prix Racing was heading once again into unknown territory. A downgrade in power, and further tragedy is looming over the horizon. Up next, it's 1961 - \"Collaborazione\".\n\nBrabham outrunning Moss\n\n​\n\n1961\n\n\"Collaborazione\"\n\n​\n\nIt is late 1958, and the CSI (Nowadays FIA) is holding a meeting to demonstrate the new regulations that would be imposed for the 1961 season. To the anger of the British Teams, what they were seeing was a step down from 2.5 to 1.5 liter Engines, and favoritism of teams such as Ferrari and Lancia. It was widely believed that such rule would transform Grand Prix Racing for the worse, and return it back to the days of the early 50s, when it resembled Formula 2. Outraged, a mass exodus of drivers occured just as the 1960 season ended, and the British Teams announced that they would boycott the new regulations by forming the Intercontinental Formula - A competition which would stick to the 2.5l engine regulations, and one which promised to be less Eurocentric compared to Grand Prix Racing. Cooper, BRM, Vanwall and Ferrari all supported the idea, along with drivers like Stirling Moss, Stuart Lewis-Evans and Jean Behra, leaving Lotus to stick to their guns with the nimble Type 18, while more significantly - Lancia was in a limbo. The team which had been Italy's finest for the past 7 years was now running out of money, and they were at a bring of insolvency. Gianni Lancia's pride and joy looked like it was at a brink of disappearing, but on the 11th hour, it was announced that Lancia would merge with Ferrari. The struggling Italian side hadn't seen a win in three years, and they only had a concept design for the '61 regulations by Carlo Chiti. To the shock of everyone, the newly established Lancia-Ferrari was now going to compete for the new season of Grand Prix Racing, while the rest were all up eachothers throats if they should even bother competing. More notably, 1961 would see Porsche officially enter the sport with their 787, an F2 design which was eligible for the new regulations, and would be piloted by Dan Gurney and BRM's former guy Jo Bonnier.\n\nThe Lancia and Ferrari personell working on the D80\n\n​\n\nComing into Monaco, the grid were stunned by the machine that Lancia had introduced. The D80 \"Sharknose\", designed by Vittorio Jano not only looked quick, but had an engine that was well beyond powerful than anything that the British Teams could have. The difference between the Lancia and Climax engines was a staggering 37 BHP. Richie Ginther, Eugenio Castellotti and Wolfgang von Trips all looked comfortable and could be seen confident after qualifying, with the Red cars undoubtably being the class of the field... Yet, for the race, Stirling Moss outran all three of the Lancias through the narrow streets of Monaco. Despite the lack of power, Moss was able to use the light, under-powered nature of the Lotus to his advantage, and he was able to score his greatest win by outfoxing the Sharks, thus shocking everyone who was betting on the Lancias dominating the circuit. Moss could be proud in knowing that he was able to pull off such a feat, and that champagne tasted even sweeter as a result.\n\nStirling Moss navigating the Station Hairpin\n\n​\n\nAnyone who thought that Moss would be able to challenge the Lancias like that in Zandvoort was wrong though. Despite that first race shock, the Italian cars rolled out for their first 1-2 of the season at the Dutch Grand Prix, with Wolfgang von Trips achieving his first ever win, ahead of Eugenio Castellotti. Behind them, a young Scottish farmer under the name of Jimmy Clark was able to finish an impressive third. Belgium saw the entry of young Belgian Lucien Bianchi. The Italian-born Belgian had by 1961 become a prominent name in Sportscar racing by taking the 24H of Le Mans, but had been an obscure driver in Formula 1, only racing for the Private Belgian teams in Holland and Belgium respectively. Now, Lucien was entering for Lancia-Ferrari. With four D80s being fielded at a power-track like the Spa-Francorschamps, the Bordeaux cars dominated the Grand Prix, finishing an unprecedented 1-2-3-4. Such domination wasn't even achieved by the Mercedes team in 1955, and it was very qucikly becoming apparent that if the British teams don't react soon, then these new regulations could see unsustained dominance by the Ferraris, especially when having the expertise of Lancia personell.\n\nThe grid racing towards Eau-Rouge. Castellotti first, Bianchi second\n\n​\n\nWith two consecutive wins, Lancia-Ferrari entered the French Grand Prix head and shoulders above the competition, and their streak would continue when Lucien Bianchi crossed the line by the narrowest margins ahead of Dan Gurney's Porsche. Both the Belgian and the American got to celebrate their first ever podiums, while Lancia-Ferrari's streak of three consecutive wins would stretch out to 4 when in Aintree, Wolf von Trips dominated the procedures. The young German count was enjoying his greatest season by far, and even had the privilege of being the first German to win a Grand Prix since 1954. Eugenio Castellotti on the other hand, was now sitting in second place, with only one win, but plenty of consistency. Richie Ginther was happy enough developing the D80 and helping out the boys in the garage, while Stirling Moss was gritting his teeth knowing that he could be fighting for the championship if the Lotus just had a coherent engine. Such was the state of Grand Prix Racing in 1961 - The Lancias were just untouchable.\n\nBianchi outrunning Gurney to the line in France\n\n​\n\nYet, in Germany, Moss would once again pull off a masterclass and outrun the Bordeaux cars in the Nurburgring, where the nimble nature of the Lotus once again came to its own, and Moss was once again able to beat Castellotti and co. to the line. With that win, Stirling Moss was now holding onto the Championship fight by a thread, chasing Eugenio Castellotti and Wolfgang von Trips, with the latter seemingly having his year of years. Coming into Monza, Wolfgang was sitting pretty with 33 points, followed by Castellotti with 29, and Moss and Ginther with 21. With the circus coming to Monza, a great crowd gathered around to watch the Lancia-Ferraris win the Italian Grand Prix for the second time in a row. Along the four regular drivers, Lancia gave a chance to a young 19 year old Mexican Ricardo Rodriguez, who stunned everyone by qualifying 2nd. The race went ahead, and Castellotti led ahead of Ginther, Rodriguez and the rest of the Lancias. It looked like the race would be a demonstration of the Lancias, in particular with the organisers once again using the much hated Monza 10K layout. Then, as Wolfgang von Trips battled with Jimmy Clark and approached the Parabolica the two cars collided. Clark crashed without injury but the Ferrari went through a spectator fence, went up an embankment on the left and was tossed into a roll, into where spectators were standing. Von Trips was thrown from the car, landed on the track, broke his neck and was killed along with 14 spectators. Despite the horror not seen since the 1955 Le Mans Disaster occuring, the race went on, and Eugenio Castellotti dominated the Italian Grand Prix, thus becoming the first Italian to win the World Championship since Alberto Ascari in 1956. But there was nothing to celebrate here. Grand Prix Racing was once again marred by a tragedy in which innocent lives were taken, in what was supposed to be the season's most spectacular race. 15 lives were lost in one single moment, and in a mark of sportsmanship - Castellotti remarked how he does not deserve this championship, and the moral victor is von Trips. Wolfgang von Trips was only 33.\n\n​\n\nHaving won the Constructors and Drivers' Championships, Lancia-Ferrari wouldn't show up for the American Grand Prix for the second year in succession, leaving the British Teams to race in the new Watkins Glen circuit in New York. There, Innes Ireland would gain the accolades for becoming the first man to win the Grand Prix for the factory Lotus team, since Moss' previous victories were all achieved for the private Rob Walker team. With the American Grand Prix coming to an end, Grand Prix's darkest year could finally end, but without any ceremony. Eugenio Castellotti, shaken by the loss of a great friend, would now have to defend his title, but there were dark clouds on the horizon over the Lancia-Ferrari partnership, with Ferrari's factory losing several personell in what would become the \"Great Walkout\". Richie Ginther was just one of the men to leave the team after Monza, while the sport would see the departure of Tony Brooks, with the Racing Dentist having enough of what he saw as tame regulations that ruined the sport, and his departure was already following the ones by Jean Behra and Stuart Lewis-Evans. Coming into 1962, Grand Prix was now having to start over following the nuclear fallout of the new regulations, while Lancia-Ferrari's partnership was quickly becoming a nightmare. Up next, it's 1962 - \"The British Invasion\".\n\n​\n\n1962\n\n\"The British invasion\"\n\n​\n\nWith 1961 finishing under a dark cloud of Von Trips' demise, Lancia-Ferrari would go through the final three months of the year being stuck in a limbo. For much of the year, Ferraris' staff protested against the company's leadership, with the old man himself running into almost daily schisms with his personnel, whom he would eventually fire. The entire crisis within Ferrari got so bad that eventually, a mass exodus of workers left the company in what was a Great Walkout. All of this drama did not remain within Ferrari though. Lancia, which was mostly running the shared F1 division of the team, was at a constant struggle with the Ferrari division, with several disagreements occurring between Carlo Chiti and Vittorio Jano on where the successful D80 should go. Chiti prefered revolution, fearing that the British Teams would return with stronger machinery for 1962, while Jano was rather complacent and believed that retaining the D80 and simply upgrading it would be enough for the car to dominate the following year, and it would eventually lead to Chiti leaving the company along with 7 other designers, leaving a now aging Jano to continue designing the racing cars along with a couple of young unproven designers. Within the F1 team, having seen the poor management of Von Trips' funeral, Eugenio Castellotti finally had enough of not only Ferrari's poor management, having been used to the close community during his Lancia years, but the Italian champion announced that he would not drive in 1962, thus leaving e massive vacuum inside the team. Also, in reaction to von Trips' fatal crash, the drivers of the sport came together to form the first of its kind - the Grand Prix drivers' club, an association in which the drivers would have a say in the sports' regulations and safety. The clubs' first president would be who else but Stirling Moss.\n\nMeanwhile, with the shock of the news of Chiti's and Castellotti's departure, Lancia-Ferrari would now have to scramble to pick their new #1 driver, all while also landing a deal with Rob Walker's private racing team, as the British businessman wanted to improve the results of his already successful team. Sensationally, RW would manage to have Stirling Moss, their team leader, drive a Ferrari 61P - that very same prototype which Carlo Chiti designed for 1961. Indeed, Lancia and Ferrari would once again race against each other, only with Lancia under Ferrari, and Ferrari under Rob Walker… Wait what?\n\nElsewhere, just as Carlo Chiti predicted, the British Teams would enter the new season of Grand Prix Racing with brand new machinery. Cooper entered their Climax-powered T55 for Bruce Mclaren and Jack Brabham, with the Oceania duo confident in repeating their successes of 1960. Lotus finally let go of their Type 18 in favor of the nimble and quick Type 25, with Jimmy Clark, Afrikaaner Tony Maggs and Trevor Taylor behind the wheel. All three Drivers were young, and both were just hoping to score some decent results, with the Scottish farmer in particular still being harassed by the media for his tangle with Von Trips in Monza the previous year. BRM stuck to the P57 which they used the previous year, only with a BRM V8 Engine behind it instead of the underpowered L4 Climax. Graham Hill was still in the team, now joined by Lancia's former driver Richie Ginther. Porsche remained the same, although the Grand Prix circus did see a new team in the form of Lola, an American racing organization for which young John Surtees would leave Lotus. The British motorcycle champion was hopeful that with Lola, he would manage to score some decent results after an abysmal 1961 with the dark green cars, reportedly even denying Colin Chapman's offer of being his \"Number One Guy\".\n\nThe Ferrari 61P and Lola MK4\n\n​\n\nJust like the previous two years, Monaco would open up the Grand Prix Season, with Jimmy Clark immediately showing the Type 25's pace by putting it on Pole Position. His first pole being on the calendar's most glamorous circuit certainly marks this a special occasion, it's just a shame that Jimmy's race would end with clutch problems, leaving Graham Hill leading the procedures. The mustached gentleman could be seen smiling as he crossed the Gasworks Hairpin, and the BRM sung through the tunnel as a win looked to be on the cards for the British team. Then, black smoke would begin to emerge from Hill's engine, with just 7 laps to go, leaving Bruce Mclaren in first place. Indeed, the Kiwi now just had to navigate the course for 7 more Laps and bring Cooper their first win in two years. But, someone else had different ideas. Behind the wheel of a Dark-blue Ferrari, Stirling Moss began to fill Mclaren's mirrors, and with just two laps to go, Moss made a banzai move to take his 3rd consecutive win in Monaco. The Ferrari 61P's first race ended perfectly, and a smug Stirling watched as Lucien Bianchi's Lancia-Ferrari finished a lonely 3rd.\n\nThe start of the Monaco Grand Prix. Thankfully, nobody was hurt\n\n​\n\nAt Holland, Lola and John Surtees caused a stir when the blue car nabbed a surprise Pole Position, and it looked Like Surtees was on course to take his second ever win, until the gearbox let go. Graham Hill was once again left to lead the race, when Clark's Lotus conked out once again. On the upside, Trevor Taylor was there to give Lotus their first top 3 finish of the year, while Stirling Moss was 2nd, although he was 30 seconds off Graham. Coming into Belgium, Graham Hill and Stirling Moss looked to be the ones who would fight for the world title this year. However, Jim Clark's Lotus Type 25 finally held on for the entire race, and the results were terrifying. Having only qualified 12th; Clark leaped all the way to 3rd at the start, and he stalked Graham Hill for the first half of the race, while also battling with the feisty Willy Mairesse and his sharknosed Lancia-Ferrari, and teammate Trevor Taylor. But, Mairesse's grit, combined with Taylor's inexperienced, resulted in disaster, and the two tangled at the Kemmel straight, launching Willy's lancia into the air and somersaulting across the track and catching fire, with Mairesse still stuck in the car. Miraculously, the Belgian driver was taken out of the burning Lancia unscathed, with some slight burns. At the front, Clark dominated the event to take his first ever Grand Prix win, with Hill second, and Moss Third, although the latter was chased like mad by the 19-year-old Mexican talent Ricardo Rodriguez in his Lancia, who thus became the youngest man to score points in a Formula 1 race.\n\nClark leading ahead of Mclaren, Mairesse and Taylor\n\nAs the teams rounded up for France, the news were that for the first time, after almost 30 years of constant racing, Formula 1 would leave the fast Reims-Gueux road circuit in favor for another road, that being the Rouen. Rouen in itself wasn't that unknown to the drivers. It was a common track in Non-Championship and Formula 2 races, so almost everyone knew what to expect. The other news were that for the first time since 1959, the Lancia-Ferraris would not show up for the French Grand Prix, as the worker strikes in Italy were in full force, thus trapping the Italian team at home, with only Stirling Moss showing up to represent the Italian car. As a championship contender, he was keen to extend the lead if the chances came, and he was also keen on showing the Reds that they should've hired him a decade ago.\n\nGurney's day of days\n\n​\n\nMuch to Moss' delight, both Hill and Clark retired from the race, leaving only Tony Maggs in his Cooper to score his first podium and become the first African to do so, while Dan Gurney gained the accolades of becoming the first American to win a Grand Prix, while also giving Porsche their first win since the Auto Union years. The nimble, underpowered 767 was now a winner, and the 1962 season was now seeing its 4th different winner. Aintree saw Clark dominate the event, with the Scotsman scoring his first Grand Slam. Pole Position, fastest lap, and utter domination of the event was a perfect way for Jim to get himself closer to the Championship leader. Perhaps most astonishingly though, the reigning champions Lancia-Ferrari did not even bother to show up in Britain, but the reason soon showed in the following round.\n\nGermany would see Lancia enter a new car, and it was a complete departure of what had been seen before. The 156 \"Aero\", designed by a young man named Mauro Foghieri, Would Only see limited use during this season, with the team preferring to test the machine. Nonetheless, the initial design saw many onlookers stunned, and almost everyone in the pits were interested in what they were seeing. The small, yet heavy V6 Engine of the Lancia was now fitted on a much more aerodynamically-effective chassis, along with a suspension system that promised better control. Another surprise occurred when Jack Brabham showed up in a blue-and-gold machine, dubbed the BT3 - it was the first machine for the Formula 1 regulations of Grand Prix Racing, and the first such car to be designed by an Aussie, who had recently started his own team.\n\nThe two new cars at the Nurburgring. Brabham BT3 and Ferrari 156\n\n​\n\nAt Nurburgring, Clark would start from pole in what would be a rain-affected race, but the Scotsman showed his inexperience when rather clumsily, he forgot to turn on his Lotus at the start, and thus dropped down to last position. Graham Hill led away in front of John Surtees, while Moss held onto 3rd. Dan Gurney in his Porsche chased Moss like mad, as he wanted to continue his fine form during this season, but the Dark Blue Ferrari showed no room, and whenever he would catch up in the corners, the Ferrari V6 Engine would help Moss run away from the American driver at the main straight. But then, disaster struck - Black smoke began to emerge from Moss' Ferrari, and he would have to retire with an oil leak. Frustratingly, Moss parked the car and told Rob Walker \"It's done\", knowing their Championship hopes were crushed. That was the team's only Ferrari, and Rob Walker would now have to once again rely on the old Lotus chassis that Jo Bonnier had already been using.\n\nGraham Hill outrunning Gurney\n\n​\n\nMeanwhile, Clark flew through the Grand Prix to finish 4th, in what was a sensational drive, only overshadowed by Hill's remarkable win, but it was now looking like Hill could well and truly take the world title if his BRM just held on. Monza would see just that, with the BRMs taking their first ever 1-2 finish courtesy to Richie Ginther finally finishing a race. Mclaren kept Cooper's morale up with his promising 3rd place, but the one thing the Italian crowd was truly watching was the progress the Lancias were making. During the practice sessions, the 156's looked to be as fast as the BRMs and Loti, and Lucien Bianchi himself claimed that it was the best car he had ever driven. Meanwhile, Clark's title hopes further evaporated when his gearbox failed after only 12 laps. Gurney's gearbox did the same magic trick of simply disappearing, while Surtees experienced a coughing engine. But It was a perfect day for Graham Hill and the Owen Racing Organization, as the BRMs 6 years of hard work had seemingly paid off.\n\nJim Clark being chased by Graham Hill\n\n​\n\nFor the United States Grand Prix, held once again at Watkins Glen, Lancia wouldn't show up due to the ongoing Italian strikes, so it was all down to the spectacle between Lotus and BRM. Indeed, the race for the first time saw Clark and Hill duel for the win, and the wait was worth it, as the two men completely crushed the competition. By the time the race was at its end, Clark and Hill had lapped the entire field, and the two constantly exchanged the lead, but Clark would hold his nerve and take his 3rd win of the season, thus closing to Hill's points tally by just 9 points. The season finale in the inaugural South African Grand Prix would see the championship decided, with Clark needing Hill to retire for him to stand any chance in taking the championship.\n\nAnd at first, it looked like things were going perfectly for the Scottish superstar, as Clark led away in the East London circuit, followed only by Hill, who was comfortable enough just staying behind the Lotus and count down the laps. Then, guttingly so, Clark's Engine began to smoke, and Hill would smile as he watched the Lotus pull over. The rest of the race saw Hill dominate the event, with Tony Maags also finishing in the top 3 for his home event, while Brabham's new car showed plenty of promise. And so, the 1962 season was over. Graham Hill had become Britain's 2nd ever champion, and BRM were the Constructors Champions. It was a perfect season for the British team, but many analysts pointed out the superior pace of the Lotus Type 25 and Clark's phenomenal driving. If Lotus could just iron out their flaws, then 1963 could see BRM facing a monumental challenge from the green cars.\n\nThe start of the South African Grand Prix\n\nThe Championship standings\n\n​\n\nStirling Moss, having experienced another disappointing season was now getting desperate, while the Lancia-Ferrari partnership was finally over after only two years. In an agreement between the two divisions, the two would merge to simply represent Ferrari, and the D80 would thus be the final car in Lancia's Grand Prix history. Nevertheless, the Italian team's 8 year tenure in Grand Prix Racing was one of great struggle, tragedy, but also triumph. Names like Alberto Ascari, Eugenio Castellotti, Gigi Villoresi and Peter Collins had all driven for Lancia, and the 17 Wins, two Drivers Championships and one Constructors Championship helped make it the fourth most successful Italian team in the sports' 37 year history. The chapter was now closed, and Ferrari would open a new one. Up next, it's 1963 - \"Clark's Coming of Age\".\n\nGraham Hill with Jim Clark, pictured in Aintree\n\n​\n\n1963\n\n\"Clark's coming of age\"\n\nAfter Hill and BRM's glorious 1962 season, it became clear that the British Teams in general were back on top of the Formula 1 category of Grand Prix Racing. The dark green cars of the Owen Racing Organization were closely followed by the British team Lotus, with themselves being followed by Cooper, and the Coventry Climax engines were already powering almost half the grid with the only exceptions being BRM and Ferrari.\n\nLotus still had Jim Clark and Trevor Taylor, just how BRM had Graham Hill and Richie Ginther. Porsche were out of the sport, citing financial difficulties as their reason for departure, with only Dutch gentleman Carel de Beaufort getting to drive a Porsche Sports car for his private team. Newcomer and Libyan talent Lorenzo Bandini was part of the Venetian-based Centro-Sud team, which had pulled a coup by snatching BRM's P57, while Stirling Moss, having endured another frustrating season with Rob Walker's private racing team, was now heading to Italy. The men who left Ferrari two years ago were working around the clock at producing their new ATS 100, built by Automobili Turismo e Sport. Designed by Carlo Chiti, it was being made as a direct rival to Ferrari, and Moss hoped that it would also be quick, although he would have to wait.\n\nATS staff and their contraption\n\n​\n\nLola, led by Reg Parnell retained young John Surtees, who drove some stunning races the previous year, and for 1963 he was joined by another young and promising driver from Oceania - New Zealand's Chris Amon. At only 20 years of age, he was even younger than Ferrari's young hopeful Ricardo Rodriguez. Speaking of Ferrari - the Reds had a massive shake-up within their management after their hangover in 1962. Vittorio Jano, who designed the title-winning Lancia D80 and all of the now defunct Team's previous cars was put to take care of the sports car division, but not before finishing the new 156. Powered by the Jano V6, which Vittorio designed with young Dino Ferrari, the 156 would be the final open-wheeled car designed by the great Italo-Hungarian designer, and the two Drivers in Ricardo Rodriguez and Willy Mairesse were hopeful it would bring the team back to its winning ways, while Lucien Bianchi was sent to focus on the sports car division along with Eugenio Castellotti and Alberto Ascari.\n\nThe Monaco Grand Prix was once again opening the competition, now even bearing the name of the European Grand Prix, and Lotus' magnificent Type 25 was once again on pole, followed by Graham Hill. After last year's disastrous start, the organizers, pressured by the Grand Prix Drivers club, changed it so the race would begin behind the Gasworks Hairpin. Jim Clark led away, ahead of Hill and Ginther, while Ricardo Rodriguez was in hot pursuit after the British trio of cars. The 156 was already quicker than the previous years' D80, and the fiery Mexican drove like a man possessed. Graham Hill managed to surprise Clark and overtake him, after the Scotsman made a mistake. The Englishman relied on the narrow nature of the Monaco Circuit to stay ahead, but Clark occasionally managed to even get side by side with Hill. Then, Clark went for the inside at Gasworks, and he flew off to the distance. The Lotus Type 25 looked unbeatable through the twisty Monaco Circuit, and Hill looked like he was happy enough taking 2nd. But, with just a few laps to go, Clark had to retire, and now the BRMs were 1st and 2nd, while Rodriguez was beaten out by Bruce Mclaren at the dying laps of the race, after the Ferrari began to misfire. And so, it was a BRM 1-2, followed by another calm and impressive podium by Mclaren. Rodriguez looked to be happy with the Ferrari's performance, but Eugenio Dragoni had different thoughts.\n\nGraham Hill leading ahead of Jimmy Clark\n\n​\n\nComing into Belgium, the unpredictable weather over at Malmedy played its part, and the drivers were awaited by the pouring rain. There were talks if the Grand Prix should take place, but in the end - the deal was set. Graham Hill was 1st, and he started off perfectly, but it was Jim Clark who would make the tomorrow's headlines, as the Scotsman jumped from 8th to 1st while coming into Radillion, and Clark wouldn't look back. In what was a beyond beautiful drive, Jim Clark led every single lap during the appalling conditions, and his Lotus completely left the competition in the dust. To make things even more incredible, Clark's transmission began to break down, and Jim would then resolve to drive one-handed, holding the gear shift in place. When the race was over, everyone could only watch in disbelief. Jim Clark won, and he was 5 minutes ahead of his closest rival in Bruce Mclaren, ahead by an entire lap. A drive this dominant, and this spectacular could've only been replicated by Juan Manuel Fangio, Alberto Ascari, or Stirling Moss in the proper machinery. Clark had proved that he was beyond just a quick driver with great talents - he was a superstar.\n\nClark, all alone, leading in Spa-Francorschamps\n\n​\n\nA quick trip through the northern border saw the Grand Prix circus arrive in the Netherlands, where Clark would once again display his skills. Just like in the Belgian Grand Prix, Jimmy would lap the entire field once again, while Graham Hill's second consecutive retirement put his Championship hopes in sought jeopardy, with Clark now in first place. Meanwhile, Rodriguez became the first Mexican to finish on the top 3 in Grand Prix Racing, along with becoming the youngest Podium-finisher, while Dan Gurney brought Brabham its first top 3 finish. The American was doing a fantastic job in the Australian-built machine, and he was sure that things would only get better.\n\nFurther domination by Clark continued on for the next two races, as the flying Scott left the competition in the dust in both the UK and France. Not even BRM's new and slick P61 vehicle could keep up, although both Hill and Ginther did put up some impressive performances that were quite encouraging. Ricardo Rodriguez also showed some promise with the ever-improving Ferrari, as the Mexican finished on the podium in Silverstone, and he also finished a patient 3rd in Germany. However, someone else captured the headlines in the Nurburgring-Nordschleife, and it was not Clark, nor was it Hill. John Surtees, having only scored one point thus far, was suffering through a frustrating year at Lola, where both him and Chris Amon would exchange whatever info they had about the car. The MK4 was clearly outdone by the competition, and the budget was getting increasingly lighter. However, at the Nurburgring, Surtees drove a sensational race; passing Rodriguez and chasing down Clark who looked like he was due to win his 5th consecutive race. But, it all went horribly wrong for Clark when his gearbox began to hiccup, and Surtees screamed past him at the Dottinger straight. The Englishman went on to win the German Grand Prix, thus lifting the golden trophy for the first time in his career, while also taking Lola's only ever win. Neither Surtees, or Lola would reach those heights for the rest of the season.\n\nSurtees' masterclass in the Nurburgring\n\n​\n\nComing into Monza, Lucien Bianchi would once again return to Ferrari, after previously substituting Willy Mairesse in France. The latter suffered a horrifying crash in the previous Grand Prix, and he was left in critical condition that decisively ended his career. Thus, Bianchi was once again behind the wheel of the 156. Rodriguez looked keen to continue the consistent form that he's enjoyed throughout the season, but his Ferrari would conk out during the Italian Grand Prix, but not without making Clark's life a nightmare for almost the entire race. Indeed, the Red car looked to have finally catched up to the Loti and BRMs, and Rodriguez himself expressed how he'd love to win at his home Grand Prix, seeing how this year would see the inaugural Mexican Grand Prix. But for now, he'd have to wait for a few more months, while Clark won his 5th race of the season, thus Winning the World Championship with three races to go.\n\nRodríguez' hopes of Winning a Grand Prix finally came true in the United States. For the first time since 1959, Ferrari would head out from Europe, and they sent all their best men to do the job, with Ricardo being given all of the attention, and it paid off. The Ferrari stuck like glue to Hill's BRM, and Rodriguez used his best chance at the 60th lap to finally snatch the lead. After that, Ricardo did not look back, and he crossed the line to become Grand Prix's youngest ever winner at just 21 years of age. Ferrari's 2 year drought had finally ended, and Italy had found its new hero in the form of this young, fast Hombre.\n\nRodriguez behind the wheel of the Ferrari\n\n​\n\nAnd so, with Rodriguez Winning his first Race, the 1963 would be capped off with Clark winning the last two Grands Prix, adding up to a remarkable 7 Grand Prix wins in a season.\n\nWith that, the Scottish champion only trailed Tazio Nuvolari for most Wins in a season. Graham Hill only finished a disappointing 2nd in the standings, although he was sure that he should've won more than just one race, while Richie Ginther had his personal best season. But there was no doubt that the star of the season was Jimmy Clark. The champion was simply untouchable, and he showed just how dominant he can be with a reliable Car. With Lotus having a perfect season, only one question remains; could they handle a stronger competition from BRM and Ferrari? That's exactly what we're finding out next season. Up next, it's 1964 - \"All over in Mexico\".\n\nClark driving his manager Colin Chapman around Monza, with a trophy in his hands\n\n​\n\n1964\n\n\"All over in Mexico\"\n\n​\n\nFollowing Clark and Lotus' double triumph in 1963, it had become clear to many that the future of Grand Prix Racing lied in the nimble Monocoque chassis, which had made the Lotus Type 25 so incredibly light. The advantage of having such a nimble chassis that was the crucial part of the cars' design, combined with the relatively light Coventry Climax engine made it so the green cars were all the rage, and everyone else scrambled to come up with their own version of the monocoque. BRM so far looked like they had an appropriate response, with the P61 being powered by a mighty BRM V8, and the Owen Racing Organisation was certain that if they just iron out the P61's flaws, that they can take it up to Lotus. Back in Maranello, Ferrari retained the quick 156 of the previous two years, and Ricardo Rodriguez remained loyal to the scarlet cars along with Lucien Bianchi.\n\nStirling Moss had made headlines when he announced that 1964 would be his final year in Grand Prix Racing. Having departed from the mess that was the ATS team, Mister Motorsport went back to Cooper aftet Tony Maags' departure. He simply hoped to enjoy his last year in F1, and Bruce Mclaren was more than happy to be mentored by the great Stirling. Elsewhere, Chris Amon left the folding Lola Team in favour of the British Racing Partnership, as the privateer team promised a Lotus Type 25 with a BRM engine, and the young Kiwi just hoped that he would have a secure seat for this year, while his former teammate John Surtees left for the land of the rising sun in order to develop the F1 Project led by Honda. Finally, Brabham ditched the bright blue and gold in favour of the dark green and gold of the BT7, and both Dan Gurney and Jack Brabham were confident that their new car would be an instant challenger for race wins. Rob Walker, now with only Jo Bonnier as their driver looked for another promising talent that could drive for them, and that one talent would be Jo \"Seppi\" Siffert. The 28-year old Swiss had already been driving in Formula 2 for a number of years, and his enrty in the RW team was seen as a logical step for his career. Joined by Siffert was also Bob Anderson, who would drive his first races in Formula 1 this year as well.\n\nJo Siffert, the season's most promising debutant\n\n​\n\nAs it had become a tradition by this point, the first race of the season was to be held in Monaco. The sports' most prestigious race was always a magnet for celebrities and TV channels desperate to film the worlds best driving right on the edge. Clark seemed unstoppable, as he led the entire race, but his Coventry engine soon enough but the dust, and Dan Gurney was left to lead until his Brabham called it quits. And so, for the third time in a row, Graham Hill led the procedures to win the Monaco Grand Prix, followed by his teammate Richie Ginther. The BRM 1-2 was a perfect start for the revised P61, and Clark's new teammate Pete Arundell also showed promise by finishing 3rd.\n\n​\n\nNetherlands saw Lotus reply to the BRM win of the previous round, as Jimmy Clark utterly dominated the Grand Prix in Zandvoort. The Flying Scotsman showed that he was still utterly unstoppable when his machinery worked properly, and the only other driver to stay on the same lap as him was Ricardo Rodriguez. This phenomenal form was only stopped when in Spa-Francorschamps, Dan Gurney in his flying Brabham utterly dominated the Belgian and French Grands Prix. Indeed, the Aussie team were finally showing the fruits of their labour. Dan had already challenged for wins in the previous two rounds, but his machinery always let him down. When asked about his race win, Gurney just smiled and said -\"Third time's the charm!\"\n\nHowever, while Gurney was smiling and the championship now had three men fighting for the title, Ricardo Rodriguez and the Ferrari team were in the middle of a crisis. Aside from a 2nd place in Zandvoort, the red cars had only finished once in the last 4 races. But, a reply would surely come in the UK, especially after Ferrari won in Le Mans. With Europe's greatest race finished, the Italian Team would switch its focus towards the Grand Prix Championship. The British Grand Prix would see the race being held for the first time at the thrilling Brands Hatch. The tight and twisty circuit had plenty of elevation changes, and a capacity of over 100 thousand, and the first race proved to be a spectacle, with a British 1-2-3 taking place. Stirling Moss, Graham Hill and Jimmy Clark all shook hands and drank the champagne, while the adoring crowd cheered them on. Another notable first was the new BRM P67. While It looked like the P61 in every aspect, the new machine was equipped with a 4 Wheel Drive system, and for now it would be driven as a testing mule, while the British team was focusing on the championship. While the 4WD P61 was seemingly had a long way to go before becoming a proven concept, the innovation showed that teams were actively looking for any possible way to outrun the competition.\n\nThe 4WD P67 testing machine\n\n​\n\nMeanwhile, a 4th and 6th for Ferrari showed subtle signs of improvement, although Rodriguez was certain that if he was to challenge for a title, it would be in 1966 where the new regulations were planned to take place. Also in the UK, Mike Spence made his debut for Lotus, after poor Arundell suffered a career-ending injury in France. It was a sad end to what was a promising career, and Colin Chapman even promised Pete to give him a drive when he recovers out of respect.\n\nThe race start of the British Grand Prix\n\n​\n\nThe next round in Germany finally saw Honda debut with the RA271. This heavy contraption, powered by an even heavier and thirstier V12 was being tested for a whole year now, first by Ronnie Bucknum, but now also by John Surtees. The English driver had sacrificed an entire season to test the Japanese car, and the team was hopeful that they could make a good impression, although the choice of a circuit as tricky as the Nurburgring was a questionable one. Nonetheless, Surtees made the most of it and he completed a fine drive to finish 6th, scoring a single point for what was Honda's debut in Grand Prix Racing. But the real deal was up in front, with Ricardo Rodriguez taking the win for Ferrari ahead of Hill, and Siffert also showed great promise by finishing 4th for the Rob Walker team. With Rodrigez winning the German Grand Prix, he was now right with Dan Gurney in the Championship standings, but a long way behind Hill and Clark, who were practically in a race of their own. It seems that if their cars just hold on, Hill and Clark will once again outrun the competition. Sadly at Nurburgring, another life faded away when Carel de Beaufort lost control of his private Porsche and careened off the circuit. A Porsche loyalist, Carel was only 30.\n\nSurtees navigating the Nurburgring in his Honda\n\n​\n\nFrom the thrills of the Nurburgring, the Grand Prix circus headed off to Austria, for what would be the sports' only venture in the relatively flat and boring Zeltweg airway. Oh yes, the first Austrian Grand Prix would be held on an airway, and it was a complete mess. The bumpy tarmac made the track a nightmare to navigate, and many cars had their suspensions collapsing, thus opening the doors for the underdogs to earn some easy points. Lorenzo Bandini, still driving for the Centro Sud organisation finished a highly respectable 4th, just behind BRP's Bob Anderson, while Richie Ginther would finally take his first ever Grand Prix Win, ahead of Lucien Bianchi. With Ginther winning, BRM extended its lead over the rest of the constructors, and the Californian driver was overjoyed in winning what would end up being his only Grand Prix win. However, Hill's, Gurney's, Rodriguez's and Clark's retirements meant that the championship fight remained static, and the following round in Monza saw yet another retirement by the top 2 of the championship, leaving Rodriguez and Gurney to battle it out for the victory. The American driver looked like he had everything in the bag, with the Brabham outrunning the Ferraris and Coopers. However, his engine soon began to cough, and Gurney slammed his steering wheel in anger, knowing that his championship hopes were likely gone. Remarkably, the Tifosi would cheer on as the scarlet cars would cross the line 1st and 3rd, thus scoring their first home win since 1961. With Rodriguez triumphant, he was now just two points away from Hill, and tied with Clark. All of a sudden, the championship has been blown wide open with only two races to go.\n\nRodriguez, Gurney, Clark and Mclaren battling for the lead\n\n​\n\nDespite winning the Italian Grand Prix, the climate within Ferrari was anything but pleasant. Enzo Ferrari had surrendered his entrant's license in a dispute at Monza, so the cars were entered by Luigi Chinetti's North American Racing Team and were painted in North American racing blue and white. With Ferrari's American Division being left to fight for the remaining two races, it looked like Rodriguez had it all to do if he wanted to win the World Title. Even then, the Ferrari was more than competitive, and the United States Grand Prix saw a phenomenal duel for the lead between Rodriguez, Clark and Hill. The three exchanged leads several times during the race, but Clark looked like he had finally gotten rid of the gremlins that have been troubling him since the British GP. But, it all soon came crashing down when once again, his Lotus' fuel pump failed. Out of desperation, Clark took over Spence's car and chased after the leading duo, but soon enough the other Type 25 broke down as well. With Hill eventually overtaking Rodriguez to take the win, Clark and Gurney were now mathematically out of the championship, while Siffert showed his talents by finishing 3rd.\n\nAnd so, after 9 grueling races, it has all come down to this. A two-horse battle for the championship in Mexico. BRM vs Ferrari, Ricardo Rodriguez vs Graham Hill. Hill was 5 points ahead of the young Mexican, and the fast hombre said it himself that he needs a miracle to win this battle. Desperate to win, Ferrari brought in Rodriguez's older brother Pedro to drive the third Ferrari, while BRM remained unchanged. With both Clark and Gurney having nothing to lose, the two men just wanted to end their season in style, while Rodriguez needed either to finish 1st and with Hill no better than 5th, or second with Hill not scoring any points. It was a long shot, and Rodriguez would have to hope that his Ferrari holds on for the next 65 laps, and for Hill to run into misfortune. Clark led away, leaving Gurney, the Ferrari duo and Hill in the dust. The race remained largely the same, with Hill making a mad dash to remain second, but Gurney was just too quick, and the Englishman was hounded mercilessly by Bianchi, who wanted to make a splash for what would be his final race with Ferrari. As things stood, Hill would comfortably win the championship, with Rodriguez sitting in 5th, and his Ferrari developing a missfire. With Rodriguez seemingly out of it, Bianchi remained oblivious and continued to sparr with Hill. His 6 cylinder Ferrari remained breathless on the straights, where the BRM V8 excelled, but the Belgian would always catch up in the corners, and Graham grew ever more nervous. Still, with himself in 3rd, everything was going according to plan until -\n\n​\n\nOut of desperation, Lucien Bianchi made a lunge for the inside over at the Tyre hairpin, and his wheels tangled with Hill's. The BRM's front right suspension was ruined, and Graham climbed out of his BRM to shake his fist at Bianchi. With Rodriguez passing the two stricken cars, Bianchi managed to restart his Ferrari, and the two cars remained in formation. Still, with Clark leading, the title was firmly in Hill's hands by only one point. The penultimate lap started, and Clark continued to lead. Then, the unthinkable - His Lotus began to slow down, and his engine blew up just as he crossed the line to start the final lap. Dan Gurney breezed past the stricken Lotus to take the lead, and Rodriguez settled into 2nd. Incredibly, the title had swung towards Rodriguez at the final lap, of the final race. Hill threw his gloves in frustration, and the mad, gesticulating Italians over at the pits waved to Ricardo with a sign that said \"Ricardo - Campeon!\". With Gurney winning the Mexican Grand Prix, Ricardo finished 2nd ahead of his teammate Bianchi, and the Ferrari team began to celebrate their Drivers' Championship. For the first time, a non-European driver had become a champion of the World, and at only 22 years of age, RIcardo had become the youngest to achieve such a feat, in what was one of the most momentous, dramatic Grand Prix finales to ever take place.\n\n​\n\nWith Rodriguez becoming the champ, Hill could only wonder what could've been, had Bianchi not smashed into him, while Clark and Gurney probably breathed a sigh of relief knowing that their frustrating season had finally come to an end. With the last season of the 1.5 liter formula on the horizons, the 1965 Championship would start right on New Years' day, now without Stirling Moss to decorate this phenomenal cast of drivers. Up next, it's 1965 - \"The untouchable\"\n\n1965\n\n\"The Untouchable\"\n\n​\n\n1965. The Beatles have reached their peak via the Hollywood Bowl concert in the USA, and the British Invasion was in full effect with bands like The Who, The Yardbirds and Eric Burdon's Animals. Eve of Destruction, a song that criticises the Vietnam War was on the top of the charts, and Bob Dylan stunned America by going electric as he sung \"Maggie's Farm\". Ford made a direct competitor to Ferrari's domination in Le Mans with the GT40, and Aston Martin made James Bond's favourite car - the DB6.\n\nIn Grand Prix Racing; Ricardo Rodriguez had become North America's and Mexico's first ever champ, having won the 1964 season in dramatic circumstances following Bianchi's ram on Graham Hill. However, Jim Clark was undoubtably the most impressive driver of the year, and there was just the question of how far he could've gone, had his Lotus held together in 1964. 1965 would prove to give the answer...\n\nUnlike the previous few years, the 1965 season would not start in Monaco. Rather, it started in South Africa following a dispute over when the race should take place. The original plan was for it to take place after Mexico in 1964, but soon enough the decision fell in favour of it opening the new year. Literally. The 1st Grand Prix of the 1965 season would take place on the 1st of January, and Jimmy Clark celebrated Hogmanay by dominating the race. The entire Grand Prix had a festive, almost holiday-esque feeling to it. Rodriguez was now joined by Lorenzo Bandini in Ferrari, with the Lybian Italian leaving the Centro Sud squad in favour of the red cars, while a young and beady-eyed Jackie Stewart finished 6th in his first race for BRM. Dennis Hulme was promoted from mechanic to driver for the Australian Brabham team, however the focus was strictly on Dan Gurney, who hoped that this would finally be his year after the frustrations of 1964. With Stirling Moss retiring, the seat at Cooper was filled by a young and promising Austrian Jochen Rindt. Clark's triumph marked the end of East London's tenure as a GP Venue though, as the South African organizers would take a year to build a new and modern track over in Kyalami. Clark would not show up in Monaco though. The Scotsman, along with his teammate Mike Spence and the Lotus team headed across the pond to Indiana, where Clark would demonstrate his prowess in the prestigious Indianapolis 500. Clark won that race, with the monstrous and revolutionary Type 38.\n\nThe Lotus team posing with the Type 38 in Indianapolis\n\nIn Monaco though, Graham Hill drove what would end up being the Englishman's finest Grand Prix. After spinning out of the lead, along with his teammate Stewart, Hill charged through the field. The tight streets of Monaco suited Graham like a glove, and his BRM flew past the opposition until finally, he reached the leading Lorenzo Bandini. Bandini, in only his 2nd race for Ferrari drove brilliantly, resisting any attempt from Hill throughout the fight for 1st position. But, it is experience that counts in Monaco. Not the grit. Graham Hill passed Lorenzo and Mirabeau, and he never looked back. It was Graham's finest hour, and his win earned him the name of \"Mister Monaco\".\n\nGraham Hill's finest hour over at the harbour\n\nFollowing Clark's absence in Monaco, Jimmy was back in Belgium, and he was back with a vengeance. At Spa-Francorschamps, feared by all of the drivers, and amidst torrential rain - Clark drove another one of his characteristically dominant races that left everyone in the dust. His Lotus was so ridiculously fast that with 6 laps to go, he was 80 seconds ahead of 2nd placed Bruce Mclaren. Five consecutive wins would follow, with each performance more dominant than the other. In France, Clark and Jackie Stewart completed the first ever Scottish 1-2, with Jackie improving from race to race. However, there was no denying that Clark was the star. In Silverstone - Clark led the entire race and was on course for another Grand Slam, only for his oil pressure to act up with just 16 laps to go. In desperation, Clark would turn the engine off through every corner of the fast and twisty Silverstone circuit, with Graham Hill rapidly closing in. Still, Clark managed to win, when Hill's gearbox began to break. Aside from Graham, who was desperately trying to catch up to the blindingly fast Lotus, and Ricardo Rodriguez, woh's Ferrari was nowhere near as fast as the previous year; There was also John Surtees with the Honda squad. Despite fielding the most powerful engine, the RA272 was simply too heavy when compared to the BRMs, Loti and Coopers of the sport, and it looked like Surtees would have to wait another year to challenge for the championship with the Japanese team.\n\nStewart the apprentice ahead of Clark the master\n\nTwo more wins occured in Holland and Germany, with Clark taking his 4th Grand Slam in the Nurburgring. With his domination of the German Grand Prix, Clark was now head and shoulders ahead of his nearest rival, and the Scotsman was awarded the World Title with three races to go. It was one of the most dominant runs in Grand Prix history, and it marked what was by then Clark's 2nd ever championship. After that, BRM would take two more wins, although not without having to fight against Lotus. Indeed, In all of the remaining races, Jimmy was still a concurrent for wins, but reliability was not on his side. Hill took two consecutive wins, while Dan Gurney brought some much needed points to Brabham with his five consecutive podium finishes. Rodriguez, while taking three top 3 finishes was nowhere near the leading four of the championship, and he would end up completing a rather underwhelming Championship defense. Finally in Mexico, Surtees would bring Honda to its first ever Grand Prix Victory, thus making them the first Asian team to win a Grand Prix, along with the Englishman only achieving his 2nd ever win after two years of poor results.\n\nSurtees driving through la Peraltada\n\nDriver's championship standings\n\nConstructors Championship\n\n​\n\nClark's unsustained domination of the 1965 season remains as one of the greatest performances in F1 history. The Scotsman was untouchable from start to finish, and only misfortune prevented him from having a 100% record in winning every race he had finished. However, the 1966 season marks a new era in Grand Prix History. The years of 1.5 liter engines were over, and F1 was returning to power with a 3.0 liter Formula. With this, the Grand Prix circus heads into the unknown once again, after the previous regulations proved to be a rather exciting period. During this 4 year period - we had experienced Lancia's last hoorah; the retirement of motorsports' most dominant driver; an emergence of a great rivalry, America's first champ; one of the sports' most exciting championship fights since 1959, and a truly untouchable year by the sports' most talented driver. Now, it was all over, and the 1966 season sees the start of a new era - \"Black Jack's Ace\"\n\n​\n\nThe post-war era saw Grand Prix Racing stagnate following the Golden Age of the 30s and the Second World War. The first 7 years of the sport's revival saw inconsistent rules, Constructors pulling out due to financial difficulties and usage of pre-war machinery. However, the generation of Drivers that emerged during this period are no slouch, with the young talents of the 30s continuing their careers as hardened veterans, accompanied by former fighter pilots who were out there for the thrill of it and young, promising talents that would soon enough become the decade's heroes. But out of those groups, only a select number of Drivers remain as the best of the era. Here is a list of some of the best. Mind you, this list ranges from the 1947 season all the way to the retirement of Sir Stirling Moss in 1964, who was the last driver to have driven in more than half of the 50s.\n\nBefore we start though, here are some of the honorable mentions:\n\nLuigi Musso\n\nWins: 2\n\nPodiums: 7\n\nA gambling man at heart, Luigi Musso was probably the most spectacular driver during his heyday, with the Italian always battling it out with Mike Hawthorn and Peter Collins, while also being a loyal man to Lancia. While he did win a shared race with Alberto, Musso's day of days came in 1957 when he won ahead of Jean Behra in Reims. That ended up being his finest season, and just a year later, he would die on the very track he won, while being in large debts due to his gambling addiction.\n\nJean Behra\n\nWins: 1\n\nPodiums: 13\n\nThe 1980s had Andrea de Cesaris, the 1950s had Jean Behra. The Frenchman was so crash prone that a good part of his body was made of prosthetics, and Jean himself usually ended his races with some death-defying crash that would’ve probably killed someone else. Even then, Jean remained a spectacular driver to watch during his career from 1951 to 1960, and he famously won Maserati’s final race in Morocco 1957, thus earning his only win, but he should’ve won more races, had he just stayed on the road a bit more.\n\nMaurice Trintignant\n\nWins: 2\n\nPodiums: 9\n\nA gentleman racer to the very end, Maurice was one of the safest men that a team could afford during the 50s, and he was almost always guaranteed to finish a race when his machinery stayed together. Although his two wins don’t seem like much, Maurice did help out Ferrari stay competitive and develop the Tipo 801 for the 1956 season, along with helping Cooper win their first championship in 1959 along with Jack Brabham, who we will talk about in the future. Some may consider him boring, but Trintignant remains as one of France’s greatest drivers who proudly waved the blue, white and red during his 9 year tenure in Grand Prix Racing.\n\nCarlo Felice Trossi\n\nWins: 2\n\nPodiums: 4\n\nAn Alfa loyalist, Carlo Trossi was unfortunate enough to start his Grand Prix career right when WW2 was starting, and he continued his career as a hardened veteran, winning two GPs in the process, including the inaugural postwar Italian Grand Prix. Unfortunately, Carlo would peris in 1949, when a brain tumor took his life.\n\nPeter Collins\n\nWins: 2\n\nPodiums: 8\n\nThe youngest driver on the list - Peter Collins holds a unique place in the history books of Motorsport as one of the first truly modern drivers that started from the lower leagues of racing and made his way up to the top, where he eventually became Ferrari’s brightest prospect. In his debut season for the red cars, Collins established himself as a title contender while supporting his mentor Juan Manuel Fangio, and that relationship culminated with the final race of the season, when Collins gave his car to Fangio in order to win the championship. Even though Ascari and Lancia ended up winning the championship that year, Collins’s gesture moved Fangio to tears, and he famously told the British press “I’m young. I will win the Championship someday.” Unfortunately, that would never become the case, and Collins left Ferrari in favor of Lancia for 1958, where he lost his life in the German Grand Prix. Collins was only 26.\n\nWithout further ado, here is number 10.\n\nNumber 10​\n\nJean-Pierre Wimille\n\nWins: 4\n\nPodiums: 6\n\nChampionships: 1\n\nPole Positions: 6\n\nWe open the list with France’s first ever champ in Jean-Pierre Wimille. Before the war, Jean-Pierre Wimille was a prominent French race car driver that dragged Bugatti during the late 30s, and later joined the French resistance of the Second World War. After the war, Jean joined Alfa Romeo and quickly became the Grand Prix scene’s finest driver, dominating the 1948 season to win his first ever championship, and he looked set to follow up on that season by winning it all in 1949. Unfortunately, Wimille would lose his life in the Grand Prix of Buenos Aires of 1949, when he lost control of his Gordini.\n\nNumber 9​\n\nLuigi Villoresi\n\nWins: 3\n\nPodiums: 16\n\nChampionships: 1\n\nPole Positions: 5\n\nLuigi Villoresi, otherwise known as Gigi, is like Alberto Ascari. Actually, he is the mentor of Alberto Ascari. Luigi started his career in 1938, just a year before WW2, but that did not stop him from becoming one of the greats of the postwar era. While driving for Maserati, Luigi battled Jean-Pierre Wimille for the championship in 1948 and Emmanuel de Graffenried in 1949, where he prevailed by only two points. After that, Gigi went on to guide Alberto Ascari and become his closest friend, with whom he drove until his eventual retirement in 1958. While his career is overshadowed by his friend Alberto, Luigi Villoresi remains as the first man to have won a championship for Maserati since 1933.\n\nNumber 8​\n\nTony Brooks\n\nWins: 4\n\nPodiums: 10\n\nPole Positions: 3\n\nThe Racing Dentist - Tony Brooks was a relatively young driver back then, but proved to be the hardest racer. He spent his entire career, aside from a tenure in BRM, over at Vanwall, and managed to give them four wins during his stay with Tony Vanderwell’s team. Brooks’ finest example of how bad fast he was is probably the 1959 United States Grand Prix, where after a 1st lap accident he limped to the pits, only to charge from being a lap down all the way to second place. Had he won that race, and Brabham wasn’t a classified finisher - Brooks would’ve won the championship that year and would’ve given Vanwall its’ second championship, but that 1959 campaign would end up being Brooks’ best year, and he would never challenge for a title like that ever again. Tony ended up retiring in 1961 when the new regulations were introduced, and he ended up being a part of the mass exodus of drivers that left Grand Prix Racing that year. Had he stayed, he would’ve likely driven for BRM in 1962 and would’ve even more likely won the Championship that year.\n\nNumber 7​\n\nMike Hawthorn\n\nWins: 3\n\nPodiums: 18\n\nChampionships: 1\n\nPole Positions: 5\n\nHolding the title as the first British driver to win a Grand Prix Championship, Mike Hawthorn’s career is marred by tragedy, friendship and loyalty, in particular to Ferrari for whom he raced for almost the entirety of his career. Mike started racing as a privateer in the 1952 Grand Prix season, where the sport used Formula 2 regulations, but he quickly landed a drive with Ferrari and subsequently won the Race of the Century, where he battled Gonzalez, Ascari, and Fangio to win his maiden Grand Prix. Mike didn’t stop there, and he remained a fantastic and consistent driver throughout his career. Fittingly, Hawthorn won his only championship by being the more consistent driver than his rivals Stirling Moss and Eugenio Castellotti in 1958, where his Ferrari 412 only broke down twice, and he went on to score 7 podiums and one win, which was enough to win the title by one point ahead of Stirling Moss, who won 40% of that season’s races. Outside of GP, Mike wrote a children’s book about racing and aspired to be a writer, before his life was tragically cut short in 1959 in a car accident, when he was already suffering from kidney failure. He was only 29.\n\nNumber 6​\n\nJose Froilan Gonzalez\n\nWins: 2\n\nPodiums: 15\n\nPole Positions: 4\n\nComing into number 6 is probably Argentina’s cursed clone of Juan Manuel Fangio - Jose Froilan Gonzalez. All joking aside, The Pampas Bull was an incredibly fast individual that dragged Ferrari along with Alberto Ascari during the early 50s, and he would’ve likely won several championships if he raced full time. Yes, despite achieving 15 podiums and 4 pole positions - Jose only raced part time in the Grand Prix championships, and his most successful season remains the 1954 season, where he did not bother to show up for the final Grand Prix of the season, thus gifting his compatriot Fangio the championship. Odd decisions aside, Jose remains as Argentina’s second most successful driver as of the 60s, and joins his friends Fangio and Oscar Galvez as the greats of the era.\n\nNumber 5​\n\nGiuseppe Farina\n\nWins: 6\n\nPodiums: 22\n\nChampionships: 1\n\nPole Positions: 8\n\nStarting the final top 5 - it’s Italy’s very own Giuseppe “Nino” Farina. A Torino native - Giuseppe was a staunch Alfa Romeo Loyalist that drove for the red cars for almost his entire career, starting from 1935 onwards. Had the war never happened, Nino would’ve likely grown up to be one of the sports’ greatest, but even then, he is definitely one of Italy’s finest. From 1948 to 1951, he won for Alfa Romeo five times, delivering a dazzling Monaco win in 1948, and a phenomenal last win in Nurburgring in 1953. Following an injury in 1954, Nino would race part time from then on, yet still performed beautifully in 1955, when Ferrari were struggling against the vastly superior Lancias and Mercs of that year.\n\nNumber 4 ​\n\nEugenio Castellotti\n\nWins: 8\n\nPodiums: 20\n\nChampionships: 1\n\nPole Positions: 8\n\nEugenio Castellotti, also known as “Il Bello”, was quite a celebrity in Italy thanks to his relationship with actress Delia Scala, but there was more to this man than just his looks. I mean come on, just look at that chin. Eugenio, much like the following man on the list - was a brilliant Motorsports driver that won almost everything there is to win, from the Mille Miglia to the 1000km of Buenos Aires, to two Le Mans wins with Ferrari and Lancia. Speaking of Ferrari and Lancia; Eugenio was loyal to both manufacturers for the entirety of his career, being mentored by Alberto Ascari and Luigi Villoresi in the process, thus developing his elegant style of driving. Still, Eugenio had terrible luck in Grand Prix Racing, and if he wasn’t fighting for wins, he was likely watching the race from the sidelines due to his Lancia or Ferrari exploding. Nonetheless, Il Bello had his day of days when he finally won the F1 Championship in 1961, however that achievement was overshadowed by Wolfgang von Trips’ death, including the spectators that were hit by the unfortunate German. Appalled by the handling of von Trips’ funeral, Eugenio retired from racing to focus on his relationship with Delia Scala, with whom he spent his life until their passing in the beginning of the 21st century.\n\nNumber 3​\n\nStirling Moss\n\nWins: 16\n\nPodiums: 27\n\nPole Positions: 16\n\nKnown as Mr. Motorsport - Stirling Moss is without a doubt the greatest man to never win a Grand Prix Championship. From 1952 to 1964 - Moss has been a consistent British loyalist with only a few ventures into Maserati and ATS. Other than that, Moss was a journeyman that drove for Vanwall, Cooper, BRP, BRM, Lotus, Ferrari and Mercedes over a span of 12 years. That means that every year, Moss was likely to switch to a different team and somehow drag them to being championship contenders, only for his horrendous luck to strike and for him to miss out by a few points. Moss contested 1955, 1956, 1958, 1959, Technically 1961 and 1962, and won a race in 8 of his 12 years as a Grand Prix racer, accumulating a total number of 16 wins, which was a staggering amount by then. Outside the cockpit, Stirling was a gentleman that was kind to his rivals on track, while still being a fantastic competitor, and he holds the number of most Race Wins in history of motorsport, with it being 212. Among those wins are the 1955 Mille Miglia, 1957 Coppa Ciano, Two Eiffelrennen/German Grands Prix, four Monaco Grands Prix, The 1965 Le Mans, 1954 Sebring 12H and the 1955 Reims 12 hour race. Sir Stirling may not be the greatest Grand Prix driver of all time, but he is surely The greatest racing driver of all time.\n\nNumber 2​\n\nAlberto Ascari\n\nWins: 21\n\nPodiums: 34\n\nChampionships: 4\n\nPole Positions: 23\n\nComing into 2nd spot (But by the slimmest margins), it’s Il Ciccio himself - Alberto Ascari. Alberto Ascari started his racing career in 1948 for Maserati, following the footsteps of his dear friend and mentor Luigi Villoresi, whom he learned from for the first few years and always following wherever he went. This incredible bond would last from the end of the war all the way to the point where both drivers didn’t even race in Grand Prix Racing anymore and just focused on Sportscar racing. Anyway, Alberto quickly established himself as the star of today when he dominated 1952 and 1953, winning an unprecedented 6 consecutive races in 1952. Following a dispute with Ferrari though, Ascari joined the new Lancia team and after three tumultuous years dragged the Bordeaux cars to a championship triumph in 1956, after a tactical masterclass where he used pitstops to his advantage to hunt down Stirling Moss. Even after that, Ascari made sure to mentor his younger Italian colleagues, with Eugenio Castellotti ending up being Italy’s champ only five years after Ascari’s last championship. On the track, Ascari was unstoppable when leading, and as quoted by Enzo Ferrari himself - “Impossible to pass”; along with being one of the sports’ first Ring-Meisters by winning in the Nurburgring three consecutive times. Alberto Ascari - Italy’s finest.\n\nNumber 1​\n\nJuan Manuel Fangio\n\nWins: 21\n\nPodiums: 35\n\nChampionships: 4\n\nPole Positions: 23\n\nBy virtue of one podium, it is El Maestro who takes the top spot. Yes, it is that close between Fangio and Ascari. Juan Manuel Fangio might've started his Grand Prix Career in his mid 30s, but Giuseppe Farina and Achille Varzi both saw great potential in the Argentine, and he did not disappoint. In his debut season with Maserati, Fangio already won several races before transferring to Alfa Romeo to join the Triple F squad, and he was only a point away from winning the championship in 1950. Nonetheless, he would win it a year later and in the mid 50s established himself as the best of the best when driving with Maserati and Mercedes, winning two consecutive titles and one more in 1957. While Ascari was unstoppable when leading a race, Fangio was a hard charger with racing intelligence like no other. He knew how to chase his opponent and keep him on the edge, or in other occasions charge towards the lead and do an audacious pass on the grass, and nowhere else is that shown better than in Nurburgring 1957, where Juan ate up a minute deficit to overtake the Ferrari duo of Mike Hawthorn and Peter Collins. When asked who his greatest rival was though, Fangio did not think for a single moment, and he happily claimed that Alberto Ascari was always his greatest competitor, and the feeling was mutual. With 35 podiums; 21 wins; 23 pole positions and four championships - Juan Manuel Fangio is the undisputed master of Grand Prix Racing’s postwar era, and still is to this day.\n\n1966\n\n\"Black Jack's Ace\"\n\n​\n\nJim Clark's dominant campaign in 1965 signalled an end to what was a fun era of Grand Prix Racing. For the past 5 seasons, we have watched sensational and close racing take place all over the world, where new kings were crowned and new teams emerged. Lancia-Ferrari's early domination was quickly replaced by a phenomenal rivalry between two gentlemen in Jim Clark and Graham Hill, followed closely by the sensation from North America in Ricardo Rodriguez. Honda became Asia's first representative in GP Racing, inspired by John Surtees who helped the Japanese manufacturer develop into a sleeping giant, while Jack Brabham had by now established his Aussie team as potential champs thanks to the heroics of Dan Gurney. BRM were likely looking back at the early 60s with fondness, having won two constructors and one drivers' championship, but there was certainly some frustration knowing that they would've easily won the 1965 Constructors Championship had it not been for the \"Best 6 results\" rule. Now though, this era had come to an end, and 1966 would see a significant change within the Grand Prix sphere. The 1.5 litre Formula was now doubled into 3.0 litre monsters, and the teams were given plenty of time to prepare.\n\nThe South African Grand Prix was scheduled to take place, but only as a non-championship race, and the Monaco Grand Prix would once again open the season, this time on the 22nd of May. By the time the Grand Prix Circus had come to the Principality, the onlookers were collectively stunned by the sound and the cars. While some held on to the \"Old faithfuls\" like BRM and Lotus, Brabham entered the BT19 - a development of the blindingly fast but unreliable BT11, powered by the Aussie-built Repco engine, a V8 beast that possessed plenty of power. Jack Brabham had already spent months testing the car and using it in the Pre-season races, and his teammate Dennis Hulme joined him in the BT20, a sister car that would handle the V8 Coventry Climax engine as an alternative for the first few races. Ferrari also showed their response to the new regulations. The Maranello outfit had entered a beautiful and deaffening Tipo 312, a V12-powered beast that was surprisingly going to be driven by Lore"
