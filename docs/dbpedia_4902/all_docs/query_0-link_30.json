        "text": "Back in 1996 I stood with John Surtees above the Albert Park pits in Melbourne, watching the Australian Grand Prix, freshly relocated from Adelaide. We were gawping up at a big TV screen on which we had just seen Martin Brundle’s Jordan barrel-roll, landing in a heap of tangled scrap before Martin was winkled out from underneath, chirpily waved to the crowd to prove to onlooking officialdom that he was absolutely okay (I doubt he was) and then jogged back to the pits to take a somewhat jangled restart in a spare car.\n\n“Now what do you think that tells us about Formula 1?” John asked cryptically, as so often he would. I knew him well enough to appreciate that whatever possible response I could give would never be right. I always suspected that he would frame questions to catch one out, whatever the reply. He wasn’t seeking an opinion, he really felt the need to declare his own. So I rather disappointed him by just saying “I really haven’t a clue, John, you tell me…” He narrowed his eyes and clearly suspected I was winding him up, but – after the briefest pause to consider that possibility, which he evidently dismissed – he, with index finger raised, then declared his case with the total self-belief of an Old Testament prophet.\n\nIt was to do with clueless, past-it has-beens, bed-blocking younger talent by hanging on to Formula 1 drives way past their sell-by dates. “We’ve just got to encourage fresh talent,” he said. “These days too many drivers have been in F1 just too long. You’ve got to realise when enough’s enough, you’ve had your chance, move over and move out.”\n\nI guess he was thinking back to his own retirement from racing, at what in many ways had become his spiritual home, the Monza Autodromo, in 1972. He more or less conducted a race-test there of his latest Surtees-Cosworth TS14, while lead driver ‘Mike the Bike’ Hailwood in the works Surtees TS9B took second place behind Emerson Fittipaldi’s winning Lotus 72. Fittipaldi clinched his first world championship title that day, but it was telling how all weekend the milling Monza tifosi had packed around the Surtees paddock area almost as much as around Ferrari’s since they perceived the two multiple motorcycling world champions – Surtees and Hailwood – as the second-best sight on offer.\n\nIn these pages Jenks then reported: “As darkness settled upon the paddock two brand-new and shiny Gilera motorcycles zoomed off into the gloom, ridden by two ex-world champion motorcyclists. It was John and Mike returning to their hotel in Arcore, the home of Gilera, and the sight warmed the hearts of a great many Italians, for the ex-MV Agusta riders are both still remembered with great affection in Italy.” That was an affection John certainly always returned.\n\nAstride works MV-Agustas, John won four 500cc world championship titles, 1956-58-59-60 and in those latter seasons added three 350cc world crowns. He won five times at Monza, then Mike Hailwood six times more, 1961-66. This duo accumulated 16 motorcycle world titles but only John made the perfect four-wheeled transition to win not only the F1 title but also two more Italian GPs at Monza. Guess his business office address in Edenbridge? ‘Monza House’."
