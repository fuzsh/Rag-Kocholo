        "text": "This is a draft of a paper I will be presenting at a future conference. Any thoughts, criticisms, or suggested revisions are welcome. Thank you!\n\nFor three years, between 1955 and 1957, Venezuela hosted in Caracas, grand prix racing for sports cars. The last of them was valid for the World Sportscar Championship and marked the final race of the Maserati with sports cars. With motorsport legends victories such as Juan Manuel Fangio and Stirling Moss, Venezuela was the seat of an important chapter in sports history with famous cars contending your runs. The objective of this research paper is to systematize this sports chapter in a historical reference soon to start building a more complete memory of the history of Latin American auto racing."
