He was the only child of Alexander Davison and Bessie Nolan. [1] He attended Xavier College, Kew, Victoria; being appoined vice-captain in his final year, 1941.\n\nLex Davison is a Military Veteran.\n\nServed in the Commonwealth Militia Force 1941-1942\n\nHe was 'called-up' for militia service later that year, however, was released in August 1942 to assist his father in running the family business, Paragon Shoes Pty Ltd, a major supplier to the Australian Army. Following his father's death in 1945, Lex assumed control of the business and inherited his father's collection of fine automobiles.\n\nLex married Diana Crick, a dental nurse who became one of Australia's pioneer female motor racing drivers, on 2nd October 1946 in St Peter's Roman Catholic Church, Toorak, Victoria. [2] Theirs became a multi-generational racing family, with sons Jon Davison and Richard Davison, and grandsons James Davison, Alex Davison and Will Davison following in their footsteps. The couple had seven children:\n\nAnthony Alexander Davison (1947-), married Karen Folletta\n\nJonathan 'Jon' Deakin Davison (1948-), not only raced cars, but took over as Sandown track promotor in 1990; married Julie Gillam, children include James\n\nPeter Warne Davison (1949-)\n\nChristopher Robert Owen Davison (1951-), married Janet Boyd\n\nDiana Elizabeth Davison (1952-), married John Bynon\n\nRichard Gilbert Davison (1954-), married Penelope Winch, children include Alex and Will\n\nKatherine Felicity Davison (1958-), was reportedly born at Sandown Park Racing Circuit\n\nBusiness\n\nDuring the 1950s, Lex's business interests prospered and included Monte Carlo Motors (a General Motors Holden dealership), Killara Park (an Aberdeen Angus stud and dairy at Lilydale), as well as Paragon Shoes and an associated tannery. The profits enabled him to pursue a busy racing programme throughout Australia and overseas, using some of the best equipment available ...\n\nMotor racing\n\nLex won the Australian Hillclimb Championship three consecutive years, in 1955 to 1957. He then entered in the Australian Drivers Championship, winning the inaugural series in 1957. Whilst not winning the title again, he did exceptionally well finishing 5th (1958), 4th (1960), 2nd (1961), 6th (1962), 4th (1963) and 2nd (1964). Lex won the Australian Grand Prix, now a round of the Formula 1 World Championship, four times, in 1954 (Southport, Queensland), 1957 (Caversham, Western Australia), 1958 (Bathurst, New South Wales) and 1961 (Mallala, South Australia). He finished second in 1960. He drove Cooper (1955-57, 1961-64), Ferrari (1957-59), Aston Martin (1960-61) and Brabham (1964-65) grand prix cars.\n\nIn November 1960, together with co-driver Doug Whiteford, Lex won Class A (for cars with an engine capacity of 750cc or less) in the inaugural Armstrong 500, held at Victoria's Phillip Island Grand Prix Circuit, fore-runner to today's spectacular Bathurst 1000. They drove a NSU Prinz (a car produced in West Germany by the NSU Motorenwerke AG from 1958 to 1973).\n\nTogether with fellow Victorian racing driver, Bib Stillwell, Lex competed in the 1961 24 Hours of Le Mans in an Aston Martin DB4GT Zagato. The invitation by the Essex Racing Stable was due to their involvement with Aston Martins in the Australian racing scene. Unfortunately their Le Mans adventure ended prematurely when a blown head gasket resulted in retirement on lap 25.\n\nIn 1961 Lex returned to England, winning the Aintree Grand Prix and finishing third in the British Empire Trophy.\n\nLex and Diana assisted Donald Campbell in his land-speed record attempt in Bluebird in 1964 at Lake Eyre, South Australia.\n\nPhilanthropy\n\nLex was noted by friends and peers as generous, cheerful and friendly—totally unspoiled by money and fame. Competent on the clarinet, he also showed a keen interest in spearfishing and water-skiing. He was a founder of the Victorian division of the Vintage Sports Car Club of Australia, president (1956-59) of the Light Car Club of Australia, a member of the Melbourne Swimming Club and a the founding council member of the Museum of Modern Art, Melbourne.\n\nDeath\n\nOn 20th February 1965 Lex died in a crash in his 2.5 litre Brabham Climax during practice for the 1965 International 100 at Sandown International Raceway, Springvale, Victoria. He is buried in the Box Hill Cemetery, Victoria. [3] It is uncertain whether the crash was caused by a heart attack or the attack followed the crash. He was pronounced dead, with severe head injuries, by the attending medical team. He was survived by his wife and their five sons and two daughters.\n\nLegacy\n\nDrivers who win the Australian Grand Prix, now a round of the Formula 1 World Championship are awarded the Lex Davison Trophy, so named to honour the four-time winner of the event. The only other four-time winner is seven-time World Champion Michael Schumacher.\n\nLex was inducted into the Australian Motor Sport Hall of Fame in 2017.\n\nSources\n\n↑ Victoria Birth Index #/1923\n\n↑ Victoria Marriage Index #19479/1946\n\n↑ Victoria Death Index #18422/1965\n\nSee also\n\nBlanden, John B.
