        "text": "The 1957 season was Juan Manuel Fangio’s swan song. With four World Championship victories under his belt, Fangio rejoined the Officine Alfieri Maserati team to drive the 250F in his final season of Grand Prix racing. Having already won the season opening race in Argentina, Fangio and the Formula One circus moved on to Monte Carlo for the Monaco Grand Prix.\n\nAt the start, Fangio and Moss, in a Vanwall, shot into the Gasometer bend, side-by-side, with the Ferrari of Peter Collins in hot pursuit. Within a handful of laps, Moss got around “The Maestro,” with Collins to soon follow suit. However, on the fourth lap, Moss overcooked it going into the chicane resulting in him, and the closely following Collins, collecting the barrier and retiring. This allowed the ever-smooth Fangio to retake the lead which he controlled for the balance of the race—this despite losing the use of second gear on the 85th lap!\n\nFangio not only won the 1957 Monaco Grand Prix, but also went on to win the French and German races, clinching his fifth, and final World Championship. This drawing, by artist Alberto Ponno, was commissioned by Maserati S.p.A. for a series of limited edition postcards.\n\nFor commissions, fine art reproductions, or automotive designs, please contact:"
