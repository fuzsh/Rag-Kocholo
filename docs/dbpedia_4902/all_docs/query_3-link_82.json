        "text": "McLaren’s Lewis Hamilton will start the first Grand Prix of the season in Melbourne in pole position, with teammate and compatriot Jenson Button right behind him on the grid.\n\nAfter impressing during testing on Thursday, both McLaren cars showed good pace despite the damp conditions. Button actually topped Hamilton with a best time of 1:27.805 seconds yesterday, but in the final qualifying sessions he couldn’t stay with his teammate’s pace, eventually losing out on pole by a mere tenth of a second.\n\n“It’s a fantastic feeling to be back here,” Hamilton said of his 20th career pole. “It was a tremendous job from the team to get us to this point. We’ve had a couple of tough years, but we never seem to give up.”\n\nIt was, though, a disappointing session for World Champion Sebastian Vettel, whose Red Bull could only manage 6th place, just behind the other Red Bull of Mark Webber and fully seven tenths of a second behind Hamilton. It was even worse for Ferrari, with Fernando Alonso hitting the sand in Q2 as he limped to 12th place on the grid. Felipe Massa was back in 16th.\n\nThe stories of the session were Lotus-Renault’s Romain Grosjean finishing third and Michael Schumacher placing his Mercedes in 4th place on the grid, despite growing controversy over their drag-reduction system. McLaren have accused Mercedes of flouting the rules with their “aero-package” that directs air from the rear wing back to the front wing to improve straight-line speed.\n\nQualifying results – top 10\n\n1. Lewis Hamilton McLaren 1:24.922\n\n2. Jenson Button McLaren 1:25.074\n\n3. Romain Grosjean Lotus-Renault 1:25.302\n\n4. Michael Schumacher Mercedes 1:25.336\n\n5. Mark Webber Red Bull-Racing 1:25.651\n\n6. Sebastian Vettel Red Bull-Racing 1:25.668\n\n7. Nico Rosberg Mercedes 1:25.686\n\n8. Pastor Maldonado Williams-Renault 1:25.908\n\n9. Nico Hulkenberg Force India-Mercedes1:26.451\n\n10. Daniel Ricciardo STR-Ferrari 1:26.319"
