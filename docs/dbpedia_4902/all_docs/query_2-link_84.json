        "text": "Max Verstappen came out on top of a thrilling Red Bull battle to clinch his 36th career pole position at Suzuka, ahead of Sergio Perez. Here’s the full starting grid.\n\nThe Red Bulls occupy the front row for Sunday’s Japanese Grand Prix, almost three-tenths of a second clear of McLaren’s Lando Norris as Verstappen and Perez traded fastest times at the front.\n\nMax Verstappen takes Japanese Grand Prix pole\n\nThe Dutch driver dug deep on his final run in Q3 to put in a 1:28.197 to finish just 0.066 clear of Perez, with the Mexican driver all but matching his teammate on the final runs as the duo squabbled over the fastest sector times.\n\nWith Norris finishing third for McLaren, Australian GP winner Carlos Sainz was once again the higher-placed Ferrari driver as he claimed fourth on the grid for the Scuderia, with Fernando Alonso fifth for Aston Martin.\n\nOscar Piastri underlined McLaren’s pace by clinching sixth in the other MCL38, while Lewis Hamilton finished seventh for Mercedes ahead of Ferrari’s Charles Leclerc as the Monegasque only did one timed run in Q3.\n\nGeorge Russell was ninth for Mercedes, with Yuki Tsunoda coming out on top of the RB battle to claim 10th place on the grid.\n\nPlanetF1.com recommends\n\nF1 2024: Head-to-head qualifying record between team-mates\n\nSeven must-see F1 weekends to tick off your 2024 bucket list – and how to get there as cheaply as possible\n\nThe positions between 11th and 15th were decided in Q2, where Daniel Ricciardo took 11th place after being narrowly beaten into Q3 by Tsunoda. Nico Hulkenberg was 12th for Haas as the German driver fell foul of track limits during his first run in Q2, while Valtteri Bottas took 13th for Sauber.\n\nAlex Albon finished 14th for Williams, while Esteban Ocon was the higher-placed Alpine driver as he took 15th place.\n\nIn Q1, Lance Stroll was a surprise knock-out as the Aston Martin driver failed to progress. Pierre Gasly finished 17th for Alpine, as the French driver complained about the traction of his car.\n\nKevin Magnussen claimed 18th for Haas, while Logan Sargeant and Zhou Guanyu fill the back row for Williams and Sauber, respectively.\n\nFor now, there are no grid penalties applied to any driver, but George Russell and Oscar Piastri have been summoned before the stewards in Japan over an allegedly unsafe release from the Mercedes driver as he entered the pitlane alongside the McLaren during Q1.\n\nF1 provisional starting grid: 2024 Japanese Grand Prix\n\n1. Max Verstappen Red Bull 1:28.197\n\n2. Sergio Perez Red Bull +0.066\n\n3. Lando Norris McLaren +0.292\n\n4. Carlos Sainz Ferrari +0.485\n\n5. Fernando Alonso Aston Martin +0.489\n\n6. Oscar Piastri McLaren +0.563\n\n7. Lewis Hamilton Mercedes +0.569\n\n8. Charles Leclerc Ferrari +0.589\n\n9. George Russell Mercedes +0.811\n\n10. Yuki Tsunoda RB +1.216\n\n11. Daniel Ricciardo RB 1:29.472\n\n12. Nico Hulkenberg Haas 1:29.494\n\n13. Valtteri Bottas Sauber 1:29.593\n\n14. Alex Albon Williams 1:29.714\n\n15. Esteban Ocon Alpine 1:29.816\n\n16. Lance Stroll Aston Martin 1:30.024\n\n17. Pierre Gasly Alpine 1:30.119\n\n18. Kevin Magnussen Haas 1:30.131\n\n19. Logan Sargeant Williams 1:30.139\n\n20. Zhou Guanyu Sauber 1:30.143"
