        "text": "1981\n\nAlain Prost claimed the first pole position of his career at the German Grand Prix in Hockenheim. Nelson Piquet went on to win the race with Prost finishing second. Prost went on to claim another 32 pole positions during his Formula One career and as of 2011, sits joint third in the top pole scorers in F1 alongside Jim Clark.\n\n1959\n\nThe 1959 German Grand Prix is the only year where the race was not held at the Nurburgring or Hockenheim circuits. Instead the race was held at the AVUS circuit in Berlin. Not so much a circuit, more two stretches of motorway with a hairpin at either end. The race was split into two heats, as there was fear the tyres would not last. British driver Tony Brooks went on to win the race, with Dan Gurney and Phil Hill completing the all Ferrari podium.\n\n1970\n\nThe 1970 German Grand Prix was switched last minute to Hockenheim from the Nurburgring after drivers refused to race there until safety was improved. The race was won by Jochen Rindt to take him 20 points clear in the championship. Rindt went on to become the only posthumous Formula One world champion as he was killed during the at Monza later that year during the Italian Grand Prix.\n\n1964\n\nDutch driver and nobleman Carel Godin de Beaufort died at the Nurburgring during the 1964 German Grand Prix. Competing in Formula One from 1957 until his death, Beaufort started 31 races but only managed to clock up four points and no podium finishes during his short racing career.\n\nÂ© ESPN Sports Media Ltd."
