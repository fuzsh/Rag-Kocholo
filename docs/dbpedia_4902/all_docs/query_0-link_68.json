        "text": "If you were to list out the strangest cars ever to compete in a Formula One world championship grand prix, you’d probably say the 4-wheel drive Ferguson P99 or the 6-wheel Tyrrell P34. You could even go as far as to say one of the weird creations in the 1970s like the Eifelland E21 or the Ligier JS5. They were all fairly odd for their time, but there was one car which was entered in the 1959 US Grand Prix which was so weird, it’s almost beyond belief that it was allowed to race. The car was a Midget and the driver was Rodger Ward.\n\nWard’s earlier career in America was a slow burner. In his first few years he didn’t get particularly good results, however in 1957 and 1958 he started to pick up some victories and with some momentum behind him, Ward teamed up with A.J. Watson and Bob Wilke to form Leader Card Racers in 1959. With this formidable team he became the USAC national champion that year and also won the Indy 500.\n\nWard also excelled on the short dirt ovals in Sprint and Midget cars, to the point that he was regarded as one of the best ever on the loose stuff. He won at all the famous dirt circuits, Sacramento, Springfields, Syracuse, Phoenix and the Hoosier 100. The dirt cars at the time were very different to what Ward would have run at the big paved ovals like Indianapolis.\n\nJust after Ward had won the Indy 500 in 1959, the promoters at Lime Rock Park invited him to drive in a Formula Libre race alongside other racing stars, including Pedro and Ricardo Rodriguez. A Formula Libre race was a mixture of sportscars and single seaters, including Formula One cars. Ward told Nigel Roebuck of Motorsport Magazine that he thought the organisers had an ulterior motive, “I guess they figured, “well we’ll get him up here to a road course and show him how to drive”.\n\nWard had originally secured a drive in a Cooper Monaco, an ideal sportscar to take on a circuit like Lime Rock Park, but the owner then let Ward down at the last minute deciding to give the drive to established sportscar driver John Fitch instead. Ward fired back “John Fitch? That turkey came to Indianapolis, he couldn’t get going fast enough to get warm!”\n\nMotorsport journalist Chris Economaki then pointed Ward in the direction of a Midget car which was available through Ken Brenn. A Midget car was about as far removed from a Cooper Monaco as possible. Midget’s raced on short dirt ovals, normally with 2 or 3 left hand turns per lap. They were very short and almost looked like squashed roadsters that competed at Indianapolis, but they were very manoeuvrable. The drivers tended to drive them on the throttle in long drifts through the dirt turns. They were rarely going straight, but because they were never designed for circuit racing, they only had one gear, drum brakes which were operated using a handle outside of the cockpit, they had a solid front axle and torsion bar rear suspension.\n\nFiring back at the idea of racing a midget against purpose-built road racing cars, Ward said to Economaki, “obviously you have to be kidding, I’m not going to embarrass myself.” But with no other alternatives available, he struck a deal with Brenn and decided to enter the Midget. He did manage to secure himself a $2,000 appearance fee from the race organisers, obviously with the mindset of ‘if I am going to embarrass myself, then I might as well get paid for it.”\n\nPractice at Lime Rock went well, and Ward was starting to throw the car sideways in the corners as he would have done on the dirt, but he initially had too long a gear in it which was hindering his straight-line speed. His little midget was up against some serious machinery, specifically designed for a circuit like Lime Rock Park, there was even a Maserati 250F Formula One car entered. One of the favourites was George Constantine who had a factory Aston Martin.\n\nConstantine broke the track record in qualifying and of course the sportscar-mad crowd went wild. Ward remembers that “I was next out and broke his record by half a second and you could hear a pin drop on the grass.” Race day saw three heats, the second and third heats Ward dominated. He even lapped Fitch three times and made sure to salute Fitch each time he passed by. Ward had to leave soon after the race but said to Brenn that he should keep all the money they had won in the race. An astonished Brenn said “well, it was $4,900, and that was a haul in 1959.”\n\nMeanwhile, Alec Ullman was putting a deal together to hold the first ever world championship Formula One grand prix in the United States. Technically the Indianapolis 500 was also part of the world championship in the 1950s, but the Formula One drivers never bothered to enter it, other than Alberto Ascari in 1952. This was an opportunity to have Formula One cars and stars competing on US soil. It was to be held on the roads and runways of the Sebring airfield, but Ullman wanted some home-grown stars to pull in the crowd. Other than AJ Foyt, there wasn’t anyone in the American domestic racing scene much bigger than Rodger Ward. Ullman approached Ward with an offer to compete in the Grand Prix. The problem was he didn’t have an F1 car to offer him.\n\nWard accepted the offer, but rather than accepting because he wanted to compete against the supposed best drivers in the world, there was a much simpler reason. “Alec Ullman called me up and invited me to race in the grand prix. He offered me some money, and I was in the habit of accepting money, so I told him I’d bring the Midget.” Obviously buoyed on from the performance of the Midget in the Lime Rock Park race against Formula One and sportscars, Ward decided to enter it into a fully-fledged Formula One grand prix to see what it could do.\n\nIf you thought a Midget car was about as far removed from a Cooper Monaco sportscar as possible, it was in a whole different world to a Cooper Formula One car. The Midget in question was a Kurtis-Kraft owned by Ward’s team boss Bob Wilkie. It had a 1.7 litre, 4-cylinder port injected Offenhauser engine. The Offenhauser engine was the stable power unit in American USAC and Midget car racing and was based on an initial design from 1934. This was compared to purpose built and modern 2.5 litre Climax, Ferrari and Porsche engines in F1.\n\nWard and Wilkie decided to modify the Midget, remembering the gearing issue pulling out of the turns at Lime Rock. “We did some work on this car, we actually put a clutch in it, and a two-speed differential, together with a two-speed gearbox, so it was like we had four speeds (albeit operated by two different gear levers).” The other change they had to make was to run the Offenhauser engine on gasoline, not the exotic fuels which were used in American racing.\n\nWard was in a confident mood as he arrived at Sebring. It’s probably safe to say Ward didn’t hold the European machines in particularly high regard, especially following his performance at Lime Rock Park. Ward had also competed in the ‘Monzapolis’ Race of Two Worlds event in Monza, Italy the year before. This was the race where the USAC cars went head to head with the best Europe could offer on the fast Monza oval. The Europeans largely stayed away for the first race in 1957, so it was a clean sweep for the big American roadsters which were far better suited to the high speeds of the oval.\n\nFor 1958, Ferrari and Maserati got involved with specially built cars and although the European teams showed more speed, the Americans once again were victorious. This dominant showing for the American cars was probably in the back of Ward’s mind. This was also a few years before Jack Brabham appeared at Indianapolis with his Cooper and showed everyone what a small, light rear-engine car could do against the big roadsters.\n\nCooper was the dominant force in the 1959 Formula One season. As they came into the season finale at Sebring, Jack Brabham was vying with Stirling Moss for the world championship title, with Ferrari’s Tony Brooks as an outside contender. Young Cooper driver Bruce McLaren was also keen to race well and win his first Grand Prix.\n\nIn his book, ‘The Grand Prix Carpetbaggers’, Cooper team boss, John Cooper, reflected on an encounter he had with Ward, Bruce McLaren and Jack Brabham before practice at the hotel in Sebring. Ward greeted the party and informed them he was competing in the grand prix. The trio congratulated Ward and asked what car he was driving, thinking he was renting a Formula One car from an established team. Ward told them he was going to drive the Midget dirt car. Brabham responded in amazement, “In the grand prix?!”\n\nWard replied “sure and have you guys got a surprise waiting for you. Why, on every turn I’ll blow you right off the road.” When Cooper tried to reason with Ward, kindly suggesting he was biting off more than he could chew with the Midget, Ward said “I know what a midget can do, and I know it can take a corner faster than any of those sports cars you have in Europe. You might be faster on the straights, but when it comes to the turns you won’t have a chance. Sebring’s a lot of turns isn’t it?” Well Sebring did have a lot of turns, but it also had a lot of straights.\n\nIn the Motorsport Magazine race report, Michael Tee gave his usual run-down of the entry list. That is until he got to the back of the field which he described as being “made up of a moteliest collection of also-rans that ever graced a grand prix circuit.” He started with an old Connaught and its “popping and spluttering” exhaust note, a little 1.5 litre Osca mated to an old F2 Cooper chassis, and the Maserati 250F Tec Mec which was seen as a bit of a flop in the racing world. He then got on to Ward. Tee listed out the features of the car in great detail, almost as if to inform the reader of firstly what the hell a Midget car was, but also to point out the massive differences to an F1 car.\n\nOn the day of the first practice, the Cooper team were amazed to find Ward’s Midget had passed scrutineering. This is hardly surprising as the regulations were a lot more relaxed in 1959 and the preparation of the US teams tended to be extremely high. They all rolled out of the pitlane when the green flag was waved, and it was almost inevitable that the first cars to hit turn one was Ward’s Midget and the two Coopers of McLaren and Brabham.\n\nAs predicted, the two Coopers swept through the turn at great speed, hugging the apex as they passed through. The Midget on the other hand was slipping and sliding and had to go considerably slower to get around the turn. With the Formula One cars disappearing down the road, Ward’s eyes were now open to his predicament, Ward rapidly changed his opinion of the Formula One cars and said to Cooper after practice, “I’ve got to hand it to you, those European buggies sure take the corners fast.”\n\nWard was getting up to speed though and wowing spectators by pitching the little midget into the corners and drifting through on the power. Although the approach of Formula One drivers in the 1950s was very much around drifting the car, the sort of slip angles Ward was getting with the Midget was not often seen in Europe. But he was rapidly realising the Midget’s performance in the Formula Libre race at Lime Rock had clouded his judgement on how well it would do against top Formula One cars and drivers. Ward recalls “we had a lot of fun down there. I was getting up to 140mph on the straightaways, which was quite something in one of those Midgets. I wasn’t really surprised by how quickly the Formula One cars went. I knew they were great cars and it was absolutely not the same as racing against George Constantine!”\n\nI can only imagine what the spectators would have been thinking during that practice session and race. It’s a well-known observation that if you painted all modern-day Formula One cars the same colour it’s unlikely you would be able to tell them apart. You also have to really know what you’re looking for if you want to see how differently the cars are being driven.\n\nIf a train of five cars came past you at the 1959 US Grand Prix then you would have seen a rear-engine Cooper, a front engine Ferrari, a vintage Connaught, a Porsche RSK sportscar/F1 hybrid and then Ward in his Midget. All very different and all sounding different. They would have been driven differently too, with the tail out on the Ferrari, the Coopers in perfect balance, the hesitant Connaught and the nimble Porsche, and then Ward in a full drift corner to corner in the Midget. They would have all looked quick too but looks can be deceiving.\n\nBy the end of qualifying, Stirling Moss had put his Cooper on pole, with a time of 3 minutes flat. Ward was the last qualifier with a time of 3 minutes, 48 seconds. This was before the days of the 107% qualifying rule, so Ward was allowed to race and lined up in last place.\n\nThe race was fairly unspectacular for Ward, he gradually moved up the field as cars dropped out, before he himself dropped out on lap 20, when the makeshift clutch failed. Bruce McLaren won the race from Maurice Trintignant and Tony Brooks. Jack Brabham pushed his car across the line to become world champion. His was the first championship for a rear-engine car. With all of the focus on the front of the race and the battle for the world championship, Ward’s efforts were left largely unnoticed, at least in the written press. Michael Tee’s assessment of Ward’s efforts in Motorsport Magazine was that he “drove with great skill and nerve, but he was completely outclassed by the other cars, even the Tec Mec.”\n\nAn enduring friendship did form between Ward and Jack Brabham after Sebring though. “I told him he should take that Cooper to Indianapolis, and a couple of years later he did. And that of course was the beginning of the end for the roadster.” Within a few years both Jim Clark and Graham Hill had won the Indy 500 in rear-engine cars and the whole look of USAC racing changed from there on. Although Sprint and Midget cars are still front-engine to this day and don’t look that dissimilar to Ward’s 1959 Kurtis-Kraft.\n\nWhat happened to Ward after the US Grand Prix? His career went from strength to strength. In a six-year period from 1959 to 1965 he won 18 USAC races (by the end of his career it was 26), two USAC championships and two Indy 500s. In the same period, when he wasn’t winning the championship, he was finishing runner up to A.J Foyt three times. Foyt is widely regarded as not only the best USAC/Indy driver of all time, but one of the greatest racing drivers of all time period. During that era, Foyt and Ward were like Lewis Hamilton and Max Verstappen in Formula One today, not many other drivers got a look in.\n\nThen during the 1966 Indy 500, he pulled into the pits and said to the team manager words to the effect of ‘I’m done’. This wasn’t a driver on the way down either, he had won a race that year, but he’d achieved a lot and the enjoyment of driving had gone away. He was able to sign off and retire, which many American drivers racing on the ovals in that period sadly never got the chance to do.\n\nIn 1996, I was a 14-year-old motorsport fanatic attending my first Goodwood Festival of Speed. Every now and then one particular old Indy roadster would drive casually up the hill, but due to my youth and inexperience, I was only focused on the cars giving it ‘full noise’. As a result, I didn’t take much notice, although I did recognise the driver’s name. The car was driven by Ward, then aged 75. To this day I kick myself that I never approached him for an autograph. If I had known then what I know now, that he was one of the best American racers of all time, and that he had once entered a Midget car into a grand prix, I would not only have asked for his autograph, but I would have asked all about his career, including that US grand prix drive."
