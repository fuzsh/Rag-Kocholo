        "text": "With COVID-19 pandemic raging on, we are back with another list after our other list articles as here we have ‘F1 One-Offs’ in a new style.\n\nThe number of drivers to have had repeat successes in F1 is very few, but for several reasons, the number of one-hit wonders in the sport is even fewer. So to show off some of the drivers who have this status, we at FormulaRapida.net decided to compile a list of ‘One-Offs’, who had a sole win, podium, pole, fastest lap, start, or championship – but with some leeway, which we have explained under each head.\n\nF1 drivers with one win, from 1950 until 2019 – we have counted drivers who have had one or more fastest laps and just one pole position along with a victory but not who have had multiple podiums. The division here is name of the driver, grand prix, team and additional info about fastest lap/pole position:\n\nJohnnie Parsons (1950 Indy 500, Kurtis Kraft-Offenhauser) – one fastest lap in same race\n\nLee Wallard (1951 Indy 500, Kurtis Kraft-Offenhauser) – one fastest lap in same race\n\nTroy Ruttman (1952 Indy 500, Kuzma-Offenhauser)\n\nBob Sweikert (1955 Indianapolis 500, KK500D-Offenhauser)\n\nPat Flaherty (1956 Indianapolis 500, Watson-Offenhauser) – one pole in same race\n\nJoakim Bonnier (1959 Dutch GP, BRM) – one pole in same race\n\nGiancarlo Baghetti (1961 French GP, Ferrari) – one fastest lap in diff race\n\nLudovico Scarfiotti (1966 Italian GP, Ferrari) – one fastest lap in same race\n\nPeter Gethin (1971 Italian GP, BRM)\n\nVittorio Brambilla (1975 Austrian GP, March-Ford) – one pole in diff race, one fastest lap in same race\n\nPastor Maldonado (2012 Spanish GP, Williams) – one pole in same race\n\n[Note: Country-wise, Robert Kubica is lone from Poland to win, while Maldonado is lone from Venezuela with a F1 race victory]\n\nF1 drivers with one podium, from 1950 until 2019 – we have not counted drivers with one win as their lone podium but only those who have had just one second or third place finish which is mentioned.
