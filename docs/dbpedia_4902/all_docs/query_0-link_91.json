        "text": "Enzo Ferrari's refusal to accept the possibility that one of his drivers might be more famous than one of his cars made him just about the only person in grand prix racing who failed to get on with Juan Manuel Fangio. In 1956 they won the championship together. But in the eyes of the world Ferrari needed Fangio more than Fangio needed Ferrari. Fifteen years after Enzo's death they are saying much the same thing about Michael Schumacher.\n\n\"To Enzo the car was everything and the driver was a necessary evil,\" says Tony Brooks, the Englishman who drove for Ferrari and finished runner-up in the championship in 1959. \"When the team won a race, it was the car that did the winning, not the driver.\"\n\nMutual distrust meant that Fangio, like Brooks, stayed only one season with Ferrari. By contrast Schumacher begins his eighth season with the Italian team at the Australian grand prix in Melbourne on Sunday, and has won three of his five titles in the red cars from Maranello. To Brooks, however, he would have been no more likely than Fangio to win Ferrari's approval.\n\n\"Ferrari certainly wouldn't have let a driver run the team the way Schumacher does,\" Brooks says. \"He wouldn't have tolerated that at all. He was the boss and the drivers did what they were told. Schumacher has been a great catalyst, of course, and there's no doubt the team is built around him. But I reckon they'd have fallen out pretty quickly.\"\n\nSchumacher is odds-on to break Fangio's record of five titles over the coming months and few observers can contribute to the long-running debate over the relative merits of the two drivers with the authority of Brooks, who raced against Fangio in the maestro's final seasons and maintains a close interest in the contemporary scene. Now 71 and living in retirement in Surrey, Brooks believes that Fangio won his titles in a far more demanding environment.\n\n\"Nowadays the people in the pits control the whole situation. They tell the driver when to come in for a tyre change, when to push hard and so on. In Fangio's day the driver was told who was ahead of him and who was behind, and that was it. He had to work the rest of it out for himself.\"\n\nThe acceptance of personal risk is the other significant difference. \"To me,\" Brooks says, \"it's like comparing a tightrope walker in a circus, using a safety net, with someone trying to walk a tightrope strung over a very deep gorge. The biggest single difference is the knowledge that, when you're driving a car on the limit, any mistake could be your last. Compare that with the knowledge that, if you go off the road, the worst you can do is bend the car a bit. It's a totally different psychological challenge.\"\n\nNo other champion, in Brooks's view, has earned such respect from his peers as Fangio. \"He commanded awe. When he entered a room, it went quiet. His whole bearing was almost like royalty but it was accompanied by considerable modesty.\"\n\nHe was also a generous mentor, as Stirling Moss found when he joined Fangio in the Mercedes-Benz team in 1955. Brooks was never Fangio's team-mate but he learnt much from proximity on the track, not least at Monza in 1957, when the Vanwalls beat the Maseratis and Ferraris on their home ground.\n\n\"Monza was a great circuit in those days, before they messed it up by putting the chicanes in. It was a slipstreaming circuit, and in the early stages of the race there was a different leader at the end of every lap. Fangio, Stirling, Stuart [Lewis-Evans] and I were exchanging positions for quite some time.\"\n\nHaving overtaken Fangio, Brooks found the maestro repassing him as they drifted through the majestic Curva Grande at 140mph. \"I managed to get past him again around the back of the circuit but he did exactly the same thing again at the Curva Grande, even though that time I was going even faster. The third time I passed him around the back of the circuit I thought, right, I'm going to stay ahead of him this time. And I did, without using any of the blocking or weaving tactics that you see nowadays. So I really did learn from him at first hand how to take the Curva Grande. When I won the race the following year, I was grateful for the tuition.\"\n\nAlmost eight years after his death at the age of 84, Fangio remains something of an enigma. \"He was the most natural driver around at the time,\" Brooks says. \"He was so good that he could produce outstanding performances without exceeding his personal safety margins. Some of his qualities were anticipation, judgment, sensitivity in his hands and the seat of his pants, and of course great mental strength. He read a race very carefully and drove very intelligently. He was always one step ahead. But when you try to analyse exactly what gave him his edge, you come up against a stone wall.\"\n\nNor were his gifts confined to driving technique and race craft. \"He was recognised not only as the best driver but as the fairest,\" Brooks concludes. \"I never heard a single complaint about his behaviour, in or out of the cockpit, and there aren't many world champions you could say that about.\"\n\nBrooks was a 24-year-old dental student at the time he shot past the 45-year-old Fangio on the opening lap of the British grand prix at Silverstone in 1956, his world championship debut. A few laps later the throttle stuck on his BRM and sent it somersaulting off the track, smashing his jaw. \"That car was lethal,\" he remembers.\n\nThe following year, when he joined Moss and Lewis-Evans in the all-British Vanwall team, he found himself racing wheel to wheel with Fangio on a regular basis. At his first race of the season, in Monaco, he benefited from following in the master's tyre-tracks as they picked their way through the debris of an early accident which eliminated Moss's leading Vanwall along with the Ferraris of Peter Collins and Mike Hawthorn.\n\n\"My three compatriots got a bit carried away with each other and charged off like lunatics,\" Brooks recalls. \"Stirling overdid the late braking into the chicane on the second lap and went up the escape road, which was blocked off by telegraph poles and sandbags. One of the poles was flicked across the track. Collins was right behind Stirling and he finished up on the harbour edge, his car sitting on top of the sandbags.\n\n\"Fangio managed to slow down and very carefully drove his Maserati over the pole. I was next up and I slowed right down, too, but for some reason Hawthorn, who was right behind me, didn't slow down at all. He arrived at the chicane at great speed and hit the left-hand rear wheel of my car, which knocked his own wheel off. He parked his Ferrari alongside Peter's. I emulated Fangio and drove slowly over the pole before carrying on.\"\n\nBrooks finished second behind Fangio, even though his clutch failed in the opening laps. More than 2,000 clutchless gear changes left the palm of his hand looking like a piece of tenderised steak. \"Not,\" he adds, \"that one needs an excuse for finishing second to Fangio.\"\n\nWorld championships\n\nFangio 5 (1951, 1954, 1955, 1956, 1957)\n\nSchumacher 5 (1994, 1995, 2000, 2001, 2002)\n\nRace wins\n\nFangio 24\n\nSchumacher 64\n\nSecond places\n\nFangio 10\n\nSchumacher 34\n\nThird places\n\nFangio 1\n\nSchumacher 16\n\nSuccess rate\n\nFangio 24 wins out of 51 races: 47%\n\nSchumacher 64 wins out of 179: 35.7%\n\nPole positions\n\nFangio 28 out of 51 starts: 54.9%\n\nSchumacher 50 out of 179 starts: 27.9%\n\nFastest race laps\n\nFangio 23 out of 51 starts: 45.1%\n\nSchumacher 51 out of 179 starts: 28.4%\n\nChampionship points\n\nFangio 245\n\nSchumacher 945\n\nAverage points per race\n\nFangio 4.8\n\nSchumacher 5.2\n\nRoll of honour\n\nRace wins\n\nFangio held record for most grand prix wins, 24, from 1958 to 1968, when Jim Clark achieved the 25th and last win of his career. Fangio's ratio of wins to races driven remains unparalleled.\n\nSchumacher holds the all-time record of 64 grand prix wins. Won 11 out of 17 races last year, the record for wins in a season.\n\nHistory makers\n\nFangio remains the only Argentinian to have won the world championship and the only driver to win four consecutively. He won the world championship in four different types of car - Alfa Romeo, Ferrari, Mercedes-Benz and Maserati - a feat that has never been matched.\n\nSchumacher ended Ferrari's 21-year world championship drought in 2000. He is the first and only German driver to win the world championship in its 53-year history.\n\nUnrivalled champions\n\nBoth have won five world championships. No one has won more."
