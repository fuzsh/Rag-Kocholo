It is the national bird (and lends its name to the currency) of Guatemala. Usually rather shy, but can be found feeding quietly at fruiting trees. Male is unmistakable with long emerald plumes flowing out behind in flight or blowing in the wind when perched. On females, note large size, grayish head, gray bill, and greatly reduced jagged plumes on the side of the breast.",
