        "text": "In my experience, things always seem to happen when you least expect them, and this is especially true in the world of wildlife watching. Just when you think your chance of finding the animal you have been longing to see has vanished into thin air, it suddenly appears right in front of your eyes. And never has this happened more to me than on my recent visit to Costa Rica, a country blessed with more than its fair share of incredible natural treasures. Of course, I was hoping to see many of Costa Rica’s fascinating mammal, bird, reptile and amphibian species. But there was one species in particular that had long captured my imagination and I was really hoping to see – the extravagantly plumed, but elusive, resplendent quetzal.\n\nAt the halfway point of my itinerary I found myself in the Talamanca Mountains, in the small village of San Gerardo de Dota situated deep within the pristine cloud forest close to the (encouragingly named) Los Quetzales National Park. Having arrived in fading twilight, it wasn’t until daybreak the following morning that the true splendour of this location was apparent – steep mountain slopes covered in verdant vegetation, freshwater streams cascading between the trees, a chill in the air and not a single cloud in the sky. This was quetzal habitat and it was time to start exploring.\n\nThe resplendent quetzal is one of Costa Rica’s most symbolic and exotic birds. It is a bird that is beloved across much of world, enjoys an almost legendary status, and that I have long been desperate to see. The morning provided some sightings, but only glimpses – flashes of vibrant green plumage as a male flew between distant trees. Time passed quickly and before long it was time for lunch. As the clouds rolled in and light rain began to fall, it seemed as if my chance had vanished with the sun.\n\nI ordered food at the local café which overlooked a wonderful patch of cloud forest close to the bottom of the Savegre valley. I sat at my table thinking about when in the future I might be able to return, finally, to see a resplendent quetzal. All of a sudden the waiter, a local boy who was also well-skilled at spotting these iconic birds, ran over and said: ‘Two quetzals in the tree!’\n\nAmazing! And completely unexpected! We rushed to the back of the café, peered up into the tree, and there they were in all their stunning glory, two resplendent quetzals. The male in particular, with its long tail feathers, had perched itself in a wonderful gap in the foliage. This was a remarkable sighting and all the better since, only moments before, I had resigned myself to not seeing one of these magnificent birds.\n\nI was aware of a mixture of emotions whilst watching the quetzals, including elation, amazement, bewilderment and surprise. It summed up the reason why watching wildlife captivates so many of us – a delight in the unexpected. With a bewildering choice of flora and fauna, whatever your particular interest is – mammals, birds, insects, frogs, snakes, cetaceans or marine reptiles – a visit to Costa Rica is sure to delight."
