        "text": "Scientific Name :\n\nPharomachrus mocinno\n\nType :\n\nBirds\n\nDiet :\n\nOmnivore\n\nSize :\n\nBody: 15 to 16 inches; tail: 24 inches\n\nWeight :\n\n7 to 8 ounces\n\nSize relative to a 6-ft man :\n\nIUCN Red List Status :\n\nNear threatened\n\nLC\n\nNT\n\nVU\n\nEN\n\nCR\n\nEW\n\nEX\n\nLeast Concern Extinct\n\nCurrent Population Trend :\n\nDecreasing\n\nThe resplendent quetzal is an aptly named bird that many consider among the world's most beautiful. These vibrantly colored animals live in the mountainous, tropical forests of Central America where they eat fruit, insects, lizards, and other small creatures.\n\nTail Feathers and Coloring\n\nDuring mating season, male quetzals grow twin tail feathers that form an amazing train up to three feet (one meter) long. Females do not have long trains, but they do share the brilliant blue, green, and red coloring of their mates. Male colors tend to be more vibrant.\n\nReproduction\n\nResplendent quetzal pairs use their powerful beaks to hollow hole nests in rotted trees or stumps. Inside, they take turns incubating two or three eggs—though males have such long tails that they sometimes stick outside the nest.\n\nYoung quetzals can fly at about three weeks of age, but males do not begin to grow their long tail plumes for three years.\n\nRelationship With Humans\n\nResplendent quetzals are also known as Guatemalan quetzals, and the birds are the symbol of that nation. Guatemala also trades in currency known as the \"quetzal.\"\n\nUnfortunately, these striking birds are threatened in Guatemala and elsewhere throughout their range. They are sometimes trapped for captivity or killed, but their primary threat is the disappearance of their tropical forest homes. In some areas, most notably Costa Rica's cloud forests, protected lands preserve habitat for the birds and provide opportunities for ecotourists and eager bird watchers from around the globe.\n\nSuch admirers continue a long history of adoration for the quetzal. The bird was sacred to the ancient Maya and Aztec peoples, and royalty and priests wore its feathers during ceremonies."
