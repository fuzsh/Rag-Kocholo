Where do Quetzals nest?\n\nQuetzals prefer cloud forests in which the trees are 30-45 m tall.

What does the Quetzal look like?\n\nThe male quetzal has brightly colored tail feathers, which can be up to three feet long. The head, neck, chest, back and wings of the males are a metallic or iridescent green.

How strong is the Quetzal?\n\nQuetzal pairs use their strong and powerful beaks to hollow out nests in rotted trees or stumps. Sometimes, however, they simply take over and enlarge the abandoned nest.\n\n10. What country has Quetzal as its national bird?\n\nIt is the national bird of Guatemala, and its image is found on the country’s flag and coat of arms. It also lends its name to the country’s currency, the Guatemalan Quetzal\n\n11.
