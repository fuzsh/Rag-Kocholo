        "text": "The resplendent quetzal is one of the most beautiful birds in the world, and it can only be found in Central America. This magnificent bird is famous for its colorful plumage and long, wavy tailfeather that can grow up to 3 feet long. It is so famous that there is actually an Aztec god, Quetzalcoatl, named after the bird, and the national currency of Guatemala is called the quetzal. It is also particularly coveted by birdwatchers because it is so rare. Recent studies estimate that there are only around 50,000 quetzals left in the whole world, and the International Union for the Conservation of Nature has assessed the resplendent quetzal population as being Near Threatened. Tragically, with the rise of deforestation and poaching, the prevalence of this legendary bird has been in decline over the past few decades. Unless serious efforts are made towards the conservation of quetzals, we may find very soon that the days of seeing quetzals in the wild have passed. Donating towards the conservation efforts of non-profit companies such as Greenpeace or Wildlife Conservation Society, or even just speaking out against deforestation and poaching, can make a big difference in protecting the quetzal population that still remains.\n\nMany travellers who come through Panama make it a point to try to spot a quetzal before leaving the country, and ornithologists and birdwatchers come from all over the world with the hopes of spotting this rare bird. So how can you succeed where so many others have failed? How can you come away from your travels in Panama with a stunning photograph of a resplendent quetzal? Now, obviously I cannot guarantee that if you follow this guide you will 100% see a quetzal, but here are my best tips for how to spot a quetzal in Panama:\n\nWhere should I look for a quetzal?\n\nThe resplendent quetzal (Pharomachrus mocinno) can only be found from the southernmost state in Mexico to western Panama. Their usual habitat is in cloud forests that sit on the slopes of mountains. Cloud forests are particularly moist forest ecosystems with frequent low-level cloud cover. In Panama, the best place to spot a quetzal is either in the Boquete Highlands or the dense cloud forest of the Fortuna Forest Reserve, both of which are located quite close to the border of Costa Rica.\n\nHere is a map of the distribution of resplendent quetzals in Panama, with the darkest purples marking the greatest population density:\n\nQuetzals are known to nest around 200 feet off the ground and make their mating calls in the air at a similar elevation. They prefer to nest in trees that are in the process of decomposition because of the moisture. You also have a better chance of seeing a quetzal around fruit trees because they are fruit-eating birds. So, if you are out in a cloud forest looking for resplendent quetzals and you see a decomposing fruit tree, look up!\n\nWhat does a quetzal sound like?\n\nAny experienced birdwatcher will tell you that before spotting any bird that you are searching for, it is extremely important to know what that bird sounds like. If you can identify the call of a bird, then you can know if you're in the vicinity of the bird you are looking for. The call of the resplendent quetzal has been described as sounding like a squeaky door hinge; however, I do not find this description to be very helpful if you’re going to actually go listen for a quetzal. The resplendent quetzal actually has 6 distinct calls as far as we know, and the best way to familiarize yourself with the vocal profile of the resplendent quetzal is to watch videos or listen to recordings of the bird.\n\nHere is YouTube video that gives a good idea of what a quetzal’s call sounds like:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpGzY7GKygA\n\nWhen is the best time to spot a quetzal?\n\nThe best time of the year to see a resplendent quetzal in Panama is between February and April. This is their mating season, and so they are going to be far more active as they are going around looking for another quetzal to mate with. This is also the dry season in Panama, so quetzals will naturally be more active due to the lack of heavy rain. Resplendent quetzals tend to feed around the midday hours, so they will be more likely to be out of their nests during this time of the day, giving you a much better chance of spotting one!\n\nWhat do I need to bring when searching for quetzals?\n\nFirst of all, if you’re going to search for quetzals, then you will without a doubt be going into a cloud forest. Cloud forests are just what the name suggests, forests in the clouds, and so rain is a near-inevitability. Cloud forests also sit on the slopes of mountains, which means some hiking will be required of you. I would recommend wearing good quality hiking boots and a waterproof backpack that will prevent any of your valuables from getting wet. You also want to pack a raincoat to keep yourself dry in the moist cloud forest. A good set of binoculars is a necessity for anyone who is serious about birdwatching. And if you do end up finding a resplendent quetzal, you want to see all of the beautiful details of its plumage, its big black eyes, and its magnificent tailfeather in all their glory. What a shame it would be to stumble upon this rare bird only to see it as a green blur in the distance? A hat is another useful tool for getting the best possible view of a bird. It keeps the sun out of your eyes so you can see more clearly and be more aware of any birds that may be flying around you. It’s not just a fashion statement for birdwatchers. If you would like to share with others the beauty of the resplendent quetzal, bring your camera so you can snap a photograph and show it to all of your friends back home. Just make sure that camera has a waterproof case!\n\nCheck out this super fun video of a resplendent quetzal from EPIC Nature:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN9i_bLHOxk"
