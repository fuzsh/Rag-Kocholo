        "text": "Xochitl-Quetzal Aztec Dance was founded in 2015 out of Our Lady of Tepeyac Elementary School in Chicago’s Little Village Community. We expanded in 2017 to The Back of The Yards community and now have dancers from various Mexican-immigrant communities in the Chicago metropolitan area. Our founder and director Henry Cervantes learned to dance from Chiefs from Chicago and Mexico. We provide vibrant and dynamic performances at festivals, concerts, and special community events. Xochitl-Quetzal (xo-chee ket-zal) means “precious flower feather” in the Nahuatl language. Xochitl-Quetzal is the name of the female Aztec goddess of youth, beauty, and the arts. Flowers and feathers on her headdress often represent her in Aztec codices.\n\nPlease bring a bag chair or blanket to enjoy this outdoor program on the library's back lawn. The library will provide a sweet treat for you as well!\n\nIn case of inclement weather, we will hold this program inside in the library's Lincoln Room.\n\nThis program is brought to you by a grant provided by the Illinois Humanties Council Road Scholars Speakers Bureau, which invites Illinois authors, artists, and educators to share their expertise and enthusiasm with people throughout the state, enabling local nonprofit organizations to present free-admission cultural programs of high quality to their communities for a modest fee."
