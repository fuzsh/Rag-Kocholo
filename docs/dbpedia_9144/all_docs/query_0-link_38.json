This is then fastened onto premium vegetable tanned leather that is hand-tied using a fine leather lace around the border of the belt. All of our belts only wear better over time as the natural fit forms to all waist sizes for both men and women.\n\nBehind the Name:\n\nThe Quetzal, the national bird of Guatemala, is depicted on the country’s flag and coat of arms and lends its name to the local currency.
