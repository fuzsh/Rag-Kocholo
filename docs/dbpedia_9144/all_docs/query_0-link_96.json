Any opinions in the examples do not represent the opinion of the Cambridge Dictionary editors or of Cambridge University Press or its licensors.\n\nTranslations of quetzal\n\nin Chinese (Traditional)\n\n（中南美洲產羽毛鮮麗的）大咬鵑, 格查爾（瓜地馬拉貨幣單位）…\n\nin Chinese (Simplified)\n\n（中南美洲产羽毛鲜丽的）大咬鹃, 格查尔（危地马拉货币单位）…\n\nin Spanish\n\nquetzal, quetzal guatemalteco…\n\nin Portuguese\n\nquetzal…\n\nNeed a translator?\n\nGet a quick, free translation!\n\n{{#randomImageQuizHook.filename}} {{#randomImageQuizHook.isQuiz}}\n\nTest your vocabulary with our fun image quizzes\n\nTry a quiz now\n\n{{/randomImageQuizHook.isQuiz}} {{^randomImageQuizHook.isQuiz}} {{/randomImageQuizHook.isQuiz}} {{/randomImageQuizHook.filename}}\n\nWord of the Day\n\nhumanitarian\n\nUK\n\nYour browser doesn't support HTML5 audio\n\n/hjuːˌmæn.ɪˈteə.ri.ən/\n\nUS\n\nYour browser doesn't support HTML5 audio\n\n/hjuːˌmæn.ɪˈter.i.ən/\n\n(a person who is) involved in or connected with improving people's lives and reducing suffering\n\nAbout this\n\nBlog\n\nSimply the best!
