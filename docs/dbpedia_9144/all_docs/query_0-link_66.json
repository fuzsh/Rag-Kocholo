The flight feathers are blackish.\n\nOn the tail, four elongated, narrow, filamentous uppertail coverts named “streamers” also have iridescent blue-green.\n\nOn the underparts, lower breast, belly and undertail-coverts are red. Undertail is white.\n\nOn the head, two laterally compressed disks made with green filamentous feathers extend around the eyes, forming a kind of short crest in the middle of the crown.\n\nThe yellow bill is partially hidden at base by these feathers. Eyes are dark brown. Legs and feet are pale pinkish.\n\nFEMALE\n\nMALE\n\nThe Resplendent Quetzal female is different with duller plumage and shorter tail.\n\nShe has green upperparts, throat and upper breast. The green greater wing coverts and uppertail coverts are fairly elongated.\n\nPrimary flight feathers are blackish, with buff outer webs. Uppertail is blackish.\n\nOn the underparts, lower breast and upper belly are buffy-grey. Lower belly and undertail coverts are red.\n\nUndertail feathers are conspicuously barred grey-black and white.\n\nHead is bronze-green. Bill is blackish to yellow.\n\nImmature is similar to female with yellow bill, bronzer upperparts and more white in undertail.\n\nWe find two subspecies:\n\nP.m. mocinno is found in S Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras, E El Salvador and NC Nicaragua.\n\nP.m. costaricensis is found in Costa Rica and Western highlands of Panama.\n\nThis one is slightly smaller than nominate, with shorter and narrower uppertail-coverts.\n\nVOICE: SOUNDS BY XENO-CANTO\n\nThe Resplendent Quetzal’s calls include a fairly hard “k’wak”, and a steady “ka-ka-ka…”\n\nDuring the flight displays, or when the bird is excited, we can hear a rolling chatter “kwar-ahrr-rrak…”\n\nThe song is a plaintive, steadily repeated “k’yoi-k’yow k’yoi-k’yow…” or “whee’o-whee’u whee’o-whee’u…”\n\nHABITAT:\n\nThe Resplendent Quetzal frequents humid evergreen forest, and is often perched high in trees. It is also found in well vegetated ravines and cliffs, but also in clearings and pastures, and open areas with scattered trees close to the forests. This species is visible from 900 up to 2300 metres of elevation in S Mexico, and from 1200-1500 metres up to 3200 metres farther south.\n\nRANGE:\n\nSee above in “subspecies”.\n\nBEHAVIOUR:\n\nThe Resplendent Quetzal is primarily frugivorous, feeding mainly on fruits of Lauraceae. But it also takes some invertebrates such as beetles and their larvae, flies, orthopterans and moths, and small vertebrates such as lizards and frogs, and snails.\n\nIt performs sallies to pluck fruit, and numerous birds may gather in one tree at the same time.\n\nThe Resplendent Quetzal is a good hunter, swooping down onto the prey for snatching it. It swallows the food while flying.\n\nThe green plumage provides an excellent camouflage when the bird perches in trees.\n\nThe male is territorial and chases away from the nest-site all predators and intruders, using direct flight at them while giving a swearing call.\n\nDuring the territory defence, it gives melodious whistles of two high-pitched notes, repeated at ten minutes intervals.\n\nDuring the breeding season, the monogamous males often displays in groups of ten to twenty birds. These groups are not leks because the behaviour is different, and after the displays, each male returns to its territory and joins the female which has remained there.\n\nBut some males are alone, and the Resplendent Quetzal appears to use these displays and dances to attract a mate. Several males can pursue noisily one single female flying from branch to branch.\n\nOnce the pair is formed, they build the nest together and mate inside the cavity.\n\nThe Resplendent Quetzal is resident in Mexico, only performing altitudinal movements according to the food resources. Some local migrations are observed in Costa Rica.\n\nFLIGHT:\n\nThe Resplendent Quetzal, as other Trogons, has rounded wings allowing strong flight action. This bird flies very well in the limited forest space.\n\nIt performs undulating flight over longer distances, interspersed with series of rapid wing-beats.\n\nDuring the flight, including the flight displays, the long uppertail-coverts follow the movements of the bird.\n\nREPRODUCTION:\n\nBreeding season varies according to the range.\n\nThe Resplendent Quetzal nests in tree holes, sometimes in abandoned woodpecker’s nest.\n\nThe cavity is excavated by both sexes in decaying bark and wood. They do not add any nest materials as lining.\n\nThe hole is about 10-12 cm of diameter, and placed between 4, 5 and 27 metres up in trunk or stump in the forest or close clearing.\n\nFemale usually lays two pale blue eggs on the bare floor of the cavity. Incubation lasts 17-19 days, and both parents share all the nesting duties.\n\nChicks are brooded by male and female during the first week. They are well feathered two weeks later, except on the head.\n\nThey are fed with insects during the first days, and parents clean the nest regularly. At two weeks of age, they are fed with fruits and small vertebrates added to the insects.\n\nThey remain at nest during three weeks and then, the male helps them to fly, feeding and tending them when they are going out from the hole.\n\nThey remain some times with their parents. The males need three years to develop the beautiful adult's feathers."
