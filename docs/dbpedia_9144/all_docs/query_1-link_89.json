        "text": "By Paul Gerace\n\nOne of the most colorful birds found here in Costa Rica is also a personal favorite of mine. The Resplendent Quetzal has iridescent feathers that can show colors of green, cobalt blue, lime, yellow, and ultramarine. It’s body can appear green, gold, or blue-violet also depending on the light. The chest is a bright red and it’s bill is a bright yellow. To watch it in flight is an eye opening experience that one never forgets.\n\nOnly the male has tail feathers that can extend over 2 feet long during mating season.\n\nThey are found from southern Mexico down into Panama. But the best place to see them is right here in Costa Rica in our protected forests.\n\nResplendent Quetzals will eat small insects and an assortment of fruits but their main food is wild avocados.\n\nMy favorite place to see them is either in San Gerardo de Dota or Santa Maria de Dota. They are in the Trogon family and their large eyes have helped them adapt to the low light of the cloud forests.\n\nResplendent Quetzals are classified as near-threatened due to the loss of habitat but are flourishing in the above mentioned areas, as well as in the Monteverde cloud forest."
