A Fun Roast for Quetzal

Quick to judge, but never wise,

Utterly lost in your own lies,

Egos bigger than your brain,

Totally clueless, it’s a shame,

Zoning out, you’re hard to blame,

And here I thought you might have game,

Laughable mess, you’re just the same.

A promise of laughter in love's playful air.

Life's greatest treasure, I'm grateful, it's you.
