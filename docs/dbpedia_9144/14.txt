The Story Behind Quetzal’s Name

The quetzal, a native Central and South American bird is often held as a traditional symbol of liberty. Captured for its beautiful head and tail feathers, it was found that the bird could not survive being held for a long time in captivity. This legend inspired the name of our charity, and that’s how Quetzal can into existence.

Born from this powerful symbolism, Quetzal traces its origins to the determined efforts of Jennifer Anthony Black in early 1989. Initially established as a self-help group, Quetzal blossomed from Jennifer’s visionary drive to support women navigating the tumultuous journey of recovering from childhood sexual abuse (CSA). Its core aim was to shatter the psychological barriers that restrained these resilient survivors.

Rooted in empathy and empowerment, the charity has delivered over 35 years of service through free long-term counselling, community outreach, and trauma-informed events and activities. Looking back at the past and present, we had one of our well-wishers pen down a few words celebrating the spirit of quetzal’s unwavering resilience, echoing the journey of those it has supported.
