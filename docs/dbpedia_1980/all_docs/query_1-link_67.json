        "text": "Introduction\n\nRelevance of the theme\n\nThe study of Romantic Literature constitutes an essential foundation in the student's education as a critical reader and producer of texts, as this literary movement articulates unequivocally the expression of the lyrical self with the construction of national identity. In a period of political and social effervescence, romantic texts transcend the simple aesthetic dimension and begin to mirror the aspirations, anxieties, and ideals of an entire era. Furthermore, Romanticism inaugurates an era of valorization of sentiment and creative freedom, establishing a counterpoint with the rigidity of previous literary schools, such as Neoclassicism. Thus, an in-depth study of Romanticism enables not only the understanding of a crucial phase in literary history but also a reflection on how currents of thought influence artistic production and the perception of the world in different periods.\n\nContextualization\n\nRomantic Literature is traditionally studied in High School as part of the Portuguese curriculum, playing a vital role in explaining the literary and cultural transformations of the 19th century. This theme is interspersed with the analysis of sequential and antecedent literary movements, allowing students to perceive the evolution of thought and artistic form over time. The insertion of Romanticism in the curriculum occurs precisely at the moment when the student has already mastered the basic structures of language and is ready to delve into an analysis that demands a higher level of abstraction and critical thinking. The study of Romanticism in Brazil unfolds in three distinct phases, each with its thematic and stylistic specificities, allowing for a more nuanced understanding of the historical and cultural processes that shaped national literature. Furthermore, the connection of Romanticism with national identity issues and the construction of the idea of the nation are topics that dialogue with other disciplines such as History and Sociology, reinforcing interdisciplinarity and the relevance of the theme for the integral formation of the student.\n\nTheory\n\nExamples and cases\n\nTo illustrate Romantic Literature in practice, it is instructive to examine works by iconic authors, such as 'Iracema' by José de Alencar, which encapsulates both romantic idealism and distinct national elements. Another emblematic case is 'A Moreninha' by Joaquim Manuel de Macedo, considered the first romantic novel in Brazil, which explores idealized love and the issue of social customs of the time. Both works are representative of Romanticism in Brazil, highlighting nationalism, exoticism, and the idealization of women, recurring themes in this literary period. Furthermore, Gonzaga in 'Marília de Dirceu' expresses amorous lyricism and romantic idealization that anticipate characteristics of Romanticism. These texts are more than simple narratives; they constitute a vivid portrait of the social, political, and emotional tensions of their time, providing valuable insights into romantic ideals and Brazilian society in the 19th century.\n\nComponents\n\nDefinition and Origins of Romanticism\n\nRomanticism was an artistic and intellectual movement that emerged in Europe in the late 18th century as a reaction to Enlightenment rationalism and the strict norms of Neoclassicism. It proposed a new relationship with art and literature, emphasizing emotion, individuality, and imagination. In Brazil, Romanticism manifested itself shortly after Independence, serving as a vehicle for the search for a unique cultural identity and the expression of national sentiment. The libertarian and revolutionary ideals of Europe found an echo in the young nation, which sought to assert its place in the world through a literature that valued the national and the individual. Characteristics such as the worship of nature, the valorization of historical past, and the focus on nationalism are striking in Brazilian Romanticism, reflecting the desire to build an authentically national literature. The initial phase of Romanticism in Brazil is marked by the publication of 'Suspiros Poéticos e Saudades' by Gonçalves de Magalhães, consolidating the break with neoclassical aesthetics.\n\nFirst Phase of Romanticism in Brazil: Nationalism and Indianism\n\nThe first phase of Brazilian Romanticism is dominated by nationalism and the idealization of the Indian, symbolizing the purity and nobility of the country's pre-colonial past. This phase is also known as 'Indianist' and had as its main exponent the author José de Alencar, whose works sought to create a national mythology based on heroic indigenous figures and the exaltation of the Brazilian landscape. The Indian is portrayed as a noble savage and becomes a symbol of resistance against colonial oppression. Nationalism in the face of the country's recent independence found in literature a way to reinforce national identity and sovereignty. This phase is also marked by the publication of poetic works that sought to rescue local history and legends, such as 'Caramuru' by Santa Rita Durão and 'O Uraguai' by Basílio da Gama, although these latter works are still influenced by neoclassical style.\n\nSecond Phase of Romanticism in Brazil: Overcoming Nationalism and the Mal du Siècle\n\nThe second phase of Brazilian Romanticism, sometimes called 'Byronian' or 'Mal du Siècle,' is characterized by an introspective and melancholic turn, in which the figure of the accursed poet emerges to express disillusionment with the world and with the romantic ideals of the first generation. In this phase, Álvares de Azevedo stands out, whose poetry shows influences from the English poet Lord Byron, marked by pessimism, individualism, and morbidity, constituting a reaction to the previous naive nationalism. The poets of this generation explore themes such as unrequited love, existential boredom, and escapism through fantasy and death, reflecting a period of political and social instability in Brazil and the disenchantment of the intellectual youth of the time.\n\nThird Phase of Romanticism in Brazil: Condoreirismo and Romantic Prose\n\nCondoreirismo is the poetic aspect of the third phase of Brazilian Romanticism and receives this name in allusion to the condor, a bird that flies high, symbolizing freedom and aspiration to lofty ideals. The poet Castro Alves is the great name of this phase, using poetry as a tool for social denunciation and political struggle, highlighting his fight against slavery. Social themes, such as abolitionism, and ideals of justice and freedom gain prominence, reflecting a maturation of national aspirations and a literature committed to social reality. In addition to poetry, romantic prose also develops significantly during this phase, with authors like José de Alencar delving into social, psychological, and identity issues in their works, such as 'Senhora,' which criticizes patriarchal society and the commodification of marriages.\n\nDeepening the theme\n\nDelving into the roots of Romanticism, it is essential to understand how this movement reflected and influenced the social, political, and cultural changes of the 19th century. Romanticism was more than an aesthetic change; it represented a new way of thinking and feeling, aligning with emerging ideals of freedom and nationalism. The fragmentation into different phases in Brazil highlights the evolution of romantic thought and its intrinsic relationship with the country's historical context. The analysis of these phases allows us to understand not only the dynamics specific to literature but also the role of art as an expression of the aspirations of a nation under construction, thus composing a broader picture of Brazilian cultural development.\n\nKey terms\n\nRomanticism: Artistic movement that values emotion, imagination, and nature, contrasting with rationalism and classical rigidity. Indianism: Trend of the first phase of Brazilian Romanticism that idealizes the figure of the Indian as a national symbol. Mal du Siècle: Expression referring to the second phase of Romanticism, characterized by melancholic and introspective themes. Condoreirismo: Current of the third phase of Romanticism, marked by social and political engagement, symbolized by the condor.\n\nPractice\n\nReflection on the theme\n\nConsidering Romantic Literature as a mirror of the human spirit of the time, reflecting on this period is not only delving into the literary universe but also into the very soul of 19th-century society. How did Romanticism weave national identity amidst a period of great political and social transformations? How do issues of freedom, love, and nature interact with contemporary concerns? By investigating the past, we better understand the present and can reflect on how literature influences and is influenced by its context.\n\nIntroductory exercises\n\nIdentify nationalist elements in selected excerpts from 'Iracema' by José de Alencar and explain how they contribute to the construction of a national mythology.\n\nCompare a poem from the 'Mal du Siècle' phase with a poem from the 'Condoreirismo' phase, highlighting thematic and stylistic differences.\n\nDevelop a brief profile of the romantic hero, using as reference the works of national authors from the Romantic period.\n\nDiscuss the role of women in Brazilian Romanticism based on excerpts from 'A Moreninha' by Joaquim Manuel de Macedo and 'Senhora' by José de Alencar.\n\nProjects and Research\n\nCreate a short documentary (5 to 10 minutes) exploring the life and work of one of the great authors of Brazilian Romanticism. Select excerpts from their works that best illustrate the characteristics of the Romanticism phase to which the author belongs. Include interviews with experts, enactments of literary passages, and an analysis of the historical and cultural impact of the selected author's works.\n\nExpanding\n\nExploring the connections between Romantic Literature and other forms of artistic expression of the time, such as music, painting, and theater, can provide a more holistic understanding of this cultural movement. Comparing Brazilian Romanticism with European and other Latin American regions reveals valuable similarities and differences in how romantic ideals were adapted to local realities. Another field of interest is the study of the influence of Romanticism on contemporary literature and how romantic themes and motivations continue to resonate in modern art.\n\nConclusion\n\nConclusions\n\nUpon concluding the immersion in the currents of Romantic Literature in Brazil, a literary mosaic emerges that reflects a country in search of its national identity and expression. This literary movement, by unveiling the emotional powers of the self, charted a path away from rationalism and enabled the expression of subjectivity and idealism. The Brazilian romantic panorama is divided into three distinct phases, each with its uniqueness and contribution to the construction of a genuinely national literature. The first phase, full of heroic and Indianist exaltation, sketches an idyllic Brazil, imbued with its nature and heroic past. The second phase reveals a darker, introspective facet, marked by a painful lyricism that mirrors the disillusionment of poets experiencing the 'Mal du Siècle.' Finally, the third phase, solidified by the abolitionist and social activism of Condoreirismo, elevates literature to a level of social engagement and criticism, culminating in a more complex and diversified literary expression with romantic prose.\n\nThe romantic authors, in their works, amalgamated amorous lyricism with the valorization of the Brazilian territory, engendering a literary representation that allowed the reader to recognize themselves as an integral part of a sovereign and unique nation. José de Alencar, Álvares de Azevedo, Castro Alves, among others, are not just names from a distant literary canon; they represent voices that still echo fundamental questions about the identity, values, and imagery of a Brazil that transitions between reverence for the past and the construction of its future. The different worldviews and relationships established between the individual and society, love and ideal, nature and culture are, to this day, subjects of reflection in the education of young people and adults.\n\nThus, the study of Romanticism does not end on the pages of a textbook or in the margins of an iconic poem; it continues in the continuous reinterpretation of the past, in sensitivity to current dilemmas, and in the inspiration for future artistic expressions. Romanticism is an invitation to look inward, both into the human spirit and collective history, and from this introspective gaze, expand into a broader and more inclusive understanding of literature as an instrument of knowledge and reflection. In essence, the romantic movement bequeaths to scholars and enthusiasts a worldview where sentiment and passion are as vital to understanding reality as reason, and this balance between emotion and intellect is a lasting legacy of the rich literary journey of Romanticism."
