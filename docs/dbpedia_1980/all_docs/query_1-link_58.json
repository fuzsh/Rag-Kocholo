        "text": "Life\n\nJoaquim Manuel de Macedo was born in the city of Itaboraí, in 1820, to Severino de Macedo Carvalho and Benigna Catarina da Conceição. He graduated in Medicine in 1844, and started to practice it in the inlands of Rio. In the same year, he published his romance A Moreninha. In 1849, he founded the magazine Guanabara, along with Manuel de Araújo Porto-Alegre and Gonçalves Dias. In this magazine, many parts of his lengthy poem A Nebulosa were published.\n\nReturning to Rio, he abandoned Medicine and became a teacher of History and Geography at the Colégio Pedro II. He was very linked to the Brazilian Imperial Family, even becoming a tutor for Princess Isabel's children. He was also a provincial deputy and a general deputy, and a member of the Brazilian Historic and Geographic Institute.\n\nDuring his last years of life, he suffered mental disturbances. These made his health worse and led to his death on May 11, 1882.\n\nHe was married to Maria Catarina de Abreu Sodré, a cousin of poet Álvares de Azevedo. Some historians say that the titular character of his novel A Moreninha was based on her.\n\nNovels\n\nA Moreninha (1844)\n\nO Moço Loiro (1845)\n\nOs Dois Amores (1848)\n\nRosa (1849)\n\nVicentina (1853)\n\nO Forasteiro (1855)\n\nOs Romances da Semana (1861)\n\nRio do Quarto (1869)\n\nA Luneta Mágica (1869)\n\nAs Vítimas-algozes (1869)\n\nAs Mulheres de Mantilha (1870 — 1871)\n\nPolitical satires\n\nA Carteira do Meu Tio (1855)\n\nMemórias do Sobrinho do Meu Tio (1867 — 1868)\n\nChronicles\n\nMemórias da Rua do Ouvidor\n\nUm Passeio pela Cidade do Rio de Janeiro\n\nLabirinto\n\nTragedies\n\nO Cego (1845)\n\nCobé (1849)\n\nLusbela (1863)\n\nComedies\n\nO Fantasma Branco (1856)\n\nO Primo da Califórnia (1858)\n\nLuxo e Vaidade (1860)\n\nA Torre em Concurso (1863)\n\nCincinato Quebra-Louças (1873)\n\nPoetry\n\nA Nebulosa (1857)\n\nBiographies\n\nAno Biográfico Brasileiro (1876)\n\nMulheres Célebres (1878)\n\nMedical thesis"
