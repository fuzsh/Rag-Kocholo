Schalk Bezuidenhout is a comedian from South Africa who is a household name in all households that know his name. More specifically, he grew up in Kempton Park in the East Rand. If you don’t know Kempton… it’s the type of place you thank one day in your Oscar speech as your “humble beginnings”.

In Kempton Park the traditional Afrikaans way of living was a good life. You would ride your bicycle to school and English was only used in self defence. Schalk finished school with a distinction for every subject. That has nothing to do with his comedic abilities, he just wanted you to know that.

Schalk’s family and friends stood back as they watched Schalk evolve from an Afrikaans conservative caterpillar into a beautifully dramatic butterfly, complete with a moustache and furry afro. It was obvious to Schalk’s parents that he would study drama, and to help numb the pain they sent him away to study at the University of Cape Town.

While studying in Cape Town Schalk quickly grew dissatisfied with watching Suits on repeat in his single bed (look where Meghan is now, hey?!) His drama degree was still 4 years away, but he needed a creative outlet NOW! So he started doing stand-up comedy in April 2011.

On stage Schalk is fun and energetic and appeals to all.

Schalk has come a far way since his first paid gig in a strip club in Kempton Park (true story). He has had the privilege to perform all over the world in some great venues, alongside some even greater comedians.

On stage Schalk is fun and energetic and appeals to people of all kinds and colours.
