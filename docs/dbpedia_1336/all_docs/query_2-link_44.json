        "text": "2.1 GISAID: A regulated access model of open data governance\n\nThe GISAID Epi-Flu database was launched in 2008, on the anniversary of the Spanish influenza, to foster the sharing of influenza genomic data securely and responsibly. Data sharing was immediately conceptualised not as straightforward ‘opening up’ of the data by placing them online without restrictions to access and re-use, but rather as an alternative to the public sharing model, whereby users agree to authenticate their academic identity and not to republish or link GISAID genomes without permission from the data producer. GISAID acts as a mediator and enforcer of such rules, granting access solely to users who credibly profess to adopt them, and thereby acting as a guarantor for the effectiveness of the sharing agreement entered by data contributors. This arrangement stems from the recognition that some researchers—commonly located in low-resourced environments—are reluctant to share data due to fears of better-equipped researchers building on such work without due acknowledgment (; ). This model proved successful in facilitating better credit attribution to contributing scientists in relation to influenza research and, since its launch, GISAID has played an essential role supporting data sharing among the WHO Collaborating Centers and National influenza Centers in response to the bi-annual influenza vaccine virus recommendations by the WHO Global influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS). It is no surprise, therefore, that GISAID was swiftly redeployed, in early 2020, to include SARS-CoV-2 data through the EpiCov database, which stores, analyses and builds evolutionary trees of SARS CoV-2 genome sequences and hosts several daily updates of visualisations (). GISAID is now the leading open access database for SARS-CoV-2, with over 15 million genomes sequenced by February 2023.The Epi-CoV database provides 11 tools to explore SARS-CoV-2 sequence data; these include Audacity—global phylogeny of hCoV-19 as a downloadable newick tree file; CoVizue—near real-time visualisation of SARS-CoV-2 genetic variation; and a collection of thirty-two analysis figures updated daily.\n\nGISAID has played a key role in supporting the identification and study of variant evolution, lineages and spread in real-time during the first three years of the pandemic; and, at the time of writing, it still features as a key data provider for a wide variety of consortia, initiatives and projects devoted to the analysis of COVID-19 variants of interest (some of which listed on this page: https://gisaid.org/collaborations/enabled-by-hcov-19-data-from-gisaid/). Accordingly, GISAID is funded by a wide consortium of public and private bodies, including the Federal Republic of Germany, who first backed the project at its main site in Geneva, as well as public-health and academic institutions in Argentina, Brazil, China, Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Russia, Senegal, Singapore, South Africa and many other countries, as well as several donors and partners garnered under the label of ‘Friends of GISAID’.\n\nThe GISAID model has fostered information exchange among groups that differ considerably in their geo-political locations, funding levels, material resources and social characteristics, thereby expanding the range of data sources shared online (). At the same time, GISAID has been frequently scrutinised as limiting the extent to which data can be accessed and linked, thereby negatively affecting the insight, pace and breadth of future research—leading to backlash from hundreds of leading researchers concerned about the urgency of an effective pandemic response (). During the height of the pandemic, questions were also raised regarding the quality and integrity of metadata coming from the GISAID platform (), as well as epistemic importance being placed on the lag in submissions times at the global scale (). Some scientists called for a complete opening of genomic data sharing for SARS-CoV-2 (), stating that GISAID’s policy may be ‘open data’, but it does not make the data easily shareable or useable (). These critiques have run alongside controversy around who retains ownership of the data stored in GISAID, and how reliably its governance is actually managed. During past viral outbreaks, GISAID has been involved in legal disputes between the Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics (SIB) over monetary funds of the infrastructure (), events which led to a spokeswoman at GISAID asserting that the SIB had misappropriated the database on grounds of data ownership (). Recent allegations also emerged around GISAID refusing to share data with researchers who, despite complying with its policies, had been critical of them (). Though worth mentioning here given their heated and prominent nature, this paper does not concern itself with these debates, focusing instead on the ways in which GISAID data have been accessed and used.\n\n2.2 INSDC: An unrestricted access model of open data governance\n\nThe fully open model promoted by the International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration (INSDC) has its origins in the first nucleotide sequence database, dating back to the development of the Data Library at the European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL RRID:SCR_004473) in 1982 Heidelberg, Germany. Soon after its development, the database collaborated with GenBank (RRID:SCR_002760) at the Los Alamos Science Laboratory, USA () and finally with the DNA data bank of Japan (DDBJ RRID:SCR_002359) in 1987 (), resulting in what Bernasconi et al. () call a ‘political integration of sequences’.\n\nBy 2002, the governing board of the INSDC had published a data sharing policy which permitted free and unrestricted access to all data in the triad of repositories. The policy makes all data records immediately available to all users, commercial sectors included, without any licensing stipulations, access restrictions, or monetary charges (). Internally, all data shared with either node of the INSDC would be mirrored into the other repositories. The INSDC’s policies of unrestrictive data sharing follow in the steps of the Bermuda Principles of 1996, which established the norm of full and immediate data sharing for genomic information within biology (); at the same time, they precede the institutionalisation of the Open Access Movement in academic publishing and institutes such as Open Data Institute (ODI RRID:SCR_021681), effectively making it an avant-garde institution in the broader context of Open Science ().\n\nAfter four decades of operation, INSDC has displayed a remarkable constancy, with superficial changes largely limited to institutional rebranding. For example, the EMBL Data Library has metamorphosed into the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA RRID:SCR_006515), now under the aegis of the European Bioinformatics Institute in Cambridge Hinxton, while GenBank falls under the purview of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI RRID:SCR_006472) in Bethesda, USA. Amidst the urgency of the COVID-19 pandemic, the INSDC’s well-established data infrastructures offered critical support for data submission, harmonisation, and the ability to publicly access sequence data with a range of new and old tools and portals. For the NCBI, these included: Genebank for annotated sequences of RNA and DNA data; RefSeq for tasks ranging from genome annotations to mutation and polymorphism evaluations, as well as the development of the NCBI virus data dashboard and the NCBI Covid Hub (). Additionally, in April 2020, the European Commission, through the auspices of the European Molecular Biology Laboratory-European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI) and Elixir (a 23-country node network in Europe dedicated to openly sharing life science data), launched another platform for sharing scientific information of relevance to the biological study of COVID-19: the COVID-19 Data Portal (CV19-DP RRID:SCR_018337) (). This data infrastructure hosts a diverse array of genetic, epidemiological, socio-economic and literature data, encouraging data linkage and cross-analysis (). Notably, CV19-DP features a modular design that allows for the rapid development of nation-specific customised interfaces; examples include versions for Spain, Sweden and Poland. However, the primary portal remains the principal access point. One of the overarching aims of CV19-DP is to expedite scientific research by enhancing data interoperability across various bioinformatics platforms, such as ENA, UniProt (RRID:SCR_002380), PDBe (RRID:SCR_004312), EMDB (RRID:SCR_003207), Expression Atlas (RRID:SCR_007989), and Europe PMC (RRID:SCR_005901). To achieve this, the portal deploys a high-level Application Programming Interface (API) and supports direct bulk downloads, ensuring minimal user tracking for transparent and efficient data dissemination.\n\nCV19-DP provides two primary data visualisation tools. The first is an open-source phylogenetic tree that displays COVID-19 sequences, constituting 98% of the reference SARS-CoV-2 genome, including PANGO lineages stratified by World Health Organization (WHO) regions. The second is CoVeo, a proprietary browser that performs systematic analysis of raw sequence data, providing visual and summary analyses for various regions, particularly focused on Variants of Concern (VOCs) and Variants of Interest (VOIs) (). The interface of CV19-DP was later adapted for the Pathogens Hub by the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA), launched in July 2023. This hub is a curated repository founded on the UK’s Health and Safety Executive’s list of approved biological agents, as well as the WHO’s global priority pathogens list. Although other interfaces exist within the INDSC, such as NCBI Virus (RRID:SCR_018253) and the EBI SARS-CoV-2 data hub, the CV19-DP has assumed a significant role. It notably hosted an open letter advocating for the unreserved sharing of SARS-CoV-2 resources and urging submissions to one of the INSDC databases. While the letter did not explicitly name GISAID, it was widely interpreted as a critique of GISAID’s data governance and vision.\n\n2.3 Principles of sound data management\n\nFor CV19-DP, and the rest of the cadre in the INSDC, sound data management is predicated on the FAIR data principles, which espouse the findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability of research data (). This was justified by the ENA with regards to the publication of CV19-DP where they state\n\n…unrestricted access to data plays a critical role in the rapid coronavirus research necessary to respond to this global health crisis…. Ensuring open science and unrestricted international collaborations is of key importance, and it is recognised that these datasets must be shared openly and meet FAIR standards ().\n\nThe FAIR principles are also found on the NCBI Covid-19 Data Submissions page, where they state a benefit of submitting data to them is to ‘follow FAIR data-sharing principles’. The principles of FAIR have been embraced by a number of different research areas; this is demonstrated by the growing body of literature on FAIR data sharing (; ; ; ; ; ) and the cross fertilisation to principles in other scientific practices, such as software (; ; ; ; ). While this framework is designed to promote transparency and data sharing, it remains subject to interpretation and implementation by individual data repositories, with potential variations in compliance and enforcement across different contexts (; ) and a prioritisation of machine readability over human inclusivity ().\n\nGISAID’s approach to sound data management is also arguably compatible with FAIR principles but places a higher premium on regulating data flows and interactions between users and the infrastructure, as exemplified by its database access agreement. The EpiFlu™ Database Access Agreement is a mechanism designed to facilitate the sharing of influenza gene sequence data among researchers and public health professionals worldwide. This agreement outlines the terms under which users may provide data to the database, as well as the rights and obligations of authorised users with respect to that data. In particular, the agreement grants GISAID and authorised users a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free and irrevocable license to use, modify, display, and distribute the data submitted by users for research and intervention development purposes, provided they acknowledge the originating and submitting laboratories as the source of the data. Moreover, the agreement establishes certain restrictions on data access and distribution to ensure that users are acting in the best interests of public health. For example, users are not permitted to access or use the database in connection with any other database related to influenza gene sequences, nor are they allowed to distribute data to any third party other than authorised users. Users are also required to make best efforts to collaborate with representatives of the originating laboratory responsible for obtaining the specimen(s) and involve them in such analyses and further research using such data. Although this agreement is established to promote collaboration between scientists, a recent publication in Science exposed GISAID as having different tiers of access which aren’t defined in the agreement ().\n\nThe differences in the interpretation and implementation of sound data management by GISAID and INDSC illustrate the pluralistic nature of data governance and highlight the need for critical reflection on the normative foundations and ethical implications of data sharing practice. Even though both data infrastructures share common epistemic goals, cognitive-cultural resources, and knowledge forms on complex biological systems, they create distinct digital artifacts as a result of different policies and values (Elliot 2022). A review of metadata by Bernasconi et al. () concludes that, while GISAID’s partially closed model is likely to attract international collaboration from under-resourced countries, it fails to provide features of data provenance such as persistent URLs to samples or publications. The urgency to better understand the epistemic role of these infrastructures—and those to come after it—is underscored by the work of Chen et al. () and Brito et al. (), who identified that countries in lower income groups often lack efficient genomic surveillance capabilities, not due to being able to access the data infrastructure but due to socioeconomic factors, such as inadequate infrastructure, low national GDP and meagre medical funding per capita.\n\nBuilding on prior work on data sharing strategies and understandings of openness between these two systems of data governance (; ), our aim in this paper is to provide an empirical examination of a crucial process of relevant data journeys (), specifically the transfer of SARS-CoV-2 genetic data from the collection stage to the analytical stage. These data movements often cross institutional and international borders, thereby posing challenges to conventional scientific divisions of labour, disciplinary boundaries and epistemic hierarchies. Despite the inherent challenges in identifying and reconstructing these journeys, they present valuable units of analysis for mapping and comparing the diverse practices and circumstances involved in the mobilisation and utilisation of data (; ). At the heart of our inquiry lies the research question of how data infrastructures function as entities that mediate the interplay between data and research practices, thereby affecting the processes and outcomes of data exchange. To answer this, our methodology entails a synthesis of quantitative methods, such as data collection, frequentist statistics, and network analysis, and is informed by critical data studies debates on the governance and inclusivity of data infrastructures (; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ).\n\n4.5 Networks\n\nTable 4 provides a comprehensive network analysis of the various databases, detailing their network characteristics across different types: Authors, Country, Funder, and Institution. A salient observation from the table is the pronounced homogeneity in the funding network across the databases. Specifically, the nodes in this network span from 13 (DDBJ) to 17 (both ENA and NCBI), with GISAID closely trailing at 16. GISAID’s funding ecosystem, with a mean weighted degree of 2289, indicates a potential proclivity of funders towards research utilizing GISAID data. Nonetheless, the elevated clustering coefficient and density metrics for all databases underscore a robust collaboration among funders.\n\nDATABASETYPECLUSTERING COEFFICIENTDENSITYMEAN DEGREEMEAN WEIGHTED DEGREEMAX COMMUNITY SIZEMEAN COMMUNITY SIZEMEDIAN COMMUNITY SIZEMIN COMMUNITY SIZETOTAL COMMUNITIESNUMBER OF EDGESNUMBER OF NODESDDBJAuthors0.960.0116.1317.54101.008.757.002.00246.0017,359.002152.00Country0.420.084.5616.7043.0019.0012.002.003.00130.0057.00Funder0.770.688.1544.1513.0013.0013.0013.001.0053.0013.00Institution0.600.015.245.6071.004.803.002.0087.001095.00418.00ENAAuthors0.990.00246.25252.472987.0011.286.002.006179.008,583,776.0069,717.00Country0.710.2943.549220.42153.00153.00153.00153.001.003331.00153.00Funder0.930.9214.711752.8217.0017.0017.0017.001.00125.0017.00Institution0.900.03221.45242.596395.0068.302.002.00101.00763,790.006898.00GISAIDAuthors0.910.00158.61207.153310.0018.258.002.004679.006,771,757.0085,387.00Country0.650.2640.50823.06159.00159.00159.00159.001.003220.00159.00Funder0.930.9113.632289.0016.0016.0016.0016.001.00109.0016.00Institution0.310.0027.3548.774447.0048.243.002.00125.0082,446.006030.00NCBIAuthors0.970.0057.7361.321088.0010.597.002.007002.002,140,401.0074,155.00Country0.560.1927.31741.80148.00148.00148.00148.001.002021.00148.00Funder0.890.8413.411448.1217.0017.0017.0017.001.00114.0017.00Institution0.300.0024.9832.795956.0049.502.002.00131.0081,002.006485.00\n\nThe country network also exhibited considerable homogeneity, albeit with more distinctive characteristics relative to the funding network. GISAID’s network emerged as the most expansive, boasting 159 nodes and 3220 edges. Most databases trended towards a singular community size, with DDBJ being an outlier with three communities. The apex clustering coefficients and density metrics were identified in the ENA network, registering at 0.71 and 0.29, respectively. The mean degree was highest for ENA at 43.54, while GISAID closely followed with 40.50, and NCBI and DDBJ were relatively lower at 27.31 and 4.56, respectively.\n\nThe institutional network landscape revealed intriguing variances. Notably, the ENA dominated in terms of nodes (6898) and edges (763,790). The subsequent rankings were NCBI and GISAID with 6485 nodes (81,002 edges) and 6030 nodes (82,466 edges), respectively, while DDBJ lagged considerably at 418 nodes and 1095 edges. All databases manifested exceedingly low-density metrics, with ENA leading at 0.3. The clustering coefficients mirrored this trend, with ENA outpacing GISAID and NCBI by a factor of three and DDBJ by two. An interesting revelation was NCBI’s network comprising the largest number of communities at 131, superseding GISAID, ENA and DDBJ, which had 125, 101 and 87 communities, respectively.\n\nThe ‘Authors’ category emerged as the predominant network across databases. GISAID’s network was the most extensive, with 85,387 nodes and 6,771,757 edges. NCBI and ENA followed with 74,155 nodes (2,140,401 edges) and 69,717 nodes (8,583,776 edges), respectively, while DDBJ was significantly smaller with 21,152 nodes and 17,359 edges. Owing to their extremely large size, density metrics were exceedingly low across all databases, with DDBJ being a notable exception. The clustering coefficient was predominantly high, with ENA leading at 0.99, trailed by NCBI and DDBJ at 0.97 and 0.96, respectively. In terms of community counts, NCBI was predominant, with 70,002, followed by ENA, GISAID and DDBJ with 6,179, 4,679 and 246, respectively. The community sizes (mean, median and minimum) across databases exhibited remarkable consistency.\n\nFor the ENA database, in terms of connectivity degree of the network, the leading countries were as follows: the United States (126), the United Kingdom (124), Germany (112), Canada (105), South Africa (103), France (102), India (102), Australia (100), Brazil (97), the Netherlands (96) and China (95). In relation to betweenness centrality, the United States stood out with a score of 758.18. This was followed by the United Kingdom (652.73), France (510.59), Canada (455.33) and South Africa (322.51).\n\nIn the GISAID database, the countries with the highest degrees of connection were the United States (125), the United Kingdom (126), France (109), Germany (108), Brazil (104), Switzerland (103), South Africa (101), Canada (96), Saudi Arabia (95), Japan (94) and Egypt (93). When evaluating betweenness centrality, the leading countries were Senegal (653.05), Sweden (601.17), Italy (561.47), Australia (541.90), Brazil (474.20), Canada (411.64) and Nigeria (377.70).\n\nFor the NCBI database, the foremost countries in terms of degree were the United States (118), the United Kingdom (108), Germany (97), France (86), Italy (83), India (82), Australia (81), China (79), Switzerland (77), Canada (73) and Spain (72). Regarding betweenness centrality, France held the highest score with 708.41, followed by Italy (711.71), South Africa (563.36), the United Kingdom (495.84) and Portugal (469.37). For the DDBJ, the leading countries in terms of degree were Japan (20), United Kingdom (19), United States (19), Italy (11), Sweden (10), Germany (10), Switzerland (10), Israel (9), Australia (9) and Croatia (8). Japan had the leading betweenness centrality score followed by United Kingdom, United States, China, Israel and Australia.\n\nAs shown in Figure 8, the predominant collaboration in the DDBJ network was between Japan and the United States, registering 94 instances, representing a significant majority. Subsequent collaborations included the United Kingdom and the United States (34), Australia and the United States (30), Japan and Norway (14), and Lebanon and the United Kingdom (14).\n\nWithin the ENA database, the largest global reach of country collaboration was recorded, with collaborations involving the United States dominating the top seven positions, collaborating with China (33,298), Germany (22,125), the United Kingdom (20,314), Spain (16,911), Italy (16,750), France (14,899) and Japan (14,371). In the GISAID database, the United States also led country collaborations. But the top collaborative instances were far less: United Kingdom (3,393), Germany (2,745), China (2,021), Canada (1,680), Spain (1,599), Australia (1,373), Japan (862) and India (835). A similar trend was identified in the NCBI database, where the United States featured prominently in the top eight collaborative positions. Collaborative instances included the United Kingdom (3,393), Germany (2,745), China (2,021), Canada (1,680), Spain (1,599), Australia (1,373), Japan (862) and India (835).\n\nIn the analysis of funding networks in Figure 9, the principal funders for GISAID included ICRP, NIH, cOAlitionS, NSF, UKRI, DoD and US Federal funders, exhibiting 15 degrees of connection. Of these, UKRI demonstrated the most significant betweenness centrality. However, when considering the entire network, USDA held the highest betweenness centrality, valued at 57.5, with 12 degrees. The most substantial collaborations were observed between ICRP and US Federal Funders (2166 instances), followed by ICRP-NIH (2094) and NIH-US Federal Funders (2094). Subsequent significant collaborations were identified between cOAlitionS and ICRP (1433), EC & ERC (940), and UKRI (695). Within the NCBI network, the top funders in terms of connection degrees, totalling 16, were IRCP, NIH, cOAlitionS, UKRI and US Federal Funders. In this group, UKRI retained the highest betweenness centrality, registering 32.5. Overall, NOAA exhibited the leading betweenness centrality at 68.67 with 10 degrees. The primary collaborations were between ICRP and US Federal Funders (1755), NIH and US Federal Funders (1723), and ICRP and NIH (1720). Further collaborations included cOAlitionS with ICRP (711), EC & ERC (535) and US Federal Funders (390). For the ENA funding network, the dominant funders in terms of connection degrees, all at 16, were ICRP, NIG, cOAlitionS, AMRC, EC & ERC, NSF, UKRI, HRA, CDC and US Federal Funders. Among these, CDC displayed the highest betweenness centrality at 48.67, but in a broader context, NOAA, with 12 degrees, possessed a greater betweenness centrality of 67. The chief collaborations were with ICRP and US Federal Funders (1374), NIH and US Federal Funders (1317), and ICRP and NIH (1314). This was followed by collaborations involving cOAlitionS and ICRP (1113), EC & ERC (940) and UKRI (740). In the DDBJ network, the US Federal Funders emerged as the primary funding group, reflecting 14 degrees of connection. The maximum betweenness centrality was attributed to NSF, although it only had 10 degrees. Predominant collaborations were discerned between ICRP and US Federal Funders (44), ICRP and NIH (43), and NIH and US Federal Funders (43), followed by CDC and US Federal Funders (24). Additional collaborations involved cOAlitionS and ICRP (23), EC & ERC (19), US Federal Funders (14) and UKRI (12).\n\nIn the institutional network presented in Figure 10, the University of Oxford (826), followed by Imperial College London (668), University of Edinburgh (651), Harvard University (638), the Ministry of Health (596), University of Washington (570), University of Cambridge (537), University College London (504), London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (501) and the Institut Pasteur (462), were the leading nodes for GISAID. In the same network, the University of Oxford again leads in the largest betweenness centrality with 604,373.83, followed by Harvard University, University of Hong Kong, University of Edinburgh and the Ministry of Health with 564,449.4, 478,585.8, 435,489.2 and 405,605.17, respectively. The top five leading collaborations were between the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Centre and the University of Washington (141), KU Leuven and Rega Institute for Medical Research (116), Imperial College London and the University of Oxford (113), Howard Hughes Medical Institute and University of Washington (73), and the Institute of Microbiology and the University of Chinese Academy Science (73).\n\nIn contrast, the ENA platform showcases a broader scope of institutional collaborations. The Sun-Yat Institute (also referred to as Zhongshan University) emerges as the most connected with 2593 degree, followed by the University of Paris (2361), University of Oxford (2031), University College London (1987), Imperial College London (1894), Harvard University (1876), University of Cambridge (1811), University of Edinburgh (1738), Kings College London (1732) and Stanford University (1695). Institutions pivotal in the genesis of ENA, EMBL-EBI, namely the European Bioinformatics Institute and the European Molecular Biology Laboratory, also feature prominently, with the European Bioinformatics Institute receiving 1637 degree and the European Molecular Biology Laboratory with 1542. The leading institutes in terms of betweenness centrality are University College London, University of Oxford, University of Cambridge, Harvard University and Sun Yat with 366,428.6, 363,747.68, 258,835.77, 244,949.02 and 242,804.76, respectively. The leading collaboration between institutes was the British Medical Association and the Canadian Medical Association (80), followed by the University of Cambridge and the Wellcome Sanger Institute (75), Broad Institute and Harvard University (69), Imperial College London and University of Oxford (61) and the European Molecular Biology Laboratory and Heidelberg University (59). The European Molecular Biology Laboratory also had high collaborations with the German Cancer Research Center (51), while the European Bioinformatic Institute had substantial collaborations with the University of Cambridge (45), the Wellcome Sanger Institute (44) and University College London (37).\n\nFor the NCBI, the leading institutions in terms of degree were Harvard University (820), University of Cambridge (693), Wellcome Sanger Institute (498), University of Washington (496), Cornell University (487), Stanford University (477), University College London (476), National Center for Biotechnology Information (475) and the University of Melbourne (453). In terms of betweenness centrality, Harvard University overshadowed the rest with a score of 724,458.49, followed by University of Oxford, University of Melbourne, Imperial College London and the University of California with 519,537.68, 346,122.59, 316,106.06 and 213,986.81, respectively. The leading institutions in terms of collaboration were the BGI Group (China) and the University of Chinese Academy of Science (80), Broad Institute and Harvard University (58), Harvard University and Massachusetts General Hospital (39), Brigham and Women’s Hospital and Harvard University (37), and Broad Institute and Massachusetts Institute of Technology. In the top twenty of collaborations, the NCBI themselves did not appear.\n\nFor the DDBJ, the leading institutes in terms of degree were Harvard University (49), National Institute of Infectious Diseases (48), University of Tokyo (32), Kyoto University (30), Broad Institute (26), Waseda University (24), Hokkaido University (23), Keio University (22), European Bioinformatics Institute (22) and Cornell University (22).
