        "text": "Another suburb I’ve lived in for a number of years…and my husband is a born and bred ‘Bezvallian’ (if there is such a thing). The Valley – as it is fondly known as – lies to the East of the CBD surrounded by Observatory, Bertrams and Kensington. Part of the Doornfontein Farm was sold off to Frederik Jacobus Bezuidenhout in 1861, hence the name. I’m not going into too much of the history of the area as there are too many stories to be told.\n\nI have my favourite spot in the suburb and that’s what I will concentrate on. Siyakhana, a co-operative inner city farm, has to be the best place to visit and purchase organic vegetables. It is situated within Bezuidenhout Park (Observatory Ave.) although it is a little bit confusing to find once you have entered the main gate to the park but hopefully the location is going to be sign posted soon.\n\nIt was started about 13 years ago by Prof. Michael Rudolf as a Wits University initiative to supply fresh fruit and vegetables to NGO’s and as a place for agricultural students to gain some practical experience. However, it is now a Co-Operative with 8 members (still headed by Prof Rudolf ) and the farm is ably managed by Thabang Makoloi.\n\nIt’s always best to go when you have time to walk around the farm to make your choice of produce to be freshly picked, washed and readied for your basket. This will give you the same feeling as been way out in the country.\n\nAlso take time to sit under the peach trees and chat to Sihle, the resident herbalist, who will advise you on what to take for any ailment you may have and how to prepare it. He advised me to crush some oak tree leaves and make a tea from them by boiling them with some water for 15 minutes to cure my restless leg syndrome. I might just give it a try. They also have a large variety of herbs you can purchase after your consultation should you need them.\n\nThere is now a “Park Run” (www.parkrun.co.za) on Saturday mornings at Bezuidenhout Park and this, hopefully, will create more awareness of the Siyakhana Gardens. Also a good opportunity to chat to Sihle should you suffer from running aliments.\n\nOther places of interest in Bezuidenhout Valley are:\n\nMandeville Sports Centre which caters mainly for indoor basketball for the disabled but has many other sporting facilities as well. Situated at 266-7th Avenue, Bezuidenhout Valley."
