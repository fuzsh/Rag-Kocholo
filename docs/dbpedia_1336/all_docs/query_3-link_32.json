        "text": "Comedy docuseries “The World’s Strangest Jobs,” from Johannesburg-based Mannequin Pictures, one of South Africa’s key production, finance, and distribution companies, has sold to Prime Video the rights to the African continent.\n\nMannequin is now pursuing sales in all other territories. The eight-part series is hosted by comedian and actor Schalk Bezuidenhout. The popular South African comic, a household name in his country of birth, balances SAFTA winning acting work (“Hotel”) with his bread and butter as a comic. Most recently, he formed part of Netflix’s stand-up comedy show, “Only Jokes Allowed.”\n\nHis latest follows Bezuidenhout travel the world in search for the titular ‘World’s Strangest Jobs,’ discovering many, from pet detectives in New York to rental boyfriends in Tokyo.\n\n“We’re ecstatic that Prime Video has picked up this original show that will give audiences a front row seat to careers that no one could imagine,” Mannequin CEO, Delon Bakker said.\n\nThe continued push by streamers into the region is no surprise. In a report from Ampere Analysis late last year, which predicted that global streamers could drive 75% growth in sub-Saharan Africa’s subscription video on demand (SVOD) market. With $220 million in annual revenues there for the taking by the end of 2027. The competitive landscape differs from many other parts of the world thanks to Showmax being a serious local competitor to the global streaming platforms.\n\n“The World’s Strangest Jobs” is produced by Delon Bakker and Kyle Ambrose of Mannequin Pictures. The company recently wrapped production on theatrical “London Calling,” helmed by Allan Unger (“Bandit”), starring Josh Duhamel (“Transformers”) and Rick Hoffman (“Suits”).\n\nThe Highland Film Group is handling international sales on “London Calling.”"
