        "text": "Your hands can‚Äôt Hit what your eyes can‚Äôt see. Mike tyson was right , thesame goes with the Toes and Nose philosophy which says ‚Äú Na where nose face, leg dey waka dey go ‚ÄúüòÄ Which means your toes only moves in the direction of your nose. Some of the critical functions of the nose is discernment, perception and receptivity which allows air navigate our mortal estate. Societies began experimenting with canines in law enforcement as early as 1870 in England, followed by #Paris in 1910. New York introduced canines in patrol units in 1907. And, #America institutionalized the practice in 1954. All because of the delicate and heightened capacity of canine to discern, perceive and if well trained sense danger Like canines trained to sniff out stuffs. We must train our sense of discernment and perception to see the good in every opportunity, every situation and channel that good sense through our mind and mortal estate. There‚Äôs something good about every bad person or situation and something bad about every good person or situation. It‚Äôs true, Start looking for the good in whatever situation you find yourself right now and let it fuel your energy, desire and craving for success, significance and relevance. There‚Äôs no such thing as perfect timing when it concerns our personal development, rather we orchestrate the outcomes of our lives by our senses of discerned opportunities, perceived threat, and feelings of comfort. Many years ago, someone told me. ‚ÄúSatisfaction is the mother of all limitations ‚Äú Once you‚Äôre satisfied, you run less and want to sleep in all day and bask in the sunshine of accomplishment. A sense of satisfaction will impede your discerning perceptors in mundane traditions and patterns that makes it hard to compete with new technology and innovation that voraciously gobbles the market share of influence,relevance and your anticipated success. Guys, let‚Äôs sniff out new opportunities and better ways of living this life. Let‚Äôs do more in 2024 Let‚Äôs challenge ourselves to be and do better Let‚Äôs share any and every resource that will help the next guy advance thier course. Look out for the good in every situation because you only live once. #inspirationalwords #entrepreneurjourney #leadershipcommunications #amazon #leadershipdevelopment #blackhistorymonth #blackbusiness #blacklivesmatter #excellence\n\n‚ÄúMcNamara Fallacy‚Äù Who is McNamara? Robert McNamara, a Harvard graduate, first president of Ford motors from outside the Ford family, US secretary of defense during Kennedy administration, known for his reliance on numbers and metrics to solve problems What is McNamara Fallacy? The McNamara fallacy refers to the tendency to focus on numbers, metrics, and quantifiable data while disregarding the meaningful qualitative aspects. His role in Vietnam war As US secretary of defense, the main metric he used to determine success was body count. However, this approach failed as he was blindsided by human behavior and the chaos and destruction of war. Essentially, body count is a poor measure of how a war is progressing, ignoring the mood of the public, territory gained, and strategic progress etc. In a nutshell, the McNamara fallacy is when a decision is based solely on numbers (e.g. metrics or statistics) and all qualitative factors are ignored. Doing this makes us blind to what is really going on. and it applies to many more situations, other than war‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..\n\nWe can all win. There is a term and definition that I learned years ago but truly felt in Arizona as a business owner. That is Crab in the Barrel Syndrome (CBS)‚Äîa metaphor used to describe the mentality and behaviors of individuals belonging to or identifying with a particular community or culture who 'hold each other back' from various opportunities for advancement and achievement despite incentives. Instead of constantly informing one another of the term, how about we do something about it? It‚Äôs not hard to step outside of yourself and support someone else. It‚Äôs not hard to speak someone else‚Äôs name in a positive light because we have no problem speaking in the negative light. In order to break the curse, we must move in the direction that will not hold us stagnant. When we realize that we are all on a path to greatness, there will be no need to step on each other to get to the top. So, here is me letting everyone know that the barrel is huge, and I‚Äôm willing to turn around and help each of us climb to the top. That‚Äôs how we all win. I am Shante Saulsberry. #CommunitySupport #BlackBusinesses #TogetherWeRise #BreakingBarriers #SupportLocal\n\nSometimes in life, we experience situations that lead us to backbite and seek revenge. There are other times when we want to take the high road. Where do you normally find yourself during these challenging times? I‚Äôve learned over my decades on this earth that the high road pays more dividends than revenge. When I think about Will Smith and Chris Rock‚Äôs situation, I believe that a classier, \"high-road\" approach by Will would‚Äôve been a much better response to Chris‚Äô comments. We saw the immediate negative repercussions of his actions. If Will had restrained himself, spoken to Chris after the awards show, and shared his feelings, we would have witnessed a better outcome. Chris chose the high road and kept his composure on stage. This is nowhere near easy. Everyone is different and repressed issues of the past can drive you to do things you wouldn‚Äôt normally do. We‚Äôre humans, and we have feelings. We like instant gratification, immediate justice, and taking matters into our own hands. However, I‚Äôve learned by doing it the wrong way so many times, that taking the high road and doing the right thing will ALWAYS reap more benefits. Develop the strength to let certain things roll off your shoulders. In doing so, remind yourself that you are not someone‚Äôs doormat. You are not weak. You are not feeble-minded. You are not a coward. You are stronger than ever! In the words of the illustrious Michelle Obama, \"When they go low, we go high.\" #FamilyFirstLife #FFL #Tristate #integrity #Lifelessons\n\nSeattle went to bed yesterday evening awash with purple, celebrating the epic win by our UW Huskies last night! They showed us exactly what \"Bending Not Breaking\" means, both on the gridiron and in the business world. Just like in any tough campaign, the Huskies faced adversity: last minute injuries stopping the clock, late penalties, and a focused opponent. But instead of crumbling, they adapted, adjusted, and made an incredible play with :01 on the clock. They bent, but they never broke. This is a crucial lesson for us all: Embrace the unexpected: Not every plan goes perfectly, and that's okay. Be flexible and adapt to challenges. Stay relentless: Even when things get tough, keep pushing forward. Persistence always pays off. Work together: Teamwork makes the dream work, on the field and in the office. Celebrate wins and support each other through setbacks. Believe in yourself: The Huskies knew they had it in them, and so do you. Confidence is key to achieving your goals. So, let's channel the Husky spirit this week! Let's bend the challenges thrown our way and dominate our professional goals. Go Dawgs!"
