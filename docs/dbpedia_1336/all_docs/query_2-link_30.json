        "text": "Today marks the start of Women‚Äôs month in South Africa‚ö°Ô∏è Here's a list of practical ways to support women: 1. Give women credit, where credit is due. 2. Equal pay for equal work. 3. Go out of your way to support women owned business. 4. Share on socials/ share to friends a women owned business. Make funding opportunities easier, invest in women's business. 5. Make an important introduction to women in business. Share a letter of reference, put forward a woman‚Äôs name for an opportunity. 6. Speak out against injustice you are aware of in the work place and/or in your personal life. 7. Mentor a girl/woman in your life. Empowerment looks different for every woman. 8. Pass the mic to women. Listen to us when we speak, we have a voice - we just need to be heard. 9. Support NGO‚Äôs focusing on gender based violence and empowering woman. Give of your time/money or both. 10. Celebrate women, not just in women‚Äôs month. As a woman, remember that one woman‚Äôs win does not equate to your loss - we are working together to achieve a more equal world for all. Small, practical changes are the way to go - get deliberate and get going. We can all try do somethingüíñ What are you actively doing to make equality a reality? I would love to hear your practical tips! Please do share this post if you think it is helpful #womensmonth #support #female #entrepreneurship #invest [A funny quote I love from Future Females Instagram page by Maya Elious. Some of the above tips are inspired by Olwethu Leshabane]\n\nThe past three months working full time at the Education Outreach Foundation has been an oxymoron in the truest sense, devastating yet so valuable. The focus has been to learn, to listen and to understand. One should never assume what is the best solution for a community and we continue to remain committed to this notion. We‚Äôve met with Executive Directors of other non-profits, teachers, government officials, learners, volunteers, Chancellors of universities and parents. I‚Äôve researched and researched, I‚Äôve joined forums and gone into communities. As passionate as I am about this work, it has also come with many hidden challenges too. Once again, Paul Pretorius (our co-founder) and I have been reminded of the tragic reality that quality education (never-mind access to digital education) is not accessible to the vast majority of learners in this country. It is a silent crisis, a story that needs to be told and acted upon. As we enter the next phase of building, we will continue to learn, to engage, to strategise, to fundraise, to collaborate. We will now begin to share, being conscious of what is appropriate for social media and what isn‚Äôt, with an effort to be vulnerable, to build connection, to get insights and to continue to learn. Please support us in our journey, a simple follow of the Education Outreach Foundation, a share, an introduction or small donation goes so much further than you know. For ‚Äúit is better to light one candle than to curse the darkness‚Äùüíõ [The necessary consent granted for all photos] #building #nonprofit #learning #education #digital #socialimpact\n\n\"Networking is the number one unwritten rule of success in business\" Yet several barriers limit women from gaining the courage to network: discomfort with networking, limited knowledge sharing among women and a lack of intentional women-created networking spaces etc. Historically, women had to compete for positions to excel, making networking with other women less common. But times have changed, and so must the narrative - ALL women can excel together. Sarah Waller and I are building Socially Gathering with a clear vision: to be South Africa's best female networking platform. To achieve this, our mission is two-fold: the first is to create a space for women to form female adult friendships and secondly to build a community for females to do business, support each other and network. We've been overwhelmed by the response on our other socials, our events and our curated community groups, proving how needed this community is. Hence, the creation of our LinkedIn page. Please join us in our vision and mission, join us on socials or at our in person events in JHB and CT below - here is the link for our dinner club series: https://lnkd.in/dAKf5W_m https://lnkd.in/dSUci8JP Watch this space for more events with the JSE, Africa Padel and and and üëÄ #female #networking #excellence #vision #community #intention\n\nI got to meet one of my female inspirations and it was a direct result of giving another inspiring female her flowers !!! A few months ago I reached out to Mbali Shongwe on Instagram. I really admired her commitment to her work and asked if she would be willing to chat - we met up and connected over our passion for impact. A few months later, she invited me to attend the Innaugral Mail and Guardian Youth Summit with her. A motivational day filled with great speakers and meaningful sessions. We often forget that just by turning to the person next to us and having a conversation, you can meet such incredible humans and it can reap so many learnings. I was elated when I caught news that Bonang Matheba was a panelist. I had followed this woman‚Äôs career for years. Her tenacity to her dreams had always drawn me to her. Best believe as the session ended I headed to chat to her! I expressed my continued awe of her dedication. I also told her the story how I spoke about her so much that when I was at university, a friend turned to me and said (not knowing Bonang is an international celebrity) I should invite my friend for lunch. Bonang and I shared a good laugh and she then insisted I invite her for lunch. Invite pending haha ‚Ä¶ The universe keeps reminding me how being enthusiastic and supportive of others in their dreams will never take away from your own. If anything, it fosters a community of collaboration! Give people their flowers whilst you still can - kind words and kind actions might be the small things but it can can be a big deal for someone in that moment üß° #celebrateothers #networking #inspiring\n\nLast week I attended my 10 year reunion at St Henry's Marist College. The visit reminded me of: The importance of vulnerability. The importance of representation. On the Friday, the school hosted an alumni assembly where the alumni have the opportunity to say a few words. I was asked if I wanted to speak and I respectfully declined. A friend of mine made a joke in passing how they are going to ask me to speak anyways, slightly confused by the joke I went to confirm with the chairman that my name was not down to speak. He replied \"It is not, but if you don't speak, there will only be Old Boys speaking and no Old Girls\". Well, he struck a cord and I quickly proceeded to change my mind to say a few words. As I got up, I felt a massive wave of emotion come over me and I had to hold back the tears. I choose to share a personal story with the entire school why I had not come back to the school in 9 years. Nine years ago, I stood at the stop of the amphitheatre stairs and had to tell my younger brother that my Dad had passed away. It was one of the hardest moments of my life and one of the main reasons I had not come back to the school through the fear to have to relive the pain (the notion that the body keeps the score). But speaking my truth and then standing at the top of the same stairs again became so liberating. Time really does heal. Through the course of the next two days, I had other alumni share their personal stories of their losses with me and other stories of why they had not come back to school. I also had several young school girls come up to me to share kind and encouraging words. Two of girls (maybe about 12 years old) made me smile when they said hello and then proceeded to tell me they were going to be \"the most successful women alumni when they come back\". Vulnerability builds connection. Representation matters. #representation #school #vulnerability #speakyourtruth [Pictured with the first team Netball girls in the amphitheatre after handing out their kits]\n\nüáøüá¶‚ÄùIf our activism stops at the polls, we really need to consider if it is just the government that needs to deliver.‚Äù ‚úÖ Voting is a key component of democracy, but do not let it be the only component. Being an active citizen requires introspection: ‚Äúwhat can I do, where I am, with what I have, to bring this country closer to where I would like to see it?‚Äù. We can all do something, no matter how small! üìçYesterday, I was proud to be part of the team of observers at the Ground Work Collective NPO. It was my first time as an observer and I learnt a lot about the law, the importance of observing and more so about the behind the scenes work that goes into making the elections run efficiently and to ensure they are free and fair. üëè I met an array of individuals working/volunteering their time to upholding their civic duty (inspiring to say the least). Whilst the day brought its challenges, everyone worked together to get the day operating as smoothly as possible. I saw how quite literally, small actions by kind individuals helped people get their votes in and how change could thus result. ‚ù§Ô∏è South African‚Äôs repeatedly prove their resilience and witnessing how people qued for hours to make their mark, emphasises that commitment and resilience once more. Regardless of the outcome, I hope we continue to show up, actioning on this democracy - I am committed to playing my part. üó≥Ô∏è Your vote is your voice, but don‚Äôt let it stop there. #elections #volunteer #civicduty #groundworkcollective #southafrica\n\nStatistics South Africa recently confirmed that the unemployment rate in the country currently sits at 32,9%. The challenging landscape in finding a job in South Africa is a narrative not often spoken about amidst the celebrations and excitement of content on a platform such as LinkedIn, but the devastating reality effects so many individuals in the country. Social media can be such a powerful tool and if used with intention can be life changing - from my own experience, LinkedIn helped me secure my new role. Whilst traditional networking and putting yourself out there to find a new job is crucial, following pages that share valuable content is also important. As someone who recently did a pivot from law to social impact (and who did months of scrolling this platform), I found it extremely helpful to follow individuals and pages that share opportunities in social impact, so here is a list of some of the incredible pages: afrorama - describes themselves as \"an accessible and representative web-based encyclopedia of Africa.\" They share helpful job boards regularly. Opportunity Desk - the largest digital media platform that bridges the gap to education by sharing information on relevant learning and growth opportunities for youth around the world. They share jobs, to scholarships and various funding opportunities. Youth Opportunities / Opportunities for Youth - two amazing platforms focused on great opportunities for youth across the world. Lucille Onyango üá∞üá™/ Nick Martin / Mandy Van Deven / Patrick Chandiga Justine - all individuals I came across in my job search that share daily opportunities in social impact. Justice Funds - a resource that shares a collection of funding opportunites for the Global South. Global South Opportunities - a platform centred around bridging the people of the Global South to authentic and verified life changing global opportunities. Paula Reisdorf - Paula prepares the \"Corporate Accountability Job Board\" sharing remote and continent specific jobs. This weekly newsletter shares insights on NGO's, unions and journalism. Farai Ntuli - this woman deserves a post on her own, not only is she my mentor but also a guiding light to so many young women. She often shares CV tips, job opportunities and tools to excel as a young professional. She also shares jobs in South Africa on her Instagram page where she posts \"Opportunity Tuesdays\" and I know many have benefited from this information sharing. I hope this list can help you or someone you know, so share it with anyone you think could benefit! Any others you would add to this list? #newjob #opportunity #socialimpact #globalopportunities #southafrica\n\nWhen I was 12, I wrote the below article. It might be naive, nerdy and innocent but the theme of the article still rings through to my life today - ‚Äúservice to humanity is the best work of life‚Äù. Service can be understood in many different shapes or forms and if my sabbatical gave me clarity on anything for my career, it was that I wanted to serve and I wanted to serve in South Africa. I believe that everything in life brings you to exactly where you are meant to be - a marriage of your choices, hard work, luck, coincidence and timing. This next chapter of my career poses no different entering a new role in service that is quite literally my dream role on paper. Advocate Paul Pretorius and I will be working on building an education NPO with a single focus of making education more accessible to learners who previously would not have had such access. Whilst his reputation speaks for itself, Paul is integrity defined, a wealth of knowledge and beyond humble (whilst he does not use LinkedIn, a quick google search will boast his incredible career trajectory in public service) and I am so grateful to partner, learn and work with someone of his caliber. Most importantly, he has an incredible passion for this country and a deep concern about the state of education in the country. In my role as Executive Director, I will be building the Education Outreach Foundation from the ground up and to say I am grateful, excited, fear filled and nervous is an understatement. But life is too short to be doing anything other that what fuels your fire! I also wanted to take this opportunity to open my inbox to existing NPO's/startup's in education, people who have always wanted to serve, potential funders introductions or anyone who is open to provide guidance. It is estimated over R 1 billion has been spent by NGO's on education annually since 1994, it is most alarming to think what that the state of SA‚Äôs education without the work of these NGO‚Äôs. We do not want to reinvent the wheel but work in collaboration with others, because working together is well, better. The fact that a young boy or girl should, by accident of birth, have to look over their shoulder at the idea of good schooling with regret and loss of opportunity is approaching the criminal. We might be crazy, but we are committed and we hope you will search your heart, make a change and join us in making our vision a reality. #newjob #education #nonprofit #dream #workingtogether #southafrica"
