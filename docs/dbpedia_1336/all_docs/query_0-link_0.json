        "text": "Bezuidenhout History, Family Crest & Coats of Arms\n\nOrigins Available:\n\nNetherlands\n\nThe distinguished surname Bezuidenhout is Dutch in origin. It is derived from the Dutch words \"zuid,\" meaning \"south,\" and \"hout,\" meaning \"forest,\" and once denoted a region south of the Hague forest. The name was probably first borne by a resident of this region or, alternatively, by someone living south of a prominent forest.\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly Origins of the Bezuidenhout family\n\nThe surname Bezuidenhout was first found in Holland, where the name is thought to have emerged. Dutch surnames were not borne by the common classes until 1811, when they were made obligatory by Napoleon; as records of the name Bezuidenhout extend back to the 17th century, it can be assumed that the family was one of status.\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly History of the Bezuidenhout family\n\nThis web page shows only a small excerpt of our Bezuidenhout research.
