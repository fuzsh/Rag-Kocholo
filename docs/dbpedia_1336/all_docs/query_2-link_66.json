        "text": "June 18, 2011\n\nI never believed I could understand the complicated, bloody, perplexing history of South Africa. Leave it to Michener to prove me wrong. This was published in 1980. I wish Jimmy was still around to provide a follow-up from 1980 to the present.\n\n1235 pages! And it only took me 8 1/2 weeks. This is my big accomplishment for the year. It may even be the longest book I've ever read. If I don't get through anything else on my 2011 challenge shelf, that will be okay.\n\nMay 2, 2021\n\nThis is great if you enjoy James Michener's books. His style reads and flows almost like a history textbook but is filled with characters and events that add to the overall narrative. This one was similar to 'Alaska' because the plot starts out in prehistoric South Africa and gradually moves into the 20th century. What makes it unique is the narrative has characters with dialogue, interaction, and continual transitions into the future. The books follows prehistoric man, the history of the various people of South Africa, gradual colonization of the Dutch, the Trekboers and Afrikaners, tensions and wars (the Zulu and the Bantu, the Boer Wars), and leads up to the Apartheid of the 1900s.\n\nOne aspect of the book I thought was neat was the title of the book, ‘The Covenant.’ The title comes from how a Dutch family took it upon themselves to keep a covenant with God. They viewed themselves as 'New Israelites' and were obligated to make a covenant the God in order to obtain redemption. The narrative is on page 190-1:\n\n“God had led the Israelites through such dark periods and He would the Dutchmen.\n\nThis is my covenant, which ye shall keep, between me and you and thy seed after thee; Every man child among you shall be circumcised...He that is born in thy house, and he that is bought with thy money, must needs be circumcised: and my covenant shall be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant.\n\n- Genesis 17:11, 13\n\nAnd Abraham took Ishmael his son, and all that were born in his house, and all that were bought with his money, every male among the men of Abraham's house; and circumcised the flesh of their foreskin in the selfsame day, as God had said unto him.\n\n- Genesis 17:23\n\nAnd our covenant is baptism!\"\n\nThis book had a lot of information and I learned quite a bit. I would recommend it to someone who has interest in South Africa and wishes to learn more. Thanks!\n\nOctober 17, 2007\n\nMy favorite Michener. The story behind South Africa. And when I say behind, that is truly Michener's style. He starts with the beginning of time, how the earth was formed, the first people to populate the area, and on to the present day. An incredible amount of information, but entertaining to read as he masterfully follows several families whose lives cross again and again over centuries.\n\nSeptember 4, 2021\n\nI first read The Covenant nearly twenty years ago. The book was recommended to me by a South African associate when I mentioned that I was traveling to South Africa for an upcoming vacation. At the time, apartheid had already died a surprisingly peaceful death and Nelson Mandela had completed a relatively quiet and apparently successful five years in office as the first president of a new government. At the time, I took the book very superficially. After all, the entire content of The Covenant had happened in the past.\n\nWith this second reading, some twenty years later, my older mind was awed by the mountain of South African history that parallels that of the United States. Both nations overran and subjugated their native inhabitants, both nations established governments that placed power exclusively in the hands of their colonists, and both governments codified their beliefs in white supremacy.\n\nThe laws in effect in both nations were similar in their desire to repress those with non-white backgrounds. The difference was that South Africa needed to be more draconian. South Africa was repressing a majority of its people while the United States focused on a minority. In both cases, however, the beliefs that drove these injustices were fueled by greed, self-serving religious interpretations, and peer-based circular reasoning.\n\nIn 1994, more than a decade after the story in The Covenant ends, reality landed in the lap of the white South African government. And to its credit, their leaders cooperated with the majority of South Africans to bring about a peaceful end to their institutional racism. Some may argue that the US did the same thing much earlier. However, the reality is that freedoms in the US allowed for the circumvention of laws by pushing minority repression underground. Racially discriminatory laws were transformed into racially biased unwritten codes of conduct that still permeate US society today.\n\nIn continuing with the parallels between the two countries, the most alarming aspect of this book is the process that the South African minority used to enact their racial agenda. As white Americans slowly diminish into a new minority, their actions look very much like those of the South African minority of the past. They are using the constructs of government to secure power including gerrymandering control of state legislatures and congressional districts, passing laws aimed at disenfranchising non-white voters, and electing nationalists leaders who display a obvious racial favoritism towards the emerging white minority.\n\nSouth Africa could serve as a tangible model for the new white minority in the US to gain control of the nation. And even more concerning is that the government of the United States still possesses a built in favoritism towards the rural states where most of the new minority reside; a favoritism that is not unlike the one that existed in South Africa prior to 1994.\n\nThe Covenant, as a work of historical fiction, is very long (like this review). However, the long detailed history imparted by Michener all leads up to the book’s ending at the zenith of apartheid and the beginnings of its downfall. The book gives the reader a true sense of the beliefs and fallacies that were fermented and reaffirmed over centuries in the minds of the Afrikaners who ended up governing the nation, and leaves no room for speculation as to why apartheid came into being.\n\nDecember 8, 2014\n\nThis is a difficult book to review. As with all Michener books, it is well researched and written.\n\nAnytime I recommend one of his books, I must verify that the intended reader loves history, loves reading, and is willing to hunker down and delve through slow stories to enjoy the incredible wealth of knowledge that can be gained from his stories. The covenant is no different. To read this story takes a level of patience and desire that most books, even most historical novels, do not require.\n\nThat being said, of all the Michener books I have read, I think this may be his finest, especially in terms of how he describes the mindset and motivations of the various groups.\n\nMany of the characters are so unlikable or belligerent that you want to shake some 21st century sense into them, but that's easy to say from my couch in Miami.\n\nThis is certainly a study on how NOT to develop and run a diverse, fair society, but that's kind of the point.\n\nIt really is too bad that we don't get to see this story through to the end of apartheid; however, if this had been written in 2014 there would undoubtably be future history that readers a hundred years from now would lament not being being included.\n\nAugust 4, 2012\n\nI promised myself when I considered writing a review of this gigantic tome ...\n\nWoah there buddy, isn't it a little redundant to be calling a tome gigantic? If it's a tome it is gigantic by its very definition, or are you saying that it's especially large, even for a tome?\n\nAlright, so when I was considering writing a review of this tome, I made a promise to myself not to use the word epic.\n\nNewsflash, genius, you are writing a review and you just used the word epic. Mission failed, promise to self broken (you suck).\n\n... Anyway, I did not want to use the word epic to describe this novel, but I realized that there isn't another word that would describe it adequately.\n\nOh look, I have a thesaurus. Check it out: Inflated, grandiose, gargantuan, monumental, towering, gigantic, Brobdingnagian ...\n\nSooo, this is a big book and if you're not interested in South African history, it might not be something you want to read.\n\nDurrr, hey I'm not interested in reading about South African history, I think I'll read this monstrous (thank you, thesaurus) Michener book that focuses entirely on South Africa. IS ANYONE THAT STUPID?\n\nYes, as a matter of fact ...\n\nBut do you think that anyone reading your review is that stupid?\n\nOf course not, they're obviously individuals of highly evolved taste and intelligence. I just thought that maybe they don't know what the book is about.\n\nDo you honestly believe that someone interested in this book went to YOUR review first? Like, oh hey, I'm just going to read this random review by a dude I don't know rather than reading the BLURB THAT IS RIGHT BESIDE THE BLOODY BOOK.\n\nYou may have a point.\n\nYou're dern right I have a point, you soft-headed cheese eater.\n\nCheese eater?\n\nYou don't eat cheese?\n\nI do, but it's a rather weak insult.\n\nWhatever\n\nAnyway, this book is a long read, but it's well worth the time invested. In my opinion, this is Michener's best.\n\nHave you read every Michener book?\n\nNo.\n\nThen how can you say that? What if his best book is \"Mexico\"?\n\nIt isn't.\n\nListen, you lumpy-headed simpleton, can you guarantee beyond all doubt that one of the many Michener books that you haven't read isn't his best?\n\nNo, but ...\n\nThen your opinion isn't worth much, is it?\n\nFine. I just thought this was a really good book and, having read a sizable selection of Michener's works, I have a hard time imagining a better one.\n\nOh, so we're to be held hostage, as review readers, by the limits of your poverty-stricken imagination?\n\nFine. This is an excellent book, that's all I'm saying.\n\nI think what the reviewer is trying to say, for any readers who have made it this far, is that you should probably read another review if you want any actual meaningful analysis of this book\n\nShut up.\n\nNovember 7, 2012\n\nJames Michener's epic book on South-Africa. It tells the story of that land from the early settlements by the Dutch, through the expansion of it by English immigrants and others, to the South-Africa of the Apartheid age, shortly before it was eliminated.\n\nThe tumultuous and violent history of South-Africe is told with Michener's careful research and adherence to detail. The people and their struggles and the values that drove them enrich the story and add the personal touch to the sweeping changes around them.\n\nIt is a tragic story of slavery, struggles against elements, racism, war, and love. There are many characters in this novel, as it spans hundreds of years.\n\nYou will read about Cecil Rhodes, the rise of the Zulu Empire, the Boer wars and the concentration camps that the British erected during that war.\n\nIt also provides a good look at the evil of Apartheid, how it was established, and how many whites in the country knew it could not last.\n\nAs with many Michener books, you learn something as you enjoy the great story. This was a fantastic read.\n\nOctober 10, 2018\n\nI admit, I am a Michener fanatic! I read this book when it first came out and so much of it just stuck with me over the years that I decided to reread it. First of all, 1240 pages! Wow, wow, wow!!! Michener crams this book with outstanding usage of the history of the county and then blend his fictitious families to be part of those events. Did a ton of fact-checking as I went along and he was spot on with his history - having the internet made it easy for me to do this. He allows us to see Africa through the eyes of competing groups that live and settled there from the Hottentots to the Xhosa to the Dutch and English, and we get to understand some of the reasoning behind the Boer (Dutch farmer) War and eventual domination of the country. By the end, he ably points out the mistakes of the Boers and their use of Apartheid to control and dominate a group of people and a country. Obviously, the book was written before that institution was torn down, and I am certain that Michener would have loved to have been able to add a few chapters to help analyze how that happened and what has happened to South Africa since that time. But, this is one fantastic effort and was done in his most productive years when he was writing Chesapeake, Centennial, & Texas. Well worth the time and effort to read this wonderful historical fiction novel. He is the best of the genre without a doubt!\n\nJuly 1, 2017\n\ntl;dr - Read the book, don't listen to the audio\n\nI listened to the Audiobook (if you can even call it that).\n\nIt is actually a 1993 tape recording with a monotonous narrator that cannot pronounce a single word related to the Dutch, Afrikaners, Xhosa, Zulu.\n\nBeing about 60 hours of audio, it gets a bit tedious being told to reverse, or turn the tape around every 30 minutes.\n\nAnd if the narrator wasn't bad enough on his own, you had this static (sea shell) type background throughout the whole book.\n\nI truly cannot fathom why there was no effort made to re-record Michener's books.\n\nWith that out of the way. The book was so good, that I ended up ignoring all the narration complaints and spend a month listening to the history of South Africa.\n\nI've never cared much for knowing my history very well.\n\nBut was recommended the author by a friend, and figured that if i'm going to engage in the history of any country, it might as well be my own.\n\nAnd I'm not sorry at all.\n\nAt the back of this book, I'm actually quite angry that history doesn't get taught in this type of format at school level. I probably don't know a single person that enjoyed history at school. But being taught in a novel format with relatable characters, I couldn't stop listening and I can recall most of the history with relative accuracy of more or less which years that happened.\n\nThe book hit quite close to home. Being an Afrikaner, raised in the Dutch Reformed church, born at the time this book was written. It was in the time when things weren't going that well in South Africa, as the book accurately depicts. And only now do I have a full picture of what lead up was to the different phases of South Africa's evolution.\n\nThis book won't be for everyone. You either need to be a big lover of history, or have a direct correlation to the history of South Africa. Whether that is through the Dutch, the Afrikaner, the Coloureds, the Hottentots, the Huguenots, the English, the Xhosa, the Zulu (or even the German and Indian settlers sent from London).\n\nThe story is very much told from each culture's own perspective. Giving a solid understanding of what the differences/misunderstandings were and why. Having the full parallel history through the centuries to see why certain events happened. The main thread also makes the same families lives cross again and again over the centuries.\n\nThe second half of the book does slow down the pace quite a bit. And I suspect it might be due to the grim nature of the content. Going into the Zulu war, then the English war, then apartheid.\n\nTo summarize the major events/eras I got out of this book:\n\n- Bushmen running into the blacks\n\n- Merchants from Zimbabwe exploring Africa for Rhino horn and gold\n\n- Blacks moving up in Africa to Zimbabwe whom were far advanced in the time\n\n- Travel / Trade between Java, the Spice Islands and the Asian countries\n\n- Dutch travel between Amsterdam and Java having to stop in Cape Town\n\n- Settling in Cape Town to have food/drink for the Dutch travellers\n\n- Dutch exploring/moving into Africa and encounters with the locals\n\n- The start of wine making in South Africa\n\n- The Trek Boers and their beliefs\n\n- Xhosa war\n\n- Zulu war\n\n- British colonisation and war\n\n- Cecil Rhodes and mining\n\n- Jan Smuts with and then against all the other Generals (Piet Retief, de la Rey,\n\n- Paul Kruger\n\n- Apartheid\n\n- Diamonds\n\n- To the point of sending Mandela to Robben Island\n\n- All of which highly centres around religious beliefs\n\nThere were certain fascinating facts:\n\nThe German influence coming to South Africa as part of the Dutch colonisation as free burghers forming part of the Calvinist Reformed Church of the Netherlands.\n\nLike why there are Indians in Natal.\n\nTo quote some history:\n\nIndian slaves from the Dutch colonies had been introduced into the Cape area of South Africa by the Dutch settlers in 1654. By 1860, with slavery having been abolished in 1834, and after the annexation of Natal as a British colony in 1843, the British colonialists in Natal (now kwaZulu-Natal) turned to India to resolve a labour shortage. Men of the local Zulu warrior nation were refusing to adopt the servile position of labourers. In that year, the SS Truro arrived in Durban harbour with over 300 Indians on board. Over the next 50 years, 150,000 more indentured Indian servants and labourers arrived, as well as numerous free \"passenger Indians\", building the base for what would become the largest Indian community outside India. By 1893, when the lawyer and social activist Mahatma Gandhi arrived in Durban, Indians outnumbered whites in Natal. The civil rights struggle of Gandhi's Natal Indian Congress failed; until the 1994 advent of democracy, Indians in South Africa were subject to most of the discriminatory laws that applied to all non-white inhabitants of the country.\n\nIt is pretty hard to summarize/review a book of such epic proportion.\n\nI definitely want to read more Michener. I probably just need to give myself a year or so to attempt another audio version.\n\nAugust 17, 2007\n\nA bible of a book - both in terms of size and contents - that retells the history of South Africa through the stories of both fictitous and historic characters. A truly ambitious endeavour in true Michener style, which had a profound effect on me when I read it at the age of 16 - and still does! The book ends in the 1980s, and I am still amazed at Michener´s insight into the shaping of post-apartheid South Africa.\n\nMarch 31, 2009\n\nIt was very interesting to read this book which ended in 1980. As of 2009 we can now look back at what happened to South Africa and it is wonderful to see that of the 2 scenario's that Michener thought most likely the (relatively) bloodless one emerged. I especially enjoyed his section on South Africa under apartheid. It is a reminder to me of how stupid, brutal and ineffective it was a system. The whites now like to complain about Affirmative Action and BEE but looking at the system that we put the blacks under it is enough to make us ashamed. That is not to say that we shouldn't strive to make South Africa a better place for all, we should just realise where our young democracy comes from and gasp in horror and what we did menatlly, physically to the majority of our population. Not to say the least about our education and skills development of the black population. What a disgrace! One should read this book just to see what a frace Apartheid was..\n\nThe book as a whole kind of rambled on through 1000 pages of the history of South Africa. I obviously was interested in the subject matter, but on the whole the book is not that exciting. It is kind of a slow meander with highlights of our history and I enjoyed it as such..\n\nOctober 9, 2022\n\nNot my favorite Michener perhaps but there were still some really interesting stories. As with most of his books, the first half of the book was much stronger than this second half. In this book's case, the real issue for me was reading about all the racism and apartheid and general bigotry throughout the book. I never knew South Africa came from such a rough, racist background. This book taught me a lot but it was no picnic to read.\n\nMarch 14, 2017\n\nRemarks:\n\nReligion (destroy?) vs. Education (enlighten?)\n\nOld and New Testament, Paganism - in evolution and civilization\n\nArt and War - in remembrance, progression and humanity\n\nI'm less a history buff than a fiction aficionado, not equipped to verify or criticize the historical facts and associated reasoning. I immersed in the ocean of millennial saga, surrender to his craft, not getting drowned but in fascination.\n\nLess words given to blacks (and colored) than to whites, but they are the ones who left art (cave painting, architecture...) instead of war(fighting generals) memorial.\n\nThis is the first book by Michener I read, and I want to read more.\n\nApril 9, 2013\n\nThis is not a new book, but I'm glad I've found it as James Michener is a master storyteller. In history classes we were taught drips and drabs of our history, so it was interesting to see how it all fits together. This historical novel is obviously based on fact, but the author's own storyline is cleverly interwoven. It gives one a comprehensive account of how South Africa came into being, the different role players involved as well as the dynamics of this multi-cultural and multi-faceted country. A must for those who whish to understand this complex country.\n\nJanuary 29, 2022\n\nAn epic historical fiction novel about South Africa from 1300s to the 1970s. This whole story revolves around 3 families who represent the 3 significant races of the country. Black South Africans, the Dutch and the English. It was fascinating to see their clash throughout the centuries for the ownership of South Africa. Some characters of the book are fictional and some are real historical figures like King Shaka of the Zulu tribe. It was so interesting to read about this half mad, warmongering king. But I missed few things I used to experience in a Michener book like a sudden introduction to an animal of the region and taking the story through its perspective for a chapter or two. Love that stuff! Michener does it in a very swift manner without interrupting the flow of the story until a human character takes over. The book doesn't explore much on the wildlife of South Africa which surprised me a bit. But it's another highly entertaining and educational novel by James Michener.\n\nFebruary 1, 2021\n\nReally very good in places, but a bit uneven. As usual with a large Michener, the earlier chapters were better than the last few. The short chapter on prehistoric South Africa and chapters on the Trekboers, Mfecane, Shaka Zulu and the arrival of the English were really well written and worth plowing through such a long saga. The last three chapters on Apartheid were just plain tedious.\n\nMarch 5, 2021\n\n1200 highly researched pages concerning the whole history of South Africa. Dozens of in-depth historical events explained through the legacies of three families. One Dutch, one Zulu, and one English.\n\nThe Dutch arrived in 1562. People tend to think the Africanas as wholly Dutch descendants whereas infact they became a mix of 40% Dutch, 35% German, 20% French Huguenot, and 5% mix of Madagascar slave, Malay, and Hottentot.\n\nThe Zulu and Xhosa are descendants from the Bantu region in the 13th Century.\n\nThe English arrived in 1806 to make South Africa a protection of the Crown, but more directly to stop Napoleon gaining control of it.\n\nThe only original inhabitants of the land were the Khoisan hunter and gatherer tribes. They hunted the rhinoceros and painted their colour drawings inside caves 12,000 years ago.\n\nA central theme of this book is how the Africanas fought for their freedom against the Dutch State, then the English State, against the Zulus and other tribes, in the Boer War, and then eventually only to take away the freedoms of all others later on.\n\nWritten in 1980 in the midst of Apartheid, Michener provides a detailed analysis of many different angles to the suffering and gives some very accurate predictions about the future.\n\nAlthough Nelson Mandela is not mentioned in this book my own additional research gave me a fresh insight and respect for the man. It can be summed up in Mandela's famous quotation;\n\n'No one is born hating another person because of the colour of his skin, or his background, or his religion. People must learn to hate, and if they can learn to hate, they can be taught to love, for love comes more naturally to the human heart than its opposite.'\n\nJanuary 14, 2015\n\nThe last time I read this book was about six years ago, and I remember thinking that Michener was overly sympathetic to the Afrikaners, and thus, to their cause - apartheid. Finding that morally repugnant, I decided I was done with this book and done with Michener.\n\nCurrently, I'm experiencing a Michener-revival, and after watching \"Invictus\", thought I'd give this book another try.\n\nLike all Michener books, this is incredibly well-researched, and very involved, with characters that span hundreds of years. Some of those characters' descendants will turn up in the story later on; others do not. However, like most Michener books I've read, this is also a fascinating read - and, as I discovered this round, not necessarily sympathetic to the Afrikaners and their cause.\n\nI think Michener demonstrates sympathies to all groups he writes about, and this book is no exception. It is true that much of this book is devoted to Afrikaner families, but that is to be expected of a book about South Africa. The reader should also take into consideration that this was written in 1979, and even if some characters espouse repugnant views, those are not necessarily the views of the author.\n\nI don't think this is Michener's best novel - I'd say Hawaii, followed closely by The Source - are his best works, but this is certainly a book worth reading.\n\nI'm glad I re-read this. If you like historical fiction, you probably will be too.\n\nAugust 10, 2011\n\nBORING! My dad gave me this book before I left the U.S. to study in South Africa. I got a third of the way through before finally giving up. I love to read and rarely stop reading in the middle, but I found it very difficult to commit to The Covenant. The history is interesting and useful and has been a good companion to my travels in this country, but ultimately the characters are one-dimensional, and the stories seem forced, rather than developing in an organic way. The author seemed more interested in writing a history textbook than a novel, and only took a cursory stab at describing the characters making their ways through their social spheres. At no point did I emphasize with any character; instead I was forced by Michener to view them from a distance, which I think diffuses his whole purpose of making history accessible and immediate to a large audience. Overall, I would have rather read a history textbook; then I would at least know what I was getting into.\n\nJune 23, 2014\n\nI bought this book for 50 Cents in one of the nicest book stores ever. Too bad it's in Gold Beach, Oregon.\n\nSeptember 2, 2013\n\nThis book was published in 1980.\n\nFACTS FROM THIS BOOK:\n\nB.P.E.--Before the present Era. Cave paintings in South Africa carbon dated at 13000 B.P.E.\n\nHottentots-the native people of southwestern Africa, closely related to the Bushmen. The San people, more commonly known as Bushmen, are believed to be the earliest inhabitants of southern Africa. They have lived for 80,000 years as hunter-gatherers in the Kalahari Desert, and are well-known for their expert survival skills in a harsh environment. Their unique clicking languages and their astonishing method of healing through trance dancing have made them a source of worldwide fascination.. \"Vanishing Cultures: Bushmen of the Kalahari\" visits the troubled San community whose once thriving culture is now facing extinction.\n\nHuguenots-followers of John Calvin, from France, ended up in South Africa in 1600's. Saint Bartholomews Day-massacre under orders of Catherine de Medici, protestanism was to be destroyed in France once and for all. Pope gregory XIII was exalted. As was Phillip of Spain. Later, in 1685, Louis XIV, again expelled any protestants from France.\n\nBoers-farmers in South Africa of Dutch or Huguenot decent\n\nTsotsi-member of a street gang.\n\nKing's Nieces-young girls in orphanages in Holland\n\nAfrikaners- Dutch Calvanists who settled in the Cape. It was the stopping point for dutch ships sailing to Java. They believed God had given them this land.. Adhered to the Old Testament and believed the blacks and coloureds were similar to the Cannanites (desendents of Ham who were expelled from the house of the Lord) Believed they had a special covenant with God. patterned themselves after the Israelites. Normal growth of South Africa was stunted because of the ruling Dutch Calvanists. when compared to growth in America at the same time. In 1806 South Africa had 26000 whites: Canada had 250,000 and Mexico had 885,000. Deficiency was worst in education. No printing presses, books or newspapers were allowed.\n\nSarah was 127 when she died and Abraham took a se4cond wife, Keturah.\n\nBook of Acts written by the same unknown author as the Gospel of St Luke.\n\nGolan was created as a safe hostage, a city of refuge.\n\nOphir- Country of uncertain location, possibly southern Arabia or the eastern coast of Africa, from which gold and precious stones and trees were brought for Solomon\n\n1795-England won the war and the Cape was ceded to them by Willian V. Then England and Holland became allies in the fight against Napolean and the Cape was once more Dutch. 1806 Holland joined Napolean and once more the Cape was under the English. It became the stopping point for English ships sailing to India.\n\nShaka-chief of the Zulus.\n\nMatabele-split from the Zulus\n\nCecil Rhodes- at one time the richest man in the world. Stalked by a Polish-Russian, Princess Radziwill. He died 1902, age 49. \"So little done, so much to do.\" Rhodesia became Zimbabwe\n\nPaulus Kruger- leader of the Afrikaners. he went into exile in Holland\n\nThe Boer Wars were two wars fought during 1880–1881 and 1899–1902 by the British Empire against the Dutch settlers of two independent Boer republics, the Orange Free State and the Transvaal Republic. The First Anglo-Boer War (1880–1881), was a rebellion of Boers (farmers) against British rule in the Transvaal that re-established their independence. The Second War (1899–1902), by contrast, was a lengthy war—involving large numbers of troops from many British possessions, which ended with the conversion of the Boer republics into British colonies (with a promise of limited self-governance). These colonies later formed part of the Union of South Africa During the later stages of the Second Boer War, the British pursued the policy of rounding up and isolating the Boer civilian population in concentration camps, one of the earliest uses of this method by modern powers. The wives and children of Boer guerrillas were sent to these camps, which had poor hygiene and little food. Many of the children in these camps died, as did some of the adults.\n\nAnglo-Boer war-1899. Winston Churchill fought in it. So did Ghandi (as an ambulance driver) Also, General Robert Baden-Powell. Rudyard Kipling and Conan Doyle came to write about this war.\n\nWhen South Africa obtained dominion status in 1910, Louis Botha, an Afrikaner became the first Prime Minister of the Union of South Africa.\n\nJan Christiaan Smuts, (24 May 1870 – 11 September 1950) was a prominent South African and British Commonwealth statesman, military leader and philosopher. In addition to holding various cabinet posts, he served as Prime Minister of the Union of South Africa from 1919 until 1924 and from 1939 until 1948.\n\nBantu replaced the offensive name \"Kaffir\"\n\nTrianon- first wine plantation in South Africa.\n\n1948-Nationalists won over Jan Smuts.\n\nApartheid-reflected the Afrikaners belief that God willed the races to be kept separate.\n\nSoweto-dormitory town outside of Johannesburg for blacks who worked in the city during the day. No commercial area, these people had to buy from the whites in the city and commute by train.\n\nNelson Rolihlahla Mandela born 18 July 1918) is a South African anti-apartheid revolutionary and politician who served as President of South Africa from 1994 to 1999. He was the first black South African to hold the office, and the first elected in a fully representative, multiracial election. His government focused on dismantling the legacy of apartheid through tackling institutionalised racism, poverty and inequality, and fostering racial reconciliation.\n\nA Xhosa born to the Thembu royal family, Mandela attended Fort Hare University and the University of Witwatersrand, where he studied law. After the Afrikaner nationalists of the National Party came to power in 1948 and began implementing the policy of apartheid, he rose to prominence. Working as a lawyer, he was repeatedly arrested for seditious activities and, with the ANC leadership, was prosecuted in the Treason Trial from 1956 to 1961 but was found not guilty. Although initially committed to non-violent protest, in association with the South African Communist Party he lead a bombing campaign against government targets. In 1962 he was arrested, convicted of sabotage and conspiracy to overthrow the government, and sentenced to life imprisonment.\n\nMandela served 27 years in prison, first on Robben Island, and later in Pollsmoor Prison and Victor Verster Prison. An international campaign lobbied for his release, which was granted in 1990 amid escalating civil strife. Becoming ANC President, Mandela published his autobiography and led negotiations with President F.W. de Klerk to abolish apartheid and establish multiracial elections in 1994, in which he led the ANC to victory. He was elected President and formed a Government of National Unity in an attempt to defuse ethnic tensions. As President, he established a new constitution and initiated the Truth and Reconciliation Commission to investigate past human rights abuses. Continuing the former government's liberal economic policy, his administration introduced measures to encourage land reform, combat poverty, and expand healthcare services. Internationally, he acted as mediator between Libya and the United Kingdom in the Pan Am Flight 103 bombing trial, and oversaw military intervention in Lesotho. He declined to run for a second term, and was succeeded by his deputy, Thabo Mbeki. Mandela subsequently became an elder statesman, focusing on charitable work in combating poverty and HIV/AIDS through the Nelson Mandela Foundation.\n\nMandela has been a controversial figure for much of his life. Right-wing critics denounced him as a terrorist and communist sympathiser. He nevertheless gained international acclaim for his anti-colonial and anti-apartheid stance, having received more than 250 honours, including the 1993 Nobel Peace Prize, the US Presidential Medal of Freedom, and the Soviet Order of Lenin. He is held in deep respect within South Africa, where he is often referred to by his Xhosa clan name, Madiba, or as Tata (\"Father\"); he is often described as \"the father of the nation\".\n\nMandela has been married three times, has fathered six children, has 17 grandchildren and a growing number of great-grandchildren.Mandela's first marriage was to Evelyn Ntoko Mase, in October 1944.[54] The couple broke up in 1957 after 13 years, divorcing under the multiple strains of his adultery and constant absences, devotion to revolutionary agitation, and the fact that she was a member of the Jehovah's Witnesses, a religion requiring political neutrality.The couple had two sons, Madiba \"Thembi\" Thembekile (1946–1969) and Makgatho Mandela (1950–2005), and two daughters, both named Makaziwe Mandela (known as Maki; born 1947 and 1953). Their first daughter died aged nine months, and they named their second daughter in her honour.[citation needed] Mase died in 2004, and Mandela attended her funeral. Makgatho's son, Mandla Mandela, became chief of the Mvezo tribal council in 2007.\n\nMandela's second wife, Winnie Madikizela-Mandela. She was the city's first black social worker.They had two daughters, Zenani (Zeni), born 4 February 1958, and Zindziswa (Zindzi) Mandela-Hlongwane, born 1960. Zindzi was only 18 months old when her father was sent to Robben island. Later, Winnie would be deeply torn by family discord which mirrored the country's political strife; whilearation (April 1992) and divorce (March 1996), fueled by political estrangement.\n\nMandela remarried on his 80th birthday in 1998, to his third wife, Graça Machel (née Simbine), widow of Samora Machel, the former Mozambican president and ANC ally who was killed in an air crash 12 years earlier.\n\n⦁\n\nFebruary 22, 2023\n\nEen dergelijk gigantisch boek verdient enkele woorden als recensie.\n\nIn dit epische werk van 1150 pagina's weet Michener de complexiteit, nuance en schoonheid van de Zuid-Afrikaanse geschiedenis over te brengen aan de hand van de verweven geschiedenis van drie families. Alle spelers komen aan bod (Khoisan, Xhosa, Zulu, VOC-handelaren, Boers, Engelsen, Afrikaners, Coloureds) en laten zien hoe de geschiedenis van Zuid-Afrika niet kan worden gelezen in termen van goed en kwaad of zwart en wit. Als lezer kom je ontzettend veel te weten over deze geschiedenis, maar het gaat nooit ten koste van ontwikkelingen van het verhaal en de personages. Fictieve personages als Willem van Doorn, Nxumalo, generaal de Groot of Philip Saltwood zijn net zo reëel als Jan van Riebeeck, Paul Kruger of Shaka Zulu. Michener schreef dit boek in 1980, voordat de Apartheid eindelijk werd afgeschaft. Toch lees je in dit boek dat ook in 1980 hoop en verandering in de lucht hing. Dit boek is een aanrader voor iedereen die de complexiteit van Zuid-Afrika beter wil begrijpen en ondertussen ook vermaakt wil worden.\n\nEnkele quotes die ik de moeite waard vond:\n\n\"It was a journey any young man would want to make, five hundred miles due north across the heart of Africs, crossing wide rivers, sharing the pathway with animals innumerable, and heading for a city known only in legend.\"\n\n\"There were in South African life two events that struck terror in the hearts of ordinary men: when two bull elephants raged in low scrub, knocking down trees in their feud; and when two Boers engaged in an business deal.\"\n\n\"But if we read the Old Testament too grimly, we miss the lovemaking, the adventure, the wild triumphs, the dancing and the sound of flutes.\"\n\n\"Detritus, that's the word. The awful accumulation of wrong decisions, improper turns. You scrape away the excrescenses of history [...] and maybe you get down to the bedrock of human society, where diamonds hide. God of my fathers, how I wish we could bring in the psychological drills and probe down to bedrock.\"\n\nDecember 1, 2012\n\nA panoramic novel, spanning centuries, where the tragic heroine is Mother South Africa, whose children are unable to live together in peace. I wish my school history books had been written like this, with the insertion of fictional characters to bring story and life into what is normally a dull narrative.\n\nAfter a preface on the early Bushman who inhabited the land since pre-historic times, the story follows the lineage of the Afrikaner Van Doorn, English Saltwood and Zulu Nxumalo families, from the arrival of the first Europeans in the mid 17th century to the end of the 1970’s. Dominant members of each of these families shape and are shaped by the history of the country. There are dozens of stories within this book, tragic, dramatic, humorous and downright inhuman, all extremely interesting and well rendered. The intent of the novel in its 1100 pages seems to be to capture the history South Africa and therefore we see characters enter and exit quickly along with their stories, with only a few like Tjaart and Detleef Van Doorn, Hillary and Laura Saltwood, Jonathan and Daniel Nxumalo and the timeless General Paulus De Groot leaving larger footprints than their relatives.\n\nThe clash of white and black cultures is evident from the beginning when the Europeans land in Cape Town in the mid 17th century and migrate north as far as the boundary with Zimbabwe over generations, while the blacks in the form of the resident Hottentots, the Xhosa from across the Great Fish River, and their northern Zulu cousins separated by the Drakensburg range, all drift south seeking boundless grazing land for their herds. The Dutch Afrikaner and his nomadic cousin, the Boer, are portrayed as fierce, independent individuals, willing to fight against insurmountable odds, who in their Calvinistic faith believe that this land was given to them, by God’s covenant and that like the different colours of jelly, the various colours of race shouldn’t mix. The English, who arrive in 1805, are more interested in empire and the abolition of slavery, while the blacks simply want their land back, and the Coloureds reflect the sin of miscegenation. Mixed in with the fictional characters are real life individuals, three in particular: Shaka of the Zulu, Cecil Rhodes and Lord Kichener, men who never married, wreak havoc in the country in their misguided intention of maintaining order.\n\nLoyalties shift between the ethnic groups during each generation as they jockey for pole position. There is even a time when the Afrikaners throw in their lot with the Germans during the two world wars of the 20th century to be rid of the British, while the Xhosa starve themselves to death under the illusion that the Russians are coming to their aid after the Crimean War. The British are no better and open concentration camps at the end of the Boer War where many women and children die of typhoid, dysentery and other diseases.\n\nAll this evolution only leads to South Africa’s darkest phase, when the Afrikaner Nationalist Party gains control in 1948 and institutes a form of Nazism called Apartheid. Horrible things happen during this time: whites have to carry Life Books with them detailing every incident in their life to protect their racial purity, Coloureds are to be deprived of their vote, blacks are given “Bantustans” (segregated homelands), transgressors of any colour are “banned” from public life indefinitely, and suspicion rules the land – for instance, the lack of freckles could imply that you are Coloured. The irony is that when racial investigations are initiated, even the “purest of the pure” are found to have some miscegenation somewhere up their family tree, making the whole issue of racial purity, in a land where early European male settlers could not find wives easily, a bit of a joke.\n\nIt’s a pity that Michener ends his narrative in 1979, with Apartheid at its worst, with scores of the best and brightest fleeing the country for places like Canada and Australia, with blacks massing for revolution over in Mozambique, and with 400 years of evolution leading the country only to its worst boiling point. God’s Covenant, indeed - Calvin would be turning in his grave!\n\nWe all know that Apartheid ended in the 1990’s and South Africa still lurches trying to find its feet under its new balance of power, and therefore this story has no ending, yet. Michener shows hope however, when he parallels Phillip Saltwood’s tireless search for diamonds, which finally yields the possibility of a find, to the search for peace in the land by its various leaders who are mining for diamonds in their fellow citizens’ souls.\n\nAs for the fate of the panoramic novel, I think it has less hope than South Africa has, given the shrinking of attention spans these days. I took nearly a month to finish this book, engrossing though it was, and am unlikely to pick up another Michener tome for a long time to come. Mich would have to drastically alter his writing strategy were he still alive today.\n\nFebruary 17, 2016\n\n4.5 stars\n\nWhen I realized this was a formidable book of almost 1200 pages I postponed reading it for several weeks. Once I started it I was fascinated by the brutal and bloody history of this beautiful country.The story is told through the lives, actions and beliefs of three extended, multigeneration families,( fictional but with some actual events) and gave me more insight as to how the reviled system of apartheid came to be. There is an Afrikaaner family (an amalgamation of mainly Dutch, Huguenot and German),an English family and a Zulu family whose history is told from their beginnings in South Africa. We also learn of the fate of the Xhosa tribe, indigenous people such as the San (Bushman) and Hottentots.\n\nFanatical and firmly held religous beliefs considered the Blacks inferior in ability, fit only as servants or for menial labour by the Whites.The Coloured (people of mixed race)were considered tainted by the sexual sins of their ancestors and were confined to certain jobs and separate living areas. Blacks saw their homes bulldozed and sent to segregated areas. Chinese were brought in as cheap labour, and then expelled. Indians were also considered beneath the white settlers, and limited in where they lived and what they achieved. Gandhi shows up as a stretcher bearer during the Boer War.\n\nThe Afrikaaners mostly believed they had a covenant with God to rule this country and their religious beliefs gave them the right to subject and enslave people they considered inferior. The English wanted South Africa as part of the British Empire, and bloody wars were fought with heroic actions on both sides. Sometimes their native servants accompanied them into battle fields, and there were also wars with the Zulus.\n\nThe thoughts and actions of the books charscters gave me better insight into this gorgeous, troubled country, more than history books could convey. Some of the fictional characters are based on real people and events. Throughout the book we also read about real historical characters. It added to my enjoyment to look up their photos and biographies on the internet, and also pictures and maps of the places mentioned.\n\nThe book was published in 1979 when apartheid was in force, positions of wealth and power were confined to the whites, other people were defranchised, Blacks were seeing their homes bulldozed and being sent to hovels outside the city, anyone of any race considered an agitator could be banned or imprisoned and/or tortured.\n\nI wish there had been an addition to the book for the rapid events which occured in starting with President de Klerk negotiating with Mandela while he was imprisoned in 1990, the dismantling of apartheid, and universal voting rights, the release of Mandela from prison and his ascent to the Presidency. Would have liked to know how the book's characters thought and reacted to these changes in the structure of their society. At the end of the book it was suggested that it would take much time and patience and maybe a war for these changes to take place, and maybe their grandchildren would live to see what actually happened within 14 years of the publication of the Covenant.\n\nMay 25, 2024\n\nThe story goes to only 1841. First, a story about the first tribe which would slowly migrate to the South. Then, the Dutch arrive setting up a way station on the way to Java and beginning wine production. Then, the Huguenots arrive and improve the wine. Then the English arrive with their missionaries. Finally, you have the rise of the Zulu nation. Michener tells the story well and covers the horrid situations each faced to get there. It is an interesting tale from an area I know little about.\n\nMarch 27, 2016\n\nGreat summary of the history of South Africa. It's a learning experience and wish I had read James A. Michener's books in high school history class. One thing that particularly stood out for me was that the truly violent and horrific events in the book weren't from the people I thought they were gonna be from. WE forget some parts of history sometimes. Having said all that though, I did not like that you could not connect with ANY characters in the book. By the end of the chapter, the character that you were reading about is dead. Not by anything related to the plot but just of natural causes. The time span in this book is over 500 years so it was more of a lecture and less of a story. There were MANY little great mini stories and some characters I would have liked to read an entire story about, but that wasn't the case. This distances you from the characters and makes the story sort of dull.\n\nSeptember 11, 2019\n\nA reread. The first time was 3 decades ago. I still have the original, much beaten-up paperback, complete with all the necessary scotch tape to keep the pages together. I found the book as enthralling as in the first reading. Since that time, the \"Rainbow Nation\" has been born. This event, one of the most positive moments in the 20th century, was in the back of my mind as I raced to the section of the narrative where the idea of Aparteid comes to life in an Afrikaaner kitchen (preparing gelatine of different colours). Three decades ago, the book ends and the reader could only hope, whilst yesterday night, the reader could take solace that racial justice has prevailed."
