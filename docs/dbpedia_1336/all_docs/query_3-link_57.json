        "text": "Five years ago, Mandarins broke into the Top 12 World Class for the first time ever, riding the wings of an innovative production, “Life Rite After.”\n\nWith a final score of 88.150, the Sacramento corps finished 2018 in 10th place, and matched that all-time high ranking in 2019 and 2022, its two most recent competitive seasons.\n\nThe corps’ results throughout the 2023 season, however, could point to an even more historic competitive jump for Mandarins.\n\nShould it hold up or even closely maintain through the DCI World Championships, August 10-12 in Indianapolis, the Sacramento corps’ fifth-place finish — shared with Phantom Regiment in a tie — at Saturday’s DCI Southwestern Championship presented by Fred J. Miller, Inc., would shatter the corps’ highest finish ever.\n\n“We have reached new heights this season,” Mandarins drum major Milo Bezuidenhout said after the corps’ run in San Antonio. “We're getting more, we're getting higher. I'm really proud of them and [the members] should be really proud of themselves this season.”\n\nThroughout the season, the Mandarins have consistently wowed drum corps audiences across the nation with 2023’s production, “Sinnerman,” a program which falls in line with the corps’ recent trend of edgier show concepts.\n\nThe show — while designed to have drum corps audiences come to their own conclusions on good versus evil — uses the Nina Simone track of the same name to depict a journey of discovering one’s true nature.\n\n“It's about breaking free from societal pressure to be a certain way or kind of person and growing past that to become who you truly are,” Bezuidenhout said.\n\nIn line with an energizing production, Mandarins’ scores have opened many eyes as well, as evidenced by the corps’ fifth-place finish in the overall general effect scoring caption.\n\nWith just over two weeks left in the competitive season, as of Tuesday’s DCI Tour event in McKinney, Texas, Mandarins stand just 2.263 points away from the corps’ 2022 final score, 90.013, which currently stands as the organization’s highest-ever World Class final tally.\n\nThe excitement level within the membership coming off the field in San Antonio was high, according to Bezuidenhout. Bezuidenhout also credited the bond between the members and their desire to push “Sinnerman” to its full potential for the corps’ successful first half of the 2023 season.\n\n“We're having a wonderful season,” Bezuidenhout said. “There's so much camaraderie. There's so much friendship, and I think that's really pushing us further in our endeavors.”\n\nWith a major competitive milestone potentially on the horizon, Mandarins are also celebrating an organizational milestone this season — its 60th anniversary. The anniversary season combined with the on-field results has made this season even more special for the current members.\n\n“It's really amazing [to be a part of the 2023 season],” Bezuidenhout said. “It's such a blessing and a pleasure for me to be with this organization. I have never experienced anything better in my life.”\n\nThere are still a couple weeks standing between the present and what could be a monumental competitive achievement for Mandarins. However, the corps is focused on reaching its full potential.\n\nAn anniversary milestone and an electrifying production, according to Bezuidenhout, are just vehicles the corps is using to honor the past and look toward the near future amidst a wave of success.\n\n“I think this is a huge milestone for us,” Bezuidenhout said. “This is really exciting because not only are we setting the next foot for future Mandarins, but we're also honoring previous Mandarins that have come before us.”"
