        "text": "There are many different ways of making Melktert. The one method is to cook the filling on the stove and add it to a prepared crust. The other is to bake it in the oven together with the crust.\n\nA crust can be made from “Tennis” or “Marie” biscuits, although the traditional way is to use a pastry dough crust.\n\nThe traditional filling is made from milk and eggs, so basically a custard. More modern versions use starch (Maizina) and some even use Condensed milk.\n\nYou can also make milk tart in a microwave oven.\n\nSee our page about baking substitutes for more information about Maizina\n\nCrust:\n\nSift flour, and salt.\n\nGrate butter and rub into flour mixture.\n\nWhisk ice water and egg yolk foam, mix lightly into flour mixture.\n\nPlace dough in the fridge to cool.\n\nWhen it is ice-cold, press dough into a pre-buttered tart pan (I used 28cm diameter) and place it back in the fridge while you make the tart filling.\n\nFilling:\n\nPre Heat the oven to 180 C\n\nIn a medium pot, heat 3 cups milk on stovetop, medium heat. Separately sift flour, and mix with sugar, 1 cup milk and salt. (Make sure there are no lumps!)\n\nStir flour mixture into warm milk and simmer till cooked and thickened up, custard texture. Keep stirring regularly to make sure no lumps. And medium heat to not burn the milk!!\n\nSeparate eggs: Whisk 4 egg yolks and mix with a little warm milk mixture before adding all into the pot and mix well.\n\nAdd the butter and keep stirring till all melted, also add vanilla. Take the mixture off the stovetop. Whisk the egg whites well but not dry, and lightly fold (not whisk) into the milk mixture.\n\nPour filling into the tart pan.\n\nBake in pre-heated oven for 45min or till light golden brown crust+filling.\n\nLet it cool down and sprinkle lightly with cinnamon or cinnamon sugar mix."
