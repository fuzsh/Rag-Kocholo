        "text": "Callaway Products are Backed for Two Years\n\nWarranty Coverage: Except as otherwise stated on the product or packaging, Callaway Golf Company warrants its golf clubs, components, and other products purchased from an authorized Callaway Golf retailer or distributor to be free of defects in material and workmanship for two years. Callaway Golf will, without charge to the consumer, repair or replace any product or component or part thereof that is defective or becomes defective during normal use within two years after the date of purchase from an authorized Callaway Golf retailer or distributor. At its option, Callaway Golf may replace the product with a new or refurbished product. Callaway Golf does not warrant its products against damage caused by third parties. This warranty does not cover paint scratches, cosmetic blemishes or other normal wear and tear. Callaway Golf will fix such blemishes and scratches, however, for a fee. To obtain warranty service in the United States on a complete Callaway Golf product, return the product to a Callaway Golf authorized retailer or directly to Callaway Golf. In the case of a Callaway Golf component, you must obtain warranty service through an authorized Callaway Golf retailer of that component. Outside of the United States, all warranty service must be obtained from the distributor or subsidiary in the country in which the club was purchased. To determine the Callaway Golf authorized retailer, distributor or subsidiary nearest you, check our website at www.callawaygolf.com or contact Callaway Golf directly. In California call collect 760-931-1771; outside California call toll free 1-800-588-9836.\n\nDisclaimer: This warranty is in lieu of all other express warranties. Callaway Golf disclaims all warranties for products that are purchased from sellers other than authorized retailers or distributors, including the warranty of merchantability or the warranty of fitness for a particular purpose. Callaway Golf also disclaims any implied warranty, including the warranty of merchantability or the warranty of fitness for a particular purpose, and assumes no responsibility for any special, incidental, or consequential damages as to all products and components. Callaway Golf further disclaims any implied or express warranty of, and assumes no responsibility for, defects in workmanship caused by third parties. This warranty gives the consumer specific legal rights; a consumer may have other rights depending upon where he or she lives. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of special, incidental or consequential damages, or limitations on how long a warranty lasts, so the above exclusion and limitations may not apply to everyone. Outside of the United States, local taxes, tariffs or shipping charges may apply. This warranty does not apply to Callaway Golf® or Odyssey® golf clubs purchased in Australia or New Zealand on or after January 1, 2011. For warranty information for purchases made in Australia and New Zealand on or after that date, see the South Pacific warranty. The above warranty also does not apply to upro gps devices or accessories.\n\nNot Satisfied? Return Your Product for a Refund.\n\nReturns/Exchanges For Online Purchases\n\nCallaway Golf wants you to be fully satisfied with every item you purchase. If you are not satisfied with the item you have purchased, you may return it within 30 days of shipment for a full refund of the product price. This does NOT include shipping, handling, or any customization charges that may have been assessed.\n\nIn either case a Return Merchandise Authorization (RMA) is required. To obtain your RMA, please contact a Sales and Customer Service Representative toll free at 1-800-299-4655 or email us.\n\nCredit Card Refunds\n\nOn returns, we can only credit the credit card used for the original purchase. Please allow 1-2 billing cycles for the refund credit to appear on your statement."
