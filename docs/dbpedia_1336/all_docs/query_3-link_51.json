        "text": "Fresh from his Edinburgh Fringe run and debut UK tour in 2023, a Netflix stand-up special and an arena tour supporting Trevor Noah, comedian Schalk Bezuidenhout is set to embark on a brand-new UK Autumn tour, titled ‘Keeping Up’, from 2nd October to 27th October 2024. Tickets go on pre-sale this Wednesday 15th November, followed by a general on-sale this Thursday 16th November.\n\nNewly married, Schalk feels older, wiser and much more mature (possibly), but all he wants is to stay \"hip with the youth\". Can he do it? Can he Keep Up? One of the most exciting voices in South African comedy, Schalk is bringing his unique contemporary Afrikaans perspective to the British masses, with love in his heart and jokes in his pocket. Many say that this brand-new show is... funny. What else can we say? It's a comedy show. You will laugh. It's as easy as that.\n\nSchalk Bezuidenhout is a comedian and actor, with a host of accolades to his name including winner of the Savanna Newcomer Award at the Comics Choice Awards 2013, nominee for Breakthrough Act at the Comics Choice Awards 2014 and winner of the Intermediate Award at the Comics Choice Awards 2015.\n\nSchalk has his own stand-up special for Comedy Central and recently recorded his special for Netflix as part of Only Jokes Allowed. On radio, he has appeared on shows such as Andrew Maxwell’s series Welcome to Wherever You Are (BBC Radio 4) and Comedians Vs The News (BBC World Service). As an actor, Schalk played the lead role in the major feature length film ‘Kanarie.’\n\nAs a live performer, Schalk has grown his international career, selling out runs at London’s Leicester Square Theatre, Soho Theatre and Edinburgh Festival Fringe, as well as opening for Trevor Noah in 2015, 2017, and most recently an arena tour Summer 2023. He has also performed at the Melbourne International Festival and Adelaide Festival, as well as in Perth, Sydney and Brisbane.\n\nTour tickets are available at www.mickperrin.com\n\nPicture credit: Marguerite van Eeden"
