        "text": "The organisation\n\nTurning point in the history of The Hague District Bezuidenhout was the unintentional Allied bombardment of 3 March 1945 on Bezuidenhout. Photographs of the situation before and immediately after the bombardment not only show the former grandeur of the district but also the terror of war. This contrast has been the starting point for putting together the information. The tour offers an historical view and let you discover the architectual buildings of recent date with its contemporary character. It is this combination which makes Bezuidenhout a special district.\n\nFor the design of the walking route and its website various parties have worked closely together and used the extensive information already available about Bezuidenhout and more specifically the war period and the bombardment on Bezuidenhout. Without these parties and available information the historic walking tour could not have been made."
