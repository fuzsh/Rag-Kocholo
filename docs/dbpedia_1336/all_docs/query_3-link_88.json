        "text": "A 20-year-old amateur golfer became a PGA Tour champion Sunday.\n\nNick Dunlap, a University of Alabama sophomore, won The American Express tour, beating out Christiaan Bezuidenhout by one stroke and finishing the 72-hole tournament at 29-under-par 259.\n\nBut the champion wonâ€™t be able to collect any prize money despite becoming the first amateur to win a PGA Tour event since Phil Mickelson at the 1991 Northern Telecom Open, per the rules of amateur status.\n\nThe $1,512,000 prize will be given to Bezuidenhout, the only runner-up in the tour, as if Dunlap had not been in the field, a spokesperson for PGA Tour confirmed to NBC News.\n\nA tearful Dunlap was seen hugging his family and friends following his historic win.\n\n\"I went over a scenario for today probably a million times and it's never going to go how you planned, and it didn't,\" Dunlap said. \"I'm so happy to be standing here.\"\n\nComparisons have been drawn between the 20-year-old champion and Tiger Woods.\n\nDunlap is the second golfer in history to win both the U.S. Junior Amateur and U.S. Amateur titles after Woods. He's also the first reigning U.S. Amateur champ to win on the PGA Tour since Woods in 1996.\n\nAt 20 years and 29 days, Dunlap is now the youngest amateur to win on the PGA Tour since Chick Evans at the 1910 Western Open.\n\n\"It is so cool to be out here and experience this as an amateur,\" Dunlap said following his win.\n\n\"If you would have told me that, you know, come Wednesday night I'd have the putts to win this golf tournament, I wouldn't believe you,\" he said."
