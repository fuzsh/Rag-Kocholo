        "text": "Ellis Park, Johannesburg (30-07-2011, 16:00 GMT)\n\nFacing the unbeaten and log leading MTN Golden Lions on the crest of the wave after two Absa Currie Cup victories will not be the easiest task for the Platinum Leopards.\n\nThus far this season the Golden Lions have not only scored the most points (80), but also the most tries (11). The Leopards are on the other end of the table and have conceded the most points (87) and tries (11).\n\nâ€œThis will be a very tough game, because the Golden Lions showed against Griquas last weekend what they can do with the heaps of Vodacom Super Rugby experience they have in the squad,â€ said Platinum Leopards coach Leon Boshoff, who previously played for and coached at the Lions.\n\nâ€œWeâ€™ll concentrate on what weâ€™d like to do in the game and believe we can win there. I also donâ€™t think the Lions will underestimate us, because they almost slipped against the Pumas in the first round. At this level, any team can lose a game if they are only 5% off their game.â€\n\nMTN Golden Lions vs Platinum Leopards\n\nDate: Saturday, 30 July\n\nKick-off: 17:00\n\nVenue: Coca-Cola Park, Johannesburg\n\nReferee: Sindile Mayende\n\nLast year in Absa Currie Cup:\n\n9 July â€\" MTN Golden Lions won 43-13 in Rustenburg\n\n27 August â€\" MTN Golden Lions won 45-22 in Johannesburg"
