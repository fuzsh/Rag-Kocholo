The Preface to the * Creator , the Devil could not have propofed per fell example of thofe ad ions, nor encoura[ us to the imitation of them , if he had not vented the fame 'Relations between Apojl wed Angels as are between Men. Stories of the Heathen Gods Therefore thefe , are not only a real declaration of certain Secrets concerning the Eft ate of the evil Spirits, and the works of Nature , but many of them are ingenious Fables , contrived by the Devil , and delivered to the Poets , to difcredit Ferine, and caufe of Nature Vice to Reign with authority among Men : For when the Divinities , whom they did Worfhif, were guilty of fuch mi(demeanours ; whenfuch as had power to puniff , were the grand, abet¬ tors and protellors of their vitioas actions, they could neither think it ajlameful, nor a dangerous thing to obey their fuggejiions , and follow their Examples , By this means the Enemy of Mankind did labour to debfroy the works of God,and to deface the beautiful Image of our Creator , imprinted in our Souls, with all manner of Vices. The Devils admitted into their Society, and to their Divine Honours , many brave Souls , when they were departed out of the World, as Hercules, Amphiaraus, Antilochus, &c. to encourage others on their Service , in hopes of the fame Honours and Rewards .

Becaufe Japhet had to his lot Europe, and the Iflands, he was made God of the Sea. Thefewere noted for their Pofiefiions, but Sem was remarkable for his Piety, and care to prepare himfelf for another life j he was therefore by his profane Brethren eftablifhed the God of Hell, by way ofderifion, to caftan odium upon the Truth, that remained ftill in his Family.This is the opinion of that Learned Divine, and of many others I conceive, that fuch as invented thefe Fa¬ bles may have had an eye to Noah and his Sons •. but the Devils, that kept up the Worfhip of thefe Gods in their feveral precinCts, had only an intent to make ufe of the true Stories and Names received by a long Tradition, to oblige the men of this World to worfiiip them. Therefore this and the other Interpretations, if well underftood, do not contradict that which I have noted in the Preface. The Poets tell us, that Coelm was the great Grand father of all the Gods, his Wife 1 Nefta brought forth a multitude ofSons and Daughters ; from Heftod we are informed of their Names, c °duio Japetpu, Theia , Hyperion, Rhea, Themis, Mnemofyne, Phoebe, Tethys, Satunms, Gy?as, Jit an, ‘Brontes, &c. • Aplkdorm faith, that Calm was married to the Number the Earth, of whom lie had three forts ofChildren, is 45. theGyants with an hundred hands and fifty Heads, B 3 named S 6 me mow of Book I V 4 r r > The ‘ J i M , Mars Venus JJeptunus Jupiter, hath f mcc found a place amongft the Stars Apollo named Briar etts 7 Gy an, and Cam, the Cyclopes and the Titans , of whom Saturn was the youngeft.

Jupiter did afterwards recover it again, with the help of the reft of the Gods, who fwore fidelity to him upon an Altar, that He was fo happy in this War, that he put all the 77 - tatis to death, and fo freed his Parents from their fetters.

After all thefe Misfortunes, Apollo re-affumed again his Divinity, and became one of the mofb .noted of ail the Gods, not only by the great number of Oracles, that he gave in feveral part of the World, but alfo by the feveral Functions and offices, that were attributed unto him, and by the famous Perfons, that were Paid to be his Sons. Firft, he was taken for the Sun, and in this Quality,he had the Name of Phoebm given to him, that is by interpretation, The Light of the Living. It is true, that fome differ in their relations concerning the Sim , and fay, that his Father was one of the Titans, named Hyperion , from whence it is that he is called Titan.

They were efteemed for their Ghaftity, which they did profefs fo much, that when Adonis , the Favourite of Venus of¬ fered to ftir up in them fpme inclinations of Love, they fell upon him, and put him to death, as fome do report. The Children of Apollo were many -, befides that Rhodia mentioned before, he had tAEtha , the Father of Medea , King of Colchos , unto whom was committed the Golden Fleece, by Phrixus , the Son of Athamas King of Thebes -> when he fled with his Sifter from the fury of his Step-mother, as you ffiall fee in the eleventh Chapter.

This Deluge and ano¬ ther that happened in the time of Ogyges King of Thebes, are themoft remarkable in theWritings of the Poets. Additional Note. TblsDeucalion is commended for hisPiety and Juftice, and is Paid to have built the firft Temple for the Worfhip ofGod.it is plain by the circum* fiances mentioned in the Poets this Fable is borrowed from the truth of the Scripture,from the Hiftory of Noah, who fayed himfelf and his Family, from the Univerfal Deluge by God’s appoir^ • + * 4 tbt ^athert Godsi appointment; Nicolaus Damafcemts and fBerofits Chaldaus , two .of the ancienteft Hiftorians, mention this Deluge, with fome difference from the Scripture.
