FCRKIVAU. ^^ LUMUO.N : PUULISHT FOK THE CHAITCEK SOCIETi' BY N. TRUIJNEII & CO., 57 & 69, LUDGATK HILL. MLIflVT,.\\X\\V. TO %e Wooers of ©i^ouccr, PAST, PRESENT, AMD TOCOHS. FOREWORDS. Wbbn thinking ia 1868 what were the bIx best M83 of the Canterbury Talea to print in my Sie-Teet for the Chaucer Society, the Harleiaa 7334 was of course one of the first that occani to me. But as it had been printed twice by the late Thomas Wright — in 3 vols, for the Percy Society, and then in cheap double-column, — then by Hr. Jephson for the late Eubert Bell's Seriea of English Poets (publiaht by Jn. Wm. Parker), and a fourth time by my friend Dr. Bichard irorria for George Bell's Aldine Series,* I decided to let these four printings suffice for the Harleisn 7334, and so get a fresh MS (which proved to be of the B-type) into print among my Six. It was not a wise decision, as there are too many of the Corpus or B-type already in the Six-Text, and I hare onluckUy filld up gape in the better A-type MSS — Ellesmere, Hengwrt, and Cam- bridge— with extracts from B-type ones, though in several cases the Christchurch A-type MS was open to ma. But when I started Chaucer work, I didn't know even the litUa that the course of it has taught me. (Still, as in- vestigation of the niceties of Early English goes on, prob- ably no student will blame me for having printed one more MS of Tlie Canterbury Tula. And though collaters' curses for the amount of labour I've thrown on them have already fallen thickly upon me, I always assure these Balaams that they'll bless me when theii work is done.) 1 Mr. George Bell meant at fint simply to reprint Pickeriag'i text of Chaucer's Poetical Worlca, but, on laj strong remonstrance H to lU badness, Mr. Bell agreed to e:ignge Dr. Horria to re-edit tbe irhols from MSS. VI TORKVORDS. Well, vboD Editors began to edit Chaucer's Tales, and nanted to know what the reading of Harleinn 7334 is, they often fonnd some italics in Dr. Morris'^ text, showing Uiat he'd alterd his MS ; and as his publisher wouldn't let him give varioos readings, a rererence to the MS became neces- sary. This was a great bore, specially when a man livd in Geimany or America. Moreover, my friend Prot Child meant his {on ' 'Nation-Essay on Chaucer's Ungu^e and metre to be based on the MS Hart 7334, and not on any Editor's changes of it, whether right or wrong. So it gradually became plain that a simple print of this MS must be done for the Chaucer Society. And here accord- ingly it is. It is as accurate as twice reading of eveiy line with the US by me can make it ; bat no doubt little slips have bappend : they always will befall. The MS is dear to the sonl of Henrt Bkadshaw and all concemd in the due order of the Canterbury Tales, be- cause it has, at the end of the First Fragment of Group B — the Man of Law's Tale — the proper Man-of-Law-Shipman Link, which should hook it on to the Second Fragment that the Shipman's Tale heads. No Shipman's Tule and Fn^- raent 2 however follow it — ^bnt instead. Group D, — Wife, Friar, Summoncr, — then Groups E, F, G, C, — and after these, tho ^ranting Second Fragment of B, though without its genuine End-Link. The MS la of an independent type, not falling into 1—187 of the Fmnklin's Tale, p. 3fi4-6 below, Sail, paging), reader it leea fitted for the basis of a complete edition of The Canterburt/ Talet than the fina illuminated Elleamere MS.^ Moreover, UarL 7334 sticks 8 spnrioua linee— 2004 b, c; 2012 b, o; 2037 b, c; 20i8 b, c,— p. 4H=I. iato the Sammonei'e Tale, and one, L 592 (p, 4H) into the Squire's Tale. It also has not 2 lines, A. 262 b, c, in the General Prolog p. 8 ; 2 in the Cook's Tale, A 4375-6, p. 127 ; and 8 at the eod of the Cook's Tale, A 441S— 4422, p. 128; 7 lines in the Knight's Tale, A 2013-18, p. 58, A 2958, p. 84; 2 lines in tbe Miller's Tale, A 3721-2, p, 106 ; 2 in the Reeve-Cook Link (A 4335, 4358, p. 123-6 ; 4 lines alterd into two) ; one line in the Man of Law's Tale, B 417, p. H}> &t)d five at the end of the Man of Law's End-Link, B 1 186— 1 190, p. f |i ; thirty lines in the Wife's Preamble, D 675—584, 605—612, 619-626, 717—720, p. 4f»=«+. m; eight in the Second Nun's Tale, G 165, 210—216, p. i'H> lil ; the 8 genuine Ellesmere lines' in the Franklin's Tale, 1455-6, 1493-8, p. j*i:}, besides leaving out 2 lines (2356-7, p. |H) in the Merchant's Tale,* four (299-300, 305-6, p. Hi) in tho DoctorPardoner Link, two in the Pardoner's Tale, C 478-9 (p. H») ; five in the Shipman'e Tale, B 1355 (p. U;) and B 1376-9 (p. tJi) ; one in Sir Thopas, B 1995 (p. !!ff) ; about a dozen of proso (trebles) in Mulibe,* one stanza of 8 in tbe Monk's Tale, B 3213-20 (p. \\i\\), four lines in the Kun's Priest's Tale, 4136-7 (p. JH), 4478-9 (p. ^;5), nnd all its End Link, 16 Ijnea, (for which see p. 694,) and about 23 treble ones in the Faraon's Tale : see the gaps in pages *S J-9E4 as yon 1 The ElleEmsra has not tbe MaD-of-Law-Sbipman LIdIc which Harl. 7334 has. * No other MS yet ezamind by rae has these 8 11dm.

Altogether, at least, 760 lines are wanting in HarL 7334 : a serious loss.' But on the other hand, this Harl, 7331 puts lines 1307-8 of Group D, the Fnar's Tale, in their right place, on p. H( instead of theic wrong one as lines 1 293-5 of the Wife- Friar Link, on p. Hf. That in some cases the Harl. readings are not so good as those of the EUesmere, I ahowd in my article 'Eecent^ Wodc at Chaucer ' in Macmillaii's Magazine tot March 1874 ; but I admitted that in other instances the Harleiaa readings were the better. Of the MSS which contain the epnrions 'Tole of Gamelyn' — the A-type ones don't — Prof. Skeat found Harl. 7334 much the best. See his 1». Gd. edition of Gamdija for the Clarendon Press. I once hoped to have edited the TaU« and all Chaucer either with Mr. Brodshaw or alone ; but alas, what with the Philological Soc., and occasional work for its Dictionary, Early English Tests and Wyclif, Shakspere and his Quartos and Eolios, Browning and Shelley Societies, Sculliog-Fouis, Kangaroo bicycles, evenings out, and general laziness, I feai that edition most be left for some more learned and energetic person than myself. Lot it suffice that the Chaucer Society has cleard the way for the coming man. I am due now at our Rowing-Club Donee. Brilith Miiteam, Friday, Jan. 8, 18SG, 7.30p.m., under the Eltdrii: Light.
