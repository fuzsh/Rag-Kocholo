        "text": "Next reorganization of the group became with leaving of Karel Zich, in season 1973/74. Spirituál started to show with tramp group (later named Brontosauři) with brothers Jan and František Nedvěd and Zdenka Tosková. Next year leaved Jarka Hadrabová and came Eva Lifková.\n\nIn 1980 Eva Lifková married and went to Francie, in its stead became Irena Budweiserová. Very short time, we had seen also Lenka Slabá and Jan Nedvěd in the group.\n\nDuring revolutionary events (November 23, 1989), the group sang on Prague squares, (two presidents sang with them Vaclav Havel and George Bush senior). For next american president Bill Clinton, the group showed in Reduta in January 1994. In this time, the member was Karel Zich again. František Nedvěd became in 1992 after his brother after recording of album Rajská zahrada.\n\nIn 2000 Olda Ortinský leaved Spiritual, came Jirka Cerny, who was band-master of music band C&K Vocal.\n\nYear 2004 was written by black letters to the history of this band. This year, exactlu in July 13, their member Karel Zich drowned in the Medi, during his diving trip. It wasn´t the first time, what the band lost one of the members (two of the foundation-members, manager of the band), but it was the first time, what Spiritual had to say good-bye to one of the youngest members from actual arrangement.\n\nIt was very hard leave-taking. Karl Zich was great singer and player (his nick was Elvis Presley of Czecho-Slovakia).\n\nIn September 2004 became Jiří Holoubek to the band from Relief.\n\nThe next member Oldřich Orlický dead in May 3, 2006.\n\nMembers:\n\nIrena Budweiserová, sing, percuse\n\nZdena Tichotová, sing, percuse\n\nDušan Vančura, sing, kontrabas\n\nJiří Cerha, sing, perkuse\n\nJiří Tichota, 6-streams guitar, band-master\n\nJiří Holoubek, guitar\n\nDiscography:\n\nPísničky z roku raz dva, Supraphon 1973, reedice 2003\n\nSpirituály a balady, Supraphon 1978, reedice 1995, 2007\n\nSaužení lásky, Supraphon 1981, reedice 1996, 2007\n\n20 let, Supraphon 1984, reedice 1993\n\nŠlapej dál, Panton 1985, reedice 1994\n\nEvery Time I Feel The Spirit, Panton 1986\n\nŠibeničky, Panton 1988, reedice 2003\n\nZa svou pravdou stát, Panton 1990\n\nHallelu, Panton 1991, reedice 2007\n\nRajská zahrada, Panton 1992, reedice 2001\n\nAntologie 1960-1995, Sony/Bonton 1994, reedice 2003\n\nHanba nám!, Monitor 1994\n\nNa káře, Pupava 1997\n\nVánoční koncert, Monitor-EMI 1998\n\nKřídla holubic, Pupava 2002\n\nKarel Zich a Spirituál kvintet, Sony Music 2004\n\nKřížem krážem, Sony BMG 2005\n\n45 let archiv, Sony BMG 2006\n\nSpirituál kvartet, Supraphon 1963\n\nSpirituál kvintet, Traditional jazz studio, Supraphon 1967\n\nSpirituál kvintet, Supraphon 1971\n\nČtwero pjsnj, Panton 1986, reedice 2007\n\nParticipation :\n\nDostavník\n\nPísně amerického západu, 1969\n\n20 let Porty\n\nPorta 1\n\nPorta 2\n\nCountry fontána 97\n\nFolkové balady\n\nF & C Hity\n\n20 folkových písní 1\n\n20 folkových písní 2\n\nDvě Báby\n\nVálka růží\n\nZa svou pravdou stát\n\nTřešničky\n\nMlýny\n\nThis music band was established in autumn time in 1960 by four members of Academy of Music and Dramatic Art, mainly by initiative of Ivo Mach, nick name Dědek (Granfather). It was man quartet. Members were Miroslav Keller (tenor – nick Velký Bubo (Great Bubo)), Miloslav Kastelovič (barytone – nick Kagan, or Malý Bubo (Small Bubo)) and Jiří Tichota (usually bandmaster – nick Tichák).\n\nThe first public presentation came after 2 years, on International Jazz Festival in Karlovy Vary. The name was Spiritual Kvartet and this band was the first folk music band in Czechoslovakia. In that time, the word “folk” was unknown in this area. That’s why they present themselves on jazz concerts, usually with band Junior Trio, S+H Quintet or Tradiotional Jazz Studio P. Smetáčka. With last band they recorded some albums for recording studio Supraphon.\n\nIt was so long time ago, when they had listened american legend music band The Weavers. From that time, they wanted to be like them. After Věra Nerušilováwho was also a member of band Incognito Kvartet, Růženka Helebrantová (nick Odetta) came in and from that time here is Kvintet. Later the band had more members, but the name didn’t change more.\n\nFrom 1964 Spiritual Kvintet had periodic program in Theathe Na Zábradlí. In 1967 two members Mach and Keller leaved band (they went on long-term business trip abroad). Next year (in August) Růženka emigrated to Swiss.\n\nEverybody thought this would be end of this band but it didn’t. In 1969 came Karel Zich and Jarka Hadrabová. The band showed also with Olda Ortinský Dušan Vančura and Honza Thorovský (he substituded Kagan who returned to Slovakia).\n\nThis membership existed only 4 years, but during this period the band wined recognition on country and folk festivals (Porta 70, Golden Tele 71). Also they changed scene to Theatre Atelier. They released their first albums in czech Písně amerického západu and Písničky z roku dva.\n\nAs I said more times (try to see Rangers, Taxmeni, Greenhorns, Fešáci), came normalization and everything pertinated with it. Club were closed, some students had to leave Faculty, band had to finished its activities. Fortunately only for shot time.\n\nTom Dooley\n\nBanua Jail\n\nMává nám svěm svobodná zem\n\nOn Saturday, the country world lost one of his members, the famous and memorable singer Waldemar Matuška.\n\nHe won recognition by his low and flannelly voice. Death cause was pneumonia and heart failure. He died on Florida, May 30, 2009, aged 76.\n\nHis success in 60-teen became with song Suvenir. As one czechoslovak agency wrote about him: “he has hoodlumy sex appeal, beard, evil-eyes and sparkle by energy, he was oposite of his show-business college Karel Gott”. And Waldemar said: ” I m type of vagabond, tramp and singers”.\n\nMaybe it is destiny, but this weekend I was on one country action. Some friends met, played guitar, sang. We played many songs of him. It was shock to came home on Sunday evening and got to hear that bad news.\n\nQuit Quittin\n\nQuit Quittin\n\nWaldemar, Walda, will always of my heard. For ever.\n\nThe 2009 Grammy Awards show took place on February 8, 2009. The following is a list of the winners in the Country Categories.

But I got something from two different visitors of blog. Please be kind to apologize this pure introduction of Andy. Thank you a lot.\n\n“Andy Mullen sports the rich baritone of Crash Test Dummies’ Brad Roberts and a sense of humor somewhere between Bob Newhart and a classic cast of Saturday Night Live. “\n\nPerforming Songwriter\n\nAndy Mullen plays music that he describes as, “folk fusion,” but don’t get the wrong idea, there is nothing sedate or staid about it. Rather, his music bursts out of the speakers in a stream of imagery and sound, and Mullen’s command of his craft is so palpable that in listening, one immediately knows they are hearing an artist with his own unique vision of life and music.\n\n“His clever lyrics will instantly grab your attention, but behind the humor is a man with a fierce intelligence and the soul of a poet. His ability to fashion the insane beauty and unexpected heartache of everyday life into short, well-crafted songs with catchy melodies and sharply etched image is remarkable.”\n\nPlanetOut.com\n\nFeaturing his exceptional finger-picking style on guitar, the songs’ arrangements are uncommonly skillful, with light and subtle touches, like the fiddle and djembe on Sun Goes Up, Sun Goes Down, and the galloping banjo on Quit Quittin’, all which inspire a quiet sense of joy and wonder.\n\nThe utterly moving So Does The Beer tells the story of the death of his father, who died while he recorded the album. The song is an affectingly wry observation on love and loss; his vocals perfectly convey the balance of sadness and acceptance, while never succumbing to excessive sentimentality.\n\n“Simple and stunning acoustic folk.”\n\nHybrid\n\nBut the album is also a showcase for Mullen’s wry and subtly wicked sense of humor, befitting an artist who calls himself “Folk Music’s New Bad Boy.” “Crooked Deck” inspires a multitude of smiles, in his description of himself as a man in possession of only, “The same rhyme all the time/Smokes and jokes and a dozen lines/They say that all I ever sing about is booze.” It’s ironic without being at all jaded, and in that, it is utterly invigorating.\n\nThe Toenail Jar Reel\n\nI’m Sorry, Jeannie\n\nQuit Quittin\n\nSun Goes Up, Sun Goes Down"
