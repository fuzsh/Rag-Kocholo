And Med- vedev is chasing a piece of history of his own after beating Stefanos Tsitispas 7-6 (5), 4-6, 6-4, 6-1 in a heated semifinal on Fri- day. The U.S. Open cham- pion is aiming to be the first man in the Open era to win his second Grand Slam title at the next ma- jor tournament. Nadal advanced to the final in Australia for the sixth time with a 6-3, 6-2, 3-6, 6-3 win in a mostly lopsided contest against seventh-seeded Matteo Berrettini in the first of the semifinals .\n\nMedvedev had a more tempestuous and chal- lenging run to back-to- back Australian Open finals. He had to deal with a hostile crowd in his second-round win over Nick Kyrgios, had to save a match point and rally from two sets down to beat Felix Auger-Alias- sime in a nearly five-hour quarterfinal win. Then he had to regain his compo- sure after an angry out- burst in the second set of the semifinals. The Russian yelled at chair umpire Jaume Cam- pistol in the changever after serving a double-fault to concede a late break, getting a code violation for a visible obscenity when he made a gesture with his arm to the pro-Tsitsipas crowd, and then demanded that his opponent be cau- tioned for receiving coach- ing from his father in Greek from the stands. Medvedev returned after Tsitsipas converted his third set point to level the match and he again urged the umpire to give the French Open runner- up a code violation .\n\nHe then took a five- minute break, took control late in the third set and then reeled off the last five games after Tsitsipas was eventually cautioned for coaching. run to a 29th Grand Slam final has been comparatively serene. After the last point, he stopped, beamed a wide grin and then punched the air three times. Nadal arrived in Austra- lia not knowing how long he would last after months off the tour dealing with a serious foot injury and then a bout of COVID-19. He skipped Wimbledon after losing in the French Open semifinals to Novak Djokovic, and play at all after August .\n\nday has been an issue in terms of problems on the foot. Doubts still here probably for the rest of my Nadal said. for me amazing (to) just com- pete and play tennis at the high level again, facing the most important play- ers of the Last month, he even sure be able to return to the tour. But he won a tune-up tournament in Melbourne and has taken six straight matches at the first Grand Slam event of the year.
