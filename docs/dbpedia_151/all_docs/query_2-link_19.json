The Committee met, pursuant to notice, at 9:35 a.m. in room SR-253, Russell Senate Office Building, Hon. Ernest F. Hollings, Chairman of the Committee, presiding. OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. ERNEST F. HOLLINGS, U.S. SENATOR FROM SOUTH CAROLINA The Chairman. Good morning. The hearing will come to order. I know that there is a good start there with this outstanding panel. Let me see if I can include my full statement in the record, and summarize it in a sense. We have a hearing this morning, of course, on media concentration, and for years now, the genius of the American broadcast system, which is the best in the world, has emphasized diversity. Diversity in ownership creates opportunities for the smaller companies, local businessmen and women. Diversity in ownership allows creative programs and controversial points of view to find an outlet. Diversity in ownership promotes choices for advertisers and diversity in ownership preserves localism, promotes competition, and in fact, it gives us on the Committee and the citizens, generally of the country, our freedom of speech. I have heard, ``Wait a minute, we have got to do away with these ownership rules to give the owner the freedom of speech.&#x27;&#x27; The truth of the matter is that that is a temporary license to amplify his freedom, but to make sure that it is not exclusive, we have injected diversity for at least the past 30 years. Now, what&#x27;s happened is that we are being attacked from every particular angle. In other words, you have got the insatiable industry. We have got the courts and judges that appear to be ignoring the Supreme Court when they set the precedent about the government&#x27;s strong interest in preserving a multiplicity of information sources, and, of course, we have had our distinguished Chairman of the Federal Communications Commission. And I read a quote from him at the latter part of last year, and Chairman Powell, and I quote: ``I start with the proposition that the rules are no longer necessary and demand that the Commission justify their continued validity.&#x27;&#x27; Well, that is not the law--which I read again this morning in an article about this particular hearing that these are all rules dating back to 1970. You should have been here, gentlemen of the panel, in 1996, just 5 years ago. The tremendous debate that we had about just this, these rules. We had a vote on the broadcast ownership cap on the Senate side and it only prevailed--at one time it prevailed one way by 1 vote, and then on a revote, Senator Dole changed and we had the reestablishment--reaffirmment, I should say--of these particular rules by 2 votes. So it had been thoroughly debated. The Congress has been watching these, and the problem is certainly not too little mergers, too little consolidations. But we might hear differently. We have been preparing a bill, I have been working with the colleagues on both sides of the aisle trying to fashion a bill because I like to get things done, not just make headlines, but see if we can make headway. In that light, we really appreciate the appearance of these witnesses here this morning. Let me stop there and yield to our distinguished Ranking Member. [The prepared statement of Senator Hollings follows:] Prepared Statement of Hon. Ernest F. Hollings, U.S. Senator from South Carolina Today, we test the claims of those who would further consolidate the media marketplace. We will hear from two balanced panels who will debate whether our changed media landscape warrants the repeal or relaxation of two existing, sensible restrictions on media ownership-- the 35 percent national television broadcast ownership cap and the newspaper-broadcast cross ownership rule. The last several years have wrought unprecedented concentration in the entertainment and media industries. AOL and Time Warner have merged, Viacom and CBS have united, and Tribune has acquired Times Mirror. These transactions and other consolidation in the industry have decreased, rather than increased competition among media outlets. Yet some of these vertically integrated entertainment conglomerates would like to grow even bigger, and are here before our Committee today seeking to eliminate more of the remaining restrictions on media ownership. These ownership restrictions are based on factors outside the bounds of a traditional antitrust analysis. For example, the national broadcast ownership cap preserves the balance of power between the networks and their affiliates, and thereby serves to promote localism and diversity in individual markets. Similarly, the newspaper-broadcast cross-ownership Rule enhances the proliferation of diverse, and separate points of view in individual markets. The reasons for these rules are simple, and they reflect the underpinnings of the Commission&#x27;s statutory public interest authority. Diversity in ownership promotes competition. Diversity in ownership creates opportunities for smaller companies, and local businessmen and women. Diversity in ownership allows creative programming and controversial points of view to find an outlet. Diversity in ownership promotes choices for advertisers. And diversity in ownership preserves localism--so individuals in towns across America are afforded access to at least several sources for their local news and information. The rules in question have encouraged the growth of locally relevant, independent programmers and distributors of media content. These critically important, independent voices energize our civic discourse and help separate our Nation from those that prohibit the free flow of information. And yet, we are having this hearing today, because the rules are under attack: (1) from an insatiable industry that is unsatisfied with the tremendous consolidation that has already taken place; (2) in the courts from judges who appear to be ignoring Supreme Court precedent about the government&#x27;s strong interest in preserving a ``multiplicity of information sources&#x27;&#x27; in the marketplace; (3) and, most importantly, at the FCC, from a Commission that seems intent on relaxing or eliminating many of the existing ownership rules without regard to the tremendous consolidation that has already occurred. Last year, Chairman Powell stated, and I quote: ``I start with the proposition that the rules are no longer necessary and demand that the Commission justify their continued validity.&#x27;&#x27; That, my friends, is not the law. And that is why we are having this hearing today--to set the record straight. The biennial review process we set up in the Telecommunications Act of 1996 did not presume that the ownership limits ``are no longer necessary,&#x27;&#x27; and must be justified to be retained. It simply requires the FCC to review its ownership rules in light of competition in the market and in view of their ongoing public interest obligations, which require them to promote and protect diversity and localism, values recognized by the U.S. Supreme Court as satisfying a ``governmental purpose of the highest order.&#x27;&#x27; To those who advocate further consolidation, I say, prove your claims. The burden must lie with the proponents of deregulation to demonstrate that a further loosening of the broadcast ownership cap or the newspaper/broadcast cross-ownership rule would be consistent with the public interest. I would propose a different route. Given the consolidation that has occurred already, I believe that we need to take a breather before permitting further concentration to occur. Let&#x27;s recall-- First, the FCC instituted the Financial Interest in Syndication rules (Fin/Syn) in 1970, that imposed significant limitations on the percentage of ``in-house&#x27;&#x27; programs the networks could produce. Those rules also prevented the networks from having a financial interest in syndicated programming on the second run market. In the late 1970s, the Department of Justice entered into consent decrees with the major networks to settle litigation dating back to the Johnson Administration, that sought to also curb the networks&#x27; ownership of in-house programming. In 1995, the FCC eliminated the Fin-Syn rules, giving the major broadcast networks the right to own an unlimited amount of programming that they broadcast, and to syndicate programming by selling it directly to stations. The DOJ consent decrees lapsed around the same time. A year later, in 1996, Congress raised the broadcast ownership cap from 25 to 35 percent, allowing companies like News Corporation and Viacom to purchase yet more TV stations. Two years ago, in 1999, the FCC relaxed the duopoly rules to allow a single owner to acquire two TV stations in some of the larger markets across the country. Last year, Tribune acquired Times Mirror and took advantage of the FCC&#x27;s weak enforcement of the newspaper-broadcast cross-ownership rule. In practice, the FCC has allowed the owner of a broadcast station to acquire a newspaper in the same market without applying the rule until the station&#x27;s broadcast license is renewed, which can be years later. Finally, earlier this year, the FCC did away with a portion of the dual network rule and permitted Viacom&#x27;s UPN to exist under common ownership with CBS. It is directly because of these rule changes and lax FCC enforcement that we have these massive, vertically integrated companies like Viacom and Tribune which--because of their ability to promote and share their content and news products across multiple distribution platforms--are immensely profitable corporations. And yet today they come before us and ask for more. So we&#x27;ve come to a crossroads and there are two paths we can take. One leads to further consolidation and an erosion of diversity in our local markets. The other provides for maintenance of rational ownership restrictions to allow local media outlets to retain some ability to control and disseminate locally relevant news and information, as well as programming that is uniquely suited to their particular community. That is why I am considering legislation, along with Senators Inouye and Dorgan, that will hopefully restore some sense to today&#x27;s debate. Our bill, which we may introduce today, requires FCC licensees to alert the Commission when they acquire a newspaper that creates a cross-ownership situation. The FCC is then directed to review the appropriateness of the acquisition, and determine whether any action is needed to bring the licensee in compliance with the rule. In addition, our bill requires the FCC to report to this Committee, and to the House Committee on Commerce, with any proposed rule changes that would relax or repeal existing media ownership limits. Such proposed changes could go into effect 18 months after we receive such a report--which must include the FCC&#x27;s explanation of how its rules changes will promote competition, diversity, and localism in the public interest. I look forward to testimony from today&#x27;s witnesses. These are important topics--more important in many ways than the typical debates between competing industry sectors. Today we debate the impact of media ownership on the diversity of outlets, viewpoints, and ultimately, the discourse of our democracy. STATEMENT OF HON. JOHN McCAIN, U.S. SENATOR FROM ARIZONA Senator McCain. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I also welcome our distinguished panel. And I agree that this is an important hearing. Existing regulatory caps on broadcast station and newspaper ownership were created decades ago to preserve competition in a mass media market consisting of a limited number of radio stations, television stations and newspapers. But since that time, the mass media market has expanded exponentially. As a result, broadcasters and others are now saddled with anachronistic ownership rules that limit their ability to compete in the modern mass media market. Changes in the mass media market are self-evident. To put the matter bluntly, in the digital era, insight and commentary on matters of public policy will no longer be dominated by Cronkite, Brinkley, The New York Times and The Washington Post. In their place have risen CNN, CNBC, MSNBC, Salon, Wired, Slashdot and innumerable other sources of information and news. Last night I was flipping through the channels and saw BBC News. I hope that our panelists will look at BBC News and take a page from their book and cover some foreign news for a change as well. This new mass media market is dominated not by broadcasters and newspapers, but by multichannel mass media entities like cable TV, direct broadcast satellite television, wireless cable, and of course, the Internet. These new media are not only powerful economic competitors, they are also driving all forms of media to become more interactive. Interactive communications limit mass media&#x27;s ability to dictate public opinion and they allow ordinary citizens to be more than passive recipients of institutionalized news. Many websites, for example, let readers respond to a story by posting their reactions, rebuttals or questions. In the face of these new competitors, new technologies and new market demands, ownership restrictions on traditional media have not only become unnecessary, they have become anticompetitive. Faced with new sources and new methods of competition, broadcasters and newspapers saddled with potentially outdated infrastructure desperately need the increased efficiency that relaxed ownership rules permit. None of these observations are new to this debate or to this Congress. Indeed, Congress recognized all of these points when it enacted the 1996 Telecommunications Act that directed the FCC to review all of its broadcast ownership rules every 2 years. But unfortunately, that directive has gone unfulfilled. To be sure, the Commission has overhauled some of its ownership rules, but it left others in place, including the rules that are arguably the most anachronistic and anticompetitive, the newspaper broadcast cross-ownership ban and the 35 percent national broadcast ownership cap. These actions are inconsistent with the letter and intent of the 1996 Telecommunications Act. That Act directed the Commission to review all of the rules every 2 years because changes rendered those rules inherently suspect. Unfortunately, change in the market has proved once again that it can and will outpace change in government bureaucracy. There are several sources feeding the bureaucratic inertia that have kept these ownership rules in place even as permanent and unmistakable changes in the mass media market continue to render them obsolete. Some of these sources sprang from a misguided notion that we should more heavily regulate broadcasters who profit from the free use of valuable public spectrum. Others sprang from ingrained notions about the power of the broadcast networks and newspapers. But if we are truly to serve the American people, then none of these concerns can justify continued inaction. I firmly believed that broadcasters should pay for the spectrum they use, but burdensome and pointless regulation is no substitute for public revenues obtained from a competitive broadcast industry. I firmly believe that this Congress and the FCC should remain vigilant to prevent undue concentration of power in the mass media markets, but punishing yesterday&#x27;s victors will only aid tomorrow&#x27;s would-be monopolists. Mr. Chairman, thank you for convening this hearing today. [The prepared statement of Senator McCain follows:] Prepared Statement of Hon. John McCain, U.S. Senator from Arizona Thank you Mr. Chairman for having this hearing today regarding this very important topic.

Again, Mr. Chairman, thank you for convening this important hearing today. The Chairman. Thank you. Senator Inouye. STATEMENT OF HON. DANIEL K. INOUYE, U.S. SENATOR FROM HAWAII Senator Inouye. Mr. Chairman, I commend you for calling this hearing. I have a rather lengthy statement, but if I may, I would like to just summarize it and ask that my full statement be made part of the record. Last year, we had received reports that all four networks turned a profit. And I understand that the newspaper industry continues to generate profits at a pace much greater than many American industries. Therefore, Mr. Chairman, I believe that we must be exceedingly cautious before we give into industry&#x27;s claim that absent regulatory relief, their businesses will suffer. In many ways, Mr. Chairman, these companies occupy a public trust. Broadcasters, through their grant of free spectrum, inform the public of local and national relevant news and information; and newspapers do the same. The ownership restrictions that limit aggregation of these businesses are premised on the need to protect that public trust. These ownership restrictions help preserve diversity of ownership and viewpoints both nationally and market-by-market. In turn, that diversity enhances a vibrant localism that keeps our citizens informed when they pick up the morning paper and turn on the evening news. Such localism permits the coverage in local papers and stations to more truly reflect the communities they serve Mr. Chairman, I ask that my full statement be made part of the record. [The prepared statement of Senator Inouye follows:] Prepared Statement of Hon. Daniel K. Inouye, U.S. Senator from Hawaii I want to commend Chairman Hollings for holding this important hearing. It is past time for the Commerce Committee to examine the vitally important issues of consolidation in the broadcast and newspaper industries, and I look forward to the debate over these topics on today&#x27;s panels. Over a decade ago, I chaired similar hearings in this Committee. The tale told then was much like the one we&#x27;ll hear today. The marketplace has changed, our business is getting tougher and tougher to run in the modern economy. Competition is undermining our profits, and without relief, there may be fewer outlets to provide Americans with quality news and programming. In short--let us combine so we can compete, and if we can compete, news and programming will improve along the way. I wish I were convinced. Last year, all four networks turned a profit. And I understand the newspaper industry continues to generate profits at a pace greater than many American industries. We must be exceedingly cautious before we give in to industry&#x27;s claims that absent regulatory relief, their businesses will suffer. In many ways, these companies occupy a public trust. Broadcasters through their grant of free spectrum, inform the public of local and nationally relevant news and information. Newspapers do the same. The ownership restrictions that limit aggregation of these businesses are premised on the need to protect that public trust. The ownership restrictions help preserve diversity of ownership and viewpoints both nationally and market by market. In turn, that diversity enhances a vibrant localism, that keeps our citizens informed when they pick up the morning paper or turn on the evening news. Such localism permits the coverage in local papers and stations to more truly reflect the communities they serve. Without these ownership restrictions, I believe that diversity and localism would suffer. I believe that these businesses would do what I would do--maximize returns to the detriment of our public discourse--by reducing costs, promoting efficiencies and synergies, re-running the same stories and repurposing the same news and information. There is nothing wrong with that. It&#x27;s the American way. But that profit motive is in conflict with another American value-- the exchange of ideas and information that informs our cultural and political debate. Accordingly, we have for years had reasonable restrictions that prevented a single owner from exercising undue power over that debate: nationally, we have prevented the networks from owning too many stations. And locally, we restrict the joint ownership of stations and newspapers. These rules make sense to me. That is why I look forward to co- sponsoring legislation with Chairman Hollings and Senator Dorgan to bring some sense to this debate, by requiring the FCC to explain to the Committee how relaxing the ownership limits will serve the public interest. I expect some of today&#x27;s witnesses to feel differently about these issues. I look forward to the debate. The Chairman. It will be included in the record. Senator Wyden. STATEMENT OF HON. RON WYDEN, U.S. SENATOR FROM OREGON Senator Wyden. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Chairman I want to commend you because I think you are holding hearings on an extraordinarily important subject and I just want to walk through briefly an example of what could happen if all of these rules on media consolidation are lifted. You are correct in noting that there are some in this country who are saying let us just throw them all out the window. If that was the case, you could have AOL/Time Warner going out and buying AT&amp;T Cable, which would give it a huge percentage of the Nation&#x27;s cable market. That new entity could go out and buy NBC if all the rules were lifted, and then start snapping up individual television and radio stations until they had a nationwide chain with a very large presence in most major markets. That new, very large entity then could go out and buy Gannett, giving them newspapers in many of the same markets where they already control cable, broadcast TV, and radio. My concern, Mr. Chairman, and why I think your hearings are so important, is that if you just went out and lifted all these rules as some have proposed, you could have on our watch the most radical media consolidation in this country&#x27;s history and so I think it is important that we take the time to think through the ramifications of this possibility, and that is why I think your hearings are so important and I look forward to working with you and our colleagues to examine these questions. The Chairman. Very good. Senator Kerry. STATEMENT OF HON. JOHN F. KERRY, U.S. SENATOR FROM MASSACHUSETTS Senator Kerry. Mr. Chairman, thank you for having these hearings. Let me just very briefly say that we have been through this a number of times in the last years, 1996 most recently. We saw the ownership shifted to the 35 percent from the 25. And we have seen the shift from sort of the finite number of stations to a percentage of national audience, and I think that shift reflected a change in the marketplace itself and in our perceptions of it. Like Senator McCain, I think I would observe that the marketplace has changed even further very significantly in a lot of different ways, and all of us understand that this fight, to a large degree, is over advertising revenues, and the structure by which local affiliates are able to make their pitch and what kind of package they can present versus the consolidated packages that other larger, more diverse entities are able to present. Our interest, I think, Mr. Chairman, has to still remain to the question of protecting people&#x27;s access to diversity in information, and there is a principle of localism which you have very articulately and forcefully advocated both in your letter to the FCC and otherwise here this morning. I agree with that fundamental concept of both the diversity and localism. On the other hand, I think it is appropriate for this Committee at this juncture to be analyzing whether or not that marketplace has changed in a way that the mix is different, in the way in which diversity may be protected currently, or the way in which people will have access to information, which is obviously on its face so different from the original broadcast structure that we sought to protect when the principle was first established. We do notice, however, that there has been this extraordinary media consolidation: AOL purchasing Time Warner, Viacom, CBS; News Corp. presently trying to get 10 television stations from Chris Kraft, so that in the television broadcast industry, you have got, I think, the percentage of commercial television stations controlled by the largest 25 groups has climbed from 25 percent to 45 percent since passage of the 1996 Act. But none of that, none of those percentages adequately reflect the other kinds of changes that have taken place in how people have accessed information, what information they have available to them. I have a sense this issue is probably going to be decided either by the FCC or the courts because I think they may do so faster than we are capable of, but it is entirely appropriate that we look at it, and examine whether or not any of those changes in the marketplace currently and in the way people get information mandate that we perhaps think differently about how we are measuring what the impact in diversity and localism really is and how it is best protected. So I think it is appropriate that we are measuring today, and apologize to the witnesses and to my colleagues. We have a markup on two trade bills in the Finance Committee in about 10 minutes, so I can&#x27;t be here for all the testimony, but I will try to come back. The Chairman. Very good. Senator Burns. STATEMENT OF HON. CONRAD BURNS, U.S. SENATOR FROM MONTANA Senator Burns. I would just ask that my statement be made part of the record, and I will listen to the witnesses before I make up my mind. [The prepared statement of Senator Burns follows:] Prepared Statementof Hon. Conrad Burns, U.S. Senator from Montana Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I thank the Chairman for calling the hearing on media consolidation today. This is certainly a topic that warrants the Committee&#x27;s full and serious attention. I would first like to touch on the debate surrounding the current 35 percent national cap on broadcast ownership. I strongly support the current cap, which was raised from 25 percent as part of the 1996 Telecommunications Act. Many argue that the increasing variety of consumer choices for video programming renders the need for any restrictions on broadcast ownership obsolete. It is true that the array of multichannel video media has increased significantly. Currently, many consumers can choose from direct satellite, cable or even the Interent for video programming. However, even when consumers do have this variety of video distribution to choose from, many of these competing technologies are not true alternatives to locally based programming. For rural consumers in particular, alternatives increasingly exist only between different national distribution networks. Free, local, over-the-air television broadcasting still serves a vital and unique role in providing community information. The ability to receive local television signals is more than just having access to local sports or entertainment programming. It is a critical and immediate way to receive important local news, weather and community information. Additionally, natural tensions exist between the desire of networks to maximize national audiences and the sensitivities of local affiliates to their specific audiences. I am very concerned that any lifting of the cap would significantly increase the leverage the networks currently have in negotiations with their. affiliates and lower the degree of flexibility that stations have in providing local programming. In a drastically different course of events than has taken place in the video marketplace, the number of daily newspapers in the country has plummeted significantly in recent years. Since 1975, the year the ban on newspaper broadcast cross-ownership was instituted by the FCC, the number of daily newspapers has declined from nearly 1,800 to roughly 1,500. If community-based newspapers are to survive, they must be given the option to increase 3 efficiencies by entering into co- ownership with local broadcast stations. The Commission&#x27;s outdated position on cross-ownership is of great concern to me, particularly given its failure to offer a substantive, objective analysis of the actual effect of the cross-ownership ban in the current media marketplace. Even though the previous Commission announced a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking on the cross-ownership restriction as a result of its 1998 biennial review, nothing ever happened. I understand that the new Commission plans to rectify this situation and I plan to follow developments in this critical area with great interest. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I look forward to the testimony of today&#x27;s witnesses. The Chairman. Very good. That is a change. Senator Burns. Minority status does that. The Chairman. Senator Cleland. STATEMENT OF HON. MAX CLELAND, U.S. SENATOR FROM GEORGIA Senator Cleland. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I understand that antitrust is defined as, ``opposing or intending to regulate business monopolies such as trusts or cartels, especially in the interest of promoting competition.&#x27;&#x27; Well, these Federal laws that we are talking about were created to protect American citizens from the concentration of power in too few hands and govern all industries. While these laws are enforced by the Department of Justice, there are often other agencies involved in merger reviews with the responsibility of examining aspects other than antitrust, but complimentary to the merger review. With regard to broadcasting mergers the FCC has an appropriate role of reviewing of broadcast license transfers to ensure they are in the public interest. Essentially, regulations and laws like ownership caps are designed to be additional protections for the public. In this case, these regulations promote a diverse and free exchange of ideas. When one entity reaches 35 percent of the Nation&#x27;s homes, is that enough to attract the attention of antitrust officials? Maybe not. But this single entity is now able to reach millions of homes. In this case, I believe that the law limiting broadcast ownership enables and promotes diversity, above that of antitrust review by itself. However, I can certainly understand why a group would want to exceed this cap. According to Kevin Saunter in the broadcast television industry book, the profit margin for network-owned and operated stations can still reach an amazing 25 percent or more which translates into yearly profits that can be in the tens of millions of dollars, a significant amount for networks struggling with decreasing viewership and increasing costs. The FCC as the guardian of the public&#x27;s interest and the public&#x27;s manager of radio spectrum owes the American public an appropriate review of the transfer of broadcast licenses. Although multichannel service providers have increased the number of outlets people can turn to for video information and entertainment, about 20 percent of Americans still remain dependent on free over-the-air television for their information. This portion of the population should not be overlooked when contemplating removing or increasing the cap. I support the continuation of the FCC&#x27;s biennial review of the broadcast ownership cap and the newspaper broadcast ownership cap as they have been directed. Although relaxation of these two caps has been rejected up to this point, I will be watching closely for the results of the FCC&#x27;s next review. Given the relaxation of the duopoly rules, I believe we will be able to see more clearly the potential for greater consolidation. Antitrust officials play an important role in our economy, however, there are additional factors that might be overlooked if other agencies are removed from the merger review process. When we are discussing the precious and finite commodity of our national spectrum, I believe it is appropriate for the FCC to examine these mergers. I also believe due deference should be given to its decisions. I look forward to the Commission&#x27;s continuing examination of ownership rules, keeping in mind that every regulation should be continued to be examined for its rlevance in this ever-changing world. Thank you, Mr. Chairman The Chairman. Thank you. Senator Dorgan. STATEMENT OF HON. BYRON L. DORGAN, U.S. SENATOR FROM NORTH DAKOTA Senator Dorgan. Mr. Chairman, thank you very much. I apologize. I was at a leadership meeting and I missed your opening statement, which I am sure would have been illuminating for me. The Chairman. I did mention your amendment. Don&#x27;t you remember, when we voted with respect to change of ownership. Only by 2 votes did we have the 35. Senator Dorgan. In 1996, when the Committee reported out a bill that expanded the audience cap to 35 percent, I believe, and I offered an amendment on the floor of the Senate which about 4 o&#x27;clock in the afternoon prevailed, Senator Dole was on the other side and I actually prevailed and I was the most surprised man in Washington, DC., and then I believe Senator D&#x27;Amato changed his vote at the request of Senator Dole so that they can reconsider it, and then dinner intervened and several Senators had some sort of an epiphany over their dinner and we had a revote about 4 hours later, and I ended up losing. Such is the work of the Senate, well within the rules, I might add. But I felt the need to offer the amendment at that time because I worried about what was going to happen. Even then I was worried about what was happening, but we have had since then as you know an orgy of mergers in this industry. I think in 1996, the largest radio ownership group had 39 stations. Now, 1100 stations-plus. What&#x27;s happening in broadcast, in my judgment, is unhealthy. There are competing interests. The private interests of those who are engaged in this and they have every right to hold that interest and want to become big and big and bigger, and the public interest, and I would say to the FCC, and I hope they pay some attention to this hearing, Mr. Chairman, I am pleased you are holding the hearing, the question of whether we ought to have ownership limits and the question of whether caring about localism is some old-fashioned anachronism is a very important question. I answer it one way. Some others might answer it another way. But I feel very strongly about it. The FCC has a responsibility to us, a responsibility to this country to understand that these airways belong to the American people and that localism is not some old-fashioned notion about what we ought to have as a public policy, and I think the burden--the FCC somehow seems to suggest the burden is on the Congress to demonstrate why there should be limits. That is not the case at all in my judgment. The burden ought to be on the FCC and the broadcasters to demonstrate why the limits ought to be increased. In my judgment, there is no basis and no case that can be made to increase these broadcast limits. If anything, we ought to go back to the 1996 limits. But I fear that that horse is long out of the barn. Mr. Chairman, thank you for calling these hearings. They are very important. The Chairman. Thank you. Senator Fitzgerald. STATEMENT OF HON. PETER G. FITZGERALD, U.S. SENATOR FROM ILLINOIS Senator Fitzgerald. Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman. I would like to welcome one of my constituents, Mr. Jack Fuller, who is from Evanston, Illinois and President of the Tribune Company. The Tribune, in addition to owning newspapers and television stations, is the owner of the Chicago Cubs, a great baseball team, and they are doing very well this year and I hope we can have a World Series at least sometime this century. The Cubs have not won a World Series since 1908. Anybody can have a bad century, I guess, in Chicago. Senator Burns. Seven years ahead of time. Senator Fitzgerald. But anyway, I am glad that the Chairman has called this hearing. I think it is an important issue. I do agree that the public owns the airwaves. I do have questions, however, as to whether the ownership restrictions make sense in today&#x27;s current climate, where you have so many media outlets, so many cable television stations and so many satellite TV channels and so many radio and other broadcast outlets, so I look forward to this hearing as far as going into depth and exploring the issue. I do wonder whether the restrictions that date back to the late 1940s or 1946, when there were only three broadcast networks around the country, continue to make sense. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for holding this hearing. The Chairman. Thank you. In presenting these witnesses, let me make it as part of the record, unless there is objection, the Columbia Journalism Review ownership listing of Viacom&#x27;s assets, and the Columbia Journalism Review ownership listing of Tribune&#x27;s assets. I was just trying to summarize. For example, Viacom has got 19 Paramount stations; and the MTV networks, Nickelodeon channels, Showtime Networks, eight channels; Black Entertainment Television with six channels; and Paramount production and distribution and right on down--and publishing, CBS television ownership of some 17 stations there. In radio, it is just too much to count. I counted 40 different cities, and there are several radio stations in each city.

So, but excuse me, Mr. Karmazin, you are behind Tribune. You got to play catch-up ball with the Tribune. I am putting them in there also. Let me present and introduce Mr. Mel Karmazin, the President and Chief Operating Officer of Viacom; Mr. Alan Frank, the Chief Executive Officer of Post- Newsweek Stations; Jack Fuller, President of Tribune Publishing; William Baker, President of WNET in New York. The Committee is indebted to each of you for coming. Mr. Karmazin, we will start with you, sir. STATEMENT OF MEL KARMAZIN, PRESIDENT AND CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER, VIACOM, INC. Mr. Karmazin. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Senator McCain and other Members. I really appreciate the opportunity to be here today. I did not think you wanted to hear what I was going to say. I am sorry. The Chairman. I would love to hear what you are going to say. If I were running CBS, I&#x27;d hire you this afternoon, so do not worry about that. Mr. Karmazin. By way of background, I do go back a long time in the broadcasting business. I went to work in 1967 for Mr. Paley&#x27;s CBS and had as mentors Mr. Paley and John Kluge. Both of those fine broadcasters. And, I like to call myself a broadcaster who has talked about localism and diversity, so let there be no mistake; obviously we are very interested, as are all of our television stations and all of our radio stations in localism, and certainly are prepared to demonstrate our localism in our communities, whichever community you are sitting with, as compared to any other broadcaster, whether or not they live in the market or do not live in the market. Certainly, localism and diversity are something that we think is very important. I&#x27;d like to go back to those days, by the way, if you can mandate it, to where there were only three networks, and the diversity was just those three. So I do not think that, Senator as you said, the horse left the barn. But I think those days are gone. When I first started in the business, there were three networks, 9 out of 10 people watched prime time on network television. The average viewer had seven television stations available to them, and there was no VCR. Today, the three networks, together in prime time, have less than 35 percent of the audience on television. The average home has 54 channels available to them. There are VCRs in almost 90 percent or actually over 90 percent of the country. There are items like TiVo and UltimateTV and the Internet. But even more important than what&#x27;s here today, is there are more choices coming and the changes are going to be even more dramatic. There is going to be available very soon in every car, satellite radio, so that you will be able to receive 100 radio stations in your car here in Washington, DC. in CD quality, controlled by one company. It will be a subscription service, so the American public is going to have to pay to receive those 100 different radio stations and we, free over- the-air broadcasting, are going to have to compete with them. There is also, if you follow what&#x27;s going on with technology, the Internet which is also going to be available in your car. Internet access is available today on your PDA. It is available on your cell phone. It is going to be available in your car. There are 4,000 radio stations on the Internet that you are going to be able to reach in your home or you are going to be able to reach in your car, and the whole world is changing. Technology is changing dramatically. We are not just in a vacuum. Consolidation is taking place in every industry, so we are now competing to get advertising dollars from banks that are consolidating. We are competing to get advertising revenue from airlines that are consolidating. Our advertisers have consolidated. There are fewer and fewer of them, as have the advertising agencies consolidated. And that consolidation is continuing. You mentioned earlier AOL/Time Warner, and alluded to the possibility that AT&amp;T might do a transaction and possibly AT&amp;T could do a transaction with Comcast. And it is possible that DirecTV, which has access into 100 percent of the homes in America, might even combine with News Corp., so we are not sitting here suggesting those things should not be allowed to take place. They are wrong to take place. But in order for us to compete against them, we need to have a stronger, free over-the-air broadcasting system and I believe that we need to see changes that have to be made in order to be able to have a fair seat at the table with these companies that have consolidated. A lot has been said about radio consolidation so let us talk about that. There is a little over 10,000 radio stations in the United States. One company, not ours, owns a little bit over 1,000. That is 10 percent of the stations, so the largest company in this industry owns 10 percent. To some people, that might seem like a lot. To me, it is not Microsoft, as far as a consolidated position in this country. But the effect of consolidation has not been less diversity, it has been more. To take Washington, DC., the same number of radio stations exist today that existed in the past. Fewer operators, more programming choices. There are far more programming choices available today to the people of Washington than existed prior to the 1996 Telecommunications Act. I think that consolidation, deregulation has been good for the American public. I think we need to see the world where we can own two networks. We are channel 350 on DirecTV. We are channel 20-something here in Washington on some cable systems. We are on another channel with DishTV. There needs to be consolidation on the network side of things. We need to see that 35 percent arbitrary cap removed so that we can make money on our TV stations, so we can bid for programming, so we can afford to keep good programming on free over-the-air broadcasting, and we need to see further deregulation in the radio industry to compete with the technology that is satellite. If somebody is concerned about too much concentration, for 30 years, I have been dealing with the Justice Department. They are pretty good at doing their job, and obviously there is a mechanism for unfair consolidation or too much consolidation. I see my time is up, so thank you. [The prepared statement of Mr. Karmazin follows:] Prepared Statement of Mel Karmazin, President and Chief Operating Officer, Viacom, Inc. Good morning, Chairman Hollings, Senator McCain, and Members of the Committee. I am Mel Karmazin, President and Chief Operating Officer of Viacom. Thank you for this opportunity to testify before you today on the topic of media consolidation and broadcast ownership. Instead of ``media consolidation,&#x27;&#x27; I prefer to call it ``media competition,&#x27;&#x27; because that&#x27;s what consumers are enjoying today. Over the last decade, consumers have reaped the benefits of a tremendous amount of change in the media industry: the meteoric growth of cable, the explosion of the Internet, the expansion of broadcast networks from four to at least nine, the birth of DBS, and the proliferation of new media devices, such as cell phones and personal digital assistants, which are allowing consumers to access information when and how they want it. It is no coincidence that this enormous growth in content and distribution platforms has taken place during a time of consolidation in our industry. Horizontal and vertical combination is businesses&#x27; response to consumers&#x27; ever-multiplying demands for more information and entertainment tailored to their lives. Given today&#x27;s marketplace, we have seen content providers expand to keep up with the change: This personalization of information and entertainment is made economically possible through mergers, such as that between Viacom and CBS last year. Scale allows companies to accept risks associated with spiraling costs of programming, from the cost of talent to sports rights, and other costs, such as those required to market, brand and promote our products. And scale in the broadcast business brings consumers, for free, greater entertainment, sports and news programming choices than ever before. If we are to understand the media industry, we cannot examine it in a vacuum. Because what happens in other industries unquestionably affects us in the media, particularly at companies like Viacom, where half of our revenues depend on advertising. As airlines merge, as banks merge, as consumer product companies merge, the number of our advertising customers also declines. Where before, for example, our company might have approached Airline X, Airline Y, and Airline Z as separate advertisers, we now have one fewer client and, as a result, one fewer source of advertising revenue. And, today, the agencies that represent the Nation&#x27;s advertisers have also declined, meaning that mergers in that industry have forced us in the media to negotiate with only a handful of firms for a crucial part of our business. In a world where AOL and Time Warner can combine, where Comcast may end up owning AT&amp;T&#x27;s cable systems, and where News Corporation could control DirecTV, it is ironic that today&#x27;s hearing focuses largely on maintaining harmful restrictions on the only news and information medium that remains free to all Americans--broadcasting. Right or wrong, subscription-based cable MSOs and DBS providers are permitted to operate without the myriad ownership restrictions that hinder broadcasters. Yet, in a cruel twist of fate, these pay television services rely on broadcast television as a key component of their offerings: some 80 percent of Americans now tune into their broadcast television stations through their cable or satellite provider. Thus, while the services that require American consumers to pay fees for access to them continue to consolidate largely unchecked, broadcasters, of which we are a proud member, face the prospect of being more and more marginalized. Television and radio broadcasting are the only media today that remain hamstrung by rules governing ownership--of television and radio stations locally and nationwide and of broadcast television networks--in ways that are far more onerous than those affecting their competitors. Despite the hyper-competitive state of the television industry, it is bewildering and astounding that there is a debate raging anew here in Washington over the limits on national broadcast television station ownership, which currently prohibit a group owner from reaching more than 35 percent of television households. Some, including the broadcast networks (ABC, CBS, Fox and NBC), want these limits pared back or repealed. Others, including some of the largest media conglomerates in the United States (such as Post-Newsweek, Cox, Belo and Hearst-Argyle), which count among their holdings broadcast network-affiliated television stations, as well as newspapers, cable systems and radio stations, are fighting hard to retain the status quo. The proponents of the status quo in this debate are clearly motivated by an overwhelming fear that their television business is changing and that freezing ownership at today&#x27;s levels is the panacea. But we all must recognize that the broadcast business is dramatically changing all around us: Our audiences are dwindling, our margins are contracting and our share of advertising revenues is declining. The impact on consumers, who should be central to this debate, do not benefit from the status quo when it is irrational, anticompetitive, and an obstacle to expanded choice. After all, it is change and deregulation that have brought about the almost dizzying array of video and audio options Americans enjoy today. History instructs us that the fear of change is best confronted with a generous helping of flexibility and an invigorating dose of innovation. For instance, take the radio industry in the early 1940s, when many feared that a gadget called television would steal away its audience. Well, the coming of television did affect the radio business, but not in the way those fearful of change imagined. Instead, innovative managers prodded radio to recreate itself in the face of television&#x27;s competitive threat, changing it over time from a center- of-the-living room, sit-down form of entertainment to one that went with consumers as they pursued their daily activities. And, as such, radio prospered as never before. Or look at the broadcast television industry in the 1950s, when it, in turn, feared a new technology that took TV station signals and delivered them by cable to homes too far away to receive them over the air. Broadcasters fought the new technology because they saw it as a threat to free, over-the-air television and localism. Yet, today, more consumers are able to watch over-the-air television stations with a clear, sharp picture than would ever have been possible using rooftop antennas and rabbit ears. And over-the-air television stations have profited as a result. History teaches us that change is uncomfortable and unnerving to both government and business as we all undergo the turbulence of moving from the older to the newer technologies. But in the end, when the change has occurred, we see that consumers have benefited from the upheaval because they have been empowered as never before. With hundreds and hundreds of programming choices available at their fingertips, consumers are the final arbiters of which of these services will succeed and which will fail. Change is something my company deals with day after day. At Viacom, our broadcast networks, our cable networks, our video rental business, our publishing arm, our movie studio, and our radio stations are all by necessity constantly practicing the arts of futurism and prognostication, trying to figure out the next new technologies, trends, and regulatory schemes, and strategizing as to how we will adapt our business models to keep them relevant in any given new environment. Obviously, Viacom is not alone. Any business that is to survive must be three steps ahead of the curve or risk obsolescence. This includes big media companies with newspaper and television interests like Belo, Cox, Hearst-Argyle and others, which have been pushing for relaxation of the current restrictions on common ownership of a daily newspaper and a television station in the same community as one way to realize necessary economies in the face of the continuing decline in newspaper circulation. These companies advocating for a liberalization of local restrictions are, of course, the very same ones fighting deregulation of television ownership on a nationwide basis. I empathize with the frustration of these newspaper conglomerates-- deregulation is important for each of our businesses. But the common ownership of two television stations and of multiple radio stations in a local market consolidates advertising revenues far less so than the combination of a daily newspaper and a television station in one market. Thus, lifting the newspaper limit should occur only after the national television cap is lifted, the dual network rule is modified and the local ownership limits on television and radio are relaxed. It is these latter changes that promise greater benefits to ensure the future viability of the free delivery of entertainment, news and information to the American public. Over the last decade alone, a worldwide technological tsunami has crashed upon the world, flooding the broadcast industry with competition in unprecedented proportions. Broadcast radio now competes head-to-head with Internet radio websites that offer customized music, sports and news. Where offices once turned on a radio for background music, individual employees are now ``tuning in&#x27;&#x27; to favorite websites on their PCs for their all-day listening pleasure. And one day soon, when wireless Internet access is ubiquitous, people driving in their cars may opt to listen to radio websites instead of their local broadcast radio stations. Satellite radio, which has been in the planning stages for years and is just now launching, is a new form of ``radio&#x27;&#x27; which will provide a subscriber with not just one program format as do traditional radio stations, but a whole range of them. Unlike traditional radio, which can reach only as far as a terrestrial broadcast signal, the new technology will let drivers travel far and wide without ever losing the clear reception of these satellite ``stations.&#x27;&#x27; As for broadcast television, it competes directly with cable, which was originally created only to serve as a conduit for broadcast signals. That service, subscribed to by nearly 70 percent of the country&#x27;s households, has developed into a multi-channel video programming distribution platform that not only carries hundreds of cable networks but serves as a high-speed gateway to the Internet and the literally millions of websites that offer personalized entertainment, news, weather and sports. The World Wide Web itself, born around 1994, spawned nearly three million sites from 1999 to 2000 alone. Direct broadcast satellite, another competitor to broadcast television, delivers hundreds of crisp digital programming channels to more than 10 percent of the country and also offers high-speed Internet access. In 1996, Congress fully recognized this formidable competition to broadcasters when it passed the Telecommunications Act. Among other deregulatory actions, that law eliminated all limits on the national ownership of radio stations, raised from 25 percent to 35 percent the national ownership limit on television stations while deleting the numerical cap of 12 stations, and mandated that the FCC review broadcast ownership rules every 2 years. Those who fear the further deregulation of television often point to the state of broadcast radio ownership in an attempt to paint a bleak picture of media concentration. In so doing, they note that the largest radio station group owns some 1,200 stations, that this group and a handful of others control a large portion of the radio advertising market, and that stations in these groups play the same programming formats from central feeds in their distant, big-city headquarters. While their raw numbers are accurate, they give a completely misleading picture of a radio industry that is in reality vibrantly competitive and is certainly more diverse than the industry serving consumers in the pre-Telecommunications Act era. There are more than 10,500 commercial AM and FM radio stations in this country, so the top group owns only about 11.4 percent. The fourth largest radio group in terms of numbers, Viacom&#x27;s Infinity radio division, owns 184 stations, representing a mere 1.7 percent of all commercial radio stations. The audience for the average radio station in this country is miniscule. And, the radio advertising market is so small--totaling only about 8.5 percent of all ad expenditures nationwide across all media (newspapers, magazines, billboard, Internet, cable, television, etc.)--that even if a single entity owned every radio station in the country, it still would control only a small portion of the advertising pie. In fact, under an antitrust review, one owner could not buy every radio station nationwide, because there would be limits on the number of outlets that that party could own on a local basis. Newspapers, by the way, still garner about 21 percent of total ad spending. And what of the argument that ownership consolidation limits the diversity of formats? No basis in fact whatsoever. That is because the multiple owner seeks to diversify formats in order to garner the widest cross-section of listeners. All we need do is look at the radio scene here in Washington&#x27;s own backyard to see this theory spun into practice. In 1993, the 53 commercial and noncommercial radio stations in the Washington, D.C. market were owned by 39 licensees, who offered 19 different formats. Today, 5 years after the Telecommunications Act&#x27;s liberalization of the radio ownership rules, these 53 stations are owned by fewer licensees-- 27 to be exact. But these 27 offer more formats: 22 instead of 19, a nearly 16 percent increase. Radio listeners in Washington can now tune in to a Korean language station, a Mexican station, two ethnic stations, a full-time smooth jazz station and a business news station, none of which was available 8 years ago or so. Consumers in Columbia and Greenville, South Carolina enjoy even more diversity of formats--about 45-58 percent more than they could choose from before passage of the Telecommunications Act. Since 1993, the number of owners of radio stations in Columbia has decreased from 20 to 13, but the number of formats has increased from 11 to 16, including seven new formats and one new Spanish-language station. In Greenville in the same time period, the number of owners has gone from 27 to 23, but the number of formats has gone from 12 to 19, including ten new formats and two new Spanish-language stations. Radio programming, in short, has become more--not less--diverse, and consumers enjoy the fruits of Congress&#x27; deregulatory efforts. Moreover, broadcast radio is now better poised to compete with the new substitutes of the Internet and satellite radio. As in the case of radio, we must parse the naysayers&#x27; arguments against deregulation of the national television ownership cap. Their primary contention, intended to incite fear among policymakers, is that localism will fall if the cap is lifted. Major media companies such as Cox, Belo and Hearst-Argyle--headquartered in Atlanta, Dallas and New York, respectively--each operates tens of stations in markets very far flung from their home bases. Yet, somehow these huge media companies shamelessly argue that they are ``local&#x27;&#x27; in every market where they own a television station while we are not. This pretzel logic does not end there. These same companies further contend that because CBS, for example, has its headquarters in New York, the stations it owns in other markets cannot be ``local,&#x27;&#x27; and decisions about local news and information must be orchestrated from corporate offices in New York. This despite the fact that CBS&#x27;s local station in Boston is just as ``local&#x27;&#x27; as the station owned in that market by New York-based Hearst- Argyle. In fact, all we need do is look at a sampling of states to see that television stations in only a minority of cases are even owned by companies headquartered in the same state. In Massachusetts, of the 13 commercial television stations licensed there, none is owned by a Massachusetts broadcaster. Of the 14 television stations in West Virginia, two are owned by in-state broadcasters. And in Kansas, only one of the 11 television stations is owned by a Kansas broadcaster. The real story is that CBS, like every other broadcaster, knows that localism is what makes broadcasting unique and a worthy competitor in the burgeoning video programming marketplace. While offering local news and public affairs programming may make us good citizens, it is also no secret to networks, group owners and individual station owners that local programming is a key competitive advantage that attracts viewers and differentiates broadcast television from cable channels, which are distributed nationally. CBS&#x27; owned-and-operated stations individually determine how much news they will air, what stories they will run and when they air them. As with our Infinity radio stations, there is no corporate dictator in New York who orchestrates the stations&#x27; local news programs. In fact, it&#x27;s quite the opposite. Our stations&#x27; news directors have complete freedom locally. This is a fundamental CBS policy. And it is good business. On average, each of our CBS stations airs 25 hours of local news and public affairs programming each week, with actual amounts in some markets surpassing every other station. And our stations do not flinch from covering stories of local interest, even if it means preempting network programming. Just this past May in Minneapolis, for example, our WCCO-TV preempted 3 hours of primetime network programming to run an emergency weather newscast. For the past 20 years, WBZ, our Boston station, has preempted primetime network shows to air the Boston Children&#x27;s Hospital Telethon. WBZ also aired complete coverage of Congressman Joe Moakley&#x27;s funeral, preempting programming from 10 a.m. through 4:30 p.m. Many of CBS&#x27;s general managers, news directors and other staff were raised in the communities where they work and, as a result, know these communities intimately. For example, Peter Brown, the news director of WBZ in Boston was born in Newton, Massachusetts and has worked at our station for 19 years as of this Labor Day, having worked his way up the ranks. And Brian Jones, the general manager of KTVT in Dallas, graduated from Plano High School, attended the University of Texas and has spent all of his working life in the state. He has been with KTVT for 14 years and started there as the station&#x27;s national sales manager. In addition to covering local events, our stations heavily participate in public service activities. For example, for the past 10 years, KPIX in San Francisco and, for the past 20 years, WBZ in Boston, have separately aired an adoption series that features local children in need of adoption. The KPIX series has led to the adoption of 86 percent of the children featured. As with radio, consolidation in the television industry can result in significant benefits to the consumer. Viacom&#x27;s merger with CBS brought under one roof a group of television stations affiliated with UPN and a group affiliated with CBS, with overlap in six markets. In five of these duopoly markets, we are airing or are about to launch half-hour newscasts or hourly updates on stations where none existed. As a result, diversity has expanded in Boston, Dallas, Detroit, Miami and Pittsburgh, where viewers now have access to more unique local news, weather and sports. The ``localism-is-dead&#x27;&#x27; issue, therefore, is a transparent distraction from the affiliates&#x27; true fear: the inevitable change to the broadcast business model which has in the past delivered to affiliates a steady, now unrealistic level of revenue. Under the traditional business model over the past few decades, networks have not only provided affiliates with a multi-billion dollar schedule of entertainment, sports, news and public affairs--all free of charge--but also cash compensation for carrying that programming. This in addition to the commercial positions within network programming which are made available to affiliated stations to sell for their own account, producing advertising revenues over and above those which they receive from the sale of time during non-network programming--revenues which go straight to the bottom line. Look behind the dust being kicked up in Washington by affiliates and what you see is a bold request for government creation of a world where the network bears the entire risk and expense of developing programming with no countervailing obligations on affiliates--such as simply fulfilling their contractual commitments to air this programming. If the affiliates get their way, the public will not, because networks will be discouraged from engaging in the even more expensive and riskier enterprise of creating new shows the public wants. The broadcast network makes money through only one source, the sale of national advertising. Compare this single-revenue business model to the dual revenue stream of cable networks, with whom broadcast networks compete: A cable network relies on ad sales, too, but is also paid by cable operators for carriage of its programming--the exact opposite of the relationship which prevails between broadcast networks and their affiliates. Moreover, while the ``Big 4&#x27;&#x27; broadcast networks are prohibited from combining, cable networks are subject to absolutely no ownership restrictions. Broadcast networks, which provide programming free to consumers and are limited by regulation in what other television stations or networks they can own, cannot continue to compete based on these old and outdated paradigms. When the profits made by the top 15 cable networks dwarf the earnings of their over-the-air competitors, it is unrealistic to continue to restrict combinations between broadcast networks when no such restriction exists for cable networks. And when the profit margins of network-affiliated stations are several multiples of those of the networks that supply most of their programming, it is unrealistic and unfair to artificially restrict the number of local stations that the networks themselves can own to amortize their enormous programming costs. With fewer viewers watching more expensive broadcast television programming and advertisers unwilling to spend more to pay for it, broadcasters must be permitted to participate in the economies of scale enjoyed by their competitors. For example, in addition to its operations in New York, CBS News staffs bureaus around the world to produce network news. If our company were able to own and operate another major broadcast network, we could use the combined resources to operate more efficiently and to provide more news more often on both networks--to all Americans and still free of charge. Even with two such networks under one roof, the combined ratings and advertising revenues would not come close to dominating the literally hundreds of remaining television programming competitors. Maybe it&#x27;s the golden years of television that opponents of relaxing the national broadcast television station ownership cap really yearn for. And why not? Life was easier then for the few of us in the media business. Even in 1976, in the afterglow of those golden years, CBS, along with the only other broadcast networks at the time, ABC and NBC, claimed nine out of 10 viewers each night. The average home at that time had seven channels to choose from. And the VCR was not commercially available. That is a status quo any business would want to preserve. Nostalgia may make us feel better for a time, but neither time nor technology stand still. Almost 5 years later, in 1980, there were 734 television stations, 21 percent of all homes subscribed to cable, 16 national cable networks existed, and the average home received nine channels of programming. In 1991, Americans could select from 33 channels of programming, the broadcast networks had lost one-third of their audience, and VCRs were in 70 percent of all homes. Today, there are 1,663 TV stations, 9 broadcast networks, 70 percent of all homes subscribe to cable and another 10 percent pay for DBS. There are 281 national cable networks and the average home receives 54 channels of programming. A viewer can tune into several all-news cable channels, both national (such as CNN, MSNBC and the Fox News Channel) and regional (such as NY1 News in New York and News Channel 8 in Washington). Or a viewer can choose to watch an all-golf channel, an all-cooking channel, or an all-history channel. Or, perhaps, check in on the deliberations of this Committee on C-SPAN. And then there is the Internet, a medium none of us can ignore. According to the Pew Research Center, as many Americans--33 percent--receive their news from online sources as from broadcast networks. For younger people, the trend toward new media sources for news and information is even more pronounced: more college graduates under the age of 50 receive news from the Internet than from television news. As a result of this robust competition, six of the broadcast networks today, the ``Big Three&#x27;&#x27; plus Fox, the WB and UPN, jointly garner only about 35 percent of TV households in prime time. Although the population of the United States has grown significantly, fewer people watched the final episode of Seinfeld in 1998 than watched the final episode of M*A*S*H in 1983. Whereas broadcast network television was once the common experience that bound the nation, it is now just one of a myriad of television programming choices. In the aftershock of such seismic growth in competition, all broadcasters, networks and affiliates alike, should embrace change and join in advocating rules changes that will put us at regulatory parity with our competitors and help to preserve free, over-the-air television as a vibrant part of our remarkable media marketplace. Let&#x27;s start with the fact that the 35 percent cap imposed on broadcast television is an unrealistic and arbitrary limit. Limiting broadcast television ownership doesn&#x27;t affect competition or diversity in any market at all. Viewers watch stations only in their local markets, and consolidation in different markets has no impact on competition. Congress in its wisdom has always understood that regulatory regimes must move in synch with the dynamism of competition. In the Telecommunications Act of 1996, Congress directed the FCC to review its rules on a biennial basis to ``determine whether any of such rules are necessary to the public interest as a result of competition.&#x27;&#x27; Given the undeniably robust State of competition in the video marketplace today, it is unjustifiable that television broadcasters continue to be unfairly impaired by an onerous regulatory regime attached to no other telecommunications segment. Instead, television broadcasters must be positioned to withstand economic challenges, as businesses are now experiencing in this downturn, in order to compete against the ever- multiplying array of competitive video program distributors, and to commit the huge investments needed to make the transition to digital. We therefore urge that the FCC make important changes in its upcoming biennial review. First, the national broadcast television ownership cap must be lifted. Second, one major broadcast network should be permitted to combine with another. And, third, local television and local radio ownership should be based on a percentage of the market, not on the number of stations and arbitrary numbers of ``voices.&#x27;&#x27; We hope that this Committee will support the FCC as it undertakes these significant actions. Eliminating ownership restrictions, which attempt to regulate by a prophylactic method that often ensnares the wrong targets, will not mean the end of any review of mergers, of course. Our nation&#x27;s antitrust laws require intensive review by the Department of Justice or the Federal Trade Commission on a case-by-case basis to determine whether consumers will be harmed by a particular combination. These arms of the government, which have the authority and expertise to assess concentration, should be permitted to do their jobs rather than having arbitrary rules applied that may actually work against consumer&#x27;s best interests. Such tailored assessments of the impact of media transactions promote, rather than stifle, competition. There is only one status quo we should all fight to maintain, and that is the world-class quantity and quality of media choices available to Americans. A healthy broadcast industry that delivers entertainment, sports and news for free to all Americans is a critical element of our society and is only made possible by the incredibly competitive media landscape that is uniquely American. It should not be left to struggle under the weight of rules that favor a select group of broadcasters at the expense of the American viewing public. The broadcast industry is at a critical juncture. This Committee has the opportunity to make an historic contribution by embracing the future and unlocking the shackles that threaten to extinguish broadcasting and its essential role in creating and maintaining an informed and diverse citizenry. We are prepared to take the economic risks to make this new world of choice a continuing reality and to follow your lead into a more competitive future that will result in empowering Americans more than at any time in the history of this great nation. Now is the time to reject interests of the few for the benefit of the many. Thank you. The Chairman. Mr. Frank. STATEMENT OF ALAN FRANK, PRESIDENT, POST-NEWSWEEK STATIONS, INC. Mr. Frank. Good morning, Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee. My name is Alan Frank. I am the President of Post- Newsweek Stations, chair of the Network Affiliated Stations Alliance, representing more than 600 local television stations affiliated with ABC, CBS and NBC. I also serve on the NAB board. Both NAB and NASA strongly believe that the national television ownership cap should not be increased. We appreciate the recent letter from Chairman Hollings, Senator Stevens, and other Members of the Committee emphasizing that the 35 percent ownership cap should be retained. The question facing the Committee as it reviews media concentration is not whether I am a better broadcaster than Mel Karmazin. I run a high-quality television station in Detroit that competes with one of the CBS O&amp;Os, and even though Mel&#x27;s station does no local news, it is a pretty good question. The question instead is sometime will there continue to be a variety of companies, Mel Karmazin&#x27;s, my company, Cosmos, Benedict, Fisher, Hubbard and dozens and dozens of others making critical news and programming decisions in America, or at the next ownership hearing 5 years from now, will Mr. Karmazin be here alone, one person able to testify for the entire broadcast industry because the networks run out of New York and Hollywood will own most of the country. Localism and diversity are at the core of the American broadcast system. Local affiliates are the embodiment of these principles. When NBC told its affiliates last fall to air Game One of the American League Playoffs instead of the first Presidential debate, it was the affiliates that complained and ultimately the network relented and allowed affiliates to preempt the baseball game for the debate. Allowing the networks to own more stations means that next time there will be no local pressure to correct the network&#x27;s bad judgment. Limits on national television ownership sustain our unique form of American broadcasting. Other countries like Japan or Britain or France have no such thing as local news. What happens in Tokyo or London or Paris sets the agenda. There is no community or regional coverage. Increase the ownership cap, and you place in peril our balanced national local system of strong networks and strong local affiliates. Since the ownership cap was increased to 35 percent, the networks have gained substantial power, power that is been used to diminish the role of affiliate stations. We believe the cap should be at 25 percent and the legitimate question for the Committee is why not move the cap back to 25 percent, a number which many of you supported in 1995. Certainly any increase beyond 35 percent would jeopardize localism and diversity. As you review the current state of media ownership, please consider these three points. First, the more stations the networks own, the more they will nationalize and homogenize news and programming. The networks have one goal. To make certain that 100 percent of their programming is carried by affiliate stations. There is tension between the network&#x27;s business model and business objective, which is maximum exposure, and my business and legal objective, which is to meet the needs of the community I serve. My written testimony has several examples of how we preempt network programming to meet community needs. Let me give you one here. At our television stations in Jacksonville, Miami and Orlando, we preempt hours of network programming each year to carry the Children&#x27;s Miracle Network Telethon. This program and others like it reflect local interests, local concerns and local needs. We make these decisions not because we want to harm the network&#x27;s bottom line, but because we seek to meet the special needs of our communities. If the ownership cap is relaxed further, the networks will buy more local stations. How will that change their operations? Think about the general manager of an O&amp;O in South Carolina or Montana, or Oregon, or Mississippi, who has to decide whether to preempt network programming to go carry a local ballgame or candidate debate. Trust me. No GM of an O&amp;O wants to call Mel saying that the station won&#x27;t be showing a network program in order to carry a debate or high school ballgame. Second, I want to dispel the myth propagated by the networks that the future of free over-the-air broadcasting is at stake unless the cap is raised. Quite to the contrary. Localism and diversity are at stake if the cap is raised. In 1996, when the ownership cap was being debated, the networks complained that they were going broke in the network business and needed to own more stations. They were granted their wish, but are now back repeating this plea. This claim suffers from the fallacy of Hollywood accounting. It fails to take into the account the profits network companies earn from program syndication, cable, and their own television stations. The networks are doing just fine, thank you. Wall Street reports show that the four networks collectively in the year 2000 had profits of over $4 billion. Free over-the-air television does not need more network ownership to survive. And finally, the dramatic changes in the broadcast industry since 1996 show that the cap must be retained. Since then, Fox has agreed to buy Chris Kraft; Disney bought ABC Cap Cities; Westinghouse bought CBS; CBS bought Infinity Broadcasting and Viacom bought CBS and this doesn&#x27;t even touch on the networks&#x27; aggressive move into the programming and syndication markets following the repeal of Fin-Syn, where most of the competition has been eliminated. These developments led the FCC to report recently that since 1996 competition in the broadcast industry was reduced rather than increased. In conclusion, while the world of television has changed substantially, the need for safeguards has not. In fact, it has increased. Whether it is local weather or news or candidate forums or sports or charity events, local broadcasters remain a trusted source of information and other important service to their communities. And for those millions of Americans who do not subscribe to pay TV, local broadcasters are their sole source of news and programming. So although it is easy for the networks to say these network rules do not make sense in Internet time, the truth is that values of localism and diversity endure and are as much in need of protection today as they have ever been. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. [The prepared statement of Mr. Frank follows:] Prepared Statement of Alan Frank, President, Post-Newsweek Stations, Inc.
