        "text": "The CW Television Network (The CW) is a television network in the United States launched at the beginning of the 2006–2007 television season. It is a joint venture between CBS Corporation, the former owners of United Paramount Network (UPN), and Time Warner's Warner Bros., former majority owner of The WB Television Network. The \"CW\" name is derived from the first letter of the names of these corporations (CBS and Warner Bros.). The network features a lineup of shows that, according to its former President of Entertainment Dawn Ostroff, \"appeal to people 18 to 34-years-old\".[2] The network currently airs programming six days a week: Monday through Friday afternoons and evenings (in prime time), and Saturday morning children's programming (under their The CW4Kids block).\n\nThe network debuted programming after its two predecessors, UPN and The WB, ceased independent operations on September 15 and September 17, 2006 respectively. The CW's first two nights of programming—Monday and Tuesday, September 18 and September 19, 2006—consisted of reruns and launch-related specials. The CW marked its formal launch date on Wednesday, September 20, 2006, with a two-hour season premiere of America's Next Top Model.\n\nThe CW lineup has featured on a mixture of programming that originated on both UPN and The WB along with its own original programs, mostly targeted towards women and young adults.\n\nContents\n\n1 History\n\n1.1 Origins (1995–2006)\n\n1.2 Beginnings (2006–2011)\n\n1.3 New leadership (2011–present)\n\n2 Affiliates\n\n2.1 Launching repercussions\n\n2.2 Problems with Time Warner Cable\n\n2.3 Pappas Telecasting bankruptcy\n\n2.4 Marianas Media bankruptcy\n\n2.5 Tribune's relations with The CW\n\n2.5.1 De-emphasizing the network's brand\n\n2.5.2 Scheduling shifts\n\n3 Logos and marketing\n\n3.1 \"Free to Be\"\n\n3.2 \"Get into It\"\n\n3.3 \"Good Night\"\n\n3.4 \"TV to Talk About\"\n\n3.5 \"We Own the Night\"\n\n3.6 Imaging and presentation\n\n3.7 Multimedia\n\n4 The CW executive body\n\n5 Programming\n\n5.1 Children's programming\n\n6 The CW HD\n\n7 Footnotes\n\n8 External links\n\nHistory\n\nOrigins (1995–2006)\n\nThe CW is a successor to The WB and UPN, both of which launched in January 1995. However, both networks can be seen as descendants of the Prime Time Entertainment Network (PTEN), a joint venture between Warner Bros. and Chris-Craft Industries, which launched in 1993. The two companies later became partners in The WB and UPN, and PTEN continued as a separate syndication service until folding in 1997. Both UPN and The WB started just as the Fox network had begun to secure a foothold in the American viewing lineup. Both launched to limited fanfare and generally poor results. However, in the subsequent 11½ seasons, both networks were able to air several series that became quite popular.\n\nTowards the end of their opening decade, both television networks were in decline, unable to reach the audience or have the effect that Fox had gained within its first decade, much less that of the Big Three (ABC, CBS, and NBC). In the eleven years UPN and The WB were on the air, the two networks lost a combined $2 billion.[3] Rather than facing questionable futures as separate networks, executives from CBS and Warner announced on January 24, 2006, that they would shut down their respective networks (UPN and WB) and combine resources to form a new broadcast network, to be known as The CW Television Network, that would at the outset feature programming from both networks as well as new content.\n\nCBS chairman Les Moonves explained that the name of the new network was formed from the first letters of CBS and Warner Bros, joking, \"We couldn't call it the WC for obvious reasons.\" Although some executives reportedly disliked the new name, Moonves stated in March[4] that there was \"zero chance\" the name would change, citing research claiming 48% of the target demographic was already aware of the CW name.\n\nBeginnings (2006–2011)\n\nLike both UPN and The WB, The CW targets its programming to younger audiences. CBS and Warner Bros. hoped that combining their networks' schedules and station lineups would strengthen The CW into a fifth \"major\" broadcast network. Unlike the \"Big Four\" broadcast networks, The CW does not offer national news or sports programming to their affiliates; however, some affiliates do broadcast local news and/or sports, and many, mostly CW Plus stations, air the nationally syndicated Orlando-based morning show, The Daily Buzz.\n\nOn September 11, 2006, a new, full version of the network website, www.cwtv.com, was launched. The website now contains links to The CW4Kids and now features more in-depth information of CW shows.\n\nThe CW launched with a premiere special/launch party from CBS-produced Entertainment Tonight at Warner Bros. Studios in Burbank on September 18, 2006, after a repeat of the 7th Heaven 10th-season finale;[5] the same schedule was repeated on September 19, 2006 with Gilmore Girls' 6th-season finale.[6] The network continued to air season finales from the previous season through the rest of the first week, except for America's Next Top Model and SmackDown!, which launched their new seasons on September 20 and September 22 respectively, with full-night premieres. When America's Next Top Model launched on September 20, 2006, The CW scored a 3.4/5 (with hourly ratings of 3.1/5 and 3.6/6; The CW placed 5th overall) in the households. It scored a 2.6 rating in the Adults 18–49, finishing fourth in that demographic and beating Fox's 2.2. The network's second week consisted of all season/series premieres for all other series from September 25 – October 1, with the exception of Veronica Mars, which debuted its third season on October 3.[7]\n\nOn May 9, 2008, The CW announced it would lease its Sunday lineup (5:00–10:00 p.m. ET)[8] to an outside company, Media Rights Capital (MRC). The move allowed The CW to concentrate on its Monday-thru-Friday schedule (Sundays have historically been a low-rated night for the network) while giving MRC the right to develop and schedule programs of its own choosing and reap ad revenue generated by its lineup. The Sunday series that were scheduled—two reality series (4Real and In Harm's Way) and two scripted series (Valentine and Easy Money)—performed poorly in the ratings (averaging only 1.04 million viewers[9]), prompting The CW to scrap its agreement with MRC and program Sunday nights on its own as of November 30, 2008, adding reruns of The Drew Carey Show and Jericho and movies.[10] This time was later given back to local affiliates.\n\nWWE Friday Night SmackDown stopped airing on The CW after the September 26, 2008 episode due to negotiations ending between WWE and The CW Network. The network later confirmed that the CW had chosen not to continue the WWE broadcast because the network had redefined its target audience as exclusively 18- to 34-year-old women[3] Although it continues to air some shows that target male viewers such as Smallville and Supernatural. Thanks to the WWE, MyNetworkTV has beaten The CW in the Friday ratings every week since its debut, though The CW continues to beat MyNetworkTV overall.[11] However, SmackDown left broadcast television altogether in October 2010 when the show moved to cable network Syfy.\n\nThe CW has generally struggled in the Nielsen ratings since its inception, primarily placing fifth in all Nielsen statistics, and in several slots, has even been outrated by the Spanish language Univision. This has led to speculation in the industry (including a May 16, 2008 Wall Street Journal article[12]) that CBS, Warner Brothers, or both companies could abandon the venture if ratings do not improve. However, The CW's fortunes were buoyed in the fall of 2008 and 2009 thanks to increased ratings in its 18–34 female demographic and the buzz that some of its newer series (such as Gossip Girl , 90210 and The Vampire Diaries) have generated. Executives of both companies have emphasized their commitment to the network.[13] Indeed, the CW's 2009–2010 season is a firm go to launch in mid-September 2009,[14] although the network did discuss the idea of an earlier launch for the season—as early as July 2009—in an effort to get ahead of the other networks' fall premieres and to help offset poor performances of summer repeats.[15][16]\n\nOn May 5, 2009, the network announced it was beginning the process of giving the five hours of network time on Sundays back to the CW affiliates as of fall 2009, thus becoming a weeknight-only network in primetime, along with The CW Daytime and The CW4Kids Saturday block.[17][18] Subsequently in mid-May, 65% of the network's affiliates, including those airing the CW Plus schedule, signed agreements to continue to air the replacement MGM movie package on Sunday, which was offered as a traditional movie syndication package meant for the CW's former Sunday primetime slot.[19]\n\nNew leadership (2011–present)\n\nIn 2011, Mark Pedowitz succeeded Dawn Ostroff, but with broader responsibilities in The CW's business operations than she did, as the network's first president.[20] As President of Entertainment, Ostroff oversaw entertainment operations while John Maatta, the network's Chief Operating Officer, handled business affairs, and both reported to a board composed of CBS and Warner Bros. executives. Now Maatta will report to Pedowitz.[20]\n\nPedowitz has revealed that the core target demo of the network will not change, though they will attempt to lure new viewers. He is also looking to bring comedies back to The CW after former president, Dawn Ostroff, publicly declared the difficulty of doing comedies for their target demo. Pedowitz is planning on bringing a new superhero show to the network and more procedural series that repeat better but still have a CW feel to them. He noted that value of having shows that repeat better than their current line-up, which he is hopeful for with Hart of Dixie as it has different medical cases each week.[21] Pedowitz has mentioned his reasoning for bringing back One Tree Hill despite the season eight finale working as a series finale. He said he knew about the strong fanbase before coming to The CW and thought it would be a \"treat\" for viewers to give them one final season.[22]\n\nThe network has ordered more episodes of its original series and plan to run straight though the first week of December, starting September 12th, without repeats.[23]\n\nIn late 2011, the network made digital distribution deals with Netflix and Hulu. The Netflix deal is a four-year deal that will allow its customers to instantly watch more than 700 hours of previous seasons of scripted series that currently air on The CW, while Hulu inked a five-year deal, giving the streaming site access to next-day content from four of the five major networks.[24] [25]\n\nAffiliates\n\nMain article: List of CW affiliates\n\nFollowing the network announcement, The CW immediately announced ten-year affiliation agreements with the Tribune Company and CBS Television Stations Group. Tribune originally committed 16 stations (including its flagship broadcast stations WGN-TV in Chicago, KTLA in Los Angeles and WPIX in New York; another committed station, KSWB/San Diego, joined Fox in August 2008) that were previously affiliated with The WB, while CBS committed 11 of its UPN stations (including WKBD in Detroit, WPSG in Philadelphia, KBHK-TV in San Francisco [now KBCW] and WUPA in Atlanta). These stations combine to reach 48 percent of the United States. Both groups also own several UPN/WB stations that did not join The CW in overlapping markets. As part of its agreement, Tribune agreed to divest its interest in The WB and did not take an ownership interest in The CW.\n\nThe network stated that it would eventually reach 95 percent of the United States. In markets where both UPN and The WB affiliates operate, only one station became a CW affiliate. Executives were on record as preferring the \"strongest\" stations among existing The WB and UPN affiliates. For example, the new network's first affiliate outside the core group of Tribune and CBS-owned stations, WJZY in Charlotte, was tied with Atlanta's WUPA as UPN's fifth-strongest station. In most cases, it was obvious where the new network would affiliate; there were only a few markets (for example, Philadelphia, Miami/Fort Lauderdale, Boston, Charlotte and Atlanta) where the WB and UPN affiliates were both relatively strong. For example, one of the first affiliates to be announced was WKCF in Orlando, Florida. It had not only been the top-rated WB affiliate for virtually all of that network's run, but had also been the fourth-rated station in Central Florida.\n\nNearly all of the CW affiliates were former UPN or WB affiliates. Very few were independents prior to joining the CW. A notable exception was KVCW in Las Vegas, which had been a fairly successful independent before joining The CW.\n\nAlthough it was generally understood that The CW was a merger of UPN and The WB, the new network's creation was not structured as a merger in the legal sense. Rather, it was one new network launching at the same time two others shut down. As such, The CW was not obligated by existing affiliations with The WB and UPN; it had to negotiate from scratch with individual stations.\n\nAs a result, in several markets, the CW affiliate is a different station than either the former The WB and UPN stations. In Helena, Montana, ION affiliate KMTF became a CW station. In Las Vegas, Nevada, independent station KVCW signed for CW affiliation. The network has also affiliated with some digital channels, usually newly-launched subchannels of a local Big Four affiliate, in several other markets.\n\nDue to the availability of \"instant duopoly\" digital subchannels that will likely be easily available on cable and satellite, and the overall lack of a need to settle for a secondary affiliation with shows aired in problematic timeslots, both The CW and MyNetworkTV launched with far greater national coverage than that enjoyed by UPN and The WB when they started in 1995. UPN for several years had gaps in the top 30 markets, and by 2005 managed to cover only 86% of the country. This resulted in secondary affiliations with other networks and the resulting diluted ratings when programs were shown out of their intended timeslots, or the lack of the program airing at all (a problem experienced by many Star Trek fans with Star Trek: Voyager and Star Trek: Enterprise).\n\nLaunching repercussions\n\nThe announcement of The CW caused the largest single shakeup of U.S. broadcast television since the Fox/New World Communications alliance of 1994 and the subsequent launches of UPN and The WB the following year. While The CW debut affected more markets, it was unlikely to cause the same degree of viewer confusion, as no affiliates of the four major networks dropped those affiliations to join The CW. (Some \"big four\" affiliations did change at this time, but for unrelated reasons.)\n\nThe WB and UPN were the first major television networks to close since the collapse of the DuMont Television Network in 1955, although other small broadcast television networks have also ceased operations over the years.\n\nIt became clear that Fox Television Stations, which purchased several UPN affiliates from former UPN co-owner Chris-Craft Industries in 2002, was affected. Its UPN affiliates in five major markets would not be affiliated with The CW, due to the agreement with Tribune, and Fox made it clear it would not even seek the affiliation for its four UPN stations elsewhere. All UPN logos and network references were quickly removed from their stations. Shortly thereafter, Fox announced that it was starting MyNetworkTV, a programming service meant to fill the two nightly prime time hours that opened up on its UPN-affiliated stations after the start of The CW. Fox also offered the service to other stations.[26]\n\nIn those media markets where there were separate The WB and UPN stations, one local station was left out in the merger; most of those stations have signed with MyNetworkTV, while others elected to become independent stations. Some stations (mainly digital subchannels, some WB 100+ cable channels, and struggling low-power stations) which received neither network's affiliation opted instead to sign off permanently and cease to exist.\n\nProblems with Time Warner Cable\n\nSome households around the country were not able to see the new network when it premiered on September 18, due to stations in several markets not being able to strike a deal with Time Warner Cable. In markets like Charleston, South Carolina; El Paso, Texas; Honolulu, Hawaii; Palm Springs, California; Beaumont, Texas; Waco, Texas; and Corpus Christi, Texas, where the CW is broadcast on a digital subchannel of the station's primary affiliate, there have been unsuccessful attempts in getting Time Warner Cable to carry The CW on their basic cable lineups.[27] The CW is 50% owned by Time Warner Cable's former parent company, Time Warner.\n\nSome affiliates have since signed deals with Time Warner Cable, but not all stations have landed within the analog listings. For example, WSTQ-LP in Syracuse, New York can only be viewed on channel 266.(In the Ithaca market only.) [28]\n\nCurrently, the largest market without a known affiliate is the Johnstown / Altoona market, Nielsen's DMA #101. WPCW channel 19, in Pittsburgh, is the closest affiliate and is carried on both Johnstown and Altoona's cable systems; WPCW was originally targeted to serve that area before a switch to a Pittsburgh focus in the late 90's.\n\nOn February 2, 2007 at 4:30 p.m., KFDM-TV made its CW affiliated available to Time Warner Cable in Beaumont, Texas on Channel 10 and also available on Digital 6.2. Although the Southeast Texas CW Logo is on commercials made by KFDM-TV, on the television shows the bug is just \"the CW\".\n\nOn Saturday, April 21, 2007 at 12:01 a.m., KCWQ-LP made its broadcast debut on channel 5 on Time Warner Cable in the Palm Springs area.[29]\n\nOn Friday, April 20, 2007 at 11:00 a.m., KVIA-TV, began broadcasting the CW on Time Warner cable channel 13. The signal is also available on digital television 7.2.[30]\n\nPappas Telecasting bankruptcy\n\nOne of the major affiliate groups of the network, Pappas Telecasting, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy for thirteen of their stations on May 10, 2008. Within the petition, Pappas specifically cited the network's low ratings and performance as one of many complications that had forced it to take the action.[31] Several of the stations have since been sold in either business transactions with Pappas's bankruptcy officials or via station auction processes as Pappas winds down operations.\n\nAlthough the company had originally stated that no stations would be affected at all by the closing, two Pappas stations formerly with CW affiliation have ceased operations. On May 29, 2008, KCWK, a Yakima, Washington-based station serving the south central portion of that state, went off the air and the station's offices were closed, leaving that area without locally-based CW programming and forcing cable and satellite companies to carry KTLA from Los Angeles on their systems to provide the network to their viewers. The situation was resolved when Fisher Communications announced that their CBS affiliates in the area (KIMA-TV/KEPR-TV) would pick up subchannel affiliations at the beginning of April 2009.\n\nSubsequently, WLGA, which served the Columbus, Georgia market lost their CW affiliation in April 2009 to a subchannel of WLTZ due to the network's concerns about Pappas's financial state;[32] unable to compete as an independent station in the market, WLGA ceased operations in June 2010.\n\nMarianas Media bankruptcy\n\nOn April 20, 2009, KTKB-LD in Guam (U.S. Territory) signed on air as a CW affiliate and the island's fifth commercial television outlet. The competition from the other outlets combined with financial problems at Marianas Media, which was running the station under a LMA with KM Communications,[33] forced the station off air March 31, 2011.\n\nTribune's relations with The CW\n\nIt should be noted that while they have solid affiliation deals with The CW, Tribune also has affiliation deals with Fox. But with new management and ownership at Tribune, it was apparent that Tribune would start moving one of its CW-affiliated stations to Fox (at least those in markets without a Fox O&O station or a former O&O now owned by Local TV LLC), adding to more questions surrounding The CW's future. In a seminar by Sam Zell in March 2008, the Tribune Chairman/CEO revealed that their San Diego outlet KSWB-TV would switch affiliations from The CW to Fox in August 2008, with KSWB assuming the Fox affiliation from XETV, a 1986 charter affiliate of Fox. XETV (which is licensed to Tijuana, Baja California, Mexico under the ownership of Televisa but whose US operations are programmed by Bay City TV) was caught off guard and was not informed of Zell's deal until it was made public in the trades.[34] After the news, XETV planned on fighting the affiliation switch in court on the grounds that the switch would violate a contract XETV has with Fox to run until 2010. But on July 2, 2008, XETV announced that they would join The CW on August 1 and rebrand as \"San Diego 6, the new home of The CW\", the same day KSWB became \"Fox 5\".[35]\n\nDe-emphasizing the network's brand\n\nThough the thirteen other Tribune-owned CW affiliates have kept their affiliation, they would begin to de-emphasize the network branding (e.g. \"CW 11\") in favor of one with a stronger local identity. CW-free branding on the stations began in July 2008, either on-air (in the case of KWGN-TV) or through their websites (as part of a redesign for all of the Tribune stations' websites).[36] The following table lists the rebranding of 11 Tribune-owned CW affiliates:\n\nCity Station Former Branding Current Branding Other Notes New York City, New York WPIX CW 11 PIX 11 Upon the re-branding, the station became \"PIX 11\" (pronounced \"picks\"), and utilizes a modernization of WPIX's classic \"circle 11\" logo. Los Angeles, California KTLA KTLA 5, The CW KTLA 5 The new logo features a modernized version of KTLA's former 5 logo which was previously used on the station from 1980 to 1997. Dallas, Texas KDAF The 33 CW 33 Prior to the change, while keeping the CW 33 logo, the station branding was briefly \"KDAF 33\". Washington, DC WDCW The CW Washington DC 50 The station's logo incorporates a silhouette of the Capitol Building dome. Denver, Colorado KWGN-TV CW 2 Colorado's Channel 2 KWGN was the first Tribune CW station to change branding, unveiling a \"2\" identity on July 7, 2008. Between March 2009 and Spring 2010, the station branded as \"The Deuce\" in an attempt to attract a younger audience.[37][38] Miami, Florida WSFL-TV CW South Florida SFL The \"S\" of the \"SFL\" logo is taken from the co-owned South Florida Sun-Sentinel newspaper. The station has had a newscast partnership with the Sun-Sentinel since 2009. St. Louis, Missouri KPLR-TV CW 11 KPLR 11 The new logo features an italicized \"11\" and returns the Gateway Arch motif seen in previous KPLR logos. Portland, Oregon KRCW-TV Portland's CW NW 32 TV Though the station's web address briefly changed to Portlands32.com, it still used the \"Portland's CW\" branding until April 2009. The branding and logo for the station is inspired by Portland's street grid numbering. Indianapolis, Indiana WTTV CW 4 Indiana's 4 The station's red-and-white logo features the stars and torch found on the Flag of Indiana. Hartford, Connecticut WCCT-TV CW 20 The CT The station, as WTXX, used the 'txx' branding from Fall 2008 to March 2010, when they adopted \"The CT\" branding (their call sign changed to WCCT-TV in June 2010). New Orleans, Louisiana WNOL-TV New Orleans' CW 38 NOLA 38 \"NOLA\" is an abbreviated reference to New Orleans, Louisiana. The station's logo incorporates the fleur-de-lis, a common symbol of New Orleans' and Louisiana's French heritage.\n\nSome of these stations (including one that has always used a non-CW branding, Chicago's WGN-TV) still have limited branding references to the CW, either as a minor addition to their logos or as a passing verbal mention in programming promotions (e.g. \"Home of The CW\"). A twelfth Tribune station, KIAH in Houston, also dropped its \"CW 39\" branding in favor of simply \"Channel 39\" in 2008 (the station also changed its call letters from KHCW on July 15, 2008); it would revert to \"CW 39\" on March 28, 2011, though KIAH continues to use the numeric 39 introduced in its rebranding along with the CW logo as opposed to returning to its original \"CW 39\" logo.[39]\n\nScheduling shifts\n\nOn September 8, 2008, with the blessing of the network, Tribune-owned St. Louis affiliate KPLR-TV, shifted their 9PM weeknight newscast to 7PM, moving the CW's prime time schedule to the 8-10PM block (Central Time Zone) instead of the usual 7-9PM berth. The move had 3 intentions: to counterprogram other networks' late-prime time shows with younger-skewing CW programs, to air a newscast at a timeslot (7PM) where no local news has aired in the St. Louis market, and to move their newscast away from the higher-rated 9PM news on Fox affiliate KTVI.[40] The news divisions of KPLR and KTVI would merge one month later as part of a local marketing agreement between Tribune and Local TV LLC, KTVI's owner.[41] Tribune's Denver CW affiliate, KWGN-TV, which is also operated by Local TV (through a LMA with KDVR), would make a similar move in 2009.[42] WNOL-TV in New Orleans became the 3rd Tribune-owned CW affiliate to shift network programming, doing so in June 2010 after canceling their 9PM news (reruns of The Simpsons now fill WNOL's 7-8PM slot).[43]\n\nLogos and marketing\n\nTV network logos\n\nU.S.\n\nNBC • CBS • ABC • FOX • The CW • MyNetworkTV • Ion Television\n\nCanada\n\nCBC • CTV • Global • TVO\n\nAustralia\n\nThe ABC\n\nIreland\n\nRTÉ\n\nAt the network's first upfront presentation on May 18, 2006, the provisional blue-and-white rectangle logo that was used during the network's formation announcement in January was replaced by a green-and-white, curved-letter insignia that drew comparisons to the logo of CNN, another company with Time Warner ownership interest.\n\n\"Free to Be\"\n\nThe network's original full marketing campaign, \"Free to Be\", was created internally and by the Troika Design Group brand agency.[44] The campaign included advertisements in bus stops, on billboards, on the Internet, in magazines, and on television. It contained stars of the CW shows such as Supernatural, Gilmore Girls, Veronica Mars, America's Next Top Model, Smallville and One Tree Hill with the network's signature green background. The \"Free to Be\" was followed by a word unique to the character, show, or scene. Such descriptives included \"witty\" (to describe Gilmore Girls), \"super\" (Smallville), \"scary\" (Supernatural), \"fierce\" (America's Next Top Model), \"cool\" (One Tree Hill), \"funny\" (Everybody Hates Chris), \"fearless\" (Veronica Mars), \"fabulous\" (Girlfriends), \"family\" (7th Heaven), \"best\" (One on One and What I Like About You), and \"tough\" (WWE Friday Night SmackDown). The ads normally ended with one more descriptive, \"together\", used to unify the network and its programming with the viewer. Some additional spots were themed for other purposes without CW stars, for example \"Free to be tricky\" (for Halloween) and \"Free to be famous\" for The CW Daytime. Music used in this promotion was Fergie's \"Here I Come\" with altered lyrics.\n\n\"Get into It\"\n\nOn August 6, 2007, The CW launched their second marketing campaign, \"Get Into It\", performed by the lead singer of Pussycat Dolls, Nicole Scherzinger.[45] The original title for the song is \"Puakenikeni\", which is the third single from Nicole's debut album Her Name Is Nicole. A remix is now used during the commercials.\n\n\"Good Night\"\n\nOn June 2008, The CW launched their Autumn 2008 marketing campaign, \"Everynight will be a good night\". The song in this campaign is \"Goodnight Goodnight\" by Maroon 5.\n\n\"TV to Talk About\"\n\nThe network inaugurated this tagline for the 2009–2010 season, which features the word \"Talk\" switching around various forms of electronic communication such as Twitter messages, blogging and instant messaging before returning to \"Talk\" within promotional ads to encompass the network's heavily online audience. Local stations have adapted this slogan to describe their own syndicated programming and community service efforts. The campaign has continued into the 2010–2011 & 2011-2012 seasons. Additionally some portions of the network's schedule have the modified branding TV to Bing About, as part of a continuing sponsorship deal with Microsoft's search service.\n\nThe song \"TV to Talk About\" was performed by Ke$ha.\n\n\"We Own the Night\"\n\nOn December 13, 2010, The CW launched their new 2011 marketing campaign, \"We Own the Night\" with the tag line—\"This year own the night.\"[46]\n\nThe song \"We Own the Night\" is sung by Jessie and The Toy Boys.\n\nImaging and presentation\n\nThe CW Television Network displays the program credits on the bottom 1/3 of the screen along with The CW Television Network logo and website address. The top 2/3 displays previews of upcoming programming from The CW, local newscasts, or other local programming.\n\nLike CBS, The CW only shows the TV rating icon in its original small size and at the beginning of shows only.\n\nMost affiliates added their city or region to their new bugs. For example: WPSG is \"The CW Philly\", WLVI-TV was \"Boston's CW\" at launch but has since rebranded to \"CW56\" under new ownership, WUPA \"CW Atlanta\" at launch but has since rebranded to \"CW69\", KWTX DT 2 (Waco,TX) is now \"CW Texas\", and KVCW (formerly KFBT) is now \"CW Las Vegas\". However, some stations opted to use their channel number: WNAB in Nashville is \"CW58\" and KSTW in Seattle are now \"CW11\". Some stations will still use the call sign in either the station logo, on-air identification or both. Some examples include WNLO in Buffalo, New York, WWHO in Columbus, Ohio, and WBNX in Cleveland. In Omaha, Nebraska, KXVO uses \"CW15\" and \"Omaha's CW\". In Honolulu, Hawaii, KHON-DT2 is branded as \"Hawaii's CW 93\" (the \"93\" refers to the subchannel's cable channel position). The branding once used by WKRC-DT2 in Cincinnati, Ohio was \"CinCW\", a portmanteau with \"Cincy\", a common nickname for the city. It now brands as \"The CW Cincinnati\".\n\nWith the exceptions of XETV in San Diego, WFNA in Mobile, and WXCW in Fort Meyers, all non-Tribune affiliates brand their stations using a version of the network logo.\n\nMultimedia\n\nFrom time to time, The CW airs short programming breaks called \"Content Wraps\"—a play on the network's name, to advertise one company's product during an entire commercial break.\n\nCW Now was inspired in part by the success of the Content Wraps as it was intended to be a series with product placement.[47] The series was cancelled after 23 episodes.\n\nFor the network's Tuesday schedule for the 2006–07, the network made an agreement with American Eagle Outfitters to have their aerie clothing line tie in with that night's programming as part of the Content Wrap concept, which included subjects in the commercials commenting on plot points in each of the shows.[48] The agreement was cut down to regular advertising in February 2007 after a fan backlash by viewers of both shows and general criticism of the campaign.[49]\n\nOn January 14, 2007, The CW began streaming full-length episodes of several programs on line.\n\nOn December 15, 2006, CBS Corporation revived its record label, CBS Records, whose artists' music will be available to programs on The CW.[50]\n\nThe network has two iTunes App Store applications; the CWTV app is a more traditional television network application featuring the network's programming, which can be streamed over 3G and WiFi networks, while a separate first-person shooter app called Nikita Spy Training Module is used to promote the series of the same name. The network's programming is also available over CBS Interactive's TV.com app, which encompasses all of CBS's various properties. Previously, the network marketed CW City Wize, a Target-sponsored application highlighting businesses and video highlights of the network's Monday and Tuesday night programming in the 2009–10 season; it has since been discontinued.\n\nThe CW executive body\n\nThe executive body consists of:\n\nBarry Meyer—Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Warner Bros. Entertainment\n\nBruce Rosenblum—President of Warner Bros. Television (oversees The CW)\n\nLeslie Moonves—President and Chief Executive Officer of CBS Corporation\n\nNancy Tellem—Senior Adviser, CBS Corporation (oversees The CW)\n\nMark Pedowitz—President of The CW\n\nJohn Matta—Chief Operating Officer of The CW\n\nThom Sherman—Vice President of Development\n\nRick Haskins—Executive Vice President of Marketing\n\nRob Tuck—Executive Vice President for National Ad Sales\n\nProgramming\n\nMain article: List of programs broadcast by The CW Television Network\n\nThe CW Network airs a 10-hour primetime lineup Monday through Friday nights from 8:00–10:00 p.m. ET. Outside of prime time, the network airs a Monday–Friday afternoon block from 3:00–5:00 p.m. ET and a five-hour Saturday morning animation block. Altogether, the network programs 25 hours per week over six days.\n\nFrom April 2009 to March 2011, KTKB-LP in Hagåtña, Guam aired the CW schedule on a Tuesday through Monday pattern because of Guam being a day ahead of the United States mainland.\n\nChildren's programming\n\nMain articles: Kids' WB, The CW4Kids, and Toonzai\n\nOn January 24, 2006, The WB, Kids' WB's original broadcaster, announced they would merge with UPN to form The CW Television Network. The combined network utilized The WB's scheduling practices and brought the Kids' WB block, still run by Warner Bros. Television, and still maintaining its name, to the new lineup.\n\nOn October 2, 2007, the network announced that due to a joint decision between Warner Bros. and CBS (parent companies of The CW), it would suspend the Kids' WB programming block due to the effects of children's advertising limits and cable competition, and sell the programming time to 4Kids Entertainment.[51] Kids' WB ended broadcasting operations on May 17, 2008.\n\n4Kids launched The CW4Kids block in place of the Kids' WB block on May 24, 2008. The lineup for the block consists of 4Kids produced shows such as Chaotic as well as new seasons of Yu-Gi-Oh! and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.[52]\n\nOn April 27, 2010, 4Kids announced it would rename the block as Toonzai in September 2010. 4Kids also indicated that it will retain Yu-Gi-Oh! and Sonic X in its lineup.\n\nThe CW HD\n\nThe CW broadcasts all of their dramas in high definition, while the network's reality series, daytime and children's programming are still in standard definition. The network is available in HD on most of their full-power affiliates, while availability on those affiliates with subchannel or cable-exclusive affiliations varies by market; in some of these cases a standard definition signal is only available terrestrially, while the station offers an exclusive high definition feed to cable and satellite operators."
