It's a world choked with children, but devoid of wisecracks .\n\nThe self-aware sex talk, what little there is, comes from grown-ups. It's a world almost without violence. Even the people who die find a way to keep on living. It's a world where ordinary life as ordinary as it can get in the big, old, gorgeous, clapboard quarters that all the denizens call home is just as important as bagging the perp, resuscitating the patient or uncovering the truth about that pesky alien conspiracy. TV is taking families seriously .\n\nWe look for our reflection concentrated and idealized, of course on television. As baby boomers mature and seek rewards and identity outside the workplace, TV dramas are packed with family life. And the success of so many family shows may signal the beginning of the end of TVs torrid passion for people under 25. \"The Sopranos\" on HBO, awash in blood and profanity but at heart the tale of one \"family\" man's family, was last winter's wildfire sensation. Its moral opposite, sweet \"7th Heaven,\" about a minister, his wife and their brood of seven, outdraws all the teen dreams on the hormone-charged WB network .\n\n\"It's not your family,\" said creator Brenda Hampton. \"It's not my family. But it's a family that people don't mind spending an hour with.\" And a foursome of family freshmen this fall has broken every tenet of programming. TV folks pop the champagne and dish out designer pizza if two new dramas hang on until May, but these four shows have moved into the comfort of the top half of the Nielsen ratings. Last year at this time, the number of new dramas of any kind in that desirable neighborhood was one, \"Martial Law,\" and it barely sneaked in .\n\nUnlike \"7th Heaven\" and \"Sopranos,\" the new shows feature fractured families, a commonplace variety that television virtually has ignored except in comedy for its first 50 years. Three of the four \"Judging Amy\" (ranked 12th in households by Nielsen), \"Family Law\" (18) and \"Now and Again\" (55) represent CBS' entire new dramatic slate. The fourth, \"Once and Again\" (25), is on ABC. \"Providence\" (19th in the Nielsens so far this year) started the family follies in January when, thrown into the NBC dead zone of 8 p.m. Fridays, it became the year's biggest new hit to the surprise of almost everyone .\n\nThe story of a beautiful female doctor who moves back home with her veterinarian father, cute-boy brother, sweet younger sister, who's also an unmarried mother, and her dead mother, who appears to her in dreams every week, twitches the heartstrings with pleasant family tales. All but one of the new shows, the unabashedly relationship-fixated \"Once and Again\" (10 p.m. Tuesdays, ABC), position work- 585006 Candy 576358 (CC) 446014 COURT Crime Stories (R) 8107025 Homicide: Life 6103209 Cops(TV14) Cops(TV14) Cops(TV14) Pros Con Crime Stories (R) 6106396 Homicide: Life 3696743 irikl Discovery \"Wild Asia: On the Inside \"Macy's Parade\" Shark Attack Files II (R) (TVPG) Ultimate Guide \"Crocodiles\" (R) un the inside Tvlacy Parade DISC Ultimate Guide \"Crocodiles\" (R) araiTu mayrv, ini 1 1 vul bisaau 1 1 vn) eraiua tH)t' VP) 412075 Belle Robby' Magical World 1997) Voices Maalca Woi of 8:20 'Horse Sense' (1999, Drama) Joey orro (CC) American Teacher Awards Outstanding teachers from throughout Mickey Mouse 487236 Benson, Paige O'Hara. ice) Lawrence, wnorew Lawrence.

The device provides two entry points for viewers and gives writers the opportunity to maintain interest on at least two fronts every week. In \"Judging Amy\" (10 p.m .\n\nTuesdays, CBS), the mix is 50-50. Our gal, Amy Brenneman, has left a big-time New York law practice and her husband for quiet Hartford, where she plays Solomon as the judge in family court. Executive producer Barbara Hall thinks the time is ripe for the show. \"People were obsessed with their work, and their work was their identity. Now, there's a little more appreciation of other kinds of relationships .\n\n\"If your life is geared toward the perception of success, and you get there and discover that you don't like, or can't actually feel, that success, you have to reexamine and re-evaluate. \"I think the whole Internet and technology thing also plays a part. You can sort of stay at home and be a success now. You don't have to go through the middleman.\" \"Judging Amy,\" along with \"Once and Again,\" offers a strong \"bimodal\" component, meaning it has major characters from two generations and should therefore appeal to two generations in the audience. Amy has to deal with her mother, played by the estimable Tyne Daly .\n\n\"Once and Again\" closely follows the vicissitudes of four children sparkling actors as their newly single parents fall in love again. \"Family Law\" (10 p.m. Mondays, CBS), the least satisfying of the group, is more strongly rooted in one generation and one place: a law office. But Kathleen Quinlan has two youngsters and a nanny at home, and her smarmy male associate shows his sensitive side dealing with a mentally ill brother. \"Now and Again\" (9 p.m .\n\nFridays, CBS), the cleverest and most complex, succeeds despite its implausible premise, as it focuses on the man of the family. From Glenn Gordon Caron (the man responsible for it puts the brain of a dead middle-aged man into the bionic body of a young hottie. He handles the bad guys with ease but falters when dealing with his widow and daughter, who can never know his more-than-6-million-dollar secret. Such successes may reflect that television has been wrong in ignoring the over-40 baby boomers, who still fit nicely into the 18-to-49-year-old demographic that advertisers seek. \"For several seasons,\" said CBS President Leslie Moonves, \"there's been a glut of teenage angst-driven shows, all targeting the same audience, when in fact the real audience is the baby boomers.\" ESPNew I Sportscenter 617507 136193 Southern California .\n\nFrom Maui, Hawaii.
