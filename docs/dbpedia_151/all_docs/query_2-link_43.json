It originated as a weekly block on Saturday mornings on the Fox Broadcasting Company, which was created out of a four-year agreement reached on January 22, 2002, between 4Kids Entertainment and Fox to lease the five-hour Saturday morning time slot occupied by the network's existing children's program block, Fox Kids. It targeted at children aged 7–11. The 4Kids TV block was part of the Fox network schedule, although it was syndicated to other broadcast television stations in certain markets where a Fox affiliate declined to air it.\n\nProgramming\n\nFormer programming\n\nOriginal programming\n\nTitle Premiere date End date Source(s) Rights now owned by Ultraman Tiga September 14, 2002 March 1, 2003 Kirby: Right Back at Ya!

However, it was revamped on September 25, 2008, in beta testing. Promotions stated that 4Kids TV would be \"moving online\" starting in January 2009, implying that the video player would be fully operational at that time; however it remained in beta testing by that month. However, 4Kids seemed to increase the number of shows that were added to the player at that point. The site fully launched on September 9, 2009, with the player receiving a revamp once again. The online network was shut down on November 2, 2012.\n\nRelationship with Fox and broadcast ambiguities\n\nThe block had a somewhat unusual relationship to the Fox network. The programming was produced for Fox and offered to the network's owned-and-operated stations and affiliates first, so the Fox station in any given area had the right of first refusal. In the event that a Fox affiliate or in some cases, an O&O of the network—opted not to carry 4Kids TV, the block then became available for the local broadcast rights to be acquired by another television station. In fact, it was due in part to these carriage ambiguities that 4Kids dissolved the block in 2008, as they had been promised clearance on at least 90% of Fox's stations.\n\nMost of Fox's owned-and-operated stations opted to carry 4Kids TV, these were mainly stations that had been owned by the network since Fox launched in October 1986 or were Fox charter affiliates that Fox Television Stations had acquired since that point. However dating back to the existence of the Fox Kids block, the twelve stations that Fox acquired from New World Communications in 1996 (and had earlier affiliated with the network through a 1994 multi-station affiliation deal—which prior to then, had been affiliated with ABC, NBC, or CBS) generally did not air 4Kids TV. In some of the New World markets, 4Kids was not carried on any station. In a majority of these markets, an independent station carried the block; in others, it was carried by either a UPN, or later, a CW or MyNetworkTV affiliate. The lone exception was in St. Louis, Missouri, where Fox O&O (now affiliate) KTVI carried the block (although it aired 4Kids TV two hours earlier that the network's recommended scheduling for the block, beginning at 5:00 a.m., due to the station's Saturday morning newscast).\n\nSome of 4Kids TV's programming (such as Winx Club, The Adrenaline Project, Magical DoReMi, Stargate Infinity, reruns of Back to the Future: the Animated Series, and Cubix) met the criteria to be considered educational and informational under the requirements defined by the Children's Television Act, and counted toward the three-hour-per-week mandatory educational children's programming quotas outlined by the Federal Communications Commission. Outside of Fox, 4Kids TV's programming aired reruns on The WB every Sunday morning after a new episode aired on Saturday on Fox, and new episodes on The WB's children block Kids' WB.\n\nMarkets where 4Kids TV did not run at all\n\nCity of license/market Fox station Notes Birmingham, Alabama WBRC WBRC (channel 6) dropped 4Kids TV predecessor Fox Kids upon becoming a Fox owned-and-operated station in September 1995, when it reached an agreement to allow outgoing Fox affiliate WTTO (channel 21) to continue carrying the block, WTTO dropped Fox Kids in 2000, resulting in 4Kids TV not being available in the Birmingham/Tuscaloosa/Anniston market as it was not picked up by WBRC or any other television station in the market. Greensboro/Winston-Salem/\n\nHigh Point, North Carolina WGHP WGHP (channel 8) dropped 4Kids TV predecessor Fox Kids in March 1996, when it reached an agreement for WB affiliate WTWB-TV (channel 20, now CW affiliate WCWG) to carry the block, WTWB-TV dropped Fox Kids in 2001, resulting in 4Kids TV not being available in the Greensboro/Winston-Salem/High Point market as the block was not picked up by WGHP or any other stations in the market. Greenwood, Mississippi WABG-DT2 When ABC affiliate WABG-TV (channel 6) launched a Fox-affiliated digital subchannel in September 2006, the subchannel initially did not start broadcasting on Saturdays until 4:00 p.m. (or earlier if there were sports events scheduled to air), resulting in 4Kids TV not being available in the market during the last two years of its run.\n\nMarkets where 4Kids TV ran on a MyNetworkTV affiliate\n\nCity of license/market Fox station MyNetworkTV\n\nstation\n\ncarrying block Notes Chicago, Illinois WFLD WPWR-TV Duopoly owned by Fox Television Stations, WPWR (channel 50) was a UPN affiliate at the time it began carrying 4KidsTV.
