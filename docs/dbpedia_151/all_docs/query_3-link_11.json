        "text": "I started a thread over on the Coast to Coast board about radio call letters that reflect defunct formats and brandings. So I figured that here on the National TV board, I would start a similar thread about call letters that reflect past network affiliations. This can apply to any network the station was affiliated with, whether the network is still around under its original name, has changed names, or has completely ceased to exist.\n\nLos Angeles\n\nKPXN* (physical 38, virtual 30)--Ion Television: Left over from when this network was owned by Paxson and known as Pax TV. This is the only one I could find for the L.A. market.\n\n*Just about any channel with \"PX\" somewhere in its call letters most likely is (or was) an affiliate of what is now known as Ion Television.\n\nSan Diego/Tijuana\n\nKSWB (physical 19, virtual 69, cable 5)--Fox: Left over from when this channel was an affiliate of the long-defunct Warner Brothers television network (better known as The WB). This is the only one I could find for the San Diego/Tijuana market.\n\nWhat such call letters can you think of for your local and/or neighboring markets?\n\nWhat is now WSFL-TV 39 (RF ch 19) in Miami began as WDZL in 1982, and during their WB affiliation it was WBZL; I am sure it was not by coincidence.\n\nI believe somebody told me that KCWX 2 (RF 5) in the San Antonio market is no longer CW, but still has kept the calls. (See three posts above mine.)\n\ncd\n\nDToTheJ said:\n\nIn San Antonio, \"CW 35\" still bears the calls KMYS. In fact, they market themselves as \"KMYS CW 35.\"\n\ncd637299 said:\n\nI believe somebody told me that KCWX 2 (RF 5) in the San Antonio market is no longer CW, but still has kept the calls.\n\nIt's true. KCWX is now a MyNetworkTV affiliate.\n\nanotherguy said:\n\nAlthough it's cable only, WBJK in Jackson, TN was on the WB 100+ network but is now with the CW 100+ network.\n\nIt's just CW Plus (no 100+).\n\nHow much trouble is it to change call letters? Does it cost a lot of money?\n\nChanging calls is about as simple as anything gets with the FCC. There is a web form and a filing fee of a couple hundred dollars. $350 sounds right to me, but that could be the filing fee for another sort of license alteration. Also, the FCC weighs some fees by market size -- I am unsure if this is one of them.\n\nWEYI/25 in Saginaw, Michigan was a CBS affiliate prior to 1995 (now NBC), hence the \"EYI\".\n\nThis is probably one of the few instances referring to a big-three affiliation.\n\nErie's WICU/12 did have CBS as a secondary affiliation when it signed on in 1949, so it's possible the \"ICU\" (I see you) was related to CBS, but it's hard to say if that was in fact the case."
