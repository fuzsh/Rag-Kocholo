They could move all of that stuff to the FSS sats and free up the DBS slots for consumer programming. Or they could move the PI channels to the FSS slots.\n\nI agree that E* could move the private business channels to 121 and 105, however the FCC will not allow the PI channels to be moved over to the FSS slots, the PI channels are a DBS requirement and moving them to the SuperDish slot would defeat the purpose of the requirement if few of the E* subs had dish's to receive those channels. I also suspect that the any Internationals on the wings not already duplicated on 121 will be relocated to 121 and or 105 to make room for more HD locals on the wings. This is how I see the future;\n\n105 Business channels and possibly Internationals.\n\n110 SD Nationals and locals, HD National's and possibly some locals.\n\n119 SD Nationals and locals.\n\n121 Business channels and Internationals.\n\n129 HD Nationals and locals.\n\n148 HD locals.\n\npsnarula\n\n· Godfather\n\nJoined Aug 13, 2005\n\n·\n\n430 Posts\n\nDiscussion starter · #24 · Feb 10, 2006\n\nderwin0 said:\n\nNone of Atlanta's stations are on a spotbeam.

WATL carries most of the games but not all. Grrrrrr. There is a similar situation (two JP Sports affiliates) in Greensboro. But dish carries them both so I'm really happy with the way things work right now.\n\nI guess I'll be forced to do something else at some point in the future as dish phases out the superdish in favor of more spotbeams. But nothing is changing right away so for now I'll just sit back and wait for things to develop. It was interesting to read the earlier post that compared spotbeams for Directv and Dish Network. One thing I do not understand is why dish network wants to phase out superdishes in favor of spotbeams. I refuse to believe that it's to keep people from getting out of market locals by \"moving\" -- if they cared about that they would have cracked down years ago. So what's the motivation for echostar? Is it cheaper to do spotbeams? Why not just have all locals be CONUS?\n\nI also notice from http://ekb.dbstalk.com/19 that Atlanta says:\n\nBig 4 Networks available nation wide to qualifying subscribers in \"Dish Nets\" package\n\nWhat is a Dish Nets package? The same webpage says that NY, LA, and Chicago also have CONUS locals. Seems like people who want NY and LA locals for HD possibilities would have an easier time just doing a \"move\" to one of these locations rather than deal with all the waivers.\n\nJames Long\n\n· Super Moderator\n\nJoined Apr 17, 2003\n\n·\n\n55,357 Posts\n\nalebowgm said:\n\nThen again, E10 is adding so many more beams, that it will probably only he a handful of locals on the FSS side...\n\nLook ma, NO hands?\n\nlarrystotler said:\n\nOr they could move the PI channels to the FSS slots.\n\nNope. The PI channels must be on the main satellites. E* tried the 'let's put the PI channels on the wings' trick and got slapped down. The rule is a certain percentage of each slot.\n\npsnarula\n\n· Godfather\n\nJoined Aug 13, 2005\n\n·\n\n430 Posts\n\nDiscussion starter · #26 · Feb 10, 2006\n\nwhat does FSS stand for?\n\nJames Long\n\n· Super Moderator\n\nJoined Apr 17, 2003\n\n·\n\n55,357 Posts\n\nFixed Satellite Service - It is the Ku band that is used with 105 and 121 as opposed to the slightly higher Ku frequencies used on the DBS satellites at 61.5/101/110/110/119/148 and foreign locations.\n\nderwin0\n\n· Icon\n\nJoined Jan 31, 2005\n\n·\n\n538 Posts\n\npsnarula said:\n\nI went to theacc.com and found this page that lists JP Sports affiliates for acc games separated by state:\n\nIt shows that there are actually two JP Sports affiliates in Atlanta -- WATL (which is CONUS on 110) and WPXA (which dish network does not carry).

CSN consistenly shows Ravens Postgame Live on sunday nights instead picking up Fox Sports Net's Acc Sunday Night Hoops feed. They make up for it by replaying the games on tape delay at 1:30 in the morning. The Baltimore JP Sports affiliate isn't so bad except when there is a split signal game -- i'm pretty much guaranted to not get the game involving a team from north carolina (unless one of them is playing maryland).\n\nA2736\n\n· Cool Member\n\nJoined Feb 11, 2006\n\n·\n\n24 Posts\n\nMy locals currently are on 105 (superdish required).

You'll need a wing dish pointed at 61.5° (or 148° if you could see it) or a SuperDish pointed at 121°. If you can get just the LNBs for a 121° superdish you could convert your 105° superdish once the local channels move.\n\nA2736\n\n· Cool Member\n\nJoined Feb 11, 2006\n\n·\n\n24 Posts\n\nThank you James great help .\n\nFifty Caliber\n\n· Banned\n\nJoined Jan 4, 2006\n\n·\n\n979 Posts\n\nI don't see 121 being phased out due to all the international content there. I would like to see 105 go away, because if your locals are on 105, it makes getting 121 rather difficult. (How many people would like TWO SuperDishes?)\n\nJacob S\n\n· Hall Of Fame\n\nJoined Apr 14, 2002\n\n·\n\n7,657 Posts\n\nI read in another thread that Dish Network has 105 leased for 10 years. Surely they will have some sort of use for 105. Maybe the rest of the local markets will get the SuperDishes since there will not be nearly as many people in the smaller markets to install an expensive SuperDish for. Does 105 have enough space to launch the SD locals in the rest of the local markets? Maybe they will put up a second dish (61.5 or 148) for the rest of the local markets. I think a second dish is a lot easier to install than a SuperDish in many cases.\n\nJames Long\n\n· Super Moderator\n\nJoined Apr 17, 2003\n\n·\n\n55,357 Posts\n\nI don't see E* flipping SuperDishes out of one market and into another. If they do continue to use 105 to directly reach customers it will probably be with HD locals or some other service. Most likely they will just use it for 'backhaul' feeds and business uses.\n\nalebowgm\n\n· Hall Of Fame\n\nJoined Jun 12, 2004\n\n·\n\n1,057 Posts\n\nderwin0 said:\n\nNone of Atlanta's stations are on a spotbeam.

Omaha is on 110, so my Dish 500 covers it.\n\nNot only that, Omaha's channels are better. That said, what's the deal -- how come Lincoln does not receive the Omaha channels in it's package, anyway? All the Omaha channels serve Lincoln as part of their broadcast area, yet Dish does not include them in their Lincoln locals package.\n\nJames Long\n\n· Super Moderator\n\nJoined Apr 17, 2003\n\n·\n\n55,357 Posts\n\nThe nation is divided up into 210 markets. Lincoln and Omaha are in different markets. Perhaps some day down the road this will get fixed (especially if the Omaha channels are significantly viewed in Lincoln).\n\nPresence\n\n· Godfather\n\nJoined Mar 14, 2004\n\n·\n\n361 Posts\n\nEach and every Omaha channel always says \"Omaha, Lincoln, Council Bluffs\" during its station identification. Pity the FCC (their fault, right?) didn't see it that way.\n\nRight now I'm trying to figure out how to get Dish to upgrade me to a Dish 1000 (along with a 622) here in Lincoln even though my service is in Omaha."
