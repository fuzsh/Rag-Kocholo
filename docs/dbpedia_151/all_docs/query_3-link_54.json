They are the only CW affiliates available in many areas. Unlike the CBS, ABC, NBC and FOX, the CW network is not recognized as eligible for national carriage. FOX once had the same unrecognized status and it took years to get it approved. If the currently available CW stations lose their affiliation, it could take years to get the CW back.\n\nPrevueForum\n\n· Registered\n\nJoined Aug 13, 2021\n\n·\n\n414 Posts\n\nMaybe it should move to the 8 Ion Stations on the .2 so they can move their subchannels up by 1\n\nDr.Dave\n\n· Super Moderator\n\nJoined Aug 8, 2005\n\n·\n\n23,878 Posts\n\nI'm wondering what will happen to the CW affiliates known as \"US Superstations\" on TV services.\n\nKTLA is owned by Nexstar and WPIX is operated by Nexstar, so their status as CW affiliates is safe since they are the LA and New York flagship stations. They are 2 of only 6 remaining superstations that the FCC allows to transmit nationally in the U.S.\n\nbigoranget\n\n· Registered\n\nJoined Aug 7, 2003\n\n·\n\n5,092 Posts\n\nI would wager a guess that WGN will probably once again become a CW affiliate once the affiliation agreement with Weigel's WCIU expires. WGN ended their CW affiliation when it was owned by Tribune but since WGN is a Nexstar channel, I am pretty confident they will bring CW programming back to WGN. WMYD in Detroit would seem like the likely new home of CW for Detroit although WADL isn't out of the question either. I'm not sure about Seattle. KONG has long been an independent station and I doubt FOX will have any interest in putting CW programming on KZJO.\n\nDr.Dave\n\n· Super Moderator\n\nJoined Aug 8, 2005\n\n·\n\n23,878 Posts\n\nDeadline reported a few days ago that Nexstar plans to acquire independent station KUSI-TV in San Diego, so they must have been below the 39% limit. Nexstar said the deal is \"expected to be accretive to Nexstar’s operating results when The CW Network affiliation becomes available in the market.\" Tegna-owned station KFMB currently has an affiliate agreement for The CW Network.\n\nI agree with bigoranget that WGN will probably take over the CW affiliation once it becomes available.\n\nTV64Niagara\n\n· Registered\n\nJoined Nov 8, 2017\n\n·\n\n88 Posts\n\nNexstar will acquire KSTW in Seattle - Tacoma, Washington and WUPA - TV Atlanta, Georgia from CBS News and Stations Inc.

Your post makes absolutely no sense as well. Your top paragraph says $35 million and then a $675 million figure which also would never make sense because any purchase deals from different station groups would be separate.\n\nTV64Niagara\n\n· Registered\n\nJoined Nov 8, 2017\n\n·\n\n88 Posts\n\nIt looks like Mission Broadcasting and Nexstar Media Group Incorporated just acquired WADL - TV Detroit (Mount Clemens), Michigan from Detroit, Michigan based broadcaster Kevin Adell owner of Adell Broadcasting Corporation On May 17, 2023 for $75 million. WADL - TV will be the new CW affiliate starting September 1, 2023 replacing the soon to be former CW station WKBD - TV which will be a independent television station on September 1, 2023\n\nPrevueForum\n\n· Registered\n\nJoined Aug 13, 2021\n\n·\n\n414 Posts\n\nPHL17, KRON and GreatTV38 will become CW on 9/1/23 but what stations will atl, sacremento, seattle, pittsburgh get for the cw?\n\nDr.Dave\n\n· Super Moderator\n\nJoined Aug 8, 2005\n\n·\n\n23,878 Posts\n\nHere's the official press release:\n\nNexstar Television Stations in Philadelphia, San Francisco, and Tampa to Become Affiliated with the CW Network on September 1 | Nexstar Media Group, Inc.\n\nWPHL-TV, KRON-TV, and WTTA-TV Will Carry CW’s Primetime Entertainment, Live Sports, and Special Event Programming in Three of the Nation’s Top-15 Markets\n\nPrevueForum\n\n· Registered\n\nJoined Aug 13, 2021\n\n·\n\n414 Posts\n\nAtlanta, Sacramento, Seattle and Pittsburgh's new stations for the CW are Unknown and Detroit (WADL) is still being acquired by Mission Broadcasting, therefore either WMYD or WADL might get the CW\n\nbigoranget\n\n· Registered\n\nJoined Aug 7, 2003\n\n·\n\n5,092 Posts\n\nMY guess is because Nexstar will be running WADL on behalf of Mission Broadcasting, it will be WADL that becomes the CW.\n\nPrevueForum\n\n· Registered\n\nJoined Aug 13, 2021\n\n·\n\n414 Posts\n\nwhat about atlanta, sacramento, pittsburgh and seattle? any Guesses?\n\nFeel Free to leave them here after this comment\n\nbigoranget\n\n· Registered\n\nJoined Aug 7, 2003\n\n·\n\n5,092 Posts\n\nSeattle is the only other market that will effect Canada unless somehow WPCH in Atlanta some how got the CW affiliation for Atlanta market. For Seattle the two main independent channels are Ch.16 KONG Ch.22 KZJO. I have doubts that either KONG or KZJO are likely candidates to take on CW as KONG has been independent since it started and I highly doubt FOX is interested in converting KZJO to CW either. It's very likely CW might get relegated to a sub channel in this market.\n\nTV64Niagara\n\n· Registered\n\nJoined Nov 8, 2017\n\n·\n\n88 Posts\n\nUnless Nexstar plans to make a deal with CBS NEWS and Stations about selling KSTW Seattle - Tacoma, Washington to Nexstar Media Group for 75 million dollars and to keep KSTW as the local CW owned & operated television station under Nexstar Media and Mission Broadcasting Corporation KSTW would be branded as Seattle - Tacoma’s Very Own and the Circle 11 logo for station indefication at the top and bottom of the hour\n\nbigoranget\n\n· Registered\n\nJoined Aug 7, 2003\n\n·\n\n5,092 Posts\n\nThat's not going to happen. CBS has been pretty clear on their plans for the 8 CW stations that are going independent. The CW is either going to go on KONG or KZJO or one of the other stations will likely pick it up as a sub-channel. My guess is sub-channel as I doubt KONG and KZJO are interested in CW programming on their stations. My thoughts are if an root station was interested, we'd already have an announcement by now. That's why I think it will probably end up on a sub-channel.\n\nHugh Janus\n\n· Registered\n\nJoined Apr 28, 2023\n\n·\n\n101 Posts\n\nFor the Seattle market, CW is now a sub-channel to KOMO, sharing space with Comet.\n\nbigoranget\n\n· Registered\n\nJoined Aug 7, 2003\n\n·\n\n5,092 Posts\n\nI figured a sub-channel was the likely destination for CW programming for the Seattle market and KOMO makes sense because I believe it's a Sinclair station and they already have many of their stations affiliated with CW."
