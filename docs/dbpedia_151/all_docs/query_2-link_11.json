        "text": "KSTW (under its original KTNT call letters) was actually a CBS affiliate in the fifties and early sixties. As you note, it was a CBS affiliate again for two years in the nineties as a result of a joint deal (CBS wanted to affiliate with KTVT in Dallas/Fort Worth and had to agree to also take on KSTW in order to get the deal from the then-owner of both stations, Gaylord). The likelihood that it will become a CBS station for a third time is probably pretty low since history says that hasn't worked out well for CBS in the past. Notably, if the ratings hadn't been horrible in the nineties, I'm thinking that CBS wouldn't have been as quick to jump back to KIRO as they were.\n\nWhether CBS would be willing to sell KSTW to someone who might want to make it into a CW affiliate is another matter, since I'm not sure how valuable a stand-alone independent station really is to them. While KSTW was once one of the most successful independent stations in the country and was even a regional superstation (\"We're entertaining the whole northwest\", \"KSTWashington\"), those days are long gone. Now it's just another \"has been\" station with a minimal news presence and very little image outside of being a generic CW affiliate -- whatever value there might have been in the station's heritage got blown away during those two years as a CBS affiliate from 1995 to 1997, and nothing that has happened since to recreate that heritage.\n\nI grew up watching that station, but it's pretty clearly that what is left is an empty husk that probably is only worth whatever the stick value is to get into the Seattle/Tacoma market.\n\nKSTW was the place to be for a while- I moved out to Seattle in 1988, applied everywhere but got a job at KCPQ. Worked there for a long time but felt it was time to leave last year. I applied for an engineering position at KSTW but the perfunctory Zoom interview told me everything I needed to know about that station. What's left of it just seems like an unpleasant, unhappy place to work at. Super glad I didn't get that job. As much of a joke as the CW is, I'm sure it will get worse at KSTW without any sort of affiliation.\n\nKSTW was the place to be for a while- I moved out to Seattle in 1988, applied everywhere but got a job at KCPQ.

What's left of it just seems like an unpleasant, unhappy place to work at. Super glad I didn't get that job. As much of a joke as the CW is, I'm sure it will get worse at KSTW without any sort of affiliation.\n\nMost of the staff and management for KSTW are located in San Francisco where KPIX and the soon to be KPYX are located. I understand how KSTW is unpleasant from your angle\n\nLongtime Seattle station KSTW's reorganization means layoffs\n\nMore than half a century and several affiliation switches later, the storied Puget Sound...\n\nIt's been true since 2006.\n\nMore than half a century and several affiliation switches later, the storied Puget Sound station will have a portion of its operations assumed by CBS Corp.'s duopoly in San Francisco, pink-slipping an unknown portion of KSTW's staff.\n\n\"All we're simply doing is reorganizing the station to help give it a better chance down the road,\" KSTW Vice President and General Manager Trey Fabacher said this week. \"This is something a lot of stations have done around the country. It's nothing new in our industry right now.\"\n\nFabacher confirmed there would be layoffs but declined specifics, saying the station doesn't discuss personnel issues.\n\nIn KSTW's reorganization, some on-air operations will be assumed by staff at San Francisco CW affiliate KBCW-TV and CBS affiliate KPIX-TV by the end of the year. Fabacher stressed the lineup around KSTW's prime-time programming will remain the same.\n\n\"There will be no difference at all in the on-air product at our station. That's one of the things through this whole production that we made sure of,\" he said\n\nMy guesses...\n\nPhilly: WPHL 17 (your right. If so, MNT is gone in Philly.)\n\nAtlanta: WANF 46 (Gray probably wants to give CBS up. They've hinted at dropping CBS since they've been giving it up on brandings and promotions, except for network ones. If so, WUPA becomes CBS. WATL will still be the home of MNT.)\n\nSan Francisco: KRON 4 (I'll give you that one as well. MNT goes away completely in the market.)\n\nSeattle: KIRO 7 (Ironically enough, I say KIRO because they've done a news-intensive schedule before as a UPN affiliate. They can do the same as a CW affiliate with KSTW getting back CBS. MNT stays on KZJO.)\n\nTampa Bay: WTTA 38 (you're right about that too! If so, MNT goes away completely.)\n\nDetroit: WMYD 20 or WADL 38 (It depends here. If WMYD gets it, WADL stays MNT. If WADL gets it, WMYD stays Indie, and MNT is gone completely.)\n\nSacramento: KTXL 40.2 (The Nexstar-owned factor matters here. MNT stays on KQCA.)\n\nPittsburgh: WPNT 22 (I believe you're right about this one too. I don't see WPGH giving up FOX. MNT is gone from Pittsburgh completely.)\n\nKRON definitely gets the CW. MNTV will go to FOX owned KICU TV. Keep an eye Nexstar. They may try and buy KSTW from CBS. And heres where I am thinking and wondering if KBCW reverts back to its old days as call letters KBHK TV...\n\nKBCW has already filed to become KPYX.\n\nAnd Nexstar can't buy KSTW because it would put it over the national market cap.\n\nDoes this mean that Mission Broadcasting has to agree to get the broadcasting license of KSTW and WUPA. I understand that Mission Broadcasting have a pending deal to get WADL Detroit but has to wait for Approval and once that's done they sign affiliation deals and News content contracts with Nexstar.\n\nLongtime Metro Detroit station WADL-TV purchased by Texas-based broadcaster for $75 million\n\nWADL-TV, a MyNetworkTV affiliated station in Clinton Township, was launched in May 1989 and reaches nearly two million households.\n\nAlso San Diego recently Nexstar have a pending deal with KUSI-TV so far these two stations are waiting for approval and are proposed to join with their sister stations KRON, WPHL as New CW affiliates in September 2023.\n\nNexstar Acquires KUSI-TV in San Diego for $35M\n\nThe independent station is expected to become a CW affiliate\n\nAbout KUCO |\n\nKUCO is dedicated to our mission to be Oklahoma’s Voice for Performing Arts and ensuring great musical works are present within our communities. Learn more about KUCO.\n\nHere is another reason why Paramount is changing the KBCW call letters to KPYX San Francisco. It's not just to comply with the agreement that KRON San Francisco is going to be the next CW affiliate in the area.\n\nThis one is also because KBCW calls belong to the University of Central Oklahoma for a Classical Music station in the state.\n\nI think you have a misunderstanding here. Situations like KBCW-FM and KBCW-TV are perfectly legal and have been for decades now.\n\nThe only requirement is that whoever has had the base callsign the longest (the FM in Oklahoma in this case) has to grant permission for the other station to use it on a different band. Which they did, or else it would never have become KBCW-TV in the first place. Certainly not a reason to need to change it now, all these years later. That's purely a result of the affiliation change.\n\nI think you have a misunderstanding here.
