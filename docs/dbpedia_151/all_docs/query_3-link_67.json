Financial details were not disclosed.\n\nFOX Sports' new agreement with MLB gives the network the rights to:\n\nâ€¢ Up to 26 FOX Saturday Baseball Game of the Week regionalized single-header broadcasts, an increase from 18 previously;\n\nâ€¢ Exclusive coverage of the American League Championship Series in 2007, 2009, 2011 and 2013;\n\nâ€¢ Exclusive coverage of the National League Championship Series in 2008, 2010 and 2012;\n\nâ€¢ Exclusive prime-time coverage of the World Series from 2007 through 2013 with Game 1 scheduled for the first Tuesday after completion of the LCS;\n\nâ€¢ Exclusive prime-time coverage of the All-Star Game from 2007 through 2013;\n\nâ€¢ This Week in Baseball, MLB's award-winning, youth-oriented magazine show which precedes the FOX Saturday Baseball Game of the Week.\n\n\"FOX has enjoyed 11 terrific years as the broadcast home of Major League Baseball, having covered some of the game's most memorable moments,\" said Fox Networks Group President/CEO Tony Vinciquerra. \"Major League Baseball is as popular today as ever ... with new young stars and veteran players performing before hundreds of millions of fans in-person and on TV each year. The schedule this agreement provides enables FOX to combine the most-watched games of the year with the No. 1 prime-time lineup in America.\"\n\n\"For some time now, Major League Baseball has been a key component of FOX's programming strategy,\" said Peter Liguori, the President, Entertainment for the network. \"The games are an invaluable promotional platform - for both our new series and returning hits such as HOUSE, 24, PRISON BREAK, BONES, THE SIMPSONS, and FAMILY GUY. We look forward to many more successful years with Major League Baseball, and are eager to see who will be on top come October.\"\n\nThe expanded FOX Saturday Baseball schedule gives baseball an over-the-air, April-through-September, \"Game of the Week\" for the first time since 1989, and FOX also retains exclusive rights to the MLB All-Star Game, annually the highest-rated All-Star event in sports. In 2005, the MLB All-Star Game out-rated the NBA All-Star Game in households by +65% (8.1 vs. 4.9), and the NFL Pro Bowl by +98% (vs. 4.1). In its history, the MLB All-Star Game has never been beaten by any other All-Star event on a same-year basis.\n\nhttp://msn.foxsports.com/mlb/story/5776108?print=true\n\nStill more details:\n\nSports On TV\n\nExtra innings for Fox, MLB\n\nNet retains postseason; Turner trades Braves\n\nBy Paul J. Gough The Hollywood Reporter July 12, 2006\n\nNEW YORK -- With one fell swoop Tuesday, Fox Broadcasting managed to alleviate some of the scheduling pressure surrounding the postseason baseball that washes over its slate in October.\n\nFox and Turner Broadcasting emerged the victors for much of the postseason baseball package, which was announced Tuesday at PNC Park in Pittsburgh, the site of Tuesday's All-Star Game.\n\nFox has retained the rights to the World Series and one League Championship Series for seven more years. It also upped its commitment to regular-season baseball with 26 weeks of Saturday afternoons compared with the current 18 weeks that start in May. Turner will trade the Atlanta Braves telecasts it has had on TBS for decades for a national package that next year will make it the exclusive home of both Divisional Series plus, in 2008, carve out a regular-season Sunday afternoon game every week of the season.\n\nFinancial terms were not disclosed, but sources said Fox will pay an average of $250 million a year for the seven-year deal, down from the $417 million a year it has been paying. Turner will pay $120 million a year, sources said.\n\nFox has had a sometimes rocky road with baseball, which can drive a stake through its regular TV season when it takes up much of October. The network has in the past had some difficulty launching its new season, though its strategy of starting some shows in August paid off last year with \"Prison Break\" as well as the scheduling of \"American Idol\" in January.\n\nIts ratings can go through the roof, like what happened in 2003 with the nail-biting seven-game ALCS between the New York Yankees and the Boston Red Sox as well as the 2004 rematch in which the Red Sox came from behind and won its first World Series in 86 years. But ratings also can go the other way, like last year when the Chicago White Sox beat the Houston Astros in what became the lowest-rated World Series in history.\n\n\"We're not the same company that we were 10 years ago,\" Fox Sports president Ed Goren said. \"Fox has won the adults 18-49 race two years running. Peter Liguori and his team has to figure out how to make the most out of postseason baseball. It makes sense to pre-empt fewer nights and create more windows for his schedule while retaining the promotional power of postseason baseball.\"\n\nThere are only two series per year in October, down from as many as seven Divisional Series games, two League Championship Series and the World Series.\n\n\"They have fewer variables. They won't have as many nights where they don't know whether there will be a Game 6 or will we have to program,\" Goren said. Liguori returned from vacation late Tuesday and wasn't available for comment.\n\nGoren said Tuesday from Pittsburgh that it didn't start that way in the 13 months Fox and MLB were negotiating, including the time when Fox let its exclusive negotiating window pass.\n\n\"Three or four weeks ago, we weren't convinced we were doing any baseball,\" Goren said.\n\nTurner's new deal begins at season's end, when it has the rights to any special tie-breaking games a la the one-game playoff between the Red Sox and Yankees on Oct. 2, 1978.\n\n\"We wanted to get involved with baseball as soon as possible,\" Turner Sports president David Levy said. \"We asked what we could we get today. This was not tied to any other network. Wouldn't it be great if the Yankees and Red Sox came down to a one-game playoff?\"\n\nTurner will give up the 70 Braves games it airs on TBS after 2007, though the local WTBS in Atlanta still will carry 45 Braves games a year. Although Turner had reached a deal last year to extend the contract another seven years, this new national package required a choice.\n\n\"We couldn't have it all. We had to give to get,\" Levy said. \"We just financially couldn't afford (having both packages).\"\n\nESPN remains in contention for the second LCS rights as well as other networks. But ESPN took a pass on the Divisional Series, which it has televised since they started in 1995. Yet word from Bristol, Conn., was that it wasn't a big news flash because the ratings for the Divisional Series -- where many of the games happen in the low-rated daytime -- didn't match what it would cost for ESPN.\n\nIn a news conference Tuesday in Pittsburgh, MLB commissioner Bud Selig said that the LCS deal would be the last piece of the rights puzzle to emerge.\n\n\"There is an enormous amount of interest. I think sooner than later we can announce that,\" Selig said.\n\nESPN is by no means out of the baseball game. In September, ESPN and MLB announced a $2.4 billion deal through 2013 that included a continuation of the exclusive \"Sunday Night Baseball\" as well as nonexclusive nights of baseball during the regular season for a total of about 80 a year. ESPN also has extensive new-media rights.\n\nBut ESPN, at least for now, will be out of postseason baseball after this season.\n\nhttp://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr..._id=1002802978\n\nAccording to this the games will be on TBS:\n\nMLB to Announce TBS Deal\n\nBy Mike Reynolds 7/11/2006 7:27:00 PM\n\nTurner Sports will enter Major League Baseballâ€™s postseason following the leagueâ€™s 2007 campaign.\n\nAs part of deals that are expected to be announced in Pittsburgh before Tuesday nightâ€™s All-Star Game at PNC Park, MLB will announce that it has struck multiyear regular-season and postseason deals, terms of which were not disclosed, with Turner and Fox.\n\nFrom 2007-13, TBS would become the home to all four Divisional Series. Those contests -- which would be presented to a large degree in the form of doubleheaders and even tripleheaders -- have been airing on Fox and ESPN. This marks the first time the Divisional Series will air entirely on cable. The following year, TBS would take its first swing at a 26-week Sunday-afternoon package, according to sources familiar with the deal, who indicated that those contests would not be exclusive.\n\nFor its part, Fox, from 2007-13, would retain the World Series and one of the League Championship Series. Fox would also continue to present the All-Star Game, and it would have the right to expand its exclusive Saturday-afternoon game coverage to 26 weeks from its current 18-week schedule.\n\nThe next owner of the other LCS package -- which Fox has held the rights to under the $2.5 billion, six-year contract that expires after this season -- remained unclear at press time.\n\nFox and Turner officials declined to comment. MLB officials could not be immediately reached for comment.\n\nTBSâ€™ major step up to the plate will result in a further scaling back of its coverage of the Atlanta Braves.\n\nUnder a seven-year pact signed with MLB last season, TBS is airing 70 Braves games this season and next, and it was scheduled to present 45 in the last five years of the pact. However, the new pact dissolves that commitment, as the 45 Braves games will be aired locally on WTBS in Atlanta and/or within the clubâ€™s six-state home territory.\n\nThe new game-of-the-week deal allows TBS to air up to 13 games of any team, including the Braves, nationally per season. In its heyday, TBS carried up to 125 Braves games nationally.\n\nFor Fox -- which has taken a write-down on the value of its current deal -- the new contract will reduce its commitment to MLB during October.\n\nMomentum for the networkâ€™s primetime schedule -- just weeks after what has traditionally been the start of the new TV season -- has often been disrupted by the large commitment to baseball during that month. Fox has responded by going to a more year-round scheduling approach and by delaying the start of such hits as serialized thriller 24 and American Idol until January.\n\nhttp://multichannel.com/article/CA63...=Breaking+News\n\nThe MLB TV deal from the TBS perspective:\n\nSports On TV\n\nTBS to air non-Braves games in '08\n\nBy TIM TUCKER The Atlanta Journal-Constitution July 12, 2006\n\nSince Ted Turner had the seemingly zany idea in the 1970s of beaming his baseball team's games off the satellite and across the country, the Braves have been national television fare, even earning the moniker \"America's Team\" for a while.\n\nBut the team's status as a national television property â€” sharply reduced in recent years â€” will essentially disappear under a new broadcast deal between TBS and Major League Baseball.\n\nThe deal, announced Tuesday, gives TBS the television rights to games not involving the Braves for the first time. The seven-year deal includes all of the division series playoff games starting in 2007 and 26 regular-season Sunday afternoon games per year starting in 2008.\n\nTBS will continue with its original commitment to show 70 regular-season Braves games nationally next year. But starting in 2008, the network's deal to televise Braves games nationally is dissolved, and the Braves become just another team in the new national package on TBS.\n\nUnder the deal, TBS can show a maximum of 13 games per season of any single team â€” the Braves or any other â€” on its Sunday afternoon national schedule starting in 2008.\n\nViewers in Atlanta, though, still will be able to watch the Braves on television. TBS, officially known as WTBS locally, will show 45 Braves games per season in the metro Atlanta market from 2008 through 2013, but no more than 13 of those â€” and potentially fewer â€” will be carried nationally. Between now and 2008, Turner Sports president David Levy said, TBS will work on how to show its non-national Braves telecasts in other Southeastern markets.\n\nAlso, by 2008, about 105 Braves games per season will be shown in Atlanta and across the Southeast on regional cable channels FSN South and Turner South, with a dozen or so others likely to be shown by ESPN or Fox.\n\nThe new deal will make TBS the exclusive carrier of division series games starting next season. In the event of overlapping division series games, Levy said, some could be shifted to TNT, which like TBS is part of Atlanta-based Turner Broadcasting. The deal also puts the MLB All-Star selection show on TBS starting next year and any tiebreaker games for division titles or wild-card berths on TBS starting this season.\n\n\"This is very exciting,\" Levy said. \"This is the first time in our history we've carried postseason baseball, and that, coupled with our long-term relationship with NASCAR and our continuing relationship with the NBA, puts Turner Sports in a very prime position.\"\n\nThe tradeoff, though, is the end of a three-decades-old tradition of the Braves as national programming.\n\n\"Unfortunately, you can't have it all,\" Levy said. \"You have to give up something to get something sometimes.\n\n\"The playoffs and how the models work for us, the displacement costs of other programming, what else is on TBS and audience flow â€” a lot of factors went into it. We kept as much as we possibly could as far as financially and consumer viewing habits.\"\n\nThe deal continues a trend of TBS downsizing its Braves coverage from a peak of 150 national telecasts to 70 this season, and three years ago it temporarily benched long-time Braves announcers Skip Caray and Pete Van Wieren to try to create more neutral telecasts.\n\nLevy said it is \"way too early\" to consider who will announce the new package of games.\n\nAlso Tuesday, Major League Baseball announced a seven-year extension of its national broadcast deal with Fox.\n\nhttp://www.ajc.com/braves/content/sp...s/0711tbs.html"
