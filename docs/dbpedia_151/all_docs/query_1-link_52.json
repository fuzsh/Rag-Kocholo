        "text": "Banner image photograph by Hans Braxmeier at Pixabay\n\nAbout FreeAtlTV.com\n\nFreeAtlTV is your Free Over-the-Air (OTA) TV information source for Atlanta, Georgia. We hope to be the best place on the web for information about free over-the-air TV in Atlanta. We post, on our home page, a weekend list of movies and shows that we think you might enjoy. We also post information about newly added channels and shows, or anything else we feel may be of interest. This website can be considered dull and out of style, but we are here to inform you without eating up bandwidth with graphics. Visit us every week so you don't miss out on any of the great TV shows and movies available for free. The \"About\" page will be updated as needed in order to clarify, update, or add new information. Scroll down in case there have been changes since your last visit. We are not responsible for any ill effects from watching too much TV...\n\nFor more information on ways to enjoy Movies, TV Shows, etc. without paying for an expensive cable service visit Cord Cutters News. They also have a YouTube Channel for a quick update on the latest in cord cutting news.\n\nIf you want to learn more about a Movie, TV Show, Director, Actor or Actress, etc., one of the best places to go is the Internet Movie Database, also known as the IMDB.\n\nAntennas - Coverage\n\nFinding the best antenna for where you live can be a challenge. Channel reception is affected by your distance from the broadcasting tower and your antenna range, location, and size. Rain and strong wind, trees, airplanes, etc., can affect reception. Some may be able to get all channels with an indoor antenna, while others may need an outdoor antenna. Search the web and read to find out what is best for you. The following site is a good place to start learning...TV Antenna. Visit AntennaWeb to find out where broadcast towers are located in relation to your home and what type of antenna is needed. RabbitEars provides a Signal Search Map tool for a more accurate and detailed report for your specific location. Click \"Get Location\" > \"Allow\" > \"Go\" to get a report. Antenna Man has a video with tips to Improve TV Reception and a video on Combining two antennas. If you use an attic or outdoor antenna, make sure you have a quality cable (RG-6 compared to inferior RG-59), to avoid reception issues caused by signal loss. Scripps (Owner of several TV Networks and Stations) has recently launched a website (TheFreeTVProject.org) as part of a campaign to promote OTA TV. The \"AVS Forum\" has a section dedicated to over-the-air TV viewers in Atlanta. You can post messages, if you become a member... AVS Forum - Atlanta OTA\n\nIf you are using an indoor antenna with both UHF (Digital/RF Channel 14 thru 36) and Rabbit Ear VHF (Digital/RF Channel 2 thru 13), extending the rabbit ears (VHF) on the antenna may help with receiving some Virtual Channels (8, 9, 11, 12). Having either the left or right rabbit ear dipole shorter than the other may help to reduce constant fluctuations in signal strength, which some may experience with channel 9 and 12. You will have to experiment to find what is best for your location. Stations with a power of 7kW and less may be too weak, if you live too far outside of the perimeter. Visit RabbitEars and check out the Coverage Maps to get more information on signal strengths in your area. Set Longley-Rice to \"Show\" and click Apply to see detailed information. The color Yellow indicates that it is difficult for an indoor antenna to receive the selected channel. Links to Coverage Maps for Atlanta Channels are included in the table below... Example Coverage Map\n\nReception - ATSC 3.0/NextGenTV\n\nReception issues with ATSC 1.0, the current system, will hopefully be reduced with the introduction of ATSC 3.0/NextGenTV. Stations that switch to ATSC 3.0 must also broadcast in ATSC 1.0 until July 17, 2027 , as required by the FCC. Some predict that ATSC 1.0 will be available many years beyond that date (Antenna Man). There is a TV Station in Eugene, Oregon (K03IM-D) which is able to broadcast a 4K (2160P) signal in ATSC 1.0, by using newer video codecs. Here is an Antenna Man video interview with the station owner. Several TV Stations in the United States are already beginning to switch to the newer MPEG-4/H.264 video codec while broadcasting in ATSC 1.0 (Antenna Man). WUVG-DT is doing this on Channel 34.5 and 34.6 in Atlanta. If you own a TV or Set-Top Box (STB) built prior to 2015 you may receive audio without video on those stations. The Zenith DTT901 STB will display the words \"AUDIO ONLY\" on those stations. STB's/External Tuners are also available for receiving ATSC 3.0 on TV's without a built-in ATSC 3.0 tuner. External ATSC 3.0 tuners available at this time are expensive ($90.00 and more). We may have to wait a while to see better prices. More information about ATSC 3.0 is available at TV Tech and Digital Trends. The official NextGenTV website lists cities that already have ATSC 3.0 and the stations that are available in those cities. ATSC 3.0 has been available in Atlanta since August 19, 2021. RabbitEars has a List of Stations that have filed with the FCC as ATSC 3.0 stations and their current status. Here are a couple of informative videos about ATSC 3.0 presented by Antenna Man... ATSC 3.0 Part1 ATSC 3.0 Part2.\n\nIf a Network is having technical difficulties, the local station is typically the one who needs to fix the problem. Contacting the Network (Charge!, etc.) will only help if that Network is willing to contact your local station. AntennaTV will contact local stations/affiliates after posts to their Facebook page. Some Networks have contact information on their website. Be sure to include the station name (WUEO-LD or other) when reporting a problem. WPCH-TV is aware of the pixelation on Channel 17.4 and is seeking a solution to the problem. Make sure your problem is not caused by an issue with your antenna before contacting a Network or local station. If your picture is breaking up, it could be that your antenna is not adequate for your location or weather conditions are affecting the signal. Sometimes you will need to re-scan to get a channel back, if it has disappeared. A full scan is the most reliable method for restoring channels and finding new channels. If your TV is equipped with an \"EZ Add\" or similarly named feature, use that feature with the knowledge that it is not completely reliable. However, on rare occasions the \"EZ Add\" feature will work when a full scan is not working to restore a channel.\n\nProgramming Info - Networks\n\nFor daily programming information, covering all available over-the-air channels (Broadcast Stations) in the Atlanta area, we recommend TitanTV.com. To \"Create a New Channel Lineup\", click the + next to the red toolbox > choose \"Broadcast\" > enter Zip Code > select a Provider > Save. To Delete a \"Channel Lineup\", click the red toolbox > click the red X in the Lineup you want to delete. You can search for shows by entering the name of a show in \"Search for Programming\" > Click on the show name in the search results > \"View Additional Airings\" to see all the show times for that show. Actual channel numbers do not always match with the channel numbers listed on TitanTV.com. Atlanta programming can sometimes vary from what is listed on TVGuide.com and TitanTV.com. You can also check the scrolling program guide on Channel 9.1 for a current listing of shows, but not all channels are listed and actual programming can vary.\n\nThe FCC requires a minimum of three hours of children's programing each week. This programing is listed as E/I and is typically broadcast Saturday and Sunday mornings. This accounts for some of the differences in what is listed and what is broadcast. Local stations/affiliates can show different programming for other reasons as well.\n\nSome of the best programming is shown by networks owned by companies you may have never heard of. The list of companies includes Weigel Broadcasting (\"MeTV\" (Available in Metro Atlanta thanks to Marquee Broadcasting), \"MeTV Toons\", \"Catchy Comedy\", \"Heroes & Icons\", \"StartTV\", \"Dabl\", \"Story\". Weigel Broadcasting is also part owner of \"Movies!\", a joint venture with FOX.), Get After It Media (\"RetroTV\", \"The Family Channel\", \"Rev'n\", \"The Action Channel\", \"Heartland\".), Scripps (\"Bounce\", \"Court TV\", \"Grit\", \"ION\", \"ION Plus\", \"ION Mystery\", \"Laff\", \"Scripps News\".), Sinclair Broadcast Group (\"Comet\", \"Charge!\", \"TBD.\" (To Be Discovered), \"The Nest\".), Allen Media Group (\"TheGrio\".), Nexstar Media Group (\"Antenna TV\", \"The CW\", \"Rewind TV\".), TEGNA (\"Quest\", \"True Crime\"), and Free TV Networks (\"THE365\", \"OUTLAW\", \"Defy\").\n\nStreaming - Chromecast\n\nAlthough this website is dedicated to Over-the-Air TV, we want to mention websites that offer Free TV Shows and Movies via streaming, also known as Over-the-Top (OTT). Be aware of your internet data allowance to avoid added charges from your internet service provider. PlutoTV offers various channels in a wide range of interests including News, TV Shows, Movies, and more. Stirr also offers various channels to choose from. If you want to watch live channels as well as specific movies or TV shows you may prefer Xumo, Local Now, or Tubi. You can search for movies and TV shows on Tubi by entering the name of a show or movie at the top of the website. Crackle is another free site with TV Shows and Movies. Shout! Factory TV has a large selection of TV Shows and Movies available. Cineverse, the newest OTT option, was launched in September of 2022. Some Networks (ABC, CBS, TheCW) provide free streaming of TV Shows. History, which is on cable, has some shows available for free. You do not have to register to watch content on the websites we have listed. These free streaming services are often referred to as FAST (Free Ad-supported Streaming Television).\n\nStreaming on your Smart TV instead of watching on your smaller computer screen can be done by \"Mirroring\" from a Miracast compatible device (Computer, Smart Phone, etc.). Computers with at least Windows 8.1 (2013 and newer) may support Miracast if your Video Card and Driver as well as your WiFi Adapter and Driver support it. If you have Windows 7 and use Chrome as your web browser, you still may be able to use the \"Cast\" command in Chrome for streaming YouTube videos to your Smart TV. You may also be able to stream videos to your Smart TV by using Windows Media Player. If you do not have a Smart TV, a Streaming Blu-ray player connected to an older TV, with a HDMI connection, can be used for streaming. However, the Blu-ray player may limit what you are able to stream. Even if you own a Smart TV you may not have access to all the Streaming services you want. In order to fully enjoy streaming, you can connect a Chromecast device (dongle) to your TV. The Appliances Reviews website provides a good overview of AnyCast/Miracast and Chromecast. You can search the web for other devices similar to Chromecast.\n\nChromecast with Google TV (HD) currently (July-2023) sells for about $30.00 at Best Buy. Your TV must be equipped with a HDMI connection. Your internet speed needs to be a minimum of 5 Mbps (20 Mbps for the more expensive Chromecast with Google TV (4K)). You will need a Wi-Fi Network and a Gmail account (Free) in order to set up Chromecast. You do not have to use a mobile device (Android Phone, iPhone, etc.) to set up Chromecast. Simply choose the \"Set up on TV instead\" option. After Chromecast is set up, you can stream to your TV directly from your Computer using the \"Cast\" command in Chrome. You can also use a Smart Phone or any other Wi-Fi device in order to stream to your TV. You do not have to use the remote control that comes with Chromecast. However, the remote control does give you access to much more content and the convenience of voice control. Walmart has recently (July 2023) started selling the Onn Google TV 4K Streaming Box (dongle) for about $20.00. The Streaming websites (PlutoTV, Tubi, etc.) available for streaming on the dongle you purchase depends on which apps are available and installed on that device. Reviews.org provides a list of 10 free streaming apps available on Chromecast with Google TV. Not mentioned in the list is the Freevee app, which is owned by Amazon. They offer a large selection of Movies and TV Shows. There are rumors at this time (Feb 2024) that Amazon plans to shut down the free streaming service. Many of the videos you may watch on Chromecast are available through YouTube. Highlight a video and hold the Select button on the Chromecast Voice Remote to save (\"Watch later\") a video for future viewing. Launch the YouTube App and navigate to the on-screen menu on the left side of your screen. Choose \"Library\" in order to access your \"Watch later\" list and also access \"History\" for a listing of previously watched videos. Streaming does not provide the same high quality video as OTA TV but it does give you access to more free content to watch. We recently (17-Nov-2023) had an issue with our Chromecast. It was not responding to the remote control. Checking on our computer to see if it was listed in the Cast Tab of Google Chrome showed it was missing. We unplugged the power cord of the Chromecast dongle and after a few minutes plugged it back in. This fixed the problem. We are still very happy with Chromecast in spite of this one problem.\n\nYou can enjoy streaming Nature Videos , Music, and Stunning Drone Videos from around the world using Chromecast. You can also \"Cast\" computer games from your PC to your TV. The game must support running in Window Mode. Start by launching Google Chrome web browser. Choose \"Cast\" and change \"Sources\" to \"Cast Screen\". Then choose your TV listed in the Cast Tab. Launch your game and it should be seen on your TV. If your computer is displayed as a box instead of filling your entire TV screen you may want to change the Display settings on your computer. Changing Display settings will cause your desktop icons to be rearranged ( Extend Desktop Chromecast as Second Monitor ). You may need to use the \"Duplicate these displays\" option instead of \"Extend these displays\" when you get to the step of choosing the \"Multiple displays\" setting. We have tested casting the games \"MotoGP 08\" and \"Need for Speed: Shift\". We used the free program X360CE (Xbox 360 Controller Emulator 3.x) in order to perform the tests using an old Microsoft SideWinder Joystick. The website for the X360CE program contains instructions as well as a newer version of the software. More detailed instructions on using the program are available here. Before running the program, verify that you have Modify/Write access to the folder that contains the .EXE file for your game. We noticed some lag when casting the games we tested. It seems to be related to the low level of remaining CPU resources on our computer. Would a more powerful computer not see the same lag when playing games which require higher levels of CPU processing power? We leave the answer to that question to those with more advanced computer knowledge...\n\nAtlanta Television Stations - Channels"
