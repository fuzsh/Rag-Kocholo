I think they've cancelled most of their original scripted shows (EDIT: I guess they haven't actually axed many, but some are in their announced final season and there seems to be only one definitive renewal at this point, for All American).\n\nI'm not sure why CBS-owned stations wouldn't be CBS affiliates? Are there already other CBS affiliated stations in those markets?\n\nHarry-N\n\nJoined\n\nAug 9, 2003\n\nMessages\n\n3,973\n\nLocation\n\nSunny Central Florida\n\nReal Name\n\nHarry N.\n\nAren't they mostly all former UPN stations that migrated to CW?\n\nScott Merryfield\n\nJoined\n\nDec 16, 1998\n\nMessages\n\n18,974\n\nLocation\n\nMich. & S.

The CW station (WKBD channel 50) was a long time independent station here until UPN came along.\n\nGarysb\n\nJoined\n\nJul 31, 2003\n\nMessages\n\n6,089\n\nI'm not sure why CBS-owned stations wouldn't be CBS affiliates?

CBS owns WCBS Ch 2 and WLNY-TV Ch 10/55, an independent station. I imagine it is the same in the markets losing their The CW affiliate. If Nexstar can not find a local station to become their new affiliate it is possible they can make an arrangement to be carried by a local cable company. They do this in some small markets where they don't have a local affiliate.\n\nLast edited: May 7, 2023\n\nNICKP91\n\nGrip\n\nJoined\n\nFeb 25, 2020\n\nMessages\n\n20\n\nReal Name\n\nnick p\n\nI can't see any way KTXL drops FOX despite Nexstar Media owning the station\n\nChip_HT\n\nScreenwriter\n\nJoined\n\nJun 28, 2004\n\nMessages\n\n1,124\n\nReal Name\n\nChip\n\nThis could be interesting with a lot of the RSNs going through financial issues.

When WKBD here was an independent, they carried Detroit Pistons games. Another independent, channel 20, carried Red Wings games.\n\nNICKP91\n\nGrip\n\nJoined\n\nFeb 25, 2020\n\nMessages\n\n20\n\nReal Name\n\nnick p\n\nIt will be interesting to see if CBS will drop WANF affiliation when their contract ends\n\nAdam Lenhardt\n\nJoined\n\nFeb 16, 2001\n\nMessages\n\n27,283\n\nLocation\n\nAlbany, NY\n\nThis makes it less likely that the remaining CBS-produced shows on The CW will get picked up for another season. Most of these markets are large enough that there is another station without Big Four affiliation that would be interested in picking them up if their programming lineup represents an improvement over what they've programmed themselves.\n\nLord Dalek\n\nJoined\n\nApr 4, 2005\n\nMessages\n\n7,139\n\nReal Name\n\nJoel Henderson\n\nI'm not sure why CBS-owned stations wouldn't be CBS affiliates?

It was a bit different with Fox making a deal with a station owner to switch his stations to Fox from their previous affiliates rather then Fox buying the stations and then switching the affiliates.\n\nLast edited: May 10, 2023\n\nGarysb\n\nJoined\n\nJul 31, 2003\n\nMessages\n\n6,089\n\nWhile I am not sure many watch the CW these days, they are apparently reducing their losses with the programming they now have. I will watch Superman and Lois's last 10 episodes when the show resumes in October. Other than that I am unaware of anything they broadcast that I am interested in.\n\nBroadcast Giant Nexstar Misses Q2 Estimates, Says It Is “Executing” CW Plan As Network Losses Shrink\n\nBroadcast TV giant Nexstar Media Group undershot Wall Street analysts' estimates for the second quarter, but reported narrower losses at The CW."
