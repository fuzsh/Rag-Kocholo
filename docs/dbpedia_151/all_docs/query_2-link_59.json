        "text": "CBS Entertainment Group, a division of Paramount Global (formerly ViacomCBS), operates the CBS Television Network, CBS News, CBS Sports and the CBS local television stations in the United States. It was part of an independent business called CBS Corporation until December 4, 2019, when CBS Corporation and Viacom Inc. merged to form ViacomCBS.\n\nThe two companies have a long history of splitting up and reuniting. Members of the Redstone family are majority owners of ViacomCBS.\n\nCBS owns a group of 27 broadcast television stations reaching 15 of the top 20 markets in the United States, including 16 CBS Television Network affiliates.\n\nMany of the other CBS-owned stations are affiliated with The CW Television Network, which CBS jointly owns with Warner Bros., a division of Warner Media, LLC. The CW Network was formed in September 2006, taking the place of the UPN Television Network and The WB Television Network.\n\nCBS Radio, which operated over 110 radio stations and was created from the 1997 acquisition of Infinity Broadcasting, was sold to Entercom Communications Corporation (now Audacy, Inc.) on November 17, 2017. The deal did not include the CBS News Radio and CBS Sports Radio networks, although Audacy now operates CBS Sports Radio under a licensing agreement with CBS.\n\nCBS Corporation was formed at the end of 2005, when the old Viacom corporation split into two independent companies: New Viacom and CBS Corporation.\n\nNational Amusements, a movie theater company, owned a controlling interest in CBS Corporation stock. National Amusements was founded by Michael Redstone, the father of Sumner Redstone who inherited the business and built it into a media powerhouse. Sumner Redstone died on August 11, 2020 at age 97. His daughter Shari Redstone is now the chairwoman of ViacomCBS."
