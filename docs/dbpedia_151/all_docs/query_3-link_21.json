Either that, keeps things as they are news wise, and relegate CW programming to Midnight-2am (very unlikely). In regards to Tampa, does WFLA move their prime news hour on WTTA to the more traditional 10pm, perhaps bumping up the Spanish language news hour to 7pm? One last bit of Speculation: Look for CBS (Your Market Here) + debuting on Sept. 1 in their O&O markets.\n\nThat's certainly a possibility.

One last bit of Speculation: Look for CBS (Your Market Here) + debuting on Sept. 1 in their O&O markets.\n\nWFLA can't do Spanish 7pm news on WTTA because they already air their own 7pm news on WFLA so that's virtually impossible.\n\n2023-06-14Sub ChannelsUpdateWFLA-TVNetwork [CW]2023-06-14Sub ChannelsUpdateWTOGNetwork [Independent]2023-06-14Sub ChannelsUpdateWPSGNetwork [Independent] Coming Soon [Y]2023-06-14Sub ChannelsUpdateWPHL-TVNetwork [CW]2023-06-14Sub ChannelsUpdateKBCWNetwork [Independent]2023-06-14Sub ChannelsUpdateKTVUNetwork [CW]\n\nNexstar Stations In Philadelphia, San Francisco, Tampa To Become CW Affils On Sept. 1 - TV News Check\n\nThe company’s WPHL, KRON and WTTA drop their MyNetworkTV lineups to carry Nexstar’s CW’s primetime entertainment, live sports and special event programming.\n\nI'm not sure if I understand this. Its WTTA getting it, not WFLA. Also, KRON is getting it, not KTVU.\n\n2023-06-14Sub ChannelsUpdateWFLA-TVNetwork [CW]2023-06-14Sub ChannelsUpdateWTOGNetwork [Independent]2023-06-14Sub ChannelsUpdateWPSGNetwork [Independent] Coming Soon [Y]2023-06-14Sub ChannelsUpdateWPHL-TVNetwork [CW]2023-06-14Sub ChannelsUpdateKBCWNetwork [Independent]2023-06-14Sub ChannelsUpdateKTVUNetwork [CW]\n\nNexstar Stations In Philadelphia, San Francisco, Tampa To Become CW Affils On Sept. 1 - TV News Check\n\nThe company’s WPHL, KRON and WTTA drop their MyNetworkTV lineups to carry Nexstar’s CW’s primetime entertainment, live sports and special event programming.\n\nKTVU is a Fox O&O it cannot be in the CW Deal.\n\nKRON is part of this deal to get the CW because of Nexstar.\n\nAlso we need to see where CW is going in Sacramento given that KMAX is losing the CW affiliation because of Paramount decision not to renew that affiliation.\n\nWe have a new logo for KMAX TV Sacramento. Yes KMAX will follow the setup of KPIX and KCAL-TV's logo. It's basically that KMAX will be an extension of KOVR CBS Sacramento.\n\nFox might buy KSWB or the even WPSG, WUPA and WTOG at some point with WPSG, WUPA and WTOG would join MNTV. Gray or Scripps might buy the dispaced KSTW or KMAX.\n\nMuch more likely Paramount would put the CBS affiliation on KSTW, WUPA and WTOG.\n\nWTOG could be used to cover the state of Florida, along with WFOR in Miami. If they could somehow swing a station in Orlando then they would basically blanket that state when accounting for population.\n\nKICU might join MNTV\n\nThis article indicates KRON and the other new CW stations will keep MNTV but boot it to a secondary subchannel:\n\nThe CW’s new affiliates are WPHL Philadelphia; KRON San Francisco; and WTTA Tampa. All of those stations are currently affiliates of Fox’s MyNetworkTV and will continue to carry MyNetwork on digital broadcast channels.\n\nThis article indicates KRON and the other new CW stations will keep MNTV but boot it to a secondary subchannel:\n\nI don't believe that for a second.\n\nThis article indicates KRON and the other new CW stations will keep MNTV but boot it to a secondary subchannel:\n\nWhy? There’s nothing unique that MyTV offers and you can’t use it as a startup for a new station or subchannel.\n\nJust let the program service die off like it should have back in 2009.\n\nIt obviously served a purpose or it would have been gone back when. Not to many people’s tastes; great. Never going to be a major player; ok, but sometimes those kinds of business units can serve a purpose in the larger picture. If you’re making a contribution to the bottom line, good for you.\n\nIf they’re dumping it now in favor of what they own, well, of course. And so the economics change again. Maybe that tilts it to be not worth the minimal investment. Cool, whichever way it goes."
