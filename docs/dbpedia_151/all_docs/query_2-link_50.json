In\n\n1999, the Company announced that it intended to split-off Blockbuster by\n\noffering to exchange all of its shares of Blockbuster common stock for shares\n\nof the Company's common stock. The split-off was subject to approval by the\n\nCompany's Board of Directors and an assessment of market conditions. The\n\nCompany no longer has any plans for the split-off of Blockbuster.\n\nDuring 2000 and in the first quarter of 2001, the Company took several\n\nimportant steps to secure its position as a leading global media and\n\nentertainment company. Significant transactions included the following:\n\n. On May 4, 2000, CBS Corporation (\"CBS\") merged with and into the\n\nCompany. At the time of the merger, the Company issued 1.085 shares of\n\nits Class B Common Stock for each share of CBS common stock and 1.085\n\nshares of its Series C Preferred Stock for each share of CBS Series B\n\npreferred stock. The total purchase price of approximately $39.8 billion\n\nrepresents the issuance of 825.5 million shares\n\nI-1\n\nof Viacom Class B Common Stock, 11,004 shares of Viacom Series C\n\nconvertible preferred stock (which were subsequently converted into 11.0\n\nmillion shares of Viacom Class B Common Stock), the estimated fair value\n\nof CBS stock options which were assumed by issuing Viacom options, and\n\nestimated transaction costs. In addition, Viacom assumed approximately\n\n$3.7 billion of CBS debt.\n\n.

On February 21, 2001 Infinity Broadcasting merged with\n\nand into a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. In connection with\n\nthe merger, the Company issued 0.592 of a share of Viacom Class B Common\n\nStock for each issued and outstanding share of Infinity Broadcasting\n\nClass A common stock resulting in the issuance of approximately 232\n\nmillion shares of Viacom Class B Common Stock.\n\n. On August 24, 2000, Infinity Broadcasting completed the acquisition of\n\n18 radio stations from Clear Channel Communications Inc. for $1.4\n\nbillion. The acquisition resulted in Infinity Broadcasting expanding\n\ninto five new top 50 radio markets and owning over 180 radio stations.\n\nDuring June 2000, Infinity Broadcasting completed the acquisition of\n\nGiraudy SA, one of France's largest outdoor advertising companies, for\n\napproximately $400 million. Infinity Broadcasting also acquired SMA\n\nSocieta Manifesti ed Affissione S.p.A, one of the leading Italian\n\noutdoor media sales companies, for approximately $90 million.\n\n. On November 3, 2000, the Company announced an agreement to acquire BET\n\nHoldings II, Inc. (\"BET\"), which operates the BET: BLACK ENTERTAINMENT\n\nTELEVISION(R) and BET ON JAZZ(R) cable networks. On January 23, 2001,\n\nthe Company completed its acquisition of BET for a total purchase price\n\nof approximately $3.0 billion, which principally represents the issuance\n\nof approximately 43.4 million shares of Viacom Class B Common Stock and\n\nthe assumption by the Company of approximately $590 million in debt.\n\nBeginning in the first quarter of 2001, BET will be reported in the\n\nCable Networks segment.\n\nAs of March 19, 2001, National Amusements, Inc. (\"NAI\"), a closely held\n\ncorporation that owns and operates approximately 1,400 movie screens in the\n\nU.S., the U.K. and South America, beneficially owned approximately 68% of the\n\nCompany's Class A Common Stock, and approximately 11% of the Company's Class A\n\nCommon Stock and Class B Common Stock on a combined basis.

MTVN has entered into\n\nmulti-year global or regional music video licensing agreements with certain of\n\nthe major record companies. These agreements generally cover a three to five\n\nyear period and contain provisions regarding video debut and exclusivity for a\n\nlimited number of music videos in the U.S. MTVN also is negotiating and\n\nexpects to renew or initiate additional global or regional license agreements\n\nwith the other major record companies and independent labels. However, there\n\ncan be no assurance that such renewals or agreements can be concluded on\n\nfavorable terms (see \"Viacom Segments--Competition--Cable Networks\").\n\nMTVN derives revenues principally from two sources: the sale of time on its\n\nown networks to advertisers and the license of the networks to cable\n\ntelevision operators, DTH and other distributors. The sale of MTVN advertising\n\ntime is affected by viewer demographics, viewer ratings and market conditions\n\nfor advertising time. Adverse changes to any of these factors could have an\n\nadverse effect on revenues. In addition, continued consolidation among cable\n\noperators could have an adverse effect on MTVN's license fee revenue (see\n\n\"Viacom Segments--Competition--Cable Networks\").\n\nI-4\n\nInternational MTVN Program Services\n\nThe following table sets forth information regarding MTVN program services\n\noperated internationally:\n\nLaunch/\n\nRegional Commencement\n\nProgram Service Territory Ownership Feeds/Language(1) Date\n\n--------------- --------- --------- ----------------- ------------\n\nMTV Europe 40 territories, 100% by the 9 Regional Feeds Various: August\n\n(includes MTV: including all EU states, Company (U.K., Netherlands, 1987-2000.\n\nMusic Television Eastern and Central Scandinavia, Poland,\n\nand MTV Base, Europe, South Africa, Spain, France,\n\nMTV Extra and certain countries in the Central, South and\n\nMTV2) former Soviet Union, the European) all in or\n\nMiddle East, Egypt, mainly in English\n\nFaroe Islands, Israel, (except for Central\n\nLiechtenstein, Malta and presented in German,\n\nMoldova Poland presented in\n\nPolish and South\n\npresented in Italian)\n\nMTV Latin Latin America, the 100% by the 3 Regional Feeds in October 1993\n\nAmerica Caribbean, Brazil and Company Spanish\n\nthe U.S.\n\nMTV Brasil Brazil Joint Venture Portuguese October 1990\n\n(with Abril\n\nS.A.)\n\nMTV Asia Taiwan, certain Joint Venture English, Mandarin, April 1995\n\nprovinces in China*, (with PolyGram Bahasa Indonesian,\n\nBrunei, Thailand, N.V.)

This unit\n\nhas produced and distributed seven of the top ten pay-per-view events of all\n\ntime, including the top two: Tyson vs. Holyfield I and Holyfield vs. Tyson II.\n\nSHOWTIME EVENT TELEVISION has also been instrumental in bringing other events\n\nto the viewing public, such as DORITOS PRESENTS DREW CAREY'S IMPROV ALL STARS,\n\nas well as numerous music concerts, including THE LAST KISS, SPICE GIRLS IN\n\nCONCERT--WILD!, THE BACKSTREET BOYS, TINA TURNER and THE ROLLING STONES.\n\nThe costs of acquiring premium television rights to programming and\n\nproducing original motion pictures and series are the principal expenses of\n\nSNI. In order to exhibit theatrical motion pictures on premium subscription\n\ntelevision, SNI enters into commitments to acquire rights, with an emphasis on\n\nacquiring exclusive rights for SHOWTIME and THE MOVIE CHANNEL, from major or\n\nindependent motion picture producers and other distributors. SNI's exhibition\n\nrights cover the U.S. and may, on a contract-by-contract basis, cover\n\nadditional territories. SNI has the exclusive U.S. premium subscription\n\ntelevision rights to all PARAMOUNT PICTURES' feature films theatrically\n\nreleased beginning January 1, 1998, as well as non-exclusive rights to certain\n\ntitles from PARAMOUNT PICTURES' film library (see \"Viacom Segments--\n\nEntertainment\"). SNI also has significant theatrical motion picture license\n\nagreements with other motion picture producers and distributors, including\n\nMetro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios Inc. (\"MGM\"), Artisan Pictures Inc., and Buena\n\nVista Television (a subsidiary of The Walt Disney Company) for Dimension Films\n\ntheatrical pictures, covering motion pictures initially theatrically released\n\nthrough dates ranging from December 31, 2001 to December 31, 2008. Theatrical\n\nmotion pictures that are licensed to SNI on an exclusive basis are generally\n\nexhibited first on SHOWTIME and THE MOVIE CHANNEL after an initial period or\n\n\"window\" for theatrical, home video and pay-per-view exhibition and before the\n\nperiod commenced for standard broadcast television and basic cable television\n\nexhibition. Many of the motion pictures which appear on FLIX have been\n\npreviously available for standard broadcast and other exhibitions (but are\n\nshown on FLIX unedited and commercial-free).\n\nSNI also arranges for the development, production, acquisition and, in many\n\ncases, distribution of original programs, series and motion pictures. SNI's\n\noriginal series include RESURRECTION BLVD., the first English-language U.S.\n\ndramatic television series that predominantly features Hispanics both in front\n\nof and behind the\n\nI-6\n\ncamera, and SOUL FOOD, a series (based on the theatrical motion picture of the\n\nsame name) that follows the struggles, rivalries and triumphs of a multi-\n\ngenerational African-American family. SNI's original motion pictures have\n\nreceived numerous industry awards over the years, including the prestigious\n\nGolden Globe Award for \"Best Mini-Series or Motion Picture Made for\n\nTelevision\" for 2000. As part of its original programming strategy, SNI\n\npremiered 30 original motion pictures on SHOWTIME in 2000, and expects to\n\npremiere approximately 35 original motion pictures in 2001. The producers of\n\nsome of SNI's original motion pictures are given an opportunity to seek a\n\ntheatrical release prior to such pictures' exhibition on SHOWTIME or THE MOVIE\n\nCHANNEL. If the producers are not successful in obtaining such a theatrical\n\nrelease, these pictures then premiere in the U.S. on SHOWTIME or THE MOVIE\n\nCHANNEL. SNI has entered into and plans to continue to enter into co-\n\nfinancing, co-production and/or co-distribution arrangements with other\n\nparties to reduce the net cost to SNI for its original motion pictures. In\n\n2000, Hallmark Entertainment Distribution LLC, PARAMOUNT TELEVISION and MGM\n\nwere the predominant co-producers, co-financiers and co-distributors of SNI's\n\noriginal motion pictures, programs and series for that calendar year.\n\nBLOCKBUSTER and SNI have an agreement whereby BLOCKBUSTER will license from\n\nSNI the exclusive domestic home video rights to up to 180 SNI original motion\n\npictures and other programs over the period from April 1, 2000 through March\n\n31, 2005.\n\nCable Networks Joint Ventures. COMEDY CENTRAL(R), a joint venture of the\n\nCompany and Home Box Office (\"HBO\"), a unit of AOL Time Warner Inc., is an\n\nadvertiser-supported basic cable television program service which features\n\ncomedy programming, including SOUTH PARK. The Company is a joint venturer in\n\nGULF DTH ENTERTAINMENT LDC, a satellite direct-to-home platform offering the\n\nfollowing channels in the Middle East: MTV, VH1, NICKELODEON, TV LAND and THE\n\nPARAMOUNT COMEDY CHANNEL(TM). A joint venture between NICKELODEON and Sesame\n\nWorkshop (formerly Children\"s Television Workshop) operates NOGGIN, a 24-hour,\n\nseven-days-a-week, non-commercial children's educational program service,\n\ndistributed by digital cable and satellite, which includes a related online\n\nservice. NOGGIN's purpose is to educate and entertain 2 to 12 year olds.\n\nNOGGIN's programming line-up includes a mix of live action, news, animated and\n\npuppet shows, including many acclaimed series such as Sesame Street, Electric\n\nCompany and BLUE'S CLUES after their initial network runs. MTV Polska, a joint\n\nventure between MTV Networks BV, the Dutch subsidiary of MTV Networks Europe,\n\nand UPC Programming BV, was established to create, produce and broadcast two\n\nnew channels: MTV Polska, and VH1 Polska. MTV Polska is broadcast by cable and\n\nsatellite throughout Poland.\n\nTelevision\n\nThe Television segment consists of the CBS and UPN television networks, 39\n\nowned broadcast television stations, and the Company's television production\n\nand syndication business.\n\nTelevision Networks. The CBS TELEVISION NETWORK(TM) through CBS NEWS(TM),\n\nCBS SPORTS(TM) and CBS ENTERTAINMENT(TM) distributes a comprehensive schedule\n\nof news and public affairs broadcasts, sports and entertainment programming,\n\nand feature films to more than 200 domestic affiliates, 16 of the Company's\n\nowned and operated television stations, and to certain overseas affiliated\n\nstations. The affiliates serve, in the aggregate, all 50 states and the\n\nDistrict of Columbia, reaching virtually every television home in the United\n\nStates. The CBS TELEVISION NETWORK is responsible for sales of advertising\n\ntime for its network broadcasts.\n\nCBS NEWS operates a worldwide news organization, providing the CBS\n\nTELEVISION NETWORK and the CBS RADIO NETWORK(R) with regularly scheduled news\n\nand public affairs broadcasts, including 60 MINUTES, the pioneering news\n\nmagazine now in its 33rd year, and its offspring, 60 MINUTES II, the CBS\n\nEVENING NEWS WITH DAN RATHER, 48 HOURS, THE EARLY SHOW, FACE THE NATION, THE\n\nSATURDAY EARLY SHOW and CBS NEWS SUNDAY MORNING--as well as special reports.\n\nCBS NEWS maintains 18 news bureaus and offices around the world, in addition\n\nto its headquarters operations in New York City. CBS Radio News serves more\n\nthan 2000 radio stations with hourly newscasts, instant coverage of breaking\n\nstories, special reports, updates, features, customized reports and news feed\n\nmaterial. Among its many features\n\nI-7\n\nare \"World News Roundup,\" and \"The World Tonight.\" CBS News Productions, the\n\noff-network production company created by CBS NEWS, produces original\n\nnonfiction programming for domestic and international outlets, including the\n\ncable television, home video, CD-ROM, audio-book and in-flight markets, as\n\nwell as schools and libraries.\n\nCBS SPORTS broadcasts comprehensive regular-season golf and college\n\nbasketball lineups on network television, in addition to the NFL's American\n\nFootball Conference schedule and championship games. CBS SPORTS' 2000-2001\n\nbroadcast schedule was highlighted by Super Bowl XXXV. Among the events CBS\n\nSPORTS airs are THE NFL TODAY; NCAA basketball, including the men's Final Four\n\nand championship games; golf, including the Masters and PGA Championship; the\n\nU.S. Open Tennis Championships; college football; CBS SPORTS SPECTACULAR,\n\nincluding track and field and gymnastics, and NCAA championships, including\n\nthe College World Series. Extending its franchises off the field, CBS SPORTS\n\nhas launched a licensing program that will showcase its logo on apparel and\n\nsports equipment and has formed a marketing unit to develop licensing,\n\nmerchandising, multimedia and other business opportunities for advertisers and\n\nevent organizers.\n\nCBS ENTERTAINMENT is responsible for acquiring or developing and scheduling\n\nthe entertainment programming presented on the CBS TELEVISION NETWORK which\n\nincludes primetime comedy and drama series, new television movies and mini-\n\nseries, theatrical films, specials, children's programs, daytime dramas, game\n\nshows and late-night broadcasts. In the past year, the Company introduced to\n\nU.S. audiences the highly successful reality-based SURVIVOR series. CBS\n\nENTERTAINMENT has introduced two dramas in the 2000-2001 season, CSI: CRIME\n\nSCENE INVESTIGATION and THE DISTRICT, and a new comedy YES, DEAR. Its shows\n\ninclude EVERYBODY LOVES RAYMOND, BECKER, THE KING OF QUEENS, JUDGING AMY,\n\nTOUCHED BY AN ANGEL, JAG and FAMILY LAW. The division presents two movie\n\nfranchises, a lineup of specials that includes THE GRAMMY AWARDS, THE CMA\n\nAWARDS and THE KENNEDY CENTER HONORS, and THE LATE SHOW WITH DAVID LETTERMAN.\n\nThe CBS Daytime lineup and the drama THE YOUNG AND THE RESTLESS have been\n\nrated number one in the daypart by Nielsen Media Research for 12 consecutive\n\nyears.\n\nIn 1997, the Company acquired a 50% interest in the UNITED PARAMOUNT\n\nNETWORK(R) (\"UPN\") from BHC Communications, Inc. (\"BHC\"), a subsidiary of\n\nChris-Craft Industries, Inc. In March 2000, BHC sold to the Company the\n\nremaining 50% interest in UPN for $5 million. After the May 2000 merger with\n\nCBS, pursuant to which the Company acquired the CBS TELEVISION NETWORK, the\n\nFederal Communications Commission (the \"FCC\" or the \"Commission\") ordered the\n\nCompany to come into compliance with its rule prohibiting a single entity from\n\noperating two networks within 12 months of the merger closing date. The FCC\n\nsubsequently proposed to eliminate this rule. (See \"Viacom Segments--\n\nRegulation--Broadcasting\").\n\nAt December 31, 2000, UPN provided 23 hours of programming a week,\n\nincluding two-hour prime-time programming blocks five nights per week, to\n\naffiliates in 177 U.S. television markets, reaching approximately 96% of all\n\nU.S. television households, including secondary affiliates. Nineteen of the\n\nCompany's owned television stations and two stations which the Company\n\nprograms pursuant to local marketing agreements (\"LMAs\") are affiliates of\n\nUPN.\n\nTelevision Stations. The Company owns 39 television stations, all of which\n\noperate under licenses granted by the FCC pursuant to the Communications Act\n\nof 1934, as amended (the \"Communications Act\"). The licenses are renewable\n\nevery eight years. In addition to these 39 owned stations, the Company\n\noperates two additional commercial television stations--(WTVX-TV in West Palm\n\nBeach--Ft. Pierce, FL and WLWC-TV in Providence, RI--New Bedford, MA),\n\npursuant to LMAs.\n\nThe Company's television stations are located in the 12 largest, and 18 of\n\nthe top 20, television markets in the United States. Consistent with the 1999\n\nliberalization of the FCC's local ownership rules, the Company has duopolies\n\nin 6 major markets: Philadelphia (market #4), Boston (market #6), Dallas\n\n(market #7), Detroit (market #9), Miami (market #16) and Pittsburgh (market\n\n#20). The 39 owned stations reach approximately 48% of all U.S. television\n\nhouseholds, which equals approximately 41% of U.S. television households under\n\nthe FCC\n\nI-8\n\nnational ownership limitation. The FCC's order approving the merger of Viacom\n\nand CBS requires that the Company be in compliance with the FCC's national\n\nownership limitation of 35% by May 4, 2001. The Company has challenged the\n\nrule in federal court and is seeking a stay of the requirement to come into\n\ncompliance with the limit pending judicial review of the national ownership\n\ncap (See \"Viacom Segments--Regulation--Broadcasting\").\n\nThe stations produce news and broadcast public affairs and other\n\nprogramming to serve their local markets and offer CBS or UPN television\n\nnetwork and syndicated programming. Many of the Company's television stations\n\ncurrently operate Web sites which promote the stations' talent and\n\nprogramming, and provide news, information and entertainment, as well as other\n\nservices.\n\nCurrently, broadcast signals are, for the most part, transmitted in analog\n\nform. However, in April 1997, the FCC assigned each existing television\n\nstation a six MHz channel to be used for the broadcast of digital television.\n\nThe FCC adopted a time schedule under which stations are required (absent\n\nconditions beyond their control) to construct digital transmission facilities\n\nand begin digital operations. The schedule has staggered deadlines depending\n\nupon a station's market size and whether the station is affiliated with a\n\nmajor broadcast television network (CBS, ABC, NBC, or FOX). Under the\n\nschedule, the Company was required to construct digital transmission\n\nfacilities for its eight CBS network affiliated stations in the top ten\n\nmarkets by May 1, 1999, and by November 1, 1999, for its seven CBS network\n\naffiliated stations in the 11th through 30th markets. The Company is required\n\nto construct digital facilities for the five CBS network affiliated stations\n\nin markets below the top 30, as well as for its UPN network affiliated\n\nstations in all markets, by May 1, 2002. The Company is currently transmitting\n\ndigital broadcasts for CBS network affiliated owned and operated stations in\n\nNew York, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, San Francisco, Boston, Dallas (low\n\npower), Detroit, Pittsburgh and Baltimore. The Company is currently\n\ntransmitting digital broadcasts for UPN network affiliated owned and operated\n\nstations in Dallas and Detroit.\n\nI-9\n\nTelevision Stations\n\nThe table below sets forth the 39 television stations owned by the Company\n\nand the two television stations operated by the Company pursuant to LMAs.\n\nMarket Type/ Network\n\nStation and Metropolitan Area Served(1) Rank(2) Channel Affiliation\n\n- --------------------------------------- ------- ------- -----------\n\nWCBS-TV............................................. 1 VHF/2 CBS\n\nNew York, NY\n\nKCBS-TV............................................. 2 VHF/2 CBS\n\nLos Angeles, CA\n\nWBBM-TV............................................. 3 VHF/2 CBS\n\nChicago, IL\n\nKYW-TV.............................................. 4 VHF/3 CBS\n\nPhiladelphia, PA\n\nWPSG-TV............................................. 4 UHF/57 UPN\n\nPhiladelphia, PA\n\nKPIX-TV............................................. 5 VHF/5 CBS\n\nSan Francisco, CA\n\nWBZ-TV.............................................. 6 VHF/4 CBS\n\nBoston, MA\n\nWSBK-TV............................................. 6 UHF/38 UPN\n\nBoston, MA\n\nKTVT-TV............................................. 7 VHF/11 CBS\n\nDallas-FT.

The Company, through CBS ENTERPRISES\n\n(including KING WORLD PRODUCTIONS and CBS BROADCAST INTERNATIONAL), PARAMOUNT\n\nTELEVISION, SPELLING TELEVISION(R) (including BIG TICKET TELEVISION(R)) and\n\nVIACOM PRODUCTIONS acquires or produces, and distributes programming worldwide\n\nincluding series, miniseries, specials and made-for-television movies\n\nprimarily for broadcast on network television, and first-run and off-network\n\nsyndicated programming.\n\nThe Company's current network programming includes ED (NBC); FRASIER (NBC);\n\nBECKER (CBS); DIAGNOSIS MURDER (CBS); JAG (CBS); SOME OF MY BEST FRIENDS\n\n(CBS); SABRINA, THE TEENAGE WITCH (WB); MOESHA (UPN); SEVEN DAYS (UPN); THE\n\nPARKERS (UPN); STAR TREK: VOYAGER (UPN); CHARMED (WB); 7TH HEAVEN (WB); THAT'S\n\nLIFE (CBS); and GIRLFRIENDS (UPN). Generally, a network will license a\n\nspecified number of episodes for exhibition on the network in the U.S. during\n\na license period. The bulk of remaining distribution rights, including foreign\n\nand off-network syndication rights, are typically retained by the Company. The\n\nepisodic network license fee is normally less than the costs of producing each\n\nseries episode; however, in many cases, the Company has been successful in\n\nrecouping a portion of its costs through domestic syndication of episodes\n\nafter their network runs or by obtaining international sales through its\n\nlicensing operations. Foreign sales are generally concurrent with U.S. network\n\nruns. Generally, a series must have a network run of at least three or four\n\nyears to be successfully sold in domestic syndication.\n\nIn off-network syndication, the Company distributes such series as CAROLINE\n\nIN THE CITY; EARLY EDITION; FRASIER; MOESHA; SABRINA, THE TEENAGE WITCH; 7TH\n\nHEAVEN; SISTER, SISTER; SPIN CITY; STAR TREK: VOYAGER and TOUCHED BY AN ANGEL.\n\nOutside the U.S., PARAMOUNT PICTURES INTERNATIONAL, WVI FILMS B.V. and CBS\n\nBROADCAST INTERNATIONAL distribute U.S. network series programming.\n\nThe Company produces and/or distributes programming for first-run\n\nsyndication which it sells directly to television stations in the U.S. on a\n\nmarket-by-market basis. The Company's first-run syndicated programming\n\nincludes such shows as ENTERTAINMENT TONIGHT, ENTERTAINMENT TONIGHT WEEKEND,\n\nHOLLYWOOD SQUARES, INSIDE EDITION, JEOPARDY!, JUDGE JOE BROWN, JUDGE JUDY,\n\nJUDGE MILLS LANE, MARTHA STEWART LIVING, MAXIMUM EXPOSURE, THE MONTEL WILLIAMS\n\nSHOW, THE OPRAH WINFREY SHOW, QUEEN OF SWORDS, REAL TV, RELIC HUNTER and WHEEL\n\nOF FORTUNE.\n\nThe Company produces and/or distributes original television programming to\n\nbasic cable program services (such as the television series ANY DAY NOW,\n\nBEYOND CHANCE and THE DIVISION, on Lifetime), including services in which the\n\nCompany has an interest, such as NICK AT NITE, TV LAND and VH1 in the U.S. and\n\nPARAMOUNT COMEDY CHANNEL in U.K. and Spain. It also produces and/or\n\ndistributes for premium subscription services programming such as SOUL FOOD,\n\nRESURRECTION BLVD. and THE CHRIS ISAAK SHOW. The Company also co-produces\n\nand/or distributes original television programming for foreign television\n\nexhibition, including such shows as HOPE ISLAND, HIGHER GROUND, LARGO WINCH\n\nand TRIBE.\n\nThe recognition of revenues for license fees for completed television\n\nprogramming in syndication and on basic cable is similar to that of feature\n\nfilms exhibited on television with license fees recorded as revenue in the\n\nyear that programming is available for exhibition which, among other reasons,\n\nmay cause substantial fluctuation in the Televsion segment's operating\n\nresults. At December 31, 2000, the unrecognized revenues attributable to\n\ntelevision program license agreements were approximately $622 million,\n\ncompared to approximately $462 million at December 31, 1999.\n\nInfinity\n\nInfinity's operations are focused on the out-of-home media business with\n\noperations in radio broadcasting through INFINITY BROADCASTING, and outdoor\n\nadvertising through INFINITY OUTDOOR and TDI. The\n\nI-12\n\nRadio Stations and Outdoor Displays table sets forth selected information with\n\nregard to Infinity's radio stations and outdoor displays in the top 25 U.S.\n\nradio markets. Infinity characterizes its radio and outdoor advertising\n\nbusinesses as out-of-home because a majority of radio listening, and virtually\n\nall viewing of outdoor advertising, takes place in automobiles, transit\n\nsystems, on the street and other locations outside the consumer's home.\n\nInfinity's strategy generally is to acquire out-of-home media properties in\n\nthe largest markets.\n\nInfinity Radio. INFINITY BROADCASTING, consisting of 184 radio stations\n\nserving 41 markets, accounted for approximately 13% of total 2000 U.S. radio\n\nadvertising expenditures. The Company's stations ranked first or second, in\n\nterms of 2000 pro forma radio revenues, in 30 out of the 41 markets in which\n\nthe Company operates stations. Approximately 91% of the Company's radio\n\nstations are located in the 50 largest radio markets in the United States, and\n\n62% and 97% of the Company's pro forma 2000 net radio revenues were generated\n\nin the 10 and 50 largest U.S. markets, respectively. The Company believes that\n\nthis focus on large markets makes it more appealing to advertisers, enables it\n\nto attract more highly skilled management, employees and on-air talent, and\n\nenables it to more efficiently manage its business and generate higher levels\n\nof cash flow than would be the case if it managed a larger number of smaller\n\nstations. Infinity owns the CBS RADIO NETWORK, which is managed by Westwood\n\nOne, Inc.\n\nInfinity's radio stations serve diverse target demographics through a broad\n\nrange of programming formats. This diversity provides advertisers with the\n\nconvenience to select stations to reach a targeted demographic group or to\n\nselect groups of stations and outdoor advertising properties to reach broad\n\ngroups of consumers within and across markets. This diversity also reduces its\n\ndependence on any single station, local economy, format or advertiser.\n\nInfinity seeks to maintain substantial diversity among its radio stations\n\nin many respects. The geographically wide-ranging stations serve diverse\n\ntarget demographics through a broad range of programming formats, such as\n\nrock, oldies, news/talk, adult contemporary, sports/talk and country, and\n\nInfinity has established leading franchises in news, sports, and personality\n\nprogramming. The overall mix of each radio station's programming is designed\n\nto fit the station's specific format and serve its local community. Infinity's\n\ngeneral programming strategy includes acquiring significant on-air talent and\n\nthe rights to broadcast sports franchises and news content for its radio\n\nstations. This strategy, in addition to developing loyal audiences for its\n\nradio stations, creates the opportunity to obtain additional revenues from\n\nsyndicating such programming franchises to other radio stations.\n\nOutdoor Advertising. INFINITY OUTDOOR and TDI sell advertising space on\n\nvarious media, including billboards, bulletins, buses, bus shelters and\n\nbenches, trains, train platforms and terminals throughout commuter rail\n\nsystems, mall posters and phone kiosks. Infinity has outdoor advertising\n\noperations in more than 90 markets in North America, and all 50 of the largest\n\nmetropolitan markets in the United States, 14 of the 15 largest metropolitan\n\nmarkets in Canada and all of the 45 largest metropolitan markets in Mexico.\n\nAdditionally, the Company has the exclusive rights to manage advertising space\n\nwithin the London Underground and on more than 90% of the buses in London and\n\nthe United Kingdom, has the exclusive rights to transit advertising in the\n\nRepublic of Ireland and parts of Northern Ireland, and has a variety of\n\noutdoor advertising displays in the Netherlands, France, Italy, Spain and\n\nFinland.\n\nThe substantial majority of Infinity's revenues are generated from the sale\n\nof local, regional and national advertising.

Through PARAMOUNT PICTURES, the Company\n\nproduces, finances and distributes feature motion pictures. Motion pictures\n\nare produced by PARAMOUNT PICTURES, produced by independent producers and\n\nfinanced in whole or in part by PARAMOUNT PICTURES, or produced by others and\n\ndistributed by PARAMOUNT PICTURES. Each picture is a separate and distinct\n\nproduct with its financial success dependent upon many factors, among which\n\ncost and public response are of fundamental importance. In general, motion\n\npictures produced or acquired for distribution by PARAMOUNT PICTURES are\n\nexhibited in U.S. and foreign theaters followed by videocassettes, discs and\n\nDVDs, pay-per-view television, premium subscription television, network\n\ntelevision, basic cable television and syndicated television exploitation.\n\nDuring 2000, PARAMOUNT PICTURES produced or co-produced and theatrically\n\nreleased 12 feature motion pictures in the U.S., including WONDER BOYS, RULES\n\nOF ENGAGEMENT, MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE 2, SHAFT and WHAT WOMEN WANT; THE ORIGINAL\n\nKINGS OF COMEDY produced by MTV FILMS in association with PARAMOUNT PICTURES;\n\nand SNOW DAY and RUGRATS IN PARIS: THE MOVIE produced by NICKELODEON MOVIES in\n\nassociation with PARAMOUNT PICTURES. PARAMOUNT PICTURES currently plans to\n\nrelease approximately 17 films in 2001 (which release plans may change due to\n\na variety of factors), including DOWN TO EARTH, ENEMY AT THE GATES, ALONG CAME\n\nA SPIDER, TOMB RAIDER, RAT RACE, DOMESTIC DISTURBANCE, FOUR FEATHERS, and\n\nVANILLA SKY, and ZOOLANDER produced by VH1 FILMS(TM) in association with\n\nPARAMOUNT PICTURES, SAVE THE LAST DANCE and ORANGE COUNTY produced by MTV\n\nFILMS in association with PARAMOUNT PICTURES, and JIMMY NEUTRON-BOY GENIUS\n\nproduced by NICKELODEON MOVIES in association with PARAMOUNT PICTURES.\n\nPARAMOUNT CLASSICS(TM), a division of PARAMOUNT PICTURES, released seven\n\nfilms in 2000, including SUNSHINE, THE VIRGIN SUICIDES, YOU CAN COUNT ON ME\n\nand THE GIFT. PARAMOUNT CLASSICS was established to handle the distribution of\n\nspecialized film product that may require alternative release strategies from\n\nfilms generally distributed by PARAMOUNT PICTURES. PARAMOUNT CLASSICS\n\ncurrently plans to release approximately six titles in 2001 (which release\n\nplans may change due to a variety of factors).\n\nIn seeking to limit PARAMOUNT PICTURES' financial exposure, the Company has\n\npursued a strategy with respect to a number of films of entering into\n\nagreements to distribute such films produced and/or financed, in whole or in\n\npart, with other parties. The parties to these arrangements include studio and\n\nnon-studio entities, both domestic and foreign. In various of these\n\narrangements, the other parties control certain distribution and other\n\nownership rights.\n\nPARAMOUNT PICTURES generally distributes its motion pictures for theatrical\n\nrelease outside the U.S. and Canada through United International Pictures\n\n(\"UIP\"), a company owned by the Company and an affiliate of Universal Studios,\n\nInc. (\"Universal\"). Pursuant to an agreement, UIP will continue to distribute\n\neach studio's films through 2006. PARAMOUNT PICTURES distributes its motion\n\npictures on videocassette and disc in the U.S. and Canada through PARAMOUNT\n\nHOME ENTERTAINMENT(TM) and outside the U.S. and Canada, generally through\n\nPARAMOUNT HOME ENTERTAINMENT INTERNATIONAL. Commencing April 2000, PARAMOUNT\n\nHOME ENTERTAINMENT INTERNATIONAL started releasing pictures in DVD format in\n\nEurope and Japan. PARAMOUNT PICTURES' feature films initially theatrically\n\nreleased in the U.S. on or after January 1, 1998 are exhibited exclusively (to\n\nU.S. premium subscription television) on SHOWTIME and THE MOVIE CHANNEL.\n\nPARAMOUNT PICTURES also distributes its motion pictures for premium\n\nsubscription, free and basic cable television release outside the U.S. and\n\nCanada and licenses its motion pictures to residential and hotel/motel pay-\n\nper-view, airlines, schools and universities.\n\nI-16\n\nDuring 2000, PARAMOUNT PICTURES INTERNATIONAL entered into an agreement\n\nwith DBS Satellite Services for pay television distribution rights in Israel\n\nfor current films, library films and television products and PARAMOUNT\n\nPICTURES INTERNATIONAL and WVI FILMS B.V. entered into an agreement with Movie\n\nTelevision Inc. for free television distribution rights in Japan for current\n\nmotion picture and television product. This latter agreement also includes\n\nfree television distribution rights in Japan for various motion picture and\n\ntelevision library product.\n\nIn addition to premium subscription television, most motion pictures are\n\nalso licensed for exhibition on broadcast and basic cable television, with\n\nfees generally collected in installments. All of the above license fees for\n\ntelevision exhibition (including international and U.S. premium television and\n\nbasic cable television) are recorded as revenue in the year that licensed\n\nfilms are available for such exhibition, which, among other reasons, may cause\n\nsubstantial fluctuation in PARAMOUNT PICTURES' operating results. At December\n\n31, 2000, the unrecognized revenues attributable to such licensing of\n\ncompleted films from PARAMOUNT PICTURES' license agreements were approximately\n\n$1.0 billion, compared to approximately $1.2 billion at December 31, 1999. At\n\nDecember 31, 2000, PARAMOUNT PICTURES had approximately 1,000 motion pictures\n\nin its library. The Company also has a library of additional motion picture\n\ntitles, most of which comprise the SPELLING ENTERTAINMENT(TM) library.\n\nThrough PARAMOUNT PICTURES and various of its affiliates, the Company is a\n\njoint venturer in a number of international program services, including THE\n\nPARAMOUNT COMEDY CHANNEL(TM) in the U.K., an afternoon and nighttime\n\n(including prime time) program service featuring comedies and films, which is\n\na joint venture with BSkyB. On March 1, 1999, the Company launched THE\n\nPARAMOUNT COMEDY CHANNEL(R) in Spain, a wholly owned, 24-hour program service,\n\nincluding a NICKELODEON program segment.\n\nTheatrical Exhibition. The Company's movie theater operations consist\n\nprimarily of FAMOUS PLAYERS in Canada and United Cinemas International (\"UCI\")\n\nin Europe, Latin America and Asia. At December 31, 2000, FAMOUS PLAYERS, a\n\nwholly owned subsidiary of the Company, operated approximately 880 screens in\n\n104 theaters across Canada. UCI, a 50%-owned joint venture of entities\n\naffiliated with the Company and Universal, operated as of December 31, 2000,\n\napproximately 970 screens in 113 theaters in the U.K., Ireland, Germany,\n\nAustria, Spain, Japan, Italy, Poland, Argentina, Brazil, Panama and Taiwan.\n\nAs of November 29, 1999, WF Cinema Holdings, L.P. (a limited partnership in\n\nwhich the Company owns a 50% interest and the other 50% is controlled by AOL\n\nTime Warner Inc., \"WF Cinema\") entered into agreements (the \"Asset\n\nAgreements\") with WestStar Cinemas, Inc., WestStar Real Estate, Inc., Colorado\n\nHoldings LLC and WestStar Holdings, Inc. (collectively, \"WestStar\"), which\n\nparties are the subject of a Chapter 11 Bankruptcy Code proceeding. Pursuant\n\nto the Asset Agreements, WF Cinema agreed to purchase from WestStar various\n\ntheaters and related assets for a purchase price of $90 million (which was\n\npaid during 2000) and other consideration. The theaters and assets which are\n\nthe subject of this transaction comprise in large part the assets that were\n\nsold by WF Cinema (then known as Cinamerica Theaters L.P.) to WestStar in\n\n1997. WF Cinema has disposed of or closed a number of the theaters that were\n\nacquired and currently intends to dispose of or close some of the remaining\n\ntheaters. The Company and AOL Time Warner have agreed to guarantee certain\n\nobligations of WF Cinema as part of these transactions. The Asset Agreements\n\nwere approved by the Bankruptcy Court on January 12, 2000, and the acquisition\n\nby WF Cinema closed on January 28, 2000.\n\nMusic Publishing. The FAMOUS MUSIC publishing companies own, control and/or\n\nadminister all or a portion of the copyright rights to more than 100,000\n\nmusical works (songs, scores, cues). These rights include the right to license\n\nand exploit such works, as well as the right to collect income generated by\n\nsuch licensing and exploitation.\n\nThe majority of rights acquired by FAMOUS MUSIC are derived from (i) music\n\nacquisition agreements entered into by PARAMOUNT PICTURES, PARAMOUNT\n\nTELEVISION, SPELLING TELEVISION, MTVN and various other divisions of the\n\nCompany respecting certain motion pictures, television programs and other\n\nproperties produced by such units and (ii) music acquisition agreements\n\nentered into directly by FAMOUS MUSIC with songwriters and music publishers,\n\nincluding exclusive songwriting agreements, catalog purchases and music\n\nadministration agreements.\n\nI-17\n\nParks. PARAMOUNT PARKS owns and operates five regional theme parks and a\n\nthemed attraction in the U.S. and Canada: PARAMOUNT'S CAROWINDS(R), in\n\nCharlotte, North Carolina; PARAMOUNT'S GREAT AMERICA(TM), in Santa Clara,\n\nCalifornia; PARAMOUNT'S KINGS DOMINION(TM), located near Richmond, Virginia;\n\nPARAMOUNT'S KINGS ISLAND(TM), located near Cincinnati, Ohio; PARAMOUNT\n\nCANADA'S WONDERLAND(R), located near Toronto, Ontario; and STAR TREK: THE\n\nEXPERIENCE(R), at the Las Vegas Hilton, a futuristic, interactive environment\n\nbased on the popular television and movie series. Each of the theme parks\n\nfeatures attractions, products and live shows based on various intellectual\n\nproperties of the Company.\n\nA substantial amount of the theme parks' income is generated during its\n\nseasonal operating period. Factors such as local economic conditions,\n\ncompetitors and their marketing/pricing actions, and extreme weather\n\nconditions could negatively impact the business' overall profitability if they\n\ncome into play during the operating season.\n\nVideo\n\nThe Company operates in the home video business through its approximately\n\n82% equity interest in Blockbuster Inc. As of December 31, 2000, the Company's\n\nvideo segment, which included BLOCKBUSTER's home video, DVD and video game\n\nrental and retailing operations operated or franchised approximately 7,700\n\nstores in the U.S., its territories and 25 other countries. BLOCKBUSTER also\n\noperates its Internet site, \"blockbuster.com\" and is exploring various forms\n\nof electronic entertainment delivery including video-on-demand.\n\nIn its stores, which operate primarily under the highly recognized\n\nBLOCKBUSTER brand name, BLOCKBUSTER offers video movies and video games\n\nprimarily for rental and also offers certain titles for purchase. BLOCKBUSTER\n\nalso offers DVDs for rental and for sale in most of its U.S. stores. In\n\naddition, BLOCKBUSTER offers previously-viewed tapes and previously-viewed\n\nvideo games for sale. During 2000, BLOCKBUSTER expanded its traditional video\n\nrental service through an agreement with DIRECTV, Inc. (\"DIRECTV\"), a provider\n\nof digital television entertainment service. Pursuant to this agreement,\n\nBLOCKBUSTER is now marketing DIRECTV System equipment and DIRECTV(R)\n\nprogramming packages in over 3,800 of BLOCKBUSTER's U.S. stores. Blockbuster\n\nand DIRECTV have also announced that they plan to introduce a co-branded pay-\n\nper-view service during 2001. BLOCKBUSTER also launched a movies-on-demand\n\nservice on a trial basis in four cities in December 2000. In addition, in\n\nFebruary 2001, BLOCKBUSTER entered into a strategic alliance with RadioShack\n\nCorporation for the purpose of introducing a RadioShack store-within-a-store\n\nconcept inside BLOCKBUSTER.\n\nBLOCKBUSTER acquires its VHS movies primarily pursuant to revenue-sharing\n\narrangements that were initially implemented in 1998 with the major motion\n\npicture studios, including PARAMOUNT PICTURES. BLOCKBUSTER entered into these\n\narrangements in order to increase the quantity and selection of newly released\n\nvideo titles and to satisfy its customers' demand for newly released videos\n\nearlier. For titles acquired under these arrangements, revenue-sharing\n\ngenerally allows BLOCKBUSTER to license videocassettes for minimal up-front\n\npayments with a percentage of the U.S. rental revenues shared with the studios\n\nover a contractually determined period of time. In addition to acquiring\n\nproducts pursuant to revenue-sharing agreements, BLOCKBUSTER purchases certain\n\nproducts that are not subject to revenue-sharing agreements, at wholesale\n\nprices. BLOCKBUSTER also purchases \"sell-through\" titles, which are movies\n\nthat are released by the studios at relatively low initial prices in order to\n\ngenerate consumer demand to purchase, rather than rent, them. Almost all DVDs\n\nare also released by the studios at sell-through prices. In addition,\n\nBLOCKBUSTER also acquires and offers a wide variety of independent and lower-\n\ncost movies that are generally exclusively available for a specified period of\n\ntime at its stores. BLOCKBUSTER also rents video game consoles and DVD players\n\nin most of its U.S. stores.\n\nAs with other retail outlets, there is a distinct seasonal pattern to the\n\nhome video and video games business, with particularly weaker business in\n\nApril and May, due in part to improved weather and Daylight Savings Time, and\n\nin September and October, due in part to the start of school and the\n\nintroduction of new television programs.\n\nI-18\n\nPublishing\n\nSIMON & SCHUSTER publishes and distributes consumer hardcover books, trade\n\npaperbacks, mass-market paperbacks, children's books, audiobooks, electronic\n\nbooks and CD-ROM products in the U.S. and internationally. SIMON & SCHUSTER's\n\nflagship imprints include SIMON & SCHUSTER, POCKET BOOKS, SCRIBNER and THE\n\nFREE PRESS. SIMON & SCHUSTER also develops special imprints and publishes\n\ntitles based on MTV, VH1, NICKELODEON and PARAMOUNT PICTURES products. SIMON &\n\nSCHUSTER distributes its products directly and through third parties. SIMON &\n\nSCHUSTER also delivers content and promotes its products on Internet sites\n\noperated by various imprints or linked to individual titles.\n\nIn 2000, SIMON & SCHUSTER published 87 titles which were New York Times\n\nbestsellers, including seven New York Times number one bestsellers. Best-\n\nselling titles released in 2000 include \"NOTHING LIKE IT IN THE WORLD\" by\n\nStephen Ambrose, \"JOE DIMAGGIO: THE HERO'S LIFE\" by Richard Ben Cramer,\n\n\"BEFORE I SAY GOODBYE\" by Mary Higgins Clark, \"BLACKBIRD\" by Jennifer Lauck,\n\n\"TALKING DIRTY WITH THE QUEEN OF CLEAN\" by Linda Cobb, \"ON WRITING\" by Stephen\n\nKing, \"AN INVITATION TO THE WHITE HOUSE\" by Hillary Rodham Clinton, and\n\n\"OLIVIA\" by Ian Falconer, as well as a number of RUGRATS and BLUE'S CLUE'S\n\nbooks, featuring the popular NICKELODEON characters.\n\nSIMON & SCHUSTER AUDIO(R) publishes audio editions of prominent works\n\npublished by SIMON & SCHUSTER and by other publishers, as well as the\n\nPIMSLEUR(R) line of language instruction. Major titles released as audiobooks\n\nin 2000 include \"SHOPGIRL\" by Steve Martin, \"THE MILLIONAIRE NEXT DOOR\" by\n\nThomas J. Stanley and William D. Danko, and \"WHO MOVED MY CHEESE?\" by Spencer\n\nJohnson.\n\nTitles published by SIMON & SCHUSTER INTERACTIVE(R) generally consist of\n\nCD-ROM editions or product extensions of well-known book publishing properties\n\nor titles associated with recognized authors and Company properties, including\n\nsuch 2000 titles as \"STAR TREK DEEP SPACE NINE: THE FALLEN,\" \"SABRINA THE\n\nANIMATED SERIES: MAGICAL ADVENTURE\" and \"M&M'S: THE LOST FORMULAS.\"\n\nSIMON & SCHUSTER ONLINE(TM), through \"SimonSays.com,\" publishes original\n\ncontent, builds reader communities, and promotes and sells SIMON & SCHUSTER's\n\nbooks and products over the Internet. In 2000, SIMON & SCHUSTER ONLINE, in\n\nconjunction with SCRIBNER, published Stephen King\"s \"RIDING THE BULLET,\" an\n\noriginal story released exclusively in digital form.\n\nInternational publishing includes the international distribution of\n\nEnglish-language titles through SIMON & SCHUSTER UK(TM) and SIMON & SCHUSTER\n\nAUSTRALIA(TM) and other distributors, as well as the publication of local\n\ntitles by SIMON & SCHUSTER UK and SIMON & SCHUSTER AUSTRALIA.\n\nThe consumer publishing marketplace is subject to increased periods of\n\ndemand in the summer months and during the end-of-year holiday season. Major\n\nnew title releases drive a significant portion of SIMON & SCHUSTER's sales\n\nthroughout the year.\n\nConsumer books are generally sold on a fully returnable basis, resulting in\n\nsignificant product returns. In the international markets, the Company is\n\nsubject to global trends and local economic conditions.\n\nOnline\n\nThrough its 90% equity interest in THE MTVi GROUP, L.P. (\"MTVi\") and\n\nthrough NICKELODEON ONLINE(TM), the Company operates Internet sites which are\n\ntargeted to the current audiences of its various MTV, VH1 and NICKELODEON\n\ntelevision program services worldwide, as well as to new online audiences. The\n\nremaining 10% interest in MTVi is owned by Liberty Digital, Inc. In addition\n\nto providing entertainment and information on such Web sites, the Company also\n\nsells Company-licensed and third-party merchandise.\n\nI-19\n\nMTVi has numerous music Web site destinations around the world, including\n\nMTV.com, VH1.com, Country.com and SonicNet.com. In December 2000, MTVi's Web\n\nsites attracted over 4 million unique visitors, according to Media Metrix, a\n\nleading online audience research measurement service. MTV.com offers users the\n\nlatest music news, information on artists and MTV programs, and interactive\n\nentertainment through convergence programs such as Direct Effect (DFX), Total\n\nRequest Live (TRL) and VJ for a Day. VH1.com offers users convergent\n\nentertainment, music news, fan club information, daily polls and community\n\nfeatures.\n\nMTVi currently obtains much of its content from record labels, music\n\npublishers and artists. While MTVi obtains certain rights to some of such\n\ncontent (such as performance rights of song composers and non-interactive\n\nrights to digital transmission of recordings) pursuant to statutory compulsory\n\nlicenses, the royalties payable for such compulsory licenses are not yet\n\nestablished or have not yet been negotiated. Other rights are not subject to\n\ncompulsory licenses and must be negotiated with the individual record labels\n\nand other providers. If these providers begin to charge significant fees for\n\ntheir content, or otherwise alter or discontinue their relationship with MTVi,\n\nthen MTVi's content offering and business, financial condition and operating\n\nresults could be adversely affected. In addition, because the laws relating to\n\nonline rights for music and other copyrighted works are evolving, it is\n\npossible that parties from whom MTVi currently does not obtain licenses will\n\ndemand that MTVi obtain them and pay certain fees for usage (see \"Viacom\n\nSegments--Regulation--Intellectual Property\").\n\nNICKELODEON ONLINE operates Web sites that feature NICKELODEON properties,\n\nincluding Nick.com, NickJR.com, TVLand.com, Nick-at-Nite.com, Gas.Nick.com and\n\nTeachers.Nick.com. Nick.com is a leading Web site for kids, offering\n\nconvergent entertainment, online games, entertainment tools and services,\n\nInternet radio, information on Nickelodeon celebrities and programs and other\n\ncontent for kids. NickJR.com offers online content for parents and their pre-\n\nschool aged kids, including advice, parent-to-parent communities, e-commerce,\n\nas well as a preschool area featuring interactive games, art, stories and\n\nmusic. In December 2000, NICKELODEON ONLINE's Web sites attracted over 2.8\n\nmillion unique visitors, according to Media Metrix.\n\nIn addition, the Company operates two Web sites, CBS.com and CBSNews.com,\n\nwhich draw visitors from CBS TELEVISION NETWORK programming in all dayparts\n\n(daytime, primetime and late night). CBS.com integrates local, national and\n\ninternational news, weather, sports and information on CBS TELEVISION NETWORK\n\nprogramming in one location. The site provides information on CBS\n\nENTERTAINMENT programming (including such features as David Letterman's \"Top\n\nTen\" list). In early 2001, as a result of the debut of CBS's reality show,\n\nSURVIVOR: THE AUSTRALIAN OUTBACK, CBS.com reached its highest visitor levels\n\never. The site also provides links to a number of sites in which the Company\n\nowns an equity interest, including CBS MarketWatch, CBS SportsLine and CBS\n\nHealthWatch.\n\nCBSNews.com brings the coverage and reputation of CBS NEWS to the Internet,\n\nincluding multimedia coverage of top stories, coverage of breaking news events\n\nand information from CBS NEWS investigations.\n\nDuring 2000, the Online segment included an investment in iWon, Inc., which\n\noperates an Internet portal. Subsequent to December 31, 2000, the successor to\n\niWon will be included with the Company's other Internet investments. Effective\n\nJanuary 1, 2001, the Company will present its online businesses as part of the\n\nCable Networks and Television segments. Online revenues are primarily\n\ngenerated by advertising revenues derived from online advertising and on-air\n\npromotion and by the sale of merchandise.\n\nThe Company also operates Internet sites through its other businesses, such\n\nas PARAMOUNT PICTURES, INFINITY BROADCASTING, BLOCKBUSTER, SHOWTIME and SIMON\n\n& SCHUSTER, for the purpose of marketing and commerce. Such activity is not\n\nreported as part of the Online segment.\n\nInternet Investments: The Company holds minority investments in five public\n\nInternet companies: Sportsline.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: SPLN), which publishes\n\nseveral sports Internet sites including CBS.sportsline.com; MarketWatch.com,\n\nInc. (NASDAQ: MKTW), which publishes financial and market data Internet sites\n\nincluding CBS.marketwatch.com; Hollywood Media Corp. (NASDAQ: HOLL), which\n\npublishes entertainment content Internet sites, including hollywood.com;\n\nSwitchboard Incorporated (NASDAQ: SWBD),\n\nI-20\n\nwhich publishes local information directory Internet sites, including\n\nswitchboard.com; and Medicalogic/Medscape, Inc. (NASDAQ: MDLI), which\n\npublishes consumer health Internet sites including\n\nCBShealthwatch.medscape.com. Other Internet investments of the Company include\n\nminority investments in Office.com, Inc., Content Commerce, L.P., RX.com, Inc.\n\nand Wrenchead.com, Inc.\n\nCompetition\n\nCorporate mergers consummated in recent years have resulted in greater\n\nconsolidation in the entertainment industries, which may also present\n\nsignificant competitive challenges to several of the Company's businesses.\n\nCable Networks\n\nMTV Networks. MTVN services compete with other basic cable program services\n\nfor channel space and compensation for carriage from cable television\n\noperators, DTH and other multichannel distributors. MTVN also competes for\n\nadvertising revenue with other basic cable and broadcast television networks,\n\nand radio and print media. For basic cable television networks such as the\n\nMTVN services, advertising revenues derived by each program service depend on\n\nthe number of households subscribing to the service through local cable\n\noperators and other distributors in addition to household and demographic\n\nviewership as determined by research companies such as Nielsen Media Research.\n\nMTVN services also compete with other cable services and broadcast television\n\nfor the acquisition of popular programming.\n\nCertain major record companies have launched music-based program services\n\noutside the U.S., including, but not limited to: Channel V, which is jointly\n\nowned and operated in Asia and Australia by Star TV and four major record\n\nlabels; and Viva and Viva 2, German-language music channels distributed in\n\nGermany and owned in large part by four major record labels. In addition to\n\nthe competition referred to above, MTVN's music-based program services compete\n\nwith other music-based television program services and blocks for distribution\n\nby cable, satellite and other systems, and for distribution license fees and\n\nadvertising revenues.\n\nChildren-oriented programming blocks are currently exhibited on a number of\n\nU.S. broadcast television networks, including, among others, \"Fox Kids,\"\n\n\"Kids' WB\" and a Saturday morning block on ABC, all of which compete with\n\nNICKELODEON for advertising revenue. There are also a number of other U.S.\n\ncable television program services featuring children-oriented programming,\n\nincluding the Cartoon Network, the Disney Channel and the Fox Family Channel.\n\nIn addition to the competition referred to above, NICKELODEON competes\n\ninternationally with other television program services and blocks targeted at\n\nchildren for distribution by cable, satellite and other systems, and for\n\ndistribution license fees and advertising revenue.\n\nShowtime Networks Inc. Competition among premium subscription television\n\nprogram services in the U.S. is primarily dependent on: (i) the acquisition\n\nand packaging of an adequate number of recently released quality motion\n\npictures and the production, acquisition and packaging of original motion\n\npictures, original series and other original programs; and (ii) the offering\n\nof prices, marketing and advertising support and other incentives to cable\n\noperators and other distributors for carriage so as to favorably position and\n\npackage SNI's premium subscription television program services to subscribers.\n\nHBO is the dominant company in the U.S. premium subscription television\n\ncategory, offering two premium subscription television program services, the\n\nHBO service and Cinemax. SNI is second to HBO with a significantly smaller\n\nshare of the premium subscription television category. Starz Encore Media\n\nGroup (an affiliate of AT&T Corp.) owns the third principal premium\n\nsubscription television program service in the U.S., Starz!, which features\n\nrecently released motion pictures and competes with SNI's and HBO's premium\n\nprogram services.\n\nTelevision\n\nThe television broadcast environment is highly competitive. The principal\n\nmethods of competition in broadcast television are the acquisition of popular\n\nprogramming and the development of audience interest\n\nI-21\n\nthrough programming and promotions in order to sell advertising at profitable\n\nrates. Broadcast networks like CBS and UPN compete for audience, advertising\n\nrevenues and programming with other broadcast networks, independent television\n\nstations, basic cable program services as well as other media, including\n\nsatellite television services, videocassettes, DVDs and the Internet.\n\nTelevision stations compete for programming and for advertising revenues with\n\nother stations in their respective coverage areas and, in some cases, with\n\nlarger station groups for programming, and in the case of advertising\n\nrevenues, with other local media. In addition, the CBS and UPN television\n\nnetworks compete with other television networks to secure affiliations with\n\nindependently owned television stations in markets across the country, which\n\nare necessary to ensure the effective distribution of network programming to a\n\nnationwide audience.\n\nBecause an extended conversion to digital television broadcasting has begun\n\ncurrent and future technological developments may affect competition within\n\nthe television marketplace. Technological developments that compress digital\n\nsignals will increasingly permit the same broadcast, cable, or satellite\n\nchannel to carry multiple video and data services which could result in an\n\nexpanded field of competing services. Television broadcasters will continue to\n\noperate their current stations while gradually building and operating digital\n\nfacilities concurrently on separate channels.\n\nAs a producer and distributor of programming, the Company competes with\n\nstudios, television networks and independent producers and syndicators to sell\n\nprogramming both domestically and overseas.\n\nInfinity\n\nThe Company's radio stations and outdoor advertising properties compete for\n\naudience, advertising revenues and programming directly with other radio\n\nstations and outdoor advertising companies, as well as with other media, such\n\nas broadcast television, newspapers, magazines, cable television, the Internet\n\nand direct mail, within their respective markets.\n\nThe radio and outdoor advertising industry is also subject to competition\n\nfrom new media technologies that are being developed or introduced, such as\n\nthe delivery of audio programming by cable television systems, by satellite\n\nand by terrestrial delivery of digital audio broadcasting. The FCC has\n\nauthorized spectrum for the use of a new technology, satellite digital audio\n\nradio services, to deliver audio programming. Satellite digital audio radio\n\nservice will provide a medium for the delivery by satellite of multiple new\n\naudio programming formats to local and national audiences. The FCC also has a\n\npending proceeding which contemplates the use of digital technology by\n\nexisting terrestrial radio broadcast stations either on existing or alternate\n\nbroadcasting frequencies. The FCC recently authorized a new \"low power\" radio\n\nor \"microbroadcasting\" service with the intent of creating opportunities for\n\nlow cost neighborhood service on frequencies which would not interfere with\n\nexisting stations.\n\nEntertainment\n\nTheatrical Motion Pictures. The Company competes with other major studios\n\nand independent film producers in the production and distribution of motion\n\npictures, videocassettes, discs and DVDs. PARAMOUNT PICTURES' competitive\n\nposition primarily depends on the quality of the product produced, its\n\ndistribution and marketing success, and public response. The Company also\n\ncompetes to obtain creative talent and story properties which are essential to\n\nthe success of all of the Company's entertainment businesses.\n\nParks. During the last two years, the regional theme park industry has\n\nexperienced increased consolidation. The Company must now compete in a\n\nbusiness environment that is dominated by highly-capitalized, multi-park\n\nentertainment corporations. In order to compete effectively, regional theme\n\npark operators must differentiate their product by having access to the latest\n\nentertainment intellectual property and brands and must reinvest capital to\n\nmaintain a fresh experience for their repeat-visitor base. The Company\n\nbelieves that its intellectual properties enhance existing attractions and\n\nfacilitate the development of new attractions, which encourage visitors to the\n\nPARAMOUNT PARKS theme parks and STAR TREK: THE EXPERIENCE at the Las Vegas\n\nHilton. The Company's theme parks also compete with other forms of leisure\n\nentertainment.\n\nI-22\n\nVideo\n\nBLOCKBUSTER operates in a highly competitive environment. The Company\n\nbelieves that BLOCKBUSTER's most significant competition comes from (i) video\n\nstores and other retailers that rent or sell movies and (ii) providers of\n\ndirect delivery home viewing entertainment.\n\nVideo stores and other retailers that rent or sell movies include, among\n\nothers, (i) local, regional and national video stores; (ii) mass merchant\n\nretailers; (iii) supermarkets, pharmacies and convenience stores; and (iv)\n\nonline retailers and mail order services. The Company believes that the\n\nprincipal factors that BLOCKBUSTER faces in competing with video stores and\n\nother retailers are (a) convenience and visibility of store locations; (b)\n\nquality, quantity and variety of titles; (c) pricing; and (d) customer\n\nservice.\n\nWith the development of new technologies, a significant competitive risk to\n\nBLOCKBUSTER's video store business comes from direct broadcast satellite,\n\ndigital cable television and high-speed Internet access. In response to this\n\ncompetition in 2000, BLOCKBUSTER entered the direct broadcast satellite market\n\nthrough its alliance with DIRECTV (see \"Viacom Segments--Video\"). Direct\n\nbroadcast satellite, digital cable and \"traditional\" cable providers not only\n\noffer numerous channels of conventional television, but they also offer pay-\n\nper-view movies which permit a subscriber to pay a fee to see a selected\n\nmovie. Because of the increased availability of channels, direct broadcast\n\nsatellite and digital cable providers have been able to enhance their pay-per-\n\nview business by (i) substantially increasing the number and variety of movies\n\nthey can offer their subscribers on a pay-per-view basis; and (ii) providing\n\nmore frequent and convenient start times for the most popular movies. Pay-per-\n\nview allows the consumer to avoid trips to the video store for rentals and\n\nreturns of movies, which also eliminates the chance they will incur additional\n\ncosts for keeping a movie beyond its initial rental term. However, newly\n\nreleased movies are currently made available by the studios for rental prior\n\nto being made available for pay-per-view. Pay-per-view also does not allow the\n\nconsumer to start, stop and rewind the movie or fully control start times. As\n\na result, some digital cable providers and a limited number of Internet\n\ncontent providers have begun implementing technology referred to as \"video-on-\n\ndemand,\" which technology transmits movies on demand with interactive\n\ncapabilities such as start, stop and rewind. BLOCKBUSTER also began testing a\n\nvideo-on-demand service in 2000 with its initial movies-on-demand trials. In\n\naddition to competing with the video retail industry, video-on-demand competes\n\nwith other uses of cable and telephony infrastructure, such as the ability to\n\nprovide Internet access and basic telephone services, some of which may\n\nprovide higher returns for operators. In addition, video-on-demand providers,\n\nincluding BLOCKBUSTER, may face competition from the studios, which are\n\nconsidering implementing their own video-on-demand service.\n\nPublishing\n\nThe consumer publishing business is highly competitive and has been\n\naffected by consolidation trends. Recent years have brought a number of\n\nsignificant mergers among the leading consumer publishers. The book superstore\n\nhas emerged as a significant factor in the industry contributing to the\n\ngeneral trend toward consolidation in the retail channel. There have also been\n\na number of mergers completed in the distribution channel.\n\nThe Company must compete with other publishers for the rights to works by\n\nwell-known authors and public personalities.\n\nOnline\n\nThe online industry is highly competitive and is rapidly evolving and\n\nfacing changing market conditions, including consolidation, alterations in\n\nonline advertising spending, slower growth in e-commerce and greater\n\ndifficulties in accessing public and private financing. Competition among\n\nmedia and Internet companies pursuing online consumers is particularly\n\nintense. The Company's online businesses compete for online consumers,\n\nadvertisers and content providers with leading news/information/entertainment\n\nonline sites, online portal services and broadcasters, traditional media,\n\nretail and record companies and their respective Internet properties, and\n\nI-23\n\nonline commerce companies. Rivalry for online consumers' attention and leisure\n\ntime, and associated advertising dollars and e-commerce expenditures by online\n\nconsumers, will continue to increase for all industry participants.\n\nWeb sites maintained by existing and potential competitors may be perceived\n\nby online consumers, advertisers and content and other online vendors to be\n\nsuperior to the Company's Web sites. In addition, with respect to MTVi's Web\n\nsites, the major record companies, which control the vast majority of recorded\n\nmusic, have started to engage in strategic arrangements, including business\n\ncombinations, with Internet and Internet-related businesses for the online\n\ndistribution and other commercialization of their music libraries and artist\n\nrelationships. As a result of these actions, the Company's online businesses\n\nmay not be able to maintain or increase online traffic levels on its Web\n\nsites, which may negatively affect their advertising and e-commerce revenues.\n\nRegulation\n\nThe Company's businesses are either subject to or affected by regulations\n\nof federal, state and local governmental authorities. The rules, regulations,\n\npolicies and procedures affecting these businesses are constantly subject to\n\nchange. The descriptions which follow are summaries and should be read in\n\nconjunction with the texts of the statutes, rules and regulations described\n\nherein. The descriptions do not purport to describe all present and proposed\n\nstatutes, rules and regulations affecting the Company's businesses.\n\nIntellectual Property\n\nDomestic and international laws affecting intellectual property are of\n\nsignificant importance to the Company.\n\nWIPO Copyright Treaties. In 1996, delegates to the World Intellectual\n\nProperty Organization (\"WIPO\") adopted a proposed Copyright Treaty which will\n\ntake effect if ratified by 30 nations. As of December 2000, 22 countries,\n\nincluding the U.S., had ratified the Copyright Treaty.\n\nThe proposed Copyright Treaty updates the Berne Convention, last revised in\n\n1971, and addresses copyright protection for new technologies that have\n\nemerged since that time. It is not possible to predict whether the Copyright\n\nTreaty will take effect or how countries would implement the Treaty after\n\nratification. Because the Treaty includes important copyright protections for\n\nthe digital transmission of content, if ratified, the Treaty likely would have\n\na positive impact on the Company.\n\nThe U.S. implementing legislation, known as the Digital Millennium\n\nCopyright Act (\"DMCA\"), which is effective whether or not WIPO is ultimately\n\nratified, affords important new copyright protections, including civil and\n\ncriminal penalties for the manufacture of, or trafficking in, devices that\n\ncircumvent copyright protection technologies such as encryption and\n\nscrambling, and for the act of circumventing such technologies to gain\n\nunauthorized access to a copyrighted work. The DMCA also amends the Copyright\n\nAct by creating a new statutory license concerning certain rights related to\n\ndigital transmissions of sound recordings. The statute provides that new\n\nstatutory rates for each license will be set either through voluntary\n\nnegotiations between the interested parties or through Copyright Arbitration\n\nRoyalty Proceedings.\n\nCopyright Term Extension. In October 1998, Congress passed legislation\n\nextending the copyright term an additional twenty years. The extended term is\n\nlife of the author plus 70 years for authored works and 95 years for works-\n\nmade-for-hire. This extension puts the U.S. copyright term on par with the\n\nEuropean Community. Term extension should have a beneficial effect for the\n\nCompany over time, including with respect to important publishing properties\n\nwhich otherwise would have passed into the public domain in the next several\n\nyears.\n\nCompulsory Copyright License.\n\nMultichannel Distributors Other Than DTH. The Copyright Act provides a\n\n----------------------------------------\n\ncompulsory license for the retransmission of broadcast signals by\n\nmultichannel video distributors such as cable television, MMDS (Multipoint\n\nMultichannel Distribution Systems) and SMATV (Satellite Master Antenna\n\nTelevision)\n\nI-24\n\noperators. The compulsory license rate paid to programmers for the\n\nretransmission of distant broadcast signals by cable, MMDS and SMATV\n\noperators is established by statute. There is no licensing fee for the\n\nretransmission of local broadcast signals.\n\nDTH. In November 1999, Congress enacted legislation to extend and reform\n\n---\n\nthe Satellite Home Viewer Act (SHVA). The original SHVA legislation created\n\na temporary compulsory license that allowed satellite carriers to import\n\ndistant broadcast signals to those homes that were unable to receive their\n\nlocal broadcast signals. This distant signal compulsory license was set to\n\nexpire at the end of 1999. Through the SHVA legislation, Congress extended\n\nthe distant signal compulsory license until December 31, 2004, and set a\n\nstatutory compulsory license fee for these distant signals of $0.189 per\n\nsubscriber for superstations and $0.1485 per subscriber for networks. Up to\n\nthis point, the DTH compulsory license fee was set through negotiations and\n\nbinding arbitration. In addition, Congress created a new and permanent\n\ncompulsory license for the retransmission of local broadcast signals back\n\ninto the local market, the so-called \"local-into-local\" provision. Unlike\n\nthe distant signal compulsory license, the local signal compulsory license\n\nis royalty-free.\n\nFirst "
