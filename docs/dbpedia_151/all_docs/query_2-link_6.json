        "text": "I don't know if there's a topic concerning the network affiliation switches of the mid-1990s...here goes...\n\nWhen Fox acquired the NFL from CBS in late 1993, the deal sparked a number of affilate switches in between 1994 and 1996. According to Wikipedia:\n\nExisting New World stations\n\nKNSD, San Diego, affiliated with NBC (didn't affiliated with Fox since the network had a VHF station in that market, XETV)\n\nWAGA, Atlanta, affiliated with CBS (CBS in now with WGCL; former Fox O&O WATL became WB in 1995 then MyNTV in 2006)\n\nWJBK, Detroit, affiliated with CBS (CBS is now with WWJ)\n\nWITI, Milwaukee, affiliated with CBS (CBS is now with WDJT)\n\nWJW, Cleveland, affiliated with CBS (CBS is now with former Fox affiliate WOIO)\n\nWTVT, Tampa/St. Petersburg, affiliated with CBS (WFTS switched from Fox to ABC and WTSP switched from ABC to CBS)\n\nWSBK, Boston, independent station (remained independent when Fox bought WFXT; UPN from 1995-2006)\n\nStations that were acquired from Argyle Television\n\nKDFW, Dallas/Fort Worth, affiliated with CBS (CBS is now with KTVT; The former Fox O&O, KDAF, became a WB affiliate, and is now affiliated with The CW)\n\nKTBC, Austin, affiliated with CBS (CBS is now on former Fox affiliate KEYE)\n\nKTVI, St. Louis, affiliated with ABC (ABC is now on former Fox affilate KDNL)\n\nWVTM, Birmingham, affiliated with NBC (remained with NBC since Fox bought WBRC in 1996)\n\nStations that were acquired from Citicasters\n\nKSAZ, Phoenix, affiliated with CBS (CBS is with KPHO)\n\nWBRC, Birmingham, affiliated with ABC (ABC affiliation is with a signal created from the signals of former CBS affilates WJSU and WCFT; WTTO turned down the ABC affiliation, eventually took the WB (1996-2006) and latter the CW (since 2006); WNAL/WPXH changed from Fox to CBS to Pax/i/ion)\n\nWDAF, Kansas City, affiliated with NBC (NBC is now on former Fox affiliate KSHB)\n\nWGHP, Greensboro/Winston-Salem/High Point, affiliated with ABC (ABC is now on former Fox affiliate WXLV)\n\nBurnham Broadcasting\n\nJust weeks after completing the New World deal, Fox announced another purchase, this one of Burnham Broadcasting. The stations involved were:\n\nWVUE, New Orleans, affiliated with ABC (WNOL, which had been the market's Fox affiliate, took the WB affiliation (1996-2006, now with the CW); the ABC affiliation went to WGNO.)\n\nWLUK, Green Bay, affiliated with NBC (NBC is now on former Fox affiliate WGBA)\n\nWALA, Mobile, affiliated with NBC (NBC is on former Fox affiliate WPMI)\n\nKHON, Honolulu, affiliated with NBC (NBC is on former Fox affiliate KHNL)\n\nohstuskaterpunk said:\n\nI don't know if there's a topic concerning the network affiliation switches of the mid-1990s...here goes...\n\nThis topic has been discussed until the skin is peeling from the hot sun. But there are new developments involving some of those stations that have occured over the past few months.\n\nIn Dallas, Birmingham, and San Diego, the NBC stations (KXAS, WTVM, and KNSD respectively) were sold to NBC. LIN TV purchased part ownership in KXAS and KNSD, although they operate as NBC O&O's. WTVM has since been sold to Media General (which sold WIAT/42 to make room).\n\nCBS purchased what would become WWJ-TV/62 Detroit and WUPA/69 Atlanta as a result. CBS get a reprieve when now WGCL/46 agreed to affiliate. WUPA was sold to Paramount as a UPN O&O, which would later become part of CBS after the CBS/Viacom merger and later split. (WUPA is a CBS O&O once again under the CW). No such luck in Detroit, where every attempt at a newscast has failed.\n\nWSBK/38 Boston was sold to Paramount as a UPN O&O, and like WUPA became a CBS O&O (only as an indie).\n\nXETV/6 San Diego is losing Fox as of September, where it will go to Tribune's KSWB/69. The issue is political, in that XETV is a Mexican station.\n\nOf the stations mentioned, WBRC, WGHP, WJW, WDAF, KTVI, and WITI are in the process of being sold to Local TV.\n\nBurnham Broadcasting\n\nJust weeks after completing the New World deal, Fox announced another purchase, this one of Burnham Broadcasting. The stations involved were:\n\nWVUE, New Orleans, affiliated with ABC (WNOL, which had been the market's Fox affiliate, took the WB affiliation (1996-2006, now with the CW); the ABC affiliation went to WGNO.)\n\nWLUK, Green Bay, affiliated with NBC (NBC is now on former Fox affiliate WGBA)\n\nWALA, Mobile, affiliated with NBC (NBC is on former Fox affiliate WPMI)\n\nKHON, Honolulu, affiliated with NBC (NBC is on former Fox affiliate KHNL)\n\nFox never took ownership of these stations. They arranged for a third party to do so. Emmis bought (and sold) these stations. WVUE has been sold to local ownership (the owner of the New Orleans Saints).\n\nAll of that big push to put FOX on major VHF stations! Funny how with digital TV, most stations are gonna be on the UHF band from channels 14 to 51!\n\nWhen it all shakes out, it may not be quite as worthless as it might first appear... Looking at the list of stations ohstuskaterpunk posted, of those that stayed with Fox, their permanent DTV channels:\n\nWAGA, Atlanta: 27\n\nWJBK, Detroit: 7\n\nWITI, Milwaukee: 33\n\nWJW, Cleveland: 8\n\nWTVT, Tampa/St. Petersburg: 12\n\nKDFW, Dallas/Fort Worth: 35\n\nKTBC, Austin: 7\n\nKTVI, St. Louis: 43\n\nKSAZ, Phoenix: 10\n\nWBRC, Birmingham: 50\n\nWDAF, Kansas City: 34\n\nWGHP, Greensboro/Winston-Salem/High Point: 8\n\nWVUE, New Orleans: 8\n\nWLUK, Green Bay: 11\n\nWALA, Mobile: 9\n\nKHON, Honolulu 8\n\nTen out of 16 stations will be on VHF for their permanent DTV facilities.\n\nBut IMHO what Fox really bought was not the technical facilities - it was the traditions. People were simply used to watching channel 6 (WITI) in Milwaukee - many of them didn't even know Fox 24 existed. Likewise in the other markets.\n\nThe VHF/UHF difference for DTV is invisible to viewers. As far as they can tell, every station on the above list is VHF - they will tune a channel between 2 and 13 to receive any of them - whether they're watching on cable, satellite, or OTA DTV.\n\nIn the DTV world the VHF advantage goes only to the lower utility bills. (which however is not a negligible advantage!)\n\nbpatrick said:\n\nAnd how about the three ABC affiliates in Indiana\n\nthat went to Fox: WTVW/7 Evansville, WSJV/28\n\nSouth Bend, and WBAK/38 Terre Haute?\n\nCan't speak for any of the other two, but for WTVW (I grew up in the southern Illinois portion of the Evansville market) I know that they had been owned through the 80s into the mid-90s by Banam Broadcasting, the television arm of the (old, pre-NationsBank merger) BankAmerica, hence the name of the company: BAN(k)AM(erica). Banam also owned the Monroe, Louisiana ABC affiliate KARD-14, the Fox affiliate in Springfield, Missouri, KDEB (now KSFX) and KLBK, the CBS affiliate in Lubbock, Texas.\n\nIn May 1995, Banam announced the intention to sell their television group to Petracom Broadcasting of Tampa. However, the company did not have enough money for the deal and approached NewsCorp about injecting some cash with the promise that WTVW and KARD would affiliate with Fox (KDEB was an existing Fox affiliate and I am unsure why KLBK did not affiliate with Fox). Newscorp agreed to inject about $10 Million into the transaction. All of these stations are currently owned by Nexstar Broadcasting Corp, which acquired them from Quorum Broadcasting in 2003 or 2004. When Newscorp's financial interest in the stations ended I do not know.\n\nIn December 1995, WTVW flipped to Fox from ABC, WEHT flipped to ABC from CBS and WEVV flipped from Fox to CBS.\n\nCharles1 said:\n\nbpatrick said:\n\nABC also lost...WLOV/27\n\nColumbus-Tupelo, MS, to Fox.\n\nAnd this left Columbus and Tupelo to depend on WCFT-33/WJSU-40 Tuscaloosa/Anniston/Birmingham, WPTY-24 Memphis, and WBBJ-7 in Jackson, Tennessee as the de facto ABC affiliates for the market until WKDH-45 signed on in 2001. Even today, 33/40 highlights many eastern Mississippi counties during its severe weather coverage.\n\nAdd WAPT-16-Jackson, MS which is still carried on the Starkville, MS cable system. Though to be honest I think I'd much rather watch ABC 33/40 out of Birmingham than WAPT from Jackson.\n\nABC 33/40 in Birmingham, to me, is one of the most interesting outcomes of the Fox station raids of the mid-90s. The station, a conglomeration (as mentioned) of signals from Tuscaloosa, Anniston and an LP repeater in Birmingham would seemingly have had an incredibly tough climb in building a viewer base. Most of the stations that picked up the leftovers after the Fox raids did (and still do, just look at Atlanta, Milwaukee or Dallas among others).\n\nWhether it was smart hires early on (meteorologist James Spann among others), smart programming decisions (the promise to provide wall-to-wall coverage during tornadic severe weather) or Albritton's money flow the station has overcome the odds and consistently ranks #1 in the market.\n\nSince this topic has been brought up many times why start a new thread? Anyhow one issue not mentioned was the fact that most New World stations did not include Fox Kids programs as part of the deal. What the original deal specified was that in markets that New WOrld was switching their stations to Fox, the Fox stations losing affiliation would have the rights of first refusal and would be allowed to keep Fox Kids. But in most markets the former Fox stations would be taking networks. Phoenix, St Louis, and Tampa former Fox affiliates got ABC. Cleveland and Austin former Fox affiliates got CBS. Kansas City got NBC. So those stations had no interest in taking Fox Kids. Former Fox stations in Detroit, Dallas, Atlanta, and Milwaukee were left independent stations taking UPN in Detroit and Millwaukee and WB in the rest. Those stations simply kept Fox Kids.\n\nIn situations where the former Fox affiliate took big 3 networks and would have no room for Fox Kids, the New World station would have to run Fox Kids by default unless they found another station to take it. In every New World Market, an independent to run Fox Kids was initially found.\n\nNow in situations like SF Broadcasting getting Fox for New Orleans, Hawaii, Mobile, and Green Bay, Fox Kids was included in the deal and thos stations took Fox Kids though they were News based outlets as well. WHBQ Memphis, WBRC Birmingham and WGHP Greensboro were becoming O & O stations and they too were to take Fox Kids. WGHP switched to Fox September 95 and they took Fox Kids an hour early weekdays. WBRC was slated to take Fox Kids in the Fall of 96 when they would be evicting ABC. But in 1996 the police changed to allow Fox O & O stations also to not have to take Fox Kids if they could find an outlet to run it.\n\nIn Greensboro when a Christian station became a WB affiliate and a commercial independent in 1996, WGHP opted to assign the rights to Fox Kids to that station in the Fall and they became the first O & O to drop Fox Kids. In Brimingham, WTTO which was losing Fox and becoming an independent wanted to keep Fox Kids, so WBRC decided to not take Fox Kids afterall. Also with advertising regulations making it difficult to make money with cartoons, Fox reevaluated its policy on Fox Kids.\n\nStill in St Louis, where Fox Kids could not fit on the former affiliate becoming an ABC station, that programming moved to a Christian Independent in 1995. So KTVI did not have to take it. Then in the Fall of 1996 when KNLC droped Fox Kids, KTVI was forced to take it and was the only New World station to take Fox Kids. So there were 2 O & O stations without it and only one New World station with it.\n\nIn 1997, New World stations were acquired by Fox and the New World Policy continued on for the newly acquired Fox affiliates. By 1998, Fox Kids began losing money and in 2000 Fox Affiliates were now allowed to drop Fox Kids without finding an outlet. Fox scaled back its 3 hour block to 2 hours. In 2001, WTTO dropped Fox Kids and WBRC did not pick it up. Later that year it was dropped by WB 20 in Greensboro and WGHP did not pick that back up. Then at the end of 2001, Fox Kids ended weekday programming. Still most New WOrld stations refused to even clear the weekend Fox 4 Kids TV programs. In a few markets 4 Kids TV never aired as a reesult.\n\nIn all other situations Big 3 stations switching to Fox all took Fox Kids until the block ended in 2001 weekdays and until 2008 when it ended weekends.\n\nA"
