        "text": "CBS Stations said it has hired 28 news staff to support the debut of the new evening newscasts on its independent and CW-affiliated stations this week.\n\nThe station group said the new hires include multi-skilled community journalists, anchors, weathercasters, producers, directors, editors, managers, a graphic designer and a multi-platform content coordinator.\n\nEarlier this year, CBS Stations announced that its Local News Innovation Lab would be supporting the production of what it called “hybrid, local-to-national newscasts” for stations in New York (WLNY), Philadelphia (WPSG), Dallas-Fort Worth (KTXA), San Francisco (KBCW), Atlanta (WUPA), Boston (WSBK), Seattle (KSTW), Tampa (WTOG), Detroit (WKBD) and Miami (WBFS).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe launch of Seattle Now News at 10 on CW11, marked the first time that CBS Stations is producing newscasts for all 17 of its markets.\n\nThe one-hour newscasts air seven nights a week at either 9 or 10 p.m.—depending on the market—and originate from the lab at KTVT and KTXA in Dallas-Fort Worth.\n\nThe weekday editions of the newscasts are being anchored by Tom Hanson, who is joined by meteorologist Collin Myers. Weekend newscasts will be anchored by Trason Bragg, who will be joined by meteorologist Brittany Rainey.\n\nThe New York, Philadelphia, Dallas-Fort Worth, San Francisco, Boston and Miami newscasts are also available on CBS News and Stations’ local streaming channels in their respective markets.\n\n“This is an exciting time for our group, as we marshal our team at the CBS Local News Innovation Lab—and newly hired colleagues across the country—to create this ambitious model for producing newscasts that deliver a mix of hyper-local and national stories,” said Tom Canedo, CBS stations president. “Congratulations to Andrea, our team members at the lab and everyone in our local markets who is helping us bring our vision to life.”\n\n“It is an honor to be part of creating something that’s so unique and designed to provide the kind of local-to-national and even global storytelling that defines CBS News and Stations,” said vice president, CW and independent stations news director Andrea Parquet-Taylor. “We are pleased to have assembled an outstanding team of seasoned professionals, including my talented co-pilot (assistant news director) Josh Barlow, to serve as the backbone of this exciting venture.”\n\nWeekday anchor Tom Hanson joined the CBS Local News Innovation Lab team after working as a New York-based freelance anchor and reporter for CBS News since 2018.\n\nWeekday meteorologist Collin Myers moved to Dallas-Fort Worth from Houston, where he was a meteorologist at KRIV and at KTRK before that.\n\nWeekend anchor Trason Bragg joined the CBS Local News Innovation Lab, after having been an anchor and reporter for WGCL, the CBS affiliate in Atlanta.\n\nWeekend meteorologist Brittany Rainey has been with KTVT as a weekday morning meteorologist since Sept. 2021."
