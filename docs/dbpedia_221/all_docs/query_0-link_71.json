        "text": "Vegetation pattern and microtopography were examined on a mountain slope with a rotational type landslide scar on Mt Kiyosumi, central Japan. Similarities of distribution patterns among 55 woody species were calculated using Cole's species association coefficient, and based on them, seven vegetation units were classified using cluster analysis and principal coordinates analysis. The seven vegetation units coincide with seven microtopographical facets at 101 to 102 m2 order. Furthermore, these vegetation units were grouped into three higher categories by reciprocal averaging and principal coordinates analysis. They were ridge slopes, surrounding slopes and landslide slopes. The three categories were arranged in the above-mentioned order based on similarity in floristic composition. In the ridge slopes, late-successional trees and deciduous trees had high relative basal areas. In the surrounding slopes,Euptelea polyandra and other deciduous trees had high relative basal areas. In the landslide slopes,E. polyandra and deciduous shrubs had high relative basal areas. The density and the age distributions ofE. polyandra, a typical pioneer tree which invades disturbed sites, suggested that the severity of soil surface disturbances increase in this order. The disturbance regime explains the vegetation pattern on the study site, where the rotational type landslide had occurred.\n\nThe relationship between tree distribution and topography was examined in a small river basin (3.4 ha) comprising a complex mosaic of topographical units at 102 to 103 m2 order, each of which had a shallow valley bordered by small ridges or breaks of slopes. Twenty-five major woody species were divided into two groups (groups A and B) based on a cluster analysis using the distribution data in the basin. Group A, which mainly consisted of early-successional species, was distributed around the valley sites of the topographical units, while group B, which mainly consisted of late-successional species, was distributed around the ridge sites of the topographical units. This vegetation pattern coincided with erosional condition in the basin. That is, the valley sites were eroded more actively than the ridge sites, as soil depth tended to be thin in the valley sites and thick in the ridge sites, and because large (canopy) trees were restricted in the ridge sites. There was no tendency that group B was replacing group A, and hence it was suggested that repeated disturbance by slope failures or small-scale shallow landslides have prevented compositional change from the early-successional (group A) to the late-successional (group B) species by preventing the invasion of the latter into valley sites.\n\nEffects of climatic factors on the forest plant distribution were examined in Hokkaido Island, northern Japan, where boreal and temperate plants frequently co-occur, and the relationship of floral make-up with phytogeography and life form was analysed. From the climatic preference of tree species consisting of mixed forest, the co-occurrence of boreal and temperate plants was found over a wider thermal range in regions of little rainfall. However, co-occurrence in a certain forest site was more notable in the understory than in the crown. A particular case of this involves southern evergreen shrubs and herbs in a boreal coniferous forest. Another is the presence of northern summergreen herbs in a temperate hardwood forest. It is speculated that the co-occurrence dates back at least to the late Quaternary, when a decrease in temperature associated with the glacial period forced understory plants to adapt their life form or leaf habit to snowcover and the light conditions of interior forests. Recent geographical evidence suggests that the island has been isolated from the southern island for at least 70000 years. Thus, the postglacial re-expansion of southern species does not appear to be due to immigration but rather due to their expansion from refuges on the island such as Oshima Peninsula for snow-tolerant species and Hidaka District for snow-intolerant species.\n\nDaxingan Mountains are located in cold temperature region of northeast China, and are oriented from northeast to southwest direction. This area of China encompasses the southernmost distribution of continuous permafrost that extends from the Arctic region of Eurasia (see Fig. 1.1). The vegetation type is classified as deciduous conifer forest dominated by Larix gmelinii (Rupr.) Rupr. The major species accompanying L. gmelinii are Betula platyphylla Suk. and Populus davidiana Dode. These forests are extension of the larch forests of Central and Northeastern Siberia (Fukuda 1996; Kasischke and Stocks 2000). The climate in the region of Daxingan Mountains is more moderate than that of Northeastern Siberia. Therefore, the forest biomass and productivity are also higher than those of the Siberian counterpart. The climate differs among southern, middle, and northern regions within the Daxingan Mountains. It leads to regional-scale growth differences in the larch forests. For example, biomass and net primary productivity of L. gmelinii forests of ca. 30-year old in the southern region are 43.6 Mg ha−1 and 3.94 Mg ha−1 year−1 higher than those in the northern region (Zhou 1991; Shi 1999). The biomass and net primary productivity of L. gmelinii forests of ca. 50-year old in the middle region are 6 Mg ha−1 and 1.24 Mg ha−1 year−1 higher than those of the northern region.\n\nThis study was conducted in a secondary broad-leaved forest in northern Hokkaido, Japan, which burned on 20–21 April 1998. The study plot, set up on 13 July 1998, contained Quercus mongolica var. grosseserrata and Betula platyphylla var. japonica trees. The latter were more severely damaged by the fire. Size-dependent survivorship was observed in both species with larger trees being more likely to survive the fire. However, many largeBetula trees were completely destroyed. Both species developed abundant root collar sprouts immediately after the fire. The number of sprouts ranged from 0 to 296 in Betula and from 0 to 34 in Quercus. Trees with no sprouts were not necessarily dead. The frequency distribution of the sprouting pattern in Betula was bimodal. This was related to damage severity, with the most abundant sprouting manifest in the most severely damaged trees. This pattern was not observed inQuercus . Stem diameter also appeared to influence the extent of sprouting in Betula, while in Quercus there was no distinct correlation between basal area and the number of sprouts. In Betula, the relationship between the number of sprouts and the damage severity suggests a trade-off in resource allocation for sprouting vs. shoot flushing in the crown.
