        "text": "Israeli forces unleashed a wave of air strikes on the Gaza Strip over the course of three horrific days. During the attack, 45 people were killed, including 16 children, and at least 360 others were wounded.\n\nWithout providing evidence, the Israeli army has claimed that some civilian casualties were killed by misfired rockets.\n\nThe first strike launched Friday, August 5, followed by another targeted strike on Saturday.\n\nThe second strike targeted a prominent commander in southern Gaza, Khaled Mansour, who was killed when a missile struck his apartment building in the Rafah refugee camp.\n\nWissam Jouda, a civilian next door to the building, recounted the attack saying, “Suddenly, without warning, the house next to us was bombed, and everything became black and dusty with smoke in the blink of an eye.”\n\nThe recent attack is the worst since last year, when an 11-day war was waged, destroying buildings and taking more than 250 lives along the Gaza strip.\n\nGaza resident Hamed al-Hindi, 33, said, “I don’t know how long this escalation will take and how bad it will be. We couldn’t sleep last night, the sounds of explosions didn’t stop. I brought my three children to my room to keep them calm.”\n\nOn Sunday, at 11:30 p.m., an Egyptian-brokered ceasefire took effect, and rockets rained down in the minutes leading to the truce.\n\nOne of the sixteen children killed during the three-day massacre was Khalil Abu Hamada. Khalil had been eating dinner with his mother and then decided to go outside to join a friend. His mother, Najwa Abu Hamadeh, 48, didn’t know that she had just had dinner with her son for the last time.\n\nMoments after Kahlil stepped out, according to Hamadeh, “there was a strong bombardment” that shook her home and left the streets covered in dust and debris. When the smoke cleared, Hamadeh’s only son was gone.\n\nIt took five rounds of in vitro fertilization treatments for Hamadeh to conceive her only child, and it took only one missile to take her son’s life, who was found lying covered in blood next to his best friend.\n\nIn the aftermath of the tragedy, Najwa continues to refer to her son in the present tense saying, “He is my only son.”\n\nWhile many people in Gaza mourned the lives lost, others celebrated the end of their three-day suffering on Sunday night, but heavy gunfire broke out again on Tuesday, killing three and leaving dozens more injured. One thing is certain: With innocent men, women, and children being killed by Israeli forces every day without hesitation or compassion, it will take more than a ceasefire before peace can truly prevail between them.\n\nHere are the names of the children that died during the strikes over the weekend:"
