XXIII, C.P.C. in the execution proceedings had no bearing on power of Banking Court in execution of a decree---Irrespective of fact that certain provisions of C.P.C. were mentioned in execution application of decree-holder Bank, Banking Court under S.19(1) of the Ordinance had power to allow decree-holder to withdraw earlier application and file a fresh one---Power of Banking Court in terms of S.19(1) of Financial Institutions (Recovery of Finances) Ordinance, 2001 was protected by section 4 of the Ordinance whereby provisions of the Financial Institutions (Recovery of Finances) Ordinance, 2001 had an overriding effect on provisions of C.P.C.---Application under S.12(2), C.P.C. was dismissed, in circumstances. (b) Interpretation of Statutes--- ----All provisions of a statute were to be read together and any particular provision of a statute was not to be considered in isolation unless and until there was a clear-cut conflict, which was irreconcilable.
