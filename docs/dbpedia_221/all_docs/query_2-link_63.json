        "text": "Sunday, February 3, 2019 - Rome to Abu Dhabi\n\n1pm: departure by plane from Rome / Fiumicino to Abu Dhabi\n\n10pm: arrival at Abu Dhabi Presidential Airport\n\nMonday, February 4\n\n12pm: welcome ceremony at the main entrance of the Presidential Palace\n\n12.20pm: visit Abu Dhabi Crown Prince at Presidential Palace\n\n5pm: private meeting with Muslim Council of Elders at Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque\n\n6.10pm: Inter-religious in the Founder's Memorial\n\nTuesday, February 5 - Abu Dhabi to Rome\n\n9.15am: private visit to undisclosed cathedral\n\n10.30am: public mass at Zayed Sports City – with a homily by Pope Francis\n\n12.40pm: farewell at Abu Dhabi Presidential Airport\n\n1pm: departure by plane to Rome\n\n5pm: arrival at the Rome / Ciampino International Airport\n\nThe idea of pound parity now seems less far-fetched as the risk grows that Britain may split away from the European Union without a deal.\n\nRupert Harrison, a fund manager at BlackRock, sees the risk of it falling to trade level with the dollar on a no-deal Brexit. The view echoes Morgan Stanley’s recent forecast that the currency can plunge toward $1 (Dh3.67) on such an outcome. That isn’t the majority view yet – a Bloomberg survey this month estimated the pound will slide to $1.10 should the UK exit the bloc without an agreement.\n\nNew Prime Minister Boris Johnson has repeatedly said that Britain will leave the EU on the October 31 deadline with or without an agreement, fuelling concern the nation is headed for a disorderly departure and fanning pessimism toward the pound. Sterling has fallen more than 7 per cent in the past three months, the worst performance among major developed-market currencies.\n\n“The pound is at a much lower level now but I still think a no-deal exit would lead to significant volatility and we could be testing parity on a really bad outcome,” said Mr Harrison, who manages more than $10 billion in assets at BlackRock. “We will see this game of chicken continue through August and that’s likely negative for sterling,” he said about the deadlocked Brexit talks.\n\nThe pound fell 0.8 per cent to $1.2033 on Friday, its weakest closing level since the 1980s, after a report on the second quarter showed the UK economy shrank for the first time in six years. The data means it is likely the Bank of England will cut interest rates, according to Mizuho Bank.\n\nThe BOE said in November that the currency could fall even below $1 in an analysis on possible worst-case Brexit scenarios. Options-based calculations showed around a 6.4 per cent chance of pound-dollar parity in the next one year, markedly higher than 0.2 per cent in early March when prospects of a no-deal outcome were seemingly off the table.\n\nBloomberg\n\nAraminta Robertson, of the Financially Mint blog, shares her financial advice for university leavers:\n\n1. Build digital or technical skills: After graduation, people can find it extremely hard to find jobs. From programming to digital marketing, your early twenties are for building skills. Future employers will want people with tech skills.\n\n2. Side hustle: At 16, I lived in a village and started teaching online, as well as doing work as a virtual assistant and marketer. There are six skills you can use online: translation; teaching; programming; digital marketing; design and writing. If you master two, you’ll always be able to make money.\n\n3. Networking: Knowing how to make connections is extremely useful. Use LinkedIn to find people who have the job you want, connect and ask to meet for coffee. Ask how they did it and if they know anyone who can help you. I secured quite a few clients this way.\n\n4. Pay yourself first: The minute you receive any income, put about 15 per cent aside into a savings account you won’t touch, to go towards your emergency fund or to start investing. I do 20 per cent. It helped me start saving immediately."
