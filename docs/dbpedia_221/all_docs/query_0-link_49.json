        "text": "Discussion\n\nBreast cancer is the most common cancer in women worldwide [6]. Multiple factors, such as race and ethnicity, are effective in breast cancer survival. For instance, one study showed better survival in non- Hispanic whites compared to blacks and other groups. This difference is present in cases with the same stage, ER-PR status, and treatment [2, 7]. Tumor size and lymph node status are also directly related to the prognosis of breast cancer. In a study by Rosen et al., the mean recurrence time was 4.9 years in the cases with 1 involved lymph node and 3.9 years in those with 2 or more involved lymph nodes. Their study also revealed the importance of the menstruation status. In that study, the perimenopausal cases had higher mortality in comparison to pre and post-menopausal women [8]. All the cases of the current study, except for 1, were in the pre- menopausal status.\n\nSome authors suggested body weight as a negative prognostic factor which may influence the prognosis by interfering in the hormonal mechanism. Thus, after treatment completion, weight loss may improve the outcome [9].\n\nSome studies have shown that younger age at presentation is accompanied by a higher risk of recurrence; however, no difference has been reported in some other studies [6, 10]. On the other hand, Chen et al. performed a retrospective study and found that younger age was accompanied by better local control [11]. In this study, the patients were not so old and the importance of age in late relapse should be studied in prospective studies.\n\nThe patients with negative tumoral tissue for ER, PR, and HER2 (or triple negative) comprise 15-20% of the breast cancer cases and are among the worst outcome groups. This feature is associated with other high risk factors, such as young age and high grade [6].\n\nThe time of recurrence has been studied widely and most of the recurrences have been shown to occur in the first decade [12]. The recurrence time and pattern has been reported to have a double peak shaped curve; the first peak occurring in the second year and the other one in the 6th to the 9th year post-treatment. In node negative and early stage tumors, however, the curves were more flat. In other words, the recurrence rates were more constant and relatively similar in both premenopausal and postmenopausal women. Moreover, recurrence happens earlier in hormone receptor negative individuals. Nevertheless, after 8 years of treatment, the recurrence rate in hormone receptor negative cases is less than the hormone positive ones. It should be mentioned that chemotherapy lowers the recurrence rate and the second peak appears later [13].\n\nLate failure (more than 5 years) is more prevalent in early stage breast cancer. In a study on patients by quadrantectomy, the rate of late recurrence was 53% for T1 lesions and 25% for T2 lesions. This might be due to the better long-term survival in earlier stages [14].\n\nThere are some reports of prolonged disease-free survival in breast cancer cases. These reports propose the importance of long life surveillance for breast cancer treated individuals. The first cases with prolonged DFS were reported in 1887 and recurrence occurred 25 and 19 years after mastectomy [15]. Surely, they had not used chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Therefore, genetic or molecular studies may be needed to enlighten the dark horizon to us.\n\nDCIS by definition is a non-invasive disease; however, invasive components may be missed in tissue sampling or even in post-operative pathologic samples. These cases may have Lymph Node (LN) metastasis at presentation or may behave like an invasive disease [16, 17].\n\nIn general, HER2 receptor status and P53 mutation are widely checked in breast cancer cells, but their role in late relapse is not so clear [18]. In the recent years, some biomarkers are used to realize which patient is at risk for recurrence or metastasis. In this regard, cytokeratin-19 may be the best factor which can be used to find the tumor cells in bone marrow or blood. However, it is not accurate enough yet to be used as a test for decision making or as a prognostic index in breast cancer patients [19].\n\nThe current guidelines (NCCN 2012) recommend annual mammogram for long time [20]. The question is whether this time interval is enough, more, or less than what is required. The chemotherapy agent, surgery (especially lymph node dissection), hormone therapy, and trastuzumab have also their own long- term side effects. Thus, more studies are needed in order to determine the effect of these factors on prolonged survival.\n\nAnother ethical point is whether a young woman with breast cancer should be told that she will have a short survival or not. Our first case that was 30 years old on arrival delivered and grew up 5 children after diagnosis of breast carcinoma. Furthermore, the need for stronger chemotherapy agents should be revised."
