        "text": "Barnett Rubin\n\nOral Histories of U.S. Diplomacy in Afghanistan, 2001–2021\n\nInterviewed by: Robin Matthewman\n\nInitial interview date: May 15, 2023\n\nCopyright 2023 ADST\n\nQ: It’s May 15, 2023. I’m Robin Matthewman. Today I have the pleasure of interviewing Dr. Barnett Rubin for ADST’s Afghanistan project. May I call you Barney?\n\nRUBIN: Yes, please do.\n\nQ: Just to start off, can you tell us about your background and how you got to be so involved with Afghanistan.\n\nRUBIN: I went to graduate school at the University of Chicago Political Science Department, and I concentrated on South Asian studies. I wrote my dissertation on India. While I was in Chicago, I also founded, with a colleague, an Amnesty International adoption group, which is the basic grassroots unit of Amnesty International. Then I was asked by the Amnesty Research office in London to start what they called a coordination group for South Asia in the U.S. section. I did that together with another colleague from the University of Chicago, Patricia Gossman. Then we started working on all South Asia.\n\nAt that time, soon after the 1978 Zia coup, a lot of the work we did was on Pakistan. Then after 1978–1979, the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan, and I started getting, from various sources, a lot of information about atrocities and abuses, and so on, which Amnesty was not covering for various reasons.\n\nI started working to research human rights violations in Afghanistan, myself, from various sources: France, Afghans who came to the United States and so on. Then I was asked by Jeri Laber, director of what was then Helsinki Watch, which was something that became part of Human Rights Watch, to write the first human rights report on Afghanistan. That was in the fall of 1984: “Tears, Blood, and Cries.” I wrote another one in 1985. By that time, I started getting interested in Afghanistan as a research subject as a political scientist as well.\n\nI also had a friend named Larry Lifschultz who at that time was the South Asian Bureau chief of the Far Eastern Economic Review. It was a magazine. It doesn’t exist anymore. He was the South Asian Bureau chief. He was also covering Pakistan and various things about the Afghan war. He started covering the start of negotiations led by UN [United Nations] Special Envoy Diego Cordovez. He and also Selig Harrison, who was with the Carnegie Endowment for Peace, encouraged me and said, “You’re studying the problems. Why don’t you also look at studying the solutions.” So I started meeting Cordovez and that was how I got introduced to the world of the UN, politics, negotiation, and conflict resolution. I think I first met Cordovez in 1986.\n\nI also experienced blowback because a lot of the people—who wanted to support the Mujahideen and continue the war—were rather angered. They liked what I had done earlier, documenting atrocities by the Soviet army, but they were very much against the idea of negotiation to try to end the war. I first experienced that in 1988.\n\nThen I looked at the Geneva Accords, which were signed in 1988. I told Cordovez these Geneva Accords were supposedly between Afghanistan and Pakistan, the communist government in Afghanistan and Pakistan. But the Afghan Mujahideen they were fighting needed to be involved, too, because they were fighting the former government in Afghanistan. As a UN official at that time, he had no way of requesting a meeting with the Mujahideen. He said he could do it only if they requested such a meeting. He asked me to figure out a way that I could go and talk to the Mujahideen leaders about meeting him to talk about the negotiations.\n\nI wrote an op ed piece that appeared in the New York Times and then I sent it to a friend of mine, Anders Fänge, who was head of the Swedish Committee for Afghanistan in Peshawar, and he went around with it to some of the Mujahideen leaders and asked them what they thought about it. I said that they should ask to talk to Cordovez. Cordovez said, “I can only talk to them if they ask me to do it.”\n\nWe were all amateurs, so Anders did an amateur thing, such as I have done as well. He talked about it to Eddie Girardet, who was at that time covering Afghanistan for the Christian Science Monitor. Eddie Girardet wrote an article for the Christian Science Monitor about what we were doing [though without mentioning names], and therefore the whole thing was called off and I never went. That was a good lesson, which I still haven’t probably learned.\n\nThen there wasn’t much to do. I kept following the negotiations after the Soviet pullout to the extent that I could, but I started doing other things for a while, too. I was at the Council on Foreign Relations, head of the Center for Preventive Action, starting in 1994. I now had these UN contacts, so I had a different perspective, and we were all working at Preventive Action. That also was a different kind of diplomacy, having to do with conflict resolution, conflict prevention, as well as maintaining my region specialty.\n\nIt was in the course of work that I was doing on the Balkans—especially on the Albanians in Serbia, Kosovo, and Macedonia—that I met Richard Holbrooke, who at the time was the envoy. He arranged for us to meet in Milosevic in Belgrade. So thanks to Holbrooke I met Milosevic. I mention that because it was important. The relationship with Holbrooke was the key to the whole thing.\n\nMeanwhile, in 1987, the UN Secretary General Kofi Annan had appointed Lakhdar Brahimi, the former foreign minister of Algeria and by then also an experienced UN hand, to be his personal representative on Afghanistan. Brahimi immediately contacted me because he said, “They’re asking me to work on Afghanistan, but the United Nations knows nothing about Afghanistan. Can you help me learn about Afghanistan?” I put together a think tank for him, which consisted of five people: me, Ashraf Ghani in Washington, Bill Maley in Australia, Ahmed Rashid in Pakistan, and Olivier Roy in Paris. If I were doing that today I wouldn’t create an all-male group, but at the time, I didn’t think about it.\n\nWhile doing that, we had some meetings. We had one at UN HQ. We organized a meeting in Norway, a briefing for Brahimi, with a larger group of people and that continued to some extent. I developed a close partnership with Ashraf at that time and we worked on that together. Then when Francesc Vendrell became a special representative, the special envoy, we were still involved but not to the same extent.\n\nVendrell was a Catalan, a Spaniard, a current UN official. He just died recently. He organized a consultation outside Berlin where Ashraf and I participated along with other people. But I didn’t have the same kind of day-to-day contact with him as I had with Brahimi.\n\nAfter 9/11, the day itself was something else. I was actually in the subway when it happened.\n\nQ: Before we move on to that period, were you working on Afghanistan during the Taliban period, six years?\n\nRUBIN: Yes. I was working on it quite a bit actually. The in-depth academic research that I had done predated that. During the Taliban period I had no official role, but I would give talks, I would testify before Congress. I was still concerned about how to find a political settlement. I was talking to those that were working on it, but I wasn’t really involved at all.\n\nQ: Was this all in English or did you have some of these languages?\n\nRUBIN: I speak to them, but not very well. Most of my work is done in English or French. I also, during that time, became a member of the Board of the Central Eurasia Project of the Open Society Foundation, the Soros Foundation, which meant that I was working on Central Asia, so I traveled quite a bit around Central Asia, and that integrated with my work with the Council on Foreign Relations. We did a project at CFR on the Fergana Valley, which took us to Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan.\n\nQ: Was it mostly an economic project?\n\nRUBIN: No, political. It was about preventing conflict. That was in the ’90s. Then at that time, Brahimi was appointed in ’97, not ’87. I may have misspoken. Then I was at the Council. In ’97–’98 I went to Central Asia with the Soros Foundation and also for my own project. On one of those occasions when I went with the Soros Foundation, Brahimi also asked me to look at what the UN was doing in Afghanistan, this was in the spring of 1998, and do an evaluation. So I asked him, “What are my terms of reference?” And very Brahimi-like, he said, “Go there and look around and tell me what you think.”\n\nQ: What did you tell him?\n\nRUBIN: I flew to Islamabad. The UN had just been expelled from Afghanistan by the Taliban. I went first to Islamabad and then I flew to Kandahar on the first UN flight back into Kandahar after they were all expelled, and I was staying with the UN. I went around and I interviewed some NGO and UN staff, as well as Taliban officials in Kandahar and, most notably Abdul Wakil Mutawakkil, who later became the Taliban foreign minister. I’m still in touch with him. He was in Kabul during the U.S. period. He didn’t join the fighting.\n\nThen I went to Kandahar. Then from Kandahar, I was driven in a UN vehicle from Kandahar to Farah, in the southwest, via Helmand. I spent all night in Lashkar Gah [capital of Helmand] and then I went to Farah to look at the UN field operations in the rural areas of the country. I stayed out there and observed the situation the best I could, met some of the Taliban in Helmand and non-Taliban Afghans as well, including farmers, customers in a tea house, currency traders, and bank officials.\n\nThen I went back to Islamabad. Then I flew to Kabul and met Taliban officials and UN officials and NGO people who were there. Then I was supposed to fly back to Islamabad, but all the planes were being used for emergency relief for an earthquake. So I drove back from Islamabad to Peshawar. It was safe to do that at that time. Then I wrote a report.\n\nQ: Can you give us an outline of what you saw, what your report said?\n\nRUBIN: The Taliban had effective control of most of the country. I also went to teahouses to talk to people in Kandahar and then on the road to Farah. My driver, who was a former army officer from Ghazni, didn’t want to take me to certain places, because he was afraid of the Taliban and even Kandaharis more broadly. For instance in Kandahar he took me to a tea house which I gradually came to understand was a gathering place for non-Kandahari men. .\n\nOne thing that impressed me in my conversations in the tea houses was that everyone I talked to was talking about development. They were complaining. One man said, “Before the Taliban came, there was so much violence, crime that we were afraid to go out of our houses. Now it’s safe to go out of our houses. We’d also like our children to be educated and we would like some development.” He didn’t use the word, but he talked about how the roads under Zahir Shah were smooth.\n\nIn another place in a teahouse on the way to Farah, this guy said, “Look, here’s the Helmand River. They can build dams. They can make electricity, irrigate the land and they’re not doing anything.” And they talked about politics. There was recognition of the Taliban’s accomplishments in bringing crime and disorder under control, but also generally a desire, a chafing against the limits that the Taliban placed on them. People did not understand why there was still a war going on. They said, “Why are Afghans fighting with Afghans?” I didn’t meet anyone who supported fighting against the Northern Alliance. They didn’t see the point of it. The Taliban had some other agenda. The non-Taliban Afghans were trying to figure out what the agenda was. Is the United States trying to take control of the minerals in Afghanistan? They were serious about that. What really struck me was how people were focused on development.\n\nWhen I came back from that trip, I concluded that the Taliban were likely to win the war because they were the only side that had nationwide organization that was really organized in a unitary way. The other side was too divided, plus, the Taliban had religious legitimacy, not necessarily with the population, but in their ranks. Members of the Taliban had a religious obligation to follow their leader, which was something you didn’t have in any other organization.\n\nWhen I came back, I had a small group meeting with a journalist from Le Monde. I remember I said to her, “Outside of Afghanistan, when people talk about Afghanistan all they talk about is Islamic extremism. But when inside Afghanistan, the only thing people talk about is money.” Do you know the film, My Dinner with Andre?\n\nQ: No, I haven’t seen it.\n\nRUBIN: It’s a film of two guys having dinner in a restaurant in New York. One of them is older, a theater director, the other one is younger, an actor and playwright. The younger guy, on his way in a taxi to the restaurant, comments in voiceover, When I was ten years old, I was rich, I was an aristocrat––riding around in taxis, surrounded by comfort––and all I thought about was art and music. Now I’m thirty-six, and all I think about is money.”\n\nQ: I was an economic officer at State, so I always think things come down to money.\n\nRUBIN: They do come down to money a lot more than people realize. For instance, the Taliban got the support of the traders because they cleared the highways from banditry. That was one of their sources of their income, besides drugs. Drugs were not so profitable at that time because they weren’t treated as illegal.\n\nQ: In the ’90s, the assistant secretary for South Asia, Robin Raphel, went and met Taliban leadership, and then came back to the State Department and gave a briefing to interested staff.\n\nRUBIN: I know her quite well.\n\nQ: I remember being sure to go. I was working on oil and gas pipelines in Central Asia, so I was interested in whatever might make sense or not make sense about the gas pipeline Occidental Petroleum was talking about. I asked, “What are the Taliban like?” She said, “They have a very strong emphasis on purity.” Did you get that sense when you talked to the officials that they had a strong ideological agenda?\n\nRUBIN: I knew that they did. I talked to non-Taliban too. In Kabul, I had a driver from the UN who was a regular Afghan. He told me, in Persian, he was dressed like a mullah. He said the people of Kabul used to be free. And because I knew the importance of money, I went to see the moneychangers in Kandahar and Kabul. In Kandahar, there’s a moneychanger street. In Kabul, there is a building, like an exchange. There were no women there. A woman came in with her son, about ten years old, who was her mahram, to escort her. And as soon as she came, this armed Taliban started looking at her suspiciously. Then all the men who worked in the money exchange got up to protect her or to see what they could do for her. I could see the tension of the presence of this one woman. Plus, the poverty. While I was being driven through the city, one old guy practically threw himself under my car to try to get something out of us.\n\nQ: It was one of the poorest countries in the world. The war had been going on since 1980.\n\nRUBIN: Now, it’s absolutely the poorest country in the world. I’m certain, no doubt about that. It has to be.\n\nQ: Was there anything else you wanted to mention, on the eve of 9/11? Were there any other views that you had about reconciliation, about conflict prevention?\n\nRUBIN: I should also mention, after the Taliban took over in January of 1997, they sent a delegation to New York to ask the secretary general to recognize their government. I had to explain to them that’s not how the UN works. While they were there, somehow it was arranged that they would give a talk at Columbia University. I was at the Council on Foreign Relations by then, but I had taught at Columbia, so Columbia asked me to chair the meeting. So I chaired that meeting, which included a number of people in the Taliban whom I knew and worked with to some extent later, after 9/11, when, like Wakil Ahmad, they did not go back and join the insurgency.\n\nThat was when I first met Abdul Wakil before I went to Kandahar, and Abdul Hakim Mujahid, who was later on the High Peace Council. He was the guy who gave me my visa to Taliban-controlled Afghanistan, because he was in charge of the embassy in Islamabad. That was interesting watching them interact, not just with each other, but with the students at Columbia, mostly grad students, many of them foreigners.\n\nQ: What happened?\n\nRUBIN: At that time, they were looking for international recognition. Mutawakkil gave a speech in which he said something like, “Taliban are not terrorists. Taliban are not extremists. We will help the United States in the fight against terrorism.” During the question period, the head of the Muslim Student Association of Columbia stood up and said, “Why are the Taliban accepting the American definition of terrorism?” And the Taliban were taken aback because this was all new to them. They didn’t know this world. They met Osama bin Laden for the first time a few months before that and they didn’t really know who he was.\n\nQ: What did the student mean when he referred to the U.S. definition of terrorism?\n\nRUBIN: Treating people he would regard as liberation fighters or Mujahideen as terrorists.\n\nQ: They had met Osama bin Laden a few months before, you said?\n\nRUBIN: When they captured Jalalabad in September 1996, they found Osama bin Laden. When Osama bin Laden came back to Afghanistan from Sudan in May 1996, he did not go to the areas controlled by the Taliban. He didn’t know the Taliban and the Taliban didn’t know him at all. He went to Eastern Afghanistan where he had been active before, where he knew people. So the Taliban just found him in Jalalabad. And what they knew about him, as they told me later, was he was a Mujahid in trouble, so naturally, they gave him refuge. Then they started having some conflicts with him over his militant and aggressive public statements, and they asked him to come to Kandahar so they could keep their eyes on him. I got this from reading and talking with them, not personal experience. When Mullah Umar told Osama to come to Kandahar, he thought they were going to kill him, but they didn’t, of course.\n\nQ: Did bin Laden, at some point, start funneling money to the Taliban government?\n\nRUBIN: I don’t think he gave money to the government. Financial things were organized. But he built things. It’s impossible to verify any of this. He built Mullah Omar’s compound in Kandahar, so I was told. He helped improve the transmission of electricity from the Kajaki Dam to Kandahar City. Most of what funds he had he used for military purposes. That was a subsidy to the Taliban in the sense that his men were getting trained for what they really wanted to do by fighting on behalf of the Taliban.\n\nQ: Let’s go back to what you were starting to say about 2001, September 11.\n\nRUBIN: I was in the subway when there was some kind of announcement, the subway is not going below Union Square because of a plane crash at the World Trade Center and they told you what other trains you could take.\n\nThen I got to my office, which was downtown, and I found out what was happening. I immediately knew it was al Qaeda. I knew it was Osama bin Laden. Almost nobody was familiar with the term “al Qaeda” at that time. We just called them the Arabs. I managed to get home finally after the subway reopened, above Fourteenth Street.\n\nI was wearing a suit and tie that day because I was supposed to speak at the Council of Foreign Relations that afternoon, chairing a meeting. The main speaker was General John Vessey, who had been the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff under President Ronald Reagan. Vessey chaired my Advisory Board at the Council on Foreign Relations. I went to see him in his hotel the next day, and I said, “It’s like Pearl Harbor.” He said, “It’s worse than Pearl Harbor.”\n\nThat morning, September 12, I remember I told my wife, “Well, the rest of my life is now going to change,” something like that.\n\nQ: You knew.\n\nRUBIN: Yes. Then several things happened. Craig Karp—who at that time worked in the South Asia regional bureau at the State Department—sent me a brief email and asked me to come to a meeting. He said, “Can you come to State on Tuesday, for the Future of Afghanistan discussion.” I said okay. So I went there. I also convinced him to invite Ashraf to that as well. It was mostly relatively junior interagency folks, but also four people from the outside: Me, Ashraf, Arnie, and Tom Gouttierre from the Afghan Studies Center at the University of Nebraska at Omaha, and it was chaired by Richard Haass, who at that time was chair of policy planning. I believe this was a setup done by him and Colin Powell.\n\nThis meeting was interesting. Richard said the decision to invade had already been made. Except in the unlikely event the Taliban turned over OBL [Osama bin Laden], the U.S. was going in to overturn the government. Then Richard asked, what do we do after that? First, he turned to the outside experts. All the experts said, you can’t just destroy the country’s government and then leave. You have to help them put together something that’s an interim government. As soon as we said that, all the young people from the Bush White House [NSC] said, “That’s nation building. We don’t do nation building.”\n\nQ: They actually said that, at the time?\n\nRUBIN: Yes. We don’t do nation building. They were very aggressive about it. Then there was a guy, a Special Forces officer I knew from the previous wars in Afghanistan, David Champagne. He trained Special Forces in cultural competence. He was there. He said, “We did this to the Afghan people and we have a responsibility.” The room went completely silent.\n\nQ: We hadn’t gone in militarily yet. What did he mean?\n\nRUBIN: We had supplied the Mujahideen with weapons and acquiesced to Pakistan’s priorities about who should receive them. The U.S. had done nothing to build up a political alternative. That silenced the debate at that point. Then we went on and talked about the role for the UN, an international force, things like that. Both Ashraf Ghani and I urged support for a UN role and a sort of multinational force to maintain security while the Afghans built their new government and security forces.\n\nAs I recall—there was no documentation for this—toward the end of the meeting, I said, “All I’m saying is, go in there with some Afghan leaders, help them set up some kind of a functioning authority that could police the territory and then leave. I’m not saying turn Afghanistan into a functioning democracy in four years.” Richard Haass said, “Okay, nation building-lite,” which was the first time I heard that phrase. Maybe he invented it on the spot. It’s interesting that I said we weren’t going to try to make Afghanistan into a functioning demo, but we did it, and I was involved.\n\nBack in New York, a few days later, I went to the dentist. I was sitting in the dentist chair when Brahimi called me. He told me, “The secretary general has asked me to come back to the UN and lead the Afghanistan mission to take over from Vendrell and we’re going to have negotiations, and I would like you and Ashraf to come and help me.” So I went to work for Brahimi.\n\nQ: What did Ashraf Ghani say in the meeting?\n\nRUBIN: One thing I remember him saying is that it was necessary to have some kind of international UN force in Kabul because without that, Kabul was at risk of being torn apart again by warlords as it had been under the previous Mujahideen government, and there would be no space for politics. He and I both pushed that idea. That’s what later became ISAF [International Security Assistance Force].\n\nSoon after that, I went to see Jean-Marie Guehenno, who was under secretary general of the UN for Peacekeeping Affairs. I met Jean-Marie and Salman Ahmed, who was JMG’s chief of staff and is now in Policy Planning at the State Department. I told Jean-Marie and Salman, “The UN might be asked to send a peacekeeping force to Afghanistan.” And all the blood drained out of their faces. But it turned out that it was impossible to send a PKO, so the Security Council approved a resolution authorizing a multi-national force under chapter six of the Charter, enforcing peace and security, not chapter five, peacekeeping.\n\nA few days after Brahimi called me, he came to New York. At first, he and I and Ashraf met over dinner together with Iqbal Reza, a Pakistani retired UN official. Brahimi had known him for a long time, because he had some role in supporting the Algerian national liberation movement. Then that weekend he went down to Washington to talk to what he called “the Americans,” i.e. the U.S. government. I also went down and we all had dinner at Ashraf’s house.\n\nQ: Ghani was at the World Bank at this point?\n\nRUBIN: Yes. We talked over various concepts for the UN mission that Brahimi would assemble. Then the idea was that I should write tentative terms of reference for that UN mission. I took the train back to New York with Brahimi and while I was sitting next to him, I started writing the terms of reference. It was far from the final product, a Security Council resolution passed in March 2002, but that was the first draft of the UNAMA [United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan] Terms of Reference.\n\nQ: What was the original idea and what did it end up being?\n\nRUBIN: The idea was the UN presence in Afghanistan at that time, before 9/11, was all humanitarian. That meant within the organization humanitarian people had the greatest say in Afghanistan. There was no political mission.\n\nI wrote that from now on, the political side has to be in the lead. When one of my drafts got circulated, a lot of humanitarian people were pissed off. I said that in some meetings in the UN, but I didn’t have a contract with the UN. I never was formerly hired by the UN, but because of Brahimi, he treated me as if I was his close assistant, his aide, so I got into all kinds of meetings.\n\nI remember there was one meeting with all the under secretary generals, senior people, assistant secretaries. This was when the Taliban realized they were defeated and were planning to hand over the northern hub of Kunduz to the Northern Alliance. But there were also a bunch of Pakistanis, “retired” officers on contract, and a lot of al Qaeda fighters, too. They were trying to figure out what to do. So we were trying to figure out what to do about that, but nothing came of it. Suddenly, I’m dealing with high levels of the UN. Also many of the UN missions were contacting me.\n\nWhen I went to Washington, Ashraf proposed to me that we should do a joint project. This was before Brahimi called. The project was to restructure Afghanistan to convene working groups of Afghan professionals and diaspora to start making up plans for a future Afghan state. So I put that together as a proposal for a project to be housed at CIC, the Center on International Cooperation at New York University. That’s where I was working at the time.\n\nBrahimi and Ashraf came back to New York. We went to lunch with the Norwegian state secretary for international affairs—Ashraf, Brahimi, and I. The Norwegians gave us a million dollars. The Soros Foundation gave us three hundred thousand dollars, so we started working on that in parallel with my work at the UN. The idea was to support the UN; eventually, it turned into a project in support of the implementation of the Bonn Accords. There were no Bonn Accords at that time. At that point, people were just showering money on us. I turned down some grants because it would have given me more money than I had budgeted to use and I didn’t think it was proper.\n\nQ: Did Ghani know a lot of expat Afghans who would be interested in going back to try to help?\n\nRUBIN: He said he did.\n\nQ: The other Afghan-born person important at that time, who was in the U.S. government and also had some knowledge of the country, was Khalilzad.\n\nRUBIN: I met Ashraf in 1984, when he gave a talk to the Asia Society and I was at Columbia. This was when we started working together.\n\nI went to graduate school with Zal. He came to the University of Chicago in January of 1974 from American University in Beirut, so I knew him way back from that time. After 9/11 he was at the National Security Council, but he was also appointed as a special envoy. So he was also at Bonn along with Jim Dobbins. Jim Dobbins was the formal envoy and he would attend meetings. Zal would be like a fly on the wall, talking to everybody and making plans. He’d get on the phone and talk to the Afghans on the ground in Afghanistan and talk to the Special Forces.\n\nBefore Bonn, Ashraf and Lakhdar went on an international trip. They were going around to various regional countries to talk to people about this. After they got back, Ashraf and I were with Brahimi in his office when Richard Haass called Brahimi and said, “The president is getting impatient. He wants to go faster.” Brahimi said, “No,” and hung up. He looked at Ashraf and me and said, “You see how they treat us.”\n\nQ: When they said the president wants you to go faster, what was the product they wanted?\n\nRUBIN: I didn’t hear him say it, but as relayed to me from Brahimi, he said this meeting in Bonn is taking too long. Just get the British Special Forces to bring Rabbani to Bagram Air Base, have a ceremony and make Rabbani the president without any political process involving Afghans. In other words, he was completely ignoring, rather than just making bad judgments about, the politics of Afghanistan.\n\nWhile Lakhdar and Ashraf were away, The leaders of the Northern Alliance, who were in Tajikistan, issued a statement criticizing Brahimi for hiring Ashraf because they saw him as a person with an ethnic agenda opposed to them. Then I called Ashraf—he was asleep in Tehran—and told him about it. He was annoyed that I woke him up. So Brahimi called off his visit to Tajikistan.\n\nWhen they returned, one day, I went to the UN, and Ashraf and I had cappuccino in the “Viennese café” in the basement. At that time, Ashraf had already had stomach cancer and had to watch what he ate, but he still was drinking cappuccino all the time. He can’t do that now, of course. And while we had cappuccino he said to me, “When do you think I should go to the other side?” I asked, “What do you mean?” He said, “To the Afghan government.” I said, “What role do you see for yourself?” He said, “Prime minister.” In the pre-war royal governments, the position of prime minister ran the whole government on behalf of the king.\n\nThen I went upstairs to see Brahimi and he said, “The Northern Alliance has issued a statement saying that Ashraf is a political figure and they won’t meet with him or deal with him.” He said, “You can go tell your friends,” at that time he considered the Northern Alliance people, mainly Ahmad Shah Massoud’s group, as my friends. He said, “You go tell your friends Ashraf is a professional international civil servant. He has no political ambitions.”\n\nI said, “You have put me in an awkward position because Ashraf just told me he wants to be prime minister.” Then Brahimi told me, “You go tell Ashraf that he can’t do that.” I said all right. I couldn’t just say that to Ashraf, so I suggested that he discuss it with Lakhdar. Later, Ashraf came to me and said, “I talked to Brahimi about it and everything is okay.” I don’t know what, if anything, really happened.\n\nMeanwhile, Brahimi instructed me to try and reconcile Ashraf with the Northern Alliance during the meetings in Bonn. I arranged for him to have private talks with Ahmad Wali Massoud and Humayun Tandar. Whatever they might have agreed on, it didn’t stick.\n\nQ: Is this December?\n\nRUBIN: It was the end of November. We left for Bonn after Thanksgiving. Thanksgiving was Thursday then I think we left on Sunday. Meanwhile, I had given an interview to Le Monde while I was at my sister’s house for Thanksgiving. And I had just talked to a BBC reporter in Kabul who was telling me, “The Russians are giving Rabbani a lot of money. They’re trying to put him in power. It feels like this is a coup.” She told me all these things and I was worked up about it because we were trying to start a new government through a UN-led political process and the Russians were trying to preempt that effort. Putin had already met Rabbani in Tajikistan for a photo op, and said this is the leader of Afghanistan.\n\nI was very inexperienced as an official, to put it mildly, I didn’t even know that I was a UN official. Nobody ever made me an official. I wasn’t getting a salary or anything like that. This was Brahimi’s way of operating. He told me to come, and I came. Because he asked me to come, everybody accepted it. But I had no formal position. I said to the reporter, “Les russes sont très irresponsables. Ils donnent beaucoup d’argent à Rabbani.” [“The Russians are very irresponsible. They’re giving a lot of money to Rabbani.] Then Le Monde published it with a headline, “Aide to Brahimi said the Russians are irresponsible.” Lavrov raised it in the Security Council three times and tried to get me fired. I didn’t know about it until much later. Brahimi protected me, but the Russians were quite angry at me at that time and for several years after. So we went to Bonn.\n\nQ: You were a small group still or were you much larger?\n\nRUBIN: It was much larger. The whole group was ten, fifteen people on the UN team.\n\nQ: What happened in Bonn? I think you wrote that there were four or so Afghan groups that were negotiating.\n\nRUBIN: There were four groups there. Having these four groups was Vendrell’s idea. He gave me a paper about it, asked me what I thought of it, and I told him I didn’t think it was a good idea because the groups did not represent anybody, but at least the so-called Northern Alliance had forces on the ground. The Taliban weren’t at Bonn because the Taliban were fighting the war against the United States at that time and getting targeted. They were considered terrorists just like al Qaeda, not a political force. They were not sent to Guantanamo because Guantanamo wasn’t there yet to be sent to. Pre-Guantanamo, they were sent to detention on prison ships and elsewhere—anywhere that no system of law was in force.\n\nWhile we were there, I was in charge of drafting certain things and talking to the Afghan delegates—many of whom I knew—about certain issues and talking to some of the regional and European diplomats there. Javad Zarif was there from Iran. He was then the director general for International Organizations. I had known him when he was deputy rep at the Iran UN mission in New York. I had been introduced to him by Giandomenico Picco, who was working with Cordovez at that time. So I interacted with them.\n\nThat’s when I first met Dobbins. One moment I was sitting at breakfast in the hotel by myself. [It was Ramadan, so the Afghans were eating only from sundown to sunrise.] Then Dobbins and Zarif came over to me together and said, “Why doesn’t the Bonn Agreement text say anything about having elections or fighting terrorism?” Brahimi and Vendrell had strongly disagreed over whether the agreement should set a date for elections. Brahimi says, “Elections cause conflict. They don’t have the mechanisms in place. We should just let them start and let them decide when they can have elections.” Vendrell, who died this year in London, was a strong believer in the liberal peace idea and he wanted elections. The United States wanted elections because elections are part of the exit strategy. They show that you succeeded.\n\nThe Northern Alliance and Iran wanted elections for strategic reasons. Humayun Tandar, the spokesman of the Northern Alliance/United Front delegation, a guy I knew since 1984 when I met him in Paris, he was a Tajik from Kabul province, he arched his eyebrows and said, “Il y aura des surprises!” (“There will be surprises”) which meant you’ll see there are not so many Pashtuns in the country. They are outnumbered by the non-Pashtuns. The Pashtuns are the plurality but a minority of the population. At any rate, no one knew how many people were living in the country. That’s a problem for having elections.\n\nFinally, the combination of Iran and the United States, Vendrell, and the Northern Alliance was irresistible, so they put a deadline for elections in the agreement.\n\nQ: Who had the idea of forming an interim government?\n\nRUBIN: The idea of an interim government, that was actually taken from the Rome group, which had a plan.\n\nQ: What was the Rome group?\n\nRUBIN: The Rome group was a group organized around Zahir Shah, the former king, who was living in exile in Rome. That was one of the four groups at Bonn. There were two groups that really counted politically, the Northern Alliance/United Front, and the Rome group. The Rome group had been working on a peace plan intermittently for years. Their plan was to have a Loya Jirga, which would choose an interim government. The interim government would write a Constitution. So we basically adopted that model. None of the other delegations had any proposals.\n\nWe adopted the idea of an “Emergency Loya Jirga” from some work by legal scholars associated with the Rome group. That was the first step. Bonn would choose the interim administration. Then the interim administration would convene an Emergency Loya Jirga, just as called for in the documents we got from the Rome group. But these documents gave no practical details. So we said, Okay, we’ll have an Emergency Loya Jirga, but we have to set a date for it. How long does it take to organize one? Ashraf wanted it to take place on Nowruz, the Afghan-Persian-Central Asian new year at the beginning of spring, which was also the start of the Afghan government’s fiscal year, but it seemed not enough time.\n\nI was looking through the documents from the Rome group to see how you organize a Loya Jirga. There’s nothing there. It said, “See detailed Appendix.” So I called up the Afghan in California who had sent me these documents and I asked him, “Where is the Appendix?” He hesitated and said, “We haven’t written it yet.”\n\nQ: What is a Loya Jirga?\n\nRUBIN: Loya Jirga means Grand Council in Pashto. It is based on an old tribal tradition of making tribal decisions through consultation among tribal leaders. Sometimes it was representative in a [non-democratic] way, sometimes its results were dictated by the leader. It was made into a state institution by rulers of Afghanistan in order to provide a kind of tribal legitimacy for the government. It was by no means democratic, but it involved some popular consultation. Some Loya Jirgas were just rubber stamps, whatever the ruler wanted. Some did actually discuss proposals and changes to some extent.\n\nTheoretically, in principle, the Loya Jirga is the highest authority in Afghanistan, higher than the ruler. That’s not true in practice, but people have been taught that, and it is kind of a hegemonic belief. So if there are major decisions to be made, they think the Loya Jirga has to make them.\n\nQ: Going back to the ethnic issue, you pointed out that there’s never been a census. People don’t know what the electorate is composed of. But the major ethnic groups are important and many people believe that the Pashtuns are the majority. So there was a sense that the interim leader would need to be a Pashtun. Is that right?\n\nRUBIN: No, I don’t think anyone believed Pashtuns were the majority, but they did believe that Pashtuns were a plurality and had ruled Afghanistan for two hundred and fifty years, though not because they won elections. The Afghan state was structured originally as a conquest empire. Pashtuns were the largest group, but it was like this particular tribe, the Durranis and specifically the Popalzais and later the Muhammadzais [who were Barakzais] owned the state and then distributed the benefit of that state to others. Pashtuns were the core of that power; not all Pashtuns, but those who were aligned with or empowered by the government. Amir Abdul Rahman Khan [ruled 1879–1901] made a treaty with the elders of the Muhammadzais, naming them “Sharik-ud-Dawlat,” partners of the state.\n\nIt was not a modern bureaucratic state. It survived the Communist Revolution. Before that, the Republican Revolution had disrupted all of that and there was no way to bring that system back. All kinds of things had disrupted it. But it still existed in the minds of the people. And the main area where the Taliban operated and the main support of the Taliban was among Pashtuns. Pashtuns also supported the Taliban.\n\nIn 1999 I attended a UN conference on narcotics in the region in Tashkent, over lunch with Doctor Abdullah, and he said something like, it’s hard to understand, but the people of Afghanistan really believe in the Afghan state. There is practically nothing on the ground that corresponds to it, but they believe in it. I don’t know why.\n\nAt Bonn, we were concerned that if it seemed that the UN was consecrating an ethnic victory by Tajiks—because the Tajiks had already entered Kabul with their guns and were in charge of everything, because whoever has the guns to control Kabul are in charge of the army—it might have given the Taliban a way to turn it into an ethnic conflict and make a comeback. That never fully happened, but it was something that the Taliban tried to do.\n\nAlso to try to legitimize the government, the idea was to try to appeal to the long hundreds-year old traditions of Afghan statehood. So Hamid Karzai was not just Pashtun; he was from the Popalzai, from the same tribe as the founder of Afghanistan, Ahmad Shah Durrani, founder of the empire of the Afghans, the State of the Afghans. The capital would be in Kabul, as it had been since 1775. Then there was a major role for other ethnic groups as well and Karzai was relatively good at being inclusive in that way.\n\nQ: Did you know Karzai before?\n\nRUBIN: Yes, I met Karzai sometime in the 1980s. I knew Karzai and his brother, Qayum.\n\nQ: What was he doing? Am I right that he had ended up in India instead of Pakistan, where many had gone?\n\nRUBIN: He didn’t end up in India. He just studied in India. I first encountered him in Islamabad and his brother in Maryland. Hamid Karzai stayed in Pakistan and he was active with the resistance, not militarily, with the party with the Islamic National Salvation Movement led by Sibghatullah Mujaddidi. When I first saw him in Islamabad, in 1988, he was acting as spokesman for Mujahideen. After 1992 he joined the Mujahideen government as deputy minister of foreign affairs, but some of his factional foes arrested him, and he escaped.\n\nPolitically he was very active with the Rome group. But he and his father, who was an important tribal leader, were organizing around the theme of the Loya Jirga. It was interesting because he didn’t start military activity. They didn’t put the emphasis on killing people. They put the emphasis on creating an alternative source of political legitimacy through the Loya Jirga. And because of that, his father was assassinated, presumably by the Taliban. When his father was assassinated, I called him in Quetta to give my condolences. Qayum gave me his number.\n\nQ: His name started surfacing in Bonn?\n\nRUBIN: Before Bonn, I think Karzai was already a done deal. Karzai went to Dushanbe with, I think, some CIA logistical support and Massoud decided to work with him. The Panjshiris were looking for a Pashtun who would concede to them a good share of power.\n\nQ: Massoud was in Pakistan?\n\nRUBIN: No, Massoud never left Afghanistan except for one day in Pakistan in 1990. He was assassinated at his base in northern Afghanistan by al Qaeda agents on September 9, 2001.\n\nMassoud’s group, known as Shura-i-Nazar-Shamali, or Supervisory Council of the North, had concluded they needed to have a Pashtun leader for the same reasons I gave above, so as to reduce the risk of an ethnic war. They didn’t want Zahir Shah because that provided a path to bringing back the monarchy, which had a whole lot of baggage with it. That was a big issue at Bonn. And they didn’t want Abdul Haq, a major commander from Eastern Afghanistan. Abdul Haq thought Zahir Shah should recruit his own army and saw himself as its commander. When he saw Shura-i-Nazar start to enter Kabul, he decided to go into Eastern Afghanistan, where he was from, and started fighting himself, so he would have a claim to a share of power. The Taliban captured him and hanged him, which was a great loss.\n\nI knew from the beginning Karzai would be the leader because of the various ways he had been working on this Loya Jirga project with his father. He talked to a lot of people. He had gone into Afghanistan after 9/11 with the help of the CIA [Central Intelligence Agency]. The CIA was working with him. Then he was extracted at one point when his security was at risk, and they brought him back in, and he was near Kandahar. At the opening session of the Bonn conference, by pre-arrangement Karzai addressed the delegates via satellite telephone. This was a strong signal that he had the support of the U.S. and the United Front.\n\nWe in the UN team didn’t know this at the time, even though it was reported in the New York Times, because we were too busy in Bonn and then immediately going on to a donor’s conference. I have to fault the UN Secretariat for not alerting Brahimi to this news. Karzai had negotiated a truce with the Taliban in return for an amnesty that included allowing Mullah Omar to “live in dignity” in Kandahar. This was the day after he was named the interim President, and the Taliban said they would recognize him as the president in return for amnesty and for making a certain person, Mullah Naqibullah, who was an intermediary between the Taliban and Mujahideen, making him the governor of Kandahar. But Rumsfeld said no, no negotiation, and certainly no dignified life for Mullah Omar.\n\nQ: This was after Bonn?\n\nRUBIN: It was starting December 6, 2001. Karzai had been named president at Bonn, but he had no one in Kabul. The Northern Alliance/United Front, led by Shura-i-Nazar, was already in Kabul. Karzai didn’t have his own fighters, a few of them, but not like Massoud’s people did in the North. Later when Karzai flew to Kabul for his inauguration on December 22, he walked off the plane alone. He was greeted by Muhammad Qasim Fahim, Massoud’s military commander who became acting minister of defense in the interim administration. Fahim saw Karzai was alone and asked him, “Where are your men?” Karzai replied, “You are my men.”\n\nQ: I wanted to ask you about that because there are reports that we pushed for the Taliban to agree to give up al Qaeda and they wouldn’t. The Pakistanis said they traveled to Kabul and asked them and they came back and said that they wouldn’t. At the same time, there are these reports that are saying that the Taliban was willing to make a peace treaty that would include trying to protect Osama.\n\nRUBIN: They weren’t trying to protect Osama. They were trying to protect Mullah Omar. The thing is, we were asking them to do something that’s completely impossible for them to do. We were asking them to turn a Muslim, who many people considered to be a hero, over to non-Muslims and without any legal procedure whatsoever. They heard the U.S. non-Muslims saying that he’s guilty of this atrocity. We all saw it on television. There was no television in Afghanistan. Nobody knew where New York was or what was going on there.\n\nWhat some Taliban were proposing, quietly, was let us take care of it the Afghan way, which looked to Americans like a trap. The Taliban convened a Shura of ulama who said, “We would like to thank Osama for all the services he’s given to Jihad. We think it’s now time for him to leave Afghanistan.” Bin Laden didn’t turn to Mullah Omar for protection; he ran away from Mullah Omar. That’s why he was in Eastern Afghanistan where he thought he’d get more protection.\n\nIt was impossible for us to find a face-saving solution for both the Taliban so that they could do something about him in accordance with Islamic law and for the U.S. to satisfy the political demand for a harsh response.\n\nThe agreement with Karzai said nothing about OBL. We don’t have a written copy of it, though. Basically, the idea was the Taliban would surrender the four provinces they still held to Karzai. They would make Mullah Naqibullah the governor of Kandahar. There would be a complete amnesty for the Taliban and Mullah Omar would live in Kandahar with dignity. There was no power-sharing with the Taliban, or giving them positions. That was basically what the agreement was about. I can’t say that it would have helped or would have been a good basis for statehood. Even if the U.S. had agreed to it, there would have been huge problems.\n\nWhen Rumsfeld vetoed that agreement, that assured the Taliban would go into military opposition and he assured that they would seek protection from Pakistan. They always had Pakistan’s support because of Pakistan’s concerns about the U.S. and the new Afghan government in power and also for Pakistani domestic political reasons.\n\nI can talk about some of the issues in Bonn in no particular order. One of the issues was in the original draft, which was written by Vendrell, who was a constitutional lawyer, said, “The interim government shall not provide for amnesty for war crimes and crimes against humanity.” This caused quite an uproar among the Northern Alliance commanders. They also saw that there was an annex to the agreement about security, it said that the UN would send a multi-national force to secure Kabul.\n\nWhen this was reported back to Afghanistan to the commanders, what they understood was the United Nations is going to send troops to Afghanistan to arrest the Mujahideen for war crimes. Also, there was nothing in the agreement about the Mujahideen, what role they would play in the new setup, which was a tremendous source of anxiety for them.\n\nI was the point person. I had to negotiate with the Northern Alliance guy, my old friend, Humayun Tandar, language to put in the Bonn Agreement, thanking the Mujahideen, who have been for being heroes of resistance and who would now become champions of peace. The new language thanked President Rabbani for turning over power peacefully, even though, in fact, he did it only under tremendous pressure. We put that in. Many people resented that, not just the Taliban, many other people did. But it was a condition for getting the agreement implemented, even to the extent that it was.\n\nThey never implemented the annex that said the resistance forces should not enter Kabul. The fact is they were already in Kabul. It was too late to undo that. The only way that would have kept them out of Kabul would have been if the U.S. or the UK had been willing to send Special Forces to secure Kabul, and neither of them was willing to do that. As it happened, the international coalition had become a partner of the Afghan forces that were already in Kabul rather than a replacement for them.\n\nThere was an issue about the structure of the interim government. First of all, Ashraf wanted there to be a fifteen-person cabinet because he said it would be more efficient to consolidate ministries. He was thinking about government like a technocrat. Qanuni said no, there’s twenty-eight ministries, because he had a patronage problem. He had to give positions to all the various people in his coalition. He wasn’t thinking about a government. Actually, nobody was thinking about governing Afghanistan. That’s an important point to make. We ended up with one extra ministry because we also got the Ministry of Women’s Affairs.\n\nThere was the question of the executive. Vendrell was a convinced adherent to and a believer in parliamentary democracy. He would have liked to have to restore Zarif Shah and have a parliamentary democracy. We did have a discussion about Zahir Shah because eventually Zahir Shah said that he would chair and open the Loya Jirga. Originally he said he would chair the Loya Jirga and the United Front said no. They really didn’t want him involved at all. They were very suspicious. Eventually, they conceded they would allow him to open the Loya Jirga and that was all.\n\nThen the question is who has the executive power. The way Vendrell had drafted it for a constitutional monarchy, the prime minister had most executive power. So there would be a prime minister and then there would be a president who would replace the king as the representative of the state but not running the government.\n\nI wish I could remember how this happened. I know that Brahimi really didn’t like that system. He thought it would create a civil war inside the government because there were no institutions to limit the powers in each one. The president and the prime minister would be fighting all the time, like Rabbani and Hekmatyar, in the ’90s. So somehow or other the prime minister was removed from the plan and they just had a president.\n\nEven though the president had no power, that was the main thing because it gave him the power to appoint people. Gradually, he changed the composition of the government. But they had conveyed, the Panjshiris, the Northern Alliance, not the whole Northern Alliance, they wanted to have a prime minister. They also wanted to get foreign minister, defense minister, interior minister, intelligence, and they did. They got all those things.\n\nQ: In Bonn?\n\nRUBIN: In Bonn, yes. In fact, they got them on the ground in Kabul, and Bonn ratified it.\n\nOne other question. I hear from many people that the United States imposed a centralized government on Afghanistan, which is traditionally decentralized, which is a half-truth. Afghanistan is traditionally decentralized. It is still decentralized today. But the government of Afghanistan is centralized. Many institutions of governance in Afghanistan are not controlled by the government, but they are not established by a decentralized constitution or legal framework either. It’s non-centralized more than decentralized. There has never been an institutionalized devolution of power. The Bonn Conference never discussed decentralization of government.\n\nThe thing was we needed some kind of legal framework for the interim government. So we reached back to the last constitution of Afghanistan before all the trouble started, the 1964 constitution, which was the King’s constitution. Except for the parts about the monarchy and the Parliament, because the interim government wouldn’t have a king or a Parliament. That was difficult for the Iranians because it meant there was a danger of restoring a Shah. Zarif said, “I’d be putting myself in danger if I agree to this.” But we gave him assurances. Some of the people in the room were disappointed and they were still trying to get Zahir Shah in office later.\n\nIt also used some UN boilerplate language to say that there would be disarmament. The fighters would be disarmed. The trifecta of things that the Mujahideen understood was that the U.S./UN were going to disarm the Mujahidin, arrest them and then imprison them for war crimes. That was what they thought was the plan.\n\nI was working with Humayun Tandar on the paragraph to appease them and I could see how nervous he was because people back on the ground were getting really nervous.\n\nThe first few days of the meeting, the issue was what are we doing here. Rabbani had instructed Qanuni not to make an agreement. As far as Rabbani was concerned, he was the president. Putin had endorsed him. He told Qanuni, you just go there and consult, then come back and talk to me.\n\nI happen to know through my personal contacts that the Panjshiris didn’t agree with that because the Panjshiris wanted to use Hamid Karzai to get rid of Rabbani. That was the jiu-jitsu of three-dimensional chess that they were playing, and they made it clear to me that’s what they were trying to do. But they couldn’t do it openly.\n\nWe controlled their transport. The U.S. and Britain controlled their transport. The United Front came to Bonn on a British military aircraft. Brahimi sent me to greet them at the front desk of the hotel, where a nice German woman told me that for each guest she would need their date of birth and a credit card. I tried to explain to her that these guys did not have credit cards [though they got them soon enough] and didn’t have any documentation of their date of birth.\n\nAt one point, under pressure from Rabbani, Qanooni was half-heartedly threatening to leave. I remember Ashraf, Brahimi and I were discussing the state of play—we were trying to arrange negotiations between Northern Alliance opponents of Rabbani and the Rome Group—when Jim Dobbins came in and asked to speak to Brahimi alone. On our way out we heard Dobbins saying, “Powell says not to let them leave.” They didn’t really want to leave, and we didn’t let them leave. Then we had to get Rabbani to agree to step down as president. That was not easy.\n\nQ: Who was doing that work?\n\nRUBIN: Reach back to U.S. forces in Afghanistan plus ultimately a coordinated effort with Russia and Iran that made it clear to Rabbani that no one would support him if he insisted on staying in office. That’s how that work was done on many issues. For instance, at the beginning the Rome group was insisting on keeping a larger role for the king. The Rome group had nominated Abdul Satar Sirat to be the interim chair [president], who was an Uzbek and former Chief Justice, who was teaching Islamic law in Saudi Arabia. Basically, the idea means they’re nominating for an interim chair someone who could not become the president at the emergency Loya Jirga. He’s holding the seat open for Zahir Shah, whereas Karzai, a Durrani Popalzai could become president. So Brahimi called the king’s son-in-law, General Abdul Wali, in Rome, and speaking to him in French, politely asked for his assistance. Could he persuade the Rome group to withdraw the nomination of Sirat, and would Zahir Shah be willing to announce that he did not wish to lead the government? Abdul Wali declined.\n\nThe Rome group was claiming that somehow they had been given the power to choose the leader and they had “elected” Sirat, so he was the democratic choice. In reality, the U.S. and the United Front had agreed on Hamid Karzai. As far as Brahimi was concerned, the delegations at Bonn did not represent anyone and could not decide things by voting among themselves. Instead, the choice of leader had to be ratified by consensus, by agreement of all four groups.\n\nSo Brahimi called in Qanooni and asked him if he objected to Sirat as leader. Qanooni said he did, but he could not say that as a public position because his wife and Sirat’s wife were cousins [both Safi Pashtuns]. So ultimately, Brahimi got Hamid Gailani, the head of the Peshawar group, and son of Sayyid Ahmad Gailani, the leader of the Qadiri Sufi order in Afghanistan, to object to Sirat. Then [as I recall] Brahimi, Dobbins, and Qanooni agreed that Karzai would be the chair. Sirat complained that if this was the plan all along, we should have told him, and he had a point, but the speech of Karzai at the opening session was a message he failed to understand.\n\nThen Qanooni came with his proposal for a government. The main thing was we had cabinet lists, which each delegation had given us. Because they had the power and people on the ground, we basically had to work from the list the Northern Alliance had given us, but it was very ethnically and regionally unbalanced. It had Hamid Karzai as the chair [president], but Panjshiris had the positions of prime minister [Qanuni], Foreign minister [Abdullah]. Defense Minister [Fahim], Interior Minister [also Qanuni, concurrently with PM], and intelligence chief [Arif]. The complete domination of a single small group would not be acceptable. So Brahimi sent me to show the list to Sirat and solicit his opinion about the cabinet list. We anticipated that he would say that one group could not dominate everything. But when I gave the list to Sirat and asked, “What do you think of this?” his only response was, “Hamid Karzai is not capable of doing that job.” He wanted that job. So, as a result, Sirat has written articles about how I personally established Pashtun domination in Afghanistan along with Khalilzad, Hamid Karzai, and Ashraf Ghani.\n\nAfghanistan was not a tabula rasa. While people were labeling it a “failed state,” the old state institutions were still in place, even if not functioning. State institutions were there before we got there, with the centralized structure and bureaucratic procedures. A lot of what we put in the Bonn Agreement was just to try to find a framework within which what was actually on the ground could operate. It didn’t work that well. The other thing that was going on with the government in Afghanistan was the war on terror, which was totally outside the purview of the Bonn Agreement, except that, at the insistence of the U.S. and Iran, it contained a proviso that the interim authorities would cooperate in fighting terrorism.\n\nQ: I think in one of your books you made a comment that for the U.S., the war that was trying to be resolved had started in 2001, but for the UN, you were looking at a war that had been going on for seventeen years.\n\nRUBIN: Many Afghans, and also us in the UN, we thought that Bonn was a peace conference. One thing that happened there was Congressmen Dana Rohrbacher from Orange County [California’s Fourth-Eighth district] showed up and somehow he got in. He asked the UN to gather the Mujahideen. So we got the people from the Northern Alliance and he met them. To translate we got the official translator who was Jawed Ludin, who later became deputy foreign minister, at that time, was a grad student at LSE [London School of Economics and Political Science].\n\nRohrbacher started his talk by saying, “I want to thank you for taking vengeance on our enemies and I want to let you know that any weapons that you need we’ll give you.” That was the tenor of it.\n\nQ: Is that what you got out of Dobbins and the U.S. delegation as well?\n\nRUBIN: No. Jawed Ludin was very upset and said, “I thought this was a peace conference.” That’s just to illustrate the different perspectives. A lot of the Taliban thought, so did Jalaluddin Haqqani thought, “I’m against the Americans invading, but this is an opportunity for Afghans to make peace.” A lot of the Taliban surrendered. A lot of the commanders who captured them all had the same idea, now is the time to make peace. Now that the Americans are here, we can rebuild the country. I don’t know that they’re capable of doing it. But, the US didn’t want peace. We wanted the war on terror.\n\nQ: If we had caught Osama bin Laden immediately, maybe it would have been different.\n\nRUBIN: It certainly would have been different. I can’t predict what would have happened.\n\nQ: But that was on our mind?\n\nRUBIN: It was sort of on our mind, more the U.S. mind than the UN. The UN mandate was an agreement on the next government. When the U.S. had a chance to capture Osama, they sent the troops to Iraq instead.\n\nQ: Anything else on Bonn that you want to mention?\n\nRUBIN: Ashraf had drafted an article for the agreement that said there would be a civil service commission, which will appoint civil servants based on merit. It will provide lists from which the government will appoint people, this, that and the other thing, and there would be a code of conduct. That was the one thing that all four Afghan groups at Bonn agreed on—they did not want that. The exception I should say was Anwar-ul-Haq Ahady. He endorsed it.\n\nQ: Because it’s a culture where giving appointments—\n\nRUBIN: The only power they would have if they got out into office would be to make appointments. It’s the way the government works.\n\nQ: After Bonn, what happened?\n\nRUBIN: I was sitting in my office sometime in January, I think, and somebody told me, “It says on the radio that you’ve been invited to Kabul as a special guest of the government for Nowruz.”\n\nQ: Can you explain what Nowruz is?\n\nRUBIN: Nowruz is the Persian New Year to mark the beginning of spring, approximately March 21, which is celebrated throughout that whole region, from Turkey to North India, through Central Asia. They never really managed to send me an invitation. They were not very well organized, but I found out that it was true. So I went. I had dinner with Karzai and Zal and my fellow honorees, there were only three or four of us, on the eve of Nowruz, in the palace. And I had a good talk with Karzai there about politics.\n\nI was trying to launch the project that Ashraf and I had started, and he was already there. He set up a new organization, the Aid Coordination Agency. So I saw him, but he was not really working on our project. It could never work that he and I tried to run a project together. There was a vacuum when he left, nonetheless.\n\nI’m trying not to confuse different visits. At that time, Zahir Shah had not returned. Later he did return, and when I was there in May, he had returned. I went to his residence and he was holding jirgas and he was having visitors, tribesmen from Paktia.\n\nQ: You are talking about the former King?\n\nRUBIN: Yes, the former King, tribesman from Paktia, Eastern Afghanistan, the same tribes that had brought his father into power, in 1928, 1929, by kicking out a short-lived Tajik usurper, as they viewed him. First, the rebels kicked out King Amanullah. Then This guy came in for nine months and then the Pashtuns kicked him out again. I met someone I knew there, the son of a famous scholar in Afghanistan, whom I had known in Peshawar. He was translating for me. He said the tribesmen were saying, “Just give us the word. We will chase the usurpers out of Kabul like our fathers did before us.” Zahir Shah told him, no, the most important thing is peace.\n\nQ: That’s one good thing. What month was this? Crocker got there in January.\n\nRUBIN: Crocker had left already.\n\nQ: And Ambassador Finn came. He was there for two years.\n\nRUBIN: I was present when Finn was sworn in around Nowruz. I was accompanied by Anthony Richter from Open Society Foundation. The government took me on a tour of the areas north of Kabul that had been devastated by the Taliban. I met some former commanders. I found out that I was much more well-known than I thought. They said that Ahmed Shah Massoud used to tell them to listen to my radio addresses.\n\nQ: You were one of the only people in the United States that knew so many of these people.\n\nRUBIN: Yes.\n\nQ: There were very few people that knew as many as you did.\n\nRUBIN: Yes. Then I also found Amrullah. In 1996, I went to Kunduz in Northern Afghanistan with an OSF mission. Basically our mission was to look at the situation of refugees from Tajikistan. Massoud’s representative in Paris informed Massoud that I was coming. When I was in Southern Tajikistan preparing to cross the river, somebody pulled up in a car to the UNHCR guest house where we were staying and had a fax saying, “He is waiting for you. He is sending someone to meet you.”\n\nWhen I got to Kunduz there was a person that Massoud had sent for me who was Amrullah Saleh, who later became the intelligence chief. At that time, he was twenty-three years old and deputy spokesman of the Ministry of Defense. Then I met him again in 1999, when Massoud had made him his liaison with the CIA after the bombing of the embassies in Africa. He was here in the U.S. for training, so I had lunch with him.\n\nThen I went looking for him in Kabul. It wasn’t easy because a lot of people didn’t know who he was, and he was in intelligence. People in intelligence don’t like their names and addresses to be broadcast. I tracked him down and he said, “How did you find me? I am not a public person.” And that started a relationship, which is pretty much destroyed now. He was one of my best contacts.\n\nThat also made problems for me with the U.S. government. I had several problems like this because I had my own personal relationships with the intelligence chiefs in Afghanistan and Saudi Arabia, and the CIA thought that it should manage the relationship with intelligence chiefs, not me.\n\nQ: And you were still seen as a UN figure?\n\nRUBIN: No, I was seen as an academic.\n\nQ: I think I read in one of your articles that Saleh was already talking about problems of people being arrested or fired upon by coalition forces, civilian deaths.\n\nRUBIN: Yes. My assistant aide, my deputy, Helena Malikyar and I had lunch with him in Kabul in March 2002 and he said 50 percent of his time was dealing with the mess made by U.S.-made civilian casualties.\n\nQ: So that problem was starting from the beginning?\n\nRUBIN: Oh yes. You take eighteen-twenty-year-olds out of the heartland of America and you send them down to Afghanistan and tell them this place is full of terrorists, and they can’t tell a terrorist from your average Afghan. And the intelligence they got was not very good either.\n\nQ: Had the Taliban already come back? Were they already fighting?\n\nRUBIN: No, they weren’t fighting. They were regrouping across the border. They were setting up feelers politically for three years more. In 2003, they killed the ICRC [International Committee of the Red Cross] representative and that was the sign, which they said they did because the international community was not being neutral. It was siding with their enemies.\n\nQ: At this point, were you involved in any of the meetings that ended up in the formulation of the government or the Constitution?\n\nRUBIN: Before Brahimi asked me to come monitor the first stage of elections to the Loya Jirga, the second stage elections, the emergency Loya Jirga, there were election representatives at the local level. Then they would all gather at the regional level and they would pick a small number of representatives. He asked me to come and monitor the second stage of elections in Jalalabad, for Eastern Afghanistan.\n\nI went there with Steve Smith, who is now head of the political department at UNAMA. I saw them conduct the elections. They were puzzled by it. There were people from one area, they said, “We don’t need to vote. There are two tribes in our area. They’ve each chosen their representatives, so you just take these two.” They said, “No, you have to vote.” So they voted, but they didn’t quite see why, but they were happy to have that opportunity.\n\nThen on the side, we went to the UNAMA office in Jalalabad. I met a guy from the Taliban. He wasn’t actually from the Taliban, he was the head of the Salafi group in Kunar, named Hajji Ruhullah. He had these big binders full of candidates for the Emergency Loya Jirga to give to the UN. Then Steve Smith and I went in and talked to the UN office together with the governor of Jalalabad, Hajji Abdul Qadir, who had been at Bonn before walking out claiming that Pashtuns were underrepresented. I said, “We just met this guy Ruhullah.” And he said, “He’s a terrorist.” Soon after that Ruhullah was arrested and sent to Guantanamo, where he told people that the emergency Loya Jirga was rigged. Anyone who had certain ideas got sent to Guantanamo. He was released and went back but never joined the insurgency. Haji Qadir was assassinated in Kabul in July 2002. It was never solved, and I never got the impression that anyone wanted to solve it.\n\nThen Brahimi asked me to work with the Constitutional Commission. There were three main foreign advisors that were working closely with the Constitutional Commission. There was Yash Pal Ghai, who was a Kenyan of Indian origin, a distinguished international Constitutional lawyer; Guy Carcassonne a distinguished French constitutional lawyer who has since died, unfortunately, was sent personally by President Jacques Chirac; and me. I’m not really a specialist in constitutional law, but I knew about Afghanistan and its constitutional problems, or at least I thought I did.\n\nWe at CIC commissioned study papers on different themes from various international experts. Finally, toward the end, Karzai told the Constitutional Commission to spend a couple of days with the three of us. They appointed six core people, leadership of the Constitutional Commission. Yashpal Ghai wasn’t there at that time. Carcassonne and I sat with them and went over everything.\n\nI made some judgment calls that I think damaged me later. When we were discussing the article that said something like no discrimination by religion, gender and tribe, I looked at the original and what they translated as religion was “mazhab,” which means sect. So that meant that there would be no discrimination between Shia and Sunni. I said it should be “Din” as well, because there should be no discrimination against non-Muslims. because there’s a Hindu and a Sikh community there. There were also two Jews, but that wasn’t concerning at that time. The early constitutions of Afghanistan always said Jews and Hindus had their rights to follow their religion, but there weren’t any Jews left except for these two people. The other two Jews in Kabul at that time were Carcassonne and me.\n\nThe chair of the Constitutional Commission interpreted that as that I was trying to take Islam out of the Constitution. In other words, Afghanistan wouldn’t be an Islamic state. It would treat all its citizens equally instead of treating Muslims and non-Muslims differently. What they finally compromised on was they said there would be no discrimination, period. They didn’t say by what.\n\nThat came back to bite me later at the Constitutional Loya Jirga. The head of the constitutional commission started telling people, “There’s a Jew here who wants to take Islam out of the Constitution.” I have to say, in defense of the Afghans, nobody was interested in what the guy who attacked me said. Mujaddidi, who was the chair of the Loya Jirga, dismissed it. He said something like, we used to have Jews in Afghanistan and we hope they will come back. Brahimi was concerned that this would turn into a scandal, but it didn’t.\n\nQ: The significance of it being an Islamic state, not taking Islam out—what were the key important aspects of that for them?\n\nRUBIN: In the first article, it says Afghanistan is an Islamic state.\n\nQ: That affects the legal system, Sharia law?\n\nRUBIN: What it says in Article 3 of the Afghan Constitution is that in Afghanistan, “No legislation can contradict the beliefs and provisions of the noble religion of Islam.” That is what is called a no-repugnancy clause. In other words, no laws can violate Sharia. But it does not say what other Islamic countries say, some of them do, that Sharia is a source of law or that Sharia is the only source of law. And under pressure from the United States, in the West in particular, they did not use the word “Sharia” in the Constitution. They used equivalent words like “fiqh,” Islamic jurisprudence.\n\nThe fact that that’s in Article 3, some people say that’s in Article 3 so it takes precedence over all the other articles, including basic rights. People interpret things according to their life.\n\nQ: You talked about centralization versus decentralization. How did that play out in the Constitution?\n\nRUBIN: The Constitution adopted language on centralization similar to the Constitution of 1964, except it actually made provisions for the devolving of power to localities through legislation, which was never passed. I had written some language that the local communities would partner with the government for security and Ashraf took that out. There were various proposals like the governors should be appointed from lists of people nominated by the Provincial Council. That came from the Hazaras and Uzbeks. But the commission rejected that.\n\nThere was a Pashtun resurgence at the emergency Loya Jirga. There was a very complicated compromise on ethnic relations and sectarian relations. First of all, the constitution never says that the official religion of Afghanistan is Sunni Islam or Hanafi Islam. In the past, the constitutions said “the religion of Afghanistan is Hanafi Islam.” So then the Shia felt they were not recognized. This time it just said “Islam.” However, it also said that in deciding court cases, if the Court does not find a provision of the written law then it should use the jurisprudence of the Hanafi sect except in cases involving members of Shia, in which case it can use Shia personal law to resolve disputes.\n\nQ: The Hazara ethnic group is mostly Shia?\n\nRUBIN: Yes.\n\nQ: Is that a major group?\n\nRUBIN: Yes. They’re probably the third most numerous group after Pashtun and Tajiks.\n\nQ: And not treated well over the years.\n\nRUBIN: They were enslaved and massacred at one time. They’re better off now.\n\nQ: I think one of the important things was that Karzai as the head of the government was going to appoint governors. So there was really no set-up in this government for having local grievances or local preferences bubble up into law. Is that right?\n\nRUBIN: When I spoke to Karzai on Nowruz, local commanders had taken over many of the provinces, so now many of the province governors were from that area themselves. I said maybe this could be the foundation for a new system that is more representative of the people. And he said, “No, as soon as we can we’re going to go back to the centralized system,” because his view was the state would not have any coherence because each of those people wouldn’t be serving Afghanistan. They’d be serving their own clients, not even all the people in that district, but their own faction in that district and possibly foreign countries who were infiltrating, which is a widespread point of view. There were arguments to and fro about what kind of decentralization.\n\nIf you want to make governors elected in a more decentralized manner then you have to give them some powers that would enable them to do something, which they don’t have right now. They have no budget. They can’t raise taxes. They can’t spend anything. They don’t control the police or anything. It requires a lot more reform and a whole new government model.\n\nThey got that kind of balance between the Shia and the Sunnis. The word “Afghan” originally meant Pashtun. Uzbekistan means Country of the Uzbeks. But even non-Uzbeks were citizens of Uzbekistan, or somebody called Uzbek, although not usually in Uzbekistan, only outside of Uzbekistan.\n\nThe previous Constitution said, for many decades, that every citizen of Afghanistan is an Afghan. Because Afghan also means Pashtun, some non-Pashtuns are against that and they want to be called “Afghanistanis” Or they want to change the name of the country to Khurasan, which is the older name for that area.\n\nThen there’s the question of the official language. The constitution says, “The official languages of Afghanistan are Pashtun and Dari.” The language of instruction will be Pashto and Dari, depending on what the population is, and the other languages of Afghanistan will be languages of instruction in those areas in which already the population speaks them. So you can have schools in Uzbek or something.\n\nThey had an article in the beginning of the Constitution where they are laying out the nature of the Afghan state. It says, “The State of Afghanistan is composed of––” then it lists fourteen ethnic groups. They were all recognized in the Constitution.\n\nSometimes in the past, ethnicity has been a category on your identity card, but it was not all fourteen. When they started electronic identity cards a few years later, that became controversial, because the Pashtuns wanted the word “Afghan” on there somewhere and the non-Pashtuns didn’t want to be identified as Afghan. So it was quite controversial. Do you break down the ethnic groups into small units? Because all ethnic groups have smaller units. It was very controversial.\n\nThat was about the language of instruction. But it also said the official languages are Dari and Pashto. But the national language is Pashto. It said that the language of the National Anthem must contain the words, “Allah Akbar.” It must mention all of the ethnic groups, but it must be in Pashto language. That was a compromise they got to on that.\n\nThe idea of instruction in Uzbek and other languages, there was a lot of resistance by the Pashtuns, but finally Pir Sayyid Ahmad Gailani the Sufi leader came in and said, “Put it in my daman, meaning a sort of apron of his long kurta, which was a way of showing respect.”\n\nQ: Is it his version of saying, blame me for it?\n\nRUBIN: No. Do it as a favor for me. Honor me by doing this. He has barakat. He’s kind of a holy man, so they agreed to it at that time.\n\nThere’s also the stipulation that certain official terms will be used and they are all Pashto words. The Supreme Court has to be called Stara Mahkama not Mahkama-I Ali. University has to be called Pohantun. There are a few others. That was very controversial. In fact, there are people who claimed that that Article was put in after the Constitution was approved, after they voted on it. And it became controversial because in Mazar-i Sharif, the director of the university, put up the word university in Persian, Danishgah; the minister of culture had it taken down. Amrullah told me, “Tajiks are interpreting this as meaning everybody who works for the government has to speak Pashto.” In fact, in practice the language of bureaucracy and education has been Persian, for centuries.\n\nPashtuns who are in the bureaucracy or in Kabul speak Persian, most of them. This idea of Pashtunizing the state is something that goes back to the time of Daoud Khan under the royal regime.\n\nQ: All of this was happening in Kabul when you were there?\n\nRUBIN: Yes.\n\nQ: How long did it take?\n\nRUBIN: Two or three weeks. I actually had to go home for New Year’s, so I missed the end.\n\nQ: You were working with the UN. Did you have a lot of contact with the U.S. embassy?\n\nRUBIN: I knew Zal.\n\nQ: Zal was managing it for the U.S. government?\n\nRUBIN: Yes. He was the troubleshooter. When he heard about my being the target of an anti-Semitic attack, he told me, “I heard you’re having problems.”\n\nQ: He was just trying to make sure about that? He wasn’t trying to push a particular agenda?\n\nRUBIN: I can’t be sure of that. The thing is the American agenda and the Karzai agenda were pretty congruent. I can’t say it was one or the other, but together they got what they wanted. Did the United States government have very complex and sophisticated ideas about how Afghanistan should be governed? No they did not. They wanted to be able to do military operations then justify it by saying it was a democracy.\n\nQ: We really didn’t understand how hard it would be to have a flourishing democracy.\n\nRUBIN: No. There was no audience for such arguments. I had it when I was working with Holbrooke for the 2009 election. We had a meeting in his office in the State Department. Holbrooke disliked Hamid Karzai. He wanted to get Karzai out and some Afghans did as well. He said, “Here’s our strategy. The U.S. is not going to support any candidate. We’re going to try for a level playing field to put political pressure on Karzai to improve his governance.” I said, “That’s ridiculous,” or words to that effect. I said, “You cannot choose who is ruling Afghanistan through arithmetic.”\n\nQ: Which means voting?\n\nRUBIN: Voting, yes. You can still vote, but what you need is an elite consensus behind someone that you could ratify by vote. But as you see, every presidential election in Afghanistan was settled by the United States, not by Afghan institutions because they don’t have the institutions to do that because there’s not been a census, not sufficient trust. Then there’s the issue that many Pashtuns were refugees and out of the country. Many other Pashtuns are living in Pakistan of what Pashtun Afghans consider to be an historical part of Afghanistan. So if Pashtuns are a majority of Afghanistan they think that is a result of some unfair historical results that need to be corrected.\n\nThere are all kinds of reasons like that why you cannot have a winner take all, one man, one vote presidential election in Afghanistan.\n\n***\n\nQ: It is May 19, 2023. I am continuing the conversation for our Afghanistan project with Barnett Rubin. Barney, I think last time you were talking about the development of the Constitution in Afghanistan, the first Constitution in this new era. Maybe you want to resume with that.\n\nRUBIN: This is not Afghanistan’s first Constitution. It was the Constitution of 2004. I was working with the Constitutional Commission. I was working with Guy Carcassonne giving advice to the Constitutional Commission whether they wanted it or not. At a certain point in the fall of 2003, the Constitutional Commission was called the Constitutional Review Commission. It had completed a draft and they submitted it to the palace. Then the National Security Council would review it and decide what would be submitted to the Constitutional Loya Jirga.\n\nSometime during that process, probably in November, Karzai called a cabinet meeting and he asked Brahimi to come for the discussion. I was there at the time and Brahimi said, “I’m tired of all these discussions. You go.” So I went there.\n\nWe were in the big cabinet room first, which was where President Daoud was killed by the coup makers in 1978. Then instead of having a meeting, President Karzai decided everybody should go see Zahir Shah, who was living in a different part of the compound. So they all went to see Zahir Shah.\n\nThey came back in a smaller group and they went into a side room, a small cabinet room. I was lingering behind to see if they would invite me in and I did drift in, and I thought I’d be a fly on the wall. Then Karzai saw me and he said, “Barney, sit here,” pointing at the table to sit next to him. “Tell us about the Constitution.”\n\nI gave a very undiplomatic analysis of what I thought were the weaknesses of the Constitutional draft right in front of the chairman of the Constitutional Commission. I actually humiliated him, which was a big diplomatic mistake on my part.\n\nThe top issue in the Constitution was how to structure the executive power. Originally, the issue had been presidential versus parliamentary. They were let known by the U.S. that they wouldn’t have a parliamentary system. They didn’t have any political parties so it was hard to see how they would have a parliamentary system. They wanted to have a presidential system with a prime minister, which could be a structure similar to what they had in the past, a king with a prime minister.\n\nThe big question in any such Constitution is how you structure the division of powers between the president and the prime minister. And how do you assure that, if in the event of a dispute between the two of them, there is a manner for resolving it other than having the president and the prime minister each mobilize their own militias, and shooting it out, which is how they did it in the 1990s when Rabbani was president and Hekmatyar was prime minister.\n\nThey came up with a scheme and that reflects the ethnic issue. A strong president was something the Pashtuns wanted and the non-Pashtuns, in particular the Tajiks, wanted a strong prime minister to balance the president because they figured they would have the prime ministerial position because they would dominate the parliament, because non-Pashtuns were a majority. Uzbeks and Hazaras wanted decentralization and they didn’t get anywhere. The draft said that the prime minister would convene the cabinet except in special circumstances, when the president could do it. The prime minister made appointments. And in the case of a dispute between the president and the prime minister they would then call a Special Council consisting of the chairs of the two Houses of Parliament, the chief justice, the president and the prime minister, something like that, and those five people would decide who was right, which was, in my opinion, a formula for permanent stalemate. They’d never be able to get anything done.\n\nPersonally, though no one asked me, my preference was for a president and prime minister system in which the prime minister was responsible for day-to-day running of the government and the president had the overall executive power. The president was the one in charge. But the pro-presidential faction didn’t want that at all. They just wanted a president.\n\nI explained rather vividly why I thought that model of having this unwieldy committee resolve differences between the president and the prime minister would be completely unworkable and would lead to chaos. I criticized a few other things, too. The vice-chair of the Constitutional Commission was sitting next to me and said, “Very important points.”\n\nThe people who were there were Karzai, Fahim, minister of defense, Abdullah, minister of foreign affairs, Ashraf Ghani, minister of finance, Umer Daudzai, who at that time was chief of staff, Jawed Ludin who was working as presidential spokesman. I forget who else, a few other people, the intelligence chief, Arif, at that time. It was the inner Cabinet.\n\nThe next day I was back in UNAMA. I was walking down the hall and Brahimi stopped me, and he was grinning. He said, “Karzai called me,” and he said, “I finally understand there’s a problem with the constitution.” Brahimi was pleased about that.\n\nThen they went on and adopted a system that I didn’t think was a good idea, a pure presidential system. But who cares. That’s never been publicized before, but various rumors about it greatly exaggerated my role.\n\nQ: It’s interesting they needed a guidepost to how the Constitution would work, drafted as it was, and you provided that.\n\nRUBIN: I was actually transmitting a lot of the ideas of the French Constitutional scholar, Carcassonne, who was not there at the time and didn’t have the kind of relationships that I did. He was the expert on how a mixed presidential, prime ministerial system should work, not me.\n\nQ: At that time, how did they all get along, Abdullah and Ghani, who later were at loggerheads for years?\n\nRUBIN: This was still early. Abdullah’s role at that time was that he was a great conciliator. He would manage to find consensus in the cabinet. Ghani was already knocking heads together. One guy said to me once. I was with Haji Din Mohammed, who at that time was the governor of Nangarhar. I was having dinner at Omar Zakhilwal’s house. He later became minister of finance. Haji din Mohammed said, “It’s a good thing that the finance minister only has half a stomach.” He had cancer and he had his stomach taken out. “Otherwise, he would eat the whole cabinet.”\n\nQ: He was like a Hamilton. He knew what he wanted to do.\n\nRUBIN: Yes. And he was not very diplomatic. He didn’t have very good people skills.\n\nQ: They went ahead and they had a presidential system, but they had appointed governors. They never really gave the regions a chance to develop politically?\n\nRUBIN: No. The thing is it doesn’t make any sense to have elected governors unless you endow them with the power to do something with their mandate, which they don’t have under the present system. It would involve a significant revamping of the whole fiscal system, which they didn’t have the time or inclination to pursue at that time, at that moment. The general perception of Karzai and other Pashtuns was that if you took power away from the center, the country would disintegrate.\n\nQ: At this point, all eyes were on the Constitution. Then once it was done, it didn’t go out to referendum because of the election issue?\n\nRUBIN: No. It didn’t go out to referendum because it was approved by the Loya Jirga.\n\nQ: Then all eyes then went to the election of the permanent government, the president?\n\nRUBIN: Yes. That date was given in the Constitution. That was the only election date that they actually managed to keep to. It took place in September.\n\nQ: From there, what did you do?\n\nRUBIN: By then Brahimi had left and Jean Arnault, who was also a friend of mine, became SRSG. I tried to set up an Afghan think tank. My associate director at NYU [New York University] was an Afghan, Humayun Hamidzada, who now is in Canada, whom I met in Islamabad in 1990, managed to set up some kind of a think tank funded by UNDP [United Nations Development Programme] at Kabul University. It had to do with human security. Actually, we were overtaken by events and lots of other Afghans started founding think tanks, so there were a bunch of think tanks.\n\nThen the government started working on the Afghan National Development Strategy, which was the name that they gave to something required by the World Bank and IMF [International Monetary Fund] for a certain type of aid program, which was called the Poverty Reduction Remediation Plan. There’s a technical name for it. The Japanese funded it, my consultancy with UNDP, at that time. Mrs. Ogata was the head of the Japanese Aid Agency, whom I knew when she was UN high commissioner at UNHCR. They came up with a small amount of money, a hundred thousand dollars. That was enough to pay for a partial consultancy.\n\nI went there and I worked in the office of the Afghan National Development Strategy, which was headed by Professor Ishaq Nadiri, who was an economist at New York University. His deputy was Adib Farhadi, who is now at University of South Florida. He’s from a relatively prominent family. His uncle had been the UN ambassador for President Rabbani.\n\nWe had a whole team from the World Bank and other consultants. It was also the time when a young generation of Afghans started coming back from their higher education abroad, and we started hiring a bunch of them, which made a big difference, a bunch of them.\n\nI was working with a team helping to draft that National Development Strategy. The only really interesting thing that I can remember from that was there was a section on counter narcotics. Meanwhile, I was also at CIC. We were doing a study on counter narcotics and we came out with a report called something like, The False Hope of Crop Eradication. And we argued that leading with crop eradication was counterproductive and a bad idea, especially if you’re trying to do counterinsurgency at the same time.\n\nThis was at a time when the Bush administration had decided because the Taliban profited from drugs; therefore, the way to eliminate the Taliban was to eliminate drugs. And they appointed a special representative, an anti-narcotic czar, and they appointed the former ambassador to Colombia, Bill Wood, who was a strong proponent of eradication, as the ambassador. I always had personally good relations with both of them, but we completely disagreed about this. Later I found out, Adib told me, they had called him up and said that he should not allow me to work on counternarcotics.\n\nQ: But he didn’t listen.\n\nRUBIN: My views were much more in sync with most of the Afghans. But most of the Afghans were not in a position to tell the American ambassador that he was wrong. I wasn’t in a position to do that either, but I did it anyway.\n\nQ: To summarize your position on this, you were saying, don’t lead with crop eradication?\n\nRUBIN: If you want to make counternarcotics, counterinsurgency, you have to be clear what your goal is. If you want to deprive the insurgency of resources, your problem is not the drugs, it’s the money from the drugs. So what you want to do is have a strategy that reduces the amount of money going to the insurgency, not necessarily that reduces the physical quantity of drugs.\n\nWhat eradication does is, and people who do it are overlooked. No matter how much you eradicate, you don’t eradicate everything. You just eradicate a little. If you’re really successful at eradication, what you do is you push the prices way up. That means, depending on the elasticity, the drug traffickers and the protectors of the drug traffickers actually make more money, which is what happened when the Taliban banned poppy production.\n\nI said you have to aim higher on the value chain. Support the peasants but hit higher on the value chain, not that that’s easy to do either. And that failed, too, when they tried it later. Bill Wood wanted to spray, crop spray.\n\nQ: Glyphosate, the substance in Roundup?\n\nRUBIN: Roundup. They recently found out it causes cancer. They wanted us to spray that, but Karzai stopped it, because he said that any disease the people got, the people would attribute it to poisoning by the Americans. So they never did that, which is just as well. That was a big issue for a while.\n\nQ: Robert Finn was there for two years, then Khalilzad, then Ron Neumann, and Bill Wood was there after that, then later Eikenberry? You were working on this there when Bill Wood was ambassador?\n\nRUBIN: Yes.\n\nQ: Before we leave development strategy, the strategy had to say how they were going to increase education and invest in healthcare? They had a sector-by-sector strategy?\n\nRUBIN: At the same time, I was doing something else, which was linked to this. I started a company in Afghanistan. I was taking my vacations in Provence. Every day I would drive past a distillery where they would distill lavender into essential oil and lavender water. It finally occurred to me, this is an industry that has exactly the same structure as the opium industry. You take a plant then you distill it into a high value, low volume product that is very stable and then you export it.\n\nI wrote a paper called “Flowers from Afghanistan,” in which I advocated changing over from drugs to production of essential oils and I sent this out on a list server that I had at the time. Then this Danish woman who was at UNDP picked it up. She became the wife of the Canadian ambassador. Now she’s living in Ottawa. He’s a ranking member of Parliament in Canada now. She found a French consulting firm, someone who was already working in Afghanistan, and she organized a meeting where we discussed this. They hired one guy to do a feasibility study of this. He came back, we had a meeting, and he said, “Lavender will not work because lavender has mechanized harvest so that wouldn’t work in Afghanistan. Afghanistan uses cheap labor.” He said that roses and some others could work very well, and orange blossoms.\n\nThen this consulting firm, which had offices in Paris and in Kabul, put together a meeting at the Afghan embassy in Paris, in September 2004. Based on that meeting, we started a company in which I was one of the seven shareholders, along with two French Afghans and a few other people, called Gulestan Ariana LLC.\n\nThe guy who had done the feasibility study, Mathieu Beley, he actually went to Jalalabad and started working there. Jalalabad has a huge crop of bitter oranges and it’s the flowers of bitter oranges from which the essential oil néroli is made. They have a long history of rose growing there. They have famous rose gardens there, too.\n\nWe capitalized it with our own money. We got some money from USAID [United States Agency for International Development] to train a master distiller. We sent him to Turkey where he was trained by the Robertet company, which grows roses in Turkey. He came back and then we had to make deals with the farmers to get their blossoms and we had to start planting roses. We did this in partnership with one of the local families, the Arsala family, who let us use their land and water. So we started these rose nurseries.\n\nWe didn’t manage to import the distillery we bought from Turkey in time, for the 2005 season, in the spring. Then we started producing in 2006. Some of the local Afghan engineers reversed engineered the Turkish distillery system, so we got more machinery. And they set it up in the former olive oil plant, the same place where I had gone with the Mujahideen in 1989, and started producing essential oils. Then we started blending them into"
