        "text": "Although Mtb kills more people than any other infection worldwide, an enduring enigma is that 90% of those exposed exert lifelong control of the pathogen. In seminal post-mortem studies when TB was highly prevalent in the United States, Opie showed that 30% of humans who died from other causes had viable Mtb present in the lung apices (Opie and Aronson, 1927). Therefore, in the majority of exposed individuals, a stable relationship forms between host immune cells and Mtb without disease developing. Disseminated TB disease often develops in immunocompromised individuals, such as advanced HIV infection, newborn infants or following anti-TNF-α therapy, and this observation informs the view that TB can arise as a disease of a deficient immune response to the pathogen (O'Garra et al., 2013).\n\nHowever, the commonest form of human TB, and the one that leads to transmission, is apical pulmonary disease (Elkington et al., 2011). This occurs most frequently in young adults between the ages of 20–25 with the strongest recall response to Mtb antigens, as measured by the Mantoux test (Comstock et al., 1974). Therefore, these clinical observations demonstrate that infection results in a stable symbiosis between host and pathogen in the majority of individuals, and a pronounced immune response associates with the subsequent development of infectious pulmonary disease. The recently emerging clinical phenomenon of TB rapidly developing after initiating anti-PD-1 immunotherapy (Fujita et al., 2016; Lee et al., 2016; Chu et al., 2017; Picchi et al., 2018; Jensen et al., 2018; Elkington et al., 2018; He et al., 2018; Takata et al., 2019; Barber et al., 2019; Tsai et al., 2019; van Eeden et al., 2019) further reinforces that an excessive immune response in TB can be harmful.\n\nPD-1 is expressed on T cells at the site of TB disease and PD-1 expression on circulating CD4+ T cells associates with bacterial load (Day et al., 1995). PD-1 expression is elevated in circulating CD4 T cells in TB (Shen et al., 2016) and has been proposed to limit an effective host immune response. Consequently PD-1 inhibition has been advanced as a therapeutic target to accelerate clearance of infection (Zumla et al., 2016; Shen et al., 2016; Jurado et al., 2008; Singh et al., 2013; Suarez et al., 2019; Jiang et al., 2014). However, from an evolutionary perspective, PD-1 is proposed to limit immunopathology in the face of chronic antigenic stimulation (Sharpe and Pauken, 2018). Therefore, it is equally plausible, and indeed perhaps more logical, that PD-1/PD-L1 pathway up-regulation in TB is a physiologically appropriate response to the persistent pathogen. We found that hypoxia further up-regulated the PD-1/PD-L1/2 axis, consistent with hypoxia increasing expression in cancer (Noman et al., 2014), and TB lesions are hypoxic both in model animals and human lesions (Belton et al., 2016; Via et al., 2008). Analysis of the effect of hypoxia is complicated that both host and pathogen physiology are altered, with hypoxia causing reduced Mtb growth (Devasundaram et al., 2016; Ortega et al., 2014; Eoh and Rhee, 2013) but also causing diverse host physiological changes. PD-1 may be particularly important in limiting excessive inflammation and pathology in conditions of low oxygen tension. TB reactivation following immune checkpoint blockade, and the extreme susceptibility of PD-1 deficient mice to Mtb infection (Lázár-Molnár et al., 2010; Barber et al., 2011), would support such a regulatory role, even though it runs counter to widely advanced disease paradigms.\n\nOur work further highlights the double-edged sword of the host immune response in TB (Ehlers, 1999). TNF-α is clearly essential to an effective host immune response to TB, as disease frequently develops after treatment with anti-TNF-α antibodies (Keane et al., 2001), and TNF-α inhibits Mtb growth in zebrafish macrophages (Clay et al., 2008) and human alveolar macrophages (Hirsch et al., 1994). However, excessive TNF-α is also associated with poor outcomes in TB. In human cells, an excess of TNF-α can increase Mtb growth (Byrd, 1997; Engele et al., 2002), consistent with our observations. In patients with active TB, TNF-α expression by Mtb-specific T cells is increased (Harari et al., 2011; Tebruegge et al., 2015) and TNF-α associates with more severe radiological findings (Casarini et al., 1999; Tsao et al., 2000). In diverse model systems, excessive TNF-α has been shown to cause harmful inflammation (Bekker et al., 2000; Taylor et al., 2005; Tsenova et al., 1999; Roca and Ramakrishnan, 2013; Tzelepis et al., 2018), consistent with TNF-α exerting a bell-shaped effect on host immunity, with either deficit or excess detrimental. Similarly, we report a deleterious effect of additional GM-CSF, in contrast to GM-CSF improving control of Mtb growth in murine macrophages (Rothchild et al., 2014). This suggests that cytokine responses are highly dose and context dependent, potentially with each demonstrating non-linear responses leading to a complex matrix of what may denote the optimal cytokine profile for Mtb control. Consistent with our findings, in the one patient that developed TB on anti-PD-1 treatment where longitudinal samples are available, there was a spike in PPD-specific TNF-α expressing cells prior to with the development of active TB (Barber et al., 2019), consistent with PD-1 acting as a regulator of TNF-α expression in TB. Taken together, these findings demonstrate a harmful effect of excessive TNF-α in TB.\n\nWe found that multiple cytokines and chemokines were increased after PD-1 inhibition, and therefore events in humans are likely to be more complex than TNF-α excess alone. The augmented inflammation may have multiple harmful effects, such as recruitment of excessive inflammatory cells and destruction of the extracellular matrix (Cambier et al., 2017; Al Shammari et al., 2015; Mishra et al., 2017), which favour Mtb growth. In the mouse model of TB, one key role of PD-1 is to limit IFN-γ production (Sakai et al., 2016), and we have shown that excess IFN-γ also accelerates Mtb growth in microspheres (Tezera et al., 2017a). We did not show an effect of TNF-α on cell survival, although TNF-α has been reported to increase macrophage necrosis in the zebrafish model, via a mitochondrial-lysosomal-endoplasmic reticulum circuit (Roca and Ramakrishnan, 2013; Roca et al., 2019). The effect of PD-1 inhibition on macrophage polarisation and survival warrants further investigation, as this is likely to be one determinant of outcome (Lerner et al., 2017; Cronan et al., 2016).\n\nAs in all in vitro systems, the bioelectrospray model has limitations (Elkington et al., 2019). For example, it does not permit the ingress of new inflammatory cells, and therefore can only be used to investigate the early events resulting from anti-PD-1 treatment, and not the recruitment of inflammatory cells by increased chemokine secretion. In addition, although it permits longer analysis of the host-pathogen interaction than other human primary cell culture systems, the 3 week standard experiment remains shorter than human infection, and so it models early events. We have not yet characterised which cells produce TNF-α, nor the wider phenotypic changes that result from inhibition of the PD-1 axis. The optimal approach would be to integrate single cell RNAseq to the analysis pipeline, so the phenotype of different cells can be comprehensively analysed. As microspheres can be readily dissolved by incubation in EDTA to release the cells, the system is suited for this technical development.\n\nThe common side effects of anti-PD-1 treatment in patients are termed immune related Adverse Events (irAEs), which are autoimmune in nature (Postow et al., 2018). We have proposed that an autoimmune process may exacerbate pathology in TB (Elkington et al., 2016), and others have suggested that a loss of tolerance underlies progression to active TB (Divangahi et al., 2018; Olive and Sassetti, 2018). The common theme is that an excessive response to antigens, whether host or pathogen-derived, can drive disease in TB and our findings further support this conclusion. PD-1 may act to fine tune the balance between pro- and anti-inflammatory responses necessary to control infection without causing pathology. Notably, immune related adverse events to immune checkpoint inhibitors may be treated with anti-TNF-α antibodies (Postow et al., 2018), suggesting TNF-α may be the primary driver of both autoimmunity and TB pathology after PD-1 treatment."
