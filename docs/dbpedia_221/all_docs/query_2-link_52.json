        "text": "By Ashley Lane\n\nSince the 1979 revolution, Iran has built a network of proxies across the Middle East. As of 2022, Tehran had allies among more than a dozen major militias, some with their own political parties, that challenged local and neighboring governments. Iran’s Revolutionary Guards and the elite Qods Force provided arms, training and financial support to militias and political movements in at least six countries: Bahrain, Iraq, Lebanon, the Palestinian Territories, Syria and Yemen.\n\nThe United States has struggled to deal with Iran’s proxies short of military confrontation. Since 1984, and across six presidencies, the United States has sanctioned Iran’s extensive network of militia proxies in the Middle East to contain Tehran’s regional influence. The Trump administration increased the pace and scope of punitive economic measures between 2017 and 2021. But sanctions have never fully succeeded. In 2020, the State Department estimated that Iran gave Hezbollah $700 million a year. In the past, Tehran had historically given $100 million annually to Palestinian groups, including Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad.\n\nThe Reagan administration first designated Iran a State Sponsor of Terrorism in 1984, but the Clinton administration was the first to sanction Iran’s proxies. In 1995, the United States sanctioned Hezbollah, a Shiite militia and political movement in Lebanon, Hamas, a Sunni militia and political movement in the Palestinian territories, and Palestinian Islamic Jihad, also a Sunni militia in the Palestinian territories.\n\nBetween 1995 and 2022, five administrations – Clinton, Bush, Obama, Trump and Biden – sanctioned 11 Iranian proxy groups in five countries. They also sanctioned 89 leaders* from 13 groups supported by Tehran.\n\nClinton administration (1993 – 2001): three groups (Hezbollah, Hamas, Palestinian Islamic Jihad) and six leaders\n\nGeorge W. Bush administration (2001 – 2009): three groups (Hezbollah, Hamas, Palestinian Islamic Jihad) and 14 leaders\n\nObama administration (2009 – 2017): one group (Kataib Hezbollah) and 34 leaders\n\nTrump administration (2017 – 2021): six groups (Ansar Allah, Asaib Ahl al Haq, Harakat Hezbollah al Nujaba, Zaynabiyoun Brigade, Fatemiyoun Division, Al Ashtar Brigades, Saraya al Mukhtar) and 32 leaders.\n\nBiden administration (2021 – ): removed designation from one group (Ansar Allah) and sanctioned three leaders.\n\nBetween 2017 and 2020, the Trump administration imposed 40 percent of all those sanctions. It designated seven groups and 32 leaders tied to Iran. One of President Trump’s top foreign policy goals was to limit Tehran’s regional influence and support for militant groups across the Middle East. “From Lebanon to Iraq to Yemen, Iran funds, arms, and trains terrorists, militias, and other extremist groups that spread destruction and chaos across the region,” he said in May 2017. “For decades, Iran has fueled the fires of sectarian conflict and terror.”\n\nThe Trump administration “has been relentless in its use of sanctions tools to increase pressure on the Iranian regime, not only for its support of terrorism around the world, but for its manifest human rights violations at home,” Nathan Sales, the State Department's coordinator for counterterrorism, told reporters in November 2020. “We remain committed to holding the regime accountable for the bloodshed that they have committed across the world in places like South America, in Europe, in Syria, in Lebanon, in Yemen, and elsewhere.”\n\nThe United States has the power to impose punitive economic sanctions either through presidential executive orders or laws passed by Congress.\n\nThree presidents – Clinton, Bush and Obama – issued executive orders that empowered them to sanction Iranian proxies. They include:\n\nUnder Executive Order 12947 signed by President Clinton in 1995, the Treasury or State Departments could designate foreign individuals or organizations as Specially Designated Terrorists for disrupting the Middle East peace process. Treasury and State’s powers to sanction terrorist groups were vastly expanded by the Immigration and Nationality Act in 1997 and Executive Order 13224 in 2001. President Trump officially terminated Executive Order 12947 in 2019 and brought these designations under Executive Order 13224.\n\nUnder Executive Order 13224 signed by President Bush in 2001, the Treasury or State Departments can designate foreign individuals or organizations for committing, or pose a risk of committing, acts of terrorism that threaten U.S. interests or national security. It can also designate individuals, financiers and front companies as Specially Designated Global Terrorists for providing support to terrorist groups. A designation imposes sanctions, which prevents these individuals and entities from engaging in transactions with individuals or companies in the United States. It also blocks any assets that they have in the United States. Its goal is to disrupt terrorist finance networks and increase public awareness of individuals and groups connected to terrorism.\n\nUnder Executive Order 13438 signed by President Bush in 2007, the Treasury or State Departments can designate individuals or entities that have committed, or pose a risk of committing, violence that threatens the peace and stability of Iraq. Its goal is to disrupt support for terrorists and insurgent groups in Iraq.\n\nUnder Executive Order 13752 signed by President Obama in 2011, the Treasury or State Departments can designate individuals and entities that are responsible for human rights abuses and repression in Syria. The IRGC-Qods Force and its commanders are sanctioned under this order.\n\nUnder Executive Order 13611 signed by President Obama in 2012, the Treasury or State Departments can designate individuals and entities that threaten the peace, security and stability of Yemen. Its goal is to disrupt support for individuals and groups threatening the peace and stability of Yemen.\n\nOn September 10, 2019, President Trump amended Executive Order 13224. His order superseded older authorities and included individuals and entities who were previously sanctioned under Executive Order 12947.\n\nCongress has passed two laws to sanction Iranian proxies:\n\nUnder Section 219 of the Immigration and Nationality Act, passed by Congress in 1997, the State Department can designate organizations as Foreign Terrorist Organizations (FTOs) for engaging in terrorist activities that threaten U.S. national security or interests. An FTO designation means that these groups cannot engage in transactions with individuals or companies in the United States and any assets they have in the United States are blocked. It also imposes immigration restrictions on organization members. Its goal is to limit terrorist organizations’ financial resources and increase public awareness.\n\nThe Hezbollah International Financing Prevention Act, passed by Congress in 2015, and the Hezbollah International Financing Prevention Amendments Act, passed by Congress in 2018, exclude banks that conduct transactions with Hezbollah from the U.S. financial system. The 2018 amendment allows the United States to sanction foreign entities that finance or arm Hezbollah.\n\nSince the mid-1990s, U.S. sanctions have been an important tool in disrupting terrorist financial networks, denying access to U.S. banks and deterring funders. But U.S. sanctions have not significantly impacted Iran’s relationships with its proxies. “Financial sanctions can’t affect many of the most important aspects of Iran’s proxy relationships, including the training, safe havens, and transfers of weapons and technology that it provides,” Ariane Tabatabai and Colin Clarke wrote in 2019. The following is a rundown of U.S. sanctions on Iranian proxies by country.\n\nLebanon\n\nHezbollah (or Party of God)\n\nHezbollah is a Shiite movement that was Iran’s first proxy in the Middle East. It has a militia founded in the early 1980s, with military and financial support from the Revolutionary Guards, and a political party, which first ran for office in 1992 after it emerged from the underground. In the 1980s, it carried out several suicide bombings against U.S. personnel and facilities in Lebanon and seized dozens of foreign hostages, including more than a dozen Americans. By 2020, Hezbollah had become the world’s most heavily armed non-state actor, with at least 130,000 rockets and missiles, according to the Center for Strategic and International Studies. It also held powerful positions in Lebanon’s government and economic sector.\n\n“Hezbollah’s budget, everything it eats and drinks, its weapons and rockets, comes from the Islamic Republic of Iran,” Hezbollah Secretary General Hassan Nasrallah said in 2016. In 2018, the Treasury Department estimated that Tehran provided Hezbollah with more than $700 million annually. In 2020, Iranian funding decreased due to U.S. sanctions, declining oil prices and the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, according to Matthew Levitt of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy.\n\nIn 1995, the Clinton administration sanctioned Hezbollah and Secretary General Hassan Nasrallah for disrupting the Middle East peace process. It designated Hezbollah a Foreign Terrorist Organization in 1997. In 2001, the Bush administration designated it a Specially Designated Global Terrorist.\n\nBetween 1995 and 2020, the United States sanctioned a total of 44 Hezbollah leaders. In 2020, the Treasury Department charged Hezbollah’s senior leadership with “creating and implementing the terrorist organization’s destabilizing and violent agenda” against U.S. interests and partners around the world. Yet Hezbollah maintains global influence and remains “one of our nation’s most critical national security challenges,” Marshall Billingslea, Assistant Secretary for Terrorist Financing, said in 2019.\n\nThe Treasury and State Departments have sanctioned the following Hezbollah leaders:\n\nSecretary General Hassan Nasrallah: In 1995, for threatening to disrupt the Middle East peace process, in 2012, for overseeing Hezbollah’s support for Syria’s Assad regime, and in 2018, for acting on behalf of Hezbollah as its leader.\n\nGrand Ayatollah Muhammad Hussein Fadlallah: In 1995, for serving as a leading ideological figure of Hezbollah.\n\nIslamic Jihad Organization Head Imad FayezMughniyah: In 2001, for committing, or posing a significant risk of committing, acts of terrorism that threaten U.S. interests or national security.

With some 20,000 members, it became one of the largest militias in the PMF, yet it maintained operational ties with Tehran. “It is no secret that Iran supports all the militias in this area and we are obviously one of them,” Qais al Khazali, the group’s leader, said in 2015.\n\nIn January 2020, the State Department designated Asaib Ahl al Haq a Foreign Terrorist Organization.
