        "text": "The most well-rounded fictional characters behave pretty much as we do in real life: between whatever extraordinary episodes make them worthy of their narrative, they eat, sleep, love and, of course, read.\n\nThe point at which things start getting complicated, though, is when the made-up books that fictional characters write and read make the leap through \"the fourth wall\" into the real world. And they're doing so with increasing frequency.\n\nThe latest book-within-a-book to make it on to our shelves will be the adventures of Ruby Redfort. Ruby is a children's book character who up until now has only appeared within the pages of Clarice Bean, the popular series created by Lauren Child. According to HarperCollins, Child has been \"authorised\" by Ruby Redfort's creator Patricia F Maplin Stacey – herself, of course, a Child creation – to write and relaunch Ruby's adventures in this corner of reality.\n\nAnd Child is by no means the first author to travel down this twisty, metatextual route. Those Harry Potter fans hungry for anything that would propel them deeper into the boy wizard's universe snapped up copies of three books that made the leap from JK Rowling's world into our own. The most recent offering, The Tales of the Beedle Bard (which appeared in the Potter books as a volume of fairytales), followed on the heels of two Potterverse reference books: Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, and Quidditch Through the Ages, a kind of Wisden for Hogwarts's favourite team sport. All three raised huge amounts of money for very real charities, it should be noted. And perhaps one of the best-realised examples is by Steve Aylett, whose biography of fictional writer Jeff Lint has become a modern cult classic. Among Lint's work was the surreal comic book The Caterer, which Aylett lovingly produced as a real, US-format comic book for sale, rendered in pitch-perfect 70s style, even down to the colour separation printing and Comics Code Authority stamp on the cover.\n\nOccasionally, fictional authors find a life of their own independent of their original creators. Kurt Vonnegut's character Kilgore Trout was famous in his own fictional world for writing the novel Venus on the Half Shell. Trout was apparently based on an SF-writing contemporary of Vonnegut's, the equally fishily monikered Theodore Sturgeon, but it fell to yet another SF luminary, the recently deceased Philip José Farmer, to actually pen Venus on the Half Shell, which was released under Trout's byline in 1975.\n\nSometimes, though, books make the transition without the approval of the original author, as happened with Hamster Huey & the Gooey Kablooie, the favourite bedtime story of popular newspaper-strip character Calvin, of Calvin and Hobbes fame. Real-life creator Bill Watterson had always intended it to remain a background piece, but that didn't stop someone bringing it out under the name Mabel Barr, which is close to Watterson's fictional writer Mabel Syrup, but just about different enough, although there was speculation that the whole thing was a hoax and the book didn't actually exist at all.\n\nPerhaps, in these recessionary times, we might be seeing a lot more of this sort of thing, as flesh and blood writers are asked to don the masks of their own characters to create a whole new line of books. After all, fictional writers must be far easier to deal with than real-life ones, and they don't demand big advances."
