        "text": "After years of kinda sorta wanting to read it, but always being skeptical, I bought Venus on the Half Shell — the book Philip Jose Farmer wrote under the pseudonym of Kurt Vonnegut’s pulp fiction alter-ego, Kilgore Trout — for three dollars. (Cover images here. I have the really filthy one.) According to the interview quoted here, Farmer intended to write a whole series of these, but Vonnegut stopped him after the first one.\n\nThe entire book revolves around what many people would say is the central question of human experience: “Why are we born to suffer and die?”* It’s a subject I never get tired of.\n\nNow, Venus on the Half Shell is no classic. But it’s such a bizarre merging of fiction and metafiction that it’s really worth reading, particularly for any Vonnegut completist — the style is such an intentionally perfect-but-imperfect approximation of Vonnegut’s that it’s basically the closest you’ll ever get to reading a book from an alternate reality.\n\nIt’s a rather strange literary experience."
