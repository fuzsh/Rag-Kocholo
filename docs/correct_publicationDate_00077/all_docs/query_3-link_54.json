Jr., \"Collector the First: Major Geoffrey Hopkinton-Smith (1857-1943)\"\n\nThe (fictional) Lovecraft collector David Park Boynton in Mexico in 1943 meets a reclusive collector and former correspondent with HPL. The Major's collection includes proof that the underground civilization of \"The Mound\" is based on fact; he also owns the ring mentioned in the supposedly-also-factual \"Transition of Juan Romero\" (then still unknown; it was first published in 1944). The ring has powers that protect him from attack by the \"Mound\" beings, who realize that he Knows Too Much. When he loses the ring, he and his home and collection are destroyed in an earthquake.\n\nEODapa August 1979-October 1981 [http://www.epberglund.com/RGttCM/chrono04.htm]\n\nTales of the Lovecraft Collectors, 1989, Moshassuck Press [edition of 25]\n\nTales of the Lovecraft Collectors, November 1995, Necronomicon Press 0-940884-80-1 (pp.9-18) [revised]\n\nFaig, Kenneth W., Jr. \"Collector the Second: Dean Alan Edgerton-Noble (1876-1959)\"\n\nPhilip David Boynton describes a 1930 visit to the mostly-drowned city of Dunwich (the real one, in England). A local Dean knows of HPL, and of one of HPL's ancestors who was \"a libertine and a swindler, and a mage and a Druid priest.\" HPL's father, Winfield Lovecraft, is thought to have inherited the occult writings of that ancestor, Thomas Luckcraft; Winfield may also have been Jack the Ripper, carrying out occult rituals.\n\nEODapa August 1979-October 1981 [http://www.epberglund.com/RGttCM/chrono04.htm]\n\nTales of the Lovecraft Collectors, 1989, Moshassuck Press [edition of 25]\n\nTales of the Lovecraft Collectors, November 1995, Necronomicon Press 0-940884-80-1 (pp.19-30) [revised]\n\nFalconer, Stuart, \"Fugue and Variations\"\n\nThe frame is the story of a librarian who is working with notes and books from his grandfather's private library. There is a world in which Mozart did not die in 1791, but rather in 1825. Near the end of his life, he visited the Shelleys in Switzerland and told them a \"ghost\" story that served as the basis for Mary's novel. However, his attempted collaboration with Percy Bysshe Shelley on an opera Prometheus comes to naught and only notes and sketches are left. These serve as the beginnings of Richard Wagner's opera Frankenstein, written between 1871-74, and first performed in 1879. It is not often performed because the soprano must take the triple roles of Mary Shelley, another Englishwoman, and the bride of the monster.\n\nInterzone 85, July 1994 (pp.46-57)\n\nFanthorpe, R. Lionel, \"Curse of the Khan\"\n\nR. Lionel Fanthorpe, supernatural writer, is invited to Genghis Khan to Black Island, south-east of Truro. His curiosity piqued, he goes. Gathered on the island are also the supernatural, fantasy, and science fiction writers Oben Lerteth, Peter O'Flinn, Bron Fane, and Neil Balfort. Soon joining them are the writers Elton T. Neef and Rene Rolant. [All these people are pseudonyms of R. Lionel Fanthorpe.] They have been gathered by an ancient and immortal alien who has taken the form of Genghis Khan to relieve his boredom. The Khan creates seven monsters to fight the seven writers and destroy them for his amusement. However, because of their innate intelligence and specific skills, the writers are triumphant.\n\nBadger Supernatural Series 105, 1966\n\nDown the Badger Hole. R.

The premise originally presented is that all of mankind (over five years of age) from 2,000,000 B.C. to 2008 A.D. (when the Arcturians regretfully wiped out almost all human life) have been resurrected in a river valley about 10 million miles long. It is believed that descendants of the surviving humans (in about 7000 A.D.) did this. The Ethicals claim this was done to give each person a chance for personal improvement. When people die, they are resurrected once again along the River. Since everyone is there, anyone can be a character in the story. The main thrust of the series is the humans' attempts to find out what happened and why. The solution may lie at the north pole. As the series progresses it becomes clear that some of this information is false.\n\n-----To Your Scattered Bodies Go\n\nRichard Francis Burton is the viewpoint. One of the people he meets is Paul Jairus Frigate, a science fiction author (see volume 3) who is, in some ways, a projection of Philip José Farmerthey were both born in 1918, grew up in Peoria, have the same initials, and write science fiction.

The industrial base left behind has begun work on blimps to continue exploration. In this book Paul Jairus Frigate discusses science fiction with Richard Burton. Frigate admits he wrote SF. Resurrections of the Riverworld inhabitants cease. It is shown that one Frigate is an Agent of the Ethicals. The other Frigate travels upriver with Tom Mix and Jack London. Cyrano makes a major appearance here also. Now the presentation is that Riverworld is a vast anthropological experiment that will be abandoned when the Ethicals have the information they need; all humans will be left to die.\n\nWorlds of Tomorrow 3:5 January 1966 (pp.134-162) [\"Riverworld\"] part used in The Dark Design1977\n\nBerkley 03831-9, July 1978\n\nScience Fiction Book Club 26799, November 1980\n\n-----The Magic Labyrinth\n\nThe Earthly Frigate makes his appearance here once again as does Sam Clemens.\n\nBerkley-Putnam, 1980\n\nScience Fiction Book Club 2585, November 1980\n\n-----Gods of Riverworld\n\nWherein it is revealed that Frigate wrote a mystery story The Knave of Hearts in which Alice Liddell Hargreaves (at age 30) was the amateur detective.

Lue Pencill is editor of Future Fiction. The sales of his magazine and his finances are driving him to suicide. The final straw is the manuscript of The Core, a superb novel of scientifiction by Prof. John S. Mith; he does not have the money to pay for it (3¢/word). The time traveler appears and stops the suicide and gives Pencill future copies of the magazine with circulation figures of 200,000. [Such a circulation figure would cheer up any SF editor in our present.] There is an alternate ending by Mohammed Ulysses Socrates Fips (Hugo Gernsback) in which Mith tells Pencill he can save money by paying his authors half the usual rate since they will not actually have to spend time writing the stories he already has in the future magazines. The style is so similar to the main story that one wonders if A. Fedor might not also be Gernsback.\n\nWonder Stories 6:3 August 1934 (pp.294-304)\n\nFeist, Raymond E. joint author with Mike Resnick, et al.\n\nFeeley, Gregory, \"Scatchophily\"\n\nSam Beckett, editor of Astounding and Unknown, along with four of the Futurians is waiting for the arrival of the world's greatest fantasy writerJames Joyce.
