        "text": "In 1973, the science-fiction writer Philip José Farmer, who has died aged 91, published Venus on the Half-Shell, under the name Kilgore Trout. Trout was a recurring character in Kurt Vonnegut's novels, living in poverty while selling stories to porn magazines. Vonnegut's model was the writer Theodore Sturgeon, but the description would also have fitted Farmer. Blessed with an overflowing and playful imagination, he faced adversity in finding a steady outlet, producing 75 novels for 25 different publishers. Despite setbacks, he had a boundless creative energy allied to a friendly openness, which made him a favourite both of his fellow writers and the fraternity of science-fiction fandom.\n\nFarmer introduced an adult sexuality into a genre previously pitched to adolescents, and exploiting sci-fi's flexibility, indulged his gift for literary pastiche, best seen in stories such as The Jungle Rot Kid on the Nod, first published in 1968, a Tarzan story written as if by William Burroughs rather than Edgar Rice Burroughs.\n\nThis mix of sex, pulp and literature was first showcased in a series of novels published in 1968 and 1969 by a pornographer, Essex House. But it reached a wider audience with the Wold Newton series, including Tarzan Alive (1972) and Doc Savage: His Apocalyptic Life (1973). These pastiches of heroes of popular literature, ranging from Tarzan to Phileas Fogg and Melville's Ishmael, were linked by the assumption that the meteorite that landed in the Yorkshire village of Wold Newton in 1795 was radioactive, creating genetic mutations. His best-known work, the Riverworld series, in which everyone who has ever lived is resurrected along the banks of the million-mile river, allowed Farmer to play with real characters, among them the explorer Sir Richard Burton and Mark Twain.\n\nBy the time of the \"new wave\" of speculative fiction in the 1960s, Farmer was nearly 50, but his story, Riders of the Purple Wage, in Harlan Ellison's seminal 1967 anthology Dangerous Visions, won him a second Hugo award. The first had come for his debut sci-fi story, The Lovers. Its straightforward approach to sex between humans and aliens \"nauseated\" the field's leading editor, John W Campbell, who rejected it but, when published in Startling Stories, it won Farmer the 1953 Hugo as best newcomer. Farmer delivered a talk entitled Science Fiction and the Kinsey Report at the World SF Convention when he accepted the award. The story had such a profound effect on the field that eight years later Robert Heinlein dedicated Stranger in a Strange Land, which explores similar themes, to him.\n\nFarmer had quit his job in a steel mill to write full time. His first novel, Owe for the Flesh - which introduced the Riverworld concept - won a $4,000 prize sponsored by Shasta, a specialist sci-fi publisher. But the publisher embezzled Farmer's paperback advance, intended to fund the prize and hardcover publication, to publish another book, which flopped. The novel never appeared, and Farmer lost his house and was forced to go back to work.\n\nBorn in Terre Haute, Indiana, Farmer grew up in Peoria, Illinois, a city often cited as the quintessence of middle America. His interest in science fiction began aged six, when he saw a zeppelin passing overhead. After excelling at sport in high school, he entered the University of Missouri to study journalism in 1936, but left when his father's business collapsed, and took a job repairing power lines. Three years later he received a writing scholarship to local Bradley University. In 1941, he returned to Missouri, to study Greek, but went back to Peoria to elope with Elizabeth Andre. He then joined the army air corps, but failed flight school soon after Pearl Harbor. He took a job at a steel mill in Peoria while waiting to be drafted and worked there for 11 years.\n\nIn 1949 he sold his first story, to Adventure magazine, and the following year finally received his degree from Bradley. After the collapse of the Shasta prize, he began another career as a technical writer for General Electric in Syracuse, New York. The family moved to Arizona and then California as he wrote for aerospace companies including Motorola and McDonnell-Douglas, while producing sci-fi stories, including a series about a priest, in which he approached religious cosmology. In 1966 he expanded one of his Father John Carmody stories into the novel Night of Light. It was here Jimi Hendrix first encountered the phrase \"purple haze\".\n\nFarmer's first published sci-fi novel, The Green Odyssey, appeared in 1957. His second, Flesh (1960), again approached sexual themes. The Lovers, expanded to novel length, appeared the following year. Fire in the Night (1962), about an interracial affair, drew on Farmer's years in the steel mills. In 1965, The Maker of Universes introduced his World of Tiers series, which features parallel universes constructed by a far-advanced society. In the same year To Your Scattered Bodies Go, rewritten from the lost Riverworld manuscript of Owe for the Flesh, was serialised. When it finally appeared in book form, it won Farmer his third Hugo, in 1972.\n\nBy then he had been made redundant by McDonnell-Douglas, and moved back to Peoria, finally a full-time writer. He successfully expanded various series, using parody and pastiche and, in 1991, published the first original Doc Savage novel to appear since the death of the pulps, followed in 1999 by an original Tarzan novel. His last solo novel, Up from the Bottomless Pit (2005), dealing with an oil-spill disaster, was serialised in Farmerphile, a fanzine devoted to his work. In 2001 he received the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America grand master prize and a World Fantasy lifetime achievement award.\n\nIn his introduction to a \"best-of\" anthology published in 2006, Joe Lansdale called Farmer \"the man with the electric brain\", and the \"most underrated SF writer of all time\".\n\nHe is survived by his wife, a son and a daughter."
