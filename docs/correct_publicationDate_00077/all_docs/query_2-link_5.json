For those who have, my question this evening is regarding the end of the book..\n\nA giant cockroach smoking a blunt answers the meaning of life? I actually had the pleasure of knowing Kurt... Back in college, I \"babysat\" his Collins Avenue condo while he was vacationing. He was an extraordinary man. Beyond Brilliant. I never made the effort to get into his thoughts and ask him about this wonderful book as well as Sirens of Titan, another diamond in literature... However, based on the talks I did have the honor to engage with, I would venture to say that he saw himself as that giant cockroach... Waiting, always waiting, always hoping, someone would ask him that one deeply pressing question / riddle....\n\nThe end of the book, \"Why Not?\" as the answer to the questions, \"Why are put on this earth simply to suffer and die?\" brings a chuckle sure, but also delves into a nihilistic view of perhaps just how meaningless life is... And why we create meaning out of the meaningless, simply to not feel alone...\n\nIDK... I just, don't know... Do you?\n\nxo, philosophygirl\n\nThe end of the book, \"Why Not?\" as the answer to the questions, \"Why are put on this earth simply to suffer and die?\" brings a chuckle sure, but also delves into a nihilistic view of perhaps just how meaningless life is...

Do you?\n\nxo, philosophygirl\n\nV survived WWII and its horror seemed to pursue him through life; however, his nihilism I suspect had genesis in childhood.\n\nActually Venus on the Half Shell was written by Philip Jose Farmer in the style of Kurt Vonnegut Jnr. under the pseudonym Kilgore Trout. I read it when first published but like you assumed it was by KVJ until years later. Ive read most if not all of Kurt's novels and enjoyed them - particularly Slaughterhouse 5 where I believe the fictional SciFi writer Trout is first mentioned or was it God Bless You Mr Rosewater- as a wonderful piece of irony Trout is the unread Master of SciFi - read Vonnegut to find out why?\n\nSlaughterhouse 5 covers his time as a prisoner in WW2 Dresden clearly a massively traumatic experience perhaps leading to post traumatic stress disorder and his lifelong struggle with depression?\n\nWhile Slaughterhouse 5 is his most popular work, I find Sirens of Titan to be his most influential work. Eerily, much of what he disguised in science fiction is a reality today... And if we proceed with his mind set in this novel, we will want to make sure that society has some sort of Ethics Council as a helicopter to advances... https://books.google.com/books/abou...urce=kp_read_button&hl=en#v=onepage&q&f=false\n\nThe end of the book, \"Why Not?\" as the answer to the questions, \"Why are put on this earth simply to suffer and die?\" brings a chuckle sure, but also delves into a nihilistic view of perhaps just how meaningless life is...
