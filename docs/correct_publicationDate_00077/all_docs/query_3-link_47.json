Contributor to Visual Encyclopedia of Science Fiction. Contributor of short stories to Adventure, Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction, Startling Stories, and other magazines.\n\nFarmer's work has been translated into twenty-one languages and published in over forty countries.\n\nADAPTATIONS: The film rights to the \"Riverworld\" series, including To Your Scattered Bodies Go, The Fabulous Riverboat, The Dark Design, The Magic Labyrinth, and Gods of Riverworld, were sold to Walt Disney Productions, 1990.\n\nSIDELIGHTS: Philip José Farmer is a prolific science-fiction writer whose success is based on his deft mixture of three primary components, \"religion, sex, and violence,\" in each of his many works, according to Franz Rottensteiner in Science-Fiction Studies. In addition, he is often credited with introducing the first mature depiction of humanalien sexual encounters into the genre with his 1961 book, The Lovers. Both Farmer's inclusion of the sex act itself within his fiction and the fact that it involved an alien being triggered off a controversy within science-fiction circles. Despite the initial reaction, The Lovers stands as an historically important work in the field.\n\nAlthough Farmer is sometimes dismissed as a writer of formula fiction whose least-successful works are written \"hastily, sometimes downright sloppily,\" as reviewer Leslie A. Fiedler charged in the Los Angeles Times, admirers find his exploration of timeless themes within an action-oriented adventure plot a winning combination. Furthermore, \"the number, richness, and complexity of Farmer's series,\" according to Thomas L. Wymer in the Dictionary of Literary Biography, \"can lay claim to uniqueness.\" In The Universe Makers, Donald A. Wollheim called Farmer's work \"veritable fireworks of new concepts in biology and fantasy lands.\" In Science Fiction Chronicle Paul Levinson was quoted as noting: since The Lovers appeared in 1952, Farmer has \"pioneered the exploration of critical human relations and dimensions in science fiction and inspired a generation of writers, from Samuel R. Delany to Jonathan Lethem.\"\n\nFarmer's talent for new concepts is given full rein in his \"Riverworld\" series, which Roland Green of Booklist called \"one of the largest, most ambitious, and least conventional works of modern science fiction.\" The series concerns the planet Riverworld, a single, million-mile river valley into which the entire human race is reincarnated at the same time. A few of the reborn humans, including such diverse characters as Mark Twain, Cyrano de Bergerac, and Hermann Göring, search for the headwaters of the River in the hope that it may hold the answer to their reincarnation.\n\nFarmer began the \"Riverworld\" series in 1952 when he entered a writing contest sponsored by two publishing companies. He won the contest with his first \"River-world\" novel but, before he collected his $4,000 prize, one of the publishers went bankrupt, taking his prize money with it. Worse, Farmer lost the rights to his book for many years. It wasn't until the late 1960s that he revived the \"Riverworld\" idea. He wrote a series of novelettes for magazine publication that contained \"very little of the original novel, aside from the basic concept,\" as Farmer stated in Dream Makers: The Uncommon People Who Write Science Fiction. When these novelettes were sspublished together as a novel, the result was the Hugo Award-winning To Your Scattered Bodies Go, and the \"Riverworld\" series was on its way.\n\nAs Peter Stoler wrote in Time, \"the auspicious opening\" of Farmer's \"Riverworld\" series \"was a difficult act to follow, and many Farmerites wondered whether the Riverworld was wide enough to sustain a projected tetralogy. The author's next works allayed all fears.\" In subsequent novels Farmer's characters build a paddle wheel boat, several blimps, and even an air force of small planes in their quest for the headwaters of the River. Besides fighting among themselves and against hostile peoples they must voyage past during their journey, the explorers must be on guard against agents of the Ethicals, the mysterious creators of Riverworld, who are secretly in their midst. In the course of this adventure, many theological, political, and cultural questions are raised and discussed by historical figures from widely different times and cultures. Farmer's juxtaposition of historical figures from widely divergent periods \"insinuates strands of history and myth, philosophy and ribaldry\" into the multi-volume adventure story, according to Stoler.\n\nFurther examples of Farmer's innovative concepts are found in the \"World of Tiers\" series, which concerns a highly advanced race of humans who, through the use of technology, create entire self-contained universes governed by arbitrary natural laws. Although other writers have examined man's evolution and technological development, in Wollheim's view Farmer implies \"that God Himself might be just another mortal playing at scientific games.\"\n\nThough the \"World of Tiers\" series was scheduled to end with the fourth installment, The Magic Labyrinth, which followed The Dark Design in 1980, Farmer returned in 1983 with Gods of Riverworld, encouraging a reviewer for Publishers Weekly to remark: \"The River-world seems to pull Farmer as the Mississippi did Twain.\" In Gods of Riverworld the humans who discovered the secret of the Ethicals' power take control of Riverworld and contend with the consequences of their newfound authority. Although critics found the work flawed, it was noted that this novel, like its precursors, contains \"enough action, intrigue, and Farmer's habitual game-playing with historical characters\" to satisfy fans of the series, according to Booklist critic Roland Green.\n\nLike the \"Riverworld\" series, the \"World of Tiers\" series relies heavily on action-packed plots. Novels in this series \"are marked by an intense sense of pulp action-adventure, with fast-paced and very physical action, battles and contests, intrigues, disguises, and surprises,\" remarked Wymer. \"But Farmer combines this action with a fascinating sense of psychological exploration.\" In the first installment, The Maker of Universes, Robert Wolff enters the World of Tiers and leads a revolt against its lords, an evil remnant of a technologically advanced race that rule these pocket universes for their own pleasure. Although other writers have examined man's evolution and technological development, Farmer makes \"the implication that God Himself might be just another mortal playing at scientific games,\" Wollheim added.\n\nGates of Creation, the second work in the series, finds Wolff's own father leading an invasion of the world over which Wolff now reigns. In the next three novels in the series—A Private Cosmos, Behind the Walls of Terra, and The Lavalite World—the focus shifts to Kickaha, a secondary figure in the first two books and, according to Wymer, an exemplum of Farmer's \"ideal non-neurotic man, afraid only of real threats and ready to risk his life without hesitation.\" The series ends with Red Orc's Rage and More than Fire, books that stage a lingering battle between good and evil, represented by Kickaha and Lord Red Orc, leader of the creators of the pocket universes.\n\nFarmer turns to the Earth of the future in the \"Day-world\" series, in which overpopulation—caused by the conquering of poverty, hunger, and pollution—is resolved by dividing humanity into seven categories, each allowed one day of consciousness per week then consigned to suspended animation the other six. Jeff Caird is a Daybreaker, a rebel against the system who assumes seven different personalities in his quest to remain conscious seven days a week. Dayworld, the first book in the series, recounts Caird's struggles to integrate his personalities and escape the grip of the Earth's corrupt leaders. This book \"provides further evidence of the author's vivid imagination and ingenious storytelling skills,\" enthused Peter L. Robertson in Booklist. The first sequel, Dayworld Rebel, finds Farmer's protagonist—now known as Duncan—imprisoned by the authorities, escaping, and leading a band of rebels to Los Angeles. Still running in Dayworld Breakup, Duncan enlists the aid of a female cop in leading a revolution to end the Dayworld system. Although some critics found that the final two novels failed to live up to the promise of the first, reviewers tended to recommend that libraries purchase the books anyway, considering Farmer's popularity. \"A definite acquisition, given Farmer's vast audience,\" concluded Roland Green in his review of Dayworld Breakup.\n\nIn other books, such as The Adventure of the Peerless Peer and Tarzan Alive, Farmer plays tongue-in-cheek games using famous literary characters. In The Peerless Peer, he writes a new Sherlock Holmes adventure under the pseudonym of Holmes's assistant, John H. Watson. Tarzan Alive is a thorough biography of the \"real\" Tarzan that answers questions, a reviewer for the New York Times held, that \"have been plaguing practically nobody at all for many years now…. Rarely has so much been written so obscurely about so little.\" He concluded that Farmer is \"some kind of a genius of Dada.\"\n\nUnder the pseudonym Kilgore Trout, Farmer wrote Venus on the Half-Shell, a parody of a work by novelist Kurt Vonnegut. Trout, a character in several of Von-negut's novels, is a science-fiction writer who has authored hundreds of books, all of them unfortunately published by pornography houses that marketed them under rather non-SF titles. \"I thought people would flip their minds,\" Farmer explained in Dream Makers, \"if they saw a book by Trout, a supposedly fictional character, on the stands. Also, I did it as a tribute, the highest, to an author whom I loved and admired at that time. And I identify with Trout.\" Farmer's parody was so well done that several critics assumed Vonnegut had written the book. \"Who is Kilgore Trout?\" Walton R. Collins of the National Observer asked. \"The odds are good that he is Vonnegut…. You can't read a dozen pages anywhere in Venus without becoming morally certain you're reading Vonnegut. The style is unmistakable.\"\n\nFarmer has published several collections of his shorter pieces, including the short stories and novellas that made his early reputation. In a review of The Classic Philip José Farmer, a critic for Kirkus Reviews remarked, that the author \"was instrumental in kicking science fiction out of its late-1940s puritanical rut—and these six iconoclastic, imaginative yarns aptly show how and why.\" Library Journal contributor Susan L. Nickerson recommended that readers \"who know Farmer only for his more recent tepid efforts\" seek out this resource for examples of his early work. Voice of Youth Advocates contributor Susan B. Madden found Farmer's Purple Book, containing \"Riders of the Purple Wage,\" \"Spiders of the Purple Mage,\" and others, \"punny, irreverent, raunchy and bizarre.\" The Grand Adventure, which includes early pieces presaging the \"Riverworld\" series among other works, was also highly recommended by critics, who compared these pieces favorably to more recent efforts by the popular author. \"The stories are 'classic' Farmer, well constructed, readable, and more satisfying than most of his contemporary esoteric pieces,\" wrote Jerry L. Parsons in Fantasy Review.\n\nThe influence of Farmer's immense body of work stretches across boundaries. Not only have his books been translated into over twenty languages, they also have been published in more than forty countries, establishing him as one of the preeminent voices in modern science fiction and fantasy literature. In 2001 Farmer was honored with the World Fantasy Award for Lifetime Achievement, just one of many accolades he has received. Writing in the St. James Guide to Science Fiction Writers, critic Mary Turzillo Brizzi commented on the traits that have made Farmer a unique voice in the literary world. \"Farmer attacks convention. He startles readers with scenes of alien and human sex and reproduction. He speculates on metaphysical verities, the nature of the soul and the uncertainty of human knowledge. He refutes conventional theology,\" Brizzi wrote. \"Immortality, the conflict between individual and society, religious conversion, impossible physical perfection, the drive for power and knowledge—such are his themes.\"\n\nWith his publishing career spanning nearly five decades, Farmer has few regrets about what he has written. He prefers to concentrate his energies on future writings. Speaking of his many novels, Farmer stated in Dream Makers: \"I can see where I could have done better. I can see innumerable cases. But it's no good to go back and rewrite them, because if you did you'd lose a certain primitive vigor that they have. The thing to do is to go on and write new stuff.\" The Philip José Farmer Society, an organization for enthusiasts and collectors of Farmer's work, was founded in 1978.\n\nBIOGRAPHICAL AND CRITICAL SOURCES:\n\nBOOKS\n\nAuthors and Artists for Young Adults, Volume 28, Thomson Gale (Detroit, MI), 1999.\n\nBeacham's Encyclopedia of Popular Fiction, Beacham (Osprey, FL), 1996.\n\nBrizzi, Mary, The Reader's Guide to Philip José Farmer, Starmont, 1980.\n\nClareson, Thomas D., editor, Voices for the Future, Volume 2, Bowling Green University Popular Press, 1979.\n\nContemporary Literary Criticism, Thomson Gale (Detroit, MI), Volume 1, 1973, Volume 19, 1981.\n\nDictionary of Literary Biography, Volume 8: Twentieth-Century American Science-Fiction Writers, Thomson Gale (Detroit, MI), 1981.\n\nFarmer, Philip José, The Book of Philip José Farmer, DAW (New York, NY), 1973.\n\nKnapp, Lawrence J., The First Editions of Philip José Farmer, Science Fiction Bibliographies 2, David G.
