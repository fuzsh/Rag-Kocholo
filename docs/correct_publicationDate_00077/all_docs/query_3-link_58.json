        "text": "“There is nothing wrong with being scared… as long as you don’t let it affect you until the danger is over… The difference between a coward and a braveman is mostly a matter of timing.”\n\n– Robert A Heinlein Job: A Comedy of Errors\n\nSigned Limited First Edition. This is letter “L” of 26 lettered copies of the limited edition. Additionally there were 750 copies that were numbered. Signed on the limitation page. Full numberline. Bound in red publisher’s cloth with a small gilt insignia to the bottom corner of the front board, with gilt titling on spine. Includes matching slipcase.\n\nAs one of the first sci-fi authors to break into the mainstream by his publications in popular magazines such as The Saturday Evening Post in the late 1940s, Robert A. Heinlein was instrumental in establishing science fiction as a significant genre and not just a passing subcultural fad. Along with sci-fi legends Isaac Asimov and Arthur C. Clark, Robert A. Heinlein was considered one of the “Big Three” of science fiction authors. Both during his lifetime and posthumously, Heinlein was the recipient of a wide variety of accolades. In 1975, he was awarded the inaugural title of Grand Master by the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America. Additionally, he received Hugo Awards for four of his novels, as well as Retro Hugo Awards for five of his works that were published before the Hugo Awards began. Heinlein’s influence was expansive which is evident in 1980 when the Reagan Administration asked him to join the Citizens Advisory Council on National Space Policy, whose members included the likes of Buzz Aldrin and a multitude of aerospace leaders. Heinlein was a prolific author who published 32 novels, 59 short stories, and 16 collections in his lifetime.\n\nBUY NOW\n\nSigned by the Author on the title page, no inscription. First printing thus. Revised and expanded version of the novel first published in 1960 by Galaxy Publishing\n\nPhilip Jose Farmer’s decided during the fourth grade that he was to be an author. Farmer had a gift for weaving themes of theology, sexuality, and adventure into a wonderfully weird and poignant literary tapestry. He had a truly unique voice and vision, which is exemplified by his novella about a sexual tryst between a human and an extraterrestrial in the novella The Lovers which won him his first of three Hugos. Farmer sparked both celebration and controversy with his novel Venus on the Half-shell, where, with permission, he wrote as the voice of Kilgore Trout, a fictional science fiction authors of Kurt Vonnegut’s design. For a short period of time, the work was attributed to Vonnegut, who was none too pleased and was known later to have regretted allowing Farmer to publish, even though the novel’s reception in the literary community was quite warm.\n\nAmong his many honors, Farmer was named the SFWA Grand Master in 2001, and in that same year was given the World Fantasy Award for Lifetime Achievement.\n\nBUY NOW\n\n“Don’t adventures ever have an end?

Tolkien was a hugely celebrated fantasy author who has unrivaled significance in the genre of high fantasy. He is considered to be the father of the modern fantasy. Tolkien had a gift for other world development which is best exemplified in the rich environment of Middle-earth which his most revered works take place.\n\nAs both a student and a professor, Tolkien was immersed in the academics of literature. Whether it be during his tenure as a professor from 1925-1959 at the University of Oxford, or as a member of the Inklings, Tolkien’s life was a celebration of the written word.\n\nThe Inklings were an informal group of authors, academics and general literary enthusiasts from the University of Oxford who celebrated and encouraged the authorship of fantasy as well as other works of narrative fiction. During his time with the Inklings, Tolkien spent much time with fellow fantasy luminary C.S. Lewis (The Chronicles of Narnia).\n\nTolkien’s Lord of the Rings trilogy, as well as the prequel The Hobbit were adapted into major motion pictures starting in 2001. Directed by Peter Jackson, the trilogy was a feat of cinematography using the gorgeous landscape of New Zealand to bring Middle-earth to life.\n\nBUY NOW\n\nThree-Quarter Leather.

A Game of Thrones is structured with chapters indicating whomever of the eight main characters is being reflected by the third person limited narration. The series focuses on the 7 kingdoms of Westeros and the drama that unfolds when family, wealth, power, and fear of “the other” clash.\n\nGeorge RR Martin acquired a passion for reading at a young age when he realized that he could escape his home in Beyonne, New Jersey, to fantastical worlds beyond his wildest dreams. Martin began his lifetime love affair with storytelling as a youth when he would write and perform monster stories to the neighborhood children for a penny. Martin’s first published work was at the ripe age of 21 with the sale of his story “The Hero” to Galaxy magazine. In 1973 Martin was nominated for his first Hugo Award and Nebula award for his work “With Morning Comes Mistfall.” In 1977 Martin published his first novel Dying of the Light. GRRM is very active in the sci-fi fandom community as much as a fan as he is a contributor. Martin actively writes on his blog “Not a Blog” and regularly attends conventions. Martin may have found fame, and well-deserved success, even being called “the American Tolkien” by Lev Grossman of Time Magazine, but he has never turned his back on the creative community that helped bring him to where he is today\n\nBuy Now\n\nLimited Edition.

Mullen was frequently published in Planet Stories, as well as a number of other pulp magazines of the time.\n\nMullen was deeply entrenched in the sci-fi community, not only as a content creator but as a producer. Mullen was the owner of Gorgon Press, a small press publisher that he instituted in 1948. Mullen released a short-lived fanzine named The Gorgon, after his company, which only released 11 issues in total. Along with his literary works, Mullen was a celebrated artist, and today has a series of painting as a part of a permanent collection at the Denver Art Museum.\n\nBuy Now\n\n“Secrecy begets tyranny.”\n\n― Robert A.
