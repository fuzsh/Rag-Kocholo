        "text": "I finished \"The Long Tomorrow\" by Leigh Brackett. This novel is your classic post-apocolyptic story published in 1955. The basic premise is nuclear war destroys the cities of the world. In order to prevent a reoccurence, cities are banned. Because Mennonites and Amish are used to living without power and other luxeries, the Mennonites become the dominate religious and political force in the US.\n\nI found it interesting in that Leigh Brackett was one of those few female authors in the 40s and 50s. She kept her name because it is androgynous. As can be expected the role of women in both the story and the culture she envisions is negligable at best. There was one strong female character, a cantancerous grandmother, who had a bit part. When reading authors such as Brackett, I often wonder if she would change the story if she were writing today.\n\nAt any rate, an ok book. Nothing special, but it did hold my attention throughout.\n\nKamakhya\n\nOriginally posted by Ken Korczak\n\nI've been compared to stranger characters, trail....\n\nSpeaking of Hitchhiker's Guide -- It has long been my (possibly insipid) belief that this book was a shameful knock-off, or at least a slavish copy, of a more obscure book called \"Venus on the Half Shell.\"\n\nInterestingly, this book was published under the name \"Kilgore Trout.\" Of course, Kilgore Trout is a fictitious sf writer and character created in the novels of Kurt Vonnegut.\n\nNow, when I first read \"Venus\" I assumed it had been written by Vonnegut, but later discovered it had actually been written by Philip Jose Farmer, for some odd reason.\n\nIt's really a loopy book, but the similarities between it and Hitchhiker are tough to ignore. It begins with the world flooding, and then the hero traveling off on goofy adventures into a comically tragic universe.\n\nIn fact, when I first read Hitchhiker, I was almost angry because I thought it was near plagerism -- now I'm not so sure.\n\nDoes anyone else have some insight on this issue, which has long intrigued me?\n\nKen,\n\nI found your allegation, that Douglas Adams plagiarised Venus on the Half Shell to write The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy, very disturbing. I admit I haven’t read Venus on the Half Shell, but I did a Google search to find what the book contained, that Adams supposedly found irresistible- and needed to copy. After reading a synopsis I’m afraid I don’t agree with you. It’s a popular theme, trying to find the meaning of life. It’s not the property of Philip Jose Farmer.\n\nApparently Adams said he had the inspiration for writing Hitchhiker when on holiday in Europe. It was a hitchhiking holiday, he had a hitchhiking guide with him and he was lying on his back, drunk, in a field looking at the stars. He imagined then, leaving earth and travelling among the stars. I believe that, but I don’t suppose you do.\n\nWhat I also found interesting, looking all this up, was the spat between Farmer and Vonnegut about the name “Kilgore Trout” and whether permission was granted or not. to use it..\n\nSorry if I've gone off the topic here, but the question was asked....\n\n42\n\nRead Nortsrilia by Cordwainer Smith a couple of days ago. As his only novel I was anxious to read it, and Gollancz very kindly re-issued it for me!\n\nThe story is set 15000 years in the future, on Old North Australia (Norstrilia) a dry fairly inhospitable planet peopled by descendants of present day Australians. They have taken their sheep with them, and this is the source of their fabulous wealth. Not the wool or the meat however, but a drug derived from the mutated sheep and called stroon. This bestows immortality if taken regularly. One of the farmers, Roderick Frederick Ronald Arnold William MacArthur McBan (the 151st) decides to buy Earth with his share of the planet’s wealth.\n\nIt has all Smith’s usual rich store of characters that he had in The Rediscovery of Man short stories.\n\nSmith (or Paul Linebarger, his real name ) had an incredible real life story growing up in China, serving as an intelligence officer during the war there. Later he spent some time in Australia where it obviously made a big impression on him, he even talked of settling down there in retirement.\n\nI really enjoyed this book- but I knew I would\n\n42\n\nWell, remember, 42, that I said that my thoughts about the Hittchhiker-Halfshell connection were possibly insipid, and maybe they are. I tend to have a very insipid streak. Some says it's my dominant trait! So I'll hope you'll give me credit for being insipid -- credit where credit is due!\n\nBut I really don't think I \"alleged plagerism.\" At least I didn't mean to. If you go back up and look at my quote I said:\n\n\"I thought it was near plagerism -- now I'm not so sure.\"\n\nEmphasis on the \"near.\"\n\nSo I really think I was careful in not saying Adams was a plagarist, which I really don't think he is. Still, I urge you to find \"Halfshell\" and read it. I'm sure Adams was being very truthful about his inspiration for Hitchhiker, but that doesn't mean he didn't use \"Halfshell\" at least as an inspiration, or maybe a jumping off point. I mean, the beginnings of both books are so extremely similar in my view.\n\nBut again, a lot of books are similar in a general way. How many Sf books start off with astronauts rocketing off into space, for example. Call it a formula, maybe.\n\nAnother thing: I should confess a prejudice. I thought Hitchhiker was one of the most awful and tedious books I have ever read. I simply hated it -- but I know of no other person who agrees with me! Every member of my own family thinks it's a fantastic book, and they all think I'm nuts! -- as do the many legions of fans this book still inspires.\n\nBut I also seem to be all alone on Harry Potter -- again, I truly think one of the worst books I have ever read. I mean, truly dreadful. Yet, Rowling is now a billionaire and beloved -- and me -- obscure and ignored! So there you go.\n\nOne last thing: I think Cordwainer Smith is possibly the most intriguing and one of the very best SF writers of all time, even though his body of work is uneven and small. Have you ever read \"Scanners Live in Vain.\" It's one of the best short stories in history!\n\nI had a a nice 6 hr reading session today and finished \"Deepsix\" by Jack McDevitt. Thanks to y'all, I read many a fine review of that book on this site. I picked up a remainder copy of this book a while back, but never got around to reading it. To be honest, the premise did nothing for me. Obviously, since I felt compelled to keep reading it all day today, I liked it!\n\nI do think that the story was a bit cliched. The continual mishaps, the absolute last minute rescue (at no small cost) from a world about to be destroyed, etc. was a bit too much like a Hollywood movie. However, the formula certainly works for grabbing the readers attention and riveting them to their chairs!\n\nMcDevitt is a decent writer and his characterization is excellent.\n\nOn the subject of \"Venus on the Half-Shell.\" Believe it or not, I have this thing for the book. I love Vonnegut and have always been intrigued by Kilgore Trout. I first bought the book in Paris, a French translation. I have since acquired three or four copies of the book, including one signed by Vonnegut, which states \"Not my book\" and one signed by Farmer. But here's the weird part... I have never read it! Obviously, I will have to correct that situation!\n\nAs for Cordwainer Smith, I did like \"Scanners Live in Vain\", but I just couldn't get into Instrumentalities. For example, I did not particularly like \"No, No, Not Rogov.\" Obviously a brillant man, but maybe a bit to \"deep\" for light reading for my tastes. However, I did just salvage a copy of \"Nortsrilia\" from my dad's collection and will give it a shot. It sounds good from 42's description.\n\nKamakhya\n\nOver the Christmas holidays, I raided my dad's bookshelves again and picked up another large load of old paperbacks and a bunch of Lem hardbacks. I really enjoy reading some of the \"older\" novels. I love to see the cultural attitudes of the times as well as see what ideas hold up over time.\n\nSo today I read \"The Eleventh Commandment\" by Lester Del Rey. I'm pretty sure I have never read a novel by this author before, though, he is well known. It was another after the apocolypse kind of novel. My dad specializes in end of the world scenarios. In this one the Catholic Church takes over. Disease and deformity is rampant due to the excessive amounts of radiation after the war. It had a bit of a surprise ending, which, while I didn't really like it, did work. Overall, the book was definately a worthwhile short read.\n\nKamakhya\n\nKen, I agree that a completely original theme for a story is very unusual indeed. I think it’s fair to say that any science fiction author will have read their share of other author’s work – you must at least be a fan of the genre to even contemplate writing it yourself successfully. Having said that (and I remember what you said about Bova and contamination!) it is more than likely that they will be influenced in some way by those works. I have read a considerable amount of science fiction –good and bad- and I often see similarities in the stories but as long as the body of the work is original I’m happy.\n\nIf Adams read Venus on a Half Shell he was luckier than me in finding a copy! If I ever find a copy – and I suppose my best bet would be a second hand book I will buy it and see if I come to the same conclusion as you did. I have to say however I have been browsing book shops for science fiction for a long time and I’ve never seen or heard of it until now.\n\nRegarding Hitchhiker, here in the UK it first came out as a radio series on the BBC in 1978 and was then rewritten for BBC television, and then came the book. Because the Radio/TV series were so popular the book had a jump start and became a best seller. I admit most of my recollections of it were taken from the TV series which I thought was original and very funny. If we all liked the same things it would be a boring old world though, so I’m willing to let you hate Hitchhiker\n\nHowever, we may have something in common with Harry Potter –the fervour about the series has passed me by and I have no inclination to read it.\n\nYou mentioned Scanners Live in Vain also, and recommended it. Just a few months ago I read a book of most of Cordwainer Smith’s short stories and enjoyed it thoroughly, and of course Scanners was one of the stories included. It was this book (The Rediscovery of Man) which encouraged me to find Norstrilia and I was fortunate to get a copy recently and have just read. I find his style different to many authors and slightly off beat which I think I have a tendency to enjoy more than some.\n\nI shall continue to look for that book....\n\n42\n\nYour points are well taken on all, 42...\n\nAnother thing about Cordwainder Smith, who was eventually revealed to be Dr. Paul Linebarger -- for a long time his true identity was a very hot mystery in the SF field. After \"Scanners Live in Vain\" appeared, the entire SF community, especially writers and editors, was electrified by what just about everyone thought was a magnificent piece of work -- yet, who wrote it?\n\nBack then, nobody knew because Linebarger worked hard to stay anonymous, for whatever reason. Rumors flew across field that \"Smith\" was a pen name for Pohl, or Vance, or Heinlein, or someone else.\n\nMost believed that a new writer could not be that good!\n\nRobert Silverberg writes about this in his excellent book, \"Worlds of Wonder.\" In this book -- which is an absolute must read for any SF fan -- Silverberg chooses some of his favorite stories, and then tells why he thinks they are good, and also provides truly wonderful insights about authors, and about writing SF.\n\nSilverberg also gives a short autobiography of his own career in this book, which is interesting.\n\nOne last thing, Cordwainer wrote a couple of sensational stories involving cats: One where they were used as \"pinlighters\" and another where a man commanded cats to evolve and worship human beings over a period of 2 million years -- I can't remember the name of these stories right now, but they're just terrific.\n\nLinebarger must have really loved cats.\n\nOH! And one last thing: Did you all know that Cordwainer Smith hid secret messages in his works, mosy often using (I forget what the device is called, it's somethings like accrostics). For example, he inserted a message in his Nostalia: \"They shot John. F. Kennedy.\" The beginnings of successive sentences spell out this message. Weird, huh?\n\nOriginally posted by Kamakhya\n\nI had a a nice 6 hr reading session today and finished \"Deepsix\" by Jack McDevitt.

It sounds good from 42's description.\n\nKamakhya\n\nKamakhya,\n\nYour views on Deepsix coincide with mine it seems. I also felt some of the \"drama\" was a little contrived. But a good page turner all the same. I enjoyed it.\n\nHaving read both The Rediscovery of Man and Norstrilia recently I feel if I'd read Norstrilia first it would have helped me with understanding more about the under people etc. Unfortunately Norstrilia didn't come into my possession until I'd read The Rediscovery.....\n\nThe timeline contained in the latter book however I found useful to \"place\" events as they happened.\n\nI envy you your access to your dad's collection ( I assume some of the older science fiction authors' work), although yesterday an old friend gave me a box full of his unwanted science fiction which I'll need to sort out tomorrow.\n\n42"
