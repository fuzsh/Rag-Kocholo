        "text": "Want to know more about William Hope Hodgson and his weird fiction, or about Carnacki the Ghost Finder? Then look no further. Five years ago this October we ran a month-long celebration of Hope Hodgson, and since then we’ve dipped back many times into his maritime fiction, his poetry, his weird novels, and of course his occult detective Carnacki the Ghost Finder. Plus we’ve looked at a whole range of pastiches and projects drawing on elements of WHH’s work, and included many audiovisual links.\n\nWe have tons of new weird and detective fiction stuff to mention some time soon, but being in an Octobral mood, we realised that searching for WHH or Carnacki on our site throws up far too many results, including dozens of incidental mentions, so five years on, we thought we’d pull together an index of all the key pieces instead.\n\nN.B. A lot of our early work was done alongside our late and dear friend Sam Gafford, an authority on the subject, who used to maintain his own more scholarly site on Hope Hodgson, and we’re pleased to see that Sam is well-represented below.\n\nAs it happens, while we were doing this, we saw that Willie Meikle mentions his work on Carnacki, and his forthcoming Carnacki collection Starry Wisdom & Other Stories, in a recent podcast interview with Charles Christian (Willie comes on around 14:30 minutes in).\n\nweird tales radio show\n\nStarry Wisdom & Other Stories can be pre-ordered now:\n\ndark regions pre-order\n\nAlso at the end of this post: A list of some of the Author/Horror sites taking part in the annual October Frights Blog Hop.

In his introduction, editor Johnny Mains describes the collection as ‘pure literary entertainment’, which seems an appropriate phrase. It is a book to be read on a rainy day, with English tea and a fireside to hand.\n\nBe warned that there is nothing truly monstrous or unusual within, yet Lord’s stories are well-written, often entertaining, and occasionally more wry than expected. Sometimes she even manages to surprise, though many of the pieces are simply windows into that classic Victorian story-world of orphans, small inheritances, early widowhood, death in childbirth, and unrequited love; of uncles variously beneficent or curmudgeonly, of turreted rooms and outdated values.\n\nAs for the supernatural, it is present, but far more often as an undercurrent than anything – hints of frightful incidents and influences which may turn out to be rather mundane. Lord suggests more than she details, only very occasionally launching the reader into actual otherworldly waters. Thus rambling manor houses, dark moorlands and sad deaths are often exactly what they seem, without any malign spiritual hand behind them, despite characters’ fears – upon which she frequently plays. More people fear ghosts in here than encounter them. And there is a certain pleasure in trying to anticipate ‘solutions’ to odd events or circumstances, but don’t expect many unrefuted spirits.\n\nOf the twenty one stories within, we most enjoyed:\n\n‘The Fell-Thorpe Ghost’ – an ‘Is there or isn’t there?’ tale.\n\n‘A Singular Experience’ – a little meditation on a man’s scary situation.\n\n‘Loyale Je Serais’ – because it just doesn’t go where you expect.\n\n‘Our Lady of Hate’ – though more for the imagery than the plot.\n\n‘My Uncle’s Pictures’ – an amusing tale of family and fraud.\n\nQuite what Lord herself thought, in any social or psychological sense, remains as obscure as the writer has been until now. She is far more the product of mid-Victorian sensibilities than of the relative social tumult which was building at the turn of the century. There is no incipient struggle for suffrage, or acid commentary on the struggle between the sexes and a changing society – relationships may be ‘perfect matches’, tragic, unrequited love affairs, dutiful inevitabilities, or simply ill-judged. She seems, in essence, in favour of what you might expect – a loving relationship between a man and a woman within the boundaries of ‘normal’ society standards. There are decent step-mothers, faithful men, misguided lovers and even an alcoholic wife thrown in, but little demonising.\n\nJohnny Mains has done an excellent job of locating and gathering together Lord’s output, and a service to readers, like ourselves, who are fascinated by the late Victorian and Edwardian literary period. Which is to be expected, of course, given his previous editorial work on more explicitly supernatural tales of the time – and the introduction to Our Lady of Hate also gives a fine feel of what it was like to track down and identify these obscure stories, a consummate piece of detection.\n\nOur Lady of Hate (Noose & Gibbet Publishing) is due out December 2020, and pre-orders can be placed by emailing johnnymains@outlook.com Copies are £20 + £3 postage (£10 overseas postage because of rising international charges).\n\nFor those who seek directly supernatural stories from other, mostly forgotten, female authors, we do recommend Johnny Mains’ anthologies, available in print and Kindle:\n\nA Suggestion of Ghosts: Supernatural Fiction by Women 1854-1900 (Black Shuck Books)\n\na suggestion of ghosts\n\nAn Obscurity of Ghosts: Further Tales of the Supernatural by Women, 1876 – 1903 (Black Shuck Books)\n\nan obscurity of ghosts\n\nAlso available in Kindle now is Mains’ Back from the Dead: The Legacy of the Pan Book of Horror Stories:\n\nThe Pan Book of Horror Stories ran for 30 volumes between 1959 and 1989, entertaining and terrifying thousands of readers in equal measure. In this tribute to the classic horror series, award-winning editor and historian Johnny Mains has commissioned new pieces from some of Pan’s most respected authors, printed here alongside selected stories from the original volumes.\n\nback from the dead\n\nShare this article with friends - or enemies...\n\nor Will The Real Blade Please Stand Up? Because when all’s said and done, we’ve always preferred the original seventies comic book Blade to the revised, enhanced version of the late nineties and the films. And maybe because Blade is actually British, which has been rather forgotten in the slew of Marvel re-imaginings over the last twenty years…\n\nSo yes, in one of our last entries for Black Vampire Week, we can state firmly that Blade the Vampire Killer (or Slayer, or Hunter) was born Eric Brooks in Soho, London, England, and raised as a Londoner. Honest.\n\nWe don’t find that out immediately in the comics. Created by writer Marv Wolfman and penciller Gene Colan, Blade’s first appearance was in the comic book The Tomb of Dracula #10 (1973), an all-action issue which had little time for flashbacks. And to be fair, they messed with his origins a few times even back in the seventies, though they never went as far as to make him Wesley Snipes and give him an American origin – that came much, much later.\n\nIn the original Tomb of Dracula comics, in early guest appearances and in Marvel Preview #3 (1975), Blade’s mother was bitten during the last stages of a difficult pregnancy, and Blade was the child delivered before she died. Who bit her was never stabilised – there were stories with an unnamed vampire, then a specific vampire, Deacon Frost (who would enter the main Blade mytho-verse), and even occasionally Dracula. Writers often played a bit fast and loose in those days.\n\nThe result was reasonably consistent, though. Blade is simply a human who, because of the events surrounding his birth, cannot be turned by a vampire’s bite. Having been raised in a brothel (with suggestions that his mother had been one of the prostitutes there) and told of what happened, he grows up mad as hell, with a serious chip on his shoulder. Which seems reasonable.\n\nTomb of Dracula presents him as a guy with a grudge, ready to kill any bloodsucker. Wolfman and Colan, however talented, could not come up with much in the way of an English accent, though, and so Blade talks more like Detroit than Soho a lot of the time. Throughout those early appearances, everyone else speaks in polite or cod-English, with some bizarre language from and about the London police especially – the ‘fuzzies’ appear and say things like “haul your black butt inta the wagon.”\n\nDepictions of Britain itself vary between seventies modern, unlikely castles and faux-Dickens slums, but you do have vampiric English teen thugs, wicked nobility, and an annoyed New Scotland Yard. There’s no mistaking the London-centred nature of it all.\n\nBut he’s great. No huge swords or techno-weapons, no mutant talents – just a guy in coloured goggles and a green or purple jacket, with an afro and a bandolier of wooden knives – variously teak, ebony or mahogany. Very physically fit and very determined, with nothing else about him but the attitude, he manages to slay even Dracula (temporarily, of course). A real hero, with a touch of anti-hero loner about him.\n\nTomb of Dracula #30 and Marvel Preview #3 provide more detailed background material. We learn of Blade being brought up by the other women in the brothel, and exposed to vampire hunting through encounters with a man called Jamal Afari, an old jazz trumpeter, who fought vampires with silver but who was later turned. Blade hangs out at Slow-Boy’s, a London jazz club, was taught to play the horn, and so forth. We also learn that back in 1968, he was in China with other human vampire hunters, all Black, called Ogun, Azu, Musenda and Orji. Dracula is supposed to have killed all of them except Musenda (we believe) eventually, but it was there that Blade learned the value of using wooden knives, before returning to London.\n\n(Marvel Preview #3 follows on from Vampire Tales #8 and #9 (1974) and is well worth picking up). The original Blade in full action against the Legion of the Damned.\n\nAs time passes in the seventies, Blade loses the afro, which is a shame, and grows a chin-beard, but still goes out there with his trademark jacket, goggles and bandolier of knives. It’s a great portrayal of an angry man. He’s no teenager – origin dates vary, but he’s at least in his mid-thirties, possibly much older – and he doesn’t take kindly to anyone interfering in his work. Other vampire hunters floating around Britain, such as Quincy Harker and Rachel van Helsing, do not find him easy to work with.\n\n“You know you just killed a teenager, Blade?”\n\n“That’s Mister Blade, Harker – and, frankly, I don’t give a flying hoot! He was a stinkin’ vampire.”\n\nBLADE: THE RETREAD VERSION\n\nBut this is Comicsworld, and they couldn’t leave it alone. By the late 1990s, Blade becomes American (from Detroit, rather than only talking like that), and then… he turns into Wesley Snipes. Who gives us Blade as a dhampir (see later below), a human with vampire strengths but not their weaknesses, with the background timeshift that the attack on Blade’s mother happened in1967; doctors were able to save the baby, but the woman died of an unknown infection.\n\nIt’s not that we don’t like the films, or even some of the later comics, but yeah, we really want the afroed, knife-throwing British Black Bad Boy of the seventies, when Wesley was a mere teenager, and everyone could dig the cat who knew where it was at, the man you didn’t mess with…\n\nBlade the Vampire Killer.\n\nDHAMPIRS ALIVE\n\nAs an addendum, the folklore side: Blade has been described as dhampir, the child of a union between a vampire and a human. Quite how this applies in this case is uncertain, as rather than him being the unlikely offspring of two genetic strains, the comics seem to suggest that some unknown factor was passed from the bitten mother to the child, presumably through the placenta.\n\nNor, as we’ve said, do they use the dhampir angle in the comics at first (he is eventually bitten by Morbius the Living Vampire and gains quite a few directly vampiric/dhampiric characteristics).\n\nDhampir, a word of Albanian origin, had its own variable place in Slav folklore, and we can do no better than to direct you to Andy Paciorek of the Folk Horror revival, who wrote an entire book on Eastern European myths which we covered a while ago. In his Black Earth: A Field Guide to the Slavic Otherworld, he says:\n\nIn East European lore it is not uncommon for dead husbands to visit their still living wives. Sometimes they will feed on the vitality of their spouse, but sometimes they will still follow other matrimonial desires. It was believed, particularly amongst gypsies, that should a male child be born of the union between a widow and her revenant husband (or sometimes lover if out of wedlock) then the baby boy will grow up to be a being known as a Dhampir. Known sometimes as the ‘Devil’s Partner’, Dhampires are actually a force against evil, though their power demands both fear and respect. Dhampires assume the role of Vampire-hunters and are well equipped for the position for it is said that they possess great speed, strength and agility and the ability to see invisible spirits anti recognise vampires at sight.\n\nThere’s more in the actual book, which you can get through the link below (it’s also heavily illustrated by Andy):\n\nblack earth by andrew l paciorek\n\nAs we close down Black Vampire Week, don’t forget that SLAY, full of some fantastic authors, is due out on 13th October, and available to pre-order now:\n\nSLAY on Amazon UK\n\nSLAy on Amazon US\n\nShare this article with friends - or enemies...\n\nBefore we bite down hard, a neat piece of trivia related to our post on Blacula earlier in the week. Old greydog‘s talented writing partner, author and award-winning artist Alan M Clark, also noticed the review, and informs us that:\n\n“I went to high school at Symbas Experimental High School in a warehouse commune in San Francisco. My ‘film’ teacher was the Joan Torres who wrote Blacula and Scream Blacula Scream.”\n\nRather cool. You can find the article on Scream Blacula Scream here:\n\nSCREAM, BLACULA, SCREAM\n\nAnyway, vampire fiction is again the mood of the day, as three more word-whisperers tell us a bit about their stories in the forthcoming SLAY anthology. This time we’re pleased to have Valjeane Jeffers, Marcia Colette writing as V G Harrison, and Miranda Riley, who provide three very different takes on the Vampire Noire…\n\n‘Beautiful Monsters’ by Valjeanne Jeffers\n\nSanyu, the heroine of my story, ‘Beautiful Monsters’, is both a vampire and a freedom fighter. Thus, she is something of an anti-heroine, if you will. Sanyu is powerful and bloodthirsty. But she is definitely focused on her end game, which is slaying oppression. Her journey takes place in the town of Passion, in an alternative steamfunk universe.\n\nI’ve been in love with vampires—werewolves too (really all creatures of the night)—since I was child watching Dracula and Barnabas from Dark Shadows, But when I saw the call for submissions to SLAY: Stories of the Vampire Noire, I realized that I’d never written a story about a traditional vampire, although I wrote about “time vampires” in the third novel of my Immortal series, Immortal III: Stealer of Souls.\n\nSo, I decided to challenge myself. I drew from the myths of traditional vampires, their birth, their fatal allergy to sunlight and, of course, their bloodlust. I decided to use a steamfunk setting because I love world building. I also included a tribute to my late sister Sidonie, who has a small but quintessential role in ‘Beautiful Monsters’.\n\nI’m so very thrilled. and honored that ‘Beautiful Monsters’ has been published in SLAY, surely a groundbreaking anthology, the first of its kind, and to add my voice to the chorus of wonderful authors writing stories of vampires from the African Diaspora.\n\nValjeanne Jeffers is a speculative fiction writer, a Spelman College graduate, and a member of the Horror Writers Association and the Carolina African America Writers’ Collective. She is the author of nine books, including her Immortal and her Mona Livelong: Paranormal Detective series.\n\nValjeanne has been published in numerous anthologies including: Steamfunk!; The Ringing Ear; Luminescent Threads: Connections to Octavia E. Butler; Fitting In: Historical Accounts of Paranormal Subcultures; Sycorax’s Daughters; Black Magic Women, The Bright Empire, and, most recently, All the Songs We Sing, and Bledrotica Volume I.

Harrison\n\nFeaturing Dr. Adelynn Jakande, ‘Message in a Vessel’ takes place on the moon in the distant future where a virus has turned most of the world into vampires. The few humans who are left can no longer feed the rest of the world. Vampire and bioinformatics specialist Dr. Jakande is faced with the task of helping her people look to the stars for new sources of food. There are no threats to the mission, so it’s a go… until Dr. Jakande double-checks what little humanity she has left.\n\nFor sci-fi visit: www.vgharrison.com\n\nFor paranormal/urban fantasy: www.marciacolette.com\n\n‘Rampage’ by Miranda J. Riley\n\nI’d say that my vampire is unlike any vampire written before because she is not originally human. When Nicole posted the call for SLAY submissions and I read the description of “unique, never before seen vampires”, I knew I could knock this out. I thought, “what if…we took the giant, most gentle being on the planet and turned it sour?” And so Talik, the vampire elephant, was created.\n\nI lived with my family in Mozambique for a period of time and fell in love with a small village named Machanga. That is where I base my story, except in my world, Machanga was attacked by a league of vampires and killed Aziza’s family. Aziza trained to become a warrior who could protect her village and serve as a guardian.\n\nBut what is all that training good for if no one comes to attack?\n\nKruger National Park is losing elephants fast due to Talik’s rage and bloodlust. The Order of vampire slayers calls in Aziza, a warrior in the area and of interest to the Order, to help slay the beast and find the one responsible for transforming Talik into a monster.\n\nThis is Miranda J. Riley’s first published work! She has another short story in the works for publication through Prospective Press and she thanks Mocha Memoirs Press for the chance to share her talents. You can follow her on Twitter @TheSpunkyDragon and friend her on Facebook. You can also check out her beta website at https://mjrileyonline.co. Miranda is originally from Brazil and has lived on three different continents in her short lifetime. She gathers inspiration from the people, places, and events that have impacted her life.\n\nSLAY, full of some fantastic authors, is due out on 13th October, and available to pre-order now:\n\nSLAY on Amazon UK\n\nSLAy on Amazon US\n\nAt the weekend – our SLAY-fest continues with the comic book origins of Blade the Vampire Killer, and then on to pastures new…\n\nShare this article with friends - or enemies..."
