        "text": "Philip José Farmer is an American author best know for writing the World of Tiers series of books and the Riverworld series. His work focused on pulp heroes while also pioneering use of sexual and religious themes in the genre.\n\nFarmer is a three-time Hugo Award winner and he was also awarded as a Nebula Grand Master. He is one of the foremost writers of science fiction and fantasy that wrote characters like Tarzan and Doc Savage. One of his best known works is The Lovers that introduced sex to the world of science fiction. Farmer grew up in Peoria, Illinois and wanted to write from fourth grade on. He washed out of flight training in World War II and eventually attended Bradley University where he earned a bachelor’s degree in English in 1950. Two years later, he would publish The Lovers.\n\nPublication Order of World Of Tiers Books\n\nPublication Order of Herald Childe Books\n\nPublication Order of Doc Caliban and Lord Grandrith Books\n\nPublication Order of Opar Books\n\nPublication Order of Dayworld Books\n\nPublication Order of Riverworld Books\n\nPublication Order of Tarzan Books\n\nPublication Order of Philip Jose Farmer's The Dungeon Books\n\n(with Richard A.

The Riverworld is a place where every human who ever lived, from the earliest days of humanity to the present day, is resurrected after death on the banks of a river in an unknown world. They are provided with food, but no clue to the meaning of their afterlife and no idea of what they are meant to do. Billions of people from history have to start living again.\n\nThe World of Tiers starts with The Maker of Universes. The book focuses on a man named Robert Wolff who is trying to buy a new house in Arizona. One day, he finds a secret doorway through space and time that sends him into the World of Tiers. The world is populated by fantastical creatures and ascending levels that is anything beyond anything that Wolff has ever experienced."
