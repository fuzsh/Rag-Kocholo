They travel from planet to planet in search of God or someone able to answer his fundamental questions about life. At one point, the hero drinks a sort of immortality potion that allows him to live for over 1000 years.\n\nHe manages to find God's planet in the end, which is a very bureaucratic place, and he asks why are things the way they are, with injustice, evil and so on, and he receives an answer similar to \"Why not?\"\n\nDoes this sound familiar to any of you?"
