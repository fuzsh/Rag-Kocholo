        "text": "Philip José Farmer was born on January 26, 1918, in Terre Haute, Indiana, and grew up in Peoria, Illinois. In 1952, he won the first of three Hugo Awards for his novella, The Lovers, which is notable for its pioneering use of sexual themes in science fiction. He later won Hugo Awards for his novella, Riders of the Purple Wage, and To Your Scattered Bodies Go, and the first book in his Riverworld Series, which ultimately comprised five novels and numerous short stories. In 1975, Venus on the Half-Shell was published under the pseudonym, Kilgore Trout, the fictional writer-protagonist of several Kurt Vonnegut novels. Throughout his career, Farmer wrote nearly 60 novels, and over 100 short stories and novellas. He died on February 25, 2009.\n\nThe collection contains copies of Farmer's published work, including his novels (some in translation) and stories published in various science fiction periodicals. There are also many manuscripts, story notes, and character sketches. The collections also contains correspondence to and from Farmer, various personal papers, and printed material related to his involvement in the science fiction community.\n\nRestrictions on Use\n\nCopyright Information\n\nCopyrights are retained by donor.
