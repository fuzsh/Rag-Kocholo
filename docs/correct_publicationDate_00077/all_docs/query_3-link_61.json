Silverberg: «\"The Lovers\" is a whale of story, a very special kind of love story, a trailblazer, a pioneering work. That was how I found it in 1952, and how it still seems to me more than sixty years later. It's sexy, yes, and certainly that caught my teenage interest back there in 1952, but it's the way the story is sexy that matters most.»\n\nThe second version, the Foreword, is much longer.
