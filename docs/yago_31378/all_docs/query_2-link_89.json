From small rural villages in the developing world to grand concert halls, both personally and professionally Ashley has engaged in her passion for building community and inviting people into the experience of music as a tool for connection.\n\nAs the principal trumpet of the Cincinnati Chamber Orchestra, Ashley enjoys regular cross-discipline artistic collaborations in non-traditional and traditional performance spaces in connection with their highly successful Summermusik Festival. She also held the position of third trumpet with the Dayton Philharmonic Orchestra from 2003-2012, and has performed with the Sydney Symphony Orchestra, Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra, North Carolina Symphony, Charlotte Symphony, Chamber Orchestra of the Triangle, Winston-Salem Symphony, Greensboro Symphony, Asheville Symphony, New World Symphony Orchestra and Sinfonia Gulf Coast.\n\nHer work as a soloist and recitalist has taken her around the globe including performances in Taiwan, South Korea, New Zealand, Australia, Germany, Mexico and China. Recent career highlights include solo appearances in Taipei, Taiwan with the Grace Orchestra, multiple performances of B Minor Mass, and cornet solos with the North Carolina Brass Band, Lexington Brass Band, Atlantic Brass Band and the Sheldon Theatre Brass Band. As Concert Master of the New England Brass Band and founding member of the electro-acoustic trumpet quintet Fifth Bridge, Ashley enjoys a busy and diverse performance calendar. Recent highlights include multiple solo recital tours, national and international tours with Carolina Brass and Stiletto Brass Quintet, an Asia tour with the Rodney Marsalis Philadelphia Big Brass, returning as guest artist to the Great American Brass Band Festival, and being the featured trumpet solo artist and clinician at both the International Women’s Brass Conference and the National Trumpet Competition.\n\nAshley is on trumpet faculty at the Longy School of Music and also manages the school’s innovative Career Coaching Program – a program designed to help students craft meaningful careers in the arts that are congruous with their personal values and goals. She has held other collegiate teaching positions at the University of North Carolina School of the Arts, St. Olaf College and the University of Dayton. Ashley combines her passion for whole-person development with a methodical approach to trumpet improvement. Her teaching on respiratory mechanics, strategic practice planning, upper register development, and her personal stories of struggle and growth make her one of the most sought-after guest clinicians and educators on the trumpet.\n\nWith significant experience in arts leadership and education, Ashley served on the board of directors for the Rochester Symphony (MN), helping the Symphony reimagine its Educational Outreach programming. In collaboration with the Dayton Arts Institute, she and her husband developed “Art and Music: Making the Connection” – an educational program helping students to see the connections between visual art and music as they evolved over time. She currently assists the Cincinnati Chamber Orchestra with their strategic planning initiatives, and loves to see the arts used as a powerful tool for community engagement and human connection.\n\nAshley’s passion for community engagement through the arts has taken on many iterations over the years but remains a focus of everything she does as an artist and teacher. She taught weekly early childhood music classes for Half Pint Harmonies to families in Winston-Salem, North Carolina and offered a free weekly course sponsored by the YMCA literacy program integrating principles of English as a second language into the Music Class curriculum for local refugee families. Additionally, Ashley loves organizing community “Brass Jams” during free outdoor Brass Band concerts, inviting kids of all ages to participate in the experience of music with those on stage.
