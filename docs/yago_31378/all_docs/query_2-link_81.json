        "text": "Behavioral inhibition (BI) refers to a temperamental tendency to display wariness, fearfulness, or restraint in response to unfamiliar people, objects, and situations (Kagan, Reznick, Snidman, Gibbons, & Johnson, 1988). When exposed to the unfamiliar, inhibited children may respond by seeking proximity to their caregivers and show reduced approach towards novel stimuli or people. The construct of BI differs from most other current models of temperament in several ways (Zentner & Bates, 2008). First, while most major theories of temperament adopt a multidimensional framework, Kagan and colleagues (e.g., Kagan, Reznick, and Snidman, 1988) have focused on a single trait. Second, most current approaches to child temperament originated from theoretical models of temperament. In contrast, Kagan’s work on BI is inductive, developing from a series of empirical studies on the continuity and stability of behavior beginning in early childhood (Kagan & Snidman, 2004). For example, they found that many 2-year-olds categorized as inhibited based on reactivity to unfamiliar situations continued to display inhibited behavior into adolescence (Kagan & Snidman, 2004).While current models of temperament include a variety of constructs, three traits are common to almost all of them: surgency/positive emotionality (PE), negative emotionality (NE), and constraint/effortful control (Caspi & Shiner, 2006; De Pauw & Mervielde, 2010; Rothbart & Bates, 2006). BI overlaps with, but also differs in important ways from each of these three traits. BI and low surgency/PE share a low level of approach/engagement. However, the approach deficit in the latter is assumed to be consistent across situations, whereas in BI it is limited to novel situations. (Laptook, Klein, Olino, Dyson, & Carlson, 2010; Polak-Toste & Gunnar, 2006). Moreover, in the social/interpersonal domain, low surgency/PE may be manifested by a lack of desire to interact with others, whereas behaviorally inhibited, or shy, children often desire social interaction but are inhibited by wariness and anxiety (Coplan & Armer, 2007). BI and NE are both characterized by fearfulness and anxiety, but NE is also characterized by other dysphoric affects, such as irritability and sadness. In addition, in BI, fear is associated with novel contexts, whereas NE is conceptualized as a generalized trait, with less attention paid to eliciting cues and contexts. Similarly, while BI and high constraint/effortful control are both characterized by caution and restraint, the latter is more generalized, while the former is evident only in unfamiliar contexts (Durbin, Klein, Hayden, Buckley, & Moerk, 2005).\n\nThe construct of BI also differs from approach-withdrawal theories of temperament, despite some conceptual overlap. Kagan’s notion of BI was developed independently from biobehavioral models of motivation and emotional reactivity (e.g. Davidson, 1992; Gray, 1991). For example, Gray’s (1991) model of the Behavioral Inhibition System (BIS) and Behavioral Approach System (BAS) proposes distinct neurobiological systems that underlie motivational behavior. The BAS regulates approach behaviors in response to cues for reward, whereas the BIS activates withdrawal behaviors to in response to cues for punishment, novel stimuli, and non-reward. BI overlaps conceptually with Gray’s BIS. However, unlike the BIS, signals of non-reward should not elicit BI. Moreover, Kagan’s theory is more explicitly developmental and focused on individual differences (Zentner & Bates, 2008).\n\nA series of studies has shown that BI can be observed as early as infancy (Kagan & Snidman, 2004), and appears to have moderate stability from infancy to early childhood (Broberg, Lamb, & Hwang, 1990; Fox, Henderson, Rubin, Calkins, & Schmidt, 2001), early to late childhood (Asendorpf, 1994; Scarpa, Raine, & Venables, 1995), and, to a somewhat smaller extent, from infancy into adolescence (Kagan, Snidman, Kahn, & Towsley, 2007). BI also appears to have a number of neurobiological correlates. For example, behaviorally inhibited infants and preschoolers exhibit greater right than left frontal cortical activity on the electroencephalogram (Calkins, Fox, & Marshall, 1996; Fox et al, 2001), which is also evident in late childhood-early adolescence (McManis, Kagan, Snidman, & Woodward, 2002). In addition, infants and toddlers with BI exhibit heightened startle response (Schmidt & Fox, 1998), and as adolescents they show increased amygdala activation in response to fear stimuli (Perez-Edgar et al., 2007; Schwartz, Wright, Shin, Kagan, & Rauch, 2003). Finally, BI in early childhood appears to be a risk factor for the development of anxiety disorders in middle and late childhood and adolescence (Chronis-Toscano et al., 2009; Hirshfeld-Becker et al., 2008). These findings suggest that BI in early childhood may be a good target for prevention and early intervention programs aimed at anxiety disorders (Rapee, Kennedy, Ingram, Edwards, & Sweeney, 2005).\n\nBI in children is typically assessed in the laboratory by exposing children to a series of novel objects or unfamiliar adults or peers. Indicators of inhibition include a longer latency to approach unfamiliar people or objects, decreased frequency and duration of interaction or play, more referencing and maintaining closer proximity to the caregiver, and fearful or avoidant behavior. However, observational methods can be time-consuming and expensive. Furthermore, no single observational procedure has been accepted as the gold standard and protocols vary widely across different laboratories (Rothbart & Bates, 2006).\n\nWhile structured observations are the standard method of assessing BI, some researchers have used concurrent reports by parents, teachers, and older children, and retrospective reports by adolescents and adults. These measures have several strengths that complement laboratory observations. Questionnaires can capture behaviors across longer intervals than those displayed within a limited observational period. In addition, use of different informants (e.g., parents, teachers) allows for observations across multiple contexts. Further, questionnaires are economical and efficient, and therefore are well suited for screening and as secondary measures in larger studies. However, questionnaires also have significant limitations. They are prone to various biases stemming from differences in frame of reference, interpretation and understanding of questions, and social desirability. Thus, some researchers have strongly argued against the use of parent report in assessing BI (Kagan, 1998). In light of the differing strengths and weaknesses of observational and questionnaire measures, many researchers advocate using both approaches to provide a more comprehensive picture of child temperament (Mangelsdorf, Schoppe, & Buur, 2000; Rothbart & Bates, 2006).\n\nUnfortunately, there are only a few questionnaire measures designed specifically to assess BI in children, and validation data on these measures are limited. The two best-documented measures are the Behavioral Inhibition Scale (BIS; Muris, Meesters, & Spinder, 2003) and the Behavioral Inhibition Questionnaire (BIQ; Bishop, Spence, & McDonald, 2003). The BIS has a parent version and a self report version that can be used for older children. However, all BIS items assess behavior in social contexts; inhibited behaviors in non-social situations are not assessed.\n\nThe BIQ is a more comprehensive parent and teacher rating scale developed for use with preschoolers. The BIQ assesses children’s inhibited behavior in a greater range of contexts than the BIS, including with unfamiliar adults, with unfamiliar peers, in unfamiliar situations, in performance situations, in separation/preschool situations, and with novel physical activities that may entail minor risks. Thus, the BIQ’s six subscales provide good coverage of different aspects of the construct.\n\nUsing a large Australian sample, Bishop et al. (2003) reported that the BIQ had good psychometric properties. Confirmatory factor analyses of mother, father and teacher reports supported a structure consisting of six correlated factors, each corresponding to one of the six contexts assessed by the BIQ’s subscales, all of which also loaded onto a single higher-order construct. Both the parent and teacher versions were found to have acceptable internal consistency, with alphas for the total and factor scores above .80, except for father report on the physical challenge factor (α = .72). Parent reports had satisfactory test-retest reliability (rs ranging from .60–.78 for mothers and .55–.74 for fathers). The agreement between different informants was relatively good, with greater convergence between mother and father (r = .69) than with teacher report (r = .47 and .43 for mother and father). Further, concurrent and construct validity of the BIQ were found to be satisfactory. The BIQ total scores were strongly associated with the inhibition subscale of the Temperament Assessment Battery for Children – Revised (TABC – R; Presley & Martin, 1994), with rs ranging from .85–.87 (all ps < .001). Significant correlations were also found between BIQ ratings from all three informants and observational ratings of BI in a laboratory setting (rs .25–.46 for full sample and .35–.60 for high/low BI groups).\n\nThe goal of the present study is to further examine the structure and psychometric properties of the parent and teacher versions of the BIQ in a large sample of preschool-aged children in the United States. We aim to replicate Bishop et al.’s (2003) findings, and extend them by using a broader range of convergent measures of BI and related constructs and assessing the BIQ’s discriminant validity. First, we assessed the internal consistency of the BIQ. Second, we attempted to replicate the factor structure obtained in the original study. Next, the convergent and discriminant validity of the BIQ were examined using a multitrait-multimethod (MTMM) approach (Campbell & Fiske, 1959). We included traits that were closely related to BI (e.g. fear, shyness) and traits related to low surgency/PE (low positive affect, social disinterest), high NE (e.g., negative emotional reactivity, anger/frustration, sadness), and high constraint (e.g., low impulsivity), that should exhibit some overlap with, but still be relatively distinct from, BI. These analyses included comparisons with other questionnaire measures, a standardized observational protocol, global experimenter ratings, and a semi-structured parent interview.\n\nDiscussion\n\nThe majority of research on childhood BI relies on laboratory observational protocols. Whereas some researchers contend that observational methods are the optimal way of assessing temperament (Kagan, 1998), many maintain that the use of questionnaire measures can add unique and valuable information (e.g., Mangelsdorf et al., 2000; Rothbart & Bates, 2006). However, there are few rating scales specifically designed to assess BI, and research evaluating the psychometric properties of existing measures is limited. The Behavioral Inhibition Questionnaire (BIQ) offers an efficient method of assessing BI across different contexts and different informants. The present study sought to replicate the original report of the BIQ’s psychometric properties (Bishop et al., 2003) and extend their findings by using a U.S. sample and a broader range of measures of convergent validity, and assessing discriminant validity.\n\nOur findings are generally consistent with the initial report demonstrating satisfactory reliability and concurrent validity of the BIQ. We found that both the parent and teacher versions of the BIQ had acceptable internal consistency for total and subscale scores. Also, parent- and teacher-reported total BIQ scores were moderately correlated, although teachers rated children to be more inhibited in unfamiliar peer situation and performance situation than parents. Consistent with Bishop et al. (2003), there were no gender differences on either parent or teacher total BIQ scores. Also consistent with Bishop’s data, we found that girls are more inhibited in physically challenging situations. However, our findings differed on several other subscales. Contrary to the prior study, both parents and teachers reported boys to be more inhibited in performance situations. In addition, we found that parents reported boys to be more inhibited in preschool/separation situations, and we did not replicate Bishop et al.’s finding that girls are more inhibited in unfamiliar adult situations.\n\nConfirmatory factor analysis yielded a structure of six correlated factors loading onto a single general dimension of BI. The fit was acceptable for parent reports, but only marginal for teacher reports. BI responses clustered around the six contexts assessed by the BIQ subscales (approaching peers, approaching unfamiliar adults, performing in front of others, separation and preschool situations, unfamiliar situations in general, and novel physical activities suggestive of minor risks). This is consistent with previous studies suggesting that there may be some context specificity for BI (Kochanska, 1991; Rubin, Hastings, Stewart, Henderson, & Chen, 1997; Stevenson-Hinde, 1989). However, similar to Bishop et al.’s (2003) findings, the six first-order factors loaded significantly onto a single second-order factor, indicating that the BI can be considered a higher-order disposition that is expressed in multiple contexts. Taken together, these findings suggest that while driven by an overall tendency toward BI, the display of inhibited behaviors may vary somewhat as a function of context.\n\nAlthough the six correlated factor model provided the best fit for the teacher ratings, the fit was at best marginal. Inspection of modification indices did not reveal ways to significantly improve model fit. The poorer fit for the teacher, compared to the parent, model may be due to the smaller N, resulting in less stable estimates. In addition, the preschool and daycare settings varied widely in terms of the length of time the teachers/caretakers knew the child, the number of hours of contact per week, and the number of other children in the classroom/daycare, hence the teacher ratings may have included greater measurement error.\n\nEvidence for the convergent and discriminant validity of the BIQ was examined through the use of a multitrait-multimethod approach. Traits that are very closely related to BI (i.e. fear, shyness) as well as those related but conceptually distinct from BI (i.e. low PE, high NE and low constraint) were selected. These variables were assessed using a variety of methods, including parent and teacher questionnaires, a semi-structured diagnostic interview with a parent, behavioral coding of a standardized laboratory observation, and global ratings by an experimenter based on interactions with the child throughout the laboratory session.\n\nParent-reported BIQ showed relatively good convergent and discriminant validity. Fear and shyness as measured by parent questionnaires were used for monotrait-monomethod analyses. High correlations were found between the parent BIQ and the shyness scales from the CBQ (Rothbart, Ahadi, Hersey, & Fisher, 2001) and the CSPS (Coplan et al., 2004). Associations with the CBQ fear subscale was lower and in the moderate range, possibly because the behaviors reflected in the fear scale are not confined to novel situations/stimuli. With regard to monotrait-heteromethod correlations, the BIQ was moderately-highly correlated with interview-based ratings of BI. Given that the interview was based on parent report, the high correlation with the parent BIQ scores was not unexpected. Similar to Bishop et al. (2003), we found low-to moderate correspondence between BIQ scores and behavioral ratings of the Lab-TAB episodes. In addition, we found a moderate association between parent BIQ ratings and experimenters’ global ratings from the laboratory session. Our observational measures were more extensive than Bishop et al.’s (2003) in that their ratings were limited to a stranger-child interaction episode, whereas we also included several episodes in which the child was exposed to novel and mildly frightening or challenging stimuli and used observer’s global ratings in addition to more molecular behavioral ratings. These correlations are consistent with the magnitudes of the associations between observational and parent-report measures of other temperament constructs (e.g., Majdandžić, van den Boom & Heesbeen, 2008).\n\nHeterotrait-monomethod associations were generally smaller than the monotrait-monomethod and monotrait-heteromethod correlations. The largest heterotrait-monomethod correlation was with parent ratings of low PA on the CBQ smiling/laughter scale. As discussed earlier, BI and low PA share common features of low approach/exuberance, but differ in underlying motivations and eliciting contexts (Laptook, Klein, Olino, Dyson, & Carlson, 2010; Polak-Toste & Gunnar, 2006). Lastly, the heterotrait-heteromethod correlations were lower than almost all the other associations.\n\nFor teacher-reported BIQ, the monotrait-monomethod analysis revealed a high correlation with teacher reports of shyness on the CSPS. In the monotrait-heteromethod analyses, teacher BIQ showed low to moderate correlations with interview-based ratings, and somewhat lower associations with experimenters’ global ratings and laboratory observation ratings of BI. Both heterotrait-monomethod and heterotrait-heteromethod correlations varied across traits. Most associations were smaller than the monotrait-monomethod and monotrait-heteromethod correlations, except for the moderate association with social disinterest. This may be due to the difficulty of distinguishing inhibited behavior from low desire for social interaction in a classroom/daycare setting. The core distinction between the two constructs lies in the underlying motivational state, rather than observable behaviors, making it difficult to discern in the absence of close and insightful monitoring. In sum, these results provide preliminary evidence for moderate to high convergent and discriminant validity for the parent and teacher versions of the BIQ.\n\nSeveral limitations of this study should be considered. First, our sample consisted of predominantly middle-class, Caucasian, and non-clinical participants, limiting the generalizability of the results to different populations. Second, our findings are based on cross-sectional data. Future research with longitudinal designs can provide additional information to compare questionnaire and observational methods of assessing BI with regard to temporal stability and predicting the development of anxiety disorders. Third, as we did not obtain teacher reports on the full sample (either because the child was not in preschool/daycare or because the teacher did not complete the BIQ), and teachers’ knowledge of the children varied, we may not have provided as strong a test of the validity of the teacher BIQ as of the parent BIQ. Lastly, while the use of experimenter ratings provided another source of observational data, our interpretations based on these ratings are limited by the low internal consistency and lack of interrater reliability data for this measure. Despite these shortcomings, the present study is noteworthy in that it adds to the limited data on the psychometric properties of the BIQ and extends the findings to a U.S. sample. Additionally, the use of diverse methods for assessing BI, including a semi-structured diagnostic interview as well as experimenter ratings following an extensive observational protocol, extends the evidence for the convergent validity of the BIQ and provides the first examination of the instrument’s discriminant validity.\n\nFor over two decades, numerous studies have explored the nature of BI, particularly its neurobiological correlates, continuity and discontinuity over time, and implications for psychopathology. However, a number of issues need to be addressed in order to expand our understanding of this construct, including further development and validation of assessment measures (Hirshfeld-Becker et al., 2008). Our findings extend Bishop et al.’s (2003) original study by providing further evidence for the reliability and validity of the BIQ as a measure of children’s BI. The BIQ satisfies the need for a brief, economical measure that can be used to complement more expensive and time-consuming laboratory observations. This study adds to the small literature examining the convergence among different methods of assessing BI and provides further support for the view that parents, and to a more limited extent, teachers, can provide reliable and valid reports of preschool children’s BI."
