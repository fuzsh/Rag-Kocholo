        "text": "This will be my 4th year at Terramar and I am so excited to be a part of the Terramar Titans family! I am looking forward to starting my 25th year of teaching! All of my 25 years have been in 4th grade and in the Deer Valley district. I am actually a product of the Deer Valley district, as I attended Bellair, Desert Sky, and Deer Valley High School. I feel honored to teach in the district where I grew up.\n\nAfter high school, I went to Glendale Community College and then transferred to Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, AZ to graduate with a Bachelor's of Science in Education. In May of 2008 I received my Master's in Elementary Education from Northern Arizona University. I have expertise in Kagan learning structures, Thinking Maps, and The Leader In Me. I was honored to be one of the nominees for Deer Valley Teacher of the Year for the 2019-2020 school year.\n\nSome of my hobbies include reading, going on road trips and spending time at home with my family. My favorite types of books to read are autobiographies. This past summer we took a road trip to Illinois. It was a long drive but it was fun seeing all the different landscapes. It was hot and muggy in Illinois but I sure loved all of the green trees, seeing family, and visiting downtown Chicago.\n\nI have been married to my husband Scott for 19 years. We have a 7.5 year old daughter named Hailee. I can't believe the changes we've seen in this last year! Her imagination runs wild and I hope she never loses that! We also have 1 fur baby named Mocha. She is 8.5 year old lab. She is so fun to play with and snuggle up to!\n\nTeaching has been pretty much the only thing I ever wanted to do. I remember playing \"school\" with my stuffed animals when I was little. My mom had bought a huge chalkboard and I used to teach my \"lessons\" to anyone who would listen. As I grew older I thought about going into music as I studied flute in high school and college but I ultimately decided on going into the classroom because I just loved teaching all subjects."
