FPI is, according to its website, \"that promotes continued U.S. engagement -- diplomatic, economic, and military -- in the world and rejection of policies that would lead us down the path to isolationism; robust support for America’s democratic allies and opposition to rogue regimes that threaten American interests; the human rights of those oppressed by their governments, and U.S. leadership in working to spread political and economic freedom; a strong military with the defense budget needed to ensure that America is ready to confront the threats of the 21st century; and, an international economic engagement as a key element of U.S. foreign policy in this time of great economic dislocation.\" [2]\n\nKagan Background\n\nKagan worked at the State Department Bureau of Inter-American Affairs (85-88) and was the principal speech writer for Secretary of State George P. Shultz (84-85). Prior to that, he was foreign policy advisor to Jack Kemp.
