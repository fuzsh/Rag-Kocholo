        "text": "Continued Care During COVID\n\nDespite the sudden onset of the pandemic, preschoolaged children who are enrolled at The Villageâs Early Childhood Learning Center were provided with help with at-home educational opportunities thanks to the commitment of our staff and dedication of their families to remain connected and learning. In no time at all, we introduced virtual home visits to continue connecting with children and families, including developmental screenings, interventions, âsnack and storyâ time, videotaped songs, parenting groups, and preschool activities. Staff also went to every childâs home and delivered literacy kits containing hands-on learning materials as well as supplemental food and hygiene products if needed.\n\nPictured: Shanta Samuels, Village Family Support Specialist I for the Village Reunification and Therapeutic Family Time, program delivers baby supplies to a Village client.\n\nA New Gym for Village Children\n\nThanks to the generosity of philanthropists Jeffrey and Nancy Hoffman and the creativity of ESPN volunteers, a newly renovated gymnasium is now available for children receiving services at The Village. The gym provides a safe, inspirational space for the children to exercise, and is a critical piece of their healing process. The refreshed space at The Villageâs main campus at 1680 Albany Avenue in Hartford, includes a new basketball hoop system and pads, new vinyl flooring, new lighting and upgraded electrical, a new door, a fresh coat of paint and motivational murals.\n\nPictured (l-r): The University of Hartford Spirit team; Galo Rodriguez, Village President and CEO; Yvette Young, Village Associate Vice President for Programs and Advocacy; Nancy and Jeffrey Hoffman, Village donors; Don Brooks, ESPN Manager, Corporate Citizenship; State Representative Joshua Hall; Zack Malet, Disney & ESPN Media Distribution Associate Director; Emmanuel Omokaro, ESPN Corporate Citizenship Coordinator.\n\nPartnering to Help Victims of Domestic Violence\n\nThe pandemic has made the scourge of domestic violence even worse. We are grateful for our newly expanded partnership with Interval House â funded in part through the stateâs Office of Victim Services â which is helping adolescents impacted by domestic violence. Previously, The Village and Interval House had established a similar program for children under six years of age. Our rapid response team is visiting victims in shelters or wherever theyâre staying, connecting them with services, coordinating care and giving them the support they need to live safe lives away from violence. During FY19-20, The Village served 423 young victims.\n\nPictured (l-r): Heather Flannery, Interval House Assistant Director; Mercedes Johnson, Interval House Domestic Violence Hotline Supervisor; Maria Mojica, Interval House Safe House Manager; Karen Gaston, Interval House Family Violence Victim Advocate Site Supervisor and Docket Advocate."
