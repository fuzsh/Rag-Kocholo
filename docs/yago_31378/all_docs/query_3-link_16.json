        "text": "The population of Jerusalem drops significantly in war time, as residents are deported, drafted into military service or labor, and suffer from famine and disease. American Colony members engage in relief efforts and public health and social welfare activities for the local populace during World War I, including operation of a volunteer nursing corps and a supper kitchen. Bertha Vester organizes a sewing school and a women's lace-making cooperative, to help Palestinian women whose husbands are absent during wartime to support their families.\n\nBritish Army officer T. E. Lawrence (Lawrence of Arabia) helps fuel the Arab Revolts against the Ottoman Turks in collaboration with Feisal, Abdullah, Auda Abu Tayi, and other Arab leaders who will feature in the leadership of Arab states after the war's end. T. E. Lawrence is a familiar guest at the American Colony during his time in the Middle East. He is well-liked and known for playing ball with the children on the colony lawn.\n\n1917\n\nThe American Colony Nurses corps is active in several hospitals in Jerusalem. They work with both the Red Crescent and the Red Cross. Many colony members volunteer, among them Olaf and Lars Lind, Bertha and Frederick Vester, and Grace and John D. Whiting.\n\nAmerican Colony photographer Lewis Larsson serves as an official photographer of the Red Crescent. He travels with American Colony photography assistants behind lines of battle, and documents the campaigns in Palestine and Syria. The American Colony produces albums featuring scenes documenting the war and its political aftermath.\n\n1917-1918\n\nJohn D. Whiting begins service as an undercover intelligence officer with the General Headquarters Advance Field Intelligence, British Army. Fluent in Arabic and a frequent traveler, he works under Lieutenant Colonel Wyndham Deedes. Whiting will continue to work in British intelligence at various points in his later life."
