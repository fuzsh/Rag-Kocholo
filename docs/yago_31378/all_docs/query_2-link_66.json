After graduating from the Conservatory, I did another season of acting in the Asolo company. My next career turn took me to teaching, including designing and implementing a summer training program in Lacoste, France for the Savannah College of Art and Design. I then returned to my native Midwest (I really like it there), where I found steady work directing and acting in Kansas City, MO. I’ve had great opportunities to direct some fine actors in that professional community, as well as continuing my life as an actor with the top companies there. Significantly, I’ve gotten to put my Asolo training into my passion, getting to play some great Shakespearean roles with the Heart of America Shakespeare Festival, including, Richard III, Iago, and Leontes, plus a lot more. And then sometimes, I’ve even returned to my roots to do a big musical! For the last five years, I’ve been lucky enough to be on the faculty of the Guthrie Theater/University of Minnesota Actor Training Program. I’m the first year teacher, which I love. Every day, I work with some of the most gifted young talents in the country. And along the way, I got married to a great guy.\n\nClass of 2001: Julia Cook, Gregory Funaro, T.

I moved to NYC in '81, which increased the auditions I could get. I continued in regional theater--I did several shows at the Caldwell Theatre in Boca Raton, very happy to be back in Florida-- and did a tour of Germany and Scandinavia playing Martha in Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf. But most of the time I was the supporting player, the sub-plot. And, in my opinion, those roles are usually the best. I didn't get rich and I didn't get famous, but I got along OK and had a great time. I remarried in 1990 (to the sweetest man in the world) and had a baby (Alexander - he's 22 now) in 1993. We moved to Pennsylvania soon after and I began the second act of my life- being a mother and wife and Administrative Assistant. Not theatre-- but still pretty fabulous. I'm retired now, and enjoy looking back on my years at the Asolo. I keep in touch with my classmates and still consider them my close, dear friends. I am so grateful to Neal, Jimmy, Isa, and Ruby for being encouraging and making sure I had the tools I needed. It's been great!\n\nThe 1979 Class: Porter Anderson, James Baudoin, Richard Belcher, Carolyn Blackinton, Dov Fahrer, Joseph Farrell, Marilyn Foote, Jeff King, Michael Locklair, Mary Anne Mullin, Janet Nawrocki, Cynthia Newman, Evan Parry, Carolyn Rose, Christine Songer, James St. Clair, Annie Stafford.\n\nClass of 1978\n\nMARINA BARRY | After leaving the Asolo, I spent time in Los Angeles, but my heart has always been in New York City and that's where I live ~ Washington Heights to be exact.
