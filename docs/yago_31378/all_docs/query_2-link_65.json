        "text": "Sherrone Moore was named the 21st head coach in Michigan football history on January 26, 2024, following six years as a member of the offensive staff. Moore is the first African American head coach in the history of the program.\n\nBefore he was named head coach, Moore spent three years as the tight ends coach (2018-20), and three years as Donald Graham Offensive Line Coach (2021-23). He was also Sanford Robertson Offensive Coordinator in 2023 after two seasons as co-O.C. (2021-22), leading the Wolverines on the offensive side of the ball during an unprecedented run of success that included three consecutive Big Ten Championships (2021-22-23) and the 2023 National Title.\n\nWhile Moore was coordinating the offense and coaching the line, U-M averaged 38.4 points, 207.5 rushing yards, 3.52 tackles for loss allowed, and 1.18 sacks allowed per game. The offense was a top-15 scoring unit in all three seasons and the rushing offense was top-15 twice while the unit ranked first or second in team rushing touchdowns in all three years. Under Moore, all five of the offensive line starters earned some form of All-Big Ten honors including six different first-team honorees. U-M also became the first program to win back-to-back Joe Moore Awards (2021-22) honoring the top offensive line in college football. U-M was top-five in TFLs allowed twice and top-30 in sacks allowed in all three seasons.\n\nThe line blocked for three straight 1,000-yard backs in Hassan Haskins (1,327 yards, 20 rushing touchdowns, 2021), Blake Corum (1,463, 18, 2022), and Corum again (1,245, 27, 2023). In 2021 and 2022, U-M nearly had a second 1,000-yard back in Corum (952 yards) and Donovan Edwards (991 yards). Moore oversaw the running production of the offensive line as Corum set single-season rushing touchdown (27), total touchdown (28) records in 2023 while he was the only player in FBS to score in every game of the season.\n\nMoore produced four NFL draft picks at tight end (Zach Gentry, fifth round) and offensive line (Olusegun Oluwatimi, fifth; Andrew Stueber, seventh; Ryan Hayes, seventh) as a position coach and helped guide Stueber (second team), Oluwatimi, and Zak Zinter (consensus) to All-American honors, including the Rimington Award winner and Michigan's first Outland Trophy recipient, Oluwatimi (2022).\n\nMoore joined the Wolverine staff after four seasons at Central Michigan (2014-17). He was selected for and participated in the inaugural 35 Under 35 Coaches Leadership Institute sponsored by the American Football Coaches Association at their January 2018 convention. Working as an offensive coach throughout his career, Moore has worked with productive tight end groups at several stops, and his knowledge of the trenches has helped him transition into one of the premier offensive line coaches in the nation.\n\nSix tight ends combined for 119 receptions, 1,611 yards, and 13 touchdowns in Moore's three seasons leading the position group at U-M. Those players had one season with third-team All-Big Ten honors and three seasons with all-conference honorable mention recognition.\n\nMoore mentored the Chippewas tight ends during his four-year stay at CMU (2014-17) and added the duties of assistant head coach and recruiting coordinator during the 2017 season. He produced second-team (Ben McCord) and third-team (Tyler Conklin) All-MAC honorees with Conklin earning an NFL Scouting Combine invitation.\n\nMoore spent five seasons at Louisville before joining the Central Michigan staff. He worked as a graduate assistant coach for three seasons (2009-11) before spending the final two years as the Cardinals' tight end coach (2012-13). During Moore's two seasons as a full-time assistant coach, Louisville had a 23-3 record with a BCS bowl appearance and a Big East title in 2012. As a graduate assistant, Moore helped the Cardinals to a pair of bowl appearances and helped develop All-BIG EAST first-team offensive guard Mark Wetterer. Moore also earned his master's degree in sports administration from Louisville.\n\nMoore played two seasons along the offensive line for the University of Oklahoma (2006-07). He played in 14 games at offensive guard and helped the Sooners win two Big 12 Championships and played in two BCS bowl games. Before joining the Sooners, Moore was a two-year starter at Butler County (Kansas) Community College. He was a member of two conference championship teams the posted a 20-3 record. Moore earned second-team all-conference accolades.\n\nMoore earned his bachelor's degree in communications from Oklahoma in 2008. He and his wife, Kelli, were married in 2015. Together, they have two daughters, Shiloh, and Solei.\n\nTHE MOORE FILE\n\nBirthday: Feb. 3, 1986\n\nHometown: Derby, Kansas\n\nHigh School: Derby\n\nBachelor's Degree: Oklahoma (Communications, 2008)\n\nMaster's Degree: Louisville (Sports Administration, 2011)\n\nWife: Kelli\n\nChildren: Daughters Shiloh, Solei\n\nCOACHING EXPERIENCE"
