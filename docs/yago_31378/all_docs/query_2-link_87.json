        "text": "Fellows\n\nHoover scholars form the Institution’s core and create breakthrough ideas aligned with our mission and ideals. What sets Hoover apart from all other policy organizations is its status as a center of scholarly excellence, its locus as a forum of scholarly discussion of public policy, and its ability to bring the conclusions of this scholarship to a public audience.\n\nView All Fellows\n\nIssue 91\n\nDrones\n\nIssue No. 91 of Strategika features essays that explore the legal framework surrounding the use of drones as weapons, how drones have changed the battlefield (drawing on experiences from the Russia–Ukraine war), and what the use of drones in armed conflict today means for future defense planning.\n\nIssue 90\n\nIranian Proxies\n\nIssue No. 90 of Strategika features three essays stressing that the United States should retaliate more aggressively against Iranian proxy militia groups across the Middle East.In the background essay, Edward Luttwak writes that the Biden White House could deter Iran by massively raising the stakes both militarily and economically of Iran’s proxy militia activity throughout the Middle East. In another essay, Reagan-era defense official Bing West argues that the US should respond with strikes against Houthi missile sites and command centers in western Yemen, with an aim to completely remove the group’s offensive capabilities against shipping in the Red Sea. He also suggests Biden authorize tough enforcement action against Iran’s so-called “ghost fleet” of 300+ tankers used to evade oil sanctions. Next, Jerry Hendrix argues the Biden White House needs to jettison its position that Iran will re-commit to de-escalation and de-nuclearization at the negotiating table. He calls for Biden to order direct strikes against Iran Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) assets, including military targets within Iran.\n\nIssue 88\n\nProxy Wars\n\nIn this issue of Strategika, scholars address the intricate challenges facing the United States amidst Russian aggression and broader global issues. Bing West argues that US reluctance to provide long-range weapons and treating Russia as a nuclear sanctuary weaken Ukraine. West urges decisive American support for the embattled nation. Jerry Hendrix predicts that Ukraine will resort to asymmetric tactics in the war against Russia due to Kyiv's inability to reclaim lost territory. A key Ukrainian strategy, Hendrix asserts, should be to exploit Russian President Vladimir Putin’s political vulnerabilities and delegitimize him as a leader. And Chris Gibson provides a broad perspective about the conflict, warning against unnecessary escalation, while advocating a historical, realist, and diplomatic approach to reshape global alliances and deny Russia’s victory."
