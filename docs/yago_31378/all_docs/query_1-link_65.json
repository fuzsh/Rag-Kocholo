        "text": "Donald Kagan, a Yale historian whose impassioned teaching and writing about the ancient Greeks inspired generations of scholars as well as Washington strategists, including many of the officials who crafted American foreign policy under Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush, died on Aug. 6 at a retirement home in Washington. He was 89.\n\nHis death was confirmed by his son Robert, himself a widely regarded figure in foreign policy circles.\n\nProfessor Kagan was considered among the country’s leading historians. His four-volume account of the Peloponnesian War, from 431 B.C. to 404 B.C., was hailed by the critic George Steiner as “the foremost work of history produced in North America in the 20th century.”\n\nHe was equally renowned for his classroom style, in which he peppered nuanced readings of ancient texts with references to his beloved New York Yankees and inventive, sometimes comic exercises in class participation, like having students form a hoplite phalanx to demonstrate how Greek soldiers marched into combat.\n\nA strong believer in the timeless virtues of Western civilization and the need for countries to project power in a lawless world, Professor Kagan was often categorized as a conservative. He more or less agreed: He called himself a “Harry Truman Democrat,” but by the late 1960s he had come to believe that the Democratic Party, and much of the academic world, had drifted too far to the left.\n\nHe was hard to pin down, though. He disliked Richard Nixon and, more recently, Donald Trump, but he was a fan of Reagan, whose commitment to a strong military and willingness to confront the Soviet Union seemed to him to embody the Greeks’ “mental and intellectual toughness in confronting the human condition.”\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
