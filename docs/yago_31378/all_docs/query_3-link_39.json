        "text": "Phil Baroody\n\nMy Post-Grad Journey:\n\nAfter graduating I earned a Master's Degree in Guidance and Counseling from Rivier College. I was chosen as Counselor of the Year in 1989. I worked as a waiter and bartender for 15 years. I worked as a School Counselor for 43 years with 26 of those spent at West Running Brook Middle School in Derry NH. I coached girls high school basketball for 25 years and served as an Athletic Trainer at my local high school for 25 years. I married Lia Makris in 1986 and we have 3 daughters, 2 of whom graduated from Fairfield. Our other daughter graduated from Sacred Heart. Thankfully, all are gainfully employed. I worked at Camp Fatima, a boys camp in NH, for 20 years. 4 of those years were spent as the Resident Director. In December of 2023, we were blessed with our first grandchild. 2 of our daughters are getting married in the summer of 2024.\n\nWhat is your favorite Fairfield University memory?\n\nI have a lot of great memories and I would say most of them came during the time I was a member of the Glee Club. I made a lot of great friends and got to travel to different parts of the country. One of my fondest memories was visiting and performing at Walter Reed Medical Center. I was also blessed to become friendly with a great group of guys. To this day, we still stay in touch and get together every March to play golf in Florida.\n\nJames Carroll\n\nMy Post-Grad Journey:\n\nLife after Fairfield has had its charmed moments for me; in 1975, I shook Muhammad Ali’s hand before he won the Thrilla in Manila; I watched the Red Sox end the Curse of the Bambino; I tossed an out of bounds ball back to Larry Bird at the Boston Garden; attending his inaugural ball, I danced to Bill Clinton’s saxophone solo; I watched Tom Brady win the Patriots six Superbowls; served as Chairman of the now defunct Bank Of Dad for three sons who became a physical therapist, a lawyer and an orthopedic surgeon. I taught high school science; spent forty years as a trial lawyer starting at the U.S. DOJ followed by private practice. My first novel, Reasonably Foreseeable, a legal thriller, was just published. I never forgot the Jesuit tenet to give back, and I have for the last thirty years been a proud supporter of the Mercy Home for Boys and Girls in Chicago.\n\nWhat is your favorite Fairfield University memory?\n\nMy favorite Fairfield Memories are entwined with my friends from the Class of 1974. The NIT, Jim Croce’s concert, MERP, Frank Johnson’s cadence in intramural football, Frank Galluzo's Sub Shop, and Chris Campbell’s loop of Down by the River night after night freshman year on Gonzaga One.\n\nRosalie Donlon\n\nMy Post-Grad Journey:\n\nMy first job out of school was working as a teller for People’s Bank. In 1975, I married Tom Donlon (Fairfield Prep 1969 and US Coast Guard Academy 1973), and the adventure began. We’ve lived in Ann Arbor, MI; Governors Island, NY; Honolulu; Washington, D.C.; and New London, CT. We had the opportunity to travel to Australia, New Zealand, China and the Philippines as well as Europe and throughout the U.S. I graduated from the Univ. of Toledo College of Law and, after private practice, moved into legal publishing. I have two daughters and a beautiful 16-month-old granddaughter. My family and I live now in Stamford, CT (not too far from Mike O’Rourke, coincidentally) and I'm still writing and editing about legal and insurance issues.\n\nWhat is your favorite Fairfield University memory?\n\nAs part of the first class of women, I was a commuter student. I have great memories of hanging out with Prof. Paul Davis (RIP) and other members of the class in the snack bar. Before a test, you could ask him about a topic and he would say, \"Not on this test. Next question.\"\n\nDennis Dougherty\n\nMy Post-Grad Journey:\n\nStepping away from academia, pulled a geographic to San Fran, became a finance director for a non-profit (TAG), whilst also seeing the underbelly of politics and various money interests in that city. Then jumped into a military venture where an eternal brotherhood developed amongst some of the most dedicated, bravest and outspoken sailors. After that service drifted through different environments and mindsets from the beach, mountains and deserts. Using Fenian roots to survive economically until I found myself in the corporate world though not by my design. With the experiential knowledge of different systems and industries I flourished for a time. Self-realization and awareness of distance from spiritual center and began to incorporate various participatory spiritual experiences from Jesuit Spiritual Practices to indigenous purification lodges, rituals and ceremonies in the Andes and Amazonian jungles. I still practice and incorporate the sacredness of those experiences into my life daily with a deeper understanding of the interconnectedness and vibrational relationship much like the Tiwa’s word for life which encapsulates quantum theory in that “life is that which vibrates”. My greatest journey however is the one I am currently on, a marriage to a woman who motivates, inspires and enlightens me daily.\n\nWhat is your favorite Fairfield University memory?\n\nThe impact of the artistic environment that was a part of the campus background through the Free Press and WVOF\n\nJim Holihan\n\nMy Post-Grad Journey:\n\nMarried for 48 years to Alice, who I met in my first job right after graduation at American Can Hdq in Greenwich. We have 3 children and 7 grandchildren (aged 6 -15) all living in the Rochester NY area. We have many joyful memories of watching them grow up, just by coincidence, when I retired 16 years ago from ExxonMobil, our daughter announced her pregnancy at my retirement dinner. What perfect timing to be able to spend early childhood with each one of the grandkids! We also have enjoyed many great trips in different parts of the world. Have enjoyed playing golf, although my competitive days are waning as my index increases. I had many great experiences working at XOM, with a global staff in 14 cities and 9 countries, however as Dorthy says, \"there's no place like home\".\n\nWhat is your favorite Fairfield University memory?\n\nToo many to list, but Fr. MacDonnell, with his terrific sense of humor and mentoring ability will always be special. Organizing picnics and Math Major parties (including supplying 7oz Reingold nips) is a great example of this!\n\nFrank Johnson\n\nMy Post-Grad Journey:\n\n50 years. I can’t believe it to say the least it has been a marvelous life, Like most people it had had its ups and downs, highs and lows Not very many regrets though. You know married right out of school. Two wonderful kids. But life rears its ugly head, and divorce happens. But as I think of my journey there is one constant, and that is relationships And as I think this through, it’s the friendships that I developed at Fairfield that has really helped me these past 5 decades. In school we lived together. Played together, and studied (?) together. For the next 50 years I have been able to count on my “brothers” thru thick and thin. Thru weddings, children being born, illness and divorce. We have always been there for each other. And it’s not like we lived near one another. Connecticut, Massachusetts, Virginia, Carolina. New York, Florida. We had to work at it. The same in my professional life. Success depends on relationships. Common goals, beliefs, and trust Traits I developed at Fairfield. My professional career was focused on Human Resources and I was fortunate to be able to retire from 2 great organizations. General Motors and the CIA. I never could have imagined it. Personally, I met the love of my life 20 years ago, we got married have a blended family and now have 8 grandchildren. Life is good. Thanks Fairfield and the Jesuits for getting me started down the road And a big thank you to my Fairfield brothers.\n\nLouis Lombard\n\nMy Post-Grad Journey:\n\nAfter graduating from Fairfield University, I took some time to raise a family. My daughter would eventually graduate from Fairfield as well, the class of 96'. I received my Master's Degree in English from Central Ct. State University in 1996 and proceeded to work as an adjunct English professor for fifteen years. During that same period, I taught English course at Naugatuck Valley Community College and Lincoln College. In 2014, I accepted a fulltime position at NVCC. In 2015, I became the First Year Experience Coordinator in addition to my English teaching duties. Subsequently, I have been promoted to Full Professor and have been granted tenure. Three years ago, I was appointed as Chair of the Humanities Department. I also am a Real Estate Broker, licensed in the State of Connecticut since the 1980's.\n\nWhat is your favorite Fairfield University memory?\n\nLiving for three years in Loyola Hall...hanging out with all the guys (Jack, Gerry, Bill, John & Paul) and our RA, Fr. Trinkle.\n\nEd O'Brien\n\nMy Post-Grad Journey:\n\nAfter graduating from Fairfield I attended and graduated from Georgetown University School of Medicine. I completed my medical residency at Hahnemann in Philadelphia and then completed a fellowship in Hematology/Oncology at Penn State Hershey. I have enjoyed a more than 40 year career treating patients with a variety of cancers and blood disorders. I have witnessed great advances though much more is needed. It has been a very rewarding career. When in Philadelphia I met the love of my life Bernice and we have been married over 40 years. We have enjoyed traveling, sporting events and concerts. I have attended baseball games of my beloved Yankees and took delight in witnessing the Bucky Dent home run, although on TV.\n\nWhat is your favorite Fairfield University memory?\n\nMy favorite memories include floor parties, MERP. and hanging out with multiple friends including Bob, Norm, Mark, Gary, Brian and many others. Campus life was great!\n\nMichael O'Rourke\n\nMy Post-Grad Journey:\n\nGraduated and moved to Boston to open a sales office for Collier's Encyclopedia which I had sold door-to-door all 4 years while at Fairfield. I married my college sweetheart, AC Aubuchon from Marymount College in 1975 and will celebrate our 49th anniversary this year in October. Got promoted to GSM in NYC in 1977 and received an Executive MBA from Columbia Univ in 1982 while running 4 offices for PF Collier and MacMillan Publishing. Left the publishing business in 1987 to join Drexel Burnham Lambert as Broker/Financial Advisor, Ran the NYC marathon in 1990 and 5 marathons overall. My wife and I went childless for 17 years and made a pilgrimage to Lourdes, France in 1992 as caregivers for the sick. One month after returning from Lourdes we conceived a son, Connor O'Rourke who was born on March 20th, 1993. Since then, I have been on 15 pilgrimages to Lourdes because you can never stop saying, \" Thank you!\". AC and I were invested into the Order of Malta in 1993 and it represented one of the finest moments because of the people we have met through the Order and the opportunity to co-found Malta House, a sanctuary for homeless pregnant woman in a crisis situation. I have spent the last 18 years with Oppenheimer &Co. Inc. managing a Wealth Mgmt. Team, shamelessly called \"The O'Rourke Group\". Our son, Conor, married Michelle Gordon last June and we enjoy their company immensely. AC and I are still involved with Malta House and I enjoy a round of golf along with reading, reciting and writing poetry. We live in Stamford, CT and always looking to travel and learn!\n\nWhat is your favorite Fairfield University memory?\n\nI have a few \"favorite memories\". I enjoyed my English classes with Fr John McIntyre, S.J., who gave me the book, \"The Educated Imagination\" as a freshman which allowed me to appreciate the insights, vision and imagery of the great poets- which I still enjoy today! I had great fun playing intramural basketball, living on the Beach in the \"Sea Ranch\" as a senior and being captain of the Fairfield U tennis team when we had the best record in 4 years at 11-3. We had great fun and one time made it back in time from a match against Southern Ct to see Loggins and Messina perform in the gym!\n\nBob Rupp\n\nMy Post-Grad Journey:\n\nAmy and I split our time between Jackson Hole, WY and Darien, CT.
