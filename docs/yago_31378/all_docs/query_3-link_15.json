Kagan was born on May 21, 1912, in Whitehouse, New Jersey, her father, Fredrick, was 20, and her mother, Iva, was 18. [1]\n\nShe married John Salvatore Oliver in 1936, when he was 39 and she was 23. [2] Sixteen years her senior, Salvatore was listed as a boarder at her family's home in the 1930 census, when he was 33 and she was 17. Dorothy's parents named a son born in 1923 Salvatore. As this is not a family name on either side, it appears likely he was named after John Salvatore Oliver. [3]\n\nJohn Salvatore and Dorothy made their home in Middlesex County, New jersey and had at least four sons and one daughter. [4]\n\nDorothy died on November 15, 1995, in Perth Amboy, New Jersey, at the age of 83.[5]\n\nResearch Notes\n\nTherre is no FindAGrave Memorial for her and I have not located an online obituary.\n\nSources\n\n↑ 1920 Census: \"1920 United States Federal Census\"\n\nYear: 1920; Census Place: Middlesex, Middlesex, New Jersey; Roll: T625_1055; Page: 14B; Enumeration District: 10\n\nAncestry Sharing Link - Ancestry Record 6061 #111764138 (accessed 24 April 2022)\n\nDorothy Kagan (8), single daughter, in household of Frederick Kagan (28) in Middlesex, Middlesex, New Jersey.
