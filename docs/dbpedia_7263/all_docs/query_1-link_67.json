A Japanese Artist from Sweden\n\nDEFF Research Database (Denmark)\n\nÃrum, Tania\n\n2015-01-01\n\nYoshio Nakajima is an interesting example of the globalisation of art. His education and early work as an artist took place in his native Japan, but continued in Europe where he has spent more than 30 years, mainly in provincial Sweden....\n\nYoshio Nishina father of modern physics in Japan\n\nCERN Document Server\n\nKim, Dong-Won\n\n2007-01-01\n\nYoshio Nishina not only made a great contribution to the emergence of a research network that produced two Nobel prize winners, but he also raised the overall level of physics in Japan. Focusing on his roles as researcher, teacher, and statesman of science, Yoshio Nishina: Father of Modern Physics in Japan analyzes Nishina''s position in and his contributions to the Japanese physics community.After a concise biographical introduction, the book examines Nishina''s family, his early studies, the creation of RIKEN, and the greater Japanese physics community in the early twentieth century. It then focuses on Nishina''s work at the Cavendish Laboratory and at the University of GÃ¶ttingen as well as his more fruitful research at Niels Bohr''s Institute of Theoretical Physics in Copenhagen. The book also describes the establishment of the Nishina Laboratory at RIKEN, the collaboration between its experimentalists and theoreticians, and the cosmic ray research of its scientists. The last two chapters discuss Nishina'...\n\nA Data-origin Authentication Protocol Based on ONOS Cluster\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nQin Hua\n\n2016-01-01\n\nFull Text Available This paper is aim to propose a data-origin authentication protocol based on ONOS cluster. ONOS is a SDN controller which can work under a distributed environment. However, the security of an ONOS cluster is seldom considered, and the communication in an ONOS cluster may suffer from lots of security threats. In this paper, we used a two-tier self-renewable hash chain for identity authentication and data-origin authentication. We analyse the security and overhead of our proposal and made a comparison with current security measure. It showed that with the help of our proposal, communication in an ONOS cluster could be protected from identity forging, replay attacks, data tampering, MITM attacks and repudiation, also the computational overhead would decrease apparently.\n\ncis-dioxomolybdenum(VI)-(ONO)\n\nIndian Academy of Sciences (India)\n\nVarious ONO type Schiff base ligands L(H)2 used for the preparation of ... and derivatives.6â33 Depending on the method of prepa- ration ....

The hydrodynamic equations, being written for the density and velocity fields of the liquid, are shown to be a bidirectional analog of the Benjamin-Ono equation. The latter is known to describe internal waves of deep stratified fluids. We show that the bidirectional Benjamin-Ono equation appears as a real reduction of the modified KP hierarchy. We derive the chiral nonlinear equation which appears as a chiral reduction of the bidirectional equation. The conventional Benjamin-Ono equation is a degeneration of the chiral nonlinear equation at large density. We construct multi-phase solutions of the bidirectional Benjamin-Ono equations and of the chiral nonlinear equations\n\nStratospheric BrONO2 observed by MIPAS\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nH. Fischer\n\n2009-03-01\n\nFull Text Available The first measurements of stratospheric bromine nitrate (BrONO2 are reported. Bromine nitrate has been clearly identified in atmospheric infrared emission spectra recorded with the Michelson Interferometer for Passive Atmospheric Sounding (MIPAS aboard the European Envisat satellite, and stratospheric concentration profiles have been determined for different conditions (day and night, different latitudes. The BrONO2 concentrations show strong day/night variations, with much lower concentrations during the day. Maximum volume mixing ratios observed during night are 20 to 25 pptv. The observed concentration profiles are in agreement with estimations from photochemical models and show that the current understanding of stratospheric bromine chemistry is generally correct.\n\nWake-promoting effects of ONO-4127Na, a prostaglandin DP1 receptor antagonist, in hypocretin/orexin deficient narcoleptic mice.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nSagawa, Yohei; Sato, Masatoshi; Sakai, Noriaki; Chikahisa, Sachiko; Chiba, Shintaro; Maruyama, Takashi; Yamamoto, Junki; Nishino, Seiji\n\n2016-11-01\n\nProstaglandin (PG)D2 is an endogenous sleep substance, and a series of animal studies reported that PGD2 or PGD2 receptor (DP1) agonists promote sleep, while DP1 antagonists promote wakefulness. This suggests the possibility of use of PG DP1 antagonists as wake-promoting compounds. We therefore evaluated the wake-promoting effects of ONO-4127Na, a DP1 antagonist, in a mouse model of narcolepsy (i.e., orexin/ataxin-3 transgenic mice) and compared those to effects of modafinil. ONO-4127Na perfused in the basal forebrain (BF) area potently promoted wakefulness in both wild type and narcoleptic mice, and the wake-promoting effects of ONO-4127Na at 2.93Â ÃÂ 10(-4)Â M roughly corresponded to those of modafinil at 100Â mg/kg (p.o.). The wake promoting effects of ONO-4127Na was observed both during light and dark periods, and much larger effects were seen during the light period when mice slept most of the time. ONO-4127Na, when perfused in the hypothalamic area, had no effects on sleep. We further demonstrated that wake-promoting effects of ONO-4127Na were abolished in DP1 KO mice, confirming that the wake-promoting effect of ONO-4127Na is mediated by blockade of the PG DP1 receptors located in the BF area. ONO-4127Na reduced DREM, an EEG/EMG assessment of behavioral cataplexy in narcoleptic mice, suggesting that ONO-4127Na is likely to have anticataplectic effects. DP1 antagonists may be a new class of compounds for the treatment of narcolepsy-cataplexy, and further studies are warranted. Copyright Â© 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Recently, pan-TRK inhibitors have been evaluated and their dramatic clinical activity is being shown for a variety of cancer types harboring an NTRK rearrangement in phase I trials. ONO-7579 is an oral pan-TRK inhibitor currently under investigation in phase I/II clinical trial for TRK-rearranged solid tumors. In this study, we evaluated the anticancer effect of ONO-7579 using GBC cells with or without KRAS mutant, NOZ, TYGBK-1. Our study showed that ONO-7579 had a suppressive effect on GBC proliferation in TYGBK-1, and on invasive potential and vascular endothelial growth factor expression in TYGBK-1 and NOZ. Our data indicated that ONO-7579 could be a promising treatment option for patients with GBC. CopyrightÂ© 2018, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.

CF3CH(ONO)CF3 photolysis is a convenient source of OH radicals in the studies of the yields of CO, CO2, HCHO, and HC(O)OH products which can be difficult to measure using more conventional OH radical sources (e.g., CH3ONO photolysis).

The ONO structures analyzed in our study are fabricated in a rapid thermal processing reactor (RTP) using oxygen and ammonium ambients. Typical data for the sequential processing mode are: rapid thermal oxidation (RTO) in oxygen atmosphere at 1100degC and rapid thermal nitridation in ammonium atmosphere (RTN) at 1050degC followed by RTO at 1150degC. Due to the complexity of the growth process it is very important to verify the resulting layers with analytical methods. The whole structure is only about 250 A thick. To analyse the sequence, composition and thickness of the layers, the depth resolution of SIMS is necessary. On the other hand, for quantification, RBS and NRA can be used. When the bulk signal is suppressed by channelling, the signal of oxygen, and in special cases nitrogen, can be evaluated from the He + backscattering spectrum. For nuclear reaction analysis, the reactions of nitrogen with deuterium are used. The combination of SIMS and the accelerator techniques allow quantitative analysis and depth profiling of this structure.

This study investigated the effects of neutrophil elastase on organ injury after unilateral lung acid instillation by administrating a specific neutrophil elastase inhibitor, ONO-5046, before acid instillation. Three groups of anesthetized rabbits (n = 12 in each group) underwent tracheostomies, and instillations were made into their right lower lobe airspaces with either phosphate buffered saline (pH, 7.4; volume, 1.2 ml/kg; n = 12) or HCl (pH, 1.25; volume, 1.2 ml/kg; n = 24). In half of the acid-instilled rabbits, ONO-5046, 10 mg/kg, was given intravenously 15 min before the HCl instillation, and then 10 mg x kg(-1) x h(-1) of the drug was continuously infused throughout the experiment. The other groups of animals received the vehicle intravenously. Anesthesia and mechanical ventilation was continued for 8 h, whereas arterial blood gases were sampled intermittently. Eight hours after saline or acid instillation, the animals were killed, and their lungs, heart, kidneys, liver, and small intestines were harvested. Wet-to-dry weight ratios (W/ D) and myeloperoxidase (MPO) assays of these organs were done, and elastase assays on the bronchoalveolar lavage fluids (BALF) obtained from each lung also were performed. Pretreatment with ONO-5046 attenuated the physiologic changes seen in the vehicle-treated animals. Significant decreases in W/D of the noninstilled lungs and of the small intestine and normalization of the oxygenation of the experimental animals occurred. The ONO-5046 pretreatment did not affect the neutrophil sequestration in the lungs or in the other organs as determined by neutrophil counts in BALF and by the MPO assays. A neutrophil elastase inhibitor, ONO-5046, administered immediately before acid instillation attenuated the physiologic changes seen in the vehicle-treated animals. The drug blocked neutrophil elastase but\n\nExploring crosstalk noise generated in the N-port router used in the WDM-based ONoC\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nZhang, Zhendong; Xie, Yiyuan; Song, Tingting; He, Chao; Li, Jiachao; Liu, Yong\n\n2017-07-01\n\nCompared with optical network-on-chip (ONoC) with single wavelength, ONoC adopting wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) technology possesses a very prominent advantage-higher bandwidth. Therefore, WDM-based ONoC has been considered one of the most promising ways to relieve the rapidly increasing traffic load in communication systems. A WDM-based router, as the core equipment of WDM-based ONoC, is influenced by crosstalk noise, especially the nonlinear crosstalk noise generated by the four-wave mixing effect. Thus, to explore the performance of the N-port nonblocking optical router using WDM, we propose a universal analytic model to analyze the transmission loss, crosstalk noise, optical signal-to-noise ratio (OSNR), and bit error ratio (BER). The research results show that crosstalk noise varies along with signals at different wavelengths in the same channel. For signals with the same wavelength, the noises generated in the different transmission paths are obviously different from each other. For research of transmission loss, OSNR, and BER, similar results can be obtained. Based on the eye diagrams, we can learn that crosstalk noise will cause signal distortion to a certain extent. With this model, capability of this kind of multiport optical router using WDM can be understood conveniently.\n\nIntegrable Hierarchy of the Quantum Benjamin-Ono Equation\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nMaxim Nazarov\n\n2013-12-01\n\nFull Text Available A hierarchy of pairwise commuting Hamiltonians for the quantum periodic Benjamin-Ono equation is constructed by using the Lax matrix. The eigenvectors of these Hamiltonians are Jack symmetric functions of infinitely many variables x_1,x_2,â¦. This construction provides explicit expressions for the Hamiltonians in terms of the power sum symmetric functions p_n=x^n_1+x^n_2+â¯ and is based on our recent results from [Comm. Math. Phys. 324 (2013, 831-849].\n\nReduction of metastasis, cell invasion, and adhesion in mouse osteosarcoma by YM529/ONO-5920-induced blockade of the Ras/MEK/ERK and Ras/PI3K/Akt pathway\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nTsubaki, Masanobu; Satou, Takao; Itoh, Tatsuki; Imano, Motohiro; Ogaki, Mitsuhiko; Yanae, Masashi; Nishida, Shozo\n\n2012-01-01\n\nOsteosarcoma is one of the most common primary malignant bone tumors in children and adolescents. Some patients continue to have a poor prognosis, because of the metastatic disease. YM529/ONO-5920 is a nitrogen-containing bisphosphonate that has been used for the treatment of osteoporosis. YM529/ONO-5920 has recently been reported to induce apoptosis in various tumors including osteosarcoma. However, the mode of metastasis suppression in osteosarcoma by YM529/ONO-5920 is unclear. In the present study, we investigated whether YM529/ONO-5920 inhibited tumor cell migration, invasion, adhesion, or metastasis in the LM8 mouse osteosarcoma cell line. We found that YM529/ONO-5920 significantly inhibited metastasis, cell migration, invasion, and adhesion at concentrations that did not have antiproliferative effects on LM8 cells. YM529/ONO-5920 also inhibited the mRNA expression and protein activities of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). In addition, YM529/ONO-5920 suppressed phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) and the serine/threonine protein kinase B (Akt) by the inhibition of Ras prenylation. Moreover, U0126, a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) 1/2 inhibitor, and LY294002, a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor, also inhibited LM8 cell migration, invasion, adhesion, and metastasis, as well as the mRNA expression and protein activities of MMP-1, MMP-2, MMP-9, and MT1-MMP. The results indicated that YM529/ONO-5920 suppressed the Ras/MEK/ERK and Ras/PI3K/Akt pathways, thereby inhibiting LM8 cell migration, invasion, adhesion, and metastasis. These findings suggest that YM529/ONO-5920 has potential clinical applications for the treatment of tumor cell metastasis in osteosarcoma. -- Highlights: âº We investigated whether YM529/ONO-5920 inhibited tumor metastasis in osteosarcoma. âº YM529/ONO-5920 inhibited metastasis, cell migration, invasion, and adhesion. âº YM529/ONO-5920 suppressed Ras signalings. âº YM529/ONO-5920\n\nOptimized ONO thickness for multi-level and 2-bit/cell operation for wrapped-select-gate (WSG) SONOS memory\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nWu, Woei-Cherng; Chao, Tien-Sheng; Yang, Tsung-Yu; Peng, Wu-Chin; Yang, Wen-Luh; Chen, Jian-Hao; Ma, Ming Wen; Lai, Chao-Sung; Lee, Chien-Hsing; Hsieh, Tsung-Min; Liou, Jhyy Cheng; Chen, Tzu Ping; Chen, Chien Hung; Lin, Chih Hung; Chen, Hwi Huang; Ko, Joe\n\n2008-01-01\n\nIn this paper, highly reliable wrapped-select-gate (WSG) siliconâoxideânitrideâoxideâsilicon (SONOS) memory cells with multi-level and 2-bit/cell operation have been successfully demonstrated. The source-side injection mechanism for WSG-SONOS memory with different ONO thickness was thoroughly investigated. The different programming efficiencies of the WSG-SONOS memory under different ONO thicknesses are explained by the lateral electrical field extracted from the simulation results. Furthermore, multi-level storage is easily obtained, and good V TH distribution presented, for the WSG-SONOS memory with optimized ONO thickness. High program/erase speed (10 Âµs/5 ms) and low programming current (3.5 ÂµA) are used to achieve the multi-level operation with tolerable gate and drain disturbance, negligible second-bit effect, excellent data retention and good endurance performance\n\nTime-periodic solutions of the Benjamin-Ono equation\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nAmbrose , D.M.; Wilkening, Jon\n\n2008-04-01\n\nWe present a spectrally accurate numerical method for finding non-trivial time-periodic solutions of non-linear partial differential equations. The method is based on minimizing a functional (of the initial condition and the period) that is positive unless the solution is periodic, in which case it is zero. We solve an adjoint PDE to compute the gradient of this functional with respect to the initial condition. We include additional terms in the functional to specify the free parameters, which, in the case of the Benjamin-Ono equation, are the mean, a spatial phase, a temporal phase and the real part of one of the Fourier modes at t = 0. We use our method to study global paths of non-trivial time-periodic solutions connecting stationary and traveling waves of the Benjamin-Ono equation. As a starting guess for each path, we compute periodic solutions of the linearized problem by solving an infinite dimensional eigenvalue problem in closed form. We then use our numerical method to continue these solutions beyond the realm of linear theory until another traveling wave is reached (or until the solution blows up). By experimentation with data fitting, we identify the analytical form of the solutions on the path connecting the one-hump stationary solution to the two-hump traveling wave. We then derive exact formulas for these solutions by explicitly solving the system of ODE's governing the evolution of solitons using the ansatz suggested by the numerical simulations.\n\nTime-periodic solutions of the Benjamin-Ono equation\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nAmbrose, D.M.; Wilkening, Jon\n\n2008-01-01\n\nWe present a spectrally accurate numerical method for finding non-trivial time-periodic solutions of non-linear partial differential equations.

ONO-AE1-329 was intravenously administered in doses of 0.3, 1 and 3 ng/kg/min for 10 min with a pause of 20 min. Dopamine in a dose of 3 Âµg/kg/min for 10 min, dobutamine in a dose of 1 Âµg/kg/min for 10 min and milrinone in a dose of 5 Âµg/kg/min for 10 min followed by 0.5 Âµg/kg/min for 10 min were intravenously administered. Low dose of ONO-AE1-329 increased the stroke volume. Middle dose of ONO-AE1-329 increased the cardiac output, left ventricular end-diastolic volume, ejection fraction, maximum upstroke/downstroke velocities of the left ventricular pressure and external work, but decreased the end-systolic pressure and internal work besides the change by the low dose. High dose of ONO-AE1-329 increased the heart rate and maximum elastance, but decreased the end-systolic volume besides the changes by the middle dose. Dopamine, dobutamine and milrinone exerted essentially similar cardiac effects to ONO-AE1-329, but they did not significantly change the end-diastolic volume, end-systolic volume, stroke volume, ejection fraction, end-systolic pressure, maximum elastance, external work or internal work. Thus, EP4-receptor stimulation by ONO-AE1-329 may have potential to better promote the passive ventricular filling than the conventional cardiotonic drugs, which could become a candidate of novel therapeutic strategy for the treatment of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction.

One objective of this study was to investigate if this ion exhibits the properties of both a cluster ion and a protonated acid in their reactions with a variety of organic molecules. The chosen reactant molecules comprise two each of the following types--amines, terpenes, aromatic hydrocarbons, esters, carboxylic acids, ketones, aldehydes and alcohols. The reactant H2ONO+ (NO+H2O) ions are formed in a discharge ion source and injected into helium carrier gas where they are partially vibrationally excited and partially dissociated to NO+ ions. Hence, the reactions of the H2ONO+ ions had to be studies simultaneously with NO+ ions, the reactions of the latter ions readily being studied by selectively injecting NO+ ions into the carrier gas. The results of this study indicate that the H2ONO+ ions undergo a wide variety of reaction processes that depend on the properties of the reactant molecules such as their ionisation energies and proton affinities. These processes include charge transfer with compounds, M, that have low ionisation energies (producing M+), proton transfer with compounds possessing large proton affinities (MH+), hydride ion transfer (M---H+), alkyl radical (M---R+), alkoxide radical transfer (M---OR+), ion-molecule association (NO+H2OM) and ligand switching (NO+M), producing the ions given in parentheses.\n\nA slow-releasing form of prostacyclin agonist (ONO1301SR) enhances endogenous secretion of multiple cardiotherapeutic cytokines and improves cardiac function in a rapid-pacing-induced model of canine heart failure.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nShirasaka, Tomonori; Miyagawa, Shigeru; Fukushima, Satsuki; Saito, Atsuhiro; Shiozaki, Motoko; Kawaguchi, Naomasa; Matsuura, Nariaki; Nakatani, Satoshi; Sakai, Yoshiki; Daimon, Takashi; Okita, Yutaka; Sawa, Yoshiki\n\n2013-08-01\n\nCardiac functional deterioration in dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is known to be reversed by intramyocardial up-regulation of multiple cardioprotective factors, whereas a prostacyclin analog, ONO1301, has been shown to paracrinally activate interstitial cells to release a variety of protective factors. We here hypothesized that intramyocardial delivery of a slow-releasing form of ONO1301 (ONO1301SR) might activate regional myocardium to up-regulate cardiotherapeutic factors, leading to regional and global functional recovery in DCM. ONO1301 elevated messenger RNA and protein level of hepatocyte growth factor, vascular endothelial growth factor, and stromal-derived factor-1 of normal human dermal fibroblasts in a dose-dependent manner in vitro. Intramyocardial delivery of ONO1301SR, which is ONO1301 mixed with polylactic and glycolic acid polymer (PLGA), but not that of PLGA only, yielded significant global functional recovery in a canine rapid pacing-induced DCM model, assessed by echocardiography and cardiac catheterization (n = 5 each). Importantly, speckle-tracking echocardiography unveiled significant regional functional recovery in the ONO1301-delivered territory, consistent to significantly increased vascular density, reduced interstitial collagen accumulation, attenuated myocyte hypertrophy, and reversed mitochondrial structure in the corresponding area. Intramyocardial delivery of ONO1301SR, which is a PLGA-coated slow-releasing form of ONO1301, up-regulated multiple cardiotherapeutic factors in the injected territory, leading to region-specific reverse left ventricular remodeling and consequently a global functional recovery in a rapid-pacing-induced canine DCM model, warranting a further preclinical study to optimize this novel drug-delivery system to treat DCM.

A system of five quasilinear first-order partial differential equations is derived. The system describes modulations of the traveling wave solutions of the 2DBO equation. These equations are transformed to a singularity-free hydrodynamic-like system referred to here as the 2DBO-Whitham system.

In the 100 mg/kg/day group, bradypnea or dyspnea was seen in all animals, pale in ear, eye and foot, tremor, reddish lacrimation and loss of righting reflex were also observed in some animals right after administration, and then those signs disappeared within 1 min after administration. During the treatment period, 3/20 animals of each sex in the 100 mg/kg/day showed clonic convulsion and died within 2 min after administration. No clinical changes were seen in the 50 mg/kg/day group or lower. Histopathological findings showed atrophy of the submaxillary gland in females and vessel-wall thickening and perivascular fibrosis of the injection site (tail) in both sexes at 100 mg/kg/day, however those changes were reversible. ONO-1101 did not effect on body weight, food consumption, ophthalmology, urinalysis, hematology, blood chemistry, organ weights or necropsy at any doses. These results indicate that the no-adverse-effect level of ONO-1101 in rats is 50 mg/kg/day for both sexes in this study.\n\nNitrogen-containing bisphosphonate, YM529/ONO-5920 (a novel minodronic acid), inhibits RANKL expression in a cultured bone marrow stromal cell line ST2\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nNishida, Shozo; Tsubaki, Masanobu; Hoshino, Mayumi; Namimatsu, Ayumi; Uji, Hiromi; Yoshioka, Shohei; Tanimori, Yoshihiro; Yanae, Masashi; Iwaki, Masahiro; Irimajiri, Kiyohiro\n\n2005-01-01\n\nIncrease in bone resorption by osteoclasts can cause metabolic bone diseases, such as osteoporosis. Recent attention has been paid to the receptor activator of the NF-ÎºB ligand (RANKL), an accelerator of osteoclast differentiation. RANKL is expressed on the bone marrow-derived stromal cell membrane and induces the differentiation of osteoclasts by binding to RANK expressed on the osteoclast precursor cell membrane. Since the inhibition of RANKL expression can lead to the inhibition of osteoclastic bone resorption, the clinical application of RANKL inhibition could be expected to have a major effect on metabolic bone disease therapy. In this study, we investigated whether or not YM529/ONO-5920, a nitrogen-containing bisphosphonate (a novel minodronic acid), inhibits RANKL expression in a bone marrow-derived stromal cell line (ST2 cells). Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction revealed that the administration of YM529/ONO-5920 to ST2 cells inhibited RANKL mRNA expression and reduced RANKL proteins as assessed by Western blot analysis. The inhibition of RANKL mRNA expression was reversed when geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP), an intermediate in the mevalonate pathway, was used in combination. Furthermore, YM529/ONO-5920 reduced phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2), and similarly, U0126, a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 1/2 inhibitor, inhibited RANKL expression. Pretreatment with GGPP reversed the YM529/ONO-5920-induced decrease in phosphorylation of ERK. Furthermore, YM529/ONO-5920 decreased TRAP-positive cells in co-culture of ST2 cells and an osteoclast cell line, C7 cells, and this decrease was inhibited by pretreatment with GGPP. This indicates that YM529/ONO-5920 inhibits GGPP biosynthesis in the mevalonate pathway and then signal transduction in the Ras-mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway, thereby inhibiting RANKL expression on ST2 cells. These results suggest a newly elucidated action of bisphosphonates in\n\n[Toxicity studies of landiolol hydrochloride (ONO-1101) (1). Single intravenous toxicity study in rats and dogs].\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nYamaguchi, K; Kasahara, T; Yanagisawa, Y; Nanba, T; Aze, Y; Shinomiya, K; Yonezawa, H; Fujita, T\n\n1997-12-01\n\nSingle dose toxicity studies of landiolol hydrochloride (ONO-1101), a novel ultra short acting beta-blocker, were conducted in Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats and beagle dogs. ONO-1101 was administered intravenously at a dose level of 37.5, 75, 150 or 300 mg/kg to rats of both sexes and 25, 50 or 100 mg/kg to male dogs. In the rat study, 5/6 males in the 150 mg/kg group and all animals in the 300 mg/kg group died during or right after administration. Survivors in the 150 mg/kg group showed temporal hypoactivity, bradypnea, dyspnea, tremor, loss of righting reflex and reddish lacrimation up to 5 min after injection. One male in the 150 mg/kg group had a tendency of suppression on body weight gain. No effects on clinical signs and body weight gain were seen in the 75 mg/kg group or lower. Necropsy findings showed only red tear in the majority of the decedents. In the dog study, all animals died within 6 min after administration in the 100 mg/kg group, showed ataxic gait, rolling and tachypnea followed by bradypnea and gasping/apnea. Incontinence of urine, defecation and vocalization were also seen in each one of two animals before death. Temporal hypoactivity was seen 1 min after administration in the 50 mg/kg group. No clinical signs were seen in the 25 mg/kg group. ONO-1101 did not affect bodyweight or food consumption. Necropsy findings of the decedents showed no abnormalities. It is indicated that the minimum lethal doses are 150 mg/kg in rats and 100 mg/kg in dogs.\n\nStructural stability and chaotic solutions of perturbed Benjamin-Ono equations\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nBirnir, B.; Morrison, P.J.\n\n1986-11-01\n\nA method for proving chaos in partial differential equations is discussed and applied to the Benjamin-Ono equation subject to perturbations. The perturbations are of two types: one that corresponds to viscous dissipation, the so-called Burger's term, and one that involves the Hilbert transform and has been used to model Landau damping. The method proves chaos in the PDE by proving temporal chaos in its pole solutions. The spatial structure of the pole solutions remains intact, but their positions are chaotic in time. Melnikov's method is invoked to show this temporal chaos. It is discovered that the pole behavior is very sensitive to the Burger's perturbation, but is quite insensitive to the perturbation involving the Hilbert transform\n\nObserved and simulated time evolution of HCl, ClONO2, and HF total column abundances\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nB.-M. Sinnhuber\n\n2012-04-01\n\nFull Text Available Time series of total column abundances of hydrogen chloride (HCl, chlorine nitrate (ClONO2, and hydrogen fluoride (HF were determined from ground-based Fourier transform infrared (FTIR spectra recorded at 17 sites belonging to the Network for the Detection of Atmospheric Composition Change (NDACC and located between 80.05Â° N and 77.82Â° S. By providing such a near-global overview on ground-based measurements of the two major stratospheric chlorine reservoir species, HCl and ClONO2, the present study is able to confirm the decrease of the atmospheric inorganic chlorine abundance during the last few years. This decrease is expected following the 1987 Montreal Protocol and its amendments and adjustments, where restrictions and a subsequent phase-out of the prominent anthropogenic chlorine source gases (solvents, chlorofluorocarbons were agreed upon to enable a stabilisation and recovery of the stratospheric ozone layer. The atmospheric fluorine content is expected to be influenced by the Montreal Protocol, too, because most of the banned anthropogenic gases also represent important fluorine sources. But many of the substitutes to the banned gases also contain fluorine so that the HF total column abundance is expected to have continued to increase during the last few years. The measurements are compared with calculations from five different models: the two-dimensional Bremen model, the two chemistry-transport models KASIMA and SLIMCAT, and the two chemistry-climate models EMAC and SOCOL. Thereby, the ability of the models to reproduce the absolute total column amounts, the seasonal cycles, and the temporal evolution found in the FTIR measurements is investigated and inter-compared. This is especially interesting because the models have different architectures. The overall agreement between the measurements and models for the total column abundances and the seasonal cycles is good. Linear trends of HCl, ClONO2, and HF are calculated from both\n\nPI3KÎ´ inhibitor idelalisib in combination with BTK inhibitor ONO/GS-4059 in diffuse large B cell lymphoma with acquired resistance to PI3KÎ´ and BTK inhibitors.\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nAnella Yahiaoui\n\nFull Text Available Activated B-cell-like diffuse large B-cell lymphoma relies on B-cell receptor signaling to drive proliferation and survival. Downstream of the B-cell receptor, the key signaling kinases Bruton's tyrosine kinase and phosphoinositide 3-kinase Î´ offer opportunities for therapeutic intervention by agents such as ibrutinib, ONO/GS-4059, and idelalisib. Combination therapy with such targeted agents could provide enhanced efficacy due to complimentary mechanisms of action. In this study, we describe both the additive interaction of and resistance mechanisms to idelalisib and ONO/GS-4059 in a model of activated B-cell-like diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Significant tumor regression was observed with a combination of PI3KÎ´ and Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitors in the mouse TMD8 xenograft. Acquired resistance to idelalisib in the TMD8 cell line occurred by loss of phosphatase and tensin homolog and phosphoinositide 3-kinase pathway upregulation, but not by mutation of PIK3CD. Sensitivity to idelalisib could be restored by combining idelalisib and ONO/GS-4059. Further evaluation of targeted inhibitors revealed that the combination of idelalisib and the phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 inhibitor GSK2334470 or the AKT inhibitor MK-2206 could partially overcome resistance. Characterization of acquired Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitor resistance revealed a novel tumor necrosis factor alpha induced protein 3 mutation (TNFAIP3 Q143*, which led to a loss of A20 protein, and increased p-IÎºBÎ±. The combination of idelalisib and ONO/GS-4059 partially restored sensitivity in this resistant line. Additionally, a mutation in Bruton's tyrosine kinase at C481F was identified as a mechanism of resistance. The combination activity observed with idelalisib and ONO/GS-4059, taken together with the ability to overcome resistance, could lead to a new therapeutic option in activated B-cell-like diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.

With the Taylor expansion and the ChapmanâEnskog expansion, the governing evolution equation is recovered correctly from the continuous Boltzmann equation. The equilibrium distribution function and the amending function are obtained. Numerical simulations are carried out for the 'good' Boussinesq equation and the 'bad' one to validate the proposed model. It is found that the numerical results agree well with the analytical solutions. The present model can be used to solve more kinds of nonlinear partial differential equations\n\nFY 1998 annual report on the fourth international forum on environmental catalysis (IFEC 99); Dai 4 kai kankyo shokubai kokusai forum (IFEC '99) 1998 nendo hokokusho\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nNONE\n\n1999-03-01\n\nThe 4th international forum on environmental catalysis, held in January 1999 in Chemical Society of Japan's Hall, had a total attendees exceeding 170, including 10 foreign attendees invited.

Raspollini\n\n2008-07-01\n\nFull Text Available The Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment (ACE satellite was launched on 12 August 2003. Its two instruments measure vertical profiles of over 30 atmospheric trace gases by analyzing solar occultation spectra in the ultraviolet/visible and infrared wavelength regions. The reservoir gases HNO3, ClONO2, and N2O5 are three of the key species provided by the primary instrument, the ACE Fourier Transform Spectrometer (ACE-FTS. This paper describes the ACE-FTS version 2.2 data products, including the N2O5 update, for the three species and presents validation comparisons with available observations. We have compared volume mixing ratio (VMR profiles of HNO3, ClONO2, and N2O5 with measurements by other satellite instruments (SMR, MLS, MIPAS, aircraft measurements (ASUR, and single balloon-flights (SPIRALE, FIRS-2. Partial columns of HNO3 and ClONO2 were also compared with measurements by ground-based Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR spectrometers. Overall the quality of the ACE-FTS v2.2 HNO3 VMR profiles is good from 18 to 35 km. For the statistical satellite comparisons, the mean absolute differences are generally within Â±1 ppbv Â±20% from 18 to 35 km. For MIPAS and MLS comparisons only, mean relative differences lie withinÂ±10% between 10 and 36 km. ACE-FTS HNO3 partial columns (~15â30 km show a slight negative bias of â1.3% relative to the ground-based FTIRs at latitudes ranging from 77.8Â° Sâ76.5Â° N. Good agreement between ACE-FTS ClONO2 and MIPAS, using the Institut fÃ¼r Meteorologie und Klimaforschung and Instituto de AstrofÃ­sica de AndalucÃ­a (IMK-IAA data processor is seen. Mean absolute differences are typically within Â±0.01 ppbv between 16 and 27 km and less than +0.09 ppbv between 27 and 34 km. The ClONO2 partial column comparisons show varying degrees of agreement, depending on the location and the quality of the FTIR measurements. Good agreement was found for the comparisons with the midlatitude Jungfraujoch partial columns for which\n\nControl and Stabilization of the Benjamin-Ono Equation in {L^2({{T})}}\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nLaurent, Camille; Linares, Felipe; Rosier, Lionel\n\n2015-12-01\n\nWe study the control and stabilization of the Benjamin-Ono equation in {L^2({T})}, the lowest regularity where the initial value problem is well-posed. This problem was already initiated in Linares and Rosier (Trans Am Math Soc 367:4595-4626, 2015) where a stronger stabilization term was used (that makes the equation of parabolic type in the control zone). Here we employ a more natural stabilization term related to the L 2-norm. Moreover, by proving a theorem of controllability in L 2, we manage to prove the global controllability in large time. Our analysis relies strongly on the bilinear estimates proved in Molinet and Pilod (Anal PDE 5:365-395, 2012) and some new extension of these estimates established here.\n\nAccelerated life test of an ONO stacked insulator film for a silicon micro-strip detector\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nOkuno, Shoji; Ikeda, Hirokazu; Saitoh, Yutaka\n\n1996-01-01\n\nWe have used to acquire the signal through an integrated capacitor for a silicon micro-strip detector. When we have been using a double-sided silicon micro-strip detector, we have required a long-term stability and a high feasibility for the integrated capacitor.

In order to test long term reliability for integrated capacitor of a silicon micro-strip detector, we made a multi-channel measuring system for capacitors\n\nEP3/FP dual receptor agonist ONO-9054 administered morning or evening to patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension: results of a randomised crossover study\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nBerlin, Michael S; Rowe-Rendleman, Cheryl; Ahmed, Ike; Ross, Douglas T; Fujii, Akifumi; Ouchi, Takafumi; Quach, Christine; Wood, Andrew; Ward, Caroline L\n\n2016-01-01\n\nBackground/aims The novel prostaglandin E (EP) 3 and prostaglandin F (FP) receptor agonist ONO-9054 is effective in lowering intraocular pressure (IOP) in patients with ocular hypertension and open-angle glaucoma when administered once daily. This study compares the effects of morning (AM) versus evening (PM) dosing of ONO-9054 on tolerability and IOP lowering. Methods This was a single-centre, randomised, double-masked, two-sequence, placebo-controlled crossover study in 12 subjects with bilateral primary open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. Two 14-day crossover regimens were separated by a 2-week washout: ONO-9054 (1 drop to each eye) in the morning (07:00) and vehicle in the evening (19:00) and vice versa. IOP was measured multiple times during select days. Ocular examinations also evaluated safety and tolerability. Results Mild ocular hyperaemia, reported by six subjects with PM dosing, was the most frequent adverse event. Mild to moderate dryness was also slightly more frequent after PM dosing. Maximum IOP reduction from baseline occurred on day 2 with decreases from baseline of â7.4â mmâ Hg (â30.8%) for AM dosing and â9.1â mmâ Hg, (â38.0%) for PM dosing; after 14â days, mean reduction in IOP was â6.8â mmâ Hg (â28.6%) for AM dosing and â7.5â mmâ Hg (â31.0%) for PM dosing. Conclusions PM dosing of ONO-0954 was associated with a slightly increased frequency of mild hyperaemia and mild to moderate dryness. Both dosing schedules provided sustained reduction in IOP.

ONO-AE1-329 was intravenously infused in three escalating doses of 0.3, 1 and 3ng/kg/min for 10min with a pause of 20min between the doses. The low dose of 0.3ng/kg/min significantly increased maximum upstroke velocity of left ventricular pressure by 18% at 20min, indicating increase of ventricular contractility. The middle dose of 1ng/kg/min significantly decreased total peripheral resistance by 24% and left ventricular end-diastolic pressure by 32% at 10min, indicating dilation of arteriolar resistance vessels and venous capacitance ones, respectively; and increased cardiac output by 25% at 10min in addition to the change induced by the low dose. The high dose of 3ng/kg/min increased heart rate by 34% at 10min; decreased mean blood pressure by 14% at 10min and atrioventricular nodal conduction time by 13% at 5min; and shortened left ventricular systolic period by 8% at 10min and electromechanical coupling defined as an interval from completion of repolarization to the start of ventricular diastole by 39% at 10min in addition to the changes induced by the middle dose. No significant change was detected in a ventricular repolarization period. These results indicate that ONO-AE1-329 may possess a similar cardiovascular profile to typical phosphodiesterase 3 inhibitors as an inodilator, and suggest that EP4 receptor stimulation can become an alternative strategy for the treatment of congestive heart failure.

Birk\n\n2010-02-01\n\nFull Text Available Active chlorine species play a dominant role in the catalytic destruction of stratospheric ozone in the polar vortices during the late winter and early spring seasons. Recently, the correct understanding of the ClO dimer cycle was challenged by the release of new laboratory absorption cross sections (Pope et al., 2007 yielding significant model underestimates of observed ClO and ozone loss (von Hobe et al., 2007. Under this aspect, nocturnal Arctic stratospheric limb emission measurements carried out by the balloon version of the Michelson Interferometer for Passive Atmospheric Sounding (MIPAS-B from Kiruna (Sweden on 11 January 2001 and 20/21 March 2003 have been reanalyzed with regard to the chlorine reservoir species ClONO2 and the active species, ClO and ClOOCl (Cl2O2. New laboratory measurements of IR absorption cross sections of ClOOCl for various temperatures and pressures allowed for the first time the retrieval of ClOOCl mixing ratios from remote sensing measurements. High values of active chlorine (ClOx of roughly 2.3 ppbv at 20 km were observed by MIPAS-B in the cold mid-winter Arctic vortex on 11 January 2001. While nighttime ClOOCl shows enhanced values of nearly 1.1 ppbv at 20 km, ClONO2 mixing ratios are less than 0.1 ppbv at this altitude. In contrast, high ClONO2 mixing ratios of nearly 2.4 ppbv at 20 km have been observed in the late winter Arctic vortex on 20 March 2003. No significant ClOx amounts are detectable on this date since most of the active chlorine has already recovered to its main reservoir species ClONO2. The observed values of ClOx and ClONO2 are in line with the established polar chlorine chemistry. The thermal equilibrium constants between the dimer formation and its dissociation, as derived from the balloon measurements, are on the lower side of reported data and in good agreement with values recommended by von Hobe et al.

A.; Nguyen, L. T. K.; Smyth, N. F.\n\n2018-04-01\n\nWe develop a general approach to the description of dispersive shock waves (DSWs) for a class of nonlinear wave equations with a nonlocal Benjamin-Ono type dispersion term involving the Hilbert transform. Integrability of the governing equation is not a pre-requisite for the application of this method which represents a modification of the DSW fitting method previously developed for dispersive-hydrodynamic systems of Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) type (i.e. reducible to the KdV equation in the weakly nonlinear, long wave, unidirectional approximation). The developed method is applied to the Calogero-Sutherland dispersive hydrodynamics for which the classification of all solution types arising from the Riemann step problem is constructed and the key physical parameters (DSW edge speeds, lead soliton amplitude, intermediate shelf level) of all but one solution type are obtained in terms of the initial step data. The analytical results are shown to be in excellent agreement with results of direct numerical simulations.\n\nIdentification of nitrate sources in Taihu Lake and its major inflow rivers in China, using Î´(15)N-NO(3)(-) and Î´(18)O-NO(3)(-) values.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nChen, Zi-Xiang; Liu, Guang; Liu, Wei-Guo; Lam, Michael H W; Liu, Gui-Jian; Yin, Xue-Bin\n\n2012-01-01\n\nIn the present study, Î´(15)N and Î´(18)O-NO(3)(-) values, as well as concentrations of some major ion tracers were determined in seasonal water samples from Taihu Lake and major watersheds to investigate the temporal and spatial variations of nitrate sources and assess the underlying nitrogen (N) biogeochemistry process. The results lead to the conclusion that the nitrate concentrations in Taihu Lake are lower in summer than that in winter due to the dilution effect of wet deposition. In winter, sewage and manure were the primary nitrate sources in major inflow rivers and North Taihu Lake (NTL), while nitrate sources in East Taihu Lake (ETL) probably derived from soil organic N. In summer, atmospheric deposition and sewage/manure inputs appear to play an important role in controlling the distribution of nitrates in the whole lake. The Î´(18)O-NO(3)(-) values suggest that the nitrate produced from microbial nitrification is another major nitrate source during both winter and summer months. The variations in isotopic values in nitrate suggest denitrification enriched the heavier isotopes of nitrate in NTL in winter and in ETL in summer.\n\nPECVD-ONO: A New Deposited Firing Stable Rear Surface Passivation Layer System for Crystalline Silicon Solar Cells\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nM.

These molecular clusters are precursors to thin film electronics and may be employed in energy applications. The synthetic routes provide varying levels of impurities in the solid phase, and these impurities often elude traditional characterization techniques such as powder X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy. Solid-state NMR can provide a window into the gallium species even in amorphous phases. This information is vital in order to prevent the impurities from causing defect sites in the corresponding thin films upon gelation and condensation (polymerization) of the Ga 13 clusters. This work demonstrates the resolving power of solid-state NMR to evaluate structure and synthetic quality in the solid state, and the application of high-field NMR to study quadrupolar species, such as 71 Ga. - Graphical abstract: The various synthetic routes and 71 Ga solid-state NMR spectra of the nanoscale inorganic cluster [Ga 13 (Î¼ 3 -OH) 6 (Î¼ 2 -OH) 18 (H 2 O)](NO 3 ) 15 . - Highlights: â¢ Solid-state 71 Ga NMR of hydroxo-aquo metal clusters and the impurities present. â¢ High-field NMR capability allows for quadrupolar species, such as 71 Ga, to be routinely studied. â¢ Efficient and environmentally friendly synthetic routes have been developed to prepare hydroxo-aquo metal clusters.\n\nGlobal paths of time-periodic solutions of the Benjamin-Ono equation connecting arbitrary traveling waves\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nAmbrose, David M.; Wilkening, Jon\n\n2008-12-11\n\nWe classify all bifurcations from traveling waves to non-trivial time-periodic solutions of the Benjamin-Ono equation that are predicted by linearization. We use a spectrally accurate numerical continuation method to study several paths of non-trivial solutions beyond the realm of linear theory. These paths are found to either re-connect with a different traveling wave or to blow up. In the latter case, as the bifurcation parameter approaches a critical value, the amplitude of the initial condition grows without bound and the period approaches zero. We propose a conjecture that gives the mapping from one bifurcation to its counterpart on the other side of the path of non-trivial solutions. By experimentation with data fitting, we identify the form of the exact solutions on the path connecting two traveling waves, which represents the Fourier coefficients of the solution as power sums of a finite number of particle positions whose elementary symmetric functions execute simple orbits in the complex plane (circles or epicycles). We then solve a system of algebraic equations to express the unknown constants in the new representation in terms of the mean, a spatial phase, a temporal phase, four integers (enumerating the bifurcation at each end of the path) and one additional bifurcation parameter. We also find examples of interior bifurcations from these paths of already non-trivial solutions, but we do not attempt to analyze their algebraic structure.\n\nPraemium Imperiale laureaadid / Priit Kuusk\n\nIndex Scriptorium Estoniae\n\nKuusk, Priit, 1938-\n\n2006-01-01\n\nJapan Art Association'i preemia (110000 eurot) said pianist Martha Argerich, balletilavastaja ja -trupijuht Merce Cunningham, maalikunstnik Robert Ryman, skulptuuride eest Issey Miyake ja arhitekt Yoshio Taniguchi\n\nTokyos maailma \"Kunsti-Nobelid\"\n\nIndex Scriptorium Estoniae\n\n2005-01-01\n\nPraemium Imperiale nimelisest loomeauhinnast, selle sajad 2005. aastal olid Issey Miyake, Robert Ryman, Yoshio Taniguchi, Martha Argerich, Merce Cunningham.

In contrast to the previous determination [Li et al. (2003. Chem. Mater. 15, 2253â2260], the present study reveals the location of all H atoms, slightly different fundamental building blocks (FBBs of the polyborate anions, more reasonable displacement ellipsoids for all non-H atoms, as well as a model without disorder of the nitrate anion. The crystal structure is built from corrugated polyborate layers parallel to (010. These layers, consisting of [B5O8(OH(H2O]2â anions as FBBs, stack along [010] and are linked by Ce3+ ions, which exhibit a distorted CeO10 coordination sphere. The layers are additionally stabilized via OâH...O hydrogen bonds between water molecules and nitrate anions, located at the interlayer space. The [BO3(H2O]-group shows a [3Â +Â 1] coordination and is considerably distorted from a tetrahedral configuration. Bond-valence-sum calculation shows that the valence sum of boron is only 2.63 valence units (v.u. when the contribution of the water molecule (0.49â v.u. is neglected.\n\nJPRS Report, Science & Technology, Japan\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\n1988-11-10\n\nKitazawa Takehiko Ishiguro Junji Fujie Hidetoshi Fukuyama Shinya Hasuo Osamu Horigami Keizo Ishikawa Yuzo Katayama Ushio Kawabe Yoichi Kimura...Committee Chairman Member II II II Hisao Hayakawa Yoshio Furuto Yasuo Hashimoto Kaoru Inagaki Hiroo Kinoshita Kanji Ohya Hideaki Okino Sakae\n\nSynthesis, solvatochromism and crystal structure of trans-[Cu(Et2NCH2CH2NH2)2.H2O](NO3)2 complex: Experimental with DFT combination\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nWarad, Ismail; Musameh, Sharif; Badran, Ismail; Nassar, Nashaat N.; Brandao, Paula; Tavares, Carlos Jose; Barakat, Assem\n\n2017-11-01\n\nIn this study, two dicationic asymmetrical diamine/copper(II) nitrate salt complexes of the general formula trans-[CuII(NNâ§)2.H2O](NO3)2 were successfully synthesized using N,N-dimethylethylenediamine and N,N-diethylethylenediamine as asymmetrical diamine ligands. The structure of complex 2 was identified by X-ray single crystal diffraction analysis confirming that the bidentate ligand N,N-dimethylethylenediamine forms a penta-coordinated complex with an H2O molecule located around the copper(II) ion in a trans configuration. It was found that the metal centre is coordinated in a distorted square pyramidal fashion with a Ï value of 0.274. The desired complexes were fully characterized using, MS, UV-Vis, CV, FTIR, TG/DTA, and Hirshfeld surface computational analysis.

In this multicenter study, IV injections of etelcalcetide (3 times a week for 12Â weeks) were administered, with dose escalation every 4 weeks depending on changes in serum intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) and corrected calcium (cCa). A total of 24 patients participated in this study. Serum iPTH was reduced in a time- and dose-dependent manner, with reductions (in pg/mL) at 12 weeks of -226.1 Â± 125.3, -362.5 Â± 161.5, and -412.4 Â± 130.2, respectively, for maximum doses of 5, 10, and 15Â mg. At the end of the treatment, 50% of patients had serum iPTH levels within the target range (60Â -Â 240 pg/mL). Serum cCa and phosphorus were reduced in parallel with iPTH. Adverse events (AEs) occurred in 20 patients (83.3%). The most frequently observed AEs (>Â 10%) were either mild or moderate nasopharyngitis (29.2%), decreased serum calcium (16.7%), and vomiting (12.5%). Dose-escalated triweekly etelcalcetide was effective for SHPT in Japanese hemodialysis patients and was satisfactorily tolerated.â©.\n\nReactivity of tris(acetylacetonato) iron(III) with tridentate [ONO] donor Schiff base as an access to newer mixed-ligand iron(III) complexes\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nBhattacharjee, Chira R.; Goswami, Pankaj; Pramanik, Harun A. R.; Paul, Pradip C.; Mondal, Paritosh\n\n2011-05-01\n\nTwo new mixed-ligand iron(III) complexes, [Fe(L n)(acac)(C 2H 5OH)] incorporating coordinated ethanol from the reaction solvent were accessed from the reaction of [Fe(acac) 3] with [ONO] donor dibasic tridentate unsymmetrical Schiff base ligands derived from condensation of 2-hydroxy-1-napthaldehyde with 2-aminophenol (H 2L 1) or 2-aminobenzoic acid (H 2L 2). The thermal study (TGA-DTA) provided evidence for weakly bound ethanol which is readily substituted by neutral N-donor molecule imidazole, benzimidazole or pyridine to produce an array of newer complexes, [Fe(L n)(acac)X] ( n = 1, 2; X = Im, Bim, Py). The compounds were characterized by elemental analyses, FT-IR, UV-vis, solution electrical conductivity, FAB mass, 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy. Room temperature magnetic susceptibility measurements ( Î¼eff Ë 5.8 B.M.) are consistent with spin-free octahedral iron(III) complexes. Cyclic voltammetry of ethanol complexes revealed a quasi-reversible one electron redox response (Î Ep > 100 mV) for the Fe(III)/Fe(II) couple. Low half wave redox potential ( E1/2) values suggested easy redox susceptibility. The ground state geometries of the ethanol and imidazole complexes have been ascertained to be distorted octahedral by density functional theory using DMol3 program at BLYP/DNP level.\n\nArhitektuurimuuseumid ehitavad / Karin Hallas\n\nIndex Scriptorium Estoniae\n\nHallas, Karin, 1957-\n\n2001-01-01\n\nArhitektuurimuuseumide konfÃ¶deratsiooni (ICAM) juhatuse aastakoosolekust Los Angeleses.

In this study, we examined the effect of S1P 1 agonist, ONO-W061, on murine Candida albicans water-soluble fraction (CAWS)-induced vasculitis. Mice were administered ONO-W061, and the number of peripheral blood cells was counted. Vasculitis was induced by an intraperitoneal injection of CAWS. Expression of S1P receptors and CXCL1 was analyzed by quantitative RT-PCR. ONO-W061 was orally administered, and vasculitis was evaluated histologically. Number of neutrophils, macrophages and T cells in the vasculitis tissue was counted using flow cytometry. Production of chemokines from S1P-stimulated human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) was measured by ELISA. Number of peripheral blood lymphocytes was decreased by ONO-W061. Expression of CXCL1 and S1P 1 was enhanced in CAWS-induced vasculitis tissue. Vasculitis score, CXCL1 and number of neutrophils in the vasculitis tissue were lower in ONO-W061-treated mice. Treatment of HUVECs with S1P upregulated the production of CXCL1 and IL-8 in vitro, and this was inhibited by ONO-W061. ONO-W061 significantly improved CAWS-induced vasculitis. This effect may be partly exerted through the inhibited production of chemokines by endothelial cells, which in turn could induce neutrophil recruitment into inflamed vessels.\n\nEffect of a steam foot spa on geriatric inpatients with cognitive impairment: a pilot study\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nKoike Y; Kondo H; Kondo S; Takagi M; Kano Y\n\n2013-01-01\n\nYoshihisa Koike,1 Hideki Kondo,2 Satoshi Kondo,1 Masayuki Takagi,1 Yoshio Kano31Department of Occupational Therapy, Prefectural University of Hiroshima, Mihara, Japan; 2Yoshiigawa Hospital, Okayama, Japan; 3Department of Occupational Therapy, Kibi International University, Takahashi, JapanPurpose: To investigate whether a steam foot spa improves cognitive impairment in geriatric inpatients.Methods: Geriatric inpatients with cognitive impairment were given a steam foot spa treatment at 42&...\n\nMolecular structure and vibrational spectrum of the complex [ErL(H2O)(NO3)3] (L 1,4,10,13-tetraoxi-7,16-diaza(diphenylphosphinylmethyl) cyclooctadecane\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nMinacheva, L.Kh.; Ivanova, I.S.; Kireeva, I.K.; Sakharova, V.G.; Tsivadze, A.Yu.; Sergienko, V.S.; Baulin, V.E.\n\n2000-01-01\n\nSynthesis of podandocoronand on the basis of diazo-18-crown-6 (DA18K6) 1,4,10,13-tetraoxi-7,16-diazo (diphenylphosphynylmethyl)cyclooctadecane (L) and erbium nitrate complex with L of the [ErL(H 2 O)(NO 3 ) 3 ] (I) composition is described.

These data extend over more than 20 years (through 2007) during a period when the growth in atmospheric halogen loading has slowed in response to the Montreal Protocol (and ammendments). These observed time series are interpreted with calculations performed with a 2-D model, the 3-D chemistry-transport models (CTMs) KASIMA and SLIMCAT, and the 3-D chemistry-climate models (CCMs) EMAC and SOCOLv2.0. The observed Cly and in particular HCl column abundances decreases significantely since the end of the nineties at all stations, which is consistent with the observed changes in the halocarbon source gases, with an increasing rate in the last years. In contrast to Cly, the trend values for total column HF at the different stations show a less consistent behaviour pointing to the fact that the time development of the HF columns is peaking. There is a good overall qualitative agreement regarding trends between models and data. With respect to the CTMs the agreement improves if simulation results for measurement days only are used in the trend analysis instead of simulation results for each day.\n\nPromotion of adipogenesis by an EP2 receptor agonist via stimulation of angiogenesis in pulmonary emphysema.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nTsuji, Takao; Yamaguchi, Kazuhiro; Kikuchi, Ryota; Itoh, Masayuki; Nakamura, Hiroyuki; Nagai, Atsushi; Aoshiba, Kazutetsu\n\n2014-08-01\n\nBody weight loss is a common manifestation in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), particularly those with severe emphysema. Adipose angiogenesis is a key mediator of adipogenesis and use of pro-angiogenic agents may serve as a therapeutic option for lean COPD patients. Since angiogenesis is stimulated by PGE2, we examined whether ONO-AE1-259, a selective E-prostanoid (EP) 2 receptor agonist, might promote adipose angiogenesis and adipogenesis in a murine model of elastase-induced pulmonary emphysema (EIE mice). Mice were intratracheally instilled with elastase or saline, followed after 4 weeks by intraperitoneal administration of ONO-AE1-259 for 4 weeks. The subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) weight decreased in the EIE mice, whereas in the EIE mice treated with ONO-AE1-259, the SAT weight was largely restored, which was associated with significant increases in SAT adipogenesis, angiogenesis, and VEGF protein production. In contrast, ONO-AE1-259 administration induced no alteration in the weight of the visceral adipose tissue. These results suggest that in EIE mice, ONO-AE1-259 stimulated adipose angiogenesis possibly via VEGF production, and thence, adipogenesis. Our data pave the way for the development of therapeutic interventions for weight loss in emphysema patients, e.g., use of pro-angiogenic agents targeting the adipose tissue vascular component.

By the same methods, the dissociation of H(2)ONO(+) to give the nitrosonium ion (NO(+)) and water has also been investigated. We have used Becke's hybrid functional (B3LYP), and geometry optimizations were performed with the 6-311++G(d,p) basis set. In addition, highly accurate ab initio composite methods (G3 and CBS-Q) were used. Solvation energies were calculated using the conductor-like polarizable continuum model, CPCM, at the B3LYP/6-311++G(d,p) level of theory, with the UAKS cavity model. The pK(a) value of H(2)ONO(+) was calculated using two different schemes: the direct method and the proton exchange method. The calculated pK(a) values at different levels of theory range from -9.4 to -15.6, showing that H(2)ONO(+) is a strong acid (i.e., HONO is only a weak base). The equilibrium constant, K(R), for protonation of nitrous acid followed by dissociation to give NO(+) and H(2)O has also been calculated using the same methodologies. The pK(R) value calculated by the G3 and CBS-QB3 methods is in best (and satisfactory) agreement with experimental results, which allows us to narrow down the likely value of the pK(a) of H(2)ONO(+) to about -10, a value appreciably more acidic than literature values.\n\nImpact of cardiac support device combined with slow-release prostacyclin agonist in a canine ischemic cardiomyopathy model.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nKubota, Yasuhiko; Miyagawa, Shigeru; Fukushima, Satsuki; Saito, Atsuhiro; Watabe, Hiroshi; Daimon, Takashi; Sakai, Yoshiki; Akita, Toshiaki; Sawa, Yoshiki\n\n2014-03-01\n\nThe cardiac support device supports the heart and mechanically reduces left ventricular (LV) diastolic wall stress. Although it has been shown to halt LV remodeling in dilated cardiomyopathy, its therapeutic efficacy is limited by its lack of biological effects. In contrast, the slow-release synthetic prostacyclin agonist ONO-1301 enhances reversal of LV remodeling through biological mechanisms such as angiogenesis and attenuation of fibrosis. We therefore hypothesized that ONO-1301 plus a cardiac support device might be beneficial for the treatment of ischemic cardiomyopathy. Twenty-four dogs with induced anterior wall infarction were assigned randomly to 1 of 4 groups at 1Â week postinfarction as follows: cardiac support device alone, cardiac support device plus ONO-1301 (hybrid therapy), ONO-1301 alone, or sham control. At 8 weeks post-infarction, LV wall stress was reduced significantly in the hybrid therapy group compared with the other groups. Myocardial blood flow, measured by positron emission tomography, and vascular density were significantly higher in the hybrid therapy group compared with the cardiac support device alone and sham groups. The hybrid therapy group also showed the least interstitial fibrosis, the greatest recovery of LV systolic and diastolic functions, assessed by multidetector computed tomography and cardiac catheterization, and the lowest plasma N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide levels (PÂ <Â .05). The combination of a cardiac support device and the prostacyclin agonist ONO-1301 elicited a greater reversal of LV remodeling than either treatment alone, suggesting the potential of this hybrid therapy for the clinical treatment of ischemia-induced heart failure.

The potential-energy profile of the reactions predicted with the CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pVTZ//B3LYP/aug-cc-pVTZ method shows that the initial association yields a prereaction complex that isomerizes by H migration to yield excited intermediate nitrooxymethyl hydroperoxide NO 3 CH 2 OOH* with internal energy â¼44 kcal mol -1 . A fragmentation of this excited intermediate produces CH 2 (O)NO 3 + OH with its transition state located 5.0 kcal mol -1 below that of the reactants. Further decomposition of CH 2 (O)NO 3 produces HCO + HNO 3 , forming a catalytic cycle for destruction of CH 2 OO by HNO 3 . The rate coefficients and product-branching ratios were calculated in the temperature range 250-700 K at pressure 20-760 Torr (N 2 ) using the variational-transition-state and Rice-Ramsperger-Kassel-Marcus (RRKM) theories. The predicted total rate coefficient for reaction CH 2 OO + HNO 3 at 295 K, 5.1 Ã 10 -10 cm 3 molecule -1 s -1 , agrees satisfactorily with the experimental value, (5.4 Â± 1.0) Ã 10 -10 cm 3 molecule -1 s -1 . The predicted branching ratios at 295 K are 0.21 for the formation of NO 3 CH 2 OOH and 0.79 for CH 2 (O)NO 3 + OH at a pressure of 40 Torr (N 2 ), and 0.79 for the formation of NO 3 CH 2 OOH and 0.21 for CH 2 (O)NO 3 + OH at 760 Torr (N 2 ). This new catalytic conversion of CH 2 OO to HCO + OH by HNO 3 might have significant impact on atmospheric chemistry.\n\nThe origin of traps and the effect of nitrogen plasma in oxide-nitride-oxide structures for non-volatile memories\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nKim, W.

The DLTS results verified that the nitride-related traps were a dominant factor in the memory effect. The energy of hole traps was 0.307 eV above the balance band. To improve the memory effects of the non-volatile memory devices with ONO structures, we introduced a nitrogen plasma treatment. After the N-plasma treatment, the flat-band voltage shift (ÎV FB ) was increased by about 1.5 times. The program and the erase (P-E) characteristics were also shown to be better than those for the as-ONO structure. In addition, the retention characteristics were improved by over 2.4 times.\n\nKuranishi spaces as a 2-category\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nJoyce, Dominic\n\n2015-01-01\n\nThis is a survey of the author's in-progress book arXiv:1409.6908. 'Kuranishi spaces' were introduced in the work of Fukaya, Oh, Ohta and Ono in symplectic geometry (see e.g. arXiv:1503.07631), as the geometric structure on moduli spaces of $J$-holomorphic curves. We propose a new definition of Kuranishi space, which has the nice property that they form a 2-category $\\\\bf Kur$. Thus the homotopy category Ho$({\\\\bf Kur})$ is an ordinary category of Kuranishi spaces.

Four reaction channels HCl + CH2ONO2, CH3OCl + NO2, CH3Cl + NO3 and CH3O + ClNO2 were considered. The major channel is found to be the H abstraction channel, to give the products HCl + CH2ONO2. For all channels, geometry optimization and frequency calculations were carried out at the M06-2X/6-31+G** level, while relative electronic energies were improved to the UCCSD(T*)-F12/CBS level. The reaction barrier (ÎE(â¡)0K) and reaction enthalpy (ÎH(RX)298K) of the H abstraction channel were computed to be 0.61 and -2.30 kcal mol(-1), respectively, at the UCCSD(T*)-F12/CBS//M06-2X/6-31+G** level. Reaction barriers (ÎE(â¡)0K) for the other channels are more positive and these pathways do not contribute to the overall reaction rate coefficient in the temperature range considered (200-400 K). Rate coefficients were calculated for the H-abstraction channel at various levels of variational transition state theory (VTST) including tunnelling. Recommended ICVT/SCT rate coefficients in the temperature range 200-400 K are presented for the first time for this reaction. The values obtained in the 200-300 K region are particularly important as they will be valuable for atmospheric modelling calculations involving reactions with methyl nitrate. The implications of the results to atmospheric chemistry are discussed. Also, the enthalpies of formation, ÎHf,298K, of CH3ONO2 and CH2ONO2 were computed to be -29.7 and 19.3 kcal mol(-1), respectively, at the UCCSD(T*)-F12/CBS level.\n\nMy search for Ramanujan how I learned to count\n\nCERN Document Server\n\nOno, Ken\n\n2016-01-01\n\n\"The son of a prominent Japanese mathematician who came to the United States after World War II, Ken Ono was raised on a diet of high expectations and little praise. Rebelling against his pressure-cooker of a life, Ken determined to drop out of high school to follow his own path. To obtain his fatherâs approval, he invoked the biography of the famous Indian mathematical prodigy Srinivasa Ramanujan, whom his father revered, who had twice flunked out of college because of his single-minded devotion to mathematics. Ono describes his rocky path through college and graduate school, interweaving Ramanujanâs story with his own and telling how at key moments, he was inspired by Ramanujan and guided by mentors who encouraged him to pursue his interest in exploring Ramanujanâs mathematical legacy. Picking up where others left off, beginning with the great English mathematician G.H. Hardy, who brought Ramanujan to Cambridge in 1914, Ono has devoted his mathematical career to understanding how in his short life, Ra...\n\nA phase 3, multicentre, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of etelcalcetide (ONO-5163/AMG 416), a novel intravenous calcimimetic, for secondary hyperparathyroidism in Japanese haemodialysis patients.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nFukagawa, Masafumi; Yokoyama, Keitaro; Shigematsu, Takashi; Akiba, Takashi; Fujii, Akifumi; Kuramoto, Takuto; Odani, Motoi; Akizawa, Tadao\n\n2017-10-01\n\nSecondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT) is a major complication associated with chronic kidney disease. We evaluated the efficacy and safety of etelcalcetide (ONO-5163/AMG 416), a novel intravenous calcimimetic, in Japanese haemodialysis patients with SHPT. In this phase 3, multicentre, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study, etelcalcetide was administered three times per week at an initial dose of 5âmg, and subsequently adjusted to doses between 2.5 and 15âmg at 4-week intervals for 12 weeks. A total of 155 SHPT patients with serum intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) levelsââ¥300âpg/mL were assigned to receive etelcalcetide (nâ=â78) or placebo (nâ=â77). The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with decreased serum iPTH to the target range proposed by the Japanese Society for Dialysis Therapy (60-240âpg/mL). The major secondary endpoint was the proportion of patients withââ¥30% reductions in serum iPTH from baseline. The proportion of patients meeting the primary endpoint was significantly higher for etelcalcetide (59.0%) versus placebo (1.3%). Similarly, the proportion of patients meeting the major secondary endpoint was significantly higher for etelcalcetide (76.9%) versus placebo (5.2%). Serum albumin-corrected calcium, phosphorus and intact fibroblast growth factor-23 levels were decreased in the etelcalcetide group. Nausea, vomiting and symptomatic hypocalcaemia were mild with etelcalcetide. Serious adverse events related to etelcalcetide were not observed. This study demonstrated the efficacy and safety of etelcalcetide. As the only available intravenous calcium-sensing receptor agonist, etelcalcetide is likely to provide a new treatment option for SHPT in haemodialysis patients. Â© The Author 2017.

The total mixing ratios of C 1 -C 4 RONO 2 (Î£ 5 RONO 2 ) ranged from 15.4 to 143.7 pptv with an average of 65.9Â Â±Â 33.0 pptv. C 3 -C 4 RONO 2 (2-butyl nitrate and 2-propyl nitrate) were the most abundant RONO 2 during the entire sampling period. The mixing ratios of C 3 -C 4 RONO 2 were higher in winter than those in summer, while the ones of methyl nitrate (MeONO 2 ) were higher in summer than those in winter. Source analysis suggests that C 2 -C 4 RONO 2 were mainly derived from photochemical formation along with biomass burning (58.3-71.6%), while ocean was a major contributor to MeONO 2 (53.8%) during the whole sampling period. The photochemical evolution of C 2 -C 4 RONO 2 was investigated, and found to be dominantly produced by the parent hydrocarbon oxidation. The notable enrichment of MeONO 2 over C 3 -C 4 RONO 2 was observed in a summer episode when the air masses originating from the South China Sea (SCS) and MeONO 2 was dominantly derived from oceanic emissions. In order to improve the accuracy of ozone (O 3 ) prediction in coastal environment, the relative contribution of RONO 2 from oceanic emissions versus photochemical formation and their coupling effects on O 3 production should be taken into account in future studies.

When the Portuguese opened the maritime routes to the Far East in the 16th century. Western medicine traveled to Japan on the trading vessels that carried physicians and barber-surgeons to care for the body and Christian missionaries to care for the soul. Skilled interpreters such as KÅgyÅ« Yoshio translated and studied Dutch editions of early medical books, like Lorenz Heister's \"Chirurgie\" (NÃ¼rnberg, 1719), that illustrate the concept of transfusion. The oldest description of transfusion originating in Japan is a handwritten manuscript entitled \"Bansui Sensi Chojutsu Shomoku\" by Masamichi Nishijima, a student of Bansui Otsuki. It is a list of Otsuki's translated works. He described book names and chapter names in the manuscript, and when he finished translation of a chapter, he marked a circle on the chapter name. The transfusion chapter had a circle. That dates the earliest writing on transfusion in Japanese to 1804, shortly after the death of KÅgyÅ«. Unfortunately, the manuscript translation no longer exists. In 1814, ShunzÅ Yoshio, grandson of KÅgyÅ«, and in 1820, Tokki Koshimura, translated the figure legends of \"Chirurgie.\" Soon afterwards, after the first report of transfusion from human-to-human by James Blundell in London in 1818, Western medical books published on the subject began to arrive. The works of Christoph Wilhelm Hufeland, Georg Friedrich Most and Carl Canstatt all mentioning transfusion, albeit without details, were translated by KÅan Ogata and ShinryÅ Tsuboi. During the Edo period, Japan was a closed country; only open to the Dutch through a tiny island in Nagasaki. But Japanese doctors in the Edo period learned about blood transfusion through Dutch-translated versions of Western medical Books. Transfusion began being practiced in Japan in 1919, almost exactly 100 years after the concept was introduced\n\nExperimental and Theoretical Investigation of Effects of Ethanol and Acetic Acid on Carcinogenic NDMA Formation in Simulated Gastric Fluid.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nZhang, Ou; Zou, Xuan; Li, Qi-Hong; Sun, Zhi; Liu, Yong Dong; Zhong, Ru Gang\n\n2016-07-07\n\nN-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA), as a representative of endogenously formed N-nitroso compounds (NOCs), has become the focus of considerable research interest due to its unusually high carcinogenicity.
