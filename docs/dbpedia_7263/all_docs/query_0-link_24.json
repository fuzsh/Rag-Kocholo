        "text": "Message from the Director\n\nDirector Robert Tribble\n\nOn April 1, 2023, I began my new role as Director of the RBRC. It was truly an honor for me to take over this position from my immediate predecessor, Dr. Hideto Enâ€™yo, who led the RBRC through the previous six years. Hideto has been and continues to be a strong advocate for the RIKEN involvement at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). He was a member of the PHENIX collaboration and has also been supporting the sPHENIX effort. In the early days of RHIC, he was one of the key people at RIKEN who helped develop the support needed to establish a polarized-proton program at RHIC. RHIC and the RBRC are indebted to him for his leadership.\n\nThe RBRC is at the beginning of a period of transition. The sPHENIX collaboration began commissioning its new detector in May of 2023. The RBRC members working on sPHENIX are now positioned to begin collecting data from the detector during the remaining RHIC runs and then carry out the analysis of that data. The theory efforts associated with RBRC remain very active with world leading programs in lattice QCD calculations and nuclear theory in support of the RHIC program. One of my goals as RBRC Director is to ensure that these programs continue to flourish."
