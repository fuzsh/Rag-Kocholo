        "text": "The present volume contains five papers, published by Tatsuo Tabata and his coworkers from 1959 to 1961, in the form of the post-print re-edited by the use of LATEX. The studies described belong to the field of low-energy experimental nuclear physics, and experiments are of two types. One is nuclear-spectroscopy; and the other, nuclear-reaction study. For the former, a group at Kyoto University (KU) used the Cockcroft–Walton generator of KU and measured proton capture gamma-rays. For the latter, another group, organized at the Institute for Nuclear Study (INS), the University of Tokyo, used alpha particles from the INS cyclotron. Tabata joined these groups as a student of Master’s Program, Graduate School of Science, KU. Each paper includes the “Commentary” section written by the present editor at its end. The editor has also corrected minor errors in the papers.\n\nIn Europe, the United States, and Japan, there is a worldwide effort to set up powerful research facilities that can provide beams of radioactive nuclei of various kinds, as well as beams of exceptionally enormous energies, to study the origins of the physical world. Complex and massive detector arrays with better technical capabilities are either created around or independently of these facilities (dedicated to cosmic rays). Superheavy nuclei, cold binary and ternary fission and nuclear shell structure are just a few of the areas where progress has been achieved recently. Cosmic rays have an energy spectrum that is beyond the capabilities of artificial accelerators. The installation of a massive detector array has been agreed upon by an international consortium. The field of nuclear physics is expanding in three distinct directions. Investigations on the behaviour of hot and dense nuclear materials are among them. Gluons and quarks make up the nuclear force. Distinction between stable and unstable nuclei. For the sake of this presentation, we will only be discussing the research of exotic nuclei, ranging from stability to the drip line. Nuclear force, nuclear stability, and shell structure and shape have all been studied in this study. Nuclei with a short lifespan are being produced using new experimental techniques. The fabrication of heavy nuclei with Z=114 and beyond has made significant progress."
