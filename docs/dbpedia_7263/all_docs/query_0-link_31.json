        "text": "2.2 Exchange forces and nuclear physics\n\nLet us now analyze Heisenberg‚Äôs important work on nuclear theory. As a previous mandatory step, we shall briefly summarize the state of art of research in nuclear physics in 1932.\n\nChadwick‚Äôs discovery of a neutral particle of mass comparable with that of the proton, i.e. the neutron [7, 8], is, without any doubt, one of the most relevant experimental findings of the early 1930s. Indeed, it provided the solution of some puzzling issues concerning the nuclear structure, such as the wrong spin and statistics of several nuclei, for example the N14superscriptùëÅ14{}^{14}Nstart_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT 14 end_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT italic_N nucleus. This last feature was a direct consequence of the existing model for the nucleus, as built of protons and electrons, which in the case of the N14superscriptùëÅ14{}^{14}Nstart_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT 14 end_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT italic_N nucleus led to fourteen protons and seven electrons, thus implying that this nucleus should have half-integer spin and obey Fermi-Dirac statistics, at odds with observations of band spectra of the N2+superscriptsubscriptùëÅ2N_{2}^{+}italic_N start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT + end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT molecule, consistent with spin-1 and Bose statistics for those nuclei (see [9, 21] for a discussion). In order to address this problem, some strange properties had to be hypothesized for nuclear electrons, for instance that they did not contribute to the spin and statistics of the nucleus because their spins and statistics would get somehow suppressed, so their behavior would not follow quantum theory and Dirac‚Äôs equation. Other inconsistencies brought by the hypothesis of nuclear electrons were the incorrect value of the magnetic moments of nuclei and the inconsistency of the energies expected for nuclear electrons from the momentum-position uncertainty relation due to their confinement in the nucleus, as well as both the average binding energy for a nuclear particle and the typical kinetic energies of electrons emitted as Œ≤ùõΩ\\betaitalic_Œ≤-rays. Related to this, there was the well-known problem of the continuous spectrum of such Œ≤ùõΩ\\betaitalic_Œ≤-rays, which seemed to threaten the validity of energy and momentum conservation. All these problems induced some scientists, most notably Niels Bohr, to believe that quantum mechanics, as well as the cherished conservation laws of energy, momentum and angular momentum, did not work at nuclear scales, and that somehow the electrons ‚Äúlost their individuality‚Äù when confined to such a small scale. Bohr‚Äôs position is vividly expressed by Tomonaga as follows:\n\nBohr asserted that this difficulty appeared because quantum mechanics did not work in the nucleus, and therefore the law of energy conservation was violated. Bohr said that since an electron with a Compton wavelength of 10‚àí11superscript101110^{-11}10 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT - 11 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT cm was confined in the small nucleus with a 10‚àí13superscript101310^{-13}10 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT - 13 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT cm radius, the individuality of the electron was lost in the nucleus. [‚Ä¶] The bottom line is that according to Bohr‚Äôs idea, the interior of a nucleus was a sanctuary that could not be penetrated by quantum mechanics ([21], pp. 159-160).\n\nAs we will see now, the ‚Äúsanctuary‚Äù began instead to be penetrated by Heisenberg who brought quantum mechanics into the nucleus. The starting point of Heisenberg‚Äôs first paper on nuclear forces [11] is the key assumption that atomic nuclei are built up with protons and neutrons, with no electrons. Besides a relevant simplification of the theory, which now only involves heavy and slow particles and thus can be formulated using ordinary non-relativistic quantum mechanics, the correct statistics of nuclei such as N14superscriptùëÅ14{}^{14}Nstart_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT 14 end_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT italic_N follows at once from further assuming that the neutron has spin 12‚Å¢‚Ñè12Planck-constant-over-2-pi\\frac{1}{2}\\hbardivide start_ARG 1 end_ARG start_ARG 2 end_ARG roman_‚Ñè and satisfies Fermi statistics. But the problem with the Œ≤ùõΩ\\betaitalic_Œ≤-decay energy spectra remained. To address this and other issues such as the the interaction of nuclei with Œ≥ùõæ\\gammaitalic_Œ≥-rays, in all three papers Heisenberg adopted a kind of ‚Äúhybrid‚Äù approach in which the neutron is sometimes considered as an elementary particle, and sometimes as a composite of an electron and a proton, despite this being obviously in contrast with the assumptions made for spin and statistics. As a matter of fact, Heisenberg was sweeping all the problems of the quantum mechanical description of a proton-electron nucleus inside the neutron:\n\nThe neutron will be taken as an independent fundamental particle which, however, can split, under favorable conditions, into a proton and an electron, violating the law of conservation of energy and momentum ([11], translated in [10], p. 145).\n\nAt this stage, Pauli‚Äôs neutrino hypothesis had not yet been recognized by Heisenberg, while Œ≤ùõΩ\\betaitalic_Œ≤-decay would have been the subject of a careful analysis at the end of the paper.\n\nThe core of Heisenberg‚Äôs work is the consideration that a correct description of the nuclei can be given in terms of quantum mechanics and, in particular, of the interaction between protons and neutrons. The nature of this interaction needs to be established. Two main guidelines were followed: first, the force must be very strong, in order to bind protons and neutrons within a region of the order of 10‚àí13superscript101310^{-13}10 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT - 13 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT cm, i.e., the nuclear radius, as can be inferred also from proton-nuclei scattering experiments, which also pointed at this force being of very short range; second, experiments indicated a saturation property of nuclear forces, namely that the binding energy of the nuclei is proportional to the mass number Aùê¥Aitalic_A (i.e. the number of particles inside the nucleus), rather than A2superscriptùê¥2A^{2}italic_A start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT as would be the case for a force in which each nucleon interacted with all other nucleons. The conclusion was that the required interaction could not be of electromagnetic origin, and should be analogous to the one responsible of the existence and stability of the H2+superscriptsubscriptùêª2H_{2}^{+}italic_H start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT + end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT-ion within the domain of molecular physics. The proton and the neutron were seen as analogues of a hydrogen nucleus and a hydrogen atom, and the interaction could be seen, as its molecular-theoretic counterpart, as due to the exchange of an electron between the two. Notice that this picture requires the mentioned problematic composite picture of the neutron. In Heisenberg‚Äôs words:\n\nIf one brings a neutron and a proton to within a distance comparable to the dimensions of the nucleus, then ‚Äì in analogy with the H2+superscriptsubscriptùêª2H_{2}^{+}italic_H start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT + end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ion ‚Äì a change of place [Platzwechsel] of the negative charge will occur with frequency 1h‚Å¢J‚Å¢(r)1‚ÑéùêΩùëü\\frac{1}{h}J(r)divide start_ARG 1 end_ARG start_ARG italic_h end_ARG italic_J ( italic_r ). The quantity J‚Å¢(r)ùêΩùëüJ(r)italic_J ( italic_r ) corresponds to the Austausch- or more correctly the Platzwechsel-integral of molecular theory. One can illustrate this Platzwechsel again with the picture of electrons that have no spin and obey Bose statistics. But it is probably more correct to regard the exchange integral J‚Å¢(r)ùêΩùëüJ(r)italic_J ( italic_r ) as a fundamental property of the proton-neutron pair, without wanting to reduce it to motions of electrons ([11], p. 2; translated in [6], p. 104).\n\nNotice that Heisenberg speaks here about an electron without spin obeying Bose statistics, in this way preserving the fermionic nature and the half-integer spin of the neutron. Within such a picture, the mechanism of the interaction between the neutron and the proton can be viewed as an exchange of an electron between the neutron and the proton: the neutron which loses its electron turns into a proton while the proton, which captures the electron, becomes a neutron. However he will end up by hinting to a different interpretation of the exchange integral J‚Å¢(r)ùêΩùëüJ(r)italic_J ( italic_r ), without any reference to moving electrons, but as related to the exchange of the proton and the neutron themselves. As we will see in the following, the introduction of the concept of isospin, which permits considering the proton and the neutron as different states of otherwise identical particles, allowed Heisenberg to implement the idea of exchange between the neutron and the proton without resorting to the picture of a moving Bose electron. Summing up, the above quote shows that Heisenberg considered two different exchange mechanisms at the basis of the interaction that keeps nuclei together, one modeled after the interaction of the constituent atoms of a molecule, the other one modeled instead after the electrons in a many-body system. As we shall see, the second mechanism will underlie the Majorana theory (Section 3), while the first one will be at the basis of the subsequent developments based on the Fermi theory (Section 4) and on the meson theory (Section 6), leading to the current picture of interactions mediated by exchange of virtual particles. An interesting consideration is in order here [5, 6]. According to the standard interpretation of the wave function in quantum mechanics, which by 1932 was already accepted by many physicists, including Heisenberg, the wave functions of electrons in molecules are to be considered as stationary states, hence the mental pictures of electrons that exchange their position or of an electron bouncing back and forth is approximate at best: there is no net motion of charge in an isolated molecule. Nevertheless, in 1932 Heisenberg adopted the picture of the exchange of an electron, and this will lead over the years to the current representation of fundamental interactions.\n\nHeisenberg assumed that exchange interactions, modeled as we just described, act between a neutron and a proton (with the exchange integral denoted by J‚Å¢(r)ùêΩùëüJ(r)italic_J ( italic_r ) and assumed to be positive), and that similar interactions acted between a neutron and a neutron (the exchange integral in this case denoted by K‚Å¢(r)ùêæùëüK(r)italic_K ( italic_r ), with the assumption that J‚Å¢(r)>K‚Å¢(r)ùêΩùëüùêæùëüJ(r)>K(r)italic_J ( italic_r ) > italic_K ( italic_r )), but not between a proton and a proton, where only the Coulomb repulsion e2rsuperscriptùëí2ùëü\\frac{e^{2}}{r}divide start_ARG italic_e start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT end_ARG start_ARG italic_r end_ARG acts. Denoting with Dùê∑Ditalic_D the mass defect of the proton with respect to the neutron, and finally neglecting all relativistic effects (allowed by the large mass of all particles), the complete Hamiltonian for the nucleus proposed by Heisenberg was the following:\n\nHùêª\\displaystyle Hitalic_H =\\displaystyle== 12‚Å¢M‚Å¢‚àëkùê©k2‚àí12‚Å¢‚àëk>lJ‚Å¢(rk‚Å¢l)‚Å¢(œÅkŒæ‚Å¢œÅlŒæ+œÅkŒ∑‚Å¢œÅlŒ∑)‚àí14‚Å¢‚àëk>lK‚Å¢(rk‚Å¢l)‚Å¢(1+œÅkŒ∂)‚Å¢(1+œÅlŒ∂)12ùëÄsubscriptùëòsuperscriptsubscriptùê©ùëò212subscriptùëòùëôùêΩsubscriptùëüùëòùëôsuperscriptsubscriptùúåùëòùúâsuperscriptsubscriptùúåùëôùúâsuperscriptsubscriptùúåùëòùúÇsuperscriptsubscriptùúåùëôùúÇ14subscriptùëòùëôùêæsubscriptùëüùëòùëô1superscriptsubscriptùúåùëòùúÅ1superscriptsubscriptùúåùëôùúÅ\\displaystyle\\frac{1}{2M}\\sum_{k}{\\bf p}_{k}^{2}-\\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{k>l}J(r_{kl}% )(\\rho_{k}^{\\xi}\\rho_{l}^{\\xi}+\\rho_{k}^{\\eta}\\rho_{l}^{\\eta})-\\frac{1}{4}\\sum% _{k>l}K(r_{kl})(1+\\rho_{k}^{\\zeta})(1+\\rho_{l}^{\\zeta})divide start_ARG 1 end_ARG start_ARG 2 italic_M end_ARG ‚àë start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_k end_POSTSUBSCRIPT bold_p start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_k end_POSTSUBSCRIPT start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT - divide start_ARG 1 end_ARG start_ARG 2 end_ARG ‚àë start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_k > italic_l end_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_J ( italic_r start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_k italic_l end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ) ( italic_œÅ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_k end_POSTSUBSCRIPT start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_Œæ end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_œÅ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_l end_POSTSUBSCRIPT start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_Œæ end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT + italic_œÅ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_k end_POSTSUBSCRIPT start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_Œ∑ end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_œÅ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_l end_POSTSUBSCRIPT start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_Œ∑ end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ) - divide start_ARG 1 end_ARG start_ARG 4 end_ARG ‚àë start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_k > italic_l end_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_K ( italic_r start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_k italic_l end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ) ( 1 + italic_œÅ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_k end_POSTSUBSCRIPT start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_Œ∂ end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ) ( 1 + italic_œÅ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_l end_POSTSUBSCRIPT start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_Œ∂ end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ) (1) +14‚Å¢‚àëk>le2rk‚Å¢l‚Å¢(1‚àíœÅkŒ∂)‚Å¢(1‚àíœÅlŒ∂)‚àí12‚Å¢D‚Å¢‚àëk(1+œÅkŒ∂),14subscriptùëòùëôsuperscriptùëí2subscriptùëüùëòùëô1superscriptsubscriptùúåùëòùúÅ1superscriptsubscriptùúåùëôùúÅ12ùê∑subscriptùëò1superscriptsubscriptùúåùëòùúÅ\\displaystyle+\\,\\frac{1}{4}\\sum_{k>l}\\frac{e^{2}}{r_{kl}}(1-\\rho_{k}^{\\zeta})(% 1-\\rho_{l}^{\\zeta})-\\frac{1}{2}D\\sum_{k}(1+\\rho_{k}^{\\zeta}),+ divide start_ARG 1 end_ARG start_ARG 4 end_ARG ‚àë start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_k > italic_l end_POSTSUBSCRIPT divide start_ARG italic_e start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT end_ARG start_ARG italic_r start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_k italic_l end_POSTSUBSCRIPT end_ARG ( 1 - italic_œÅ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_k end_POSTSUBSCRIPT start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_Œ∂ end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ) ( 1 - italic_œÅ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_l end_POSTSUBSCRIPT start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_Œ∂ end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ) - divide start_ARG 1 end_ARG start_ARG 2 end_ARG italic_D ‚àë start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_k end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( 1 + italic_œÅ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_k end_POSTSUBSCRIPT start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_Œ∂ end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ) ,\n\nwhere MùëÄMitalic_M is the proton or neutron mass, rk‚Å¢l=|ùê´k‚àíùê´l|subscriptùëüùëòùëôsubscriptùê´ùëòsubscriptùê´ùëôr_{kl}=\\left|{\\bf r}_{k}-{\\bf r}_{l}\\right|italic_r start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_k italic_l end_POSTSUBSCRIPT = | bold_r start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_k end_POSTSUBSCRIPT - bold_r start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_l end_POSTSUBSCRIPT | are distances of the order of the nuclear dimensions and ùê©ksubscriptùê©ùëò{\\bf p}_{k}bold_p start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_k end_POSTSUBSCRIPT is the momentum of the kùëòkitalic_k-th nucleon. This formula involves a fifth quantity for the characterization of each particle in addition to the usual ones (i.e. the three position coordinates and the spin œÉzsuperscriptùúéùëß\\sigma^{z}italic_œÉ start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_z end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT along the zùëßzitalic_z-axis), namely a charge œÅŒ∂superscriptùúåùúÅ\\rho^{\\zeta}italic_œÅ start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_Œ∂ end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT, whose values are œÅŒ∂=+1superscriptùúåùúÅ1\\rho^{\\zeta}=+1italic_œÅ start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_Œ∂ end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT = + 1 for a neutron and œÅŒ∂=‚àí1superscriptùúåùúÅ1\\rho^{\\zeta}=-1italic_œÅ start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_Œ∂ end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT = - 1 for a proton respectively.

(8)\n\nThe fifth quantity œÅŒ∂superscriptùúåùúÅ\\rho^{\\zeta}italic_œÅ start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_Œ∂ end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT allowed Heisenberg to interpret the neutron and the proton as the two different states of a ‚Äúnucleon\", so that the Hamiltonian (1) contains transition elements which change œÅŒ∂=+1superscriptùúåùúÅ1\\rho^{\\zeta}=+1italic_œÅ start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_Œ∂ end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT = + 1 into œÅŒ∂=‚àí1superscriptùúåùúÅ1\\rho^{\\zeta}=-1italic_œÅ start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_Œ∂ end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT = - 1, i.e. they transfer a charge between the neutron and the proton. Later, œÅŒ∂superscriptùúåùúÅ\\rho^{\\zeta}italic_œÅ start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_Œ∂ end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT would have been dubbed isotopic spin by Eugene P. Wigner [48].\n\nThen Heisenberg switched to the discussion of the behavior of a nucleus made of nùëõnitalic_n particles, with n1subscriptùëõ1n_{1}italic_n start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT neutrons and n2subscriptùëõ2n_{2}italic_n start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT protons, starting from Eq. (1) and retaining only the first two terms, which are symmetrical with respect to protons and neutrons. In this situation the minimum energy corresponds to a nucleus with n1=n2subscriptùëõ1subscriptùëõ2n_{1}=n_{2}italic_n start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT = italic_n start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT, in agreement with experimental results. By including the last three terms, the minimum energy changes, and corresponds to a different situation in which the ratio between n1subscriptùëõ1n_{1}italic_n start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT and n2subscriptùëõ2n_{2}italic_n start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT is higher than one. However, as Heisenberg noticed, the application to concrete cases needs a careful discussion of nuclear stability. The solution is immediate only for the simplest case of hydrogen isotope of weight two, which is made of one proton and one neutron. The resulting eigenfunction in the lowest energy state is symmetric in the spatial and charge coordinates of the two particles, as a consequence of their spin. This conclusion is a consequence of the positive sign that Heisenberg assumed for J‚Å¢(r)ùêΩùëüJ(r)italic_J ( italic_r ), and is in fact contradicted by experiments, as we shall discuss later.\n\nHeisenberg carried out only a qualitative discussion of the general case, starting from the analysis of nuclei containing neutrons only. On the basis of Eq. (1), a nucleus with two neutrons is expected to be stable, as well as the H‚Å¢eùêªùëíHeitalic_H italic_e nucleus which is made of two protons and two neutrons. Then, he addressed the issue of the stability of the nucleus, taken as a structure containing both neutrons and protons, with the number of neutrons slightly higher than that of protons. He focused on intermediate as well as heavy nuclei, and his primary concern was to find the conditions for stability (against Œ≤ùõΩ\\betaitalic_Œ≤- as well as Œ±ùõº\\alphaitalic_Œ±-decay) and characterize the decay following instability. In particular he carried out a qualitative study of the binding energy of the nuclei as a function of n1subscriptùëõ1n_{1}italic_n start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT and n2subscriptùëõ2n_{2}italic_n start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT. These topics were deepened in the second paper [12], where the energy differences between nuclei with even n1subscriptùëõ1n_{1}italic_n start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT and n2subscriptùëõ2n_{2}italic_n start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT, odd n1subscriptùëõ1n_{1}italic_n start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT and n2subscriptùëõ2n_{2}italic_n start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT, odd n1subscriptùëõ1n_{1}italic_n start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT or n2subscriptùëõ2n_{2}italic_n start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT, were studied.\n\nIn Ref. [12], Heisenberg addressed two further issues, the scattering of Œ≥ùõæ\\gammaitalic_Œ≥-rays by atomic nuclei and the properties of the neutron, which will be the topic of the third paper of the series, published in 1933 [13]. With respect to the scattering of Œ≥ùõæ\\gammaitalic_Œ≥-rays, Heisenberg‚Äôs explanation made crucial use of the assumption of the neutron as a bound state of a proton and an electron. The composite structure of the neutron implies that not only the motion of the protons and neutrons changes due to the effect of the external radiation, but also that the nuclear electrons inside neutrons get excited. Though wrong, these hypotheses lead him to a satisfactory explanation of the anomalous scattering of Œ≥ùõæ\\gammaitalic_Œ≥-rays on nuclei (known as the Meitner-H√ºpfeld effect [49, 50, 51]). The second mechanism is more effective thanks to the small mass of the electron and gives a significant contribution to the total scattering, which could be in agreement with experimental data. Concerning the properties of the neutron, Heisenberg made a comparison between the two hypotheses on the nature of this particle (elementary particle without structure versus composite system of a proton and an electron). While the second hypothesis seemed to work well both in the case of Œ≤ùõΩ\\betaitalic_Œ≤-decay and in explaining the nature of exchange interaction within the nuclei, it brought about several conceptual difficulties, which led him again to question the validity of quantum mechanics at the nuclear scale. In particular, the uncertainty principle gives for the mass defect of the neutron an energy of the order of 137‚Å¢m‚Å¢c2137ùëösuperscriptùëê2137\\ mc^{2}137 italic_m italic_c start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT, while the observed mass defect is about a hundred times smaller and has the opposite sign. Furthermore, quite different values of the binding energy of the nuclear electron are obtained depending on the experiments devised to measure it.\n\nHeisenberg‚Äôs third paper on nuclear forces [13] further extends the ideas introduced in the previous papers [11, 12] starting from a generalized Hamiltonian, obtained by augmenting Eq.

Then, an approximate solution was found by applying the Thomas-Fermi method to the case of many-particle nuclei.

The analysis of these drawbacks was the starting point of Majorana‚Äôs work.\n\n6.2 Preliminary work on nuclear forces\n\nA turning point in Yukawa‚Äôs scientific career came in 1932, as he recalled in his autobiography [20] when talking about the scientific events of that year:\n\nThe year 1932 was even more turbulent for physics than it was for my personal life. Events, each of which, taken alone, could be called revolutionary, occurred three in a row: first, there was the discovery of the neutron; second, the discovery of the positron; third, the atomic nucleus was broken up by artificial means, namely by the use of the particle accelerators. The discipline that is now called nuclear physics was until then a minor branch of study, but because of those three events, it suddenly became the mainstream ([20], pp. 310-311).\n\nAccording to Yukawa, the discovery of neutron was a very significant event for theoretical physics, because it brought into play the idea that the nucleus is built of protons and neutrons. Heisenberg‚Äôs papers on nuclear structure [11, 12, 13] deeply impressed the young Yukawa, who wrote an introduction to the Japanese translation of these papers to be published in the Proceedings of the Physico-Mathematical Society of Japan [20, 28]. This event marked the beginning of his struggle towards the building of his new theory of nuclear forces. In Yukawa‚Äôs own words:\n\nThe problem that I focused on was that the nature of the forces that act upon the neutrons and protons making up the nucleus ‚Äì that is, the nature of the nuclear forces. By confronting this difficult problem, I committed myself to long days of suffering. [‚Ä¶] The fact that I was suffering, however, was very satisfying to me; I felt like a traveler carrying a heavy burden and struggling up a slope ([20], p. 312).\n\nHis starting point was the consideration that, after the introduction of quantum mechanics, the only primary (or fundamental) forces in nature were identified with gravity and electromagnetism. As a main and common feature, both forces were expressed in terms of fields. Thus, an answer had to be provided to the question whether nuclear forces were additional primary ones or not. In principle, in fact, the weakness of both gravity and electromagnetic force prevents them to be the source of nuclear force. Furthermore, electromagnetism could not account for the attraction of protons within the nucleus as well as for the interactions of neutrons, which are electrically neutral. Thus the consideration that strange things happen when thinking to the nuclear force as a secondary one, to be derived from electromagnetism, led Yukawa to view nuclear forces as new fundamental ones and, as such, described by means of a suitable field. Quantum mechanics then played a crucial role, as recalled by Yukawa in his autobiography, in driving him to conceive the idea of meson. But, despite having conceived the general idea early on, the actual implementation of his program would turn out to be very hard, and lasted two years:\n\nI had this idea of a nuclear force field very early. Looked at from the quantum mechanical viewpoint, a field of force, almost by necessity, implies that there is a particle accompanying that field. [‚Ä¶] I had to take a wrong path first, before I could arrive at my destination. [‚Ä¶] In retrospect, I was very close to my destination in 1932. Had I pursued the notion of the field of nuclear force, and applied quantum mechanical reasoning, I should have been able to come up with the idea of the meson. Instead, I spent the next two years searching in the dark ([20], pp. 320-321).\n\nYukawa started his investigations by following Heisenberg‚Äôs idea of the nuclear force as an exchange of an electron between protons and neutrons [11] and presented some preliminary results at the meeting of the Physico-Mathematical Society of Japan held in April 1933 at the T≈çhoku University in Sendai. He gave a talk entitled ‚ÄúA Comment on the Problem of Electrons in the Nucleus‚Äù, but he did not publish the corresponding manuscript in a journal. This and his subsequent work in 1933-34, most of which is unpublished, were an important preliminary step towards the research he would have carried out in the following years, and as such are of great historical interest in order to reconstruct his path to meson theory. In Sendai, Yukawa also met Yagi Hidetsugu, head of the Physics Department of ≈åsaka University, and this circumstance led him to move to ≈åsaka to join the nuclear research group, which had a Cockroft-Walton accelerator. He recalled that ‚Äúit was very stimulating to know that experiments would take place simultaneously with the theoretical studies‚Äù ([20], p. 326).\n\nThe 1933 talk contains Yukawa‚Äôs first idea of an exchange force due to an electron shuttling between the neutron and the proton, along with a careful analysis of the many difficulties he met. In the abstract we can find his program:\n\nWe can consider that, by analogy with radiation (in the same sense that the radiation is the mediator of interactions between electrons, protons and other charged particles), the electron is the mediator of the interaction between proton and neutron and acts like a kind of field in the inside of nuclei. Then, we may solve the [‚Ä¶] equation for the electron to find the form of interaction between neutron and proton. From the fact that the electron has the finite rest mass, we may expect that the interaction energy would decrease rapidly as the distance between neutron and proton becomes large in comparison with h/(2‚Å¢œÄ‚Å¢m‚Å¢c)‚Ñé2ùúãùëöùëêh/(2\\pi mc)italic_h / ( 2 italic_œÄ italic_m italic_c ).\n\nA critical analysis of Heisenberg‚Äôs papers on nuclear forces [11, 12, 13] led Yukawa to exclude the picture of the neutron as a bound state made of a proton and an electron, because of the incompatibility with quantum mechanics. In fact, he noticed that the uncertainty relation would give a value E=137‚Å¢m‚Å¢c2ùê∏137ùëösuperscriptùëê2E=137\\ mc^{2}italic_E = 137 italic_m italic_c start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT for the neutron mass defect, which differs by a factor 102superscript10210^{2}10 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT from the correct value m‚Å¢c2ùëösuperscriptùëê2mc^{2}italic_m italic_c start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT (such a discrepancy had been noticed also by Heisenberg [12]). Likewise, the analysis of the anomalous dispersion of Œ≥ùõæ\\gammaitalic_Œ≥-rays as due mainly to neutrons gives the value 42.6‚Å¢m‚Å¢c242.6ùëösuperscriptùëê242.6\\ mc^{2}42.6 italic_m italic_c start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT for the eigenfrequency of neutron, which is again very different from that obtained with the correct mass defect and, moreover, different from the previous one. Thus Yukawa made the assumption that the neutron is an elementary particle, and reinterpreted Heisenberg‚Äôs exchange interaction between the proton and the neutron, as well as that between two neutrons, as due to a mediator, the electron, whose role would be analog to that played by radiation in the electromagnetic interaction. Following these guidelines he expected to derive the form of the interaction between proton and neutron and to explain Œ≤ùõΩ\\betaitalic_Œ≤-decay. In fact, after the recognition that the mediator of the interaction could not be the electron but a new, much heavier bosonic particle, he basically followed the same steps outlined in his 1933 talk (as we shall see below). Before trying to implement his program, Yukawa dwelled on some interesting considerations concerning the mathematical expression of the exchange interaction J‚Å¢(r)ùêΩùëüJ(r)italic_J ( italic_r ). These are very interesting in view of understanding how Yukawa arrived at the form J‚Å¢(r)=‚àíg2‚Å¢e‚àíŒª‚Å¢rrùêΩùëüsuperscriptùëî2superscriptùëíùúÜùëüùëüJ(r)=-g^{2}\\frac{e^{-\\lambda r}}{r}italic_J ( italic_r ) = - italic_g start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT divide start_ARG italic_e start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT - italic_Œª italic_r end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT end_ARG start_ARG italic_r end_ARG, which would later be the basis of his meson theory. He suggested that this form could be obtained by a phenomenological approach:\n\nTo solve this problem, the most effective method at present might be to calculate the scattering of neutrons on nuclei by assuming a suitable interaction between neutrons and nuclei, and comparing the results with experiment ([79], p. 251).\n\nIn particular he hinted to a force decreasing rapidly with the distance and made reference to a paper by Harrie S. W. Massey [80], where elastic collisions of neutrons with material particles were considered. In this paper the neutron was modeled as an atom with an electron moving in a field of very high effective nuclear charge ZùëçZitalic_Z (to account for its smallness with respect to a hydrogen atom), given by\n\nV‚Å¢(r)=e2‚Å¢(1r+Za0)‚Å¢e‚àí2‚Å¢Z‚Å¢ra0,ùëâùëüsuperscriptùëí21ùëüùëçsubscriptùëé0superscriptùëí2ùëçùëüsubscriptùëé0\\displaystyle V(r)=e^{2}\\left(\\frac{1}{r}+\\frac{Z}{a_{0}}\\right)e^{-\\frac{2Zr}% {a_{0}}},italic_V ( italic_r ) = italic_e start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ( divide start_ARG 1 end_ARG start_ARG italic_r end_ARG + divide start_ARG italic_Z end_ARG start_ARG italic_a start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 0 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT end_ARG ) italic_e start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT - divide start_ARG 2 italic_Z italic_r end_ARG start_ARG italic_a start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 0 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT end_ARG end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT , (24)\n\na0subscriptùëé0a_{0}italic_a start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 0 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT being the Bohr radius and a0/Zsubscriptùëé0ùëç{a_{0}}/{Z}italic_a start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 0 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT / italic_Z the radius of the neutron. This expression shows a similar behavior if compared with Yukawa‚Äôs interaction. Calculations on collisions of neutrons with matter were also carried out in the same years by Nishina, Tomonaga and collaborators, who worked also on the neutron-proton interaction by using various expressions for the potential J‚Å¢(r)ùêΩùëüJ(r)italic_J ( italic_r ), including A‚Å¢e‚àíŒº‚Å¢rrùê¥superscriptùëíùúáùëüùëüA\\frac{e^{-\\mu r}}{r}italic_A divide start_ARG italic_e start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT - italic_Œº italic_r end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT end_ARG start_ARG italic_r end_ARG [21, 30]. Furthermore the topic was the subject of a talk given by Tomonaga, again at the meeting of the Physico-Mathematical Society of Japan of April 1933 in Sendai, and of a subsequent interplay between Tomonaga and Yukawa [82, 83, 84]. We will deal in detail with Tomonaga‚Äôs contribution in the next Section. One can infer that in 1933 both Yukawa and Tomonaga had an idea of the interaction A‚Å¢e‚àíŒº‚Å¢rrùê¥superscriptùëíùúáùëüùëüA\\frac{e^{-\\mu r}}{r}italic_A divide start_ARG italic_e start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT - italic_Œº italic_r end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT end_ARG start_ARG italic_r end_ARG, but the deep meaning of this formula, and in particular the implications for the range and the mass of the virtual mediating particle, were still unknown.\n\nAfter these considerations, Yukawa went back to his theoretical program, describing it as follows:\n\nA neutron can emit an electron and change to a proton, and a proton can absorb an electron and change to a neutron. This fact is itself the cause of the interaction between proton and neutron; in other words, neutron and proton create the electron field, i.e., the field of the electron wave, and are affected by it ([79], pp. 251-252).\n\nIn such a situation the total number of electrons changes with time, so that the electron has to obey to a Dirac equation which contains a source term involving neutrons and protons. Likewise protons and neutrons obey a similar Dirac equation with a source term involving both neutron, proton and electron. These equations are as follows (Yukawa also included an electromagnetic vector potential, but he subsequently set it to zero, hence we do not include it here):\n\n1c‚Å¢L11ùëêsubscriptùêø1\\displaystyle\\frac{1}{c}L_{1}divide start_ARG 1 end_ARG start_ARG italic_c end_ARG italic_L start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT =\\displaystyle== {Wc+œÅ1‚Å¢œÉ‚ãÖùê©+œÅ3‚Å¢m‚Å¢c}‚Å¢œà=œá‚Ä†‚Å¢Œ≥‚Å¢œá,ùëäùëê‚ãÖsubscriptùúå1ùúéùê©subscriptùúå3ùëöùëêùúìsuperscriptùúí‚Ä†ùõæùúí\\displaystyle\\left\\{\\frac{W}{c}+\\rho_{1}\\mathbf{\\sigma}\\cdot\\mathbf{p}+\\rho_{3% }mc\\right\\}\\psi=\\chi^{\\dagger}\\gamma\\chi\\,,{ divide start_ARG italic_W end_ARG start_ARG italic_c end_ARG + italic_œÅ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_œÉ ‚ãÖ bold_p + italic_œÅ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 3 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_m italic_c } italic_œà = italic_œá start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ‚Ä† end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_Œ≥ italic_œá , (25) 1c‚Å¢L21ùëêsubscriptùêø2\\displaystyle\\frac{1}{c}L_{2}divide start_ARG 1 end_ARG start_ARG italic_c end_ARG italic_L start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT =\\displaystyle== {Wc+œÅ1‚Ä≤‚Å¢œÉ‚ãÖùê©+œÅ3‚Å¢(1+œÑ32‚Å¢M‚Å¢c+1‚àíœÑ32‚Å¢M‚Ä≤‚Å¢c)}‚Å¢œá=(Œ≥‚Å¢œà‚Ä†+Œ≥‚Ä†‚Å¢œà)‚Å¢œá,ùëäùëê‚ãÖsubscriptsuperscriptùúå‚Ä≤1ùúéùê©subscriptùúå31subscriptùúè32ùëÄùëê1subscriptùúè32superscriptùëÄ‚Ä≤ùëêùúíùõæsuperscriptùúì‚Ä†superscriptùõæ‚Ä†ùúìùúí\\displaystyle\\left\\{\\frac{W}{c}+\\rho^{\\prime}_{1}\\mathbf{\\sigma}\\cdot\\mathbf{p% }+\\rho_{3}\\left(\\frac{1+\\tau_{3}}{2}Mc+\\frac{1-\\tau_{3}}{2}M^{\\prime}c\\right)% \\right\\}\\chi=\\left(\\gamma\\psi^{\\dagger}+\\gamma^{\\dagger}\\psi\\right)\\chi\\,,{ divide start_ARG italic_W end_ARG start_ARG italic_c end_ARG + italic_œÅ start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ‚Ä≤ end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_œÉ ‚ãÖ bold_p + italic_œÅ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 3 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( divide start_ARG 1 + italic_œÑ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 3 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT end_ARG start_ARG 2 end_ARG italic_M italic_c + divide start_ARG 1 - italic_œÑ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 3 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT end_ARG start_ARG 2 end_ARG italic_M start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ‚Ä≤ end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_c ) } italic_œá = ( italic_Œ≥ italic_œà start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ‚Ä† end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT + italic_Œ≥ start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ‚Ä† end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_œà ) italic_œá , (26)\n\nwhere œàùúì\\psiitalic_œà is the wave function of the electron, œáùúí\\chiitalic_œá is the wave function of the proton and of the neutron, L1subscriptùêø1L_{1}italic_L start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT and L2subscriptùêø2L_{2}italic_L start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT are the Dirac operators for electron and neutron-proton respectively, œÑisubscriptùúèùëñ\\tau_{i}italic_œÑ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT (i=1,2,3ùëñ123i=1,2,3italic_i = 1 , 2 , 3) are the isotopic spin matrices and Œ≥ùõæ\\gammaitalic_Œ≥, Œ≥‚Ä†superscriptùõæ‚Ä†\\gamma^{\\dagger}italic_Œ≥ start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ‚Ä† end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT are two unknown 4√ó4444\\times 44 √ó 4 matrices to be determined in order to find the form of the interaction between electrons, protons and neutrons.

From these, he derived the Heisenberg equations of motion for the nuclear field operators, which were in perfect agreement with the previous ones (26), while for the electron field operators the result was different from Eq. (25). He noticed that, if Bose statistics (i.e., commutation relations) is assumed instead for the electron, the results were in agreement with previous equations of motion. At this point, Yukawa assumed the validity of equations (25) and (26) and switched to the task of finding the specific form of the proton-neutron interaction from them. He looked for a particular solution of the electron wave equation satisfying the condition œà=0ùúì0\\psi=0italic_œà = 0 for œá=0ùúí0\\chi=0italic_œá = 0, obtaining:\n\nœà0=(p0c‚àíœÅ1‚Å¢œÉ‚ãÖùê©‚àíœÅ3‚Å¢m‚Å¢c)‚Å¢14‚Å¢œÄ‚Å¢‚Ñè2‚Å¢\\bigints‚Å¢\\bigints‚Å¢\\bigints‚Å¢œá‚Ä†‚Å¢Œ≥‚Å¢ei‚Ñè‚Å¢œÅ3‚Å¢m‚Å¢c‚Å¢|ùê´‚Ä≤‚àíùê´|‚Å¢œá‚Å¢(ùê´‚Ä≤,t‚àí|ùê´‚Ä≤‚àíùê´|c)|ùê´‚Ä≤‚àíùê´|‚Å¢d‚Å¢v‚Ä≤+‚Ä¶.subscriptùúì0subscriptùëù0ùëê‚ãÖsubscriptùúå1ùúéùê©subscriptùúå3ùëöùëê14ùúãsuperscriptPlanck-constant-over-2-pi2\\bigints\\bigints\\bigintssuperscriptùúí‚Ä†ùõæsuperscriptùëíùëñPlanck-constant-over-2-pisubscriptùúå3ùëöùëêsuperscriptùê´‚Ä≤ùê´ùúísuperscriptùê´‚Ä≤ùë°superscriptùê´‚Ä≤ùê´ùëêsuperscriptùê´‚Ä≤ùê´ùëësuperscriptùë£‚Ä≤‚Ä¶\\displaystyle\\psi_{0}=\\left(\\frac{p_{0}}{c}-\\rho_{1}\\mathbf{\\sigma}\\cdot% \\mathbf{p}-\\rho_{3}mc\\right)\\!\\frac{1}{4\\pi\\hbar^{2}}\\!\\!\\!\\!\\bigints\\!\\!\\!\\!% \\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\bigints\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\bigints\\!\\!\\!\\!\\frac{\\chi^{\\dagger}% \\gamma e^{\\frac{i}{\\hbar}\\rho_{3}mc\\left|{\\bf r}^{{}^{\\prime}}-{\\bf r}\\right|}% \\chi\\!\\left({\\bf r}^{{}^{\\prime}},t-\\frac{\\left|{\\bf r}^{{}^{\\prime}}-{\\bf r}% \\right|}{c}\\right)}{\\left|{\\bf r}^{{}^{\\prime}}-{\\bf r}\\right|}dv^{{}^{\\prime}% }\\!+\\!...\\,.italic_œà start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 0 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT = ( divide start_ARG italic_p start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 0 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT end_ARG start_ARG italic_c end_ARG - italic_œÅ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_œÉ ‚ãÖ bold_p - italic_œÅ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 3 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_m italic_c ) divide start_ARG 1 end_ARG start_ARG 4 italic_œÄ roman_‚Ñè start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT end_ARG divide start_ARG italic_œá start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ‚Ä† end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_Œ≥ italic_e start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT divide start_ARG italic_i end_ARG start_ARG roman_‚Ñè end_ARG italic_œÅ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 3 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_m italic_c | bold_r start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT start_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT ‚Ä≤ end_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT - bold_r | end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_œá ( bold_r start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT start_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT ‚Ä≤ end_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT , italic_t - divide start_ARG | bold_r start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT start_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT ‚Ä≤ end_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT - bold_r | end_ARG start_ARG italic_c end_ARG ) end_ARG start_ARG | bold_r start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT start_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT ‚Ä≤ end_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT - bold_r | end_ARG italic_d italic_v start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT start_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT ‚Ä≤ end_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT + ‚Ä¶ . (28)\n\nThen, upon substituting this solution into the Hamiltonian, he finally obtained the interaction energy, which however had a Coulomb form, not the expected behavior. He concluded that a well behaved result could be obtained by taking into account the Fermi statistics for the electron, but the calculations appeared to be too hard to deal with. This failure was acknowledged in the talk, where Yukawa admitted that\n\nIn any case, the practical calculation does not yield the looked-for result that the interaction term decreases rapidly as the distance becomes larger than h/(2‚Å¢œÄ‚Å¢m‚Å¢c),‚Ñé2ùúãùëöùëêh/(2\\pi mc),italic_h / ( 2 italic_œÄ italic_m italic_c ) , unlike what I wrote in the abstract of this talk ([79], p.249).\n\nIn Yukawa‚Äôs opinion, the failure had its roots in the incompleteness of relativistic quantum mechanics, which led him to study quantum field theoretical issues and, in particular, foundational problems in the following year. Indeed, the 1933 talk begins right away with the words:\n\nThe problems of atomic nuclei, especially the problem of electrons in the nucleus, might not be solved until we reflect on the foundation of quantum mechanics and complete the correct relativistic quantum theory. It cannot be solved only by partial and formal modification of the theory ([79], p. 248).\n\nAccordingly, in April 1934, again at the annual meeting of the Physico-Mathematical Society of Japan, he gave the talk ‚ÄúOn the Probability Amplitude in Relativistic Quantum Mechanics‚Äù, focusing on topics related to the foundations of quantum field theory, where an early attempt at a better foundation for relativistic quantum mechanics was reported. In this talk he introduced for the first time his idea of the maru, which literally means ‚Äúcircle‚Äù, but in fact denotes a closed surface within the four dimensional space-time on which fields should be quantized. This work was a precursor of the non-local field theory he would have developed in 1950s, while it later inspired Tomonaga in developing his super-many-time theory [86], which formed the basis of his Nobel prize winning approach to covariant QED. Yukawa strongly believed that a solution of the internal inconsistency problem in relativistic quantum field theory would provide useful insights for the construction of an unifying picture of elementary particles.\n\n6.3 Yukawa‚Äôs theory of nuclear forces and the meson\n\nThere were no novelties in Yukawa‚Äôs research on nuclear forces until late spring 1934, when Yukawa read Fermi‚Äôs paper on Œ≤ùõΩ\\betaitalic_Œ≤-decay and became aware of Pauli‚Äôs neutrino hypothesis. Then he independently tried to construct a model of nuclear force based on the exchange of the pair electron-neutrino but, as Heisenberg and other physicists before him, he found that the resulting force was too small to be a viable candidate. So he changed his strategy. Instead of trying to get the nuclear forces from the existing theory, he started focusing on the characteristics of the nuclear force field which were inferred from experiment. He postulated the existence of a brand-new field which would be in the same relation to nuclear forces as the electromagnetic field is to electrostatic forces, and was tailored to meet the phenomenological requirements. His struggle ended in October, when the fog disappeared and the truth arose:\n\nThe nuclear force is effective at extremely small distances, on the order of 0.02 trillionth of a centimeter. That much I knew already. My new insight was the realization that this distance and the mass of the new particle that I was seeking are inversely related to each other. Why had I not noticed that before? The next morning, I tackled the problem of the mass of the new particle and found it to be about two hundred times that of the electron. It also had to have the charge of plus or minus that of the electron. Such a particle had not, of course, been found, so I asked myself, ‚ÄúWhy not?‚Äù The answer was simple: an energy of 100 million electron volts would be needed to create such a particle, and there was no accelerator, at that time, with that much energy available ([20], p. 324).\n\nThe work was presented in November 1934 to the meeting of the T≈çky≈ç Center of the Physico-Mathematical Society of Japan and met the interest of Nishina. The corresponding paper, Yukawa‚Äôs famous meson paper, was written and submitted for publication by the end of the same month.\n\nBefore addressing Yukawa‚Äôs work, it is very useful to quote a passage of his first publication, i.e. the introduction to the Japanese translation of the 1932 Heisenberg‚Äôs papers on nuclear structure, written in 1933 [28]:\n\nThough Heisenberg does not present a definite view on whether neutrons should be seen as separate entities or as combinations of a proton and an electron, this problem, like the Œ≤ùõΩ\\betaitalic_Œ≤ decay problem stated above, cannot be resolved with today‚Äôs theory. And unless these problems are resolved, one cannot say whether the view that electrons have no independent existence in the nucleus is correct ([28], p. 122).\n\nAs testified by his words, the starting point of his investigation is a deep analysis of Heisenberg‚Äôs picture of neutrons and of unsolved problems, like Œ≤ùõΩ\\betaitalic_Œ≤ decay. Indeed Fermi‚Äôs theory would have been published a year later, in 1934, and would have been taken as a reference in his 1935 seminal work [26], together with the Platzwechsel interaction postulated by Heisenberg and the conclusions by Tamm [67] and Iwanenko [68], which led to rule out a neutron-proton interaction mediated by an exchange of an electron-neutrino pair. Then he clearly outlines his strategy and the ultimate goal of his work:\n\nTo remove this defect, it seems natural to modify the theory of Heisenberg and Fermi in the following way. The transition of a heavy particle from neutron state to proton state is not always accompanied by the emission of light particles, i.e., a neutrino and an electron, but the energy liberated by the transition is taken up sometimes by another heavy particle, which in turn will be transformed from proton state into neutron state. If the probability of occurrence of the latter process is much larger than that of the former, the interaction between the neutron and the proton will be much larger than in the case of Fermi, whereas the probability of emission of light particles is not affected essentially. Now such interaction between the elementary particles can be described by means of a field of force, just as the interaction between the charged particles is described by the electromagnetic field. The above considerations show that the interaction of heavy particles with this field is much larger than that of light particles with it ([26], p. 48).\n\nAlso here the analogy with the electromagnetic case is pursued, so that Yukawa‚Äôs purpose is to look for this new field, to define its quantum and to investigate the corresponding properties. As a starting point, he adopts a semiclassical approach. The required scalar field U‚Å¢(x,y,z,t)ùëàùë•ùë¶ùëßùë°U(x,y,z,t)italic_U ( italic_x , italic_y , italic_z , italic_t ) has to decrease rapidly with the distance, so its behavior is assumed to be described by the following function:\n\n¬±g2‚Å¢e‚àíŒª‚Å¢rr,plus-or-minussuperscriptùëî2superscriptùëíùúÜùëüùëü\\displaystyle\\pm g^{2}\\,\\frac{e^{-\\lambda r}}{r},¬± italic_g start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT divide start_ARG italic_e start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT - italic_Œª italic_r end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT end_ARG start_ARG italic_r end_ARG , (29)\n\nwhich is the static, spherically symmetric solution of the Klein-Gordon equation in vacuum:\n\n(Œî‚àí1c2‚Å¢‚àÇ2‚àÇt2‚àíŒª2)‚Å¢U=0.Œî1superscriptùëê2superscript2superscriptùë°2superscriptùúÜ2ùëà0\\displaystyle\\left(\\Delta-\\frac{1}{c^{2}}\\frac{\\partial^{2}}{\\partial t^{2}}-% \\lambda^{2}\\right)U=0.( roman_Œî - divide start_ARG 1 end_ARG start_ARG italic_c start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT end_ARG divide start_ARG ‚àÇ start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT end_ARG start_ARG ‚àÇ italic_t start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT end_ARG - italic_Œª start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ) italic_U = 0 . (30)\n\nIn Eq. (29), gùëîgitalic_g and ŒªùúÜ\\lambdaitalic_Œª are constants with the dimensions of an electric charge and of cm‚àí11{}^{-1}start_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT - 1 end_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT, respectively, so that the range of forces is of the order of 1/Œª1ùúÜ{1}/{\\lambda}1 / italic_Œª.\n\nThen Yukawa adds heavy particles (i.e., neutrons and protons) in order to study their interaction with the UùëàUitalic_U-field, whose effect is the transition from the neutron state to the proton state. This new situation is implemented by adding a source term to Eq. (30), so that the UùëàUitalic_U-field satisfies the new equation:\n\n(Œî‚àí1c2‚Å¢‚àÇ2‚àÇt2‚àíŒª2)‚Å¢U=‚àí4‚Å¢œÄ‚Å¢g‚Å¢œà~‚Å¢(œÅŒæ‚àíi‚Å¢œÅŒ∑2)‚Å¢œà,Œî1superscriptùëê2superscript2superscriptùë°2superscriptùúÜ2ùëà4ùúãùëî~ùúìsuperscriptùúåùúâùëñsuperscriptùúåùúÇ2ùúì\\displaystyle\\left(\\Delta-\\frac{1}{c^{2}}\\frac{\\partial^{2}}{\\partial t^{2}}-% \\lambda^{2}\\right)U=-4\\pi g\\,\\tilde{\\psi}\\left(\\frac{\\rho^{\\xi}-i\\rho^{\\eta}}{% 2}\\right)\\psi,( roman_Œî - divide start_ARG 1 end_ARG start_ARG italic_c start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT end_ARG divide start_ARG ‚àÇ start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT end_ARG start_ARG ‚àÇ italic_t start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT end_ARG - italic_Œª start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ) italic_U = - 4 italic_œÄ italic_g over~ start_ARG italic_œà end_ARG ( divide start_ARG italic_œÅ start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_Œæ end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT - italic_i italic_œÅ start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_Œ∑ end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT end_ARG start_ARG 2 end_ARG ) italic_œà , (31)\n\nœÅŒæsuperscriptùúåùúâ\\rho^{\\xi}italic_œÅ start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_Œæ end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT and œÅŒ∑superscriptùúåùúÇ\\rho^{\\eta}italic_œÅ start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_Œ∑ end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT being the isotopic spin matrices introduced in Eq. (8) and œàùúì\\psiitalic_œà is the wave function of the heavy particles (which is a function of time, position, spin and isotopic spin).\n\nLikewise, the complex conjugate field U~‚Å¢(x,y,z,t)~ùëàùë•ùë¶ùëßùë°\\tilde{U}(x,y,z,t)over~ start_ARG italic_U end_ARG ( italic_x , italic_y , italic_z , italic_t ) is introduced, satisfying the equation\n\n(Œî‚àí1c2‚Å¢‚àÇ2‚àÇt2‚àíŒª2)‚Å¢U~=‚àí4‚Å¢œÄ‚Å¢g‚Å¢œà~‚Å¢(œÅŒæ+i‚Å¢œÅŒ∑2)‚Å¢œà,Œî1superscriptùëê2superscript2superscriptùë°2superscriptùúÜ2~ùëà4ùúãùëî~ùúìsuperscriptùúåùúâùëñsuperscriptùúåùúÇ2ùúì\\displaystyle\\left(\\Delta-\\frac{1}{c^{2}}\\frac{\\partial^{2}}{\\partial t^{2}}-% \\lambda^{2}\\right)\\tilde{U}=-4\\pi g\\,\\tilde{\\psi}\\left(\\frac{\\rho^{\\xi}+i\\rho^% {\\eta}}{2}\\right)\\psi,( roman_Œî - divide start_ARG 1 end_ARG start_ARG italic_c start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT end_ARG divide start_ARG ‚àÇ start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT end_ARG start_ARG ‚àÇ italic_t start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT end_ARG - italic_Œª start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ) over~ start_ARG italic_U end_ARG = - 4 italic_œÄ italic_g over~ start_ARG italic_œà end_ARG ( divide start_ARG italic_œÅ start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_Œæ end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT + italic_i italic_œÅ start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_Œ∑ end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT end_ARG start_ARG 2 end_ARG ) italic_œà , (32)\n\nand gives rise to the inverse transition from the proton state to the neutron state. In pursuing the analogy with the electromagnetic case, at this point Yukawa does not take into account the vector potential ‚Äúas there‚Äôs no correct relativistic theory for the heavy particles‚Äù ([26], p. 50). He would have worked out the complete vector meson theory only later, in 1938 [88]. Then, from a non relativistic wave equation for the heavy particle, by neglecting the spin and a constant term, he was able to derive the full Hamiltonian for a system of two heavy particles at positions (x1,y1,z1)subscriptùë•1subscriptùë¶1subscriptùëß1(x_{1},y_{1},z_{1})( italic_x start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT , italic_y start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT , italic_z start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ) and (x2,y2,z2)subscriptùë•2subscriptùë¶2subscriptùëß2(x_{2},y_{2},z_{2})( italic_x start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT , italic_y start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT , italic_z start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ) and with a small relative velocity:\n\nH=ùê©122‚Å¢M+ùê©222‚Å¢M+g22‚Å¢(œÅ1Œæ‚Å¢œÅ2Œæ+œÅ1Œ∑‚Å¢œÅ2Œ∑)‚Å¢e‚àíŒª‚Å¢r12r12+(œÅ1Œ∂+œÅ2Œ∂)‚Å¢D,ùêªsuperscriptsubscriptùê©122ùëÄsuperscriptsubscriptùê©222ùëÄsuperscriptùëî22superscriptsubscriptùúå1ùúâsuperscriptsubscriptùúå2ùúâsuperscriptsubscriptùúå1ùúÇsuperscriptsubscriptùúå2ùúÇsuperscriptùëíùúÜsubscriptùëü12subscriptùëü12superscriptsubscriptùúå1ùúÅsuperscriptsubscriptùúå2ùúÅùê∑\\displaystyle H=\\frac{{\\bf p}_{1}^{2}}{2M}+\\frac{{\\bf p}_{2}^{2}}{2M}+\\frac{g^% {2}}{2}\\left(\\rho_{1}^{\\xi}\\rho_{2}^{\\xi}+\\rho_{1}^{\\eta}\\rho_{2}^{\\eta}\\right% )\\frac{e^{-\\lambda r_{12}}}{r_{12}}+\\left(\\rho_{1}^{\\zeta}+\\rho_{2}^{\\zeta}% \\right)D,italic_H = divide start_ARG bold_p start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT end_ARG start_ARG 2 italic_M end_ARG + divide start_ARG bold_p start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT end_ARG start_ARG 2 italic_M end_ARG + divide start_ARG italic_g start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT end_ARG start_ARG 2 end_ARG ( italic_œÅ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_Œæ end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_œÅ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_Œæ end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT + italic_œÅ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_Œ∑ end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_œÅ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_Œ∑ end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ) divide start_ARG italic_e start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT - italic_Œª italic_r start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 12 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT end_ARG start_ARG italic_r start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 12 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT end_ARG + ( italic_œÅ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_Œ∂ end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT + italic_œÅ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_Œ∂ end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ) italic_D , (33)\n\nwhere ùê©1subscriptùê©1{\\bf p}_{1}bold_p start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT, ùê©2subscriptùê©2{\\bf p}_{2}bold_p start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT are the momenta of the heavy particles, (œÅ1Œæ,œÅ1Œ∑,œÅ1Œ∂)superscriptsubscriptùúå1ùúâsuperscriptsubscriptùúå1ùúÇsuperscriptsubscriptùúå1ùúÅ(\\rho_{1}^{\\xi},\\rho_{1}^{\\eta},\\rho_{1}^{\\zeta})( italic_œÅ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_Œæ end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT , italic_œÅ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_Œ∑ end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT , italic_œÅ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_Œ∂ end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ) and (œÅ2Œæ,œÅ2Œ∑,œÅ2Œ∂)superscriptsubscriptùúå2ùúâsuperscriptsubscriptùúå2ùúÇsuperscriptsubscriptùúå2ùúÅ(\\rho_{2}^{\\xi},\\rho_{2}^{\\eta},\\rho_{2}^{\\zeta})( italic_œÅ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_Œæ end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT , italic_œÅ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_Œ∑ end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT , italic_œÅ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_Œ∂ end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ) are the corresponding isotopic spin matrices, r12subscriptùëü12r_{12}italic_r start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 12 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT is the distance between them and Dùê∑Ditalic_D is the mass defect between proton and neutron. As he pointed out:\n\nThis Hamiltonian is equivalent to Heisenberg‚Äôs Hamiltonian, if we take for ‚ÄúPlatzwechseintegral‚Äù J‚Å¢(r)=‚àíg2‚Å¢e‚àíŒª‚Å¢rrùêΩùëüsuperscriptùëî2superscriptùëíùúÜùëüùëüJ(r)=-g^{2}\\frac{e^{-\\lambda r}}{r}italic_J ( italic_r ) = - italic_g start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT divide start_ARG italic_e start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT - italic_Œª italic_r end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT end_ARG start_ARG italic_r end_ARG, except that the interaction between the neutrons and the electrostatic repulsion between the protons are not taken into account ([26], p. 51).\n\nIndeed a comparison with Heisenberg‚Äôs expression in Eq. (1) clearly shows analogies and differences. Besides the explicit expression of J‚Å¢(r)ùêΩùëüJ(r)italic_J ( italic_r ), its overall sign comes out negative, so that the lowest energy state of H2superscriptùêª2H^{2}italic_H start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT has spin 1111 as required by experiments. This happens at odds with Heisenberg‚Äôs choice, which brought to a lowest energy state with spin 00. Finally, the constants gùëîgitalic_g and ŒªùúÜ\\lambdaitalic_Œª can be determined from experimental data, and an agreement is found when taking ŒªùúÜ\\lambdaitalic_Œª between 1012superscript101210^{12}10 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 12 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT cm‚àí11{}^{-1}start_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT - 1 end_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT and 1013superscript101310^{13}10 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 13 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT cm‚àí11{}^{-1}start_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT - 1 end_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT and gùëîgitalic_g as a multiple of the elementary charge eùëíeitalic_e. Here Yukawa briefly hints to a possible derivation of the range of the interaction between neutron and proton, starting from the calculation of the mass defect of H2superscriptùêª2H^{2}italic_H start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT and the probability of the neutron-proton scattering under the assumption that the relative velocity is small with respect to the speed of light. In this respect, in a footnote he very interestingly mentions similar calculations carried out by Tomonaga:\n\nThese calculations were made previously, according to the theory of Heisenberg, by Mr. Tomonaga, to whom the writer owes much. A little modification is necessary in our case. Detailed accounts will be made in the next paper ([26], p. 52).\n\nFrom archival documents [77, 78, 82, 83] and recollections by Tomonaga [21], the role he played in the early stages of the birth of meson‚Äôs theory, which is hinted at in this footnote, clearly emerges [84]. We will come to this issue in the following Section.\n\nYukawa‚Äôs next step is to determine the nature of the quanta that the general principles of quantum field theory associate to the UùëàUitalic_U-field (which would then play for this field the same role that photons play for the electromagnetic field), by taking into account the fact that they should follow Bose statistics and have a charge equal to +eùëí+e+ italic_e or ‚àíeùëí-e- italic_e. As such, the operator associated to UùëàUitalic_U works by decreasing by one the number of quanta with negative charge, or increasing by one the number of quanta with positive charge, and satisfies the relativistic wave equation:\n\n(px2+py2+pz2‚àíW2c2+Œª2)‚Å¢U=0,superscriptsubscriptùëùùë•2superscriptsubscriptùëùùë¶2superscriptsubscriptùëùùëß2superscriptùëä2superscriptùëê2superscriptùúÜ2ùëà0\\displaystyle\\left(p_{x}^{2}+p_{y}^{2}+p_{z}^{2}-\\frac{W^{2}}{c^{2}}+\\lambda^{% 2}\\right)U=0,( italic_p start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_x end_POSTSUBSCRIPT start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT + italic_p start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_y end_POSTSUBSCRIPT start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT + italic_p start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_z end_POSTSUBSCRIPT start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT - divide start_ARG italic_W start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT end_ARG start_ARG italic_c start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT end_ARG + italic_Œª start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ) italic_U = 0 , (34)\n\nwhich can be obtained from Eq.

The new particle was called heavy quantum while the term meson was coined by Homi Bhabha in 1939 to point out that its mass is intermediate between the electron and the proton masses [90]. A comment is made on the possible observation of this massive particle in nuclear transformations, and Yukawa shows how the energies required for its production are not available in ordinary nuclear reactions. In fact, he shows that with typical nuclear energies, the wave function associated to UùëàUitalic_U-quanta is an evanescent function, leading to a negligible probability of observing a UùëàUitalic_U-quantum outside the nucleus. In his concluding remarks at the end of the paper, he suggests that the predicted massive quanta ‚Äúmay have some bearing on the shower produced by cosmic rays‚Äù ([26], p. 57). Indeed, many particles with such a huge energy could be found within cosmic rays, and a year later, in 1936, a particle compatible with that predicted by Yukawa was actually discovered in cosmic ray showers [91]. This particle was later identified with the muon while the true meson (the pion) would have discovered only in 1947 [92]. In fact, with his work, Yukawa began to go beyond the domain of nuclear physics, paving the way towards the regime of high energy physics. The particle physics era was about to start, as noticed by Brown [28].\n\nThe final part of Yukawa‚Äôs seminal work is devoted to an alternative formulation of Œ≤ùõΩ\\betaitalic_Œ≤-decay theory in which the quanta of the UùëàUitalic_U-field are assumed to interact with a light particle, which jumps from a neutrino state of negative energy to an electron state of positive energy. This process is implemented by making the UùëàUitalic_U-field to interact with an electron Œ®ksubscriptŒ®ùëò\\Psi_{k}roman_Œ® start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_k end_POSTSUBSCRIPT and a neutrino œÜksubscriptùúëùëò\\varphi_{k}italic_œÜ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_k end_POSTSUBSCRIPT field (k=1,2,3,4ùëò1234k=1,2,3,4italic_k = 1 , 2 , 3 , 4), which amounts to add the new source term ‚àí4‚Å¢œÄ‚Å¢g‚Ä≤‚Å¢‚àëk=14Œ®~k‚Å¢œÜk4ùúãsuperscriptùëî‚Ä≤superscriptsubscriptùëò14subscript~Œ®ùëòsubscriptùúëùëò-4\\pi g^{{}^{\\prime}}\\sum_{k=1}^{4}\\tilde{\\Psi}_{k}\\varphi_{k}- 4 italic_œÄ italic_g start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT start_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT ‚Ä≤ end_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ‚àë start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_k = 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 4 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT over~ start_ARG roman_Œ® end_ARG start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_k end_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_œÜ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_k end_POSTSUBSCRIPT to the right hand side of Eq.

A comparison between the matrix element corresponding to the above process and Fermi‚Äôs result shows that there is perfect agreement upon identifying 4‚Å¢œÄ‚Å¢g‚Å¢g‚Ä≤Œª24ùúãùëîsuperscriptùëî‚Ä≤superscriptùúÜ2\\frac{4\\pi gg^{{}^{\\prime}}}{\\lambda^{2}}divide start_ARG 4 italic_œÄ italic_g italic_g start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT start_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT ‚Ä≤ end_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT end_ARG start_ARG italic_Œª start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT end_ARG with Fermi‚Äôs gùëîgitalic_g constant, whose value is 4‚ãÖ10‚àí50‚ãÖ4superscript10504\\cdot 10^{-50}4 ‚ãÖ 10 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT - 50 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT cm33{}^{3}start_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT 3 end_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT erg.

So his final comment is:\n\nThis means that the interaction between the neutrino and the electron is much smaller than that between the neutron and the proton so that the neutrino will be far more penetrating than the neutron and consequently more difficult to observe ([26], p. 56).\n\nFor the first time a clear difference emerges between the weak and the strong nuclear force: a qualifying feature of Yukawa‚Äôs theory is that it provides a double mechanism able to explain the force between neutrons and protons, via the exchange of a meson, which carries energy, momentum and electric charge, as well as nuclear Œ≤ùõΩ\\betaitalic_Œ≤-decay, via the decay with small probability of an electrically negative (positive) meson into an electron-antineutrino (positron-neutrino) pair. Notice, moreover, that this view is very similar to the modern understanding of weak interactions as mediated by intermediate vector bosons.\n\nYukawa‚Äôs work was quite ignored abroad for a few years, given the fact that western scientists were not inclined to accept the idea of a new particle without experimental evidence. This is testified, for instance, by Pauli‚Äôs reluctance to publicly mention his neutrino‚Äôs hypothesis [9, 46, 47] or by Bohr‚Äôs negative attitude towards Yukawa‚Äôs results, clearly expressed during his visit to Japan in the spring of 1937 [29, 71]. To this respect, a comment by Tomonaga is enlightening:\n\nIt seems to me [‚Ä¶] that the reason for this rejection is that although one wall after another was being removed and although there were many new discoveries, there remained the stubborn prejudice that there was a sanctuary inside nuclei, and the physics community was allergic to new particles. I might note that the workplaces of Heisenberg, Fermi and Yukawa, who successively removed the walls of the sanctuary, get farther and farther from Copenhagen where Bohr resided. This might mean that Bohr‚Äôs influence gets weaker as you move farther away ([21], p. 183).\n\nThese circumstances probably concurred to determine the successful endeavor of Yukawa, rather than that of some European physicist, despite the principles of new quantum mechanics had begun to spread in Japan only in 1929, after Nishina‚Äôs return from Europe [28]. Only after the discovery of a new charged particle in cosmic ray showers by Anderson and Neddermeyer [91], whose mass was compatible with meson‚Äôs mass, there appeared the first reference to Yukawa‚Äôs paper outside Japan, in a work by Oppenheimer and Serber [93]. A paper was then submitted by Yukawa [94],where he suggested the identification of his meson with the new particle discovered in cosmic rays. This prompted him to resume his theory and to develop it in a series of papers with various collaborators [88, 95, 96] until 1938, when his idea finally began to find wider acceptance."
