        "text": "2.2 Exchange forces and nuclear physics\n\nLet us now analyze Heisenberg’s important work on nuclear theory. As a previous mandatory step, we shall briefly summarize the state of art of research in nuclear physics in 1932.\n\nChadwick’s discovery of a neutral particle of mass comparable with that of the proton, i.e. the neutron [7, 8], is, without any doubt, one of the most relevant experimental findings of the early 1930s. Indeed, it provided the solution of some puzzling issues concerning the nuclear structure, such as the wrong spin and statistics of several nuclei, for example the N14superscript𝑁14{}^{14}Nstart_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT 14 end_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT italic_N nucleus. This last feature was a direct consequence of the existing model for the nucleus, as built of protons and electrons, which in the case of the N14superscript𝑁14{}^{14}Nstart_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT 14 end_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT italic_N nucleus led to fourteen protons and seven electrons, thus implying that this nucleus should have half-integer spin and obey Fermi-Dirac statistics, at odds with observations of band spectra of the N2+superscriptsubscript𝑁2N_{2}^{+}italic_N start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT + end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT molecule, consistent with spin-1 and Bose statistics for those nuclei (see [9, 21] for a discussion). In order to address this problem, some strange properties had to be hypothesized for nuclear electrons, for instance that they did not contribute to the spin and statistics of the nucleus because their spins and statistics would get somehow suppressed, so their behavior would not follow quantum theory and Dirac’s equation. Other inconsistencies brought by the hypothesis of nuclear electrons were the incorrect value of the magnetic moments of nuclei and the inconsistency of the energies expected for nuclear electrons from the momentum-position uncertainty relation due to their confinement in the nucleus, as well as both the average binding energy for a nuclear particle and the typical kinetic energies of electrons emitted as β𝛽\\betaitalic_β-rays. Related to this, there was the well-known problem of the continuous spectrum of such β𝛽\\betaitalic_β-rays, which seemed to threaten the validity of energy and momentum conservation. All these problems induced some scientists, most notably Niels Bohr, to believe that quantum mechanics, as well as the cherished conservation laws of energy, momentum and angular momentum, did not work at nuclear scales, and that somehow the electrons “lost their individuality” when confined to such a small scale. Bohr’s position is vividly expressed by Tomonaga as follows:\n\nBohr asserted that this difficulty appeared because quantum mechanics did not work in the nucleus, and therefore the law of energy conservation was violated. Bohr said that since an electron with a Compton wavelength of 10−11superscript101110^{-11}10 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT - 11 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT cm was confined in the small nucleus with a 10−13superscript101310^{-13}10 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT - 13 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT cm radius, the individuality of the electron was lost in the nucleus. […] The bottom line is that according to Bohr’s idea, the interior of a nucleus was a sanctuary that could not be penetrated by quantum mechanics ([21], pp. 159-160).\n\nAs we will see now, the “sanctuary” began instead to be penetrated by Heisenberg who brought quantum mechanics into the nucleus. The starting point of Heisenberg’s first paper on nuclear forces [11] is the key assumption that atomic nuclei are built up with protons and neutrons, with no electrons. Besides a relevant simplification of the theory, which now only involves heavy and slow particles and thus can be formulated using ordinary non-relativistic quantum mechanics, the correct statistics of nuclei such as N14superscript𝑁14{}^{14}Nstart_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT 14 end_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT italic_N follows at once from further assuming that the neutron has spin 12⁢ℏ12Planck-constant-over-2-pi\\frac{1}{2}\\hbardivide start_ARG 1 end_ARG start_ARG 2 end_ARG roman_ℏ and satisfies Fermi statistics. But the problem with the β𝛽\\betaitalic_β-decay energy spectra remained. To address this and other issues such as the the interaction of nuclei with γ𝛾\\gammaitalic_γ-rays, in all three papers Heisenberg adopted a kind of “hybrid” approach in which the neutron is sometimes considered as an elementary particle, and sometimes as a composite of an electron and a proton, despite this being obviously in contrast with the assumptions made for spin and statistics. As a matter of fact, Heisenberg was sweeping all the problems of the quantum mechanical description of a proton-electron nucleus inside the neutron:\n\nThe neutron will be taken as an independent fundamental particle which, however, can split, under favorable conditions, into a proton and an electron, violating the law of conservation of energy and momentum ([11], translated in [10], p. 145).\n\nAt this stage, Pauli’s neutrino hypothesis had not yet been recognized by Heisenberg, while β𝛽\\betaitalic_β-decay would have been the subject of a careful analysis at the end of the paper.\n\nThe core of Heisenberg’s work is the consideration that a correct description of the nuclei can be given in terms of quantum mechanics and, in particular, of the interaction between protons and neutrons. The nature of this interaction needs to be established. Two main guidelines were followed: first, the force must be very strong, in order to bind protons and neutrons within a region of the order of 10−13superscript101310^{-13}10 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT - 13 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT cm, i.e., the nuclear radius, as can be inferred also from proton-nuclei scattering experiments, which also pointed at this force being of very short range; second, experiments indicated a saturation property of nuclear forces, namely that the binding energy of the nuclei is proportional to the mass number A𝐴Aitalic_A (i.e. the number of particles inside the nucleus), rather than A2superscript𝐴2A^{2}italic_A start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT as would be the case for a force in which each nucleon interacted with all other nucleons. The conclusion was that the required interaction could not be of electromagnetic origin, and should be analogous to the one responsible of the existence and stability of the H2+superscriptsubscript𝐻2H_{2}^{+}italic_H start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT + end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT-ion within the domain of molecular physics. The proton and the neutron were seen as analogues of a hydrogen nucleus and a hydrogen atom, and the interaction could be seen, as its molecular-theoretic counterpart, as due to the exchange of an electron between the two. Notice that this picture requires the mentioned problematic composite picture of the neutron. In Heisenberg’s words:\n\nIf one brings a neutron and a proton to within a distance comparable to the dimensions of the nucleus, then – in analogy with the H2+superscriptsubscript𝐻2H_{2}^{+}italic_H start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT + end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ion – a change of place [Platzwechsel] of the negative charge will occur with frequency 1h⁢J⁢(r)1ℎ𝐽𝑟\\frac{1}{h}J(r)divide start_ARG 1 end_ARG start_ARG italic_h end_ARG italic_J ( italic_r ). The quantity J⁢(r)𝐽𝑟J(r)italic_J ( italic_r ) corresponds to the Austausch- or more correctly the Platzwechsel-integral of molecular theory. One can illustrate this Platzwechsel again with the picture of electrons that have no spin and obey Bose statistics. But it is probably more correct to regard the exchange integral J⁢(r)𝐽𝑟J(r)italic_J ( italic_r ) as a fundamental property of the proton-neutron pair, without wanting to reduce it to motions of electrons ([11], p. 2; translated in [6], p. 104).\n\nNotice that Heisenberg speaks here about an electron without spin obeying Bose statistics, in this way preserving the fermionic nature and the half-integer spin of the neutron. Within such a picture, the mechanism of the interaction between the neutron and the proton can be viewed as an exchange of an electron between the neutron and the proton: the neutron which loses its electron turns into a proton while the proton, which captures the electron, becomes a neutron. However he will end up by hinting to a different interpretation of the exchange integral J⁢(r)𝐽𝑟J(r)italic_J ( italic_r ), without any reference to moving electrons, but as related to the exchange of the proton and the neutron themselves. As we will see in the following, the introduction of the concept of isospin, which permits considering the proton and the neutron as different states of otherwise identical particles, allowed Heisenberg to implement the idea of exchange between the neutron and the proton without resorting to the picture of a moving Bose electron. Summing up, the above quote shows that Heisenberg considered two different exchange mechanisms at the basis of the interaction that keeps nuclei together, one modeled after the interaction of the constituent atoms of a molecule, the other one modeled instead after the electrons in a many-body system. As we shall see, the second mechanism will underlie the Majorana theory (Section 3), while the first one will be at the basis of the subsequent developments based on the Fermi theory (Section 4) and on the meson theory (Section 6), leading to the current picture of interactions mediated by exchange of virtual particles. An interesting consideration is in order here [5, 6]. According to the standard interpretation of the wave function in quantum mechanics, which by 1932 was already accepted by many physicists, including Heisenberg, the wave functions of electrons in molecules are to be considered as stationary states, hence the mental pictures of electrons that exchange their position or of an electron bouncing back and forth is approximate at best: there is no net motion of charge in an isolated molecule. Nevertheless, in 1932 Heisenberg adopted the picture of the exchange of an electron, and this will lead over the years to the current representation of fundamental interactions.\n\nHeisenberg assumed that exchange interactions, modeled as we just described, act between a neutron and a proton (with the exchange integral denoted by J⁢(r)𝐽𝑟J(r)italic_J ( italic_r ) and assumed to be positive), and that similar interactions acted between a neutron and a neutron (the exchange integral in this case denoted by K⁢(r)𝐾𝑟K(r)italic_K ( italic_r ), with the assumption that J⁢(r)>K⁢(r)𝐽𝑟𝐾𝑟J(r)>K(r)italic_J ( italic_r ) > italic_K ( italic_r )), but not between a proton and a proton, where only the Coulomb repulsion e2rsuperscript𝑒2𝑟\\frac{e^{2}}{r}divide start_ARG italic_e start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT end_ARG start_ARG italic_r end_ARG acts. Denoting with D𝐷Ditalic_D the mass defect of the proton with respect to the neutron, and finally neglecting all relativistic effects (allowed by the large mass of all particles), the complete Hamiltonian for the nucleus proposed by Heisenberg was the following:\n\nH𝐻\\displaystyle Hitalic_H =\\displaystyle== 12⁢M⁢∑k𝐩k2−12⁢∑k>lJ⁢(rk⁢l)⁢(ρkξ⁢ρlξ+ρkη⁢ρlη)−14⁢∑k>lK⁢(rk⁢l)⁢(1+ρkζ)⁢(1+ρlζ)12𝑀subscript𝑘superscriptsubscript𝐩𝑘212subscript𝑘𝑙𝐽subscript𝑟𝑘𝑙superscriptsubscript𝜌𝑘𝜉superscriptsubscript𝜌𝑙𝜉superscriptsubscript𝜌𝑘𝜂superscriptsubscript𝜌𝑙𝜂14subscript𝑘𝑙𝐾subscript𝑟𝑘𝑙1superscriptsubscript𝜌𝑘𝜁1superscriptsubscript𝜌𝑙𝜁\\displaystyle\\frac{1}{2M}\\sum_{k}{\\bf p}_{k}^{2}-\\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{k>l}J(r_{kl}% )(\\rho_{k}^{\\xi}\\rho_{l}^{\\xi}+\\rho_{k}^{\\eta}\\rho_{l}^{\\eta})-\\frac{1}{4}\\sum% _{k>l}K(r_{kl})(1+\\rho_{k}^{\\zeta})(1+\\rho_{l}^{\\zeta})divide start_ARG 1 end_ARG start_ARG 2 italic_M end_ARG ∑ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_k end_POSTSUBSCRIPT bold_p start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_k end_POSTSUBSCRIPT start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT - divide start_ARG 1 end_ARG start_ARG 2 end_ARG ∑ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_k > italic_l end_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_J ( italic_r start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_k italic_l end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ) ( italic_ρ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_k end_POSTSUBSCRIPT start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_ξ end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_ρ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_l end_POSTSUBSCRIPT start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_ξ end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT + italic_ρ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_k end_POSTSUBSCRIPT start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_η end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_ρ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_l end_POSTSUBSCRIPT start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_η end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ) - divide start_ARG 1 end_ARG start_ARG 4 end_ARG ∑ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_k > italic_l end_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_K ( italic_r start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_k italic_l end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ) ( 1 + italic_ρ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_k end_POSTSUBSCRIPT start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_ζ end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ) ( 1 + italic_ρ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_l end_POSTSUBSCRIPT start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_ζ end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ) (1) +14⁢∑k>le2rk⁢l⁢(1−ρkζ)⁢(1−ρlζ)−12⁢D⁢∑k(1+ρkζ),14subscript𝑘𝑙superscript𝑒2subscript𝑟𝑘𝑙1superscriptsubscript𝜌𝑘𝜁1superscriptsubscript𝜌𝑙𝜁12𝐷subscript𝑘1superscriptsubscript𝜌𝑘𝜁\\displaystyle+\\,\\frac{1}{4}\\sum_{k>l}\\frac{e^{2}}{r_{kl}}(1-\\rho_{k}^{\\zeta})(% 1-\\rho_{l}^{\\zeta})-\\frac{1}{2}D\\sum_{k}(1+\\rho_{k}^{\\zeta}),+ divide start_ARG 1 end_ARG start_ARG 4 end_ARG ∑ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_k > italic_l end_POSTSUBSCRIPT divide start_ARG italic_e start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT end_ARG start_ARG italic_r start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_k italic_l end_POSTSUBSCRIPT end_ARG ( 1 - italic_ρ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_k end_POSTSUBSCRIPT start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_ζ end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ) ( 1 - italic_ρ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_l end_POSTSUBSCRIPT start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_ζ end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ) - divide start_ARG 1 end_ARG start_ARG 2 end_ARG italic_D ∑ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_k end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( 1 + italic_ρ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_k end_POSTSUBSCRIPT start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_ζ end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ) ,\n\nwhere M𝑀Mitalic_M is the proton or neutron mass, rk⁢l=|𝐫k−𝐫l|subscript𝑟𝑘𝑙subscript𝐫𝑘subscript𝐫𝑙r_{kl}=\\left|{\\bf r}_{k}-{\\bf r}_{l}\\right|italic_r start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_k italic_l end_POSTSUBSCRIPT = | bold_r start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_k end_POSTSUBSCRIPT - bold_r start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_l end_POSTSUBSCRIPT | are distances of the order of the nuclear dimensions and 𝐩ksubscript𝐩𝑘{\\bf p}_{k}bold_p start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_k end_POSTSUBSCRIPT is the momentum of the k𝑘kitalic_k-th nucleon. This formula involves a fifth quantity for the characterization of each particle in addition to the usual ones (i.e. the three position coordinates and the spin σzsuperscript𝜎𝑧\\sigma^{z}italic_σ start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_z end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT along the z𝑧zitalic_z-axis), namely a charge ρζsuperscript𝜌𝜁\\rho^{\\zeta}italic_ρ start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_ζ end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT, whose values are ρζ=+1superscript𝜌𝜁1\\rho^{\\zeta}=+1italic_ρ start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_ζ end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT = + 1 for a neutron and ρζ=−1superscript𝜌𝜁1\\rho^{\\zeta}=-1italic_ρ start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_ζ end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT = - 1 for a proton respectively.

(8)\n\nThe fifth quantity ρζsuperscript𝜌𝜁\\rho^{\\zeta}italic_ρ start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_ζ end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT allowed Heisenberg to interpret the neutron and the proton as the two different states of a “nucleon\", so that the Hamiltonian (1) contains transition elements which change ρζ=+1superscript𝜌𝜁1\\rho^{\\zeta}=+1italic_ρ start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_ζ end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT = + 1 into ρζ=−1superscript𝜌𝜁1\\rho^{\\zeta}=-1italic_ρ start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_ζ end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT = - 1, i.e. they transfer a charge between the neutron and the proton. Later, ρζsuperscript𝜌𝜁\\rho^{\\zeta}italic_ρ start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_ζ end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT would have been dubbed isotopic spin by Eugene P. Wigner [48].\n\nThen Heisenberg switched to the discussion of the behavior of a nucleus made of n𝑛nitalic_n particles, with n1subscript𝑛1n_{1}italic_n start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT neutrons and n2subscript𝑛2n_{2}italic_n start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT protons, starting from Eq. (1) and retaining only the first two terms, which are symmetrical with respect to protons and neutrons. In this situation the minimum energy corresponds to a nucleus with n1=n2subscript𝑛1subscript𝑛2n_{1}=n_{2}italic_n start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT = italic_n start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT, in agreement with experimental results. By including the last three terms, the minimum energy changes, and corresponds to a different situation in which the ratio between n1subscript𝑛1n_{1}italic_n start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT and n2subscript𝑛2n_{2}italic_n start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT is higher than one. However, as Heisenberg noticed, the application to concrete cases needs a careful discussion of nuclear stability. The solution is immediate only for the simplest case of hydrogen isotope of weight two, which is made of one proton and one neutron. The resulting eigenfunction in the lowest energy state is symmetric in the spatial and charge coordinates of the two particles, as a consequence of their spin. This conclusion is a consequence of the positive sign that Heisenberg assumed for J⁢(r)𝐽𝑟J(r)italic_J ( italic_r ), and is in fact contradicted by experiments, as we shall discuss later.\n\nHeisenberg carried out only a qualitative discussion of the general case, starting from the analysis of nuclei containing neutrons only. On the basis of Eq. (1), a nucleus with two neutrons is expected to be stable, as well as the H⁢e𝐻𝑒Heitalic_H italic_e nucleus which is made of two protons and two neutrons. Then, he addressed the issue of the stability of the nucleus, taken as a structure containing both neutrons and protons, with the number of neutrons slightly higher than that of protons. He focused on intermediate as well as heavy nuclei, and his primary concern was to find the conditions for stability (against β𝛽\\betaitalic_β- as well as α𝛼\\alphaitalic_α-decay) and characterize the decay following instability. In particular he carried out a qualitative study of the binding energy of the nuclei as a function of n1subscript𝑛1n_{1}italic_n start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT and n2subscript𝑛2n_{2}italic_n start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT. These topics were deepened in the second paper [12], where the energy differences between nuclei with even n1subscript𝑛1n_{1}italic_n start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT and n2subscript𝑛2n_{2}italic_n start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT, odd n1subscript𝑛1n_{1}italic_n start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT and n2subscript𝑛2n_{2}italic_n start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT, odd n1subscript𝑛1n_{1}italic_n start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT or n2subscript𝑛2n_{2}italic_n start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT, were studied.\n\nIn Ref. [12], Heisenberg addressed two further issues, the scattering of γ𝛾\\gammaitalic_γ-rays by atomic nuclei and the properties of the neutron, which will be the topic of the third paper of the series, published in 1933 [13]. With respect to the scattering of γ𝛾\\gammaitalic_γ-rays, Heisenberg’s explanation made crucial use of the assumption of the neutron as a bound state of a proton and an electron. The composite structure of the neutron implies that not only the motion of the protons and neutrons changes due to the effect of the external radiation, but also that the nuclear electrons inside neutrons get excited. Though wrong, these hypotheses lead him to a satisfactory explanation of the anomalous scattering of γ𝛾\\gammaitalic_γ-rays on nuclei (known as the Meitner-Hüpfeld effect [49, 50, 51]). The second mechanism is more effective thanks to the small mass of the electron and gives a significant contribution to the total scattering, which could be in agreement with experimental data. Concerning the properties of the neutron, Heisenberg made a comparison between the two hypotheses on the nature of this particle (elementary particle without structure versus composite system of a proton and an electron). While the second hypothesis seemed to work well both in the case of β𝛽\\betaitalic_β-decay and in explaining the nature of exchange interaction within the nuclei, it brought about several conceptual difficulties, which led him again to question the validity of quantum mechanics at the nuclear scale. In particular, the uncertainty principle gives for the mass defect of the neutron an energy of the order of 137⁢m⁢c2137𝑚superscript𝑐2137\\ mc^{2}137 italic_m italic_c start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT, while the observed mass defect is about a hundred times smaller and has the opposite sign. Furthermore, quite different values of the binding energy of the nuclear electron are obtained depending on the experiments devised to measure it.\n\nHeisenberg’s third paper on nuclear forces [13] further extends the ideas introduced in the previous papers [11, 12] starting from a generalized Hamiltonian, obtained by augmenting Eq. (1) with the term +12⁢∑k>lL⁢(rk⁢l)⁢(1−ρkζ⁢ρlζ)12subscript𝑘𝑙𝐿subscript𝑟𝑘𝑙1superscriptsubscript𝜌𝑘𝜁superscriptsubscript𝜌𝑙𝜁+\\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{k>l}L(r_{kl})(1-\\rho_{k}^{\\zeta}\\rho_{l}^{\\zeta})+ divide start_ARG 1 end_ARG start_ARG 2 end_ARG ∑ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_k > italic_l end_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_L ( italic_r start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_k italic_l end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ) ( 1 - italic_ρ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_k end_POSTSUBSCRIPT start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_ζ end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_ρ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_l end_POSTSUBSCRIPT start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_ζ end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ), which adds ordinary static interactions between protons and neutrons to the exchange forces. Then, an approximate solution was found by applying the Thomas-Fermi method to the case of many-particle nuclei. In this method, the nucleus is modeled as a gas of free particles which obey Fermi statistics, bound together by forces whose potential energy is:\n\nU⁢(r)=−2⁢n1⁢n2n⁢(n−1)⁢[J⁢(r)−L⁢(r)]−n1⁢(n1−1)n⁢(n−1)⁢K⁢(r)+n2⁢(n2−1)n⁢(n+1)⁢e2r,𝑈𝑟2subscript𝑛1subscript𝑛2𝑛𝑛1delimited-[]𝐽𝑟𝐿𝑟subscript𝑛1subscript𝑛11𝑛𝑛1𝐾𝑟subscript𝑛2subscript𝑛21𝑛𝑛1superscript𝑒2𝑟\\displaystyle U(r)=-2\\frac{n_{1}n_{2}}{n(n-1)}\\left[J(r)-L(r)\\right]-\\frac{n_{% 1}(n_{1}-1)}{n(n-1)}K(r)+\\frac{n_{2}(n_{2}-1)}{n(n+1)}\\frac{e^{2}}{r},italic_U ( italic_r ) = - 2 divide start_ARG italic_n start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_n start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT end_ARG start_ARG italic_n ( italic_n - 1 ) end_ARG [ italic_J ( italic_r ) - italic_L ( italic_r ) ] - divide start_ARG italic_n start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( italic_n start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT - 1 ) end_ARG start_ARG italic_n ( italic_n - 1 ) end_ARG italic_K ( italic_r ) + divide start_ARG italic_n start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( italic_n start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT - 1 ) end_ARG start_ARG italic_n ( italic_n + 1 ) end_ARG divide start_ARG italic_e start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT end_ARG start_ARG italic_r end_ARG , (9)\n\nwhile the total energy in the lowest state is:\n\nE=h2M⁢4⁢π5⁢(38⁢π)53⁢∫ρ⁢(𝐫)53⁢𝑑τ+12⁢∫∫ρ⁢(𝐫)⁢ρ⁢(𝐫′)⁢U⁢(|𝐫−𝐫′|)⁢𝑑τ⁢𝑑τ′−n1⁢D.𝐸superscriptℎ2𝑀4𝜋5superscript38𝜋53𝜌superscript𝐫53differential-d𝜏12𝜌𝐫𝜌superscript𝐫′𝑈𝐫superscript𝐫′differential-d𝜏differential-dsuperscript𝜏′subscript𝑛1𝐷\\displaystyle E=\\frac{h^{2}}{M}\\frac{4\\pi}{5}\\left(\\frac{3}{8\\pi}\\right)^{% \\frac{5}{3}}\\int\\!\\!\\rho({\\bf r})^{\\frac{5}{3}}d\\tau+\\frac{1}{2}\\int\\!\\!\\!\\!% \\int\\!\\!\\rho({\\bf r})\\rho({\\bf r}^{{}^{\\prime}})U(|{\\bf r}-{\\bf r}^{{}^{\\prime% }}|)d\\tau d\\tau^{{}^{\\prime}}-n_{1}D.italic_E = divide start_ARG italic_h start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT end_ARG start_ARG italic_M end_ARG divide start_ARG 4 italic_π end_ARG start_ARG 5 end_ARG ( divide start_ARG 3 end_ARG start_ARG 8 italic_π end_ARG ) start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT divide start_ARG 5 end_ARG start_ARG 3 end_ARG end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ∫ italic_ρ ( bold_r ) start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT divide start_ARG 5 end_ARG start_ARG 3 end_ARG end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_d italic_τ + divide start_ARG 1 end_ARG start_ARG 2 end_ARG ∫ ∫ italic_ρ ( bold_r ) italic_ρ ( bold_r start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT start_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT ′ end_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ) italic_U ( | bold_r - bold_r start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT start_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT ′ end_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT | ) italic_d italic_τ italic_d italic_τ start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT start_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT ′ end_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT - italic_n start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_D .

Technically, Heisenberg obtained the result by putting U⁢(|𝐫−𝐫′|)𝑈𝐫superscript𝐫′U(|{\\bf r}-{\\bf r}^{{}^{\\prime}}|)italic_U ( | bold_r - bold_r start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT start_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT ′ end_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT | ) equal to zero for values of |𝐫−𝐫′|𝐫superscript𝐫′|{\\bf r}-{\\bf r}^{{}^{\\prime}}|| bold_r - bold_r start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT start_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT ′ end_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT | smaller than the minimum separation between two particles.\n\nSumming up, it is clear that despite being a milestone in the quantum theory of nuclear structure, Heisenberg’s work on nuclear forces suffers from a number of drawbacks. The analysis of these drawbacks was the starting point of Majorana’s work.\n\n6.2 Preliminary work on nuclear forces\n\nA turning point in Yukawa’s scientific career came in 1932, as he recalled in his autobiography [20] when talking about the scientific events of that year:\n\nThe year 1932 was even more turbulent for physics than it was for my personal life. Events, each of which, taken alone, could be called revolutionary, occurred three in a row: first, there was the discovery of the neutron; second, the discovery of the positron; third, the atomic nucleus was broken up by artificial means, namely by the use of the particle accelerators. The discipline that is now called nuclear physics was until then a minor branch of study, but because of those three events, it suddenly became the mainstream ([20], pp. 310-311).\n\nAccording to Yukawa, the discovery of neutron was a very significant event for theoretical physics, because it brought into play the idea that the nucleus is built of protons and neutrons. Heisenberg’s papers on nuclear structure [11, 12, 13] deeply impressed the young Yukawa, who wrote an introduction to the Japanese translation of these papers to be published in the Proceedings of the Physico-Mathematical Society of Japan [20, 28]. This event marked the beginning of his struggle towards the building of his new theory of nuclear forces. In Yukawa’s own words:\n\nThe problem that I focused on was that the nature of the forces that act upon the neutrons and protons making up the nucleus – that is, the nature of the nuclear forces. By confronting this difficult problem, I committed myself to long days of suffering. […] The fact that I was suffering, however, was very satisfying to me; I felt like a traveler carrying a heavy burden and struggling up a slope ([20], p. 312).\n\nHis starting point was the consideration that, after the introduction of quantum mechanics, the only primary (or fundamental) forces in nature were identified with gravity and electromagnetism. As a main and common feature, both forces were expressed in terms of fields. Thus, an answer had to be provided to the question whether nuclear forces were additional primary ones or not. In principle, in fact, the weakness of both gravity and electromagnetic force prevents them to be the source of nuclear force. Furthermore, electromagnetism could not account for the attraction of protons within the nucleus as well as for the interactions of neutrons, which are electrically neutral. Thus the consideration that strange things happen when thinking to the nuclear force as a secondary one, to be derived from electromagnetism, led Yukawa to view nuclear forces as new fundamental ones and, as such, described by means of a suitable field. Quantum mechanics then played a crucial role, as recalled by Yukawa in his autobiography, in driving him to conceive the idea of meson. But, despite having conceived the general idea early on, the actual implementation of his program would turn out to be very hard, and lasted two years:\n\nI had this idea of a nuclear force field very early. Looked at from the quantum mechanical viewpoint, a field of force, almost by necessity, implies that there is a particle accompanying that field. […] I had to take a wrong path first, before I could arrive at my destination. […] In retrospect, I was very close to my destination in 1932. Had I pursued the notion of the field of nuclear force, and applied quantum mechanical reasoning, I should have been able to come up with the idea of the meson. Instead, I spent the next two years searching in the dark ([20], pp. 320-321).\n\nYukawa started his investigations by following Heisenberg’s idea of the nuclear force as an exchange of an electron between protons and neutrons [11] and presented some preliminary results at the meeting of the Physico-Mathematical Society of Japan held in April 1933 at the Tōhoku University in Sendai. He gave a talk entitled “A Comment on the Problem of Electrons in the Nucleus”, but he did not publish the corresponding manuscript in a journal. This and his subsequent work in 1933-34, most of which is unpublished, were an important preliminary step towards the research he would have carried out in the following years, and as such are of great historical interest in order to reconstruct his path to meson theory. In Sendai, Yukawa also met Yagi Hidetsugu, head of the Physics Department of Ōsaka University, and this circumstance led him to move to Ōsaka to join the nuclear research group, which had a Cockroft-Walton accelerator. He recalled that “it was very stimulating to know that experiments would take place simultaneously with the theoretical studies” ([20], p. 326).\n\nThe 1933 talk contains Yukawa’s first idea of an exchange force due to an electron shuttling between the neutron and the proton, along with a careful analysis of the many difficulties he met. In the abstract we can find his program:\n\nWe can consider that, by analogy with radiation (in the same sense that the radiation is the mediator of interactions between electrons, protons and other charged particles), the electron is the mediator of the interaction between proton and neutron and acts like a kind of field in the inside of nuclei. Then, we may solve the […] equation for the electron to find the form of interaction between neutron and proton. From the fact that the electron has the finite rest mass, we may expect that the interaction energy would decrease rapidly as the distance between neutron and proton becomes large in comparison with h/(2⁢π⁢m⁢c)ℎ2𝜋𝑚𝑐h/(2\\pi mc)italic_h / ( 2 italic_π italic_m italic_c ).\n\nA critical analysis of Heisenberg’s papers on nuclear forces [11, 12, 13] led Yukawa to exclude the picture of the neutron as a bound state made of a proton and an electron, because of the incompatibility with quantum mechanics. In fact, he noticed that the uncertainty relation would give a value E=137⁢m⁢c2𝐸137𝑚superscript𝑐2E=137\\ mc^{2}italic_E = 137 italic_m italic_c start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT for the neutron mass defect, which differs by a factor 102superscript10210^{2}10 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT from the correct value m⁢c2𝑚superscript𝑐2mc^{2}italic_m italic_c start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT (such a discrepancy had been noticed also by Heisenberg [12]). Likewise, the analysis of the anomalous dispersion of γ𝛾\\gammaitalic_γ-rays as due mainly to neutrons gives the value 42.6⁢m⁢c242.6𝑚superscript𝑐242.6\\ mc^{2}42.6 italic_m italic_c start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT for the eigenfrequency of neutron, which is again very different from that obtained with the correct mass defect and, moreover, different from the previous one. Thus Yukawa made the assumption that the neutron is an elementary particle, and reinterpreted Heisenberg’s exchange interaction between the proton and the neutron, as well as that between two neutrons, as due to a mediator, the electron, whose role would be analog to that played by radiation in the electromagnetic interaction. Following these guidelines he expected to derive the form of the interaction between proton and neutron and to explain β𝛽\\betaitalic_β-decay. In fact, after the recognition that the mediator of the interaction could not be the electron but a new, much heavier bosonic particle, he basically followed the same steps outlined in his 1933 talk (as we shall see below). Before trying to implement his program, Yukawa dwelled on some interesting considerations concerning the mathematical expression of the exchange interaction J⁢(r)𝐽𝑟J(r)italic_J ( italic_r ). These are very interesting in view of understanding how Yukawa arrived at the form J⁢(r)=−g2⁢e−λ⁢rr𝐽𝑟superscript𝑔2superscript𝑒𝜆𝑟𝑟J(r)=-g^{2}\\frac{e^{-\\lambda r}}{r}italic_J ( italic_r ) = - italic_g start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT divide start_ARG italic_e start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT - italic_λ italic_r end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT end_ARG start_ARG italic_r end_ARG, which would later be the basis of his meson theory. He suggested that this form could be obtained by a phenomenological approach:\n\nTo solve this problem, the most effective method at present might be to calculate the scattering of neutrons on nuclei by assuming a suitable interaction between neutrons and nuclei, and comparing the results with experiment ([79], p. 251).\n\nIn particular he hinted to a force decreasing rapidly with the distance and made reference to a paper by Harrie S. W. Massey [80], where elastic collisions of neutrons with material particles were considered. In this paper the neutron was modeled as an atom with an electron moving in a field of very high effective nuclear charge Z𝑍Zitalic_Z (to account for its smallness with respect to a hydrogen atom), given by\n\nV⁢(r)=e2⁢(1r+Za0)⁢e−2⁢Z⁢ra0,𝑉𝑟superscript𝑒21𝑟𝑍subscript𝑎0superscript𝑒2𝑍𝑟subscript𝑎0\\displaystyle V(r)=e^{2}\\left(\\frac{1}{r}+\\frac{Z}{a_{0}}\\right)e^{-\\frac{2Zr}% {a_{0}}},italic_V ( italic_r ) = italic_e start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ( divide start_ARG 1 end_ARG start_ARG italic_r end_ARG + divide start_ARG italic_Z end_ARG start_ARG italic_a start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 0 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT end_ARG ) italic_e start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT - divide start_ARG 2 italic_Z italic_r end_ARG start_ARG italic_a start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 0 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT end_ARG end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT , (24)\n\na0subscript𝑎0a_{0}italic_a start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 0 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT being the Bohr radius and a0/Zsubscript𝑎0𝑍{a_{0}}/{Z}italic_a start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 0 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT / italic_Z the radius of the neutron. This expression shows a similar behavior if compared with Yukawa’s interaction. Calculations on collisions of neutrons with matter were also carried out in the same years by Nishina, Tomonaga and collaborators, who worked also on the neutron-proton interaction by using various expressions for the potential J⁢(r)𝐽𝑟J(r)italic_J ( italic_r ), including A⁢e−μ⁢rr𝐴superscript𝑒𝜇𝑟𝑟A\\frac{e^{-\\mu r}}{r}italic_A divide start_ARG italic_e start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT - italic_μ italic_r end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT end_ARG start_ARG italic_r end_ARG [21, 30]. Furthermore the topic was the subject of a talk given by Tomonaga, again at the meeting of the Physico-Mathematical Society of Japan of April 1933 in Sendai, and of a subsequent interplay between Tomonaga and Yukawa [82, 83, 84]. We will deal in detail with Tomonaga’s contribution in the next Section. One can infer that in 1933 both Yukawa and Tomonaga had an idea of the interaction A⁢e−μ⁢rr𝐴superscript𝑒𝜇𝑟𝑟A\\frac{e^{-\\mu r}}{r}italic_A divide start_ARG italic_e start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT - italic_μ italic_r end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT end_ARG start_ARG italic_r end_ARG, but the deep meaning of this formula, and in particular the implications for the range and the mass of the virtual mediating particle, were still unknown.\n\nAfter these considerations, Yukawa went back to his theoretical program, describing it as follows:\n\nA neutron can emit an electron and change to a proton, and a proton can absorb an electron and change to a neutron. This fact is itself the cause of the interaction between proton and neutron; in other words, neutron and proton create the electron field, i.e., the field of the electron wave, and are affected by it ([79], pp. 251-252).\n\nIn such a situation the total number of electrons changes with time, so that the electron has to obey to a Dirac equation which contains a source term involving neutrons and protons. Likewise protons and neutrons obey a similar Dirac equation with a source term involving both neutron, proton and electron. These equations are as follows (Yukawa also included an electromagnetic vector potential, but he subsequently set it to zero, hence we do not include it here):\n\n1c⁢L11𝑐subscript𝐿1\\displaystyle\\frac{1}{c}L_{1}divide start_ARG 1 end_ARG start_ARG italic_c end_ARG italic_L start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT =\\displaystyle== {Wc+ρ1⁢σ⋅𝐩+ρ3⁢m⁢c}⁢ψ=χ†⁢γ⁢χ,𝑊𝑐⋅subscript𝜌1𝜎𝐩subscript𝜌3𝑚𝑐𝜓superscript𝜒†𝛾𝜒\\displaystyle\\left\\{\\frac{W}{c}+\\rho_{1}\\mathbf{\\sigma}\\cdot\\mathbf{p}+\\rho_{3% }mc\\right\\}\\psi=\\chi^{\\dagger}\\gamma\\chi\\,,{ divide start_ARG italic_W end_ARG start_ARG italic_c end_ARG + italic_ρ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_σ ⋅ bold_p + italic_ρ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 3 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_m italic_c } italic_ψ = italic_χ start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT † end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_γ italic_χ , (25) 1c⁢L21𝑐subscript𝐿2\\displaystyle\\frac{1}{c}L_{2}divide start_ARG 1 end_ARG start_ARG italic_c end_ARG italic_L start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT =\\displaystyle== {Wc+ρ1′⁢σ⋅𝐩+ρ3⁢(1+τ32⁢M⁢c+1−τ32⁢M′⁢c)}⁢χ=(γ⁢ψ†+γ†⁢ψ)⁢χ,𝑊𝑐⋅subscriptsuperscript𝜌′1𝜎𝐩subscript𝜌31subscript𝜏32𝑀𝑐1subscript𝜏32superscript𝑀′𝑐𝜒𝛾superscript𝜓†superscript𝛾†𝜓𝜒\\displaystyle\\left\\{\\frac{W}{c}+\\rho^{\\prime}_{1}\\mathbf{\\sigma}\\cdot\\mathbf{p% }+\\rho_{3}\\left(\\frac{1+\\tau_{3}}{2}Mc+\\frac{1-\\tau_{3}}{2}M^{\\prime}c\\right)% \\right\\}\\chi=\\left(\\gamma\\psi^{\\dagger}+\\gamma^{\\dagger}\\psi\\right)\\chi\\,,{ divide start_ARG italic_W end_ARG start_ARG italic_c end_ARG + italic_ρ start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ′ end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_σ ⋅ bold_p + italic_ρ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 3 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( divide start_ARG 1 + italic_τ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 3 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT end_ARG start_ARG 2 end_ARG italic_M italic_c + divide start_ARG 1 - italic_τ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 3 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT end_ARG start_ARG 2 end_ARG italic_M start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ′ end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_c ) } italic_χ = ( italic_γ italic_ψ start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT † end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT + italic_γ start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT † end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_ψ ) italic_χ , (26)\n\nwhere ψ𝜓\\psiitalic_ψ is the wave function of the electron, χ𝜒\\chiitalic_χ is the wave function of the proton and of the neutron, L1subscript𝐿1L_{1}italic_L start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT and L2subscript𝐿2L_{2}italic_L start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT are the Dirac operators for electron and neutron-proton respectively, τisubscript𝜏𝑖\\tau_{i}italic_τ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT (i=1,2,3𝑖123i=1,2,3italic_i = 1 , 2 , 3) are the isotopic spin matrices and γ𝛾\\gammaitalic_γ, γ†superscript𝛾†\\gamma^{\\dagger}italic_γ start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT † end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT are two unknown 4×4444\\times 44 × 4 matrices to be determined in order to find the form of the interaction between electrons, protons and neutrons.

From these, he derived the Heisenberg equations of motion for the nuclear field operators, which were in perfect agreement with the previous ones (26), while for the electron field operators the result was different from Eq. (25). He noticed that, if Bose statistics (i.e., commutation relations) is assumed instead for the electron, the results were in agreement with previous equations of motion. At this point, Yukawa assumed the validity of equations (25) and (26) and switched to the task of finding the specific form of the proton-neutron interaction from them. He looked for a particular solution of the electron wave equation satisfying the condition ψ=0𝜓0\\psi=0italic_ψ = 0 for χ=0𝜒0\\chi=0italic_χ = 0, obtaining:\n\nψ0=(p0c−ρ1⁢σ⋅𝐩−ρ3⁢m⁢c)⁢14⁢π⁢ℏ2⁢\\bigints⁢\\bigints⁢\\bigints⁢χ†⁢γ⁢eiℏ⁢ρ3⁢m⁢c⁢|𝐫′−𝐫|⁢χ⁢(𝐫′,t−|𝐫′−𝐫|c)|𝐫′−𝐫|⁢d⁢v′+….subscript𝜓0subscript𝑝0𝑐⋅subscript𝜌1𝜎𝐩subscript𝜌3𝑚𝑐14𝜋superscriptPlanck-constant-over-2-pi2\\bigints\\bigints\\bigintssuperscript𝜒†𝛾superscript𝑒𝑖Planck-constant-over-2-pisubscript𝜌3𝑚𝑐superscript𝐫′𝐫𝜒superscript𝐫′𝑡superscript𝐫′𝐫𝑐superscript𝐫′𝐫𝑑superscript𝑣′…\\displaystyle\\psi_{0}=\\left(\\frac{p_{0}}{c}-\\rho_{1}\\mathbf{\\sigma}\\cdot% \\mathbf{p}-\\rho_{3}mc\\right)\\!\\frac{1}{4\\pi\\hbar^{2}}\\!\\!\\!\\!\\bigints\\!\\!\\!\\!% \\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\bigints\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\bigints\\!\\!\\!\\!\\frac{\\chi^{\\dagger}% \\gamma e^{\\frac{i}{\\hbar}\\rho_{3}mc\\left|{\\bf r}^{{}^{\\prime}}-{\\bf r}\\right|}% \\chi\\!\\left({\\bf r}^{{}^{\\prime}},t-\\frac{\\left|{\\bf r}^{{}^{\\prime}}-{\\bf r}% \\right|}{c}\\right)}{\\left|{\\bf r}^{{}^{\\prime}}-{\\bf r}\\right|}dv^{{}^{\\prime}% }\\!+\\!...\\,.italic_ψ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 0 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT = ( divide start_ARG italic_p start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 0 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT end_ARG start_ARG italic_c end_ARG - italic_ρ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_σ ⋅ bold_p - italic_ρ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 3 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_m italic_c ) divide start_ARG 1 end_ARG start_ARG 4 italic_π roman_ℏ start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT end_ARG divide start_ARG italic_χ start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT † end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_γ italic_e start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT divide start_ARG italic_i end_ARG start_ARG roman_ℏ end_ARG italic_ρ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 3 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_m italic_c | bold_r start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT start_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT ′ end_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT - bold_r | end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_χ ( bold_r start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT start_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT ′ end_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT , italic_t - divide start_ARG | bold_r start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT start_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT ′ end_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT - bold_r | end_ARG start_ARG italic_c end_ARG ) end_ARG start_ARG | bold_r start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT start_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT ′ end_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT - bold_r | end_ARG italic_d italic_v start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT start_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT ′ end_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT + … . (28)\n\nThen, upon substituting this solution into the Hamiltonian, he finally obtained the interaction energy, which however had a Coulomb form, not the expected behavior. He concluded that a well behaved result could be obtained by taking into account the Fermi statistics for the electron, but the calculations appeared to be too hard to deal with. This failure was acknowledged in the talk, where Yukawa admitted that\n\nIn any case, the practical calculation does not yield the looked-for result that the interaction term decreases rapidly as the distance becomes larger than h/(2⁢π⁢m⁢c),ℎ2𝜋𝑚𝑐h/(2\\pi mc),italic_h / ( 2 italic_π italic_m italic_c ) , unlike what I wrote in the abstract of this talk ([79], p.249).\n\nIn Yukawa’s opinion, the failure had its roots in the incompleteness of relativistic quantum mechanics, which led him to study quantum field theoretical issues and, in particular, foundational problems in the following year. Indeed, the 1933 talk begins right away with the words:\n\nThe problems of atomic nuclei, especially the problem of electrons in the nucleus, might not be solved until we reflect on the foundation of quantum mechanics and complete the correct relativistic quantum theory. It cannot be solved only by partial and formal modification of the theory ([79], p. 248).\n\nAccordingly, in April 1934, again at the annual meeting of the Physico-Mathematical Society of Japan, he gave the talk “On the Probability Amplitude in Relativistic Quantum Mechanics”, focusing on topics related to the foundations of quantum field theory, where an early attempt at a better foundation for relativistic quantum mechanics was reported. In this talk he introduced for the first time his idea of the maru, which literally means “circle”, but in fact denotes a closed surface within the four dimensional space-time on which fields should be quantized. This work was a precursor of the non-local field theory he would have developed in 1950s, while it later inspired Tomonaga in developing his super-many-time theory [86], which formed the basis of his Nobel prize winning approach to covariant QED. Yukawa strongly believed that a solution of the internal inconsistency problem in relativistic quantum field theory would provide useful insights for the construction of an unifying picture of elementary particles.\n\n6.3 Yukawa’s theory of nuclear forces and the meson\n\nThere were no novelties in Yukawa’s research on nuclear forces until late spring 1934, when Yukawa read Fermi’s paper on β𝛽\\betaitalic_β-decay and became aware of Pauli’s neutrino hypothesis. Then he independently tried to construct a model of nuclear force based on the exchange of the pair electron-neutrino but, as Heisenberg and other physicists before him, he found that the resulting force was too small to be a viable candidate. So he changed his strategy. Instead of trying to get the nuclear forces from the existing theory, he started focusing on the characteristics of the nuclear force field which were inferred from experiment. He postulated the existence of a brand-new field which would be in the same relation to nuclear forces as the electromagnetic field is to electrostatic forces, and was tailored to meet the phenomenological requirements. His struggle ended in October, when the fog disappeared and the truth arose:\n\nThe nuclear force is effective at extremely small distances, on the order of 0.02 trillionth of a centimeter. That much I knew already. My new insight was the realization that this distance and the mass of the new particle that I was seeking are inversely related to each other. Why had I not noticed that before? The next morning, I tackled the problem of the mass of the new particle and found it to be about two hundred times that of the electron. It also had to have the charge of plus or minus that of the electron. Such a particle had not, of course, been found, so I asked myself, “Why not?” The answer was simple: an energy of 100 million electron volts would be needed to create such a particle, and there was no accelerator, at that time, with that much energy available ([20], p. 324).\n\nThe work was presented in November 1934 to the meeting of the Tōkyō Center of the Physico-Mathematical Society of Japan and met the interest of Nishina. The corresponding paper, Yukawa’s famous meson paper, was written and submitted for publication by the end of the same month.\n\nBefore addressing Yukawa’s work, it is very useful to quote a passage of his first publication, i.e. the introduction to the Japanese translation of the 1932 Heisenberg’s papers on nuclear structure, written in 1933 [28]:\n\nThough Heisenberg does not present a definite view on whether neutrons should be seen as separate entities or as combinations of a proton and an electron, this problem, like the β𝛽\\betaitalic_β decay problem stated above, cannot be resolved with today’s theory. And unless these problems are resolved, one cannot say whether the view that electrons have no independent existence in the nucleus is correct ([28], p. 122).\n\nAs testified by his words, the starting point of his investigation is a deep analysis of Heisenberg’s picture of neutrons and of unsolved problems, like β𝛽\\betaitalic_β decay. Indeed Fermi’s theory would have been published a year later, in 1934, and would have been taken as a reference in his 1935 seminal work [26], together with the Platzwechsel interaction postulated by Heisenberg and the conclusions by Tamm [67] and Iwanenko [68], which led to rule out a neutron-proton interaction mediated by an exchange of an electron-neutrino pair. Then he clearly outlines his strategy and the ultimate goal of his work:\n\nTo remove this defect, it seems natural to modify the theory of Heisenberg and Fermi in the following way. The transition of a heavy particle from neutron state to proton state is not always accompanied by the emission of light particles, i.e., a neutrino and an electron, but the energy liberated by the transition is taken up sometimes by another heavy particle, which in turn will be transformed from proton state into neutron state. If the probability of occurrence of the latter process is much larger than that of the former, the interaction between the neutron and the proton will be much larger than in the case of Fermi, whereas the probability of emission of light particles is not affected essentially. Now such interaction between the elementary particles can be described by means of a field of force, just as the interaction between the charged particles is described by the electromagnetic field. The above considerations show that the interaction of heavy particles with this field is much larger than that of light particles with it ([26], p. 48).\n\nAlso here the analogy with the electromagnetic case is pursued, so that Yukawa’s purpose is to look for this new field, to define its quantum and to investigate the corresponding properties. As a starting point, he adopts a semiclassical approach. The required scalar field U⁢(x,y,z,t)𝑈𝑥𝑦𝑧𝑡U(x,y,z,t)italic_U ( italic_x , italic_y , italic_z , italic_t ) has to decrease rapidly with the distance, so its behavior is assumed to be described by the following function:\n\n±g2⁢e−λ⁢rr,plus-or-minussuperscript𝑔2superscript𝑒𝜆𝑟𝑟\\displaystyle\\pm g^{2}\\,\\frac{e^{-\\lambda r}}{r},± italic_g start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT divide start_ARG italic_e start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT - italic_λ italic_r end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT end_ARG start_ARG italic_r end_ARG , (29)\n\nwhich is the static, spherically symmetric solution of the Klein-Gordon equation in vacuum:\n\n(Δ−1c2⁢∂2∂t2−λ2)⁢U=0.Δ1superscript𝑐2superscript2superscript𝑡2superscript𝜆2𝑈0\\displaystyle\\left(\\Delta-\\frac{1}{c^{2}}\\frac{\\partial^{2}}{\\partial t^{2}}-% \\lambda^{2}\\right)U=0.( roman_Δ - divide start_ARG 1 end_ARG start_ARG italic_c start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT end_ARG divide start_ARG ∂ start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT end_ARG start_ARG ∂ italic_t start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT end_ARG - italic_λ start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ) italic_U = 0 .

This new situation is implemented by adding a source term to Eq. (30), so that the U𝑈Uitalic_U-field satisfies the new equation:\n\n(Δ−1c2⁢∂2∂t2−λ2)⁢U=−4⁢π⁢g⁢ψ~⁢(ρξ−i⁢ρη2)⁢ψ,Δ1superscript𝑐2superscript2superscript𝑡2superscript𝜆2𝑈4𝜋𝑔~𝜓superscript𝜌𝜉𝑖superscript𝜌𝜂2𝜓\\displaystyle\\left(\\Delta-\\frac{1}{c^{2}}\\frac{\\partial^{2}}{\\partial t^{2}}-% \\lambda^{2}\\right)U=-4\\pi g\\,\\tilde{\\psi}\\left(\\frac{\\rho^{\\xi}-i\\rho^{\\eta}}{% 2}\\right)\\psi,( roman_Δ - divide start_ARG 1 end_ARG start_ARG italic_c start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT end_ARG divide start_ARG ∂ start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT end_ARG start_ARG ∂ italic_t start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT end_ARG - italic_λ start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ) italic_U = - 4 italic_π italic_g over~ start_ARG italic_ψ end_ARG ( divide start_ARG italic_ρ start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_ξ end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT - italic_i italic_ρ start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_η end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT end_ARG start_ARG 2 end_ARG ) italic_ψ , (31)\n\nρξsuperscript𝜌𝜉\\rho^{\\xi}italic_ρ start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_ξ end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT and ρηsuperscript𝜌𝜂\\rho^{\\eta}italic_ρ start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_η end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT being the isotopic spin matrices introduced in Eq.

In pursuing the analogy with the electromagnetic case, at this point Yukawa does not take into account the vector potential “as there’s no correct relativistic theory for the heavy particles” ([26], p. 50). He would have worked out the complete vector meson theory only later, in 1938 [88]. Then, from a non relativistic wave equation for the heavy particle, by neglecting the spin and a constant term, he was able to derive the full Hamiltonian for a system of two heavy particles at positions (x1,y1,z1)subscript𝑥1subscript𝑦1subscript𝑧1(x_{1},y_{1},z_{1})( italic_x start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT , italic_y start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT , italic_z start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ) and (x2,y2,z2)subscript𝑥2subscript𝑦2subscript𝑧2(x_{2},y_{2},z_{2})( italic_x start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT , italic_y start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT , italic_z start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ) and with a small relative velocity:\n\nH=𝐩122⁢M+𝐩222⁢M+g22⁢(ρ1ξ⁢ρ2ξ+ρ1η⁢ρ2η)⁢e−λ⁢r12r12+(ρ1ζ+ρ2ζ)⁢D,𝐻superscriptsubscript𝐩122𝑀superscriptsubscript𝐩222𝑀superscript𝑔22superscriptsubscript𝜌1𝜉superscriptsubscript𝜌2𝜉superscriptsubscript𝜌1𝜂superscriptsubscript𝜌2𝜂superscript𝑒𝜆subscript𝑟12subscript𝑟12superscriptsubscript𝜌1𝜁superscriptsubscript𝜌2𝜁𝐷\\displaystyle H=\\frac{{\\bf p}_{1}^{2}}{2M}+\\frac{{\\bf p}_{2}^{2}}{2M}+\\frac{g^% {2}}{2}\\left(\\rho_{1}^{\\xi}\\rho_{2}^{\\xi}+\\rho_{1}^{\\eta}\\rho_{2}^{\\eta}\\right% )\\frac{e^{-\\lambda r_{12}}}{r_{12}}+\\left(\\rho_{1}^{\\zeta}+\\rho_{2}^{\\zeta}% \\right)D,italic_H = divide start_ARG bold_p start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT end_ARG start_ARG 2 italic_M end_ARG + divide start_ARG bold_p start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT end_ARG start_ARG 2 italic_M end_ARG + divide start_ARG italic_g start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT end_ARG start_ARG 2 end_ARG ( italic_ρ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_ξ end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_ρ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_ξ end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT + italic_ρ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_η end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_ρ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_η end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ) divide start_ARG italic_e start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT - italic_λ italic_r start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 12 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT end_ARG start_ARG italic_r start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 12 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT end_ARG + ( italic_ρ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_ζ end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT + italic_ρ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_ζ end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ) italic_D , (33)\n\nwhere 𝐩1subscript𝐩1{\\bf p}_{1}bold_p start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT, 𝐩2subscript𝐩2{\\bf p}_{2}bold_p start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT are the momenta of the heavy particles, (ρ1ξ,ρ1η,ρ1ζ)superscriptsubscript𝜌1𝜉superscriptsubscript𝜌1𝜂superscriptsubscript𝜌1𝜁(\\rho_{1}^{\\xi},\\rho_{1}^{\\eta},\\rho_{1}^{\\zeta})( italic_ρ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_ξ end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT , italic_ρ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_η end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT , italic_ρ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_ζ end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ) and (ρ2ξ,ρ2η,ρ2ζ)superscriptsubscript𝜌2𝜉superscriptsubscript𝜌2𝜂superscriptsubscript𝜌2𝜁(\\rho_{2}^{\\xi},\\rho_{2}^{\\eta},\\rho_{2}^{\\zeta})( italic_ρ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_ξ end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT , italic_ρ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_η end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT , italic_ρ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_ζ end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ) are the corresponding isotopic spin matrices, r12subscript𝑟12r_{12}italic_r start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 12 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT is the distance between them and D𝐷Ditalic_D is the mass defect between proton and neutron. As he pointed out:\n\nThis Hamiltonian is equivalent to Heisenberg’s Hamiltonian, if we take for “Platzwechseintegral” J⁢(r)=−g2⁢e−λ⁢rr𝐽𝑟superscript𝑔2superscript𝑒𝜆𝑟𝑟J(r)=-g^{2}\\frac{e^{-\\lambda r}}{r}italic_J ( italic_r ) = - italic_g start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT divide start_ARG italic_e start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT - italic_λ italic_r end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT end_ARG start_ARG italic_r end_ARG, except that the interaction between the neutrons and the electrostatic repulsion between the protons are not taken into account ([26], p. 51).\n\nIndeed a comparison with Heisenberg’s expression in Eq. (1) clearly shows analogies and differences. Besides the explicit expression of J⁢(r)𝐽𝑟J(r)italic_J ( italic_r ), its overall sign comes out negative, so that the lowest energy state of H2superscript𝐻2H^{2}italic_H start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT has spin 1111 as required by experiments. This happens at odds with Heisenberg’s choice, which brought to a lowest energy state with spin 00. Finally, the constants g𝑔gitalic_g and λ𝜆\\lambdaitalic_λ can be determined from experimental data, and an agreement is found when taking λ𝜆\\lambdaitalic_λ between 1012superscript101210^{12}10 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 12 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT cm−11{}^{-1}start_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT - 1 end_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT and 1013superscript101310^{13}10 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 13 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT cm−11{}^{-1}start_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT - 1 end_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT and g𝑔gitalic_g as a multiple of the elementary charge e𝑒eitalic_e. Here Yukawa briefly hints to a possible derivation of the range of the interaction between neutron and proton, starting from the calculation of the mass defect of H2superscript𝐻2H^{2}italic_H start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT and the probability of the neutron-proton scattering under the assumption that the relative velocity is small with respect to the speed of light. In this respect, in a footnote he very interestingly mentions similar calculations carried out by Tomonaga:\n\nThese calculations were made previously, according to the theory of Heisenberg, by Mr. Tomonaga, to whom the writer owes much. A little modification is necessary in our case. Detailed accounts will be made in the next paper ([26], p. 52).\n\nFrom archival documents [77, 78, 82, 83] and recollections by Tomonaga [21], the role he played in the early stages of the birth of meson’s theory, which is hinted at in this footnote, clearly emerges [84]. We will come to this issue in the following Section.\n\nYukawa’s next step is to determine the nature of the quanta that the general principles of quantum field theory associate to the U𝑈Uitalic_U-field (which would then play for this field the same role that photons play for the electromagnetic field), by taking into account the fact that they should follow Bose statistics and have a charge equal to +e𝑒+e+ italic_e or −e𝑒-e- italic_e. As such, the operator associated to U𝑈Uitalic_U works by decreasing by one the number of quanta with negative charge, or increasing by one the number of quanta with positive charge, and satisfies the relativistic wave equation:\n\n(px2+py2+pz2−W2c2+λ2)⁢U=0,superscriptsubscript𝑝𝑥2superscriptsubscript𝑝𝑦2superscriptsubscript𝑝𝑧2superscript𝑊2superscript𝑐2superscript𝜆2𝑈0\\displaystyle\\left(p_{x}^{2}+p_{y}^{2}+p_{z}^{2}-\\frac{W^{2}}{c^{2}}+\\lambda^{% 2}\\right)U=0,( italic_p start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_x end_POSTSUBSCRIPT start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT + italic_p start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_y end_POSTSUBSCRIPT start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT + italic_p start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_z end_POSTSUBSCRIPT start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT - divide start_ARG italic_W start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT end_ARG start_ARG italic_c start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT end_ARG + italic_λ start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ) italic_U = 0 , (34)\n\nwhich can be obtained from Eq. (30) by identifying px=−i⁢h⁢∂∂xsubscript𝑝𝑥𝑖ℎ𝑥p_{x}=-ih\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}italic_p start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_x end_POSTSUBSCRIPT = - italic_i italic_h divide start_ARG ∂ end_ARG start_ARG ∂ italic_x end_ARG, py=−i⁢h⁢∂∂ysubscript𝑝𝑦𝑖ℎ𝑦p_{y}=-ih\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}italic_p start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_y end_POSTSUBSCRIPT = - italic_i italic_h divide start_ARG ∂ end_ARG start_ARG ∂ italic_y end_ARG, pz=−i⁢h⁢∂∂zsubscript𝑝𝑧𝑖ℎ𝑧p_{z}=-ih\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}italic_p start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_z end_POSTSUBSCRIPT = - italic_i italic_h divide start_ARG ∂ end_ARG start_ARG ∂ italic_z end_ARG, W=i⁢h⁢∂∂t𝑊𝑖ℎ𝑡W=ih\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}italic_W = italic_i italic_h divide start_ARG ∂ end_ARG start_ARG ∂ italic_t end_ARG. This equation shows that the quantum associated to the U𝑈Uitalic_U-field has – unlike the photon – a finite mass mU=λ⁢h/csubscript𝑚𝑈𝜆ℎ𝑐m_{U}={\\lambda h}/{c}italic_m start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_U end_POSTSUBSCRIPT = italic_λ italic_h / italic_c, which is related to the finite range of the nuclear force. By substituting λ=5⋅1012𝜆⋅5superscript1012\\lambda=5\\cdot 10^{12}italic_λ = 5 ⋅ 10 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 12 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT cm−11{}^{-1}start_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT - 1 end_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT, an estimate of mUsubscript𝑚𝑈m_{U}italic_m start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_U end_POSTSUBSCRIPT is obtained which is about 200200200200 times the electron mass. The new particle was called heavy quantum while the term meson was coined by Homi Bhabha in 1939 to point out that its mass is intermediate between the electron and the proton masses [90]. A comment is made on the possible observation of this massive particle in nuclear transformations, and Yukawa shows how the energies required for its production are not available in ordinary nuclear reactions. In fact, he shows that with typical nuclear energies, the wave function associated to U𝑈Uitalic_U-quanta is an evanescent function, leading to a negligible probability of observing a U𝑈Uitalic_U-quantum outside the nucleus. In his concluding remarks at the end of the paper, he suggests that the predicted massive quanta “may have some bearing on the shower produced by cosmic rays” ([26], p. 57). Indeed, many particles with such a huge energy could be found within cosmic rays, and a year later, in 1936, a particle compatible with that predicted by Yukawa was actually discovered in cosmic ray showers [91]. This particle was later identified with the muon while the true meson (the pion) would have discovered only in 1947 [92]. In fact, with his work, Yukawa began to go beyond the domain of nuclear physics, paving the way towards the regime of high energy physics. The particle physics era was about to start, as noticed by Brown [28].\n\nThe final part of Yukawa’s seminal work is devoted to an alternative formulation of β𝛽\\betaitalic_β-decay theory in which the quanta of the U𝑈Uitalic_U-field are assumed to interact with a light particle, which jumps from a neutrino state of negative energy to an electron state of positive energy. This process is implemented by making the U𝑈Uitalic_U-field to interact with an electron ΨksubscriptΨ𝑘\\Psi_{k}roman_Ψ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_k end_POSTSUBSCRIPT and a neutrino φksubscript𝜑𝑘\\varphi_{k}italic_φ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_k end_POSTSUBSCRIPT field (k=1,2,3,4𝑘1234k=1,2,3,4italic_k = 1 , 2 , 3 , 4), which amounts to add the new source term −4⁢π⁢g′⁢∑k=14Ψ~k⁢φk4𝜋superscript𝑔′superscriptsubscript𝑘14subscript~Ψ𝑘subscript𝜑𝑘-4\\pi g^{{}^{\\prime}}\\sum_{k=1}^{4}\\tilde{\\Psi}_{k}\\varphi_{k}- 4 italic_π italic_g start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT start_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT ′ end_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ∑ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_k = 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 4 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT over~ start_ARG roman_Ψ end_ARG start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_k end_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_φ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_k end_POSTSUBSCRIPT to the right hand side of Eq. (32). Here g′superscript𝑔′g^{{}^{\\prime}}italic_g start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT start_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT ′ end_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT is a coupling constant with the same dimension as g𝑔gitalic_g. A comparison between the matrix element corresponding to the above process and Fermi’s result shows that there is perfect agreement upon identifying 4⁢π⁢g⁢g′λ24𝜋𝑔superscript𝑔′superscript𝜆2\\frac{4\\pi gg^{{}^{\\prime}}}{\\lambda^{2}}divide start_ARG 4 italic_π italic_g italic_g start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT start_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT ′ end_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT end_ARG start_ARG italic_λ start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT end_ARG with Fermi’s g𝑔gitalic_g constant, whose value is 4⋅10−50⋅4superscript10504\\cdot 10^{-50}4 ⋅ 10 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT - 50 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT cm33{}^{3}start_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT 3 end_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT erg. By substituting λ=5⋅1012𝜆⋅5superscript1012\\lambda=5\\cdot 10^{12}italic_λ = 5 ⋅ 10 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 12 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT and g=2⋅10−9𝑔⋅2superscript109g=2\\cdot 10^{-9}italic_g = 2 ⋅ 10 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT - 9 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT, Yukawa found g′=4⋅10−17superscript𝑔′⋅4superscript1017g^{{}^{\\prime}}=4\\cdot 10^{-17}italic_g start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT start_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT ′ end_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT = 4 ⋅ 10 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT - 17 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT, which is smaller than g𝑔gitalic_g by a factor 10−8superscript10810^{-8}10 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT - 8 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT. So his final comment is:\n\nThis means that the interaction between the neutrino and the electron is much smaller than that between the neutron and the proton so that the neutrino will be far more penetrating than the neutron and consequently more difficult to observe ([26], p. 56).\n\nFor the first time a clear difference emerges between the weak and the strong nuclear force: a qualifying feature of Yukawa’s theory is that it provides a double mechanism able to explain the force between neutrons and protons, via the exchange of a meson, which carries energy, momentum and electric charge, as well as nuclear β𝛽\\betaitalic_β-decay, via the decay with small probability of an electrically negative (positive) meson into an electron-antineutrino (positron-neutrino) pair. Notice, moreover, that this view is very similar to the modern understanding of weak interactions as mediated by intermediate vector bosons.\n\nYukawa’s work was quite ignored abroad for a few years, given the fact that western scientists were not inclined to accept the idea of a new particle without experimental evidence. This is testified, for instance, by Pauli’s reluctance to publicly mention his neutrino’s hypothesis [9, 46, 47] or by Bohr’s negative attitude towards Yukawa’s results, clearly expressed during his visit to Japan in the spring of 1937 [29, 71]. To this respect, a comment by Tomonaga is enlightening:\n\nIt seems to me […] that the reason for this rejection is that although one wall after another was being removed and although there were many new discoveries, there remained the stubborn prejudice that there was a sanctuary inside nuclei, and the physics community was allergic to new particles. I might note that the workplaces of Heisenberg, Fermi and Yukawa, who successively removed the walls of the sanctuary, get farther and farther from Copenhagen where Bohr resided. This might mean that Bohr’s influence gets weaker as you move farther away ([21], p. 183).\n\nThese circumstances probably concurred to determine the successful endeavor of Yukawa, rather than that of some European physicist, despite the principles of new quantum mechanics had begun to spread in Japan only in 1929, after Nishina’s return from Europe [28]. Only after the discovery of a new charged particle in cosmic ray showers by Anderson and Neddermeyer [91], whose mass was compatible with meson’s mass, there appeared the first reference to Yukawa’s paper outside Japan, in a work by Oppenheimer and Serber [93]. A paper was then submitted by Yukawa [94],where he suggested the identification of his meson with the new particle discovered in cosmic rays. This prompted him to resume his theory and to develop it in a series of papers with various collaborators [88, 95, 96] until 1938, when his idea finally began to find wider acceptance."
