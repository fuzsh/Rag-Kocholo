        "text": "Comment: Causality violations in Quantum Time of Arrival allows for the reversed ordering of events where the detection of the output of a process precedes its preparation. Title: Novel Explanation for Long-Standing Neutron Lifetime Problem Proposed by UP Nuclear Physicist See… https://lnkd.in/e_Yz2HjQ “Neutrons, when plucked from the nucleus of atoms, become unstable and decay after some time. Physicists know that these unstable neutrons die after about 14 minutes, but they cannot pinpoint the exact seconds in which the neutrons last, even as today’s experiments are at their most precise. Dr. Denny Lane Sombillo of the UP Diliman College of Science National Institute of Physics (UPD-CS NIP) thinks the explanation may lie in how time behaves at a quantum level. “If this [theory] is correct,” he said, “we don’t need to modify the known physics and simply focus on the nature of time in quantum mechanics.” Dr. Sombillo’s theory involves a separate problem called the quantum time of arrival (QTOA) problem. His theory is built upon the works of Dr. Eric Galapon of UPD-CS NIP. By employing Einstein’s concept of causality in Dr. Galapon’s work, Dr. Sombillo provides an intuitive picture of the quantum time of arrival problem, one that can be used to explain other mysteries such as the neutron lifetime anomaly Dr. Sombillo noticed that the theory allows for a situation where the atom instantaneously arrives at the detector. That is, the atom can “teleport” to the detector, rendering no time to travel, which is physically impossible. This also violates the concept of causality, which states that one event (a cause) must first happen before another event (an effect). “You can think of causality as the proper ordering of events,” Dr. Sombillo explained. In the traveling atom, for example, the proper order of events would be that the atom must be prepared first (a cause) before appearing at the detector (an effect). That is, the atom should not be detected by the detector if it has not yet been prepared. Dr. Galapon’s theory allows for the reversed ordering of events where the detection of the atom precedes its preparation. “Intuitively, this reversed ordering should not be in the theory, but it is not easy to identify this loophole using mathematics alone,” Dr. Sombillo said. “One needs to evaluate the physical implications of the formalism.” By employing causality, Dr. Sombillo and his collaborator, Dr. Neris Sombillo of Ateneo de Manila University, were able to fix the issue. “We found that the instantaneous arrival time can be removed if we impose causality in the formulation of the time of arrival operator theory,” he said. “Even if we remove the causality-violating part, the quantum correction to time remains.”\n\nAPRIL 29, 2024 Laser excitation of Th-229 nucleus: New findings suggest classical quantum physics and nuclear physics can be combined [Image] A laser beam hits thorium nuclei, embedded in a crystal Physicists have been hoping for this moment for a long time: For many years, scientists all around the world have been searching for a very specific state of thorium atomic nuclei that promises revolutionary technological applications. It could be used, for example, to build a nuclear clock that could measure time more precisely than the best atomic clocks available today. It could also be used to answer completely new fundamental questions in physics—for example, the question of whether the constants of nature are actually constant or whether they change in space and time. Now this hope has come true: The long-sought thorium transition has been found, and its energy is now known exactly. For the first time, it has been possible to use a laser to transfer an atomic nucleus into a state of higher energy and then precisely track its return to its original state. This makes it possible to combine two areas of physics that previously had little to do with each other: Classical quantum physics and nuclear physics. A crucial prerequisite for this success was the development of special thorium-containing crystals. A research team led by Prof. Thorsten Schumm from TU Wien (Vienna) has now published this success together with a team from the National Metrology Institute Braunschweig (PTB) in the journal Physical Review Letters.\n\nNiels Henrik David Bohr ( 1885 – 1962 ) was a Danish physicist who made foundational contributions to understanding atomic structure and quantum theory, for which he received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1922. Bohr was also a philosopher and a promoter of scientific research. Some of his most notable contributions include: 1. Bohr Model of the Atom (1913): Bohr proposed a model of the atom where electrons orbit the nucleus in fixed paths or shells. Each orbit corresponds to a specific energy level. This model explained how atoms absorb or emit radiation when an electron moves from one orbit to another. 2. Quantum Theory and the Bohr-Sommerfeld Model: Bohr extended the quantum theory of Max Planck and Albert Einstein to atomic structure. He introduced the idea that electrons could only occupy certain orbits, and the energy of these electrons is quantized, meaning they can only have specific, fixed values. 3. Correspondence Principle (1920): Bohr introduced the correspondence principle, which states that the behavior of systems described by the theory of quantum mechanics replicates classical physics in the limit of large quantum numbers. 4. Principle of Complementarity (1927): This principle, introduced at the Solvay Conference, states that objects can have seemingly mutually exclusive properties depending on the experimental setup (e.g., light can exhibit both wave-like and particle-like properties). This was a fundamental principle of quantum mechanics. 5. Copenhagen Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics: Along with Werner Heisenberg, Bohr developed the Copenhagen Interpretation, which argues that a quantum system remains in a superposition of states until it interacts with, or is observed by, the external world. This interpretation was one of the first to describe the strange behavior of subatomic particles. 6. Liquid Drop Model in Nuclear Physics: Bohr and John A. Wheeler developed the liquid drop model to explain the nucleus's behavior and properties, which was crucial in understanding fission reactions. 7. Bohr-van Leeuwen theorem: is a concept in statistical mechanics that relates to the behavior of magnetic fields in systems in thermal equilibrium. 8. Research on the Manhattan Project: Bohr contributed to the Manhattan Project, which developed the first nuclear weapons during World War II. His insights into nuclear reactions and fission were valuable for this project. 9. Advocacy for Peaceful Use of Atomic Energy: Post World War II, Bohr became an advocate for the peaceful application of atomic energy and for international cooperation in nuclear energy control. Bohr's work not only advanced the understanding of atomic and quantum physics but also laid the groundwork for further developments in both theoretical and applied physics.

Electromagnetism, Weak Nuclear Interaction, and Strong Nuclear Interaction are fundamental forces in nature, and Gauge Theory plays a crucial role in understanding and explaining them. Gauge Theory explains both the QED (Abelian) and, most importantly, the Standard Model (Non-abelian). In the Lagrangian, Gauge Theory is invariant, meaning it does not change under local symmetries and transformations, and its parameters are space-time dependent. A gauge group is a Lie group, and the group of smooth maps from a manifold to a finite[1]dimensional Lie group is an example of a gauge group; that holds importance in Donaldson theory and in M-theory. Gauge fields arise from the group generators of the Lie Algebra and are included in the Lagrangian to ensure invariance under local symmetries, a concept known as Gauge Invariance. Gauge Theory primarily revolves around local symmetries involving gauge fields that mediate the forces of nature. Electromagnetism: Electromagnetism is one of the simplest instances of Gauge Theory as it involves only one symmetry, U(1) symmetry and it is described by Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). The electromagnetism’s (QED) gauge symmetry is abelian and the invariance of the action under a local phase rotation of the Fermi fields or complex field of electron wavefunction. To maintain the symmetry Ψ is minimally coupled to the gauge field. The behavior of this field is monitored by the Quantum Maxwell Equations. In the cases of weak and strong forces, their symmetries are much more complex, and phase transformations affect degrees of freedom much more intricately. Weak and Strong Forces (Non-Abelian): The Weak and Strong forces along with their symmetries are the fundamental frameworks of the Standard Model where the Weak Force is represented by the SU(2) symmetry and the Strong Force is associated with the SU(3) symmetry. For a non-Abelian gauge theory, the field strength tensor is represented by one more group generator (a) due to its noncommutativeness. In the case of Quantum Chromodynamics’ symmetry SU (3), in other words Strong Forces’, the phase transformation affects the color degrees of freedom (ic). The number of gauge fields is equal to the number of group generators. In this scenario, in order to maintain the invariance of the fermion action, the gauge field must adhere to a transformation that involves a shift of the field and a color rotation. The self-interactions of gluons have two major consequences: 1. asymptotic freedom, meaning a weakly interacting theory at small distances, and 2. the confinement of color charges at large distances. Yang-Mills Theory: Yang-Mills Theory generalizes the Gauge Theory to the non-Abelian groups, Standard Model, therefore creating the foundations of the QED and QCD, describing weak and strong nuclear interactions.\n\nElement 115: The Mysterious Metal That Could Redefine Our Universe Element 115, known on the periodic table as Moscovium (Mc), has long captured the imagination of scientists, engineers, and enthusiasts of the unknown. From its fleeting existence in high-energy experiments to its speculative applications in advanced propulsion systems, Moscovium's journey from theory to reality is a tale that borders on the fantastical. The Birth of Moscovium Element 115 was first synthesized in 2003 by a joint team of Russian and American scientists at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research in Dubna, Russia. They bombarded americium-243 with calcium-48 ions, creating a few atoms of Moscovium. With an atomic number of 115, this superheavy element sits in an exclusive neighborhood of the periodic table, where elements exist for mere milliseconds before decaying into lighter elements. Properties and Challenges Moscovium is highly unstable, making its study exceptionally challenging. Its most stable isotope, Mc-290, has a half-life of only 0.65 seconds. This fleeting existence limits the ability to explore its physical and chemical properties in depth. However, its placement in the periodic table suggests it would behave similarly to its lighter homologs, bismuth and antimony, exhibiting metallic characteristics. The Allure of Alien Technology Beyond its scientific intrigue, Moscovium has garnered attention due to its association with UFO folklore. In the late 20th century, claims emerged linking Element 115 to advanced propulsion systems of extraterrestrial origin. Proponents suggested that stable isotopes of Moscovium could create anti-gravity effects, revolutionizing space travel. While mainstream science has found no evidence to support these theories, the allure of such possibilities continues to captivate the public imagination. Potential Applications in Modern Science Despite its instability, the synthesis of Moscovium is not without potential benefits. The study of superheavy elements like Moscovium can enhance our understanding of nuclear physics and the forces that bind atomic nuclei. Additionally, these elements may help in the development of new materials with unprecedented properties, potentially leading to breakthroughs in various fields of engineering and technology. The Future of Element 115 The journey of Moscovium is far from over. Advances in particle accelerators and detection methods may one day allow scientists to create and study heavier, more stable isotopes of Element 115. This could unlock new realms of possibility, from probing the limits of nuclear stability to exploring new frontiers in material science and quantum mechanics. In the quest for knowledge, Element 115 stands as a testament to human curiosity and ingenuity. Whether it remains a scientific curiosity or becomes a cornerstone of future technologies, Moscovium's legacy is one of pushing boundaries and redefining what we know about the universe."
