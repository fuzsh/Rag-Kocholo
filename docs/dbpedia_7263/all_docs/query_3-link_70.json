        "text": "What’s a Life Worth?\n\nView lecture online\n\nW. Kip Viscusi, University Distinguished Professor of Law, Economics, and Management,Vanderbilt School of Law\n\nThe value of statistical life (VSL) is a measure that forms the basis for assessing the benefits of government policies that reduce risks, such as regulatory efforts. This presentation examines the empirical evidence on the heterogeneity of VSL and explores the potential implications for the valuation of regulatory policies, including the “senior discount” issue as well as differences in VSL with age, income, and immigrant status.\n\nMullen Lecture, sponsored by the Department of Economics\n\nJapanese Science and International Politics in the Interwar Period: The Nobel Candidacies of Hideki Yukawa (Physics) and Katsusaburo Yamagiwa (Physiology)\n\nView lecture online\n\nJames R. Bartholomew, Professor of History, Ohio State University\n\nJapan was a late-comer to modern science, though it produced important contributions earlier than many think, especially in medicine. This talk examines some of the controversial cases involving Japanese scientists and the Nobel Prize in physics and medicine and reflects on what they tell us about Japan, modern science and the Nobel Prizes themselves.\n\nSponsored by the Asian Studies Program; Office of the Dean of the College of Natural & Mathematical Sciences; Human Context of Science and Technology Program; Department of History\n\nIncome, Inequality, Educational Outcomes\n\nView lecture online\n\nSean Reardon, Professor of Education, Stanford University\n\nIncome inequality among the families of school-age children in the U.S. has grown sharply in the last 40 years. What impact has this had on the educational success of U.S. students? This talk will describe three recent studies that examine the trends in the relationship of income and income inequality to academic achievement and college enrollment.\n\nSponsored by the Department of Public Policy; Language, Literacy, and Culture Program\n\n2012 Post-Election Forum\n\nView lecture online\n\nDonald F. Norris, Professor and Chair, Department of Public Policy and Director, Maryland Institute for Policy Analysis and Research\n\nThomas F. Schaller, Professor, Department of Political Science\n\nAnnie Linskey, state politics and government reporter, The Baltimore Sun\n\nWhat happened in the 2012 Presidential Election, and why? Join experienced political analysts for an informed and engaging discussion about the election – the campaigns, candidates, key issues and voter turnout.\n\nSponsored by the Department of Public Policy; Maryland Institute for Policy, Analysis, and Research (MIPAR)\n\nAmerican Challenges for World Peace in the 21st Century\n\nView lecture online\n\nHorace G. Campbell, Professor of African American Studies and Political Science, Syracuse University\n\nDr. Campbell will assess current U.S. policies and political strategies to determine obstacles faced in attempting to fashion a lasting peace internationally. Where possible, this analysis will make use of predictions and proclamations suggested by Du Bois during the first half of the 20th century to assess the proper role of the U.S. in fashioning a strategy for world peace.\n\nW.E.B. Du Bois Lecture, sponsored by the Department of Africana Studies"
