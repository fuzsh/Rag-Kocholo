Ignite Acuity will share its findings with you very soon.\n\n\" Bluish green resonance in a Nuclear Reactor Core \" --------------------------------------------- CHERENKOV radiation is electromagnetic radiation emitted when a charged particle (such as an electron) moves through a dielectric medium faster than the phase velocity of light in that medium. It is similar to the bow wave produced by a boat travelling faster than the speed of water waves. Cherenkov radiation occurs only if the particle’s speed is higher than the phase velocity of light in the material. Even at high energies the energy lost by Cherenkov radiation is much less than that by the other mechanisms (collisions, bremsstrahlung). It is named after Soviet physicist Pavel Alekseyevich Cherenkov, who shared the Nobel Prize in physics in 1958 with Ilya Frank and Igor Tamm for the discovery of Cherenkov radiation, made in 1934. #mseswaranpremiummember\n\nThe four fundamental forces are gravity, electromagnetism, weak nuclear force, and strong nuclear force. Electromagnetic force The electromagnetic force, also called the Lorentz force, acts between charged particles, like negatively charged electrons and positively charged protons. At the level of an atomic nucleus, the strong force holds together the protons and neutrons that form the essence of the elements. Scientists watched\" an energetic (excited) helium atom release energy by emitting light, before returning to its unexcited state. During this process, the particles seemed to split at an unusual angle in repeated studies — always a 115-degree-angle. This phenomenon involving helium has no fitting explanation basis the four known forces that govern the natural world. The output of photon experiments from CERN's 2012 study which proposed a particle that could be the Higgs.\n\nWATCH: Meet the NRF-iThemba LABS researcher. Today we are in conversation with Dr Retief Neveling, an Experimental and Nuclear Physicist: https://lnkd.in/daUziFQx In a nutshell, Dr Neveling has to come up with ideas to understand nuclear structures and ideas for experiments. He then runs the experiments and analyses & publishes the data. No day is exactly the same, and there is never a boring moment for Dr Neveling.\n\nDiscoveries in nuclear physics challenge traditional models as scientists observe the decay of oxygen-28, once thought to be a \"doubly magic\" nucleus. The findings, made possible through experiments at the Rare Isotope Beam Facility in Japan, reveal a nuanced understanding of nuclear binding. Computational simulations at Oak Ridge Leadership Computing Facility further illuminate the complex interplay of nuclear forces, shedding light on fundamental aspects of atomic structure.

My next stop is at my Alma Mater, Western Michigan University, where I will be giving a colloquium talk about recent advances in quantum computation and work I have done with the Nuclear Theory Group at WMU with Prof. Elena Litvinova and Dr. John Novak. If you're around Kalamazoo, come check it out (see below flyer for details). #QuantumComputing #NuclearManyBodyPhysics #TowardsQuantumAdvantage\n\nGet Ready For Nuclear Clocks: Long-time Slashdot reader jrronimo says JILA physicist Jun Ye's group \"has made a breakthrough towards the next stage of precision timekeeping.\" From their paper recently published to arXiv: Optical atomic clocks use electronic energy levels to precisely keep track of time. A clock based on nuclear energy levels promises a next-generation platform for precision metrology and fundamental physics studies.... These results mark the start of nuclear-based solid-state optical clocks and demonstrate the first comparison of nuclear and atomic clocks for fundamental physics studies. This work represents a confluence of precision metrology, ultrafast strong field physics, nuclear physics, and fundamental physics. Read more of this story at Slashdot."
