The couple have four children, and were Crown Prince and Crown Princess of Jordan for over 30 years up until the last few months of King Hussein’s Reign.\n\n(personal note- The family home of Princess Sarvath, where the wedding was held, is on the same street as my grandparent’s home in Karachi, which was used to house the Royal Guests)"
