Born in Calcutta to Mohammed Ikramullah and Begum Shaista Suhrawardy Ikramullah, both of her parents served in prominent positions in the Pakistani establishment, and they lived in Karachi (personal note- the family home (which she frequently visits) is on the same street as my grandparent’s home in Karachi). Growing up between all the countries where her parents served as Ambassadors, she was educated in the United Kingdom, most notably at the University of Cambridge. In 1968, she married the then Crown Prince Hassan bin Talal of Jordan in Karachi and the couple have four children. Crown Princess Sarvath served as one of the highest-ranking ladies in the Kingdom of Jordan, supporting education, women’s issues, social welfare, and health, and was also very close to members of Foreign Royal Family. In 1999, just before his death, King Hussein appointed his son, the current King Abdullah, as his successor over his brother, Prince Hassan. Since then, Prince Hassan and Princess Sarvath have continued to hold a prominent role, and are regularly seen at European Royal events. I wish HRH a very Happy Birthday and Many Happy Returns!\n\nPrincess Sarvath’s Tiaras!"
