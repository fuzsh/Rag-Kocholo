        "text": "shahennews\n\nHRH Prince El Hassan bin Talal today celebrates his 75th birthday surrounded by family, and with the well-wishes of individuals and organizations from around the world, with whom he has worked and served tirelessly for many decades, promoting the cause of peace and human well being.\n\nToday marks the end of a year in which a lifetime of service to the people of Jordan were recognized by His Majesty King Abdullah II, who graciously bestowed Prince Hassan with the Order of the State Centennial in November 2021.\n\nPrince Hassan’s message has ceaselessly called for a balance of progress, peacemaking, and care for the environment, so that humankind may exist harmoniously and sustainably in, and with, our shared world. The Covid-19 Pandemic has increased the importance of a new portal of hope for all.\n\nPrince Hassan’s underlying message has spanned generations, and gains relevance with each transcendent challenge that our region and our planet is facing. His belief in the importance of regional collaboration and cohesive sustainable development is encapsulated in his adherence to the concept of a Mashreq for all who share a historic and relevant region of intertwined challenges and possibilities.\n\nHis Royal Highness has expressed his hopes for a reimagined region underpinned by three core structures and institutions: An Economic and Social Council for just development supported by international partners; A Water and Energy Community to manage in a coherent, institutional form the essential resources for lives lived equally and securely; and a Citizens’ Dialogue to bring together in a formalized manner the voices that represent civil society, science, politics, industry, and diplomacy.\n\nThe core of the Prince’s philosophy is to place the goal of Human Dignity at the fore when furthering a non discriminatory, pluralist transboundary vision of our region. He see the Mashreq as a place of potential for progress, sustainability,and security.\n\nHRH Prince El Hassan bin Talal was born on March 20, 1947, to Their Late Majesties King Talal and Queen Zein El Sharaf. He has been married to HRH Princess Sarvath El Hassan for 53 years, and they are blessed with four children, a son, HRH Prince Rashid, and three daughters, TRH the Princesses Rahma, Sumaya, and Badiya, as well as nine grandchildren.\n\npetra"
