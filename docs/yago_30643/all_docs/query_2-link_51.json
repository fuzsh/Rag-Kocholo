        "text": "Synopsis\n\nThe highly-anticipated royal wedding of the Crown Prince of Jordan, Al Hussein bin Abdullah, and his Saudi Arabian bride Rajwa Alseif, took place on Thursday in Amman, with the UK royals, Prince William and Kate Middleton, among many high-profile guests in attendance.\n\nLove always finds a way. And, same stands true for the Crown Prince of Jordan, Al Hussein bin Abdullah, and his Saudi Arabian bride Rajwa Alseif. The stage is set for the highly-anticipated royal wedding of Jordan.\n\nAll set to exchange the wedding vows on Thursday in Amman, the security around the palace has been tightened as high-profile guests are likely to make an appearance. The UK royals, Prince William and his wife Kate Middleton, are at the venue to attend the grand wedding.\n\nPrince William and Kate Middleton (Representative Image)\n\nThe Jordanian media revealed the reports hours before the palace ceremony began. The report of the British royals attending the nuptials was kept under wraps.\n\nBesides the Prince and Princess of Wales, the VIP guest list of the Jordan royal wedding includes an array of foreign aristocrats and dignitaries like US First Lady Jill Biden and White House climate envoy John Kerry, regional monarchs, the king of the Netherlands, and members of several European and Asian royal families.\n\nThe mehendi party\n\nAfter the ceremony, the wedding party will move to Al Husseiniya Palace, a 30-minute drive away, for a reception, entertainment and a state banquet. The royals are expected to greet more than 1,700 guests at the reception, according to an AP report.\n\nPre-Wedding Festivities\n\nThe Jordan royal wedding has been a lavish affair.\n\nThe pre-wedding celebrations kickstarted about a week ago with the bride-to-be's mehendi party, which was hosted by Jordanian Queen Rania. The grand dinner party was attended by several women.\n\nFor the ceremony, the bride was dressed in a floor-length body-hugging white dress with heavy gold embroidery on the bust. She wore a white net veil, featuring a long train, embroidered with gold bead embellishments.\n\nQueen Rania's toast to the new member of the family made the bride emotional at the pre-wedding dinner party in Amman.\n\nQueen Rania's toast to Rajwa al-Saif\n\nEarlier this week, the royals hosted a free concert at Amman International Stadium for several thousand young Jordanians. Well-known Arab singers like Egyptâ€™s Tamer Hosny and Lebanon's Ragheb Alama performed at the concert, which was organised to celebrate the Crown Prince.\n\nMeanwhile, Jordanian King Abdullah II threw a grand dinner party for his eldest son and soon-to-be groom Prince Hussein ahead of his wedding. The king's uncle Prince Hassan bin Talal also joined the celebrations.\n\nThe Jordanian royals\n\nOn Thursday morning, Saudi wedding guests and tourists - the men wearing white dishdasha robes and the women in brightly coloured abayas - filtered through the sleek marbled lobby of the Four Seasons Hotel in Amman. Noura Al Sudairi, an aunt of the bride, was wearing sweatpants and sneakers on her way to breakfast.\n\nKnow The Bride & The Groom\n\nThe royal wedding brings a brief moment of feel-good factor for the people of the country during tough economic times.\n\nThe 28-year-old crown prince's prominence grew in recent years as he joined his father, King Abdullah II, in public appearances. A graduate of Georgetown University, Hussein has also served in the military. He also earned global recognition when he took the UN General Assembly stage.\n\nOn the other hand, the 29-year-old Rajwa is the daughter of one of Saudi Arabia's wealthiest and most influential families. Her father is a founder of one of Saudi Arabia's largest engineering firms, and her mother is a relative of Saudi King Salman. She has a degree in architecture and has lived and worked in Los Angeles.\n\nCrown Prince Al Hussein and Rajwa Alseif\n\nThe royals did not reveal how the couple met or share details about their courtship. They got engaged at a traditional Muslim ceremony in the Saudi capital, Riyadh, in August 2022. Senior members of Jordan's royal family attended the engagement ceremony.\n\nThe royal wedding hashtag is #CelebratingAlHussein and the omnipresent logo has been made using the couple's initials in the Arabic phrase - 'We rejoice.'\n\nThe kingdom declared Thursday a public holiday so crowds of people could gather after the wedding service to wave at the couple's motorcade of red Land Rover jeeps - a nod to the traditional procession of horse riders clad in red coats.\n\nHuge screens have been set up across the nation so that royal fans can watch the ceremony live. The couple will sign the marriage contract at Zahran Palace in Amman.\n\nThe Free Concert\n\nThe last royal wedding in Jordan that caught people's eyes was in June 1993 when Abdullah married Queen Rania, who was born to a Palestinian family in Kuwait. They had met in Amman earlier that year when he was not crown prince and she worked in marketing.\n\nAfter the death of Abdullah's father in 1999, the Abdullah-Rania became the talk of the town.\n\n(With inputs from AP)\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\n\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n\n...moreless\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\n\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n\n...moreless\n\nShein is back in India.
