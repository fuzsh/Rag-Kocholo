        "text": "DUBAI: As Jordan’s Crown Prince Hussein bin Abdullah and Rajwa Al-Hussein welcome their first child, Arab News takes a closer look at the royal power couple’s relationship.\n\nEngagement\n\nThe couple first announced their engagement in August 2022.\n\nThe ceremony took place at the home of the bride-to-be’s father in Riyadh. The guests included several members of the Jordanian royal family — including Prince Hassan bin Talal, Prince Hashem bin Abdullah, Prince Ali bin Hussein, Prince Hashim bin Hussein, Prince Ghazi bin Muhammad, and Prince Rashid bin Hassan — along with members of Al-Saif’s family.\n\nBefore this, Princess Rajwa had lived life outside the public eye since her birth on April 28, 1994. She is the daughter of late Saudi businessman Khalid bin Musaed bin Saif bin Abdulaziz Al-Saif, who died in January this year, and his wife, Azza bint Nayef Abdulaziz Ahmad Al-Sudairi.\n\nMeanwhile, Prince Hussein has been in the spotlight since the moment he was born in Amman on June 28, 1994. He was appointed crown prince by royal decree on July 2, 2009.\n\nFirst official appointment\n\nRajwa’s first official appointment was in October 2022. She visited the Royal Hashemite Court along with her fiancé at the time and Prince Hussein bin Talal.\n\nA family wedding\n\nOn March 12, 2023, Rajwa attended her first royal wedding, accompanying the crown prince to Princess Imaan’s ceremony.\n\nShe wore a yellow Neolitsea dress by Roksanda and a pair of Malone Souliers Marla 85 Mules from the brand’s capsule collection with L’Atelier Nawbar.\n\nPrincess Rajwa’s henna night\n\nIn May 2023, Queen Rania hosted the pre-wedding henna night celebrations for Rajwa.\n\nThe princess looked radiant in an ethereal white and gold creation by celebrity-loved Saudi designer Honayda Serafi.\n\nApart from members of the royal family and Al-Saif’s family, as well as relatives and friends, Queen Rania also invited notable women from across Jordan’s diverse socio-economic and cultural landscape to take part in the celebrations.\n\nA royal wedding\n\nThe couple tied the knot on June 1, 2023 at Zahran Palace in Amman in a ceremony that included dignitaries and royals from around the world, including the UK’s Prince and Princess of Wales William and Kate Middleton; US First Lady Jill Biden; Qatar’s Sheikha Moza bint Nasser; the king and queen of Malaysia; the king and queen of The Netherlands; King Juan Carlos I and Queen Sofía of Spain; Prince Sébastien of Luxembourg; Crown Prince Frederik and Crown Princess Mary of Denmark; Crown Princess Victoria of Sweden and Prince Daniel, Duke of Västergötland; Haakon, Crown Prince of Norway and Hisako, Princess Takamado and her daughter, Princess Tsuguko of Takamado of Japan, among others.\n\nRajwa wore a classic white gown by celebrity-loved Lebanese couturier Elie Saab. The full-sleeved gown featured a dramatic veil that trailed for several meters behind her, while the neckline stood out for its chic draping.\n\nFor his part, the crown prince donned a suit that drew inspiration from the design worn by King Abdullah II on his wedding day in 1993. The suit’s sleeves paid homage to the style favored by both King Abdullah II and King Abdullah I.\n\nPregnancy announcement\n\nIn April 2024, the couple announced they are expecting their first child in the summer.\n\nBundle of joy\n\nThey welcomed their new bundle of joy, Eman, on Aug. 3.\n\nDUBAI: What does art have to do with the Olympics? Qatar Museums, the Gulf nation’s preeminent government institution for art and culture, believes that art is a way to further spur cultural diplomacy and highlight the country’s unique heritage and cultural scene in line with its 40-year participation in the Olympics.\n\nQatar Museums is celebrating the 2024 Summer Olympics with the staging of several exhibitions and public events in Paris, including art shows, book launches and the takeover of renowned restaurant Le Dali at Le Meurice hotel on Rue de Rivoli by Jiwan, an acclaimed restaurant located within Doha’s National Museum of Qatar, highlighting the rich culinary heritage of Qatari cuisine.\n\nThe series of events also includes the launch of the first-ever Arabic translation of writings, “Textes Choisis,” by Pierre de Coubertin, the French historian and visionary widely regarded as the father of the modern Olympic games.\n\nThe project is anchored by two exhibitions curated by Qatar Museums and 3-2-1 Qatar Olympic and Sports Museum: “Olympism: More Than a Dream Exhibition,” recording 40 years of Qatar’s participation in the Olympics since 1984, which runs until Aug. 25; and “Esports: A Game Changer,” which runs until Sept. 8 at the Residence Citeaux in Paris.\n\nThe latter exhibition explores how esports relates to gaming and traditional sports. It takes a sociological look at competitive gaming, defining it in relation to traditional sports and casual gaming, while also looking at its governing organizations and economies. On view are objects and documents that trace the history of esports, including the invention of the first electronic pinball machine almost a century ago and also snapshots of several of competitive gaming’s biggest contemporary stars. The final part of the show explores the future of esports in the gaming landscape and beyond, focusing on its societal, educational, recreational and occupational impacts.\n\nOn view in the “Olympism: More Than a Dream” exhibition is memorabilia, including Qatar’s first-ever Olympic medal, a bronze won by athlete Mohammed Suleiman in the 1,500 meter-running event during the 1992 Barcelona Summer Olympics.\n\nAnother program highlight is the gold medal triumph of the “Golden Falcon,” Mutaz Barshim, who won gold in the high jump event at the Tokyo 2020 Olympics.\n\n“In parallel with the Summer 2024 Olympics, the last few weeks witnessed Qatar Museums organizing a spectacular lineup of programs in Paris, affirming our longstanding commitment to cultural diplomacy and role in highlighting Qatar’s history and culture in the international arena,” Mohammed Saad Al-Rumaihi, CEO of Qatar Museums, told Arab News.\n\n“Stemming from the 2014 Cultural Agreement between Qatar and France, the summer program continues the legacy of the Qatar-France 2020 Year of Culture,” he added. “It celebrates a shared passion for sport in both countries, strengthens exchange and highlights Qatar’s offerings internationally.”\n\nThe launch of the Olympism exhibition was attended including Qatar’s Ambassador to France Sheikh Ali bin Jassim Al-Thani, Qatar Football Association President Jassim bin Rashid Al-Buenain and Vice President of the Qatar Olympic Committee Thani bin Abdulrahman Al-Kuwari, as well as the president of the Pierre de Coubertin Family Association, Alexandra de Navacelle de Coubertin.\n\nThe first part of the exhibition displays iconic Olympic artifacts from the museum’s collection, including Muhammad Ali’s left boxing glove from Rome 1960 and the Innsbruck 1964 Olympic torch.\n\nThe second part highlights key milestones in Qatar’s Olympic history, including the country’s debut at the Los Angeles 1984 Summer Olympics and strong presence at the Tokyo 2020 Games.\n\nThe rich artistic program that Qatar Museums is presenting during the Paris Olympics is organized to commemorate the Qatar-France 2020 Year of Culture, a Qatar Museums initiative, and the 2014 Cultural Agreement signed by Qatar and France.\n\nIt is also not the first time that Qatar is supporting the Olympics through culture and art. During the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Qatar presented Bayt Qatar, a hospitality house presenting live music performances, exhibitions and even an outdoor souk. In 2012, Qatar Museums staged a Heya exhibition featuring the creations of 70 Arab sportswomen.\n\nAl-Rumaihi said that these projects shed light on the unique culture of sportsmanship, highlighting “the diverse and vibrant aspects of Qatari sporting culture, and offer a unique opportunity for audiences in Paris and beyond to engage with the nation’s legacy and contemporary achievements.”\n\nDUBAI: Fans gave a warm welcome to Dubai-based Hollywood star Lindsay Lohan at Disney’s D23 fan convention at The Honda Center in Anaheim, California.\n\nOn Saturday, Lohan and Jamie Lee Curtis, the stars of the upcoming “Freaky Friday” follow-up, revealed to fans for the first time the sequel’s official title, “Freakier Friday,” expected in cinemas in 2025.\n\nLohan, who wore a black and white Balmain ensemble to the event, took to Instagram to share her excitement. “What a wonderful time I had at @disneyd23 Thank you for the overwhelming response of love and excitement for FREAKIER FRIDAY,” was how she captioned her carousel images from the event.\n\nDirected by Nisha Ganatra and produced by Kristin Burr, Andrew Gunn and Curtis, “Freakier Friday” picks up years after Curtis and Lohan’s characters, Tess and Anna, first endured an identity crisis: Anna has a daughter of her own and a soon-to-be stepdaughter. As they navigate challenges that come when two families merge, they discover that lightning might indeed strike twice.\n\nIn an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, Lohan also revealed that “Star Wars: Acolyte” star Manny Jacinto will play Lohan’s character’s husband in the film.\n\n“Manny is lovely. So funny,” Lohan said of her onscreen love interest.\n\nIt was also announced that original cast member Chad Michael Murray will be returning to play Jake in the sequel, fuelling fans’ excitement that they will get to see Lohan and Murray’s characters together 20 years after the original film.\n\nWhile it appears that they won’t be in a romantic relationship, Curtis teased, “Chad is in it. And boy, oh boy, is Chad in it.”\n\n“Freakier Friday” also stars Mark Harmon, Christina Vidal Mitchell, Haley Hudson, Lucille Soong, Stephen Tobolowsky and Rosalind Chao. New cast members include Julia Butters, Sophia Hammons and Maitreyi Ramakrishnan. Executive producers are Nathan Kelly, Ann Marie Sanderlin and Lohan.\n\nAside from Jacinto as Lohan’s onscreen husband, no further details have been released about the roles played by Butters, Hammons and Ramakrishnan — although it is likely at least one of them will be playing Lohan’s daughter and another one may take the part of her almost-stepdaughter.\n\nDUBAI: Saudi designer Honayda Serafi, founder of the label Honayda, made history this week by debuting at New York City’s Saks Fifth Avenue, becoming the first Saudi woman designer to be featured at the luxury department store.\n\nThe collection available at Saks is her spring/summer 2024 Cosmos release, which draws inspiration from the achievements of women in space exploration.\n\nIt showcases bright sky blues and reds, with glamorous sequins and vibrant crystals that echo the shimmering stars. Electric blue taffeta, dark magenta crepe and soft lace create a variety of textures, while body-shaping silhouettes, modernized mermaid cuts and dramatic capes add to the collection’s dynamic character.\n\nThis collection also pays tribute to visionaries such as Syrian scientist Maryam Al-Astrulabi, celebrating their contributions to history.\n\nFrom Priyanka Chopra to Lupita Nyong’o and Adriana Lima, Serafi has dressed many A-listers around the world. Since founding her label Honayda in 2016, Serafi has captured the attention of some of Saudi’s most stylish women and celebrities with her standout designs in elegant and sophisticated silhouettes.\n\nIn 2022, she became the first Saudi designer to showcase her collection at Harrods in London.\n\nOne of her achievements was designing a dress for Princess Rajwa of Jordan’s pre-wedding henna night celebration in May 2023.\n\nThe princess looked radiant in an ethereal white creation with gold embroidery that was inspired by Al-Shaby thobes of the Najd region in Saudi Arabia, where Princess Rajwa — who was formerly known as Rajwa Al-Saif — is from.\n\n“When I first got the call, I was extremely happy and proud to be part of this exceptional and historical moment. What I am especially proud of is communicating the love story between the crown prince and Rajwa in the design itself,” Serafi told Arab News at the time.\n\nIn June, Rajwa attended King Abdullah II’s silver jubilee celebrations in Amman alongside her husband, Crown Prince Hussein bin Abdullah II, in a bespoke gown by Serafi.\n\nIt was a flowy, floor-length gown in a deep red color. It featured intricate, silver embellishments along the cape-like sleeves.\n\n“As the creative director, I am deeply grateful for her trust and encouragement, which serve as a key to unlocking boundless creativity and beauty in my designs,” Serafi previously told Arab News of the continuing relationship with the royal.\n\nDUBAI: A new exhibition on contemporary Arab art, featuring more than 40 pieces, has opened at the School of Oriental and African Studies in London.\n\nThe 21st-century artworks, which include paintings, photographs and sculptures, are from the notable collection of the Barjeel Art Foundation in Sharjah, UAE.\n\nAmong the showcased participants at the exhibition, displayed at the university’s Brunei Gallery, are the Palestinian installation artist Mona Hatoum, Moroccan-Spanish painter Anuar Khalifi, Emirati photographer Lamya Gargash, and multidisciplinary Saudi Arabian artist Manal AlDowayan.\n\nEntitled “Hudood: Rethinking Boundaries,” the show runs until Sept. 21 and explores the topical themes of identity and displacement.\n\n“The exhibition delves into how boundaries influence personal and collective identities, particularly in the context of displacement and migration,” the foundation’s creator Sultan Sooud Al-Qassemi, who began teaching at SOAS in 2023, told Arab News.\n\n“It also explores how political and social constructs of boundaries impact individuals and communities, reflecting on themes of conflict, unity, and division,” he said.\n\nThe exhibition takes place amid anti-immigration riots in England and Northern Ireland, the most violent in the UK in over 10 years.\n\nSignificantly, this exhibition has been curated by eight SOAS students, who chose their theme based on personal conversations. They also decided to go for an Arabic title for the show, meaning “boundaries.”\n\nAl-Qassemi said: “The students’ diverse perspectives and innovative ideas brought fresh insights to the exhibition, ensuring it resonated with a wider audience.\n\n“This student-led approach also offered them a unique opportunity to engage directly with contemporary art and curatorial practices.\n\n“Throughout the process, we discovered the students’ keen analytical skills and their ability to think critically about complex themes, which enriched the exhibition in unexpected ways.”\n\nLast year, a wide selection of the foundation’s modern artworks was showcased in the British capital at the Christie’s auction house. But this year’s viewing has a different procedure and flavor.\n\n“We are happy to showcase the collection in London for the second year running,” said Al-Qassemi. “London is a major hub for visitors from the Arab world in the summer season so it is an opportunity for them to see art from their region while there.”"
