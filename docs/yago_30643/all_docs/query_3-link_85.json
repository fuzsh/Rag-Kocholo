        "text": "Eastern Frontiers\n\nThe publication, part of a series called Frontiers of the Roman Empire, is titled The Eastern Frontiers. The focus of the book, of which Mark Driessen is one of the editors, is on Roman military architecture and its impact on local communities. Prince Hassan himself wrote the foreword.\n\nSpin-offs\n\nFor years, Mark Driessen has been working in Jordan with his Jordanian colleague Fawzi Abudanah on the Udhruh Archaeological Project, exploring the hinterlands of the ancient centre of Petra. During the book publication, this project was put in the spotlights. At this event, Prince Hassan expressed his interest and requested a tour through the site. This was a spin-off that Mark Driessen had not seen coming.\n\nVisiting Udhruh\n\nWith the site surrounded by security, Mark Driessen and Fawzi Abudanah led the Prince and Princess through the Udhruh region. The royal guests were particularly interested in the ancient agro-hydrological systems employed in the Udhruh hinterland, and how gained knowledge on these can be applied in cooperation with local communities for sustainable agriculture in the near future.\n\nMedia attention\n\nThe book launch was reported by several Jordan news outlets, among others by the Jordan national television news programme.\n\nDue to the selected cookie settings, we cannot show this video here.\n\nWatch the video on the original website or\n\nInterested in the book?"
