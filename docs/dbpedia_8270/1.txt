About the Book

Author of the international bestseller The Prophet, Kahlil Gibran and his work remain influential to this day. President John F. Kennedy famously quoted from this book: ‘Ask not what your country can do for you; ask what you can do for your country’.

With a simplicity akin to that of Gibran’s own writing, Alexandre Najjar retraces Gibran’s life, from humble beginnings in Lebanon to his artistic training in Paris and meteoric rise to fame in the US, his adopted home.

Najjar examines Gibran’s letters, his publisher’s archives and unpublished documents, revealing the extent of his influence and the extraordinary message of peace and hope in all of his work.
