And think not you can direct the course of love, for love, if it finds you worthy, directs your course.” From social issues to human concerns; from the tragedy and power of love to the longings of the soul; from good and evil to crime and punishment; from happiness and sorrow to life and death; from inner beauty to dreams and mysticism; Kahlil Gibran’ s poems, parables, aphorisms, and stories are a source of timeless wisdom.

This book is a priceless collection of some of his most notable works including The Prophet, The Wanderer, The Madman, and The Broken Wings. The third best-selling poet of all time after

Shakespeare and Lao-Tzu, Gibran continues to enlighten his readers through his celebrated works.
