And he closed his eyes and prayed in the silences of his soul.\n\nBut as he descended the hill, a sadness came upon him, and he thought in his heart:\n\nHow shall I go in peace and without sorrow? Nay, not without a wound in the spirit shall I leave this city. Long were the days of pain I have spent within its walls, and long were the nights of aloneness; and who can depart from his pain and his aloneness without regret?\n\nToo many fragments of the spirit have I scattered in these streets, and too many are the children of my longing that walk naked among these hills, and I cannot withdraw from them without a burden and an ache.\n\nIt is not a garment I cast off this day, but a skin that I tear with my own hands.\n\nNor is it a thought I leave behind me, but a heart made sweet with hunger and with thirst.\n\nYet I cannot tarry longer.\n\nThe sea that calls all things unto her calls me, and I must embark.\n\nFor to stay, though the hours burn in the night, is to freeze and crystallize and be bound in a mould.\n\nFain would I take with me all that is here. But how shall I?\n\nA voice cannot carry the tongue and the lips that gave it wings. Alone must it seek the ether.\n\nAnd alone and without his nest shall the eagle fly across the sun.\n\nNow when he reached the foot of the hill, he turned again towards the sea, and he saw his ship approaching the harbour, and upon her prow the mariners, the men of his own land.\n\nAnd his soul cried out to them, and he said:\n\nSons of my ancient mother, you riders of the tides,\n\nHow often have you sailed in my dreams. And now you come in my awakening, which is my deeper dream.\n\nReady am I to go, and my eagerness with sails full set awaits the wind.\n\nOnly another breath will I breathe in this still air, only another loving look cast backward,\n\nAnd then I shall stand among you, a seafarer among seafarers. And you, vast sea, sleepless mother,\n\nWho alone are peace and freedom to the river and the stream,\n\nOnly another winding will this stream make, only another murmur in this glade,\n\nAnd then shall I come to you, a boundless drop to a boundless ocean.\n\nAnd as he walked he saw from afar men and women leaving their fields and their vineyards and hastening towards the city gates.\n\nAnd he heard their voices calling his name, and shouting from field to field telling one another of the coming of his ship.\n\nAnd he said to himself:\n\nShall the day of parting be the day of gathering?\n\nAnd shall it be said that my eve was in truth my dawn?\n\nAnd what shall I give unto him who has left his plough in midfurrow, or to him who has stopped the wheel of his winepress? Shall my heart become a tree heavy-laden with fruit that I may gather and give unto them?\n\nAnd shall my desires flow like a fountain that I may fill their cups?\n\nAm I a harp that the hand of the mighty may touch me, or a flute that his breath may pass through me?\n\nA seeker of silences am I, and what treasure have I found in silences that I may dispense with confidence?\n\nIf this is my day of harvest, in what fields have I sowed the seed, and in what unremembered seasons?\n\nIf this indeed be the hour in which I lift up my lantern, it is not my flame that shall burn therein.\n\nEmpty and dark shall I raise my lantern,\n\nAnd the guardian of the night shall fill it with oil and he shall light it also.\n\nThese things he said in words. But much in his heart remained unsaid. For he himself could not speak his deeper secret.\n\nAnd when he entered into the city all the people came to meet him, and they were crying out to him as with one voice.\n\nAnd the elders of the city stood forth and said:\n\nGo not yet away from us.\n\nA noontide have you been in our twilight, and your youth has given us dreams to dream.\n\nNo stranger are you among us, nor a guest, but our son and our dearly beloved.\n\nSuffer not yet our eyes to hunger for your face.\n\nAnd the priests and the priestesses said unto him:\n\nLet not the waves of the sea separate us now, and the years you have spent in our midst become a memory.\n\nYou have walked among us a spirit, and your shadow has been a light upon our faces.\n\nMuch have we loved you. But speechless was our love, and with veils has it been veiled.\n\nYet now it cries aloud unto you, and would stand revealed before you.\n\nAnd ever has it been that love knows not its own depth until the hour of separation.\n\nAnd others came also and entreated him. But he answered them not. He only bent his head; and those who stood near saw his tears falling upon his breast.\n\nAnd he and the people proceeded towards the great square before the temple.\n\nAnd there came out of the sanctuary a woman whose name was Almitra. And she was a seeress.\n\nAnd he looked upon her with exceeding tenderness, for it was she who had first sought and believed in him when he had been but a day in their city. And she hailed him, saying:\n\nProphet of God, in quest of the uttermost, long have you searched the distances for your ship.\n\nAnd now your ship has come, and you must needs go.\n\nDeep is your longing for the land of your memories and the dwelling place of your greater desires; and our love would not bind you nor our needs hold you.\n\nYet this we ask ere you leave us, that you speak to us and give us of your truth.\n\nAnd we will give it unto our children, and they unto their children, and it shall not perish.\n\nIn your aloneness you have watched with our days, and in your wakefulness you have listened to the weeping and the laughter of our sleep.\n\nNow therefore disclose us to ourselves, and tell us all that has been shown you of that which is between birth and death.\n\nAnd he answered,\n\nPeople of Orphalese, of what can I speak save of that which is even now moving within your souls?\n\nAnd now it was evening.\n\nAnd Almitra the seeress said, Blessed be this day and this place and your spirit that has spoken.\n\nAnd he answered, Was it I who spoke? Was I not also a listener?\n\nThen he descended the steps of the Temple and all the people followed him. And he reached his ship and stood upon the deck.\n\nAnd facing the people again, he raised his voice and said:\n\nPeople of Orphalese, the wind bids me leave you.\n\nLess hasty am I than the wind, yet I must go.\n\nWe wanderers, ever seeking the lonelier way, begin no day where we have ended another day; and no sunrise finds us where sunset left us. Even while the earth sleeps we travel.\n\nWe are the seeds of the tenacious plant, and it is in our ripeness and our fullness of heart that we are given to the wind and are scattered.\n\nBrief were my days among you, and briefer still the words I have spoken.\n\nBut should my voice fade in your ears, and my love vanish in your memory, then I will come again,\n\nAnd with a richer heart and lips more yielding to the spirit will I speak.\n\nYea, I shall return with the tide,\n\nAnd though death may hide me, and the greater silence enfold me, yet again will I seek your understanding.\n\nAnd not in vain will I seek.\n\nIf aught I have said is truth, that truth shall reveal itself in a clearer voice, and in words more kin to your thoughts.\n\nI go with the wind, people of Orphalese, but not down into emptiness; And if this day is not a fulfilment of your needs and my love, then let it be a promise till another day.\n\nMan’s needs change, but not his love, nor his desire that his love should satisfy his needs.\n\nKnow therefore, that from the greater silence I shall return.\n\nThe mist that drifts away at dawn, leaving but dew in the fields, shall rise and gather into a cloud and then fall down in rain.\n\nAnd not unlike the mist have I been.\n\nIn the stillness of the night I have walked in your streets, and my spirit has entered your houses,\n\nAnd your heart-beats were in my heart, and your breath was upon my face, and I knew you all.\n\nAy, I knew your joy and your pain, and in your sleep your dreams were my dreams.\n\nAnd oftentimes I was among you a lake among the mountains.\n\nI mirrored the summits in you and the bending slopes, and even the passing flocks of your thoughts and your desires.\n\nAnd to my silence came the laughter of your children in streams, and the longing of your youths in rivers.\n\nAnd when they reached my depth the streams and the rivers ceased not yet to sing.\n\nBut sweeter still than laughter and greater than longing came to me.\n\nIt was the boundless in you;\n\nThe vast man in whom you are all but cells and sinews;\n\nHe in whose chant all your singing is but a soundless throbbing.\n\nIt is in the vast man that you are vast,\n\nAnd in beholding him that I beheld you and loved you.\n\nFor what distances can love reach that are not in that vast sphere?\n\nWhat visions, what expectations and what presumptions can outsoar that flight?\n\nLike a giant oak tree covered with apple blossoms is the vast man in you. His might binds you to the earth, his fragrance lifts you into space, and in his durability you are deathless.\n\nYou have been told that, even like a chain, you are as weak as your weakest link.\n\nThis is but half the truth. You are also as strong as your strongest link.\n\nTo measure you by your smallest deed is to reckon the power of ocean by the frailty of its foam.\n\nTo judge you by your failures is to cast blame upon the seasons for their inconstancy.\n\nAy, you are like an ocean,\n\nAnd though heavy-grounded ships await the tide upon your shores, yet, even like an ocean, you cannot hasten your tides.\n\nAnd like the seasons you are also,\n\nAnd though in your winter you deny your spring,\n\nYet spring, reposing within you, smiles in her drowsiness and is not offended. Think not I say these things in order that you may say the one to the other, “He praised us well. He saw but the good in us.”\n\nI only speak to you in words of that which you yourselves know in thought.\n\nAnd what is word knowledge but a shadow of wordless knowledge?\n\nYour thoughts and my words are waves from a sealed memory that keeps records of our yesterdays,\n\nAnd of the ancient days when the earth knew not us nor herself,\n\nAnd of nights when earth was up-wrought with confusion.\n\nWise men have come to you to give you of their wisdom. I came to take of your wisdom:\n\nAnd behold I have found that which is greater than wisdom.\n\nIt is a flame spirit in you ever gathering more of itself,\n\nWhile you, heedless of its expansion, bewail the withering of your days. It is life in quest of life in bodies that fear the grave.\n\nThere are no graves here.\n\nThese mountains and plains are a cradle and a stepping-stone.\n\nWhenever you pass by the field where you have laid your ancestors look well thereupon, and you shall see yourselves and your children dancing hand in hand.\n\nVerily you often make merry without knowing.\n\nOthers have come to you to whom for golden promises made unto your faith you have given but riches and power and glory.\n\nLess than a promise have I given, and yet more generous have you been to me.\n\nYou have given me my deeper thirsting after life.\n\nSurely there is no greater gift to a man than that which turns all his aims into parching lips and all life into a fountain.\n\nAnd in this lies my honour and my reward,—\n\nThat whenever I come to the fountain to drink I find the living water itself thirsty;\n\nAnd it drinks me while I drink it.\n\nSome of you have deemed me proud and over-shy to receive gifts.\n\nToo proud indeed am I to receive wages, but not gifts.\n\nAnd though I have eaten berries among the hills when you would have had me sit at your board,\n\nAnd slept in the portico of the temple when you would gladly have sheltered me,\n\nYet was it not your loving mindfulness of my days and my nights that made food sweet to my mouth and girdled my sleep with visions?\n\nFor this I bless you most:\n\nYou give much and know not that you give at all. Verily the kindness that gazes upon itself in a mirror turns to stone,\n\nAnd a good deed that calls itself by tender names becomes the parent to a curse.\n\nAnd some of you have called me aloof, and drunk with my own aloneness,\n\nAnd you have said, “He holds council with the trees of the forest, but not with men.\n\nHe sits alone on hill-tops and looks down upon our city.”\n\nTrue it is that I have climbed the hills and walked in remote places.\n\nHow could I have seen you save from a great height or a great distance?\n\nHow can one be indeed near unless he be far?\n\nAnd others among you called unto me, not in words, and they said,\n\n“Stranger, stranger, lover of unreachable heights, why dwell you among the summits where eagles build their nests? Why seek you the unattainable?\n\nWhat storms would you trap in your net,\n\nAnd what vaporous birds do you hunt in the sky?\n\nCome and be one of us.\n\nDescend and appease your hunger with our bread and quench your thirst with our wine.”\n\nIn the solitude of their souls they said these things;\n\nBut were their solitude deeper they would have known that I sought but the secret of your joy and your pain,\n\nAnd I hunted only your larger selves that walk the sky.\n\nBut the hunter was also the hunted;\n\nFor many of my arrows left my bow only to seek my own breast.\n\nAnd the flier was also the creeper;\n\nFor when my wings were spread in the sun their shadow upon the earth was a turtle.\n\nAnd I the believer was also the doubter; For often have I put my finger in my own wound that I might have the greater belief in you and the greater knowledge of you.\n\nAnd it is with this belief and this knowledge that I say,\n\nYou are not enclosed within your bodies, nor confined to houses or fields.\n\nThat which is you dwells above the mountain and roves with the wind.\n\nIt is not a thing that crawls into the sun for warmth or digs holes into darkness for safety,\n\nBut a thing free, a spirit that envelops the earth and moves in the ether.\n\nIf these be vague words, then seek not to clear them.\n\nVague and nebulous is the beginning of all things, but not their end,\n\nAnd I fain would have you remember me as a beginning.\n\nLife, and all that lives, is conceived in the mist and not in the crystal. And who knows but a crystal is mist in decay?\n\nThis would I have you remember in remembering me:\n\nThat which seems most feeble and bewildered in you is the strongest and most determined.\n\nIs it not your breath that has erected and hardened the structure of your bones?\n\nAnd is it not a dream which none of you remember having dreamt, that builded your city and fashioned all there is in it?\n\nCould you but see the tides of that breath you would cease to see all else,\n\nAnd if you could hear the whispering of the dream you would hear no other sound.\n\nBut you do not see, nor do you hear, and it is well.\n\nThe veil that clouds your eyes shall be lifted by the hands that wove it,\n\nAnd the clay that fills your ears shall be pierced by those fingers that kneaded it. And you shall see.\n\nAnd you shall hear.\n\nYet you shall not deplore having known blindness, nor regret having been deaf.\n\nFor in that day you shall know the hidden purposes in all things,\n\nAnd you shall bless darkness as you would bless light.\n\nAfter saying these things he looked about him, and he saw the pilot of his ship standing by the helm and gazing now at the full sails and now at the distance.\n\nAnd he said:\n\nPatient, over patient, is the captain of my ship.\n\nThe wind blows, and restless are the sails;\n\nEven the rudder begs direction;\n\nYet quietly my captain awaits my silence.\n\nAnd these my mariners, who have heard the choir of the greater sea, they too have heard me patiently. Now they shall wait no longer.\n\nI am ready.\n\nThe stream has reached the sea, and once more the great mother holds her son against her breast.\n\nFare you well, people of Orphalese.\n\nThis day has ended.\n\nIt is closing upon us even as the water-lily upon its own tomorrow.\n\nWhat was given us here we shall keep,\n\nAnd if it suffices not, then again must we come together and together stretch our hands unto the giver.\n\nForget not that I shall come back to you.\n\nA little while, and my longing shall gather dust and foam for another body.\n\nA little while, a moment of rest upon the wind, and another woman shall bear me.\n\nFarewell to you and the youth I have spent with you.\n\nIt was but yesterday we met in a dream. You have sung to me in my aloneness, and I of your longings have built a tower in the sky.\n\nBut now our sleep has fled and our dream is over, and it is no longer dawn.\n\nThe noontide is upon us and our half waking has turned to fuller day, and we must part.\n\nIf in the twilight of memory we should meet once more, we shall speak again together and you shall sing to me a deeper song.\n\nAnd if our hands should meet in another dream we shall build another tower in the sky.\n\nSo saying he made a signal to the seamen, and straightway they weighed anchor and cast the ship loose from its moorings, and they moved eastward.\n\nAnd a cry came from the people as from a single heart, and it rose into the dusk and was carried out over the sea like a great trumpeting.\n\nOnly Almitra was silent, gazing after the ship until it had vanished into the mist.\n\nAnd when all the people were dispersed she still stood alone upon the sea-wall, remembering in her heart his saying,\n\n“A little while, a moment of rest upon the wind, and another woman shall bear me.”\n\n*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE PROPHET ***"
