I served and I saw that service is joy.”\n\n03\n\n“Generosity is giving more than you can, and pride is taking less than you need.”\n\n04\n\n“The real test of good manners is to be able to put up with bad manners pleasantly.”\n\n05\n\n“You give but little when you give of your possessions. It is when you give of yourself that you truly give.”\n\n07\n\n“No one can reveal to you nothing but that which already lies half-asleep in the dawning of your knowledge.”\n\n09\n\n“The teacher who is indeed wise does not bid you to enter the house of his wisdom but rather leads you to the threshold of your mind.”\n\n13\n\n“I have learnt silence from the talkative, toleration from the intolerant, and kindness from the unkind; yet strange, I am ungrateful to these teachers.”\n\n15\n\n“To understand the heart and mind of a person, look not at what he has already achieved, but what he aspires to.”\n\n22\n\n“A traveler I am, and a navigator, and every day I discover a new region within my soul.”"
