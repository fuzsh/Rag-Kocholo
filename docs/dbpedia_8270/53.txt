Renowned for his literary masterpiece The Prophet (1923), Lebanese-American artist and writer Kahlil Gibran (1883–1931) began experimenting with the visual arts at a young age. Telfair Museums boasts the largest public collection of visual art by Gibran in the United States, donated in 1950 by his lifelong supporter and mentor Mary Haskell Minis, a native Southerner. The collection consists of five oils and 92 works on paper rendered in the artist’s lyrical style, which reflects the influence of symbolism, Pre-Raphaelitism, and other stylistic trends prevalent around the turn of the 20th century.
