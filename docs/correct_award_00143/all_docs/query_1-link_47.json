        "text": "Stanford University is home to 20 living Nobel laureates.\n\nSixteen additional Stanford laureates are deceased. The business of “claiming” laureates can be controversial: Where and when was a winner’s work done? Stanford, for example, lists but does not claim laureates who are not on the faculty, even if they have a significant Stanford connection. And Stanford does not list winners with a more fleeting or tenuous connection. John Steinbeck, the 1962 literature winner, for instance, did not make the cut although he attended Stanford – receiving a “C” in freshman English in 1919 and dropping out in 1921, only to reenter the university as a journalism major in 1923 and drop out again in 1925.\n\nAbout the Nobel Prize\n\nCarolyn Bertozzi\n\nChemistry (2022) Carolyn Bertozzi, the Baker Family Director of Sarafan ChEM-H, the Anne T. and Robert M.
