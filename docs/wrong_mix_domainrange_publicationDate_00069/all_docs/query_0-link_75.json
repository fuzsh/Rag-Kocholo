Cannell to craft a whodunit with buddy-cop charm and suspects aplenty–most of them in someone else’s body.”­­ —USA Today on Lock In\n\n\"If anyone stands at the core of the American science fiction tradition at the moment, it is Scalzi.\" —The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction, Third Edition\n\n“Plenty of action, great character development, vivid and believable world-building, and a thought-provoking examination of disability culture and politics. . . . Yet more evidence that Scalzi is a master at creating appealing commercial fiction.” —Kirkus Reviews (starred review) on Lock In"
