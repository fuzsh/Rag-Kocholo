        "text": "The Sirens of Titan by Kurt Vonnegut\n\nThe Sirens of Titan is a tough book to review. And it’s not really SF at all though it adopts the trappings of the genre. The thing about Kurt Vonnegut’s books is that they are so deceptively simple. The prose is spare, humorous, ironic, and to the point. And yet the story is very ambitious, as it seeks to provide answers to some very basic questions. Why do we exist? What is the universe for? Do we have any free will to determine our lives? Should we have chicken or fish for dinner?\n\nThe story focuses on Malachi Constant, the richest man in America; Winston Niles Rumfoord, an older wealthy man who travels throughout the solar system with his dog Kazak, manifesting in various locations in space and time; Unk and Boaz, two buddies in the Martian Army preparing to invade the Earth; Beatrice Rumfoord, who is afraid of living but ends up having a troubled son named Chrono; Salo the Tralfamadorian, an alien robot stranded far from home who has more emotions than many of the human characters.\n\nThe plot sounds ridiculous when written down. Winston Niles Rumfoord roams throughout the solar system, manifesting in various times and places after encountering a chrono-synclastic infundibulum. He can see the past and the future, and intercedes in human affairs, such as arranging an elaborate and utterly inept invasion of Earth by a Martian Army of conscripts controlled by radio antenna. He also founds “The Church of God the Utterly Indifferent” in the aftermath of this failed invasion, which turns the invaders into martyrs and makes the people of Earth feel guilty for eradicating them. The Church teaches people that they really shouldn’t expect any divine intervention in their lives, because clearly God doesn’t give a toss. This should liberate people to live their lives unencumbered by superstition, aware that life is what they make of it, and nobody is watching out for them.\n\nMalachi Constant is the other main character, a fairly unpleasant person whose wealth was inherited from his absurdly lucky father, who spent his entire life in a hotel room betting on stocks with a unique and bizarre strategy, and also completely neglected Malachi as a child. Malachi is a rich man in search of answers, but instead he finds himself spirited off to Mars after losing his fortune, losing his memory, getting embroiled in the failed Mars invasion, and finally ending up on the moon Titan with his lover and child, before being granted some final peace of mind at a bus stop in Indianapolis. Make sense? Of course not, but then neither do our lives or the universe at large.\n\nThe Sirens of Titan, like all of Vonnegut’s books, really has a simple message behind the irony and absurdity. Our lives are not dictated by a divine plan, and people are free to be either good or evil without any particular consequences. But given those circumstances, wouldn’t it be better to be as kind and sympathetic to the people you love? And don’t take yourself so damn seriously.\n\nI listened to the Audibook version narrated by Jay Snyder. I think Kurt Vonnegut is probably well-suited to listening, since his prose is very minimal and focuses mainly on character dialogue and commentary on life. So you don’t need to keep track of a huge laundry-list of characters or intrigues. His writing is also very sardonic and dripping with irony, so I thought Jay Snyder did pretty well conveying that sense.\n\n~Stuart Starosta\n\nLike most of Vonnegut’s books, so strange, so cynical, but so enjoyable. The audio version is a great choice for this title.\n\n~Kat Hooper"
