        "text": "My guest this month is a sci-fi author and poet. He’s also a regular blogger, and you can follow his works and musings at Lines by Leon right here on WordPress. Leon is a member of my Fantasy Sci-Fi Writers Alliance and his thought-provoking stories and cartoon illustrations captured my imagination, so I invited him for a chat. Read on and be inspired.\n\nLet’s Meet the Author\n\nLeon Stevens is a multi-genre author, composer, guitarist, and artist, with a Bachelor of Music and Education. He published his first book of poetry in 2020, followed by a book of original classical guitar compositions and a short story collection of science fiction/post-apocalyptic tales. His newest publications are the sci-fi trilogy, The View from Here, and a new collection of poetry titled, A Wonder of Words.\n\nLet’s Get Started\n\nYou published your first book of poetry around the same time I started writing fiction. I’m wondering if you’re like me and quite a few of my Spotlight guests who used the time at home during the Pandemic to follow your dreams. Or, what’s the story behind your 2020 journey?\n\nLS. I started writing song lyrics and poetry to get me through a difficult time before the world went through its own, and I decided to publish some of the poems so that others might benefit or at least be entertained. I enjoyed the writing process so I continued it by crafting some short science fiction stories.\n\nDLL. Well, your reviews tell me you achieved your goal. Here’s what one reviewer had to say about Wonder of Words:\n\nThis is an inspiring, straightforward and original poetry borne from everyday experiences of the author. It contains poems created in lockdown, poems on the environment, a 30-day poetry challenge, and ends with a short biographic story.\n\nI like how the author introduces each poem with his thoughts and how the author manages to speak to the reader in an everyday way, often with humour. There’s material here for the reader to want to create their own poetry, so can be a useful resource for newer poets.\n\n5 stars is reserved for classic poetry, so this 100-page book gets a 4-star rating due to its ease of picking up the book from anywhere and easy understanding of the poetry content, and also the good value for money. I also like the author’s quick sketches. ~ Karuna\n\nI think of you as an author firmly planted in sci-fi. When you say in your bio that you’re a multi-genre author, does that mean your stories fall within multiple sci-fi sub-genres, or do you also write outside of that umbrella?\n\nLS. Well, I do write poetry, science fiction, humor, and romance, so that’s pretty multi, right? Wait, did I say romance? I may have written a short story about that…\n\nDLL. Awesome! Multi is where it’s at. And every writer needs to write at least one romance. I thought of another question. Were you inspired by other humorist writers, and if so who is your favorite?\n\nLS. Kurt Vonnegut is a humorist in his own way, and Douglas Adams Hitchhiker series for sure let me know it was okay to mix genres. I do remember reading a lot of Dave Barry in the mid-80s.\n\nDLL. Ah yes! Dave Barry. Another that comes to mind is Patrick McManus. My Dad loved his pieces in Field and Stream and my husband has all his books.\n\nAs I read your eclectic short story and poetry collection, Knot at the End of the Rope (great title by the way), the thing that stands out is your use of a variety of short-story and poetic styles and how masterfully you craft each one at whichever length, whether three lines or three pages. Writing short pieces is quite different from writing novels. How long had you been writing short stories before publishing your first collection? Did you use or recommend using contests or community writing challenges to hone your skills? Or how else did you build your body of work?\n\nLS. I credit my dad for instilling the love of science fiction in me. I wrote about it in one of my first blog posts: https://linesbyleon.com/2020/11/29/returning-to-roots/\n\nI think I started with short stories because of my short attention span. Say what you want and get out, I suppose. Also many of my stories seemed to come to a natural conclusion on their own, sooner rather than later.\n\nI don’t think I used any prompts for my short stories, but for my second poetry collection I did include all 31 poems I wrote during the National Poetry Month 30 poems in 30 days. The 31st poem was for my mom. I had mentioned my dad in two of them and knew she’d be mad if I left her out.\n\nMy first novella started as a short story and I decided to do NaNoWriMo (National Novel Writing Month). Yeah, it ended as a novella, 20 000 words short.\n\nDLL. That’s marvelous. You’re now my go to for short story and poetry inspiration. I recently tried my hand at poetry, and I’m hooked! I love writing short stories in between working on the big drafts and taking time out on occasion to participate in contests like Writing Battle. The creators Max and Teona are from Nova Scotia by the way and have been my guests the last two years if you want to get behind the scenes of a super creative writing contest platform.\n\nThanks for sharing the blog about your dad. We both had fathers who instilled the reading bug it seems. Can you add a little more here about how he got you into sci-fi?\n\nLS You’ll have to read the blog post. How’s that for driving traffic to my website?\n\nDLL. Nicely done! 😊\n\nSo, that leads to another aspect of writing short stories, which is the number of completed works you can produce compared to a lengthy novel, by which I also mean the volume of ideas. You’ve built up quite a collection in addition to putting out regular cartoon illustrations, blogging, and other endeavors. What is your idea process like? Are you one of those who dream stories while you sleep? What are your tips and practices for generating and keeping track of so many ideas?\n\nLS. Most of my blog posts are written on the day I post, so they are often topical. With my cartoons, more often than not, a weird idea will just occur to me.\n\nSometimes I’ll come up with ideas when I’m out cycling or running. Or, after I turn out the lights and settle into bed. I don’t recommend that, though. I’m positive I’ve left many great ideas in slumberland.\n\nDLL. I suspected it might be a grab them as they pop up sort of process, which makes your cartoons so fun–that momentary thought becoming an image on paper before it disappears. And I bet many of them slip into existence from your dreamworld. Dreaming ideas is a topic for a whole other conversation, eh?\n\nLS. I used to write down my dreams as soon as I woke up, but not for quite a while. It is a good way to remember them before they fade.\n\nDLL. It truly is. Now, if I could be so disciplined. My husband even bought me a small recorder, but do I use it? Not once. I’d rather wake up in a dither trying to keep all the threads of my imagination alive. Brain exercise.\n\nAt the outset, I mentioned the great premise in The View From Here–taking two ordinary outdoor explorers who stumble separately into a mysterious… I’ll just say ‘place’ to guard against spoilers… and then decide to explore the mysteries together using their nature skills and rudimentary knowledge about science. Can you talk more about your three-part story and the inspiration behind it?\n\nLS. The View from Here is the short story that became a novella, which eventually ended up as a trilogy. The original idea was about a hidden entrance (or was it an exit) in an underground society, but I think I changed it because of my enjoyment of the outdoors.\n\nLike many short stories, it had an open ending, so when I decided to attempt NaNoWriMo, I cheated and got a 4000 word head start, which didn’t help me any. The novella was written to be a stand-alone, but again the ending had loose ends, so I kept going.\n\nBeing my first attempt at a longer work, I limited the characters to two. I also wanted it to feel like the video game Myst, where there are situations that present a puzzle to be solved before moving forward.\n\nDLL. Great stuff. Thanks! And hey, cheating at NaNoWriMo often leads to amazing success. So, glad we get to enjoy The View From Here as a result.\n\nYou have a new novel on presale, Euphrates Vanished. The premise looks amazing. Is this a full-sized novel? Can you give us a peek inside?\n\nLS. I tried to make it a novel, I really did, but it tapped out at 39K. So close. Here is the blurb:\n\n[You can download the first chapter when you sign up for Leon’s newsletter.]\n\nWho or what is your biggest inspiration when it comes to writing fiction? What are your top three favorite reads? Or in the alternative, your top three favorite authors?\n\nLS. My favorite authors would be Kurt Vonnegut and Isaac Asimov and my favorite books would be…Nope, can’t do it.\n\nI grew up on the classics. Wells, Asimov, Bradbury, Heinlein, Niven, I always joke that it was much easier to write science fiction in the early days because you could make up more stuff that the public didn’t question. Now, if you describe how a warp drive works incorrectly…Yikes!\n\nDLL. LOL. That is so true! I love it!\n\nI tried my hand at incorporating science fiction in the third part of The Starlight Chronicles. My antagonists were ancient aliens, so I eventually addressed their evolution and biology, how their moons gave them immortality (even delving into gamma rays), and other cool stuff.\n\nFor me, it’s another opportunity to fall down the rabbit hole of research in a totally fictional way. Fortunately, my readers aren’t likely to question my science because it’s more about the romance. But you never know, so I do my best.\n\nSo many amazing poems, Leon! Tell us about your love of writing poetry, how you got started, and your advice to someone who would like to write in prose.\n\nLS. I mentioned earlier the impetus for writing poetry, but essentially, it’s a way to create a little snippet of life, always from the poet’s perspective but often relatable by the readers who are unable to put certain feelings into words. I try not to complicate my poems too much by creating confusing or obscure analogies. I want my readers not to have to think too hard about what I am trying to say.\n\nMy advice? Avoid rhymes.\n\nNo, that’s not true. There is a place for rhyming poems, but I try not to follow any specific form or rhyme scheme. Usually it happens when it happens.\n\nDLL. Great insight! Thanks!\n\nI enjoy your cartoons immensely though I admit I don’t always get the joke. Sometimes I do, and I laugh out loud or say to myself, “Huh… good point.” Other times, they make me stare at them while I scratch my head and think about what I’m seeing and why you decided to capture the idea with your brief “squiggles.” They truly are mini-stories, and your joy in conveying them comes through. I appreciated your Instagram post about “how a little squiggle can convey an idea.” Can you talk more about that?\n\nLS. Yeah, some of the cartoons get the reaction, “Whaaa?!” I started The Miniscules because I had some funny—well I thought they were—ideas, but since I was terrible at drawing characters, I just did a squiggle and said, “That’s, good enough.” Later, I had to force myself to attempt more detail when I created The Untitled. Great name, huh? Guess how I came up with that…\n\nYou’re also a musician. Tell us about that area of your creative life and how it intertwines with your writing.\n\nLS. Writing music is like writing words. Notes, put in the right order will tell a story, set a mood, or evoke an emotion. I don’t play or write as much as I used to, but I did write a short piece as homage to the story and the characters of my trilogy.\n\nWhen a reader finishes The Final View, there is a link to a video I created for it as well.\n\nI still have a couple of compositions I want to record, but I’ve always found it a long and difficult process to do, but all my recordings are here:\n\nDLL. Here is a YouTube video with a classical guitar piece by Leon that I particularly enjoyed.\n\nOh. I forgot I had a YouTube channel…\n\nDLL. Haha! Well, I found it.\n\nCan you share how you benefit and what you enjoy most about engaging with your audience through your newsletter, blog, and social posts? What tips do you have for independent authors on finding their outreach niche?\n\nLS. Authors love to hear from their readers! So many authors (both indie and mainstream) have embraced various platforms allowing them to interact with their fans. It’s pretty cool when someone like Neil Gaiman responds to a comment you have posted.\n\nNewsletters, blogs, and social media posts have to be an extension of a writer’s craft. I feel it has to add value to the readership by entertaining them beyond the books.\n\nDLL. Awesome. Thank you! And now I know someone who knows Neil Gaiman. 😄\n\nLS. Yeah. “Knows.” I don’t think he follows me, though.\n\nWhat are the best tools and resources you’ve found as an independent author for covers, editing, publishing, etc?\n\nLS. There’s so many it can be overwhelming, but the top 5 are:\n\nCanva (covers)\n\nReedsy (editor)\n\nAma— I can’t believe I have to say it…Amazon. It’s easy, and it has a large reach with good promotions.\n\nChatGPT\n\nWait! What?\n\nOh, I joke of course. Want to get into a discussion about AI “authored” books? I didn’t think so.\n\nDLL. Lots of good stuff here! And yes, I could talk a lot about AI. So many sides to that controversial technology, good and bad. Just yesterday, someone I follow on Writer’s Digest posted a quick take on what she is hearing from the average person (non-writer) who uses AI to do their job. To them, “It’s just another tool.”\n\nI love Canva for design. I’ve used other resources, but always end up there the most. Reedsy is also one of my favorite resources for instructional content, live and otherwise. It’s good to get a recommendation regarding their editing option. And yes, Amazon is super easy. However, I go back and forth with being enrolled in the 90-day KDP Select. I like having my books in more stores, but the truth is Amazon is where the sales are.\n\nWhat are your favorite tips and techniques for staying productive while balancing life with your creative endeavors?\n\nLS. I try to write every day, even if it is just a single line of dialogue.\n\nDLL. So, do you keep a notebook close at all times?\n\nLS. Nope, just sit at the computer and check my email, oops, I mean my social channels, wait, I mean write.\n\n🙂Ah yes. Talk about rabbit holes. By the way, I recently decided rabbit hole is synonymous with retirement. I now have the freedom to spend the day going down them… until I remember I still need to be productive.\n\nThis is a good spot to include a link to Lines by Leon, Poems, Prose, and Pictures because to me it strikes a note of balance.\n\nI’ll wrap this up with a question to a sci-fi writer I’ve always wanted to ask: Where do you most want to encounter life from beyond our planet… on Earth, or from a starship, and why?\n\nLS. Want to encounter? Who says I haven’t?\n\nDLL. Haha! Good answer. I’ll be looking for clues in your stories. Thank you so much for stopping by Leon. All the best to you!\n\nOh, and thank you so much for having me as a guest on your blog too in this beautiful month of June. I super enjoyed this exchange!"
