        "text": "Kurt Vonnegut created some of the most outrageously memorable novels of our time, such as Cat's Cradle, Breakfast Of Champions, and Slaughterhouse Five. His work is a mesh of contradictions: both science fiction and literary, dark and funny, classic and counter-culture, warm-blooded and very cool. And it's all completely unique.\n\nWith his customary wisdom and wit, Vonnegut put forth 8 basics of what he calls Creative Writing 101:\n\nUse the time of a total stranger in such a way that he or she will not feel the time was wasted.\n\nGive the reader at least one character he or she can root for.\n\nEvery character should want something, even if it is only a glass of water.\n\nEvery sentence must do one of two things—reveal character or advance the action.\n\nStart as close to the end as possible.\n\nBe a sadist. No matter how sweet and innocent your leading characters, make awful things happen to them—in order that the reader may see what they are made of.\n\nWrite to please just one person. If you open a window and make love to the world, so to speak, your story will get pneumonia.\n\nGive your readers as much information as possible as soon as possible. To heck with suspense. Readers should have such complete understanding of what is going on, where and why, that they could finish the story themselves, should cockroaches eat the last few pages.\n\nThe greatest American short story writer of my generation was Flannery O'Connor (1925-1964). She broke practically every one of my rules but the first. Great writers tend to do that.\n\nFrom the preface to Vonnegut's short story collection Bagombo Snuff Box."
