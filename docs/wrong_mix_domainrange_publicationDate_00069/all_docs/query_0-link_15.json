This might be Tchaikovsky's best so far, and that's saying something.\"—Stephen Baxter\n\n\"He writes incredibly enjoyable sci-fi, full of life and ideas.\"—Patrick Ness\n\n\"Adrian Tchaikovsky: king of the spiders, master worldbuilder, and asker of intriguing questions. His books are packed with thought-provoking ideas (as well as lots of spiders; did I mention the spiders?). One of the most interesting and accomplished writers in speculative fiction.\"—Christopher Paolini\n\n\"Tchaikovsky writes space opera on a grand scale, creating a massive, complex, vividly realized future environment...He guides the reader through this endlessly intriguing universe with a rock-steady sure hand. Fans of space opera should leave the book in breathless anticipation of the second installment in the trilogy.”\n\n—Booklist\n\n“Dazzlingly suspenseful...Tchaikovsky’s intricately constructed world is vast yet sturdy enough to cradle inventive science, unique aliens, and complex political machinations. With a mix of lively fight scenes, friendly banter, and high-stakes intrigue, this is space opera at its best.”\n\n—Publishers Weekly\n\n“Adrian Tchaikovsky’s Shards of Earth is one of the most stunning space operas I’ve read this year...Tchaikovsky’s world building is on glorious display as he throws all manner of spaceships, creepy aliens and strange technology into a delicious sci-fi soup. It’s dense, it’s funny, it’s exciting, it’s touching and it’s perfect for someone looking for a space opera built on a grand scale.”\n\n—BookPage\n\n\"A rip-roaring space opera featuring starship battles, genetically enhanced superhumans and multiple weird and wonderful aliens...I can't wait to read the next one.\"—New Scientist\n\nPraise for Adrian Tchaikovsky:\n\n\"Brilliant science fiction and far out world building.\" —James McAvoy on Children of Time\n\n\"This is superior stuff, tackling big themes—gods, messiahs, artificial intelligence, alienness—with brio.\" ―Financial Times on Children of Time\n\n\"Inventive, funny and engrossing, this book lingers long after you close it.\" ―Tade Thompson, Arthur C. Clarke Award-winning author of Rosewater on The Doors of Eden\n\n\"Full of sparking, speculative invention...The Doors of Eden is a terrific timeslip / lost world romp in the grand tradition of Turtledove, Hoyle, even Conan Doyle. If you liked Primeval, read this book.\" ―Stephen Baxter on The Doors of Eden\n\n\"What a ride...talks like big-brained science fiction and runs like a fleet-footed political thriller.\"―John Scalzi on The Doors of Eden\n\n\"With The Doors of Eden, Tchaikovsky has created a fantastic and highly imaginative new genre: evolution SF.\"―Peter F. Hamilton on The Doors of Eden—--"
