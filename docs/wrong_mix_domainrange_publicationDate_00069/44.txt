Who Is Kurt Vonnegut?

Born on November 11, 1922, in Indianapolis, Indiana, Kurt Vonnegut dropped out of Cornell University to enlist in the US Army.

The army sent him to study in engineering, and the next year, he was deployed in Europe and fought in the Battle of the Bulge.

Vonnegut became a prisoner of war. And while in Dresden, Germany, he witnessed the Allied firebombing of the city. He, along with other POWs, was only able to escape harm because they were working in an underground meat locker.

Vonnegut soon returned home from the war and married his high school girlfriend, Jane Marie Cox. The couple had three children, and Vonnegut also adopted his sister’s children after her death in 1958.

Before embarking on a writing career, Vonnegut worked several odd jobs such as a teacher, a newspaper reporter, and a public relations employee for General Electric. His first novel, Player Piano, was published in 1952. It’s the first time people noticed the writer’s talent for satire, and more novels followed soon after that.

Vonnegut is known as one of the most influential American novelists of the 20th century. His works usually depict humor mixed with science fiction and literature.

War is also a common element in his work, and one of his most famous novels, Slaughterhouse-Five, draws some of its power from the writer’s own experiences during the war. The book’s main character, Billy Pilgrim, is also a soldier who became a prisoner of war.

Vonnegut’s humanist point of view and unusual writing style, consisting of long sentences and little punctuation, soon became a catalyst for him to become a new literary voice.
