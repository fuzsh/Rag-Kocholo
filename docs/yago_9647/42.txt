Directed by Alex Chandon (Perivella and Cradle Of Fear), Inbred sets its scene in a sleepy village in Yorkshire that prides itself on keeping itself to itself. A group of young offenders and their case workers set out to do some community work in the remote town and, after meeting the locals, quite quickly they discover why it might be that the town is so keen to keep things that way. There’s no official release date, other than 2012, but I hope it’s sooner rather than later – The English countryside meets Wrong Turn. Cannot wait for this one, check out the trailer:
