        "text": "Inbred\n\nDirector: Alex Chandon\n\nWriter: Alex Chandon, Paul Shrimpton\n\nCast: Jo Hartley, James Doherty, James Burrows, Neil Leiper, Chris Waller, Nadine Rose Mulkerrin, Seamus O’Neill\n\nPart of: /slash Filmfestival\n\nPlot:\n\nKate (Jo Hartley) and Jeff (James Doherty) are social workers, taking a group of kids to a small town for a community project/weekend getaway. But when they arrive there, things start to get a little weird. First, the house they’re staying at is an absolute mess. And the local pub their celebratory drink after cleaning leads them to is also not exactly the most welcoming place. But it soon turns out that the local population is even worse than that.\n\nI really, really enjoyed Inbred. It’s an absolutely demented and fun addition to the hillbilly horror genre and at the same time also a loving salute to it.\n\nInbred could feel like just a cheap rip-off of the many “weird, murderous countryfolk” movies out there. But there are two things that kept it from being trite. One, it just really has fun with the concept and seems to obviously enjoy it. And two, the script was really good, especially with the kids.\n\nChandon and Shrimpton just really nailed the dynamics between the kids and you honestly care for them, also because the actors were good. Kate and Jeff are great characters, too and especially Jo Hartley is absolutely wonderful in the role. Could have watched her all night.\n\nThe make-up and gore were pretty good, too.\n\nThough there were a few moments of protagonist stupidity that had me rolling my eyes a little bit, it didn’t really take away from my enjoyment at all.\n\nI just had a blast watching this film and even though it was on pretty late (starting at 1am), I had no trouble whatsoever to stay awake. That’s a quality mark right there.\n\nSummarising: Fun."
