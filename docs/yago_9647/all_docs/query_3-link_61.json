        "text": "About Inbred\n\nA disparate group of young urban offenders and their social workers embark on a community service weekend in the strange, remote Yorkshire village of Mortlake, which prides on keeping itself to itself. A minor incident with some local inbred youths rapidly escalates into a blood-soaked, deliriously warped nightmare for all involved. This is a demented horror film with nowt taken out.\n\nHighly recommended for those with both a strong stomach and a wickedly dark sense of humour. A cult classic already. 9 out of 10.\n\nVideoviews.org\n\nINBRED is the bastard son of The League of Gentlemen and The Texas Chain Saw Massacre, with an approach to gross-out gore that Peter Jackson showed in Bad Taste and Brain Dead. It’s completely aware of what it is and doesn’t try to be anything that it’s not. And there’s nothing at all wrong with that.\n\nReluctantgeek.blog.com/movies/inbred-review/\n\nINBRED is a darkly funny, wonderfully disgusting vile piece of cinema that you just can’t peel your eyes away from.\n\nSTARBURST\n\nProduction wise the film looks amazingly beautiful and the effects are spot on. INBRED isn't a film to talk about, it's one to watch over and over again. With all the lame horror films coming out of Hollywood anymore it was a real treat watching a horror film that delivers on every level.\n\nBoxofficebuz.com"
