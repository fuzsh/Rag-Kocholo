        "text": "SYNOPSIS\n\nWritten and Directed by Alex Chandon\n\nA disparate group of young urban offenders and their care workers embark on a community service weekend in the strange, remote Yorkshire village of Mortlake, which prides on keeping itself to itself. A minor incident with some local inbred youths rapidly escalates into a blood-soaked, deliriously warped nightmare for all involved. This is a demented horror film with nowt taken out.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nINBRED is the warped brain child of UK writer/director Alex Chandon (www.alexchandon.com), who is responsible for the independent cult feature films CRADLE OF FEAR (2001) and PERVIRELLA (1997) as well as numerous award winning shorts and music promos.\n\nThe script was written in 2009 and it immediately piqued the interest of Michael Kraetzer, who had distributed Alex’s CRADLE OF FEAR in Germany, and who was about to set up his own production company, New Flesh Films. Michael and his partners loved the INBRED script and decided to back the movie and so the wheels were set in motion. Alex developed a few drafts of the script and the final draft is co-written by his long time film making buddy Paul Shrimpton, who lives in Yorkshire.\n\nIt was while staying with Paul that Alex decided that Yorkshire was the perfect location for the film; Paul’s hometown of Thirsk has some stunning locations and a community untouched by film-makers and so they were all eager to help and get involved.\n\nAlex invited Split Second Films (www.splitsecond-films.com), a Midlands based independent production company to be the UK arm of the production, and so Margaret Milner Schmueck became the UK producer and pre-production began officially in June 2010 for a 4 week shoot in August 2010."
