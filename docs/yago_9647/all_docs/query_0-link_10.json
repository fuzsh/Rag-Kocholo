        "text": "I'm the same age as cult horror director Alex Chandon and like him I have had a fascination with gory films since I was a teenager. Unlike Alex, though, I only dreamt about making my own movies, never actually getting off my lazy arse to pick up a camera, which is precisely why I admire stuff like Chainsaw Scumf**k: it might be technically shoddy, suffering from terrible acting and lousy special effects, but at least it got made, and started Alex on a path which led to him directing a couple of proper films that are well worth any gore-hound's time (Cradle of Fear and Inbred).\n\nChainsaw Scumf**k is a 7-minute short in which a masked killer attacks some long-haired layabouts in their flat, using a pair of shears and a chainsaw to disembowel and hack off the limbs of his victims. The direction is ropey, the image quality very poor (do you remember how bad VHS actually was?), the editing choppy and the script almost non-existent. But it's there. On the interweb. For all time. Proof of Alex's love of gloriously gory horror way back when he was young."
