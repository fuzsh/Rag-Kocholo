Helped by deranged angel Dani Filth, who leaves a trail of charnel house death in his crimson wake, the cannibal convict forces two Goth vamps to endure a one night stand from hell, two tough female robbers to see through each other, an obscenely rich coke-head to chop up more than a few lines and an internet surfer to descend into madness when he uncovers the ultimate web depravity. Partial Screening.\n\nDirected by:\n\nAlex Chandon\n\nProduced by:\n\nEddie Kane\n\nExecutive Producer(s):\n\nPaul Luke, Andy Skivington\n\nWritten by:\n\nAlex Chandon\n\nMain Cast:\n\nDani Filth, Emily Booth, Stuart Laing |\n\nAbout the Director(s):\n\nAlex Chandon is a writer and director, known for Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels (1998), Inbred (2011) and The Perv Parlor (1995)."
