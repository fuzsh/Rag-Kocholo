        "text": "Alex Chandon is a British independent horror specialist who grew out of the late 1980s fanzine scene, starting out with no-budget, shot on video shorts before graduating to bigger (if not necessarily better) things with the likes of Cradle of Fear (2001), Pervirella (1997) and Inbred (2011). Closely allied to the UK’s underground music scenes (Cradle of Fear featured members of the extreme metal band Cradle of Filth and he’s directed a number of music videos for the band) Chandon has written, directed, acted in and provided digital effects for a number of British genre films but his career started with these short films that proved to hugely popular with young gore fans despite their considerable technical limitations.\n\nChandon’s first film, Chainsaw Scumfuck (1988) is a seven minute gore fest featuring a murderous maniac who murders his way through a household using a chainsaw and gardening shears. It would be bad form to give a film called Chainsaw Scumfuck, directed on a domestic video camera by a an enthusiastic 19 year old horror fan to much of a hard time but… it really is bloody awful. You can cut it some slack but the terrible lighting and sound, dreadful acting and horrible heavy metal score make it more of an ordeal than it needs to be. But everyone involved seems to be having a good time and given that it was probably made for no money whatsoever, the gore is plentiful – it was clearly made by and for rebellious youth who’d rather watch anything than a mainstream film just to stick it to the man, even if it is as terrible as this.\n\nBad Karma came next, shot in north London in 1991 which, like Chainsaw Scumfuck, was shot had no discernible budget and was populated by a collection of Chandon’s energetic but talentless friends. Predictably, it’s not very good but it’s a definite stup up from the earlier film. Dave Jackson (Julius Barnet) and his friends are enjoying a barbecue in their back garden when a pair of bloodthirtsy Hare Krishna zombies turn up and chaos reigns. The survivors beat a hasty retreat, lock themselves in a neighbour’s house and come to realise that there’s something much bigger going on than a localised viral outbreak.\n\nThe winner of The Dark Side magazine’s Opportunity Shocks film-making competition, you certainly can’t fault Bad Karma‘s enthusiasm – on the tiniest of budgets (reportedly just £350), Chandon and his crew create some impressively grisly effects, from Hare Krishna zombies to graphic castrations, from (intentionally?) ridiculous rubber monsters to blood-soaked chainsaw attacks. Clearly no-one was taking any of this nonsense seriously as Chandon gleefully throws mad Krishnas, fetish-gear superheroes, banjo-plucking rednecks and a papier-maché demon into a delirious mix that at least has the good sense to not take itself seriously.\n\nChandon crams enough material for a trilogy into a brisk 36 minutes though it still manages to outstay its welcome, particularly in the mid-section when things get repetitive – for long stretches the film is just a gore effects show reel and the relentless blood-letting gets dull very quickly. But you know what to expect with this sort of thing and it’s churlish to complain too much when it’s clear from the off that it’s just an ambitious amateur film made by a group of horror fanatic friends. On that level it works (just) but it’s the sort of thing you’ll probably only want to watch once.\n\nChandon promoted the film heavily, sending review copies to all of the many publications that made up the British horror fanzine boom of the late 1980s and early 90s and claims in an interview with the [http://www.sexgoremutants.co.uk/spot17.html Sex Gore Mutants website] that it sold “2-3,000 copies over 4-5 years.”\n\nLucio Fulci meets A Clockwork Orange in Chandon’s second short film Drillbit (1992) which, like its predecessor, is a no-budget home movie that impresses with a wildly over-ambitious story (in a chaotic and violent near-future a cure for AIDS causes its victims to become zombies) that plays too much like an extended show reel (to be fair the video sleeve suggests that a show reel is exactly what this is – and Chandon later said that it was [http://www.sexgoremutants.co.uk/spot17.html “conceived as a showreel to impress Lloyd Kaufman from Troma”]) for its own good.\n\nChandon showed no real sign of having progressed technically between films (if anything, Drillbit is technically even worse than Bad Karma with terrible sound and awful lighting) though as with the earlier film his everything-but-the-kitchen-sink approach is often fun if rather exhausting after a while. Some of the same non-actors who appeared in Bad Karma (Ben Befell, Bill Corbett, Neil Keenan) return here joined by equally talent-free newcomers though Chandon scored a coup of sorts by securing low-budget auteur Jim Van Bebber (director of Deadbeat at Dawn (1988)) to provide a narration to fill in some of the gaps though it does nothing to dispel the impression that Drillbit is really just a very long trailer.\n\nOnce again it’s really just a half-hour calling card for the admittedly impressive gore effects by Dominic Hailstone and Duncan Jarman. What Chandon lacked in budget Hailstone and Jarman more than made up for in quantity as crowd-pleasing head drillings, hideous arse-headed mutants and messy transformations rubbing bloody shoulders with more mundane but no less copious blood squibs and scar make-up effects. Hailstone would later go on to create the hideous eponymous creature for Matthew Holness’s brilliant Possum (2018)) while Jarman provided make-up effects for Resident Evil (2002), Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1 (2010), Overlord (2018) and TV mini-series Chernobyl (2019) among many others.\n\nDrillbit is a “bigger” film than Bad Karma (Chandon gets in more location work and the effects are more complex) but it’s not as a much fun. Chandon seems to have taken Drillbit rather more seriously and while there are plenty to enjoy (the monster that the hero mutates into is ridiculous but a lot of fun) it’s much more of a chore to sit through than his debut which at least gave the impression that it knew it was absurd and reveled in its own stupidity. Drillbit tries for something more ambitious – no bad thing but it doesn’t really work and outstays its welcome very quickly."
