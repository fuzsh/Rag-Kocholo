        "text": "Welcome to another Wildcard Wednesday! As previously teased, this month’s Pre-Code entry serves as the relaunch of our series on notable non-essentials, which will alternate randomly with the Essentials. These films, though not in possession of some of the qualities that might make them worthy of being called seminal representations of the genre, are nevertheless entertaining and worthy of our attention. Today we’re looking at…\n\nThe Guardsman (1931)\n\n“Following their performance of Elizabeth the Queen, the Actor (Lunt) and the Actress (Fontanne), who have been married for six months, take their bows while exchanging mild insults under their breath. The Actor’s jabs soon give way to jealous accusations of unfaithfulness, however, when he senses that his wife has already grown tired of him, her seventh husband, and is looking for her eighth. The Actor tells his friend, the critic Bernhardt (Young), that he believes that she has been unfaithful to him. Knowing that his wife is fond of men in uniform, the Actor decides to disguise himself as a uniformed Russian guardsman and try to woo her in order to prove to himself that she can be easily seduced. After sending her flowers, the Actor waits for his wife’s reaction, and then tries to get her to admit that she is courting a secret lover. Apparently fooled by her husband’s disguise, the Actress tosses him a note accepting his request for a meeting. Later, in order to induce his wife’s secret rendezvous with the Russian prince, the Actor tells her that he has been called away to play in Hamlet and will return the following day. That evening, after the Actor bids her farewell, the Actress immediately begins dressing to meet her paramour. When the Actor returns, disguised as the Soviet prince, he engages in a conversation with the Actress about her husband.\n\nCome back next week for another Wildcard Wednesday! And tune in on Tuesday for my thoughts on the best from the final season of Married… With Children!"
