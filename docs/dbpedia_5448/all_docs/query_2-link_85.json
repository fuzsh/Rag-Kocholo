        "text": "For those interested in film history, especially fans of vintage comedy, this release of all seventeen Hal Roach-produced two-reel shorts featuring Thelma Todd and ZaSu Pitts is cause for celebration.\n\nThelma Alice Todd was born in Lawrence, Massachusetts on July 29, 1906. Her initial aspiration to become a school teacher was disrupted by her entering beauty contests, resulting in her winning the title of Miss Massachusetts in 1925. Thelma found her way into movies, her flair for comedy eventually leading her to The Hal Roach studios. Thelma appeared in several Harry Langdon sound comedies, and also appeared in some movies with Charley Chase. She also appeared with Laurel and Hardy. Charley Chase asked Roach if the two of them could be a permanent screen team, but the producer had other plans.\n\nEliza Susan Pitts was born January 3, 1894 in Parsons, Kansas, but her family moved to Santa Cruz, California when she was nine years old. ZaSu Pitts became a stage and film actress, using her natural ability and mannerisms for both drama and comedy. Along with serious roles in films like King Vidor’s “Better Times” (1919), ZaSu also co-starred in a series of one reel comedies for Universal studios, replacing the recently departed Gale Henry opposite comedian Billy Franey.\n\nAs had happened for Thelma Todd, ZaSu’s natural flair for comedy led her to the Hal Roach studios where in 1931 Roach got the idea to create a female pair of slapstick comedians as a counterpart to his successful Laurel and Hardy films. Roach thought that pairing ZaSu Pitts with his other top comic actress Thelma Todd could create a female version of Laurel and Hardy, but not exactly with the same dynamic.\n\nTheir first film together was a three-reel comedy entitled “Let’s Do Things,” directed by Hal Roach himself. Their next, “Catch as Catch Can” was a two-reeler directed by Marshall Neilan. Unlike other comedy acts that have growing pains and need to explore and establish themselves in their first few films, Thelma and ZaSu’s comedies are funny right from the start. Critics said of “Let’s Do Things:\" \"Thelma Todd and ZaSu Pitts make a very clever team and I know film fans would enjoy seeing them together again. More joy and laughter, and less thought of the Depression.” “Catch as Catch Can” was called, “a good comedy with plenty of action and enough laughs to satisfy.”\n\nThelma and ZaSu investigate the pretentions of the rich in “Pajama Party,” explore military humor in “War Mamas,” are confronted by Laurel and Hardy doing a cameo at the conclusion of “On The Loose,” and take a shot at scare comedy with “Seal Skins.” Each of these two reelers show continuous improvement, as Thelma and ZaSu hone their formula and benefit from the great Roach gag men and supporting players like Charlie Hall and Billy Gilbert.\n\nOne of the points made in the advertising for this set is that these are pre-code productions that are more edgy and risqué than films after the 1934 code-enforcement would be. In fact, the ad copy calls them “sexy comedies.” This is especially evident in “Red Noses,” a wildly funny short that has Thelma and ZaSu being put through their paces at a health club. The line “girls, take off your clothes” is used as a direction several times. ZaSu sees a bulge sticking through a curtain that is obviously Thelma’s bottom. She gently pats it and says “is that you Thelma?” Thelma angrily responds, “now who else would it be?” A massage scene between Thelma and Amazonian Blanche Payson ends up with them wrestling and tussling on the floor. Meanwhile, heavy set Lyle Tayo is giving ZaSu a massage, stroking her arm, caressing her neck, even using a vibrator about her body.\n\n“Strictly Unreliable” is intriguing in that it plays like a ZaSu Pitts solo short with Thelma in support. “The Old Bull,” however, is purely a team effort – a rural comedy with a wild car chase and a loose lion. “Show Business” is significant for, among other things, being the only Roach short directed by Jules White, a couple years before he started his own short subject unit at Columbia. “Alum and Eve” is another one of the duo’s funniest, a hospital comedy directed by George Marshall. “The Soilers,” “Sneak Easily,” “Asleep in the Feet,” and “Maids a’la Mode” continue this stride and are among the funniest two reel comedies to be produced by the Roach studios.\n\nThelma and ZaSu had contracts with Roach that allowed them to work in films at other studios, so the ambitious actresses could pursue different kinds of roles. Thelma did heavy drama and zany comedy (including a couple of films with The Marx Brothers), while ZaSu, despite her continued off-screen friendship with Thelma, began to tire of the short film series. However, the films continued into 1933 with “The Bargain of the Century,” another of the girls’ best, directed by the great Charley Chase with whom Thelma had earlier co-starred in some top drawer short subjects.\n\nThe series concluded with “One Track Minds,” directed by Gus Meins. Meins might be the series’ best director of all, able to maintain the duo’s screen dynamic most effectively. ZaSu left the act, with Thelma’s blessing, and was replaced by Patsy Kelly. “One Track Minds” is a very funny short, featuring Spanky McFarland in a supporting role.\n\nThis wonderful DVD set was produced by Kit Parker films, who was also responsible for the great 1930-1931 Charley Chase sound Roach comedies released to DVD earlier this year.\n\nThe films used for the Todd-Pitts DVDs have been produced from the very best pre-print materials, and the special features include commentary tracks by such experts as Randy Skretvedt, Rob Farr, Richard Roberts, and Brent Walker. This makes the set as informative as it is entertaining.\n\nCertainly one of the most important DVD releases of the year, Thelma Todd and ZaSu Pitts: The Hal Roach Collection 1931-1933 should be included in any library or home collection that wants to be comprehensive. The films are consistently funny, clever comedies that are every bit as enjoyable in the 21st century as they had been when first released.\n\nThis highly recommended DVD set can be ordered for purchase at this link:\n\nThelma Todd and ZaSu Pitts: The Hal Roach Collection 1931-1933\n\nI have a book on these comedies coming out soon. It can be pre-ordered here:"
