        "text": "On the Loose is a welcomed addition to the series. More than before Thelma Todd and ZaSu Pitts actually feel like friends and have duo-things to do. There are still many scenes of them playing off of a man, which has been very common so far over these shorts. Their “duo scenes” are mainly in the beginning, with them having a conversation in their apartment. The supporting cast is also delightfully fun, with some familiar faces. The always memorable Billy Gilbert (who I’ve never otherwise seen credited as “William Gilbert”) plays a man at a clothes shop who can’t say the right thing. Charlie Hall once again is basically a background character and isn’t of many words, but leaves a mark with his facial expressions. There’s also Buddy McDonald, who is a child with a somewhat adult-looking face.\n\nZaSu gets a little more character, with her character being reserved to a fault. She comes off as a little sick of her date and putting up with people. That being said, she still doesn’t do as much as she could or should. Pitts is a great actress in her own right, but her performance is somewhat embarrassing, especially in comparison to Thelma Todd. Thelma has her character down way better, desiring more to keep the peace, but is somewhat prone to speaking her mind. It’s always great when she simply gives up on being polite in some way or another. Perhaps the writers knew this, because a lot of the gags and best lines went to Thelma. That being said, the best moment is when ZaSu and Thelma are in bed laughing at some of the men that have taken them to Coney Island. They both feel human to the point of you wondering if the scene was improvised. The only way you can laugh at and love this scene is if you can love the characters, which the girls manage with warm performances. It’s especially nice to see ZaSu open up a little, laughing and feeling comfortable in a situation.\n\nThe film starts with the girls getting home from a tiring date. It is amusing that it seems the girls just finished another misadventure offscreen, which I’d like to imagine could’ve been its own film. One very light character moment is when ZaSu takes off her shoes and rubs them, which calls back to her finding her shoes uncomfortable in Let’s Do Things and War Mamas. ZaSu also dumps the sand from the shoes directly on the carpet, with that never being acknowledged. Perhaps Pitts did it by accident and no one noticed it? It’s such an odd thing that one could easily miss. Later, ZaSu and Thelma’s arms are locked as they walk. That’s a subtle element to make them feel like friends. ZaSu and Thelma would apparently rather stay home, but put up with something they don’t like for social reasons. At the end, they were fine being home but seemed willing to go out with some men they just met. You can take from this that they’d rather stay home, but want to humor the men; they like going out either because they like to, for the purposes of being with men, or so they can get things like food and clothes that they don’t have to pay for. Admittedly, them expressing gratitude at being home only to right after seem interested in a date doesn’t really make sense.\n\nSPOILERS\n\nTo compare Thelma and ZaSu to Thelma and Patsy Kelly, while ZaSu and Thelma undress to their undergarments in the same room, they aren’t looking at each other, though they don’t seem too afraid of the prospect of the other seeing them. In-between a cut, they’re wearing bed clothes that cover a little more than before. Based on the nature of the cut, it seems it was a continuity error to have them in different outfits. A wipe transition would make sense as it would suggest they changed outfits between the cut. The two get in bed together and talk. To contrast with the Patsy-era, Thelma and Patsy don’t seem afraid to be in their undergarments with the other and see them. They also cuddle in bed, which ZaSu and Thelma aren’t shown to do.\n\nOne of the funniest gags is when Thelma fires the gun at a man who is about to reveal she’s been there before, with her shooting off his hat. Thelma is in a sense showing a stereotypically “masculine” trait by firing a gun so well and showing off her ability to, one-upping a moderately confident man she’s with. When she thinks a man is being unfairly treated, she tells off the guy about to punch him and then she punches him! She would have more moments like these later. As Thelma would also do later, she is shown to not be afraid of lying to people for money.\n\nMiscellaneous points include: The duo mention having boyfriends at the beginning, but then accept new dates later. Perhaps they are prone to ending relationships? This could explain why they’re always having different boyfriends. We should’ve gotten a short where there’s a montage of all the past boyfriends in this series taking the girls to Coney Island. I’d like to imagine the boyfriends referenced in the beginning of this short were boyfriends we’ve already seen. Another memorable character is ZaSu’s date, Claud Allister, who is very prone to smiling and being cheerful, despite the situation. When he accidentally falls beside another man’s girl, he has this lovable smile. He has such a smile when the man falls in his arms.\n\nThe gag of the cast being on a boat that then cuts to them submerged in water is an odd one. It’s really fast and out of the blue. Why would this even be a ride? If the ride malfunctioned, we never saw any scene to suggest such a thing. It’s nice that the wisecrack at the end of that scene is by ZaSu, not Thelma; as if her hatred of Coney Island has beat out her timid nature. The man that wanted to punch out ZaSu’s date is very prone to violence when it appears he’s threatening him being with his date. Violence being a go-to for Hal Roach characters shows up everywhere! This character has a little more restraint by letting him go the first two times. Finally, one gag shows a stunt person in place of Thelma. It seems Thelma’s stunt person is a man.\n\nLaurel and Hardy manage to be very pronounced and memorable in their very minimal roles and screen time, even down to little things like Hardy directing Laurel to remove his hat. You could imagine a movie where they were wandering around and trying to find dates and then found Thelma and ZaSu’s apartment. The last scene of the film features the girls being the ones giving them fuel to be comedic. If the movie wanted to focus on Thelma and ZaSu until the last frame, you could have it so after they’re invited to Coney Island, we never move away from them throwing things at the male duo. That probably would’ve happened if instead of Laurel and Hardy it was two nobodies. This is not a complaint as it’s not like Thelma and ZaSu need every frame to themselves.\n\nOVERVIEW"
