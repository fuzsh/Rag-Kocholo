        "text": "ZaSu Pitts (subject)\n\nN.p. N.p. Three vintage photographs of actress ZaSu Pitts at different periods of her career, silent era Universal photograph, circa 1925, early talkie period, circa 1935 and a later photograph circa 1950.\n\nZaSu Pitts, born Eliza Susan Pitts, began working in Hollywood in the late teens and starred in her first feature length film, King Vidor's \"Better Times,\" in 1919. By the mid 1920s Pitts was a well established comic actor. In a surprising casting choice Erich von Stroheim chose Pitts for the tragic role of Trina Sieppe in his 1924 epic \"Greed,\" after which von Stroheim called Pitts \"the greatest dramatic actress.\" Through the 1930s Pitts starred in many comedy shorts, teamed with Thelma Todd, starred in many B pictures and supporting roles in feature productions. After the advent of sound Pitts was largely relegated to comedy roles. In the 1940s Pitts was a popular radio star working with the likes of Bing Crosby, Al Jolson, W.C. Fields and others. In 1944 Pitts appeared on Broadway in the popular mystery production \"Ramshackle Inn\" which was written expressly for her and which was later taken on the road. By the 1950s she focused her work largely on television playing comic support to Gale Storm in CBs' 1956 \"The Gale Storm Show\" and made appearances on other popular shows such as ABC's \"Guestward, Ho!\" (1961) and CBs' \"Perry Mason\" (1962). Pitts' final performance was as Gertie, the switchboard operator in Stanley Kramer's 1963 \"It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World.\"\n\n8 x 10 inches. Very Good, overall. Earliest photograph has margin trim on right and some residue on lower half. Mid career photograph has a small closed tear and light bruise. Later career photograph light creasing and light dampstain in top margin.\n\n[Book #146576]"
