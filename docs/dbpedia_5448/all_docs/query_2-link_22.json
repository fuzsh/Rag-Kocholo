        "text": "(1894–1963). American comedic motion picture actress ZaSu Pitts was famous for her caricature-like big eyes, flailing hand movements, and twittery voice. She appeared in such classic films as director Erich von Stroheim’s Greed (1924), Ruggles of Redgap (1935), and Life with Father (1947). She also appeared in a series of comedy shorts with Thelma Todd during the early 1930s.\n\nEliza Susan Pitts was born on January 3, 1894, in Parsons, Kansas. Her family moved to Santa Cruz, California, when Pitts was nine years old. When Mary Pickford traveled to northern California to shoot Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm in 1917, Pitts was hired as an extra. Pickford selected Pitts to appear with her in The Little Princess (1917).\n\nPitts rose to prominence during the 1920s in both comedies and dramas, but her squeaky voice made it difficult for her to be taken seriously in the era of the talkies. Her voice was supposedly the inspiration for the cartoon character Olive Oyl in the Popeye cartoon series. Pitts appeared in numerous comedy films in the 1930s and ’40s, but they were mostly low-budget affairs."
