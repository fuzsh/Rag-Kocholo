        "text": "One of the most famous female double acts of all time, put together by Hal Roach as the ‘female counterpart to Laurel and Hardy’, their formidable work still holding up to this day. ZaSu Pitts was a legend of the silent screen, her career spanning nearly 50 years, whilst Thelma Todd was the typical Hollywood blonde bombshell, a phenomenal actress whose career was cut tragically short. What brought Thelma, one of the brightest stars of the early days of Hollywood, and ZaSu, a renowned character actress and comedienne, together? This is the remarkable tale of comedy, tragedy, elation, scandal and… murder.\n\nThe Perfect Star\n\nZaSu Pitts (ZAZ-oo) was born Eliza Susan Pitts on January 3rd, 1894 in Parsons, Kansas, to Rulandus and Nelly, the third of four children. ZaSu was just five years of age when her father died and her mother decided to move the family to Santa Cruz on the Californian coast. There, they ran a boarding house, but money was always a problem. Like so many girls in those days, when ZaSu was a teenager, she decided to leave home to try her luck in the movies.\n\nShe found a few small roles, but it was when she was cast as an extra in Mary Pickford’s ‘Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm’ that transformed ZaSu’s fortunes. She followed the production company back to Los Angeles. There, a young man from a casting office one day called Frances Marion to tell her that he was bringing over a ‘maiden fairer than Aphrodite’ for her consideration. That ‘maiden’ was ZaSu. She was thin. Awkward. Her eyes enormous. France’s first thought? She is like a trapped little animal. But the man from the casting office insisted. “Beauty like this should not go unnoticed.” Frances threw him out, and scolded ZaSu, telling her to pay no attention to men like him. She was crying.\n\n“Tell me about yourself,” Frances asked ZaSu. She was trying to make her a bit more comfortable; she was ever so nervous. She spoke of her childhood in Kansas and the move to Santa Cruz. She had found some work with Universal but little luck elsewhere. Frances did not know whether to laugh or cry at the tale of woe spun as the most delicate of yarns. Frances told ZaSu that the audiences out there would love her just as she was. And there was a role in an upcoming picture, A Little Princess, starring Mary Pickford, that Frances thought ZaSu would be perfect for. Mary was so touched by ZaSu’s story she was more than happy to have ZaSu in her picture. Mary Pickford, a revered legend of Hollywood, was frightfully protective of young stars. She was their protector.\n\nZaSu’s dramatic scenes were wonderful. And Mary knew it. ZaSu dominated the scenes she was in. Those around her dubbed her ‘marvellous’. They were convinced audiences would flock to see ZaSu and talk about her. That she would sell tickets by the barrel load. And in 1917, ZaSu made her most substantial splash yet: A Little Princess.\n\nFrom there, her popularity would blossom…\n\nThe Hot Toddy\n\nThelma Alice Todd was born on July 29th, 1906. This is Lawrence, Massachusetts. Her parents were John and Alice. Thelma was bright and successful. Her intentions as a child to become a schoolteacher. But in 1923, she began entering beauty pageants and in 1925, she won the title of ‘Miss Massachusetts’. It was there where Hollywood talent first spotted her, a film scout asking her to travel with him back to Hollywood. He wanted to sign her up to a contract with Paramount. Thoughts of being a schoolteacher were long behind her.\n\nThelma had gone far in her attempts to become a schoolteacher, even attending university, but now she sought a more glamorous career. She looked up to actresses like ZaSu, who had come from humble origins to make something of themselves. ZaSu was a rising star in Hollywood and by 1922, her career was starting to take off. She was a star of comedy, earning her first feature-length lead in ‘King Vidor’s Better Times’(1919). But she had hidden talents as a dramatic actress. Hollywood was shocked when ZaSu was cast in a tragic role in Erich von Stroheim’s ‘Greed’ (1924), a 239 minute long epic masterpiece. It showed that ZaSu could draw tears with her doleful demeanour, as well as eliciting laughs. The movie was a failure at the time but is now regarded as one of the greatest movies ever made. Erich dubbed ZaSu ‘the greatest dramatic actress’.\n\nThe public did not take ZaSu’s dramatic roles so seriously as she was typecast in comedic roles, her dramatic performances, albeit brilliant, drawing laughs from audiences assuming her pictures were always comedies. Thelma’s career mirrored that of ZaSu. She too had drawn the eye of Hollywood’s casting scouts, her talents praised, although studio bosses often told her to watch her weight…\n\nBy 1929, Thelma’s popularity as a great comedic actress was secured. She was often labelled as a ‘gorgeous blonde’. She had starred with the Marx Brothers in ‘Horse Feathers’ and ‘Monkey Business’, along with a long line of hugely successful comedies. She was an incredibly talented actress and Hollywood took advantage of that. In her short career, she would feature in over 120 pictures, although she was always best known for her work alongside the Marx Brothers and Buster Keaton. She earned the nicknames, ‘Ice Cream Blonde’ and ‘Hot Toddy’. By 1930, ZaSu and Thelma were two of the most popular stars in Hollywood, Thelma in particular noted for her meteoric rise to stardom.\n\nZaSu enjoyed her greatest success in the 1930s, often starring in B movies and comedy short films. It wasn’t long before she started to appear on screen alongside Thelma, the two becoming good friends. It’s hard to imagine today, but ZaSu and Thelma appearing onscreen to together was like the Avengers assembling. They were heavyweights of comedy. Audiences flocked to see them together, often in pictures by Hal Roach.\n\nBoth stars were instantly recognisable. And so when a new comedy proposition came about, it was inevitable that ZaSu and Thelma would be the first choice…\n\nPitts & Todd\n\nDuring these days of the silent film, Thelma was often utilised for her beauty but rarely her acting prowess, of which was plentiful. Hal Roach cottoned on to this and with the advent of the talkies, he wanted to utilise her skills more and more. She often appeared alongside Charley Chase and Harry Langdon, and, of course, Laurel and Hardy.\n\nIn 1931, Hal cast ZaSu in her own series of 17 to 27 minute slapstick comedy shorts but he harboured grander ambitions. He wanted to create a ‘female’ Laurel and Hardy and he knew exactly who he wanted in the roles: Pitts & Todd. He was, after all, the man behind Laurel and Hardy, who directed many of their most famous pictures.\n\nHal believed Thelma and ZaSu were born to play the role of the comedy double act. It followed the tried and tested comedy route: Thelma would play the adorable working girl trying to retain her poise, whilst ZaSu would often drag her friend into her zany shenanigans. The duo would work together for 17 short films, sometimes featuring Laurel and Hardy, such as 1931’s ‘On the Loose’. They would stay together for a brief but wonderful three years, leaving behind a memorable body of work.\n\nThe contrast between Thelma and ZaSu was nothing to do with looks, refreshing for two women often defined by such, but more about character. Thelma was brash and confident, whilst ZaSu was shyer and more dithery. Film critic Molly Haskell once said of Pitts & Todd:\n\nThey have gumption; they’re unflappable. They’re looking out for each other; you could just feel the value of the twosome… they are modern women. Hopefully, they will rise to the top – but in the meantime, they’re just going to wing it and figure things out.\n\nTheir electric dynamic was established instantly. Their first short, ‘Let’s Do Things’, has Thelma and ZaSu promoting sheet music sales in a department store. ZaSu swoons over her boyfriend but Thelma, disapproving, prompts her friend to remember why the two came to New York. “To advance ourselves,” she says. “To meet the best people, and to do big things,” ZaSu responds. At the end of the short, Thelma pies ZaSu’s boyfriend. They were having the time of their lives. They had each other’s backs and never fought over a man.\n\nThey were also game for the more physical aspect of being a comedy duo. In ‘Let’s Do Things’, Thelma is strangled by a phony doctor, whilst in ‘Sneak Easily’, there is a courtroom scene in which ZaSu, a juror, throws a murder trial into chaos when she swallows a piece of the evidence: an explosive. Their best work is filled with mayhem. It was, effectively, a proto-sitcom. They were at the top of their game, but Thelma’s private life had hit rock bottom.\n\nLittle did anyone then know what was about to happen.\n\nThe Downfall\n\nThere is no doubt that Thelma’s troubles started with her abusive relationship with one of her former producers. Their relationship was tumultuous. She once ended up in a hospital after he beat her in a drunken brawl. Thelma’s addictions only started when the men in her life failed her. She drank to cope. Many today lambast her for her vices, but none of them were her fault.\n\nShe divorced the producer in 1934 and opened a café along the Pacific Coast Highway named, ‘Thelma Todd’s Sidewalk Café’. Well, it’s straight to the point. She purchased the property with her new boyfriend, Roland West, a famous director. The café became a famous hangout for Hollywood’s elite, a glitzy and glamorous hotspot overlooking the Pacific Ocean, a watering hole for the glitterati, politicians and gangsters of Hollywood.\n\nThelma was a bankable asset… it is impossible today to state just how famous and talented she was. She was shocked in 1933 to learn of ZaSu’s intention to leave the double act. It had worked out so well but ZaSu had her heart on other endeavours. Patsy Kelly was brought in as Thelma’s new partner, together filming 21 more short films. Thelma went on to star in ‘The Bohemian Girl’, a Laurel and Hardy comedy, in 1935. It was to be her final film role.\n\nDecember 16th, 1935. Thelma Todd was found dead. She was just 29-years-old. She was found in her car. She was in the garage of Jewel Carmen, a former actress and Roland’s ex-wife. Her passing was ruled death by carbon monoxide poisoning. It is said that Thelma and Roland had had an argument and he locked her out, causing her to seek refuge in the warmth of her car. But was it an accident? Or was it suicide?\n\nHer friends stated that the night previously, she had been in good spirits, despite an argument with one of her exes. Nobody could quite believe that Thelma would kill herself. What reason did she have? The LAPD ruled her death accidental, presumably warming up the car to keep herself warm on what was a very cold night. But a coroner’s inquest into her death shed a horrifying prospect. Autopsy surgeon AP Wagner testified that there were ‘no marks of violence upon or within the body’, but we know this is not true and that there were signs of injury and struggle on her body. It is unclear why he would omit such findings to the jury, who ruled her death ‘accidental’ but warranted ‘further investigation’. A grand jury was convened to determine a frightening new possibility.\n\nWas Thelma murdered?\n\nThe Truth\n\nAfter four weeks of testimony, the jury concluded that there was no evidence of foul play. The Homicide Bureau declared the death ‘accidental with possible suicidal tendencies’. However, other investigators disagreed. There was no evidence of suicide and she left no suicide note. The picture was incredibly complicated. Thelma was so happy the night before. She said herself that she had had a ‘wonderful evening’. But she had also had a huge argument with her ex and her current husband that night. She left the party that night saying it was ‘wonderful’ but she was humiliated and embarrassed. There was also an altercation. She got drunk and admitted to one of her friends that she was having an affair.\n\nRoland did not go to the party. Thelma rang Sid Grauman to tell him to tell Roland that she would be home soon, but that was at 1am. She did not arrive at home until 3am. The last person to see her alive was her driver. He said that Thelma was unusually quiet. There is no doubt that Thelma was not suicidal. But it needn’t matter. Within hours, photos of her dead body were splashed all over America’s celebrity magazines, the paparazzi at the scene before the police. ‘Star Kills Herself’. That was all they cared about. Sensation.\n\nAll Thelma had ever wanted was to be an actress. She was not forced into it, as some wrongly claim. She was loved by her family and supported in every decision she took. She was happy, so happy. She only drank because of the abusive men in her life. She was not a victim. But a survivor of the hell around her. She was nothing but innocent. Her restaurant meant a lot to her. It gave her a new sense of freedom. She was beautiful, independent and had a life ahead of her, a future she was so excited by. She was not a bad person. And those who say she is are part of the problem. Thelma’s legacy has been tarnished by those committed to prolonging the tale of the forlorn, broken and fallen star of Hollywood, the ‘tale as old as time’. But she was anything but.\n\nSuicide made no sense. Her nose was broken. She had bruises around her throat. Two of her ribs were cracked. Some speculated that Thelma beat herself to death. But it didn’t add up. The restaurant she built from the ground up would provide financial stability. She didn’t mind getting old or going grey. She knew the life of a Hollywood star was a short-lived one and she was preparing for her future. But she was gone.\n\nShe was drunk. Her blood contained lethal levels of carbon monoxide. But the injuries she suffered cannot be ignored. Was it murder? Was it suicide? Was it an accident? To this day, nobody knows. Whatever the exact circumstances of her death, it traumatised ZaSu deeply. She never recovered from the passing of one of her closest friends.\n\nShe carried the loss with her for the rest of her life.\n\nAfter Thelma\n\nZaSu had to carry on, despite the immense sadness she felt. She tackled Broadway, making her debut in the mystery ‘Ramshackle Inn’ in 1944, the part written for ZaSu and it did well. The show went on the road for many years. In fact, ZaSu became a regular of the stage over the years after Thelma’s death. She could never really escape her comedic typecasting, but in the 1950s, she started to focus her attention on television, culminating in her best-known series role, playing second fiddle to Gale Storm in CBS’s ‘The Gale Storm Show’ (1956). She was also cast opposite Earle Hodgins in the episode ‘Lonesome’s Gal’ of ABC’s ‘Guestward, Ho!’, whilst in 1962, she appeared in an episode of CBS’s ‘Perry Mason’. Her final role was as Gertie, the switchboard operator in, ‘It’s a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World’ (1963).\n\nZaSu had left Hal Roach behind in the 1930s, leading to Patsy Kelly becoming Thelma’s new partner. Patsy and Thelma filmed 21 shorts together until Thelma’s untimely death. Patsy was then paired with Pert Kelton for one short, then Lyda Roberti for two shorts and one feature film. Lyda, with a history of heart trouble, died in 1938 at the age of 31, dying of a heart attack triggered when she bent over to tie her shoelace. And in 1941, ZaSu joined Patsy, making their only appearance together in the film, ‘Broadway Limited’. ZaSu had come full circle with the comedy act. She started it, she ended it. It was fitting, in a way, but never the same without Thelma.\n\nZaSu found herself embroiled in another mystery in 1947. Madge Meredith, a talented young actress, was found guilty of orchestrating the beating, robbery and kidnapping of Nick Gianaclis and Verne Davis. It was not true. Nick and Verne had staged the alleged crime by inflicting the injuries on each other to get revenge against Madge. She was arrested and sentenced to five years in jail.\n\nZaSu had been following the case closely but she doubted Madge’s guilt. She visited Madge in prison bringing with her toiletries as a gift. She was convinced Madge was the victim of a terrible miscarriage of justice. She contacted a lawyer, Madge unable to afford a good one, who worked diligently to clear Madge’s name. In 1954, almost five years after she was found guilty, Madge’s sentence was commuted to time served. She was released from prison. Nick and Verne never faced charges. And Madge and ZaSu became close friends. We only lost Madge in 2017. She was 96-years-old. But I guess it helps living in Hawaii.\n\nMadge owed so much to ZaSu, perhaps as much as Thelma, or perhaps as much as Thelma owed ZaSu. Their lives were all intrinsically linked. But in ZaSu’s later life, she was plagued by health issues, particularly after she was diagnosed with cancer in the mid-1950s. She worked for as long as she could, becoming a familiar and beloved character actress on the small screen. Later, she quietly withdrew from public life and often lied to her friends and family about recovering from cancer. Frances Marion said of the ageing ZaSu:\n\nWe often talked over the telephone. Poor darling, she was so hopeful and convinced that she was entirely cured. But our mutual friend, Dr Terwilliger, told me that… he was not a miracle worker… [and] was worried because ZaSu took such little care of herself. Her eagerness to make money… drove her to destructive lengths… toward the last she was in agony… [but] carried on in true dramatic style.\n\nZaSu drove herself too hard. The pressures of her work, of which she would not relent from, drove her, like Thelma, to excess. Drinking was the only way she could cope but toward the end of her life, the things she said and did were not really her anymore. Not the true ZaSu. Like Thelma, she was a victim of Hollywood and fame. Yet another starlet brought down by the very world that made her name. ZaSu died on June 7th, 1963 at the age of 69.\n\nWith that, Pitts & Todd were gone.\n\nThe Greatest Show\n\nZaSu Pitts was a renowned character actress, working consistently throughout her long career. She endeared herself to her audiences with her eccentricities but she was a complicated person, infected by Hollywood and the dazzle of fame. Who she was and what became of her was not who she was but who Hollywood made her. It is what connected her to Thelma, what made them so good together. They were the same in many ways.\n\nZaSu, most importantly, should be remembered as a talented actress and comedienne, above all else, that’s what truly matters. She, like Thelma, was a good person poisoned by the affectations of showbusiness, like so many other actresses, their health and wellbeing of little regard to others. She deserves her star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, as does Thelma Todd.\n\nShe had conquered Hollywood by the time of her untimely death at just 29-years-old. Was she murdered? Did she kill herself? Was it an accident? Murder seems most likely but the list of suspects is endless and the mystery destined never to be solved. Her ex-husband, her current husband with potential ties to the mafia, the jealous Jewel Carmen, perhaps, or even her lover, who was a known gangster. She definitely did not kill herself, that was not Thelma. But her end overshadowed the great work she did, much like with ZaSu.\n\nThe two shared difficult and complex characteristics. Many are quick to lambast these two people, left broken and agitated, but they were good people, only left complicated by their circumstances. There is no doubt that in Thelma, Hollywood lost a legend far too soon. Perhaps known best for her beauty, but in truth, known for her exceptional talents. She is a Hollywood legend, much like ZaSu, the two immortalised with their stars.\n\nBoth have now been completely forgotten, but both mattered. They meant so much for Hollywood and for how far women could go. To this day, their work still packs a punch. They were not a ‘female’ Laurel and Hardy, they were their own people, the first truly successful female double act. Their gender made them revolutionary, for the day, but their talent was undeniable. That is how they should be remembered. Anything else is throwing mud for the sake of sensationalism. Film critic Molly Haskell said of Pitts & Todd:\n\nSlapstick was what men loved, and women didn’t because the whole core of it was tearing things up. It was chaotic and women wanted order. The defence of the domestic was a ‘woman’s’ role… and slapstick violated the sense of order and decency and uprightness. They didn’t find it funny.\n\nThe proof of their talent lays in their work. 90 years ago, they smashed expectations and achieved a level of fame unparalleled today. It was their chemistry, their unbreakable friendship, that was their appeal that elevated them above all others. The dream ended in 1933. But their legacy is immortal and immeasurable. The end does not matter. Is it the life they lived that does.\n\nAnd what a life they lived.\n\nI cannot tell a lie: the shorts are not all good. The gag men had a hard time coming up with suitable material that wouldn’t defeminise them or make them look outlandishly unladylike, but [Pitts & Todd] play well today because [the characters] aren’t so different from two young women trying to make their way in the world [today]. The struggles they have by and large tend not to be sexist. If they lose a job, they are comically inept, or it’s a blown opportunity.\n\n– Leonard Maltin (author).\n\nToodle-Pip :}{:\n\nPost LO: Comments, Likes & Follows Greatly Appreciated :)\n\nImages (click on them to enlarge): 1) ZaSu Pitts, 2) Thelma Todd, 3) Pitts & Todd - I love this photo.
