        "text": "The Mayfair's screen attraction, \"They Just Had to Get Married,\" is a popular type of comedy which succeeded, in stirring up a good deal of loud laughter at its first showing. The main idea may not be especially novel, but it has possibilities which have scarcely been, touched in the stereotyped tactics of the producers. With a certain degree of subtlety it might have been really effective, but as it is slapstick prevails and wit is left out in the cold. Then, too, Edward Ludwig, the director, prolongs the boisterous sequences until they end in being more tedious than humorous.This film has the advantage of good acting. Zasu Pitts assuredly makes the most of her role and her partner, Slim Summerville, who has the good sense to look serious in farcical plights, gives a steady performance. C. Aubrey Smith and Roland Young contribute good work, but unfortunately they do not have the opportunity to bring the feature up to a higher level.The early episodes lead one to anticipate something clever. There are the relatives of the late Henry Davidson gathered together to hear the reading of his will. All of them have expectations of being mentioned in the testament, and several are confident that the lion's share of the estate will go to them. It is then a sorry disappointment to these persons when to their utter dismay they hear that Uncle Henry has bequeathed everything to two faithful servants, Sam Sutton and Molly Hull. Nobody is more surprised than Sam and Molly to hear this, especially as they thought they soon might be among the army of unemployed.They decide that as there is nothing more to worry about they will get married. Mr. Ludwig does not put in anything very new in the marriage episode, but some of the scenes are moderately amusing because they are well acted. Now that they are rich, Sam and Molly entertain and go horseback riding.It is during the equestrian interlude that there is quite a fair share of mirth, for neither Molly nor her husband appears to have the faintest idea about saddles or horses. Molly thinks that a few kind words and a pat or two will make the horse behave, and Sam thinks only of hanging on, which he does so well that one suspects him of knowing more about horses than he admits. Whether they ever attempt riding again after this first experience is not known, for the film proceeds to take up other matters, including a temporary separation between Sam and Molly.A pair of silk stockings causes Sam no end of trouble and Molly a great deal of chagrin. Then Sam goes in for gambling and winds up with losing his share of the fortune, which forces him to accept a job as a waiter. Somehow or other, it is not really surprising when Molly enters the restaurant where her ex-husband is serving, and neither is the declaration of peace and the happy ending.\n\nTHEY JUST HAD TO GET MARRIED, an adaptation of a play by Cyril Harcourt; directed by Edward Ludwig; a Universal production.

Henry ArmettaAlthough \"Child of Manhattan,\" based on the Preston Sturges play, is a title with dash and spirit, the new picture at the RKO Roxy has nothing new to report on the whirligjg of metropolitan life. Nancy Carroll invests her role with flashes of good acting, but her performance is an individual triumph in a tiresome and routine film.Describing Madeleine McGonegal's progress from taxi-dancing in \"Loveland\" to the luxury of the Vanderkill ermine, it is occasionally hard to follow because of its unique representation of human psychology. Madeleine's romance with Paul Vanderkill appears to be getting on famously until the revelation that she is going to become a mother. Vanderkill then marries her, and the baby dies. The frantic girl, believing that the wedding was only a generous gesture on her lover's part, runs off to Mexico for a divorce. Her Mexican lawyer, without her knowledge, wrangles a handsome alimony settlement out of Vanderkill, who thereupon permits himself to be convinced that the little dancer loved him only for his money. To avoid the necessity for taking Vanderkill's alimony, Madeleine decides to marry a quaint young rustic named Panama Kelly. Paul arrives in time to claim the girl for his own.Buck Jones, who is a more convincing actor fighting Indians and horse thieves than as the third person in a domestic triangle, plays the part of Panama without great subtlety. As the scion of wealth, John Boles wears evening clothes faultlessly, but never seems quite prepared to die for the sake of love.\n\nLove and Sorrow.CHILD OF MANHATTAN, an adaptation of Preston Sturges's play of the same name; directed by Eddie Buzzell; a Columbia production.

Tyler BrookeLouise . . . . . Betty KendallOn the Stage.The stage show runs mainly to music and the dance. The most interesting feature is a choral arrangement of Gounod's \"O Divine Redeemer,\" with Viola Philo and the Roxy singers, in a religious setting of dignity and quiet beauty. John Pierce is the vocal soloist in a rendition of \"Hey Young Fella\" by the orchestra.For humor there is Nell Kelly of the vaudeville stage, who has an active and amusing style of singing the popular tunes.After considerable delay another silent film of life in the Soviet Union directed by V. Pudovkin, one of the three outstanding directors of the new Russia, has reached New York for the instruction and entertainment of persons interested in a more or less symbolic picturization of how both the older and younger generations are adjusting themselves to the radical changes arising from the revolutions of 1917. This picture, which is called \"Life is Beautiful,\" and which began to run at the Acme Theatre yesterday, starts with a sort of prologue showing the reunion of veteran, of the civil war between the Red Army and the White Guards with his wile (A. Tchakulayeva) and young son and with the one-time commissar (A. Baturin) attached to his old command.Then, in a series of flashbacks, the audience receives a graphic description of incidents of the civil war and of the temporary infatuation of the dashing commissar with a gay young woman (M. Belusova) who has caught his fancy just when his loyal wife (E. Rogulina) is leaving for a visit to her country after having nursed him back to health. In the end the commissar discards his \"second wife\" and is welcomed back by the woman whose sterling qualities he now appreciates. It is possible that this little romance has been introduced to epitomize the thoughtlessness with which some of the Soviet leaders changed wives during the first period of matrimonial freedom and which drew reproof from Nikolai Lenin himself.But the story in itself is of no great importance. What grips the spectators is the skill with which Pudovkin sketches not merely the struggle on the field of battle, but also the mental difficulties encountered by soldiers turned civic reconstructionists. Every now and then when things look dark \"Life Is Beautiful\" is flashed on the screen as if to assure the protagonists that life is well worth living after all. The photography and direction are up to the high standard set by the best Russian film makers. The English captions are few, but well chosen. A reel showing nature's cycle of life, death and rebirth is especially interesting. All the actors are excellent."
