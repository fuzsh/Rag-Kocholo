        "text": "The Pajama Party is the most cohesive ZaSu and Thelma short so far. It bothers to stay focused on our duo and let them be funny. The bundle of gags are a good bunch, so it’s a delightful film to watch. It has the same opening as their first short, with a group of men singing to Thelma and her enjoying it. The lead singer is her boyfriend, who she is making eye contact with. It’s a shame the theme tune of the shorts wasn’t deviated from more often. This also harkens back to a character point of the first film, men gravitating towards Thelma. Admittedly, here they are rehearsing their vocals for their job, not singing to her for no reason, the latter being the reason in Let’s Do Things. It still is interesting that here they are by her perhaps unintentionally.\n\nZaSu is funny and gets more to do. We see her reaction to an attempt to fit into a new environment, but bizarrely, she acts as if she was an alien with no idea what she’s doing, coming off like she’s never met a human before. That all being said, Pitts is light on moments that tell you about what’s going on in her character’s head. While some of her actions are based on her doing her best to fit in, some of the specific things she does are odd. She doesn’t feel very realistic as Pitts doesn’t seem to know how her character should take situations, unlike Todd who is very in tune with her role.\n\nThelma delights in being part of upper class society, while ZaSu doesn’t. The latter apparently would rather be near what’s familiar. Thelma on the other hand has a degree of desperation in how much she wants to ascend the social ladder. When she slips and falls in a bathtub fully clothed, she acts like it was intentional and starts washing herself. This sort of dynamic would appear in the Patsy era. Just like ZaSu, Thelma as well can seem like a fish out of water. While this is a place they aren’t familiar with, they’re still dealing with just people. Just act like a normal person! As an aside, while Thelma washing herself doesn’t “show anything off”, I wonder if the intention was for it to be more sexual. Her clothes are pretty thick, but there are points where her curves are apparent.\n\nThe girls’ boyfriends are the most prominent characters here other than the leads. They don’t get a ton of screen time, but they get enough that the film would play better if they were funny. Humor is generally absent from their relatively serious plot and thus the film is too slow here. The bit players are generally sharp with their very minor roles, especially Charlie Hall, who appears in several of these shorts. A lot of these old films have a way of finding interesting faces to play roles like this. Hall has some fun interactions with Pitts. Thelma and ZaSu are sadly light on interactions, so these minor actors are appreciated. Maybe the reason they have different boyfriends every time is so they can be interacting off of a new guy each film? The fact that the duo have had different boyfriends each film suggests that their strangeness isn’t able to keep them in relationships. While some of the dynamics and performers are funny, it sometimes seems like the boyfriends are being forced in. Here they are particularly weak.\n\nSPOILERS\n\nThe film loses its own story for a little, not being about the girls’ plot related to their boyfriends after the first few minutes. It’s played as silly for doing this, shown by how unfamiliar the new environment is made to be, like something more interesting was found. The original plot does ultimately come back around, though. It’s a fun twist to have us think the movie would never return here, especially because exploring this party is a better story. It still ultimately is necessary to finish what was started. This is reminiscent of The Three Stooges, who sometimes literally would not return to a plot point after it is moved on from. Here, the writers are more careful with their Chekhov’s guns.\n\nSome miscellaneous moments include our heroes obviously not being wet after falling in a lake. ZaSu is uncomfortable with a maid trying to take her clothes off, but Thelma doesn’t seem to mind the treatment. The maid laughs at ZaSu’s underwear, though is wearing the same kind. Why she’d do so, who knows? ZaSu is called unladylike at one point. This furthermore emphasizes the duo not belonging. Despite the odd ways the partygoers can act, they conform to social expectations of the time for them and mind someone who isn’t, even if it’s in minimal ways. ZaSu at the end pushes the woman who invited her into the pool for the sake of being a final joke. We should’ve had something like ZaSu having an issue with her earlier, so this has an actual place instead of coming from nowhere.\n\nThelma seems excited for this opportunity to involve herself in a party that appears to be filled with wealthy people. While a little unnatural at fitting in, she seems willing to accept how they are for the purpose of wanting to seem like she belongs. When Thelma’s boyfriend is upset with her for apparently lying about where she would be at that time, she lessens her ruse. For starters, despite her constant portrayal of confidence, an example being when she acts like she knows how to fit in when talking to ZaSu, Thelma can’t just tell her boyfriend why she’s there. She also doesn’t have the “confidence” to just be herself from square one. She later punches men that want to show her around (while the reason isn’t really clear, it’s seemingly because either they’re trying to get fresh with her or she doesn’t want to look away from her boyfriend) and thus is asked to leave the party. Seeing as her intentions were to fit in, it’s interesting to see her somewhat mindlessly destroy that. When she’s not really trying to fit in, she seems more confident. She doesn’t want men bothering her, so she’ll punch them out the way. Thelma follows the Hal Roach rule of being violent to solve a confrontation.\n\nAs an aside, Thelma gracefully leaves with the men wanting to show her around, while not looking away from her boyfriend as much as possible. This suggests she’s only going with them to make him jealous and will return to him as soon as possible. When she returns to watching her boyfriend, she looks annoyed, perhaps as if she was just groped by them? Why would she seem annoyed otherwise?\n\nOVERVIEW"
