        "text": "Most often remembered for her gestures, expressive eyes, and body language on the screen, ZaSu Pitts was an unusual actress (and also an excellent cook: she often gave homemade candies to her coworkers, and her collection of candy recipes was published posthumously).\n\nThis affectionate study of both her private life off-screen and her public persona details how the multi-talented actress become one of filmdomâ€™s favorite comediennes and character players. The book includes many rare photographs."
