Zasu Pitts was a silent-screen veteran with over 100 film credits to her name before she was paired with co-star Thelma Todd in 1931 at the age of 37. Thelma Todd, twelve years younger than Pitts, was a rising star at the Hal Roach Studios, having been paired with Charley Chase in a short-lived series of shorts in 1930 as well as having appeared alongside Laurel and Hardy and Max Davidson.

Together, Pitts and Todd notched up a total of 17 films over a two year period whilst working for Hal Roach. However, in 1933 unsuccessful contract negotiations led to Zasu Pitts being released from the series and a new co-star was sought for Thelma Todd.
