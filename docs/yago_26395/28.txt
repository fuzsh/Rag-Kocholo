Biography[]

Born in New York City to actor Robert Alda, he studied at Fordham University and began to act on stage as well as part of several comedy revues. This soon led to a number of stage roles on Broadway and a Tony Award nomination for The Apple Tree. He made his screen debut in 1963 and gained his greatest recognition from 1972 portraying "Hawkeye" in the long-running series M*A*S*H, for which he also directed a number of episodes.

Alda also wrote and directed a number of films such as The Four Seasons, and later became an activist for womens' rights. He received an Emmy Award for his role on The West Wing, and an Academy Award nomination for playing the antagonistic Senator Brewster in The Aviator.

Singing[]

Alda, like his father, alternated between singing on stage and on screen, originating roles in the musicals Cafe Crown and The Apple Tree respectively. During his time on M*A*S*H, he sang on numerous occasions (often altering the lyrics for comic effect), including such numbers as "Smoke Gets in Your Eyes", "Oh, What a Beautiful Mornin'" and "You're the Top".
