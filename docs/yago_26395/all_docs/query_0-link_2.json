Old friend Nick (Len Cariou) surprises everyone when he arrives not with his wife, Anne (Sandy Dennis), but with his new girlfriend, the much younger Ginny (Bess Armstrong). The group -- all of which had grown to be good friends with Anne -- must come to terms with this unexpected development. Ultimately, they learn to accept Nick's decision, and work to welcome Ginny as a friend.",
