        "text": "1958–1971: Broadway debut and early work\n\nedit\n\nAlda began his career in the 1950s as a member of the Compass Players, an improvisational comedy revue directed by Paul Sills. He later joined the improvisational group Second City in Chicago. He joined the acting company at the Cleveland Play House during their 1958–1959 season as part of a grant from the Ford Foundation, appearing in productions such as To Dorothy a Son, Heaven Come Wednesday, Monique, and Job.[17] In 1958, he appeared as Carlyle Thompson III on The Phil Silvers Show in the episode titled \"Bilko the Art Lover\".\n\nAlda portrayed Charlie Cotchipee in the 1961 Ossie Davis play Purlie Victorious on Broadway. In the November 1964 world premiere at the ANTA Playhouse of the stage version of The Owl and The Pussycat, he played Felix the Owl, opposite Pussycat played by actress/singer Diana Sands,[18] an African-American actress; their onstage kiss prompted hate mail.[19] He continued to play Felix the Owl for the 1964–65 Broadway season.[20][21] In 1966, he starred in the musical The Apple Tree on Broadway with Barbara Harris, and was nominated for the Tony Award for Best Actor in a Musical for the role. Alda said he became a Mainer in 1957 when he played at the Kennebunkport Playhouse.[22]\n\nAlda was part of the cast, along with David Frost, Henry Morgan and Buck Henry, of the American television version of That Was The Week That Was, which ran as a series from January 10, 1964, to May 1965. He made his Hollywood acting debut as a supporting player in Gone Are the Days!, a film version of the Broadway play Purlie Victorious, which co-starred Ruby Dee and her husband, Ossie Davis. Other film roles followed, such as his portrayal of author, humorist and actor George Plimpton in the film Paper Lion (1968),[8] as well as The Extraordinary Seaman (1969), and the occult-murder-suspense thriller The Mephisto Waltz with actresses Jacqueline Bisset and Barbara Parkins. During this time, Alda frequently appeared as a game show panelist on the 1968 revival of What's My Line?, and on I've Got a Secret during its 1972 syndication revival. Alda wrote several of the stories and poems featured in Marlo Thomas' television show Free to Be... You and Me.\n\n1972–1983: M*A*S*H and acclaim\n\nedit\n\nIn early 1972, Alda auditioned for and was selected to play Hawkeye Pierce in the TV adaptation of the 1970 film M*A*S*H.[8] He was nominated for 21 Emmy Awards, and won five. He took part in writing 19 episodes, including the 1983 2.5-hour series finale \"Goodbye, Farewell and Amen\", which was also the 32nd episode he directed. Alda was the only series regular to appear in all 256 episodes.[23]\n\nAlda commuted from Los Angeles to his home in New Jersey every weekend for 11 years while starring in M*A*S*H.[24] His wife and daughters lived in New Jersey and he did not want to move his family to Los Angeles, initially because he did not know how long the show would last. Alda's father Robert Alda and half-brother Antony Alda appeared together in the 20th episode of season eight of M*A*S*H, \"Lend a Hand\". Robert had previously appeared in \"The Consultant\" in season three.\n\nDuring the series' first five seasons, its tone was largely that of a traditional \"service comedy\" in the vein of shows such as McHale's Navy. As the original writers gradually left the show, Alda gained increasing control, and by the final seasons had become a producer and creative consultant. Under his watch, M*A*S*H retained its comedic foundation, but gradually assumed a more serious tone, openly addressing political and social issues. As a result, the 11 years of M*A*S*H are generally split into two eras: the Larry Gelbart/Gene Reynolds \"comedy\" years (1972–1977), and the Alan Alda \"dramatic\" years (1977–1983).[citation needed] Alda disagreed with this assessment. In a 2016 interview he said, \"I don't like to write political messages. I don't like plays that have political messages. I do not think I am responsible for that.\"[25]\n\nAlda and his co-stars Wayne Rogers and McLean Stevenson worked well together during the first three seasons, but over time tensions developed as Alda's role grew in popularity and disrupted their characters' original 'equal' standing. Rogers and Stevenson left the show at the end of the third season.[26] Anticipating the fourth season, Alda and the producers sought a replacement for the surrogate parent role embodied in the character of Colonel Blake. Veteran actor Harry Morgan, who was a fan of the series, joined the cast as Colonel Sherman T. Potter and carried on as one of the show's lead protagonists.[27] Mike Farrell was introduced as Hawkeye's new tentmate BJ Hunnicutt.\n\nBy 1981, he was the highest paid person on a TV show with a contract paying him $225,000 an episode ($5.4 million per season).[28]\n\nIn his 1981 autobiography, Jackie Cooper, who directed several early M*A*S*H episodes, wrote that Alda concealed a lot of hostility, and that the two of them barely spoke by the end of Cooper's tenure there.[29] During his M*A*S*H years, Alda made several game-show appearances, most notably on The $10,000 Pyramid, and as a frequent panelist on What's My Line? and To Tell the Truth. He also wrote and starred in the title role of the 1979 political drama film The Seduction of Joe Tynan. His favorite episodes of M*A*S*H are \"Dear Sigmund\" and \"In Love and War\".[30] In 1996, Alda was ranked 41st on TV Guide's 50 Greatest TV Stars of All Time.[31]\n\nWriting and directing credits\n\nedit\n\nThe following is a list of M*A*S*H episodes written and/or directed by Alda.\n\nSeason Episode Credit One Episode 19: \"The Long John Flap\" Written Two Episode 5: \"Dr. Pierce and Mr. Hyde\" Written with Robert Klane Episode 23: \"Mail Call\" Directed Three Episode 16: \"Bulletin Board\" Directed Four Episode 4: \"The Late Captain Pierce\" Directed Episode 7: \"Dear Mildred\" Directed Episode 8: \"The Kids\" Directed Episode 16: \"Dear Ma\" Directed Five Episode 2: \"Margaret's Engagement\" Directed Episode 7: \"Dear Sigmund\" Written and directed Episode 12: \"Exorcism\" Directed Episode 19: \"Hepatitis\" Written and directed Six Episode 2: \"Fallen Idol\" Written and directed Episode 4: \"War of Nerves\" Written and directed Episode 7: \"In Love and War\" Written and directed Episode 12: \"Comrades in Arms, Part 1\" Written; directed with Burt Metcalfe Episode 13: \"Comrades in Arms, Part 2\" Written; directed with Burt Metcalfe Seven Episode 5: \"The Billfold Syndrome\" Directed Episode 8: \"Major Ego\" Directed Episode 14: \"Dear Sis\" Written and directed Episode 16: \"Inga\" Written and directed Episode 25: \"The Party\" Written with Burt Metcalfe Eight Episode 3: \"Guerilla My Dreams\" Directed Episode 11: \"Life Time\" Written with Walter D.

He has been a strong and vocal supporter of women's rights and the feminist movement.[8][32] He co-chaired, with former First Lady Betty Ford, the Equal Rights Amendment Countdown campaign. In 1976, The Boston Globe dubbed him \"the quintessential Honorary Woman: a feminist icon\" for his activism on behalf of the Equal Rights Amendment.[33]\n\nDuring M*A*S*H's run and continuing through the 1980s, Alda embarked on a successful career as a writer and director, with the ensemble dramedy, The Four Seasons being perhaps his most notable hit. After M*A*S*H, Alda took on a series of roles that either parodied or directly contradicted his \"nice guy\" image.[8] He then partnered with producer Martin Bregman on various films, first with an agreement at Universal Pictures in 1983, then it was moved to Lorimar Motion Pictures in 1986.[34] In 1988, Alda starred opposite Ann-Margret in the marital comedy A New Life. He also appeared frequently in the films of Woody Allen, beginning with Crimes and Misdemeanors (1989).\n\nBetsy's Wedding (1990) is Alda's last directing credit to date. He was a guest star five times on ER, playing Dr. Kerry Weaver's mentor, Gabriel Lawrence. During the later episodes, Lawrence was revealed to be in the early stages of Alzheimer's disease. Alda also had a co-starring role as Dr. Robert Gallo in the 1993 television film And the Band Played On. He continued appearing in the films of his friend Woody Allen, including Manhattan Murder Mystery (1993) and Everyone Says I Love You (1996). When asked about the controversy surrounding Allen in 2019, Alda stated, \"I'd work with him again if he wanted me. I'm not qualified to judge him... I just don't have enough information to convince me I shouldn't work with him. And he's an enormously talented guy.\"[35]\n\nAlda played Nobel Prize–winning physicist Richard Feynman in the play QED, which had only one other character. Although Peter Parnell wrote the play, Alda both produced and inspired it. From the fall season of 1993 until the show ended in 2005, Alda was the host for Scientific American Frontiers, which began on PBS in 1990.[36] In 1995, he starred as the President of the United States in Michael Moore's political satire/comedy film Canadian Bacon. Around this time, rumors circulated that Alda was considering running for the United States Senate in New Jersey, but he denied this. In 1996, Alda played Henry Ford, founder of the Ford Motor Company, in Camping With Henry and Tom, based on the book by Mark St. Germain and appeared in the comedy film, Flirting with Disaster. In 1997, Alda played National Security Adviser Alvin Jordan In Murder at 1600. In 1999, Alda portrayed Dr. Gabriel Lawrence in NBC program ER for five episodes and was nominated for Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Drama Series.[37]\n\nAlda starred in the original Broadway production of the play Art, which opened on March 1, 1998, at the Bernard B. Jacobs Theatre. The play won the Tony Award for Best Play.\n\n2000–present: The West Wing and other roles\n\nedit\n\nBeginning in 2004, Alda was a regular cast member on the NBC program The West Wing, portraying California Republican U.S. Senator and presidential candidate Arnold Vinick, until the show's conclusion in May 2006. He made his premiere in the sixth season's eighth episode, \"In The Room\", and was added to the opening credits with the 13th episode, \"King Corn\". In August 2006, Alda won an Emmy for his portrayal of Vinick in the final season of The West Wing. Alda appeared in a total of 28 episodes during the show's sixth and seventh seasons. Alda had been a serious candidate, along with Sidney Poitier, for the role of President Josiah Bartlet before Martin Sheen was ultimately cast in the role. In 2004, Alda portrayed conservative Maine Senator Owen Brewster in Martin Scorsese's Academy Award-winning film The Aviator, in which he co-starred with Leonardo DiCaprio. Alda received his first Academy Award nomination for this role in 2005. Alda also had a part in the 2000 romantic comedy What Women Want, as the CEO of the advertising firm where the main characters worked.\n\nIn early 2005, Alda starred as Shelly Levene in the Tony Award-winning Broadway revival of David Mamet's Glengarry Glen Ross, for which he received a nomination for the Tony Award for Best Featured Actor in a Play losing to his co-star Liev Schrieber. Throughout 2009 and 2010, he appeared in three episodes of 30 Rock as Milton Greene, the biological father of Jack Donaghy, played by Alec Baldwin. In January 2010, Alda hosted The Human Spark, a three-part series originally broadcast on PBS discussing the nature of human uniqueness and recent studies on the human brain.[38] In 2006, Alda contributed his voice to a part in the audio book of Max Brooks' World War Z. In this book, he voiced Arthur Sinclair Jr., the director of the United States government's fictional Department of Strategic Resources (DeStRes).\n\nAlda returned to Broadway in November 2014, playing the role of Andrew Makepeace in the revival of Love Letters at the Brooks Atkinson Theater alongside Candice Bergen.[39] In 2015, Alda appeared as a lawyer, Thomas Watters, alongside Tom Hanks as James Donovan, in Steven Spielberg's critically acclaimed cold war drama film Bridge of Spies which received an Academy Award nomination for Best Picture. In 2016, Alda gained critical praise for his performance in Louis C.K.'s acclaimed web-based series Horace and Pete as the irascible Uncle Pete. IndieWire critic Sam Adams described as \"his best role in years\".[40] In regards to C.K.'s recent scandal, Alda stated, \"I respect Louis so much as an artist. But he did a terrible thing, and I hope he finds a way to come to terms with both of those things.\"[41] Also in 2016, Alda took part in the opening night show of John Mulaney and Nick Kroll's Oh, Hello at the Lyceum Theatre on Broadway. The show is said to be inspired by \"two old men at the Strand buying a copy of Alda's book\". Before bringing Alda onstage, Mulaney said, \"This is genuinely the best guest we ever had.\"[42]"
