        "text": "‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt know how painful it is to want to love someone.‚Äù\n\nThe Four Seasons is without a doubt one of my grandpa‚Äôs most underrated movies. He writes, directors and stars in this movie about three couples who go on vacations with each other during each season.\n\nThe film is really sentimental and human. My grandpa‚Äôs intention with making this movie was to show that friendship goes through seasons as well. There‚Äôll always be ups and downs. Sometimes people will be too distant or busy for you, other times they‚Äôll always be around you. And you‚Äôll sometimes hit a rough patch with your friend where you may hate their guts! Much like the weather, there are four seasons when it comes‚Ä¶\n\nCinematic Time Capsule\n\n1981 Marathon - Film #36\n\n‚ÄùI don‚Äôt wanna look at my friends naked.\n\nIt makes it hard to have dinner with them later.‚Äù\n\nAlan Alda writes and directs this story of three couples all coming together for four different get-togethers that each take place during a different‚Ä¶. wait for it‚Ä¶. SEASON!\n\nIt‚Äôs a touching look at the complex nature of friendships and how fragile we all are under the surface. This was Alda‚Äôs first feature film as a director and even though there‚Äôs several obvious filmmaking shenanigans with things like a ski jump and a car stunt, the film is essentially about people and their relationships, which is what Alda excels at.\n\nHis relationship with Carol Burnett‚Ä¶\n\nToday is my grandpa‚Äôs 87th birthday ü•≥ To celebrate, I thought I‚Äôd rewatch a few of his movies.\n\nAs his years in M*A*S*H were winding down, my grandfather was trying to find the next thing to do. After directing many episodes on his tv show, he thought he‚Äôd go a step further and direct a feature. ‚ÄúThe Four Seasons‚Äù became the first of four movies he directed. It was also his most successful. Doing the writing/directing/acting triple threat, the movie also featured Carol Burnett, Rito Moreno, Sandy Dennis, Len Cariou and Jack Weston. It grossed $50 mil (not bad for a first feature!) and was nominated for 4 golden globes! It‚Äôs the type of movie that doesn‚Äôt get made anymore.‚Ä¶\n\n‚ÄúIs this the fun part? Are we having fun yet?‚Äù\n\nToday is my grandfather‚Äôs 88th(!) birthday so I thought I‚Äôd revisit my favorite movie he directed.\n\nIt‚Äôs an underrated movie from its time, not many talk about this little movie anymore but it was a commercial success when it came out. At a time when M*A*S*H was winding down, my grandpa signed a 5 picture deal with a production company, this being his first of the five. The Four Seasons grossed $50 mil on a $4.5 mil budget and was nominated for 4 golden globes! It‚Äôs a poignant and heartfelt exploration of the complexities of friendship and the evolving nature of relationships through the metaphor of the changing seasons. In‚Ä¶\n\n1981 In Review - May\n\n#15\n\nJack (Alan Alda) and Kate (Carol Burnett) traditionally go on vacation with their friends every new season. Old friend Nick (Len Cariou) surprises everyone when he arrives not with his wife, Anne (Sandy Dennis), but with his new girlfriend, the much younger Ginny (Bess Armstrong). The group -- all of which had grown to be good friends with Anne -- must come to terms with this unexpected development. Ultimately, they learn to accept Nick's decision, and work to welcome Ginny as a friend.\n\nThis is one of those movies that doesn't seem to go anywhere but exactly where you think it will go: It starts out with 3 couples fairly happily vacationing together. Without‚Ä¶\n\n‚ÄùWhat do other people do on their vacations?‚Äù\n\nNice little film written and directed by Alda, starring him and Carol Burnett. Told over four seasons, each representing a vacation with a group of couples, Alda is able to intersperse some good drama and comedy in this entertaining film.\n\nWhether intentional or not, the poster is kinda hilarious.\n\nInteresting trivia from IMDb: The movie was spun-off into a short-lived CBS television series, having the same title, The Four Seasons (1984), with it being broadcast for thirteen episodes in 1984. It was executive produced by Alan Alda who featured only in the first pilot episode as his Jack Burroughs character from this movie [See: The Four Seasons: Pilot: Part 1 (1984)].\n\nThe‚Ä¶"
