        "text": "This week, television editors and critics all across the country were sent a large chocolate-covered kiss to remind them, in the words of the press release, that ''Alan Alda's 'The Four Seasons' will return to the air on Sunday evening, April 29, with an episode called 'The Kiss,' about the sexual fantasies among friends. Share this kiss with someone you fantasize about.''\n\nThe chocolate kiss is only one of the promotional tools that CBS is using to try to salvage ''The Four Seasons,'' a situation comedy created and produced by Alan Alda and based on his feature film of the same name. It remains to be seen, however, whether the promotional effort can resuscitate a series in serious trouble.\n\nWhen ''The Four Seasons'' first appeared at the end of last January, it was accompanied by high expectations. Critical response was favorable, and the first episode ranked seventh in the Nielsen ratings. But Mr. Alda himself co-starred in that first episode. Once he vanished from the series, ratings plummeted, and matters were not helped by the fact that CBS-TV kept taking the program off the air in order to substitute special movie presentations.\n\n''The network felt that with the competition they were facing, they had to counterprogram with big movies and mini-series,'' Mr. Alda said. ''I understand why they did it, but I still think those hiatuses hurt us. People didn't get a chance to know the characters.''\n\nMovie Version an '81 Hit\n\nNow the network has assured Mr. Alda that, beginning Sunday at 8:30 P.M., the next seven episodes of ''The Four Seasons'' will be shown without any further disruptions in the schedule. This will be the show's last chance to find an audience before CBS announces its fall lineup.\n\nMr. Alda has not given up hope. He still believes strongly in the series, which, like the feature film, focuses on the friendship among three middle-aged couples. The friends are played by Jack Weston and Marcia Rodd, Tony Roberts and Joanna Kerns, Allan Arbus and Barbara Babcock, and the program also features Mr. Alda's two daughters, Beatrice and Elizabeth, in supporting roles.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
