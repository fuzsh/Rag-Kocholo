        "text": "Will Forte is the latest cast addition to Netflix‘s The Four Seasons, joining as a series regular in the comedy series based on Universal’s 1981 feature film. He joins fellow series regulars Tina Fey, Steve Carell, Colman Domingo, Erika Henningsen and Kerri Kenney-Silver. Details on their roles are being kept under wraps.\n\nThe Four Seasons is co-created by 30 Rock creator and star Fey, and 30 Rock alums Lang Fisher and Tracey Wigfield. The series is based on the 1981 film that was written and directed by Alan Alda, produced by Martin Bregman, and starred Alda and Carol Burnett. The series is slated to begin production later this year.\n\nThe Four Seasons TV series is written by Fey, Fisher and Wigfield who executive produce with David Miner, Eric Gurian and Jeff Richmond. Alda and Marissa Bregman will produce. Universal Television, a division of Universal Studio Group, is the producing studio. Fey’s Little Stranger, Inc. is the production company.\n\nIn addition to Alda and Burnett, The Four Seasons film starred Len Cariou, Sandy Dennis, Rita Moreno, Jack Weston and Bess Armstrong. Its title was derived from the four concerti composed by Antonio Vivaldi. Those compositions, along with others Vivaldi works, comprise the musical score.\n\nThe film spawned a short-lived 1994 CBS series produced by Alda.\n\nAn SNL alum known for playing the title role in comedy franchise McGruber and for his Fox series The Last Man on Earth, Forte most recently appeared in Netflix’s TV series Bodkin, produced by Barack and Michelle Obama’s Higher Ground. In addition to voicing Wolf Tobin on Fox’s The Great North, he recently voiced the character of Otis in Netflix’s Thelma The Unicorn and Coach Dan in Pixar’s Win or Lose for Disney+. Forte is repped by UTA, Rise and Ken Richman and Robby Koch from Hansen, Jacobson, Teller, Hoberman, Newman, Warren, Richman, Rush, Kaller, Gellman, Meigs & Fox."
