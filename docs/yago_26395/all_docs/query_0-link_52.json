        "text": "Tina Fey has set another series at Netflix — and will star in it as well as co-creating and executive producing.\n\nThe streamer has ordered a series based on the 1981 movie The Four Seasons from Fey and fellow 30 Rock alumni Lang Fisher and Tracey Wigfield. Universal TV, where Fey’s Little Stranger company is based, is producing the comedy. Netflix won a bidding war for the series, which was a hot property following the end of writers and actors strikes in the fall.\n\nAlan Alda wrote, directed and starred in The Four Seasons, which followed three couples who take vacations together each season and the changes in the group dynamic when one of couples splits up and the man brings a much younger woman on subsequent trips. The film’s cast also includes Carol Burnett, Len Cariou, Rita Moreno, Jack Weston, Sandy Dennis and Bess Armstrong.\n\nAlda (who had a recurring part on 30 Rock) and Marissa Bregman, daughter of the film’s producer, Martin Bregman, will serve as producers of the series.\n\nThe series will be Fey’s first lead role in a series since 30 Rock ended in 2013, though she hasn’t shied from on-camera roles in the interim. Her recent acting work includes a recurring part on Hulu’s Only Murders in the Building and roles in feature films A Haunting in Venice and Maggie Moore(s).\n\nFey and Netflix have a long history that includes Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt (which the streamer picked up after its initially intended home, NBC, passed on the show) and the animated series Mulligan. Netflix also picked up the third season of Girls5Eva, which Fey executive produces, after the first two ran on Peacock.\n\nFey, Fisher (Never Have I Ever) and Wigfield (Great News, Peacock’s Saved by the Bell update) will executive produce The Four Seasons with David Miner, Eric Gurian and Jeff Richmond."
