        "text": "Through winter, spring, summer and fall... somehow these friends have survived them all! In this heartfelt comedy about three 40-something couples who frequently vacation together, life’s ups and downs take their toll. Their perfect dynamic is forever changed when one friend leaves his wife for a much younger woman. The lines are drawn when they are forced to take sides regarding the new couple, reminding us that friendship is like the seasons—forever changing. Written, directed and starring Alan Alda (Sweet Liberty, Betsy’s Wedding), this hit romantic comedy also stars Carol Burnett (The Front Page), Len Cariou (A Little Night Music), Sandy Dennis (The Indian Runner), Rita Moreno (The Night of the Following Day), Jack Weston (Fuzz) and Bess Armstrong (High Road to China)."
