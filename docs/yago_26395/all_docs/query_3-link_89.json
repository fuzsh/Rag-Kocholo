        "text": "Alan Alda will always be best remembered for his 11-year stint as acerbic, witty, brilliant, martini-loving Hawkeye Pierce on the TV series “M*A*S*H.” But Alda had already been a very busy actor before the series made him a household name. He began guest starring on TV shows and landing parts in feature films a decade before “M*A*S*H,” was riveting in Woody Allen’s “Crimes and Misdemeanors,” and more recently had terrific roles in “The West Wing” and “The Blacklist.” Alda is back onscreen in the newest Nicholas Sparks adaptation, “The Longest Ride.” He has the pivotal role of Ira Levinson, a widower who’s in a bad car accident but manages to stay alive by imagining the presence of his late wife Ruth, and by being rescued by Luke and Sophia, a young couple who happen upon the wreck. It’s a multi-leveled story of the relationships between Luke and Sophia (Scott Eastwood and Britt Robertson), between Ira and Sophia, who has doubts about Luke and, in flashback, between young Ira (Jack Huston) and Ruth (Oona Chaplin). Alda, 79, cheerful and twinkly eyed, spoke last week about what the role meant to him, and tossed in a neat bit about his own lengthy marriage.\n\nQ: You’ve been in this acting business for a long time. Any thoughts of retiring?\n\nA: To do WHAT? No, I have no thought of that. I have plenty of things I do besides acting. I write and I do the science stuff. But I love this. It’s wonderful to do what you know how to do, and to get better at what you know how to do. Those are the two greatest pleasures for me.\n\nQ: You play a man who’s quite a few years older than you are. How did you prepare for the part?\n\nA: I prepared for the movie by getting old. It was a long time. It takes years.\n\nQ: Ira teaches Sophia a lot about love by sharing his and Ruth’s story. Do you think Sophia teaches Ira anything?\n\nA: I think her generosity has an effect on him. She pushes him a little bit to let somebody into his life. He’s angry that his wife is gone. He’s kind of angry at everybody. But I don’t think that’s characteristic of him. It’s a temporary condition brought on by his loss. He’s not cranky when he’s a young man. But Sophia’s generosity brings him back to life a little bit, and he feels affection toward her. That maybe helps her pay attention to things he’s learned during his life. You get this somewhat unusual situation where young people are actually using the experience of older people. That’s the fictional part of the story (laughs).\n\nQ: The film’s storyline really stresses the joys and challenges of a relationship standing the test of time.\n\nA: That’s right. They have what people confront when they go from the blush of young love and infatuation to having to figure out how to live together. And they suddenly find out that each other wants things that are very hard to come up with, or impossible to come up with. So somebody’s got to give. Somebody’s got to make an adjustment. I don’t think of it as a sacrifice. When you do it because you care about the other person getting what they need or what they want, then you don’t feel it as a sacrifice. You make that allowance or adjustment. That’s what makes this movie unusual to me. So many movies stop right where this one picks up steam, which is how do you stay together for a long time?\n\nQ: You’ve been married to Arlene for almost 60 years. Did you find yourself identifying with the theme of enduring love in the movie?\n\nA: Here’s how we knew we would be together forever. One of the first times we met, we were at dinner at somebody’s house. The woman who invited us made a rum cake for dessert, and she had it on top of the refrigerator. The refrigerator was always shaking, and the rum cake slowly moved to the edge of the refrigerator and fell, splat, on the floor of the kitchen. Arlene and I were the only two people who got up with spoons and ate it off the floor. So that’s how you know if people are going to be together.\n\nEd Symkus covers movies for More Content Now."
