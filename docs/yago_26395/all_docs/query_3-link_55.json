        "text": "Americaâs funniest military doctor is now Americaâs funniest great-grandfatherâa perpetually vibrant screen presence whoâs still crafting memorable performances as an octogenarian. Born Alphonso DâAbruzzo on January 28, 1936, Alan Alda has graced us with some of the best movie and television performances of all time.\n\nNearly a half-century before the term âprestige TVâ first entered our pop culture conversations, Alda was making us laugh and cry on M*A*S*H. He was also building a bigger shelf for all the Emmys he scored (he won a total of five for the series, plus another in 2006 for The West Wing). After M*A*S*H ended, Alda continued to build a formidable career improving every role heâs been in with his trademark charm and guile.\n\nHere are 10 facts about the man behind the second Captain Benjamin Franklin âHawkeyeâ Pierce.\n\n1. Alan Alda smoked a pipe at age two for publicity.\n\nAlan Aldaâs father was a singer in burlesque shows, so the family was constantly on the road. Before performances in Toronto when Alda was a toddler, his father hit upon the idea of posing the two-year-old Alda with a pipe for a Toronto Daily Star photographer to spark a minor sensation. The headline read âCHILD OF TWO SMOKES PIPE; ONCE BROKE MOTHERâS NOSE.\"\n\n2. Alan Alda had a stage name waiting for him.\n\nA lot of actors change their names, but Aldaâs stage name was already in the family. His father, Alphonso Giuseppe Giovanni Robert DâAbruzzo, acted under the name Robert AldaââAldaâ being a portmanteau made from the first two letters of his first and last names.\n\n3. Alan Alda served in Korea.\n\nBefore acting in the fictional 4077th medical unit stationed in Korea during the war, Alda served a six-month tour in Korea in charge of a mess tent as part of the Army Reserve. âThey had designs of making me into an officer, but, uh, it didnât go so well,â Alda later said during a Q&A at Southern Connecticut State University.\n\n4. Alan Alda's first major nomination was for a Tony Award.\n\nWe think of Alda as a TV and film star, but he began his career doing live theater, first at the Cleveland Play House and then on Broadway. He starred in The Owl and the Pussycat on Broadway in 1964 and scored a Tony nomination in 1966 for The Apple Tree. Heâs won Emmys and Golden Globes, but heâs also been nominated for an Oscar and several Tonys, putting him at times within armâs reach of an EGOT.\n\n5. Alan Alda was the only M*A*S*H cast member who knew what would happen to Colonel Blake.\n\nFor three seasons, McLean Stevenson played the affable, laid-back Lt. Colonel Blake, whose ultimate fate was a shock to fans. It was also a shock to cast members who filmed the finale but weren't given the last page of the script. As a writer, director, and main star on the show, Alda knew that producers were planning to kill Blake off-camera.\n\nâAfter three years of showing faceless bit players and extras portraying dying or dead servicemen, here was an opportunity to have a character die that our audience knew and loved, one whose death would mean something to them,â producer Larry Gelbart said.\n\n6. Before Alan Alda was on The West Wing, he was almost on The West Wing.\n\nAlda joined the The West Wing in its sixth season after showrunner John Wells asked the actor if he wanted to ârun for President as the Republican nominee.â He played Senator Arnold Vinick until the series finale, where he spent most of his time on the series trying to become President. But he almost got the job when the show began. Before Martin Sheen signed on to play President Josiah Bartlet, Alda was in the running to play the POTUS, but turned the part down because he didnât want to be tied down to a regular series.\n\n7. Alan Alda is the only person to win acting, directing, and writing Emmys for the same program.\n\nAn astonishing feat (technically rarer than the EGOT), Aldaâs dedication to 11 seasons of M*A*S*H resulted in five Emmysâthree for acting, one for writing the episode âInga,â and one for directing the iconic episode âDear Sigmundâ (which he also wrote). More than mere trophies, Alda also had a hand in writing the series finale, âGoodbye, Farewell and Amen,â which was viewed by more than 121 million viewers, making it the most-watched finale of a TV show ever.\n\n8. Alan Alda helped the BBC report on the Large Hadron Collider.\n\nAs a sincere science enthusiast, Alda hosted Scientific American Frontiers for PBS for years. So when CERN launched the Large Hadron Collider, the BBC called on Alda to offer his perspective alongside Britainâs most famous public intellectual, Professor Brian Cox. Alda also got to visit the Collider a few years later. His favorite part? âStanding on that platform, looking at that giant device, and this frightening millisecond I had when I heard that after the collision the particles are flying through the air to get to the detector,â Alda said. âThey would have been going through me.\"\n\n9. The Boston Globe dubbed Alan Alda an \"honorary woman.\"\n\nAlda is a staunch feminist who spent years campaigning aggressively for the Equal Rights Amendment and co-chaired the Equal Rights Amendment Countdown with First Lady Betty Ford. He also served on the National Commission for the Observance of International Womenâs Year in 1976 after an appointment from President Ford, and his involvement as an early, highly public ally led one Boston Globe writer to name him âthe quintessential Honorary Woman: a feminist icon.â\n\n10. Alan Alda hosts a podcast."
