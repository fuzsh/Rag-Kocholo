        "text": "Actor Brian Alda, who found fame as Captain \"Hawkeye\" Pierce in M*A*S*H, is 80 today. The Oscar-nominated actor, who appears in Steven Spielberg's latest film, Bridge of Spies, told Tom Shone about his life and career in this 2006 interview, which coincided with the release of Shone's autobiography\n\nIn the autumn of 2003, Alan Alda was in Chile recording a segment for Scientific American Frontiers, a popular science programme that he has fronted for almost 20 years. He was staring up at the Andromeda Galaxy through a telescope when he came down with fierce abdominal cramps.\n\nThe cramps got worse, his belly swelled up to twice its normal size and he was rushed to the local ER, where the doctor diagnosed a life-threatening intestinal obstruction. He said they could either operate where they were or they could fly him to a bigger hospital, in Santiago, which was two hours away, but that he might not make it. Alda let them operate where they were.\n\n\"Oh, You're going to do an end-to-end anastomosis.\" he pointed out, chirpily, as they were preparing him for surgery.\n\n\"Yes. How do you know that?' 'I did many of them on M*A*S*H.\"\n\nThe Alan Alda who shows up for tea in a hotel in Manhattan's Upper West Side - an appropriately gilded setting for a man who has starred in several Woody Allen movies - couldn't have looked in ruder health.\n\nAlda has always been the model of a certain sort of American garrulity: the born people-pleaser, with his easy conviviality and lightning-fast smile reflex. \"I was brought up to want approval from the time I was two, I was trained to be a performer,\" he says, and as he details in his new book, Never Have Your Dog Stuffed, And Other Things I Have Learned, which despite its cap-and-bells title turns out to be an unusually thoughtful rumination on the actor's life.\n\nIt started as an account of his near-death experience in Chile, which he passed to his friend, the actor Charles Grodin, who in turn passed it to his editor at Random House.\n\n\"I've been asked to do a book many times,\" says Alda, munching on salmon sandwiches, \"but this time, I thought it would be interesting to look at my life from the perspective of someone reborn. This was a big change in my life to be given my life all over again.\"\n\n\"I don't know if I would have been this glad to be alive if I almost didn't die. Everybody I've talked to who has almost died said to me that their lives were different since then. One of them said, 'Hang onto that feeling for as long as you can because it nearly went away for me.' And I thought it would have gone by now, but it hasn't. I'm lucky. I actually do enjoy things more. It's not that I don't get impatient or angry at things but when I do I enjoy that. When I curse in impatience, I have a good time at it.\"\n\nThe big surprise of Alda's book, in fact, is the streak of anger running through it, which he traces back to his childhood, and the conspiracy of silence surrounding his mother's paranoid schizophrenia. His father was a film actor and comedian, struggling to make it in Hollywood while his wife was brandishing knives in the kitchen.\n\nThe book's opening line - \"My mother didn't try to stab my father until I was six\" - gives an idea of what family life was like. \"It was very difficult, very embarrassing for him,\" Alda says. \"One time David Selznick came over to the apartment, and she said, 'So you're David Selznick,' and he said, 'Yes I am.' And she said, 'Sure, sure you are,' and started to accuse him of lying.\"\n\nAnother time she became convinced that the apartment was bugged, and that spies were listening in on her. \"With schizophrenia the hallucinations are completely real,\" says Alda. \"It would be like someone coming in now and saying, 'You know, I've watched you for an hour-and-a-half and you think you're talking to someone, but there's no one there.' Either one of us would say, 'How dare you, I'm sane, I know there's somebody there. You're trying to make me doubt my own sanity.' You wouldn't take it and neither would she. They were absolutely real to her.\"\n\nAs a young child, however, Alda understood none of this. \"Whenever a kid finds out that something may be seriously wrong with a parent the kid's first reaction is: who's going to take care of me? I think I was asking myself that question all the time and wasn't too happy with the answers I was getting.\" All of this is fascinating in view of Alda's later obsession with logic - Alda scored 100 per cent in the subject at school - and his career in the highly illogical, topsy-turvy world of comedy.\n\nAs he writes in his book, \"The only way to survive it was to behave as though we were characters in my own private farce.\"\n\nThe character of Hawkeye, the maverick surgeon in M*A*S*H, is, I suggest, essentially that of a man pursuing a logical path in a highly illogical situation: a man performing delicate operations amid the insanity of war, much as the young Alda had to hold firm onto whatever reality he could, while his mother lost her mind.\n\nHe nods assent to the theory. \"My life depended on being able to observe well because she was telling me crazy things, and one of them could be dangerous to me. I had to be my own parent.\" He escaped into his father's world - observing the comedians who came to supper, trying to figure out what made them funny and then watching them on stage.\n\n\"That's really the only training I ever had,\" he says, \"watching from the wings. You learn a great deal more than watching from the audience. You're not in the sway of the illusion from the side. Its not like watching the show. You see the ebb and flow of the actors' energy, and you see in their eyes when they start to take off in their imagination. You can track their progress.\"\n\n\"I thought I could reduce chaos to a formula and the money would pour in. And I thought I wasn't gambling - 'Oh, that guy is addicted, but not me' - and I'm up all night, poring over the racing charts! I'm kind of touched by this guy who I was at the time. Sometimes it seems like a different person that it happened to so long ago, but I'm fond of that guy, seeking answers to things, asking interesting questions. If I see one of my grandchildren acting that way now, I'm totally on their side.\"\n\nAlda now has seven grandchildren, courtesy of three children with his wife, Arlene, to whom he has been married for more than 30 years. \"When acting students ask me how to be successful, I tell them: find a life partner to help you find out what you value in life and help you stick to it. Because if you do get even a little bit successful you'll be asked to do things you don't believe in, and so you have to know what you believe in.\"\n\nIt was Alda's success with M*A*S*H - which he starred in and ended up co-writing and directing - that turned Alda into a household name, an icon of American geniality; although the response he drew in public was frequently anything but genial.\n\n\"It's the hunting instinct that comes out: the guy that grabs you by the arm and says, 'Hey, look at this, look what I found!' like you're not even there. People will say, 'Hey, I recognised you,' like they bagged you. It's not such an accomplishment to recognise someone, but they'll be proud of it: 'Hey, I heard your voice, I knew it was you.'\"\n\nThe last episode of M*A*S*H, which Alda himself decided to shut down, was watched by 125 million people - almost half the country. \"I wanted them to be proud of us and not run it all the way into the ground. You hear it when people are ending a conversation. 'Well, I'll let you go now,' which means 'I'm getting off.' Not that you have any place to go.\"\n\nWhen his mother finally succumbed to full-blown dementia in the mid-1980s, Alda found himself drawing on Stanislavskian acting tips to help her cope with her demons: \"Even though you know they're devils,\" he told her, \"if you act as if they're doctors, they may be able to help you.\"\n\nLikewise, when his father suffered a stroke, Alda found himself improvising bits of therapy to help him with his aphasia, trying to trick him into speaking with sudden questions: \"Dad, quick, what's that?\" \"Its very odd the way the brain works when it's struck that way. He could sing, he could sing the words. Then, his concentration was not on saying the word but on the music. There was something about the intention to say the word that blocked the neurons. Being intentional about it stopped it. But if you did some kind of runaround with it you could get there.\"\n\nAlda seems to have given his own reputation a runaround with his recent performances. Playing a lizard-like politician in The Aviator, in particular, Alda showed how chilling it can be when people-pleasers let the mask slip. \"Of course, it's also amusing to be a bad person,\" he told me. \"It's shocking how many bad people have admirers in real life. Mafiosi, dictators. A lot of people really like Saddam Hussein. These characters get to do whatever they want, and on the screen we can enjoy it vicariously because we don't make the connection with real human suffering: 'Look, they get to do whatever they want to do! Isn't that great!'\"\n\nAlda's eye for absurdity remains as sharp as ever, his Oscar nomination providing him more than enough material. \"I'm really glad I went through that, because it's one of those rare experiences in showbusiness. You do the work and then they give you all these gifts for being nominated. I actually got a gift certificate for Botox. And an appointment with a plastic surgeon, a whole suitcase full of face cream, a trip to China. But Botox? It's saying, ''You were very expressive in that movie, shoot this in your face. See if you can act with no expression whatsoever!\""
