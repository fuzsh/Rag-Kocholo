        "text": "Alan Alda (born under the name Alphonso Joseph D'Abruzzo) is an American actor, comedian, film director, and screenwriter from New York City. His father was the Italian-American actor Robert Alda. Alda's best known role was playing chief surgeon Benjamin Franklin \"Hawkeye\" Pierce in the medical-themed sitcom M*A*S*H (1972-1983) for 11 seasons. He twice won the \"Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series\" for this role. Alda was later nominated for the \"Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor\", for his portrayal of career politician Ralph Owen Brewster (1888-1961) in the biographical film \"The Aviator\" (2004). The film depicted Brewster's opposition to the commercial interests of Howard Hughes, and the alleged political corruption which caused the end of Brewster's career.\n\nIn 1936, Alda was born in the Bronx, New York City. By that time, his father Robert Alda (1914-1986) had already started performing in vaudeville and burlesque theaters. Alda's mother was former beauty queen Joan Browne. Alda had Italian ancestry on his father's side of the family, and Irish ancestry on his mother's side of the family. Alda spend much of his childhood touring the United States with his father, as his father's acting job required frequent travel.\n\nIn 1943, Alda contracted polio. His parents chose to administer a painful treatment regimen, \"consisting of applying hot woolen blankets to his limbs and stretching his muscles\".
