Starting July 1st this will be the best way to listen to WBER online. Other 3rd party services (including TuneIn, which also provides the embedded player) will continue to work, but if you are currently streaming WBER through a saved link in the audio player on your computer (ie. iTunes, VLC, etc) please take a moment to try the new player. The saved link in your audio player will not work after July 1.\n\nWBER is a listener and school district supported community radio station.\n\nServing the Rochester and Western New York area since 1985, WBER is owned and operated by the Board of Cooperative Educational Services, Monroe #1, and is a real life training ground for students from participating school districts via their radio clubs, as well as members of the community interested in learning about radio broadcasting.\n\nWBER also offers remote broadcasting services to area school districts which currently include Webster and Fairport. WBER is o­ne of America’s first full time Alternative Music radio stations, believing in and supporting this genre of music long before it became commercially viable."
