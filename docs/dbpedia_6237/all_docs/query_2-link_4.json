        "text": "Monroe County is in the northern tier of western New York State, northeast of Buffalo and northwest of Syracuse. The northern county line is also the state line and the border of the United States, marked by Lake Ontario.\n\nMonroe County is north of the Finger Lakes.\n\nMain Industries: Monroe County is a home to a number of international businesses, including Eastman Kodak, Bausch & Lomb, Paychex, and Pictometry International, all of which make Monroe County world headquarters. Xerox, while no longer headquartered in Rochester, has its principal offices and manufacturing facilities in Monroe County.\n\nBecause of the prevalence of imaging and optical science among the industry and the universities, Rochester is known as the world capital of imaging. Monroe County is also home to regional businesses such as Wegmans, Roberts Communications, Inc., PAETEC Holding Corp., and major fashion label Hickey Freeman.\n\nEducation: The county is home to nine colleges and universities: Bryant & Stratton College, Colgate Rochester Crozer Divinity School, Everest Institute, Monroe Community College, Nazareth College, Roberts Wesleyan College, Rochester Institute of Technology, St. Bernard's School of Theology and Ministry, St. John Fisher College, State University of New York at Brockport, and the University of Rochester. Additionally, several colleges maintain satellite campuses in Monroe County: The Cornell University School of Industrial and Labor Relations, Empire State College, and Ithaca College's Department of Physical Therapy and Medaille College.\n\nLand: Today, Monroe County is comprised of 19 towns, 10 villages and the City of Rochester, the third largest city in the state."
