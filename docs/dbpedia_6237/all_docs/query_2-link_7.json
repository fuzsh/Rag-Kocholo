        "text": "County in New York, United States\n\nNot to be confused with Monroe, New York.\n\nCounty in New York\n\nMonroe County is a county in the U.S. state of New York, located along Lake Ontario's southern shore. As of 2022, the population was 752,035, according to Census Bureau estimates.[1] Its county seat and largest city is Rochester.[2] The county is named after James Monroe, the fifth president of the United States.[3] Monroe County is part of the Rochester, NY Metropolitan Statistical Area. The county is part of the Finger Lakes region of the state.\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nWhen counties were established in the Province of New York in 1683, the present Monroe County was part of Albany County. This was an enormous county, including the northern part of the State of New York as well as all of the present State of Vermont and, in theory, extending westward to the Pacific Ocean. This county was reduced in size on July 3, 1766, by the creation of Cumberland County, and further on March 16, 1770, by the creation of Gloucester County, both containing territory now in Vermont.\n\nOn March 12, 1772, what was left of Albany County was split into three parts, one remaining under the name Albany County. One of the other pieces, Tryon County, contained the western portion (and thus, since no western boundary was specified, theoretically still extended west to the Pacific). The eastern boundary of Tryon County was approximately five miles west of the present city of Schenectady, and the county included the western part of the Adirondack Mountains and the area west of the West Branch of the Delaware River. The area then designated as Tryon County now includes 37 counties of the State of New York. The county was named for William Tryon, colonial governor of New York.\n\nIn the years prior to 1776, most of the Loyalists in Tryon County fled to Canada. In 1784, following the peace treaty that ended the American Revolutionary War, the name of Tryon County was changed to Montgomery County in order to honor the general, Richard Montgomery, who had captured several places in Canada and died attempting to capture the city of Quebec, replacing the name of the hated British governor.\n\nIn 1789, Ontario County was split off from Montgomery. The actual area split off from Montgomery County was much larger than the present county, also including the present Allegany, Cattaraugus, Chautauqua, Erie, Genesee, Livingston, Monroe, Niagara, Orleans, Steuben, Wyoming, Yates, and part of Schuyler and Wayne counties.\n\nGenesee County was created by a splitting of Ontario County in 1802. This was much larger than the present Genesee County, however. It contained the present Allegany, Cattaraugus, Chautauqua, Erie, Niagara, Orleans, Wyoming, and portions of Livingston and Monroe counties.\n\nFinally, Monroe County was formed from parts of Genesee and Ontario counties in 1821.\n\nGeography\n\n[edit]\n\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county's total area is 1,367 square miles (3,540 km2), of which 657 square miles (1,700 km2) is land and 710 square miles (1,800 km2) (52%) is water.[4]\n\nMonroe County is in Western State of New York's northern tier, northeast of Buffalo and northwest of Syracuse. The northern county line is also the state line and the border of the United States, marked by Lake Ontario. Monroe County is north of the Finger Lakes.\n\nAdjacent counties\n\n[edit]\n\nWayne County - east\n\nOntario County - southeast\n\nLivingston County - south\n\nOrleans County - west\n\nGenesee County - southwest\n\nMajor highways\n\n[edit]\n\nGovernment and politics\n\n[edit]\n\nMonroe County was chartered as a municipal corporation by the New York State Legislature in 1892[5] and re-chartered under New York's Municipal Home Rule Law in 1965.[6]\n\nFrom 1856 to 1932, Monroe County voted for the Republican candidate in every presidential election apart from 1912. Democratic candidate Woodrow Wilson was able to win the county in 1912 when the Republican vote was divided between then incumbent president William Howard Taft and former president Theodore Roosevelt. Monroe County voted for incumbent Democratic presidents Franklin D. Roosevelt (1936, 1940, 1944) and Harry S. Truman (1948). From 1952 to 1976, Monroe County voted for the Republican candidate in all presidential elections except for Lyndon B. Johnson's Democratic landslide in 1964. In 1980, incumbent Democratic president Jimmy Carter won Monroe County, despite having lost in the county to Republican Gerald Ford in 1976. Monroe County went back to voting Republican in 1984 and 1988, but has voted for the Democratic presidential candidate every time from 1992 onwards, up to and including the 2020 election.\n\nIn recent years, the urban area's traditional partisan dynamic appears to have begun shifting in the Democratic Party's favor at the local level. A Democrat won the 2017 race for county sheriff for the first time in decades, in 2019 Democrat Adam Bello was elected county executive after over 30 years of Republican control, in 2020 democrats Samra Brouk and Jeremy Cooney flipped state senate districts long held by the GOP, and the traditionally Republican county legislature is now split 16-13 in favor of the Democratic Party. This matches a broader national trend of increased Democratic success in suburban areas.[7][8][9][10][11]\n\nUnited States presidential election results for Monroe County[12] Year Republican Democratic Third party(ies) No. % No. % No. % 2020 145,661 38.23% 225,746 59.25% 9,582 2.52% 2016 136,582 39.27% 188,592 54.23% 22,616 6.50% 2012 133,362 39.95% 193,501 57.97% 6,950 2.08% 2008 144,262 40.47% 207,371 58.18% 4,791 1.34% 2004 163,545 47.67% 173,497 50.57% 6,022 1.76% 2000 141,266 44.45% 161,743 50.89% 14,816 4.66% 1996 115,694 37.32% 164,858 53.18% 29,442 9.50% 1992 134,021 39.38% 141,502 41.57% 64,846 19.05% 1988 155,271 49.85% 153,650 49.33% 2,545 0.82% 1984 182,696 57.76% 132,109 41.77% 1,472 0.47% 1980 128,615 41.93% 142,423 46.43% 35,695 11.64% 1976 167,303 55.14% 134,739 44.40% 1,392 0.46% 1972 196,579 61.95% 120,031 37.83% 695 0.22% 1968 143,233 48.27% 141,437 47.66% 12,085 4.07% 1964 80,099 28.05% 205,226 71.86% 257 0.09% 1960 148,423 51.19% 141,378 48.76% 147 0.05% 1956 183,747 66.83% 91,161 33.16% 23 0.01% 1952 159,172 58.89% 110,723 40.97% 370 0.14% 1948 109,608 48.12% 110,641 48.57% 7,544 3.31% 1944 111,725 48.10% 119,672 51.52% 876 0.38% 1940 114,383 48.45% 120,613 51.09% 1,099 0.47% 1936 93,055 44.20% 114,286 54.29% 3,182 1.51% 1932 95,964 51.60% 83,208 44.75% 6,788 3.65% 1928 99,803 55.73% 73,759 41.19% 5,516 3.08% 1924 80,577 57.09% 28,956 20.52% 31,595 22.39% 1920 73,809 63.78% 28,523 24.65% 13,389 11.57% 1916 39,393 61.68% 21,782 34.11% 2,688 4.21% 1912 16,880 31.51% 17,863 33.34% 18,834 35.15% 1908 33,250 56.69% 22,704 38.71% 2,695 4.60% 1904 30,772 60.27% 16,544 32.41% 3,737 7.32% 1900 26,691 54.62% 19,611 40.13% 2,568 5.25% 1896 26,288 58.66% 17,158 38.28% 1,372 3.06% 1892 21,327 51.41% 17,706 42.68% 2,455 5.92% 1888 21,650 54.55% 16,677 42.02% 1,361 3.43% 1884 18,325 54.89% 13,249 39.68% 1,812 5.43% 1880 17,102 54.87% 13,742 44.09% 327 1.05% 1876 14,738 52.71% 13,127 46.95% 93 0.33% 1872 13,033 58.44% 9,261 41.52% 9 0.04% 1868 11,682 53.83% 10,019 46.17% 0 0.00% 1864 10,203 52.84% 9,107 47.16% 0 0.00% 1860 10,808 59.72% 7,291 40.28% 0 0.00% 1856 7,584 49.45% 4,683 30.53% 3,070 20.02% 1852 7,467 51.29% 6,314 43.37% 776 5.33% 1848 6,539 51.53% 1,443 11.37% 4,708 37.10% 1844 6,873 53.22% 5,611 43.45% 430 3.33% 1840 6,468 56.84% 4,835 42.49% 77 0.68% 1836 4,887 55.41% 3,932 44.59% 0 0.00% 1832 4,906 58.65% 3,459 41.35% 0 0.00% 1828 4,694 59.88% 3,145 40.12% 0 0.00%\n\nExecutive branch\n\n[edit]\n\nThe county's executive branch is headed by the County Executive, Adam Bello.[13][14] The executive's office is on the first floor of the County Office Building on West Main Street in Rochester. The current County Clerk is Jamie Romeo, a Democrat.\n\nThe county was exclusively governed by a Board of Supervisors for the first 114 years of its history. In 1935, the position of County Manager, appointed by the Board, was approved by popular referendum.[15] In 1983, the position was replaced by a County Executive, directly elected by popular vote, with expanded powers (e.g., veto).[16] In 1993, the legislature enacted term limits for the executive office of 12 consecutive years to start in 1996.[17]\n\nMonroe County Executives Name Title Party Term Clarence A.

As with most counties in New York, the MCSO also performs a range of police services and provides physical and operational security to the courts. The MCSO is led by a Sheriff who is elected by the residents of Monroe County, serving a 4-year term. They are considered the highest police official in the county, followed by an appointed Undersheriff and subordinate Chief Deputy.[18] The Monroe County Sheriff is Todd K. Baxter, a Democrat.\n\nOrganizationally, the office is composed of numerous bureaus, each responsible for a given scope of functional operations. The Jail Bureau is the largest component of the Sheriff's Office, overseeing an inmate population of around 1,000. Under the New York State Constitution, the Sheriff is the warden of the county jail.\n\nThe Police Bureau of the Sheriff's Office operates a sizable road patrol force which serves municipalities within Monroe County that do not independently enforce traffic. They are also responsible for primary police patrols at the Greater Rochester International Airport and parks throughout the county. Deputies assigned to the Marine Unit patrol the coastline of Lake Ontario as well as Irondequoit Bay. The Police Bureau further employs a mounted unit, bomb squad, SWAT team, hostage recovery, criminal investigations, SCUBA, and canine units. The court security bureau provides security at the Hall of Justice as well as at the state Appellate Court building.[19]\n\nIn 2011, the Monroe County Sheriff's Office's uniform was named the 2011 Public Safety Uniform Award in the County Sheriff's/Police Department category by the North American Association of Uniform Manufacturers and Distributors (NAUMD).[20]\n\nLegislative branch\n\n[edit]\n\nThe county's legislative branch consists of a 29-member County Legislature which replaced the earlier 43-member Board of Supervisors on January 1, 1967.[15] It meets in the Legislative Chambers on the fourth floor of the County Office Building. All 29 members of the Legislature are elected from districts. There are currently 16 Democrats and 13 Republicans. The President of the Legislature is Yversha Román, a Democrat. In 1993, the Legislature enacted term limits of 10 consecutive years to start in 1996.[17] Legislators can return to the office after not being in the Legislature for a term. Since the enacting of term limits, as of 2024 four Legislators (Stephanie Aldersley, Karla Boyce, Calvin Lee, Jr., and Robert Colby) returned after previously being term limited; Boyce was re-elected again three times while Lee and Colby were appointed to fill vacancies before subsequently being re-elected themselves and Aldersley was appointed before being defeated for re-election.\n\nMonroe County Legislature[21] District Area Legislator Party Residence Tenure began 1 Parma, Greece G.

While no longer headquartered in Rochester, Xerox has its principal offices and manufacturing facilities in Monroe County,[citation needed] and Bausch and Lomb was headquartered in Rochester until it was acquired by Valeant Pharmaceuticals. Monroe County is also home to regional businesses such as Wegmans,[25] Roberts Communications, Inc.,[26] Holding Corp.,[27] and major fashion label Hickey Freeman.[28]\n\nHigh technology\n\n[edit]\n\nFurther information: Tech Valley\n\nTech Valley, the technologically recognized area of eastern New York State, has spawned a western offshoot into the Rochester, Monroe County, and Finger Lakes areas of New York State. Since the 2000s, as the more established companies in Rochester downsized, the economy of Rochester and Monroe County has been redirected toward high technology, with new, smaller companies providing the seed capital necessary for business foundation. The Rochester and Monroe County area is important in the field of photographic processing and imaging as well as incubating an increasingly diverse high technology sphere encompassing STEM fields, in part the result of private startup enterprises collaborating with major academic institutions, including the University of Rochester and Cornell University.[29] Given the high prevalence of imaging and optical science among the industry and the universities, Rochester is known as the world capital of imaging. The Institute of Optics of the University of Rochester and the Rochester Institute of Technology in nearby Henrietta both have imaging programs.[30]\n\nMajor Employers:\n\nSeveral industries occupy a major portion of the jobs located regionally, with healthcare comprising a significant portion of jobs in Monroe County. The U of R (including its numerous hospitals) is the largest employer regionally with over 27,000 workers; Rochester Regional Health (parent company of Rochester General and Unity Hospitals) is the second largest consisting of over 15,000. Wegmans is third with about 13,000 local employees.[31]\n\nDemographics\n\n[edit]\n\nHistorical population CensusPop.Note%± 183049,855—184064,90230.2%185087,65035.0%1860100,64814.8%1870117,86817.1%1880144,90322.9%1890189,58630.8%1900217,85414.9%1910283,21230.0%1920352,03424.3%1930423,88120.4%1940438,2303.4%1950487,63211.3%1960586,38720.3%1970711,91721.4%1980702,238−1.4%1990713,9681.7%2000735,3433.0%2010744,3441.2%2020759,4432.0%2022 (est.)752,035−1.0%\n\nAs of the census of 2020, there were 759,443 people, 301,948 households, and 232,500 families residing in the county.
