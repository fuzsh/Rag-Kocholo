Our young pup picked up on the training quickly thanks to Alla! This gives her so much freedom to roam the yard safely.\"\n\nLauren R.\n\nRaleigh, NC\n\nHighly recommend it!\n\n\"This is the third home we’ve used Invisible Fence at and we highly recommend it! Dylan got the fence installed efficiently, and Matt did a fantastic job of refreshing our dogs’ training, so that they know where the boundaries are, but are comfortable using the rest of the yard. If you’re thinking about Invisible Fence for your yard, you won’t regret it!\"\n\nMichelle O.\n\nOrlando, FL\n\nOutstanding job!\n\n\"Brett did an outstanding job when he visited us! Initially, we believed our collar was malfunctioning, but he quickly identified and repaired a line break. Our dog was corrected and became fearful of the fence, but Cricket took extra time to help him adjust and feel more comfortable. He refused to leave our dog in distress, demonstrating his genuine care for his work and the animals he meets.\"\n\nLaura K.\n\nHarrisburg, NY"
