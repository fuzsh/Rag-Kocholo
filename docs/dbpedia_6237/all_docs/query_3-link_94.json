        "text": "Dennis has a wide variety of community interests and regularly presents stories on everything from farmersâ crops to the events at the Robert H. Jackson Center. Some of his favorite activities to cover involve theater, Jamestown High School Music, and Chautauqua County Four-H.\n\nThrough his many years of work, Dennis has cultivated a keen sense of Jamestown as a communityâ¦ and the mediaâs role in it. He also has developed a speech improvement course, primarily for aspiring young people, but available to anyone for $12.40 per lesson.\n\nThis editor is NOT going to write down all that Dennis had to say, because it was so interesting. Instead, she has decided to let you play the video below and listen to it yourself â that way, you wonât miss a word.\n\nThank you Dennis for a most enlightening program."
