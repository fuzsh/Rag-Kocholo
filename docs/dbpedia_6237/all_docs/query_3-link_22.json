        "text": "The Raider Radio broadcasts live from Fairport High School during the school year. They are a student run and operated, with a faculty advisor.\n\nIf you are interested in starting up a club like that at your Rochester-area school, please contact wber@monroe.edu.\n\nWebster Varsity Radio started on WBER in 2000 and has been going strong ever since. Our club consists solely of seniors who have a serious interest in all types of alternative, indie, rock, electronic and metal music – and we find a way to make it fit into the beautiful diversity that is the WBER catalog. Tune in Monday through Friday to hear some old favorites right alongside your new favorites.\n\nIf you are interested in starting up a club like that at your Rochester-area school, please contact wber@boces.monroe.edu"
