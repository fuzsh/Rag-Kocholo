        "text": "Tina Pamintuan\n\nCEO\n\nTina Lacdao Pamintuan has spent over 20 years in public media as a journalist, educator, and leader. As the CEO of St. Louis Public Radio, she helms the station’s fundraising, operations, programming, and editorial teams. This multifaceted role also includes being the liaison for the station’s FCC license holder, the University of Missouri, and the station’s advisory board, Friends of St. Louis Public Radio.\n\nBefore making the leap to Missouri, Pamintuan made her home in cities along the west and east coasts. In San Francisco, she was the general manager of KALW where she founded the nonprofit KALW Public Media and negotiated a long-anticipated legal agreement with the station’s license holder to operate the station independently from the city. Over a short tenure, she brought the station into labor and FCC compliance and led the station’s first professional rebranding and marketing efforts. She also programmed the station to attract a more diverse and younger listening audience, bringing more BIPOC voices to air both nationally and locally. As part of the station’s new eclectic music initiative, KALW also saw the opening of its first studio in the east bay under her leadership.\n\nIn New York, she created and directed the audio journalism program at The Craig Newmark Graduate School of Journalism at CUNY where she taught radio writing and reporting, news magazine production, audio documentary and oral history. She now enjoys hearing former students on-air reporting from stations across the country, launching their own investigative series and podcasts and producing and hosting for nationally syndicated programs.\n\nIn 2011, Pamintuan traveled to the Philippines on an International Center for Journalists’ fellowship to report on climate change and biofuel use in rural areas. In 2012, she produced an audio documentary on Occupy Wall Street hosted by Alex Chadwick. She’s a former Nieman Visiting Fellow and Scholar-in-Residence at the Tow Knight Center for Entrepreneurial Journalism. In 2015, she organized a seminar on Native American media and community radio for the Radcliffe Institute of Advanced Study at Harvard. She was honored to receive the Philippine American Press Club’s 2019 Ocampo-Henry Memorial Award in Radio, but even more delighted when her mother, who always wanted to become a journalist, accepted the award on her behalf.\n\nPamintuan began her career at National Public Radio after graduating from Georgetown University where she studied philosophy and physics.\n\nRufus Moore\n\nDirector, Sponsorship Sales\n\nPrior to joining St. Louis Public Radio, Rufus Moore worked in business development and sales at several Fortune 500 companies and served in strategic positions at the National level. He has over 20+ years’ experience in sales, sales management, marketing, project management, and strategic planning. Notable is his former years as Regional Business Development for Clear Channel, where he secured major sponsorship and other partnering initiatives.\n\nRufus’ greatest strengths are his creativity, drive and leadership. He thrives on challenges, particularly those that expand the company’s reach and development of people.\n\nRufus serves on several boards as Chair and Co-Chair in his community. He has also been involved in volunteer work for the Y.E.S. Foundation, including heading up the NFL High School Player Development Football Camps in his community, with the F.B.I. citizens academy helping to foster and bridge relationships in the community.\n\nRufus and his wife live in Saint Louis. They have two adult sons and one teenage son. In his free time, Rufus likes to serve the youth sports community, in a mentor, and coach capacity.\n\nMadalyn Painter\n\nDirector of Marketing & Digital Media\n\nAs the Director of Marketing & Digital Media for St. Louis Public Radio, Madalyn Painter works to move audiences to deeper levels of loyalty to our service to the community. She and her team provide targeted marketing, business intelligence, and visual design and support the station’s digital products and strategy.\n\nSince joining KWMU in 2006, she has helped transform stlpublicradio.org into a regional news destination, with well over 500% growth in site visits.\n\nPreviously, she worked in communications and digital media for KETC/Channel 9 (Nine Network of Public Media). She started her career in marketing in 2000 as a copywriter and website designer. Her professional awards include four regional and one national Edward R. Murrow Award.\n\nHer master’s degree in social work, from Saint Louis University, instilled values of collaboration, listening, and evidence-based practice — all surprisingly applicable to marketing. She’s also a proud former English major, with a bachelor’s degree from the University of Missouri-Columbia, and enjoys drawing and poetry.\n\nShe grew up in the forested Ozark mountains and still dreams about moss-covered boulders, cold Bull Creek, and the sound of spring peeper frogs. In the city, she delights in gardens — her own and any others into which she can wander.\n\nBrian Muñoz\n\nPhotojournalist, Interim Digital Editor\n\nBrian Munoz is a photojournalist and multimedia reporter at St. Louis Public Radio. Prior to joining the newsroom, he worked at USA TODAY as a visual storyteller and The Southern Illinoisan as a multimedia correspondent where he covered topics such as social justice, immigration and rural issues.\n\nHis work has appeared in publications such as The New York Times, The Atlantic, The Arizona Republic and The Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting. In addition, his work — both visual and written — has been recognized by several state and national organizations, including being named a 2019 ProPublica Emerging Reporter.\n\nMunoz graduated from Southern Illinois University Carbondale in 2019 with a degree in journalism and while in college, he was a proud member of the Marching Salukis as well as working at the Daily Egyptian — the university’s student newspaper. When he isn’t diving into a good story, you can find him binge-watching sports, creating content in the marching arts and exploring the world of food. You can follow his adventures on Instagram and Twitter at @BrianMMunoz.\n\nJeremy Goodwin\n\nArts & Culture Senior Reporter\n\nJeremy D. Goodwin joined St. Louis Public Radio in spring of 2018 as a reporter covering arts & culture and co-host of the Cut & Paste podcast. He came to us from Boston and the Berkshires of western Massachusetts, where he covered the same beat as a full-time freelancer, contributing to The Boston Globe, WBUR 90.9 FM, The New York Times and NPR, plus lots of places that you probably haven’t heard of.\n\nHe’s also worked in publicity for the theater troupe Shakespeare & Company and Berkshire Museum. For a decade he joined some fellow Phish fans on the board of The Mockingbird Foundation, a charity that has raised over $1.5 million for music education causes and collectively written three books about the band. He’s also written an as-yet-unpublished novel about the physical power of language, haunted open mic nights with his experimental poetry and written and performed a comedic one-man-show that’s essentially a historical lecture about an event that never happened. He makes it a habit to take a major road trip of National Parks every couple of years.\n\nAndrea Henderson\n\nRace, Identity, and Culture Reporter\n\nAndrea Henderson joined St. Louis Public Radio in March 2019, where she covers race, identity and culture. Andrea comes to St. Louis Public Radio from NPR, where she reported for the race and culture podcast Code Switch and produced pieces for All Things Considered. Andrea’s passion for storytelling began at a weekly newspaper in her hometown of Houston, Texas, where she covered a wide variety of stories including hurricanes, transportation and Barack Obama’s 2009 Presidential Inauguration. Her art appreciation allowed her to cover arts and culture for the Houston African-American business publication, Empower Magazine. She also covered the arts for Syracuse’s Post-Standard and The Post and Courier in Charleston, South Carolina.\n\nAndrea graduated from the University of Texas at Arlington with a bachelor’s degree in journalism and earned her master’s degree in arts journalism from Syracuse University. For three years, she served on the board of the Houston Alliance of Fashion and Beauty as the media chair, and she is a member of the National Association of Black Journalists. When the proud Houstonian is not chasing a story, she enjoys catching up on her shows, getting lost in museums and swimming in tropical waters.\n\nFollow her journey through St. Louis via Twitter and Instagram at @drebjournalist.\n\nRachel Lippmann\n\nJustice Correspondent\n\nRachel Lippmann covers courts, public safety and city politics for St. Louis Public Radio. (She jokingly refers to them as the “nothing ever happens beats.”) She joined the NPR affiliate in her hometown in 2008, after spending two years in Lansing covering the Michigan Capitol and various other state political shenanigans for NPR affiliates there. Though she’s a native St. Louisan, part of her heart definitely remains in the Mitten.

She also hosted and produced a weekly podcast sharing the stories behind the region’s food scene.\n\nShe’s been dispatched to cover major news around the country–but is a true Midwesterner, with previous gigs at stations in Indianapolis and Central Illinois.\n\nAbby has been honored with an Emmy Award and multiple Edward R.

But as the oldest child with access to the family video camera it was actually in the late 80’s when Aaron first began playing with video production experimenting with perspective illusions, stop and start techniques and sound effects in homemade videos with siblings and friends. The fun he had as a kid got serious in college when a Practicum in Radio class at UMSL introduced him to the professional world of radio and audio production - right here at 90.7 KWMU.\n\n“It really is exciting” he says talking about the energy of live radio “…it’s like an airplane taking off. You feel all this energy here [in the studio] with all these people running around and figuring things out and you’ve just done mic checks and you’re monitoring air control for the handoff and then you hit the button and give a big [here Aaron raises his hand and with a flourish points forward with a loud whooshing noise]… it’s just fun.” In 2001 Aaron changed his academic focus from art to audio and earned an audio engineering degree from Webster University. Having returned to KWMU to for an internship requirement his graduating year he was hired as part time production assistant in 2004.\n\nA typical shift of St. Louis On The Air sees Aaron, usually working alongside an intern (full circle moment) positioning microphones, cueing the start of the show, balancing audio levels, playing music breaks, airing call-ins, and fading in theme music. And there really are a lot of people in the room: there’s two or three producers monitoring show content, social media engagement, potential podcast excerpts. There’s a call screener too and when the room gets noisy Aaron puts on a (very nice pair of) headphones and zeros in.\n\nPost production duties include editing the show and recording re-takes for the re-air if necessary, recording and uploading promos for the next day’s show, and separating the program into segments for the podcast.\n\nShow inside jokes include yelling “Hit the dump!” when anyone on the air says something that could be construed as vulgar, and “Cue [song name]” when anyone on the air mentions something (even remotely) related to a famous song.\n\nAaron teaches guitar and bass guitar full time from his home studio in the Lindenwood Park neighborhood of south St. Louis city where he also hosts jam sessions for his adult students, live streams improvisational music over NASA tv on twitch, and maintains a growing collection of audio equipment. His wife Amy earned her PhD in Psychology from UMSL in 2010 and their dog Tallis has an adorable instagram account.\n\nNick Garcia\n\nWeekend Announcer\n\nNick Garcia is your weekend evening announcer on 90.7 FM.

Nick’s love for public radio began while listening to Car Talk when driving to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, where he worked during college.\n\nHe also currently works with an agency based in Nashville where he manages social media accounts for Live Nation clubs and theaters across the United States.\n\nNick is a native of North St. Louis County and enjoys playing guitar, taking photographs, seeing live comedy, and taking time to unplug in nature. He’s also a strong believer that one of the day’s important decisions is which vinyl record to play while making breakfast - when he’s not listening to Morning Edition, of course.\n\nRod Milam\n\nPart-Time Announcer\n\nRod Milam is a broadcaster originally from University City, MO.
