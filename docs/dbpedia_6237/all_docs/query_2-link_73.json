        "text": "- BEER 101 -\n\nThe basic ingredients of beer are water; a starch source, such as malted barley, able to be converted to sugar then fermented; a brewer's yeast to produce the fermentation; and a flavoring such as hops. Beer is assessed by bitterness, by strength and by color. The perceived bitterness is measured by the International Bitterness Units scale (IBU). Hops is the sole major contributor to a beer's biterness. Beer ranges from less than 3% alcohol by volume (ABV) to around 14% ABV, though this strength can be increased to around 20%. Beer color is determined by the malt. The most common color is a pale amber produced from using pale malts. Dark beers are usually brewed from a pale malt or lager malt base with a small proportion of darker malt added to achieve the desired shade. Very dark beers, such as stout, use dark or patent malts that have been roasted longer."
