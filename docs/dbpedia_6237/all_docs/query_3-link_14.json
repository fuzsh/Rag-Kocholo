        "text": "Webster (WSYR-TV) - Multiple people, including a firefighter, have been shot at the scene of a fire in the Monroe County Town of Webster.\n\nOur sister station in Rochester, WROC, tells us the firefighter has been taken to a local hospital and is in satisfactory condition.\n\nFire crews responded to the fire on Lake Road around 5:30 a.m. when a gunman opened fire. The suspect is still on the loose and multiple buildings are now burning.\n\nFirefighter, others shot at scene of fire in suburban Rochester - NewsChannel 9 WSYR\n\nThis is a couple of hours old, but just hitting the news sites.\n\n(CNN) -- At least two firefighters were killed when they were shot after arriving to battle a blaze at a house in upstate New York on Monday, officials said.\n\nTwo other firefighters were injured, police in Webster, New York, told reporters.\n\nAuthorities believe someone shot at the firefighters shortly after they exited their vehicles, said Rob Boutillier, fire marshal in the town of Webster, New York.\n\n2 firefighters shot, killed while battling New York blaze - CNN.com\n\nWHAM is reporting that the home is according to public records owned by a person whom spent 17 years in Prison for Manslaughter of his grandmother who lived next door back in 1980. The person completed his parole back in 2006. According to the Press Conference they are looking into if the person set up a trap. Shooter's name is not yet been released.\n\nPolice Chief Gerald Pickering has just announced that the gunman responsible for the shooting was found dead of an apparent gunshot wound outside one of the burning homes, and is believed to have set the fire himself in order to entrap the responders.\n\nOne of the two firefighters killed in the tragedy was a local police lieutenant; the two injured victims are an off-duty police officer from the town of Greece and a Rochester firefighter who volunteers in Webster.\n\nAt least four houses were damaged in the fire. - Gunman Shoots Firefighters Responding to Large Residential Blaze in Western New York [UPDATE x2: Fatalities Reported, Gunman Dead, Fire Was a 'Trap']\n\nThe two fire fighters who were killed at the scene are:\n\nMike Chipperini was not only a West Webster volunteer fire fighter. His full time job was as a Lt. and a 20 year veteran in the Webster Police Department.\n\nFire Dispatcher Tomaz Kaczowka was an employee of Rochester-Monroe County (NY) 9-1-1 as well as a West Webster volunteer.\n\nI knew Mike. Tomaz started at 9-1-1 after I retired.\n\nOne of the injured volunteers was also a full time fire fighter for the City of Rochester.\n\nSeeing some unsubstantiated fluff out there that this is a copycat off a TV show. Maybe, maybe not, but it certainly isn't the first of it's kind.\n\nThere was one in western TN a few years back that was very similar. It seems like I can remember a few others going back farther, but I can't remember the details.\n\nSeeing some unsubstantiated fluff out there that this is a copycat off a TV show.

Shot after arriving on scene of a vehicle fire.\n\nCity of Maplewood - Official Website - Ryan Hummert Memorial Page\n\nMentioning this one cause it's local to me. I'm sure there's many more that we don't hear about, a shame it happens at all.\n\nThe two fire fighters who were killed at the scene are:\n\nMike Chipperini was not only a West Webster volunteer fire fighter.

You sir have my heartfelt condolences and all of the responders, based on the audio I heard, should be congratulated for a very professional, calm, and coordinated response to an unthinkable incident.\n\nJason Low, FF, EMT-A, EMD\n\nRedwood Meadows Emergency Services\n\nRedwood Meadows, Alberta, Canada\n\nAs a volunteer firefighter and 9-1-1 dispatcher myself (who will be working in the dispatch center tonight from 6p-6a), my mind is heavily on this tragedy. You sir have my heartfelt condolences and all of the responders, based on the audio I heard, should be congratulated for a very professional, calm, and coordinated response to an unthinkable incident.\n\nJason Low, FF, EMT-A, EMD\n\nRedwood Meadows Emergency Services\n\nRedwood Meadows, Alberta, Canada\n\nJason,\n\nThank you. I will pass your thoughts on to the 9-1-1 folks down there. I listened to all the tapes and press briefings today, and was also very impressed. I'd like to think that some of the training and dispatcher development I did years ago has trickled down to this generation of 9-1-1 pros.\n\nI am thinking about going back to Rochester after Christmas to be with them for a while.\n\nBest regards!"
