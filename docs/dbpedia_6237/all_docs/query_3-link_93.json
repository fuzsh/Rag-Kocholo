        "text": "WEBSTER, N.Y. (CBSNewYork/AP) -- Police in Webster, N.Y., say the man who lured firefighters to their deaths in a blaze of gunfire left a typewritten note saying he wanted to burn down the neighborhood and \"do what I like doing best, killing people.\"\n\nBut officials said the note did not include a motive for Monday morning's deadly assault.\n\nWebster Police Chief Gerald Pickering said Tuesday 62-year-old ex-convict William Spengler armed himself with three weapons and set his house afire to lure first responders into a death trap.\n\n\"Spengler had armed himself heavily,\" Pickering said.\n\nPolice also said they found human remains in Spengler's home. They believe they are those of his missing 67-year-old sister, Cheryl. However a medical examiner needs to confirm the identity. A friend told the Associated Press Spengler hated his sister.\n\nSpengler killed himself as seven houses burned around him Monday.\n\nSpengler killed volunteer firefighter and police lieutenant Michael Chiapperini, 34, and firefighter Tomasz Kaczowska, 19. He wounded firefighters Joseph Hofsetter and Theodore Scardino, who were both hospitalized in serious condition.\n\nPolice cliff notes of the incident stated that Spengler was using a Bushmaster .223-caliber rifle - the same gun as used by the gunman in the Newtown massacre. He was also armed with a .38 revolver and a shotgun.\n\nOutside the fire station in Webster, flowers and candles are placed in memory of the murdered firefighters as residents in another town are gripped by tragedy, CBS 2's Dick Brennan reported.\n\nPickering said Spengler \"was equipped to go to war.\"\n\nSpengler previously served 17 years for manslaughter in the death of his grandmother. He was jailed until 1998, and on parole until 2006.\n\n(TM and Â© Copyright 2012 CBS Radio Inc. and its relevant subsidiaries. CBS RADIO and EYE Logo TM and Copyright 2012 CBS Broadcasting Inc.
