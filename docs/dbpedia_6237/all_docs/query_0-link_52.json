        "text": "History\n\n103.1 FM first signed on the air in February 1993 as WBSI, broadcasting from studios located on Sunrise Highway in Bay Shore and playing oldies from the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s.[4] The WBSI call letters were dropped only a few months after the station signed on because 106.1 WBLI complained the WBSI call sign was too similar and would cause confusion in the Arbitron ratings.\n\nWBZO â along with WHLI, WKJY, and WWSK â was sold by Barnstable Broadcasting to Connoisseur Media effective July 3, 2012 for $23 million.\n\nOn May 15, 2015, WBZO rebranded as \"103.1 Max FM\".[5]"
