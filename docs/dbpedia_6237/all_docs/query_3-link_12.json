        "text": "Thank you, Pacific Garden Mission, for all the work you’re doing and especially for your program UNSHACKLED! Our family listens to it every day on 102.9 WMHR.\n\n- Syracuse, NY\n\nI listen every night at 11:00 pm to Unshackled. The stories are so convicting to those who are in the same position.\n\n- Winchester, VA\n\nI am an inmate at the OKCJ serving a one-year county jail sentence. I renewed my spirit and mind on June 2018. I am turning 52 years old this month and faithfully seek the Lord every day. Unshackled! is such a treat and blessing, that I weekly look forward to hearing your program.\n\n- Oklahoma, OK\n\nI enjoy the true-life UNSHACKLED! dramas and how the stories are life transforming. Prison is an ugly place and I spend hours on the cubicle floor listening to KHCB Radio.\n\n- Gatesville, TX\n\nThank you for your radio program Unshackled! I’ve been listening to it for years and always look forward to each story when it comes on. Regardless of the generation and people in the stories, it lets me know that God truly does work in people’s lives.\n\n- Silver City, NC\n\nThank you for your service in the Lord. It is awesome how the Lord’s truth comes through you all and you are not afraid to have stories about people who are demonized and set free through Jesus Christ our Lord & Savior. May the Lord always shine through you all and His amazing Love. I thank God for His strength and protection for you all\n\n- Valparaiso, FL\n\nI found Unshackled! one night on FM 89.7 out of Florida. I’m so impressed by this show and your ministry you must be doing something right. My wife and I listen every night. I also love what you have to say before and after the show, I looked you up on line tonight just to check it out, WOW, your work is so good. Thanks for doing such a great job.\n\n- Medford, OR\n\nI love these productions!! My sister and I listen to them all the time and they are so uplifting and encouraging. Thank you for all you do, and I am praying for UNSHACKLED! and PGM.\n\n- Unknown\n\nHow do you do? I look forward to hearing those words! I've been a huge fan of your radio program UNSHACKLED! since I was about 11 years old; I'm now 53. My Mom would leave the radio on all night and I can remember going to sleep listening to the real-life dramas of lives being dramatically changed when people received Jesus Christ as their Savior. Your program puts me right into the lives of people; and, your stories have had a positive effect on my life. This program is better than any television series or any movie that I can think of. I'm praying for you and the lives you have and will touch. Thank you to the Bible Broadcasting Network for making it possible for me to hear your programs.\n\n- Unknown\n\nI love your program UNSHACKLED! I listen all day long on the internet at work and what a blessing they are. Thank you very much for sharing them and for the work you do. I also love the fact that you use KJV.\n\n- Unknown"
