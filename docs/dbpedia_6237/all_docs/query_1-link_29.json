        "text": "My husband & I are big fans of Legends! Even though we donât live in the Rochester area, we are very familiar with it. So, while listening we know the various areas being talked about. We would listen regardless, as the music content & broadcasters (DJsâ) are excellent. The ads are good, too! We like the personal touches given to them. Keep up the great job you all are doing! And, to those who havenât checked this station out yet, why havenât you?! Turn it on and tune in. Youâll be glad you did.\n\nI listen to this station daily. I like how the app plays real-time broadcasting. The problem I have with the app is that it does not support listenersâ requests. In order to get That One Particular Song you would love to hear them play, you have to call the station. I would rather just make a request on the app. Please, developers, hear my plea! Thanks. Love Legends 102.7! Itâs THE BEST in Rochester."
