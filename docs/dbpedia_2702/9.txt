Acacia longifolia is commonly called Caterpillar Mimosa due to the appearance of its flowers clustered in fluffy spikes resembling bright yellow soft and harmless caterpillars. Its other name, Long-leaved Mimosa, refers to the large size of its leaves called phyllodes. It is a small tree or large bush with a wide crown, which flowers in late winter or early spring and retains its foliage all year round. Highly prized in coastal areas for stabilising sandy soils and blocking the wind, it will also thrive as a solitary plant, in a hedge or near a patio. This species is not demanding in terms of soil, resistant to salt spray and summer drought, but sensitive to cold. In cooler regions, it can be grown in a large container that can be overwintered in a bright, frost-free room.

Mimosas should not be confused with the tree we call acacia. They belong to the Fabaceae family, just like alfalfa and lupins. Acacia longifolia is native to the eastern part of Australia, where it can be found on the coast or along watercourses, in sandy or loamy soils. This highly competitive species is now considered invasive in the Var and Alpes-Maritimes regions, where it tends to spread along riverbanks, especially after repeated fires that promote seed germination. An adult specimen can withstand temperatures as low as -8°C (17.6°F). Once well-rooted, it tolerates dry and hot summers well.

This Long-leaved Mimosa develops a short trunk topped with a wider-than-tall, often irregular and very dense canopy. Its growth is fast, reaching around 4.5m (15ft) in height with a spread of 5.5m (18ft). Its bark is dark purple-grey, and its young branches are red. The numerous flower buds appear from late summer. The flowering itself usually takes place in March-April, depending on the climate and weather conditions, and lasts about 3 weeks. The flower buds open into small round flowers, which are clusters of bright lemon-yellow stamens arranged on long 10cm (4in) spikes, solitary or paired at the axils of the leaves located towards the ends of the branches. They are scentless.

Its evergreen foliage consists of large, leathery leaves called phyllodes, which are ovate-lanceolate to linear in shape, alternate, narrow and 5 to 20cm (2 to 8in) long. The lamina is dark green.

When planted in the ground, it can be placed as a solitary specimen, in a hedge, or in a shrub border. In favourable climates, it is often used to create a superb vegetal screen that is very useful for windbreaks, either alone or in the company of olearias, for example. It can be planted as a second row. It pairs well with other exotic shrubs such as Caesalpinia gilliesii, evergreen ceanothus, escallonias, or Grevillea, for example. To accompany its early spring flowering, it can be planted with Prunus triloba, Japanese quinces, or Teucrium fruticans 'Azureum'. It can be grown in a pot, protecting it from winter frosts in a lightly heated greenhouse or conservatory.

Plant in spring, in March or April, in a sunny position (or semi-shaded in warmer regions); autumn planting is reserved for regions with a very mild climate. Rooted in the ground, an adult specimen can withstand temperatures as low as -8°C (17.6°F) at its peak. It is sometimes grafted onto Acacia retinodes, which perishes below -5°C (23°F) if not well protected in winter: surround the rootstock with a thick layer of mulch doubled with a thick winter veil as a precaution. This bush is not demanding in terms of soil type, although it should be sufficiently well-draining. Its preference is for sandy or loamy soils, with deep moisture (along river banks). Once established, it tolerates drought, so watering is not necessary when grown in open ground. Pruning is advised after flowering: shorten the branches that have bloomed by about half their length. This prevents the formation of pods that unnecessarily exhaust the plant and limits seed dispersal.

Mimosa is sensitive to cold; as soon as temperatures approach 0°C (32°F), it is advisable to apply a thick mulch around its base to protect the rootstock and roots, and cover it with a winter veil.

In the case of container cultivation, repot every two years in a large pot in spring. Water regularly, ensuring the root ball does not completely dry out between waterings. In colder regions, it should be overwintered in a bright and cool but frost-free location.

The combination of heat and humidity can promote the sudden and unexplained decline of a seemingly healthy mimosa: in this case, the culprits are either Cylindrocladium, a microscopic fungus that attacks the plant's collar, causing it to turn black, or Phytophthora, which penetrates through the roots and kills the plant within a few days. Mimosas grafted onto Acacia retinodes are well adapted to summer drought and poor, calcareous soils, but they do not tolerate permanently moist soil, especially in hot weather.

Other pests of this mimosa are psyllid (false aphid), frosted leafhopper (Metcalfa pruinosa), and Australian scale insect (Icerya purchasi) which are white, fluffy and cottony. To limit their development, spray with nettle manure or diluted black soap at 5%. Treatment with white oils is also effective. Carry out a daily thorough inspection of the branches, accompanied, if necessary, by manual collection of the scale insects (if you have the courage). The Australian ladybird (Rodolia cardinalis) is highly effective in combating the Australian scale insect.
