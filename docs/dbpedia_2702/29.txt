Introduction

The genus Callicarpa L. was established by Linnaeus (1753), but the family to which it belongs was not defined at that time. Brown (1810) assigned the genus in the family Verbenaceae, which, for decades, was widely recognised by most taxonomists (Endlicher 1836; Schauer 1847; Briquet 1895; Moldenke 1936; Fang 1982; Chen and Michael 1994). However, significant adjustment and delimitation of Lamiaceae and Verbenaceae have been proposed in the past three decades, based on morphological features, especially inflorescence characteristics and molecular systematics (Cantino et al. 1992; Wagstaff and Olmstead 1997; Olmstead et al. 2001; Harley et al. 2004; Ma et al. 2015; Zhao et al. 2021). Consequently, the genus Callicarpa was re-assigned into the Lamiaceae family along with the subfamily Viticoideae and some groups that originally belonged to the family Verbenaceae. Recent molecular phylogenetic studies have further indicated that the genus Callicarpa belongs to the Lamiaceae family, suggesting that it is sister to the endemic Australian subfamily Prostantheroideae, with both groups being early diverging lineages in the family (Mint Evolutionary Genomics Consortium 2018; Zhao et al. 2021). Species delimitation within the genus is typically based on traits, such as life form, number of inflorescence branches, glandular colour, filament length, mode of anther opening, fruit colour and size, as well as presence or absence of stellate hairs (Fang 1982; Chen and Michael 1994).

The genus Callicarpa harbours approximately 140 species and it is distributed in the tropical to temperate Asia, America, Australia, Pacific Islands and Madagascar (Chang 1951; Fang 1982; Chen and Michael 1994; Bramley 2011, 2013; Bramley et al. 2019). A total of 48 species in the genus Callicarpa were catalogued in the Flora of China (Chen and Michael 1994). Later, four new species, including C.hainanensis Z. H. Ma & D. X. Zhang (Ma and Zhang 2012), C.pararubella Qiang Wang (Wang 2019), C.stoloniformis X. X. Su, Z. H. Ma & B. Chen (Ma et al. 2023) and C.liuliana Z. H. Chen, W. Y. Xie & F. Chen (Xie et al. 2023), were reported and a new combination C.subglabra (C. Pei) L. X. Ye & B. Y. Ding was proposed (Ye et al. 2018). Thus, to date, a total of 53 Callicarpa species have been reported to be distributed in China.

For a long time, we have been puzzled by a species of Callicarpa with a quite large population cultivated in Wuhan Botanical Garden, Chinese Academy of Sciences. The species has attracted considerable attention due to features, such as procumbent branches, evergreen leaves, white fruits, scarless nodes and stellate pubescence free fruits. These features make the species distinguishable from any other previously-characterised Callicarpa species. In order to further analyse this species, we reviewed the original records and revisited its original source area in March 2023 in Yongshun, Hunan, China. Species specimens were also collected in December 2023 from Hupingshan, Shimen, Hunan, China. Careful literature review combined with comprehensive morphological and molecular characterisation obviously identified this plant as a new species in the genus Callicarpa from China.
