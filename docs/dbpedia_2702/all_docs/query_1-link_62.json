In the present study of random sampling, a total of 570 species of flowering plants were collected belonging to 370 genera and 105 families, including a few endemic and Red Listed medicinal plants such as Garcinia gummi-gutta (L.) Roxb., Dipterocarpus indicus Bedd., Dysoxylum malabaricum Bedd. ex C.DC., Elaeocarpus tuberculatus Roxb., Hopea canarensis Hole, Calophyllum apetalum Willd., Adenia hondala (Gaertn.) W.J.de Wilde, and Myristica dactyloides Gaertn. Family Leguminosae contributes the maximum number of species (47 species) followed by Rubiaceae (32 species) and Asteraceae (27 species) and Genera Ficus (9 species), Diospyros (8 species) and Syzygium (7 species) are the dominant genera. Trees (185 species) are the dominant species followed by herbs (162 species), climbers (117 species), shrubs (62 species), grasses and sedges (19 species), epiphytes (15 species) and parasites (10 species).\n\nKeywords: Dipterocarpus, endemic, Red Listed medicinal plants.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nTaxonomic studies and floristic explorations can provide efficient and convenient information regarding the nomenclature, distribution and ecology, utility of various plants species, and about an ecosystem. It is estimated that the tropical forests harbor about 70% of living organisms of the whole world, of which roughly 20% of the total are confined as exclusively endemic throughout the tropical forests (Myers 1988).\n\nIndia is one among 18 mega biodiversity nations harboring about 4,381endemic species of flowering plants (Nayar, 1996; Shigwan et al. 2000; Singh et al. 2015). Among 35 global biodiversity hot spots (Mittermeier et al. 2011) identified, India has four; including the Western Ghats, which is the second largest endemic centers in India with 1,273 species (Nayar et al. 2014 a,b).\n\nThe Western Ghats is one of the two high diversity humid tropical forest tracks in India. The most outstanding feature of the Western Ghats is the formation of tropical rain forests along the windward side facing the Arabian Sea. The tropical climate complimented by heavy precipitation from the south-west monsoon and favorable edaphic factors create an ideal condition for the luxuriant growth of plant life, which can be seen only in a few parts of the world (Gadgil 1996). The tropical forests have received much attention in recent years because of their species richness, high standing biomass, and greater productivity (Denslow 1987). A rainforest is a dense, wet, and tropical evergreen ecosystem, high in its level of biodiversity. One among the tropical rainforests of the Western Ghats is found in the Agumbe region.\n\nAccording to the Karnataka State Natural Disaster Monitoring Centre (KSNDMC), Hulikal (442m), located more than 244m below Agumbe (686m) area, has received heavy rainfall (more than 125mm) on an average of 4.6 times a year compared to twice a year in Agumbe during the past decade. The reason for the variation of rainfall in Hulikal is the construction of a reservoir, which has created an anthropogenic impact on the environment and the weather system and that has led to heavy rainfall. There has been a change in the temperature, humidity and soil moisture in Hulikal after the construction of the dam (Prabhu 2011).\n\nAgumbe, the Cherrapunji of the south is famous for its endemic flora and medicinal plants (Sundararaghavan 1970). Hence, the present study was conducted with the intention to report the present status of the flowering plant diversity of this region, as there is no updated account available for this ecologically unique and important region.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\n\nStudy area\n\nThe study area is 568ha of tropical low-land evergreen forest of Agumbe (13.5087°N 75.0959°E) in Shivamogga district of Karnataka, India. Agumbe tropical rain forests are the heart of central Western Ghats with a wide range of species composition and floral distribution. These forests are classified as tropical wet evergreen forests of the Dipterocarpus indicus-Humboldtia brunonis-Poeciloneuron indicum type (Pascal 1988). The mean annual rainfall is 7,620mm (300 inches) and the average temperatures vary between 22.2oC and 23.6oC with an annual average temperature of 23.5oC. Agumbe lies in a hilly, wet region of the Western Ghats with an elevation of 643m (2,250ft), canopy cover of 80–85% and lies in a UNESCO World Heritage Site (UNESCO 2011). According to Champion & Seth’s (1968) classification, Agumbe is an area of “southern tropical wet evergreen forests”. The Agumbe Medicinal Plants Conservation Area (MPCA) was established in 1999 to protect the important medicinal plants of the region (Figure 1).\n\nMethods\n\nThis study was carried out in all the climatic seasons covering Agumbe and Kundadri MPCA, Agumbe Reserve Forest and a few parts of Someshwara Wildlife Sanctuary between 2016 and 2018. The survey was conducted using random sampling methods (Cochran 1977). Plant specimens were collected and identified by using available regional floras (Saldanha & Nicolson 1976; Yoganarasimhan et al. 1981; Saldanha 1984; Gamble 1998; Ramaswamy et al. 2001; Punekar & Lakshminarasimhan 2011; Bhat 2014). Names and families of the plants were updated using The Plant List (www.theplantlist.org) and Herbarium JCB (Rao et al. 2012 (http://florakarnataka.ces.iisc.ac.in/hjcb2)). The herbarium specimens were deposited in the Herbarium, Department of Applied Botany, Kuvempu University, Shivamogga, Karnataka.\n\nRESULTS\n\nA total of 570 species of flowering plants belonging to 370 genera and 105 families occur in the present study area. Among all the flowering plants, trees (185 species) contribute the maximum number followed by herbs (162 species), climbers (117 species), shrubs (62 species), grasses & sedges (19 species), epiphytes (15 species), and parasites (10 species) (Figure 2, Image 1–24). Family Leguminosae (47 species) contributes the maximum number of species followed by Rubiaceae (32 species), Asteraceae (27 species), Acanthaceae (28 species), Apocynaceae (22 species) and so on.\n\nGenus Ficus L., contributing 9 species followed by Diospyros L. with eight species, Syzygium R.Br. ex Gaertn. with seven species, Impatiens L., Solanum L. with six species each. Acacia Mart., Blumea DC., Dendrobium Sw., Garcinia L., Phyllanthus L. Terminalia L. and Senna Mill., with five species each (Figure 3).\n\nAgumbe is the home for numerous endemic plants to the Western Ghats such as Acronychia pedunculata (L.) Miq, Calophyllum apetalum Willd., Dipterocarpus indicus Bedd., Dysoxylum malabaricum Bedd. ex C.DC., Embelia ribes Burm.f., Hopea canarensis Hole, Garcinia gummi-gutta (L.) Roxb., Myristica dactyloides Gaertn., Persea macrantha (Nees) Kosterm., Syzygium gardneri Thwaites, and many were conserved in the reserve forests (RF), Someshwara Wildlife Sanctuary (SWS), and MPCAs.\n\nAmong 185 trees, Leguminosae (45 species), Moraceae (11 species), and Lauraceae (10 species) members were dominant. Distribution wise the members of Dipterocarpaceae, Leguminosae, Ebenaceae and Moraceae were frequent and wide spread and Arenga wightii, Elaeocarpus tuberculatus, Garcinia gummi-gutta, Knema attenuata, Myristica malabarica, Persea macrantha, Poeciloneuron indicum, and Syzygium gardneri were commonly found in the Agumbe rainforests.\n\nThe study revealed the presence of 162 herbaceous species, in which 160 were ground flora. Among them Asteraceae emerged as the dominant family with 27 species followed by Acanthaceae (19 species), Poaceae (17 species), Lamiaceae (11 species), and Leguminosae (11 species). Many of the herbs were used for various medicinal and edible purposes. Some rarely seen plants like Epipogium roseum, a saprophytic land orchid, shows its emergence for only 15 days in a year with beautiful flowers, but vegetative phases are not seen on the ground.\n\nDue to the dense canopy, only a few numbers of shrubs were observed during the present study. A total of 62 shrubs belonging to 25 families and 52 genera were observed. Among them, Rubiaceae and Acanthaceae emerged as dominant families with 10 and seven individuals, respectively. Species like Ardisia solanacea, Atalantia monophylla (respiratory disorders), Gnidia glauca (mumps), Ixora coccinea (fever), Memecylon malabaricum (herpes), Pavetta crassicaulis (wounds), and Thottea siliquosa (dysentry) have medicinal importance ( Udaya 2003). Evergreen forests are also rich in diversity of climbers and the study revealed the presence of a greater diversity of climbers with 117 species belonging to 42 families. Among these Apocynaceae (14), Leguminosae (13), and Convolulaceae (09) were dominant. Most of the climbers occurred in the study area having medicinal value and Marsdenia raziana, Adenia hondala, and Salacia malabarica are listed under Red Listed plants (IUCN 2017). Only 15 species of epiphytes were found in the study area. The majority of the epiphytes belong to Orchidaceae (12), followed by Apocynaceae, Gentianaceae, Gesneriaceae, and Moraceae with one species each,\n\nA total of 10 angiospermic parasites were observed and they were seen on varied host plants such as Terminalia paniculata, Terminalia tomentosa, Olea dioica, and Artocarpus hirsutus. Family Loranthaceae with eight species emerged as the dominant family, followed by Convolvulaceae and Santalaceae with one species each (Annexure 1).\n\nAmong 570 flowering plants, 58 were considered threatened. Some species which are endangered need to be conserved for the future. These threatened species fall under 34 families, where Leguminosae and Dipterocarpaceae have five species each, followed by Lauraceae with four species and are the dominant families (https://www.iucnredlist.org) (Annexure 2).\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nA comparative analysis of tree diversity in the tropical lowland evergreen forests of Agumbe in three one hectare plots displayed the presence of 3,202 live stems representing 125 species of trees in 92 genera and 42 families (Srinivas & Parthasarathy 2000), whereas in the current study, 195 species of trees belonging to 54 families and 137 genera were observed in all the areas of the rain forests of Agumbe.\n\nSpecies diversity and density of all woody climbers (lianas) inventoried in three one-hectare plots in the tropical lowland evergreen forest of Agumbe yielded a total of 1,138 lianas belonging to 40 species (Padaki & Parthasarathy 2000). In the current study, a total of 117 species of climbers were found to occur, of which 59 species were lianas.\n\nA floristic survey carried out in Agumbe MPCA by the FRLHT botanical team reported 371 plant species of which 182 are medicinal.Adenia hondala, Celastrus paniculatus, Garcinia gummi-gutta, Myristica dactyloides, Persia macrantha, and Vateria indica are a few threatened species recorded from this area (Nayar & Sastry 1990). The study also revealed the Agumbe MPCA is a genuine storehouse of floristic diversity. The presence of pure stands of Poeciloneuron indicum is a significant character of this forest (Udayan 2003). But, in the current study the whole area of Agumbe rainforest was enumerated and yielded more momentous results than the other studies.\n\nBhat (2014) explored the floristic wealth of Dakshina Kannada district, observed 1,888 species of flowering plants belonging to 928 genera and 166 families and classified plants according to Angiosperm Phylogeny Group (APG) III. Among 1,273 species of flowering plants endemic to the Western Ghats (Nayar et al. 2014a,b), 195 species and five infra-specific categories occur in the surrounding areas of Dakshina Kannada and Udupi districts. Whereas in our study, we observed 570 flowering plants belonging to 370 genera and 105 families and we classified plants according to APG IV system of classification. The present study revealed the presence of 84 endemic species and 58 threatened plants distributed in the Agumbe region.\n\nMajor threats that are intimidating the diversity and distribution of flowering plants in Agumbe are the illegal collection of non-timber forest products (NTFP) such as: fruits of Garcinia gummi-gutta, G. indica, G. xanthochymus, Elaeocarpus tuberculatus, Diospyros spp., Phyllanthus emblica, Myristica dactyloides, M. malabarica, Syzygium spp., Ficus racemosa, and Strychnos nux-vomica; leaves and bark of Cinnamomum verum, Alstonia scholaris, Saraca asoca and many other species for their therapeutic and marketing value. Even though the forest department is undertaking many conservation efforts, many threatened and endemic plants need more specific conservation plans.\n\nVery few pockets in the Western Ghats have a combination of high rainfall and luxuriant evergreen forests as do the Ghats forests of Agumbe. Some rarely seen plants like Epipogium roseum, a saprophytic land orchid and Marsdenia raziana, Adenia hondala, and Salacia malabarica which are listed as threatened were seen in the present study. Many of the herbs, shrubs, climbers, and trees are used for various medicinal and edible purposes. Medicinal plants and other endemic plants available in the Agumbe region are conserved in the Agumbe and Kundadri MPCAs, Agumbe Reserve Forest and some parts of the Someshwara Wildlife Sanctuary. All these rare plants should be given top priority for their conservation.\n\nFor figures & images - - click here\n\nREFERENCES\n\nBhat, K.G. (2014-).
