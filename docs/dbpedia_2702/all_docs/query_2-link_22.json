        "text": "2.1. Structure Elucidation of Polyalongarins A–D (1–4)\n\nPolyalongarin A (1) was obtained as colorless crystals with specific rotation [α]D25 = –181 (c 0.05, CHCl3). On the basis of the HRESIMS spectrum, polyalongarin A (1) [m/z 566.32658 [M + H]+ (calcd. for C37H44NO4, 566.32649)] complies with the “nitrogen rule”, revealing that 1 is an alkaloid possessing a molecular formula of C37H43NO4 with 17 degrees of unsaturation (DOU). According to 13C NMR and DEPTs spectra, the 37 carbons can be grouped into four methyls, ten methylenes (one nitrogen-containing methylene at δC 41.4 and one dioxymethylene at δC 100.9), four methines (one nitrogen-containing methine at δC 56.3 and one N,O-mixed acetal at δC 93.9), seven olefinic methines, two quaternary carbons, nine sp2 quaternary carbons, and one carboxyl group at δC 171.5. Having determined proton-carbon single bond correlations by HMQC, the planar moiety of 1 was concluded by 2D NMR (1H-1H COSY and HMBC) ( ); thereby, the 1H- and 13C-NMR signals were unequivocally assigned as summarized in .\n\nThe α,β-unsaturated γ-lactone unit was confirmed based on the HMBC correlations for H-14 (δH 5.98 s) and H-16 (δH 6.19 s) extended to C-13 (δC 169.8), C-15 (δC 171.5), and C-16 (δC 93.9), where the characteristic chemical shift value at δC 93.9 (C-16) stands for a strong electron-withdrawing group adjacent to the γ-position of the five-membered ring. Next, a tetramethyl-octahydronaphthalene bicyclic ring (a decalin-derivative) was established by two 1H-1H COSY correlations of H-10/H2-1/H2-2/H-3 and H2-6/H2-7/H-8/CH3-17 alongside the HMBC correlations for the four methyls to their neighbor carbons ( ): CH3-17 (δH 0.79 d, J = 4.5) to C-7, C-8, and C-9; CH3-18 (δH 1.58 s) to C-3, C-4, and C-5; CH3-19 (δH 1.01 s) to C-4, C-5, C-6, and C-10; and CH3-20 (δH 0.78 s) to C-8, C-9, C-10. Given the HMBC cross peaks of H-14/C-12, H-16/C-12, and CH3-20/C-11 and the 1H-1H COSY correlations of H2-11/H2-12, the α,β-unsaturated γ-lactone ring is determined in connection with the tetramethyl-octahydronaphthalene bicyclic ring through a short C2 chain known as a type III clerodane diterpenoid [19]. On the other hand, the remaining twelve olefinic carbons and eleven DOU suggest that the alkaloid portion is made of a five-membered ring structure and two benzene rings. Three correlations of H-5′/H-6′, H-7′/H-8′, and H-10′/H-11′/H-12′/H-13′ were observed in the COSY spectrum of 1, as well as the long range 1H-13C correlations of H-3′/C-1′, C-2′, C-4′, C-5′, C-16′; H-5′/C-3′, C-4′; H-7′/C-4′, C-6′, C-15′, C-16′; H-8′/C-9′, C-10′, C-14′, C-16′; H-10′/C-8′, C-9′, C-14′; H-13′/C-9′, C-14′, C-15′; and H2-17/C-1′ and C-2′ were deduced from the HMBC spectrum. Taken together, a benzylisoquinoline named anonaine [17,18] was determined. Moreover, an unexpected but crucial HMBC correlation of H-16/C-6′, C-7′ was observed, where the strong electron-pulled phenomenon at C-16 resulted from the N atom of anonaine and the carboxyl group. The C-N bond that connects the clerodane and the anonaine thereby brings about the unprecedented hybrid of clerodane–aprophine alkaloid, named polyalongarin A (1) here.\n\nGiven that there are four intriguing but dizzy diastereomers trans–cis (TC), trans–trans (TT), cis–cis (CC), and cis–trans (CT) in the decalin system, the neo- or ent-neo-absolute configurations of clerodanes were determined on the basis of the stereo-configurations of C-5, C-8, C-9, and C-10 [20]. In brief, the absence of NOESY correlations for H-10/CH3-19 but the appearance of that for H-10/H-8 and CH3-17/CH3-19/CH3-20 supports that the clerodane skeleton in compound 1 is a type of TC. The C-7′ in anonaine is usually a R-configuration with a negative optical rotation as seen in previous reports, while the chirality of C-16 is uncertain merely based on the NOESY correlations ( A) of H-16/H-7′/H-8′α and H-16/H-8′β. To resolve this uncertainty, we resorted to X-ray crystallography. The crystals of 1 were grown in a MeOH/CH2Cl2 solvent system and subsequently subjected to X-ray diffraction, whereby the crystal structure undoubtedly depicts the absolute stereochemistry of 1. The ORTEP diagram for the crystal structure of 1 ( B) confirms the TC type configuration of clerodane (neo-TC), namely, the R-configuration of C-16 and the P helical conformation between the five-membered γ-lactone ring and aprophine.\n\nThe framework of polyalongarin B (2) is akin to that of 1, in that both share similar UV, IR, NMR, optical rotation and circular dichroism (CD) spectra. Its molecular formula is C39H49NO5 with 16 DOU according to HRESIMS [m/z 612.36844 [M + H]+ (calcd. for C39H50NO5, 612.36835)]. There are three additional aliphatic methoxy groups with chemical shifts at δH 3.95 (3H, s), 3.70 (3H, s), and 3.92 (3H, s) in 1H-NMR spectrum ( ), whereas the absence of dioxymethylene is observed from 13C-NMR spectrum ( ). In conjunction with HMBC correlations of H2-5′/C-3′ and C-4′; 1′-OMe/C-1′; 2′-OMe/C-2′; and 3′-OMe/C-3′ ( ), 2 was determined to be a clerodane-containing 1′,2′,3′-trimethoxy-aprophine alkaloid similar with 1.\n\nBased on spectroscopic analysis, 3 is likely a clerodane–aprophine alkaloid. As a matter of fact, it is a hydroxylated analog of 2 with molecular formula of C39H49NO6 (16 DOU) derived from HRESIMS [m/z 628.36295 [M + H]+ (calcd. for C39H50NO6, 628.32326)]. Given the absence of 1H-1H COSY fragment of H-10′/H-11′/H-12′/H-13′ and atypical HMBC correlations (H-10′/C-9′, C-11′, C-12′, and C-14′; H-13′/C-9′, C-11′, C-12′, and C-14′; 1′-OMe/C-1′; 2′-OMe/C-2′; and 12′-OMe/C-12′), the chemical entity 3 is determined to be a 1′,2′,12′-trimethoxy-11′-hydroxy-aprophine alkaloid. Given the optical rotation [35.4 (c 0.05, CHCl3)] and the reverse CD curve ( A), 3 is clearly distinct from others [21]. Taking advantage of MMFF94 energy minimization in the Chem3D 16.0 suite [22], the dihedral angle ω16-N,C-16,C-13,C-12 of 3 should be the same no matter the lone pair on the 16-N atom pointing toward the α or β direction. However, the helical conformation of the γ-lactone ring and aprophine is poised in an M-configuration (Figure S1 in the Supporting Information). In the ECD calculation for all possible stereoisomers of 3 ( B), only is 3m-16R (the mirror isomer of 3 with 16R) in line with the experimental CD spectrum of 3 concerning the binary positive [π→π* transitions at 234 and 251 nm] and negative [n→π* transitions at 279 and 303 nm] Cotton effects. Altogether, the most plausible configuration for 3 is 16R, 7’S, ent-neo-TC, not least considering both the NOESY correlations and the absence of NOESY correlations of H-16/H-6′β/H-7′.\n\nSimilarly, polyalongarin D (4) was first analyzed by HRESIMS with m/z 598.35281 [M + H]+ (calcd. for C38H49NO5, 598.35270). On the basis of 1H- and 13C NMR ( ), four methyls at δH 0.75 (d, J = 5.5 Hz), 0.77 (s), 1.00 (s), 1.57 (s), and two sp2 methines at δC 5.16 (br s) and 5.98 (s) were spotted; four olefinic carbons at δC 118.6, 120.1, 144.6, 169.0, and one carboxyl carbon at δC 171.4 were additionally identified, together suggesting that 4 is a cleordane–alkaloid congener with a molecular formula of C38H47NO5 and 16 DOU. Apart from the signals for a typical clerodane, a characteristic AA′XX′ proton system δH 6.90 (d, J = 10.0 Hz), 6.33 (d, J = 10.0 Hz), 6.44 (d, J = 10.0 Hz), and 7.04 (d, J = 10.0 Hz) at the down field indicates two pairs of aromatic ortho-protons, which are further ascertained by HMBC correlations [H-9′ (H-13′)/C-8′, C-10′ (C-12′), C-11′, C-13′ (C-9′), C-14′, and C-15′; and H-10′ (H-12′)/C-9′ (C-13′), C-11′, C-12′ (C-10′) and C-14′]. All together establish a unique spiro conformation. On the other hand, specific sets of cross peaks (H-3′/C-1′, C-2′, C-4′, C-5′, C-16′; H-8′/C-9′, C-13′, C-14′, C-15′, C-16′; 1′-OMe/C-1′; 2′-OMe/C-2′) identified from HMBC spectrum are elucidated, which correlates the alkaloid to a stepharine moiety [23]. Moreover, the optical rotation [–61.0 (c 0.05, CHCl3)] of 4 echoes a similar CD curve in analogy to those of 1 and 2, suggesting the stereochemistry of 4 follows 5R, 8R, 9S, 10R, 16R, and 7′R. Summing up, compound 4 is a new type of hybrid featuring an unusual chemical architecture of a clerodane–proaporphine alkaloid."
