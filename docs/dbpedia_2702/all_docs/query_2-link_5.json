        "text": "Passiflora incarnata, Nymphaea odorata, Chamaecrista fasciculata, Asclepius incarnata!\n\nSounds like spells from the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, doesn’t it?\n\nWhile these words could come tumbling out of the mouths of Harry Potter and compatriots, wands waving majestically in the air, they are from another kingdom with its own lore, language, and magic, i.e., Kingdom Plantae. Knowing the scientific names of plants can help you explore this kingdom.\n\nThe lore behind plant classification and names\n\nAs it seems to be human nature to want to put order to things, Ancient Greek and Roman scholars sought to bring some order to understanding of the plant kingdom by recording plant names. The names were copied over and over by hand until the printing press was invented.\n\nMore formal systems for naming and describing plants emerged during the 17th century. Unfortunately, some of these names were rather lengthy, e.g. Plantago foliis ovato-lanceolatus pubescentibus, spica cylindrica, scapo tereti for what is commonly known as hoary plantain. Doesn’t exactly roll off the tongue, does it?\n\nEnter Carl Linnaeas, the son of a minister in southern Sweden who was captivated by plants at an early age. His studies culminated in him becoming a physician as well as earning a doctorate in biology. After years of exploration and research, Linnaeas developed a binomial or two-name system for plants published as Species Plantarum in 1753.\n\nAt 1,200 pages and documenting 7,300 plant species, it became the bedrock of the modern plant taxonomy system. It was written in Latin, the language of science at that time, which was used across Europe and could be shared more broadly than if he wrote in Swedish.\n\nAs science and technology evolved, changes have been made to the Linnaean system. For example, as genetics developed, plants were named and grouped based on genetic similarities rather than just how they looked. Some plant names were changed as a result. However, some historical names were retained despite spelling or other errors because of the disruption that would likely ensue by changing them.\n\nFast forward from Linnaeas’ compilation of 7,300 plant species to what’s currently estimated to be 300,000 to 400,000 different plant species. The scientific names for all these plants weren’t up to the seed companies or plant nurseries to decide. That responsibility fell to the International Botanical Congress which first met in 1864.\n\nEvery six years, botanists from IBC meet in a rotation of continents to formally recognize plant names and revise others. Their published report is titled the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants (ICN or ICNafp). The most recent congress was held in Shenzhen in 2017, resulting in what’s known as the Shenzhen Code 2018. The 2024 meeting will be held this July in Madrid.\n\nBreaking the Shenzhen Code\n\nLet’s look at the formula botanists use to establish scientific plant names.\n\nLiving things are categorized from the general to the specific. Within Kingdom Plantae, the more specific categories of family, genus, and species are of most interest to gardeners. Suffice it to say that plant families also have scientific names for the groupings of grasses, legumes, roses, gourds, nightshades, etc., and these family names end in “eae.”\n\nThe final two categories, genus and species, are the focus of the binomial plant name system. A genus is a group of species with similar characteristics of structure or genetics. A genus can contain a single species, i.e., Gingko, or more than a hundred, Rosa. A species is a group of individuals who can reproduce with one another to produce viable offspring. Genus and species names are always in italics when typed and underlined when handwritten.\n\nGenus is the first name and is always capitalized, e.g., Quercus is the genus name for oak.\n\nSpecific epithet or species is the second name and is usually lower case, e.g., Quercus alba for white oak includes alba, meaning white. Species is abbreviated as sp (singular) or spp (plural).\n\nSubspecies or subsp. are names for plants that have evolved somewhat differently in different geographic areas.\n\nVariety, var or v. is a species subcategory that has naturally mutated to develop differences that are inherited in the next generation, e.g., Quercus alba var. Bicolor for the swamp white oak.\n\nCultivar, or cv is a plant that has been asexually cloned or intentionally bred to form a manmade version of the species e.g., Quercus alba elongata.\n\nf. in a name designates a minor different form in the species.\n\nA hybrid plant is indicated by an “x” between two species, e.g. Quercus x bimundorum is a hybrid of a white oak and an English oak.\n\nWho, what, and where has inspired plant names?\n\nThe exotic sound and form of the names really make them seem magical. Some names are Latin, many are Latin-like or from other sources altogether. The following sampling of just a few plant names demonstrates the wide-ranging inspiration.\n\nMany plant names have been drawn from other languages or literature. For example, Adonis and Achillea (from Achilles) come from ancient mythology. Ackama is a Maori word. Adenia is Arabic. Ajania is Russian. Aucuba and Akebia are Japanese. Amaryllis was a Greek shepherdess in ancient poetry. That’s just some of the “A” plant names! There’s even a bit of whimsy, e.g., Echinacea came from Greek for hedgehog because of the flower’s spiny center.\n\nSome names describe an aspect of a plant like its flowers, leaves, fruit, seeds, bark, size, shape, color, texture, or scent. Acacia is Greek for sharp point. In addition to words, prefixes and suffixes are used as descriptors. Melaleuca has the prefix for black, mela. A plant with long leaves might be called longifolia that contains the suffix for leaves, folia. Callicarpa americana (beautyberry) contains calli meaning beautiful and carpa meaning fruit. The ending “oides” means like, e.g., Leptospermum arachnoides would mean like a spider.\n\nSpecies names can also derive from places or habitats, e.g. Casuarina littoralis = coast or edge, Lomandra fluviatilis = river.\n\nSome names are commemorative or eponymic, e.g., Buddleja (common name butterfly bush) was given its scientific name by Linnaeas for a friend, Reverend Buddle. Zinnia was named after Johann Zinn, a German botanist. Hosta was named after an Austrian botanist, Nicolas Host.\n\nFor a deep dive into information about the origins of plant names, check out works like Stearn’s \"Dictionary of Plant Names for Gardeners\" by William T. Stearn, Ross Bayton’s \"The Gardener’s Botanical,\" Lotte Burkhardt’s \"Index of Eponymic Plant Names,\" Allen Coombes’ \"The A to Z of Plant Names,\" and David Gledhill’s \"Names of Plants.\"\n\nHow DO scientific names help gardeners?\n\nThe scientific or botanical names assures accurate plant identification regardless of the common name in a particular region or country. For example, a buttercup can refer to several different species, but the scientific name Ranunculus refers to a specific plant.\n\nWhen you know the scientific name of a plant you know for sure what you’re buying or growing and what to expect from it. You can also confidently care for it.\n\nA plant’s scientific name can tell you it is similar to others if they are from the same family or genus. That can help in planning the garden. Plants from the Fabaceae family take oxygen from the air and incorporate it into the soil.\n\nKnowing that scientific name can help select plants that will enrich your soil. Plants from the Solanaceae family are prone to nematodes. Knowing that scientific name can help planning crop rotation, so you don’t expose new plants to soil that held plants previously afflicted. Common names don’t tell you that.\n\nScientific names also allow us to “talk plants” with other gardeners, kind of a secret handshake of shared appreciation and understanding.\n\nRemembering scientific plant names\n\nWhile it might be helpful to have Sheldon Cooper’s eidetic memory, there are some tricks and tools to help recall and use scientific plant names.\n\nUnderstanding the origins of the name can sometimes help to make mental associations that make recall easier. Many English words derive from Greek and Latin and that may help in learning and remembering.\n\nRepetition aids memory, e.g., when researching a plant or talking with fellow gardeners, using scientific names will help consolidate them into memory.\n\nUK botanist, Mike Baldwin, recommends mnemonic devices, e.g. Catalpa can be broken down into cat climbing the alps because the catalpa has triangular leaves. Creating a story associated with the plant name also helps, e.g., remembering that the Buddleja was named for a “bud” of Linnaeas. It doesn’t necessarily have to make botanical sense. The goal is to provide some kind of context to help recall the name.\n\nIf you're looking for a structured method to memorize plant names, consider exploring various free apps available for desktop and mobile devices. Utilizing principles from cognitive science, these apps employ active recall testing and spaced repetition techniques through flashcards containing images of plants alongside their corresponding names.\n\nHopefully this information helps to convince you that you don't need a magic wand to learn and use scientific plant names. In fact, there are some websites available where you can create your own imaginative plant names. While these names may not be officially recognized by the IBC, the process can be a lot of fun!\n\nMary Janik is a Master Gardener Volunteer with UF/IFAS Leon County Extension, an Equal Opportunity Institution.
