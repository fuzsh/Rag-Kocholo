        "text": "Medicinal plants are a primary source of organic compounds, both for their medicinal and physiological effects, and for the industrial organic synthesis of a vast array of organic chemicals.[1] Many hundreds of medicines are derived from plants, both traditional medicines used in herbalism[2][3] and chemical substances purified from plants or first identified in them, sometimes by ethnobotanical search, and then organic synthesis for use in modern medicine such as aspirin, taxol, morphine, quinine, reserpine, colchicine, digitalis and vincristine.\n\nPlants used in herbalism include Ginkgo biloba, echinacea, feverfew, and Saint John's wort.\n\nThe pharmacopoeia of Dioscorides, De Materia Medica, describing some 600 medicinal plants, was written between 50 and 70 AD and remained in use in Europe and the Middle East until around 1600 AD; it was the precursor of all modern pharmacopoeias.[4][5][6]\n\nAll plants produce chemical compounds which give them an evolutionary advantage, such as defending against herbivores or, in the example of salicylic acid, as a plant hormone in plant defenses.[7][8] These phytochemicals have potential for use as drugs, and the content and known pharmacological activity of these substances in medicinal plants is the scientific basis for their use in modern medicine, if scientifically confirmed.[9] For instance, daffodils (Narcissus) contain nine groups of alkaloids including galantamine, licensed for use against Alzheimer's disease. The alkaloids are bitter-tasting and toxic, and concentrated in the parts of the plant such as the stem most likely to be eaten by herbivores; they may also protect against parasites.[10][11][12]\n\nMain article: Remedy/Plants/Fabaceae\n\nMain article: Remedy/Plants/Asteraceae\n\nFamily: Actinidiaceae.\n\nKiwifruit seed oil contains on average 62% alpha-linolenic acid, an omega-3 fatty acid.[13] Kiwifruit pulp contains carotenoids, such as provitamin A beta-carotene,[14] lutein and zeaxanthin.[15]\n\nFruit Nutritional value Second fruit Nutritional value Zespri SunGold kJ=262 fuzzy fruit kJ = 255 Zespri SunGold water=82 g fuzzy fruit 83 g Zespri SunGold protein=1.02 g fuzzy fruit protein=1.14 h Zespri SunGold fat=0.28 g fuzzy fruit fat=0.52 g Zespri SunGold carbs=15.8 g fuzzy fruit carbs=14.66 g Zespri SunGold fiber=1.4 g fuzzy fruit fiber=3 g Zespri SunGold sugars=12.3 g fuzzy fruit sugars=8.99 g Zespri SunGold calcium_mg=17 fuzzy fruit calcium_mg=34 Zespri SunGold iron_mg=0.21 fuzzy fruit iron_mg=0.31 Zespri SunGold magnesium_mg=12 fuzzy fruit magnesium_mg=17 Zespri SunGold manganese_mg=0.048 fuzzy fruit manganese_mg=0.098 Zespri SunGold phosphorus_mg=25 fuzzy fruit phosphorus_mg=34 Zespri SunGold potassium_mg=315 fuzzy fruit potassium_mg=312 Zespri SunGold sodium_mg=3 fuzzy fruit sodium_mg=3 Zespri SunGold selenium_ug=0.4 fuzzy fruit selenium_ug=0.2 Zespri SunGold zinc_mg=0.08 fuzzy fruit zinc_mg=0.14 Zespri SunGold copper_mg=0.151 fuzzy fruit copper_mg=0.13 Zespri SunGold vitA_ug= fuzzy fruit vitA_IU= Zespri SunGold vitC_mg=161.3 fuzzy fruit vitC_mg=92.7 Zespri SunGold thiamin_mg=0 fuzzy fruit thiamin_mg=0.027 Zespri SunGold riboflavin_mg=0.074 fuzzy fruit riboflavin_mg=0.025 Zespri SunGold niacin_mg=0.231 fuzzy fruit niacin_mg=0.341 Zespri SunGold pantothenic_mg=0.12 fuzzy fruit pantothenic_mg=0.183 Zespri SunGold vitB6_mg=0.079 fuzzy fruit vitB6_mg=0.063 Zespri SunGold folate_ug=31 fuzzy fruit folate_ug=25 Zespri SunGold vitB12_ug=0.08 fuzzy fruit vitB12_ug=0 Zespri SunGold choline_mg=1.9 fuzzy fruit choline_mg=7.8 Zespri SunGold lutein_ug=24 fuzzy fruit lutein_ug=122 Zespri SunGold vitE_mg=1.4 fuzzy fruit vitE_mg=1.46 Zespri SunGold vitK_ug=6.1 fuzzy fruit vitK_ug=40.3 sourceusda =link to USDA Database entry\n\nRaw kiwifruit contains actinidain (also spelled actinidin) which is commercially useful as a meat tenderizer[16] and possibly as a digestive aid.[17]\n\nFamily: Ranunculaceae\n\nThe plant is poisonous, containing cardiostimulant compounds, such as adonidin and aconitic acid.[18] In addition, it is often used as an ornamental plant.[19] Infusions of the plant are used in the medicine Bekhterev's mixture.[20]\n\nDue to the cardiac-enhancing effects of Adonis species (including Adonis vernalis), this plant has a history of use in European and Chinese folk medicine.[21] This plant has been utilized for many different issues and health problems. The local people of the Soviet Union at one point used it to treat edema or swelling in the body, and an ethanolic extract of the aerial parts of the plant were prepared as an alternative cardiac agent.[21] In 1879, a Russian medical doctor, N. O. Buhnow, first introduced into medicine alcoholic extracts of the plant as a cardiac stimulant.[22] In 1898, a mixture of the plant extracts with sodium bromide or codeine was suggested (by Vladimir Bekherev) to treat heart diseases, panic disorder, dystonia and mild forms of epilepsy.[22] Aqueous infusions of the aerial parts of the plant have been traditionally used in Siberia against edema, cardiac edema and several other issues that are heart related, kidney diseases, and even malaria.[22] The biological activity of this extract was defined as 50–66 frog units (amount or liquid of substance that causes the arrest of the heart of a frog) and 6.3–8.0 cat units (amount or liquid of substance that causes the arrest of the heart of a cat) and large enough doses can be toxic.[22]\n\nThere are many phytochemicals that come from the plant Adonis vernalis and these include cardiac glycosides, other glycosides, and flavones. The compounds that are cardiac glycosides include Cymarin, Adonitoxin, 16-Hydroxy-strophanthidin, Acetyladonitoxin, Vernadigin, 3-Acetylstrophagogenin, Substance N, Strophanthidine fucoside, 3-Epi-periplogenin, 17β-(2’,5’-dihydro-5’-oxo-3’-furyl)-5β-14β-androstane-3α,5β,14β-triol, Adonitoxigenin 2-O-acetylrhamnosidoxyloside, Adonitoxigenin 3-O-acetylrhamnosidoxyloside, Adonitoxigenin rhamnosidoxyloside, Adonitoxigenin 3-O-[β-D-glucopyranosyl-(1→4)-α-L-rhamnopyranoside, Adonitoxigenin 3-O-[β-D-glucopyranosyl-(1→4)-α-L-(3’-O-acetyl)-rhamnopyranoside, Adonitoxigenin-3-[O-α-L-(2’-O-acetyl) rhamnosido-β-D-glucoside, Digitoxigenin. Other glycosides include Adonilide, Fukujusonorone, Fukujusone, 12-O-Nicotinoylisolineolon (Lineolon), 12-O-Benzoylisolineolon, Nicotinoylisoramanone, and Isoramanone (digipurprogenin-II). Flavones include Adonivernith (luteolin-8-hexityl monoxyloside), Homoadonivernith, Orientin, Homoorientin, Isoorientin, Luteolin, and Vitexin.[21]\n\nThe plant contains cardiac glycosides, and these improve the heart's efficiency by increasing its output at the same time as slowing down its rate.[23] These glycosides also have a sedative effect and is often prescribed to patients whose hearts are beating irregularly or at an increased rate.[24] Tinctures of Adonis vernalis are also used by homeopathic physicians in patients that are suffering from congestive cardiac failure and its action is very similar to digitalis (another drug that stimulates the heart muscle).[25] Aqueous extracts of Adonis vernalis were found to have cardiac stimulant effects on isolated heart preparations and it also showed that production of excessive and high potassium concentrations protects against heart failure.[26] Not only are cardiac glycosides derived from this plant but there are also some well-known flavones that were identified with pharmacological activities, including antioxidant, antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, neuro and cardioprotective, and anti-allergic properties.[21]\n\nFamily: Asphodelaceae.\n\n\"Antidiabetic effects of dietary administration of Aloe arborescens Miller components on multiple lowdose streptozotocin-induced diabetes in mice.\"[27]\n\nFamily: Asphodelaceae.\n\nAloe vera leaves contain phytochemicals under study for possible bioactivity, such as acetylated mannans, polymannans, anthraquinone C-glycosides, anthrones, and other anthraquinones, such as emodin and various lectins.[28][29]\n\nFor people with allergies to Aloe vera, skin reactions may include contact dermatitis with hives, mild redness and itching, difficulty with breathing, or swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat.[30][31][32]\n\n\"Aloe vera could serve as a natural antihistamine herb. The antihistamine properties of aloe could be attributed, at least in part, to the presence of glycoprotein alprogen which has been demonstrated to antigen-antibody-mediated release of histamine and leukotriene from mast cells (45).\"[33]\n\n\"Aloe vera contains alprogen as one of the active compound that works by inhibition the absorption of glucose in the digestive tract so that it can reduce blood glucose levels.\"[34]\n\nActive components present in Aloe vera with properties[27] Name of the Active component Active components present in Aloe Vera with properties Vitamins Vitamin A (beta-carotene), C and E, - antioxidants.

The cashew seed is commonly considered a snack nut (cashew nut) eaten on its own, used in recipes, or processed into cashew cheese or cashew butter.[37]\n\nRaw cashews are 5% water, 30% carbohydrates, 44% fat, and 18% protein (table). In a 100 gram reference amount, raw cashews provide 553 Calories, 67% of the Daily Value (DV) in total fats, 36% DV of protein, 13% DV of dietary fiber and 11% DV of carbohydrates.[38] Cashews are rich sources (20% or more of the DV) of dietary minerals, including particularly copper, manganese, phosphorus, and magnesium (79-110% DV), and of thiamin, vitamin B6 and vitamin K (32-37% DV) (table).[38] Iron, potassium, zinc, and selenium are present in significant content (14-61% DV) (table).[38] Cashews (100 grams, raw) contain 113 milligrams (1.74 gr) of beta-sitosterol.[38]\n\nCashew nut oil is a dark yellow oil derived from pressing the cashew nuts (typically from lower value broken chunks created accidentally during processing), and is used for cooking or as a salad dressing, where the highest quality oil is produced from a single cold pressing.[39]\n\nFamily:Ericaceae.\n\nThe plant contains diverse phytochemicals, including ursolic acid, tannic acid, gallic acid, some essential oils and resin, hydroquinones (mainly arbutin, up to 17%), tannins (up to 15%), phenolic glycosides and flavonoids.[40] Arctostaphylos uva-ursi leaves contain arbutin,[41][42] which metabolizes to form hydroquinone, a potential [hepatotoxic (liver toxin).[42][43]\n\nArgemone mexicana (Mexican poppy,[44] Mexican prickly poppy, flowering thistle,[45]) is of the family Papaveraceae.\n\nBerberine is a found in Argemone mexicana (prickly poppy).\n\nArgemone mexicana seeds contain 22–36% of a pale yellow non-edible oil, called argemone oil or katkar oil, which contains the toxic alkaloids sanguinarine and dihydrosanguinarine.\n\nFour quaternary isoquinoline alkaloids, dehydrocorydalmine, jatrorrhizine, columbamine, and oxyberberine, have been isolated from the whole plant of Argemone mexicana.[46] Many other alkaloids such as argemexicaines A and B, coptisine, cryptopine, allocryptopine and chelerythrine have also been found in this plant.[47]\n\nThe seed pods secrete a pale yellow latex when cut open. This argemone resin contains berberine and protopine.\n\nFamily: Brassicaceae.\n\nThe family Brassicaceae includes mustard, wasabi, broccoli, cabbage, and radish.\n\nThe leaves of the plant are edible, either cooked or raw when young.[48]\n\nAllyl isothiocyanate is an unstable compound, degrading over the course of days at 37 °C (99 °F).[49]\n\nHorseradish contains volatile oils, notably mustard oil.[50]\n\nMain article: Remedy/Plants/Asteraceae\n\nMain article: Remedy/Plants/Asteraceae\n\nMain article: Remedy/Plants/Asteraceae\n\nFamily: Microcoleaceae\n\nA dietary supplement is made from A. platensis and A. maxima, known as spirulina.[51]\n\nArthrospira is very rich in proteins,[51][52] and constitute 53 to 68 percent by dry weight of the contents of the cell.[53]\n\nIts protein harbours all essential amino acids.[52] Arthrospira also contain high amounts of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), about 1.5–2 percent, and a total lipid content of 5–6 percent.[52] These PUFAs contain the γ-linolenic acid (GLA), an omega-6 fatty acid.[54] Further contents of Arthrospira include vitamins, minerals and photosynthetic pigments.[52]\n\nMain article: Remedy/Plants/Fabaceae\n\nFamily: Meliaceae.\n\n\"Nimbidin, Azadirachtin and nimbinin are active compounds present in Neem which are responsible for antibacterial activity.\"[55]\n\n\"The phytochemical constituents present in neem are nimbidin, nimbin, nimbolide, Azadirachtin, gallic acid, epicatechin, catechin, and margolone.\"[55]\n\n\"From nimbidin other active constituents like nimbin, nimbinin, nimbidinin, nimbolide and nimbidic acid have been isolated which are responsible for its biological activities.[16]\"[55]\n\n\"Mucoadhesive dental gel containing Azadirachta indica is found to be beneficial in reducing the plaque index and salivary bacterial count comparatively better than chlorhexidine gluconate mouthwash.[33]\"[55]\n\nFamily Plantaginaceae.\n\nBacopa monnieri is used in Ayurveda (Ayurvedic traditional medicine) to improve memory and to treat various ailments.[56] Reviews of preliminary research found that Bacopa monnieri may nootropic (improve cognition),[56][57] although the effect was measurable only after several weeks of use.[58]\n\nIn 2019, the FDA issued warning letters to manufacturers of dietary supplements containing Bacopa monnieri that advertised health claims for treating or preventing stomach disease, Alzheimer's disease, hypoglycemia, blood pressure, and anxiety were unproven and illegal. The FDA stated that Bacopa monnieri products have not been approved for these or any medical purposes.[59][60][61]\n\nThe most commonly reported adverse effects of Bacopa monnieri in humans are nausea, increased intestinal motility, and gastrointestinal upset.[56]\n\nThe best characterized phytochemicals in Bacopa monnieri are dammarane-type triterpenoid saponins known as bacosides, with jujubogenin or pseudo-jujubogenin moieties as aglycone units.[62] Bacosides comprise a family of 12 known analogs.[63] Other saponins called bacopasides I–XII were identified.[64] The alkaloids brahmine, nicotine, and herpestine have been catalogued, along with D-mannitol, apigenin, hersaponin, monnierasides I–III, cucurbitacin and plantainoside B.[65][66][67]\n\nFamily Berberidaceae.\n\nBerberine is a quaternary ammonium salt from the protoberberine group of benzylisoquinoline alkaloids found in Berberis aristata (tree turmeric).[68]\n\nThe root bark contains the bitter alkaloid berberine, which has been studied for its potential pharmacological properties.[69]\n\nThe dried fruit of Berberis vulgaris (barberry) is used in herbal medicine.[70] The chemical constituents include isoquinolone alkaloids, especially berberine, with a full list of phytochemicals compiled.[71]\n\nFamily: Bixaceae.\n\nBixin is the major apocarotenoid of annatto[72]\n\nThe yellow to orange color is produced by the chemical compounds bixin (orange) and norbixin (yellow), which are classified as carotenoids, where the fat-soluble color in the crude extract is called bixin, which can then be saponified into water-soluble norbixin, with the dual solubility property of annatto being rare for carotenoids.[73] The seeds contain 4.5–5.5% pigment, which consists of 70–80% bixin.[72] Unlike beta-carotene, another well-known carotenoid, annatto-based pigments are not vitamin A precursors.[74]\n\nAnnatto oil is also rich in tocotrienols, beta-carotene, essential oils, saturated and unsaturated fatty acids, flavonoids, and vitamin C.[75]\n\nBixa orellana is used in traditional medicine.[76][77] The tree has been used in Ayurveda, the folk medicine practices of India, where different parts of the plant are thought to be useful as therapy.[78]\n\nFamily: Burseraceae.\n\nBoswellia sacra (commonly known as frankincense or olibanum-tree)[79] is a tree, the primary tree in the genus Boswellia from which frankincense, a resinous dried sap, is harvested and is native to the Arabian Peninsula (Oman, Yemen), and horn of Africa (Somalia).[79]\n\n\"The [essential] oil of [Boswellia sacra] contains a high proportion of monoterpenes (97.3%) in which E-β-ocimene and limonene were the major constituents.

Extracts are sold over the counter in liquid, powder, capsule, and tablet forms,[92][97] and may contain up to 17.4% of their total weight in caffeine,[98] though decaffeinated versions are also available.[99]\n\nNumerous claims have been made for the health benefits of green tea, but human clinical research has not found good evidence of benefit.[100][95][101] In 2011, a panel of scientists published a report on the claims for health effects at the request of the European Commission: in general they found that the claims made for green tea were not supported by sufficient scientific evidence.[95] Although green tea may enhance mental alertness due to its caffeine content, there is only weak, inconclusive evidence that regular consumption of green tea affects the risk of cancer or cardiovascular diseases, and there is no evidence that it benefits weight loss.[100]\n\nA 2020 review by the Cochrane Collaboration listed some potential adverse effects including gastrointestinal disorders, higher levels of liver enzymes, and, more rarely, insomnia, raised blood pressure, and skin reactions.[102]\n\nResearch has shown there is no good evidence that green tea helps to prevent or treat cancer in people.[102]\n\nThe link between green tea consumption and the risk of certain cancers such as stomach cancer and non-melanoma skin cancers is unclear due to inconsistent or inadequate evidence.[103][104]\n\nGreen tea interferes with the chemotherapy drug bortezomib (Velcade) and other boronic acid-based proteasome inhibitors, and should be avoided by people taking these medications.[105]\n\nObservational studies found a minor correlation between daily consumption of green tea and a 5% lower risk of death from cardiovascular disease. In a 2015 meta-analysis of such observational studies, an increase in one cup of green tea per day was correlated with slightly lower risk of death from cardiovascular causes.[106] Green tea consumption may be correlated with a reduced risk of stroke.[107][108] Meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials found that green tea consumption for 3–6 months may produce small reductions (about 2–3 mm Hg each) in systolic and diastolic blood pressures.[108][109][110][111] A separate systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials found that consumption of 5-6 cups of green tea per day was associated with a small reduction in systolic blood pressure (2 mmHg), but did not lead to a significant difference in diastolic blood pressure.[112]\n\nGreen tea consumption lowers fasting glucose (fasting blood sugar) but in clinical studies the beverage's effect on hemoglobin A1c and fasting insulin levels was inconsistent.[113][114][115]\n\nDrinking green tea or taking green tea supplements decreases the blood concentration of total cholesterol (about 3–7 mg/dL), low density lipoprotein (LDL cholesterol) (about 2 mg/dL), and does not affect the concentration of high density lipoprotein (HDL cholesterol) or triglycerides.[112][113][116] A 2013 Cochrane meta-analysis of longer-term randomized controlled trials (>3 months duration) concluded that green tea consumption lowers total and LDL cholesterol concentrations in the blood.[113]\n\nA 2015 systematic review and meta-analysis of 11 randomized controlled trials found that green tea consumption was not significantly associated with lower plasma levels of C-reactive protein levels (a marker of inflammation).[117]\n\nThere is no good evidence that green tea aids in weight loss or weight maintenance.[100][118]\n\nExcessive consumption of green tea extract has been associated with hepatotoxicity and liver failure.[119][120][121] In 2018, a scientific panel for the European Food Safety Authority reviewed the safety of green tea consumption over a low-moderate range of daily EGCG intake from 90 to 300 mg per day, and with exposure from high green tea consumption estimated to supply up to 866 mg EGCG per day.[122] Dietary supplements containing EGCG may supply up to 1000 mg EGCG and other catechins per day.[122] The panel concluded that EGCG and other catechins from green tea in low-moderate daily amounts are generally regarded as safe, but in some cases of excessive consumption of green tea or use of high-EGCG supplements, liver toxicity may occur.[122]\n\nMain article: Remedy/Plants/Fabaceae\n\nMain article: Remedy/Plants/Fabaceae\n\nMain article: Remedy/Plants/Asteraceae\n\nFamily: Gigartinaceae.\n\nC. crispus is an industrial source of carrageenan commonly used as a thickener and stabilizer in milk products, such as ice cream and processed foods.[123]\n\nCarrageenan, E407 or E407a, may be used as a thickener in calico printing and paper marbling, and for fining beer.[123][124] Irish moss is frequently used with Mastocarpus stellatus (Gigartina mamillosa), Chondracanthus acicularis (G. acicularis), and other seaweeds, which are all commonly found growing together.

The kenaf seed oil is also used for cosmetics, industrial lubricants and for biofuel production. Kenaf oil is high in omega polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). Kenaf seed oil contains a high percentage of linoleic acid (Omega-6) a polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA). Linoleic acid (C18:2) is the dominant PUFA, followed by oleic acid (C18:1). Alpha-linolenic acid (C18:3) is present in 2 to 4 percent.\n\nKenaf seed oil is 20.4% of the total seed weight, similar to that of cotton seed.\n\nKenaf Edible Seed Oil Contains:\n\nPalmitic acid: 19.1%\n\nOleic acid: 28.0% (Omega-9)\n\nLinoleic acid: 45% (Omega-6)\n\nStearic acid: 3.0%\n\nAlpha-linolenic acid: 3% (Omega-3)\n\nThe Hibiscus leaves are a good source of polyphenolic compounds. The major identified compounds include neochlorogenic acid, chlorogenic acid, cryptochlorogenic acid, caffeoylshikimic acid and flavonoid compounds such as quercetin, kaempferol and their derivatives.[179] The flowers are rich in anthocyanins, as well as protocatechuic acid. The dried calyces contain the flavonoids gossypetin, hibiscetine and sabdaretine. The major pigment is not daphniphylline.[180] Small amounts of myrtillin (delphinidin 3-monoglucoside), chrysanthenin (cyanidin 3-monoglucoside), and delphinidin are present. Roselle seeds are a good source of lipid-soluble antioxidants, particularly gamma-tocopherol.[181]\n\nCyanidin-3-glucoside is the major anthocyanin found in flowers of H. tiliaceus.[182] Leaves of H. tiliaceus displayed strong free radical scavenging activity and the highest tyrosinase inhibition activity among 39 tropical plant species in Okinawa.[183] With greater UV radiation in coastal areas, it is possible that leaves and flowers of natural coastal populations of H. tiliaceus have stronger antioxidant properties than planted inland populations.[184]\n\nHibiscus[185][186] is a genus of flowering plants in the mallow family, Malvaceae.\n\nThe generic name is derived from the Greek name ἰβίσκος (ibískos) which Pedanius Dioscorides gave to Althaea officinalis (ca 40–90 AD).[187][188]\n\nSeveral species are widely cultivated as ornamental plants, notably Hibiscus syriacus and Hibiscus rosa-sinensis.[189]\n\nFamily: Euphorbiaceae\n\nThe tree contains 12-deoxy-5-hydroxyphorbol-6-gamma-7-alpha-oxide, hippomanins, mancinellin, and sapogenin, phloracetophenone-2,4-dimethylether is present in the leaves, while the fruits possess physostigmine.[190]\n\nA gum can be produced from the bark which reportedly treats edema, while the dried fruits have been used as a diuretic.[191]\n\nFamily Lycopodiaceae.\n\nHuperzine A is a naturally occurring sesquiterpene alkaloid compound found in the firmoss Huperzia serrata[192] and in varying quantities in other food Huperzia species, including H. elmeri, H. carinat, and H. aqualupian.[193] Huperzine A has been investigated as a treatment for neurological conditions such as Alzheimer's disease, but a meta-analysis of those studies concluded that they were of poor methodological quality and the findings should be interpreted with caution.[194][195]\n\nHuperzine A is extracted from Huperzia serrata.[192] \"Huperzine A (HupA), a novel alkaloid isolated from the Chinese herb Huperzia serrata, is a potent, highly specific and reversible inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase (AChE).\"[196] It is a reversible acetylcholinesterase inhibitor[196][197][198][199] and NMDA receptor antagonist[200] that crosses the blood-brain barrier.[201] Acetylcholinesterase is an enzyme that catalyzes the breakdown of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine and of some other choline esters that function as neurotransmitters. The structure of the complex of huperzine A with acetylcholinesterase has been determined by X-ray crystallography (PDB code: 1VOT; see the 3D structure).[202]\n\nFor some years, huperzine A has been investigated as a possible treatment for diseases characterized by neurodegeneration, particularly Alzheimer's disease.[192][203] A 2013 meta-analysis found that huperzine A may be efficacious in improving cognitive function, global clinical status, and activities of daily living for individuals with Alzheimer's disease. However, due to the poor size and quality of the clinical trials reviewed, huperzine A should not be recommended as a treatment for Alzheimer's disease unless further high quality studies confirm its beneficial effects.[194]\n\nHuperzine A is also marketed as a dietary supplement with claims made for its ability to improve memory and mental function.[204]\n\nHuperzine A has also been noted to help induce lucid dreaming.[205]\n\nFamily: Ranunculaceae\n\nBerberine is found in Hydrastis canadensis (goldenseal).[206]\n\nFamily: Hypericaceae\n\nMany members of this family contain the naphthodianthrone derivatives hypericin and pseudohypericin contained in glandular tissues that appear as black, orange or translucent spots or lines on petals, leaves and other parts of the plant, that are photosensitive and can cause reactions in grazing animals, such as blistering of the snout (muzzle), as well as in people who come into contact with the plants over prolonged periods.[207] The highest concentration of these substances occurs in Hypericum perforatum (common St. John's wort), which is used in herbalism and as a traditional medicine (folk remedy).[208]\n\nThe plant contains the following:[209][210]\n\nFlavonoids (e.g. epigallocatechin, rutin, hyperoside, isoquercetin, quercitrin, quercetin, amentoflavone, biapigenin, astilbin, myricetin, miquelianin, kaempferol, luteolin)\n\nPhenolic acids (e.g. chlorogenic acid, caffeic acid, p-coumaric acid, ferulic acid, p-hydroxybenzoic acid, vanillic acid)\n\nNaphthodianthrones (e.g. hypericin, pseudohypericin, protohypericin, protopseudohypericin)\n\nPhloroglucinols (e.g. hyperforin, adhyperforin)\n\nTannins (unspecified, proanthocyanidins reported)\n\nVolatile oils (e.g. 2-methyloctane, nonane, 2-methyldecane, undecane, α-pinene, β-pinene, α-terpineol, geraniol, myrcene, limonene, caryophyllene, humulene)\n\nSaturated fatty acids (e.g. isovaleric acid (3-methylbutanoic acid), myristic acid, palmitic acid, stearic acid)\n\nAlkanols (e.g. 1-tetracosanol, 1-hexacosanol)\n\nVitamins & their analogues (e.g. carotenoids, choline, nicotinamide, nicotinic acid)\n\nMiscellaneous others (e.g. pectin, β-sitosterol, hexadecane, triacontane, kielcorin, norathyriol)\n\nThe naphthodianthrones hypericin and pseudohypericin along with the phloroglucinol derivative hyperforin are thought to be among the numerous active constituents.[211][212][213][214] It also contains essential oils composed mainly of sesquiterpenes.[211]\n\n\"These researches are according to an investigation of the effect of H. perforatum on the NF-κB inflammation factor, conducted by Bork et al. (1999), in which hyperforin provided a potent inhibition of TNFα-induced activation of NF-κB [58]. Another important activity for hyperforin is a dual inhibitor of cyclooxygenase-1 and 5-lipoxygenase [59]. Moreover, this species attenuated the expression of iNOS in periodontal tissue, which may contribute to the attenuation of the formation of nitrotyrosine, an indication of nitrosative stress [26]. In this context, a combination of several active constituents of Hypericum species is the carrier of their anti-inflammatory activity.\"[215]\n\n\"Anti-inflammatory mechanisms of hyperforin have been described as inhibition of cyclooxygenase-1 (but not COX-2) and 5-lipoxygenase at low concentrations of 0.3 μmol/L and 1.2 μmol/L, respectively [52], and of PGE2 production in vitro [53] and in vivo with superior efficiency (ED50 = 1 mg/kg) compared to indomethacin (5 mg/kg) [54]. Hyperforin turned out to be a novel type of 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor with high effectivity in vivo [55] and suppressed oxidative bursts in polymorphonuclear cells at 1.8 μmol/L in vitro [56]. Inhibition of IFN-γ production, strong downregulation of CXCR3 expression on activated T cells, and downregulation of matrix metalloproteinase 9 expression caused Cabrelle et al. [57] to test the effectivity of hyperforin in a rat model of experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE). Hyperforin attenuated the symptoms significantly, and the authors discussed hyperforin as a putative therapeutic molecule for the treatment of autoimmune inflammatory diseases sustained by Th1 cells.\"[216]\n\n\"Hyperforin is found in alcoholic beverages. Hyperforin is a constituent of Hypericum perforatum (St John's Wort) Hyperforin is a phytochemical produced by some of the members of the plant genus Hypericum, notably Hypericum perforatum (St John's wort). The structure of hyperforin was elucidated by a research group from the Shemyakin Institute of Bio-organic Chemistry (USSR Academy of Sciences in Moscow) and published in 1975. Hyperforin is a prenylated phloroglucinol derivative. Total synthesis of hyperforin has not yet been accomplished, despite attempts by several research groups. Hyperforin has been shown to exhibit anti-inflammatory, anti-tumor, antibiotic and anti-depressant functions[217][218][219][220]\n\nArachidonate 5-lipoxygenase ...Specific function: Catalyzes the first step in leukotriene biosynthesis, and thereby plays a role in inflammatory processes ...\n\nProstaglandin G/H synthase 1 ... General function: Involved in peroxidase activity\".[221][215][216]\n\nThe California black walnut is Juglans californica.\n\nButternuts are Juglans cinerea.\n\nThe Arizona walnut is Juglans major.\n\nThe eastern black walnut is Juglans nigra\n\nFamily Juglandaceae.\n\nThe Persian or English walnut is Juglans regia.\n\nUnlike most nuts that are high in monounsaturated fatty acids, walnut oil is composed largely of polyunsaturated fatty acids (72% of total fats), particularly alpha-linolenic acid (14%) and linoleic acid (58%), although it does contain oleic acid as 13% of total fats.[222]\n\nWalnut hulls contain diverse phytochemicals, such as polyphenols that stain hands and can cause skin irritation. Seven phenolic compounds, including ferulic acid, vanillic acid, coumaric acid, syringic acid, myricetin, and juglone were identified in walnut husks. Juglone, the predominant phenolic, was found in concentrations of 2-4% fresh weight.[223]\n\nWalnuts also contain the ellagitannin pedunculagin.[224] Regiolone has been isolated with juglone, betulinic acid and sitosterol from the stem bark of Juglans regia.[225]\n\nFamily: Acanthaceae\n\nThe plant is widely used in various forms for many of its medicinal and insecticidal properties,[226]\n\nJusticia gendarussa is harvested for its leaves for the treatment of various ailments.[227]\n\nIt maybe useful for the treatment of asthma, rheumatism and colics of children.[228] It may have the potential to be the basis for a birth control pill for men. Clinical tests are being conducted in Indonesia.[229][230][231]\n\nThe plant has shown promise as a source of a compound that inhibits an enzyme crucial to the development of HIV.[232][233]\n\nJusticia gendarussa was proved to contain several phytochemicals, which are natural secondary plant compounds. Overall in the plant, roots, stem and leaves, following phytochemicals were found: alkaloids, flavonoids, tannins and phenols.[234] The ingredients of the plant may vary depending on the age, physiological stage of the organ parts or the geographic region of cultivation.[235]\n\nThe plant was proved to have both anti-microbial and anti-fungal action on selected pathogen strains, and therefore this plant can be used to develop herbal drugs.[234]\n\nJusticia gendarussa leaf extract was proven to potentially become a male, non-hormonally contraceptive method due to its competitive and reversible inhibition of the spermatozoan hyaluronidase enzyme. The plant is already used as traditional contraceptive method in Indonesia.[236]\n\nThe plant compound Patentiflorin A contained in Justicia gendarussa has shown to have a positive activity against several HIV strains, higher than the clinically used first anti-HIV drug, zidovudine AZT.[232]\n\nFurther, extracts of the leaves have an anti-inflammatory effect. This has been demonstrated especially in mice, specific for the carrageenan-induced paw edema.[237]\n\nThe juice of the leaves can be drizzled into the ear for earache. To treat external edema, an oil made from the leaves can be used.[238]\n\nFamily: Myrtaceae\n\nFamily: Lythraceae\n\nFamily: Myrtaceae\n\nThe nectar from the flowers is harvested by bees, yielding Leptospermum honey, which is marketed as Manuka honey.[239] Honey produced from Australian Leptospermum polygalifolium is also known as jelly bush or the lemon-scented tea tree.[240]\n\nFamily: Plantaginaceae.\n\nFamily: Linaceae.\n\nFamily: Linaceae.\n\nFlax seeds are 7% water, 18% protein, 29% carbohydrates, and 42% fat. In 100 grams (3.5 oz) as a reference amount, flax seeds provide 534 calories and contain high levels (20% or more of the Daily Value, DV) of protein, dietary fiber, several B vitamins, and dietary minerals.[241][242] Flax seeds are especially rich in thiamine, magnesium, and phosphorus (DVs above 90%).\n\nAs a percentage of total fat, flax seeds contain 54% omega-3 fatty acids (mostly alpha-Linolenic acid (ALA), 18% omega-9 fatty acids (oleic acid), and 6% omega-6 fatty acids (linoleic acid); the seeds contain 9% saturated fat, including 5% as palmitic acid.[241][242] Flax seed oil contains 53% 18:3 omega-3 fatty acids (mostly ALA) and 13% 18:2 omega-6 fatty acids.[241]\n\nLithospermum officinale, or common gromwell or European stoneseed, is a flowering plant species in the family Boraginaceae, native to Eurasia.\n\nThe plant has been found to be a potent natural anti-inflammatory and effective agent for healing burn wounds when applied topically, which explains the presence of this species in the poultice discovered.[243]\n\nThe mechanism by which freeze-dried aqueous extracts (FDE) of plants of the species Lithospermum officinale (Boraginaceae) have the ability to inhibit at least many of the effects of exogenous and endogenous TSH on the thyroid gland. To this end, we have examined the in vitro effects of FDE from these plants on the ability of bovine TSH (bTSH) to both bind to human thyroid plasma membranes (TPM) and activate adenylate cyclase therein. FDE of this species produced a dose-related, ultimately complete, inhibition of the binding of 125I-labeled bTSH when studied at 4 C in a 20 mM Tris-HCl-0.5% BSA buffer, pH 7.45. Half-maximum inhibition of bTSH binding was produced by approximately 50 mU/ml bTSH and only about 10-30 micrograms/ml of the four active FDE. When studied in Tris-BSA-50 mM NaCl buffer at 37 C, these FDE remained inhibitory to bTSH binding, but their potency was decreased to about one fifth of that seen in the absence of NaCl. The binding of [125I]hCG to rat testis membranes was also inhibited by all of these FDE, but no effect on the binding of [125I]insulin to crude rat liver membranes was observed.\n\nThe antithyrotropic activity of freeze-dried-extracts from Lithospermum officinale (Lith. off. FDE) was investigated in the rat. When administered together with TSH, Lith. off. FDE blocked the TSH- induced increase in endocytotic activity of the thyroid glands followed by a strong decline of thyroid hormone levels. Furthermore, when Lith. off. FDE was injected alone it caused a decline in endogenous TSH-levels as well as in thyroidal secretion and thyroid hormone levels. The efficacy of the extract in blocking thyroid secretion was compared to that of potassium iodide and it was found that the effect of Lith. off. FDE was of more rapid onset and of longer duration, suggesting that the FDE may have a different mode of action from that of KJ. A specific interaction between TSH and the active constituents of the plant extract is discussed. Experiments on thyroidectomized and T4 substituted rats have demonstrated as an additional pharmacodynamic effect of Lith. off. FDE an inhibition of peripheral T4-deiodination.\n\nLithospermum officinale has been studied using female Wistar rats. Variations of the main urolithiasis risk factors (citraturia, calciuria, phosphaturia, pH and diuresis) have been evaluated. It can be concluded that beneficial effects caused by a herb infusion on urolithiasis (kidney stones) can be attributed to some disinfectant action, and tentatively to the presence of saponins. Specifically, some solvent action can be postulated with respect to uric stones or heterogeneous uric nucleus, due to the basifying capacity of some herb infusions.\n\nFamily: Caprifoliaceae\n\nIn traditional Chinese medicine,[244] Lonicera japonica is called rěn dōng téng[244] literally \"winter enduring vine\") or jīn yín huā[244] literally \"gold-silver flower\". Alternative Chinese names include er hua and shuang hua, meaning double-[color] flowers.[245] In Korean, it is called geumeunhwa.\n\nThe dried leaves and flowers (Flos Lonicerae Japonicae) are employed in traditional Chinese medicine, being used to treat fever, cold-related headache, cough, thirst, certain inflammation including sore throat, skin infection, and tumor necrosis.[246]\n\nThe antiviral action of loniflavone, a compound found in Lonicera japonica, has been investigated in computational studies, in which the ability of this compound to bind with high affinity to the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 has been demonstrated, an early step towards drug development for the disease that virus causes.[247]\n\nLonicera japonica contains methyl caffeate, 3,4-di-O-caffeoylquinic acid, methyl 3,4-di-O-caffeoylquinate, protocatechuic acid, methyl chlorogenic acid, and luteolin. The two biflavonoids, 3′-O-methyl loniflavone and loniflavone, along with luteolin and chrysin, can be isolated from the leaves.[248] Other phenolic compounds present in the plant are hyperoside, chlorogenic acid, and caffeic acid.[249] The two secoiridoid glycosides, loniceracetalide A and loniceracetalide B, can be isolated, together with 10 known iridoid glycosides, from the flower buds.[250] The plant also contains the saponins loniceroside A and loniceroside B[251] and the antiinflammatory loniceroside C.[252]\n\nFamily: Poaceae\n\nFamily: Solanaceae\n\nBecause of its claimed benefits as a drug of traditional medicine, the chemicals present in the fruit, root, and other parts of the plants have been studied in some detail.[253][254]\n\nThe main compounds in the fruit (23% of the dry mass) are polysaccharides and proteoglycans. Carotenoid pigments are the second major group, chiefly zeaxanthin palmitic acid (dipalmitate). The fruits further contain vitamins, in particular riboflavin, thiamin and ascorbic acid (vitamin C), the latter in a concentration similar to that in lemons. Other detected compounds include flavonoids derived from myricetin, quercetin, and kaempferol; hexadecanoic acid, linoleic acid, β-elemene, myristic acid and ethyl hexadecanoate; and some glycerogalactolipids. The fruit further contains 1–2.7% of free amino acids; chiefly proline, and including gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and trimethylglycine (betaine). Other compounds include β-sitosterol, scopoletin, p-coumaric acid, lyciumide A and L-monomenthyl succinate. The alkaloid atropine, common in plants of the family Solanaceae, is not detectable.[253]\n\nThe compounds present in the roots have been less studied, but they include trimethylglycine (betaine), choline, linoleic acid, and β-sitosterol [79]. Of particular interest are cyclic oligopeptides with 8 amino acid rings, christened lyciumin A and lyciumin B.[253]\n\nThe leaves are known to contain the flavonoids quercetin 3-O-rutinoside-7-O-glucoside, kaempferol 3-O-rutinoside-7-O-glucoside, rutin, nicotiflorin, isoquercitrin, quercetin, kaempferol damascenone, choline, scopoletin, vanillic acid, salicylic acid, and nicotinic acid. From the flowers, diosgenin, β-sitosterol, and lanosterol have been isolated.[253]\n\nLycium europaeum, the European tea tree, European box-thorn, or European matrimony-vine, is a species of flowering plant in the family Solanaceae.[255] It is native to the entire Mediterranean region, and has been introduced to the Canary Islands, Madeira, and the Balearic Islands.[256] Its fruit is edible.[257]\n\nFamily: Magnoliaceae.\n\nThe aromatic bark contains magnolol, honokiol, 4-O-methylhonokiol, and obovatol.[258][259][260][261][262][263] Magnolol[264] and honokiol[265] activate the nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma.\n\nMagnolol is an organic compound, classified as lignan, a bioactive compound found in the bark of the Houpu magnolia (Magnolia officinalis) or in Magnolia grandiflora.[266]\n\nFamily: Berberidaceae.\n\nBerberine is found in Mahonia aquifolium (Oregon grape).[267]\n\nFamily: Marchantiaceae.\n\nHypolaetin is a flavone, the aglycone of hypolaetin 8-glucuronide (H-8-G), a compound found in the liverwort Marchantia berteroana.[268]\n\nThe \"effects of H-8-G and its aglycone, hypolaetin (H) on rabbit skin edema [...] Edema formation was measured as the local accumulation during 1 h of 1251-human serum albumin (5 1.tCi) (4).

Peppermint oil also contains small amounts of many additional compounds including limonene, pulegone, caryophyllene and pinene.[280]\n\nPeppermint contains terpenoids and flavonoids such as eriocitrin, hesperidin, and kaempferol 7-O-rutinoside.[281]\n\nPeppermint oil has a high concentration of natural pesticides, mainly pulegone (found mainly in Mentha arvensis var. piperascens cornmint, field mint, Japanese mint, and to a lesser extent (6,530 ppm) in Mentha × piperita subsp. notho[282]) and menthone.[283] It is known to repel some pest insects, including mosquitos, and has uses in organic gardening. It is also widely used to repel rodents.[284][285][286][287]\n\nThe chemical composition of the essential oil from peppermint (Mentha × piperita L.) was analyzed by Flame ionization detector (GC/FID) and Gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC-MS}: menthol (40.7%) and menthone (23.4%), (±)-menthyl acetate, 1,8-cineole, limonene, beta-pinene, and beta-caryophyllene.[288]\n\nThe Herbal Tea \"Cold & Flu Time\" contains: Chinese honeysuckle, mulberry leaf, lophatherum, pueraria root, peppermint, licorice root, orange peel, from the box \"INGREDIENTS\".\n\nMain article: Remedy/Plants/Rubiaceae\n\nFamily: Cucurbitaceae.\n\nFamily: Moraceae.\n\nVarious extracts from Morus alba including kuwanon G, moracin M, steppogenin-4′-O-β-D-glucoside and mulberroside A have been suggested as having a variety of potentially-useful medical effects.[289][290][291][292][293][294][295][296][297][298][299] Cyanidin-3-O-beta-ᴅ-glucopyranoside and Sanggenon G extracted from Morus alba were studied in animals models for some effects on the central nervous system, but clinical trials are necessary to confirm the effects.[300]\n\nMorus alba is a traditional Chinese medicine that contains alkaloids and flavonoids that are bioactive compounds.[301][302] Studies have shown that these compounds may help reduce high cholesterol, obesity, and stress.[303]\n\nMorus indica is often grown for its medicinal properties. As with most berries, the mulberries of M. indica have potent antioxidant properties.[304] The primary medicinal use of Morus indica is as a method of regulating blood glucose levels in diabetic patients. Multiple studies in humans and mice have found that the use of Morus indica lowered the blood glucose levels of diabetics through multiple different pathways.[304][305][306]\n\nMorus mongolica is known to have multiple flavonoid and phenolic compounds.[307][308][309][310] These compounds can be found in the fruits,[309] leaves,[308] and bark.[311]\n\nMorus, a genus of flowering plants in the family Moraceae, consists of diverse species of deciduous trees commonly known as mulberries, growing wild and under cultivation in many temperate world regions.[312][313][37] Generally, the genus has three well-known species ostensibly named for the fruit color of the best-known cultivar: white, red, and black mulberry (Morus alba, M. rubra, and M. nigra, respectively), with numerous cultivars,[314][315] The name \"white mulberry\" came about because the first specimens named by European taxonomists were a cultivated mutation prized for their white fruit, but wild trees bear black fruit like other mulberries. White mulberry is native to South Asia, but is widely distributed across Europe, Southern Africa, South America, and North America.[313] Morus alba is regarded as an invasive species in Brazil and the United States.[313]\n\nThe closely related genus Broussonetia is also commonly known as mulberry, notably the paper mulberry, Broussonetia papyrifera.[316]\n\nThe fruit and leaves are sold in various forms as dietary supplements. Unripe fruit and green parts of the plant have a white sap that may be toxic, stimulating, or mildly hallucinogenic.[317]\n\nMulberry fruit color derives from anthocyanins,[37] which have unknown effects in humans.[318] Anthocyanins are responsible for the attractive colors of fresh plant foods, including orange, red, purple, black, and blue.[318] These colors are water-soluble and easily extractable, yielding natural food colorants.[313] Due to a growing demand for natural food colorants, they have numerous applications in the food industry.[37][318]\n\nMorus nigra, called black mulberry[319] or blackberry (not to be confused with the blackberries that are various species of Rubus),[320] is a species of flowering plant that is native to southwestern Asia and the Iberian Peninsula, where it has been cultivated for so long that its precise natural range is unknown.[321] The black mulberry is known for its large number of chromosomes, 308 (44x ploidy).[322]\n\nMain article: Remedy/Plants/Fabaceae\n\nFamily: Olacaceae, genus Ptychopetalum.\n\nFamily: Myristicaceae\n\nNutmeg is the seed or ground spice of several species of the genus Myristica.[323] Myristica fragrans (fragrant nutmeg or true nutmeg) is a dark-leaved evergreen tree cultivated for two spices derived from its fruit: nutmeg, from its seed, and mace, from the seed covering. It is also a commercial source of an essential oil and nutmeg butter. Indonesia is the main producer of nutmeg and mace.\n\nIf consumed in amounts exceeding its typical use as a spice, nutmeg powder may produce allergic reactions, cause contact dermatitis, or have psychoactive effects.[324] Although used in traditional medicine for treating various disorders, nutmeg has no scientifically confirmed prescription drug (medicinal value).[324]\n\nNutmeg is the spice made by grinding the seed of the fragrant nutmeg (Myristica fragrans) tree into powder. The spice has a distinctive pungent fragrance and a warm, slightly sweet taste; it is used to flavor many kinds of baked goods, confections, puddings, potatoes, meats, sausages, sauces, vegetables, and such beverages as eggnog.[325]\n\nThe seeds are dried gradually in the sun over a period of six to eight weeks. During this time the nutmeg shrinks away from its hard seed coat until the kernels rattle in their shells when shaken. The shell is then broken with a wooden club and the nutmegs are picked out. Dried nutmegs are grayish brown ovals with furrowed surfaces.[325] The nutmegs are roughly egg-shaped, about 20.5–30 mm (0.81–1.18 in) long and 15–18 mm (0.59–0.71 in) wide, weighing 5–10 g (0.18–0.35 oz) dried.\n\nThe essential oil obtained by steam distillation of ground nutmeg[326] is used in the perfumery and pharmaceutical industries. The volatile fraction contains dozens of terpenes and phenylpropanoids, including D-pinene, limonene, D-borneol, L-terpineol, geraniol, safrol, and myristicin.[326][327][328] In its pure form, myristicin is a toxin, and consumption of excessive amounts of nutmeg can result in myristicin poisoning.[329]\n\nThe oil is colorless or light yellow, and smells and tastes of nutmeg. It is used as a natural food flavoring in baked goods, syrups, beverages, and sweets. It is used to replace ground nutmeg, as it leaves no particles in the food. The essential oil is also used in the manufacturing of toothpaste and cough syrups.[330]\n\nNutmeg butter is obtained from the nut by expression, is semisolid, reddish-brown in colour, and has the taste and smell of nutmeg itself.[326] About 75% (by weight) of nutmeg butter is trimyristin, which can be turned into myristic acid, a 14-carbon fatty acid, which can be used as a replacement for cocoa butter, can be mixed with other fats like cottonseed oil or palm oil, and has applications as an industrial lubricant.\n\nTwo other species of genus Myristica with different flavors, Myristica malabarica and Myristica argentea, are sometimes used to adulterate nutmeg as a spice.[331]\n\nFamily: Poaceae.\n\nFamily: Poaceae.\n\nFamily: Poaceae.\n\nFamily: Poaceae.\n\nFamily: Oleaceae.\n\nOsmanthus fragrans, variously known as sweet osmanthus, sweet olive, tea olive, and fragrant olive, is a species native to Asia from the Himalayas through southern China (Guizhou, Sichuan and Yunnan) to Taiwan, southern Japan and Southeast Asia as far south as Cambodia and Thailand.[332][333][334][335]\n\nOsmanthus tea has been used as an herbal tea for the treatment of irregular menstruation.[336] The extract of dried flowers showed neuroprotective, free-radical scavenging, antioxidative effects in in vitro assays.[337]\n\nFamily: Araliaceae.\n\nFamily: Lauraceae.\n\nAvocados have diverse fats.[338] For a typical one:\n\nAbout 75% of an avocado's energy comes from fat, most of which (67% of total fat) is monounsaturated fat as oleic acid.[338]\n\nOther predominant fats include palmitic acid and linoleic acid.[338]\n\nThe saturated fat content amounts to 14% of the total fat.[338]\n\nTypical total fat composition is roughly: 1% omega-3 fatty acid (ω-3), 14% omega-6 fatty acid (ω-6), 71% omega-9 fatty acid (ω-9) (65% oleic and 6% palmitoleic), and 14% saturated fat (palmitic acid).[338]\n\nFamily: Rutaceae.\n\nBerberine is found in Phellodendron amurense (Amur cork tree).[339]\n\nFamily Anacardiaceae.\n\nRaw pistachios are 4% water, 45% fat, 28% carbohydrates, and 20% protein. In a 100-gram reference amount, pistachios provide 2,351 kilojoules (562 kcal) of food energy and are a rich source (20% or more of the Daily Value or DV) of protein, dietary fiber, several dietary minerals, and the B vitamins, thiamin (76% DV) and vitamin B6 (131% DV) (table).[242] Pistachios are a moderate source (10–19% DV) of calcium, riboflavin, pantothenic acid (vitamin B5), folate, vitamin E, and vitamin K.\n\nThe fat profile of raw pistachios consists of saturated fats, monounsaturated fats and polyunsaturated fats.[242][340] Saturated fatty acids include palmitic acid (10% of total) and stearic acid (2%).[340] Oleic acid is the most common monounsaturated fatty acid (51% of total fat)[340] and linoleic acid, a polyunsaturated fatty acid, is 31% of total fat.[242] Relative to other tree nuts, pistachios have a lower amount of fat and food energy but higher amounts of potassium, vitamin K, Tocopherol (γ-tocopherol), and certain phytochemicals such as carotenoids, and phytosterols.[341][342]\n\nMain article: Remedy/Plants/Rosaceae\n\nMain article: Remedy/Plants/Rosaceae\n\nMain article: Remedy/Plants/Fabaceae\n\nMain article: Remedy/Plants/Fabaceae\n\nFamily: Bangiaceae\n\nFamily: Bangiaceae\n\nFamily: Bangiaceae\n\nFamily: Bangiaceae\n\nFamily: Bangiaceae\n\n\"A unique life cycle transition in the red seaweed Pyropia yezoensis depends on apospory.\"[343]\n\nA number of chemical constituents including iridoids, phenethyl alcohol, glycosides, cyclopentanoid monoterpenes, and norcarotenoids, have been reported from the fresh or processed roots of Rehmannia glutinosa.[344]\n\nMain article: Remedy/Plants/Rosaceae\n\nMain article: Remedy/Plants/Rosaceae\n\nMain article: Remedy/Plants/Rosaceae\n\nMain article: Remedy/Plants/Rosaceae\n\nMain article: Remedy/Plants/Rosaceae\n\nMain article: Remedy/Plants/Adoxaceae\n\nMain article: Remedy/Plants/Adoxaceae\n\nMain article: Remedy/Plants/Adoxaceae\n\nMain article: Remedy/Plants/Adoxaceae\n\nMain article: Remedy/Plants/Adoxaceae\n\nFamily: Lamiaceae.\n\nThe main compounds responsible for the biological activity of skullcap are flavonoids.[345] Baicalein, one of the important Scutellaria flavonoids, was shown to have cardiovascular effects in in vitro.[346] Research also shows that Scutellaria root modulates inflammatory activity in vitro to inhibit nitric oxide (NO), cytokine, chemokine and growth factor production in macrophages.[347] Isolated chemical compounds including wogonin, wogonoside, and 3,5,7,2',6'-pentahydroxyl flavanone found in Scutellaria have been shown to inhibit histamine and leukotriene release.[348] Other active constituents include baicalin, apigenin, oroxylin A, scutellarein, and skullcapflavone.[349]\n\nA variety of flavonoids in Scutellaria species have been found to bind to the benzodiazepine site and/or a non-benzodiazepine site of the GABAA receptor, including baicalin, baicalein, wogonin, apigenin, oroxylin A, scutellarein, and skullcapflavone II.[350][351][352] Baicalin and baicalein,[352][353][354][355] wogonin,[356] and apigenin[357] have been confirmed to act as positive allosteric modulators and produce anxiolytic effects in animals, whereas oroxylin A acts as a negative allosteric modulator (and also, notably, as a dopamine reuptake inhibitor).[358][359][360] As such, these compounds and actions, save oroxylin A, are likely to underlie the anxiolytic effects of Scutellaria species.[361]\n\nScutellaria also contains rosmarinic acid which inhibits GABA transaminase which breaks GABA down, thus making it available longer.[362]\n\nMain article: Remedy/Plants/Fabaceae\n\nFamily: Lamiaceae.\n\nHypolaetin 8-glucoside can be found in Sideritis leucantha.[363]\n\nMain article: Remedy/Plants/Asteraceae\n\nFamily: Simaroubaceae\n\nThough there is some research[364] claiming that Simarouba is effective for treating certain diseases, there seems to be insufficient evidence[365] of curing diarrhea, malaria, edema, fever and stomach upset. Known in India as Lakshmi Taru, the extracts from parts of the tree have been claimed to possess potent anticancer properties. However, to date, no systematic research using phytochemicals isolated from Simarouba glauca has been carried out to explore the molecular mechanisms leading to cancer cell death.[366] Simarouba extracts are known to be effective only on specific types of human cancer cell lines and tests conducted were invitro. Whether the same effect would be observed under invivo conditions, depends on bioavailability and bioaccessibility,[367] hence Simarouba as an alternative cure for cancer remains unproven.\n\nFamily: Solanaceae\n\nThe plant has many medical properties. In the tribes of Nilgiris, the plant is used to treat a whitlow (finger abscess): the finger is inserted into a ripe fruit for a few minutes.[368] In Nepal, a decoction of root is taken twice a day for seven days to treat cough, asthma and chest pain.[369]\n\nAyurvedic Physicians commonly used the drugs of Dashmula in their private practice. Dashmula comprises root of five trees (brihat panchmula) and root of five small herbs (laghu panchmula). Deep study in Ayurveda indicate that out of 33 species of Solanum from family Solanaceae, two species are used in Dashmula such as Solanum anguivi Lam. (Bruhati) and Solanum virginianum L. (Kantkari) (Sharma, 2006). The tribals and villagers also used the drugs of Dashmula group for their common ailments. It is estimated that about 8000 metric tons of roots of Dashmula are used annually by Ayurvedic industry in Maharashtra.[370]:26\n\nHeble et al., (1968) chemically isolated, crystallized, diosgenin and beta cytosterol constituents from Solanum virginianumL. Further they reported the presence of triterpenes like Tupeol. Heble et al., (1971) noted the presence of coumarins, scopolin, scopoletin, esculin and esculetin from plant parts of Solanum virginianum through column chromatography. Hussain et al., (2010) in addition to alkaloids content also determined the presence of flavoinoids and saponin apart from the presence of tolerable level of heavy metals like Cu, Fe, Pb, Cd and Zn. Shankar et al., (2011) reported and quantified bioactive steroidal glycoalkaloid khasianine in addition to solanine and solasomargine through HPTLC. Apigenin showed antiallergic while diosgenin exhibited anti–inflammatory effects (Singh et al., 2010). The leaf extract inhibit the growth of pathogenic organisms.(Seeba, 2009). Tanusak Changbanjong et al., (2010) reported the effect of crude extract of Solanum verginianum against snails and mosquito larvae.[370]:28\n\nSolanum virginianum L. (Kantkari) is useful in bronchial asthma (Govindan et al., 1999). Krayer and Briggs (1950) reported the antiaccelerator cardiac action of solasodine and some of its derivatives. The plant possesses antiurolthiatic and natriuretic activities. (Patel et al., 2010). A decoction of the fruits of the plant is used for treatment of diabetes (Nadkarni, 1954). Solanum virginianum L. herb is useful in cough, chest pain, against vomiting, hair fall, leprosy, itching scabies, skin diseases and cardiac diseases associated with edema (Kumar et al., 2010).[370]:28\n\nRoots decoction is used as fabrige, effective diuretic and expectorant. It is diuretic useful in the treatment of catarrhal, fever, cough, asthma, and chest pain (Ghani, 1996). Root paste is utilized by the Mukundara tribals of Rajasthan for the treatment of hernia as well as in flatulence and constipation. Stem, flower and fruits are prescribed for relief in burning sensation in the feed. Leaves are applied locally to relieve body or muscle pains, while its juice mixed with black pepper is advised for rheumatism (Nadkarni, 1954). Fruit juice is useful in sore throats and rheumatism. A decoction of the fruits of the plant is used by tribal and rural people of Orissa for the treatment of diabetes (Nadkarni, 1954).[370]:28 Smoking the seeds of the dried solanum virginanum in a biri warp is said to allay toothache and tooth decay in Indian folk medicine.\n\nIn-vitro antioxidant and in-vivo Antimutagenic properties of Solanum xanthocarpum seed extracts, the preliminary qualitative phytochemical screening was done which reveal the presence of polyphenols, flavonoids, glycoside, alkaloids, carbohydrates, and reducing sugar etc. Based preliminary qualitative phytochemical screening, Quantitative estimation of polyphenols was performed, quantitative estimation alcoholic extract found significant amounts of polyphenols as compare to aqueous extract. In-vitro antioxidants was performed by two method DDPH and superoxide radical scavenging method, the alcoholic extract shows significant antioxidant properties as compare to aqueous extract, based on polyphenols and antioxidant properties alcoholic extracts was used for the antimutagenic (clastogenic) test.

Stachyose is up to 80-90% in dry tubers.[374]\n\nthe entirety of S. affinis is used as an agent to treat colds and pneumonia.[375]\n\nRoot extract of S. affinis has shown antimicrobial activity.[376] Antioxidant activity has been observed, plus inhibitory effects on acetylcholine esterase, monoamine oxidase and xanthine oxidase activities were observed in rat brains after 20 days feeding with methanolic extracts of S. affinis.[377] Ethanol extract from this plant also seems to have antitumour activity.[378]\n\n\"Japanese artichoke [...] contain germacrene D, caryophyllene, cadinene. [...] methanolic tuber extract of Japanese artichoke, which contains glycosides, including acteoside and stachysosides C, significantly inhibits induced mortality from potassium cyanide poisoning in mice [19]. This extract inhibits hyaluronidase activity, has anti-inflammatory action, and is effective in kidney disease [15].\"[379]\n\nThe \"methanol extract from the leaves and root tubers and ethanol extract from the root tubers of Stachys sieboldii have a pronounced antibacterial effect on the culture of Salmonella typhimurium. In addition, methanol extract from the leaves of Stachys sieboldii showed a significant antibacterial effect on the culture of Bacillus cereus.
