General Considerations, Guiding Principles,\n\nand Definitions\n\nArticle 1\n\nBotany cannot make satisfactory progress without a precise system of\n\nnomenclature which is used by the great majority of botanists in all countries.\n\nArticle 2\n\nThe precepts on which this precise system of botanical nomenclature is\n\nbased are divided into principles, rules and recommendations.\n\nThe principles (Art. 1~9 and 11~22) *) form the basis of the rules and\n\nrecommendations.\n\nThe object of the rules (Art. 22~83) is to put the nomenclature of\n\nthe past into order and to provide for that of the future. They are always\n\nretroactive except when expressly limited: names or forms of nomenclature\n\ncontrary to a rule cannot be maintained.\n\nThe recommendations deal with subsidiary points, their object being to\n\nbring about greater uniformity and clearness especially in future nomen~\n\nclature; names or forms contrary to a recommendation cannot on that account\n\nbe rejected, but they are not examples to be followed.\n\nArticle 3\n\nThe Code of nomenclature should be simple and founded on conside~\n\nrations sufficiently clear and forcible for everyone to comprehend and be\n\ndisposed to accept.\n\nArticle 4\n\nThe essential points in nomenclature are:\n\n(1) to aim at fixity of names; (2) to avoid or to reject the use of forms\n\nand names which may cause error or ambiguity or throw science into\n\nconfusion.\n\nNext in importance is the avoidance of all useless creation of names\n\nOther considerations, such as absolute grammatical correctness, regularity\n\nor euphony of names, more or less prevailing custom, regard for persons, etc.,\n\nnotwithstanding their undeniable importance are relatively accessory.\n\nArticle 5\n\nIn the absence of a relevant rule, or where the consequences of rules are\n\ndoubtful, established custom must be followed.\n\n————————–\n\n) Art. 22 is both a principle and a rule.\n\n________________________________________________________________\n\nInternational Code of Botanical Nomenclature, 1952 — Stockholm Code\n\n– 01 –\n\ntext: © 1952, IAPT — web-edition: © 2014, Paul van Rijckevorsel (all rights reserved)\n\n________________________________________________________________\n\n6~11 Definitions\n\nArticle 6\n\nBotanical nomenclature is independent of zoological nomenclature in the\n\nsense that the name of a plant must not be rejected merely because it is\n\nidentical with the name of an animal. If, however, an organism is transferred\n\nfrom the animal to the plant kingdom, its validly published names are to be\n\naccepted as botanical nomenclature in the form prescribed by the rules of\n\nbotanical nomenclature, and if an organism is transferred from the plant to\n\nthe animal kingdom, its names retain their status in botanical nomenclature.\n\nArticle 7\n\nScientific names of all taxonomic groups are usually taken from Latin\n\nor Greek. When taken from any language other than Latin, or formed in an\n\narbitrary manner, they are treated as if they were Latin. Latin terminations\n\nshould be used as far as possible for new names.\n\nArticle 8\n\nBotanical nomenclature deals with:\n\n(1) the terms which denote the categories of taxonomic groups or units,\n\nand the relative ranks of these categories (Art. 12~15);\n\n(2) the names which are applied to the individual taxonomic groups\n\n(Art. 16~83).\n\nTaxonomic groups of any category will, in this Code, be referred to as\n\ntaxa (singular: taxon).\n\nArticle 9\n\nThe purpose of giving a name to a taxon is not to indicate its characters\n\nor history, but to supply a means of referring to it.\n\nArticle 10\n\nA legitimate name or epithet is one that is in accordance with the rules.\n\nAn illegitimate name or epithet is one that is contrary to the rules.\n\nThe correct name of a taxon with a particular circumscription, position\n\nand rank is the name which must be adopted for it under the rules.\n\nEffective publication is publication in accordance with Art. 39.\n\nValid publication is publication in accordance with Art. 42~54.\n\nNote. In this Code, unless otherwise indicated, the word name means a name which\n\nhas been validly published, whether it is legitimate or illegitimate.\n\nArticle 11\n\nThe rules and recommendations of botanical nomenclature apply\n\nthroughout the plant kingdom, recent and fossil, with certain distinctly\n\nspecified exceptions.\n\n________________________________________________________________\n\nInternational Code of Botanical Nomenclature, 1952 — Stockholm Code\n\n– 02 –\n\ntext: © 1952, IAPT — web-edition: © 2014, Paul van Rijckevorsel (all rights reserved)\n\n________________________________________________________________\n\nCategories 12~14\n\nChapter II. Categories of Taxa, and the\n\nterms denoting them\n\nArticle 12\n\nEvery plant is treated as belonging to a number of categories of conse~\n\ncutive rank and consecutively subordinate of which the species (species) is\n\nthe basic one.\n\nThe principal categories above species in ascending sequence are: genus\n\n(genus), family (familia), order (ordo), class (classis), division (divisio),\n\nwhich means that every species belongs (is to be assigned) to a genus, every\n\ngenus to a family (certain artificial groups of fossil plants excepted), etc.\n\nIn many genera sections (sectiones), and in many families tribes (tribus) are\n\nrecognized.\n\nArticle 13\n\nFinally, if a greater number of intermediate categories is required, the\n\nterms for these subdivisions are made by adding the prefix sub (sub) to the\n\nterms denoting the categories. Thus subfamily (subfamilia) denotes a category\n\nbetween a family and a tribe, subtribe (subtribus) a category between a tribe\n\nand a genus, etc. A plant may therefore be classified in subordinated categories\n\nin the following order: Regnum vegetabile, Divisio, Subdivisio, Classis, Sub~\n\nclassis, Ordo, Subordo, Familia, Subfamilia, Tribus, Subtribus, Genus, Sub~\n\ngenus, Sectio, Subsectio, Species.\n\nIf this list of categories is insufficient it may be augmented by the inter~\n\ncalation of supplementary categories, provided that this does not introduce\n\nconfusion or error.\n\nExamples: Series and subseries are categories which may be intercalated between\n\nsubsection and species.\n\nFor special categories resulting from genetic analysis of taxa see\n\nAppendix II.\n\nArticle 14\n\nSimilarly species may be subdivided on the same principles, the most\n\ngenerally used categories being, in descending sequence: subspecies (sub~\n\nspecies), variety (varietas) and form (forma).\n\nRecommendation 14A\n\nIn classifying parasites, especially parasitic fungi, authors who do not give specific\n\nvalue to taxa characterized from a biological standpoint but scarcely or not at all from a\n\nmorphological standpoint should distinguish within the species special forms (formae speciales)\n\ncharacterized by their adaption to different hosts.\n\n________________________________________________________________\n\nInternational Code of Botanical Nomenclature, 1952 — Stockholm Code\n\n– 03 –\n\ntext: © 1952, IAPT — web-edition: © 2014, Paul van Rijckevorsel (all rights reserved)\n\n________________________________________________________________\n\n15 misplaced terms\n\nArticle 15\n\nThe relative order of the categories specified above in Art. 12~14 must\n\nnot be altered.\n\nNames given to taxa which are at the same time denoted by misplaced\n\nterms are treated as not validly published, examples of such misplacement\n\nbeing a form divided into varieties, a species containing genera, a genus\n\ncontaining families or tribes.\n\nAn exception is made for names of subdivisions of genera in Fries\n\nSystema Mycologicum, which are treated as validly published although he\n\ntermed them tribes (tribus).\n\nExample: The names Delphinium tribus Involuta Huth (Bot. Jahrb. 20: 365. 1895),\n\ntribus Brevipedunculata Huth (Bot. Jahrb. 20: 368. 1895), etc. are treated as not validly\n\npublished, since Huth misapplied the term tribus to a category of lower rank than a\n\nsection.\n\n________________________________________________________________\n\nInternational Code of Botanical Nomenclature, 1952 — Stockholm Code\n\n– 04 –\n\ntext: © 1952, IAPT — web-edition: © 2014, Paul van Rijckevorsel (all rights reserved)\n\n________________________________________________________________\n\nPriority, Type method 16~18\n\nChapter III. Names of Taxa\n\nSection 1. Priority\n\nArticle 16\n\nEach order or taxon of lower rank with a given circumscription, position,\n\nand rank can bear only one correct name, special exceptions being made for\n\n9 families in which alternative names are permitted (see Art. 28).\n\nFor any taxon from order to genus inclusive, the correct name is the earliest\n\nlegitimate one validly published with the same rank.\n\nFor any taxon below the rank of genus the correct name is the combination\n\nof the generic name with the earliest available legitimate epithet or epithets\n\nvalidly published with the same rank.\n\nArticle 17\n\nNo one may change a name (or combination of names) without serious\n\nmotives, based either on more profound knowledge of facts or on the necessity\n\nof giving up a nomenclature that is contrary to the rules of this Code.\n\nRecommendation 17A\n\nChanges in nomenclature should be made only after adequate taxonomic study.\n\nSection 2. The type method\n\nArticle 18\n\nThe application of names of taxa is determined by means of nomenclatural\n\ntypes. A nomenclatural type (typus) is that constituent element of a taxon\n\nto which the name of the taxon is permanently attached, whether as an\n\naccepted name or as a synonym. It follows that the name of a taxon must\n\nbe changed if the type of the name is excluded.\n\nNote 1. The nomenclatural type is not necessarily the most typical or representative\n\nelement of a taxon; it is merely that element with which the name is permanently associated.\n\nNote 2. A holotype (type) is the one specimen or other element used by the author\n\nor designated by him as the nomenclatural type. For so long as a holotype is extant it\n\nautomatically fixes the application of the name concerned.\n\nNote 3. If no holotype has been indicated by the author who described a taxon, or\n\nwhen the holotype is lost or destroyed, a substitute for it must be chosen. The author who\n\nmakes this choice must be followed unless his choice is cancelled under the provisions of\n\nArt. 19.\n\nThe substitute may be either a lectotype or a neotype. A lectotype always takes\n\nprecedence over a neotype.\n\nA lectotype is a specimen or other element selected from the original material to serve\n\nas nomenclatural type when the holotype was not designated at the time of publication or\n\nfor so long as it is missing.\n\n________________________________________________________________\n\nInternational Code of Botanical Nomenclature, 1952 — Stockholm Code\n\n– 05 –\n\ntext: © 1952, IAPT — web-edition: © 2014, Paul van Rijckevorsel (all rights reserved)\n\n________________________________________________________________\n\n19~22 Type method\n\nWhen two or more specimens have been designated as types by the author of a\n\nname (e.g. male and female, flowering and fruiting, etc.) one of them must be chosen as\n\nlectotype.\n\nA neotype is a specimen selected to serve as nomenclatural type for so long as all\n\nof the material on which the name of the taxon was based is missing.\n\nArticle 19\n\nThe choice of a lectotype or neotype is cancelled if the original material\n\nis rediscovered, or if it can be shown that the choice was based on a mis~\n\ninterpretation of the original description.\n\nRecommendation 19A\n\nFor other specimens of special interest the following terms are recommended:\n\nA paratype is a specimen other than the holotype cited with the original description.\n\nAn isotype is a duplicate of the holotype.\n\nA syntype is one of two or more specimens or elements used by the author when no\n\nholotype was designated, or one of two or more specimens simultaneously designated as type.\n\nRecommendation 19B\n\nIt cannot be too strongly recommended that the original material, especially the holo~\n\ntype, of a taxon be deposited in a permanent responsible institution and that it be scru~\n\npulously conserved. When living material has been designated as a type, appropriate parts\n\nof it should be immediately preserved.\n\nArticle 20\n\nThe nomenclatural type of an order or of any taxon of a rank between\n\norder and family is the family whose name is based on the same generic\n\nname, that of a family or of any taxon between family and genus is the genus\n\non whose present or former name that of the taxon concerned is based (see\n\nalso Art. 28), and that of a genus or of any taxon between genus and species\n\nis a species.\n\nNote. It is felt that the type method cannot at present be applied profitably to the\n\nnomenclature of taxa above the rank of order.\n\nArticle 21\n\nThe nomenclatural type (holotype, lectotype or neotype) of a species\n\nor taxon below the rank of species is a single specimen or other element except\n\nin the following case: for small herbaceous plants and for most non~vascular\n\nplants the type may consist of more than one individual, which ought to be\n\nconserved permanently and assembled on one herbarium sheet or preparation.\n\nIf it is later proved that such a type herbarium sheet or preparation\n\ncontains parts belonging to more than one taxon, the name must remain\n\nattached to that part (lectotype) which corresponds most nearly with the\n\noriginal description.\n\nNote 1. For plants of which it is impossible to preserve a type specimen, the type\n\nmay be a figure and/or a description.\n\nNote 2. For a species without a type specimen, the type may be a description or figure.\n\nSection 3. Limitation of the principle of priority; publication, starting\n\npoints, conservation of names.\n\nArticle 22\n\nA name of a taxon has no status under this Code, and no claim to\n\nrecognition by botanists, unless it is validly published (see Section 6, Art. 42).\n\n________________________________________________________________\n\nInternational Code of Botanical Nomenclature, 1952 — Stockholm Code\n\n– 06 –\n\ntext: © 1952, IAPT — web-edition: © 2014, Paul van Rijckevorsel (all rights reserved)\n\n________________________________________________________________\n\nStarting points 23~24\n\nArticle 23\n\nValid publication is treated as beginning for the different groups\n\nof plants at the following dates (for each group a work is mentioned which is\n\ntreated as having been published on the date given for that group):\n\na. SPERMATOPHYTA and PTERIDOPHYTA, 1 May 1753 (Linnaeus, Species\n\nPlantarum ed. 1).\n\nb. MUSCI (the SPHAGNACEAE excepted), 31 Dec. 1801 (Hedwig, Species\n\nMuscorum).\n\nc.

Vol.\n\n1 of the Systema is treated as having appeared on 1 Jan. 1821, and the Elenchus\n\nFungorum (1828) is treated as a part of the Systema. Names of FUNGI CAETERI,\n\npublished in other works between the dates of the first (Vol. 1) and last\n\n(Vol. 3 part 2 and index) parts of the Systema which are synonyms or homo~\n\nnyms of names of any of the FUNGI CAETERI, included in the Systema do not\n\naffect the nomenclatural status of names used by Fries in this work.\n\ng. ALGAE, 1 May 1753 (Linnaeus, Species Plantarum ed. 1).\n\nExceptions: NOSTOCACEAE HOMOCYSTEAE, 1892~93 (Gomont, Monographie des\n\nOscillariées, Ann. Sci. Nat. Bot. VII. 6: 91; 7: 263).\n\nNOSTOCACEAE HETEROCYSTEAE, 1886~88 (Bornet & Flah., Revision des Nosto~\n\ncacées heterocystées, Ann. Sci. Nat. Bot. VII. 3: 323; 4: 344; 5: 51; 7: 177).\n\nDESMIDIACEAE, 1848 (Ralfs, British Desmidieae).\n\nOEDOGONIACEAE, 1900 (Hirn, Monographie und Iconographie der Oedogonia~\n\nceen, Acta Soc. Sci. Fenn. 27 (1).\n\nh. MYXOMYCETES, 1 May 1753 (Linnaeus, Species Plantarum ed. 1).\n\nThe nomenclature of fossil plants of all groups begins with the year 1820.* )\n\nIt is agreed to associate generic names which appear in Linnaeus\n\nSpecies Plantarum ed. 1 (1753) and ed. 2 (1762~63) with the first subsequent\n\ndescription given under those names in Linnaeus Genera Plantarum ed. 5\n\n(1754) and ed. 6 (1764).\n\nThe two volumes of Linnaeus Species Plantarum ed. 1 (1753), which\n\nappeared in May and August, 1753, respectively, are treated as if they had\n\nbeen published simultaneously on the former date (1 May 1753).\n\nExample: The generic names Thea L. Sp. Pl. 515 (May 1753) and Camellia L. Sp.\n\nPl. 698 (Aug. 1753), Gen. Pl. ed. 5. 311 (1754), are treated as if they had been\n\npublished simultaneously in May 1753. Under Art. 67 the combined genus bears the name\n\nCamellia, since Sweet (Hort. Suburb. Lond. 157. 1818), who was the first to unite the two\n\ngenera, chose that name, citing Thea as a synonym.\n\nArticle 24\n\nHowever, in order to avoid disadvantageous changes in the nomenclature\n\nof genera, families, orders, and intermediate taxa entailed by the strict\n\napplication of the rules, and especially of the principle of priority in starting\n\n————————–\n\n) The Special Committee for Paleobotany has decided, by postal vote, to postpone\n\nthe decision on the starting point of paleobotanical nomenclature until the 8th International\n\nBotanical Congress.\n\n________________________________________________________________\n\nInternational Code of Botanical Nomenclature, 1952 — Stockholm Code\n\n– 07 –\n\ntext: © 1952, IAPT — web-edition: © 2014, Paul van Rijckevorsel (all rights reserved)\n\n________________________________________________________________\n\n25~26 Conserved names\n\nfrom the dates given in Art. 23, this Code provides lists of names which must\n\nbe retained as exceptions. These names are preferably such as have come\n\ninto general use in the fifty years following their publication, or which have\n\nbeen used in monographs and important floristic works up to the year 1890.\n\nNote 1. These lists of conserved names will remain permanently open for additions. Any\n\nproposal of an additional name must be accompanied by a detailed statement of the cases\n\nboth for and against its conservation. Such proposals must be submitted to the General Com~\n\nmittee, who will refer them for examination to the Special Committees for the various\n\ntaxonomic groups. *)\n\nNote 2. The application of both conserved and rejected names is determined by\n\nnomenclatural types.\n\nNote 3. A conserved name is conserved against all other names for the taxon whether\n\nthese are cited in the corresponding list of rejected names or not, so long as the taxon\n\nconcerned is not united with another one bearing a legitimate name. In the event of union with\n\nanother taxon, the earlier of the two competing names is adopted in accordance with Art. 67.\n\nNote 4. A conserved name is conserved against all earlier homonyms.\n\nExamples: Listera R. Br. (1813) is conserved against Diphryllum Raf. (1808); it is\n\nalso conserved against Bifolium Petiver, Opera ed. Millan pl. 70, t. 10, 11, 12 (1764), as\n\nadduced by Nieuwland, in Am. Midl. Nat. 3: 128 (1913) (if Petivers name be regarded as\n\nvalidly published), though Bifolium is not mentioned among names to be rejected.\n\nThe generic name Luzuriaga Ruiz & Pav. (1802) is conserved against the earlier\n\nnames Enargea Banks ex Gaertn. (1788) and Callixene Juss. (1789). If, however, Enargea\n\nBanks ex Gaertn. is considered to be a separate genus, the name Enargea is retained for\n\nthis. In the same way, the genus Dichromena Michx. (1803) retains its name if treated as\n\na separate unit, not included in Rhynchospora Vahl corr. Willd., although the name Dichro~\n\nmena is rejected in favour of Rhynchospora as the designation for the combined genus.\n\nIf the genus Weihea Spreng. (1825) is united with Cassipourea Aubl. (1775), the\n\ncombined genus will bear the prior name Cassipourea, although Weihea is conserved and\n\nCassipourea is not. ~ If Mahonia Nutt. (1818) is united with Berberis L. (1753) the com~\n\nbined genus will bear the prior name Berberis, although Mahonia is conserved. ~ Nasturtium\n\nR. Br. (1812) was conserved only in the restricted sense, for a monotypic genus based on\n\nN. officinale R. Br., hence, if it is reunited with Rorippa Scop. (1760), it must bear the\n\nname Rorippa.\n\nThe generic name Swartzia Schreb. (1791), conserved against Tounatea Aubl., Pos~\n\nsira Aubl., and Hoelzelia Neck., is thereby conserved automatically against the earlier homo~\n\nnym Swartzia Ehrh. (1787).\n\nArticle 25\n\nWhen a name proposed for conservation has been provisionally approved\n\nby the Advisory Board and General Committee, botanists are authorized to\n\nretain it pending the decision of a later International Botanical Congress.\n\nSection 4. Nomenclature of taxa according to their categories\n\nSubsection 1. NAMES OF TAXA ABOVE THE RANK OF ORDER\n\nArticle 26\n\nThe Rules of priority and typification do not apply to names of taxa\n\nabove the rank of order.\n\nRecommendation 26A\n\n(a) Names of divisions are preferably taken from characters indicating the nature of\n\nthe division as closely as possible; they should end in ~phyta, except those of FUNGI, which\n\nshould end in ~mycota. Words of Greek origin are generally preferable.\n\n————————–\n\n) See Appendix V.\n\n________________________________________________________________\n\nInternational Code of Botanical Nomenclature, 1952 — Stockholm Code\n\n– 08 –\n\ntext: © 1952, IAPT — web-edition: © 2014, Paul van Rijckevorsel (all rights reserved)\n\n________________________________________________________________\n\nNames of higher taxa 27~29\n\nNames of subdivisions are formed in a similar manner; they are distinguished from\n\ndivisional names by an appropriate prefix or suffix or by the ending ~phytina, except those\n\nof FUNGI, which should end in ~mycotina.\n\n(b) Names of classes and subclasses are formed in a similar manner. Their endings\n\nshould be:\n\n1. In the ALGAE: ~phyceae (classes) and ~phycidae (subclasses);\n\n2. In the FUNGI: ~mycetes (classes) and ~mycetidae (subclasses);\n\n3. In the CORMOPHYTA: ~opsida (classes) and ~idae (subclasses).\n\nSubsection 2. NAMES OF ORDERS AND SUBORDERS\n\nArticle 27\n\nThe name of an order is taken from that of its type family, with the\n\nending ~ales.\n\nSuborders are designated in a similar manner, with the ending ~ineae.\n\nExamples of orders: Fucales, Polygonales, Urticales; suborders: Bromeliineae, Malvineae.\n\nSubsection 3. NAMES OF FAMILIES AND SUBFAMILIES, TRIBES AND SUBTRIBES\n\nArticle 28\n\nThe name of a family is a plural adjective used as a substantive taken\n\nfrom the name of its type genus or from a synonym, and ending in ~aceae.\n\nExamples: Rosaceae (from Rosa), Salicaceae (from Salix), Caryophyllaceae (from\n\nCaryophyllus, a pre~Linnean generic name).\n\nExceptions:\n\n1. The following names, sanctioned by long usage, are treated as\n\nexceptions to the rule: Palmae, Gramineae, Cruciferae, Leguminosae, Gutti~\n\nferae, Umbelliferae, Labiatae, Compositae.\n\nBotanists are authorized, however, to use as alternatives the appropriate\n\nnames ending in ~aceae.\n\n2. Those who regard the Papilionaceae as constituting an independent\n\nfamily may use that name, although it is not formed in the prescribed manner.\n\nArticle 29\n\nThe name of a subfamily is a plural adjective used as a substantive taken\n\nfrom the name of its type genus or from a synonym, with the ending ~oideae.\n\nTribes are designated in a similar manner, with the ending ~eae, and subtribes\n\nwith the ending ~inae.\n\nExamples of subfamilies: Asphodeloideae (from Asphodelus), Rumicoideae (from Rumex);\n\ntribes: Asclepiadeae (from Asclepias), Phyllantheae (from Phyllanthus); subtribes: Meta~\n\nstelmatinae (from Metastelma), Madiinae (from Madia).\n\nNote. When a name of a taxon belonging to one of the above categories has been\n\npublished with an improper termination, such as ~eae for a subfamily, ~oideae for a tribe,\n\nthe ending must be changed to accord with the rule, without change of authority; if, how~\n\never, the rank of the group is changed by a later author, he is then cited as authority for\n\nthe name, with the appropriate ending, in the usual way.\n\nExample: The subfamily name Climacieae Grout, Moss Fl. N. Am. 3: 4 (1928) must\n\nbe changed to Climacioideae, with rank and authority unchanged.

NAMES OF GENERA AND SUBDIVISIONS OF GENERA *\n\nArticle 30\n\nThe name of a genus is a substantive, or an adjective used as a substantive,\n\nin the singular number.\n\nIt may be taken from any source whatever, and may even be composed\n\nin an absolutely arbitrary manner.\n\nExamples: Rosa, Convolvulus, Hedysarum, Bartramia, Liquidambar, Gloriosa, lmpatiens.\n\nManihot, Ifloga (an anagram of Filago).\n\nRecommendation 30A\n\nBotanists who are forming generic names should comply with the following suggestions:\n\n(a) Not to make names very long or difficult to pronounce.\n\n(b) Not to dedicate genera to persons quite unconnected with botany or at least with\n\nnatural science nor to persons quite unknown.\n\n(c) Not to take names from barbarous languages, unless those names are frequently cited\n\nin books of travel, and have an agreeable form that is readily adaptable to the Latin tongue\n\nand to the tongue of civilized countries.\n\n(d) To indicate, if possible, by the formation or ending of the name the affinities or ana~\n\nlogies of the genus.\n\n(e) To avoid adjectives used as nouns.\n\n(f) Not to give to a genus a name whose form is rather that of a section (e.g. Eusidero~\n\nxylon, a name given to a genus of Lauraceae. This, however, being legitimate, cannot be\n\naltered).\n\n(g) Not to make names by combining words from different languages.\n\n(h) To give a feminine form to all personal generic names, whether they commemorate a\n\nman or a woman.\n\nArticle 31\n\nThe name of a subdivision of a genus is a combination of a generic name\n\nand a subdivisional epithet **) connected by a term (subgenus, section, series,\n\netc.) denoting the rank of the subdivision.\n\nFor subgenera and sections such epithets are usually substantives\n\nresembling the names of genera.\n\nFor subsections and lower subdivisions the epithets are preferably plural\n\nadjectives agreeing in gender with the generic name and written with a\n\ncapital initial letter, or their place may be taken by an ordinal number or a letter.\n\nEpithets of subgenera and sections must not repeat the name of the genus\n\nto which they belong with the ending ~oides or ~opsis.\n\nExamples of substantives: Adenoscilla, Micromelilotus, Pseudinga, Heterodraba, Gymno~\n\ncimum, Neoplantago. Adjectives: Fimbriati, Pleiostylae, Bibracteolata.\n\nThe same subdivisional epithet may be used in different genera but in\n\nthe same genus two subdivisions, even if they are of different rank, cannot\n\nbear the same epithet unless they are based on the same type.\n\nExample: Under Verbascum the sectional epithets Aulacosperma and Bothrosperma are\n\nallowed although there are also in the genus Celsia two sections named Aulacospermae\n\nand Bothrospermae. These however, are not examples to be followed, since they are con~\n\ntrary to Rec. 32A.\n\nArticle 32\n\nThe subgenus containing the type species of a generic name must bear\n\nthat name unaltered.\n\n————————–\n\n*) Here and elsewhere in the Code the phrase subdivision of a genus refers only\n\nto taxa between genus and species in rank.\n\n**) The editorial committee decided unanimously that for subdivisions of genera, the\n\nsecond part of the name should be termed the subdivisional epithet in accordance with recent\n\npractice.\n\n________________________________________________________________\n\nInternational Code of Botanical Nomenclature, 1952 — Stockholm Code\n\n– 10 –\n\ntext: © 1952, IAPT — web-edition: © 2014, Paul van Rijckevorsel (all rights reserved)\n\n________________________________________________________________\n\nSpecific names 32~33\n\nExample: The subgenus of Croton L. containing the lectotype of the genus (C. tiglium\n\nL.) must be called Croton subg. Croton and not Croton subg. Eluteria Griseb.\n\nRecommendation 32A\n\nBotanists constructing epithets for subgenera and sections should avoid adopting an\n\nepithet already used for a taxon of the same rank in another genus, or which is identical\n\nwith the name of another genus. They should also avoid, wherever possible, in co~ordinated\n\nsubdivisions of a genus, the use of epithets in the form of a substantive together with others\n\nin the form of a plural adjective. If it is desired to indicate the resemblance of a subgenus\n\n(other than the type~subgenus) or section of one genus to another genus, the endings\n\n~oides or ~opsis may be added to the name of that other genus to form the epithet of\n\nthe subgenus or section concerned.\n\nRecommendation 32B\n\nWhen it is desired to indicate the name of a subgenus or section (or other subdivision)\n\nto which a particular species belongs in connection with the generic name and specific\n\nepithet, the epithet of the subdivision is placed in parentheses between the two; when\n\nnecessary, the rank of the subdivision is also indicated.\n\nExamples: Astragalus (Cycloglottis) contortuplicatus; Loranthus (Sect. Ischnanthus)\n\ngabonensis.\n\nSubsection 5. NAMES OF SPECIES (BINARY NAMES)\n\nArticle 33\n\nThe name of a species is a binary combination consisting of the name\n\nof the genus followed by a single specific epithet. If an epithet consists of\n\ntwo words, these must either be united or hyphened. Epithets not so joined\n\nwhen originally published are not to be rejected but when used must be\n\nhyphened [ see also Art. 79 (4) ].\n\nExamples: Cornus sanguinea, Dianthus monspessulanus, Papaver rhoeas, Uromyces\n\nfabae, Fumaria gussonei, Geranium robertianum, Embelia sarasinorum, Atropa bella~donna,\n\nImpatiens noli~tangere, Adiantum capillus~veneris.\n\nSymbols forming part of specific epithets proposed by Linnaeus must be\n\ntranscribed.\n\nExamples: Scandix pecten ♀ L. must be transcribed as Scandix pecten~veneris; Vero~\n\nnica anagallis ∇ L. must be transcribed as Veronica anagallis~aquatica.\n\nThe specific epithet, when adjectival in form and not used as a substantive,\n\nagrees in gender with the generic name.\n\nExamples: Helleborus niger, Brassica nigra, Verbascum nigrum.\n\nBinary combinations of a specific epithet with the word Anonymos (and\n\nsimilar token words) are illegitimate, since the word Anonymos is not a generic\n\nname [ Art. 78 (1) ]. Such combinations are not taken into consideration for\n\npurposes of priority of the epithet concerned.\n\nExamples: The binary combination Anonymos aquatica Walt. (Fl. Carol. 230. 1788)\n\nis illegitimate. The valid name for the species concerned is Planera aquatica J. F. Gmel.\n\n(1791), and the date of the epithet aquatica for purposes of priority, is 1791. The species\n\nmust not be cited as Planera aquatica (Walt.) J. F. Gmel. If, however, it is desired to in~\n\ndicate that the epithet originated with Walter, the name may be cited as Planera aquatica\n\n[Walt.] J. F. Gmel.\n\nRecommendation 33A\n\nThe specific epithet should preferably give some indication of the appearance, the\n\ncharacters, the origin, the history or the properties of the species. If taken from the name\n\nof a person, it usually recalls the one who discovered or described it, or was in some way\n\nconnected with it.\n\n________________________________________________________________\n\nInternational Code of Botanical Nomenclature, 1952 — Stockholm Code\n\n– 11 –\n\ntext: © 1952, IAPT — web-edition: © 2014, Paul van Rijckevorsel (all rights reserved)\n\n________________________________________________________________\n\n33~34 Ternary names\n\nRecommendation 33B\n\nNames of men and women and also of countries and localities used as specific epi~\n\nthets may be substantives in the genitive (clusii, saharae) or adjectives (clusianus, dahuricus).\n\nIt will be well, in the future, to avoid the use of the genitive and the adjectival form\n\nof the same word to designate two different species of the same genus; for example\n\nLysimachia hemsleyana Maxim. (1891) and L. hemsleyi Franch. (1895).\n\nRecommendation 33C\n\nIn forming specific epithets, botanists should comply also with the following suggestions:\n\n(a) To avoid those which are very long and difficult to pronounce.\n\n(b) To avoid those which express a character common to all or nearly all the species of\n\na genus.\n\n(c) To avoid using the names of little~known or very restricted localities, unless the species\n\nis quite local.\n\n(d) To avoid in the same genus epithets which are very much alike, especially those\n\nwhich differ only in their last letters or in the arrangement of two letters.\n\nExample: Carex albata and Carex ablata.\n\n(e) Not to adopt unpublished names found in travellers notes or in herbaria, attributing\n\nthem to their authors, unless these have approved publication.\n\n(f) Not to name a species after a person who has neither discovered, nor described, nor\n\nfigured, nor in any way studied it.\n\n(g) To avoid epithets which have been used before in any closely allied genus.\n\n(h) To avoid specific epithets formed of two or more hyphened words.\n\n(i) To avoid epithets which have the same meaning as the generic name (pleonasm).\n\nSubsection 6. NAMES OF TAXA BELOW THE RANK OF SPECIES\n\n(TERNARY NAMES)\n\nArticle 34\n\nFor nomenclatural purposes, a species or any taxon below the rank of a\n\nspecies is regarded as the sum of its lower taxa, if any.\n\nThe description of a subordinated taxon which does not include the\n\nnomenclatural type of the higher taxon automatically creates a second sub~\n\nordinated taxon of the same rank which has as its nomenclatural type the type\n\nof the higher taxon (see Art. 35).\n\nExample: The publication in 1843 of Lycopodium inundatum L. var. bigelovii Tuckerm.\n\nautomatically creates another variety the type of which is the type of Lycopodium inundatum L.\n\nEpithets of subspecies and varieties are formed as those of species and\n\nfollow them in order, beginning with those of the highest rank. When\n\nadjectival in form and not used as substantives they agree in gender\n\nwith the generic name.\n\nSimilarly for subvarieties, forms and slight or transient modifications\n\nof wild plants, which receive either epithets or numbers or letters to facilitate\n\ntheir arrangement.\n\nThe use of a binary nomenclature for subdivisions of species is not\n\nadmissible. It is permissible to reduce more complicated names to ternary\n\ncombinations.\n\nExamples: Andropogon ternatus subsp. macrothrix (not Andropogon macrothrix or\n\nAndropogon ternatus subsp. A. macrothrix); Herniaria hirsuta var. diandra (not Herniaria\n\ndiandra or Herniaria hirsuta var. H. diandra); Trifolium stellatum forma nanum (not nana).\n\nSaxifraga aizoon subforma surculosa Engler & Irmsch. is the correct ternary com~\n\nbination for Saxifraga aizoon var. aizoon subvar. brevifolia forma multicaulis subforma\n\nsurculosa Engler & Irmsch.\n\n________________________________________________________________\n\nInternational Code of Botanical Nomenclature, 1952 — Stockholm Code\n\n– 12 –\n\ntext: © 1952, IAPT — web-edition: © 2014, Paul van Rijckevorsel (all rights reserved)\n\n________________________________________________________________\n\nTernary names 35~38\n\nArticle 35\n\nIf any infraspecific taxon which includes the nomenclatural type of the\n\nepithet of the next higher taxon is to be mentioned by a subdivisional name,\n\nthat name must repeat the epithet of the higher taxon unaltered but, contrary\n\nto Art. 55, without citation of an authors name. This epithet can no longer\n\nbe used when that of the next higher taxon is changed.\n\nExamples: The binary combination Lobelia spicata Lam. var. originalis McVaugh,\n\nwhich includes the type of Lobelia spicata Lam., must be altered to Lobelia spicata Lam.\n\nvar. spicata.\n\nSince under Lobelia siphilitica L. there is also described var. ludoviciana A. DC one\n\nmust write Lobelia siphilitica L. var. siphilitica if only that part of L. siphilitica L. which\n\nincludes the type is meant.\n\nSince under Vochysia rufa Mart. subsp. sericea (Pohl) Stafl. there is also described\n\na var. fulva Stafl. one must write Vochysia rufa Mart. subsp. sericea (Pohl) Stafl. var.\n\nsericea if only that part of the subsp. sericea (Pohl) Stafl. which includes the type is meant.\n\nArticle 36\n\nThe same epithet may be used for subdivisions of different species, and\n\nthe subdivisions of one species may bear the same epithets as other species.\n\nExamples: Rosa jundzillii var. leioclada and Rosa glutinosa var. leioclada; Viola\n\ntricolor var. hirta in spite of the existence already of a different species named Viola hirta.\n\nArticle 37\n\nTwo subdivisions of the same species, even if they are of different rank,\n\ncannot bear the same subdivisional epithet, unless their names are based on\n\nthe same type. If the earlier subdivisional name (ternary combination) was\n\nvalidly published, the later one is illegitimate and must be rejected.\n\nExamples: The following is incorrect: Erysimum hieraciifolium subsp. strictum var.\n\nlongisiliquum and E. hieraciifolium subsp. pannonicum var. longisiliquum ~ a form of\n\nnomenclature which allows two varieties bearing the same name in the same species.\n\nThe name Andropogon sorghum subsp. halepensis Hack. var. halepensis is legitimate,\n\nsince the subspecies and the variety have the same type and the epithet must be repeated\n\nunder Art. 35.\n\nRecommendation 37A\n\nRecommendations made for specific epithets (see Rec. 33A. B, C) apply equally to\n\nepithets of subdivisions of species.\n\nRecommendation 37B\n\nSpecial forms (formae speciales) are preferably named after the host species; if desired,\n\nepithets formed of two words joined by a hyphen may be used.\n\nExamples: Puccinia hieracii f. sp. villosi; Pucciniastrum epilobii f. sp. abieti~chamaenerii.\n\nRecommendation 37C\n\nBotanists proposing new epithets for subdivisions of species should avoid such as have\n\nbeen used previously for species in the same genus.\n\nSubsection 7. NAMES OF PLANTS IN CULTIVATION\n\nArticle 38\n\nPlants brought into cultivation from the wild and which differ in no\n\nfundamental way from the parent stocks bear the same names as are applied\n\nto the same species and subdivisions of species in nature.\n\n________________________________________________________________\n\nInternational Code of Botanical Nomenclature, 1952 — Stockholm Code\n\n– 13 –\n\ntext: © 1952, IAPT — web-edition: © 2014, Paul van Rijckevorsel (all rights reserved)\n\n________________________________________________________________\n\n39~40 Effective publication\n\nPlants arising in cultivation through hybridization, mutation or other\n\nprocesses which tend to establish recognizable differences from the parent\n\nstocks receive epithets, preferably in common language (i.e. fancy epithets),\n\nmarkedly different from the Latin epithets of species or varieties.\n\nDetailed regulations for the nomenclature of plants in cultivation appear\n\nin Appendix III.\n\nSection 5. Conditions and dates of effective publication\n\nArticle 39\n\nPublication is effected, under this Code, only by distribution (sale,\n\nexchange, or gift) of printed matter. It is not effected by communication of\n\nnew names at a public meeting, by the placing of names in collections or\n\ngardens open to the public, or by the issue of microfilm made from manuscripts.\n\nUp to and including 31 Dec. 1952 publication by indelible autograph is\n\naccepted. Offer for sale of material that does not exist does not constitute\n\neffective publication.\n\nOn and from 1 Jan. 1953 the publication of a new name in tradesmens\n\ncatalogues or in newspapers, even if accompanied by a Latin diagnosis, does\n\nnot constitute effective publication.\n\nNote. For purposes of this Article holographic material, even though reproduced by\n\nsome mechanical or graphic process (such as lithography, offset, metallic etching or micro~\n\nfilm) is still considered as autographic.\n\nExamples: Effective publication without printed matter: Salvia oxyodon Webb & Heldr.\n\nwas published in July 1850 in an autograph catalogue placed on sale (Webb & Heldreich,\n\nCatalogus Plantarum Hispanicarum .. ab. A. Blanco lectarum. Paris, July 1850. folio).\n\nNon~effective publication at a public meeting: Cusson announced his establishment of\n\nthe genus Physospermum in a memoir read at the Société des Sciences de Montpellier in\n\n1770, and later in 1782 or 1783 at the Société de Médecine de Paris, but its effective\n\npublication dates from 1787 in the Mémoires de la Société Royale de Médecine de Paris\n\n5(1): 279.\n\nEffective publication in separates issued in advance: the Selaginella species published\n\nby Hieronymus in Hedwigia 51: 241~272 (1912), were effectively published on 15 Oct. 1911\n\nsince the volume in which the paper appeared states (p. II) that the separate appeared on\n\nthat date.\n\nEffective publication in reproduced holographic material: H. Léveillé, Flore du Kouy\n\nTchéou (1914~15), a work lithographed from the hand~written manuscript.\n\nRecommendation 39A\n\nBotanists and others are urged scrupulously to avoid the publication of new species\n\nnames or combinations in ephemeral publications such as popular periodicals, in any\n\npublication unlikely to reach the general botanical public, or in those produced by such\n\nmethods that their permanence is unlikely.\n\nArticle 40\n\nThe date of effective publication is the time that the printed matter\n\nbecame available as defined in Art. 39. In the absence of proof establishing\n\nsome other date the one appearing in the printed matter must be accepted\n\nas correct.\n\nWhen separates from periodicals or other works placed on sale are issued\n\nin advance, the date on the separate is accepted as the date of effective\n\npublication unless there is evidence that it is erroneous.\n\n________________________________________________________________\n\nInternational Code of Botanical Nomenclature, 1952 — Stockholm Code\n\n– 14 –\n\ntext: © 1952, IAPT — web-edition: © 2014, Paul van Rijckevorsel (all rights reserved)\n\n________________________________________________________________\n\nValid publication 41~42\n\nArticle 41\n\nOn and after 1 Jan. 1953, the distribution of an exsiccatum relative to\n\nany new taxon, accompanied by an original diagnosis, even if this is printed,\n\ndoes not constitute effective publication.\n\nNote. The printing and distribution of the schedae of a set of dried plants in form\n\nof a special publication (e.g., Schedae operis ... Plantae Finlandiae Exsiccatae etc., Hel~\n\nsingfors 1. 1906, 2. 1916, 3. 1933, 1944 or Lundell [1 Nannfeldt, Fungi Exsiccati Suecici\n\netc., Uppsala 1~ ...... 1934~ ......) will even after that date constitute effective publication.\n\nSection 6. Conditions and dates of valid publication\n\nArticle 42\n\nA name of a taxon of recent plants is not validly published unless it is\n\nboth (1) effectively published (see Art. 39) and (2) accompanied by a\n\ndescription of the taxon or by a reference (direct or indirect) to a previously\n\nand effectively published description of it.\n\nOn and after 1 Jan. 1953, new transfers or new combinations, however,\n\nwill be considered validly published only when the basonym (name~bringing\n\nor epithet~bringing synonym) is clearly indicated with its author and the\n\nplace and date of publication.\n\nNo combination is validly published unless the author definitely indicates\n\nthat the epithet or epithets concerned are to be combined with the generic\n\nname in a particular way.\n\nNote 1. In certain circumstances a plate or figure with analyses is accepted as equi~\n\nvalent to a description (see Art. 50, 52).\n\nNote 2. Bibliographic errors of citation do not invalidate the publication of a new\n\ncombination.\n\nExamples of names not validly published: Egeria Néraud (Bot. Voy. Freycinet 28.\n\n1826) published without a description or a reference to a former description.\n\nThe name Loranthus macrosolen Steud. originally appeared without a description on\n\nthe printed tickets issued about the year 1843, with Sect. II. nos. 529, 1288 of Schimpers\n\nherbarium specimens of Abyssinian plants; it was not validly published, however, until A.\n\nRichard (Tent. Fl. Abys. 1: 340. 1847) supplied a description.\n\nExamples of combinations definitely indicated: In Linnaeus Species Plantarum the\n\nplacing of the epithet in the margins opposite the name of the genus clearly indicates the\n\ncombination intended. The same result is attained in Millers Gardeners Dictionary, ed. 8,\n\nby the inclusion of the epithet in parentheses immediately after the name of the genus, in\n\nSteudels Nomenclator Botanicus by the arrangement of the epithets in a list headed by\n\nthe name of the genus, and in general by any typographical device which indicates that an\n\nepithet is associated with a particular generic or other name.\n\nExamples of combinations not definitely indicated: Rafinesques statement that Monar~\n\nda ciliata must form a new genus, which we will call Blephilia does not constitute publi~\n\ncation of the combination Blephilia ciliata, since he did not indicate that that combination\n\nwas to be used. Similarly the combination Eulophus peucedanoides must not be ascribed\n\nto Bentham and Hooker f. on the basis of the listing of Cnidium peucedanoides H. B. K.\n\nunder Eulophus in the Genera Plantarum.\n\nExample of validation of a combination by indirect reference: The publication of the\n\nnew combination Cymbopogon martini by W. Watson, Atk. Gaz. NW. Provo India 10: 392\n\n(1882) is validated by the addition of the number 309 which, as explained at the top of\n\nthe same page, is the running~number of the species (Andropogon martini Roxb.) in Steud.\n\nSyn. Pl. Glum. 1: 388 (1854). Although the reference to the synonym, Andropogon mar~\n\ntini, is indirect, it is perfectly unambiguous.\n\nRecommendation 42A\n\nFrom 1 Jan. 1953 onward, botanists are recommended to discontinue the practice of\n\nvalidating new binomials solely by reference to descriptions or plates published before 1753.\n\n________________________________________________________________\n\nInternational Code of Botanical Nomenclature, 1952 — Stockholm Code\n\n– 15 –\n\ntext: © 1952, IAPT — web-edition: © 2014, Paul van Rijckevorsel (all rights reserved)\n\n________________________________________________________________\n\n43~46 Latin description\n\nArticle 43\n\nA name (1) which is not accepted by the author who published it, or (2)\n\nwhich is merely proposed in anticipation of the future acceptance of the\n\ngroup concerned, or of a particular circumscription, position or rank of the\n\ngroup (so~called provisional name), or (3) a name merely mentioned inci~\n\ndentally, is not validly published.\n\nOn and from 1 Jan. 1953 when two or more different names (so~called\n\nalternative names) are proposed simultaneously for the same taxon by the\n\nsame author none of them is validly published.\n\nProvision no. 1 does not apply to names or epithets published with a\n\nquestion mark or other indication of taxonomic doubt, yet published and\n\naccepted by the author. By incidental mention of a new name or combination\n\nis meant mention by an author who does not intend to introduce the new\n\nname or combination concerned.\n\nExamples: The generic name Conophyton Haw. suggested by Haworth (Rev. Pl. Succ.\n\n82. 1821) for Mesembryanthemum sect. Minima Haw. (Rev. Pl. Succ. 81. 1821) in the\n\nfollowing words: If this section proves to be a genus, the name of Conophyton would be\n\napt ~ was not validly published since Haworth did not adopt that generic name nor\n\naccept that genus: the correct name for the genus is Conophytum N. E. Brown (Gard.\n\nChron. III. 71: 198. 1922).\n\nIn 1891, Baillon (Hist. Pl. 10: 49) suggested that Tecoma spiralis Wright might per~\n\nhaps represent a new genus intermediate between Radermachera and Tecoma, or a new\n\nsection. Three years later K. Schumann suggested independently (Engler & Prantl, Nat.\n\nPfl. fam. 4 (3b): 238) that Tecoma spiralis Wright might be treated as the type of an\n\nindependent genus Neurotecoma, but stated that the material available was insufficient for\n\na thorough investigation of the question. Neither Spirotecoma Baill. nor Neurotecoma K.\n\nSchum. was validly published by its author. The name Spirotecoma Baill. was, however,\n\nvalidly published by Dalla Torre & Harms (Gen. Siphonog. 467. 1904) as a generic name,\n\nwith a reference to the previously published diagnosis in Engler & Prantl (Nat. Pfl. fam.\n\n4 (3b): 238).\n\nCotema Britt. & Wils. (Mem. Torrey Bot. Club 16: 107. 1920) being also based on\n\nTecoma spiralis, is a nomenclatural synonym of Spirotecoma.\n\nThe species of Brosimum described by Ducke (Arch. Jard. Bot. Rio 3: 23~29. 1922)\n\nwere published together with the alternative names under Piratinera added in a footnote\n\n(p. 23~24). The publication of these names, being effected before 1 Jan. 1953, is valid.\n\nArticle 44\n\nOn and from 1 Jan. 1935, names of new taxa of recent plants, the bacteria\n\nexcepted, are considered as validly published only when they are accompanied\n\nby a Latin diagnosis.\n\nNote. This article validates the publication of names of new taxa effectively published\n\nfrom 1908 to 1934 inclusive with diagnoses in modern languages.\n\nArticle 45\n\nOn and from 1 Jan. 1912, names of new taxa of fossil plants are not\n\nconsidered as validly published unless they are accompanied by illustrations\n\nor figures showing the essential characters, in addition to the description, or\n\nby a reference to a previously and effectively published illustration or figure.\n\nArticle 46\n\nA name of a taxon is not validly published when it is merely cited as\n\na synonym.\n\nExamples: Acosmus Desv., cited as a synonym of the generic name Aspicarpa L.

As Salisbury supplied no generic description, his publication of lbi~\n\ndiun is invalid.\n\nArticle 48\n\nA name of a genus of recent plants is not validly published unless it is\n\naccompanied (1) by a description of the genus, (2) by citation of a\n\npreviously and effectively published description of the genus, or (3) by\n\nreference to a previously and effectively published description of the genus\n\nas a subgenus, section or other subdivision of a genus. An exception is made\n\nfor the generic names published by Linnaeus in Species Plantarum ed. 1\n\n(1753), and ed. 2 (1762~63), which are treated as having been validly published\n\non those dates (see Art. 23).\n\nNote. In certain circumstances, a plate with analyses is accepted as equivalent to a\n\ngeneric description (see Art. 50).\n\nExamples of validly published generic names: Carphalea Juss. (Gen. Plant. 198. 1789),\n\naccompanied by a generic description; Thuspeinanta Th. Dur. (Ind. Gen. Phan. x. 1888),\n\naccompanied by a reference to the previously described genus Tapeinanthus Boiss. (non\n\nHerb.); Aspalathoides (DC.) K. Koch (Hort. Dendrol. 242. 1853), based on a previously\n\ndescribed section, Anthyllis sect. Aspalathoides DC. The publication of the generic name\n\nEpipogium R. Br. (Prodr. 330. 331. 1810) is validated by Robert Browns implicit reference\n\nto the excellent description of Epipogum in T. G, Gmelin, Fl. Sibir. 1: 11 (1747): he at~\n\nributed the name Epipogium to Gmelin.\n\nArticle 49\n\nFor purposes of valid publication names in Latin form given to hybrids,\n\nincluding nothomorphs, are subject to the same rules as are those of non~hybrid\n\ntaxa of corresponding ranks.\n\nNote 1. The parentage, so far as it is known, should be indicated.\n\nNote 2. A nothomorph is any hybrid form, whether F ı, segregate or backcross.\n\nArticle 50\n\nThe publication of the name of a monotypic new genus based on a new\n\nspecies is validated: either (1) by the provision of a combined generic and\n\nspecific description (descriptio generico~specifica); or (2) by the provision of\n\na plate with analyses showing essential characters; but the latter alternative\n\n________________________________________________________________\n\nInternational Code of Botanical Nomenclature, 1952 — Stockholm Code\n\n– 17 –\n\ntext: © 1952, IAPT — web-edition: © 2014, Paul van Rijckevorsel (all rights reserved)\n\n________________________________________________________________\n\n51~52 Species, valid publ.\n\napplies only to plates and generic names published before 1 Jan. 1908.\n\nNote. A description of a new species assigned to a monotypic new genus is treated\n\nalso as a generic description if the genus is not described.\n\nSimilarly, a description of a monotypic new genus based on a new species is treated\n\nalso as a specific description if the generic name and specific epithet are published together\n\nand the species is not described.\n\nExamples: The generic name Philgamia Baill. (in Grandidier. Hist. Madag. Pl. Atlas\n\n3: pl. 265. 1894) was validly published, as it appeared on a plate with analyses of P. hib~\n\nbertioides Baill. published before 1 Jan. 1908. ~ Strophioblachia fimbricalyx Boerl. (Handl.\n\nFl. Ned. Ind. 3 (1): 235. 1900) is a new species assigned to the monotypic new genus\n\nStrophioblachia published with a combined generic and specific description.\n\nRecommendation 50A\n\nA combined generic and specific description should mention the points in which the\n\nnew genus differs from its allies.\n\nArticle 51\n\nEpithets of subdivisions of genera and of species are not validly published\n\nunless the generic and specific names to which they are attached are validly\n\npublished at the same time or were published previously.\n\nExamples: The specific names Eragrostis minor and E. major were published in 1809\n\nby Host (Gram. Austr. 4: 15, 14) as substitutes for Poa eragrostis L. and Briza eragrostis\n\nL. respectively; these two names were cited as synonyms. As, however, the generic name\n\nEragrostis was not validly published until 1812 (Beauv. Agrost. 70), the names given by\n\nHost cannot be considered validly published.\n\nIn 1880, Müller Argoviensis (Flora 63: 286) published the new genus Phlyctidia with\n\nthe species Ph. hampeana n. sp., Ph. boliviensis (= Phlyctis boliviensis Nyl.), Ph. soredii~\n\nformis (= Phlyctis sorediiformis Krempelh.), Ph. brasiliensis (= Phlyctis brasiliensis Nyl.)\n\nand Ph. andensis (= Phlyctis andensis Nyl.). These specific names are, however, not\n\nvalidly published in this place, because the generic name Phlyctida is here a nomen\n\nnudum: Müller gave no generic diagnosis but only a description of the new species, Ph.\n\nhampeana. This description cannot validate the generic name as a descriptio generico~\n\nspecifica in accordance with Art. 50, since the new genus was not monotypic. The first\n\nvalid publication of the name Phlyctidia was made by Müller in 1895 (Hedwigia 34: 141),\n\nwhere a short generic diagnosis was given. The only species mentioned here were Ph. ludo~\n\nviciensis n. sp. and Ph. boliviensis (Nyl.) The latter combination was validly published in\n\n1895 by the reference to the basonym.\n\nArticle 52\n\nThe name of a species or of a subdivision of a species of recent plants\n\nis not validly published unless it is accompanied: either by (1) a description\n\nof the taxon or a citation of a previously and effectively published description\n\nof it; or by (2) a plate or figure with analyses showing essential characters;\n\nbut the latter alternative applies only to plates or figures and specific or\n\nsubdivisional names published before 1 Jan. 1908.\n\nExamples of validly published names of species.

In the absence of proof\n\nto the contrary, the date given in the work containing the name or epithet\n\nmust be treated as correct.\n\nOn and after 1 Jan. 1935 *) only the date of publication of the Latin\n\ndiagnosis can be taken into account for new taxa of recent plants. For new\n\ntaxa of fossil plants, on and after 1 Jan. 1912 the date is that of simultaneous\n\npublication of the description and figure (or if these are published at different\n\ndates, the later of the two dates).\n\nExamples: Specimens of Mentha foliicoma Opiz were distributed by Opiz in 1832, but\n\nthe name dates from 1882, when it was validly published by Déséglise (Bull.

For this purpose preliminary particles or letters that, strictly speaking, do not form\n\npart of the name, are suppressed, and the first letters are given without any omission.\n\n(F. Muell. for Baron Ferdinand von Mueller, not F. v. M. or F. v. Muell.).\n\nIf a name of one syllable is long enough to make it worth while to abridge it, the\n\nfirst consonants only are given (Fr. for Elias Magnus Fries); if the name has two or more\n\nsyllables, the first syllable and the first letter of the following one are taken, or the two\n\nfirst when both are consonants (Juss. for Jussieu, Rich. for Richard).\n\nWhen it is necessary to give more of a name to avoid confusion between names begin~\n\nning with the same syllable the same system is to be followed. For instance two syllables\n\nare given together with the one or two first consonants of the third; or one of the last\n\ncharacteristic consonants of the name is added (Bertol. for Bertoloni, to distinguish it from\n\nBertero; Michx. for Michaux, to distinguish it from Micheli).\n\nChristian names or accessory designations serving to distinguish two botanists of the\n\nsame name are abridged in the same way (Adr. Juss. for Adrien de Jussieu, Gaertn. f. for\n\nGaertner filius, R. Br. for Robert Brown, A. Br. for Alexander Braun).\n\nWhen it is a well~established custom to abridge a name in another manner, it is best\n\nto conform to it (L. for Linnaeus, DC. for De Candolle. St.~Hil. for Saint~Hilaire).\n\nRecommendation 60B\n\nIn the citation of a name published as a synonym, the words as synonym or pro\n\nsyn. should be added.\n\nWhen an author published as a synonym a manuscript name of another author, the\n\nword ex should be used to connect the names of the two authors.\n\nExample: Myrtus serratus Koenig ex Steudel, Nomencl. 321 (1821) pro syn., a\n\nmanuscript name of Koenigs published by Steudel as a synonym of Eugenia laurina Willd.\n\nRecommendation 60C\n\nIn the citation of a nomen nudum, its status should be indicated by adding nomen\n\nnudum (nom. nud.).\n\nRecommendation 60D\n\nThe citation of an author who published the name before the starting point of the\n\ngroup concerned is indicated, when considered useful or desirable, preferably between square\n\nbrackets or by the use of the word ex. This method is especially applicable in mycology\n\nwhen reference is made to authors earlier than Fries or Persoon.\n\nExamples: Lupinus [Tourn. Inst. 392. pl. 213. 1719] L. Sp. Pl. 721. 1753; Gen.

Retention of names or epithets of taxa\n\nwhich are remodelled or divided.\n\nArticle 61\n\nAn alteration of the diagnostic characters or of the circumscription of\n\na taxon does not warrant a change in its name, except as this may be\n\nnecessitated (1) by transference of the taxon (Art. 64~66), or (2) by its\n\nunion with another taxon of the same rank (Art. 67~69), or (3) by a change\n\nof its rank (Art. 70).\n\nExamples: The genus Myosotis as revised by R. Brown differs from the original genus\n\nof Linnaeus, but the generic name has not been changed, nor is a change allowable, since\n\nthe type of Myosotis L. remains in the genus. ~ Various authors have united with Centaurea\n\njacea L. one or two species which Linnaeus had kept distinct; the taxon so constituted must\n\nbe called Centaurea jacea L. sensu amplo or Centaurea jacea L. emend.

Pl. ed. 5. 1754); Tourneforts name\n\nHippocastanum must not be used as was done by Gaertner (Fruct. 2: 135. 1791).\n\nArticle 63\n\nWhen a species is divided into two or more species, the specific epithet\n\nmust be retained for one or them, or (if it has not been retained) must be\n\nreinstated. When a particular specimen was originally designated as the type,\n\nthe specific epithet must be retained for the species including that specimen.\n\nWhen no type was designated, a type must be chosen (see Appendix I).\n\nThe same rule applies to subdivisions of species, for example, to a sub~\n\nspecies divided into two or more subspecies, or to a variety divided into two\n\nor more varieties.\n\nExamples: Lychnis dioica L. (Sp. Pl. 437. 1753) was divided by Miller (Gard. Dict.\n\ned. 8. nos. 3, 4. 1768) into two species, L. dioica L. emend. Mill. and L. alba Mill. ~ Hoff~\n\nmann (Deutschl. Fl. 1: 166. 1800) divided Juncus articulatus L. (1753) into two species,\n\nJ. lamprocarpus Ehrh. and J. acutiflorus Ehrh. The name J. articulatus L. ought, however,\n\nto have been retained for one of the segregate species, and has been reinstated in the sense\n\nof J. lamprocarpus Ehrh. (see Briq. Prodr. Fl. Corse 1: 264. 1910). ~ Genista horrida DC.\n\n(Fl. franç. 4: 500. 1805) was divided by Spach (Ann. Sci. Nat. Bot. III. 2: 253. 1844)\n\ninto three species, G. horrida (Vahl) DC., G. boissieri Spach, and G. webbii Spach; the\n\nname G. horrida was rightly kept for the species including the plant from Jaca in Aragon\n\noriginally described by Vahl (Symb. 1: 51. 1790) as Spartium horridum. ~ Two species\n\n(Primula cashmiriana Munro, P. erosa Wall.) have been separated from Primula denticulata\n\nJ. E. Smith (Exot. Bot. 109, pl. 114. 1805) but the name P. denticulata has been rightly\n\nkept for the form which Smith described and figured under this name.\n\nSection 9. Retention of epithets of taxa below the rank of genus on trans~\n\nference to another genus or species.\n\nArticle 64\n\nWhen a subdivision of a genus *) is transferred to another genus (or\n\nplaced under another generic name for the same genus) without change of\n\nrank, its subdivisional epithet must be retained, or (if it has not been\n\nretained) must be reinstated unless one of the following obstacles exists:\n\n(1) that the resulting combination has been previously and validly published\n\nfor a different subdivision;\n\n(2) that there is available an earlier and validly published subdivisional\n\nepithet of the same rank;\n\n(3) that the resulting combination falls under the provisions of Art. 32.\n\nExample: Saponaria sect. Vaccaria DC., transferred to Gypsophila, becomes Gypsophila\n\nsect. Vaccaria (DC.) Godr.\n\n————————\n\n) Here and elsewhere in this Code the phrase subdivision of a genus refers only\n\nto taxa between genus and species in rank.\n\n________________________________________________________________\n\nInternational Code of Botanical Nomenclature, 1952 — Stockholm Code\n\n– 24 –\n\ntext: © 1952, IAPT — web-edition: © 2014, Paul van Rijckevorsel (all rights reserved)\n\n________________________________________________________________\n\nTransference 65~66\n\nArticle 65\n\nWhen a species is transferred to another genus (or placed under another\n\ngeneric name for the same genus), without change of rank, the specific epithet\n\nmust be retained or (if it has not been retained) must be reinstated, unless\n\none of the following obstacles exists:\n\n(1) that the resulting binary name is a later homonym (Art. 74) or a\n\ntautonym [ Art. 79 (3) ];\n\n(2) that there is available an earlier validly published specific epithet.\n\nWhen, on transference to another genus, the specific epithet has been\n\napplied erroneously in its new position to a different plant, the new combination\n\nmust be retained for the plant on which the epithet was originally based, and\n\nmust be attributed to the author who first published it.\n\nExamples: Antirrhinum spurium L. (Sp. Pl. 613. 1753) when transferred to the genus\n\nLinaria, must be called Linaria spuria (L.) Mill. (Gard. Dict. ed. 8. no. 15. 1768). ~\n\nChailletia hispida Oliv. (Fl. Trop. Afr. 1: 343. 1868) when placed under the generic name\n\nDichapetalum (an older name for the same genus) must be called Dichapetalum hispidum\n\n(Oliv.) Baill. (Hist. Pl. 5: 140. 1874). ~ Spartium biflorum Desf. (1798~1800) when trans~\n\nferred to the genus Cytisus by Spach in 1849, could not be called Cytisus biflorus, because\n\nthis name had been previously and validly published for a different species by lHéritier in\n\n1789; the name Cytisus fontanesii given by Spach is therefore legitimate. ~ Santolina sua~\n\nveolens Pursh (1814) when transferred to the genus Matricaria must be called Matricaria\n\nmatricarioides (Less.) Porter (1894); the epithet suaveolens cannot be used for this species\n\nin the genus Matricaria owing to the existence of Matricaria suaveolens L. (Fl. Suec. ed.\n\n2. 297. 1755), an earlier validly published name. ~ The specific epithet of Pinus merten~\n\nsiana Bong. was transferred to Tsuga by Carrière, who, however, erroneously applied\n\nthe new combination Tsuga mertensiana to another species of Tsuga, namely T. heterophylla\n\n(Raf.) Sargent, as is evident from his description: the combination Tsuga mertensiana\n\n(Bong.) Carr. must be retained for Pinus mertensiana Bong. when that species is placed in\n\nTsuga; the citation in parentheses (under Art. 59) of the name of the original author,\n\nBongard, indicates the type of the epithet.\n\nArticle 66\n\nWhen an infraspecific taxon is transferred, without change of rank, to\n\nanother genus or species (or placed under another name), the original sub~\n\ndivisional epithet must be retained or (if it has not been retained) must be\n\nreinstated, unless one of the following obstacles exists:\n\n(1) that the resulting ternary combination has been previously and validly\n\npublished for a subdivision based on a different type, even if that subdivision\n\nis of different rank;\n\n(2) that there is an earlier validly published subdivisional epithet available.\n\nWhen, on transference to another genus or species, the epithet of a\n\nsubdivision of a species has been applied erroneously in its new position to\n\na different subdivision of the same rank, the new combination must be retained\n\nfor the plant on which the former combination was based, and must be\n\nattributed to the author who first published it.\n\nExamples: The variety micranthum Gren. & Godr. (Fl. France 1: 171. 1847) of Helian~\n\nthemum italicum Pers., when transferred as a variety to H. penicillatum Thib., retains its\n\nvarietal epithet, becoming H. penicillatum var. micranthum (Gren. & Godr.) Grosser (Pflan~\n\nzenreich 14: 115. 1903). ~ The variety subcarnosa Hook. f. (Bot. Antarct. Voy. 1: 5. 1847)\n\nof Cardamine hirsuta L., when transferred as a variety to C. glacialis DC., becomes C.\n\nglacialis var. subcarnosa (Hook. f.) O. E. Schulz (Bot. Jahrb. 32: 542. 1903); the existance\n\nof an earlier synonym of different rank (C. propinqua Carm. Trans. Linn. Soc. 12: 507.\n\n1818) does not affect the nomenclature of the variety (see Art. 70). In each of these cases\n\nit is the earliest varietal epithet which is retained.\n\n________________________________________________________________\n\nInternational Code of Botanical Nomenclature, 1952 — Stockholm Code\n\n– 25 –\n\ntext: © 1952, IAPT — web-edition: © 2014, Paul van Rijckevorsel (all rights reserved)\n\n________________________________________________________________\n\n67~68 Union of taxa\n\nSection 10. Choice of names when taxa of the same rank are united.\n\nArticle 67\n\nWhen two or more taxa of the same rank are united the oldest legitimate\n\nname or (for subdivisions of genera, and for species and their subdivisions)\n\nthe oldest legitimate epithet is retained, unless a later name or epithet must be\n\naccepted under the provisions of Art. 68. The author who first unites taxa\n\nbearing names or epithets of the same date has the right to choose one of them,\n\nand his choice must be followed.\n\nExamples: K. Schumann (in Engler & Prantl, Nat. Pfl. fam. 3 (6): 5. 1890) uniting\n\nthe three genera Sloanea L. (1753), Echinocarpus Blume (1825) and Phoenicosperma Miq.\n\n(1865~1866) rightly adopted the oldest of these three generic names, Sloanea L., for the\n\nresulting genus. ~ If the two genera Dentaria L. (Sp. Pl. 653. 1753; Gen. Pl. ed. 5. 295.\n\n1754) and Cardamine L. (Sp. Pl. 654. 1753; Gen. Pl. ed. 5. 295. 1754) are united, the\n\nresulting genus must be called Cardamine because the name was chosen by Crantz (Class.\n\nCrucif. 126. 1769), who was the first to unite the two genera. ~ When H. Hallier (Bot.\n\nJahrb. 18: 123. 1893) united three species of Ipomoea, namely I. verticillata Forsk. (1775).\n\nI. rumicifolia Choisy (1834) and I. perrottetii Choisy (1845), he rightly retained the name\n\nI. verticillata Forsk. for the resulting species because verticillata is the oldest of the three\n\nspecific epithets. ~ Robert Brown (in Tuckey Narr. Exp. Congo App. 5. 484. 1818) ap~\n\npears to have been the first to unite Waltheria americana L. (Sp. Pl. 673. 1753) and\n\nW. indica L. (Sp. Pl. 673. 1753). He adopted the name Waltheria indica for the combined\n\nspecies, and this name must accordingly be retained.\n\nArticle 68\n\nWhen a taxon of recent plants, algae excepted, and a taxon, of the same\n\nrank, of fossil or subfossil plants are united, the correct name or epithet of\n\nthe former taxon must be accepted, even if it is antedated by that of the\n\nlatter.\n\nExample: If Sequoia Endl. (1847), a genus of recent plants, and Steinhauera Presl\n\n(1838), a genus of fossil plants, are united, the name Sequoia must be accepted for the\n\ncombined genus, although it is antedated by Steinhauera.\n\nRecommendation 68A\n\nAuthors who have to choose between two generic names should note the following\n\nsuggestions:\n\n(1) Of two names of the same date to prefer that which was first accompanied by the\n\ndescription of a species.\n\n(2) Of two names of the same date, both accompanied by descriptions of species, to prefer\n\nthat which, when the author makes his choice, includes the larger number of species.\n\n(3) In cases of equality from these various points of view to select the more appropriate\n\nname.\n\nRecommendation 68B\n\nWhen several genera are united under one generic name, under which they are treated\n\nas sections, the section including the type of the generic name adopted should bear that\n\nname unaltered if no earlier one is available.\n\nExamples: Anarrhinum sect. Anarrhinum; Hemigenia sect. Hemigenia.\n\nSection 11. Choice of names of fungi with a pleomorphic life cycle.\n\nArticle 69\n\nIn Ascomycetes and Basidiomycetes with two or more states in the life\n\ncycle (except those which are lichen~fungi), but not in Phycomycetes, the\n\n________________________________________________________________\n\nInternational Code of Botanical Nomenclature, 1952 — Stockholm Code\n\n– 26 –\n\ntext: © 1952, IAPT — web-edition: © 2014, Paul van Rijckevorsel (all rights reserved)\n\n________________________________________________________________\n\nChange of rank 70~72\n\nfirst valid name or epithet applied to the perfect state takes precedence. The\n\nperfect state is that which bears asci in the Ascomycetes, which consists of\n\nthe spores giving rise to basidia in the Uredinales and of the chlamydospores\n\nin the Ustilaginales, or which bears basidia in the remaining Basidiomycetes.\n\nThe type specimen of a state must bear that state. However, the provisions\n\nof this article shall not be construed as preventing the use of names of im~\n\nperfect states in works referring to such states. The author who first describes\n\na perfect state may adopt the specific epithet of the corresponding imperfect\n\nstate, but his binomial for the perfect state is to be attributed to him alone,\n\nand is not to be regarded as a transfer.\n\nWhen not already available, binomials for imperfect states may be\n\nproposed at the time of publication of a perfect state or later, and may contain\n\neither the specific epithet of the perfect state or any other epithet available.\n\nSection 12. Choice of names when the rank of a taxon is changed.\n\nArticle 70\n\nWhen the rank of a genus or infrageneric taxon is changed, the correct\n\nname or epithet is the earliest legitimate one available in the new rank. In\n\nno case does a name or an epithet have priority outside its own rank.\n\nExamples: The section Campanopsis R. Br. (Prodr. 561. 1810) of the genus Camp~\n\nanula was first raised to generic rank by Schrader, and as a genus must be called\n\nWahlenbergia Schrad. (Cat. Hort. Goett. 1814), not Campanopsis (R. Br.) O. Ktze (Rev.\n\n2: 378. 1891). ~ The var. foetida L. (Sp. Pl. 536. 1753) of Magnolia virginiana, when\n\nraised to specific rank, must be called Magnolia grandiflora L. (Syst. Nat. ed. 10. 1082.\n\n1759), not Magnolia foetida (L.) Sarg. (Gard. & For. 2: 615. 1889). ~ Lythrum inter~\n\nmedium Ledeb. (Ind. Hort. Dorpat 1822) when treated as a variety of Lythrum salicaria\n\nL. must be called L. salicaria var. glabrum Ledeb. (Fl. Ross. 2: 127. 1844), not L. salicaria\n\nvar. intermedium (Ledeb.) Koehne (Bot. Jahrb. 1: 327. 1881). In all these cases the name\n\nor epithet given to the taxon in its original rank is replaced by the first correct name or\n\nepithet given to it in its new rank.\n\nArticle 71\n\nWhen a taxon of a rank higher than a genus and not higher than an\n\norder is changed in rank, the stem of the name must be retained and only\n\nthe termination altered (~inae, ~eae, ~oideae, ~aceae, ~ineae, ~ales), unless\n\nthe resulting name is rejected under Section 13.\n\nRecommendation 71A\n\n1. When a section or a subgenus becomes a genus, or the inverse change occurs,\n\nthe original name or epithet should be retained unless it is rejected under the rules.\n\n2. When a subdivision of a species becomes a species, or the inverse change occurs,\n\nthe original epithet should be retained unless the resulting combination is rejected under\n\nthe rules.\n\nSection 13. Rejection of names and epithets.\n\nArticle 72\n\nA legitimate name or epithet must not be rejected merely because it is\n\ninappropriate, or disagreeable, or because another is preferable or better\n\nknown, or because it has lost its original meaning.\n\n________________________________________________________________\n\nInternational Code of Botanical Nomenclature, 1952 — Stockholm Code\n\n– 27 –\n\ntext: © 1952, IAPT — web-edition: © 2014, Paul van Rijckevorsel (all rights reserved)\n\n________________________________________________________________\n\n73~74 Rejection\n\nExamples: This rule was broken by the change of Staphylea to Staphylis, Tamus to\n\nThamnos, Thamnus or Tamnus, Mentha to Minthe, Tillaea to Tillia, Vincetoxicum to\n\nAlexitoxicum; and by the change of Orobanche rapum to O. sarothamnophyta, O. colum~\n\nbariae to O. columbarihaerens, O. artemisiae to O. artemisiepiphyta. All these modifications\n\nmust be rejected. ~ Ardisia quinquegona Blume (1825) must not be changed to A. penta~\n\ngona A. DC. (1834) although the specific epithet quinquegona is a hybrid word (Latin and\n\nGreek).\n\nArticle 73\n\nA name must be rejected if it is illegitimate (see Art. 2, 10).\n\nThe publication of an epithet in an illegitimate combination must not be\n\ntaken into consideration for purposes of priority (see Art. 53) except in the\n\nrejection of a later homonym (Art. 74).\n\nA specific epithet is not illegitimate merely because it was originally\n\npublished under an illegitimate generic name, but must be taken into consider~\n\nation for purposes of priority if the epithet and the corresponding combination\n\nare in other respects in accordance with the rules. In the same way an infra~\n\nspecific epithet may be legitimate even if originally published under an\n\nillegitimate name of an infrageneric taxon.\n\nA name is illegitimate in the following cases:\n\n(1) If it was nomenclaturally superfluous when published, i.e. if the taxon\n\nto which it was applied, as circumscribed by its author, included the type\n\nof a name or epithet which ought to have been adopted under one or more\n\nof the rules.\n\nExamples: The generic name Cainito Adans. (Fam. 2: 166. 1763) is illegitimate be~\n\ncause it was a superfluous name for Chrysophyllum L. (Sp. Pl. 192. 1753); the two genera\n\nhad precisely the same circumscription. ~ The genus Unisema Raf. (Med. Repos. 5: 192.\n\n1819) was so circumscribed as to include Pontederia cordata L., the type of Pontederia L.\n\n(1753). Under Art. 61 the name Pontederia L. ought to have been adopted for the genus\n\nconcerned. Unisema was therefore nomenclaturally superfluous. ~ Chrysophyllum sericeum\n\nSalisb. (Prodr. 138. 1796) is illegitimate, being a superfluous name for C. cainito L. (1753)\n\nwhich Salisbury cited as a synonym. ~ On the other hand, Cucubalus latifolius Mill. and\n\nC. angustifolius Mill. (Gard. Dict. ed. 8. nos. 3, 4. 1768) are not illegitimate names, al~\n\nthough these species are now reunited with C. behen L. (1753), from which Miller separated\n\nthem: C. latifolius Mill. and C. angustifolius Mill. as circumscribed by Miller did not in~\n\nclude the type of C. behen L.\n\n(2) If it is a binary or ternary name published in contravention of Art. 16,\n\n61, 63, 65 or 70, i.e. if its author did not adopt the earliest legitimate epithet\n\navailable for the taxon with its particular circumscription, position and rank.\n\n(3) If it is a later homonym (see Art. 74).\n\n(4) If it is a generic name which must be rejected under Art. 78.\n\n(5) If it is a name of a type subgenus with a subgeneric epithet which is\n\nnot the same as the generic name (see Art. 32).\n\n(6) If it is a specific name whose epithet must be rejected under Art. 79.\n\n(7) If it is an infraspecific name contravening Art. 79 or 80.\n\nArticle 74\n\nA name of a taxon is illegitimate and must be rejected if it is a later\n\nhomonym, that is if it duplicates a name previously and validly published for\n\na taxon of the same rank based on a different type. Even if the earlier\n\nhomonym is illegitimate, or is generally treated as a synonym on taxonomic\n\ngrounds, the later homonym must be rejected.\n\n________________________________________________________________\n\nInternational Code of Botanical Nomenclature, 1952 — Stockholm Code\n\n– 28 –\n\ntext: © 1952, IAPT — web-edition: © 2014, Paul van Rijckevorsel (all rights reserved)\n\n________________________________________________________________\n\nRejection 75~77\n\nWhen the same new name is simultaneously published for more than one\n\ntaxon, the first author who adopts one of them, rejecting the other, or sub~\n\nstitutes another name for one of them, must be followed.\n\nFor purposes of homonymy, validly published names in all taxa must\n\nbe considered.\n\nExamples: The generic name Tapeinanthus Boiss. ex Benth. (1848), given to a genus\n\nof Labiatae, is a later homonym of Tapeinanthus Herb. (1837), a name previously and\n\nvalidly published for a genus of Amaryllidaceae; Tapeinanthus Boiss ex Benth. must there~\n\nfore be rejected as was done by Th. Durand (Ind. Gen. Phan. 703. 1888) who renamed it\n\nThuspeinanta. ~ The generic name Amblyanthera Müll. Arg. (1860) is a later homonym\n\nof the validly published generic name Amblyanthera Blume (1849) and must therefore be\n\nrejected, although Amblyanthera Blume is now reduced to Osbeckia L. (1753). ~ Astra~\n\ngalus rhizanthus Boiss. (Diagn. Pl. Orient. 2: 83. 1843) is a later homonym of the validly\n\npublished name Astragalus rhizanthus Royle (Ill. Bot. Himal. 200. 1835) and it must there~\n\nfore be rejected, as was done by Boissier who renamed it A. cariensis (Diagn. Pl. Orient.\n\nII. 10: 57. 1849).\n\nLinnaeus (Sp. Pl. 1753) published Aira 1 spicata on p. 63 and Aira 7 spicata on p. 64,\n\nbut in errata (vol. 2, after Nomina trivialia and Addenda line 9 from base) sub~\n\nstituted indica for spicata of species 1 on p. 63; the name Aira spicata L. is therefore legi~\n\ntimate for species 7 on p. 64.\n\nNote. Mere orthographic variants of the same name are treated as homonyms when\n\nthey are based on different types (see Art. 82).\n\nArticle 75\n\nA name of a taxon must be rejected if it is used with different meanings,\n\nand so becomes a long~persistent source of error.\n\nExamples: The name Rosa villosa L. (Sp. Pl. 491. 1753) is rejected, because it has\n\nbeen applied to several different species, and has become a source of confusion. Lavandula\n\nspica L. (Sp. Pl. 572. 1753) included the two species subsequently known as L. officinalis\n\nChaix and L. latifolia Vill. The name Lavandula spica has been applied almost equally\n\nto these two species, and, being now completely ambiguous, must be rejected (see Kew\n\nBull. 1932: 295).\n\nArticle 76\n\nA name of a taxon must be rejected if its characters were derived from\n\ntwo or more entirely discordant elements, unless it is possible to select one\n\nof these elements as a satisfactory type.\n\nFor nomenclatural purposes names given to lichens shall be considered\n\nas applying to their fungal components, but shall be subject to the provisions\n\nof Art. 23 (d).\n\nExamples: The characters of the genus Schrebera L. (Sp. Pl. ed 2. 1662, 1763; Gen.\n\nPl. ed. 6. 124. 1764) were derived from the genera Cuscuta and Myrica (parasite and\n\nhost) (see Retz. Obs. 6: 15. 1791) ~ The characters of the genus Actinotinus Oliv. (Hook.\n\nIc. Pl. pl. 1740. 1888) were derived from the two genera Viburnum and Aesculus, owing\n\nto the insertion of the infloresence of a Viburnum in the terminal bud of an Aesculus by\n\na native collector. The names Schrebera and Actinotinus must therefore be abandoned.\n\nThe name of the genus Pouteria Aubl. (Pl. Gui. 85. 1775) is based on a mixture of\n\na species of Sloanea (Elaeocarpaceae) and a sapotaceous species (flowers and leaves);\n\nboth elements ean be easily separated, as has been done by Martius, and Radlkofer was\n\nright in proposing (Sitzber. Math.~Phys. Cl. Bayer. Akad. München 12: 299. 1882) to\n\nretain the name Pouteria as correct for the part of the type belonging to the Sapotaceae.\n\nArticle 77\n\nA name or epithet of a taxon must be rejected when it is based on a\n\nmonstrosity.\n\nExamples: The generic name Uropedium Lindl. (Orch. Linden 28. 1846) was based\n\n________________________________________________________________\n\nInternational Code of Botanical Nomenclature, 1952 — Stockholm Code\n\n– 29 –\n\ntext: © 1952, IAPT — web-edition: © 2014, Paul van Rijckevorsel (all rights reserved)\n\n________________________________________________________________\n\n78~79 Illegitimate generic names\n\non a monstrosity which is now referred to Phragmopedilum caudatum Rolfe (Orchid Rev.\n\n4: 330. 1896); it must therefore be rejected. ~ The name Ornithogalum fragiferum Vill.\n\n(Hist. Pl. Dauph. 2: 269. 1787) was based on a monstrosity, and must therefore be rejected.\n\nOn transference to the genus Gagea the specific epithet fragiferum must also be rejected:\n\nthe oldest name for the normal plant being Ornithogalum fistulosum Ram. ex DC. (1805),\n\nthe species must be called Gagea fistulosa (Ram. ex DC.) Ker~Gawl.\n\nArticle 78\n\nNames of genera are illegitimate in the following special cases and must\n\nbe rejected:\n\n(1) When they are merely words not intended as names.\n\n(2) When they coincide with technical terms currently used in morphology,\n\nunless they were accompanied, when originally published, by specific names\n\nin accordance with the binary method of Linnaeus. On and after 1 Jan. 1912,\n\nall new generic names coinciding with such technical terms are unconditionally\n\nrejected.\n\n(3) When they are unitary designations of species.\n\n(4) When they consist of two words, unless these words were from the\n\nfirst combined into one, or joined by a hyphen.\n\nExamples: (1) Anonymos Walt. (Fl. Carol. 2, 4, 9, etc. 1788) must be rejected as\n\nbeing a word applied to 28 different genera by Walter to indic"
