        "text": "The exine morphology of pollen grains of Stachytarpheta indica (Linn.) Vahl, Stachytarpheta cayennensis (Rich.) Vahl and Stachytarpheta angustifolia (Mill.) Vahl is reported. This study was carried out with a light microscope. Pollen grains from fresh anthers were collected and aceolysed. Statistical analysis used to analyse the data collected include cluster analysis, correlation analysis, similarity and distance indices. The pollen grains are spheroidal to oblate to sub-oblate in shape. They are aperturate, both colpate and porate. Tricolpate types occur most frequently, acolpate, monocolpate, bicolpate and tetracolpate types less frequently. The multicolpate and multiporate attributes in all the species indicate that the genus is not primitive in evolutionary history and this species probably, evolved around in the same time. According to the size, the pollen grains of the genus falls into groups permagna (pollen diameter 100-200 μm) and giganta (pollen diameter greater than 200 μm). S. cayennensis and S. anguistifolia belong to group permagna and S. indica only in the group giganta. This separates S. indica from the other two species. The large pollen grain size in the genus clearly supports the fact that the flowers in the genus are more insect-and-bird pollinated than wind pollinated. The similarity and distance indices of the species showed that S. cayennensis and S. angustifolia are the closest. S. indica is closer to S. angustifolia but farther from S. cayennensis.\n\nMalaysia has an estimated 15,000 species of vascular plants. Located in the Malesian region, its affinity is Sundaic, having common elements with Sumatra, Java and Palawan. The two halves of Malaysia, Peninsular Malaysia extending from mainland Asia and East Malaysian states of Sabah and Sarawak on the island of Borneo have their own distinct floristic components. Peninsular Malaysia has about 8,200 species of vascular plants and Sabah and Sarawak have an estimated 12,000 species. The flora of Sabah and Sarawak is generally richer than that of Peninsular Malaysia. Due to historical reasons, the flora of Malaysia project is planned in a phased approach. The Tree Flora of Sabah and Sarawak project, initiated in 1991, represents the first systematic modern attempt to document some of the important plant families of these two states. It would take at least another ten years to complete this project. It is estimated that the Flora of Peninsular Malaysia project, initiated in 2005, will take at least 20 years to complete. To achieve these ambitions, there must be continual support in skilled manpower and fund allocations."
