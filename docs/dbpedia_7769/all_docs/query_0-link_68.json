        "text": "We’re too excited not to share this press release with you guys…\n\nSAN FRANCISCO, Sept. 2, 2014 – Faith No More, who reunited in 2009 for a series of sold out performances and international festivals, is currently recording their first full-length album since 1997’s Album of the Year.\n\nA limited edition (5000 copies) 7-inch single of the song “Motherfucker” will precede the April 2015 release, available via Record Store Day’s Black Friday event (Nov. 28). The single will be released digitally on Dec. 9.\n\n“We’ve always shared a chemistry between ourselves that’s unique to this band, but these past few years of touring together have made us aware that we not only play better as a unit, but we like the new stuff we’re coming up with,” explained Faith No More founder and bass player, Bill Gould, who also spoke with Rolling Stone in more detail. “So we’ve decided: we’re going to get busy in 2015…make an album we’re proud of, kick things up a notch, get out there and perform it and maybe even dedicate a little more focus to our fans in the States this time.”\n\nThe as-of-yet untitled album is being recorded in an Oakland, Calif. studio with Gould handling production. The release will be the first from Faith No More’s newly formed imprint, Reclamation Recordings, which will be distributed by Ipecac Recordings.\n\nPrior to the new album’s release, Faith No More will headline Australia’s Soundwave Festival in February 2015. Worldwide tour dates will be announced soon.\n\nFaith No More is Mike Bordin (drums), Roddy Bottum (keyboards), Bill Gould (bass), Jon Hudson (guitar) and Mike Patton (vocals)."
