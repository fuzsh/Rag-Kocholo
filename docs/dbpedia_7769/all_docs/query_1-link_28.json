        "text": "California (Warner Bros, 1999), the third Mr Bungle album, is another chaotic assembly of semiotic signs, except that this time they are funneled through well-structured (and catchy) songs. Sweet Charity lines up western soundtracks, cocktail jazz, exotica, tv themes, operatic singing and doo-wop vocalizing in the parodistic style of early Frank Zappa. The Air-Conditioned Nightmare, that romps through a rapid-fire procession of vocal styles of the 1950s and 1960s, is virtually another homage to Zappa.\n\nNone Of Them Knew They Were Robots is a swing novelty in the vein of Brian Setzer with dancing organ, cartoonish sound effects, roaring standup bass, feisty horns and an ever changing breakneck rhythm. Ars Moriendi is a comic rendesvouz of ethnic folk styles played with grindcore intensity.\n\nThe avantgarde cut-up techniques that Patton has learned from the likes of Frank Zappa and John Zorn have been coerced into a virtuoso compositional science of shifting tempos and derivative arrangements. Layers of studio treachery disorient the listener, and the melody is often like a moving target, but ultimately everything makes sense, and what was raw creative exuberance on Mr Bungle has now evolved into a refined musical language.\n\nBut the joke wears thin after the fifth song. A couple of more experimental pieces, Spruance's Golem II (a hybrid of Kraftwerk, George Clinton and Phish) and Patton's Goodbye Sober Day (a confused merry-go-round of ethnic and heavy-metal sounds), are not enough to provide a viable exit strategy for the concept.\n\nFor Fantomas' The Director's Cut (Ipecac, 2001), Patton recruited Dave Lombardo (Slayer), Trevor Dunn (Mr Bungle) and Buzz Osborne (Melvins): what a waste. All they can do is parody 16 tv and movie soundtracks.\n\nMaldoror is a collaboration with Merzbow.\n\nTomahawk is a supergroup formed by Mike Patton, Jesus Lizard's guitarist Duane Denison, Cows' bassist Kevin Rutmantis, and Helmet's drummer John Stanier that released Anonymous (Ipecac, 2007) Mit Gas (Ipecac, 2008).\n\nMike Patton has also recorded with Ikue Mori and John Zorn the album Hemophiliac (Tzadik, 2002). The trio of sax, voice and computer improvises with the fury of Jimi Hendrix and Sonny Sharrock.\n\nMillennium Monsterwork 2000 (Ipecac, 2002) documents a live performance by Melvins and Fantomas.\n\nSecret Chiefs 3 is an instrumental offshoot of Mr Bungle led by Trey Spruance. First Grand Constitution and Bylaws (Web Of Mimicry, 1998), Second Grand Constitution and Bylaws (Web Of Mimicry, 1999), Eyes of Flash Eyes of Flame (Web Of Mimicry, 2000), and Book M (Web Of Mimicry, 2001) mix Middle Eastern and Indian music, Ennio Morricone's soundtracks and dance beats. Book of Horizons (Web of Mimicry, 2004) evokes suspense-filled James Bond movies (The End Times), Ennio Morricone's melancholy themes (The Exile, absolutely worthy of the master's repertory, and Book T Exodus), swirling Middle-eastern dances (The 4, The 3), apocalyptic grindcore (Exterminating Angel, Hypostasis Of The Archons), Frank Zappa-esque orchestral music (The Owl In Daylight, DJ Revisionist), and even circus music (Welcome To The Theatron Animatronique).\n\nMr Bungle's guitarist Trey Spruance is also active in Asva with guitarist John Schuller, bassist Stuart Dahlquist, Burning Witch's drummer, vocalist Jessika Kenney and an organist: Futurist's Against the Ocean (Web of Mimicry, 2005) contains four lengthy doom/droning tracks a` la Earth. What You Don't Know Is Frontier (Southern, 2008), featuring a new vocalist (Holly Johnson), a new guitarist and a new organist (Troy Swanson), is an even denser drone-fest for vocals, guitars, percussions, keyboards and wind instruments.\n\nPath Of Most Resistance (Mimicry, 2007) compiles tracks from Secret Chiefs 3's albums. Xaphan - Book of Angels Volume 9 (2008) is Secret Chiefs 3 (eleven players) playing John Zorn's Masada Book Two.\n\nFantomas' Delerium Cordia (Ipecac, 2004) is a 74-minute chamber concerto for rock band, vocalist and electronics that ranges from gentle to bombastic, from harrowing to demented, from cacophonous to delirious, its sculpting of ambience inspired by progressive-rock, glitch electronica, post-rock and dark metal (and perhaps decades of cinematic soundtracks).\n\nThe suite opens in an atmosphere of suspense with gothic overtones: ghostly sounds, monk-like chanting, massive riffs. But then a mad musique-concrete collage of voices, noises and instruments sends the whole concept spinning into a post-psychedelic dimension. At 40 minutes a strong wind sweeps all the music away. More musique-concrete passages ensue, with a brief reference to Karlheinz Stockhausen's Hymnen. Then Fantomas turns to \"deep listening\" music, although its form of minimalism is constantly in motion. Sonic events keep happening even though little seems to be changing, whether cadaveric whispers or rain and birds in the woods or vehement guitar riffs. The last nine minutes are virtually silence.\n\nAlas, such an ambitious concept lacks focus and cohesion. It is the atonal equivalent of a melodic fantasy but too often it sounds like a casual collection of musical ideas rather than an organic piece of composition/improvisation. It is both pretentious and visionary, but also self-indulgent (there are almost 20 minutes total of near silence). Pared down to a 15-minute suite, this would have been a classic of a new genre. At 74 minutes, this is yet another manifestation of the borderless ego of musicians who live in the age of cheap CD manufacturing.\n\nRomances (Ipecac, 2004) is a collaboration between Mike Patton and Kaada.\n\nTrevor Dunn, in the meantime, vented his free-jazz ambitions with the albums credited to the Trio Convulsant: Debutantes & Centipedes (october 1997 - Buzz, 1998), with drummer Kenny Wollesen and guitarist Adam Levy, and Sister Phantom Owl Fish (february 2004 - Ipecac, 2004), with Mary Halvorson (guitar) and Ches Smith (drums). Fantomas' Suspended Animation (Ipecac, 2005) returned to the cartoonish-thrash Raymond Scott-ian format of Fantomas' debut. Reneging on its predecessor's monster suite (but actually recorded at the same time), their fourth album was convoluted, hysterical and (mainly) fragmented (most tracks lasting about one minute). Basically, the supergroup (Patton, Slayer's Dave Lombardo, the Melvins' Buzz Osbourne, Mr Bungle's Trevor Dunn) moved from one ambitious project (the super-extended suite) to another ambitious project (the super-frantic collage). Neither was fully satisfying, although both prove Patton's stature as a composer, leader and vocalist.\n\nGeneral Patton vs The X-ecutioners (2005) is a collaboration with DJ crew X-Excutioners.\n\nMike Patton took a holiday from his experimental projects to deliver the mildly entertaining Peeping Tom (Ipecac, 2006), a collection of pop songs wrapped in electronic garments that are more typical of hip-hop music than of hard-rock. While one or two numbers are catchy (Moho, Don't Even Trip), most of the album wants to rely too much on Patton's lyrics (gasp) and on his vocals.\n\nSince 2001 Trevor Dunn plays contrabass in a New York-based duo with Stars Like Fleas' harpist Shelley Burgon. They recorded At Blim (2005) with koto player Brett Larner. Baltimore (Skirt, 2006) is a collection of harp and bass duets that belong to the realm of dissonant and improvised chamber music. They mostly sound like Keith Rowe or Fred Frith toying with other instruments rather than the usual guitar. Except that they occasionally pick up rhythm, in which case they sound more like a distorted, cacophonous version of the Penguin Caf√® Orchestra. Shelley Burgon comes through as one of the most original harp improvisers since Zeena Parkins and Carol Emanuel, and one with a vast range of sound, from abstract noise to jazzy counterpoint.\n\nMike Patton also scored the soundtrack for the films Crank High Voltage (Lakeshore, 2009) and Solitude of Prime Numbers (Ipecac, 2011).\n\nImperial Teen continued to reunite and record although at longer and longer intervals: The Hair The TV The Baby & The Band (2007) contains It's Now and little else. Feel the Sound (2012) contains a couple of decent songs (Runaway and Last to Know) that would have made for a decent single, but instead melt down in an awful album.\n\nMike Patton came up with his most delirious project when he decided to remake Italian pop songs backed by a symphonic orchestra and a choir on Mondo Cane (2010), one of the most bizarre cover albums of all times. Another Italian-themed work, The Solitude of Prime Numbers (2011) was the score to a film adaptation of Paolo Giordano's novel.\n\nSol Invictus (2015), Faith No More's first album in 18 years, with the same lineup of back then, i.e. Mike Patton (vocals), Mike Bordin (drums), Roddy Bottum (keyboards, vocals), Billy Gould (bass) and Jon Hudson (guitar), contains the catchy Sunny Side Up and Motherfucker. next to more traditional prog-metal songs like Superhero and Separation Anxiety.\n\nFaith No More's original vocalist Chuck Mosley died in 2017."
