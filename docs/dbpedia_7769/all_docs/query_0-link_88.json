        "text": "Of all the heavyweights of modern hard rock, Faith No More are surely the trickiest to pin down. With a sound too often simplified as ‘alt.metal’, these visionaries blazed their trail with a sense of sheer fearlessness, building on proggy funk-rock foundations with sounds as diverse as jazz, lounge, post-punk, thrash and synth-pop, crafting a catalogue that feels gleefully avant-garde. By turns frivolous, solemn and downright demented, their work has felt like a perpetually shifting picture. Never, however, has it been less than electrifying.\n\nWhat started as a collective (featuring bassist Billy Gould and drummer Mike “Puffy” Bordin) under the banner Sharp Young Men all the way back in 1979, metamorphosed into Faith No Man in 1981, then Faith No More following the departure of original vocalist/guitarist Mike “The Man” Morris and the arrival of keyboardist Roddy Bottum. Wildcard guitarist Jim Martin would join in 1983, as they cycled through a slew of singers – from the infamous Courtney Love to the late Chuck Mosley – who helped crystallise their conceptual sound. It wasn’t until Chuck stepped aside for visionary Mr. Bungle singer Mike Patton in 1988, though, that they became the world-beaters we know today.\n\nAnd still, there is fizzling expectation amongst the fanbase that maybe, just maybe, new music could be added to their seven albums thus far. For now, though, we’re looking back across those unruly, still utterly unmatched existing albums to plot the top 20 musical moments that made Faith No More the legends we worship today…\n\n‘I'd like to peel the skin off / This winter day,’ Mike Patton sings on this latter-day standout, combining dense, mesmeric lyricism and a sense of gothy, shoegaze foreboding. ‘I'd like to bone the head off / This summer fling / What love can do when love's lost…’ Coming on like Nick Cave at his most heavyweight for its first half, Cone Of Shame pulls loose in the second, in an almost feral state of shame and desperation. After nearly two decades away, fans had been asking whether these were the same trailblazing risk-takers who’d stamped their mark on the ’90s. Cone Of Shame answered resoundingly in the affirmative. Nothing to be ashamed of here.\n\nThe third single on FNM’s first album with Mike Patton (1989’s aptly titled The Real Thing), Falling To Pieces made its mark on the rock charts the following year, but never really nailed down its place in subsequent live sets. It’s a wonder, given quite how infectiously feel-good the combination of bass-driven composition and Mike’s dextrous vocals (switching between percussive funkiness and a more anthemic sweep) still sounds today. The Ralph Ziman-directed music video shapeshifts with the sort of absurdist expressionism that would become synonymous with grunge in the years that followed, but FNM were drawing from a far more vibrant palette.\n\n‘Sink the eight ball / Buy the lady a drink / And nobody knows my name,’ announces the opening verse of this Angel Dust classic. ‘Bodies float up / From the bottom of the river / Like bubbles in fine champagne…’ Reportedly named after a black drug kingpin who, with strange sincerity, compared his long reach and iron grip to that of Adolf Hitler, the irony and high-contrast imagery is strong here. Distending the high-energy playfulness of disco through the warped Faith No More lens, the music more than matches up, with urgent, high-sheen synths standing out against the scratchy guitars and restless bass, as Mike’s distorted vocals sink deep into a chaotic mix.\n\nStarting with a piano line that could have been lifted straight from the opening titles of some frothy eighties TV melodrama, Everything’s Ruined promptly spirals into a cutting chronicle of depression. Swelling through its euphoric choruses before sinking into passages of deep melancholia, the song appears to be a dissection of a failed relationship between a couple who believed a baby could save their marriage (‘We were like ink and paper / Numbers on a calculator / Knew arithmetic so well / Working overtime completed what was assigned / We had to multiply ourselves / A bouncing little baby / A shiny copper penny…’) and the crushing realisation that they had failed. The infamously shonky Ken Kerslake-directed music video, featuring the band goofing around in front of a blue screen, was apparently the result of them having spunked their whole album promo budget on the previous cuts for Small Victory and Midlife Crisis. It’s still somehow a classic.\n\nWhen it dropped on November 28, 2014, Motherfucker felt like an inexplicably bizarro bolt from the blue from a band who’d not released original music in almost 18 years. What initially appears to be a spoken-word assault on the foie gras trade (‘Force fed more than we eat in the wild / Grazed on a mash that can suffocate a child / Bloated, promoted in an ode to pomped style / Moistened in the feed while we choke upon the bile…’) expands into a far broader song about accountability and the dangers of unchecked power and status. There’s something almost farcical about the build of slow-pressed keys and rat-a-tat drums, but the grandstanding six-string pay-off and sheer catharsis of that ‘Hello motherfucker!’ sing-along segues proceedings perfectly from ridiculousness to the sublime.\n\nThe rich acoustic guitar riff over the opening two minutes of The Real Thing’s beguiling fifth track – part campfire lullaby, part murder-ballad – might just be Faith No More at their most richly melodic. As the track unfurls its deeper imagery, however – imagining living-dead cannibalism as a metaphor for co-dependency in a toxic relationship – it becomes harder-edged and more melodramatic, capturing the feel of a dream gone bad. The lyrics here sound like Faith No More at their most chaotic and contradictory (‘So hug me and kiss me / Then wipe my butt and piss me / I hope you never leave / ’Cause who would hear me scream…’) but they’re also amongst their most achingly profound.\n\nNow an outspoken advocate for gay rights and one half of the incredible MAN ON MAN project with his partner Joey Holman, it’s hard to imagine a time when FNM keyboardist Roddy Bottum was yet to come out. That was the case in 1992, however, as Be Aggressive powered its way up the charts with Mike Patton relishing barely-veiled lyrical hints like, ‘I swallow!’ and, ‘You’re the master / And I take it on my knees…’ Superbly constructed from its funky bassline and rattling percussion to Roddy’s grandstanding, er, organ-work, and an infamous cheerleader-chant (‘B-E A-G-G-R-E-S-S-I-V-E’), this was a masterpiece of foreshadowing imperiously elevated by the message within.\n\nA song about the inevitable ups and downs of life’s rollercoaster ride – and the grim inevitability of death – the sort-of title-track to 1995’s King For A Day… Fool For A Lifetime is a compelling snapshot of post-breakthrough FNM reckoning on the meaning(lessness) of it all. Unfurling across six-and-a-half epic minutes, Billy Gould’s bass and an assortment of jangling acoustic guitars propel Mike Patton’s allegorical tale of having finally gained the status to be invited to the best party in town, only to realise that your time to sit back with a little bit of the bubbly is running out. ‘Sniff the glass and let it roll around on your tongue / Let me introduce you to someone before the party is done…’ he reckons, in a sort of starstruck stupor before realising his mistake with that unforgettable parting plea: ‘Don’t let me die with that silly look in my eyes…’ Weirdly chilling.\n\nConceived during that same sleep-deprivation study as Land Of Sunshine, Caffeine is slightly more transparent in its titular inspiration. The broader lyrics are every bit as impenetrable, mind. ‘The world expects the pose, perfectly natural (loosen up) / Smearing wet concrete and swearing you'll never be (caught),’ Mike snarls at one point, before rising into a stirring croon: ‘At your weakest, etched in stone / And we're frozen here, peeking / Almost, sweet talk, caffeine.’ Then the whole thing careers off the rails with a passage of corrosive threat: ‘I'm warning you / I'm warning you / I'm fucking you / I'm warning you!’ Bemusing stuff, for sure, but a powerful instrumental ebb and flow keeps us going like a hot cup of joe.\n\n‘Peace ain't coming our way / But the sun keeps burning my face / Where's my faith? / My blasphemy…’ Translating from the Latin as ‘Unconquered Sun’, Faith No More’s seventh album saw them eschew formula with a more naturalistic approach, trading synths for piano and embracing the organic darkness of goth icons Siouxsie And The Banshees – whose 1978 classic Switch they’d slipped into the setlist for their ongoing reunion tour. At a mere 157 seconds, the opening title-track should be (and was perhaps intended as) an appetiser before proceedings properly get started. Mike’s alternation between doomy baritone and near-falsetto whine take centre stage, with soft-pressed keys, whispering percussion, understated guitars and deeply atmospheric synths rounding out their return with the kind of accomplished subtlety that could only ever have come from this band.\n\nWhen Faith No More’s sixth (at the time, presumably final) LP dropped on June 3, 1997, it felt like an almighty shambles. Sardonically titled Album Of The Year, it was a collection of songs by artists whose minds were elsewhere. Mike Patton was preoccupied with Fantômas and Mr. Bungle amongst other projects. Billy Gould was involved with bands like Brujeria and Milk Cult, while also expanding his production portfolio. Mike Bordin was getting to rock out with Black Sabbath, while Roddy Botttum was caught up in Imperial Teen. The first of two massive stand-outs, though, Ashes To Ashes feels like a compelling sequel to 1992’s dark romantic benchmark Midlife Crisis, built from snarling riffs, near-ethereal croons and a chorus for the ages. ‘Smiling with the mouth of the ocean,’ indeed…\n\nThe second Album Of The Year highlight delves right back into the moody darkness of the band’s earliest days. ‘This is getting old / And so are you,’ it announces, almost too obviously drawing an arrow towards their impending dissolution. ‘Everything you know / And never knew / Will run through your fingers / Just like sand.’ Erupting in one of the band’s all-time great choruses, however, the track transforms into a knowing invitation for fans to indulge in one last miserabilist gulp before they go, while the repeated closing mantra ‘You might surprise yourself’ feels, retrospectively, like a tease for their eventual return. The strikingly odd, Joseph Kahn-directed music video is an open homage to Alfred Hitchcock’s Vertigo and stars modern Hollywood great Jennifer Jason Leigh.\n\nFaith No More’s breakthrough hit does exactly what it says on the tin. Narrowing focus from that opening widescreen riff to a thumping bass and Mike’s hooky-as-hell rap (the singer was apparently trying to invoke the same feel as Blondie’s Rapture), the track became an early ’90s anthem, offering the same funkiness and flair as early Red Hot Chili Peppers with far more mystery and heft. Hell, the music video – featuring a slimy rainstorm and exploding pianos amongst other trippy imagery – was enough to make the mind boggle in and of itself. And, although it has been suggested by members of the band that lyrics like, ‘It's dark, it's moist, it's a bitter pain / It's sad, it happened, and it's a shame’ are about “jerking off”, any number of innuendos could be read into its maniacal rant. Most likely, we reckon, they were toying with a contrarian lack of meaning: ‘What is it? It’s it!’"
