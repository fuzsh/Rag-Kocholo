        "text": "In early 1984, San Francisco alt. rock band Faith No More acquired a new singer, not necessarily by choice. As keyboard player Roddy Bottum recalls, 19-year-old Courtney Love \"basically demanded to sing\". Bassist Bill Gould remembers the singer as “a chaotic personality” who created “a whirlwind of shit” with the band, which was very much part of Faith No More's aesthetic in their earliest years together.\n\nLove, then going by the name 'Courtney Henley', featured in Faith No More's very first TV appearance, just two months after joining the group. Broadcast in the spring of 1984 on Viacom Public Access channel 25, the 28-minute feature includes a highly entertaining interview with the band, who Roddy Bottum claims play \"psychedelic death rock.\" When the interviewer enquires whether the band have any links to the psychedelic era, Love says, \"My parents were hippies and I hate them. This is my rebellion.\"\n\n\"She went to the flower mart early in the morning and brought bags and bags of flowers for the shoot,\" Bottum recalled in the band's biography Small Victories: The True Story Of Faith No More by Adrian Harte. \"We covered the stage with flowers and wore dashikis and burned incense. In the punk scene of San Francisco, this was completely audacious.\"\n\nWatch the full programme below:\n\nLove's final show with Faith No More took place on June 17, 1984."
