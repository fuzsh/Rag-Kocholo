        "text": "Faith No More have debuted an eerie and heavy new song titled “Cone of Shame,” which will appear on their upcoming album Sol Invictus, at a gig in Tokyo. Keyboardist Roddy Bottum confirmed the song’s title, listed as “untitled” in a video upload, on Twitter (via Metal Injection).\n\nThe tune, which frontman Mike Patton sang partially from behind a red bandanna, begins with a sparse, Spaghetti Western guitar line. After military drums kick in, Patton sings about wanting to blow his head off and lost love, leading to the “cone of shame” metaphor. The song eventually kicks into heavy, high gear with Patton alternating vocals between snarling about stripping bones over thrash riffing. The song is like one big crescendo with jangling guitars, crushing rhythms and Patton exclaiming, “You’re only happy when you’re pissing me off.”\n\nLast year, the band premiered “Motherfucker,” its first new song in 17 years via Rolling Stone. They later played the tune, as well as the Sol Invictus track (and next single) “Superhero,” at San Francisco’s Amoeba Records as part of a Record Store day event.\n\nThe group will be bringing those songs to North American stages this spring when it hits the road in April and May.\n\nTrending\n\n“Hypnotic and gothic, we’re coming back to where we were with our first album,” bassist and producer Bill Gould said of Sol Invictus in a statement. “Then Patton’s being Patton, crooning, screaming, with a bit of soul underneath it all. We’ve always taken strange influences and smashed them together.”"
