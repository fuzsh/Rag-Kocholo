        "text": "Now that the Class Of 2020 has been announced, its time to announce the second edition of my Top 25 Snubs!\n\nBefore we enter, I’ll reveal how I decided on which artists to include, as well as what certain marks mean.\n\nI judged each artist by innovation, influence, critical success, and commercial success.\n\nI also factored in seniority and how long each act has had to wait.\n\nA dagger or cross indicates the person in question is deceased, while an asterisk indicates the person has received a prior induction.\n\nAnd of course, I am well aware that there are quite a few worthy picks missing from the list. Trust me, I will punch myself for not including certain acts.\n\nHonorable Mentions\n\n-Chic\n\nGenre: R&B/Soul, Disco, Funk\n\nMembers: AlfaAnderson,Tom Coppola,Bernard Edwards†,, LuciMartin, Niles Rogers*,Tony Thompson†\n\nKey Recordings: Chic(1977),C’est Chic(1978),Risqué(1979)\n\n-Barry White†\n\nGenre: R&B/Soul, Disco\n\nKey Recordings: “Never, Never Gonna Give Ya Up” (1973), Can’t Get Enough (1974)\n\nEligible Since: 1998\n\nPreviously Nominated: Never nominated\n\n-Megadeth\n\nGenre: Thrash Metal, Heavy Metal\n\nMembers: David Ellefson, Marty Friedman, Nick Menza†, Dave Mustaine, Chris Poland, Gar Samuelson†\n\nKey Recordings: Killing Is My Business…And Business Is Good (1985), Peace Sells…But Who’s Buying?

A: We Are DEVO! (1978), Duty Now For The Future (1979), Freedom Of Choice (1980)\n\nEligible Since: 2004\n\nPreviously Nominated: 2019\n\nBacking Groups Left Out Of Their Frontpeople’s Inductions:\n\nThe Belmonts, backing group for Dion\n\nMembers: Angelo D’Aleo, Carlo Mastrangelo†, Fred Milano†\n\nBig Brother & The Holding Company, backing group for Janis Joplin\n\nMembers: Sam Andrew†, Peter Albin, Dave Getz, James Gurley†\n\nCrazy Horse, backing group for Neil Young\n\nMembers: Nils Lofgren*, Ralph Molina, Frank “Poncho” Sampedro, Billy Talbot, Danny Whitten†\n\nThe Mothers Of Invention, backing band for Frank Zappa\n\nMembers: Jimmy Carl Black†, Napoleon Murphy Brock, Ray Collins†, George Duke†, Roy Estrada, Bruce Fowler, Tom Fowler, Bunk Gardner, Ralph Humphrey, Billy Mundi†, Don Preston, Jim “Motorhead” Sherwood†, Chester Thompson, Art Tripp, Ian Underwood, Ruth Underwood\n\nThe Patti Smith Group, backing band for Patti Smith\n\nMembers: Jay Dee Daugherty, Lenny Kaye, Ivan Kral†, Richard Sohl†\n\nThe Silver Bullet Band, backing band for Bob Seger\n\nMembers: Drew Abbott, Chris Campbell, Charlie Allen Martin, Alto Reed, Robyn Robins, David Teegarden\n\nThe Wailers, backing band for Bob Marley\n\nMembers: Al Anderson, Ashton Barrett, Carlton Barrett†, Tyrone Downie, Marcia Griffiths, Earl Lindo†, Rita Marley, Junior Marvin, Judy Mowatt, Alvin Patterson, Peter Tosh†, Bunny Wailer\n\nWings, backing group for Paul McCartney\n\nMembers: Joe English, Denny Laine*, Linda McCartney†, Jimmy McCulloch†, Denny Seiwell\n\n25. Faith No More\n\nGenre: Alternative Metal, Funk Metal, Alternative Rock, Experimental Rock\n\nMembers: Mike Bordin, Roddy Bottum, Billy Gould, Jim Martin, Chuck Moseley†, Mike Patton\n\nKey Recordings: Introduce Yourself (1987), The Real Thing (1989), Angel Dust (1992)\n\nEligible Since: 2011\n\nPreviously Nominated: Never nominated\n\nBest known among mainstream fans for their 1989 hit “Epic”, Faith No More have been trailblazers in Modern Rock throughout their career, bending heavy metal to include funk, hip hop, progressive rock, jazz, post-punk, and whatever they feel like at the moment. Their studio albums The Real Thing and Angel Dust serve as benchmarks among left-of-center groups through the modern era. However, FNM haven’t always been given their due, and they have never been considered for a Rock Hall induction.\n\n24. The Spinners\n\nGenre: R&B/Soul\n\nMembers: G.C. Cameron, John Edwards, Henry Fambrough, Billy Henderson†, Pervis Jackson†, Bobby Smith†, Phillipe Wynne†\n\nKey Recordings: “It’s A Shame” (1970), Spinners (1973), New And Improved (1974), Pick Of The Litter (1975), “The Rubberband Man” (1976), “Workin My Way Back To You/Forgive Me, Girl” (1979), “Cupid” (1980)\n\nEligible Since: 1986\n\nPreviously Nominated: 2012, 2015, 2016\n\nActive since the late fifties, The Spinners have long been a mainstay of R&B, continuing under sole surviving original member Henry Fambrough. Starting out as B-listers on Motown, the group broke through in 1970 with It’s A Shame (co-written and produced by 1989 inductee Stevie Wonder) before moving to Atlantic in 1972. Under songwriter and producer’s Thom Bell, the group would deliver a string of classic hits such as “I’ll Be Around”, “One Of A Kind Love Affair”, “The Rubberband Man”, and “Games People Play”. To date they have influenced or have been covered or sampled by Eric Clapton, The Supremes, David Bowie, Elton John, The Four Tops, Public Enemy, James Taylor, Elvis Costello, Grandmaster Flash & the Furious Five, Dionne Warwick, Rakim of Eric B. & Rakim, Todd Rundgren, LL Cool J, Doobie Brothers, Hall & Oates, 2Pac, Charles Mingus, Boyz II Men, Jay-Z, Lionel Richie, Bobby Brown, John Hiatt, R. Kelly, Atlantic Starr, Phyllis Hyman, Afghan Whigs, Regina Belle, William Bell, Earl Klugh, Ween, DMX, D’Angelo, Youssou N’Dour, Otis Clay, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Bone Thugs-N-Harmony, Lisa Stansfield, Ray Parker, Jr., Phil Perry, Debarge, CeCe Peniston, Freddie Jackson, Will Downing, Lupe Fiasco, Joan Osborne, and The Family.\n\nHowever, despite a solid resume and three nominations, The Spinners remain on the outside looking in, with only one original member and two other “classic era” members left.\n\n23. Carole King*\n\nGenre: Singer-Songwriter, Pop\n\nKey Recordings: Tapestry (1971), “Jazzman” (1974), “Nightingale” (1975)\n\nEligible Since: 1986\n\nPreviously Nominated: 1989\n\nStarting out as one half of a successful songwriting team with ex-husband Gerry Goffin, Carole King went on to have success as a performer, and with her 1971 album Tapestry, she would kickstart the seventies singer-songwriter movement. Without her, people like Randy Newman, James Taylor, and Carly Simon wouldn’t have the success they had. With only one nomination in the Hall’s history, Carole has never been inducted in the Performers category (she was inducted into the Non-Performers Category with Goffin in 1990).\n\n22. Soundgarden\n\nGenre: Grunge, Alternative Metal\n\nMembers: Matt Cameron*, Chris Cornell†, Ben Sheperd, Kim Thayil, Hiro Yamamoto\n\nKey Recordings: Louder Than Love (1989), BadMotorFinger (1991), Superunkown (1994)\n\nEligible Since: 2012\n\nPreviously Nominated: 2020\n\nOne of the major names in the Seattle grunge scene, Soundgarden served as the link between grunge and stoner metal, helping pioneer Alternative Metal as well as being the first grunge band to sign to a major label. In addition, Chris Cornell remains a highly regarded vocalist of his era both in life and since his tragic death in 2017.\n\nDespite the commercial success and accolades, as well as a Chris Cornell tribute in 2018, they have never been inducted or even nominated until this past year.\n\n21. Black Flag\n\nGenre: Hardcore Punk, Sludge Metal\n\nMembers: Dez Cadana, Chuck Dukowski, Greg Ginn, Kira Roessler, Henry Rollins, Bill Stevenson, Julio “Robo” Valencia\n\nKey Recordings: Damaged (1981), My War (1984), In My Head (1985)\n\nEligible Since: 2004\n\nPreviously Nominated: Never nominated\n\nThrough various lineup changes in their ten year existence, Black Flag became legends of the underground, pioneering hardcore punk and the DIY aesthetic as well as laying the groundwork for sludge metal and grunge with the second side of My War and In My Head. In addition, guitarist and leader Greg Ginn is responsible for one of the indie scene’s most iconic labels in SST and vocalist Henry Rollins has become a punk icon in his own right.\n\n20. The New York Dolls\n\nGenre: Proto-Punk, Glam Rock, Rock and Roll\n\nMembers: David Johansson, Arthur “Killer” Kane†, Jerry Nolan†, Sylvain Sylvain, Johnny Thunders†\n\nKey Recordings: The New York Dolls (1973), Too Much Too Soon (1974)\n\nEligible Since: 1998\n\nPreviously Nominated: 2001\n\nAlthough short lived, The New York Dolls left their mark within their brief existence. As one of the Big Three of Proto-Punk, the Dolls shed the avant garde experimentation of the Stooges and the psychedelic guitar freakouts of the MC5 to a ramshackled rock and roll, teetering on the edge at all times. Underneath that chaos however, they showed themselves to be talented craftsmen, and this combination led to their two studio albums that are both heralded as classics, in particular the first. They’ve gone on to influenced the original punks like Ramones, The Sex Pistols, and Richard Hell, 70s hard rockers Aerosmith and KISS, and glam metal artists like Mötley Crüe and Twisted Sister.\n\nEligible since 1998, the group has been nominated once, and as of this writing only has two members left living.\n\n19. Slayer\n\nGenre: Thrash Metal\n\nMembers: Tom Araya, Jeff Hanneman†, Kerry King, Dave Lombardo\n\nKey Recordings: Show No Mercy (1983), Hell Awaits (1985), Reign In Blood (1986), South of Heaven (1988), Seasons in the Abyss (1990)\n\nEligible Since: 2009\n\nPreviously Nominated: Never nominated\n\nWith their violent and demented lyrics and chaotic sonic assault, Slayer ushered in a new era for metal, serving as one of the pioneering bands in thrash as well as planting the seeds for death metal, casting a shadow over all extreme metal in general. Reign In Blood in particular serves as a benchmark in heavy metal to this day, serving as a bludgeoning on the senses in contrast to the slick MTV oriented rock of the day. Drummer Dave Lombardo in particular pioneered the extreme metal style of double bass drumming, while Kerry King provided one of metal’s earliest crossovers with his guest appearance on The Beastie Boys’ “No Sleep Til Brooklyn”.\n\nDespite having a longevity and impact rivaling Metallica, Slayer is still waiting to be nominated even with the 2011 death of Jeff Hanneman and their Farewell Tour.\n\n18. MC5\n\nGenre: Proto-Punk, Garage Rock\n\nMembers: Michael Davis†, Wayne Kramer, Fred “Sonic” Smith†, Dennis Thompson, Rob Tyner†\n\nKey Recordings: Kick Out The Jams (1969), Back In The USA (1970), High Time (1971)\n\nEligible Since: 1994\n\nPreviously Nominated: 2003, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020\n\n“KICK OUT THE JAMS, MOTHAFUCKER!” With this command, the MC5 kicked off not only their iconic debut album but a revolution. With their punishing hard rock and politically charged lyrics, the MC5 planted the seeds for punk rock as well as certain strains of hard rock. Musically and lyrically uncompromising for their time, the MC5 proved to be a radical depature from the norm.\n\nTo date, the MC5 have been nominated five times and remain waiting, with only two of its members still alive.\n\n17. Eric B. & Rakim\n\nGenre: Hip Hop\n\nMembers: Eric “Eric B.” Barrier, William “Rakim” Griffin Jr.\n\nKey Recordings: Paid In Full (1987), Follow The Leader (1988)\n\nEligible Since: 2012\n\nPreviously Nominated: 2012\n\nArguably the premier duo in hip hop, Eric B. & Rakim raised the bar in hip hop. Rakim’s internal rhymes increased the lyrical complexity of the genre, while Eric B.’s turntable work emphasized the art of sampling and crafted a dense, urban sound that proved equally important to the genre.\n\nEric B. & Rakim never had the mainstream success of their peers and currently possess just one nomination to date.\n\n16. Iron Maiden\n\nGenre: Heavy Metal\n\nMembers: Clive Burr†, Paul Di’Anno, Bruce Dickinson, Janick Gers, Steve Harris, Nicko McBrain, Dave Murray, Adrian Smith\n\nKey Recordings: Iron Maiden (1980), Killers (1981), Number Of The Beast (1982), Piece Of Mind (1983), Powerslave (1984), Live After Death (1985), Somewhere In Time (1986), Seventh Son Of A Seventh Son (1988)\n\nEligible Since: 2005\n\nPreviously Nominated: Never nominated\n\nStarting their careers at the forefront of the New Wave Of Heavy Metal, Iron Maiden have been one of the world’s biggest and most iconic metal bands, influencing the sound and presentation of heavy metal since their debut album in 1980. Frontman Bruce Dickinson proved to have a lasting impact on subsequent metal singers, as did bassist/leader Steve Harris and guitarists Dave Murray and Adrian Smith on their respective fields. In addition, the band’s mascot Eddie would leave a tremendous impact on metal’s visual aspects, including album art and spawning many subsequent metal mascots.\n\n15. The Monkees\n\nGenre: Pop, Rock\n\nMembers: Mickey Dolenz, Davy Jones†, Michael Nesmith, Peter Tork†\n\nKey Recordings: The Monkees (1966), “(I’m Not Your) Steppin Stone” (1967), Headquarters (1967), Pisces, Aquarius, Capricorn & Jones Ltd. (1967), “Daydream Believer” (1967), Good Times! (2016)\n\nEligible Since: 1992\n\nPreviously Nominated: Never nominated\n\nArising out of their hit television series from the sixties, The Monkees took America’s youth by storm, transcending into pop stardom. While initially under the eye of producer Don Kirshner, the Monkees eventually developed into a self contained and fairly accomplished band themselves. In addition to having a wide mark on the relationship between music and visual mediums, the group has also left a mark on many subsequent punk and indie groups, with quite a few contributing to the group’s reunion album Good Times!, which ended up being a critical and commercial success.\n\nDue to their origins, The Monkees have had a sometimes contentious relationship with critics, which has likely impacted their ability to be nominated even with the deaths of Davy Jones and Peter Tork.\n\n14. Ice-T\n\nGenre: Hip Hop, Gangsta Rap\n\nKey Recordings: “Six In The Mornin” (1986), Power (1988), The Iceberg/Freedom of Speech… Just Watch What You Say! (1989), O.G. Original Gangster (1991)\n\nEligible Since: 2008\n\nPreviously Nominated: Never nominated\n\nWith his 1986 single Six In The Mornin’, Ice T ushered in the West Coast gangsta rap that would shape the common rapper’s image for years if not decades to come. With a gritty minimalist sound and a cool charisma, Ice brought the darker side of South Central LA to a wider audience through records like Power and O.G. Original Gangster. Ice T would later cross over to rock audiences through his band Body Count, which generated national controversy and publicity due to the song “Cop Killer”.\n\nBetter known nowadays for his role in Law And Order: SVU, Ice T’s legacy is firm and intact, and hip hop would be widely different without him.\n\n13. Motörhead\n\nGenre: Heavy Metal, Speed Metal\n\nMembers: Brian “Würzel” Burston†, Phil Campbell, “Fast Eddie” Clarke†, Mickey Dee, Lemmy Kilmister†, Phil “Philthy Animal” Taylor†\n\nKey Recordings: Overkill (1979), Bomber (1979), Ace Of Spades (1980), No Sleep Til Hammersmith (1981), Iron Fist (1982), Orgasmatron (1986)\n\nEligible Since: 2003\n\nPreviously Nominated: 2020\n\nAhhhh, Motörhead. Led by God himself, Mr. Lemmy Kilmister, the trio (quartet during Würzel’s tenure) reinventing heavy metal with their punk attitude and aggression, planting the seeds for speed metal and virtually all extreme metal in the process. With Lemmy’s unorthodox rhythm guitar-style bass and songwriting, the group remained a mainstay in metal throughout several lineup changes until Lemmy’s death in late 2015 upon which the group disbanded.\n\nTo date, the entire classic lineup has passed on, as has guitarist Würzel.\n\n12. Big Star\n\nGenre: Power Pop, Alternative Rock\n\nMembers: Chris Bell†, Alex Chilton†, Andy Hummell†, Jody Stephens\n\nKey Recordings: #1 Record (1972), Radio City (1974)\n\nEligible Since: 1997\n\nPreviously Nominated: Never nominated\n\nBefore R.E.M., before The Replacements, there was Big Star. With Alex Chilton’s raucous take on pop and Chris Bell’s ear for craftsmanship, Big Star were power pop pioneers. In the process, they paved the way for the modern alternative rock boom, and would be namechecked by some of the biggest acts of all time (most notably in The Mats’ “Alex Chilton”).\n\nHowever, they have yet to be nominated, and as of this typing, only drummer Jody Stephens remains.\n\n11. Gram Parsons†\n\nGenre: Country Rock, Americana, Singer-Songwriter\n\nKey Recordings: GP (1973), Grevious Angels (1974)\n\nEligible Since: 1998\n\nPreviously Nominated: 2002, 2004, 2005\n\nThe godfather of Country Rock, Gram Parsons left a wide mark through his relatively brief career, be it through groups like The Byrds, The International Submarine Band, and The Flying Burrito Brothers, or his two solo albums that have grown in stature since his death. With his mixture of Americana, rhythm and blues, and rock and roll, Gram Parsons brought forward a new sound that combined the old with the new, and subsequently inspiring the Rolling Stones during their classic run, The Byrds, the Eagles, the California Sound of the seventies, as well as basically pioneering alternative country.\n\nAs of 2019, Gram Parsons has been nominated three times and despite his significance in the group’s history, he was not included with the Byrds in 1991.\n\n10. Tina Turner*\n\nGenre: R&B/Soul, Pop, Rock\n\nKey Recordings: “Acid Queen” (1975), Private Dancer (1984), “We Don’t Need Another Hero” (1985), “The Best” (1986), “I Don’t Wanna Fight” (1993)\n\nEligible Since: 1998\n\nPreviously Nominated: Never nominated\n\nThe Queen Of Rock n Roll herself, Tina won audiences over with her gritty, passionate vocals and her dynamic showmanship. After splitting from abusive ex-husband Ike, she would slowly rebuild her career into a hugely successful and iconic solo artist. On top of this, she’s become a quintessential second act in popular music as well as a symbol of hope for abuse survivors.\n\nDespite all she’s achieved, Tina is currently only in for her career with Ike, having never been nominated for her solo career.\n\n9. LL Cool J\n\nGenre: Hip Hop\n\nKey Recordings: Radio (1985), Bigger And Deffer (1987), Mama Said Knock You Out (1990)\n\nEligible Since: 2010\n\nPreviously Nominated: 2010, 2011, 2014, 2018, 2019\n\nAlthough better known nowadays for his role in CSI and as host of The Grammys, LL Cool J’s musical legacy remains intact. As the first breakout solo artist in hip hop, LL Cool J paved the way for many future stars in hip hop, to the point that rappers are now solo acts by default. In addition, LL also helped make hip hop more palatable for crossover appeal, setting it stone the genre’s eventual popularity and reach over music as a whole.\n\nIn spite of all he’s done, LL Cool J has been nominated five times to date and is still awaiting his dues.\n\n8. Nick Drake\n\nGenre: Singer-Songwriter, Folk Rock\n\nKey Recordings: Five Leaves Left (1969), Bryter Layter (1970), Pink Moon (1972)\n\nEligible Since: 1994\n\nPreviously Nominated: Never nominated\n\nObscure during his lifetime, Nick Drake’s status has grown substantially in the decades since his death in 1974. With his hushed vocals and intricate acoustic guitar, Nick Drake would lay the template for several indie and folk artists to come, in addition to winning the admiration of artists like Richard Thompson and Elton John. Pink Moon in particular remains in high esteem all these years later for it’s stark songwriting.\n\n7. Joy Division/New Order\n\nGenre: Post-Punk, New Wave, Synthpop\n\nMembers: Ian Curtis†, Gillian Gilbert, Peter Hook, Stephen Morris, Bernard Sumner\n\nKey Recordings: Unknown Pleasure (1979; Joy Division), Closer (1980; Joy Divsion), “Love Will Tear Us Apart” (1980; Joy Division), “Ceremony” (1981; New Order), “Temptation” (1982), Power, Corruption, & Lies (1983; New Order), “Blue Monday” (1983), Low-Life (1985; New Order), “Bizarre Love Triangle” (1986; New Order), “True Faith” (1987; New Order), Technique (1989)\n\nEligible Since: 2004 (Joy Division), 2006 (New Order)\n\nPreviously Nominated: Never nominated\n\nThe first double feature on this list, we go from arguably post-punk’s most seminal group along with it’s sequel, a significant group in it’s own right.\n\nOne of many groups inspired by The Sex Pistols, Joy Division started as a standard punk band before meeting producer Martin Hammett, upon which they transformed into a dark, Gothic outfit built around Ian Curtis’ melancholic lyrics and baritone, with Bernard Sumner’s abstract guitar work and Peter Hook’s melodic basslines complimenting his words. Upon Curtis’ death in 1980, the surviving members reformed as New Order, adding Stephen Morris’ girlfriend Gillian Gilbert on guitars and keyboards. The group would gradually draw more from electronic music in its sound. To this day, both groups continue to leave an immeasurable impact on modern alternative and indie music.\n\n6. Can\n\nGenre: Krautrock, Experimental Rock\n\nMembers: Holger Czukay†, Michael Karoli†, Jaki Liebezeit†, Malcolm Mooney, Irmin Schmidt, Damo Suzuki\n\nKey Recordings: Monster Movie (1969), Tago Mago (1971), Ego Bamyasi (1972), Future Days (1973), Soon Over Babaluma (1974)\n\nEligible Since: 1994\n\nPreviously Nominated: Never nominated\n\nWhile never having commercial success in the US and only moderately more in their home country of Germany, no discussion of music in the past fifty years is complete without these guys. In addition to being the premier band of Germany’s Krautrock scene that fused psychedelia, prog, and electronica, the group’s improvisational and free form music would have an immense impact on much post-punk, New Wave, and indie music to follow. In addition, the group made some of the earliest use of electronic elements in rock music, between their unconventional for the time use of drum machines and their pioneering use of sampling in their music. Not only that, but foreshadowing the jittery fusion of punk aggression and funk grooves by acts such as The Minutemen, Gang Of Four, and of course Red Hot Chili Peppers. To this day, their early output continues to inspire and excite those who have heard and embraced it.\n\n5. Captain Beefheart & The Magic Band\n\nGenre: Avant-Garde, Experimental Rock, Blues Rock\n\nMembers: Mark “Rockette Morton” Boston, Jeff “Antannae Jimmy Semens” Cotton, Eric Feldman, Bruce Fowler, John “Drumbo” French, Bill “Zoot Horn Rollo” Hackleford, Victor “The Mascara Snake” Hayden†, Morris Tepper, Art “Ed Marimba” Tripp, Don “Captain Beefheart” Van Vliet†, Robert Williams\n\nKey Recordings: Safe As Milk (1967), Trout Mask Replica (1969), Lick My Decals Off, Baby (1970), Doc At the Radar Station (1980)\n\nEligible Since: 1992\n\nPreviously Nominated: Never nominated\n\nWhile never having the (moderate) commercial success of best frenemy Frank Zappa, the good Captain and his crew gained a cult following with their idiosyncratic rhythms, surrealist wordplay, and boundary pushing mix of Delta blues, free jazz, avant garde, and spoken word. Sloppy and chaotic at first glance, the Magic Band’s sound was actually quite disciplined in reality, the members accomplished enough to accustom their leader’s unorthodox ideas. What little Beefheart had in sales he more than made up for impact, inspiring the likes of John Lydon from the Sex Pistols and PiL, Blondie, Henry Cow, Kurt Cobain, Tom Waits, etc. Beyond that, members Zoot Horn Rollo and Antannae Jimmy Semens’ guitar work, wirey and angular, foreshadow alternative-styled guitar playing that would take off in subsequent decades of rock, and drummers/percussionists Drumbo and Ed Marimba’s unorthodox and polyrhythmic drumming continuing to throw a curveball in rock percussion. And while many artists get taken for granted, the good Captain continues to challenge and inspire fascination and passionate debate even fifty years since the release of his most celebrated work.\n\n4. Judas Priest\n\nGenre: Heavy Metal\n\nMembers: Les Binks, K.K. Downing, Rob Halford, Ian Hill, Dave Holland†, Glenn Tipton, Scott Travis\n\nKey Recordings: Sad Wings Of Destiny (1976), Stained Class (1978), Hell Bent For Leather (1979), Unleashed In The East (1979), British Steel (1980), Screaming For Vengeance (1982), Defenders Of The Faith (1984), Painkiller (1990)\n\nEligible Since: 2000\n\nPreviously Nominated: 2018, 2020\n\nThe Metal Gods themselves, Judas fucking Priest. While Black Sabbath created heavy metal, it was Judas Priest that codified and defined it’s identity as we know it today. From the leather and chains look to the the operatic vocals and stage presence of Rob Halford, the dual guitars of K.K. Downing and Glenn Tipton, metal is what it is because of Priest. And despite all the obstacles over the years (changing tastes, standing accused of contributing to the suicide of two teens, changing tastes), Priest remain highly respected, with their last studio garnering great praise from fans and critics.\n\nWith two nominations, Priest remain waiting, with one member dead and another incapacitated by Parkinson’s Disease.\n\n3. King Crimson\n\nGenre: Progressive Rock, Experimental Rock, Art Rock\n\nMembers: Adrian Belew, Bill Bruford*, Mel Collins, David Cross, Robert Fripp, Michael Giles, Greg Lake†, Tony Levin, Ian MacDonald, Peter Sinfield, John Wetton†\n\nKey Recordings: In The Court Of The Crimson King (1969), In The Wake Of Poseidon (1970), Larks’ Tongues In Aspic (1973), Red (1974), Discipline (1981)\n\nElgible Since: 1995\n\nPreviously Nominated: Never nominated\n\nWhile there were precursors to progressive rock like Procol Harum, The Moody Blues, and The Mothers Of Invention, it was King Crimson that spearheaded the progressive rock genre. With their debut album In The Court Of The Crimson King, King Crimson bursted out with epic length songs, free form improvisation, and constant search for new sounds, continually reinventing itself with each new album, even having a new lineup on almost every record. In addition, the band has launched many accomplished musicians such as Mel Collins, Ian MacDonald, Adrian Belew, Greg Lake, and Tony Levin.\n\nTo date, King Crimson continues touring to a fair amount of success, while waiting for induction. Unfortunately, bassists Greg Lake and Jon Wetton will not be there, having passed on in 2016 and 2017. However, Bill Bruford, upon King Crimson’s induction, would be the second drummer to recieve a second induction, having been inducted with Yes in 2017.\n\n2. Dick Dale†\n\nGenre: Surf Rock, Instrumental Rock\n\nKey Recordings: “Let’s Go Trippin” (1961), “Misirlou” (1962), Surfer’s Choice (1962)\n\nEligible Since: 1988\n\nPreviously Nominated: Never nominated\n\nThe King Of Surf Guitar, Dick Dale captured the spirit and energy of early sixties California with his rippling guitar virtuosity and high energy stage performances. Drawing from Middle Eastern scales, Dale pioneered the surf style of guitar playing that was a precursor to heavy metal. In addition, Dale also aided Fender in the development of guitar gear such as the first 100 watt guitar amplifier.\n\nWhile having inductions into The Musicicans Hall Of Fame in 2009 and The Surfing Walk Of Fame in 2013, Dick Dale continues to wait for his Rock Hall induction, even after his death in 2019.\n\nAnd now the #1 Rock Hall Snub is……….\n\n1. Kraftwerk\n\nGenre: Electronica, Synth Pop, Krautrock\n\nMembers: Karl Bartos, Wolfgang Flür, Ralf Hüffer, Florian Schneider\n\nKey Recordings: Autobahn (1974), Radio-Activity (1975), Trans Europe Express (1977), The Man Machine (1978), Computer World (1981)\n\nEligible Since: 1996\n\nPreviously Nominated: 2003, 2013, 2015, 2017, 2019, 2020\n\nVery few groups can truthfully say they changed music forever. Krafterk is one of those proud few. Starting out in Germany’s Krautrock scene, Kraftwerk soon developed into a premiere electronic act, delivering a string of groundbreaking records in the seventies and early eighties that reshaped how many people perceived music, their work with synthesizers and electronics affecting virtually every style of popular music, helping influence the development of post-punk, hip hop, techno, synthpop, ambient, and house. Oh and they were robots WAY before Daft Punk. It cannot be overstated just how different almost all music, rock included, would be without these guys.\n\nIn addition, I will mentioned snubs in other categories:\n\nEarly Influences:\n\nBig Mama Thorton\n\nThe Carter Family (Anita Carter†, A.P. Carter†, Helen Carter†, Janette Carter†, Joe Carter†, Maybelle Carter†, Sara Carter†, June Carter Cash†)\n\nDjango Reinhardt†\n\nCab Calloway†\n\nJohn Cage†\n\nNon-Performers:\n\nCasey Kasem†\n\nDr. Robert Moog†\n\nLee “Scratch” Perry\n\nJohn Peel†\n\nBarrett Strong and Norman Whitfield†\n\nAward For Musical Excellence:\n\nTodd Rundgren\n\nBilly Preston†\n\nNicky Hopkins†\n\nThe Jordanaires (Hoyt Hawkins†, Hugh Jarrett†, Neal Matthews Jr.†, Gordon Stoker†, Ray Walker)\n\nRandy Rhoads†\n\nAnd that is The Top 25 Rock Hall Snubs! Be sure to comment, subscribe, and spread the word.\n\nMy post on the 2019 Rock Hall Class went well and got some good feedback, so, inspired by writer Tom Lane’s list, I will now attempt my own. In addition, I’ll also make suggestions for other categories. So here we go…\n\nBefore we enter, I’ll reveal how I decided on which artists to include, as well as what certain marks mean.\n\nI judged each artist by innovation, influence, critical success, and commercial success.\n\nI also factored in seniority and how long each act has had to wait.\n\nA dagger or cross indicates the person in question is deceased, while an asterisk indicates the person has received a prior induction.\n\nAnd of course, I am well aware that there are quite a few worthy picks missing from the list. Trust me, I will punch myself for not including certain acts.\n\n25. The Spinners\n\nGenre: R&B/Soul\n\nMembers: G.C. Cameron, John Edwards, Henry Fambrough, Billy Henderson†, Pervis Jackson†, Bobby Smith†, Phillipe Wynne†\n\nKey Recordings: “It’s A Shame” (1970), Spinners (1973), New And Improved (1974), Pick Of The Litter (1975), “The Rubberband Man” (1976), “Workin My Way Back To You/Forgive Me, Girl” (1979), “Cupid” (1980)\n\nEligible Since: 1986\n\nPreviously Nominated: 2012, 2015, 2016\n\nActive since the late fifties, The Spinners have long been a mainstay of R&B, continuing under sole surviving original member Henry Fambrough. Starting out as B-listers on Motown, the group broke through in 1970 with It’s A Shame (co-written and produced by 1989 inductee Stevie Wonder) before moving to Atlantic in 1972. Under songwriter and producer’s Thom Bell, the group would deliver a string of classic hits such as “I’ll Be Around”, “One Of A Kind Love Affair”, “The Rubberband Man”, and “Games People Play”. To date they have influenced or have been covered or sampled by Eric Clapton, The Supremes, David Bowie, Elton John, The Four Tops, Public Enemy, James Taylor, Elvis Costello, Grandmaster Flash & the Furious Five, Dionne Warwick, Rakim of Eric B. & Rakim, Todd Rundgren, LL Cool J, Doobie Brothers, Hall & Oates, 2Pac, Charles Mingus, Boyz II Men, Jay-Z, Lionel Richie, Bobby Brown, John Hiatt, R. Kelly, Atlantic Starr, Phyllis Hyman, Afghan Whigs, Regina Belle, William Bell, Earl Klugh, Ween, DMX, D’Angelo, Youssou N’Dour, Otis Clay, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Bone Thugs-N-Harmony, Lisa Stansfield, Ray Parker, Jr., Phil Perry, Debarge, CeCe Peniston, Freddie Jackson, Will Downing, Lupe Fiasco, Joan Osborne, and The Family.\n\nHowever, despite a solid resume and three nominations, The Spinners remain on the outside looking in, with only one original member and two other “classic era” members left.\n\n24. Carole King*\n\nGenre: Singer-Songwriter, Pop\n\nKey Recordings: Tapestry (1971), “Jazzman” (1974), “Nightingale” (1975)\n\nEligible Since: 1986\n\nPreviously Nominated: 1989\n\nStarting out as one half of a successful songwriting team with ex-husband Gerry Goffin, Carole King went on to have success as a performer, and with her 1971 album Tapestry, she would kickstart the seventies singer-songwriter movement. Without her, people like Randy Newman, James Taylor, and Carly Simon wouldn’t have the success they had. With only one nomination in the Hall’s history, Carole has never been inducted in the Performers category (she was inducted into the Non-Performers Category with Goffin in 1990).\n\n23. Soundgarden\n\nGenre: Grunge, Alternative Metal\n\nMembers: Matt Cameron*, Chris Cornell†, Ben Sheperd, Kim Thayil, Hiro Yamamoto\n\nKey Recordings: Louder Than Love (1989), BadMotorFinger (1991), Superunkown (1994)\n\nEligible Since: 2012\n\nPreviously Nominated: Never nominated\n\nOne of the major names in the Seattle grunge scene, Soundgarden served as the link between grunge and stoner metal, helping pioneer Alternative Metal as well as being the first grunge band to sign to a major label. In addition, Chris Cornell remains a highly regarded vocalist of his era both in life and since his tragic death in 2017. Despite the commercial success and accolades, as well as a Chris Cornell tribute in 2018, they have never been inducted or even nominated.\n\n22. Faith No More\n\nGenre: Alternative Metal, Funk Metal, Alternative Rock, Experimental Rock\n\nMembers: Mike Bordin, Roddy Bottum, Billy Gould, Jim Martin, Chuck Moseley†, Mike Patton\n\nKey Recordings: Introduce Yourself (1987), The Real Thing (1989), Angel Dust (1992)\n\nEligible Since: 2011\n\nPreviously Nominated: Never nominated\n\nBest known among mainstream fans for their 1989 hit “Epic”, Faith No More have been trailblazers in Modern Rock throughout their career, bending heavy metal to include funk, hip hop, progressive rock, jazz, post-punk, and whatever they feel like at the moment. Their studio albums The Real Thing and Angel Dustserve as benchmarks among left-of-center groups through the modern era. However, FNM haven’t always been given their due, and they have never been considered for a Rock Hall induction.\n\n21. Black Flag\n\nGenre: Hardcore Punk, Sludge Metal\n\nMembers: Dez Cadana, Chuck Dukowski, Greg Ginn, Kira Roessler, Henry Rollins, Bill Stevenson, Julio “Robo” Valencia\n\nKey Recordings: Damaged (1981), My War (1984), In My Head (1985)\n\nEligible Since: 2004\n\nPreviously Nominated: Never nominated\n\nThrough various lineup changes in their ten year existence, Black Flag became legends of the underground, pioneering hardcore punk and the DIY aesthetic as well as laying the groundwork for sludge metal and grunge with the second side of My War and In My Head. In addition, guitarist and leader Greg Ginn is responsible for one of the indie scene’s most iconic labels in SST and vocalist Henry Rollins has become a punk icon in his own right.\n\n20. The New York Dolls\n\nGenre: Proto-Punk, Glam Rock, Rock and Roll\n\nMembers: David Johansson, Arthur “Killer” Kane†, Jerry Nolan†, Sylvain Sylvain, Johnny Thunders†\n\nKey Recordings: The New York Dolls (1973), Too Much Too Soon (1974)\n\nEligible Since: 1998\n\nPreviously Nominated: 2001\n\nAlthough short lived, The New York Dolls left their mark within their brief existence. As one of the Big Three of Proto-Punk, the Dolls shed the avant garde experimentation of the Stooges and the psychedelic guitar freakouts of the MC5 to a ramshackled rock and roll, teetering on the edge at all times. Underneath that chaos however, they showed themselves to be talented craftsmen, and this combination led to their two studio albums that are both heralded as classics, in particular the first. They’ve gone on to influenced the original punks like Ramones, The Sex Pistols, and Richard Hell, 70s hard rockers Aerosmith and KISS, and glam metal artists like Mötley Crüe and Twisted Sister.\n\nEligible since 1998, the group has been nominated once, and as of this writing only has two members left living.\n\n19. Slayer\n\nGenre: Thrash Metal\n\nMembers: Tom Araya, Jeff Hanneman†, Kerry King, Dave Lombardo\n\nKey Recordings: Show No Mercy (1983), Hell Awaits (1985), Reign In Blood (1986), South of Heaven (1988), Seasons in the Abyss (1990)\n\nEligible Since: 2009\n\nPreviously Nominated: Never nominated\n\nWith their violent and demented lyrics and chaotic sonic assault, Slayer ushered in a new era for metal, serving as one of the pioneering bands in thrash as well as planting the seeds for death metal, casting a shadow over all extreme metal in general. Reign In Blood in particular serves as a benchmark in heavy metal to this day, serving as a bludgeoning on the senses in contrast to the slick MTV oriented rock of the day. Drummer Dave Lombardo in particular pioneered the extreme metal style of double bass drumming, while Kerry King provided one of metal’s earliest crossovers with his guest appearance on The Beastie Boys’ No Sleep Til Brooklyn.\n\nDespite having a longevity and impact rivaling Metallica, Slayer is still waiting to be nominated even with the 2011 death of Jeff Hanneman and the current Farewell Tour.\n\n18. Whitney Houston†\n\nGenre: R&B/Soul, Pop\n\nKey Recordings: Whitney Houston (1985), Whitney (1987), The Bodyguard: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack (1992)\n\nEligible Since: 2010\n\nPreviously Nominated: Never nominated\n\nOne of the biggest pop stars of her generation, Whitney Houston helped break down racial barriers in pop music, paving the way for artists like Janet Jackson, Anita Baker, and later generations like Beyoncé, Alayah, and Mary J. Blige. With a dynamic voice, Whitney conquered virtually any song or style she ever tackled, in addition to crossing over into movies in the nineties. While her turbulent personal life sometimes overshadowed her music, she nonetheless stands among the giants of her generation, her legacy and impact remaining as strong as ever.\n\nHowever, she has never been considered for the Hall, even after her death in 2012.\n\n17. MC5\n\nGenre: Proto-Punk, Garage Rock\n\nMembers: Michael Davis†, Wayne Kramer, Fred “Sonic” Smith†, Dennis Thompson, Rob Tyner†\n\nKey Recordings: Kick Out The Jams (1969), Back In The USA (1970), High Time (1971)\n\nEligible Since: 1994\n\nPreviously Nominated: 2003, 2017, 2018, 2019\n\n“KICK OUT THE JAMS, MOTHAFUCKER!” With this command, the MC5 kicked off not only their iconic debut album but a revolution. With their punishing hard rock and politically charged lyrics, the MC5 planted the seeds for punk rock as well as certain strains of hard rock. Musically and lyrically uncompromising for their time, the MC5 proved to be a radical depature from the norm.\n\nTo date, the MC5 have been nominated four times and remain waiting, with only two of its members still alive.\n\n16. Eric B. & Rakim\n\nGenre: Hip Hop\n\nMembers: Eric “Eric B.” Barrier, William “Rakim” Griffin Jr.\n\nKey Recordings: Paid In Full (1987), Follow The Leader (1988)\n\nEligible Since: 2012\n\nPreviously Nominated: 2012\n\nArguably the premier duo in hip hop, Eric B. & Rakim raised the bar in hip hop. Rakim’s internal rhymes increased the lyrical complexity of the genre, while Eric B.’s turntable work emphasized the art of sampling and crafted a dense, urban sound that proved equally important to the genre.\n\nEric B. & Rakim never had the mainstream success of their peers and currently possess just one nomination to date.\n\n15. Iron Maiden\n\nGenre: Heavy Metal\n\nMembers: Clive Burr†, Paul Di’Anno, Bruce Dickinson, Janick Gers, Steve Harris, Nicko McBrain, Dave Murray, Adrian Smith\n\nKey Recordings: Iron Maiden (1980), Killers (1981), Number Of The Beast (1982), Piece Of Mind (1983), Powerslave (1984), Live After Death (1985), Somewhere In Time (1986), Seventh Son Of A Seventh Son (1988)\n\nEligible Since: 2005\n\nPreviously Nominated: Never nominated\n\nStarting their careers at the forefront of the New Wave Of Heavy Metal, Iron Maiden have been one of the world’s biggest and most iconic metal bands, influencing the sound and presentation of heavy metal since their debut album in 1980. Frontman Bruce Dickinson proved to have a lasting impact on subsequent metal singers, as did bassist/leader Steve Harris and guitarists Dave Murray and Adrian Smith on their respective fields. In addition, the band’s mascot Eddie would leave a tremendous impact on metal’s visual aspects, including album art and spawning many subsequent metal mascots.\n\n14. The Monkees\n\nGenre: Pop, Rock\n\nMembers: Mickey Dolenz, Davy Jones†, Michael Nesmith, Peter Tork\n\nKey Recordings: The Monkees (1966), “(I’m Not Your) Steppin Stone” (1967), Headquarters (1967), Pisces, Aquarius, Capricorn & Jones Ltd. (1967), “Daydream Believer” (1967), Good Times! (2016)\n\nEligible Since: 1992\n\nPreviously Nominated: Never nominated\n\nArising out of their hit television series from the sixties, The Monkees took America’s youth by storm, transcending into pop stardom. While initially under the eye of producer Don Kirshner, the Monkees eventually developed into a self contained and fairly accomplished band themselves. In addition to having a wide mark on the relationship between music and visual mediums, the group has also left a mark on many subsequent punk and indie groups, with quite a few contributing to the group’s reunion album Good Times!, which ended up being a critical and commercial success.\n\n13. Ice-T\n\nGenre: Hip Hop, Gangsta Rap\n\nKey Recordings: “Six In The Mornin” (1986), Power (1988), The Iceberg/Freedom of Speech… Just Watch What You Say! (1989), O.G. Original Gangster (1991)\n\nEligible Since: 2008\n\nPreviously Nominated: Never nominated\n\nWith his 1986 single Six In The Mornin’, Ice T ushered in the West Coast gangsta rap that would shape the common rapper’s image for years if not decades to come. With a gritty minimalist sound and a cool charisma, Ice brought the darker side of South Central LA to a wider audience through records like Power and O.G. Original Gangster. Ice T would later cross over to rock audiences through his band Body Count, which generated national controversy and publicity due to the song “Cop Killer”.\n\nBetter known nowadays for his role in Law And Order: SVU, Ice T’s legacy is firm and intact, and hip hop would be widely different without him.\n\n12.Motörhead\n\nGenre: Heavy Metal, Speed Metal\n\nMembers: Brian “Würzel” Burston†, Phil Campbell, “Fast Eddie” Clarke†, Mickey Dee, Lemmy Kilmister†, Phil “Philthy Animal” Taylor†\n\nKey Recordings: Overkill (1979), Bomber (1979), Ace Of Spades (1980), No Sleep Til Hammersmith (1981), Iron Fist (1982), Orgasmatron (1986)\n\nEligible Since: 2003\n\nPreviously Nominated: Never nominated\n\nAhhhh, Motörhead. Led by God himself, Mr. Lemmy Kilmister, the trio (quartet during Würzel’s tenure) reinventing heavy metal with their punk attitude and aggression, planting the seeds for speed metal and virtually all extreme metal in the process. With Lemmy’s unorthodox rhythm guitar-style bass and songwriting, the group remained a mainstay in metal throughout several lineup changes until Lemmy’s death in late 2015 upon which the group disbanded.\n\nTo date, the entire classic lineup has passed on, as has guitarist Würzel.\n\n11. Gram Parsons†\n\nGenre: Country Rock, Americana, Singer-Songwriter\n\nKey Recordings: GP (1973), Grevious Angels (1974)\n\nEligible Since: 1998\n\nPreviously Nominated: 2002, 2004, 2005\n\nThe godfather of Country Rock, Gram Parsons left a wide mark through his relatively brief career, be it through groups like The Byrds, The International Submarine Band, and The Flying Burrito Brothers, or his two solo albums that have grown in stature since his death. With his mixture of Americana, rhythm and blues, and rock and roll, Gram Parsons brought forward a new sound that combined the old with the new, and subsequently inspiring the Rolling Stones during their classic run, The Byrds, the Eagles, the California Sound of the seventies, as well as basically pioneering alternative country.\n\nAs of 2019, Gram Parsons has been nominated three times and despite his significance in the group’s history, he was not included with the Byrds in 1991.\n\n10. LL Cool J\n\nGenre: Hip Hop\n\nKey Recordings: Radio (1985), Bigger And Deffer (1987), Mama Said Knock You Out (1990)\n\nEligible Since: 2010\n\nPreviously Nominated: 2010, 2011, 2014, 2018, 2019\n\nAlthough better known nowadays for his role in CSI and as host of The Grammys, LL Cool J’s musical legacy remains intact. As the first breakout solo artist in hip hop, LL Cool J paved the way for many future stars in hip hop, to the point that rappers are now solo acts by default. In addition, LL also helped make hip hop more palatable for crossover appeal, setting it stone the genre’s eventual popularity and reach over music as a whole.\n\nTied for the most nominated artist on this list, LL Cool J has been nominated five times to date and is still awaiting his dues.\n\n9. T. Rex\n\nGenre: Glam Rock, Garage Rock, Psychedelic Folk\n\nMembers: Marc Bolan†, Steve Currie†, Mickey Finn†, Bill Legend, Steve Peregrin Took†\n\nKey Recordings: “Debora” (1968), “Ride A White Swan” (1970), “Hot Love” (1971), Electric Warrior (1971), The Slider (1972), “Children Of The Revolution” (1972), “20th Century Boy” (1973), Tanx (1973)\n\nEligible Since: 1993\n\nPreviously Nominated: Never nominated\n\nOne of the biggest names in British Glam Rock, T. Rex took rock by storm for a time. With catchy hooks and primal rock rhythms, the group left an indelible mark on hard rockers such as KISS, Cheap Trick, and Guns N Roses, punks like The Sex Pistols and The Damned, and alt rockers such as The Smiths, R.E.M., and Big Star. Even contemporaries such as David Bowie and The New York Dolls had a great deal of respect for them. Despite a commercial slump in the mid seventies, the group started to regain momentum shortly before frontman Marc Bolan’s death in 1977.\n\nTwenty five years later, T. Rex continues waiting with just one member from it’s heyday left living.\n\n8. Nick Drake\n\nGenre: Singer-Songwriter, Folk Rock\n\nKey Recordings: Five Leaves Left (1969), Bryter Layter (1970), Pink Moon (1972)\n\nEligible Since: 1994\n\nPreviously Nominated: Never nominated\n\nObscure during his lifetime, Nick Drake’s status has grown substantially in the decades since his death in 1974. With his hushed vocals and intricate acoustic guitar, Nick Drake would lay the template for several indie and folk artists to come, in addition to winning the admiration of artists like Richard Thompson and Elton John. Pink Moon in particular remains in high esteem all these years later for it’s stark songwriting.\n\n7. Joy Division/New Order\n\nGenre: Post-Punk, New Wave, Synthpop\n\nMembers: Ian Curtis†, Gillian Gilbert, Peter Hook, Stephen Morris, Bernard Sumner\n\nKey Recordings: Unknown Pleasure (1979; Joy Division), Closer (1980; Joy Divsion), “Love Will Tear Us Apart” (1980; Joy Division), “Ceremony” (1981; New Order), “Temptation” (1982), Power, Corruption, & Lies (1983; New Order), “Blue Monday” (1983), Low-Life (1985; New Order), “Bizarre Love Triangle” (1986; New Order), “True Faith” (1987; New Order), Technique (1989)\n\nEligible Since: 2004 (Joy Division), 2006 (New Order)\n\nPreviously Nominated: Never nominated\n\nThe first double feature on this list, we go from arguably post-punk’s most seminal group along with it’s sequel, a significant group in it’s own right.\n\nOne of many groups inspired by The Sex Pistols, Joy Division started as a standard punk band before meeting producer Martin Hammett, upon which they transformed into a dark, Gothic outfit built around Ian Curtis’ melancholic lyrics and baritone, with Bernard Sumner’s abstract guitar work and Peter Hook’s melodic basslines complimenting his words. Upon Curtis’ death in 1980, the surviving members reformed as New Order, adding Stephen Morris’ girlfriend Gillian Gilbert on guitars and keyboards. The group would gradually draw more from electronic music in its sound. To this day, both groups continue to leave an immeasurable impact on modern alternative and indie music.\n\n6. Can\n\nGenre: Krautrock, Experimental Rock\n\nMembers: Holger Czukay†, Michael Karoli†, Jaki Liebezeit†, Malcolm Mooney, Irmin Schmidt, Damo Suzuki\n\nKey Recordings: Monster Movie (1969), Tago Mago (1971), Ego Bamyasi (1972), Future Days (1973), Soon Over Babaluma (1974)\n\nEligible Since: 1994\n\nPreviously Nominated: Never nominated\n\nWhile never having commercial success in the US and only moderately more in their home country of Germany, no discussion of music in the past fifty years is complete without these guys. In addition to being the premier band of Germany’s Krautrock scene that fused psychedelia, prog, and electronica, the group’s improvisational and free form music would have an immense impact on much post-punk, New Wave, and indie music to follow. In addition, the group made some of the earliest use of electronic elements in rock music, between their unconventional for the time use of drum machines and their pioneering use of sampling in their music. Not only that, but foreshadowing the jittery fusion of punk aggression and funk grooves by acts such as The Minutemen, Gang Of Four, and of course Red Hot Chili Peppers. To this day, their early output continues to inspire and excite those who have heard and embraced it.\n\n5. Captain Beefheart & The Magic Band\n\nGenre: Avant-Garde, Experimental Rock, Blues Rock\n\nMembers: Mark “Rockette Morton” Boston, Jeff “Antannae Jimmy Semens” Cotton, Eric Feldman, Bruce Fowler, John “Drumbo” French, Bill “Zoot Horn Rollo” Hackleford, Victor “The Mascara Snake” Hayden†, Morris Tepper, Art “Ed Marimba” Tripp, Don “Captain Beefheart” Van Vliet†, Robert Williams\n\nKey Recordings: Safe As Milk (1967), Trout Mask Replica (1969), Lick My Decals Off, Baby (1970), Doc At the Radar Station (1980)\n\nEligible Since: 1992\n\nPreviously Nominated: Never nominated\n\nWhile never having the (moderate) commercial success of best frenemy Frank Zappa, the good Captain and his crew gained a cult following with their idiosyncratic rhythms, surrealist wordplay, and boundary pushing mix of Delta blues, free jazz, avant garde, and spoken word. Sloppy and chaotic at first glance, the Magic Band’s sound was actually quite disciplined in reality, the members accomplished enough to accustom their leader’s unorthodox ideas. What little Beefheart had in sales he more than made up for impact, inspiring the likes of John Lydon from the Sex Pistols and PiL, Blondie, Henry Cow, Kurt Cobain, Tom Waits, etc. Beyond that, members Zoot Horn Rollo and Antannae Jimmy Semens’ guitar work, wirey and angular, foreshadow alternative-styled guitar playing that would take off in subsequent decades of rock, and drummers/percussionists Drumbo and Ed Marimba’s unorthodox and polyrhythmic drumming continuing to throw a curveball in rock percussion. And while many artists get taken for granted, the good Captain continues to challenge and inspire fascination and passionate debate even as we approach the fiftieth anniversary of his most celebrated work.\n\n4. Judas Priest\n\nGenre: Heavy Metal\n\nMembers: Les Binks, K.K. Downing, Rob Halford, Ian Hill, Dave Holland†, Glenn Tipton, Scott Travis\n\nKey Recordings: Sad Wings Of Destiny (1976), Stained Class (1978), Hell Bent For Leather (1979), Unleashed In The East (1979), British Steel (1980), Screaming For Vengeance (1982), Defenders Of The Faith (1984), Painkiller (1990)\n\nEligible Since: 2000\n\nPreviously Nominated: 2018\n\nThe Metal Gods themselves, Judas fucking Priest. While Black Sabbath created heavy metal, it was Judas Priest that codified and defined it’s identity as we know it today. From the leather and chains look to the the operatic vocals and stage presence of Rob Halford, the dual guitars of K.K. Downing and Glenn Tipton, metal is what it is because of Priest. And despite all the obstacles over the years (changing tastes, standing accused of contributing to the suicide of two teens, changing tastes), Priest remain highly respected, with their last studio garnering great praise from fans and critics.\n\nWith one nomination, Priest remain waiting, with one member dead and another incapacitated by Parkinson’s Disease.\n\n3. King Crimson\n\nGenre: Progressive Rock, Experimental Rock, Art Rock\n\nMembers: Adrian Belew, Bill Bruford*, Mel Collins, David Cross, Robert Fripp, Michael Giles, Greg Lake†, Tony Levin, Ian MacDonald, Peter Sinfield, John Wetton†\n\nKey Recordings: In The Court Of The Crimson King (1969), In The Wake Of Poseidon (1970), Larks’ Tongues In Aspic (1973), Red (1974), Discipline (1981)\n\nElgible Since: 1995\n\nPreviously Nominated: Never nominated\n\nWhile there were precursors to progressive rock like Procol Harum, The Moody Blues, and The Mothers Of Invention, it was King Crimson that spearheaded the progressive rock genre. With their debut album In The Court Of The Crimson King, King Crimson bursted out with epic length songs, free form improvisation, and constant search for new sounds, continually reinventing itself with each new album, even having a new lineup on almost every record. In addition, the band has launched many accomplished musicians such as Mel Collins, Ian MacDonald, Adrian Belew, Greg Lake, and Tony Levin.\n\nTo date, King Crimson continues touring to a fair amount of success, while waiting for induction. Unfortunately, bassists Greg Lake and Jon Wetton will not be there, having passed on in 2016 and 2017. However, Bill Bruford, upon King Crimson’s induction, would be the second drummer to recieve a second induction, having been inducted with Yes in 2017.\n\n2. Dick Dale\n\nGenre: Surf Rock, Instrumental Rock\n\nKey Recordings: “Let’s Go Trippin” (1961), “Misirlou” (1962), Surfer’s Choice (1962)\n\nEligible Since: 1988\n\nPreviously Nominated: Never nominated\n\nThe King Of Surf Guitar, Dick Dale captured the spirit and energy of early sixties California with his rippling guitar virtuosity and high energy stage performances. Drawing from Middle Eastern scales, Dale pioneered the surf style of guitar playing that was a precursor to heavy metal. In addition, Dale also aided Fender in the development of guitar gear such as the first 100 watt guitar amplifier.\n\nAt 81 (going onto 82), Dick Dale continues to tour heavily, even through battles with cancer. While having inductions into The Musicicans Hall Of Fame in 2009 and The Surfing Walk Of Fame in 2013, Dick Dale continues to wait for his Rock Hall induction.\n\nAnd before we get to my Number One pick, here are some honorable mentions:\n\nGroups Not Included With The Leaders Such As:\n\nThe Belmonts (Angelo D’Aleo, Carlo Mastrangelo†, Fred Milano†)\n\nBig Brother & The Holding Company (Peter Albin, Sam Andrew†, Dave Getz, James Gurley†)\n\nThe Wailers (Al Anderson, Aston Barrett, Carlton Barrett†, Tyrone Downie, Marcia Griffiths, Earl Lindo†, Rita Marley, Junior Marvin, Judy Mowatt, Alvin Patterson, Peter Tosh†)\n\nThe Mothers Of Invention (Jimmy Carl Black†, Napoleon Murphy Brock, Ray Collins†, George Duke†, Roy Estrada, Bruce Fowler, Tom Fowler, Bunk Gardner, Billy Mundi†, Don Preston, Jim “Motorhead” Sherwood†, Jeff Simmons, Art Tripp, Ian Underwood, Ruth Underwood)\n\nPatti Smith Group (Jay Dee Daugherty, Lenny Kaye, Ivan Kral, Richard Sohl†)\n\nThe Silver Bullet Band (Drew Abbott, Chris Campbell, Charlie Allan Martin, Alto Reed, Robyn Robins, David Teegarden)\n\nChic (Tom Coppola, Bernard Edwards†, Luci Martin, Niles Rogers, Tony Thompson†, Norma Jean Wright)\n\nBig Star (Chris Bell†, Alex Chilton†, Andy Hummel†, Jody Stephens)\n\nDevo (Bob Casale†, Gerald Casale, Bob Mothersbaugh, Mark Mothersbaugh, Alan Myers†)\n\nProcol Harum (Gary Brooker, Chris Copping, David Knights, Keith Reid, Robin Trower, BJ Wilson†)\n\nThe Marvellettes (Katherine Anderson, Juanita Cowart, Gladys Horton†, Georgeanna Tillman†)\n\nAfrikkaa Bambaattaa\n\nA Tribe Called Quest (Kamaal “Q-Tip” Fareed, Ali Shaheed Muhammad, Malik “Phife Dawg” Taylor†, Jarobi White)\n\nWar (Thomas “Papa Dee” Allen, Harold Ray Brown, Eric Burdon*, B.B. Dickerson, Lonnie Jordan, Charles Miller†, Lee Oskar, Howard E. Scott)\n\nDonny Hathaway\n\nThe Replacements (Chris Mars, Bob Stinson†, Tommy Stinson, Paul Westerberg)\n\nDuran Duran (Warren Cuccurullo, Simon Le Bon, Nick Rhodes, Andy Taylor, John Taylor, Roger Taylor)\n\nAnd now the #1 Rock Hall Snub is……….\n\n1. Kraftwerk\n\nGenre: Electronica, Synth Pop, Krautrock\n\nMembers: Karl Bartos, Wolfgang Flür, Ralf Hüffer, Florian Schneider\n\nKey Recordings: Autobahn (1974), Radio-Activity (1975), Trans Europe Express (1977), The Man Machine (1978), Computer World (1981)\n\nEligible Since: 1996\n\nPreviously Nominated: 2003, 2013, 2015, 2017, 2019\n\nVery few groups can truthfully say they changed music forever. Krafterk is one of those proud few. Starting out in Germany’s Krautrock scene, Kraftwerk soon developed into a premiere electronic act, delivering a string of groundbreaking records in the seventies and early eighties that reshaped how many people perceived music, their work with synthesizers and electronics affecting virtually every style of popular music, helping influence the development of post-punk, hip hop, techno, synthpop, ambient, and house. Oh and they were robots WAY before Daft Punk. It cannot be overstated just how different almost all music, rock included, would be without these guys.\n\nIn addition, I will mentioned snubs in other categories:\n\nEarly Influences:\n\nBig Mama Thorton\n\nThe Carter Family (Anita Carter†, A.P. Carter†, Helen Carter†, Janette Carter†, Joe Carter†, Maybelle Carter†, Sara Carter†, June Carter Cash†)\n\nDjango Reinhardt†\n\nCab Calloway†\n\nJohn Cage†\n\nNon-Performers:\n\nCasey Kasem†\n\nDr. Robert Moog†\n\nLee “Scratch” Perry\n\nJohn Peel†\n\nBarrett Strong and Norman Whitfield†\n\nAward For Musical Excellence:\n\nTodd Rundgren\n\nBilly Preston†\n\nNicky Hopkins†\n\nThe Jordanaires (Hoyt Hawkins†, Hugh Jarrett†, Neal Matthews Jr.†, Gordon Stoker†, Ray Walker)\n\nRandy Rhoads†\n\nAnd that is The Top 25 Rock Hall Snubs!
