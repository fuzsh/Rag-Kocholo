        "text": "I think the opposite to the original poster's stance is the case:\n\nEven back in the late 80s, format radio consultants despised guitar solos, especially distorted ones, as reasons that listeners would change che channel or switch off mid-song befor the next advert came on. It did not take long until the labels began catering to this need of their prime distribution channels and neutered guitar solos or other instrumental solos in single edits, which they have been doing ever since. Only the autotune override solos of the mid-00s slipped through the cracks and got played anyway, not because they sounded less harsh which they didn't, but probably because technically, they weren't really instrumental parts but originated from vocal lines and depicted as coming from the artist's mouth in the videos.\n\nFrom this perspective, I find it weird that the 80s, the decade during which electronic synthesizers really reached another level and finally became affordable, too, are now cited as the decade when keyboards started to being despised by fans. Sure, at the end of the 80s, there was a yearning for acoustic sounds as evidenced in the Unplugged era, but that was mostly to do with people feeling oversaturated by synthesized sounds due to their sudden abundance for several years in a row. I don't think that something like Unplugged could become such a presence as a brand now, as people are much more used to synthesized sounds than back in the 80s, and there are way less music buyers / listeners now who remember what a world without electronic synthesizers sounded like.\n\nPersonally, I revel flashbacks to a world before gridding (I think it's called that), before engineers time-corrected every accidentally / unconciously paced up or slowed down beat after the fact in ProTools. Or as Sophie Ellis Bextor would have put it: \"DJ you better not kill the groove\".\n\nYou are correct, but it did take Lifeson some time to find his place with the keyboards taking over.\n\nWhich gets to the OP's point a bit, I think. I don't agree that there is widespread general disdain for keys, as lots of great bands still feature them. BUT, as a guitarist in a band, I can tell you that keyboards are a challenge to play with sometimes. Primarily because they fill such a huge portion of the sonic spectrum -- you really need a talented keyboard player who knows how to tailor his sound to keep from stepping all over the rest of the band, particularly the middle-upper range. But honestly, once that challenge is overcome, I'd be hesitant to play in a band that DOESN'T have keys.\n\nBut, somehow nobody on this board's gonna blame the person who let her play it now, are they...?\n\nMy take on this whole made-up topic is...water seeks its' own level. If there are people who have any \"disdain\" for the instrument (and, it is more than one instrument, you know), that's some deep-seated resentments that come from somewhere else. A little ol' piano never hurt anyone, you can probably trace it back to whomever was playing one at some point who hacked somebody off - certainly enough to start a thread about it!\n\nA piano is one instrument with a lot of sound variety to it. A \"keyboard\" is yet another use of the same finger-key interface, electronically-directed to a different variety of sounds. The synth has its' own variety of sound capabilities, as does/do sequencers, samplers and the touch-tone telephone (see: \"Penguin Cafe Orchestra\"). What a musician does with that is his business. What the musician resents when somebody else does something with that, is between them and their therapist.\n\nBragging on an album cover that you don't use any keyboards whatsoever, when you probably wrote some of your music at home on one, is specious at best.\n\nThe first thing that really got me excited about music in the late-'60s, was the advent of Walter Carlos and Switched-On Bach. Just like before colorization and digitally-extracted stereo, it wasn't about the immediate result of hearing something so cold and sterile and calling it \"art\"...it was the potential the tech brings to the medium...just like when Adolphe Sax brought an instrument to the orchestra that was designed so a listener in the back row could hear the string part.\n\nI’ve never heard of this issue.\n\nTownshend was a pioneer when it comes to synths and rock. I can't imagine how \"out there\" a song like Baba O' Riley must've sounded on first listen in 1971.\n\nBut I think the move away from keyboards started long before the “synth” vs. “real instrument” controversy. Little Richard and Jerry Lee Lewis were rockers who played piano, and you had proto-rockers like Fats Domino who played the piano as well. But, as with so many other things, the Beatles (and the Stones, and the Who, etc.) changed that, I think. While there are keyboards on the early Beatles records, for example, the piano solo on “Not a Second Time,” when people tuned into Ed Sullivan in 1964, they saw a drummer and three guys playing guitars, and, for better or for worse, from that point onwards, that stuck as the image of what a rock band “ought to be.”\n\nOf course the Beach Boys and the psychedelic Beatles and Stones used a lot of piano and organs and Mellotrons, but, between Little Richard and Jerry Lee Lewis and, say, Elton John and Carole King, there wasn’t really a prominent 60s rocker who was predominately known as a keyboard player, although maybe you could argue for Ray Manzarek as the lead instrumental figure in the Doors, and I guess, Doug Ingle from Iron Butterfly. But the Beatles, Stones, Who, Kinks, Yardbirds, Cream, Jimi Hendrix Experience, etc. were all “guitar bands.”\n\nIt's all down to personal preference. I remember reading that Mick, Keith and Brian thought that Bill was a bit of an \"Ernie\" because his tastes were more inclined towards Little Richard/Jerry Lee Lewis type of rock 'n' roll. For some, guitar-driven R'n'R was just... cooler. The main thrust of the mid-60s beat groups was mainly guitar-driven.\n\nPsychedelia changed everything with all the organs, mellotrons and synths filling up the soundscapes. That led to the keyboard heroes like Keith Emerson, Rick Wakeman, Rick Wright, Tony Banks and John Lord. Not much disdain there (except from guitar lovers like me ). I remember giving up on Rory Gallagher when he brought in Lou Martin on keyboards after his second album. It just sounded tacky to me, a bit \"toytown\", old fashioned.\n\nMid 70s and all the rock keyboard heroes looked and sounded (to some, me included) like fools - queue guitar-driven punk rock (Suicide did it with a synth however). The Stranglers had a keyboard player but the group were frowned on as being a bunch of hippies in drainpipes (by some). When The Clash put bar-room piano on Julie's Been Working For The Drug Squad, it raised (some) eyebrows and Elvis Costello left room for Steve Nieve to express himself,... keyboards were back. Old proggers Kraftwerk had become cool and Bowie channeled \"kautrock\" synths into his collaborations with Iggy and Eno - taking us into the 80s where synths were cool again (for some)."
