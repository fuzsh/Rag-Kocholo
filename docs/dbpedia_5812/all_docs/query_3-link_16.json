        "text": "Development from the Bantu languages\n\nSesotho is a Bantu language from the Niger-Congo language family. Its roots go back to the first millennium AD. AD, when Bantu-speaking peoples spread southwards across the African continent. Sesotho developed in what is now Lesotho and the neighboring areas of South Africa and Botswana. Historical migratory movements and social changes, especially the formation of the Basotho kingdom in the early 19th century by King Moshoeshoe I, promoted the consolidation of the language as a coherent linguistic form. This was a political and cultural measure that helped to unite different Sotho-Tswana groups under a common identity.\n\nIn the colonial period, especially during British and Dutch rule, Sesotho was established as an administrative language in some regions of South Africa. Missionaries played a crucial role in developing a standardized written form for the language and promoted its spread through the establishment of schools and the publication of Bible translations and other educational materials in Sesotho.\n\nToday's spread\n\nToday, Sesotho is one of the eleven official languages of South Africa and the national language of Lesotho. It is spoken by over 7 million people as a first or second language. In South Africa, it is particularly widespread in the Free State and Gauteng provinces, while in Lesotho it is spoken by almost the entire population. There are also speaker groups in Zimbabwe and Namibia."
