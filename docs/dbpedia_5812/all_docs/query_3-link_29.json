According to WFD Global Survey Report (2008), both organizations use oral method and Total Communication.\n\nThe first organization is St. Paul School for the Deaf (Hlotse, Leribe) caters for learners from pre-school to grade 4. After grade 4, students are transferred to a mainstream school (but St Paul offers boarding for these students). The second organization is Kananelo Centre for the Deaf in Maseru, which caters for deaf learners from pre-school to grade 7.\n\nPrince Harry from the UK visiting Kananelo Centre for the Deaf in Maseru in 2013\n\nVery little information is available on Lesotho Sign Language.Since Lesotho is landlocked by South Africa, it might be assumed that there will be considerable overlap with SASL. This has not been researched, however, and is not immediately obvious..\n\nNADL offer Lesotho SL courses at various schools. Some professional groups who have received sign language training include police, health care professionals, teachers and lawyers."
