        "text": "By Siyabonga Hadebe (available on Twitter: @siyazi)\n\nThe formula for SA languages is “one plus one equals eleven.” – Professor Sizwe Satyo of the University of Cape Town.\n\nIntroduction\n\nSouth Africa prides itself to be a ‘Rainbow Nation’, to denote its multi-ethnicity as reflected in different tribes and languages. The country has a diversity of races from Africa, Asia and Europe.[1] The rainbow nation assertion displays as the motto in the country’s supreme symbol, the coat of arms, – !ke e:/xarra//ke (meaning “diverse people unite”, or “people who are different joining together” in the Khoisan language of the /Xam people).\n\nThe country has 11 official languages according to section 6(1) of the South African constitution, namely Sepedi, Sesotho, Setswana, siSwati, Tshivenda, Xitsonga, Afrikaans, English, isiNdebele, isiXhosa and isiZulu. Some of these languages have a national character and are bigger; while others are limited to one or two provinces. For example, Xitsonga is spoken mostly in the north-eastern parts of the country, and not in the Western Cape or Eastern Cape. Afrikaans speaking people are sparsely populated in different parts of the country, but it is the home language of most whites and ‘Coloreds’ in places such as Northern Cape and Western Cape. Tshivenda is spoken solely in the far north region, and south of Zimbabwe. IsiZulu, together with other similar Nguni languages including isiXhosa, IsiSwati and IsiNdebele, pretends to be a lingua franca in the eastern and central parts of the country, with many speakers using it either as a native or second language. The footprint of Nguni languages covers many parts of the region: Zimbabwe, Malawi, Namibia, Mozambique, Malawi, Botswana, Swaziland, and Lesotho.[2]\n\nDespite the fact that indigenous languages were declared official languages in the ‘new’ South Africa, they have so far failed to match the growth of Afrikaans usage since 1948. With the ‘Rainbow Nation’ idea suppressing African nationalism, South Africa is left with no language that can be considered as truly national. This leaves acres of space for a minority language like English to usurp the number one position as a language of politics, government, technology, and education in general. The 2011 census showed a decline in six of the 11 official languages, all of them indigenous languages. This goes against section 6(2) of the country’s constitution which recognizes the “historically diminished use and status of the indigenous languages of our people”, and places a duty on the state to take practical and positive measures to elevate the status and advance the use of these languages.[3] Without a known migration from English speaking countries, the English language speakers, for example, mysteriously increased to 4.9 million in 2011 from 3.7 million in 2001.[4] Wits University’s Nhlanhla Thwala asserts, “People speak a language for a reason. Increases and decreases show which languages people find useful, regardless of whether they are their first language.”[5]\n\nIn the post-1994 South Africa, English has emerged ahead of all others and is now “ubiquitous in official and commercial public life.”[6]The educated sections of the black population normally speak this language because it is a tool for work and or because it is a symbol of status. The majority, and if not all, of the intellectual discourse in this country happens in English (and or Afrikaans), which makes one wonder how many of our 51.8 million people understand what is being discussed about them and their future. Even access to resources is reserved for those with a good command of English. Since many black families understand these dynamics, they prefer to speak to their children in English, and as a result the bulk of children who go to former “whites-only” schools speak mostly English and understand indigenous languages less and less. KC Motshabi once noted,\n\n“What is more disturbing is that Africans are assisting in the marginalizing of their mother tongues. The country is currently busy producing African youth who can hardly read, let alone write a text in their mother tongue. These youths fail to even pronounce African names correctly, let alone spell them. In some extreme cases, some African children can hardly construct a sentence in their parents’ mother tongue. The poor kid’s identity is lost because they are supposed, for example, to be Tswana and yet they know nothing about the Tswana culture and language. These children look down upon African culture just like most Caucasians do. They look down upon African religious practices as backward superstition. They are alienating themselves, with the help of their parents, from their own cultures. It is unfortunate that most parents still believe that speaking eloquent English necessarily means you are intelligent. The fallacy of this observation is the suggestion that the English in England are all intelligent because they speak English. The interesting thing is that when parents enroll their children in township schools they insist that their children attend schools that offer their mother-tongue. When these kids move to schools in town, mother-tongue preference is shelved for English and Afrikaans. Granted, the school may not be offering any African language at that stage even though it has African pupils in the majority. African parents resign themselves to the status quo more often that not. Our children should learn other languages in addition to their mother-tongue. Imagine if White, Colored and Indian children were to learn African languages as their second language at school that would add some impetus to nation-building.”[7]\n\nExploring the “Rainbow Nation” concept and indigenous languages in South Africa\n\nNwamilorho Joseph Tshawane claims that the “Rainbow Nation” concept is a “metaphoric coinage, which captures the nation’s ethnic diversity and succinctly describes post apartheid South Africa, is generally credited to Desmond Tutu.”[8] It may have been the main ingredient for forging a new, post-apartheid identity and for “forming” a new state, but indigenous populations still have to derive tangible benefits from this change in political thinking. The minority white population dominates the economic base in South Africa. Efforts of the post-apartheid state to change this have been rather weak or appeared to be directed at the tertiary sections of our society, including tertiary education, the job market or equity ownership in companies.\n\nThe significance of education in transforming societies from engaging primary economic activities to tertiary economic sector activities is well documented. Countries such as South Korea and Singapore invested heavily in education and put emphasis on developing technologies to develop their societies. In the case of South Korea, the Korean language is at center of that country’s emergence as the leader in science and innovation. At present, South Korea boasts large multinational corporations like Samsung, Kia and Hyundai that churn new technologies on a daily basis. These corporations now compete head on with companies from the traditional technology powerhouses in Europe, Japan and the United States. However, there are genuine concerns that in South Africa there is little or no focus on changing the nature of the system of education and training to meaningfully help previously marginalized groups to participate fully in knowledge production. It is fair to suggest that indigenous languages can play an important role in knowledge production and transformation of societies.\n\nThwala concludes, “We are essentially ignoring well-known facts – if you want to learn you must do so in your mother tongue. If we do not, South Africa will continue to experience high failure rates in schools and universities.”[9] Also, the Ghanain scholar Kwesi Kwaa Prah asserts, “A democratically-based language policy is crucial for the development of a democratic culture. Without a policy, which culturally empowers mass society, development in South Africa will, in the long run, stagnate.”[10]\n\nArguments for the relevance of indigenous languages in knowledge production and transformation of societies\n\nIntegration of indigenous populations and their languages in transforming the South African society is perhaps one factor that has largely been ignored by decision-makers. The current realities in South Africa as regards to its state of readiness to help indigenous populations to move away from apartheid created “permanent economic oppression” is rather appalling, to say the least. Thwala argues that languages reflected the power dynamics of a country.[11] The white liberal framework determines South Africa’s national discourse, and this stifles any prospects of South Africans being able to have “a truly multicultural national identity.”[12]\n\nIndigenous populations and their languages remain outside the ongoing political debates on creating economic opportunities for all. As such, this document puts forward the following arguments:\n\na) The political emancipation and recognition of indigenous people and their languages are not enough to transform the economic base in South Africa, and are also not commensurate with lack of usage of their languages in formal setups, whether it is in education, business or legislature. This newly forged identity perhaps has a lot of political credence but it makes little sense as indigenous people remain largely excluded from the country’s economic activity. This implies that efforts to improve access to education and economic opportunities are going to take forever to bear fruits, and thus hindering the opportunity for the state to accelerate the dilution of the country’s economic base from remaining almost exclusively in the hands of a small largely white minority, assisted by a local black middle class.\n\nb) As a language of a former colonial master and a by-product of globalisation, English is spoken worldwide and millions have a good understanding of the language. It is a dominant language of culture, science and technology, law, and other aspects of modern human endeavor. However, it remains peripheral for indigenous groups in most parts of the world including South Africa, and does not necessarily create or provide them with advantages to gain entry to economic emancipation and knowledge production necessary for them to compete on a an equal footing with powerful nations like China, United States, Germany and South Korea. It is therefore a myth that English is a global language. Kwaa Prah estimates, “African language mother-tongue speakers does not count more than 12 %.”[13]\n\nc) Furthermore, I contend that knowledge production in our country should exist within the broader context of, what the Ghanain scholar Nana Akua Anyidoho calls a “sociopolitical project of decolonization and self-determination.”[14] Changing of names of places and streets should be seen as part of this project. But, the thinking that the mere change of Hans Strijdom Road to Solomon Mahlangu Road, would bring “economic freedom” to all poor communities that reside along this avenue in the capital city of Tshwane makes the project worthless. Complementing these political efforts with access to education (in their languages) would help indigenous South Africans to create knowledge and refrain from assuming a position of consumers of knowledge produced elsewhere.\n\nd) The concept of a ‘Rainbow Nation’ bode well with “the process of achieving cultural and linguistic supremacy”[15] over blacks by Afrikaners (and the English, by extension).\n\nThere is a need for an emphasis on research, education and training as a way to strengthen the knowledge orientation of the South African society. This cannot take place in a vacuum, it is for that reason that a need arises on how to achieve this in a multi-lingual developing country where foreign languages are exclusively in the domain of a selected few (“the elite”), and are also supposed to assist people poorer countries gain knowledge and skills to weather the storms of current international realities and life in general.\n\nThe concerns of this paper are not to delve too much into the subject of classroom economics or pedagogics, but it is simply to show the importance of mother-tongue teaching in the process of knowledge production. Research on the relationship between input (mother-tongue education) and output (advance economic activity or ownership) of a “knowledge production function” should give us insights and the understanding of how societies produce innovations.\n\nIn a sense this topic is not new.\n\nFirst, Kwaa Prah wrote, “The dramatic development of Afrikaans in fifty years, and the prosperity and enlightenment it has brought Afrikaners, should bring to our understanding the relevance of language to social transformation in South Africa.”[16] From a language of slaves and domestics, the Afrikaans language was transformed to a university language. With Afrikaans as the language of instruction, Afrikaners enjoyed economic prosperity and political dominance. Afrikaner nationalism ensured that the language remains a center for identity and ideology to this day. Kwaa Prah suggests that the Afrikaner experience is an important lesson for the ‘new’ South Africa because “…continuing and future transformation in the country will have to pay full attention to the language question.”[17]\n\nSecond, Tanzanians also grappled with which language was to be used post-independence. As a result, that country developed a native language for the use by its citizens. “Kiswahili ni lugha ya Taifa Tanzania” (Kiswahili became the language of Tanzania).\n\nThe importance of indigenous languages – Kiswahili and literacy in Tanzania\n\nJulius Nyerere pursued a vision of African socialism called ‘Ujamaa’, which recognized KiSwahili as “an authentic symbol of the Tanzanian nation.”[18] Legère claims that, “SW [Swahili] played a dominant role in most domains of language use where people were to be addressed or supposed to play an active role in a dialogue with the political leadership, civil servants, etc.”[19]\n\nLegère explains that:\n\nNeedless to say that this orientation of widely using the common people’s language SW [Swahili] went along with important decisions that focused on corpus development. The expanding use of SW and its introduction into domains which were a stronghold of English as the language of the former Trusteeship administration prompted the coinage of terms for these domains (e.g. National Assembly/Parliament, ministries and administration, education) and the further standardization of the language. This corpus development was a necessary step for gradually taking over from English the role of the major official medium of communication in the country and as expressing an authentic Tanzanian identity with an optimum of public response.[20]\n\nThe political and socio-economic dynamics of globalization have unfortunately changed what was a promising attempt to put Kiswahili in a powerful position and relegated it to a second place after English. English in Tanzania and the entire East African region does not necessarily have the role of lingua franca for the purpose of wider communication. The fact of the matter is, “cultural discrepancy between English and the diversity of African cultures renders English useless in expressing their ways of life.”[21] Mugyabuso M. Mulokozi refers to this condition as “alienation.”[22] This makes it extremely difficult for indigenous populations in townships and rural areas to learn the English language. As a result, people would rather use their own languages.\n\nThe scenario articulated in the preceding paragraph indicates that it is difficult for English to permeate into everyday life of indigenous people, and this leaves them without a meaningful media or language to participate in any intellectual activity since many of indigenous languages are not developed as modes for teaching science, law, commerce, economics, and politics. This situation is widespread in many developing nations, and also explains economic development challenges in these countries. Indigenous languages are neglected and face the prospect of becoming extinct or limited to informal, non-productive settings. Government and higher institutions of learning in South Africa are currently not investing heavily in the teaching of indigenous languages. “Most South Africans are multilingual, able to speak more than one language. English- and Afrikaans-speaking people tend not to have much ability in indigenous languages, but are fairly fluent in each other’s language.”[23]It is logical to surmise that since these communities dominate the intellectual discourse and the South African economy they are able to suppress debates on the status of indigenous languages.\n\nThe situation of developing nations in the international system remains extremely complex, and there seems to be no panacea for their problems. Their challenges stem from weak institutions that can be crucial in the management and distribution of goods and services to their citizens. They largely remain poor in the face of a viciously unequal world. They either lack or mismanage their economic resources. They lag behind in human development indices either due to lack of resources or due to poorly crafted policies. Formal education and training remains the most recognized conduit through which human development can take place. Through the teaching in indigenous languages, “decimal levels of literacy can be addressed.” Mwenda Mukuthuria claims that “the use of Kiswahili in Tanzania has made this country to be an edge over the other East African countries in the levels of literacy.”[24]\n\nA country’s seriousness in developing its people reflects in policies that are put in place to help that country grow. A country shows its commitment by investing massive resources in education and in further training including universities and vocational institutions.\n\nLanguage profiency: Investment in in human development and education\n\nOne element whose importance is always underestimated in human development and education is the language, and the mother tongue in particular. Based on available information from government and private sources, in South African there is a plethora of languages that are spoken at mother tongue level but only 11 are recognized by means of the constitution. South Africa is a developing state with limited resources, and understandably it finds it impossible in delivering education in all languages. But, the role of the mother tongue in delivery of education in early primary school remains critical. The situation changes as children advance to high schools and post-matric education. The reality is that none of the 50 plus million South Africans is taught commerce, economics, mathematics, humanities, science or engineering in isiZulu, Sesotho or TshiVenda in all of the 12 tertiary institutions. Thwala warns, “Teaching pupils in their mother tongue is imperative to ensuring success at schools and tertiary institutions.”[25]\n\nCarole Benson asserts, “While there are many factors involved in delivering quality basic education, language is clearly the key to communication and understanding in the classroom. Many developing countries are characterized by individual as well as societal multilingualism, yet continue to allow a single foreign language to dominate the education sector.”[26] In the case of the Rainbow Nation, English retains an unchallengeable status as the language of education, politics, courts, culture, business and, most important, of general communication between people of different ethnic groups or ‘lingua fanca’. None of the indigenous languages enjoy this privileged status. Perhaps the isiZulu language comes a distance in this regard, but in mostly informal situations only. The language is “spoken well beyond its home areas; it is understood by all speakers of Nguni languages and is used as a lingua franca.”[27] Withstanding this advantage the usage of the isiZulu language falls short of what this document seeks to tackle, namely the relevance of mother-tongue in education and training for the purposes of knowledge production.\n\nPrestige of the language/dialect and its literary tradition\n\nThe 19th century Rumanian linguist Eugenio Coşeriu argued that the distinction between language and dialect is not based only in linguistic genetics but also has to do with the prestige of the language/dialect and its literary tradition.[28] In countries such as Spain, France or Italy, there many regional languages that are different enough from national languages to merit a status of genetic languages on their own. Since these languages are not used in many different situations but only in informal situations, they remain as dialects or “patois” of the national language. For example, Catalan is spoken in the north-eastern parts of Spain and south of France, and hence linguists conclude that it is a mix of Spanish and French. In France it has no official status. But, in the Spanish region of Catalonia it is an official language, that is used in schools and in homes. However, major Catalan newspapers such as La Vanguardia appeared only in Spanish for many years instead of Spanish until recently. In a sense this makes Catalan a patios in relation to Spanish.\n\nAlthough not entirely relevant to the South African situation, the secondary usage of Catalan in Spain mirrors the status of indigenous languages in the country. Again using isiZulu as an example, it is a language with many first- and second language speakers, and is therefore considered a genuine genetic language. It is for that reason it is one of the 11 official languages in terms of the constitution. Ilanga and Isolezwe are two newspapers written in isiZulu, and Ukhozi is also an isiZulu radio station with headquarters in Durban. The language dominates in social circles in the country’s economic hub of Gauteng province. Many people are said to have a very good understanding of isiZulu irrespective of their mother tongues.[29] With such prominence one would expect isiZulu to share or even overtake English and Afrikaans, with fewer mother-tongue speakers, in terms of relevance and usage in formal setups. English is a minority foreign language and cannot be considered a national language in the same lines as Spanish in Spain. It is also very different from indigenous languages yet it remains the main language in the post-colonial period throughout the countries that were part of the British Empire at some stage. IsiZulu remains a “patois” in relation to English, hence the “bastardization” of English to create an interesting mix of IsiZulu and English in urban South Africa.\n\nColonialism and indigenous languages as tools for control and for undermining development\n\nIn South Africa, isiZulu and isiXhosa as the first two languages to draw an interest from Europeans adopted the Roman alphabet before 1840. Bhekinkosi Ntuli and Chris Swanepoel note that the translation of the bible into indigenous languages that helped in the emergence of African written literature.[30] The first isiXhosa bible came out around 1833, and the isiZulu version was released in 1837. Without passing any judgment or reverting to old conspiracy theories, there were reasons for an overemphasis on the bible (religion/ Christianity) rather than other areas of human endeavor such as science, engineering or commerce. European colonialism was based on what English historian Thomas Pakenham refers to as the “3Cs, for Commerce, Christianity, and Civilization” plus the fourth “C, for conquest”[31] Social Darwinism informed missionaries that Africans were at early stages of human development, or equivalent to pre-feudal Europe.\n\nThe bible was part of the grandeur project of instilling certain values, which were going to make it to be far easier for Europeans to control local populations. On that score, it would have be an oxymoron if the imperial monsters would have translated law, commerce, accounting, science, biology, engineering or mechanics to engineering from European languages to isiZulu or SeSotho, for example. The contradiction would emanate from their need to promote their financial or economic interests. The combination of the four Cs led to the scramble for resources to support economic development in Europe. Locals had to be servants without full knowledge on how the “white man’s magic” (izinto zabelungu) worked. Therefore, blacks were not supposed to be exposed to modern science. They well also not supposed to own much; otherwise they would develop into a powerful class that was going to pose a threat to the white hegemony. As Frantz Fenon pointed out, the colonial system did not permit the development of a local middle class, which in turn could accumulate capital.[32] This phenomenon was carried over to the newly independent states.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn summary, the reason there are no books in science or commerce as well as other fields stems from the that European superiors wanted to control material (economics) and mental (knowledge) means of production. The outcomes of this strategy are well known, exploitation and unprecedented levels of poverty. The continued use of English in matters of intellectual material development (process of developing knowledge) excludes millions who still do not have access to the language. In neo-colonial states, English and French became passports to intellectual emancipation, and even then those who are said to be educated their energies are channeled towards servicing the capitalist master in big corporations and its arm, the state.\n\nThe continued marginalization of indigenous languages in South Africa implies that millions are excluded. English remains the tacitly accepted language for intellectual emancipation. As a result, only those with a good command of the language qualify to gain access to ‘better life for all’ and related programs. An ‘educated’ individual equals to speaking impeccable English. The implication of this is that blacks spend considerable amounts of time trying to learn a foreign language, and their potential is gauged in their grasp of the language. The transformation of Afrikaans from a kitchen language (kombuistaal) to a language of science, commerce and technology is well documented. The ‘new South Africa’ has not changed the fortunes of indigenous languages in the same scale. In fact, the growth of indigenous languages is undermined by the recently found ‘truce’ over the taalstryd (battle over language) between the English and Afrikaners.[33]\n\nEstimates show that 76 percent of the South Africa population speaks at least one language from one of the Nguni and Sotho groups, as home language. It is possible to create between two and three indigenous languages in South Africa. However, this initiative does not need to be top down but black people themselves would need at some point to decide on this very important issue. Washington Kwetana makes sense of the history (of a white man) by pointing out, “History has unwisely created isiXhosa, isiZulu, siSwati and isiNdebele into separate languages, which divided the biological grand-grand-children of the Nguni House, and, in later generations, history again mischievously gave the impression that the speakers of these languages are different nations, not even tribes. The same goes for the Sesotho groups, who are biologically linked amongst themselves, first, and to the Nguni, too.”[34]\n\nEchoing the words of Kwaa Prah, Africans must realize that “development in South Africa cannot be sustained in conditions where the majorities are by purpose or omission, culturally and linguistically disempowered.” [35] Culture, language and identity are pillars for democratic pluralism that the ‘Rainbow nation’ sought to achieve.\n\nIf the Bible could be translated into various African languages, what stops further translations of science and commerce books into isiZulu or Sepedi? Honestly, nothing. There would be no ‘train smash’ if a Zulu child were to learn in isiXhosa, or if a Tswana child received his education in Sepedi.\n\nNB: Ngo ko mlando wamandulo, izizwe zabantu abansundu eMzansi Afrika zaziziphilela kahle futhi zithuthukile, okungangokuthi zazihweba nezinye izizwe zakude kufana neShayina kanye nama-Arabhu.
