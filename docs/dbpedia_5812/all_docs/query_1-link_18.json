Curiosities are always fun to learn, so letâs go over a few surprising facts about countries where English is spoken.\n\n1. English is not recognized as an official language of the United States.\n\nYes, you read that right. Although the USA is one of the countries where English is the primary language of the population, it has never declared it as an official language. In fact, the USA doesnât have an official language. Thatâs because the USA is a multilingual territory, and has been even before the founding of the republic. Not declaring an official language - despite the fact that English has always been its predominant language - was a way of protecting that linguistic diversity.\n\n2. Some American states have their own official language, apart from English.\n\nAlthough the USA has no official language as a country, some of its states do. While 32 of them have declared English as their official language, there are a few that have also recognized other official languages. For example, Alaska recognizes 20 indigenous official languages, apart from English. In Hawaii, Hawaiian is recognized as an official language next to English.\n\n3. Thereâs only one English speaking country in South America.\n\nWhile South America is primarily a Spanish-speaking continent, thereâs one South American country where English is an official language. Itâs Guyana, and it used to be a British colony until 1966, when it gained its independence. However, even though English is an official language in this country, the majority of the population speaks Guyanese Creole as their main language.\n\nDiscover the English speaking world\n\nAs you can now see, the English speaking world is hugely diverse. English is a language spoken on almost every continent on the planet. It connects different cultures, enabling us to freely communicate with people in different countries.\n\nAnd as you continue learning English, youâll keep on discovering new things about the countries where English is spoken and sinking deeper and deeper into this fascinating world.\n\nIf youâd like to learn more about the English language, explore all the free resources on our English language blog.\n\nExpand your knowledge of English\n\nÂ"
