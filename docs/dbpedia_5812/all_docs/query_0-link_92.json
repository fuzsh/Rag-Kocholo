        "text": "Business Customs\n\nBreakfast meetings are gaining popularity, lunches tend to be one hour long, and business meetings are either normally held in offices or over meals. It is important to reconfirm appointments the day of the meeting. There are often delays and many meetings start or run late.\n\nBusiness attire in Lesotho is similar to attire in the United States, if slightly more formal. Common terminology used for dress code in business invitations are:\n\nBlack Tie (dark suit and tie or tuxedo or formal evening dress)\n\nBusiness (jacket and tie or a business dress)\n\nSmart Casual (casual clothing with or without tie, but no jeans and no sneakers)\n\nCasual (includes jeans but no sport shorts)\n\nTravel Advisory\n\nFor travel advisory information on Lesotho, please click on the link below to the State Department’s consular information sheet for Lesotho: https://travel.state.gov/…/Lesotho.html\n\nVisa requirements\n\nU.S. citizens traveling to Lesotho require a valid passport. U.S. passport holders on holiday or business visits for periods of up to 90 days, do not a require visa to enter Lesotho. Vaccination for yellow fever is a common requirement and travelers should carry their international vaccination cards with them. For more information concerning entry requirements, travelers may contact the Lesotho Embassy in Washington:\n\nEmbassy of Lesotho 2511 Massachusetts Avenue, NW\n\nWashington, DC. 20008\n\nTel: (202) 797-5533\n\nWebsite: https://ls.usembassy.gov\n\nU.S. companies that require travel of foreign businesspersons to the United States should be advised that security evaluations are handled via an interagency process. Visa applicants should go to the following links:\n\nState Department Visa Website: https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas.html\n\nUnited States Embassy Maseru Website: https://ls.usembassy.gov/visas/\n\nCurrency\n\nThe currency unit is the loti, which is pegged 1:1 against the South African Rand; the average exchange rate for 2021 to 2022was 1480:1 Maloti to the dollar. Lesotho uses the metric system for weight and measurements. Credit and debit cards are widely accepted at major restaurants and in retail centers, and ATMs that accept U.S. ATM networks are generally available in Maseru.\n\nTelecommunications/Electronics\n\nLesotho Communication Authority (LCA) regulates telecommunication services. Lesotho’s telecommunications network has grown significantly in recent years; however, market penetration is still below the African average. Econet provides mobile network services, along with Vodacom Lesotho (VCL). Dial-up is still the most common mode of internet access; VCL and Econet however, also have wireless broadband technology (3G and EVDO respectively). Both VCL and Econet have launched 4G Long Term Evolution (LTE) services. Lesotho is the first African country to launch 5G network service. In 2019, VCL conducted fixed-wireless 5G trials based on a trial 3.5HGz license. Currently only two commercial clients have expressed interest in using 5G hence services are not yet offered.\n\nResources\n\nLesotho Communications Authority: https://www.lca.org.ls/\n\nTransportation\n\nTravel to Lesotho can either be by road or by air. Moshoeshoe I International Airport (MSU) is located in Maseru, and there are regular flights to/from O.R. Tambo International Airport (JNB) in Johannesburg, South Africa. Owning or renting a private car is essential in Lesotho since public transportation is, in most instances, not suitable for U.S. tourists or travelers, except for a few private taxi companies.

Lesotho has a very high HIV prevalence, currently estimated at 25.6 percent of the adult population. Travelers should ensure they are aware of the associated risks and risk behavior.

Some businesses close for lunch between 13:00 and 14:00. Banks are open weekdays from 09:00 to 15:30, and on Saturdays from 08:30 to 12:00.\n\nTemporary Entry of Materials and Personal Belongings\n\nTravelers must declare all goods in their possession except for personal clothing, essential toilet articles, and used sporting equipment. To be free from declaration, these goods must be for the passenger’s personal use and not intended as gifts or to be sold, exchanged, or traded. All articles, used or unused, carried by the visitor as presents or parcels for other persons, must be declared.\n\nFor more information on requirements on temporary entry of materials and personal belongings, please check the customs requirements at the Revenue Services Lesotho at https://www.rsl.org.ls."
