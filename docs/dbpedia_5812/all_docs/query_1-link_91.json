        "text": "The worldâ€™s youngest language, coming in at only 100 years old (officially), is the South African language of Afrikaans. Surprised? Afrikaans, the natively spoken language of 7 million South Africans, was born from the white Dutch, French, and German colonizers in South Africa in the 17th and 18th centuries.\n\nOther influences from the indigenous and Malay people contributed to Afrikaans, as we will learn about later. Compare this to other languages, such as English. While the modern form of Afrikaans is less than 100 years old, the modern English language is 400+ years old, and Old English dates back hundreds of years further than that. So, Afrikaans is a very young language compared to other modern national & official languages!\n\nAfrikaans should be easy to learn if youâ€™re a native speaker of English or Dutch (comparatively). The Afrikaansâ€™ grammar and vocabulary have similar counterparts in English and Dutch.\n\nFor example, look at the following words in Dutch, Afrikaans, and English.\n\nThe main difference between these words is spelling! The similarities, especially between Dutch and Afrikaans, are compelling.\n\nFun fact! Most Dutch speakers can understand Afrikaans (especially in the written language), but Afrikaans speakers will not have the same level of comprehension of the Dutch language. This is because Afrikaans is 90-95% related to the Dutch language and has slight spelling differences easily recognizable by Dutch speakers.\n\nNow itâ€™s time to dive into more historical and cultural facts about the worldâ€™s youngest national language.\n\nWorldâ€™s Youngest Language: What Is The History Of Afrikaans?\n\nAfrikaans is considered a spawn of the Dutch language (specifically from the Holland region of the Netherlands) and was initially called â€˜Cape Dutchâ€™ due to the large concentration of Dutch settlers in Cape Town.\n\nThe language evolved through the 1700s and morphed into the modern Afrikaans spoken today. Native Afrikaans speakers take great pride in their language and view it as a token of their striking (and young) culture.\n\nInterestingly, the South Africans who speak Afrikaans as their first language make up only 14% of the population. Most South Africans speak Zulu (23%) and English (10% â€“ though most people speak English, as it is the primary language used in the South African government). Technically, South Africa has 11 recognized official languages. Wow!\n\nThough there are only 7 million Afrikaans native speakers in South Africa, another 8 million â€“ 16 million people speak Afrikaans worldwide.\n\nSome areas include African countries like Zimbabwe, Zambia, Malawi, and Lesotho. But a small portion of Western countries like the United States, Netherlands, and the United Kingdom also have Afrikaans speakers. Who would have guessed?\n\nWhat Makes Afrikaans A Unique Language?\n\nAfrikaans is unique in that it is a pidgin language â€“ meaning that it was developed as a separate language of grammatically simplified communication between the Dutch, Malay, and Khoikhoi (native) people.\n\nOver time, generations grew up speaking this pidgin language, which developed into what it is today. It is a misconception that only white South Africans speak Afrikaans. Because a hodgepodge of cultures and races came together to create the language, most people who speak Afrikaans are mixed-raced and of indigenous cultures.\n\nThe Afrikaans language was ratified in the 1920s when Afrikaans speakers outnumbered the people who knew Dutch. This means it became a recognized language in South Africa. The birth of a new language is a remarkable feat, one that is highly unlikely to occur again â€“ so this was a huge moment in history.\n\nThe story and conception of Afrikaans is a fascinating piece of history that is unknown in most parts of the world.
