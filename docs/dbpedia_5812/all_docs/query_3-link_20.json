        "text": "How many languages are spoken in South Africa, and what are they?\n\nWell, until the mid-1990s, the official languages of South Africa were Dutch, Afrikaans and English—despite African languages being spoken by more than 80% of the population. Fortunately, 1996 brought a new constitution, which changed all of that.\n\nNow, there are 11 official languages in South Africa, nine of which are African languages from the Bantu family. They were brought from West Africa as early as 3000 BCE. As part of the larger Niger-Congo language family, all the African languages of South Africa are tonal: Using a high or low tone changes the meaning of a word.\n\nNow that we’ve got that covered, let’s take a more detailed look at the official languages spoken in South Africa.\n\n1. Zulu (isiZulu)\n\n2. Xhosa (isiXhosa)\n\n3. Afrikaans\n\n4. English\n\n5. Sesotho sa Leboa (Northern Sotho)\n\n6. Setswana\n\n7. Sesotho (Southern Sotho)\n\n8. Xitsonga (Tsonga)\n\n9. siSwati (Swazi)\n\n10. Tshivenda (Venda)\n\n11. Ndebele\n\n1. Zulu (isiZulu)\n\nNumber of speakers: 27.3 million\n\nLanguage family: Bantu\n\nLanguage sub-family: Nguni\n\nTopping our list of official South African languages is a language called Zulu, spoken most prominently in the KwaZulu-Natal province. This is a language of the Nguni, an ethnic group that makes up almost two-thirds of South Africa’s Black population. Specifically, Zulu is spoken by Central and North Nguni peoples.\n\nNotable features\n\nZulu is South Africa’s most widely spoken language\n\nIt uses clicks to represent c, x and q\n\nIt borrows a lot of vocabulary from English and Afrikaans\n\n2.

English\n\nNumber of speakers: 15.9 million\n\nLanguage family: Indo-European\n\nLanguage sub-family: West Germanic\n\nDespite being way down in fourth place on our list, English is a language of media, business and government in South Africa. The majority of English speakers are found in the Western Cape province, followed by Gauteng and KwaZulu-Natal.\n\nEnglish arrived in South Africa in the late 18th century with the British occupation of the Cape of Good Hope, which had previously been colonized by the Dutch. By 1822, it was the official language of the Cape.\n\nNotable features\n\nSouth African English is heavily influenced by other South African languages\n\nIt is also influenced by the languages of countries that were colonized by the Dutch, British and Portuguese, such as Malaysia and India\n\n5. Sesotho sa Leboa (Northern Sotho)\n\nNumber of speakers: 13.8 million\n\nLanguage family: Bantu\n\nLanguage sub-family: Sotho-Tswana\n\nSesotho sa Leboa is also sometimes known as Sepedi, which is the language’s main dialect. It’s part of the Sotho-Tswana language sub-family and is most widespread in the province of Limpopo, in the north of the country (Leboa means north), and in the Mpumalanga province.\n\nNotable features\n\nSesotho sa Leboa doesn’t use articles with its nouns\n\nIt has an abundance of proverbs and idiomatic expressions\n\nIt was first converted to writing by Berlin missionaries\n\n6.

Sesotho (Southern Sotho)\n\nNumber of speakers: 11.8 million\n\nLanguage family: Bantu\n\nLanguage sub-family: Sotho-Tswana\n\nSesotho, aka Southern Sotho, is part of the Sotho-Tswana language sub-family.

It’s also the national language of Eswatini (formerly Swaziland), a small nation surrounded by South African countries. This Nguni language is nowhere near as widespread as the others on our list.\n\nNotable features\n\nThe siSwati in the far south part of the country has a lot of Zulu influence and is considered non-standard\n\nThe Mpumalanga version is closer to standard, but word stress and intonation differ, having less harmonious sounds\n\nThe dialect that’s spoken in the center and northern parts of Eswatini is considered the most prestigious, with a “royal style of slow, heavily stressed enunciation”\n\n10. Tshivenda (Venda)\n\nNumber of speakers: 2.9 million\n\nLanguage family: Bantu\n\nLanguage sub-family: Sotho-Makua-Venda\n\nTshivenda, also known as Venda, is in the Sotho-Makua-Venda sub-family of languages.
