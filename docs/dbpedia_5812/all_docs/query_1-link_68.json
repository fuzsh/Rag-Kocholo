        "text": "South Africa - Culture, Etiquette and Business Practices\n\nHowzit?! Welcome to our guide to South Africa!\n\nUseful for anyone researching South African culture, customs, manners, etiquette, values and wanting to understand the people better.\n\nRemember this is only a very basic level introduction and is not meant to stereotype all South Africans you may meet!\n\nWhat will you Learn?\n\nYou will gain an understanding of a number of key areas including:\n\nLanguage\n\nReligion and beliefs\n\nCulture and society\n\nSocial etiquette and customs\n\nBusiness culture and etiquette\n\nFacts and Statistics\n\nLocation: Southern most tip of Africa, bordering Botswana 1,840 km, Lesotho 909 km, Mozambique 491 km, Namibia 967 km, Swaziland 430 km, Zimbabwe 225 km\n\nCapital: Pretoria\n\nClimate: mostly semiarid; subtropical along east coast; sunny days, cool nights\n\nPopulation: 56+ million (2019 est.)\n\nEthnic Make-up: black 75.2%, white 13.6%, Coloured 8.6%, Indian 2.6%\n\nReligions: Christian 68% (includes most whites and Coloreds, about 60% of blacks and about 40% of Indians), Muslim 2%, Hindu 1.5% (60% of Indians), indigenous beliefs and animist 28.5%\n\nGovernment: republic\n\nBusiness Culture: Ranked 44th in the Business Culture Complexity Indexâ„¢\n\nLanguages in South Africa\n\nSouth Africa has 11 official languages. English is the language of administration and is spoken throughout the country.\n\nThe other official languages are: Afrikaans, Ndebele, Northern Sotho, Southern Sotho, Swazi, Tsongo, Tswana, Venda, Xhosa and Zulu.\n\nPeople from Mamelodi, Pretoria.

In urban areas many different ethnic groups will make up the population. In addition to the indigenous black peoples of South Africa colonialism and immigration have brought in white Europeans, Indians, Indo-Malays, Chinese and many more.\n\nAs such it is difficult to generalise at all on South African etiquettes and culture due to the diversity.\n\nThe Family in South Africa\n\nThe basic unit of South African society is the family, which includes the nuclear family and the extended family or tribe.\n\nIn traditional African society, the tribe is the most important community as it is the equivalent of a nation. The tribe provides both emotional and financial security in much the same way the nuclear family does to white or coloured South Africans.\n\nThe coloured and more traditional Afrikaans cultures consider their extended family to be almost as important as their nuclear family, while the English-speaking white community places more emphasis on the nuclear family.\n\nThe nuclear family is the ultimate basis of the tribe. The tribal and family units are being disrupted by changes in the economic reorganization of the country\n\nAs more people move into the urban areas, they attempt to maintain familial ties, including providing financial support to family members who have remained in the village.\n\nThe Rural/Urban Dichotomy\n\nThere are vast differences between the values of the rural and urban dwellers.\n\nThe majority of the whites living in rural areas are Afrikaner farmers who are descended from the Calvinists. Their views on the world are sometimes narrow. At the same time they value human decency over materialism.\n\nCity dwellers live life in the fast lane, which affects their outlook.\n\nPeople from Johannesburg can quite often be regarded as having materialistic values, and being more interested in what you own rather than who you are. They prefer to see themselves as urbane and their country cousins as less sophisticated.\n\nPeople from Cape Town are very proud of their city, and often appear to have a superior attitude about their city versus the rest of the country. Family ties, long-term friendships and social standing are all important to Capetonians.\n\nThe many rural black communities are still rooted in the traditions of their heritage, whereas the increasingly urban black community combines their roots with the urban environment and international influences that surround them.\n\n\"Meem Alif\" from the Arabic for the letters M and A. A glimpse at the very multi-cultural backgrounds of most South Africans.

It is common for several friends to contribute to this gift to help defray the cost.\n\nIf you are invited to a South African's home, bring flowers, good quality chocolates, or a bottle of good South African wine to the hostess.\n\nWrapping a gift nicely shows extra effort.\n\nGifts are opened when received.\n\nDining Etiquette\n\nIf you are invited to a South African's house:\n\nArrive on time if invited to dinner.\n\nContact the hostess ahead of time to see if she would like you to bring a dish.\n\nWear casual clothes. This may include jeans or pressed shorts. It is a good idea to check with the hosts in advance.\n\nIn Johannesburg, casual is dressier than in other parts of the country. Do not wear jeans or shorts unless you have spoken to the hosts.\n\nOffer to help the hostess with the preparation or clearing up after a meal is served.\n\nVegan and vegetarian food is getting very popular in the cities.

The initial meeting is often used to establish a personal rapport and to determine if you are trustworthy.\n\nAfter a meeting, send a letter summarizing what was decided and the next steps.\n\nChurch Square, Pretoria by Kyle-Philip Coulson on Unsplash\n\nBusiness Negotiations\n\nIt is imperative to develop mutual trust before negotiating.\n\nWomen have yet to attain senior level positions. If you send a woman, she must expect to encounter some condescending behaviour and to be tested in ways that a male colleague would not.\n\nDo not interrupt a South African while they are speaking.\n\nSouth Africans strive for consensus and win-win situations.\n\nInclude delivery dates in contracts. Deadlines are often viewed as fluid rather than firm commitments.\n\nStart negotiating with a realistic figure. South Africans do not like haggling over price.\n\nDecision-making may be concentrated at the top of the company and decisions are often made after consultation with subordinates, so the process can be slow and protracted.\n\nDress Etiquette\n\nBusiness attire is becoming more informal in many companies. However, for the first meeting, it is best to dress more conservatively.\n\nMen should wear dark coloured conservative business suits.\n\nWomen should wear elegant business suits or dresses.\n\nManagement\n\nRead our guide to South African Management Culture for more information on this topic."
