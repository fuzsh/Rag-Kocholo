Speakers of Sotho-Tswana languages constitute a majority in many Highveld areas. The other two primary linguistic groups are the Tsonga (or Shangaan) speakers (primarily the Tsonga peoples), concentrated in Limpopo and Mpumalanga provinces, and the Venda speakers (primarily the Venda peoples), located largely in Limpopo province.\n\nAudio File: National anthem of South Africa\n\nHead Of State And Government:\n\nPresident: Cyril Ramaphosa\n\nPopulation:\n\n(2024 est.) 64,701,000\n\nCurrency Exchange Rate:\n\n1 USD equals 18.797 South African rand\n\nForm Of Government:\n\nmultiparty republic with two legislative houses (National Council of Provinces [90]; National Assembly [400])\n\nWhite South Africans form two main language groups. More than half of them are Afrikaans speakers, the descendants of mostly Dutch, French, and German settlers. The remainder consists largely of English speakers who are descended mainly from British colonists, though there are a sizable minority of Portuguese and smaller groups of Italians and others. Most of the population formerly classified as Coloured speaks Afrikaans or, to a lesser extent, English.\n\nRecent News\n\nAug. 27, 2024, 4:29 AM ET (Newsweek)\n\nSouth Africa Cracks Down on 'Construction Mafias'\n\nAug. 26, 2024, 10:33 AM ET (Earth.com)\n\nSouth Africa will 'bomb' invasive mice eating seabirds alive\n\nAug. 25, 2024, 9:09 AM ET (The Guardian)\n\nMinister seeks legal settlement in case of South Africa’s imperilled penguins\n\nAug. 24, 2024, 10:09 AM ET (BBC)\n\nSouth Africa politics: Kasala as Malema deputy jump ship\n\nAug. 24, 2024, 3:10 AM ET (BBC)\n\nFloyd Shivambu's defection shakes South Africa's EFF and Julius Malema\n\nTwelve languages (Afrikaans, English, Ndebele, Pedi, Sotho, South African Sign Language, Swati, Tsonga, Tswana, Venda, Xhosa, and Zulu) hold official status under the 1996 constitution (since amended), and an additional 11 (Arabic, German, Greek, Gujarati, Hebrew, Hindi, Portuguese, Sanskrit, Tamil, Telegu, and Urdu) are to be promoted and developed; all languages are spoken to varying degrees in different regions. In some rural areas most residents speak neither Afrikaans nor English, but those two languages allow for communication in most parts of the country. English appears to predominate to an increasing extent in official, educational, and formal business spheres, which reflects a shift away from Afrikaans as the predominant language of government.\n\nReligion\n\nThe majority of South Africans are Christians. The largest established Christian denominations directly rooted in European settlement but now drawing members from all ethnic groups are the Methodist, Roman Catholic, Anglican, and Dutch Reformed churches. A large number of people follow independent African Christian churches, which vary in size from a few to millions of members. These faiths differ widely in their degree of theological orthodoxy or heterodoxy from traditional Christian beliefs, but they tend to be more open to aspects of indigenous culture and religion and to emphasize physical and spiritual healing. There is a sizable minority that adheres to traditional beliefs. Other religions are Hinduism, among the majority of Indians; Islam, among many Indians and Malays; and Judaism, among a minority of the white population.\n\nSettlement patterns\n\nMore than nine-tenths of the inhabitants live in the eastern half of the country and in the southern coastal regions. In contrast, the western region, except for the area around Cape Town in the extreme southwest, is sparsely populated. Urban areas contain about two-thirds of the population; many of these consist of huge informal or squatter settlements that lack the basic infrastructure for transportation, water, sanitation, or electricity.\n\nA large part of the Black population is concentrated in the former “homeland” (Bantustan) areas, scattered territories in the northern and eastern parts of the country that were left to Blacks after the 19th-century wars of white conquest and dispossession. Under apartheid, millions of nonwhites were forcibly relocated from cities and white-owned farms into the Bantustans. Boundary changes also placed many large informal settlements under Bantustan jurisdiction, so that some of these areas came to exhibit urban, rather than rural, population densities.\n\nRural settlement\n\nWhites own the majority of rural land, although Blacks originally settled most of it. Traditional Black settlements consisted of farming homesteads or villages. The land belonged to the community, and the chief or headman granted each household the right to build a home and cultivate an area of land. Pastoral land around the area was used communally. Conquest and the establishment of white authority and private ownership of land made these settlement patterns subordinate to others. In places where Blacks retained their access to land, however, elements of these patterns survived and may still be found in the more-remote parts of certain reserve areas. Where sharecropping and labor tenancy have provided Blacks with access to farmland, a local architecture using industrial as well as more-traditional materials has developed. About one-sixth of the Black population lives on farmland owned by whites.\n\nRural patterns created by white settlement from the late 17th century onward were centered on privately owned farmsteads, usually considerable distances apart, each having its associated cluster of sharecropper, tenant, or employee housing. As the frontier of white settlement expanded in the 18th and 19th centuries, each farmer claimed land, often several thousand acres, and this gave rise to a settlement pattern of widely dispersed homesteads. Smaller farms and more-intensive cultivation, however, always existed in some areas, such as the grape-growing areas of the southwest. As the urban demand for food and other agricultural produce grew rapidly from the late 19th century, many farms closer to towns or in more-favorable ecological zones were subdivided, and a denser pattern emerged. More recently the general tendency has been for farm sizes to increase and the number of landowners to decline. The population of farmworker residents has also decreased as mechanized production methods and corporate farm ownership have become more widespread."
