We're not called \"The Rainbow Nation\" for nothing.\n\nEnglish is the most spoken language in official and commercial public life.\n\nBecause it is the second language of the vast majority of South Africans, it is also the language most widely understood.\n\nThe 11 officially recognized languages are the following;\n\nThe maps below show in which areas of the country the different languages are spoken.

Initially known as Cape Dutch, Afrikaans was largely a spoken language for people living in the Cape, with proper Dutch the formal, written language. Afrikaans came into its own with the growth of Afrikaner identity.\n\nIt was declared an official language, together with English, of the Union of South Africa in 1925. Afrikaans is spoken mainly by white Afrikaners, coloured South Africans and sections of the black population. Although the language has European roots, today the majority of Afrikaans-speakers are not white.\n\nDistribution of Afrikaans speakers.\n\nArea of the country where the Afrikaans language is dominant.\n\nlanguages of south africa, south african language copyright © South African tourism\n\nHome language to: 13.3% of the population\n\nFamily: Indo-European\n\nVarieties: Eastern Cape Afrikaans (Oosgrensafrikaans, which became Standard Afrikaans), Cape Afrikaans (Kaapse Afrikaans) and Orange River Afrikaans (Oranjerivierafrikaans)\n\nTop of page\n\nEnglish,...\n\nA winemaker tests a new batch of wine at the Orange River Wine Cellars in the Northern Cape province\n\nlanguages of south africa, south african language copyright © South African tourism\n\nEnglish has been both a highly influential language in South Africa, and a language influenced, in turn, by adaptation in the country's different communities.
