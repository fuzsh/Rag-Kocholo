        "text": "Origin and development\n\nThe origins of Zulu can be traced back to the beginning of the 17th century, when the Nguni people migrated to what is now South Africa. Zulu developed from the earlier Nguni dialects in the region and has been shaped by local and foreign influences over the centuries.\n\nA significant development in the history of the Zulu language is closely linked to the rise of the Zulu kingdom under King Shaka Zulu in the early 19th century. Through the expansion and unification of various Nguni groups under Shaka's rule, Zulu became more important and increasingly widespread.\n\nIn the 20th century, the expansion of the education system in South Africa led to further standardization. In 1972, Zulu was introduced as the language of instruction in South African schools, further promoting its use and formal study.\n\nThe language is known for its rich oral tradition, which is reflected in songs, stories and poetry. Zulu uses the Latin alphabet and is known for its three click sounds, which it has adopted from neighboring Bantu languages."
