        "text": "ece-auto-gen\n\nHere's a list of the 27 English-speaking African countries.\n\nBurundi\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nBurundi has three official languages: French, English, and Kirundi\n\nKirundi is the country's national dialect. However, almost 98% of the population is fluent in Kirundi. It is also recognised as the national language of the country in the constitution.\n\nBotswana\n\nBotswana has two official languages: English and Setswana. Setswana is the country's national language, but English remains the preferred choice in the business environment.\n\nCameroon\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nCameroun or Cameroon? That is the starting point of confusion. Having been colonised by the French and the Brits at different points, the country has two official languages: French and English. French is the most widely spoken language in eight out of ten regions, while the other two regions speak English.\n\nEthiopia\n\nAlthough Ethiopia was never a colony of the United Kingdom, English is the official language in the country. English is widely spoken in its tertiary institutions and corporate organisations.\n\nEritrea\n\nA country with three official languages, Eritreans speak English, Arabic, and Tigrigna. English was introduced into the country following WW II.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nGambia\n\nActually called The Gambia, English has remained the country's official language since its colonial rule. Nonetheless, Wolof remains a widely spoken first language in the West African nation.\n\nGhana\n\nGhana is a predominantly English-speaking country dating back to its colonial rule under the British government. Today, the country has 11 other official dialects, but English is chief among them.\n\nKenya\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nKenya is another African country with two official languages. Swahili had been the country's recognised official language before the British colonial rule and still is today. Nevertheless, English also remains a primary language in Kenya following its adoption during the colonial era.\n\nLesotho\n\nAlthough Sesotho and English are the primary languages spoken in Lesotho, Sesotho is still widely spoken in different parts of the country than English.\n\nLiberia\n\nLiberia is a multilingual country where more than 20 tribal languages are spoken. English is Liberia's official language and serves as the lingua franca, or common language, that helps connect people of various linguistic backgrounds living in the country.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nMalawi\n\nEnglish is the official language of Malawi, while Chichewa is its national language spoken by about 57% of the population. English was introduced to the country during the colonial era; however, a 2008 Census reports that only 26 per cent of the population above the age of 14 is able to speak English.\n\nMauritius\n\nSimilar to Cameroon, French and English are the country's official languages. French is the language that tends to be used in education and media, while English is the official language in Parliament. Different countries have colonised this beautiful country on different occasions. First, it was the Arabs who ruled Mauritius, followed by the Dutch, the French, and eventually the British.\n\nNamibia\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe Germans colonised Namibia for three decades; however, English came to the fore as a language of resistance and liberation in the country's struggle for independence. While English remains the country's primary language, Afrikaans, a Dutch-Germanic language, is still spoken in Namibia.\n\nNigeria\n\nNigeria is a multilingual country comprised of different ethnic groups, which occupied a complicated landscape from its historic-cultural, political, economic, and educational developments. Nigeria was colonised by the British, and in the time Nigeria was a British colony, English was made an official language. Many years after independence from the British, Nigeria resolved to continue using English as the national language since the country is a multi-ethnic nation with about 500+ ethnic tribes and languages. Many feared prioritising an indigenous language over the other would bring about chaos.\n\nRwanda\n\nRwanda is home to four official languages, including Kinyarwanda, Swahili, French, and English. While Swahili is widely spoken than any other language in the country, English is the business language as its introduction was to sustain the country's place in the global market.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nSaint Helena\n\nSaint Helena remains an overseas territory of the United Kingdom. As such, despite the country's numerous local dialects, English remains the official language.\n\nSeychelles\n\nSeychellois Creole, French and English comprise the official languages spoken in Seychelles. However, English spread throughout the country during British rule. Today, English remains the most spoken official language in Seychelles.\n\nSierra Leone\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nBengali and English are the official languages of Sierra Leone. English also remains the predominant official language in the country.\n\nSomaliland\n\nSomali, English, and Arabic are the official languages approved in the country. The British colonised the North West Region, and English has since remained the official language throughout the country.\n\nSouth Africa\n\nEnglish is an official language in South Africa along with other 10 native languages: isiNdebele, isiSwati, xiTsonga, tshiVenda, Afrikaans, sePedi, seSotho, Setswana, isiXhosa and isiZulu. The most spoken first languages are Zulu(23%), Xhosa(16%), Afrikaans(14%) and English(10%). Most South Africans speak at least two languages, with English being the general lingua franca.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nSouth Sudan\n\nHaving been mired in political conflict and skewed history, the South Sudanese government chose English as its strict official language.\n\nSudan\n\nArabic was a long-standing official language in Sudan. However, it has since been replaced by English which remains the principal language in the North African country.\n\nSwaziland\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nSwaziland has two official languages: Swati, the national language spoken by more than 95% of the population, and English. The citizens are well-versed in English, which is the official business language.\n\nTanzania\n\nTanzanian law no longer constitutes English as the official language. However, it can still be considered as an official language because it is still the language of higher courts. Tanzanians, therefore, see themselves as having two official languages: English and Swahili. Swahili is the unifying language of the country between different tribes who each have their own tribal language. In contrast, English provides Tanzanians with the ability to participate in the global economy and culture.\n\nUganda\n\nUganda is home to more than 40 recognised languages. However, English became popular in Uganda during colonial times and has been the country's official language since its independence. The use of it has increased since the introduction of Universal Primary Education in Uganda.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nZambia\n\nZambia has several major indigenous languages, all of which are members of the Bantu family. However, English is the official language and is used to conduct official business and education.\n\nZimbabwe\n\nWhile most Zimbabweans speak Shona (75%) and Ndebele (18%) as a first language, standard English is the country's lingua franca, used in government and business and as the main medium of instruction in schools. Zimbabwe was also recognised by the Guinness World Records as the country with the highest number of official languages - 16. These include Xhosa, Venda, Tswana, Tonga, Sotho, Sign Language, Shona, Shangani, Ndebele, Ndau, Nambya, Koisan, Kalanga, Chewa, Chibarwe, and English."
