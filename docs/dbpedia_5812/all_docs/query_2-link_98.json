The research problem is that the post-1994 governments of South Africa stated in the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa (1996) that indigenous official African languages must be in the curricula of the education system. But the findings reflect that this constitutional mandate has not been accomplished in the twenty years of South Africa's liberation. Conclusions drawn are that the former two official languages used in the education policies of the apartheid South Africa, i.e. English and Afrikaans, have continued to be used in pretended implementation of indigenous official African languages in the curricula of education of a free South Africa. Résumé Cet article met l'accent sur la politique des langues africaines indigènes dans les débats sur l'enseignement en Afrique du Sud post apartheid et offre une revue de la politique de la langue dans l'éducation au cours des 20 dernières années passées de libération en Afrique du Sud. Le problème de recherche est que les Gouvernements post 1994 de l'Afrique du Sud déclaraient dans la constitution de la République d'Afrique du Sud (1996)\n\nThis paper focuses on the indigenous African languages policy in educa- tion debates in post-apartheid South Africa, and provides a policy review of language in education in the past 20 years of liberation in the South Africa. The research problem is that the post-1994 governments of South Africa stated in the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa (1996) that indigenous official African languages must be in the curricula of the education system. But the findings reflect that this constitutional mandate has not been accomplished in the twenty years of South Africa’s liberation. Conclusions drawn are that the former two official languages used in the education policies of the apartheid South Africa, i.e. English and Afrikaans, have continued to be used in pretended implementation of indigenous of- ficial African languages in the curricula of education of a free South Africa.\n\nSection 29(2) of the Constitution categorically recognises the right of every pupil \"to receive education in the official language or languages of their choice in public educational institutions\". The Constitution ardently seeks to develop and transform the education system of the republic and to foster access to education for all without any stumbling blocks. Be that as it may, language still remains to be a stumbling block towards the access to education. This research paper delves on a critical assessment of the language policy in the public schools. In the recent years, there have been a number of perils allied with the realisation of the right to receive education in the language of choice the Hoërskool Overvaal case evinces this submission quite clearly. It is against this backdrop that this paper seeks to appraise the challenges surrounding the issue of language policy in public schools and to provide apposite recommendations in paving a way forward to settle the affair of language policy in public schools.\n\nLanguages users may cause violence and racism: in 1976, protests against the imposition of Afrikaans at South African schools&lt;br&gt; became a massacre when the police killed 172 native protesters. But, which language to choose as language of instruction since South Africa counts eleven official languages. Therefore, this paper discusses whether English should be South Africa&#39;s sole language of instruction, to stimulate the native population&#39;s presence at universities. To support the research, governmental documents on language policy and education have been examined. Also, the linguistic diversity of South African English through language contact has been described. South Africa&#39;s language policy underlines education in vernacular languages at public schools, whereas English is used at universities. This generates a low proficiency in English; therefore, many native South Africans do not enroll at universities. The result is once again an Apartheid-like segregation, w..."
