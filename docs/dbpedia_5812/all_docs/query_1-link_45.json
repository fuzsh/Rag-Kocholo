We estimate that Sesotho (Southern Sotho) is spoken by just over 5 million people. Most of these speakers are in South Africa and Lesotho; it is a national language in both territories. There are also small numbers of speakers in Botswana and the United Kingdom. Sesotho is strongly related to Northern Sotho and Tswana.",

Estimating the number of speakers of a language is fraught with difficulty on several levels (last accessed January 2009). We aim to map as complete data as possible and therefore estimate data for missing values. The language numbers we use and publish are rough estimates, and should not be taken as definitive. In some cases, missing data for very small territories is not used in the cartogram and that area is therefore omitted in the map.\n\nFurther notes on the data, as well as all modifications to the original data source are noted in our data sheets.\n\nDownload data file"
