        "text": "South Africa has 11 official languages and a multilingual population fluent in at least two. IsiZulu and isiXhosa are the largest languages, while English is spoken at home by only one in 10 people – most of them not white.\n\nSouth Africa’s constitution recognises 11 official languages: Sepedi (also known as Sesotho sa Leboa), Sesotho, Setswana, siSwati, Tshivenda, Xitsonga, Afrikaans, English, isiNdebele, isiXhosa and isiZulu.\n\nFor centuries South Africa’s official languages were European – Dutch, English, Afrikaans. African languages, spoken by at least 80% of the people, were ignored. In 1996 South Africa’s new constitution gave official protection to all of the country’s major languages.\n\nSouth Africa has about 34 historically established languages. Thirty are living languages, and four extinct Khoesan languages.\n\nJump to:\n\nOverview of South Africa’s languages\n\nIsiZulu is South Africa’s biggest language, spoken by almost a quarter (23%) of the population. Our other official languages are isiXhosa (spoken by 16%), Afrikaans (13.5%), English (10%), Sesotho sa Leboa (9%), Setswana and Sesotho (both 8%), Xitsonga (4.5%), siSwati and Tshivenda (both 2.5%), and isiNdebele (2%).\n\nEnglish is an urban language of public life, widely used in the media, business and government. Out of the 4.9-million South Africans who speak English as a first language, a third (33%) are white, a quarter (24%) are black, 22% are Indian and 19% are coloured South Africans. English is widely used as a second language and common language of communication, mainly in the cities.\n\nAfrikaans is a version of Dutch that evolved out of a South Holland dialect brought here in the 1600s. Over the centuries it has picked up many influences from African languages, as well as from European colonial languages such as English, French and German. More than half (50.2%) of Afrikaans speakers are coloured, 40% are white, 9% black and just 1% Indian.\n\nSouth Africa’s nine African official languages all fall into the Southern Bantu-Makua subfamily, part of the broad and branching Niger-Congo family of languages. The languages arrived here during the great expansion of Bantu-speaking people from West Africa eastwards and southwards into the rest of the continent. The expansion began in around 3000 BCE and was largely complete by 1000 CE.\n\nLike all languages in the Niger-Congo family they are tonal languages, in which either a high or low tone gives a word a different meaning.\n\nThe nine African languages can be broadly divided in two:\n\nNguni-Tsonga languages: isiNdebele, isiXhosa, isiZulu, siSwati, Xitsonga\n\nSotho-Makua-Venda languages: Sesotho, Sesotho sa Leboa, Setswana, Tshivenda\n\nWithin the first group Xitsonga alone falls into the Tswa-Ronga subfamily, while isiZulu, isiXhosa, isNdebele and siSwati are Nguni languages.\n\nSimilarly, Sesotho, Sesotho sa Leboa and Setswana are closely related Sotho languages, and Tshivenda something of a standalone in the Sotho-Makua-Venda subfamily.\n\nMultilingual South Africa\n\nSouth Africans are more than bilingual. A rough estimate based on Census 2001 first-language data and a 2002 study of second-languages speakers is that the average South African – man, woman and child – uses 2.84 languages. Obviously, many people are limited to one, and many others able to speak three, four or more languages.\n\nEnglish- and Afrikaans-speaking people (mostly coloured, Indian and white South Africans) tend not to have much ability in African languages, but are fairly fluent in each other’s language. Multilingualism is common among black South Africans.\n\nFor this reason, South African censuses ask people which two languages they speak. The question in the 2011 Census was:\n\nWhich two languages does (member of household) speak most often in this household?\n\nThirteen options were given: South Africa’s 11 official languages, plus Sign Language, and “Other”. If a person did not speak a second language, that too was recorded.\n\nThe contrast between first language and second language is shown in the maps at right. While the geographical pattern of dominant first languages neatly conforms to the facts of history and urbanisation, the picture of second languages is more complicated, more of a mess.\n\nThe second map reveals a couple of things. The first is how few South Africans speak just one language. The second is that while English is the dominant first language only in the cities – Johannesburg, Cape Town, Durban – it is widely used as a second language across the country. English is spread by the media and used as a common language of communication.\n\nBut many South Africans are compelled to learn English, and often Afrikaans as well, simply to get a job and to work. These are often poorer people denied an adequate education. Elsewhere in the world the ability to speak many languages is a sign of sophistication. In South Africa, multilingualism – a complex undertaking, especially in languages from very different families – is a common achievement of the poor.\n\nCode-switching South Africa\n\nLanguage is fluid, especially in South Africa. Our languages are and have been for centuries in a constant swirl, mixed by work, migration, education, urbanisation, the places we live, friendship and marriage.\n\nBecause of this, South Africans are a code-switching people. “Code switching” simply means using more than one language in a single conversation. Every adult South African does this at some time, even if they aren’t aware of it.\n\nHere’s an example overheard at a football match. IsiZulu is in regular type, Afrikaans in bold and English in italics:\n\n“I-Chiefs isidle nge-referee’s ngabe ihambe sleg.\n\nMaar why benga stopi this system ye-injury time?”\n\nA rough translation:\n\n“Chiefs [the football club] have won because the referee favoured them. Otherwise, they would have lost.\n\nBut why is this system of injury time not stopped?”\n\nInfluenced by the other languages spoken around them, all of South Africa’s languages change and grow all the time.\n\nWho speaks what?\n\nWatch:\n\nSouth Africa’s most recent census was in 2011. The following table gives a breakdown of first-language speakers, as recorded by the census.\n\nSouth Africa’s 11 official languages\n\nLanguage Subfamily 1st language share 1st language users 2nd language users All users Afrikaans Low Franconian 13.5% 6.9 million 10.3 million 17.2 million English West Germanic 9.6% 4.9 million 11.0 million 15.9 million isiNdebele Nguni 2.1% 1.1 million 1.4 million 2.5 million isiXhosa Nguni 16% 8.1 million 11.0 million 19.1 million isiZulu Nguni 22.7% 11.6 million 15.7 million 27.3 million Sesotho Sotho-Tswana 7.6% 3.8 million 7.9 million 11.8 million Sesotho sa Leboa (Sepedi) Sotho-Tswana 9.1% 4.6 million 9.1 million 13.8 million Setswana Sotho-Tswana 8% 4.1 million 7.7 million 11.8 million siSwati Nguni 2.5% 1.3 million 2.4 million 3.7 million Tshivenda Sotho-Makua-Venda 2.4% 1.2 million 1.7 million 2.9 million Xitsonga Tswa-Ronga 4.5% 2.3 million 3.4-million 5.7 million Source: Constitution Source: Glottolog Source: Census 2011 Source: Census 2011 Source: Webb 2002 Estimate\n\nThe languages of the provinces\n\nThe languages you hear in South Africa depend on where you are in the country.\n\nIn the Eastern Cape isiXhosa is spoken by 80% of the population. IsiZulu is the largest language in both KwaZulu-Natal, where 78% speak it, and Gauteng, where it makes up 20% of languages. Sesotho is the language of the Free State, spoken by 64% people there. And so on …\n\nWatch:\n\nThe main languages of each province are:\n\nEastern Cape – isiXhosa (78.8%), Afrikaans (10.6%)\n\nFree State – Sesotho (64.2%), Afrikaans (12.7%)\n\nGauteng – isiZulu (19.8%), English (13.3%), Afrikaans (12.4%), Sesotho (11.6%)\n\nKwaZulu-Natal – isiZulu (77.8%), English (13.2%)\n\nLimpopo – Sesotho sa Leboa (52.9%), Xitsonga (17%), Tshivenda (16.7%)\n\nMpumalanga – siSwati (27.7%), isiZulu (24.1%), Xitsonga (10.4%), isiNdebele (10.1%)\n\nNorthern Cape – Afrikaans (53.8%), Setswana (33.1%)\n\nNorth West – Setswana (63.4%), Afrikaans (9%)\n\nWestern Cape – Afrikaans (49.7%), isiXhosa (24.7%), English (20.3%)\n\nThe languages\n\nUnless otherwise indicated, all figures below are from Census 2011 and refer only to first language – the language spoken at home.\n\nAfrikaans\n\nAlso known as: isiBhuru (isiNdebele), isiBhulu (isiXhosa), isiBhunu (isiZulu), siBhunu (siSwati), Seburu (Sesotho sa Leboa), Xibunu (Xitsonga)\n\nFirst-language users: 6,855,082 (13.5% of South Africans)\n\nSecond-language users: 10,300,000 (2002 estimate)\n\nAll users: 17,155,082 (estimate)\n\nAfrikaans evolved out of a 17th-century Dutch dialect introduced to South Africa in 1652 when the Dutch first colonised the Cape of Good Hope. Today it is the majority language of the Northern Cape.\n\nAfrikaans became an official language in South Africa with the Official Languages of the Union Act of 1925, which retroactively dated the language’s official status to 1910.\n\nThe 6,855,082 South Africans who speak Afrikaans as a first language make up 13.5% of the country’s total population. More than half (50.2%) of these Afrikaans speakers are coloured, 39.5% white, 8.8% black, 0.9% Indian or Asian, and 0.6% other.\n\nMore than three-quarters (75.8%) of coloured South Africans speak Afrikaans, as do almost two-thirds (60.8%) of whites. It is the home language of 4.6% of Indian or Asian people, and of 1.5% of black South Africans.\n\nAfrikaans and South Africa’s population groups\n\nBlack Coloured Indian or Asian White Other All Total population 41,000,938 4,615,401 1,286,930 4,586,838 280,454 51,770,560 Afrikaans speakers 602,166 3,442,164 58,700 2,710,461 41,591 6,855,082 Share of population 1.5% 75.8% 4.6% 60.8% 15.2% 13.5%\n\nMost Afrikaans speakers (41%) live in the Western Cape, and 21% in Gauteng. Ten percent of all Afrikaans speakers live in the Eastern Cape, 8.8% in the Northern Cape, and 5% in the Free State.\n\nWithin the provinces, Afrikaans is the majority language in the Northern Cape (53.8%) and the Western Cape (49.7%). It makes up 12.7% of languages spoken in the Free State, 12.4% of Gauteng’s languages, 10.6% of languages in the Eastern Cape, 9% in North West, 7.2% in Mpumalanga, 2.6% in Limpopo and 1.6% in KwaZulu-Natal.\n\nEnglish\n\nAlso known as: Engels (Afrikaans), isiNgisi (isiNdebele and isiZulu), isiNgesi (isiXhosa), Senyesemane (Sesotho), Seisemane (Sesotho sa Leboa), siNgisi (siSwati), Xinghezi (Xitsonga)\n\nFirst-language users: 4,892,623 (9.6% of South Africans)\n\nSecond-language users: 11,000,000 (2002 estimate)\n\nAll users: 15,892,623 (estimate)\n\nEnglish is a prominent language in South African public life, widely used in government, business and the media. As a first language it is mainly confined to the cities.\n\nIn 1910 English and Dutch were declared the official languages of the new Union of South Africa.
