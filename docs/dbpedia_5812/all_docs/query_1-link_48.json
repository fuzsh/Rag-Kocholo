        "text": "Origins and History:\n\nXhosa is classified as a Bantu language and traces its roots back to the early Bantu speakers who settled in southern Africa around 1000 CE. Over time, Xhosa evolved into its own distinct language, absorbing influences from the Khoisan people and, later, European colonisers.\n\nThe language is rich in ‘click’ consonants, a feature Xhosa shares with other languages of the Bantu family, which it inherited from interactions with the Khoisan-speaking populations. These click sounds are distinctive and are symbolised by the letters C, Q and X in the written language.\n\nNumber of Speakers and Where it is an Official Language Status:\n\nAs of 2023, Xhosa is spoken by over 8 million people, making it one of the most commonly spoken languages in South Africa.\n\nIt is an official language of South Africa, one of the eleven official languages recognised by the South African constitution.\n\nUsage:\n\nXhosa is predominantly used in South Africa’s Eastern and Western Cape provinces. In these regions, it’s used in everyday conversation, media, education, and various government and business proceedings.\n\nXhosa is taught in schools in South Africa, especially in areas where Xhosa is the dominant language. It’s also available as a course in several universities globally.\n\nIn the digital sphere, efforts are underway to integrate Xhosa into language learning apps and machine learning models to aid translation and transcription services.\n\nEnglish Words Used in Xhosa:\n\nDue to the influence of English, certain English words have been incorporated into Xhosa. These often relate to modern technology or institutions, for example: Ikompyutha’ (Computer) and Isikolo’ (School)\n\nHere’s an example of a Xhosa text:\n\n“Enkosi kakhulu” translates to “Thank you very much” in English.\n\nXhosa Words Absorbed into English:\n\nSome Xhosa words have found their way into English, mainly in South Africa, although a few have gained international recognition:\n\n‘Ubuntu’: a philosophy that encapsulates the belief in a universal bond of sharing that connects all humanity. It’s been widely discussed, particularly in the context of South African society and reconciliation.\n\n‘Indaba’: a conference or consultation used in South Africa in the context of a meeting or a conference.\n\nXhosa and Zulu speakers can generally understand each other when speaking in their mother tongues.\n\nAlthough not the most widely spoken language of South Africa, Xhosa speakers are among the most widely distributed. Like many languages, Xhosa has taken some words from English. Xhosa speakers also use Afrikaans words.\n\nXhosa is a rich, vibrant language with a long history and an integral role in South African society. Its distinctive clicks and unique vocabulary make it an intriguing subject for linguists and language learners."
