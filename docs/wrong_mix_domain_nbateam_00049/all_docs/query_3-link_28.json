        "text": "MIAMI – Udonis Haslem is the definition of “Heat Culture” and 21 years later, he will now join only four other players in franchise history to have his jersey number retired.\n\nThe Miami Heat announced Friday that Haslem will receive one of the top honors in team history when his No. 40 jersey is retired on Jan. 19 when the Heat play the Atlanta Hawks at the Kaseya Center.\n\nHaslem, who joined the Heat in 2003 as an undrafted free agent, never figured he would win three NBA championships and go down as one of the most beloved players in franchise history.\n\nHaslem joins an impressive list of Heat players with their jersey retired. It includes Dwyane Wade, Alonzo Mourning, Shaquille O’Neal, Tim Hardaway and Chris Bosh.\n\nHaslem retired last season after spending his entire 20-year NBA career with the HEAT, accumulating three NBA Championships, seven Eastern Conference Championships, 12 Divisional Titles, 16 postseason appearances, having never missed the playoffs in consecutive seasons, and was an NBA All-Rookie Second Team selection.\n\nHe is one of only three players in NBA history to play at least 20 years with one franchise, joining only Kobe Bryant and Dirk Nowitzki.\n\nHaslem finished his career as a 16-time captain for the Heat, the most in team history, and finished as the franchise’s all-time leader in offensive, defensive and total rebounds, becoming the only undrafted player in NBA history to become their team’s all-time rebound leader, according to NBA.com.\n\nHaslem, a Miami native, recently returned to his beloved franchise as the team’s Vice President of Basketball Development where his responsibilities include being a resource to the coaching staff, mentoring both HEAT and Skyforce players as well as representing the organization in the community and in business endeavors.\n\nWhen Haslem retired, he left the fans, organization and former teammates a heartfelt message on his Instagram page:\n\nHeat President Pat Riley shared his love and respect for Haslem in a statement on Friday.\n\n“It’s about a great legacy, a Thank You moment that has been earned over 20 years of being an incredible championship player and most importantly, the best leader,” said Riley. “He’s going to have his day and I can’t wait to see his jersey hang in the rafters.”\n\nMiami Heat fans are encouraged to leave their favorite “UD” moment in the comment section below."
