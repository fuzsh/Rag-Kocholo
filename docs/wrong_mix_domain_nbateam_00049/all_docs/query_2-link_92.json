        "text": "The Bucks tied their series with the Hawks last night, thanks in a large part to Delfino’s hot (and unexpected) outside shooting. Form the Journal Sentinel: “The 6-foot-6 forward busted out in a big way, sinking 6 of 8 three-pointers and leading the Milwaukee Bucks to a 111-104 victory over the Hawks before another rowdy sellout audience of 18,717. The Bucks evened the series at 2-2 entering Game 5 in Atlanta, scheduled at 7 p.m. Wednesday. Point guard Brandon Jennings continued his strong play in the series with 23 points, six assists and four rebounds, while Delfino finished with 22 points and guard John Salmons also had 22 in a balanced Bucks attack. ‘When you hit your first shot, your whole confidence changes,’ Delfino said. ‘Fortunately I helped the team in a big way, and it feels great to tie up the series.’ Jennings kept attacking the rim and was able to get past the Hawks’ big men for layups or into position to hit cutting teammates for baskets. ‘Sometimes the layups are there and sometimes they’re not,’ Jennings said. ‘I hit Luc (Richard) Mbah a Moute on a couple nice passes there, and it just opens up the game for us. But when Delfino plays like that, we’re a team that’s hard to stop. He set the tone tonight for us.’ Delfino sank 3 three-pointers in the first quarter as the Bucks grabbed an early lead. Then late in the game he hit a pivotal three-pointer in the corner off a drop pass from Jennings, giving the Bucks a 97-88 lead with 3:57 remaining.”"
