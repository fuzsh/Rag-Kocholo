        "text": "Christopher tallied 24 points (9-17 FG, 6-10 3Pt), four rebounds, one assist, three steals and two blocks in 31 minutes during Monday's Summer League Championship Game against the Grizzlies.\n\nChristopher was named the 2024 NBA Summer League Finals MVP following his stellar showing from beyond the arc. He led the Heat with 24 points and showed up on the defensive end to help secure a 120-118 overtime victory. The 22-year-old guard was waived by the Jazz in January and will now look to sign an NBA deal following his solid play in Summer League.\n\nWare tallied 21 points (8-10 FG, 0-1 3Pt, 5-6 FT), 10 rebounds and one block over 32 minutes during Monday's Summer League Championship Game against the Grizzlies.\n\nWare, who was named to the NBA 2K25 All-Summer League First Team earlier in the day, put together yet another strong performance to finish out Summer League play. He secured a double-double with his strong rebounding effort and scored efficiently, knocking down 80.0 percent of his tries from the field in an overtime thriller.\n\nJohnson (ankle) won't play in Monday's Summer League Championship Game against the Grizzlies, Ira Winderman of the South Florida Sun Sentinel reports.\n\nJohnson went down with an ankle injury during Thursday's matchup against Dallas, and the team won't rush him back for an exhibition. He shouldn't have any issue returning to full strength in time for the 2024-25 regular season.\n\nJovic (ankle) posted 10 points (3-7 FG, 1-3 3Pt, 3-3 FT) and four rebounds in 11 minutes during Serbia's 94-72 exhibition win over Greece on Monday.\n\nJovic sprained his ankle in mid-June, and there were conflicting reports about his availability ahead of the Paris Olympics. It looks like the 21-year-old forward is still working his way back to full strength, evidenced by playing only 11 minutes versus Greece, but he has appeared in back-to-back exhibitions. Jovic should be available for Serbia's showdown against Team USA on July 28, the first game of the Olympics for both squads.\n\nLarsson logged 21 points (6-13 FG, 2-3 3Pt, 7-7 FT), six assists, four rebounds and four steals during Sunday's 102-99 win over the Warriors in the Summer League semifinals.\n\nLarsson was excellent on both ends of the floor, finishing as one of two Heat players to top 20 points while pacing Miami in steals. The No. 44 overall pick in the 2024 NBA Draft, Larsson characterizes as a three-and-D wing and should compete with Duncan Robinson, Josh Richardson and Alec Burks for minutes off the bench during the regular season.\n\nJohnson (sprained ankle) won't play in Sunday's Summer League game against the Warriors, Anthony Chiang of the Miami Herald reports.\n\nJohnson suffered the injury during Thursday's matchup with the Mavericks and will be sidelined for a second consecutive game. If the Heat win Sunday, Johnson will have a chance to suit up for the Summer League Championship game Monday.\n\nThe Heat announced Saturday that Jovic (ankle) is progressing in his rehab, and there is still a possibility he will be able to play in the 2024 Paris Olympics for Serbia, Ira Winderman of the South Florida Sun Sentinel reports.\n\nJovic suffered an ankle injury in June during an offseason workout. While initial reports stated that the 21-year-old big man was likely to miss the Olympics, he remains listed on Serbia's roster.\n\nChristopher recorded 23 points (8-11 FG, 6-8 3Pt, 1-1 FT), three rebounds, two assists and one steal across 21 minutes during Monday's 102-73 Summer League win over the Thunder.\n\nChristopher did the majority of his damage from beyond the arc, drilling six of eight tries to account for 18 of his 23 points. He easily paced the bench in scoring and did so in limited minutes. Christopher should have another opportunity to showcase his scoring ability Wednesday against the Mavs.\n\nWare produced 17 points (7-9 FG, 1-2 3Pt, 2-4 FT), three rebounds, three assists and three blocks in 25 minutes during Saturday's 119-114 Summer League win over Boston.\n\nWare came into this outing with a ton of hype after averaging 19.0 points, 8.5 rebounds and 3.0 blocks per game in his previous two Summer League outings. His path to fantasy value is obstructed by the presence of Bam Adebayo, but Ware has the potential to run away with the backup center role.\n\nJovic (ankle) didn't travel with the Serbian national team for Friday's preparatory game against France and is considered likely to sit out the 2024 Paris Olympics, EuroHoops.net reports.\n\nJovic suffered his injury in June but appears to still be dealing with a fracture of the ankle joint. While there is no indication that the 20-year-old forward will miss any of the NBA season, his absence will be a big blow to the Serbian national team's hopes in Paris.\n\nJohnson recorded 21 points (8-14 FG, 1-4 3P, 4-6 FT), eight rebounds, three assists and three blocks across 30 minutes in Wednesday's 80-76 win over the Lakers in the California Classic.\n\nJohnson showed why the Heat signed the undrafted free agent out of Arizona to a two-way contract this offseason, tying for the team high in points while making his presence felt on the defensive end. Johnson will continue to see Summer League action with the Heat in Las Vegas.\n\nJaquez will be part of the Heat's Summer League team in Las Vegas and is expected to play in the team's first two games, Ira Winderman of the South Florida Sun Sentinel reports.\n\nJacquez was named to the USA Select Team and has been in Las Vegas for the Team USA training camp this week while Miami competes in the California Classic. He'll stick around in Vegas for the start of NBA 2K25 Summer League -- which kicks off Friday -- and play in at least two games. The 23-year-old appeared in 75 regular-season games as a rookie and averaged 11.9 points, 3.8 rebounds, 2.6 assists and 1.0 steals.\n\nRozier (neck) has been fully cleared to play this summer, Anthony Chiang of the Miami Herald reported Tuesday.\n\nRozier missed the final 11 games of 2023-24, including all five postseason games versus Boston, with a neck strain, but he'll have a full offseason with a clean bill of health to work on his game. Rozier made 31 appearances for the Heat last season, posting averages of 16.4 points, 4.6 assists, 4.2 rebounds, 1.0 steals and 2.1 three-pointers."
