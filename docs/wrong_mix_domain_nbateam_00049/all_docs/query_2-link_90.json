        "text": "HOUSTON (AP) â€” The Houston Rockets waived shooting guard Carlos Delfino and point guard Aaron Brooks, who both had team options for next season, to free up salary cap space.\n\nDelfino averaged 10.6 points and 3.3 rebounds in 67 games last season. It was his first year with the Rockets after spending three seasons with the Milwaukee Bucks.\n\nBrooks played in just seven games for Houston last season when the Rockets signed him after he was released by the Sacramento Kings. It was his second stint with the team after playing for Houston from 2007-2011.\n\nRockets general manager Daryl Morey tweeted Sunday to address the move, thanking both players for their time in Houston."
