        "text": "The Denver Nuggets are deeply dangerous — and dangerously deep. Tonight against Toronto, the Nuggets likely won’t have their starting point guard. Or shooting guard. Or backup shooting guard.\n\nYet the Nuggets are potent and unpredictable enough that recent history suggests someone will step in and have a big scoring night. In the past eight games, seven of which were wins, the Nuggets have had six different leading scorers.\n\n“This team is hard to guard. You can’t predict us,” said Nuggets point guard Ty Lawson, who is doubtful with a left ankle sprain. “You can’t game plan against that, like if you’re playing the Miami Heat. It’s hard to plan defenses against us.”\n\nAndre Miller, who led Denver (13-5) in scoring in the win at Philadelphia, likely will start at point guard for Lawson, who left Pepsi Center on Thursday after practice with a precautionary boot and a tub for soaking his left foot.\n\nAsked if he’d have to sit out for, say, a week, Lawson said, “No I don’t think so. I’m just going day by day to see how it feels. And it’s feeling better than (Wednesday).\n\n“We’re not missing a beat. Andre is a seasoned point guard, one of the best point guards out there.”\n\nShooting guard Arron Afflalo (groin) is doubtful, and his backup, Rudy Fernandez, is a game-time decision (right Achilles tendon strain). Coach George Karl, unafraid to get quirky with a lineup here and there, will have to get creative tonight against the Raptors (6-13). If Wednesday was any indication, he might go with Corey Brewer at shooting guard — Brewer started in the second half at Sacramento, alongside Miller, after Lawson was hurt in the first half.\n\nAsked about the bench, starting forward Danilo Gallinari said, “They’re always ready to play — and they bring a lot of energy.”\n\nSame for himself. Gallo has been scorching. He put up a dud game at Philadelphia last week (1-for-3 from the field), but since then he had scoring nights of 21, 37 and 23 at Sacramento (including 21 in the first half).\n\n“We see something in him,” Nuggets executive Masai Ujiri said Thursday, after Denver’s light practice. “He’s a player we wanted to lock up for the future. I think it’s a time where we want more stability, after going through quite a bit of uncertainty. We want these guys to grow and be confident with themselves. And having a contract helps.”\n\nGallinari agreed to a four-year contract extension Wednesday, good for more than $42 million.\n\nHe should benefit from the extended playing time of Miller, the pass-happy point guard who has 10 or more assists in four of the past five games.\n\n“He’s the master in our system, man,” Nuggets power forward Nene said. “That’s Andre Miller.”\n\nBenjamin Hochman: 303-954-1294 or bhochman@denverpost.com\n\nTORONTO AT DENVER\n\n7 p.m. today, ALT, 1510 AM\n\nSpotlight on Linas Kleiza: The former Nugget averages 7.4 points per game but scored 25 points in Wednesday’s win at Utah, including four 3-pointers. Kleiza had one of his best nights in the NBA against Denver last season, scoring 26 points (on 11-for-16 shooting) along with 12 rebounds in a game at Toronto. With Denver from 2005-09, L.K. averaged 8.3 points.\n\nNOTEBOOK\n\nRaptors: It appears Toronto will be without its top scorer tonight. Forward Andrea Bargnani (23.5) re-injured his calf in Wednesday’s win. The Raptors are 0-6 without him in the lineup and average nine fewer points per game. … The Nuggets are first in the NBA in scoring at 106.4 points per game. The Raptors are next to last with 87.5. … Deep down Toronto’s bench, one can find two old friends — former Nuggets Anthony Carter and Gary Forbes. … Prior to becoming the Nuggets’ primary basketball executive, Masai Ujiri was with Toronto as its assistant general manager of player personnel.\n\nNuggets: Denver is 6-2 at the Pepsi Center. Only five NBA teams have one loss at home — Oklahoma City, San Antonio, Portland, Indiana and Chicago. … The Nuggets have won nine of their past 10 home games against Toronto. Overall, the Nuggets have won 13 of their past 14 games against the Raptors. … Forbes Magazine listed its annual rankings of NBA teams, and the Nuggets are the 21st most-valuable, listed at $316 million. … It’s possible that forward DeMarre Carroll could be able to play tonight. He has missed much of the season with a left hamstring strain, but he’s listed as a game-time decision for tonight.\n\nBenjamin Hochman, The Denver Post"
