        "text": "Last September, we heard that Carlos Delfino was still aiming to make an NBA comeback, and while the veteran forward hasn’t caught on with an NBA club this season, he has signed a new professional contract. According to Emiliano Carchia of Sportando, Delfino will play in his native country of Argentina, signing with Boca Juniors for the rest of the season.\n\nA first-round pick in 2003, Delfino played eight seasons in the NBA with the Pistons, Raptors, Bucks, and Rockets, averaging 8.1 PPG and shooting 36.5% from downtown in 507 career regular-season games. He also made the playoffs with all four teams, appearing in 41 total postseason contests. However, a broken foot sidelined him for the 2013/14 season and he hasnât played in another NBA game since then.\n\nDelfino was healthy enough last summer to participate in the 2016 Olympics for Argentina, but his showing in those games in Brazil didn’t earn him another shot in the NBA. It will be interesting to see if a stint in Argentina catches the eye of any NBA scouts.\n\nThe veteran swingman’s game would translate well to the current style of play in the NBA — in his final season with the Rockets in 2012/13, Delfino launched a career-high 6.3 three-pointers per game, making 37.5% of them. Those numbers would fit right in with the ones being posted by many current Houston players. However, being away from the NBA for four years makes a return a long shot for Delfino."
