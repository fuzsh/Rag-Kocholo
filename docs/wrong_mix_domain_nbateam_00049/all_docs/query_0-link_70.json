        "text": "MIAMI &#151; The telephone connection was lousy, static drowning out Shaquille O\\'Neal\\'s voice. Still, the message came through clearly enough: He expects to win with the Miami Heat.The Heat and Lakers finalized one of the most landscape-altering trades in NBA history Wednesday, O\\'Neal going to Miami in exchange for Caron Butler, Lamar Odom, Brian Grant and a first-round draft pick.\"I wanted to go to another contender, and Miami is definitely another contender,\" O\\'Neal said. \"We\\'re just going to grow together.\"Grow? At 7-foot-1 and 340 pounds, O\\'Neal has long been the most formidable force in the game. Even in Los Angeles, a city of celebrities, he was a towering presence while leading the team to three NBA titles during his eight seasons there.\"It\\'s certainly a disappointing day in a lot of ways in Los Angeles. I can\\'t deny that,\" general manager Mitch Kupchak said. \"He\\'s had an impact in so many ways on the franchise and the city of Los Angeles.\"In stark contrast to the downcast mood in Los Angeles, which was fueled in part by lingering uncertainty over whether Kobe Bryant will also leave the Lakers, the sensation in Miami was diametrically different.\"We feel that we have traded for the best player in the NBA,\" Heat president Pat Riley said.The deal had been on the verge of completion since Saturday, when O\\'Neal met in Orlando with Riley. NBA attorneys approved it hours after the league\\'s two-week moratorium on player movement ended.O\\'Neal immediately transforms a franchise that has reached the conference finals only once in its 16-year history into a potential title contender. The Heat won one playoff series in the past four years and went 42-40 last season.\"I never imagined that we would acquire Shaquille O\\'Neal,\" guard Eddie Jones said. \"It\\'s once-in-a-lifetime trying to get a player like this guy. It\\'s an unbelievable, unbelievable move.\"At 32, O\\'Neal is coming off a season in which he averaged a career-low 21.5 points. He has missed 15 games each of the past three seasons with injuries, but he\\'s an 11-time All-Star with career averages of 27.1 points, 12.1 rebounds and 2.6 blocks moving to a conference where there\\'s a dearth of dominating centers.\"I\\'ve always said that wherever he is, that\\'s where the balance of power is,\" Indiana Pacers CEO Donnie Walsh said.<h4>NBA trades and signings</h4><strong>BOBCATS:</strong> Signed G Jason Hart and F Tamar Slay.<strong>BUCKS:</strong> Signed C Etan Thomas to a six-year offer sheet.<strong>CELTICS:</strong> Re-signed C Mark Blount to a six-year contract.<strong>CLIPPERS:</strong> Traded F-C Melvin Ely and G Eddie House to Charlotte for 2005 and 2006 second-round draft picks.<strong>GRIZZLIES:</strong> Signed F Brian Cardinal to a six-year contract.<strong>HAWKS:</strong> Signed C Jason Collier.<strong>JAZZ:</strong> Signed F Carlos Boozer and C Mehmet Okur to six-year offer sheets.
