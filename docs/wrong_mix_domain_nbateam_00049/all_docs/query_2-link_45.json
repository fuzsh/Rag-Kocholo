        "text": "Argentinian swingman Carlos Delfino hasn’t appeared in an NBA game in more than three years, but he hasn’t given up on the idea of making a comeback at some point. As relayed by HoopsHype (original story via Ole.com.ar), Delfino has expressed interest in returning to the court, and continues to work to make it happen.\n\n“From a personal standpoint, for sure I want return with an NBA team,” Delfino said. “Is it a long shot? Very long shot, but I believe in it and have been working towards that goal for a long time. And Iâm still doing it. If I have to get minutes somewhere else while waiting for that NBA option, so be it. Weâll see.”\n\nA first-round pick in 2003, Delfino played eight seasons in the NBA with the Pistons, Raptors, Bucks, and Rockets, averaging 8.1 PPG and shooting 36.5% from downtown in 507 career regular-season games. He also made the playoffs with all four teams, appearing in 41 total postseason contests. However, a broken foot sidelined him for the 2013/14 season and he hasn’t played in another NBA game since then, though he did participate in this year’s Olympics for Argentina.\n\nAt age 34, Delfino could still have a couple more years left in him as a bench player, but it seems unlikely that an NBA team will take a flier on him anytime soon, given his lengthy absence from the game. He would likely have a more realistic chance of finding a job with a club overseas."
