        "text": "The start for the Thunder in Summer League action wasn't all that bad.\n\nNews 9's Thunder Reporter Steve McGehee was in Las Vegas with the team for their game against the Miami Heat.\n\nOKC lost 102-73.\n\nThe best player on the floor in this matchup was Miami second-year player Jaime Hawkins Jr. Scoring 23 points in 25 minutes of work.\n\nFor Oklahoma City, first-round pick Dillon Jones was not the best on offense and missed all six three-point attempts. He wound up with 11 points. Second-round pick Ajay Mitchell looked the best leading the summer thunder with 23 points.\n\n\"I think just being aggressive. Obviously second quarter was a little rough, but staying aggressive. The whole game was really important for me, and nothing defensively was pretty good. could have done better but it was pretty good to Africa was there so it was good,\" said Mitchell.\n\nIf past history follows suit here in Las Vegas, chances are Mitchell and Jones are done for summer league play. We'll see about Keyontae Johnson.\n\nOklahoma City has two games left on Wednesday and Friday before they put a bow on the summer league schedule in Utah and Nevada."
