        "text": "The Houston Rockets couldn't afford to keep Carlos Delfino, but the Milwaukee Bucks will take him happily.\n\nThe sharpshooting swingman agreed to a three-year contract worth $3.25 million per year, a person with direct knowledge of the deal told USA TODAY Sports' Jeff Zillgitt. The person requested anonymity because NBA free agent contracts cannot be signed until July 10. The third year of the deal is not guaranteed.\n\nDelfino is coming off arguably the best season of his career, as he averaged 10.6 points and 3.3 rebounds in 25.2 minutes a game for the Rockets. He made 37.5% of his career-high 421 three-pointers.\n\nHouston cut Delfino to make salary cap room in a successful pursuit of Dwight Howard. But he often played crunch-time minutes for the Rockets, capable of filling in at both wing positions.\n\nDelfino spent three years in Milwaukee before last season, so he has familiarity for the team, which has undergone a major backcourt makeover this offseason. O.J. Mayo also was signed, and Mike Dunleavy has joined the Chicago Bulls. It's unlikely the Bucks will re-sign guard Monta Ellis. Restricted free agent Brandon Jennings' future remains uncertain."
