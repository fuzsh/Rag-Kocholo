        "text": "Breaking News\n\nLeBron James scored 30 points, Dwyane Wade added 26 and the Miami Heat beat Washington 105-94 on Monday night, keeping the Wizards winless away from home this season.\n\nJames had 20 of his points in the first half, Wade added 15 in the third quarter. It’s the fifth time this season the Wizards have lost by double digits.\n\nAnd for Heat coach Erik Spoelstra, it was a milestone, his 100th regular-season victory, coming in career game No. 182.\n\nThe Wizards were without No. 1 draft pick John Wall, who missed his second straight game with a bruised right knee, and went largely with a seven-man rotation for much of the night. Washington was also again without Al Thornton (ankle) and Yi Jianlian (knee).\n\nJames called his shoulder-bump of coach Erik Spoelstra during the Dallas game Saturday night “incidental contact,” after the Heat superstar and third-year coach met for about 30 minutes before the game against the Wizards. Speculation was rampant that the bump was a sign of disrespect, but Spoelstra said he didn’t view it that way, and James insisted Monday that there was nothing untoward going on at that moment.\n\nJazz 109, Bucks 88: Al Jefferson had 22 points, 11 rebounds and four blocked shots to lead host Utah over injury-depleted Milwaukee. The Bucks were without Andrew Bogut (back), Drew Gooden (foot) and Carlos Delfino (strained neck), three players who combined were averaging 35.6 points and 22.3 rebounds a game.\n\nMavericks 101, Rockets 91: Caron Butler scored 13 of his 19 points during a decisive third-quarter run, Dirk Nowitzki had 20 points and 10 rebounds, and Dallas stretched its winning streak to six games with a victory over Houston.\n\nThunder 95, Hornets 89: Russell Westbrook scored 12 of his 25 points during a decisive 14-0 run late in the fourth quarter and also had 11 assists as host Oklahoma City rallied to beat New Orleans. Kevin Durant hit four free throws down the stretch to seal the victory and finished with 26 points and 11 rebounds.\n\nBulls: Forward Carlos Boozer reported no problems after practicing with the team for the first time since breaking his right hand in an accident at his home on Oct. 2. Despite the successful outing, coach Tom Thibodeau wasn’t ready to make a decision on whether Boozer would play Wednesday against Orlando.\n\nCeltics: Coach Doc Rivers said center Shaquille O’Neal missed Boston’s practice on Monday because the veteran center forgot the time it was scheduled to start, adding that O’Neal “owes us one. We’re good.”"
