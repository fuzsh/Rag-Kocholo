        "text": "1. Lyrics Born: Real People (Mobile Home)\n\nTokyo-born rapper Tsutomu (\"Tom\") Shimura, came up through the Berkeley underground in the duo Latyrx and a handful of his own albums. This one rocks out on the title cut, then busts several of the hottest raps I've heard this year. Catchiest too. 2. Sleaford Mods: Key Markets (Harbinger Sound)\n\nBrit post-punks play minimal beats that are to hip-hop as punk is to Springsteen, only less frenzied because Jason Williamson wants his raps to be heard and understood. He has what my mother would have described as \"a mouth on him.\" 3. Blackalicious: Imani, Vol. 1 (OGM)\n\nHip-hop group from the Bay Area (actually Sacramento), first album in 10 years and now projected to come out in three volumes. Like fellow traveler Lyrics Born's first in five years, their comeback leaps over and often stomps on the the state of the art, which has gone pretty slack. 4. James McMurtry: Complicated Game (Complicated Game)\n\nSon of a famous novelist, slowly establishing himself as a serious storyteller in his own right. Nothing here has the instant political cred or (more importantly) musical punch of \"We Can't Make It Here\" (from Childish Things) or \"Cheney's Toy\" (from Just Us Kids) but he's smart enough not to blame his hard luck songs on Obama. Several sneak up on you, especially the one about fishing out of season. 5. Laurie Anderson: Heart of a Dog (Nonesuch)\n\nChristgau pegs this as her best ever, a comparison which bumps up against United States Live and Home of the Brave and Strange Angels, just to pick two albums I have at full A and a third at A+. Compared to them (especially the latter) this strikes me as short on music -- most is spoken word over some very minimally ambient electronics. Still, fascinating wordplay, on death and love and spying and a fox terrier, ending with a bit of the late Lou Reed, unplugged. 6. Courtney Barnett: Sometimes I Sit and Think, and Sometimes I Just Sit (Mom + Pop Music)\n\nAustralian singer-songwriter, got some attention last year when she combined two EPs into a debut calling card, but initially struck me as a folkie troubadour, a wordy one at that. This has a wordy title too, but the first thing you notice is the guitar. 7. Paris: Pistol Politics (2015, Guerrilla Funk, 2CD)\n\nOscar Jackson Jr., rapper from San Francisco, dropped his first album in 1990 and has always worn politics on his sleeve. I should make a point of checking out his early albums when he had major label deals, but the first I heard was 2003's Sonic Jihad on his own label, then even better his \"featuring\" role on Public Enemy's Rebirth of a Nation (2006). This is his first album in six years, and he's got a lot to talk about, with a natural flow meant to make his words clear, and perfunctory beats to keep it moving. 8. Heems: Eat Pray Thug (Megaforce)\n\nHimanshu Suri, born and raised in Flushing, Queens, New York -- all-American, as shocked as any of us by 9/11, yet when the kneejerk reaction set in he's out buying American flags not because his knee is jerking but as camouflage, for his name and less-assimilated Punjabi family. That story appears often enough here to amount to a theme, at one point breaking out in a chant of \"USA\" that I could do without. \"Suicide by cop\" is another line repeated too often. At points the rawness becomes unpleasant. On the other hand, it's all remarkably different and humane. 9. Jeffrey Lewis & Los Bolts: Manhattan (Rough Trade)\n\nComic book artist, folksinger too, although a dozen albums in he rocks harder, still crams a lot of words in, with more than a few in Yiddish. [**] 10. Kendrick Lamar: To Pimp a Butterfly (Top Dawg/Aftermath/Interscope)\n\nLos Angeles (or should I say Compton?) rapper spins another long (75:17) album, the uneasy path of another good kid in the mad city. Pumped up early on with rejuvenated P-Funk, fades out at the end with what seems like an interview. More here than I'll ever manage to sort out. 11. Ezra Furman: Perpetual Motion People (Bella Union)\n\nA singer-songwriter who's able to accent his writerly preoccupations -- whatever they may be, one line being \"lose yourself completely, but stay alive\" -- by reviving ancient rock archetypes, some doo-wop here, some glam rock there, some honking sax. [**] 12. Daveed Diggs: Small Things to a Giant (Deathbomb Arc)\n\nRapper from Oakland, came up in the underground group Clipping; first album on his own, a real tour de force, smart and snappy with rapidfire raps, the speed and dexterity which won him a Grammy for the roles of Thomas Jefferson and Marquis de Lafayette in Hamilton, but even more impressive as himself. [**] 13. Low Cut Connie: Hi Honey (Ardent Music/Contender)\n\nFrom Philadelphia, third album, AMG classifies them as \"retro-rock\" but I don't see them as going back so much as plundering the past with postmodernist glee. Basically a guitar band until you notice the Jerry Lee piano -- where most groups are advised to find their own distinct sound, this one revels in all of them. [**] 14. Gwenno: Y Dydd Olaf (Heavenly)\n\nGwenno Saunders, from Wales, first solo album after the demise of her girl group, the Pipettes. Father was a noted Cornish poet and she grew up speaking Welsh and Cornish, so title and lyrics are probably in one or the other. But the incomprehensible words are enveloped in down right gorgeous synths, and the flow is impeccable. Album was first released on Peski Records, but her new label couldn't resist. [**] 15. Craig Finn: Faith in the Future (2015, Partisan)\n\nThe unmistakable singer/songwriter behind two of the better rock groups of the last two decades -- Lifter Puller and Hold Steady -- files his second album under his own name. The music is lighter, a bit less compelling, but that just lets the songs come through clearer. He's good enough to do that. [**] 16. Ashley Monroe: The Blade (Warner Music)\n\nCountry singer-songwriter, one-third of Pistol Annies, had an album before she started hanging out with the other thirds, then a breakthrough last year -- admittedly, it felt small, almost too easy. This one is less consistent, but takes more risks, and they often pay off. [**] 17. New Order: Music Complete (Mute)\n\nFirst real album in a decade -- seems to be a lot of that going on recently -- the lapse taking one casualty: bassist Peter Hook is gone (but how hard is it to replace a bassist?), original keyboardist Gillian Gilbert has returned, and they've added some guests and strings, none of which makes much difference: long-term fans will instantly recognize the band, and newbies will be, well, amazed. [**] 18. Nozinja: Nozinja Lodge (Warp)\n\nAlias for Richard Hlungwani, a South African producer/performer who was most prominent on Honest Jon's 2010 compilation, Shangaan Electro: New Wave Dance Music From South Africa. Pitches this toward the worldwide electronic dance market, but the drums and vocal harmonies come out of Zulu traditions, as potent as ever. [**] 19. Carly Rae Jepsen: E-MO-TION (Interscope/Schoolboy/Silent)\n\nGave this another shot after it finished 3rd in P&J, the poll's big surprise although the album had gained steadily in my EOY Aggregate, moving up to 18th. Not as flamboyant as Grimes or as clever as Lily Allen, it takes some time to adjust to her ambivalence. Clearly I filed this too soon. [**] 20. The Yawpers: American Man (Bloodshot)\n\nAlt band from Colorado led by Nate Cook, who may thank God he's an American man but doesn't feel too blessed -- more like ashamed. Took a third play to get past the first two songs and see everything else fall into place. Reminds me of the Drive-By Truckers, minus the cornbread and molasses. [**] 21. Bassekou Kouyate & Ngoni Ba: Ba Power (Glitterbeat)\n\nNgoni player from Mali, his group featuring his wife, powerful singer Amy Sacko. Broke out a bit with 2013's Jama Ko, and this is comparably intense. [**] 22. Dr. Yen Lo: Days With Dr. Yen Lo (Pavlov Institute)\n\nRapper Ka and producer Preservation styled this concept album after the notorious Chinese doctor-hypnotist in The Manchurian Candidate, which also provides occasional snatches of dialog. The story strays but the music is hypnotic, with or without the monotone raps. 23. Ursula 1000: Voyeur (Insect Queen)\n\nEDM project of Alex Gimeno, a Brooklyn producer with nine albums plus EPs and singles and remixes since 1999, spanning glam rock and cha cha and exotica, though this one mostly pushes my disco buttons, the beats sometimes reminding me of DJ Shadow. Ends with a change of pace, a movie theme called \"The Shadow of Your Smile\" tarted up like in a James Bond film. [**] 24. Hieroglyphic Being & J.I.T.U. Ahn-Sahm-Buhl: We Are Not the First (RVNG Intl)\n\nChicago DJ Jamal Moss uses the former name (among others). As far as I can tell, the latter is the band (the initials stand for Journey Into The Unexpected) and the rest sort of resembles Ensemble. The musicians have more or less jazz cred -- saxophonist Marshall Allen has the most, and drummer Greg Fox (Liturgy, Zs) could sub anywhere he wants. Even without Allen, it's hard to hear this and not wonder what Sun Ra would sound like today if he'd really been born on Saturn. [**] 25. Boz Scaggs: A Fool to Care (429 Records)\n\nIn his 70s now, started out in blue-eyed soul occasionally descending into ordinary white pap, but as he's aged the logical progression is into blues, which he's taken at the same langourous pace he's always had. His Memphis was easily overrated, but this more unassuming effort hits the spot: a collage of covers that takes you back without tempting you to play your own oldies. [**] 26. Mdou Moctar: Akounak Tedalat Taha Tazoughai [Original Soundtrack Recording] (Sahel Sounds)\n\nEnglish title of the film is Rain the Color of Blue With a Little Red in It, about a Tuareg musician, which is exactly what Moctar is. None of the usual soundtrack pitfalls, just lots of guitar, some chant vocals, and that Saharan beat that's as accessible as the blues. [**] 27. Halsey: Badlands (Astralwerks)\n\nAshley Frangipane, b. 1994 in New Jersey, finds herself growing up on meaner streets than Springsteen imagined forty years ago, unable to afford college until she hustled some internet buzz into a contract and a hit record. Electropop, I wouldn't call it dark but it's far from frothy and I don't hear words well enough to dismiss the reputed anger and dismay. Actually, seems about right, given how the world is headed. [**] 28. ¡Mayday!: Future/Vintage (Strange Music)\n\nMiami hip-hop crew, had a record with Murs last year that I liked a lot (¡Mursday!) and produce the same underground vibe here without a domineering front man. [**] 29. The Mountain Goats: Beat the Champ (Merge)\n\nLooking back, comparing Robert Christgau's and my own grades for eight or so albums by John Darnielle's singer/songwriter vehicle, I see no real pattern: sometimes I'm up (The Sunset Tree, Heretic Pride), sometimes I'm down (All Eternals Deck, Transcendental Youth), and the splits seem arbitrary. So I can't tell you why I rate this one with the former two, above the latter two. Fact is I never follow lyrics closely enough to make fine distinctions. Also that Darnielle always sounds more coherent than whatever other singer/songwriters I'm listening to at the time. [**] 30. Peaceable Solutions: Barter 7 (self-released)\n\nKool A.D. (originally of Das Racist) and Kassa Overall (originally a jazz drummer), aka Kool & Kass, now dba the title of their first album together. The title is presumably a play on Young Thug's Barter 6, itself a play on the still-unreleased Tha Carter V. Obviously, \"the world's greatest rapper\" (these days \"the real one\") doesn't spend a lot of time on titles. Nor on rhymes, although he lands a few anyway, and the beats render even the groaners amusing. [**] 31. Bully: Feels Like (Startime International/Columbia)\n\nNashville group, as straightahead as '90s grunge, not just fronted but led by Alicia Bognanno, \"who earned a degree from Middle Tennessee State University in audio recording before getting an internship at Steve Albini's Electrical Audio studios in Chicago.\" Ten short songs, two with as many as two words in the title, but doesn't feel like she's slighting us. [**] 32. Tuxedo: Tuxedo (Stones Throw)\n\nRetro-disco group formed by Mayer Hawthorne (aka DJ Haircut) and Jake One. Seems like a logical progression from Hawthorne's 1960s Motown shtick, gaining traction with each play. [**] 33. Eszter Balint: Airless Midnight (Red Herring)\n\nBorn in Hungary, not sure when or when she came to the US, but she made her acting debut in 1984 (a Jim Jarmusch movie). She's recorded intermittently, this her third album since 1999. A remarkable set of songs. Also remarkable that no one noticed it until Christgau wrote it up. [**] 34. Asleep at the Wheel: Still the King: Celebrating the Music of Bob Wills and His Texas Playboys (Bismeaux)\n\nRay Benson's group has tried this several times before -- most successful was 1999's star-studded Ride With Bob, and the guest list is even longer (and younger) this time -- well, except for Willie, Merle, and missing link Leon Rausch. Some of my favorite music, enough so that everyone sounds great. Wish I had the whole package. [**] 35. 79rs Gang: Fire on the Bayou (Sinking City/Urban Unrest)\n\nBig Chief Romeo Bougere of the 9th Ward Hunters and Big Chief Jermaine Bossier of the 7th Ward Creole Hunters team up to form the Soixante Dix Neufleurs Bande, aka 79rs Gang. A throwback to the great New Orleans Indian bands of the 1970s, though the beats are sharper and tenser, the jungle denser, the struggle harder. [**] 36. Ray Wylie Hubbard: The Ruffian's Misfortune (Bordello)\n\nLong past his Cowboy Twinkies days, also retirement age, his songwriting has sharpened -- in one song he concludes he'd be \"better off with the blues\" than with a certain woman -- and the music has gotten tougher and harder. Cuts out the flab too, doing ten songs in 33:40. [**] 37. Beans on Toast: The Grand Scheme of Things (Xtra Mile)\n\nEnglish folk singer Jay McAllister, much like American folk singers in that he's low tech with simple songs marked by humor and humanity. At some point I should check out the back catalog -- most with the same cover design -- but this one starts with three memorable songs -- his craft (\"Folk Singer\"), his manifesto (\"The War on War\"), and more craft (\"Fuck You Nashville\"), then follows it up with three more memorable ones (\"Lizzy's Cooking\" is a favorite), or maybe eight. Inspirational lyrics abound, my favorite: \"I believe that everyone should just chill the fuck out.\" [**] 38. BadBadNotGood & Ghostface Killah: Sour Soul (Lex)\n\nCover isn't clear, but most sources credit the Canadian jazz trio (keyboards, bass guitar, drums) first, ahead of the much more famous rapper. I'll note that three (of twelve) cuts are short instrumentals. I've never been much impressed by BBNG but their tight, noir-ish flow makes this short (32:55) album work -- not that they would hold up half as well without the rhymes. [**] 39. Tinariwen: Live in Paris (Anti-)\n\nProbably the best known group from the vast expanses of the Sahara Desert, specifically from the Tuaregs of northern Mali, they have a half dozen records since 2002, most highly recommended, and this is one more. Features guest singer/drummer Lalla Badi, the \"grand dame of Tamashek culture.\" [**] 40. The Chills: Silver Bullets (Fire)\n\nNew Zealand group, had two great albums 1990-92, and not much since, with this their first studio album since 1996 (2013's Somewhere Beautiful was a live album). This gets the sound back, maybe even pumps it up a bit (maybe too much). [**] 41. The Ragpicker String Band: The Ragpicker String Band (Yellow Dog)\n\nIf this was a jazz album, I'd credit it to the three named musicians on the cover: Rich Del Grosso (mandolin), Mary Flower (guitar), and Martin Grosswendt (multi-instrumentalist, which makes him the fiddle player). All sing, one of the guys with credible blues chops, especially when reprising old classics, or bemoaning Google. [**] 42. The Mowgli's: Kids in Love (Republic)\n\nL.A. pop group, named after a dog named after a Kipling Jungle Book character, with a gratuitous apostrophe noted on Wikipedia as \"sic.\" Seven players, boy and girl lead singers and everyone joining in the crowd choruses. When I was growing up irony provided a refuge for art, but these days you're more likely to hear that irony is dead, so maybe it's time someone made something out of such earnestness. I might have hated them forty years ago -- indeed, I recall groups like them then -- but they're one of the few things that make me feel good about kids today. Wonder if they know Kipling's a notorious racist? I'm sure they'd be appalled. [**] 43. Laura Marling: Short Movie (Ribbon Music)\n\nBrit singer-songwriter, fifth album, has a folkie rep for framing her songs with guitar, but so did Dylan, and Ani DiFranco. I'm reluctant to put her at that level, but every album has something substantial and this has more than a few things. [**] 44. Radical Dads: Universal Coolers (Old Flame)\n\nAlt/indie band from Brooklyn, a trio with two very hot guitarists -- singer Lindsay Baker and her husband Chris Diken -- and a drummer from Clap Your Hands Say Yeah, Robbie Guerlin (evidently the other singer), enveloping smart songs with cyclonic sound. [**] 45. Omar Souleyman: Bahdeni Nami (Monkeytown)\n\nSyria's famed wedding singer, who \"transformed traditional dabke music into a hyperactive electronic stomp\" [Guardian]. With his home turf turned into a battleground between ISIS and the Kurds (and the US and/or Bashar Assad), he's turned west, picking up Kieran Hebden as a producer, who in turn decided to leave well enough alone. [**] 46. Murs: Have a Nice Day (Strange Music)\n\nUnderground rapper Nick Carter, ninth album since 1997, although lately he's been most impressive on side projects, like White Mandingos' The Ghetto Is Tryna Kill Me and ¡Mursday! (with ¡Mayday!). Rapid-fire raps run rings around the ups and downs of ghetto life, the usual topics but not the usual take. [**] 47. Mbongwana Star: From Kinshasa (World Circuit)\n\nFrom Congo, led by two musicians (Coco Ngambali, Theo Nsituruidi) from Staff Benda Bilili, at first seem to fall short of the classic soukous romps, but a ballad (of all things) convinced me they are for real, and they pick up the pace when Konono No. 1 drop in to resuscitate the beat, a bit of thumb piano that sweetens the guitar. [**] 48. Grimes: Art Angels (2015, 4AD)\n\nCanadian singer-songwriter Clare Boucher, music mostly synths with lots of upbeat pop hooks. Christgau and Tatum reviewed this within a day or two of each other and disagreed (A vs. B-). I played this almost two months ago, the week it came out (Nov. 6), and my one spin split the difference between their grades. Another spin tells me that I hear more of what Tatum describes (K-pop morphing into anime porn) than what Christgau claims (\"hyperfeminist individualism for a post-rock mindset\"), but find that nudging the grade up. [**] 49. Donnie Trumpet & the Social Experiment: Surf (self-released)\n\nThe leader is actually named Nico Segal, but does at least play trumpet. Still, this counts as a rap album for the vocalists, the main one being Chance the Rapper (although I suppose featured artists like Big Sean and Erykah Badu are better known). Underground, flows soulfully, grows on you. [**] 50. Protoje: Ancient Future (Indiggnation Collective/Overstand)\n\nA young reggae artist, gets something of the traditional sound with a more contemporary sheen. Interesting how something so basic still sounds so compelling. [**] 51. Have Moicy 2: The Hoodoo Bash ( Red Newt)\n\nIn 1976 Rounder Records advertised their \"dream come true: the Rounders on Rounder\": they were referring back to the Holy Modal Rounders, a primitivist and rather bent folk group with Peter Stampfel and Steve Weber (originally) that recorded a pair of 1964 classics, then got corrupted by the Fugs and others such that by 1976 they had become Unholy. They were the scratchy heart and soul of Have Moicy!, an album as dear to me as The Velvet Underground or Pet Sounds or A Love Supreme, but it wasn't just the irrascible Stampfel that made the album work. It was headlined by Michael Hurley, who never again wrote such sly and funny songs, and Jeffrey Fredericks & the Clamtones added cornball filler. But most of all, both sides were capped by Antonia songs, one prophesying: \"When we have kids, we will tell them the story/'Bout the night we got the spirit at the Hoodoo Bash.\" Now, Hurley's a recluse and Fredericks is dead, leaving Stampfel, with grandkids and protégés (but evidently no Antonia), to regale us with the glories of his youth -- except, of course, he can't quite pull it off. So instead of a three-headliner supergroup, we get an unsigned (\"various artists\") mish-mash, where the inspirational lyric comes from Robin Remailly: \"the songs are idiotic/and that's the point/just to lighten up the freakin' joint.\" Often enough they do. 52. Veruca Salt: Ghost Notes (El Camino)\n\nPostpunk band from the 1990s (only second album since), quartet fronted by singer-guitarists Nina Gordon and Louise Post, named after a character in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (\"a spoiled child who demands every single thing she wants\"). The closer \"Alternica\" gets a bit heavy-handed, but everything else is sharp and chipper. [**] 53. Shamir: Ratchet (XL)\n\nFirst name, last name Bailey, twenty years old, dropped an EP last year that lots of critics liked, returns with debut LP this year. Sings like a girl without overdoing it, beats are understated, the whole finish leans toward matte so nothing blows you away, but it's still sneaky catchy. [**] 54. Alaska Thunderfuck: Anus (Sidecar)\n\nAlias for drag queen Justin Honard, \"best known for appearing on the fifth season of RuPaul's Drag Race. Music is EDM, with he/she talk-singing through many tales of makeup and nails -- not to mention pussy, can't forget that. Not really my thing, but I'm more bemused than anything else. [**] 55. Downtown Boys: Full Communism (Don Giovanni)\n\nPunk band from Rhode Island, with two saxes and a female singer (Victoria Ruiz) skewing them a bit toward ska, promising \"leftist activist anthems you can pogo to,\" and delivering 12 in 25:46 (closing with a delirious cover of \"Dancing in the Dark\" -- cue Emma Goldman). [**] 56. Songhoy Blues: Music in Exile (Atlantic)\n\nThe group members fled war-torn north Mali for Bamako, and have kept on moving, finding a welcome for their desert blues/Saharan rock in the west. Produced by a guitarist in the Yeah Yeah Yeahs, this seems a bit slowed down and bulked up compared to their numerous competitors. On the other hand, that may make them a bit more accessible. [**] 57. Amy LaVere and Will Sexton: Hallelujah I'm a Dreamer (Archer)\n\nA country singer who prefers Memphis, and one of those singer-songwriter who having established her own career decided to give her husband some billing -- Amy Rigby, Kelly Chambers, and Kelly Willis are others (although the latter's mate is probably as well known). This was cut cheap, minimal arrangements, recycling some old songs which stand on their own. Still very much her album, although he sings one and does a nice job. [**] 58. Desaparecidos: Payola (Saddle Creek)\n\nConor Oberst side project, first album appeared in 2002, now this one 13 years later, but lineup seems to be the same, and they come on strong as a band -- in fact, given their political stance and how much they have to critique (or rant about), they come on as the closest any American band has come to the Clash. I'm alternately amused and agitated, which isn't a bad combination. Inspirational song title: \"Left Is Right.\" [**] 59. Giorgio Moroder: Deja-Vu (RCA)\n\nBest known as Donna Summer's producer (1975-80), Moroder lent his disco touch to dozens of artists in the early 1980s. His own albums start with a 1969 collection of bubble gum covers, proceed through disco versions of the Moody Blues and the soundtrack for Midnight Express, but end in 1985. He's done hack work since then (TV, video games), but this is his first album in 30 years. His disco shtick hasn't evolved much but still gleams -- at one point his disembodied voice tells us \"74 is the new 24,\" but he usually leaves the words to still young pop stars like Sia, Charli XCX, Kylie Minogue, Britney Spears, and Kelis. And he shows us that \"Tom's Diner\" gets even better with more remix. 60. John Moreland: High on Tulsa Heat (Old Omens)\n\nSinger-songwriter based in Tulsa, plays with a band but wouldn't lose much with just his guitar, his songs mostly slow, sober, reflective. Wish he had a sense of humor, but he's not unaware of irony, and he can straddle his right-wing Baptist father's world and reality. American Songwriter picked this as the record of the year. [**] 61. Leonard Cohen: Can't Forget: A Souvenir of the Grand Tour (Columbia)\n\nOuttakes from the tours that produced Live in Dublin, the more video-friendly sequel to the magnificent Live in London -- left out for their relative obscurity, but I'm such a sucker for his \"golden voice\" (and not-quite-angelic choir) I'm surprised I didn't fall for this when it came out. As I recall, the problem was technological. This is almost like discovering a fresh batch of unknown songs. [**] 62. Alan Jackson: Angels and Alcohol (Capitol Nashville)\n\nSixteen albums in, the neo-traditionalist sounds most like himself. If this seems easier than most of his albums, like he's aging comfortably, that's probably because he knows he's got a good bunch of songs. [**] 63. Robyn & La Bagatelle Magique: Love Is Free (Konichiwa/Cherrytree/Interscope, EP)\n\nThe Swedish pop-disco diva, keyboardist Markus Jägerstedt, and the late Christian Falk (1962-2014, best known as a producer). Four originals, an Arthur Russell cover, total 20:50. One terrific dance piece after another. Wish there were more. [**] 64. Battles: La Di Da Di (Warp)\n\nThird album for this trio, which sort of bridges the gap between alt-rock -- basically a guitar-bass-drums band -- and electronica (dabbling with keyboards, but mostly after the beats. This time they lost the vocals and doubled down on the beats. [**] 65. Willie Nelson/Merle Haggard: Django and Jimmie (Legacy)\n\nReinhardt and Rodgers on the tribute, adapted but not penned by the leaders, and not exactly proven here or elsewhere, though they're not the sort of fools not to be fans. Another tune written for them is \"It's All Going to Pot,\" which starts like a Haggard rant but winds up in Nelsonland. Haggard does claim four credits, including a \"Swinging Doors\" remake and a yarn about Johnny Cash, while Nelson shares four with Buddy Cannon, including a plug for \"Alice in Hulaland.\" The other cover you know is from Bob Dylan, but don't give it a second thought. [**] 66. Steve Hauschildt: Where All Is Fled (Kranky)\n\nFrom Cleveland, formerly of Emeralds, plays synths, aims for ambient and fails only in the sense that what he produces is too interesting and too catchy to just fade into the woodwork. [**] 67. Aesop Rock & Homeboy Sandman: Lice (Stones Throw, EP)\n\nTwo rappers usually strong enough on their own, double down for a 5-track (17:34) freebie which starts with head lice and ends with \"Get a Dog.\" Still, doesn't feel short. [**] 68. Max Richter: From Sleep (Deutsche Grammophon)\n\nGerman-born British \"post-minimalist\" composer, put together an 8-hour cycle called Sleep. This is a one-hour extract, a sampler if you like, short enough that it's not guaranteed to put you to sleep, although it will certainly calm and soothe. [**] 69. Future: DS2 (Epic)\n\nI caught so little of this the first time around I wound up writing as close to a nothing review as ever. Then it did respectably on subconscious beats, which get sharper with each play. And while I don't approve of his junkiedom, I find it more admirable, not to mention poignant, than the usual gangsta mack. [**] 70. Skylar Spence: Prom King (Carpark)\n\nAka Ryan DeRoberts, b. 1993 on Long Island, originally planned to perform as Saint Pepsi but the lawyers nixed that. Disco, in much the same sense as Mayer Hawthorne plays Motown, which these days is good enough for me. [**] 71. Erykah Badu: But You Caint Use My Phone (Control Freaq)\n\nFirst album in five years, not a huge gap by the standards of this year's great many long-term comebacks, but it rather seems like it -- maybe because styling this as a mixtape eases the re-entry. Repeated riffs on phones keep on coming, leading up to a cover of Todd Rundgren's \"Hello, It's Me\" featuring Andre 3000. [**] 72. Archy Marshall: A New Place 2 Drown (True Panther Sounds)\n\nBritish singer-songwriter, first appeared as Zoo Kid, then more notably as King Krule, matures into using his given name (or something close to it). Most resembles trip hop with its blunted beats and submerged colors, scant cover for vocals that seem determined to lurk rather than appear. Still, rather remarkable when you bother to pay attention, which isn't a given. [**] 73. Tribu Baharú: Pa'l Más Exigente Bailador (self-released)\n\nColombian afro-champeta, from the Caribbean coast (a champeta is a knife used by fishermen to descale fish), marked by sweet soukous guitar, upbeat percussion, and whoops and shouts with more affinity to zouk and soca than to salsa or cumbia. Some rough spots, but they muscle through them. [**] 74. John Kruth: The Drunken Wind of Life: The Poem/Songs of Tin Ujevic (Smiling Fez)\n\nUjevic (1891-1955) was a Croatian poet and essayist; he studied in Split, lived mostly in Belgrade (after some time in France) but died in Zagreb. Wikipedia tells us that \"in 2008, a total of 122 streets in Croatia were named after Ujevic, making him the ninth most common person for whom streets were named in Croatia.\" Nine (of thirteen) songs here are built around Ujevic lyrics, three others Kruth originals \"inspired by Ujevic and Croatia,\" plus a trad folk dance for local flavor. Actually, the music doesn't sound that Balkan, and the lyrics are all standard English translations, accorded the sort of veneration that comes naturally to folkies. [**] 75. Arca: Mutant (Mute)\n\nAlejandro Ghersi, born in Venezuela, raised in Brooklyn, second album plus a couple EPs. Many short pieces, doesn't settle neatly into a groove, restless I'd say, but more method than frenzy. [**] 76. Hieroglyphic Being: The Acid Documents (Soul Jazz)\n\nConsidered a reissue but only if you could a run of 100 CDRs available through one record store as a release. Even this is \"a one-off edition of 1000 copies on coloured double vinyl,\" but I doubt that the CD and digital variants are so constrained. The music is fairly minimal, pretty much all beats until a little synth noodle at the end. Not as interesting as his jazz record, but still pretty irresistible. [**] 77. Shopping: Why Choose (FatCat)\n\nSecond album, Christgau regards the two as \"pretty much interchangeable,\" and that's probably true, but this one struck me as a bit cleaner and clearer, and minus a minor stumble in the middle. [**] 78. Metric: Pagans in Vegas (Metric)\n\nSynth-pop group from Toronto, lead singer Emily Haynes, been around since the turn of the century but took a big step forward with 2009's Fantasies. This is about as good, mature songs built on solid melodies, nothing too chirpy or flashy. [**] 79. Lil Dicky: Professional Rapper (self-released, 2CD)\n\nDavid Burd, name actually on the cover which presents a professional-looking resume touting his BSBA and summa cum laude 3.93 GPA. From Cheltenham Township, a suburb of Philadelphia, first album, crowdsourced after mixtapes called So Hard and Hump Days. Two long, and not as funny as most similar artist MC Barman, but maybe one shouldn't be so picky. [**] 80. The Drive-By Truckers: It's Great to Be Alive! (ATO, 3CD)\n\nI put this off on the theory that 3:16:13 of anything is too much to pay attention to streaming -- which didn't keep my ears from perking up for the line that goes, \"and all them politicians, they all lyin' sacks of shit\" (I was writing about Donald Trump at the moment, although it could just as easily have been Marco Rubio, or Hillary Clinton). A couple decades worth of songs, redundant if you've followed them, but terrific as background noise, nicely unified by the live sound and occasional patter. On separate discs I imagine the length will only become more tolerable. [**] 81. Elysia Crampton: American Drift (Blueberry)\n\nBorn in Bolivia, grew up in Southern California and Northern Mexico, based in Virginia (which inspires some historiography here), previously known as E+E. Four pieces, thick with synth layered like geological strata (another interest), topped with a smatter of voices, as peripheral as people crawling on the surface of the earth. [**] 82. Fabiano Do Nascimento: Dança Dos Tempos (Now-Again)\n\nDebut from Brazilian guitarist, based in Los Angeles, backed by Airto Moreira on percussion and Ricardo Pasillas on drums, with occasional vocals from Nascimento and Kana Shimanuki. This never settles into pleasantries, even at its most intimate. [**]"
