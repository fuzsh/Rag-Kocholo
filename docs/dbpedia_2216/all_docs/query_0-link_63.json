        "text": "Image by LivePict, via Wiki­me­dia Com­mons\n\nThe mean­ing of the word “library” has nev­er been more ambigu­ous. When we can vir­tu­al­ly car­ry library-sized col­lec­tions of images, music, lit­er­a­ture and ref­er­ence data in our pock­ets, what are phys­i­cal libraries but muse­ums of a sort? Of course, from the point of view of librar­i­ans espe­cial­ly, this isn’t true in the least. Libraries are fortress­es of free speech, pub­lic edu­ca­tion, and “infor­ma­tion lit­er­a­cy” at the com­mu­ni­ty lev­el. Rather than obso­lete or sec­ondary, they may be more nec­es­sary than ever.\n\nOn a larg­er view both of these things are true. For mil­lions of peo­ple, phys­i­cal libraries have become sec­ondary and will remain so, but they also remain com­mu­ni­ty resources of para­mount impor­tance. As Ted Mills post­ed here in the sum­mer of 2015, Talk­ing Heads front­man, “poly­math and all-around swell per­son David Byrne” affirmed that lat­ter sta­tus of the phys­i­cal library when he leant out 250 books on music from his per­son­al library to them­selves be leant out at a library host­ed by the 22nd annu­al Melt­down Fes­ti­val and London’s Poet­ry Library.\n\n“I love a library,” wrote Byre in his own Guardian essay announc­ing the project.\n\nI grew up in sub­ur­ban Bal­ti­more and the sub­urbs were not a par­tic­u­lar­ly cos­mopoli­tan place. We were des­per­ate to know what was going on in the cool places, and, giv­en some sug­ges­tions and direc­tion, the library was one place where that wider excit­ing world became avail­able. In my lit­tle town, the library also had vinyl that one could check out and I dis­cov­ered avant-garde com­posers such as Xenakis and Mes­si­aen, folk music from var­i­ous parts of the world and even some pop records that weren’t get­ting much radio play in Bal­ti­more. It was tru­ly a for­ma­tive place.\n\nHav­ing grown up in the DC sub­urbs in the years before the inter­net, I can relate, and would add the impor­tance of local music stores and afford­able all-age venues. But Byrne has nev­er stayed tied to the media of his youth. Dur­ing his sev­er­al decades as a cul­tur­al crit­ic and arts edu­ca­tor, he has made ecu­meni­cal use of mun­dane new tech­nolo­gies to inter­ro­gate the sta­tus of oth­er old­er forms. One recent project, for exam­ple, con­sist­ed of a 96-page book and 20-minute DVD about his exper­i­ments in Pow­er­Point art. One of the ques­tions raised by the project, writes Veronique Vienne, is whether the book is “an anti­quat­ed cul­tur­al arti­fact” in an age of hyper­vi­su­al­iza­tion.\n\nClear­ly for Byrne him­self, the answer is no, and that answer is close­ly con­nect­ed to the ques­tion of com­mod­i­fi­ca­tion vers­es open access, whether through libraries or free online archives. “The idea of read­ing books for free,” he writes, “didn’t kill the pub­lish­ing busi­ness, on the con­trary, it cre­at­ed nations of lit­er­ate and pas­sion­ate read­ers. Shared inter­ests and the impulse to cre­ate.” Byrne’s library reflects a life­time of shared inter­ests and cre­ative inspi­ra­tion. He him­self has spent his life writ­ing about music in spite of the clever max­im that such a ven­ture is like “danc­ing about archi­tec­ture.” It is, he writes, “stim­u­lat­ing and inspir­ing nonethe­less.”\n\nIn the spir­it of shar­ing infor­ma­tion and cham­pi­oning libraries, Brain Pick­ings’ Maria Popo­va pub­lished a list of near­ly all of the titles in Byrne’s lend­ing library, with links to pub­lic library edi­tions near you through World­Cat.
