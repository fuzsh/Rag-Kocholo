        "text": "Music Has the Right to Children is an amazing LP.\n\n''Scottish brothers Marcus Eoin and Michael Sandison deliberately eschewed dance music convention and set out to create a timeless sound with their debut LP, a sound that affected mind and body differently than other music, working on a deeper level, creating an almost meditative effect – despite how dark and eerie it can also be.''\n\n139.

Notorious BIG - Ready to Die (1994) (Rolling Stone 500 #22)\n\n136. Nick Drake - Five Leaves Left (1969)\n\nProducer: Joe Boyd\n\nFive Leaves Left is the debut studio album by English folk musician Nick Drake. Recorded between 1968 and 1969, it was released in 1969 by Island Records.\n\nReception\n\nReviews of the album in the months following its release were mixed. The brief review in Melody Maker discussed the origins of the album's title and added simply, \"It sounds poetic and so does composer, singer and guitarist Nick Drake. His debut album for Island is interesting.\" Rating the album three out of four stars, Disc and Music Echo also described the album as \"interesting\" and said, \"His guitar work is soft, gentle and tuneful; his voice highly attractive, husky and bluesy—but his songs uncertain and indirect.\" It concluded, \"It's more a restful album than a stimulating one.\" In October 1969 Gordon Coxhill of the NME expressed his disappointment with the record, saying, \"I'm sorry I can't be more enthusiastic because he obviously has a not inconsiderable amount of talent, but there is not nearly enough variety on this debut LP to make it entertaining. His voice reminds me very much of Peter Sarstedt, but his songs lack Sarstedt's penetration and arresting quality.\" A review the same month by Maurice Rosenbaum in The Daily Telegraph was more positive, describing the record as an \"excellent LP of [Drake's] own songs\", and observing, \"His voice is slow, reflective and warm, and although the verse structure tends to melodic monotony, there is no mistaking the quality and the promise of 'River Man', 'The Thoughts of Mary Jane', 'Man in a Shed' and other items on this disc\".\n\nUntil the 1990s Drake's albums had been critically and popularly underappreciated. By the 1990s, though, Drake and his work had begun to attract more attention. A 1989 retrospective assessment of Five Leaves Left by Len Brown in NME awarded the album 9/10 and stated that it \"remains a masterpiece of English melancholy; a moving work that first revealed Drake's remarkable talent to communicate his fears of passing light and life, with simple beauty; his skill to charge listeners with emotions equal to his own\". Including it in a 1999 list of twelve of \"the best folk albums of all time\", Q in 1999 called it \"the pinnacle of a melancholy canon of work so distinctive that admirers can only speculate miserably on what might have been\". A 2007 review by Chris Jones for the BBC said, \"it's hard not to be still floored by the beauty of [Drake's] first album\" and lauded its \"unique vision\" mixing elements of English folk music and jazz.\n\nThe release of the remastered version in 2000 resulted in further positive retrospective reviews from music magazines. John Harris wrote in Q that \"the record's abiding impression\" was of \"a hesitant, slightly troubled soul peering at the straight world and wondering what will become of both him and the people he beholds\". In Uncut Ian MacDonald said, \"A fine debut, Five Leaves Left would have been stronger still had 'I Was Made to Love Magic' and 'Time of No Reply' been used instead of 'Thoughts of Mary Jane' and 'Man in a Shed' ... This aside, the album remains singular – cool and shady amid the celebratory sunshine of the late Sixties.\" Alternative Press called it \"[one] of the most beautiful and melancholy albums ever recorded\".\n\nFive Leaves Left has regularly appeared on lists of the best albums of all time. The album was ranked number 283 on Rolling Stonemagazine's original 2003 list of \"The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time\". NME ranked it at number 258 on their 2013 list of \"NME's The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time\", noting that \"his maudlin songs are brought vividly to life with orchestration from Fairport Convention, Pentangle and arranger Robert Kirby\". A list of the \"200 Greatest Albums of All Time\" in Uncut in 2016 placed the album at number 183.\n\nA list of \"The 100 Greatest Debut Albums\" in Uncut in 2006 placed Five Leaves Left at number 29. The record was also included in a list of \"Debut Albums That Changed Music\" in Q magazine in 2017. In a 2007 Mojo article titled \"100 Records That Changed the World\" Five Leaves Left was placed at number 78. It is also included in the book 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die, which called it \"a remarkable work: stuffed with complex, introspective music but leavened with arrangements and production straight off the top shelf ... the record is full of glittering, warm sounds that have not aged a jot in the interim\", and concluded that Drake \"rarely excelled himself more than on this first album\". It was voted number 55 in Colin Larkin's All Time Top 1000 Albums 3rd Edition (2000).\n\nCritical Reception\n\nAllmusic 5/5\n\nEncyclopedia of Popular Music 5/5\n\nEntertainment Weekly A\n\nPitchfork 9.5/10\n\nQ 4/5\n\nRolling Stone Album Guide 5/5\n\nUncut 4/5\n\nTracklist\n\n135. Kate Bush - The Dreaming (1982)\n\nThe Dreaming is the fourth studio album by English singer-songwriter Kate Bush, released on 13 September 1982 by EMI Records. Recorded over two years, the album was produced entirely by Bush and is often characterised as her most uncommercial and experimental release. The Dreaming peaked at No. 3 on the UK album chart and has been certified Silver by the BPI, but initially sold less than its predecessors and was met with mixed critical reception. Five singles from the album were released, including the UK No. 11 \"Sat in Your Lap\" and the title track.\n\nThe critical standing of the album has improved significantly in recent decades. A public poll conducted by NPR ranked The Dreaming as the 24th greatest album ever made by a female artist. Slant Magazine listed the album at No. 71 on its list of \"Best Albums of the 1980s\". It is also included in the book 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die, the Mojo \"Top 50 Eccentric Albums of All Time\" list and The Word magazine's \"Great Underrated Albums of Our Time\" list. Musicians such as Björk, Steven Wilson of Porcupine Tree, and Big Boi of Outkast have cited The Dreaming as one of their favourite albums.\n\nReception\n\nUpon its release, The Dreaming met with a mixed critical reception. Many were baffled by the unconventional techniques and dense soundscapes Bush had employed. Writing for Smash Hits, Neil Tennant described the album as \"very weird. She's obviously trying to become less commercial.\" Colin Irwin of Melody Maker wrote that \"initially it is bewildering and not a little preposterous, but try to hang on through the twisted overkill and the histrionic fits and there's much reward.\" He labelled \"Suspended in Gaffa\" the only \"vaguely conventional track\" and predicted the album failing in the charts. American critic Robert Christgau wrote that \"the revelation is the dense, demanding music\", calling it \"the most impressive Fripp/Gabriel-style art-rock album of the postpunk refulgence.\" Jon Young of Trouser Press called it \"a triumph of inventive songwriting and unpredictable performances\" but warned that \"its sensory overload will drive away the less than dedicated.\"\n\nIn a later review AllMusic called it \"a theatrical and abstract piece of work\", as well as \"a brilliant predecessor to the charming beauty of 1985's Hounds of Love.\" The Quietus called it \"a brave volte face from a mainstream artist\" and \"a startlingly modern record too\", noting its \"organic hybridization, the use of digital and analogue techniques, its use of modern wizardry to access atavistic states.\" In 2014, critic Simon Reynolds called The Dreaming a \"wholly unfettered mistress-piece\" and \"a delirious, head-spinning experience\". Bush herself has called The Dreaming her \"She's gone mad album\" and said it was not particularly commercial. On later revisiting the album she said she was surprised by the sound, saying that it was quite an angry record. Uncut has said that it was a \"multi-layered, polyrhythmic and wildly experimental album [and] remains a landmark work\".\n\nIn the 2010s, musicians Björk and Big Boi cited The Dreaming as one of their favourite albums. Musician Steven Wilson also stated that the album is one of his favourites and that his 2015 album, Hand. Cannot. Erase., was musically influenced by it.\n\nCritical Reception\n\nAllmusic 3.5/5\n\nRobert Christgau B+\n\nEncyclopedia of Rock Music 4/5\n\nThe Great Rock Discography 6/10\n\nMojo 5/5\n\nMusicHound Rock 3.5/5\n\nPitchfork 7.7/10\n\nRolling Stone Album Guide 3/5\n\nSmash Hits 8/10\n\nSpin Alternative Record Guide 9/10\n\nVillage Voice B+\n\nTracklist\n\nSmile has become the poster child for things that never quite got done, and that's fine - it's part of life and art that not everything comes to fruition. That said. it may be just as well because I have the sneaking feeling that this is much bigger now for having not been done, any finished product I can reasonably imagine coming out in 1966 would have been ok but not the legend that it became in people's minds. I love Pet Sounds and the Good vibrations single, but I find no version of Smile entirely satisfactory, most a mess of half baked gestures that barely qualify as songs. Except Heroes & Villains which is pretty epoch as presented on the box, but it's unlikely that version would've been released at the time. I have a mix tape somewhere, C100 or 110, that has the early hits on one side and all of Pet Sounds plus Good Vibrations, H&V and maybe Sail On Sailor or something else on the other. For years that was what I listened to when I wanted to hear the BBs. Smile is more interesting to think about than to listen to in any version for me, IMHO, YMMV, etc.\n\n134.

Outkast - ATLiens (1996)\n\nProducer: Organized Noize, Outkast\n\nATLiens is the second studio album by the American hip hop duo Outkast. It was released on August 27, 1996, by Arista Records and LaFace Records. From 1995 to 1996, Outkast recorded ATLiens in sessions at several Atlanta studios—Bosstown Recording Studios, Doppler Recording Studios, PatchWerk Recording Studio, Purple Dragon Studios, and Studio LaCoCo—as well as Chung King Recording Studio and Sound On Sound Recording in New York City.\n\nThe record features outer space-inspired production sounds, with Outkast and producers Organized Noize incorporating elements of dub and gospel into the compositions. Several songs feature the duo's first attempts at producing music by themselves. Lyrically, the group discusses a wide range of topics including urban life as hustlers, existential introspection, and extraterrestrial life. The album's title is a portmanteau of \"ATL\" (an abbreviation of Atlanta, Georgia, the duo’s hometown) and \"aliens\", which has been interpreted by critics as a commentary about the feeling of being isolated from American culture.\n\nATLiens debuted at number two on the US Billboard 200 chart, and it sold nearly 350,000 copies in its first two weeks of release. The album was very well received by music critics upon its release, who praised its unique sound and lyrical content. It has been certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), for shipments of two million copies in the United States. The album spawned the singles \"Elevators (Me & You)\", \"ATLiens\" / \"Wheelz of Steel\", and \"Jazzy Belle\". Since its release, ATLiens has been listed by several magazines and critics as one of the greatest hip-hop albums of all time.\n\nReception\n\nATLiens received critical acclaim. Andrea Comer of the Hartford Courant felt that Outkast's \"lyrical acumen shines through\" despite \"Heltah-Skeltah mumbling and Southern slang\", and stated, \"after a few rotations, the alien feeling wears away, and [the album is] just out of this world.\" Sonia Murray of The Atlanta Journal-Constitution called the album \"more thoughtful\" than its predecessor, noting, \"What the second album lacks in adventurous arrangements it more than makes up for in lyrical dominance.\" The Source's Allen S. Gordon observed \"growth\" from Outkast and Organized Noize, and stated, \"Big Boi and Dre have gone out of this world into a new dimension of sight, sound and mind\".\n\nKevin Powell of Rolling Stone felt that, like Outkast's debut album, ATLiens is \"a gritty document of what's happening here and now, an up-to-the-minute briefing on Southern black ghetto life on which Outkast members Andre and Big Boi cast their feelings of alienation in familiar, realistic characterizations\". Powell asserted that unlike East Coast hip hop's \"hedonistic materialism\" or \"the gunplay and pimpism\" of West Coast hip hop, \"Andre and Big Boi display a unique ability to describe ghetto life while offering up life-affirming possibilities, something all too rare in today's hip-hop nation.\" Richard Harrington of The Washington Post enjoyed the record's \"more serious and focused lyrical sensibility\", explaining, \"The raps are generally inventive, clever without being cloying, more proof (if any were needed) that hip-hop innovation isn't just an East-West thang.\"\n\nIn a retrospective review, AllMusic editor Steve Huey viewed the album as Outkast's \"most focused work\" and commented that \"In addition to the striking musical leap forward, Dre and Big Boi continue to grow as rappers; their flows are getting more tongue-twistingly complex, and their lyrics more free-associative\". RapReviews critic Steve Juon recommended it to listeners who \"want to be challenged by [their] hip-hop\" and wrote of the album's aesthetic:\n\n\"It's deep. So deep that listening to ATLiens you might feel like drowning, but the smooth vo-cals of Big Boi and the earthy flows of Andre always push you back up to the surface. They are players in the truest sense of the word; not just playing for ends but playing to win in the ultimate battle of life over death, good over bad, and righteousness over evil. Yet, it's not that heavy either. This album is nod your head music, shake your ass music. It makes you think and groove at the same time.\"\n\nIn The Rolling Stone Album Guide (2004), Roni Sarig felt that, strong rapping notwithstanding, the album's music \"suffers as the duo make their first attempt at self-producing\" and stated, \"Although ATLiens promised expanded vistas with its interstellar motif, the record delivered something of a sophomore slump ... At best, ATLiens is the sound of an ambitious group searching for its voice.\"\n\nIn 1998, the album was selected as one of The Source's \"100 Best Rap Albums\". In 2000, Exclaim! listed the album on their \"100 Records That Rocked 100 Issues of Exclaim!\" list. Hip Hop Connection ranked it number six on their list of \"The 100 Greatest Rap Albums 1995–2005\". Complex ranked the album fifth on their list of \"The 50 Greatest Sophomore Albums in Hip-Hop History\", its title 15th on \"The 50 Best Rap Album Titles Ever\", and the title track's beat 91st on \"The 100 Greatest Hip-Hop Beats of All Time\".\\ Rappers Isaiah Rashad,\\ Wiz Khalifa and Dom Kennedy, and DJ Jesse Marco have named ATLiens as one of their favorite albums.\n\nCritical Reception\n\nAllmusic 4.5/5\n\nAtlanta Journal-Constitution 3.5/4\n\nAustin Chronicle 4/5\n\nBlender 4/5\n\nEncyclopedia of Popular Music 3/5\n\nGreat Rock Discography 7/10\n\nRolling Stone 4/5\n\nRolling Stone Album Guide 3/5\n\nThe Source 4/5\n\nTracklist"
