That seems ambitious enough till one realizes that the tracks also feature some of the most impressive (but not necessarily widely known) artists in the hemisphere. It's no wonder that it won the Folk Roots Critics' Poll for Compilation/Re-issue of 2000.\n\nIt's hard to single out highlights, but the first CD kicks off very strongly with Group Vocal Desandann, a Haitian group based in Cuba who perform a tribute to the Day of the Dead. Other songs that are especially memorable include a women's call-and-response chorus by ParacumbÃ© from Puerto Rico, Ti-Coca from Haiti singing a traditional folk song about a sacrifice to the Voodoo god Agwe, and Andy Palacio, a very popular punta rock star from Belize. Just when one suspects that things might become repetitious, a song by Susana Baca is followed by The Jackson Singers' \"Down in Mississippi,\" a superb fusion of gospel and blues. This is one of three tracks from the U.S. (another being Big Mama Thornton with Muddy Waters singing \"Gimme a Penny\"), and it's followed by an equally impressive song by The Abyssinians, one of two reggae tracks from Jamaica, the other being \"Fisherman\" by The Congos (on CD 2). A strong sense of virtuosity, of community, and of unfettered vitality permeates every one of these tracks... the set sheds light into a few neglected musical niches of the Americas.\"\n\nFOLKER.DE (in German) (Best South American Recording of 2000)\n\nBEST CDs OF THE PAST DECADEÂ (a review by Johannes Theurer, World Music Charts Europe)\n\nÂ\n\nTHE ROUGH GUIDE TOÂ THE MUSIC OF RUSSIAÂ (World Music Network)\n\nReviews and Features\n\nEYE WEEKLY (Best CDs of 2002)\n\nPOPMATTERSÂ \"...To say there are some great tracks among the 19 here wouldn't do this collection justice, compiling music that simply isn't heard very often in the West.

I find that good liner notes increase the listening experience and help me gain an understanding of the music, especially when the language is unfamiliar...
