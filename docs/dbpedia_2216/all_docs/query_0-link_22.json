        "text": "From Analog Africa - 1 free track each day for 10 days....\n\nFunky People!! We´ve prepared a little something for you. A selection of tunes that had been pre-selected for the second Ranil project. And since we all need a little conforting we will be uploading one track per day on our bandcamp for the next 10 days. Feel free to download them when you feel like it and please SHARE the selection with as many friends and loved ones as possible!!\n\n- And so we proudly present to you -\n\nThe Ranil Stay Safe & Sound Selection:\n\nStay Safe & Sound Ranil Selection !! (SHARE IT !!!), by Ranil\n\n(Leave a comment on bandcamp once you download the track(s) if you want and I´ll forward those to Ranil himself)\n\n01. Albores De Mi Selva\n\n02. Andalusia\n\n03. Bahia\n\n04. Inca\n\n05. Pueblo\n\n06. Te Quiero Mucho\n\n07. Tres Cienaquero\n\n08. Lindo Atardecer\n\n09. Ojos Achinaditos\n\n10. Paisaje\n\nI found one of his singles a year or two back in a junk shop. It must be quite rare, I had to enter it onto discogs.\n\nI must admit, I prefer the later 70/80s African music but it's an interesting curio, especially for 50p!\n\nIn the 1970's, the African Record Center in Harlem (another branch in Brooklyn) was about the only place you could get true African records in the USA. I was a \"first-name basis\" regular customer. I still have most of the run of African label LPs and 45s in mint condition. Most copies of such records were party/dance records and are quite abused and used, but even those are rare (because there was only one store). You might have better luck in Paris or Brussels, but even those are likely to be quite used.\n\nSounds great! Whenever I buy original African records (I'm into the funkier ones personally) I usually have to order them from France, I suppose they've got a lot of connections with Africa dating back to colonial days.\n\nUpdate from Samy...\n\nDespite the fact that this selection is available for free, many of you have donated some money and we have now collected 600€. We would like to thank you for your generosity and take this opportunity to do the same.\n\nWe will be donating all the money coming in from this selection to a charity that will distribute food to the most vulnerable here in Perú - that's our wish. I would like to be able to forward that money personally and see first hand how this donation is implemented.\n\nLets hope that's possible especially due to the fact that the quarantine here is very strict. In any case, If you know any such charity organization, please share it with us!\n\nFWIW, a reader asked Robert Christgau a while back for African music recommendations. (The Ladysmith Black Mambazo compilation and The Indestructible Beat of Soweto were relatively popular in the U.S. thanks to Paul Simon's Graceland):\n\n[Q] What are some records that you would recommend to start with for someone who wants to get into African music?\n\n[A] Many of the best are old, expensive, and hard to find, in part because I've helped make them cult records, probably: Trevor Herman's glorious Guitar Paradise of East Africa comp, for instance, which he failed to license properly and kind of disappeared. But The Rough Guide to Youssou N'Dour and Etoile de Dakar, The Indestructible Beat of Soweto, Franco & Rochereau's Omona Wapi (the four-track Shanachie condensation of the original), the first volume of Ken Braun'sRochereau anthology for Sterns and the second of the Franco (not that both volumes aren't great in each case), Ladysmith Black Mambazo's Classic Tracks, King Sunny Ade's The Best of the Classic Years, Youssou's Rokku Mi Rokka and Egypt, and Oumou Sangare's Worotan seem findable as I write and are all records I'll put on for visiting newbies or casual, who tend to become intrigued. Congotronics 2 and the first Staff Banda Bilili records are post-soukous Kinshasa music that's worth a dip. Get 'em while supplies last. And in addition, a listen to the Riton and Kah-Lo record I just reviewed might make sense. It's slighter than any of the above, but it's also a contemporary fusion that might be a good intro."
