        "text": "Musicasaurus.com unearths & unveils my skeletal framework—the relics and remnants of my own Life in Music…\n\nA new reflection will be posted every two weeks, on Sunday evening.....Each entry will highlight a happenstance, illuminate an episode, or capture an encounter—all mined from the music vein that has layered my life.\n\n_______________________________________________________________________________\n\nPosted 8/18/24....THAT’S LIFE\n\n(Next post: Sunday, September 1, 2024)\n\nI fell in love in 1977. With an album cover.\n\nI was working at an indie record store in Wexford, PA at that time, livin’ the life—underpaid and overjoyed to be working in a place where for pretty much eleven hours a day, music blared and passions flared. This was the first year of our store’s existence on the Wexford Flats just outside of Pittsburgh, and our trickle of curious customers soon turned into a tide of regulars who on average spent about 90 minutes after their entry into our world of albums & tapes.\n\nAlbum covers were things to linger over, to study—mentally scrambling to affix meaning to the particular artwork on the front; flipping the album over to soak up the musician and producer credits on the back. That’s how, unpacking a shipment of newly arrived albums from our record distributor, I chanced upon Valerie Carter’s debut album Just A Stone’s Throw Away.\n\nI was captivated by the cover, first of all. It was an alluring photo of a beautiful young woman dressed just like some hippie-ish girl of my twenty-something dreams with a hat that was part flapper and flower, and an expression that locked my gaze. The back of the album really told the tale, however, with its right-side top to bottom roster of contributing singers and musicians who apparently had all boarded and banded together to get this young girl’s musical message out to the masses. For me, the list was a who’s who of artists I loved—four members of Little Feat including band leader Lowell George, a handful of Earth, Wind & Fire musicians, Jackson Browne, Linda Ronstadt, the Lovin’ Spoonful’s John Sebastian, singer Deniece Williams, the band Orleans’ front man John Hall, Toto’s Jeff Porcaro on drums, L.A. jazz session players Ernie Watts (saxophone) and Oscar Brashear (trumpet), and others.\n\nWhen I cracked open the cellophane on Carter’s debut and dropped the needle on its contents, the mastery and the meshing of talent was immediately apparent and palpable. The sound of the record was deep and glorious, pristinely produced by the savvy musician/producer Lowell George, who I found out later on had once squired Carter through an earlier band-effort recording, essentially then taking her under his wing.\n\nI was a diehard Little Feat fan back then so I was predisposed to love most any album where Feat had trod, but with Carter it was something different. Amidst the swirl of talented musicians and the whip smart song arrangements, Carter’s voice was the overarching thing that stirred something deep within me. Listening to the album all the way through I came away, quite frankly, in wonderment.\n\nSomehow as Carter moved through each song at hand, she shone with a sense of innocence and emotions held somewhat in check. But then this softness would sometimes cede control to reveal much deeper reserves of power and in these fuel-injected moments—lost in her art and untethered from inhibitions—she unleashed an incredible wellspring of passion into these passages.\n\nCarter recorded her debut album, Just A Stone’s Throw Away, in Los Angeles, California when she was 24 years old. She had been born in Winter Haven, Florida in 1953, and her father was a military man so the family moved fairly often in Carter’s early years. In an interview she did with writer Laura Stegman for the JTO (James Taylor Online) website in September 1999, Carter talked about how she wound up in California: “Well, my teenage years were pretty strange,” Carter told Stegman. “Probably everybody’s teenage years were pretty strange (laughs). I left home—my parents were frantic—and I went and stayed with my cousin in New York City. I grew up in the South in small towns, if you can even call them towns, and I’d never been to a big city in my life. I looked in the Village Voice for work, and I found this waitress-singer thing in the Village. I would do folk music sets with this Iranian guy, and in between I would serve meals while these belly dancers came out. I did that for about seven or eight months, and I learned how to write a little bit. Then I hitchhiked across country with some friends—because that’s what you did then—and we wound up in San Francisco and started playing coffeehouses.”\n\nCarter soon formed a group while in northern California called Howdy Moon. The trio released a self-titled album in 1974 which was produced by Lowell George, and the three band members began holing up with some regularity at West Hollywood’s famous ‘70s-era rock club the Troubadour. Carter points to her manager Bob Cavallo—who also managed Laura Nyro, the Lovin’ Spoonful and Little Feat at the time—as being incredibly supportive especially as time drew near to the start of recording for her 1977 debut album. As Carter explained to Stegman, “He handled this ‘candy store’ full of amazingly talented people, very nice people, who were very willing to help out somebody who obviously had some talent but wasn’t honed at all. Like Maurice White of Earth Wind & Fire, and just a really interesting conglomerate of people. They were all there for me, some in small ways that still were huge to me, and some in very large ways. They just gave a hundred percent of themselves so I could kind of find my way.”\n\nAs thankful as Carter was for the rallying of support from her manager and generous peer musicians, she was also plagued by self-doubt. About her mentor Lowell George, Carter confessed to interviewer Stegman that his unbridled support of her was a bit perplexing. “Lowell was always so curious about anybody and their music and what they were up to,” Carter said. “And, honestly, I’ve looked back at some of the stuff I did, and I just had so much innocence and such a lack of understanding of who I was. And my voice is kind of small, you know, real shy, and I don’t even know why he took up his time with me. I really don’t know. I look back on it and think it was so incredibly brave of him. And if he saw something, I wasn’t aware of it.\n\n“I think part of what happened for me is that I felt like I was going to get ‘found out’ back then. I was thinking, ‘I can’t really do this, but here I am and these people are so talented and wonderful, and I’m just sort of coasting on their heels.’ But then I look back and I think, well why would they have worked with me, and I try to feel ‘validated’ (laughs).”\n\nAnd this is where I circle back to that first album of Carter’s, 1977’s Just A Stones Throw Away. It seems apparent to me now, after listening to it through the years and again just recently, that everyone in her sphere who had lent a hand and much needed support for that record must have genuinely felt that she had the gift. In the lead-off track to that album—“Ooh Child,” a cover of a 1970 pop/R & B hit by Chicago-area soul band the Five Stairsteps—one can hear Carter’s soaring abandon come to the fore. She owns this tune, singing as if her life depended upon it. It lilts then barrels along, building in intensity until finally, at the song’s peak, Carter unleashes the most powerful wail imaginable. It is a thing of staggering beauty.\n\n​\n\nThough Carter stinted with other artists in the mid-‘70s including Jackson Browne and James Taylor, and released a second solo album in 1978, wide success eluded her. She explained to writer Stegman how she abandoned her aspirations for a solo career in the late 1970s, only to resurface much later on, around 1990, as a background singer: “I got scared, and I got frustrated, and I got sad. I dropped out of the whole music thing for a while. I had personal difficulties with living here in Los Angeles, with a life of music. I was at an all-time low in my life, and I didn’t quite know what was going to happen. Eventually, I got some help. I took a really long time away from friends, away from anything I had ever known around here.\n\n“When I came back I decided that I couldn’t handle trying go out and forge a record deal and start all of that madness over right away. I was too delicate. But what I could do was sing, and that’s what I’ve always been happy doing. And I knew I could stand behind someone and let the spotlight shine somewhere else. I could at least express myself through the power of singing.\n\n“So I made a few phone calls to say, ‘I’m ready to come back.’ I called Peter Asher [James Taylor’s manager at the time]. That was one of the first calls, and I didn’t expect anything to come of it. I didn’t expect anything to come of anything. I didn’t realize that people are as good as they were and as forgiving of someone who just kind of stepped away from them and from everything having to do with music. But friends rallied and really supported my wanting to come back...I literally called Peter and just put it out there. And it came right back. And I did the same with Jackson [Brown], and the same thing happened, but in a lesser way because Jackson just doesn’t tour as often as James. And it also happened with Linda [Ronstadt]. They really came through with open arms, and I’ve been nothing but grateful since the day it started.”\n\nFinding herself on more of a steady track within the music business—touring with Browne and Taylor; guesting on a number of other artists’ albums like those by Aaron Neville, Don Henley, Glenn Frey, Linda Ronstadt, Neil Diamond and Shawn Colvin—Carter in 1996 mustered a third solo album, her first in eighteen years. The album, entitled The Way It Is, was a welcome return to form. On this album artists appreciative of Carter’s depth of talent signed on for guest vocal appearances, including Taylor and Browne, Linda Ronstadt, Phoebe Snow and Lyle Lovett, the latter sharing vocal chores on a tune originally co-written by Bill Withers, a gritty bit of insistent funk called “Who Is She (And What Is She to You).”\n\nWhen I was general manager of Star Lake Amphitheatre, Pittsburgh’s largest outdoor concert venue, I actually met Carter late in the evening of July 18, 1997. She had been touring with James Taylor as one of his backup singers, and after Taylor and band had finished their set and were straggling one by one toward the tour buses, I literally bumped into Carter around a corner of the dressing room hallway. We did that time-honored awkward dance of trying to move out of each other’s pathway, and then compliments just gushed out of me.\n\nI blurted out that I was a fan and that her recent album The Way It Is was something that I really liked, and I think in the dim hallway light she might have actually blushed. She seemed genuinely moved by my praise and said it had been much too long of a stretch between albums but that she was glad she finally got one out again. I mentioned the song “Sea of Stars” from the new album was a favorite and likened it to her performance on “Ooh Child” from ’77 because of the passion unleashed, and she averted her eyes just for a second and smiled deep and wide. She seemed to me to be the humblest of souls especially about her talent. Our hallway encounter unfortunately lasted all of a minute or so, but this to me was a real gift. I was so moved by her work, and it was wonderful to have the opportunity to show that appreciation in person. She glided by me to continue to the bus, and I floated away in the other direction...\n\nCarter’s last studio recording was a 5-song CD entitled Find a River which was released in 1998. By 2007 she had come to a decision to retire from the life of a professional musician, and so subsequently moved back to her birth state of Florida, to St. Petersburg, to help care for her mother Dorothy.\n\nIn the previously mentioned Laura Stegman interview piece from September 1999 when Carter was still living in L.A., Stegman asked her if she definitely knew back in the early/mid-‘70s that she had wanted to be a singer. The response: “Yeah, all indicators pointed in that direction quite strongly. I hadn’t taken a great deal of interest in school. Music came so naturally, and everything else in my life was a fight, and a real, real difficult struggle. One side of my brain is functioning—my music side—and the rest of me is trying to do the best I can.”\n\nI think that last line in particular is quite telling. In 2009 while living in St. Petersburg, Carter was arrested in August of that year by police for possession of cocaine. In October of that year, caught again—this time with crack. It was Carter’s good fortune to land in the drug court of Judge Dee Anna Farnell, who sees about 1,200 people come before her each year. The drug court is set up to give out a bit of hope with its justice; if a person is not a convicted felon or a sex offender, and the crime is solely drug possession, the sentence can be served in a rehabilitation facility instead of a jail cell. And at some later date—after treatment, fines paid in full and drug tests passed —there is a graduation ceremony where the individual’s permanent record simply says “Adjudication withheld.”\n\nJames Taylor paid for Carter’s three-month term in a Texas rehab facility shortly after her 2009 arrest, and when May of 2011 rolled around, he was there in drug court at graduation time. Her slate cleaned, her certificate awarded, Carter embraced Taylor. “Thank you,” she said. “Thank you for taking such good care of me.” The judge said to the assembled, by way of explanation, that Mr. Taylor had had a long relationship with Carter, and “you have heard her on his albums. And you will hear her again.”\n\nThat was not to be. Valerie Carter died on March 4, 2017 from a heart attack at the age of 64. On a Facebook post soon thereafter, Taylor wrote the following as he reflected on her passing: “I first met Valerie when she came with Lowell George to a session of mine at Amigo studios in Burbank CA. That was in the mid 70s and the song we were working on was ‘Angry Blues,’ one of mine. After Lowell put down an amazing guitar part, Valerie offered to try some vocal passes. It was just the thing, one of my favorite days in the studio and the beginning of a long working relationship with one of the great singers of her generation. You'd hear it said time and again: ‘how can such a big sound come from such a delicate, diminutive creature?’ ‘Where does it come from?’ For sure it's a mystery but Valerie was an old soul and as deep as a well. Her voice came from her life and her life was a steep, rocky road. I believe that we can hear it, whenever the music is that crucial, when the song is saving someone's life. We were the lucky ones, who worked (played) with Valerie Carter over the long arc of her creative career; we got the best of her love.”\n\n[Additional source material for this blog post: “Drug Court Grads Have A Friend—James Taylor” – an article by Lane DeGregory, Tampa Bay Times Staff Writer – May 25, 2011.]\n\n_______________________________________________________________________________\n\nPosted 8/4/24....AS TIME GOES BY\n\n[photo far left: Tom Rooney flanked by Steve Miller (in shades) and Miller's opening act Curtis Salgado - July 23, 1992]\n\n[photo far right: Eddie Van Halen, Lance Jones in purple shirt, and PACE executive Louis Messina behind them - August 11, 1995]\n\nTom Rooney, currently the head of Pittsburgh-based Rooney Sports & Entertainment Group, L.L.C., recently posted on Facebook a brief but fascinating insider lookback at the first decade of Star Lake Amphitheatre (the 1990s). Tom along with fellow venue operator Wilson Rogers, both at that time employed by Houston-based entertainment giant PACE, were the two top drivers of the boots-on-the-ground planning, development, and eventual opening of this southwestern Pennsylvania outdoor concert facility. Rooney’s reflections about Star Lake’s startup and some of his memorable challenges along the way—in the form of a “Top Ten”--spurred me on to write up a similar list, though I have capped my contributions at five. Between the two of us, though, we’ve pried open the door for you on some of the more interesting issues--and artists--that we dealt with.\n\nTOM’S TOP REMEMBRANCES:\n\nI was younger, thinner, had more hair and wasn't playing from the senior tees. My involvement at Star Lake was from its inaugural year of 1990 to 1999...five years onsite as executive director and five more from Texas where I was President of the Facilities Group. Lance Jones took over for me when I went to PACE in Texas. We had \"Star Lakes\" from Los Angeles to London. This is Star Lake's 35th year and spit balling it I'm guessing more than 10,000,000 have entered its gates. Here's a Letterman Top Ten stories from those first ten years you may like to know...or care to know.\n\n1. We were running the Pittsburgh Civic Arena and promoting many of our own shows in the late 1980s but we knew the amphitheater boom was coming. We started the Skyline Series to use the roof opening capability to take advantage of acts playing what were called \"sheds\" at that time. But the production limitations were tough using that setup. Still, Bob Dylan, Jimmy Buffett, James Taylor, the Beach Boys and Chicago among others played our summer configuration.\n\n2. At the Arena we were already working with Louis Messina and PACE on concerts, especially urban ones, and with motor sports such as the truck pulls. They wanted to build an amphitheater in the Pittsburgh market before someone else did. Politically, we were tied to Allegheny County and tried to find a spot. South Park was an option but the traffic and noise impact would never let that happen.\n\n3. PACE had a local real estate guy here and he found Burgettstown in Washington County. At the same time another group was trying for a deal in Adams Township and Butler County. We won the race. Governor Rendell came for the groundbreaking arranged by our public relations team of Bernie Caplan and Lorraine Capozzi. There were torrents of rain that November 1989. It was born under a bad sign.\n\n4. You think getting out of Star Lake now is bad. We had to get a new ramp done to Route 22 East towards Pittsburgh because the original intersection would have caused you to cross over the highway and loop around. Was another exit from Star Lake ever contemplated? After the first year we looked into hooking up a road behind the stage house that could have connected to a lower exit on Route 22. But the area was contaminated with coal sludge, a residue of strip mining. No deal.\n\n5. No, Billy Joel and the debacle that ensued was not supposed to be the first show. It was supposed to be Rush a weeks earlier. But those heavy rains returned and when we set the spacious lawn with turf it slid down to the pavilion like underwear that lost its elasticity.\n\n6. Original capacity of \"The Lake\" was 20,000 but the contractor had a staging area behind the walkaway between the two concourses and we converted that to more capacity. Greedy, we were.\n\n7. Steve Miller actually sold some 27,000 tickets because Star Lake was known for its “walk up sales\" and we had created this $10.25 ticket corresponding to our radio partner WDVE's frequency...102.5. Funny moment. My teenage son Josh, who worked in the parking lots for us, had a bunch of his high school friends at the show. I asked one of them why thousands of 16-year-olds like himself were there. \"I'm here because everyone else is here,\" he said. Huh, as our production manager Gary Hinston would always say. We had become the mall. One other kid told me he just had the worst experience of his young life there that night. Why, I asked what happened, and he replied, “I ran into my parents at the show tonight!\" Yikes.\n\n8. Fans do have a say. We had done Chicago a lot of years at the Arena and then the first several years at Star Lake. Their agent called me one fall and asked what did I think of the idea of Peter Cetera rejoining the band. \"Might be good,\" I said. \"Will cost you double,\" he replied. \"Might not be so good, then,\" I countered. Being a research nut, we did surveys at every show. We did a snail mail survey to Chicago attendees and posted the question. We offered free lawn passes for one show for responders. Results were split several ways very even.\n\n-\"Screw Peter Cetera, he quit the band\" said about 25%.\n\n-\"Who's Peter Cetera,\" asked another quarter.\n\n-\"Great, let's do it,\" said another 25%.\n\n-\"We don't care, just send us the passes,\" the final group said.\n\nNo reunion!\n\n9. We don't know how many people attended the Grateful Dead shows because some untold number broke through the entrances and fences to get into the sold-out shows. I got a call from the band's road manager that they were stuck in its own traffic getting there so Hanover Twp. police chief Richard Grey and I drove the wrong way down Route 22. We found the unmarked white van and the passenger window rolled down. Jerry Garcia looked me up and down and asked \"Are you responsible for this shit show?\" We crossed the median and brought them in the wrong way. When the gates were breached the Grateful Dead jumped into \"Brokedown Palace\" and Curt Voss, our resident Dead Head, said it was code for \"we're not coming back here anymore.\" And they didn't.\n\n10. The FBI. That's a call you don't want. (I had another one with the Feds that I can't tell.). But there was a \"credible threat\" that guys on ATVs would use the state game land roads to access the venue from the furthest point of the parking lot and hold up our box office and concession compound. And you know on a sold-out show pre credit card sales, there might have been a $1,000,000 on hand. Would be a great movie. If it was true, the would-be perps must have gotten the word about the G-Men because it didn't happen, of course.\n\nLANCE’S TOP REMEMBRANCES:\n\n1. I worked with Tom Rooney starting in March 1985 at the Civic Arena. When he was poached by PACE to become executive director of Star Lake for its opening season in 1990, I remained at the arena in my post as director of booking. After the amphitheater's inaugural season was over, Tom called and pitched me on leaving the arena for the director of marketing's chair at Star Lake. This position had just opened up due to the transfer of multi-talented marketer Bob Klaus to PACE's brand-new amphitheater in Raleigh, North Carolina.\n\nMy first concert at Star Lake as an employee was a memorable one on May 25, 1991. It was one helluva raucous 'n roll show with Aussie band AC/DC playing to 15,000 ecstatic fans, all of ‘em with heads a-bobbin’ and pulses throbbin’. The excitement level soared to even greater heights that night when the band made a couple of strategically timed announcements during their set about the score of the Pittsburgh Penguins/Minnesota North Stars game that was being played at the Met Center in Minnesota. Pittsburgh’s dream team shook them all night long, extinguishing the Stars with a score of 8-0, and the Pens--with this game--clinched their first Stanley Cup in franchise history.\n\n2. As mentioned above I did not start my employment with the amphitheater until its second season in 1991. But I DO remember well a March 1990 press release that the public relations firm Caplan & Capozzi sent out to all regional media prior to the first concert held at Star Lake, WDVE’s Open House Rocker on June 16, 1990. The press release was entitled “The 15 Most Asked Questions About the Coca-Cola Star Lake Amphitheatre,” and having just read over this ancient release once again, I zeroed in immediately on Question #2. Listed below is both Question #2 and the PR firm’s official answer to that question, and this is followed by what would have been MY answer--a revision for posterity, as now all of us have the benefit of hindsight.\n\n*[Question #2] Where is the Coca-Cola Star Lake Amphitheatre? (from the March 27, 1990 pre-grand opening press release)\n\n*What the PR firm wrote in the release as the venue’s official answer: It’s just 25 minutes from downtown Pittsburgh. Star Lake is located on 328 acres at the intersection of routes U.S. 22 and State 18 at the northern edge of Washington County. From Pittsburgh, take the Parkway West toward the Pittsburgh International Airport. Follow U.S. Routes 22/30 towards Weirton to the intersection of U.S. Route 22 and State Road 18. The amphitheater is just 15 minutes off the Parkway West.\n\n*In hindsight, this fleshed-out version might have been just a bit more fact-based: It’s just 25 minutes from downtown Pittsburgh, if you have strapped on a jetpack or have hitched a ride on a sizable low-flying drone instead of getting in your car. If you have no choice but to drive to one of the venue’s sold-out shows, plan to pack the following: a) a catheter...b) ten back issues of Rolling Stone magazine or Dostoevsky’s The Brothers Karamazov...c) some Zoloft...and d) a deck of cards. Then take the Parkway West toward the Pittsburgh International Airport. Follow U.S. Routes 22/30 towards Weirton and spend between 1 hour and 2 ½ hours of complete stagnation or best case, tolerate a slew of angst-inducing stops-and-starts as you edge toward the intersection of U.S. Route 22 and State Road 18. The amphitheater is just 15 minutes off the Parkway West (we just love how that last bit of phrasing rolls off the tongue, but we also freely admit that this ranks right up there with “The check is in the mail,” “It’s not you; it’s me,” and “It’s only a cold sore.”).\n\n3. The original capacity of Star Lake (pavilion seating plus lawn) was set at 20,000 but as Tom noted, a planned-for staging area behind the walkway between the two concourses was abandoned in final rounds of discussion. Star Lake subsequently had a stated capacity of a smidgeon over 23,000, but as demand for tickets grew, indeed it did occasionally climb again—thanks to the flexibility of space on the lawn. As Tom also noted, the Steve Miller Band once pulled in 27,000 (actually, 26,154--I dug it up) and this occurred on the evening of July 24, 1999. Miller’s fans turned out in such large numbers that the venue from the air must have looked like a geyser of humanity. We just could not stop the flow; approximately 6,000 people marched up to the venue box office that evening from 6pm through 10pm, buying tickets wave after wave, and thus we crowned Miller the reigning King of Star Lake Ticket Sales for A One-Night Engagement.\n\nAs Miller once crooned in his song “The Joker,” some people called him the Space Cowboy and some people called him The Gangster of Love, but WE began calling him Number Two as of September 24, 2004. That night, country star Toby Keith snatched the crown and established a venue attendance record which I believe still stands—27,250 tickets for a single-night performance at The Lake.\n\n4. Tom and I as arena employees promoted the group Chicago at the Pittsburgh Civic Arena several times in the mid-late 1980s, and at the turn of the decade the band rolled on out of town and then settled into a groove at Star Lake for the entire stretch of the 1990s. The reason we had them every year? His name was Howard Rose. He was the booker and titular owner of a small but formidable Los Angeles-based talent agency that handled the bookings of Chicago, but also artists including Lionel Richie and Elton John--and Jimmy Buffett. And as each summer season approached, this fun-loving singer-songwriter (and king of hedonism) had most every amphitheater across the country--including ours--salivating at the prospect of booking him for at least a one-nighter because of his uber-importance to our venue sponsors and box-seat holders. Howard Rose knew this, of course, and his crystal clear but unstated message to us was “Yes, you’ll be booking Chicago this summer, too.”\n\nFan turnout for Chicago at Star Lake was modest, falling somewhere between 5,000 and 8,000 each year, but the shows themselves were usually quite good. The band members we ran across and/or intersected with backstage were easy-going and unpretentious. I particularly liked my few brief encounters over the years with founding-member horn players Lee Loughnane (trumpet and flugelhorn), James Pankow (trombone) and Walter Parazaider (saxophones and flute), and everyone in the band seemed perpetually grateful to be playing in front of their loyal coterie of fans.\n\nAnd we were grateful to have Chicago. The group, three years out of the nine that they played Star Lake between 1990 and 1999, permitted us to have a local Pittsburgh band open for them on the main stage—and this was a rarity and rather a big deal. Guitarist Tony Janflone Jr. and his band warmed up the crowd on August 13, 1995, and the B.E. Taylor Group opened the show for Chicago two times, consecutively—on July 26, 1997 and on August 22, 1998.\n\n5. Tom mentioned in his Top Ten the Grateful Dead who had descended upon The Lake for a two-nighter on June 22 and June 23, 1993. The overabundance of Deadheads out in our parking lots was a bit nerve-racking, but not from any propensity for violence. The overwhelming percentage of the Dead’s followers were reasonably-well behaved but those outside the gates—some of the ones who invariably had the one finger up, looking for a ticket—were both cunning and slippery. They paced the fence lines back and forth, checking for weak points, and some of them—with a snip-snip here, and a snip-snip there—managed to create small openings, peeling back a few of the chain links and s-q-u-e-e-e-e-z-i-n-g through the openings to join their legitimately ticketed brethren who were inside.\n\nI will never forget that on the first night of the Dead’s doubleheader our parent company’s brand new president Miles Wilkin—long a veteran of the company’s theatrical division, and now in charge of the more rough-and-ready concert division—had come to meet the staff and directly experience one of our amphitheater shows. As a few of the slats from a green wooden fence that provided the barrier between the parking lot and our administrative trailer were beginning to be yanked from their positions and hurled over the fence line, Wilkin announced his departure to a few of us who were nearby. “Thanks for inviting me here this evening,” he said, “but I think I’ll come back when you guys have James Taylor.”\n\n_______________________________________________________________________________\n\nPosted 7/21/24....TRICK OF THE TAIL(gating)\n\nThough I did not start working at the Coca-Cola Star Lake Amphitheatre until the second season in 1991, I was keenly aware of the first season’s successes as well as some of the specific issues that had cropped up that needed a good sorting out. My friend Tom Rooney was executive director of the venue, and I remember talking with him—during that first season before I had joined--about the tailgating situation out at this 20,000+ capacity Washington County amphitheater near Pittsburgh, PA.\n\nAccording to Tom, as the first outdoor show of the inaugural 1990 season approached, his local amphitheater management team and Pace (the parent company in Houston, Texas) were both kind of hoping that tailgating wouldn’t break out in a big way and dig in its heels. Pretty much from the first show forward, however, it became quite apparent that tailgating was going to rule. As Tom subsequently explained to Corporate, the people of Pittsburgh had a strong, generations-long tradition of partying before Steeler games and these folks looked at tailgating not as a pastime but as a birthright.\n\nAnd so it was make-or-break. With the success of the venue at stake, tailgating came and stayed at The Lake...\n\nStar Lake has been around for 35 years as of this summer of 2024. It has changed names occasionally through the decades with the somewhat unpredictable shifts in the wind of high-dollar corporate investments in sponsorships, and so at present it is simply known as The Pavilion at Star Lake. One thing about the venue has been consistent, however—and that is the public’s undiminished love affair with tailgating.\n\nI have dipped into my memory bank and plucked out two anecdotes related to tailgating from my days at Star Lake. They’re poles apart, in a way. One tale drills down on one particular tailgater’s unbridled dissatisfaction, and the other is indicative of the festive spirit that more often prevailed out in the lots prior to shows.\n\nI conclude then with some brief accounts from a few peers of mine who managed, or had formerly managed, outdoor concert facilities. And for good measure, I included a couple of Star Lake vendors who had their own stories to spin.\n\nHave fun digging into these resurrected tales of tailgating. Most of them hail from the 1990s when amphitheaters the size of Star Lake were on the rise and popping up like mushrooms across the country, opening their doors—but first, of course, their lots--to eager concert fans whose rallying cry quickly became “Let the pregaming begin!”\n\nA TALE OF TAILGATING, #1\n\nIt was July 11, 1991. On that evening, Star Lake welcomed in a touring attraction entitled “The Music of Andrew Lloyd Webber” which featured a full orchestra, a chorus of twelve, and Michael Crawford, the Englishman who had risen to his highest levels of fame starring in The Phantom of the Opera. Truth be told, we just didn’t know at the time we booked this concert whether the upscale arts and culture crowd from Pittsburgh would trek all the way out to our venue. After all, we were about 25 miles from the heart of downtown. To our welcome surprise this show which featured Webber’s most memorable material from Phantom, Cats, Evita and Jesus Christ Superstar actually proved quite alluring to upscale Pittsburghers, and we experienced early success as the show went on sale and resulted in some quite nice ticket sales.\n\nOn the night of the show outside the gates we did have some tailgating—unsurprisingly a cut above the usual fare of beer and dogs on the grill—and on this stellar-weather evening all seemed right with the world. I remember thinking that, soon enough, we just might have the Pittsburgh patrons of the arts in the palm of our outstretched hand. Then early in the evening just as the show was starting, I got a call on my venue radio from the box office manager. She asked me if I could swing by her office right away, as there was a woman at the ticket window who had just emerged from the parking lot where she had been tailgating with friends. This woman, my box office manager said, had planted herself in line and declared she would not move until she was able to speak with someone in management.\n\nI hustled to the ticket window, identified myself, and asked this lavishly bedecked and resplendent middle-aged woman and her husband to please step aside with me to a nearby area to talk. The she let me have it. She laser beamed my eyes to hers, and said, slowly and deliberately, “I want a full ticket refund....plus $400.” She reached down and snatched one of the shoes from her feet and turned it upside down, waving it slowly in front of me. “THIS is what happened to me walking from my car to your front gate. My left shoe no longer has a heel because of the MOON ROCKS that you have in your sorry-excuse-for-a-parking-lot.”\n\nOf course this formerly well-heeled woman had a point. Some of our rear parking lot surfaces had yet to be rolled and smoothed over—let alone paved—as we were just now in our second year of existence and our budgets for such costly improvements were, for the time being, tabled. I refunded the couple’s tickets, and in lieu of the shoe replacement I promised them free tickets to another arts & entertainment event--but this time in downtown Pittsburgh. The woman accepted the offer but also made it abundantly clear she would never return to our lunar landscape lots ever again.\n\nIn future summers improvements were made in the lots with some additional lighting and some resurfaced expanses, so the upscale tailgating was not a lost cause. Certainly for the few highbrow events that Star Lake booked in the venue’s first handful of summers—like the evening with dance master Baryshnikov, and various Pittsburgh Symphony-backed performances from artists such as Bobby Vinton and Natalie Cole—the lots were dotted with tailgaters who did their pre-show best to elevate the art of fine outdoor dining. It wasn’t quite to the level of family heirloom silverware, white linen and candelabras, but there was some obvious care there to make each evening a special one.\n\nA TALE OF TAILGATING, #2\n\nI have great memories of Jimmy Buffett’s first decade at The Lake. He never took a pass on us, playing every single year from 1990 through 1999. And each spring when our venue finally would slip word to the media that Buffett was indeed headed back our way, there would be joyous shrieks and much beak clicking among his faithful. And come the morning of the day of the show, the Parrothead infestation of Star Lake would begin...\n\nWhat I loved most about the Buffett shows were the venue parking lots where concertgoers parked festooned campers and vans...propped up an overabundance of plastic palms...built lil sandy beaches...beat the heat via hot tubs...set up humungous drink-tube contraptions that looked like liquid hookahs...and much, much more. And I found out--early in Buffett’s rise to dominance and double-night engagements--that riding on the security golf cart patrols in the lots was where one could get lei’ed. Grass-skirted girls would ask you to slow down so they could gingerly drop one over your head as a peace offering, and this was but another reflection of the general vibe of the denizens of this parking lot Show and Tell. Smiles were everywhere and most senses were deliciously dulled as Buffett’s frolicking flock seemed ever so successful at temporarily packing away all the strife of life.\n\nLong before the first carload ever entered the grounds of Star Lake in order to tailgate, John Banovsky of Rain-Tec (one of our amphitheater’s most industrious and loyal subcontractors) would be placing the finishing touches on his homemade “active” volcano. He would then position it just opposite the Main Gate, up in a prime spot at the very visible edge of the parking lot.\n\nThis volcano was ten feet tall. And it emitted Vesuvius-like smoke out of its peak, courtesy of Banovsky’s creative melding of a fog machine and 3” PVC pipes housed within the structure. But the only thing that really erupted here was pure glee from a multitude of passers-by.\n\nSituated in this best spot in the lot, from early ‘til late, Banovsky’s annual creation would draw hundreds and hundreds of admiring coconut-bra’ed strollers who would stop by for a chat, clink cocktail glasses in toasts to his ingenuity, and oftentimes then stage themselves next to the mountainous puff daddy for a keepsake photo. This bit of bliss was impossible to miss...\n\np.s. I left the employment of Star Lake after the summer of 2007 in order to procure a position somewhere within the non-profit world, and so in 2012 when I caught up once again with Banovsky he had an update for me. He clued me in to a new addition to his Ol’ Smokey: a new featured attraction at his time-honored tailgating site which was an old service van that he had given a second life to. In this labor of love, he had converted the vehicle into a Landshark that was “completely painted,” he said, “with fins on the roof and a tail, and two beer taps out the side.” To me this was a fine testament to Banovsky’s motto for life, for his subcontractor work at the amphitheater, and for his above-and-beyond devotion to Star Lake’s Buffett concerts. In his words: “Hard work deserves great fun and relaxation!”\n\nA FEW MORE TALES OF TAILGATING...\n\nTom Rooney - former executive director of Star Lake 1990-1994\n\nMy tale is about the Grateful Dead at Star Lake circa the early 1990s…that’s a no-brainer. We were somewhat ready having scouted some other shows first. But the two-day show was like a bazaar of the bizarre out in the lots. All kinds of legal and probably illegal consumables and wearables, and the only thing the Dead management was interested in was the shutting down of the contraband merch. It was a like a 48-hour visit to another planet those two days...you could do a whole blog just on those two shows. When the tour left Star Lake and took the Deadheads with them, the acres of parking lots look like an abandoned battlefield. There was stuff everywhere not to mention a half dozen of dogs who missed their connections.\n\nWilson Rogers - former general manager of Star Lake during the 1990 inaugural season\n\nThe most enduring memory from that first year at Star Lake is of a dump truck full of sand that somehow got into the parking lot, and then dumped as the owner tailgated before the Buffett concert. A lot of sand, but they had even more tequila. The sand we later used for top dressing the lawn; I guess they drank the tequila.\n\nPat Lucas - formerly of the Pittsburgh office of TicketMaster which was Star Lake’s ticketing system\n\nSince I was always “working” when I visited Star Lake, I never tailgated in the traditional sense. But I did enjoy observing everyone else and made sure to work my way around the parking lot, especially for shows that were sure to pack the lot with all kinds of interesting people and parties. Two such artists vividly remain in my memory--those few Phish shows from the mid-90's that were exactly like the Dead tailgates at the arena in the mid-80s, except most of those folks partaking could be, and possibly were, the offspring of the original Deadheads. And those Buffett shows where there were more men than women in coconut-shell bikini tops and grass skirts, back before the mostly intolerable Parrotheads became geriatrics and then completely intolerable.\n\nBruce Friedman - former Star Lake third-party food vendor for some of those years—and a tailgater in others\n\nJuly 5, 2000 comes to mind most often. Yes and Kansas, two of my all-time favorite progressive concept bands. We were doing a “typical” style tailgate with kielbasa and hot sausage on the grill, and the aroma was wafting through the VIP parking area. There were at least twelve of us enjoying the food and libations when a golf cart pulled up asking what we were cooking. One of the occupants was particularly recognizable. Robbie Steinhart from Kansas spent the next twenty minutes or so with us enjoying not only one, but two huge kielbasa sandwiches and a couple of beers before he headed to work. It was one of those very memorable evenings at Star Lake (and there were many).\n\nTracy Tucker - former general manager of Columbus, Ohio’s large amphitheater Polaris (later on renamed Germain Amphitheatre)\n\nWhen I was new to the business as a young 22-year-old, we did Phish at the Columbus amphitheater. I was completely unprepared for the tailgating in the lots. I remember seeing tables full of goo balls covered with flies and people scarfing them down. There were lots of balloons being passed around as well. People had all their earthly possessions on their backs with their finger in the air asking for a prayer (a ticket to the show). Since then I have been through countless shows, but for that newbie back then it was quite an introduction!\n\nJoe Nieman – former Operations Director at Star Lake 1993-1995 and previous to that, in Operations at Riverbend Music Center in Cincinnati 1985-1992\n\nA memorable moment at Star Lake: Wrong place, wrong time. There was an unfortunate incident one year concerning tailgaters in the upper Star Lake parking lot who were trying to improve their tailgating position--they had backed into a light pole. The pole shook violently, and the heavy glass light-cover came crashing down on a woman's head. Luckily she was not seriously hurt.\n\nAn equally memorable moment at Riverbend Music Center: Tailgating on the water. Riverbend Music Center in Cincinnati OH sits on the banks of the Ohio River. Boats would often pull up to the venue and anchor up behind the backstage, and party on the water. Jimmy Buffett was recording a live album (Feeding Frenzy) sometime in the early '90s. The recording engineer was freaking out because the boat horns kept spiking the recording, making it unusable. We commandeered a small vessel and went boat to boat asking boaters to please refrain from hitting horns so the engineers could continue with the live recording. As instructed, our boating tailgaters waited until the show ended at 11 pm, and then all laid on their horns in Parrothead bliss. The Riverbend tracks made it onto the live recording.\n\n_______________________________________________________________________________\n\nPosted 7/7/24....YOU’RE THE INSPIRATION\n\nBack in 1969 I was an eleventh grader in high school, and I’ll be the first to admit that my musical horizons were somewhat limited back then. Part of the eventual expansion of my mind, though, was a result of having my friend Gary’s brother Dave as a musical guide. Dave Kleemann was a few years older than we were and he absolutely lived and breathed music. In one-on-one or small group situations, the way his eyes widened over his new band discoveries and the way he spat out those findings, I wouldn’t have been surprised to see G clefs fly out of his mouth if he’d been seized by an exceptionally violent cough.\n\n_______________________________________________________________________________\n\nPosted 6/23/24....BEGINNINGS\n\nAND\n\nWhen you drill down on the concert experience, whaddya have? A headliner of some stature that is your must-see, of course, but also the support act or acts who open the show. These openers can be artists you already know who are simpatico of sound, so that you can just ease into the evening with expectations set...or they can be unknowns whose musical style sparks enough interest to keep you seated...or they can be such an incongruous matchup with your tastes that you’re ready to bail for a bladder break and a peek at the lines at the brew stand.\n\nI went to many concerts beginning in the late 1960s and experienced some great shows early on, like the November 1967 concert at Pittsburgh’s Stanley Theatre with the Beach Boys and their openers the Strawberry Alarm Clock and—gasp!—the Buffalo Springfield. I also saw, under the wing of my friend Dan’s older brother who drove us to the show, a jaw-dropping performance by Janis Joplin and opening act Santana at the Pittsburgh Civic Arena in November 1969.\n\nI wondered even back then how certain artists ended up playing as warm-up to the headliners on a given tour, because there were some odd pairings “out there”—like the Jimi Hendrix Experience opening up for the Monkees on a handful of the latter’s tour dates in July 1967. Some could view this Monkee maneuver as a bid for respectability—adding a cutting-edge artist for cred—but the simple fact was that the wildly popular foursome from the TV show had just fallen in love with Hendrix’s onstage aura, especially after seeing him play live the month before at the Monterey Pop Festival.\n\nAccording to the website monkeeslivealmanac.com, though, the headliners soon gleaned that the audiences in large part were in no way mesmerized; they were mystified, then miffed. The website quotes Micky Dolenz from his autobiography in which he says “The parents were probably not too crazy about having to sit through a Monkees concert, much less see this black guy in a psychedelic Day-Glo blouse, playing music from hell, holding his guitar like he was fucking it, then lighting it on fire…Jimi would amble out onto the stage, fire up the amps and break into 'Purple Haze,' and the kids in the audience would instantly drown him out with, 'We Want Davy!!' God, it was embarrassing.\"\n\nFlash forward at least a couple of decades. It wasn’t until the 1990s that I more fully realized there was indeed a method to the madness of adding openers to tours. This realization came from my experience working at Star Lake Amphitheatre, the 23,000-capacity outdoor venue near Pittsburgh where summers were filled with forty-plus concerts every season. Not only did it become clear to me that the headliner/support dynamic was pretty much always structured, pre-tour, by artists’ managers and their booking agents, I also had the good fortune to witness a ton of shows with all kinds of pairings-up—the Good, the Bad and the Inscrutable. From the venue’s second season of operation in 1991 through the summer of 1999—my first nine years employed there—I was at the amphitheater for every single show. And there were 367 of them.\n\nThat first decade was crammed to the gills. Especially when it was still a toddler, the amphitheater hosted all sorts of genres—blues, classical, comedy, Christian music, jazz, pop, folk, rock, dance, and more. Some of these shows, pregnant with promise, turned into annual events. Others were tragically stillborn (which we deduced from our scan of their first-day ticket sales). Thankfully though, we also had the “automatics”—the headliners of the early 1990s like Billy Joel, New Kids on The Block, and the Grateful Dead; the mid-decade ascendants like the Dave Matthews Band and Alanis Morissette; and the artists who descended from the mountaintop and graced us with multiple sellouts like exalted hedonist Jimmy Buffett and crazy train conductor Ozzy Osbourne.\n\nSome major artists back then would choose to hit the road with an inexpensive no-name opener, or sometimes trot out on tour with no opener at all. Others glommed on to a truly synergistic support act that fit their genre nicely, or they brought on board one that fortuitously had a runaway hit record at that moment in time. Still others were persuaded by their manager and/or booking agent to pair up with an artist of equal footing to form a cool co-headlining situation for the summer.\n\nHere are some of my observations about that first decade of Star Lake shows, starting with three headlining acts who all share the distinction of playing Star Lake every single year from 1990 through 1999. Then we’ll touch on one other artist-plus-support scenario, before exploring the way that Star Lake supported local Pittsburgh artists over those first ten years of the amphitheater’s existence...\n\nJimmy Buffett Concerts...\n\nBuffett descended upon The Lake 15 times over the course of the decade, more than any other musical performer in that ten-year stretch: August 10, 1990...July 14, 1991...May 31, 1992...August 20, 1993...June 10 & 11, 1994...June 16 & 17, 1995...August 2 & 3, 1996...August 15 & 16, 1997...July 27 & 29, 1998...and June 17, 1999.\n\nRegarding Buffett’s opening acts, there are not a lot of household names here: his openers in the 1990s included Zachary Richard (1990 season), Fingers Taylor & The Ladyfingers Review (1991), Evangeline (1992), The Iguanas (1994), and Marshall Chapman (1995). Buffett in some years opted not to fill that opening slot, for he knew (as did we) that it didn’t really matter: Weren’t no one comin’ through those entry gates until Buffett took the stage and his first few chords rolled on out from the pavilion’s loudspeakers up...over...and into the vast expanse of the parking lots where the Glazed and Confused were all still partyin’ up a storm.\n\np.s. If pressed to pick my favorite opening act of the above five listed, I would absolutely say it would have to be The Iguanas. In that summer of 1994 Buffett was scheduled for a two-night engagement on June 10 and June 11, and that first night all hell broke loose—oh, wait; it was the heavens. They opened up.\n\nA massive storm quickly descended upon Star Lake and we had an incident that couldn’t be labeled anything but harrowing. Tom Rooney, currently president of the Rooney Sports & Entertainment Group based in Pittsburgh, was executive director of Star Lake back in 1994. Rooney remembers well what happened next. “Lightning made a direct hit on our venue’s main transformer rendering our sold-out show in darkness before Jimmy even hit the stage. We were standing on the backstage deck when we saw the bolt hit and we were all lucky to survive. We were saved by two things: the Iguanas, the opening act, traveled with a portable generator and Mark Susany, our electrician, ingeniously hooked it up on the main stage and we got (barely) through an unplugged show. The next day Buffett’s management required a full backup generator for every show, anywhere they played!”\n\nFor the record, even though Jimmy was at half-strength he still left the audience electrified. While our venue, of course, just missed being electri-fried.\n\nChicago Concerts...\n\nThis band, born in the late 1960s and later embraced by white-bread radio stations who kept the group’s hits alive for decades, played every single year from 1990 through 1999. They were consistent in another sense as well; judging from my backstage excursions on the days of their concerts, they seemed unfailingly happy and jazzed to be playing Star Lake every time they rolled into town. Onstage, the three original horn players—Lee Loughnane on trumpet, and flugelhorn, James Pankow on trombone and Walter Parazaider on saxophones and flute—could neither suppress smiles nor stand still, whether blowin’ out a solo or blasting through the choruses on their three-pronged attack. It is fair to say that Loughnane, Pankow and Parazaider had truly found their life’s calling, as these three founding members were intact for the band’s recordings and tours for a period of 47 years, 1969-2016.\n\nChicago’s openers and/or co-headliners at Star Lake through the years: The Flecktones (August 17, 1990), The Triplets (August 21, 1991), Moody Blues (June 18, 1992), Stephen Stills Band (June 13, 1993), Tony Janflone Jr. (August 13, 1995), Crosby, Stills & Nash (June 8, 1996), B.E. Taylor (July 26,1997 and August 22, 1998), and the Doobie Brothers (July 14, 1999).\n\nSteve Miller Band Concerts...\n\nHere is another ten-year veteran of Star Lake playdates like Buffett and Chicago, and principally through fans’ word of mouth Miller climbed from first-and-second-year attendances of 9,732 and 10,378 respectively to sellout status (20,000+) for the rest of the decade. Chronologically through the years, Miller’s show-openers for the most part were plucked from the pool of classic rockers: Lou Gramm (ex-lead singer of Foreigner; July 4, 1990), Eric Johnson (rock guitar wizard; July 23, 1991), Curtis Salgado & The Stilettos (blues-based, R&B-laced rock; July 23, 1992), Paul Rodgers (ex-lead singer of Free and Bad Company; June 20, 1993), The Doobie Brothers (July 22, 1995), Pat Benatar (July 20, 1996), Eric Johnson again (August 2, 1997), Little Feat (August 1, 1998), and George Thorogood & The Destroyers (July 24, 1999).\n\nAlthough all of the above support acts were viable in their own way, some of us at the venue experiencing this streak of Miller dominance felt that none were essential in helping the legendary classic rocker achieve the sell-outs that he consistently racked up eight years in a row (1992-1999). Miller was a ticket-moving marvel on his own, thanks to unceasing airplay of his mass appeal mid-‘70s hits on FM radio, and the fact that he had somehow ear-wormed a younger generation of fans through the likely pass-downs of Joker, Fly Like an Eagle and Book of Dreams from big brother and sister to younger siblings.\n\nBackstage at Star Lake at one of Miller’s sellout performances, I remember visiting his dressing room accompanied by his manager Scott Booray. The legendary classic rocker was in a great mood, so much so that he welcomed me heartily and off the bat half-jokingly suggested that I rename the venue “The Miller Dome” because of his sweet string of successes. I smiled and replied, “Steve, that would really be a worthy rechristening, but one problem: our official beer sponsor here is Budweiser, and can you imagine their delight upon hearing all of our radio and TV commercials directing people to come on out to the Miller Dome?” Miller winked at that one. “Hey,” he shrugged, “I thought I would give it a shot!”\n\nOne More Artist & Support Tale (the opening act is one of Musicasaurus’ favorite musicians)...\n\nCrosby, Stills & Nash with Michael Hedges, June 17, 1992 at Star Lake: CSN—or certainly at least C—had a friendship and mutual admiration society with guitarist Michael Hedges. In March 2018 Crosby, whose most recent album was Sky Trails, sat with Guitar.com writer Teri Saccone and at one point gushed effusively about certain musicians he considered to be at the pinnacle of their powers. “Lead players who elevate themselves above the pack are those who grow past the pentatonic blues scale and start playing pure melody,” Crosby said. “Beck, Gilmour, Clapton, Hendrix and Hedges: they could play anything they dream up because there’s no distance between fingertips and brain. They can play anything they desire. That’s where the rubber meets the road – the guitarists who are forever legends.”\n\nCrosby went on to say that Hedges was “the best acoustic player I ever heard in my life, anywhere.” Sacramento-born and Enid, Oklahoma-raised, Hedges became a fan of California’s folk-rock scene while honing his guitar skills, experimenting with unconventional guitar techniques like altered tunings and, according to the artist’s website michaelhedges.com, “innovative techniques such as left-hand tapping on multiple strings over the top of the guitar neck, extensive use of percussion on the body of the guitar, and unique rhythms and harmonic voicings.” In other words, his compositions and his execution of them seemed to be channeled from Above as if he had tapped into the Music of the Spheres...Hedges died quite expectedly in 1997 at the age of 43 when he was driving home from San Francisco International Airport and his car reportedly hit a rain-soaked curve and plummeted down a 120-foot embankment. A few months after his passing, his album Oracle won the 1997 Grammy Award for Best New Age Album.\n\nPittsburgh Artists That Played Star Lake on the Main Stage or on the Venue’s Second Stage...\n\nAs noted above in the recap of the band Chicago’s appearances at Star Lake, a couple of local artists from the Pittsburgh market served as the band’s opening act on the main stage—guitarist Tony Janflone Jr. at one of their shows, and B.E. Taylor at two of their Star Lake stops. It is important to recognize that our amphitheater, in addition to hosting major attractions, felt that it was important in this first decade of existence to welcome in a number of local Pittsburgh artists to fill certain available slots on the main stage as well as on the venue’s popular second stage. The second stage was located just inside the facility’s main gate in the upper West Plaza, and fans became accustomed to seeing and hearing a number of viable, exciting local artists perform there prior to the main stage event.\n\nJune 16, 1990...The first-ever concert at Star Lake was The WDVE Open House Rocker, and its stellar lineup on the main stage included Donnie Iris & The Cruisers, Joe Grushecky & The Houserockers, Billy Price & The Keystone Rhythm Band, The Zippers, and The Clarks.\n\nMay 13, 1995...Rusted Root headlined a concert with support act Toad the Wet Sprocket. This main stage show sold out at 23,183 tickets.\n\nMay 24, 1997...May 9, 1998...and June 5,1999...The Surge Festival. The Surge Festival, an assemblage of noteworthy musical acts from the Pittsburgh region, was held three years in a row with most artists performing on the main stage. Three of the most popular groups in the Surge lineups were The Clarks, The Gathering Field and Brownie Mary, all of whom in the mid-to-late 1990s were organically building up their fan bases and individually inking (or preparing to ink) contracts with record labels.\n\nThese concerts were cause for jubilation. There was an infectious joy shared by the bands, the fans and all of us who worked at Star Lake, and this was especially evident at the first Surge on Saturday, May 24, 1997. The core lineup of the aforementioned three buzz-makers was extended to include a number of other local groups, and the event was priced very reasonably at $10.25 per ticket which tied back to our promotional partner WDVE’s 102.5 radio dial position. The show went on sale, and then never lagged. With WDVE’s on-air support and a robust sense of pride welling up in the ‘burgh, this multi-act concert went on to sell almost 19,000 tickets. Having this homegrown concert end up a runaway success was certainly $weet, but for me, sweeter still was the camaraderie in full flower backstage while out in front, scores of fans showed their true hometown colors with every celebratory roar for the bands who walked out on that stage. This was a great day.\n\nJune 6, 1998...The Pittsburgh All-Stars concert, a roundup of the region’s legends, featured Donnie Iris & The Cruisers, Joe Grushecky & The Houserockers, B.E. Taylor, The Corbin-Hanner Band, Billy Price, and Glenn Pavone & The Cyclones.\n\nBetween 1995 and 1999...The following local artists, among others, appeared on the venue’s second stage during this time period; they played sets prior to the start of the main stage activities: ATS, Rasta Rafiki, The Fabulous Gunslingers, Airborne, The Nixon Clocks, John McDonald & The Mango Men, Mark Eddie, Lee Alverson, Eugene & The Nightcrawlers, The Tim Stevens Project, The El Monics, Stone Ridge Band, Double Deuce, Barbwire Dolls, Ploughman’s Lunch, Karl Shuman Band, Jill West & The Blues Attack, G-Force, Sputzie & The Soul Providers, D.O.S.E., Dharma Sons, The Frampton Brothers, The Ike McCoy Band, House of Soul, Sho’Nuff, and The Flow Band...A resurrected “thanks!” must go out to all of these talents once again for participating in these landmark hometown shows!\n\n________________________________________________________________________________\n\nPosted 5/26/24....GOING DOWN THE ROAD FEELING BAD\n\nIf a survey was sent out to southwestern Pennsylvania concert fans with regard to the Pittsburgh market’s large outdoor amphitheater—originally named Coca-Cola Star Lake Amphitheatre > then Post-Gazette Pavilion > First Niagara Pavilion > KeyBank Pavilion > and now the Pavilion at Star Lake—it would make great sense, of course, to ask for their opinions about the current summer season’s lineup, their likes and dislikes, etc.\n\nAnd I’d wager that if an open-ended question was included in the survey that asked about areas that needed to see some improvement, many fans’ feedback in this instance would predominantly consist of just one word: Traffic.\n\nOr maybe TRAFFIC (written in an all-caps emphasis). Or perhaps TRAFFIC!!! (with all caps and three exclamation points). Or maybe there wouldn’t be the word “traffic” at all, with a grawlix placed there instead (a grawlix is defined as a series of typographical symbols used in text as a replacement for profanity). Hence, it might look something like this: @#*&*%#!!! I am thinking the more astute of the survey tabulators just might catch on, though, and x-out the grawlix while writing in the “T” word.\n\nThere was a recent article on Pittsburgh’s TribLIVE.com about the trials and tribulations of several fans experiencing traffic woes on the way out to, and then into, the Pavilion at Star Lake. But the venue has tried over the years to do its best to ameliorate the negative effects of a sad-but-true reality—huge shows draw sellout crowds which lead to jammed roadways and a particularly pinched entranceway.\n\nI was the general manager of Coca-Cola Star Lake Amphitheatre-turned-Post-Gazette Pavilion during the span of 1995 through 2007 and as I start to reflect back on those days of traffic challenges, Willie Nelson’s voice is in my mind’s ear skittering about, softly reminding me of how often that issue had loomed large for me: “You were always on my mind.”\n\nOne weekend morning in the beginning of the summer of 2005, I remember running into an old acquaintance in a downtown coffee shop. While I waited in line for my half-double decaffeinated half-caf with a twist of lemon (alright, that wasn’t my order, but I always wanted to use that line from the movie L.A. Story), my acquaintance sipped the foam off his brew and asked where I was working now. When I mentioned that I ran the amphitheater, he said “Oh, I’ve never been out there. I heard the traffic was horrible at that Billy Joel concert.” I think I may have gently reached out and touched his arm, to make a point. “Bob,” I said, “you DO know that the Billy Joel show was fifteen years ago, in the venue’s first season. You might want to give it another shot.”\n\nSo it was pretty much always like that, in terms of the one major complaint that a number of fans perhaps rightfully glommed onto and occasionally buttonholed me on. The traffic situation, for some, was something that stuck in their craw to the point of driving them beyond reason. Admittedly, there must be something about being in a car, at a crawl, on a highway, still about two miles away from the venue, with a full bladder and brain brimming over with steaming, righteous indignation. I imagine that this highway paralysis led many to think, if not bark out loud, “What in the HELL is going on? WHAT ARE THESE PEOPLE DOING?!!”\n\nThe “these people” reference, of course, relates to the parking lot personnel at the venue. Talk about a thankless job, these folks were on the front line. They were the first amphitheater staffers to greet the patrons as they drove into the facility and instead of smiles and a thumbs-up, our people saw blood-vessel-popped foreheads and a finger-up.\n\nBy 1994, the venue’s fifth season, the lines of cars to get into the facility—and conversely to exit the facility—on the biggest shows of the summer were legendary. That same year we booked a classic rock band who hadn’t toured in two decades, the much revered late ‘60s-early ‘70s group Traffic featuring multi-instrumentalist Steve Winwood and drummer/percussionist Jim Capaldi. As we rolled out news of this particular booking in all of our marketing efforts, the jabs and jokes poured in from concert fans: “I hear Traffic’s at the amphitheater; I’m sorry—is that news?!!” ..... and ..... “Traffic at Star Lake? First time in 20 years? BULLSHIT!!!”\n\nTo complicate things and truly seal our fate, out on the highway at that point in time there was evil afoot. In the form of the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation. Looking back on this, having been rubbed raw by continuing frustrations with traffic, I kind of came to feel that PennDOT was worse than Al-Qaeda, SPECTRE, KAOS, Wall Street and every other dastardly criminal enterprise combined. There was just one stretch of highway as the last part of the journey from Pittsburgh out to the venue—Route 22/30—and PennDOT (it seemed to me) took great pleasure in erecting work zones and lane restrictions for a number of our summers of operation especially in the 1990s. The effect on the venue was palpable. We were inflicted with outraged fans and bad PR, everywhere we turned...\n\nMy frustrations boiled over and I actually sought a form of tongue-in-cheek revenge. In the late 1990s before the start of a new season, I had an idea for a new game for our plaza entertainment areas inside the venue. We already had a basketball set-up and a football toss as part of our pre-concert fun for fans but I then turned to Shag, our facility operations guru, to develop a brand new offering that would be modeled after the time-honored beanbag throw. The twist was that this game would be a means for our fans—the ones bewitched, bothered and bewildered by traffic—to let off some steam from the snail-like odyssey that they had likely just experienced on the way out to the show.\n\nWe decided the game would be a beanbag toss to knock down three items that were going to be lined up on a countertop about twelve feet away, and each lucky soul who aced the three shots would win a prize. The three knock-down items? They were little orange and white barrels, 12” high and 8” in diameter, patterned after their big bad-ass cousins that PennDOT routinely used out on the roadways to ensnarl traffic and enrage our customers.\n\nWe christened this game “The PennDOT Shot” and when we had it all set up in the East Plaza, we hung up a colorful sign as a backdrop. By directly acknowledging our nemesis via this fun little game, we hoped our fans would see a bit of humor in the situation and pull out a buck to pelt PennDOT (we knew they’d much rather be barreling down the road unencumbered, but at least here in the East Plaza they could revel in revenge and retribution).\n\nOur new game turned out not to be a hit. The hoops and the football toss continued to pull in a solid amount of revenue per concert, but the PennDOT Shot never caught on as a moneymaker; perhaps the fans had decided to drown their sorrows in suds instead. We then retired our tiny barrels after a season or two of disappointing returns.\n\nTo be clear, we did pursue real options as well, of course, to address the traffic situation. Complicating our plight, though, was the fact that our amphitheater had just one vehicle entranceway/exit—the four-to-five lanes that then spread and fed all of our parking lots that were adjoining the fence lines of our venue. We worked unceasingly with our parking personnel and traffic duty police officers to eke out the best and fastest flow of incoming/exiting traffic, yet on the largest shows—how else can I say this?—we were screwed.\n\nThe worst traffic trauma came on weekdays between the hours of 5:30pm and 7:30pm, when concertgoers were all headed out to the venue from Pittsburgh after a pit stop at home to shed their work duds. These fans then got caught up in the larger weekday commuter crush, and so thousands of cars—some concert-bound, some headed home—were all converging on the Pittsburgh parkway and then Route 22/30, headed in the general direction of the amphitheater. When this wonderful world of wheels then hit the dreaded PennDOT stretch, our fans were forced into some serious brake dancin’—and their eager anticipation became vehicular vexation.\n\nFor one of Tom Petty’s sold-out shows at our venue which had fallen on a weekday, we tried every which way to ameliorate the traffic on the ingress. We heavily promoted “Free Parking Before 6:00 PM!” and “Free Food & Beverage Coupons!” in all of our pre-concert radio and newspaper promotions, hoping that fans would respond to these enticements and head out to the venue early for tailgating. Not a whiff of success here. The fans either missed our messaging or didn’t care quite enough, or perhaps the predominant reason was that they were essentially chained to their weekday schedules and couldn’t adjust the timing of their concert commute.\n\nAnd then there was the Lilith Fair in 1997, the very cool concert celebration of women that was conceived, molded, and mounted to a national touring level by Canadian musician/singer-songwriter Sarah McLachlan. The buzz was so high on Lilith Fair that we pretty much sold all of the concert tickets in advance, yet we took a gamble on the day of the show, allowing a few more cars into our lots so that these folks could buy tickets at the box office (note: our venue capacity was governed more by the number of cars in the lots, and not so much by the number of people in the venue; with our very sizable lawn, we could cram to our heart’s content and squeeze everybody in.)\n\nOur parking plan backfired. Way more people than expected had hopped on the highway hoping to buy their tickets at the gate, and so we literally, at a certain point in the evening, had to turn cars away at the top of the hill. These late-arrivals—some of whom had already purchased their tickets—could now not enter the parking lots. There was No More Room at the Inn. And these people were pissed. The fans and followers of Lilith Fair, because of the nature of this female-oriented festival, were mostly women—and now we could hear them roar in numbers too large to ignore (yes, I’m pretty much always Reddy with a song reference).\n\nWe had a bit of a saving grace though, in our immediate neighbor to the south—the Pepsi-Cola Roadhouse. The folks there allowed us on occasion to use their parking lot as an emergency overflow site, and so we sent a wave or two of the Lilith travelers down there. These particular parkers were thus able to find an actual spot after all, but it was a bit of a hike over to our venue from there and so their nice little stroll usually ended at one of our customer service booths for some venting, teeth gnashing and tongue lashing.\n\nThat was pretty much the worst of it. We had tried earnestly through the 1990s and into the 2000s to improve the customer experience and beat back the bad press, tackling the traffic situation through as many measures as we could dream up. These measures included 1) hiring Michael Baker, a leading engineering and consulting services company, to do a study of the “ingress” and the “egress” of traffic flow within our lots...2) implementing and then maintaining a roundtrip bus service for fan transportation from the compass points around Pittsburgh through a partnership with Lenzner Coach Lines...3) continuing to heavily promote early arrival by opening the parking lots in the early afternoon on major shows...and 4) ultimately deciding to change the mode of collecting our parking fee, converting from collection at the parking lot entranceway to incorporation of that fee within the price of the concert ticket. This last move in particular saved precious time for our fans on the ingress, as they subsequently found they could sail right by our parking staff instead of stopping to pay.\n\nIn a perfect world, the concert experience should be every fan’s delight, a night of great music and socializing with friends, capturing memories that last a lifetime. And the amphitheater did and still does try to make fans feel like they hadn't just spent a lifetime getting there.\n\nToday, as most of us (I think) would admit, reality says that it likely remains a work in progress.\n\n_______________________________________________________________________________\n\nPosted 5/26/24....MOTHER AND CHILD REUNION\n\nThis is a special edition of Musicasaurus in a couple of ways:\n\n1) My most recent post was on May 19, and normally the next one would follow two weeks afterward--in this case, on June 2. But I am jumping ahead of schedule here so that I can squeeze this particular post into the month of May which is, of course, the month in which Mother’s Day is celebrated. So this is important. Because moms are important.\n\n2) The following was originally written and posted in 2013 and it is an interview I had conducted with my mom who had just turned 83 (I realized at that time that I was long overdue in getting this woman on record about her life and how music had figured into her world). Alison Guthrie Jones lived to be 90 years old and passed away on September 25, 2021. You are missed, Mom, but I know that you continue to rest in peace...\n\n[The following was originally written and posted on Mother’s Day 2013]\n\nThis is the tale of a wonderful tale that unfolded in the form of an interview with my 83-year-old mother Alison Guthrie Jones on Mother’s Day. We had an early dinner out at an Italian restaurant in our hometown of Butler, PA and then subsequently retired to her duplex’s sunny dining room, sitting down at a table in front of sliding glass doors that afforded a beautiful view of her tiny patio. Outside there were two deck chairs, a stocked bird feeder and a hanging basket—the latter a crimson-colored begonia courtesy of a son who loves her.\n\nAlison is a Butler girl, born and raised. She’s alternately warm, feisty, quick to laugh, at the core very gentle, and now and again a bit impatient with her foibles and forgetfulness. I figured it was high time to explore with her a subject that was near and dear to my heart, so with a tiny recorder in hand I sat down at the dining room table and essentially surprised her with the request to get some of her thoughts on the subject of music.\n\nI want to ask you some questions; it’s very informal, just pickin’ your brain...\n\nGo ahead. Oh, there’s a blue jay....oh, it flew away. Go ahead, honey.\n\nObviously I’ve been into music most of my life, starting at a pretty early age. But what about you? Do you remember, as a young person, listening to much music? Did your parents have a record player? Did they buy records?\n\nOh, yes. We had records by Tommy Dorsey, Frank Sinatra, Benny Goodman and others.\n\nAnd that’s the stuff your parents were listening to?\n\nWell, yes. What happened was, whenever more and more of these records started coming out my dad bought a radio that a drawer slid out, and we could play our 78s on there. So they liked the music, yes. But I guess I played it too loud. Or at least that’s what my father said...Your Uncle Inky had a barbershop here in Butler, actually in Lyndora, and Markew’s was right beside it. It was a bar with a jukebox. Well, sometimes the records were getting old in there and they were putting new ones in, so they gave some of the old ones to Ink, and Ink would give them to me. So I had a lot of records before I even liked much music.\n\nSo this was the late 1930s and through the 1940s, and the records were Tommy Dorsey, and things like that?\n\nYes, and Harry James. I loved Harry James.\n\nYou got married at the age of twenty, in 1950. Before that, when you were a teenager in high school, what was your social life like? Did you and your girlfriends drive around, go to dances, drink beer, what?\n\nMy girlfriends and I didn’t have beer, but if we were out with our boyfriends, THEY had some. Yes, we did go to dances. High school dances, one in Lyndora and one down Route 8 towards Pittsburgh, which young people used to go to.\n\nWas there a deejay?\n\nNo deejays. Just a jukebox.\n\nYou went to these places, and there were just jukeboxes?\n\nYes, but then we also went to dances where some of the boys we knew played in a band, and they were really good. Dances were fun. I remember after we were married, your father and I were in Erie with Dee Dee and Nick, and we jitterbugged to the music of Bill Haley & The Comets.\n\nYou could jitterbug to Bill Haley?\n\nOh, yes. Also we went to see some live music—Tommy Dorsey and Stan Kenton in New Castle. I always wanted to see Sammy Kaye—sing and sway with Sammy Kaye—but I never did. We loved to dance, but not that stuff like “The Fish”—\n\nYou mean “The Swim”?\n\nYes, The Swim, those later-on dances. We were either slow dancing or jitterbugging back then. I did go to a square dance once while still in high school, and I almost wet my pants.\n\nWhy?!!\n\nMy girlfriend Helen invited me. Some older guy grabbed Helen and took her out on the floor, and then some guy grabbed me, but I was laughing so hard that I almost wet myself. All that spinning and changing partners, and goin’ so fast—it was a riot.\n\nHow did you find out about new groups or new releases from singers and musicians that you liked?\n\nWe used to go to Trader’s in Butler, and they had booths. They were a music store down there on Main Street across from the gas company; they had little booths where you could listen to records...I can’t remember when the little records (45s) came out, but that’s where I bought my records.\n\nWhat kind of music did Dad like?\n\nBlues and jazz. He loved Stan Getz, and especially Ella Fitzgerald. He had loads of records by her. I never particularly liked her that well. He liked her voice; I didn’t...Dad and I liked pretty much liked the same music, though. In the 80s we started listening to WISH-FM, the Pittsburgh station that played soft rock. We both liked that, when he retired.\n\nI remember your 45s when I was very young—That song “Party Doll” by Buddy Knox, “Kansas City” by Wilbert Harrison, and the Elvis Presley ones you had...\n\nOh, you imitated Elvis all of the time. You pretended you had a guitar.\n\nWas I holding a broom or something?\n\nNo, just pretending to have a guitar; you didn’t hold anything. And you made gyrations, but not the bad ones that Elvis did. You and your brother used to entertain Aunt Betty and her boyfriend in the living room at our house. His name was Joe, I think. You and your brother also used to do comedy routines for all of us.\n\nIn the early ‘60s, the Beatles came over to America for the first time and appeared on the Ed Sullivan show. It might have been those camera shots of female hysteria in the audience, but I remember Dad saying “They’ll never last.”\n\nWell, I’d say they lasted pretty long...You had your haircut in bangs and cut short, you know. Like Paul McCartney.\n\nSo you liked the Beatles, and other groups that came out in the ‘60s?\n\nI liked The Monkees, too. I loved the TV show.\n\nThe ‘60s unleashed a lot of different artists & styles in music; did you ever get concerned with what I was listening to?\n\nI just didn’t like some of that hard rock stuff you were listening to...I remember I liked Carly Simon when I first heard her, but not James Taylor until much later on. And I started liking Rod Stewart when you gave me a CD of his, and I thought to myself “I’m not going to like this”—but I DID! I remember you got me backstage to meet Rod Stewart when you worked at the amphitheater.\n\nThat’s right. Do you remember how that went?\n\nGood. He said “Hello there.” And I said, “You know, I am probably the same age as your mother but I still enjoy you.” He smiled, but then he left.\n\nHe left?\n\nWell, he went to talk to the guy behind me. I’m sure after their shows these performers are all hyped up and they just want to relax. Somebody did take a picture of Rod and me, but you never got me the picture.\n\nI didn’t? I don’t remember anyone taking your picture.\n\nSome friend of yours did, and he was supposed to mail it to you—but you never got me the picture.\n\nSorry, Mom.\n\nIt would have been nice to look at it now.\n\nHmmm...Your one opportunity to have a photo with a big rock star, and I failed you.\n\nIt was tragic! (laughs)\n\nDid you ever meet anybody else out there at the amphitheater?\n\nWell, you got me backstage to meet Judy Garland but she didn’t come out after the show to meet anybody, but she did put on a wonderful show—wait, it wasn’t Judy Garland, it was her daughter.\n\nLiza Minnelli?\n\nYes, Liza Minnelli. But what a terrific show she put on....and her dancers and singers, I remember well. They weren’t all skinny and pretty; they were all sizes, and I thought that was wonderful. She didn’t just have beautiful girls up there. I saw Cher out there, too. And she was fantastic.\n\nYou probably had great seats, too. Because you had a son that truly loved you.\n\nThat’s right. I didn’t like Barry Manilow, though, when I saw him. He didn’t have any back-ups; it made it boring.\n\nI’ve heard that he talks to the audience a lot between songs; true?\n\nHe said to the crowd “To all you guys who hated to come here tonight, I know how you feel.” Oh, and I saw Bette Midler out there. She was GOOD...Who else did I see? Let me tell you about one I really loved.\n\nWho was that?\n\nThe singer in that Music of Andrew Lloyd Webber show.\n\nMichael Crawford.\n\nYes...I couldn’t go to that amphitheater concert, but you got us tickets for him at the Benedum Theatre later on, in...the late ‘90s?\n\nYou saw Sinatra too, right?\n\nYes, at the arena. I think with Sammy Davis Jr.\n\nThat’s right...and that was the concert where Dean Martin was supposed to play as well, but he didn’t make it to the Pittsburgh show because of an illness. That tour with the three of them was called “Ol’ Blue Eyes, Red Eyes and One Eye”. That wasn’t the official name of the tour, but that’s what we industry insiders called it.\n\nHe was probably plastered...Did you ever know if some of these groups were drunk or anything?\n\nNo, I never ran into any artists who looked in really bad shape...I do remember Ozzy Osbourne had some struggles before he took the stage at the amphitheater a few times, and there was a doctor backstage who gave him B Vitamin shots just to get him focused enough to go on.\n\nWhat did she ever see in him? His wife is pretty, and his daughter is pretty. I can’t stand him.\n\nI remember in the late ‘60s bringing home a couple of new albums by Cream and Buffalo Springfield...and you overhearing the Buffalo Springfield record and saying “That’s too twangy country.”\n\nI said that? I really like some of the country music now (looks out the dining room glass door) There’s that bluejay again. And the cardinals. I wonder what’s in that feed I give them...Your Dad and I really liked that one program, “For the World?” Is that it? “For the World?” Whatever it was, we tuned into that.\n\nWe Are the World?\n\nMaybe. I know it was around the same time your dad finished the deck out back. You called and asked what we were doing, and I told you we were watching the program, and you said that you were pretty sure you wouldn’t find many other parents who were doing the same thing.\n\nOh, that was the Live Aid concert. In 1985.\n\nThat’s it.\n\nI remember you liked Neil Young and Leon Russell, but when you first asked me about them, you said “Please play me some of that Neil Simon”...and...“Do you have anything by that Leon Uris?”\n\n(Mom giggles)\n\nDidn’t you also like the band Chicago?\n\nYES! They were terrific; you’ve put them on some of your mixes for me...They were good in concert. Who comes and plays Star Lake Amphitheater these days?\n\nWell, there are more country artists than there used to be, starting around the early 2000s.\n\nOne time I went there with Joelle (niece) to see the guy who has the blonde hair and the hat.\n\nMom, that could be one of a few country stars...\n\nHe had a mustache and blonde hair. And he just stood there. I was so bored that I thought I’d scream. He had people playing with him, but he just stood there.\n\nAlan Jackson?\n\nYes, that was him. I wanted to see Alabama but never made it out there.\n\nDid you see Tim McGraw?\n\nNo, but I like that song he does about his dad. And I know his wife is absolutely gorgeous, and they have three girls. But she screams when she sings. My friends think that, too.\n\nWhat was the trip to Star Lake Amphitheatre that you remember the most?\n\nWell, who was the guy from Florida?\n\nUh...Are you thinking of Jimmy Buffett?\n\nYes, I went to see him twice when you got me tickets. Anyhow, we were drinking beer so I didn’t care about the music that much.\n\nYou might have just summed up the whole Buffett concert experience.\n\nThe last time I went I was in my early ‘70s, I think. Bob and I and another couple went to the concert, and Bob’s friend had a thing for big boobs. So when we were out in the parking lots walkin’ along, walkin’ along, he was hoping to see some girls pull up their T-shirts. And finally one girl did. And he thought that was just wonderful.\n\nOne more question, Mom. Say you had to go to a deserted island to live the rest of your days--what ONE album or CD would you take with you?\n\nCan it be a CD that somebody made? Like one of your mixes?\n\nTechnically, no. But it IS Mother’s Day today. If you want to, go ahead.\n\nNo, that’s okay. Hmmm...Probably that Michael Crawford album with the girl who sang with him...\n\nSarah Brightman? Wasn’t that the “Music of Andrew Lloyd Weber” compilation?\n\nI think so...I think it had a bunch of different songs on it. But it was just beautiful, and that’s the one I’d take along with me.\n\nI think we’re done, Mom. AND...thanks SO much for doing this!\n\nAlright, my son. Thank you.\n\n_______________________________________________________________________________\n\nPosted 5/19/24....EVERY PICTURE TELLS A STORY\n\n...\n\nThis is Yours Truly in the time period of 1978-1980 when I worked for Warner/Elektra/Atlantic Corporation (WEA Corp), the marketing and distribution arm of the three aforementioned major record companies and their subsidiary labels. I was responsible for creating WEA artist displays in chain-owned and independent record stores in the Pittsburgh market and beyond, periodically branching out to cover satellite markets such as Youngstown, Ohio and Wheeling, W VA. Taking stock of this photo of myself now, forty-plus years down the road, I would use these words to more than adequately describe me: Scruffy but Super Conscientious. Armed with tape, scissors, staple gun and fervent desire to plaster up posters in every nook and cranny of every record store in my realm, I totally dedicated myself to Warner/Elektra/Atlantic. I had drunk the Kool-Aid, for sure. It was almost as if Freddy Mercury—yes, a WEA artist on the Elektra label--was belting out a message directly to me: “WEA the champions, my friends, and we’ll keep on fighting ‘til the end...”\n\nNOTE: All of the events and happenstances below took place in the two-year period of 1978 through 1980.\n\nTHE AREAS WITHIN STORES THAT WERE MY OPTIONS FOR DISPLAY SPACE\n\nI found out soon after I landed the WEA display job that each record store—whether a stand-alone or one in a mall--was different in terms of the space that the managers accorded for displays of new album releases. But after a while on my prescribed cycle of store visits, I found enough spots within each location to give WEA its due. The photos immediately below illustrate this...\n\nFor Fleetwood Mac and Badfinger, I snatched storefront window opportunities.\n\nFor the Superman movie soundtrack and Neil Young’s Rust Never Sleeps, I went with spaces above the long stretches of wall racks that showcased the store’s new releases and best-sellers.\n\nFor jazz artists Pat Metheny, Keith Jarrett and others on the ECM label—who only provided me with enlarged black and white photos at that point in time--I used the areas that were beneath those aforementioned long stretches of wall racks.\n\nFor Rickie Lee Jones’ self-titled debut I chose an endcap (the end of one of the store’s freestanding floor bins of albums).\n\nFor Ry Cooder’s Bop till You Drop album I utilized the archways and above-the-counter space in a mall store.\n\nFor Judy Collins’ new release, I staked out a claim for the bottom of the store’s front counter.\n\nAnd for the Rolling Stones I achieved new heights by replacing a couple of the store’s drop-down ceiling panels with a 2’x2’ styrofoam-backed reproduction of the album cover.\n\nDISPLAYS A BIT BEYOND THE TRADITIONAL APPROACH OF JUST POSTERS AND ALBUM COVERS\n\nRickie Lee Jones and Van Halen\n\nWith only a limited amount of space in one store, I chose to combine Rickie Lee Jones with Van Halen since the materials were kind of crammed together anyway. In one photo you’ll note I placed the Van Halen logo in her mitts, and the other photo shows her “lighting her cigar” via the flaming hairdo of David Lee Roth.\n\nMichael Franks\n\nAt this Peaches store in Bethel Park in 1979 I gained a whole front window to devote to Michael Franks’ new release Tiger in the Rain, and so I spent some bucks on a tiger cub statue, covered his head with a plastic rain bonnet, and threw some umbrellas into the mix.\n\nThe Henry Paul Band\n\nThis was a window display I concocted for NRM’s campus store in the Oakland section of Pittsburgh, and it revolved around Grey Ghost, the Henry Paul Band’s debut album on Atlantic Records. This 1979 release, through its title and through an included song by that name, reverentially referred to singer Ronnie Van Zant who perished along with a few other Lynyrd Skynyrd members in the band’s fateful airplane crash of 1977. Once this Grey Ghost display was up and in view, I received a diplomatic call from the Atlantic Records area promotion person who told me Henry Paul was coming to town, and that the fleshless face of the grey ghost in my display might not be the best thing for him to stumble upon. I gave up the ghost.\n\nBlack Sabbath\n\nIn staying true to the cover of Black Sabbath’s Never Say Die! album and attempting to amplify that connection, I borrowed my friend Gary Uram’s mannequin head and torso and outfitted it appropriately. Not sure I remember where I found the gas mask, but rest assured I hadn’t owned one; in other words, it wasn’t from any collection of materials I might have gathered up previously for an end-of-the-world bunker. I wasn’t at that stage—uh, yet.\n\nShaun Cassidy\n\nI had some fun with this teen idol’s display, keying in on the album’s title and wrapping Cassidy in swirls of plastic. I cannot remember if I entertained the idea of leaving him any breathing room. Perhaps subconsciously I was making a statement on his music and my desire to shorten its shelf-life.\n\nDevo\n\nThe photo on the left illustrates the display materials sent to me by WEA for Devo’s debut album Q: Are We Not Men? A: We are Devo! The one above-and-beyond attention-getting display item that really drew in the curious was a full-sized Devo yellow suit. After I had done a number of displays around Pittsburgh on behalf of the band and was about to send my pictures on to my boss in WEA’s Cleveland office, a friend named John “Pappy” Papinchak offered to suit up for me. He wanted me to have this kind of lively action shot to send along with the usual batch of the more standard store window and wall photos. Pappy, who was the kindest of souls, a true music hound, and an accomplished photographer who often freelanced for music industry folks in the Pittsburgh market, passed away in April 2020 at the age of 67. This one’s for you, Pappy.\n\nARTIST APPEARANCES AT RECORD STORES AND ARTISTS COMING INTO TOWN FOR CONCERTS\n\nAshford & Simpson\n\nOne of the duties of the WEA field merchandiser was to cover in-store appearances of artists who were coming to town as part of their concert tours. Certain performers “got it”—they realized how beneficial it was to their careers to spend a bit of time early afternoon on a show day to meet and greet their fans. They also knew that doing so at one of the chosen market’s biggest record stores—often, but not always, a chain store--was key to keeping their product top of mind with the largest local record retailers.\n\nAshford & Simpson, the popular soul/rhythm & blues duo who were married in music and in life, came to Pittsburgh for a show and agreed to do an appearance in the National Record Mart (NRM) in the Oakland section of Pittsburgh. I slathered up posters for backdrop before the pair arrived, and aided (a bit) the NRM folks who were making sure the flow of fans didn’t impede the ringing of cash registers at the front of the store.\n\nHenry Paul Band\n\nThe aforementioned Henry Paul Band came together when guitarist/singer-songwriter Paul exited The Outlaws in 1977 and formed his own group. They toured through the Pittsburgh market and agreed to a meet-and-greet at one of NRM’s off-branded superstores, the Oasis Records & Tapes location in the Bloomfield section of Pittsburgh. The band’s appearance there paved the way for an invitation from NRM management to attend, and to perform at, the upcoming annual NRM convention scheduled at that point in time to take place in Pittsburgh. This was always an informative and fun two-or-three day gathering of over 70 NRM store managers and record company bigwigs who would flock there to curry favor and build connections with those who pushed their product.\n\nRoxy Music\n\nThat mannequin head and torso belonging to my friend Gary Uram—the one I deployed in the aforementioned Black Sabbath display--came in handy once again. I patterned this display after the album cover for Roxy Music’s Manifesto release, and it was situated in the front window of a downtown NRM location that was near the storied concert venue called the Stanley Theatre. I went backstage with the Pittsburgh market Atlantic Records rep on April 9, 1979 and met the band, and I remember Bryan Ferry and Phil Manzanera in particular smiling over this particular photo.\n\nLarry Carlton\n\nThe photos above are related to an appearance in Pittsburgh by the almost famous and quite fiery, nimble-fingered session guitarist Larry Carlton. Carlton had stepped out on his own in 1978 to release a self-titled solo album on the Warner Bros. label. The NRM window display shown above promotes the upcoming Thin Lizzy/Larry Carlton concert at the Stanley Theatre, and in the four-man photo, Carlton is third from the left with Pittsburgh-area Warner Bros. promotion rep Mark Wallace beside him on the end.\n\nCarlton had agreed to an afternoon hotel room schmooze with key management folks from NRM and a couple of other record retailers, and so beforehand I fashioned displays in the room for emphasis and ambience. I also got the bright idea, on one of the displays, to slip into the mix a few pictures of popular cigarette band Carlton just as a play on words. Carlton—the man, not the brand—didn’t get upset at all over my pun play and it would have been kind of a drag if he had.\n\nLinda Clifford\n\nLinda Clifford was an R&B/disco singer who in 1978 was riding high on the national sales charts with her second album If My Friends Could See Me Now. To punch up the display a bit, I borrowed a friend’s set of blinds that mirrored the ones on Clifford’s album cover and whipped up this pre-concert display in an NRM store window in downtown Pittsburgh.\n\nThe Cars\n\nThe Cars were headed to Pittsburgh in 1978 on the heels of their enticing self-titled debut album, and I commandeered a front window in one of the downtown NRMs to tout their Stanley Theatre show. At the invitation of the Elektra promotion person who was planning to put in face time with the band backstage on the evening of the show, I was able to meet the group and show them photos of my handiwork. Regarding the photo above from one of the downtown NRMs: the group liked my tire approach which apparently was not yet a tired approach; perhaps the WEA display people in other markets hadn’t yet traveled that road. And I was pleased that the “auto eroticism at the Stanley” line on my hastily scrawled in-concert sign was appreciated as well. I would have expected nothing less from this quirky, captivating batch of Bostonians.\n\nChaka Khan and Al Jarreau\n\nThe Chaka Khan standup on the right in the photo above was one of at least ten that I received one morning on my front porch, which was UPS’ dumping place for all of the posters and additional merchandising materials that were routinely shipped out to me from the WEA branch office in Cleveland. In one of my less-inspired bursts of creativity in helping to promote an upcoming WEA artist team-up--Chaka Khan and Al Jarreau at the Stanley Theatre--I quickly doctored up (nay, slightly butchered?) one of the Chaka standups by Jarreau-a-sizin’ it. Huh. At least it was an attention-getter.\n\nTHE INDEPENDENT RECORD STORES\n\nI cannot end this “photos on parade” post about my life as an in-store display person without reiterating my initial marching orders from WEA. I was instructed to concentrate heavily on behemoth retailer NRM because Pittsburgh was NRM’s home base, and they certainly weren’t shy about flexing their buying muscle since the chain was now up to about 70 stores total across six states. But I also was encouraged to hit smaller local operations in the Pittsburgh market like the Record Outlet stores, and especially the burgeoning independent shops such as Jim’s Records in Bloomfield and Sounds & Seeds in the Monroeville area. These were stores that mattered as well, often boasting the most passionate of music-driven record buyers.\n\nPictured above is a window display of the Akron, Ohio band Tin Huey’s 1979 debut album Contents Dislodged During Shipment.
