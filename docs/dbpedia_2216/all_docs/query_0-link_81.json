        "text": "Jan 2021 Update. This page has become unwieldy (duh!), so I’m going to write a monthly blogpost of musical finds (on youtube, emusic, bandcamp, etc). So December 2020 will be my last entry here. The rest of them are found in my Musical Discoveries January 2021 #1 post and my other Musical Discoveries posts .\n\nSept 2019 Update: Now that I’ve returned to emusic, the offerings still suck, but I’ve found some good leads here and here for overlooked world music. Depressingly, a lot of things I wishlisted as little as 4 months ago are now unavailable.\n\nMUSIC Recommendations Sites. Through reddit and emusers.org I’ve learned about many amazing deals. Emusers has a thread about bargains on the new emusic site (mostly classical and avante-garde stuff). A Closer Listen reviews classical/experimental/ambient/jazz albums primarily. Ted Goia’s Music Criticism site contains a lot of long-form articles and listicles. Musicisgood has some detailed reviews about jazz, ambient, pop and classical, and one of the contributors follows emusic pretty closely. Bird is the Word Music Review blog has some good recs (see esp the best albums of the year listed on top). For brevity’s sake, I’ll just say (for example) “Bird Best 2014“. Some other places I go for obscure recommendations include: Nine Bullets Essential Listening page (the blog is interesting too), Tom Hull’s On the web blog (Hull is the ultimate music geek; he has developed a database for gathering and storing ratings , Acclaimed Music’s list of best-rated albums by year; see also Pitchfork’s album reviews and popmatters music reviews. a list of current labels and linernotes for emusic albums. See also my online database of music reviews from 2014 to present.\n\nDecember 2020. (Oops, I accidentally let some of my credits expire. Stupid!)\n\nWake your mind by Cosmic Gate. 6.49 for 27 tracks, 144 minutes. German DJ/EDM duo.\n\nQuit the Curse by Anne Burch. 6.49, 33 minutes, 9 tracks. Polyvinyl.\n\ns/t by Alvvays. 6.49, 9 tracks, 25 minutes. Polyvinyl.\n\nThe Water by Ten Realms. Chinese progrock. $5, 11 tracks, 64 minutes.\n\nEssencia by Jessica Pina. Jazz trumpet.\n\nBeautiful & Monstrous by Subsignal. 99 cents progrock.\n\nBest of Vocal Trance Volume 3, compilation, 6.49, 20 tracks, 244 minutes.\n\nMozaika (Live with Naoni Orchestra) by Onuka. Group and orchestra who did that dynamite interval act at Eurovision a few years ago. 4.99, 12 tracks, 54 minutes.\n\nFolksongs of Another America: Field Recordings from the Upper Midwest 1937-1946. Compiled by James P Leary, 7.49, 174 tracks, 290 minutes. Major compilation of immmigrant songs (many in English or pidgeon English. Contains Native American, Irish, German, East European, French, Swedish, etc).\n\nDoomsday Survival Kit by Praed. 50 minutes, 4 tracks, 99 cents.\n\ns/t by Gravitones. 4.99, jazz, 58 minutes, 8 tracks.\n\nNovember, 2020. Sadly (I guess!) I have not yet cancelled my emusic account because I’ve been very busy, and I’ve been busy listening to a lot of music. Thanks to omnifoo’s recommendation, I’ve found lots of musical avenues to go down. On an unrelated note, I’ve found a way to double my free downloads from freegal per week. My purchase list will now include things I buy on bandcamp — which will mostly be low-cost and pay what you want stuff.\n\nVarious compilations from Ostinato Records (BC page): , a label that collects vintage recordings from farflung places like Sudan, Senegal, Cafe Verde, Haiti etc.) . Sweet as Broken Dates: Lost Somali Tapes from the Horn of Africa (15 tracks, 6.99, 79 minutes). Star Band de Dakar: Psicodelia Afro-Cubana de Senegal (4.99, 6 tracks, 30 minutes — terrific!) Synthesize the Soul: Astro-Atlantic Hypnotica from the Cape Verde, 18 tracks, 76 minutes, 6.99, Tanbou Toujou Lou: Meringue, Kompa Kreyol, Vodou Jazz, & Electric Folklore from Haiti, 75 minutes, 6.99, 20 tracks.\n\nVarious by Ras Kimono. Reggae Nigerian.\n\nДжазовые композиции by Вагиф Мустафа-заде (i.e. Jazz compositions by Vagif Samadoglu). Samadoglu is a surreptitious self-taught jazz composer and pianist. Read this long and thorough article about Samadoglu’s contribution to jazz. 144 minutes, 29 tracks, 6.49\n\n(BC) Time Lapse by Will Bolton PWYW. Good ambient stuff.\n\n2 Albums Tragavenao Orquestra Afrobeat\n\n(BC) Various PWYW Polyvinyl Compilations Samplers. I’m not going to list them individuals because the titles indicate what they are.\n\nNoteless Poetry by Videatape.\n\nFreegal Downloads (Nov 2020 to … )\n\nVarious Hits by Zdravko Colic.\n\nMolly Sanden. Swedish star who sang voiceover for the female lead of the Eurovision movie: Fire Saga\n\nRas Kimono\n\nLos Chalchaleros\n\nHuman League. Later songs by 1980s group with one hit wonder “Don’t You Love Me. ”\n\nBill Snyder. Earnest jazzy piano by 1950s pianist and composer. Some standards mixed in.\n\nBalkan Notes Vol 1. Compilation of regional pop songs — including from Albania.\n\nSeptember 2020. After my subscription resumed, I spent 75$ for a $200 pack, so I’ll be buying a lot of things. I’m probably going to cancel after I finish spending the balance (or maybe not), so I’ll probably keep it on one page. Frankly, omnifoo has been crate digging and identifying a lot of unknown musicians and albums which are great (Check out here, here, and here). Note: After spending my remaining credits, I will probably start buying primarily from bandcamp. It’s more artist-friendly, has better audio previews and has a ton more stuff. So let me introduce 2 acronyms — BC (Bandcamp) and NYT (Name Your Price). In many cases, the album is available both from emusic and bandcamp — but it’s cheaper on emusic. If I just mention BC, that means that the best place to find this album is on bandcamp (even if it’s also available on bandcamp).\n\nBulgarian Pop Hits from the Golden Age Vol 1-4), 50 minutes each, 6.49 for each volume. Some are cover versions, but many sound like folk/oldies from the 1960s and 1970s.\n\nLow Power by H. Takahasi. 8 tracks, 3.99. Ambient.\n\nLand Patterns by World on Higher Downs. 3.49, 8 tracks, 59 minutes.\n\n(Bandcamp) Laguna by Adan Yeti. Great art/psychedelic pop from Uruguay. Pay what you want.\n\ns/t by Harley Alexander. 8 tracks, 99 cents.\n\nMalerika by Dagadena. 12 tracks, 52 minutes, $5.49\n\nSri Lanka : The Golden Era of Sinhalese & Tamil Folk​-​pop Music (Compilation), 97 minutes, 30 tracks, 7.49.\n\nАлёна Апина (Alena Apina). Apina was an early Russian pop star from the 1990s who was outlasted everybody. She sings in a variety of styles — sometimes techno, sometimes jazzy, sometimes I bought Vol 2 of a compilation, and here is Volume 1. (6.49 . 50 tracks, 180 minutes). I was shocked and elated to discover some earlier albums such as this one on emusic).\n\nTwo albums by Pustki: Koniec Kryzysu (6.49 for 14 tracks, 53 minutes) and Safari. (4.49 for 10 tracks, 35 minutes) Great pop group with\n\nBC, s/t by Gravitones.\n\nTrouble by Venture Boi. 99 cents for 6 tracks, 24 minutes). Birmingham-based songwriter who makes groovy psychedelic sounds with an almost laid back feel.\n\nCosmos by Fitness Forever. 4.99 for 11 tracks — 38 minutes. Unbelievably sunny and jazzy electronic pop based in Spain or Italy; compare to Stereophonic, Burt Bacharach, Jobim, etc).\n\ns/t by Parcels, 12 tracks. 5.49, 51 minutes.\n\nListen Time Space by Unsuspected. 6 tracks, 26 minutes, 99 cents.\n\nMay 2020.\n\nRest is Bliss by Phillip Otterbach. 5 tracks, 99 cents, 25 minutes\n\nFade a Little Deeper. East and West Rendezvous. 2 tracks, 18 minutes. 99 cents\n\nWeeping Bong Band, II. 99 cents. This and the next are most recent releases from Feeding Tube Records (instrumental, jazz fusion).\n\nPowers/Rolin Duo: ST 3 tracks, 30 minutes, 99 cents.\n\n2 albums: Sinfonias and Miticaventura by Ferrer Ferran. 99 centseach\n\nWe are the Courettes by the Courettes. 5.49 for 12 tracks, 33 minutes.\n\nApril 2020. As crazy as it sounds, I’ve been trying to quit this service. True, they have cool stuff, but I’m trying to cut down on fixed expenses.\n\nOne by Solarstone (29 tracks). Solarstone is mostly known for his brilliant trance mixes. This multi-album is halfway between dreamtrance and downtempo ambient.\n\nLive in Leverkusen by Billy Cobham Band, 9 tracks.\n\nSleep Games by Pye Corner Audio, 16 tracks. (Wonderful Ghost box label artist).\n\nAthena by Sudan Archives, 14 tracks. 6.49\n\nDip in the Ocean: Complete Recordings by Andulas Orchectra\n\nCharanga 1980 by Alfredo de la Fe & Orquestra, 99 cents, 35 minutes.\n\nVergers by Sarah Davachi, 3 tracks. 99 cents. young Canadian electronist artist who makes these great soundscapes — very tranquil and relaxing, with a surprising amount of aural ideas being explored.\n\nIn a Moment … Ghost Box (compilation, 31 tracks, 6.99).but this extra long album lets you sample lots of artists and see what the Ghostbox label sound is all about. Pitchfork did a long overview of Ghost box a while back.\n\nMarch 2020\n\nNeo Ouija by Metamatics. 10 tracks, 4.49 50 minutes. A rather disappointing EDM album\n\nMeadow Lane Park – Le SuperHomard. 12 tracks, 39 minutes, 4.99. Lovely light album with soaring Stereolab melodies.\n\nLo compilation mix by Susuma Yokota. 4.99, 45 tracks, 138 minutes. Various tracks from the Lo Recordings label, curated presumably by Yokota who is one of the artists.\n\nRelativity of Space by Zhaoze. 9 tracks,\n\nBioluminescence by Shorelights. 2 tracks, 38 minutes, .99.\n\nIn search of Sunrise 1 by Tiesto. Classic edm/trance from 1999. 15 tracks. 4.99, 90 minutes (and long mix). Emusic has lots of Tiesto’s catalog including ISOS sequels.\n\nArchive from 1959: Billy Childish Story. 51 tracks, 130 minutes, 6.49. Longtime Brit bunker. Compiles many quick punk songs spanning decades.\n\nVoices of Mississippi: Artists and Musicians Documented, 70 tracks, 220 minutes, 7.49 (This is a Dust to Digital compilation)\n\nUltimate Collection by Doris Day. 48 tracks, 140 minutes, Great compilation\n\nFonotone Records (1956-1969). 380 minutes, 131 tracks, $7.49 Country/rockabilly/blues rock tracks from the 1950s. Another Dust to Digital.\n\nFebruary 2020. Amazingly the site was down for a week, so I received a $15 courtesy credit\n\n25 Golden Hits by Freddy Fender, 75 minutes, 25 tracks, 6.49\n\nSafe as Milk by Captain Beefheart, 12 tracks, 33 minutes, 5.49\n\nJanuary 2020. Sorry to say that with labels dropping out and more accurate pricing on albums, there are very few deals to be had at normal prices.\n\nShout by Gabrielle Papillon, 7 tracks. 2.99 for 25 minutes.\n\nCurrency of Poetry by Gabrielle Papillon, 8 tracks, 3.49 for 36 minutues\n\nDecember 2019\n\nPattern of Consciousness by Caterina Barbieri. 7 tracks, 69 minutes, 2.99\n\nTwo by Marion Brown: Why Not and S/T. (4 tracks each, 99 cents)\n\nCosta do Marfim by Cachorro Grande, 11 tracks\n\nVardo by Kusht, 5 tracks\n\nTelar by Quixosis, 5 tracks\n\nNovember 2019.\n\nLines Pt 2 World War One by the Unthanks, 2.49, 6 tracks 21 minutes\n\nSisters by Odd Nosdam, 9 tracks,\n\nChain of Islands EP by Brothertiger 5 tracks\n\nSoltar by Carlomarco 4 tracks.\n\nYuna by Cain, 5 tracks\n\nOctober 2019 with one bonus pack. The big revelation was Premier Records Africa, which features short play Highlife classics. Alas, every album is available for free download (5 tracks per week), so I’m going to take albums from that place. (Actually I’m going to start listing them here even though they are (for me) free downloads.\n\nRevolutions of the Flowermind by Solid Sun. 28 minutes, 99 cents, 4 tracks. Nice progressive rock, with more emphasis on rhythm than the progressive dreamscape. It sometimes hearkens back to traditional Southern Rock (Doobie Brothers, etc). All tracks start slow and build layer by layer towards a crescendo. Great guitar riffs too.\n\nThe Waiit (s/t). Energetic and quirky Taiwanese pop. 4.50\n\nОпыт очарования by Акульи Слёзы. 7 tracks, 29 minutes 2.99. Nice shoegazing shimmering dreampop by a Russian girls’ band. Reminds me of Goldfrapp or Mazzy Star or Enya. Maybe a little like Madonna during her Ray of Light days. I’m glad I took a chance with this band. This is so unlike anything I’ve heard in Russian pop. Very moody and psychedelic….\n\nVarious classic albums by Chief Stephen Osita Osadebe (Igbo bandleader of Nigeria). I recommend Osondi Owendi and Nigeria Go Better. (though ignore the comedy sketch at the first 2 minutes on Track 1 — still worth it! ) All the 2 track albums are 30-35 minutes and cost $1.49 each. All seem well-worth buying. Update: I just discovered that my library’s free mp3 service (Freegal) stocks all albums\n\nUnthanks: Lines (Part One – Llllian Bilocca). This English folk/classical group released a 3 part album. This part 1 was 22 minutes, 5 tracks for 1.99; Part 2 is 21 minutes, 6 tracks, 2.49; Part 3 is 10 tracks, 33 minutes, 4.49.\n\nAfro-Blues Quintet Plus One, Mirror Image. 10 tracks, 28 minutes, 99 cents.\n\nEast and West Rendezvous, s/t 3 tracks\n\nAndy Fosberry: Music for Destroyed Orchestra -3 tracks and Moments we are Lost (5 tracks), 99 cents for each.\n\nDonkey No No. Tandoori Chicken\n\nGilberto Gil: Refazenda, 11 tracks\n\nBurton Green Quartet, s/t, 4 tracks, 99 cents\n\nFreegal — free downloads (Sept 2019 to Oct 2020)\n\nBlaze Foley — Dawg Years (1975-8). Early songs by this legendary Austin singer.\n\nFaithless — Reverence (and others). Trance/triphop group from UK consisting of Maxi Jazz (for vocals) and Rollo (aka Dido’s sister) for electronica. I love this group to death!\n\nTommy James. Tracks from Greatest Hits. Oh, yeah, I didn’t know he was the one who sang X (and Y, and Z, etc).\n\nAnalog Rebellion. I love this indie Texas rock band, and I’m taking tracks from the Ill’e Grande album which I didn’t already buy.\n\nKelly Lee Owens. Only EP of a Texas country singer who died at an early age in a tragic car accident.\n\nBlue Murder — 80s-90s heavy metal group recommended from a book.\n\nBetty Wright. Classic R&B singer.\n\nAretha Franklin. I found a lot of very early gospel recordings that blew me away.\n\nAltered Image: I could be happy: Best of. Scottish Punk/New Wave band from late 70s/early 80s. Female punk singer.\n\nY’all Come (East Texas Honky Tonk). Compilation of 50s songs by Houstonian Arlie Duff and others.\n\nTakemitsu. Various tracks from different pieces and albums (no rhyme or reason!). Unfortunately I couldn’t find his great soundtrack for Kurosawa’s Ran — this will have to do).\n\nLa Sonora Dinamita (and tracks by Lucho Argain). I just love the track, Ece en Stereo (which was Argain’s first hit with the Columbian supergroup La Sonora Dinamita.\n\nSoundtrack to Mondo Cave (Nino Oliviero). Early 60s film which do a variations of a musical theme. My mom said it was the song she danced to with my dad at her wedding!\n\nCabaret — original Broadway cast recording. I already have the OST for the movie; apparently the songs are a lot different for the play!\n\nPink Floyd. Piper at the End of Dawn. Early 60s album where Syd Barrett wrote most of the songs (before he lost his mind).\n\nPolyphonic Spree. Various tracks (Freegal didn’t have many). The soundtrack from the Big Short is one of my faves.\n\nTaylor Dayne — Hits. 80s popstar that Tig Notaro did a hilarious comedy routine about.\n\nShangri-Las. 60s girls group.\n\nWind and the Wave. Great Austin singing duo starring Patricia Lynne.\n\nDami Im — Lovely Australian singer who almost won Eurovision. She did cover songs by Classic Carpenters.\n\nSergey Lazarev. Russian mega-pop star who also almost won Eurovision. He’s actually a phenomenal singer.\n\nWilliam Basinski. Distintegration Loops. Famous sound loops of decaying cassette tapes.\n\nJean-Michel Jarre. Essential Recollection (greatest hits of the 80s).\n\nCourtney Barrett. Various tracks by Sometimes I Sit and\n\nVarious songs by Frida Boccara and Gigliola Cinquetti (2 early Eurovision winners)\n\nVarious Asian pop groups. 1976 (Manic Pixie Dream Girl) and Cindy Yen, Lilian Wong, Na Na Tang, Pauline Lan, Shandy Gan.\n\nMusic by classical composer Chou Wen-chung.\n\n(Various 70s-80s Afropop albums from Premier Records which are basically needledrops from LPs): Chief Stephen Osita Osadebe: Makojo, Nigeria Go Better\n\nEboa Moukouri: Billy Fantastic, Nnono Beates\n\nLen: You can’t stop the bum rush. 90s Album of Canadian one-hit pop wonder “Steal my sunshine”. (fun, eclectic)\n\nDon Solaris by 808 State. Avante-garde EDM.\n\n2 EPs by Catherine Feeny. Feeny is a soulful singer/songwriter who sang the title song for the Bulgarian film, Ave.\n\nFlying Burrito Brothers\n\nCady Groves. Country Singer who died early in a car accident.\n\nHamiltons. The Texas country rock group.\n\nDonna Summer. Pre and post-disco. Amazingly, her post-disco religious-infused stuff is just as good.\n\nVarious tracks from KPM Music. This was a label that produced jazzy instrumental music never released to the public, but widely used in TV and movies. Incredible stuff. I’m going to use my weekly allotment on a lot of these tracks. Check out especially pieces by Keith Mansfield.\n\nMuffs. Various tracks from Kaboodle and other albums.\n\nGert Wilden & Orchestra — more of that KPM vibe from a German composer who did 70s porn music. Wild and funky.\n\nJeffrey Tung.\n\nSecrets by Human League.\n\nArrest by Powerdove.\n\nVarious Hits by Zdravko Colic.\n\nSeptember 2019.\n\nS/T. Albanian Gypsy Music. 13 tracks, 54 minutes, 99 cents. Great lively recordings. Love the singing and the percussion; They bring Albania’s unique musical styles to modern ears, and they sound both wonderful and accessible. Balkan — and specifically Albanian — music can be a hard sell sometimes, but most Westerners can get into this album.\n\nNo Saviors by Clavvs. 6 tracks, 22 minutes, 99 cents. Outstanding trip-hop album by Atlanta duo.\n\nAbaraka Bake by Juffureh Band. A reconstituted version of famed Afropop 80s band from the Gambia. 6 tracks, 30 minutes, 99 cents\n\nVarious albums by Fasat Alfa. The Chile rock label Armatoste Brazo Discográfico has 3 great albums by this punk-rock garage band. I’d start with El Mar en la Calle (which feels very Beastie Boys),\n\nMay 2019. I’ll be putting my account on hold again, but still have a lot of credit to use. The consensus among fans is that emusic has significantly fewer albums than before even though the site itself has never been better. Hopefully this will be a short term glitch. In the meantime, I’ll be acquiring a lot of obscure stuff for bargain prices. stay tuned. I’ve been finding interesting stuff from Sublime Frequencies (world — mainly Africa) and Feeding Tube Records (USA, avante-garde, pop, freeform).\n\nLive at Kaleidoscope Club by Canned Heat. 6 tracks, 46 minutes, 99 cents.\n\nTwo albums by Elkhorn: Sun Cycle and Elk Jam. Each album is 30 minutes and 99 cents.. Basically freeform rock guitar instrumentals, mostly slow stuff, but it picks up the tempo at parts. Overall a nice listening experience.\n\nRoll with the Punches by Yu Su, 5 tracks, 32 minutes, 99 cents. Ambient dub, Vancouver musican (Album on youtube) . Update: I grew less enamored of this on later listens.\n\nAlligator Records 45th Anniversary Collection. 37 tracks, $6.50, 150 minutes. Great value for a compilation of leading US blues/rock singers. More value as entertainment than art.\n\nEcstatic Music of the Jemaa El Fna by Hisham Mayet. Lively Moroccan street music recorded live. This is dense, rhythmic and rowdy stuff. 9 tracks, 38 minutes, 3.99.\n\nIn the ink dark by Scott Twynholm. Classical music that sounds like background music for serious movies. Gentle, serene stuff. 5 tracks, 39 minutes, 1.99\n\nJuguya by Baba Commandant and the Mandingo Band. 8 tracks, 3.49, 41 minutes. Burkino Faso jam!\n\nSabor de Carnaval Tableno by Fito Espino. 8 tracks, 29 minutes, $3.49 Panamanian music from 60s and 70s.\n\nTreeg Salaam by Group Doueh. 5 tracks, 43 minutes, 99 cents. Western Sahara jam…\n\nS/T Weeping Bong Band. 5 tracks, 52 minutes, 99 cents. Spectacular experimental rock-jazz fusion. Mostly slow, dreamy stuff — no dissonance. It’s amazing to discover that a rock band can produce this kind of stuff.\n\nFrame Slip by Dalthom, 2 tracks, 40 minutes, 49 cents. More experimental rock stuff, with synthesizer and random electronic sound effects and occasionally distorted voices. Each track is 20 minutes, which allows time for a variety of voices and melodies. Dense, textured stuff, and not too disruptive — well maybe occasionally on the second track.\n\nS/T Jamaleonics. 4 tracks, 25 minutes, 99 cents. Mainstream but energetic Italian jazz band. I actually was on the fence between this one and another avante-garde recording; I decided that I actually enjoyed the fun energy here.\n\nOut of my Head by Kate York. 5 songs, 99 cents, 16 minutes. Because all of York’s songs have electronic arrangements, “Country soul” is the phrase I think of when trying to describe this EP. Several of this country singer’s songs were carried on TV shows like Nashville. (here’s a profile). This EP is a good sampler of her stuff.\n\nApril 2019.\n\nSorabji: Symphonic Nocturne, performed by Lukas Huisman. Classical/experimental. 1.99, 2 tracks, 150 minutes.\n\nPeter Broderick + Gabriel Saloman, Peter Broderick. 99 cents, 5 tracks, 40 minutes.\n\nDowntempo Compilation (Russian), 3.99, 280 minutes, 57 tracks, Multiza Distribution. Varies in quality, but\n\nMarch 2019. Lots of unknown trance/EDM compilations from the Main Arena label.\n\nMusic for Love and Sex: Erotic Rhythms 4.99 (Various). 340 minutes, 64 tracks.\n\nDream Arena 0.99 (various). 120 minutes, 20 tracks.\n\nTeleport: Trance Music. (Various). 0.99, 220 minutes, 41 tracks.\n\nFebruary 2019\n\nSuzanne Ciani, S/T. 42 tracks. 171 minutes, 6.99. This is a compilation album of cutting edge Italian-American New Age pianist/composer and early user of electronic instruments. Update: It didn’t wow me as much as I would have wanted — though Ciani has done some wild things.\n\nJanuary 2019\n\nElectronic Architecture by Solarstone. 44 tracks, 8 hours (!), 6.49. Several long EDM mixes. All terrific. BTW, about 3-4 hours are continuous play versions of individual tracks.\n\nEmpire by Monty Adkins. 99 cents, 55 minutes. 1 ambient track with certain electronic effects.\n\nCarter Family Vol 1. Emusic has 4 volumes of this legendary country band for 99 cents each.\n\nDec 2018 Re-enlisted.\n\nParallel Life by Starseeds. (57 minutes, 9 tracks, 3.99). Really weird interplanetary dream album. I love the first track in particular.\n\nLive Aid Live. 7 hours, 93 tracks, 6.49. I was alienated from 80s music while in school, but the live performances give these familiar songs a special energy.\n\nWood Flute Songs: Anthology / Live 2006-2012 by William Parker, 550 minutes, 44 tracks. 6.50\n\nDur Dur of Somalia – Vol. 1, Vol. 2 (Analog Africa No. 27) Dur Dur Band. 18 tracks, 107 minutes, $5\n\nEmpire Bakuba – Bombe atomique by Pepe Kalle .4 tracks, 33 minutes, $1.50\n\n2 Albums by Kanda Bongo Man: Iyole, Mazine and Djessy, Dyna.

Franco. 99 cents. 5 tracks, 48 minutes.\n\nMay 2018. Buying only 99 cent albums in my poverty.\n\nDance Moderno by Sergio Mendes\n\ns/t, Man Made 6 tracks, 36 minutes.\n\nGreatest Hits, by Claudio Villa, 20 tracks, 66 minutes, 99 cents.\n\nRemastered Hits and Remastered Hits Vol 2 by Zaccarias e sua Orquestra.\n\nAlice and Wonderband by Alice Babs. 11 tracks, 36 minutes. Midcareer jazz songs by a Swedish jazz sensation.\n\nInde du Nord – Sanjeet Trio Live. 3 tracks, 66 minutes 99 cents\n\nApril 2018. I bought a $5 booster and was prepared to spend it on lots of 99 cent albums but alas, that will have to wait another month.\n\nSings for Playboys, etc . 41 tracks, 107 minutes $6.99 by Beverly Kenny. Part 2 of a 2 part compilation series contains 3 jazz albums. These are gems by a jazz singer who died early in life.\n\nMariss Jansons Live: Radio Recordings 1990-2014. 97 tracks, 16+ hours $6.99. Great magical interpretations of many standards, plus a few unfamiliar ones thrown in. I was struck by the clarity of the audio (which may have more to do with improving audio standards than the performances themselves).\n\nFunky Rob Way (Analog Africa Limited Dance Edition Number 2). 6 tracks, 35 minutes, 99 cents.\n\nHannibal s/t. 6 tracks, 99 cents. This unpredictable album merges several different styles. rock/funk drums, frantic jazzy guitars, dizzy sax, downbeat blues vocals. I’m not normally a fan of jazz fusion, but I thought there’s a lot of interesting musical themes here amidst the anarchy.\n\nPowell to the People, Massimo Colombo, Maurizio Quintavalle, Enzo Zirilli. 11 tracks, 47 minutes, 99 cents.\n\nOnuka: individual tracks. (I spend my remaining credits on Onuka and Sofi Tukker when the amount goes under 99 cents!)\n\nMarch 2018. I totally can’t afford it, but I bought $10 in extra credits to buy the Pauline Oliveros compilation\n\nReverberations: Tape & Electronic Music 1961-1970. by Pauline Oliveros. 35 tracks, 11.5 hours, $7.50. Oliveros does avante-garde music which sound electronically strange, but always interesting, and not too dissonant. Fun fact, she was born in Houston!\n\nOvation 3. Various Canadian Composers (Beecroft, Pentland, Kenins, Beckwith, Tremblay). 54 tracks, 344 minutes for $6.99. Ovation is an album series which publishes one album per Canadian composer. Emusic has all 3 volumes, but only this one is at the bargain $6.99 price.\n\nClassic 1958-1962 Recording (with Israel Crosby & Vernel Fournier)[Bonus Track Version]. By Ahmad Jamal Trio. 94 tracks, 387 minutes, $6.99 The key thing to know is that the Ahmad Jamal Trio’s Argo Sessions are very highly regarded, and that this misnamed compilation contains about 2/3 of those tracks for a bargain price.\n\nПесни любви (50 Best) 2018 edition , 50 tracks, 174 minutes, 4.99. Here’s another Moon Vinyl s.r.o compilation of pop love songs from Ukraine. I love the national pop style so much (a cross between dance pop, rap with some folk thrown in) that I tolerate some repetitive melodies. I am careful to notice if these Moon Vinyl compilations repeat the same song. I’ve been downloading about half of their compilations, and I noticed 6 overlaps in this 50 track album.\n\nCluster 71 by Cluster. 3 tracks, 99 cents. This critically acclaimed album by two German electronic musicians flows smoothly and slowly, with the third movement being particularly intense and serene.\n\nFebruary 2018. I’m buying only 99 cent albums this month! I’m honing in on albums and compilations from BBE Record label. You can generally stream them for free off youtube or bandcamp. SAD UPDATE: All of these albums have jumped up to $6.99 (also true for some of the January purchases as well!) All these are still good albums though.\n\nLive ‘n Well by Bert Myrick. 4 tracks, 99 cents.\n\nTAITU Soul-filled Stompers from 1960s and 1970s Ethipia. by Various artists, compiled by Ernesto Chahoud, 25 tracks, 99 cents\n\nJohn Armstrong presents Afrobeat Brasil. Various Artists. 14 tracks, 73 minutes, 99 cents. Recent African tracks.\n\nKeb Darge & Cut Chemist present The Dark Side: 28 Sixties Garage Punk and Psyche Monsters, 28 tracks, 99 cents. I thought I already had enough 60s, garage/rockabilly stuff, but this stuff is rare and phenomenally good.\n\nDragon Soul by HKE, 12 tracks, 99 cents, 58 minutes,\n\nInfluences Vol 2 by collected by DJ Marky, 99 cents, 21 tracks, 120 minutes, lots of tropical dance/EDM,\n\nJanuary 2018. After spending the bonus credit (see below), I have realized that 1)I am obsessed with Indonesian music (even free Indonesian music), 2)emusic has a lot of ultra-budget albums\n\nLive in Tokyo (Continuous Mix) by Mark Farina. 1 track, 72 minutes, 99 cents. Famous “Mushroom Jazz/EDM” dj/remixer. The full album with separate tracks is also available for a normal price.\n\nAutomatone by Jonathan Kusuma (EP), 4 tracks, 28 minutes, 99 cents. Indonesian EDM guy. Plan to buy more.\n\n2 Albums by Brock Van Wey (bvdub): All is Forgiven and A History of Distance. BVDUB is a prolific ambient composer. 2 of his dozen + albums can be bought for 99 cents each. (Reviews here).\n\nMore Dronarivm Releases: These are usually 99 cents for 40 minutes of ambient music. Day Has Ended by Aaron Martin and Christopher Berg. (review).\n\nRotational Templates by Travis Reuter. Experimental jazz/avant garde classical music which is actually listenable. (Read this review)\n\nDecember 2017. I received a bonus credit over a customer service problem. Spend away!\n\nBefore During After by Woodtops, 52 tracks, 227 minutes, $6.99. Compilation of a short-lived 80s British synth band, with one third of the tracks being live performances, remixes and outtakes. Great stuff!\n\nVarious 99 cent compilations of Art Tatum piano pieces from Resurfaced Records. (such as here). I bought 7 totaling about 8 or 9 hours. A bargain!\n\nVarious Indonesian pop albums (50 minutes for 99 cents each) : Album Emas: Tetty Kadi, Album Emas: Titiek Sandora & Muchsin Alatas, Album Emas: Broery Pesulima, Album Emas The Mercy’s, Seleksi Album Emas Panbers Vol 1. Most are recordings from the 1960s and 1970s more or less. (Sound quality is fairly low for the decade it was recorded in). Think of the Indonesian equivalent of Doris Day, Tony Bennett, etc. Even the more “expensive” compilation albums cost $3.99 or less. Update: Very Best of Grace Simon (15 tracks, 52 minutes, 99 cents), Very Best of Lex Trio (20 tracks, 78 minutes, 99 cents). I really am liking Lex Trio! I’m buying several more albums for “full price” — see below. Update 2: I really love Tetty Kadi’s slow love ballads.\n\nVarious Ukrainian Pop compilations: ЛЕТНЯЯ ДИСКОТЕКА 2017 (50 tracks, 3 hours, $4.99), Свежачок, Ч. 12 (21 tracks, 78 minutes, 99 cents), Pokemon Party (30 tracks, 102 minutes, $3.99) , Spring Music Hits 2017(Best Woman Voices) (25 tracks, 90 minutes, $3.99) . Moon Vinyl label publishes most of the Ukrainian pop music, and they do moderately priced samplers on emusic (about 5-10 per year). The same 20 or 30 singers appear on these samplers, which is fine by me. Some of the pop is formulaic dance pop, but a lot of the songs are bold and zany, well worth taking a chance on.\n\nVarious Dronarivm albums: Expanses by Green Kingdom . All of these are about 50-60 minutes and priced at 99 cents each.\n\nBeverly Kenny Compilation albums (6.99 each, 50+ tracks, 120 minutes): Sings for Johnny Smith Etc and Sings for Playboys, etc . (Update: how embarrassing; forgot to buy the latter album).\n\nThe Best Koes Plus: Vol 1, Vol 2, Vol 3 and Vol 4. (Each costs $3.99, about 20 tracks, 60 minutes). These guys are deservedly called the “Indonesian Beatles.”\n\nPhilosophy Gang by Harry Roesli Gang, 7 tracks, 28 minutes, $2.99) Progrock Indonesian Pink Floyd.\n\nJohnny Hallyday Anthology (All Tracks Remastered) (28 tracks, 68 minutes 99 cents). The “French Elvis” who sang American style rock and roll songs. He died a week ago.\n\n18 Greatest Hits of God Bless by God Bless. 18 tracks, 90 minutes, $7.99. Compilation of slow 70s Indonesian prog rock. Normally more than I would pay, but I found this music greatly appealing\n\nBest of Fariz RM. 17 tracks, 100 minutes, $4.99.\n\nDrink Me by Vicky Shu. 99 cents, 8 tracks, 33 minutes. Indonesian Techno Dance Pop.\n\nBetter by Haley Reinhart $4.99, 11 tracks, 40 minutes). Man, I just love this album by one of the finalists for “Voice” Music competition.\n\nLegend Collections: Don Ho, Johnny Bond, Solomon Burke, Gerry Mulligan,\n\nGeorge Russell Sextet and Septet: Complete 1960-1962 Decca and Riverside Recordings. $6.99, 316 minutes, 46 tracks. Really sophisticated stuff.\n\nTake One. Hallelujah Chicken Run Band. 18 tracks, 64 minutes, $4.99 Thomas Mapfumo’s early Zimbapop band.\n\n1974-1975 by Hamad Kalkaba and the Golden Sounds. 6 tracks, 27 minutes, $2.49.\n\nResurrection Los Vol 1 by Los Camaroes. 6 tracks, 32 minutes, $2.49.\n\n1st Album 1973 by Orchestra Poly-Rythmo de Cotonou. 4 tracks, 33 minutes, 99 cents.\n\nVery Best of Titiek Puspa. 69 minutes, 24 tracks, 69 minutes. More Indonesian classic pop.\n\nHaas: In Vain by Klangforum Wien. 63 minutes, 1 track, 99 cents,\n\nSoft Animals by Sofi Tukker. 26 minutes, 6 tracks, $2.49 (Selected tracks)\n\nNovember 2017. Okay, I paid $5 extra for the Two for Sale.\n\n100 years of Eddie Rosner. (41 tracks, 140 minutes, $6.99). Trumpeter Rosner was called the “Polish Louis Armstrong” and toured in West Europe and USA in the 1930s. The Jewish Rosner was persecuted under the Nazis and Stalin, but in the 50s and 60s he led a big band that toured around the U.S.S.R. He later said, “In 1939, it didn’t help being a Jew playing Negro music, even if your name is Adolf,” (It’s true, his first name was actually “Adolph”). About 1/2 of the album is low fidelity, and all of the tracks are interesting — even though they don’t fit neatly into traditional musical categories. Lots of the jazz number have violin and violas — giving everything a folk/gypsy feel. There are some wacky Western homages — like the “Cowboy” song (Kovboyskaya). It features several Soviet singers mostly unknown to me.\n\nLuminous Group (Compilation album) by Robyn Hitchcock. (90 tracks, 335 minutes, $6.99). A sequel to the I wanna go backwards album I bought a few months ago.\n\nTartini: Complete Violin Concertos Box Set . 389 tracks, 29 hours! 6.99. “lArte Dell’arco.\n\nOctober 2017. Account no longer on hold. Buying lots of cheap stuff. Still on a tight budget.\n\n80 Aching Options: 45 Years of the Residents. 80 tracks, 270 minutes, $4.99.\n\nOte Maloya: Birth of Electric Maloya on Reunion Island 1975-1986. 19 tracks, 73 minutes, 99 cents. Pretty damn obscure African stuff from near Madagascar.\n\nComplete Parisian Small Group Sessions 1956-9. Lucky Thompson. 74 tracks, 300 minutes, $6.99 Great jazz tunes by an underappreciated artist.\n\nL’Oevre electronique by Luc Ferrari. 95 tracks, 570 minutes, $3.99 Avante-garde experimental composer.\n\nImagine. Martux, Fabrizio Bosso, Bearzatti Aarset. 6 tracks, 49 minutes, 99 cents.\n\nBurhan Ocal Box Set 48 tracks, 270 minutes $7. Several albums with the versatile Turkish instrumentalist paired with other notable musicians.\n\nLa Legende d’Eer, composed by Iannis Xenakis. 1 track, 45 minutes, 99 cents. Mathematical composition style that this Romanian composer is famous for.\n\nPiano and String Quartet by Morton Feldman. 79 minutes, 1 track, 49 cents. Very slow and restrained.\n\nUnder Burning Skies by Souljazz Orchestra, 10 tracks, 45 minutes, 99 cents.\n\nMelatu of Africa by Mulatu Astatke, 14 tracks, 99 cents, 57 minutes. (Update, only 28 minutes, because it includes mono and stereo versions of each track. Still a good deal.\n\nSalone Konde Band. 12 tracks, 47 minutes, 99 cents.\n\nFantnawa Experience by Fanga & Maalem Abdallah Guinea. 6 tracks, 59 minutes, $2.49\n\nБудет тепло . (Budet Teplo). 23 tracks, 77 minutes 99 cents. Various. An unusually feisty compilation of Ukrainian pop songs at an at unbeatable price.\n\nOnuka by Onuka. Ukrainian folk-electronic made a splash as the intermission act at Eurovision 2017 (watch the amazing video of their performance). The studio recordings are not as exciting or as pulsating, but pared down.\n\nJuly 2017. Too poor to afford booster credits, but I am getting some great deals on classical/modernist albums! All about a dollar!\n\nMusic from Azerbaijan by Gochag Askarov. (5 tracks, 60 minutes, 99 cents).\n\nInscriptions by Wil Bolton (5 tracks, 47 minutes, $1.99). This was number 1 on David Smith’s Top 20 of 2015 list, calling it “especially captivating, a cohesive suite of carefully textured ambient soundscapes of great warmth and delicacy.”\n\nTiento de las Nieves by Thomas Koner (1 track, 68 minutes, 50 cents). Also highly recommended by David Smith.\n\nAvifaunal by Pausal (6 tracks, 46 minutes, 99 cents).\n\nNirvana Haze by Alonefold (1 track, 63 minutes, 49 cents).\n\nPatterns in a Chromatic Field by Morton Feldman (1 tracks, 80 minutes, 49 cents).\n\nLo-Def Pressure by Bill Laswell. (2 tracks, 48 minutes, 49 cents).\n\nMausoleum / Hoketus by Louis Andriessen (2 tracks, 57 minutes, 49 cents). 2 minimalist rhythmic pieces from the 1970s. The first contains lots of rattling brassy orchestration, with dissonant choral protests (it’s an homage to Russian anarchist Mikhail Bakunin. The second piece is just percussive chamber music which despite the fast rhythm varies very slowly. Both startling and provocative pieces, but hardly inspiring.\n\nMay 2017. Now the site has been redesigned, with lots of new deals, broken links and albums which are missing or new.\n\nI wanna go backwards Box Set. Robyn Hitchcock. 102 tracks, 336 minutes, $6.99. 3 early acoustic albums, with 2 albums worth of rarities. I have my eyes on Part 2 of this box set, Luminous Grooves, which contains albums from the mid to late 1980s\n\nVasks: Sala / Musica appassionata / Credo, Liepaja Symphony Orchestra & Atvars Lakstigala $1.99, 3 Tracks , 59 minutes 37 seconds. 3 Contemporary compositions by this Latvian composer. Romantic, full orchestration, dissonant, beautiful. (Read liner notes).\n\nApril 2017. Unsuspended my account again…. Hopefully for the last time.\n\nBox Set by William Onyearbor (37 tracks, 272 minutes, $6.99).\n\n69 Love Songs by Magnetic Fields. (69 tracks, 172 minutes, $6.99).\n\nEccentric Soul: Omnibus, Various (88 tracks, 288 minutes, $6.99)\n\nKinks: Anthology 1964-1971. (140 tracks, 374 minutes, $6.99)\n\nJanuary 2017. (I forgot to suspend my membership, but ended up with a winner anyway).\n\nCooking Vinyl 1986-2006 (compilation). (67 tracks, 276 minutes, $6.49). Nice and ample collection of A-list talents by a European label. (A good mix of American and European pop stars).\n\nDecember 2016. Won’t be able to upgrade my account for a while, but managed to buy one album. In the meantime, I’m listening to one-off recordings by Daytrotter Studio (I downloaded 7000 sessions that I need to listen to).\n\nI’ve Got a Way by Kelsey Waldon. (11 tracks, 38 minutes, $5.39). Also selected songs from her earlier album The Gold Mine. Young rising country star sings slow, heartfelt and almost gothic blues ballads; it definitely feels more personal than prepackaged; Kelsey has a distinctive rugged voice which in its rock carnation kind of reminds me of Courtney Barrett. But what makes it special is the quiet dignity she gives to many of the songs.\n\nNovember 2016. Back from a hiatus to do some purchases — mainly from the incredible stack of artists I discovered from 2016 SXSW.\n\nJulius Eastman: Unjust Malaise. (8 tracks, 193 minutes, $6.49). Eastman was a minimalist avante-garde composer who wrote complex orchestral pieces for piano and voice. He was unappreciated even by other composers and died homeless and penniless in 1990. This collection of longer pieces are sometimes discordant or hard to enjoy, but they are interesting and expressive (and really, not that different from what Glass and other people were doing in the 70s) But recently several critics have been championing his works. See this longish piece in the Guardian .\n\nUnited Crushers by Poliça (sale – 12 tracks, 43 minutes, $4.99)\n\nDown to Believing by Allison Moorer (13 tracks, 46 minutes, $6.37). One of my greatest finds this year was the achingly beautiful album “Crows” by Allison Moorer which was released a few years ago. Because I had listened to a library copy, I vowed to buy an A.M. album to show my support and gratitude; as it happens, “Down to Believing” is just as lovely as “Crows” and as well regarded — and it’s a bargain on emusic.\n\nPlace Called Bad by Scientists (80 tracks, 269 minutes, $6.99). The Scientists are a well-known Australian rock-punk group from the 70s and 80s. This band sounds fresh, punk and still relevant.\n\nMutant Disco Volume 1 (12 tracks, 74 minutes, $5.88). I was watching a hilarious 1989 Richard Pryor/Gene Wilder comedy called “See No Evil, Hear No Evil.” As the credits rolled, I heard this amazing disco melody, which led me to investigate the group “Was (Not Was)” which sang it. This group was produced by Ze Records, who has several emusic compilations. I will probably buy more compilations by Ze Records, but to start out with, I purchased this album, which was positively reviewed by the emusic staff and includes several reviews by emusic fans. There are 4 volumes in this series (and each group is represented by at 4 or 5 songs in the entire series). As enjoyable as the Mutant Disco volumes are, Soul Jazz Records also has two also wonderful disco compilations on emusic which are longer and have more tracks.\n\nWatermelon Summer by Annabelle Chairlegs (10 tracks, 30 minutes, $4.90). Chairlegs is a Austin girl indie-rock album which doesn’t disappoint.\n\nClassic FM by Andy Clockwise. (30 tracks, 133 minutes, $6.49). This first album by versatile Australian rocker Andy Clockwise has been scandalously ignored by critics — even in Australia — though everyone seems to have a high opinion of Clockwise and his more recent projects. “Classic FM” is a concept album that tries to juxtapose a dozen different musical styles in one album — as though you were scanning the FM dial on a car radio. Sure, you may not like everything here, but it’s all different, interesting and original. (I would compare this to double albums like the Beatles’ “White Album” or Fleetwood Mac’s “Tusk” which were initially criticized for being sprawling messes, but were later appreciated for what they were). By the way Clockwise lives and performs in the US, and his earworm song Open Relationship has an entertaining and bizzare music video.\n\nYou Hear Me: A Retrospective 1983-2009 by Tommy Keene. ( 41 songs, 192 minutes, $6.49). Amazingly I bought this a year ago and never listened to it!\n\nSoul Jazz Records Presents VENEZUELA 70: Cosmic Visions Of A Latin American Earth – Venezuelan Experimental Rock In The 1970s. (16 tracks, 62 minutes, $6.99) Intriguing genre, and the album pretty much delivers. See this PopMatters review. BTW, because of the current economic chaos in Venezuela, now is as good as any time to show your support for musicians for that country!\n\nBack to Venezuela by Billo’s Caracas Boys. (41 tracks, 128 minutes, $6.49) Billos Caracas Boys is an immortal Venezuelan dance orchestra fronted by Billo Frómeta and lasted from the late 1930s to the 1960s or 1970s. The band is pretty amazing — jazzy/samba with vocals. Personnel changed from year to year, and unfortunately there is not good documentation for this album about when these songs were originally released (or if they are simply re-releases from other albums). But many of the songs here sound like original stuff — probably from the 1940s or 1950s. I want to emphasize that this album merely scratches the surface of what is out there — and doesn’t include many of the tunes which are considered signature songs. Emusic has about 100 albums by Billos Caracas Boys, and this the best and cheapest of the “greatest hits compilations” which I was able to find.\n\nJuly 2016. Back from hiatus to take advantage of another double credits sale. I have a backlog of things to purchase and have some wonderful picks from this year’s South by Southwest torrent.\n\nBest of GEM 2008-2012. By G.E.M. (24 tracks, 95 minutes, $5.99). Earlier this year I heard the remarkable Heartbelt album by G.E.M. which immediately made me want more. This compilation album seems equally fun and ethereal — certainly not callow forgettable tracks.\n\nFinal Wild Ride. by Long Ryders ( 48 tracks, minutes, 170 minutes $6.99).\n\nGlacial Glow (and other selected tracks) by Noveller. (8 tracks, 34 minutes, $3.92). Known for New Age ambient with guitar, all of her tracks are interesting. I found two other albums from another service (“No Dreams” her best known and “Fantastic Planet” her most recent). I plan to obtain all of her wonderful albums eventually.\n\nMarch 2016. After a hiatus, I have started buying again.\n\nЗаждалась by Анастасия Приходько. (15 tracks, 53 minutes, $5.99). Lots of great pop singles by this Ukrainian-born singer who was popular in Russia. Interestingly, after representing Russia in the Eurovision song contest, she has vowed never to perform in Russia again. This and other Ukraine gems come from the fantastic Moon Vinyl S.R.O. label .\n\nFebruary 2016. Ok, I bought $10 of double booster credits to buy some great compilations.\n\nI Am the Center: Private Issue New Age Music in America, 1950-1990 . (20 tracks, 132 minutes, $6.49). A good collection of early New Age/space music, from quite a few well-knowns. A Popmatters review of the album writes, “This is new age music before it became a commodity, before it evolved into aural wallpaper and background music. When it was the domain of outsider artists, eccentrics and experimentalists. As evidenced by this collection, the music’s goals were often lofty.” (My minor complaint is that 5 of the 20 are excerpts from longer pieces, but it’s still a good value).\n\nJuke Joint Blues Black Cat Rag (54 tracks, 154 minutes, $6.49). Here’s a good collection of blues tracks with reasonably high fidelity and lots of performers I have never heard of (and I have heard of a lot!) Though the first few tracks didn’t particularly impress me, the overwhelming majority of the tracks were keepers. Sadly, this seems to be part of a larger series which never made it to emusic. (The album shows it as “Juke Joints 4 — Volume 2”). Still, what we have is pretty special. Lots of Southern bluesy stuff, with harmonica, a good fast beat and a variety of voices).\n\nLiverpool International Festival of Psychedelia Presents PZYK Vol.1 by Various Artists. (31 tracks, 147 minutes, $6.49) paraphrasing from Piccadilly Records website where the album made their best of 2015 compilations list, is “a deluxe triple vinyl compilation celebrating the current neo-psychedelic underground. Featuring a mix of exclusive tracks, re-mixes, rarities and album cuts, the compilation spans and charts the global PZYK diaspora, with artists from around the world contributing to an international selection comprising 30 of the current movement’s key noisemakers.” I really loved this collection. Lots of electronic which sounded more psychedelic than trance or techno.\n\nJanuary 2016 (skipped December 2015). I suspended my subscription, renewed it, received $10 in courtesy credits because the site has been down a lot, and then for two weeks my account was available! It’s all behind me, and more importantly, emusic has added in the cost of subscription an ability to stream your purchases. That’s a cool feature! They have also updated the android and apple app so that you can hear it from cell phones. The semi-permanent double value booster sales have officially ended, thus relieving me of any temptation to buy more music until I get a steady paycheck!.\n\nA Badly Broken Code by Dessa. (15 tracks, 47 minutes, $5.99). Filipino Dessa did a remarkable album Parts of Speech which consisted of lots of adventurous rap songs with excellent and expressive lyrics (no profanity), magnificent arrangements and a variety of styles (though the slow rap song seems to be her default). Her albums seem a tad overproduced; I wish we can just enjoy the melodies apart from the lyrics or the strong emotions. Despite my nitpicks, this album – like Parts of Speech — are absolutely first-rate and bring additional rewards with repeated listens.\n\nBaroques (Remastered). by the Baroques. (25 tracks, 82 minutes, $5.99). Very obscure Milwaukee psychedelic music group from the 60s. Although labels from that time were pretty open to experimentation, I think the Baroques abandoned the pop sensibility, lost their record deal and broke up. Sad story, but the songs they made are incredible and fun.\n\nO Vertigo by Kate Miller-Heidke (12 tracks, 42 minutes, $5.88). I’m going to be selecting tracks from this album and others to zero out my balances. Miller-Heidke is this unbelievably talented Australian opera-trained singer who first came to my attention by doing these wild cover versions of well-known songs (like this one and this one and this one ) . Turns out she and her husband write and perform lots of original songs and most recently an opera! A lot of her best stuff is not on emusic though O Vertigo is pretty great).\n\nNovember 2015. Wow, it seems that my unemployment will once again reduce my purchases (after months of indulging). I may even suspend my membership temporarily. Fear Not. I have lots of listening to catch up on.\n\nBest of Old School Hip Hop. Various. 20 tracks. 93 minutes, $3.89. Upbeat urban rap from the 90s. Heavy beat, kind of silly and juvenile and not too raunchy or violent. Plus, the lyrics are actually comprehensible! Everything feels like the “Fresh Prince of Bel-Air” and at least the lyrics are interesting and tell a story. These are not great tracks, but the musical arrangements are all interesting.\n\nBest of 00-10 by Ladytron. (17 tracks, 68 minutes, $5.99). Hits compilations by one of my alltime fave bands. They know how to write catchy pop songs with hooks and occasionally rock it up (Blue Jeans, Destroy Everything You Touch). The singer Helen Marnie is great and stylish, but the synthesizer parts are also fantastic! Updates: Silly me. I forgot I already bought individual tracks, and had accumulated another album’s worth of tracks through samplers, etc. Also, it appears that Marnie has started to go solo. So much as I loved this album, I totally did not need it!\n\nBoom Tic Boom by Allison Miller (8 tracks, 58 minutes for $3.92). This awesome jazz drummer put together a multi-talented jazz band which put together the zippy album No Morphine, No Lilies which I thought was outstanding.\n\nBoddie Recording Company: Cleveland, OH. (64 tracks, 190 minutes, $6.49). Multi-decade compilation by a lesser known Cleveland recording company. Not as polished as the Motown stuff, but still very interesting.\n\nFats Navarro Collection 1943-1950 (39 tracks, 140 minutes, $6.49). Feisty trumpet recordings by a jazz virtuoso who died at a shockingly early age (26) from a combination of TB and a drug overdose.\n\nOctober 2015. I finished listening and rating my 2011 SXSW torrents and have been amassing things to buy for it. Here are some other purchases:\n\nBird Call! The Twin City Stomp of the Trashmen. 80 tracks, 224 minutes, 5.99. Lots of variant recordings and live recordings\n\nHits, Hits, Hits Vol 1 and Hits, Hits, Hits Vol 2 are two huge compilations of 70s disco/early 80s hip hop music from P& P Records. Each volume is more than 530 minutes! (Read this Guardian critic’s review of this series). It’s true that both volumes are padded with instrumental versions and extended versions (you have a 13 minute disco version of the Charlie’s Angels theme — and trust me, it’s great!)\n\nTerry Farley Presents Acid Rain Deep House 1985-1991 61 tracks, 387 minutes, $6.49). Great collection of hard techno/early EDM stuff.\n\nNorthern Soul — Soundtrack– Extended Version (54 tracks, 146 minutes, $6.49)is a collection of “Northern Soul” (British-based soul plus a lot of semi-obscure American stuff thrown in)This comes from a movie about the time period. I am especially loving this one.\n\nWeekender: (Music from the Movie & Further Inspiration).\n\nTraxbox (Trax Records Remastered). 226 tracks, 1200 minutes, $6.49. It’s true that there are 2 and maybe 3) versions of each song\n\nNorthern Soul 60s Mod. 45 tracks, 128 minutes, $5.99\n\nDark Tree by Horace Tapscott. (9 tracks, 127 minutes, $6.49). Widely praised Live Double jazz album from 1989.\n\nGuillaume Du Fay: Motets, Hymns & Chansons BLUE HERON. (16 tracks, 73 minutes, $5.99). Recommended early classic music, and it is fantastic.\n\nBlues and the Abstract Truth. Oliver Nelson. (12 tracks, 77 minutes, $6.49). Highly recommended jazz album.\n\nWelcome to the Country by Gram Rabbit (10 tracks, 39 minutes, $4.90). Outstanding collection of strange psychedelic country by a group known for shifting genres often. (They do heavy metal, punk all with a psychedelic twist).\n\nSanremo in the Fifties. (43 tracks, 170 minutes, $6.49) Italian pop music culture revolves around the annual Sanremo festival which started in the 50s (and is still active). This compilation contains a lot of the contest winners (and more importantly, the ones which didn’t win but are still great songs.) Most of the recordings are decent quality\n\nSapore di Sale (100 tracks, 307 minutes, $5.99) has many of the same singers from the Sanremo collection, but different songs released in the 60s. (Some are live recordings, possibly from later Sanremos). You have to overlook the Sedaka, Paul Anka and Petula Clark here, but there are multiple songs by quite a number of singers, including Quartetto Cetra, Gino Paoli and Peppino di Capri.\n\nGreat Greek Composers (123 songs, 360 minutes, $6.49) which seems to be a wrong name for it, because all the songs are simple pop songs from several decades and the song metadata doesn’t contain any useful information on the songwriters. (Strangely it lists the musical genre as “reggae” — go figure). Someone mentioned that it sounds like Schlager music (that light-hearted folksy stuff that seems old-fashioned to our ears), and I don’t think that’s offbase. Sound quality is mostly decent, and a few songs are standouts, though all are generally pleasant.\n\nDuo Chrisses Fones – Two Golden Voices: ROZA ESKENAZI & RITA ABATZI (45 songs, 145 minutes, $5.84) is definitely older and more folksy stuff (we’re talking 1920s-1940s). Sound quality could be a lot worse, but it’s about what you’d expect for the time. Roza Eskenazi has the more interesting and melodic voice, while Rita Abatzi sings more emotionally and wistfully. They sing in a rebetiko style, which uses various Turkish song elements. This album is more a musical time capsule than something which feels modern, but I found it interesting still.\n\nSeptember 2015. As luck would have it, there was an “accidental” Double the Value Booster credit sale and I went ahead and spent $50 to obtain $100 in credits. I have lots of things on my list but probably won’t be buying anything until early October. (For the record I’ve been listening — and rating — the 1100+ free mp3 downloads from the 2011 SXSW music torrent — which will eventually result in lots of purchases of favorite band discoveries).\n\nTrilogie de la Morte by Eliane Radigue. costs $5.99 here for a total of 168 minutes. It’s drone/ambient, very meditative, but interesting enough to keep your attention. The allmusic review said “it is based on the composer’s complete immersion in Tibetan Buddhist teaching, and takes its title from Thomas Merton’s Trilogy on Death.”\n\nHot French Chicks in the Garage. (37 tracks, 91 minutes, $5.99). Compilation of French female singers from the 60s and 70s.\n\nPerfect Lives by Robert Ashley. (7 tracks, 174 minutes, $6.49). Avante-garde opera project from late 70s, consisting of long, extended arias in English which consist of nonsequiturs, strange poetic pronouncements and pop culture. Ashley intended this to be “opera for TV” (and indeed, there is a DVD version of the performance which makes this intent apparent). and it resembles the ramblings in Glass’s Einstein on the Beach.\n\nBunny Striker Lee Story. (101 tracks, 316 minutes, $5.99), Giant compilation of 60s and 70s Jamaican reggae by a noted music producer.\n\nAugust 2015. I bought another booster credit, so the buying spree continues (at least for the next month). I’m still buying things from my SXSW and the Russian Music stack (see below). Because I’m out of work again, I couldn’t max out on booster packs, but these 2 for 1 booster pack sales are coming every 3 months, so that gives me time to catch up on listening.\n\n50 Tunes of Jazz from Venus Records. (50 tracks, 239 minutes, $6.49). Compilation of a jazz label from Japan. Generally great stuff.\n\nDeep Soul Moments: Sometime, Someplace, Somewhere. (27 tracks, 67 minutes, $3.24) Outstanding collection of 60s soul. Slow melodies and vocals.\n\nIllinoise by Sufjan (22 tracks, 74 minutes, $4.99).\n\nCecil Gant Collection 1944-1951 (52 tracks, 143 minutes, $6.49). Bluesy vocalist and pianist with some boogie woogie inclinations.\n\nJailhouse Blues & Murder Ballads (180 tracks, 570 minutes, $6.49).\n\nMose Allison Collection 1956-1962 Volume 1 and Volume 2 (Each costs $6.49 and consists of 146 minutes). Jazzy blues singer and pianist who collaborates with Stan Getz and Zoot Sims. His band plays many jazz standard here. Great stuff, relaxing, joyful, Still alive today!\n\nComplete Singles A’s and B’s 1949-1962 Vol 2 by B.B. King.\n\nDark Light Up by Eleni Mandell. (12 tracks, 39 minutes for $6.99). Eleni Mandell is not known for mainstream pop, but this album tries to do that — and mostly succeeds.\n\nThe Peregrine by Lawrence English. (34 minutes for $3.43) Recent ambient recording.\n\nMargaret Whiting: Collectors’ Edition 1942-1960. (87 tracks, 236 minutes, $5.84) Whiting sang a lot of vanilla jazz standards in the 1940s, but her interpretations are so lovely and charming that I forgive her for not venturing outside familiar territory.\n\nGirl in a Coma. Tracks from all of their albums, especially Trio B.C. This is a fiesty girls punk band from San Antonio, headed by singer Nina Diaz. They famously met up in MIDDLE SCHOOL! Apparently Diaz and the rest of the band are going off on separate projects, but their Coma stuff is great. Although their original stuff is great, I wanted to point out that their album of cover songs is particularly juicy (though I checked it out of the library instead of buying it).\n\nMusic for Airports Live (Music by Brian Eno) by Bang on a Can All Stars. A music group does the impossible: perform a live performance of something originally written not to be performed. This is a classic of the New Age genre, and the live performance is faithful to the original recording –though it feels softer and more human.\n\nUnremembered. Composed by Sarah Kirkland Snider, performed by Shara Worden and others. (13 tracks, 54 minutes, $5.99).\n\nEarl Bostic Collection 1939-1959. (50 songs, 145 minutes $6.49) Really great jazz. Often compared to Sidney Bechet, this is smoother and more elegant.\n\nComplete Aristocrat and Chess Singles A’s and B’s (Volume 1 of 2) by Muddy Waters. (49 tracks, 141 minutes, $6.49). I ran out of credits, so I bought Volume 1 for now.\n\nOne Hundred Hits of Bing Crosby. (100 songs, 299 minutes, $5.99) Bing Crosby had numerous hits in the 40s, and this mega-compilation gives you a better idea of his variety of styles. Lots of random oddball tracks (such as “Road to Morocco”) make this one always delightful.\n\nJuly 2015. Note that even this month I am still adding a substantial number of albums to other lists below (like the Russian and Ukrainian compilations under June 2015 and SXSW picks under March 2015). In fact, about 95% of my purchases by rising bands come from my SXSW stack. Even though I bought them this month, they are not listed under the month I bought them. I am starting to list some jazz albums reviewed and praised by Bird is the Worm. He reviews them faster than I can listen to them!\n\nCosmopolitan Classics: George Jones. (98 Tracks, 249 minutes, $5.19) An amazing collection of songs for the price. I ended up liking every song!\n\nDub Side of the Mule Deluxe Edition (34 tracks, 227 minutes, $6.49). Recording of a live musical “happening” by the remnants of the Allman Brothers and some guests (Toots Maytal, according to this review). Apparently they release a lot of these things built around a certain theme, with them all priced pretty low on emusic.\n\nLa Sortie by Low-Res. (7 tracks, 49 minutes, $5.99). Bird Best 2014. This set of jazz pieces don’t overwhelm, but really flow well together.\n\nWurm Series No. 1. by Oophoi. (1 track, 65 minutes for 49 cents!). Great ambient track.\n\nEnter by Fire Orchestra. (4 tracks, 53 minutes, $3.30). Bird Best 2014. Great choral jazzy thing which is full of emotional power and energy. Wow!\n\nExclusively for my friends (live) by Oscar Peterson (37 tracks, 236 minutes, $6.49).\n\nKing of Highlife Anthology by E.T. Mensah and the Tempos.\n\nFigs: What Keeps me up at Night and The Figs. Two interesting albums by Louisiana blues band with Jillian Johnson (who recently was killed in a shooting in Lafayette LA).\n\nLAVINIA MEIJER Glass: Metamorphosis, The Hours. (12 tracks, 63 minutes $1.40). Amazingly these Glass-approved transcriptions for harp are terrific!\n\nVivaldi: 12 Violin Concertos – “La Cetra”, Op. 9 (36 tracks, 117 minutes, $1.40). HOLLAND BAROQUE SOCIETY. Well-reviewed album of lesser-known Vivaldi violin pieces.\n\nThe Graham Bond Organization – Wade in the Water – Classics, Origins & Oddities. (96 tracks, 308 minutes, $6.49). Outstanding early 60s British pop/jazz. Very influential on British invasion bands and others.\n\nAbsolut Duke Ellington (157 tracks, 529 minutes $6.49).\n\nDimensions Live by Daniel Schlappi, Jorg Bucher & Colin Vallon (14 tracks, 107 minutes, $6.49).\n\nMinimal Piano Collection, ( 93 tracks, 615 minutes, $4.54). performed by Jeroen Van Veen. This huge collection features generous performances from Glass, Arvo Paart, Nyman, Adams, Cage, Riley, etc). I spent all morning listening to the Aarvo Paart, this evening listening to the Glass and can happily report that it is generally excellent and an extraordinary value!.\n\nJune 2015. Not only did I purchase $150 of double-booster credits, I discovered some great Russian music compilations which I’ll note below.\n\nBoys can be Mean.60 tracks – $5.84. Fun thematic 60s compilation about girls complaining about boys.\n\nNigeria 70 Lagos Jump.16 tracks, 77 minutes for $5.99\n\nNigeria 70 Sweet Times Afro-Fun, Highlife and Juju from 1970s Lagos. 79 minutes, 13 tracks, $5.99\n\nI Hate CDs: Norton Records 45 RPM Singles Collection Vol 1.\n\nRoadrunner 1955-1962 Original Chess Masters (Remastered Edition). Bo Diddley.\n\nComplete Chess Singles As & Bs 1955-1961. Chuck Berry.50 tracks for $6.49\n\nComplete Soul Essentials by Ike and Tina Turner. 75 tracks for $5.84. The version of some of the signature songs is different (and probably inferior), but the vast collection covers the range of songs Ike and Tina used to sing.\n\nVarious songs of Novecento. C’ E’ Un Mondo Che… (complete album) and 4 songs each from these albums: Dreamland, Necessary and Secret. Novecento is an Italian band that started out in 1980s Euro-disco pop and gradually migrated into Jazzy Easy Listening pop. Perhaps it seems way too mellow for the modern ear, but it is extremely relaxing and pleasant to listen to. Female singer Dora Carofiglio was the “real” Jessica Jay in the 90s dance pop band (which I wrote about at length here).\n\nTwo famous multidisc recordings by jazz legend Hampton Hawes: All Night Sessions! 1-3 with Jim Hall (17 tracks, 123 minutes, $5.84) and Trio: Complete Albums (featuring Red Mitchell & Chuck Thompson). (35 tracks, 156 minutes, $6.49).\n\nTristeza / Poema / Canto / Images On Guitar. BADEN POWELL . Classic 60s albums by a famous 60s Brazilian guitarist.\n\nChavela Vargas. Sus 40 Grandes Canciones. (40 tracks, 134 minutes, $5.84).\n\nBuckle Up by Steve Krase. (10 tracks, 39 minutes $4.90) Great electronic blues/rock band led by Krase who plays a mean harmonica. I saw him perform with Trudy Lynn last night; they were fantastic!\n\nRoyal Oaks Blues Cafe by Trudy Lynn (with Steve Krase). Trudy sings some rowdy libidinous blues even though she’s in her 70s. Direct, comic and slightly outrageous.\n\n40 Successos de samba & Bossa Nova. Elis Regina. (40 tracks, 110 minutes, $5.99). Great collection of songs by the famed bossa nova singer who died in her thirties.\n\n25 Years of Brazilian Beats (Mr. Bongo Presents) Part 1 and Part 2.\n\nJelly Roll Morton — Complete Congress Recordings.\n\nDigital Collection Vol 4. Noor Jehan. Here are the Punjabi language songs.\n\n100 Anos de Historia Musical Vol 3. Lucho Bermudez. (20 tracks, 57 minutes $6.49). Wish it had more tracks, but the ones here are dynamite.\n\nLouisiana & The Old New Orleans Sound. (100 tracks, 285 minute, $5.84).\n\nAmara Toure 1973-80. (10 tracks, 63 minutes, $5.99) Influential 70s Senegal singer with a Cuban/Afrobeat feel.\n\nSpecial Russian and Ukrainian Compilations. As strange as it sounds, I finally found some reasonably-priced Russian/Ukrainian albums on emusic.Typing the words Grand Collection produces a list of double size compilation albums by several well-known Russian pop singers. Also try searching for “Коллекция”in the search engine. Unfortunately the links of titles with Cyrillic letters doesn’t work too well, so most of these links will not link. Often copying the Cyrillic names into the emusic search engine will work, or sometimes just searching google can help.\n\nКоллекция лучших альбомов. Анна Герман (Anna Hermann) (8 hours for 120 tracks, $5.99). Hermann was a much beloved Polish singer who died early but was widely beloved in the 70s and 80s by the entire Soviet Union. Sound quality on this collection varies, but it contains a lot of her hits which made her famous.\n\nАЛСУ – GRAND COLLECTION / ALSU (known also as Alsou). (28 tracks, 101 minutes, $5.99). (listen on youtube). Alsou is a beautiful singer and was predicted to appeal to Western audiences. That didn’t happen as much as it should have; she did win 2nd in a Eurovision contest for an utterly forgettable song, but make no mistake; she’s a major talent, and her tracks always sound great!\n\nGrand Collection. DIDULYA (ДИДЮЛЯ). (79 minutes, 19 tracks, $5.99). Great guitar-driven pop by a Belorussian guy who likes to infuse folk and Middle East elements into melodies.\n\nКоллекция легендарных песен. ГРАЖДАНСКАЯ ОБОРОНА (Grazhdanskaya Oborona). (85 tracks, 260 minutes, $5.99). Oborona is an early Soviet punk-psychedelic singer (and I do not exaggerate when I compare their early stuff to Sex Pistols or the Ramones or the Residents). I like how the wikipedia article describes the band’s lyrics as progressing from the political to the metaphysical. (Alas, if only my Russian were good enough to understand them! — But I find the literary references mentioned in the wiki page reassuring).\n\nКоллекция. АНДРЕЙ ГУБИН. (Andrey Gubin). (42 tracks, 167 minutes, $6.49). Upbeat dance pop, full of catchy numbers.\n\nЯ не скажу “прощай” by Татьяна Овсиенко. (17 tracks, 65 minutes, $6.49). A good Ukrainian pop singer. Very sophisticated dance pop with some slow ballads thrown in.\n\nБольшая коллекция, Часть 2 by “АЛЁНА АПИНА” (Elena Apina). This is only part 2 of a box set, but this part contains 50 songs and 184 minutes of dance and disco fun by one of the leading Russian pop singers in the 90s. (She is also one of my fave singers too).\n\nGrand Collection: Леонид Агутин. (Leonid Agutin). 112 minutes 28 songs. $5.99.. Agutin has a smooth almost Latino singing style which won me over when I first heard him in the 90s. This compilation contains the songs from those albums and more recent stuff as well.\n\nSkryabin. Selections from Various Albums. Ever since the lead singer died a year ago, I wanted to revisit this Ukrainian band which I used to listen to while living in Ukraine. Despite the fact that it cost more (about $20 in credits), I ended up buying selected songs from various albums. Their eclecticism of styles reminds me of Talking Heads (although Skryabin is definitely cooler, darker, moodier). If I were to single out some albums, I would have to pick Mova Ryb (very upbeat and pop) and the 82 minute compilation album Balady.\n\nGrand Collection: БОЖЬЯ КОРОВКА (“Lady Bird”). Zany light hearted pop from a male-female singing duo.\n\nGrand Collection: Vitas. (28 tracks, 105 minutes, $5.99). Ukrainian-born Russian pop singer with an operatic voice, crazy appearance and who sings techno-dance songs. This reminds me a lot of Ukrainian singer El Kravchuk (whose album I also bought on emusic).\n\nКоллекция ФИЛИПП КИРКОРОВ (Collectsya by Phillip Kirkorov) . 952 minute 246 track album for $6.49. Phillip Kirkorov is a major presence for the last few decades in Russian pop (kind of like Elton John or Neil Diamond for the English-speaking world). An awesome deal. A lot of these tracks are winners!\n\nValentina Levko: Star of the Bolshoi is a (176 tracks, 676 minutes, $4.54 fascinating 10 hour collection of arias and classical songs by a Russian singer. I have only sampled some of the tracks; the ones I know sound excellent.\n\nБольшая коллекция by СУРГАНОВА И ОРКЕСТР. (129 tracks, 490 minutes, $6.49). Pop band headed by Svetlana Surganova. Really interesting sound; it combines folk, jazz and classical elements to produce a nice pop sound. Her singing is gentle and relaxed, and the melodies and productions are always interesting.\n\nМИХАЙЛ ШУФУТИНСКИЙ – GRAND COLLECTION. MIKHAIL SHUFUTINSKY. (28 tracks, 109 minutes, $5.99). This zany album consists of a lot of live traditional tracks. They sound a lot better than the two studio albums I have by him.\n\nЛучшее by ИГОРЬ ТАЛЬКОВ (Igor Talkov). (50 tracks, 252 minutes, $5.99). Collection of a Russian music icon. Parts of it sounds rough and downbeat, but remember, this was the 80s and 90s. Most of the hits I already know were here — and then some. Curiously missing was my favorite song “Летний дождь” (Summer Rains) which you can download separately from the Моя любовь album.\n\nВсе пучком by ПОТАП И НАСТЯ (Potap i Nastya) (23 tracks, 56 minutes, $5.99). Outstanding upbeat pop/rapping duo from Ukraine. This group produces so many fun and amazing songs (and vids!) that it’s a wonder they are still unknown in the West. Also, highly recommended was their earlier album Не люби мне мозги which was just as amazing (though I didn’t buy it from emusic; I checked it out of the library).\n\nВремя и Стекло by Время и Стекло (Vremya i Steklo , or Time & Glass) (18 tracks, 58 minutes, $5.99). Very young and telegenic Ukrainian dance pop duo from the same label as Potap i Nastiya. They sing more dancey/EDM; Less clever than Potap i Nastiya but more stylish.\n\nVerka Serduchka: (ВЕРКА СЕРДЮЧКА) Selections from various albums such as Do Re Mi and Tralli Valli .Serduchka gained notoriety with his outrageously fun song in a 2007 Ukraine Eurovision performance. Though his comedy songs are great (and make great vids), the more mainstream songs are good too. Let’s give him credit for reinventing the folk pop song.\n\nIrina Bilyk (ИРИНА БИЛЫК). Selections from various albums. By the way, I saw Bilyk perform at a concert in Lutsk, Ukraine in 1997 with a similar Russian singer, Linda. Bilyk’s songs are pleasant, moody, lightly arranged. Fast techno dance track often combines with a slow downbeat (almost whispering) style of singing. (which reminds me a little of Suzanne Vega). Her 1995 album Нова consists of mainly dance-techno songs and has lots of great moments. The 1996 Так прост doesn’t have as many memorable melodies, but lots of good vocals and arrangements. Later albums are more lyrical (and not as successful). I ended up loving her slower 2014 album Рассвет. This singer has definitely grown on me over the decade.\n\nБлаго дарю by ОЛЬГА ГОРБАЧЕВА (Olga Gorbacheva). (43 minutes, 12 tracks, $5.88) Cute young blond who sing serious/sincere songs in the same vein of Irina Bilyk (indeed this album shares a track with Bilyk’s 2014 album which I mentioned above).\n\nНЕАНГЕЛЫ: Selections from two albums Best of and Роман. I would describe this as dramatic but unostentatious pop with a slow and slick techno sound. It’s fast and danceable but not particularly memorable; at the same time, it’s pleasant enough to listen to.\n\nLive Шоу “Каролина” by Ани Лорак (Ana Lorak). (25 tracks, 103 minutes, $5.99). Spectacular concert by Ukraine’s music superstar. This concert (which is fully available on youtube) has lavish sets, a full band and chorus and several surprise guests. The songs are not as amazing as the electrifying way they are performed. In fact, I’m at a loss to provide an American equivalent. Perhaps Jennifer Lopez or Diana Ross or Shania Twain or Tina Turner. She’s not rap or really EDM, but more traditional singing which really soar when she’s in a duet with frequent guests.\n\nКоллекция легендарных песен by ОЛЕГ МИТЯЕВ (Oleg Mityaev). (50 tracks, 171 minutes, $5.99). Megacompilation by Russian bard/folk singer who got started in the early 1980s. His style is traditional folk (and frankly the melodies can get monotonous). About half the tracks are live recordings, and most consist of some combination of piano, accordian or acoustic guitar. Some of the slower ballads are gems. Fun fact; he hails from Chelyabinsk (near the Ural Mountains). In late November as I write this, its temperature is 17 degrees F below zero!\n\nMay 2015. I have been winnowing my list of SXSW performers and will soon buy albums by new talents (see April 2015).\n\nMilton Hopkins and Jewel Brown. (41 minutes, 12 tracks for $5.88). Jewel Brown was the main singer when Louis Armstrong was touring overseas in the 50s and 60s. Jewel Brown is no Ella Fitzgerald, but she has some great songs — most of which are hard to find because they were recorded under the name of Armstrong’s band at the time. Brown retired in 1971 for personal reasons, living in Houston, running a hair salon and doing the occasional concert. In the last few years she has been performing with local blues legends, and this album is one of these collaboration. This album combines a bluesy guitar with Jewel Brown’s lively singing. It’s more bluesy than jazz, but it’s still a worthy album and a lot of fun.\n\nBlade Runner: 30th Anniversary Celebration (Music from the Motion Picture). Apparently there has been no full release of the actual mysterious Vangelis soundtrack, but this musician decided to reconstruct the soundtrack in its original form as best as he could. It sounds great and apparently has satisfied most of the people who were complaining about the previous soundtracks.\n\nAll Your Love by Siti Nurhaliza. (10 tracks, 42 minutes, $4.90). Nurhaliza is an amazing (and beautiful to look at) Malaysia singer who I discovered during my yearlong period of downloading all sorts of pirated albums from Audiogalaxy in 2001. I loved her stuff to death. Fun, pop and catchy in an Asian way. This English album probably isn’t her best, but it’s in English, has some good songs and is the only thing emusic has by her. Which is fine (for now at least).\n\nGrandes voces melodicas. Leonardo Favio. (30 tracks, 93 minutes for $5.99). Longest compilation of this versatile Argentine singer, actor and director. Mainly love ballads and random stuff; some very catchy stuff here which when combined with Favio’s brooding and poetic voice make this a winner.\n\nBest of Ho Ngoi Ha. (23 tracks, 101 minutes, $5.99). I first heard this woman sing the traditional part on a great and funky duet on Suboi’s rap album. This is also a good collection (though the arrangements are fairly minimalist and the songs slow and bland).\n\nLive in 67 (by John Mayall’s Bluesbreakers). (13 tracks, 77 minutes for $6.37). Outstanding but low-fidelity live performances of John Mayall and the three founding members of Fleetwood Mac. Amazing stuff.\n\nThe Yardbirds Story by Giorgio Gomelsky. (89 tracks, 290 minutes for $6.49). Amazing 4 CD collection of Yardbird stuff between 1963 and 1966.\n\nDon’t Think I’ve Forgotten: Cambodia’s Lost Rock and Roll. Music Soundtrack. 20 tracks, 68 minutes, $5.99).\n\nAcadian All-Star Special: The Pioneering Cajun Recordings of J.D. Miller. 78 tracks, 209 minutes for $7.50) . Pioneering is a fine word for this great compilation of early Cajun stuff. Apparently JD was a collector of old 78s, and these haven’t been heard in a long time.\n\nOndatrópica by Ondatrópica. (Soundways Recording). (19 tracks, 77 minutes). Multigenerational collaboration of Columbian singers (old and new), featuring cumbia mixed with a variety of contemporary styles.\n\nPredestinación by ARIES VIGOTH. 12 tracks, 47 minutes for $6.49.\n\n20 Exitos De Cristina Maica CRISTINA MAICA. 20 tracks, 60 minutes for 5.99.\n\nEkstasis (Expanded). Julia Holter. (15 tracks, 92 minutes for $6.49). Experimental mood music.\n\nVarious 80s Ital0-Disco compilations, starting with this double-disc one: The Best Off Disco 70/80, Vol. 2 (30 tracks, 174 minutes, $5.99). Other volumes in the series go about 110-120 minutes. which all have about 110-120 minutes: Best of Italo-Disco Vol 1, Best of Italo-Disco Vol 2 (not to be confused with the double compilation listed above) and Best of Italo-Disco Vol 4. Personally I liked Vol 1 the best (maybe because it’s the first of the series I listened to). The vocals don’t particularly stand out, but the retro disco instrumentals can go to remarkable places. This label has a limited number of artists in its stable — and these are NOT the well-known ones in Italo disco, but these are lively and mindlessly fun.Here’s a Pitchfork article about the phenomenon: “Who on earth ever thought that these were good ideas for songs, or that they could become hits? And why, ill-fitting as it is, do I still find some of these strange songs stuck in my head? There will always be something a bit off about Italo but that might be what makes it so pliant, so resilient. It’s failures become its strengths. Its sexiness is like a mannequin posed for a hug, its futurism like a cyborg soaked in seawater, trying to pass as human.”\n\nApril 2015. I now have $300 worth of credits to my name. Time to do some serious music shopping. For the next few months, I can stop going for the compilations and start buying newer artists and even fit in some jazz artists (thanks to the smart reviews of the latest jazz releases on the birdistheword blog).\n\nSun Rockabilly Meltdown, (103 tracks, 236 minutes for $5.84). Besides the familiar Jerry Lee Lewis and Carl Perkins, a lot of new new names to me.\n\nSnake Box by Harvey Mandel (47 tracks, 236 minutes for $6.49). Famed blues player in a gigantic box set. Incredible compilation!\n\nBoleros: Volume 1 and Volume 2 are both hefty albums, weighing in at 180 minutes each for $6. Boleros are slower, gentler songs, and both volumes contain lots of classic singers like Olimpo Cardenas, Los Ponchos, Julio Jaramillo, Los Dandys and Daniel Santos.\n\nGrandes Exitos Vol 3 and Vol 4 by Las Hermanas Calle (each are 16 tracks, 45 minutes for $6.49) Emusic didn’t have volumes 1 or 2. This sister duet from Venezuela has some lovely ballads and boleros dating over several decades. (Bio in Spanish here). Traditional but engaging stuff.\n\n(On bandcamp, not Emusic — but worth mentioning anyway because of the bargain aspect, 250 substantial tracks for minimum $18 donation). Touched Two compilation of ambient/electronic music. Quality varies (and I heard some glitchy things which I removed), but for the most part it sounds like ambient/New Age music by lots of electronic artists. (I assume that they are British/European, because the money benefits cancer research in England).\n\n(On Amazon, for $5 – $1 credit). Greatest Hits: Lean on Me by Bill Withers. (18 tracks, 74 minutes for $5 make this one a steal).\n\nEverything I do Gonh Be Funky By Allen Toussaint. (40 tracks, 107 minutes for $6). Compilation of greatest 50s, 60s and 70s arrangements of this famed Louisiana-based musical producer.\n\nHappy Times in New Orleans ( Early Sessions: 1958-1960) By Allen Toussaint. (20 tracks, 40 minutes for $6). Lively minimalist jazz piano pieces with occasional vocals.\n\nSpecial SXSW List I am keeping a separate list of SXSW finds which are priced normally — but still good deals considering the booster credits. This list will incorporate more than one month. Update: I am still only about 1/3 into my 2015 SXSW picks, and I started listening to great tracks from 2011 SXSW. For convenience I will be mingling all SXSW discoveries on this list.\n\nWalk by Suboi (9 tracks, 32 minutes for $4.41). Suboi is a Vietnamese rap singer whose songs are peppy and bilingual and fun.\n\nIt’s Alive by La Luz. (11 tracks, 33 minutes $5.39). Good upbeat girls surfer rock by a featured Los Angeles group at SXSW 2015 with hints of anarchy throughout.\n\nBernhari by Bernhari. (11 tracks, 46 minutes, $5.39). Energetic Canadian instrumental band with elements of dream pop. Absolutely original.\n\nYour Old Droog by Your Old Droog. (18 tracks, 59 minutes for $6.49). It is rare when I stumble upon a rap album which 1)is not laced with profanity, 2)has nice musical elements and clever lyrics. This album is the pleasant exception. Ironically the singer (who was initially mistaken for NAS) is actually a young Ukrainian-American living in NYC.\n\nTotal Strife Forever (Deluxe Edition), East India Youth. (12 tracks, 107 minutes, $8.99). This great electronic album also contains the 54 minutes “20,000 Leagues under the Sea.”\n\nKalaboogie and the Prosper Project by Doomsquad. (Each about 45-55 minutes for $5.99). Electronic/percussion Toronto-based band with moody hypnotic effects — including the occasional vocals. Think Yo La Tengo with a dance beat.\n\nAnother Way to Live and the World You’re Living In by Amber Digby. (35 minutes for each $5.88 album). This Houston native sings unassuming and winsome country songs which remind me a lot of Willie Nelson.\n\nHanging Spoons by Gina Chavez. (12 tracks, 55 minutes, $5.88) Eclectic half-Mexican Austin singer-songwriter who alternates between the Latino sound and Texas country — a little like Rosie Flores.\n\nWays Over Water. Fritz Kalkbreiner. (13 tracks, 72 minutes, $5.19) Berlin electronic artist.\n\nObsidian Spectre by Crosss. (8 tracks, 42 minutes for $5.99). Grandiose and Symphonic-sounding heavy metal.\n\nSolstice by the Heaters. (8 tracks, 26 minutes, $3.92). Fierce surf-psychedelic garage rock by a Michigan band. A hard pounding drum beat ensures that you don’t get lost in the haze. This band has become one of my fave discoveries from this year’s SXSW.\n\nLife as a Dog by K-Flay (11 tracks, 44 minutes, $5.39). Gnarly and Arty rap by a San Francisco girl.\n\nUnorthodox by Sno that Product. (17 tracks, 49 minutes, $5.99). Latin rapping by a tough-talking California girl. Think of Eminem, but it’s a lot more danceable. Actually she’s the Latino M.I.A. with lots of electro-pizzazz underneath the lyrics. Some pottymouth-ery, but generally there’s a social purpose behind it.\n\nNinety Thirty Thirty by Fielded. (11 tracks, 36 minutes, $5.39). Lyrical self-produced album by Lindsay Powell, a girl with a voice like Blondie, clever arrangements, surprising space melodies and deliberately slow tempos.\n\nFantastic Negrito Deluxe EP. R& B with guitars. (7 tracks, 26 minutes, $3.43).\n\nEveryone you love will be happy soon. by Quiet Company (15 tracks, 60 minutes, $5.99). Plaintive country rock.\n\nLoose Ends by Francisco the Man. (10 tracks, 50 minutes, $6.99)\n\nInsides by Fort Rameau. (8 tracks, 52 minutes, $6.99).\n\nUnder the Surface by Marit Larsen. 11 tracks, 37 minutes, $5.99. Larsen is a Norwegian pop sensation and songwriter who seems like a less angrier version of Alanis Morissette.\n\nWhere We All Live EP by Wheelchair Sports Camp. 6 tracks, 24 minutes for $2.94. A sort of rap/jazz/punk band from Denver fronted by a rapping girl in a wheelchair. Sounds like a freakshow, but it’s actually good music — and also very fun.\n\nBlack Hole Lace. by Kemp & Eden. (9 tracks, 30 minutes, $4.41) Slow and Arty two-part harmony dream pop by two cute girls with offbeat lyrics.\n\nSelections from Analog Rebellion. Texas Songwriter Daniel Hunter writes a lot of off the wall songs with bizarre themes and lyrics, but the music is always remarkable. Hunter’s band is prolific, and I ended up picking songs from all his albums. The albums I took the most songs from included: Ancient Electrons, Evaders, and Cavanaugh, Something.\n\n1993-2003: 10 Years of K’s Choice. Compilation. 18 tracks, 64 minutes for $5.99 Laid back 90s grrl rock. It probably needs to be rowdier, but a good restrained Greatest Hits album.\n\nWaving at the Sun by K’s Choice. 12 tracks, 34 minutes, $5.88. More recent album by the band which is absolutely ethereal.\n\nYou can’t take a bad girl home. Fabulous Ginn Sisters. (10 tracks, 33 minutes, $4.90).\n\nCollection 1: An Embarrassment of richard. by Richard Barone. (15 tracks, 63 minutes, $5.99). Volume 1 compilation album of Richard Barone, singer for the Bongos and music producer who writes slow catchy pop songs. Update: I also bought Collection 2: Before and Afterglow (22 tracks, 76 minutes, $5.99) which I liked even better. It’s slower, more interesting and still fun.\n\n2 Albums by Secret Colours: Peach and Positive Distractions.\n\nSelections from Extra Classic. (From Showcase and You Light like White Elephants). This San Francisco group plays a lot of easygoing dub/reggae (more). The songs are somewhat interchangeable, but the girl’s singing and the jamming guitars makes it refreshing to listen to.\n\nMarch 2015. Wow, another booster credit sale! Although I will be scoping out the mega-compilations, I want to grab some by newer artists, especially discoveries from SXSW.\n\nBoston by Fleetwood Mac (30 tracks, 213 minutes for $11.80). Great and expansive blues track by early Fleetwood Mac when Peter Green was fronting it.\n\nFeb 2015. Finishing off the credits and returning to normal. But I still have a lot of megacompilations to buy! Over the last 3 months I seem to be getting most of my emusic recommendations from a single forum post about multidisc compilations. Indeed, I’ve added a lot to this thread as well.\n\nRare Soul and R&B Masters. (100 tracks, 263 minutes for $6.49). Wonderful collection of singers and songs I have never heard of. I had expected to recognize a few names, but with the exception of Tony Orlando(!), Brenda Lee (!) and Gloria Gaynor, none of them ring a bell. Like other compilations, these are digitalizations of “needle-drop recordings” from the 60s, but they are still lively and good-sounding.\n\nMag All Stars Vol 1 and Vol 3 are compilations of lively 50s Peruvian nightclub gems. Lots of salsa/mambo/nutty jazz stuff by unfamiliar names. Each about 71 minutes for $6.49, both are great deals which come from Repsyched Records.\n\nLucho Gatica. (107 tracks, 350 minutes). This A to Z collection is a grabbag, but it contains the major hits of this Latin American singer.\n\nJan 2015. Continuing to spend the booster credits from last month.\n\nFive Album Set & Bonus EPs. (72 tracks, 291 minutes for $5.99). The American Dollar. Great rock instrumentals which have a symphonic quality. Engaging, exciting (like early Rush).\n\nPetula Clark Legacy. (57 tracks, 150 minutes, $6.49).This generous album contains mainly minor tracks, show tunes and cover tunes– before Petula Clark hit the big time and started producing great 60s rock songs. But the songs here show an earlier style; they are fascinating, very hummable and entertaining. The good news is that there is virtually no overlap between this album and the more conventional compilation Petula Clark albums. See also the practically identical compilation It Had to Be You. Unfortunately the best compilation of her rock period (Ultimate P.C.) used to be on emusic, but was taken off during last year’s exodus of big labels.\n\nIbiza’s House of House (Compilation 52 tracks, 323 minutes, $5.99). This excellent and long compilation of recent progressive trance has many high moments, plus the songs are all unedited, so you get the full versions.\n\nCountrypolitan Classics by Eddie Arnold (44 tracks, 121 minutes for $5.19). This Great series contains long compilation of country legends for bargain prices.\n\nLo mejor de Julio Jaramillo (78 tracks, 224 minutes for $5.84). Great compilation by the great Ecuadorian singer.\n\nCuba Cubaneando by Benny More (91 tracks, 273 minutes for $5.84). Great combination of old tracks by this Cuban crooner.\n\nBest of Caterina Valente. (52 tracks, 151 minutes, $6.49).Really outstanding compilation of 50s and 60s showtunes/Latino and early rockish sounds by an Italian singer who also made it very big in US and other countries. I loved almost every song. Some of them were just wacky!\n\nIndie Psyche Rock: Rare Recordings from the Attic (58 tracks, 176 minutes $5.84) This is a great, energetic and zany compilation. Really one of my favorite emusic purchases!\n\nDecember 2014/January 15. Another 2 for 1 Booster Credit Month. This time I bought $75, so I’ve been buying a lot of stuff.\n\nCelia Cruz la Reina de Cuba. (45 tracks/126 minutes for $6.49).\n\nScared to get happy (Compilation of British punk hits — 50 tracks/149 minutes for $6.49). Update: Further listening to this album makes me less than impresed.\n\nVA – Kerrville Folk Festival – The Early Years 1972-81 ($6.49, 518:08, 135 tracks)and VA – Kerrville Folk Festival – The Silverwolf Years ($6.49, 397:56, 95 tracks)\n\n100 Años de Historia Musical, Vol. 1 and Vol 2 by Lucho Bermudez (each 60 minutes for $6.50). Latin America’s equivalent to Benny Goodman and Big Band. Great stuff.\n\nLos Reyes del Merengue by CHAPUSEAUX Y DAMIRÓN (12 tracks for 30 minutes). A really fun and elegant album by the great merengue masters. Appearances by vocalist Sylvia de Grasse and flautist Gilberto Valdes really balance it all out and make it feel like a magical combination.\n\nDiscos Fuentes Guillermo Buitrago Collection (25 tracks, 74 minutes for $5.99)\n\nDiscos Fuentes Pedro Laza Collection PEDRO LAZA Y SUS PELAYEROS (25 tracks for 68 minutes for $5.99)\n\nWartime Years — Wartime Memories, (200 tracks, 596 minutes for $6.49)\n\nMoochin’ Abouts Stateside Hitlist 1962 (292 tracks, 760 minutes for $6.49).\n\nMoochin’ about Bossa Nova, (70 tracks, 217 minutes for $6.49).\n\nVarious psychedelic compilations: London Underground ,(46 tracks, 156 minutes for $6.49), Rare Tracks (89 tracks, 256 minutes for $4.40), 100 Psychedelic Trips (Stoner Rock, Garage Rock, Acid Rock) (100 tracks, 328 minutes for $5.84).\n\nWussy, Attica. (11 tracks, 42 minutes for $5.39). Rated A+ by Robert Christgau\n\nRetrospektive Deluxe Edition by Nektar. (38 tracks, 194 minutes for $5.84). Great symphonic rock.\n\nGirls, Girls, Girls, Vol 1. (174 tracks, 421 minutes). Random grabbag of unknown female tracks from 50s and 60s. I recognized almost none of them!\n\nNovember 2014. OMG 2 for 1 Booster Credit Month. Time to go crazy!\n\nCity: Works of Fiction (Expanded Edition) by Jon Hassell. (202 minutes for $8.60) Phenomenally interesting free form ambient jazz soundscapes by a well known avante-pop artist who frequently collaborates with Brian Eno. This totally wowwed me and I am looking forward to picking up Fourth World: Volume 1, which is a classic work which should be available in digital form very soon.\n\nGrandes Exitos de Tete Montoliu . More of the great Spanish jazz pianist (See my comments below).\n\nKenya Special: (Selected East African Recordings from the 1970s and 1980s). Another great Soundways compilations. Unfortunately overpriced at 11.98, I can afford it with my booster pack credits.\n\nBlind Troubadour of Oaxaca . Alonzo Cruz. Damn those overpriced high-quality Smithsonian Edition recordings. Here’s a 42 minute compilation from the 1960s which is great, spare and memorable.\n\nMyaskovsky: Selected Symphonies. 204 minutes for $6.50\n\nTwo Marimbas from Oaxaca, Mexico . by FAUSTINO GONZÁLEZ RIVERA AND SILVERIO PASTELÍN NAVARRO\n\nSalmanov: Symphonies Nos. 1-4 (Live). 115 minutes for $6.50\n\nVarious Punk 45 Compilations from the 1970s. “There Is No Such Thing As Society: Get A Job, Get A Car, Get A Bed, Get Drunk! Underground Punk in the UK 1977-81”,\n\nStill Some Light by Bill Fay (123 minutes for $6.49). Soulful and almost spiritual ballads with a New Age sound. Bill Fay is an overlooked gem.\n\nAfrosound of Columbia Vol 1 (158 minutes, 43 tracks for $5.84).\n\n2001-9, Durutti Column, (329 minutes for $11.96).\n\nJazz on Film (New Wave) Vol 1-7. (385 minutes for $6.49). Great stuff from European 60s films\n\nEl Barrio: Ultimate Collection of Latin Boogaloo, Disco, Fun & Soul (Fania Records). (240 minutes for 6.50). Good collection by a major U.S./ Latin label from the 60s. This label brought us a lot of names which we regard as household names in Latin music now.\n\nClair Denis Film Scores 1996-2009 by Tindersticks. (189 minutes for $3.89).\n\nMoochin’ about Stateside Hitlist (1961). (853 minutes for $6.49).\n\nThe Bats: Volume 1. (169 minutes at $6.99). Great compilation of a leading 90s Australian punk band.\n\nJazzactuel: Collection of avante-garde/free jazz psychedelia from 1969-1971 (223 minutes for $5.99). Pretty trying cerebral tracks, but a good change of pace.\n\nOctober 2014. Classical music time:\n\nComplete Symphonies by Shostakovich , 700 minutes for $6.49, conducted by KIRILL KONDRASHIN. See this laudatory article about this cycle.\n\nCantares de la Revolución Mexicana y Canciones Norteñas, Various. (117 minutes for $6.49). This random 2 disc compilation of songs from the Mexican Revolution period (1910-1920) stands out as containing a fair number of well-known singers and unknowns, not terrible sound quality (though not great), a variety of songs and really beautiful melodies.\n\nMusic for Anna by Tete Montoliu. Excellent bargain-priced ($3!) jazz session in the later part of Montoliu’s career. This Spanish jazz pianist seems to be little known, and yet his career spans decades. Next month I will definitely be grabbing the Grandes Exitos de Tete Montoliu (105 minutes for 5.84) which takes from several different albums.\n\nSeptember 2014. Amidst the scary announcement that emusic is dropping lots of titles by the big labels, there is still lots of good indie stuff to get into:\n\nDeep in the Shallows by The Church.(154 minutes for $6.49). Outstanding compilation of 20 years of hits by this Australian jangle rock band. One reviewer called the songs on CD 2 to be amazing, and I agree. As the album winds down, the sound is more balanced and moodier. Less about trying to rock you, more about trying to grasp at something unfathomable.\n\nСпасибо by Zemfira (ЗЕМФИРА). Zemfira is a female singer who hit the Russian pop scene in the 1990s with her self-titled debut album. All my students liked her, and I did too. 15 years later, I can’t help but wonder what she has done in the meantime. Here’s the answer! Although some of her intervening albums were forgettable, this one had lots of great moments.\n\nAugust 2014. I upgraded my membership so I had $16.99 of credits per month by paying $134 for the year. On another note, I made a major purchase of used CDs from half.com, including a bunch of ultracheap imports of jazz box sets and all sorts of random 90s stuff. So I haven’t been wanting for music.\n\nRCA 100 Anos de Musica by Tony Camargo. (107 minutes for $11.10) As tempting as the RCA 100 Anos de Musica compilation albums are, I’ve resisted because they are so damn expensive. Instead, I have been downloading for free from Freegal select songs by Pedro Vargas, Roberto Jordan, Armando Manzanero, Los Churumbules de Espana (awesome!), Emmanuel and other collections. But I couldn’t resist the Camargo collection; it sounds like early Tito Puente or 1940s Big Band; almost every track is fun and fresh.\n\nSelf-Titled by Ultimate Spinach, (9 tracks, 36 minutes for $4.41). Good 60s psychedelic music from Boston. In September I also bought the excellent sequel Behold and See soon.\n\nJuly 2014. They had their 2 for 1 emusic credit special, so this month will have some intense purchases. (Also I checked out some amazing things from the library and bought several amazing used CDs. Many titles were inspired by this great list of emusic albums (which is further evidence that great evidence are everywhere if only they can be noticed).\n\nCar Wash OST by Rose Royce (73 minutes for $5.19). A terrific album with lots of funkiness and soul. Great jazzy instrumentals too. I saw the movie for the first time a few months ago and couldn’t believe how awesome the background music sounded.\n\nВ Добрый Час (Good Luck) (1986) by Time Machine (Машина времени). Some light-hearted songs with a folk feel but also keyboard and guitar and hints of rock and roll. This 38 minute album from the 80s capture the early adventures of the group. Stylistically it reminds me of the Beatles’ Yellow Submarine phase — frivolous, lackadaisical and a good kind of weird.\n\nSpeak No Evil by Wayne Shorter (48 minutes, 7 tracks for $3.89).\n\nWattstax: The Living Word, VA. (Live Concert). (47 tracks, 224 minutes for $11.10). Classic blues concert (which was later made into a blues documentary). Also, I added a few extra tracks from Wattstax: Highlights from the Documentary which were not included in the main concert album.\n\nLive at the Summit Club by Johnnie Taylor. (10 tracks, 64 minutes for 5.19, but you can skip the first track, which is just an introduction). This concert was recorded for inclusion in the Wattstax documentary, but only one of the songs ended up being used. Here’s what was left on the cutting room floor.\n\nHello Avalanche by Octopus Party. ($6 for 43 minutes). This Austin avante garde electronica band is fun and soothing and silly. All their albums can be streamed on their bandcamp site, but the albums are cheaper to purchase on emusic. It’s worth noting that their band site has several free downloads.\n\nLift Your Skinny Fists like Antennas to Heaven by Godspeed you! black emperor. ( 4 tracks, 87 minutes for $5.84). Symphonic space rock composition which is purely instrumental, gradually building up and exciting.\n\nGreatest Rhythm and Booze Collection by Amos Milburn. ($6 for 77 minutes). Outstanding and fun 50s R&B tracks by a Houston singing legend. Update: Apparently songs from this album and other songs can be downloaded for free from archive.org . (See here and here). A cursory listen to the free tracks indicates that they don’t suck.\n\nBest of Perception & Today Records compiled by DJ Spinna and BBE Soundsystem (154 minute compilation for $6.50). Double album compilation of 70s funky NY ethnic soul. Lots of horns, instrumentals and yelling. I liked it more for the overall “sound” and the instrumentals than the vocals.\n\nRock-a-billy: Boogie Woogie Blues Man. By Roy Gaines. (37 minutes for $6). More R&B stuff by a Houstonian I hadn’t heard of. (Actually I guessed correctly that he was related to Grady Gaines of the Upsetters).\n\nFeel the Heat by Henry Paul Band. A recent Southern blues rock band with lots of power. Great mainstream kind of sound.\n\nCome Again by Even. Surprisingly engaging Australian pop band from the 1990s that has a 60s like Beatles sound (along with occasional dissonances and wit).\n\nIrish Tour by Rory Gallagher. (Live concert: 71 minutes for $4.54). Highly regarded concert of Irish blues guitarist Rory Gallagher when he was in his prime.\n\nMark-Almond ’73 by Mark-Almond. (40 minutes for $2.94). Unclassifiable downbeat rock.\n\nBlack-top Blues-o-rama Volume 4, by Various Houston blues artists performing at New Orleans (I think). Some great and powerful stuff, especially Grady Gaines and Big Robert Smith.\n\nLive by Clarence “Gatemouth” Brown. (48 minutes for $5.39). This album was dinged on allmusic for bad acoustics, but I didn’t notice it. This album shows how exciting Gatemouth can be in person (I saw him once and can attest). He floats effortlessly between genres, and this particular recording emphasizes the more energetic jazz stuff.\n\nSoul Makassa by Lafayette Afro Rock Band. (Plus 1 or 2 tracks extra from other albums including the great Ozan koukle)\n\nRosie Flores by Rosie Flores. (30 minutes for $5). Great 1987 debut album by this Texas country singer . Traditional country with a strong guitar presence and hints of rock and roll. She sticks to the genre pretty closely, and I personally prefer the more soulful songs like “Somebody loves, somebody wins” than the more upbeat numbers.\n\n#7885 Electropunk to Technopop 1978-1985 by Cabaret Voltaire. (77 minutes, 19 tracks for $7). A fairly accessible collection of CV’s midcareer works, and a good introduction to what this avante pop/electronica band was all about.\n\nFull Gain by Grady Gaines and the Texas Upsetters. (Selected tracks at 49 cents each). I spent the rest of my balance on this classic Texas saxophone-led blues band. Although the fast-paced stuff is fun and funky, the slow numbers (like If I loved you a little less and Miss Lucy Brown) are really where this band shines.\n\nJune 2014. I’m still on the basic plan (hopefully I can upgrade in 1 or 2 months). But I found 3 great low-cost LA punk compilations.\n\nBeach Blvd. Compilation (30 tracks, 65 minutes for $1.95). Here’s a Posh Boy "
