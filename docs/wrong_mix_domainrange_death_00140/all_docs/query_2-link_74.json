        "text": "CHAPTER 7\n\nTHE 1972 ELECTIONS\n\nAs the 1972 presidential election approached, the ambiguities that marked the resurgence of the New South remained. Amidst the regional mood of racial moderation, the South’s foremost congressional liberals, Gore and Yarborough, fell victims to the Social Issue, and the supreme symbol of southern resistance, George Corley Wallace, sustained and enhanced his political base. At a time when many of the old faces associated with the diehard resistance were falling by the wayside, the nationally preeminent veteran of southern resistance regained the Alabama statehouse, from where he soon launched a crusade that was to have substantial repercussions in southern as well as national politics.\n\nWallace emerged victorious from the 1970 Alabama gubernatorial primary elections in the face of formidable obstacles. Governor Lurleen Wallace had died of cancer in 1968 and had been succeeded by Lieutenant Governor Albert P. Brewer, a former Wallace protégé whose genteel style and Big Mule affiliations contrasted more sharply with Wallace’s populism than did his rather similar racial convictions. His threat to depose Wallace excited the enthusiasm of the national Republicans and the national media more than his modest accomplishments would seem to have warranted. Vice-President Agnew, Interior Secretary Walter Hickel, and Postmaster General Winton Blount, a native Alabamian, visited the state to dispense kind words for Brewer, whose fortunes were not unrelated to Republican hopes of destroying Wallace’s base for the presidential politics of 1972.\n\nBrewer ran ahead of Wallace in the May 1970 Democratic primary. He won a plurality in the metropolitan counties, carrying the blacks, who were voting against Wallace, and the affluent whites, who objected both to Wallace’s populism and to his explicit racism, or at least to Alabama’s national and indeed international reputation as a primitive and racist state. Wallace did well in the Alabama countryside and in white working-class districts to finish close behind with 40.8 percent, as compared with Brewer’s 42 percent. Most of the remaining votes went to Charles Woods, a Dothan businessman-turned-populist who campaigned against the sales tax on food and medicine, the high price of milk, and Brewer’s support of tax breaks for utilities and other industries. Wallace’s populist appeal placed him in a favorable position to attract these voters in the runoff. Wallace also once again moved rightward on the race question, attacking Brewer as the candidate who had sold out for the black “bloc vote.”1 Brewer’s moderate coalition of blacks and affluent whites carried the metropolitan counties but not by sufficient majorities to overcome Wallace’s majorities in the towns and counties, and Wallace won the nomination with a 51.6 percent majority.\n\nThe Republicans, having been devastated by the Wallace landslide of 1966, carefully avoided naming a gubernatorial nominee, thus insulating their local candidates from charges of being anti-Wallace in the campaign. Wallace therefore faced several minor candidates, including a candidate of the Whig party and Dr. John L. Cashin, a Negro dentist from Huntsville and the nominee of the predominately black National Democratic Party of Alabama. Precinct returns in Birmingham dramatically illustrated the tripartite electoral divisions that had marked the 1968 presidential contest. Lower-income whites voted heavily for Wallace, and blacks for Cashin, but Birmingham’s upper-class whites, repelled by Wallace and appalled by Cashin, cast a solid majority of their votes for minor candidates, especially Independent A. C. Shelton. Wallace waltzed to an easy victory with approximately 77 percent of the votes.\n\nHaving consolidated his power base in Alabama, Wallace turned his attention to national politics, entering the March 1972 Florida Democratic presidential primary. With ten other contenders, including all the major Democratic presidential hopefuls, Wallace’s campaign was initially given limited prospects for success. Most Florida political leaders either remained neutral in the contest or endorsed Senators Hubert Humphrey, Edmund S. Muskie, or Henry M. Jackson, at the time considered among the leading prospects for the nomination. But the Wallace campaign rapidly gained momentum; on the eve of the election, campaign aides in the Jackson, Humphrey, and Muskie camps were lamenting that “we’ve got all the officials, and, off the record, Wallace has got all the voters.”2 Wallace hammered away at the evils of busing and attacked high taxes, big government, and other national trends that he associated with the Democratic “establishment” candidates.\n\nThe returns gave Wallace a stunning 41.6 percent plurality, far ahead of Humphrey’s meager 18.6 percent and Jackson’s 13.5 percent. (No other candidate received as much as 10 percent of the vote.) Wallace won pluralities in every county in the state, but, as figure 7.1 indicates, his basic appeal was to voters in north Florida and in the rural counties in the central part of the state. In the south Florida cities his pluralities were narrow; in Miami Humphrey carried black and Jewish precincts, and Jackson ran well in upper-income white Protestant neighborhoods to limit Wallace to 27 percent of the vote. But in the north Florida countryside, the Alabamian tallied massive majorities, and in Jacksonville he won majorities in every category of white precincts, taking almost two of every three votes cast in lower- and lower-middle-income white areas and winning about 55 percent in upper- and upper-middle-status neighborhoods. Wallace received virtually no black votes, which held his Duval county total to a 46 percent plurality.\n\nOn the same ballot were three referenda soliciting voter preference for or against “forced busing,” a return to a segregated public-school system, and prayers in public schools. In a display of unusual political courage, Governor Askew campaigned against the antibusing amendment and for the antisegregation measure. But despite Askew’s efforts, a solid 74 percent majority recorded opposition to forced busing, as white Protestant voters massively endorsed the measure, while black and Jewish voters divided. But an even greater majority of almost 79 percent voted against a return to segregation in the schools, and almost 80 percent supported the reestablishment of prayer in the schools. Florida voters favored George Wallace, prayers, and integrated schools but not the use of buses to achieve integration. Both the balloting and survey data suggested that southern whites had conceded defeat on the segregation issue, but at the same time, underlying the region’s newly found racial moderation was a continuing commitment to social conservatism.\n\nLess than two months later, Wallace swept the Tennessee presidential primary with more than two-thirds of the votes, and on the same ballot approximately eight of every ten voters endorsed a referendum measure opposing the use of busing to achieve racial integration in the schools. Wallace’s substantial victory in Tennessee attracted limited national attention and a low voter turnout, since other Democratic candidates conceded the state to the Alabamian and presented no organized opposition.3 But immediately afterward Wallace faced a major challenge from a fellow southerner in the North Carolina presidential primary. Terry Sanford, a popular former governor who possessed a well-established network of political friends across the state as well as the support of Governor Robert Scott, conducted a vigorous campaign that appealed to homestate loyalties and racial moderation. Wallace insisted that Sanford, who was president of Duke University, was a front for ultraliberals attempting to derail his presidential effort and continued his assault on “the pointy-headed professors, the welfare loafers, the Rockefellers, the tax chiselers, the no-win war, the elitists, the sophisticates, the noisemakers and the faceless bureaucrats in Washington who bus your children all over creation.”4 Black Congresswoman Shirley Chisholm also campaigned actively, while Senators Muskie and Jackson, whose names appeared on the ballot, ignored the contest.\n\nAgain Wallace made an impressive showing, winning the election with a 51 percent majority and finishing well ahead of Sanford, who polled approximately 37 percent. Wallace carried the rural-small town counties, especially those in the lowlands in the eastern part of the state, and in the cities he swept the lower- and lower-middle-status white precincts by heavy majorities. Sanford ran slightly ahead of Wallace in higher-status white neighborhoods and about even with Chisolm in black districts. But while boosting Wallace’s national effort, North Carolina’s Democratic voters also favored progressive Congressman Nick Galifianakis over conservative incumbent Senator B. Everett Jordan and moderate Hargrove Bowles, a close political friend of Sanford, over Lieutenant Governor Pat Taylor. Both Galifianakis and Bowles won near majorities in the first-primary elections and one month later overwhelmed their opponents in the runoff contests by solid majorities.5\n\nThe nomination of the vigorous forty-three-year-old Galifianakis over a seventy-six-year-old Senate veteran testified to the continuing vitality of New South moderation, and similar trends were evident in primary contests in Texas and Arkansas. The electorate’s tendency to throw the rascals out was reinforced in Texas by a massive banking stock scandal that ensnared Governor Preston Smith, Lieutenant Governor Ben Barnes, and numerous other state governmental officials. Prior to the scandal, Barnes, the articulate thirty-four-year-old protégé of Lyndon Johnson and John Connally, generally had been considered the rising star in Texas politics. Both Barnes and Smith entered the Democratic gubernatorial primary but soon found themselves on the defensive, as lesser known candidates capitalized on the corruption-in-government issue.\n\nOn the left in the campaign was state Representative Frances T. “Sissy” Farenthold, who in addition to being a woman, a Catholic, and an enthusiastic supporter of the presidential efforts of Senator George S. McGovern was a plain-spoken liberal who met the Social Issue head-on by advocating liberalization of laws governing abortions, reduction of penalties for possession of marijuana, gun-control legislation, and other matters considered explosive in the Lone Star State. Although a leader of the liberal forces in the state legislature, Farenthold attracted limited aid from organized labor, which concentrated its financial and organizational resources behind Ralph Yarborough’s campaign to return to the U.S. Senate. But Farenthold’s charismatic frankness attracted an army of volunteer workers whose efforts catapulted her into the position of a major contender in the race. Her chief opponents were the “two contaminated candidates,” as she chose to describe Smith and Barnes, and “a big bowl of pablum,” by which she meant Dolph Briscoe.6 A gentleman whose overwhelming blandness rivaled Preston Smith’s, Briscoe was a west Texas banker and rancher whose holdings reputedly made him Texas’s largest landowner. Briscoe projected a staunchly conservative image, although he promised little beyond restoration of integrity in state government and opposition to any new tax measures.\n\nBriscoe finished first in the primary, while Farenthold easily outdistanced Barnes and Smith to win a spot in the runoff. The second primary was a sharp and sometimes antagonistic liberal-conservative clash. Farenthold held together the New Deal alignments in the cities. In Houston she won just above 90 percent of the votes cast in black precincts, slightly more than 75 percent in the Chicano districts, and above 55 percent in lower-and lower-middle-income white areas. Even in Waco, heartland of east-central Texas Baptist country, Farenthold won more than three-quarters of the vote in black neighborhoods and 42.5 percent in lower-income white precincts. But if the election results suggested a growing maturity in Texas factional politics in the cities, the returns also clearly indicated that rural-small town voters were not quite ready for a liberal, Catholic lady to direct matters of state. Briscoe swept the countryside and the election with more than 55 percent of the vote.\n\nAt the same time, Ralph Yarborough failed in his attempt to recapture a U.S. Senate seat. Barefoot Sanders, a moderately conservative former assistant U.S. attorney general during the Kennedy-Johnson years (whose unusual first name testified to his Indian ancestry), attacked Yarborough as an ultraliberal advocate of school busing in the runoff to win the senatorial nomination and complete the rout of the liberals for major offices (in the first-primary contest Texas voters had expressed opposition to enforced busing by more than a three-to-one majority).\n\nIn Arkansas Senator John L. McClellan, a seventy-six-year-old veteran of three decades in the Senate, narrowly survived the hotly contested Democratic primary. David H. Pryor, a thirty-seven-year-old representative from the Fourth District, in the southern part of the state, conducted an aggressive campaign, countering McClellan’s senatorial seniority with charges that the incumbent used his congressional power for the benefit of “the arrogant rich.” When McClellan raised the busing issue, Pryor announced his opposition to busing, but he gave equal emphasis to condemning politicians who used racial issues for “inflaming emotions of the people.”7 McClellan finished ahead in the primary, but his approximately 44 percent of the vote was well short of a majority, and Pryor was close behind with 42 percent. Liberal lawyer Ted Boswell, who took most of the remaining votes, promptly announced support for Pryor in the runoff. Jolted by the first-primary results and now in the unaccustomed role of something of an underdog, McClellan took full advantage of the two weeks of campaign time between the first and second primaries. The conservative incumbent conducted an energetic campaign, branding Pryor the candidate of “out-of-state labor bosses” (Pryor had received contributions from national labor unions) and hammering hard on the school busing issue.8 With support from former Governor Faubus and other old-line Arkansas Democratic leaders, McClellan squeezed by in the runoff with approximately 52 percent of the vote.\n\nWallace’s formidable performance at the polls rested on his established constituency of working-class and rural-small town whites, but in other major contests voter alignments remained relatively fluid. Farenthold appealed to a New Dealish urban constituency, while she attracted little support in the Texas countryside. Voting returns in North Carolina indicated no detectable class bias at the base of Galifianakis’s primary victory, except that he won the bulk of votes cast in black precincts. In the Arkansas runoff primary Pryor also swept the black districts in Little Rock, and he ran somewhat better in lower-status white neighborhoods than he did in upper-income white areas, although McClellan ran first in a majority of the rural-small town counties. The surprisingly strong showings by Wallace in the presidential primary elections on the one hand and by such candidates as Galifianakis, Farenthold, and Pryor on the other evidenced the ambivalent tendencies in southern politics.\n\nElsewhere in the South, Democratic primary elections tended to reward those candidates who best accommodated voters who seemingly approved of George Wallace and antibusing statements and who still showed a fondness for fresh new faces and progressive policies. In South Carolina state Senator Eugene N. Zeigler, an articulate and erudite Harvard Law School graduate who had actively supported Kennedy, Johnson, and Humphrey in successive presidential campaigns, adopted a strong law-and-order defense of social conservatism in his campaign for the Democratic senatorial nomination. Since the Republican opponent in the general election would be Senator Thurmond, most of the state’s better-known Democrats, such as former Governor Robert McNair, concluded that Thurmond could not be unseated and abandoned the contest to Zeigler and perennial liberal contender John Bolt Culbertson. Although fifty-one years old, Zeigler was otherwise in the New South tradition; a relatively new face in state politics, a close political friend of Governor John West, and a progressive in the state legislature, he was, as one journalist described him, an “Ivy League populist.”9 But in 1972 Zeigler combined his populism with a generally Wallacite stance that emphasized social conservatism. Zeigler easily defeated Culbertson for the senatorial nomination.\n\nIn Georgia Sam Nunn, an unknown south Georgia state representative with four rather undistinguished years in the legislature, won the Democratic nomination for the Senate seat made vacant by the death of Senator Richard B. Russell. During the early part of the campaign Nunn was listed with the fourteen minor candidates who were expected to flounder in the wake of the two favorites, moderate Atlanta lawyer David Gambrell, whom Governor Carter appointed to the Senate following Russell’s death in early 1971, and former Governor Ernest Vandiver, long considered a power in state politics. But the youthful Nunn adopted as his campaign slogan “Get Tough in Washington” and combined an attractive fresh face with a strong antiestablishment, law-and-order, antibusing social conservatism to win a spot in the runoff with Gambrell, while Vandiver, who in his last campaign a decade and a half before had won the gubernatorial nomination with more than 80 percent of the votes, finished a weak third. The runoff against Gambrell was a replay of the 1970 gubernatorial campaign, as Nunn, like Jimmy Carter two years before, attracted the Talmadge-Maddox-Wallace constituency of working-class and rural-small town whites to swamp Gambrell’s moderate coalition of metropolitan blacks and affluent whites.10 Similarly, Tennessee Democrats nominated lame-duck conservative Congressman Ray Blanton for a Senate seat; and in Louisiana J. Bennett Johnston, the runoff opponent of Governor Edwards in the gubernatorial primary earlier in the year, inherited the senatorial nomination when his only major opponent, veteran Senator Allen J. Ellender, died prior to the election but after the filing deadline.\n\nAlthough the deaths of Senators Russell and Ellender and the defeat of Senator Jordan in North Carolina further diminished the southern old guard in the Senate, James Eastland of Mississippi and John Sparkman of Alabama won renomination with relative ease. Eastland brushed aside minor opposition in the Democratic primary to become the Democratic nominee for the seat that he had occupied for almost three decades. In Alabama Sparkman faced a more substantial challenge. Among his six primary opponents were State Auditor Melba Till Allen, whose anticorruption campaign in state government had made her well known, and Mobile Mayor Lambert C. Mims, a Baptist lay leader. Sparkman nevertheless won a first-primary victory.\n\nThe prospect that Wallace might mount a third-party effort in the 1972 presidential campaign terminated at a Maryland campaign rally in May with an assassin’s bullets, which left Wallace grievously wounded. The Democratic party’s reformed delegate-selection process benefited minority and liberal groups in the South as elsewhere in the nation and resulted in alienating numerous Democratic conservatives and ultimately in the nomination of Senator George McGovern as the Democratic presidential candidate. Reminiscent of the Eisenhower years, some conservative Democrats turned to presidential Republicanism; former Governor John Connally of Texas became national head of Democrats for Nixon, and such conservative stalwarts as former Governor Mills Godwin of Virginia played active roles in the effort to reelect the president. With Wallace out of the race and Nixon facing the unabashedly liberal McGovern, the time for the testing of the Southern Strategy seemed to have arrived, in a year in which ten southern Senate seats and three statehouses were up for grabs.\n\nAs usual, the results of the elections were inconclusive. Nixon carried the Solid South, which voted as a bloc for the first time since 1944, by a greater margin than any other region. He took 70.5 percent of the vote, while McGovern fared more poorly than even Humphrey had done in 1968. Nixon won virtually all of the voting groups that had supported either Nixon or Wallace in 1968, which meant that the vast bulk of white Protestants, as well as most white Catholics, voted Republican in the presidential race. As table 7.3 indicates, the Republican presidential ticket swept every demographic category, most by remarkable margins, and Republican gains over 1968 paralleled very closely the 1968 vote for Wallace. In the South as in the nation Nixon ran better in the towns and counties of the countryside than he did in the cities, but even in metropolitan counties he won more than two of every three votes. In the cities the New Deal alignments that had collapsed in the Deep South in 1964 and throughout the region in 1968 were further obliterated in 1972. Table 7.4 illustrates the votes by socioeconomic and racial categories for Nixon and Wallace in 1968 and for Nixon in 1972 in three selected southern cities. In Charlotte, North Carolina, Nixon ran extremely well in 1968, while Wallace fared rather poorly. In New Orleans Nixon and Wallace split white voters along class lines in 1968. Macon, Georgia, was a Wallace stronghold in 1968, and Nixon did well only in upper-income neighborhoods. But in 1972 Nixon swept white precincts of every socioeconomic category in all three cities. Presumably the bulk of the Wallace voters rallied to Nixon, a supposition that cannot be precisely proven because of the aggregate nature of the data used here but one that certainly seems warranted by the consistency with which the combined Nixon-Wallace vote of 1968 equals the Nixon vote in 1972 (see tables 7.3 and 7.4) and by the negative correlations in every geographic and demographic category of counties between the Wallace vote in 1968 and the McGovern vote in 1972 and the corresponding positive county correlations between Wallace in 1968 and Nixon in 1972.\n\nLike Humphrey four years before, McGovern fared well only among minority voters. He won the bulk of the votes cast in predominately Negro precincts in the cities and did better in black-belt counties than in surrounding areas. Similarly, he won hefty majorities in Chicano precincts, although not by sufficient majorities to outvote the Anglos in southern Texas.11 Jewish precincts in Miami, especially the lower-income Jewish precincts, also turned in substantial Democratic majorities. But Chicano votes were influential only in Texas, and Jews were numerous only in south Florida. Throughout most of the South, McGovern’s support, like Humphrey’s, rested on a base of black voters. If the presidential election returns seemed to confirm the validity of the Southern Strategy (at least when utilized against Senator McGovern), state election results were considerably less conclusive.\n\nThe G.O.P. did make gains in the South, winning 5 of the 10 Senate elections and 1 of 3 gubernatorial contests and increasing its southern House delegation from 27 of 106 seats to 34 of 108. But given the magnitude of the Nixon landslide, southern Republicans, like Republicans elsewhere in the nation, found the Nixon coattails difficult to grasp. The party that had taught southern voters to split their tickets during the Eisenhower years became the proponent of the straight party vote, as Republican state and local candidates sought to tie themselves to Nixon and attempted to identify their opponents, no matter how conservative, with McGovern. Democratic candidates with some success frantically disassociated themselves from the national ticket, often identifying with the Wallace wing of the party; Wallace reciprocated by endorsing Zeigler in South Carolina, Nunn in Georgia, and Sparkman in Alabama.\n\nThe Republicans made their biggest breakthrough in North Carolina, capturing the statehouse and a Senate seat. The gubernatorial contest was a relatively bland affair. Republican James E. Holshouser, a thirty-eight-year-old state representative from a mountain district, differed little from Democratic Hargrove Bowles over significant issues. Both were moderates who promised economy and efficiency in government and attention to the problems of racial minorities. A wealthy Greensboro businessman, Bowles possessed an abundant campaign chest and was generally regarded as the favorite in the election. Holshouser was not only hard pressed financially, but as a result of a hotly contested Republican primary contest between Holshouser and veteran campaigner James Gardner, he headed a divided party. But the youthful Holshouser proved to be an attractive candidate in a state where Nixon won majorities in 98 out of 100 counties, and it was enough to carry him through to a narrow victory.\n\nOvershadowing the gubernatorial contest in the national media was the bitter ideological clash between progressive Democrat Nick Galifianakis and Republican Jesse A. Helms, whose political views were ultraconservative if not downright reactionary. For twelve years a television and radio editorialist, Helms in his commentaries had raged against the communist-socialist-anarchist forces behind federal governmental support for integration, social-welfare measures, trade with communist nations, foreign aid, and other acts of appeasement abroad and creeping socialism at home. During the campaign Helms sought to moderate his image by identifying himself with Nixon while seeking to tie Galifianakis to McGovern. Galifianakis staffers attained copies of Helms’s old editorials and constantly embarrassed the Republican candidate by releasing old texts that contradicted his newly found moderation, especially editorials that described major Nixon initiatives as “almost laughable” and “socialistic.”12 Helms countered by calling Galifianakis “McGovernGalifianakis” and portraying the contest as a clear choice between McGovernite liberalism and Nixonian conservatism.\n\nHelms won a convincing 54.3 percent majority, while Holshouser edged past Bowles with 51 percent. Helms ran well generally, carrying every area of the state and, in tandem with Nixon, becoming the first modern Republican to sweep the Wallacite stronghold in the eastern lowlands. He fared better in the towns and counties of the countryside than in the metropolitan areas, but even in the latter counties Helms ran slightly ahead of Galifianakis. The race-conscious lowland whites who supported Nixon and Helms cast majorities against Holshouser in the gubernatorial contest, where traditional partisan alignments reappeared as Holshouser, with his moderate stance and mountain residency, solidly carried the Republican highland redoubts, ran well ahead in the Piedmont, and lost black-belt and coastal areas to the east. Neither Helms nor Holshouser projected a consistent class appeal in the cities. In Greensboro the two Republicans did best in upper- and lower-status white precincts, while their Democratic opponents fared relatively well in middle-income white neighborhoods. In Charlotte the Republicans won majorities in every white socioeconomic category, drawing somewhat greater support in upper-income neighborhoods than in lower-income ones. But in any case, class divisions in the cities were not sharp. Helms and Holshouser both won the counties containing Charlotte and Raleigh by sweeping the white districts, while they lost heavily in black neighborhoods; both lost by relatively narrow margins most of the other metropolitan counties, again running well in white precincts and losing the black ones. Although the moderate Holshouser ran slightly ahead of the conservative Helms in the cities, the class and racial base of their urban support was similar.\n\nThe senatorial election in Virginia, like the one in North Carolina, was a relatively sharp moderate-conservative ideological clash that resulted in a significant Republican victory. Senator William B. Spong, the Democratic incumbent, had during his six years in the Senate compiled a generally moderate record, normally standing somewhere between the policies of the Nixon administration and its liberal critics, a position exemplified by his support for the confirmation of Haynsworth as a Supreme Court justice and his opposition to the confirmation of Carswell. Spong’s opponent was William L. Scott, a staunchly conservative northern Virginia congressman. Scott was a man who, as a Virginia journalist observed, tended to be “there when the lightning struck.”13 When Scott decided to seek his congressional seat in 1966, he had little trouble winning the Republican nomination, since the Democratic nominee was expected to be Howard W. Smith, a thirty-six-year veteran in the House of Representatives whom few Republicans cared to challenge. But Smith was upset in the Democratic primary by a far more vulnerable liberal contender, whom Scott then defeated in the general election.\n\nIn 1972 Scott captured the Republican senatorial nomination without opposition, since most observers considered Spong unassailable. Shortly afterward, however, Virginia Democrats became embroiled in another intraparty bloodletting that resulted in the pro-McGovern liberals winning control of the state Democratic convention. While the delegates at the meeting did not promise, as one bemused participant quipped, “to bus everyone to Canada for free abortions and infusions of marijuna,” they did present a party image that was “going to be hard to explain to the folks back home in the Third district.”14 But despite a divided party and McGovern at the head of the ticket, Spong seemed to be safely ahead until the closing weeks of the campaign, when the national Republican party channeled staffers and finances to bolster Scott’s foundering efforts. The Scott campaign began a television-radio blitz that linked Spong to gun control, busing, and George McGovern and pictured Scott firmly on the side of patriotism and Richard Nixon.\n\nThe returns gave Scott a solid victory. The Republican won a 53.7 percent majority and a lead of almost ten percentage points over Spong, since a third-party candidate drained off a small share of the votes. Like Helms in North Carolina, Scott won everywhere, carrying the past Democratic strongholds in the black-belt and tidewater counties by even greater margins than he won in the traditionally Republican mountain region. He ran better in the towns and hinterlands than in metropolitan counties, but he carried even the latter by comfortable majorities. In the cities the basic division was between Democratic blacks and Republican-trending whites, although New Deal voting alignments held up somewhat better in Virginia than they had in North Carolina. In Richmond Spong swept the black precincts, won handily in lower-income white areas, and carried the lower-middle-status whites while losing in upper-income areas. But in the white precincts in Norfolk Spong ran best in lower- and upper-income areas, while Scott swept the middle-income white neighborhoods. For the most part, in both North Carolina and Virginia Helms and Scott fared remarkably well in the bailiwicks that had once been Democratic preserves.\n\nRepublican breakthroughs on the state level were confined to North Carolina and Virginia, but three incumbent Republican senators won reelection, all by substantial majorities. In Tennessee Senator Howard Baker easily turned back Democratic Congressman Ray Blanton. Baker won just under 62 percent of the vote, running only six percentage points behind Nixon and carrying all three grand divisions by comfortable majorities. In South Carolina the venerable Strom Thurmond cruised to another victory, despite early forecasts that the veteran senator might be in serious political trouble. Democrat Eugene Zeigler, who bore George Wallace’s endorsement, conducted a vigorous campaign, attacking Thurmond’s “negative” record in the Senate and reminding voters that Thurmond had campaigned actively against Wallace in 1968. But Zeigler was no match for “ole Strom.” Thurmond added a black aide to his staff, announced a series of federal grants for South Carolina projects, a number of which were of particular benefit to black citizens, and publicized his role in accomplishing textile import agreements limiting foreign competition and protecting the jobs of white South Carolina textile workers.15 Most important, the sixty-nine-year-old senator’s twenty-six-year-old wife, a former Miss South Carolina, gave birth to their second child, effectively spiking any suggestion that the old-guard legislator was losing any of his legendary vigor. In Columbia and Charleston, Thurmond lost the black precincts by overwhelming margins as usual, but he countered by amassing huge majorities in white precincts of all socioeconomic levels. Thurmond won the bulk of votes cast by whites and the election in a state that Nixon carried with approximately 71 percent of the vote.\n\nSenator John Tower again won reelection in Texas. For the first time Tower faced a Democratic candidate (Barefoot Sanders) who was both popular with the conservative Democrats and acceptable to the liberals. As the campaign developed, however, much of the conservative Democratic establishment followed the lead of former Governor Connally in directing their efforts toward the Democrats for Nixon campaign, and the liberals, while supporting Sanders, were unwilling to make any great sacrifices for the man who had beaten Ralph Yarborough. Tower, on the other hand, monopolized the resources of the state Republican party. The Republican candidate won a formidable 55 percent majority, running best in western Texas but carrying every area of the state. New Deal voting alignments continued to hold up better in Texas than anywhere else in the region, but even here the strains were apparent. In Waco Tower did terribly in black precincts and well in upper-income white areas, but he won 45 percent in lower-income white districts and 47 percent in lower-middle-status white areas, far better than Republicans normally fared. Similarly, in Fort Worth Tower lost overwhelmingly in black neighborhoods and ran superbly in affluent white districts, but he took almost half of the votes of lower-income whites and a majority in lower-middle-income white areas. Compared with past performances, the New Deal coalition appeared intact in a state where Nixon won a two-to-one majority and Tower carried the rural counties and broke almost even in white working-class districts only when compared with other southern states.\n\nPerhaps the most revealing Texas election was the gubernatorial contest between Dolph Briscoe and Republican Henry C. Grover. A former Harris County schoolteacher, Grover had an undistinguished career in the state legislature before winning the Republican gubernatorial nomination. With the Tower forces controlling the state Republican party, Grover set out on a rather lonely campaign. The conservative Democrats worked for Nixon, the Republicans worked for Tower, and Grover, underfinanced and generally unknown, plodded along, espousing views toward governmental issues that made the conservative Briscoe seem progressive. But Briscoe had made something of a name for himself before the television cameras as a delegate to the national Democratic convention by endorsing and voting for Wallace, then shifting his vote to McGovern, and during the campaign disavowing any association with McGovern. Adding to Briscoe’s problems was the La Raza Unida party and its candidate, Ramsy Muniz. Muniz drew over 6 percent of the votes, votes that presumably would have gone to the Democratic candidate. Grover’s plurality in the metropolitan counties was sufficient to make the election a down-to-the-wire contest. Only Briscoe’s solid support in rural areas salvaged a Democratic victory. The conservative Briscoe won black precincts overwhelmingly, and he carried the working-class white districts. But with many Chicanoes defecting to Muniz and with Grover, like Tower, not only sweeping the upper-income precincts but also competing for lower-status white votes, Briscoe just managed to squeak by with a narrow plurality.16\n\nThe most notable Republican failure came in Georgia. Republican Congressman Fletcher M. Thompson had structured an immaculately conservative record in the House of Representatives since his election from an Atlanta district in 1966. Thompson had seized the busing issue, addressing rallies in Georgia to ban the use of buses to achieve integration. During his senatorial campaign, Thompson sometimes seemed to be running less against his Democratic opponent, Sam Nunn, than against school buses, McGovern, and actress Jane Fonda and former Attorney General Ramsey Clark, both of whom had visited North Vietnam and whom, according to Thompson, should be charged with treason. Visits by President Nixon, Vice-President Agnew, Senator Goldwater, and others evidenced the concern of national Republican leaders for Thompson’s campaign. But Nunn was virtually invulnerable on the Social Issue. Not only had the Democratic candidate received George Wallace’s endorsement in the campaign, but Senator Herman Talmadge, who feared a Thompson victory might tip the Senate to Republican control and terminate his chairmanship of the agricultural committee, led a concerted effort by the state Democratic leadership. While Thompson hardly suffered from lack of financial resources, the Republican could not match the organizational superiority that the Democratic county courthouses and the Talmadge network of political friends provided for Nunn.17\n\nSince political observers and the national Republican leadership had rated Thompson’s chances as rather good, his 46 percent showing was noticeably unimpressive, especially since Nixon won three of every four votes in the presidential election. But from the perspective of post-World War II Georgia partisan politics, Thompson did not fare quite so badly as first impressions indicated. In a state that had never veered from the Democratic party in presidential elections until the 1964 Goldwater victory and one where the Republican party had not even fielded a senatorial or gubernatorial candidate until 1966, Thompson ran more strongly than any other Georgia Republican, except for Bo Callaway, who polled a fraction of a percentage point better in the 1966 gubernatorial contest. Thompson carried the metropolitan counties, but he ran far more poorly in the cities than had Callaway in 1966 and even failed to match the metropolitan vote that Republican Hal Suit had received in the 1970 gubernatorial election, in part because black voters were more united in opposition to Thompson than they had been to either Callaway or Suit. But if Thompson’s avid social conservatism, which bordered on outright racism, failed unduly to impress urban voters, it was no doubt a factor in his relatively strong showing in rural counties, where he won more than 40 percent of the vote, substantially better than Georgia Republicans had done in the past. In Atlanta, most of which was within his old congressional district, Thompson carried white precincts of all socioeconomic levels by approximately the same majorities, completely annihilating the New Deal patterns that had existed in past statewide partisan contests, though not in a number of local races or in Thompson’s previous congressional contests. Table 7.6 compares the Republican votes in Atlanta in the 1966 and 1970 gubernatorial campaigns with the 1972 senatorial returns. Thompson did considerably worse in Macon, which was adjacent to Nunn’s home county of Houston, than in Atlanta. Like Grover in Texas, Thompson carried a solid majority of the votes cast by whites but not by sufficient margins to overcome the Democratic inclinations of blacks.\n\nIn Alabama the perennially vulnerable but persistently victorious Senator Sparkman overwhelmed former Postmaster General Winton Blount. Blount conducted a vigorous and well-financed campaign that contrasted the “Nixon-Blount team” with the “extreme liberal ticket headed in Alabama by Senators McGovern and Sparkman.”18 The seventy-two-year-old Sparkman, clearly showing his age, faced the Nixon landslide and the third-party candidacy of John LeFlore, a black civil-rights activist from Mobile who ran on the National Democratic Party of Alabama ticket and threatened to drain away a substantial black vote that otherwise would have gone to Sparkman. Early in the campaign, it appeared that Sparkman might be in serious trouble. But Blount’s campaign managers increasingly seemed more attuned to Madison Avenue than to the voters who had swept into office Big Jim Folsom and George Wallace. LeFlore’s candidacy foundered, ultimately taking only a fraction of the votes that John Cashin had won in the 1970 gubernatorial race. Sparkman received an endorsement from Wallace and successfully disassociated himself from the McGovern ticket, which crashed in Alabama with hardly more than a quarter of the votes. Even the Nixon administration seemed ambivalent toward the election. Sparkman was chairman of the Banking and Currency Committee and a consistent supporter of the Nixon administration, while the second ranking Democrat on the committee was William Proxmire of Wisconsin, a liberal critic of the administration. The White House alternated between supporting a former cabinet member and sending a “Dear John” letter expressing appreciation for Sparkman’s support in the Senate. Sparkman swept 62.3 percent of the vote, as compared with Blount’s 33.1 percent, with most of the remainder going to LeFlore. Sparkman won everywhere, carrying blacks and whites, rural dwellers and urbanites.\n\nIf the Nixon administration hedged its bets in Alabama, it was downright antagonistic toward the Republican senatorial candidate in Mississippi. The Republicans in Mississippi had not shown any noticeable enthusiasm for putting up a candidate to oppose Senator Eastland until James Meredith, who had desegregated the University of Mississippi ten years before, filed in the Republican primary. Apparently at the urging of Republican friends, automobile dealer Gil Carmichael then entered the primary as the white hope to turn back Meredith.19 Carmichael easily won the nomination and went on to conduct a game campaign against the veteran Eastland. But Eastland, who was chairman of the Senate judiciary committee, was an acknowledged friend of the Nixon administration. When Vice-President Agnew visited Mississippi during the campaign, he would not permit Carmichael on the speaker’s platform or mention his name. Although the election was never in doubt, Carmichael made a relatively impressive showing, winning just over 39 percent of the vote, the best showing by a Mississippi Republican in the twentieth century and one no doubt related to the fact that Nixon won almost four out of every five votes cast in the state, which, as in the 1964 presidential election, again made Mississippi the most Republican state in the union."
