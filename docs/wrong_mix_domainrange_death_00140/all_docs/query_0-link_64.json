Born seven miles from Bath, Somerset, England, 11 January 1859 (now 77 years old), of 1600 Robson Street, widower, where he lives with his deceased wife’s sister, who is aged 70. Mr. Langley is the youngest child of the large family of George and Martha Langley, who came to Canada in June 1873 on the S.S. Aragon from Bristol to New York and then to Essex County, Ontario. He was the youngest of a family of ten, and some of his elder brothers had preceded them to Kingsville, Ontario. The family went farming; Mr. Langley did not go to school in Canada after his arrival at the age of 14.\n\n. . .\n\nMr. Langley said: “After our arrival in Canada, I started working for a butcher, afterwards my wife’s father—Miss Leona Broadwell; we were married in Essex County, and the next day, 6th February 1882, we left, together with my wife’s family—Broadwell—to come to British Columbia. The Broadwells settled, they did not pre-empt, but bought, on Salt Spring Island in 1882. Both are deceased now. My wife and I came to Gastown on 1st September 1882, to work in George Black’s butcher shop which was over the water next door to the Sunnyside Hotel. He had an ordinary row boat fitted up, not with a butcher block, as some say, but with a meat cutting board; most of the meat had been cut up in the shop over the water on what is now Water Street. We took the meat to the Moodyville Mill and the ships twice a week.”\n\n“England and Wales Birth Registration Index, 1837-2008,” database, FamilySearch (https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:26RY-JKF : 1 October 2014), Arthur Langley, 1859; from “England & Wales Births, 1837-2006,” database, findmypast (http://www.findmypast.com : 2012); citing Birth Registration, Clutton, Somerset, England, citing General Register Office, Southport, England.
