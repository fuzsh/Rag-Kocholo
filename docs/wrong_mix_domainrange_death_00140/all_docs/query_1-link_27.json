Johnson, from 1965 to 1969.\n\nHubert H. Humphrey was born on 27 May 1911, in Wallace, South Dakota, and went on to become mayor of Minneapolis. He was elected a seat in the United States Senate in 1948, becoming assistant majority leader and helping to push the Civil Rights Act. He went on to serve as Vice President under Lyndon B. Johnson, later running unsuccessfully for the presidency against Richard Nixon in 1968. Humphrey returned to the Senate thereafter. He died on 13 January 1978, in Waverly, Minnesota.[2]\n\n\"Compassion is not weakness, and concern for the unfortunate is not socialism.\" - Hubert Humphrey\n\nBiography\n\nBorn in Wallace, South Dakota, in 1911, Hubert Humphrey Jr. left his home state to attend college at the University of Minnesota. Early in the Great Depression, he returned to help manage the family drug store, later earning his pharmacist’s license. Humphrey completed his bachelor’s degree at Minnesota in 1939, followed by a master’s degree in Political Science at the University of Louisiana. Back in Minnesota, he was hired to teach political science as part of the Works Progress Administration (WPA).\n\nBirth\n\nHe was the son of Ragnild Kristine Sannes (1883–1973), a Norwegian immigrant, and Hubert Humphrey, Sr. (1882–1949).\n\nBaptism\n\nName: Hubert Horatio Humphrey, in the U.S., Evangelical Lutheran Church of America, Records, 1875-1940[3]\n\nEvent Type: Baptism\n\nBirth Date: 27 May 1911[3]\n\nBaptism Date: 27 Aug 1911[3]\n\nBaptism Place: Clark, South Dakota[3]\n\nFather: Hubert Humphrey[3]\n\nMother: Christine Humphrey[3]\n\nChurch Name: Highland Lutheran\n\nChurch Location: Lily, South Dakota\n\nEducation\n\n1931: Pharmacist's License, Capitol College of Pharmacy, Denver, Colorado\n\n1940: Masters, Louisiana State University\n\nPolitical Career\n\n1948: United States Senate\n\n1949 to 1964: 3 Terms in the Senate\n\n1961 to 1964: Democratic Majority Whip\n\n1965 to 1969: United States Vice President\n\nMarriage\n\nSpouse: Muriel Humphrey Brown (m. 1936–1978)\n\nChildren:\n\nHubert Horatio \"Skip\" Humphrey,\n\nRobert Humphrey,\n\nNancy Faye Humphrey,\n\nDouglas Humphrey\n\nIn 1934 Hubert began dating Muriel Buck, a bookkeeper and graduate of local Huron College.[4] They were married in 1936 and remained married until Humphrey's death nearly 42 years later.[5] They had four children: Hubert Humphrey III, Nancy, Robert, and Douglas.[6]\n\nUnlike many prominent politicians Humphrey never became wealthy, and through most of his years as a United States Senator and Vice President, he lived in a modest middle-class housing development in Chevy Chase, Maryland. In 1958, Hubert and Muriel used their savings and his speaking fees to build a lakefront home in Waverly, Minnesota, about 40 miles west of Minneapolis.[7]\n\nHonors & Awards\n\nPresidential Medal of Freedom\n\n1965: Honorary Life Member of Alpha Phi Alpha, a historically African American fraternity.[8]\n\n1978: U.S. Senator John Heinz Award for Greatest Public Service by an Elected or Appointed Official, an award given out annually by Jefferson Awards.\n\n14 - 15 January 1978: Hubert H.
