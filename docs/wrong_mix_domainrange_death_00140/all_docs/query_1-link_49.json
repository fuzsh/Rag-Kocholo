        "text": "Transcript\n\nEdited by Kent B. Germany, Nicole Hemmer, and Ken Hughes, with Kieran K. Matthews and Marc J. Selverstone\n\nVice President Hubert H. Humphrey Jr. was literally the last man to warn the President that, if elected, he was going to give a speech promising to halt the bombing of North Vietnam. President Johnson had learned of the imminent national broadcast of Humphrey’s speech from the news wires. Humphrey’s Republican opponent, Richard M. “Dick” Nixon, talked to the President about it 45 minutes before Johnson’s own Vice President called. Earlier that year, Humphrey had told a campaign aide that Johnson had threatened to publicly repudiate him if he came out for a bombing halt. “In fact, he told me that it would endanger American troops like his son-in-law and cost lives. I would have their blood on my hands,” Humphrey said. “He would denounce me publicly for playing politics with peace.”\n\nMost of what Humphrey wrote in his memoir, The Education of a Public Man, about the following telephone call is contradicted by the tape of it: “About fifteen minutes before I began my speech, I called President Johnson from the studio. I told him what I intended to say and he said curtly, ‘I gather you’re not asking my advice.’ I said that was true, but that I felt that there was nothing embarrassing to him in the speech and certainly nothing that would jeopardize peace negotiations. I said we had been in direct contact with Averell Harriman and that George Ball was there with me. Johnson said tartly and finally, ‘Well, you’re going to give the speech anyway. Thanks for calling, Hubert.’ And that was that.’”\n\nThe Presidential Daily Diary indicates that the Vice President did not speak with Johnson until 7:30 p.m., when the broadcast of his prerecorded speech had already begun. Humphrey did not inform Johnson that he had been in direct contact with Harriman, the President’s chief negotiator in the Paris talks with the North Vietnamese. Johnson was furious a few days later when word of Harriman’s role in the speech leaked, and the ambassador authorized a public statement saying Humphrey’s position would not undermine the bombing halt negotiations. Neither of the quotes that Humphrey attributed to Johnson can be found on the tape."
