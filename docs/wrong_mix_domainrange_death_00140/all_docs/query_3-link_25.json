        "text": "Did you know that in 1975, Senator Hubert H. Humphrey was our commencement speaker? Check out the audio recording below, or read the transcript!\n\nLink to Audio\n\nHubert H. Humphrey Commencement Speech, 1975\n\nMinnesota Braille and Sight Saving School\n\nLouis Kramer:\n\nA loyal supporter in the area of special education. An active person in all governmental functions. Representing Senatorial District #24 I give you the Honorable Clarence Purfeerst.\n\nSenator Purfeest:\n\nThank you very much, Louis. When you started talking there, I thought you were talking to Senator Humphrey, but it does give me a great deal of privilege today to introduce a man who I think is probably the Dean of Minnesota public officials, a man who for more than a quarter of a century has devoted his life to public service and hope the good Lord is with him so he can devote to public service, another quarter of the year/quarter of century. I think you've all seen, and you've all heard and and certainly you realized, that the Senator Humphrey has been a mayor and mayor of Minneapolis. You realize that he served in the U.S. Senate for several years and also served as Vice President of the United States. However, I don't know how many of you are aware of the fact that Senator Humphrey actually was a teacher at one time. He taught at the University of Minnesota. He also taught at Hamlin. Following his defeat as president of the United States, he again taught at the University of Minnesota. I think that it's quite fitting that Senator Humphrey should speak at this school today, for he knows education, inside and out. Senator Humphrey has spoken up many times before Congress and various groups on educational principles, his thoughts, and his opinions on the betterment of education. Not for those who are fortunate in life, but also some of those who perhaps are unfortunate. In 1968, as a presidential candidate, Senator Humphrey ran on the platform that called for increased support for education and also for free lunches for needy children.\n\nYes, Senator Humphrey, I think knows education and I'm real proud to have been associated with Senator Humphrey for some period of time. I guess but most of all, I'm impressed by his vision and his effort to educate his fellow public officials. For it is Hubert Humphrey who educated the Senate as to the need of disarmament. If you follow it closely, is still talking of a cutback in military supplies. He was a leader in advocate of civil rights and expanded domestic programs. It was Hubert Humphrey who taught us then and is still teaching those around him not to look back but to look forward. And today I'm further impressed by Hubert Humphrey's attitude in his continuing service to education and also to public service. He does not see his work as a drudgery, but rather views each day as a new challenge and as a new adventure in life. Hubert Humphrey has sponsored programs which stressed not to limitation placed on individuals by handicaps, may they be social, economic or physical. But rather with programs as stressed the abilities and the talents and the potentials of all people. Hubert Humphrey, in short, like many of the school sees much more with his heart than with his eyes and it is with his heart that he sees the important things, the things that continually spur him on to action. And with that work Hubert Humphrey is referred to as a man, who does doesn't just look at people, but who sees them. And with that most accurate observation, I am pleased to present to you U.S. Senator Hubert H. Humphrey. (audience applause)\n\nU.S. Senator Humphrey:\n\nThank you. (audience clapping)\n\nThank you very much, thank you.\n\nMy very good friend, Senator Clarence Purfeerst. And Representative Orv Birnstihl. And to our distinguished Superintendents Svaldi and the administrative assistant who has been in charge of this program today, Mr. Kramer and others and members of the state administration that are here with us, these wonderful students and graduates here today and the parents and their friends. And to the chorus that's over here too that we want to pay our respects to. I know they're going to sing for us today and we're looking forward to all of this wonderful program.\n\nLet me say first of all, to Mary Beth...that when we were out here in the hallway, she was saying to me “I'm scared to death.” And I said, “Why? Why, what are you scared of?” She says “I’m just nervous; I'm scared.” I said, “Well, think of me; I gotta make the speech!” (audience laughter) I said, “Maybe you better go in and make that speech for me!” and she says “I don't know what you're going to say.” And I said “Neither do I!” So….but didn't she do a good job? Let's give her a good hand. She was so nice. (audience applause)\n\nAnd we're going, and we're going to have others that we'll do an equally good job. And I want us to to reward them with our applause and our affection. Now, John Boone, John's over there on the end, he came on, no for me, said, “What's your favorite sport?” And I said to him, well it's football, it's baseball, and he said that was the sort of far out. And he said…he told me he liked swimming and I had to tell him that I swam like a rock. I didn't swim too good. And he's won some prizes as you know. And I just had a good visit out here with our friends. I'm sorry that I didn't have a chance to talk to each and every one of them because I would have learned so much. Well, let me say to these six graduates - and we have John and Julie and Mary Beth and we have Bonnie and Rodney and Gerald. Let me just say to them that today is the big day. Today is the first day of the rest of your life. You're really starting all over again. Now you're getting a diploma. We're sending you off to new adventures and you're going to have a mighty interesting life ahead of you. You've worked hard to achieve what you have thus far. But there are new days and new experiences for all of you, and I'm sure you're going to make the best of them.\n\nThe one thing I noticed in my brief visit with these young people is that they're so full of pep! They have such optimism. They are so willing to get out and to do their very best. I asked one of the young people (I forgotten which one it was now)...I said, what are you going to do when you leave here? And he said “Get a job.” And I asked Bonnie, I said, “How are you today?” and she says “I'm happy my sister's here.” So you see, there's a real wonderful spirit here. And that's what's needed in this country. I said to another group this morning that what America was all about was a sense of pioneering, adventure! Willing to take a chance. And secondly, optimism and faith. That you can do what needs to be done. And thirdly, accommodation. The willingness to respect another person. And to understand their problems and to appreciate their talents.\n\nAnd here we see an opportunity today before us to put all of these wonderful American characteristics to work. Because these young graduates, they they…they've got a pioneering spirit. And this school, the Minnesota School for Braille, has a pioneering spirit. It is the cutting edge of a whole new wave of education for those that are visually impaired and we can be mighty proud of the work that State Senator Clarence Purfeerst and others have done to make this school and its program possible. This is an educational institution. And we ought to keep that in mind. This is a very special educational institution. And those who are here should be looked upon as students. Students learning. Preparing themselves for life. Preparing themselves for an occupation. Preparing themselves to make the most out of their talents and of their life. This day represents a great milestone in the lives of these six graduates.\n\nYou know, I get a special kick out of this day. When I graduated from high school, there were just 13 of us. I thought that was greatest day in my life. I remember it vividly. And here I am making a commencement speech and there are six graduates here. But let me tell you, if there were six thousand, it wouldn't be any better and I don't think it would be as good. Because these six represent tremendous dedication and tremendous effort on their part – plus, the cooperation of an excellent faculty and of a citizenry. The state of Minnesota and the people of this state want to see that our young people have a chance. The promise of America. You know what it is? Everyone to have a chance. The promise of America: Everyone to have an equal opportunity. The promise of America: To make life and liberty and the pursuit of happiness a reality. And that's what education means, and that's what an occasion like this means. And when we see these six graduates who will get their diploma today, it really represents the fulfillment of the promise of this country for at least these six. And I hope it will represent the fulfillment in years to come for thousands of people who may have some handicap or whatever you wish to call it; some impairment, physical or mental. Every one of God's children is entitled to develop the best that's in them to the utmost. That's the way you have to look at it. Each and everyone of us have our weaknesses each and everyone of us have our strengths. And we have to learn how to deal with our weaknesses and to develop our strengths. Some of the great people of the world have been people have been physically impaired. People that are deaf. People that are blind. Great musicians. Great artists. Great scientists have not all been, you know, the Mr. All America, the 100% physically perfect. What's most important is the heart and the spirit and the attitude. And I sense in these young people just in my very few brief moments with them a kind of spirit that just made me tingle all over, and I said how lucky I am to be able to be here to share in this afternoon. I've given so many commencement addresses over my lifetime that I'm ashamed to tell you. And I can tell you that sometimes they've been a very serious problem for me. A kind of an ordeal. But today I just feel like this is a moment of joy of exhilaration. To share in an occasion like this.\n\nNow, dear friends, much progress is being made, of course, as you know, in opening up opportunities for handicapped people, or particularly those that are visually impaired. There's opportunities that are in education. We know that. Tremendous amount of opportunities in that field. Opportunities in the law, opportunities are opening up for young people such as we have here today and the computer technology. The federal government is seeing to it that there are more opportunities under civil service in the Internal Revenue Service, for example tax information service consultants are people who are afflicted with blindness or visual impairment. And the same thing is true in the Social Security Administration, but all the way through the government, because some of us care. And when we talk about equal opportunity, we mean equal opportunity for everybody. Everybody. And I have found that some people who have visual impairment see more. That is, they see more clearly the personality, the character of someone else, or the possibilities, than some of us who think we have 20/20 vision and see all too little.\n\nSo these young friends I have here with me. I want them to know that there will be more opportunities opening up. You're living at the right time. People now are taking a different point of view about human resources. We need everybody in this country. We can't afford to go around and just put some people off and say, well, we are, you know we don't need you. This country is in trouble, as other countries are. And we are going to need the talents and the abilities of every single man, woman and child. And we're going to have to help develop those talents. And, dear friends, when we put money into education, special education, education for the handicapped, the mentally retarded, the deaf, the children and the adults, the blind or visual impairment...this is not an expenditure. This is an investment. A real investment and it will yield tremendous dividends. Tremendous dividends and personal happiness and health. Tremendous dividends and production of goods and services, and of opportunities that everyone should have.\n\nYou know, there are over 2 million people in America that are blind or have severe visual impairments. Now that's a lot of people. And it's interesting to note (and I just jotted down from research some figures here) that 65% of those two million are over 65 years of age. 25% are between 40 and 65, and only 4% are young people below the age of 25. What I'm telling you is through modern medicine, through diet, through specialized training, through special care, we're breaking down some of these what we thought were almost insoluble problems of handicaps. We're overcoming them and there will be fewer and fewer as days go on. Now the challenge which these young people face today is to become active, independent, contributing members of our society, and that's going to depend in a large measure upon how we receive each other. That's the way I started out this speech. Our country, I said, had a sense of pioneering it, had a sense of optimism and a sense of accommodation, respect for one another, and if we all just note that everybody has something to offer. You know Mrs. Humphrey and I have a mentally retarded granddaughter. We've made no secret of it at all. That child has brought more love into our home, then all the other children put together. So there is a reward that goes far beyond anything that you can measure. And I'm here to tell you that in this graduating class of six will come tremendous talent to be developed and is being developed. And who knows but what one of these six may very well bring some breakthrough in technology or in some kind of work that will give great benefits to thousands and thousands of people in the years to come.\n\nSo I want to salute each and every one of these wonderful young people. They make my eyes water with sentiment as I think of their chances and as I think of what they've had to go through. But I want them to know. I want them to know that this country that they are a part of they’re citizens of the United States of America. It’s a country that has dedicated and must continue to dedicate itself to the enrichment of life. Those words that I mentioned earlier: life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. Those are the words of the Declaration of Independence. Those are God's gifts to us. Those are not something that come to us because a political party said we're going to give it to you, or because a corporation said we're going to give it to you, or a labor union. No indeed, the gift that precious God, given natural right, that gift of life and of liberty and the pursuit of happiness belongs to us because we are created in the image of our maker. And if we'll just keep that in mind, that's what governments are supposed to be doing is to protect those rights of life. That's why it's proper for the government and the people of Minnesota to see to it that young people who may have some particular disability get the same break, the same opportunity as someone who is rich and physically and mentally well. That's why we have special education for many of our children today. And we've got to make sure that liberty means something else besides just a word. It means options the right to make some choices. And these young people that are graduating here today, they have going to have the right to make some choices. They're going to look for jobs. They're going to be trained. They're going to different parts of the state. Which one was going to go to Arkansas? Raise your hand here. Well, now this young lady is going down to Arkansas, so you see she's going out and there's another that's going on to over to a college in Wisconsin and so on. I think it's just marvelous that they have mapped out their future. Listen, I found out more about their plans for the future than ever found out about my own kids. (audience laughter)\n\nI hope you won't tell Mrs. Humphrey that, but that's absolutely true. I found that they had plans for the future, and by the way, I found that this school has been such a part of the total community. This chorus has been singing for nursing homes and other groups around the community. I know that scouting and camping has been a part of the work of this school. In other words, a normal full life.\n\nSo dear friends, all six of you over there. I want to tell you something, don't you run and try to take my job.\n\n(audience laughter)\n\nThat's the only thing that's the only thing I'm going to stop you from doing. But when I'm all through with it, why one of you over there…I don't know whether it will be Gerry or whether it'll be Mary Beth or Bonnie...now the women do everything too, fellas, so you can't...you can't be sure one of them will maybe be in politics. How do we know? I hope so. I tell you I really do because we need people in public life who can speak up. For the least of these, who can speak up for people that need a spokesman? That need a spokesman, you know? Franklin Roosevelt once said that “It is not the duty of government to see that those who already have too much have more. But rather to see that those who have too little shall have enough.” Another way to put it is, one of the duties of government is to try to give some balance. And one of the real opportunities in government is to open the door and let the light in; let people develop. Let them add their little something to what's going on, to have a piece of the action as we say it. So dear young friends, get ready to go. America needs you and new opportunities are opening up for you and others, and those opportunities are going to be there, make no mistake about it. They're going to be there in education. They're going to be there in the professions and law, for example, and many other professions and business and government and social service and community development. This is a moment of rejoicing. Not a moment of pity. But a moment of rejoicing. A moment of affirmative positive attitude, and I salute the graduates and I want them to know, and I want Superintendent Svaldi to know that I've never had more fun giving a commencement speech in my life than I've had here today. God bless you.\n\n(audience applause)\n\nLouis Kramer:\n\nOn behalf of the Minnesota Braille Sight Saving School, the staff, the students, the Department of Public Welfare, and most of all these six graduates. I'd like to thank you, Senator Humphrey, for your very kind words today. Thank you."
