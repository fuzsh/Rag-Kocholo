        "text": "(1911–78). The 38th vice-president of the United States was Hubert H. Humphrey, who served from 1965 to 1969 in the Democratic administration of Lyndon B. Johnson. Humphrey sought the nation’s highest office in 1968 but narrowly lost to Republican Richard M. Nixon. As a liberal leader in the United States Senate (1949–65; 1971–78), Humphrey built his political base on a coalition of the Democratic and Farmer-Labor parties—reminiscent of the Populist Movement.\n\nHubert Horatio Humphrey, Jr., was born on May 27, 1911, in Wallace, S.D. His father was a pharmacist, and Humphrey left his studies at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis in the early 1930s to help out at the family drug store—completing a six-month intensive training program at Capitol College of Pharmacy in Denver, Colo., in 1933 to become certified. Humphrey married Muriel Buck in 1936, and the couple eventually had four children. He returned to the University of Minnesota in 1937 and earned a bachelor’s degree with high honors in 1939. Louisiana State University awarded him a fellowship; he received a master’s degree in political science in 1940 and was encouraged by his professors to enter politics.\n\nHumphrey’s jobs after returning to Minnesota in the early 1940s included teaching political science, working as a radio commentator, and serving as director of a worker-education program for the Works Progress Administration (which helped his future political career by bringing him to the attention of trade-union officials). Although he lost the mayoral race in Minneapolis in 1943, he won two years later. In 1944 he became his state’s presidential campaign manager for Franklin D. Roosevelt. During this period he was instrumental in merging Minnesota’s Democratic and Farmer-Labor parties.\n\nAt the Democratic National Convention in 1948, Humphrey led an effort to include a strong civil rights plank in the party’s presidential platform. In the same year he was elected to the United States Senate, where he served for the next 16 years; in 1961 he became assistant majority leader. As a senator he developed a reputation as an effective debater, a prolific initiator of legislation, and a skilled parliamentary leader. In an effort to end the notion of Democrats being “soft on Communism” in the 1950s, Humphrey went against his usual pro-civil rights stance and introduced a bill to ban the Communist party, which was modified slightly to become the Communist Control Act of 1954. That same year, he helped put through an act that allowed needy countries to buy United States government-owned surplus crops. He won particular acclaim for achieving bipartisan support for the Limited Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty (1963) and the Civil Rights Act (1964).\n\nWhen he became vice-president under Johnson, Humphrey’s earlier reputation as a glib and sometimes abrasive “do-gooder” was supplanted by a more conservative image, especially after he defended U.S. participation in the Vietnam War, and he often was vilified by left-wing opponents of the Johnson administration. As vice-president he served as chairman of the National Advisory Council of the Peace Corps, coordinator of the antipoverty program, and chairman of the Civil Rights Council; he also worked with Congress to pass the Voting Rights Act and Medicare.\n\nFollowing Johnson’s withdrawal from the 1968 presidential election, Humphrey sought the Democratic nomination. He decided not to contest candidates Eugene McCarthy and Robert F. Kennedy (who was assassinated in June 1968 following the California primary) in states with primaries but instead go after delegates from states without primaries. Although the party was deeply divided, Humphrey captured the nomination at a tumultuous convention in Chicago but trailed far behind Nixon in the polls. His fortunes began to reverse at the end of September, when he announced his plans to halt the bombing campaign in North Vietnam if he were elected. Rising steadily in the polls throughout October, he eventually lost by only about 510,000 votes, one of the slimmest margins in any U.S. presidential election. Many observers concluded that he would have won the election had it been held a week later.\n\nAfter leaving office, he pursued his interest in education by teaching at Macalester College in St. Paul, Minn., and at the University of Minnesota and by serving as a consultant to Encyclopædia Britannica. He was reelected to the Senate in 1970 as a Democratic–Farmer-Labor Party candidate. He unsuccessfully sought the Democratic nomination for president in 1972 and considered a presidential bid in 1976. Afterward, he wrote his autobiography, The Education of a Public Man: My Life and Politics (1976, reissued 1991), and played an active role as elder statesman and party sage in the Senate. Observers both in and out of the Senate regarded him as one of the giants in the history of that body. Suffering from cancer, Humphrey died on Jan. 13, 1978, in Waverly, Minn. His wife completed his Senate term."
