        "text": "“I don't know what is going to happen tomorrow, but I know what I am going to do. I am going to get up early, and I am going down to that Johnson City, Texas, courthouse and I am going to put a vote in for Ralph Yarborough, and I am not going to do it just because I like him or because he is a friend. I am going to do it because I think that he has loyally and effectively worked for the Democratic program for all the people, and I want to be President of all the people.\n\n“You have a precious privilege that many people in many countries don't have. Some of them are fighting for it and many of them would die for it, and a good many have died in order that you might have it.”\n\n“This Corporation will assist stations and producers who aim for the best in broadcasting good music, in broadcasting exciting plays, and in broadcasting reports on the whole fascinating range of human activity. It will try to prove that what educates can also be exciting.\n\n“It will get part of its support from our Government. But it will be carefully guarded from Government or from party control. It will be free, and it will be independent—and it will belong to all of our people.\n\n“Television is still a young invention. But we have learned already that it has immense—even revolutionary—power to change, to change our lives.\n\n“I hope that those who lead the Corporation will direct that power toward the great and not the trivial purposes.\n\n“At its best, public television would help make our Nation a replica of the old Greek marketplace, where public affairs took place in view of all the citizens.”\n\n“I am so happy to be back where these memories are so strong.\n\n“Thirty-eight years have passed, but I still see the faces of the children who sat in my class. I still hear their eager voices speaking Spanish as I came in. I still see their excited eyes speaking friendship.\n\n“Right here I had my first lessons in poverty. I had my first lessons in the high price we pay for poverty and prejudice right here.\n\n“Thirty-eight years later our Nation is still paying that price.\n\n“Three out of every four Mexican-American children now in a Texas school will drop out before they get to the eighth grade.\n\n“One out of every three Mexican-Americans in Texas who are older than 14 have had less than 5 years of school.\n\n“How long can we pay that price?\n\n“In one school district alone, one out of every two children is of Mexican-American descent. But two out of every three graduating seniors this year will be Anglo.\n\n“How long can we pay that kind of a price?\n\n“In five of our Southwestern States, 19 percent of the total population has less than 8 years of school. Almost one-fifth of the population in five States has less than 8 years in school.\n\n“What is the percent of the Mexican-Americans with less than 8 years of school? How many Mexican-Americans have less than 8 years of school? Fifty-three percent. Over half of all the Mexican-American children have less than 8 years of school.\n\n“How long can we pay that price?\n\n“I will give you that answer this afternoon. I will give that answer to America this afternoon. I will say: We can afford to pay that price no longer. No longer can we afford second-class education for children who know that they have a right to be first-class citizens.”\n\n“Today, then, we embark on a new adventure in learning. And it has a very special meaning to me.\n\n“This is a proud moment in my life. I am proud to have a part in the beginning that this bill provides, because here a great deal began for me some 38 years ago on this campus.\n\n“It was here in these surroundings that I first understood the deeper meaning of the Bible's promise that: \"Ye shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free.\n\n“Here the seeds were planted from which grew my firm conviction that for the individual, education is the path to achievement and fulfillment; for the Nation, it is a path to a society that is not only free but civilized; and for the world, it is the path to peace—for it is education that places reason over force.”\n\nFor all the blessings that have been bestowed upon our nation during the past 12 months, it is a small thing to give thanks to Almighty God.\n\nWhen the pilgrims first observed Thanksgiving nearly 350 years ago, life was harsh and unrelenting. Cold and sickness had diminished their ranks. Their shelter was crude. Their future was uncertain. Yet when their harvest was abundant, they considered themselves blessed—and their hearts were filled with gratitude.\n\nToday we have much more than an abundant harvest. Our nation is rich and strong and united in the cause of liberty and justice. Our physical comforts are unmatched anywhere in the world. Our medicine has conquered ancient diseases.\n\nIn the past year we have added greatly to that national legacy. We have guaranteed the right to vote to all our citizens. We have pledged dignity to our elderly—even in sickness. We have added new dimensions to the education of our youth. We have broadened the horizons of opportunity for our poor. And all the while, we have enjoyed the greatest prosperity in history.\n\nBut our real blessings lie not in our bounty. They lie in those steadfast principles that the early pilgrims forged for all generations to come: the belief in the essential dignity of man; the restless search for a better world for all; and the courage—as shown by our sons in Viet-Nam today—to defend the cause of freedom wherever on earth it is threatened.\n\nThese are the eternal blessings of America. They are the blessings which make us grateful even when the future is uncertain. They are the blessings which give us the strength to complete the unfinished tasks that remain before us.\n\nFor these blessings should we thank God most of all.\n\nNow, Therefore, I, Lyndon B. Johnson, President of the United States of America, in consonance with the Joint Resolution of the Congress approved December 26, 1941, 55 Stat. 862 (5 U.S.C. 87b), designating the fourth Thursday of November in each year as Thanksgiving Day, do hereby proclaim Thursday, November 25, 1965, as a day of national Thanksgiving.\n\nOn that day, let us gather in our homes and in our places of worship to thank God for His generosity. Let us make ourselves worthy of that generosity by pledging to Him our everlasting devotion. And let us pray to Him that the forces of violence, indifference and intolerance may soon vanish from the face of the earth so that peace and understanding and love may reign supreme.\n\nIn Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.\n\nDONE at the City of Washington this tenth day of November in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and sixty-five, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and ninetieth.\n\n“On February 10, I proposed to the Congress a Food for Freedom program, by which the United States might lead the world in a war against hunger. The act which I have signed today prepares us for this historic task.\n\n“We must be certain that our Food for Freedom grants are consistent with our program to encourage the sound and rapid expansion of food production in the receiving countries. Food for Freedom grants will be made only where the country receiving the grant demonstrates its own willingness to help win its own war on hunger. We must also be certain that Food for Freedom grants are made, whenever possible, on a multilateral basis with the other countries of the world who have the resources to join us in food grant programs. We are all members of the family of man and as such we must band together if we are to be successful in the war on hunger.”\n\nWHEREAS Orville and Wilbur Wright made the first successful flights in a powered aircraft on December 17, 1903, near Kitty Hawk, North Carolina; and\n\nWHEREAS these historic flights-and those that followed-have promoted universal understanding by bringing people closer together; and\n\nWHEREAS the Wright brothers provided the initial spark that has made the United States of America the world leader in civilian and military aviation; and\n\nWHEREAS the Congress, by a joint resolution approved December 17, 1963 (77 Stat. 402), designated the seventeenth day of December of each year as Wright Brothers Day and requested the President to issue annually a proclamation inviting the people of the United States to observe that day with appropriate ceremonies and activities:\n\nNOW, THEREFORE, I, LYNDON B. JOHNSON, President of the United States of America, do hereby call upon the people of this Nation, and their local and national government officials, to observe Wright Brothers Day, December 17, 1964, with appropriate ceremonies and activities, both to recall the accomplishments of the Wright brothers and to provide a stimulus to aviation in this country and throughout the world.\n\n“In the 20 years since this Institute was founded, we have amassed more knowledge about the heart and its diseases than mankind gained in all the previous history. We have reduced the death rate from high blood pressure by nearly 50 percent in the last 10 years. We have developed new surgical techniques. We have some of the distinguished surgeons here with us this morning. I am glad to say we have developed heart lung machines; we have developed open heart surgery; and we have made many other breakthroughs.\n\n“Now, we have come a long way, but I know there is not a person in the room or at the Heart Institute or on a medical faculty anywhere who feels that we have come nearly far enough. A family of diseases that still murders more than a million citizens a year cannot be said to be ready for a knockout blow.\n\n“Stand before the American people and argue for the funds that are essential if we are going to make this 20 years better than the last.”\n\n“This act reaffirms the basic principles which have guided America’s foreign economic policy for two decades. It proclaims our readiness to help those who help themselves in mankind’s unrelenting struggle against poverty, ignorance, and disease.\n\n“Foreign assistance represents our hopes for the world our children will inherit. It gives meaning to the pledges of four Presidents and 10 Congresses that the United States will help to provide the margin of hope that nourishes the poverty-stricken millions around the world for whom change is not a matter of choice but of necessity.\n\n“I regret to say that the Foreign Assistance Act of 1967 reduces the margin of hope to the danger point.\n\n“I respect the judgment of the Congress. But I would be remiss in my duty if I failed to state my own conviction. I believe the money cuts and other restrictions in this act will seriously inhibit this Government’s effort to assure and enlarge the security of the free world. For 20 years we have recognized the link between that security and our own. We should not lose sight of it now.”\n\n“Today we grow up to our responsibilities. This new Air Quality Act lets us face up to our problem as we have never faced up before.\n\n“In the next 3 years, it will authorize more funds to combat air pollution—more funds in the next 3 years to combat air pollution—than we have spent on this subject in the entire Nation’s history of 180 years.\n\n“It will give us scientific answers to our most baffling problem: how to get the sulphur out of our fuel—and how to keep it out of our air.\n\n“It will give Secretary Gardner new power to stop pollution before it chokes our children and before it strangles our elderly—before it drives us into a hospital bed.\n\n“It will help our States fight pollution in the only practical way—by regional airshed controls—by giving the Federal Government standby power to intervene if and when States rights do not always function efficiently.\n\n“It will help our States to control the number one source of pollution—our automobiles.\n\n“But for all that it will do, the Air Quality Act will never end pollution. It is a law—and not a magic wand to wave that will cleanse our skies. It is a law whose ultimate power and final effectiveness really rests out there with the people of this land—on our seeing the damnation that awaits us if the people do not act responsibly to avoid it and to curb it.\n\n“Last January, in asking Congress to pass this legislation, I had this to say:\n\n“‘This situation does not exist because it was inevitable, nor because it cannot be controlled. Air pollution is the inevitable consequence of neglect. It can be controlled when that neglect is no longer tolerated.\n\n“‘It will be controlled when the people of America, through their elected representatives, demand the right to air that they and their children can breathe without fear.’\n\n“So, let us then strengthen that demand from this moment on. Let us seize the new powers of this new law to end a long, dark night of neglect.”\n\n“All of us have lived through 7 days that none of us will ever forget. We are not given the divine wisdom to answer why this has been, but we are given the human duty of determining what is to be, what is to be for America, for the world, for the cause we lead, for all the hopes that live in our hearts.\n\n“A great leader is dead; a great Nation must move on. Yesterday is not ours to recover, but tomorrow is ours to win or to lose. I am resolved that we shall win the tomorrows before us. So I ask you to join me in that resolve, determined that from this midnight of tragedy, we shall move toward a new American greatness.\n\n“More than any generation before us, we have cause to be thankful, so thankful, on this Thanksgiving Day. Our harvests are bountiful, our factories flourish, our homes are safe, our defenses are secure. We live in peace. The good will of the world pours out for us.”"
