Harwell\n\nThe Pulaski Citizen, Jan 21, 1904. Mrs. John M. Aymett died in Nashville, thursday, Jan. 14, just as the evening sun was sinking behind the western hills, the spirit of Mrs. John M. Aymett took its flight from Douglass' Infirmary, Nashville, where she had gone for treatment. And loved ones who watched beside her experienced that peculaiarly panful sense of loneliness and desolate separation from mother and companion which is known only to those who have been called upon to pass through a similiar ordeal. Mrs. John M. Aymett was the daughter of Rev. Logan Harwell, a Methodist preacher, and having been raised to love the church, she became a member in early girlhood and lived a consistent Christian life. In the dawn of young womanhood she was married to John M. Aymett with whom she lived happily till her untimely death. Two children were born to the, a son who died when a small boy, and a daughter, Mrs. A. Loyd. Mrs Aymett had been in feeble health for two or three years, but as she was not given to complaining, many intimate friends did not know how serious was her condition. As a last resort she submitted patiently to an operation which the doctors said offered the only hope and that was slight. She came out from the influence of ether and lived two days, retaining consciousness to the last. The body was brought back here and taken to the home of J. A. Loyd where it was viewed by a large concourse of friends and neighbors by whom Mrs. Aymett was so greatly loved. She was of a quiet retiring disposition devoting her life and energies largely to the welfare and happiness of others. And perhaps no one in the county was more generally loved. The funeral was conducted at the Methodist Church by Rev. J. W. Cherry and Rev. H. B. Reams, then the body was laid to rest in Maplewood.\n\nAYMETT, Dora Brown Harwell\n\nThe Pulaski Citizen,\n\nSeptember 1975 (researcher's copy of obituary is not dated)\n\nDORA B.H. AYMETT\n\nHasten.

Barber, in the Confederate army of 1863. Captain Barber was killed in the battle of Resaca, Georgia. Ruffin was then taken in charge of by Surgeon General Samuel H. Stout of the Confederate army and placed as servant in the Distributing Hospital at Atlanta, Georgia. When Generals Hood and Sherman fought the battle of Atlanta in 1864, Surgeon General Stout moved him from Atlanta hospital to the hospital at Lisonia, Alabama. After this fight, Surgeon General Stout took him back to or near Atlanta, Georgia in 1865. Later General Lee surrendered and as Rebel soldiers were coming in every day, General Stout was about to be discharged, so he called him from the Distributing Hospital near Atlanta to the discharging office and he took the oath at the same time of General Stout. \"Then and there\" they left the army together and General Stout took him back to his old home where he was taken from at the beginning of the war. He received an honorable discharge.\n\n* ADAMS, John, Civil War Confederate Brigadier General. The son of Irish immigrants, he entered the United States Military Academy in 1841, graduating 25th in his class. Commissioned a 2nd Lieutenant in the 1st Dragoons-United States Regular Army, he served under Captain Philip Kearny in the Mexican War. On March 16, 1848, he was brevetted for gallantry and meritorious conduct at the Battle of Santa Cruz de Rosales and in 1851 was commissioned 1st Lieutenant. Promotion to Captain followed in 1856. Except for 2 years as a recruiting officer, he completed his United States Army career on frontier duty at Fort Crook, California, where he resigned on May 31, 1861. He traveled to New York City, where he learned that General Winfield Scott had ordered the arrest of Regular Army officers suspected of resigning to join the Confederacy. Evading capture, he went to Tennessee, enlisted in the Confederate army as a Captain of Cavalry, and was placed in command at Memphis. By May 1862 he had advanced to Colonel and by December to Brigadier General, assuming command of Brigadier General Lloyd Tilghman's Mississippi infantry brigade after Tilghman's death in May 1863. He served under General Joseph E. Johnston during the campaign to relieve Vicksburg, then joined Lieutenant General Leonidas Polk in Mississippi, marching with him to Resaca, Georgia, where he was transferred to the Army of Tennessee. His brigade served in the advance during most of General John B. Hood's campaign to force Major General William T. Sherman northward after the fall of Atlanta, and he received commendation for his valiant service. He remained with Hood during the Franklin and Nashville Campaign, serving briefly under Major General Nathan Bedford Forrest. He was severely wounded in the right arm early in the Battle of Franklin, November 30, 1864, but refused to leave the field. Later that day he was killed leading his regiment in a determined but unsuccessful assault on the Union lines. He was one of six Confederate Generals killed during the battle.\n\n* BRAMLETT, Judge Lunsford Meredith Bramlett, He was born about 1780 in North Carolina. He married Sarah Slater in Williamson County Tennessee on June 29 1815. After her death he married Mary Crockett on Sept 14, 1848.\n\nSketches of the Bench and Bar of Tennessee by Joshua William Caldwell\n\nAmong the Tennesseans of former times who were once prominent, who performed valuable public service, and whose names are all but unknown to the present generation, is Lunsford M. Bramlett.\n\nHe was, like many others whose names belong to our history, a native of North Carolina. He was born in Surry County, but exactly when, it is impossible to say. Conflicting accounts of the descent of his father are given, some saying that he was of English origin, and others that he was of Huguenot or Scotch-Irish stock. It is certain that his mother was of the Virginia family of Taylors, and was remotely akin to Zachary Taylor.\n\nThe future Chancellor probably was born in the last decade of the last century. It appears that soon after his birth the family went to Wilkes County Georgia, where he was reared. In 1813 he came to Tennessee, and on march 7, 1814, was admitted to the bar at Pulaski. He was a diligent and persevering student of the law, zealous in behalf of his clients and more than ordinarily prone to enter into their feelings. That he was a successful lawyer, and was esteemed by the public and by the profession, is proved by his elevation to the bench at a time when judicial office was carefully bestowed. He became Chancellor in 1836, and served until 1844, He died in 1854. After retiring from the bench he endured the hard fortune that waits on retired Judges, and was unable to regain his practice.\n\nIn his life he was devoted to the law, and after his death the settlement of his estate seems to have occupied surviving members of the profession for some time.\n\nAs Chancellor he was distinguished not for brilliancy or readiness of decision, bur for careful and conscientious investigation, and an earnest desire to be just. At the bar he was not an eloquent speaker, but a painstaking and zealous advocate, who by fair means made the best of every case.\n\nThis is the record, not of a great man, but of an excellent and worthy one, a good lawyer, and a competent and upright Judge.\n\nThe Goodspeed History of Wilson County, Tennessee\n\nThe Chancery Court of Wilson County convened for the first time July 25, 1836, at the court house in Lebanon, the Chancery Court of the State having been created during that year, having been provided for by the Constitutional Convention of 1834. Hon. Lunsford M. Bramlett was the presiding chancellor, and John H. Dew was appointed clerk and master.\n\nBREWER, Samuel Richardson\n\nSam BrewerFuneral services for Samuel Richardson Brewer, 80, retired carpenter, who died Thursday morning, July 22, at Giles County Hospital, after a long illness, will be held at 2:30 o'clock Friday afternoon at Bennett-May Funeral Home.

Bunch, who keeps the toll gate on the Brick Church pike has been working in Ensley, Alabama, for sometime. Sunday morning about 3 o'clock, the house where he was boarding burned, and a telegram received here later in the day brought the sad news that his body had been found among the ruins. Jim and Walter Bunch, two older brothers, went on the first train, and brought the remains to Pulaski for burial. Funeral services were conducted Monday afternoon at 3 o'clock from the home of Will Bunch, another brother.\n\nOtis was 19 years and 7 months old, and had lived a quiet studious, industrious life.\n\nThe Birmingham Age Herald of Monday gives the following report of the unfortunate occurrence: In the smoking ruins of the home of J. T. Fox, at Ensley the mutilated remains of Otis Bunch, a young electrician, were found yesterday morning shortly after daylight. . . the body was lying beside a wrecked piano, where it had fallen from the room above when the floor gave way to the flames. . . The house which was destroyed was a ten room structure . . . and was occupied by Mr. Fox and family, who conducted a boarding house. Eighteen young men roomed at the house and all were asleep when the house was discovered ablaze. By leaping from upper story windows in their night clothes all of the young men escaped except young Bunch. Several of them sustained slight injuries and lost all their belongings. . When the inmates of the house had gotten together it was found that young Bunch, who is only nineteen years of age, was missing. . . suspicion was aroused as to how he came to his death. . . The Ensley police are investigating the matter . . .The theory is advanced that young Bunch was murdered and the house set on fire to hide the crime. No alarm was turned in until the structure was almost consumed. Otis Bunch came to Ensley from Pulaski, Tennessee, several months ago and secured a position in the Ensley steel mills as an electrician. He was paid a big salary in full Saturday, but none of his money had been found, though it is possible it was burned in the fire. The entire affair is enveloped in mystery and the city attorney and police are working hard to solve it. No direct charges have been made against any individual, but on account of the horrible mutilation of the boy's body the authorities deemed an investigation necessary. The remains sent to Pulaski, Tennessee.
