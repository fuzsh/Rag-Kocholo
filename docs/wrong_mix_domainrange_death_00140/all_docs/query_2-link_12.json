Enraged, 35 “Dixiecrat” Democrats walked out, but Hubert Humphrey stood his ground.\n\nHumphrey, a future senator, presidential candidate and vice president, would later become known as the “happy warrior,” a politician who could compromise and negotiate across political lines. But on key issues such as civil rights, he was resolute.\n\n“There are those who say to you, we are rushing this issue of civil rights. I say we are 172 years late,” Humphrey bellowed to the convention crowd.\n\nOn Saturday, Aug. 4, former President Bill Clinton joined Humphrey’s sons Skip, Bob and Doug in unveiling a memorial statue of Humphrey before an audience of 1,000 on the Minnesota Capitol grounds. The 7-foot tall bronze statue sits near the intersection of John Ireland and the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. boulevards.\n\n“He believed that public service was a worthy endeavor,” Clinton told the audience. “He believed that his adversaries need not be his enemies. … Hubert Humphrey believed that our founding fathers were serious when they pledged their lives … to form a more perfect union.”\n\nSpeakers at the dedication service included Gov. Mark Dayton and former Gov. Arne Carlson, former Vice President Walter Mondale, and Sens. Amy Klobuchar and Al Franken. State Sen. Dick Cohen, DFL-St. Paul, served as master of ceremonies. Josie Johnson, the first African-American to serve on the University of Minnesota’s Board of Regents, also offered remarks.\n\nMondale called Humphrey the most influential political leader in Minnesota history.\n\nHumphrey died in 1978, 14 years after engineering the victory of the landmark 1964 Civil Rights Act, which ended segregation and racial discrimination in public education and federally assisted programs. The act also chipped away at laws in the south aimed at marginalizing black voters through special voter-registration requirements, setting the stage for the Voting Rights Act and other important civil rights legislation.\n\nTo get the Civil Rights Act passed, Humphrey, who was then the Democratic minority whip in the U.S. Senate, reached out to Republican Minority Leader Everett Dirksen of Illinois and redrafted portions of the legislation to make it palatable across the aisle.\n\n“He was convinced that racial segregation and Jim Crow was a stain on our democracy,” Klobuchar said.\n\nSeveral speakers and audience members remarked that that level of bipartisanship has become fleeting in government.\n\nLast month, Rep. Allen West, R-Florida, told audiences at a political town hall that he’s heard up to 80 House Democrats are members of the Communist Party. Without singling out West by name, Clinton told the audience on Saturday: “I didn’t think there were 80 Communists left in the Western Hemisphere outside Cuba.”\n\nClinton said Humphrey would be proud of Sen. John McCain, the former Republican presidential candidate from Arizona, for defending an aide to Clinton’s wife, Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, against political attacks because of her Muslim faith. He did not identify Rep. Michele Bachmann, R-Minn., as the author of those statements.\n\nPointing to the examples of Pennsylvania and Texas, Clinton also criticized the recent wave of voter-ID laws, which are tightening voter-registration rules and requiring voters to obtain state-issued IDs to go to the polls.\n\nFranken said Humphrey would have opposed the two constitutional amendments that will go before Minnesota voters in November; one would require state IDs at the polls and the other would define marriage as being solely between a man and a woman, effectively undermining any future attempts at legislating gay-marriage rights.\n\nPlanning for the Humphrey statue moved forward in fits and starts over nearly 20 years. Lawmakers first appropriated funds for the Capitol memorial in 1993, but public and private fundraising and logistics took longer than many had planned.\n\nThe statue was sculpted by the Chicago-based husband-and-wife team of Anna Koh-Varilla and Jeffrey Varilla, whose previous works include Martin Luther King, Jr. monuments in Austin, Texas and Roanoke, Virgina, as well as a Jack Nicklaus monument in Dublin, Ohio.\n\nFrederick Melo can be reached at 651-228-2172.
