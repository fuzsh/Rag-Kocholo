Johnson from 1964-69. He later ran as the Democratic candidate for President in the 1968 election, after Johnson decided not to run again, but lost to Richard Nixon.\n\nA leading progressive in the Democratic party Humphrey was an important legislator during a turbulent period in America's history. First elected to the Senate in 1948, he was instrumental in pushing for the 1963 Limited Nuclear Test Ban Treaty with the Soviet Union. In 1964 he shepherded the Civil Rights Act into law.\n\nHumphrey's support for Johnson and for the Vietnam war was a crucial factor in his defeat when he ran for President in 1968. He then returned to the Senate, serving until his death in 1978.\n\nBorn: May 27, 1911\n\nBirthplace: Wallace, South Dakota, USA\n\nGeneration: Greatest Generation\n\nChinese Zodiac: Pig\n\nStar Sign: Gemini"
