        "text": "“For the work that lies ahead is demanding, and it involves far too many lives in urgent need of help, to be parceled out by race. Tomorrow’s problems, which will be placed squarely in your hands, will not be divided into ‘Negro problems’ and ‘White problems.’ There will be only human problems, and there will be more than enough to go around.\n\n“I said at the beginning that this day is for prayers of thanksgiving—for remembrance and wonder.\n\n“Our prayers are to the God who has strengthened the will of a grateful people. Our remembrance is of those who created and sustained this great university, and brought here thousands of young men and women from all over the world, and gave them the power to serve their fellow man.\n\n“Our wonder—our very great wonder—is for the human spirit that, having endured infinite wrongs, can yet hold to its faith in the dignity of life.\n\n“For one hundred years that spirit has prevailed here at Howard University. May it always prevail.”\n\nThe American Indian, once proud and free, is torn now between White and tribal values; between the politics and language of the White man and his own historic culture. His problems, sharpened by years of defeat and exploitation, neglect and inadequate effort, will take many years to overcome.\n\nBut recent landmark laws—the Economic Opportunity Act, the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, the Manpower Development and Training Act—have given us an opportunity to deal with the persistent problems of the American Indian. The time has come to focus our efforts on the plight of the American Indian through these and the other laws passed in the last few years.\n\n…\n\nI propose a new goal for our Indian programs: A goal that ends the old debate about ‘termination’ of Indian programs and stresses self-determination; a goal that erases old attitudes of paternalism and promotes partnership self-help.\n\nOur goal must be:\n\n—A standard of living for the Indians equal to that of the country as a whole.\n\n—Freedom of Choice: An opportunity to remain in their homelands, if they choose, without surrendering their dignity; an opportunity to move to the towns and cities of America, if they choose, equipped with the skills to live in equality and dignity.\n\n—Full participation in the life of modern America, with a full share of economic opportunity and social justice.\n\nThis is the work of the new conservation. It can be the new strength of America. I sent Congress today an action program:\n\n—An action program that will fight pollution that fouls the air we all breathe and blights our rivers and our streams.\n\n—An action program to continue the great work which now enables 120 million Americans to reach a national park or lakeshore or camping area in just an afternoon’s drive from the crowded city.\n\n—An action program to make every community a place of pride for its people.\n\nNow the question is for each of us: What kind of America do we really want to live in—and what kind of America do we want to leave to our children?\n\nSo I call upon all Americans—every mother and father, every businessman and worker, every Governor and every mayor-to join us in this urgent task of conserving America the beautiful.\n\n“Ever since the events of Sunday afternoon in Selma, Ala., the administration has been in close touch with the situation and has made every effort to prevent a repetition. I am certain Americans everywhere join in deploring the brutality with which a number of Negro citizens of Alabama were treated when they sought to dramatize their deep and sincere interest in attaining the precious right to vote.\n\nThe best legal talent in the Federal Government is engaged in preparing legislation which will secure that right for every American. I expect to complete work on my recommendations by this weekend and shall dispatch a special message to Congress as soon as the drafting of the legislation is finished.\n\nFederal officials have been sent to Selma and are supplying up-to-the-minute reports on developments there.\n\nThe Federal District Court in Alabama has before it a request to enjoin State officials from interfering with the right of Alabama citizens to walk from Selma to Montgomery in order to focus attention on their efforts to secure the right to register and vote. I have directed the Justice Department to enter the case as a ‘friend of the court’ so that it can present its recommendations and otherwise assist the court in every manner in resolving the legal issues involved in the case.\n\nWe will continue our efforts to work with the individuals involved to relieve tensions and to make it possible for every citizen to vote. I urge all who are in positions of leadership and capable of influencing the conduct of others to approach this tense situation with calmness, reasonableness, and respect for law and order.\n\n“We have much in Appalachia. The area is larger than all but one of the 48 contiguous States (a State which modesty impells me not to identify by name). Only two States of the Union have larger populations. Yet, the nearly 17 million Appalachian residents, more numerous than residents of New England or the farm States or the mountain States, lag far behind in their participation in our prosperity.\n\n…\n\n“America today has many responsibilities, more diverse, more far flung, more vital to all mankind than any other nation has ever in history willingly assumed. Wherever we have our commitments, whether to the old and the strong or to the young and the weak, we shall match our words with deeds. But we recognize realistically that our strength abroad rests upon our strength at home, and that is why we must and we do labor in unity to perform together tasks that have been too long neglected in every region east and west, north and south.”\n\nThe humanities are an effort to explore the nature of man’s culture and to deepen understanding of the sources and goals of human activity. Our recommendations recognize this effort as a central part of the American national purpose, and provide modest support to those whose work offers promise of extending the boundaries of understanding.\n\nPursuit of artistic achievement, and making the fruits of that achievement available to all its people, is also among the hallmarks of a Great Society.\n\nWe fully recognize that no government can call artistic excellence into existence. It must flow from the quality of the society and the good fortune of the Nation. Nor should any government seek to restrict the freedom of the artist to pursue his calling in his own way. Freedom is an essential condition for the artist, and in proportion as freedom is diminished so is the prospect of artistic achievement.\n\nBut government can seek to create conditions under which the arts can flourish; through recognition of achievements, through helping those who seek to enlarge creative understanding, through increasing the access of our people to the works of our artists, and through recognizing the arts as part of the pursuit of American greatness. That is the goal of this legislation.\n\nIn so doing we follow the example of many other nations where government sympathy and support have helped to shape great and influential artistic traditions.\n\nIt is fitting to plan now for the two hundredth anniversary of these events. In the rich diversity that is America, each community will celebrate in its own way and will draw its own inspiration from the Revolution. But the Federal Government must be prepared to share its knowledge and resources with states, local communities, historical societies, and others across the Nation. The Bicentennial Celebration should be a truly national effort.\n\nI propose that we establish an American Revolution Bicentennial Commission, composed of members of Congress and the Executive Branch and distinguished and outstanding Americans appointed by the President.\n\nThis Commission will:\n\n—Provide a creative and helping hand to State, local, and private groups in their commemorations;\n\n—Increase our knowledge and appreciation of the American Revolution through our schools and universities and our historians and scholars;\n\n—Plan for celebrations at the national level;\n\n—Recall to America and to the world the majestic significance of the Revolution.\n\n“Your place of honor was not earned without great sacrifice.\n\n“Seven members of this group have given their lives. Fourteen members are already listed as missing. Two have been captured. All of them have devotion and dedication to the spirit of the Third’s motto, ‘That Others May Live.’\n\n“As President of all the people of this country, I am very proud to pay tribute with this citation. It is not a banner and it is not used in a picket line, but it is recognition of the gallant men of the Third Aerospace Recovery Group.\n\n“Your courage and your self-sacrifice have provided us with a glowing example of what I believe is the best of American manhood. You are a credit to a grateful Nation.\n\n“If there is any gratitude in the Nation, if there is any recognition in the Nation, if there is any honor and pride in the Nation, it ought to go to men like you, because there is not any greater honor than is represented by that uniform and these flags.”\n\n“WHEREAS on March 16, 1926, Dr. Robert Hutchings Goddard successfully launched the world's first liquid-fuel rocket at Auburn, Massachusetts; and\n\nWHEREAS this achievement, as well as Dr. Goddard's other pioneering achievements in the theory, construction, and testing of rockets, established a foundation for the development of modern rocketry and made possible the exploration of space; and\n\nWHEREAS it is appropriate that the great scientific accomplishments of Dr. Goddard should be remembered and that they should be memorialized on the anniversary of his success; and\n\nWHEREAS the Congress, by an Act approved March 12, 1965, has designated March 16, 1965, as Goddard Day and has requested the President to issue a proclamation calling upon officials of the Government and the public to participate in ceremonies, meetings, and other activities held in observance of Goddard Day:\n\nNOW, THEREFORE, I, LYNDON B. JOHNSON, President of the United States of America, do hereby call upon officials of the Government, and the people, of the United States, to observe March 16, 1965, with ceremonies and activities designed to commemorate the achievements of Dr. Robert H. Goddard.”\n\n“Because it is right, because it is wise, and because, for the first time in our history, it is possible to conquer poverty, I submit, for the consideration of the Congress and the country, the Economic Opportunity Act of 1964.\n\n…\n\n“It will give the entire nation the opportunity for a concerted attack on poverty through the establishment, under my direction, of the Office of Economic Opportunity, a national headquarters for the war against poverty.\n\n…\n\n“If we now move forward against this enemy—if we can bring to the challenges of peace the same determination and strength which has brought us victory in war—then this day and this Congress will have won a secure and honorable place in the history of the nation and the enduring gratitude of generations of Americans yet to come.”\n\n“WHEREAS, On March 17, 1965, the United States District Court for the middle district of Alabama entered an order in the case of Williams et al., Plaintiffs, United States of America, Plaintiff-Intervenor v. Wallace et al., Defendants, Civil Action No. 2181-N approving an exercise by the Plaintiffs and the members of the class they represent of their right to march along United States Highway 80 from Selma to Montgomery, Alabama, commencing in Selma, Alabama, not earlier than Friday, March 19, 1965, and not later than Monday, March 22,1965, and terminating in Montgomery, Alabama, within five days from commencement; and WHEREAS, in relation to such judicial order and march the Governor of the State of Alabama has advised me that the state is unable and refuses to provide for the safety and welfare, among others, of the plaintiffs and the members of the class they represent; and WHEREAS, as a consequence of such inability and refusal of the State of Alabama, and by reason of recent events in and about Selma and Montgomery, Alabama, there is a substantial likelihood that domestic violence may occur in connection with such march, with the consequence of obstructing the execution and enforcement of the laws of the United States, including the aforesaid judicial order:\n\nNOW THEREFORE, I, Lyndon B. Johnson, President of the United States of America, under and by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and laws of the United States, including Chapter 15 of Title 10 of the United States Code, particularly Sections 332, 333, and 334 thereof, do command all persons engaged or who may engage in such domestic violence obstructing the execution and enforcement of the laws to cease and desist therefrom and to disperse and retire peaceably forthwith.\n\nIn the past two weeks, I have noted public statements by representatives of your government suggesting that you would be prepared to enter into direct bilateral talks with representatives of the U.S. Government, provided that we ceased ‘unconditionally’ and permanently our bombing operations against your country and all military actions against it. In the last day, serious and responsible parties have assured us indirectly that this is in fact your proposal.\n\nLet me frankly state that I see two great difficulties with this proposal. In view of your public position, such action on our part would inevitably produce worldwide speculation that discussions were under way and would impair the privacy and secrecy of those discussions. Secondly, there would inevitably be grave concern on our part whether your Government would make use of such action by us to improve its military position.\n\nWith these problems in mind, I am prepared to move even further towards an ending of hostilities than your Government has proposed in either public statements or through private diplomatic channels. I am prepared to order a cessation of bombing against your country and the stopping of further augmentation of U.S. forces in South Viet-Nam as soon as I am assured that infiltration into South Viet-Nam by land and by sea has stopped. These acts of restraint on both sides would, I believe, make it possible for us to conduct serious and private discussions leading toward an early peace.\n\nI make this proposal to you now with a specific sense of urgency arising from the imminent New Year holidays in Viet-Nam. If you are able to accept this proposal I see no reason why it could not take effect at the end of the New Year, or Tet, holidays. The proposal I have made would be greatly strengthened if your military authorities and those of the Government of South Viet-Nam could promptly negotiate an extension of the Tet truce.\n\nAs to the site of the bilateral discussions I propose, there are several possibilities. We could, for example, have our representatives meet in Moscow where contacts have already occurred. They could meet in some other country such as Burma. You may have other arrangements or sites in mind, and I would try to meet your suggestions.\n\nThe important thing is to end a conflict that has brought burdens to both our peoples, and above all to the people of South Viet-Nam. If you have any thoughts about the actions I propose, it would be most important that I receive them as soon as possible.\n\n“I look forward to getting your thoughts, Madame Prime Minister, on how peace can be obtained or made more secure—in Asia and throughout the world. I shall seek your counsel on the problems of Southeast Asia where India, under the Geneva Accords, has for so long played such a special role.\n\n“I will speak of my deep desire, which I know you share, for the continued improvement in relations between India and her great sister nation, Pakistan. The United States values deeply the friendship of both India and Pakistan. Nothing, we know, is more painful or more costly to all concerned than a falling out between one’s friends.\n\n“I shall look forward, Mrs. Gandhi, to getting a better understanding of the urgent economic and social problems with which your Government is now concerned. I will welcome that frankness and candor and detail that always mark conversations between good friends.\n\n“Economic stability and political tranquility depend on how well we accomplish commonplace tasks: the production of food, its transportation, the supply of fertilizer, family planning, electricity for farm and village, the realization of economic growth and opportunity.\n\n“We shall be concerned with these essentials. The solution of these problems lies, we know, with the Indian Government, but the United States believes in backing the efforts of those who are determined to solve their own problems. We know, Madam Prime Minister, that India under your leadership will have such determination.\n\n“We want to learn how we can best help you and how our help can be used to the very best effect. Your people and ours share the conviction that, however difficult the problems, there are none that a strong and a vigorous democracy cannot solve.\n\n“You have long been aware, Madam Prime Minister, of the fascination that Indian culture holds for Americans. This extends from the Hindu epics to the modern Indian novelists, and from the painters of the Ajanta Cave and the Ak Bar Court to your brilliant film producers of the present day. I venture to think that there is much about the United States that your students find equally interesting. Before our conversations end, I hope to be able to announce an imaginative new step to encourage and to facilitate these common interests.”\n\n…\n\n“Fifty-two months and ten days ago, in a moment of tragedy and trauma, the duties of this office fell upon me. I asked then for your help and God’s—that we might continue America on its course, binding up our wounds, healing our history, moving forward in new unity, to clear the American agenda, and to keep the American commitment for all of our people.\n\n“United, we have kept that commitment. United, we have enlarged that commitment.\n\n“Through all time to come, I think America will be a stronger nation, a more just society, and a land of greater opportunity and fulfillment because of what we have all done together in these years of unparalleled achievement.\n\n“Our reward will come in the life of freedom, peace, and hope that our children will enjoy through ages ahead.\n\n“What we won when all of our people united just must not now be lost in suspicion, distrust, selfishness, and politics among any of our people.\n\n“Believing this as I do, I have concluded that I should not permit the Presidency to become involved in the partisan divisions that are developing in this political year.\n\n“With America’s sons in the fields far away, with America’s future under challenge right here at home, with our hopes and the world’s hopes for peace in the balance every day, I do not believe that I should devote an hour or a day of my time to any personal partisan causes or to any duties other than the awesome duties of this office—the Presidency of your country.\n\n“Accordingly, I shall not seek, and I will not accept, the nomination of my party for another term as your President.\n\n“But let men everywhere know, however, that a strong, a confident, and a vigilant America stands ready tonight to seek an honorable peace—and stands ready tonight to defend an honored cause—whatever the price, whatever the burden, whatever the sacrifice that duty may require.\n\n“Thank you for listening.\n\n“Good night and God bless all of you.”"
