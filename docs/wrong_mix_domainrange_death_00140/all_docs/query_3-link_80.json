        "text": "#HumphreyAlum from Michigan State University Anna Podlesna (Slovakia, 2021-22) hosted a visit last month from Dr. Connie Sung, professor and neuroscience researcher at MSU. The purpose of the visit was to witness the impact of a collaboration begun years before during Anna’s Humphrey Fellowship. During her Humphrey Year, Anna, CSR Manager at Alma Career Slovakia, worked under the supervision of Dr. Sung, developing a model to increase employment opportunities for neurodiverse populations in Slovakia with plans to launch an international public-private partnership upon her return. With the collaboration of Dr. Sung, Anna Podlesna implemented the evidence-based Assistive Soft Skills and Employment Training (ASSET program), complemented by job coaching and a system of internships. Two years after implementing this model, the results are positive. In the pilot year 2022-23, 37 out of 98 job seekers with disabilities secured internships, and 17 have continued to work for over a year. In 2023-24, the network of participating employers increased from 12 to 19 companies, and Anna anticipates increased rates of job seekers securing internships this summer. During her visit, Dr. Connie Sung participated in a series of meetings, discussions, and facility tours. She met with Zuzana Stavrovská, the Commissioner for People with Disabilities in Slovakia, presented her current research on improving soft skills using virtual reality for people with disabilities, and held several meetings with employers, the Institute for Vocational Rehabilitation, schools, ASSET program graduates, and other stakeholders. Her visit concluded with a meeting with members of the Alma Career management team and a discussion of future collaborations beyond Slovakia. The visit highlights the ways that the Humphrey Fellowship Program builds lasting connections between U.S. and foreign leaders to advance solutions to the most pressing global challenges. #HumphreyImpact #GlobalSpartan #IIE #Inclusion\n\n#HumphreyAlum from Michigan State University Manuel Laredo Garnica (Bolivia, 2019-2020) is celebrating the tenth anniversary of MAMUT PISOS INDUSTRIALES Y DEPORTIVOS, a Certified B Corporation he founded, which transforms local waste from used rubber tires into innovative construction materials to create sustainable cities. Today, Mamut is listed as one of the 100 most reputable companies in Bolivia overall, and it makes the top five in the construction sector according to Merco’s 2023 Company Monitor on Corporate Reputation. Manuel views his and his team’s efforts with pride and satisfaction, knowing that together they have built a powerful brand committed to the planet. We are also proud to recognize Manuel for receiving the Alumni Impact Award (AIA) this past fall. Awarded annually on a competitive basis, the AIA allows Humphrey Alumni to pursue projects that use the knowledge and skills acquired during their Fellowship year to address local, national, and global issues or challenges within their home country or region and effect change across their fields of expertise and organizations. With this award, Manuel has developed and continues to implement a community education initiative titled “The Recycling Londra”. The project consists of accessible and engaging videos featuring a young girl named Maia and two endangered londras (giant otters) named Yasi and Inti who learn together about proper waste separation and recycling. Inspiration for this project came through Manuel ‘s witnessing of the culture of waste separation and environmental education during his Humphrey year and through his Professional Affiliation with MSU Center for Community & Economic Development. Through the “Recycling Londra” project, Manuel strives to create a sustainable and environmentally conscious future for Bolivia. Keep up the good work, Manuel!
