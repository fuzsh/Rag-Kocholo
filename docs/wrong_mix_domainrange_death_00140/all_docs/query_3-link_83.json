        "text": "In almost exactly a month, Dunreith, Aidan and I are going to Israel for two weeks.\n\nThanks to the daughter of dear friend Ava Kadishson Schieber, we will have a place to stay in Tel Aviv, a car to drive and a cell phone to use.\n\nOur plan is to use Tel Aviv as a base and to take a bunch of day trips to Haifa and Golan in the north, to Eilat for scuba diving in the south, and, of course, to Jerusalem.\n\nDunreith lived on a kibbutz for more than a year in the mid- to late-80s, and has returned a number of times since then, with her most recent visit being to study at Yad Vashem in 2005.\n\nI have been to Israel once, for just about a month, in the waning days of 1998 and bringing in 1999. Like Dunreith, I also was studying at Yad Vashem through its relationship with Facing History.\n\nI am very excited about the trip and will be concentrating in the next month on reading more about the country’s history, sights, politics and religion.\n\nThis part of my Israel education began yesterday with Chicago native and Nobel Prize winner Saul Bellow.\n\nBellow spent about three months in Israel in 1976; To Jerusalem and Back is his account of his time, the people he met, and the thoughts it inspired in him.\n\nRaised in an observant home, Bellow brings great familiarity with Orthodox life to his journey. This is the first book of his that I have read-my brother Mike gave me The Adventures of Augie March several years ago, but I have yet to crack it-and his combination of acute observations, scene setting, and purposeful sentences hooked me from the book’s initial vignette that takes place on the plane from the United States to Israel.\n\nIn addition to enjoying individual scenes and the senses of powerful people to which Bellow has access-the reader meets Hubert Humphrey, Yitzhak Rabin, Shimon Peres and Teddy Kollek, among others-Bellow is supremely well read. The book is filled with references to, and excerpts from, the works of other authors. The detail of Bellow’s reading is demonstrated by his quoting from Jean-Paul Sartre’s introduction to Franz Fanon’s The Wretched of the Earth, for example. This combination of elements makes for a delightful stew and an effective rendering of Israel’s rich diversity, the horrors out of which it was founded, and the precarious position in which it found itself more than three decades.\n\nFrom Jerusalem and Back is a brief book, and, when Bellows returns homes, one wishes the trip had been even longer.\n\nBelow abortion but far ahead of apple pie in its level of controversy, affirmative action has had a curious place in American public conversation since its inception more than 40 years ago.\n\nProponents see affirmative polices as necessary to redress centuries of wrongdoing by the majority group, while opponents, who arguably have presented their case more effectively, say the very concept of affirmative action contradicts fundamental pledges of equality under the law.\n\nBut supporters and detractors alike may be taking too narrow a view of the subject, if Columbia University professor Ira Katznelson is to believed.\n\nHe maintains that, rather than beginnning with President Lyndon Johnson’s famous speech at Howard University in 1965-Katnznelson includes the speech in an appendix-affirmative action actually started decades earlier.\n\nThere’s a twist, though.\n\nKatznelson argues that the primary beneficiaries of the early version of these policies were not black people, who are often held up by opponents as unworthy recipients of jobs or college admission, but white people.\n\nHe makes his case in an intriguing book, When Affirmative Action Was White: An Untold History of Racial Inequality in Twentieth-Century America.\n\nKatznelson explains that the impetus for the book came from his coming across a document written by W.E.B. DuBois in 1935, the height of New Deal legislation. Yet, far from celebrating the advances black people were experiencing as a result, DuBois struck a critical note.\n\nHis curiosity piqued, Katznelson decided to dig further.\n\nHe eventually uncovered a fascinating and little-explored history-though, to be fair, he does pay homage to previous historians’ work in the book’s introduction-in which Southern Democrats played a pivotal role, with Republican and Northern Democratic acquiescence, in stopping the unprecedented government largesse from going to black people.\n\nInstead, the policies actually ended up exacerbating the already yawning inequities between white and black people in the country.\n\nThe book opens with Johnson giving his dramatic and enormously well-received speech at Howard before pivoting back several decades to the New Deal. Katznelson stakes his claim on three major areas: the exclusion of large numbers of black workers from New Deal and Fair Deal benefits; the use of local control to thwart the benefits that were awarded; and an about face on pro-union legislation that gutted advances that had been made there.\n\nThe result: more than $100 billion in government spending was disporportionately directed to white, rather than black, people.\n\nKatznelson talks at length about the range of Southern politicians, from the outright racists like Theodore Bilbo to the so-called moderates like Richard Russell to the “liberals” like Johnson. He makes it clear that, whatever their seeming differences on race issues, they were united by their initial exclusion of domestic and agricultural workers from New Deal legislation-this was a major omission since millions of black people worked in these occupations-and later by their support of anti-union legislation that thwarted AFL and CIO initially successful efforts to make inroads in the black South.\n\nKatnzelson also has a highly interesting chapter about military desegregation-he shares the difficulties venerated historian John Hope Franklin had when trying to enlist to illustrate the situation for black people-and how, once admitted, black soldiers also were denied their fair share of access to benefits under the landmark GI Bill. Among other items, the bill paved the way for veterans to attend college and purchase homes, both significant aspects of entry to middle-class life. While Katznelson makes it clear that the bill did in fact benefit many black soldiers, he also shows how large amounts of discrimination occurred in the administration of the legislation.\n\nLocal control was a key factor in the perpetuation of affirmative action for white people. He shows how, even when supported at the federal level, black people often confronted local officials who were hostile to the prospects of their receiving the benefits to which the law entitled them.\n\nKatznelson also makes it clear that the national Southern politicians and local officialis acted with the knowledge and tacit support of other legislators. He includes a telling section in which Minnesota Senator Hubert Humphrey, who was known for his liberal views on race, did not push his colleagues to make further progress on the issue. He does the same with President Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s not forcefully advancing anti-lynching legislation, and strikes an effective balance between showing how politicians thought at the time without excusing the moral consequences of their action.\n\nWhen Affirmative Action Was White’s final chapter proposes some current approaches to the policy to invigorate and ultimately eliminate the need for its necessity within a generation. Here Katznelson relies on the doctrine of specific remedies advanced by Supreme Court Justice Lewis Powell in the 1978 Bakke case. Although this is by far the book’s least effective section, it does not detract from the work’s overall quality.\n\nWhen Affirmative Action Was White is a well-researched revision that provides much-needed context to a complex issue that all too often is reduced to pitting people against each other.\n\nThe modern civil rights era produced many iconic images.\n\nRosa Parks sitting alone and steadfast in a Montgomery bus. John Lewis and other students bloodied but unbowed during the 1961 Freedom Rides in Alabama. Bull Connor’s minions turning on the fire hoses and releasing the dogs against protesters in Birmingham in 1963.\n\nAnd, of course, Martin Luther King, Jr. departing from the script at the Lincoln Memorial and proclaiming his dream of racial equality at the March on Washington in August, 1963.\n\nEach of those pictures, and the people in them, have endured in our collective memory. The courage, determination and tenacity of people like Parks, Lewis and King have been widely acknowledged by the larger society.\n\nOther equally brave people have been less remembered, through.\n\nMovement strategist, dedicated social justice proponent and March on Washington architect Bayard Rustin is one of them.\n\nDuring the past few years, though, Rustin and his accomplishments have been pulled out of obscurity, where they languished in part due to people’s discomfort with his homosexuality.\n\nTomorrow, Eye of the Storm, a play about Rustin’s life, will debut at the William Hatch Auditorium, 1000 North Ridgeland Avenue, in Oak Park, Illinois.\n\nPerformed by members of the Open Door Repertory Company, the play will be attended by luminaries like U.S. Rep. Danny K. Davis, the Honorable David Pope, President of the Village of Oak Park, State Senator Don Harmon, and both State Representatives Karen Yarbrough and Deborah Graham.\n\nPeople interested in purchasing tickets or who want more information can call 708-802-1723 or visit www.opendoorrep.org.\n\nFor those who are unable to attend the play or who simply want more information about Rustin’s complex and contributory life, there is University of Illinois-Chicago Professor John D’Emilio’s award-winning biography, Lost Prophet: The Life and Times of Bayard Rustin.\n\nRustin lived a rich, long and fascinating life, and D’Emilio, who co-authored with Estelle Freedman the pioneering Intimate Matters: A History of Sexuality in America, is more than up to the task of rendering it in vivid detail and a coherent framework.\n\nThe Rustin that emerges on the pages of Lost Prophet is a gifted, charismatic man with a lifelong and passionate commitment to social justice and a near unparalleled strategic vision. Yet, because of societal prejudices against gay and lesbian people, Rustin endured repeated periods of being outcast from, and betrayed by, members of the movement.\n\nHis protests against injustice began early.\n\nD’Emilio draws on interviews with aging residents of Rustin’s home town in West Chester, Pennsylvania, who recalled his refusing to leave a restaurant where he could not get service until he eventually was ejected.\n\nAs a young man, Rustin joined the Fellowship of Reconciliation, where he was powerfully influenced by pacificst A.J. Muste. Rustin showed himself willing to sacrifice for his ideals by serving 28 months in prison, starting in 1944, for refusing to register for, and serve in, the United States Army.\n\nThis experience, and his subsequent travel to India, where he was formally trained in the Gandhian discipline of nonviolence in many ways formed the crucible on which his unyielding commitment to social change was forged.\n\nRustin first intersected with King during the Montgomery Bus Boycott, where King initially was a compromise choice as leader because he was new in town and thus had no prior negative history with different factions within the black community. The two formed a close bond, in which Rustin served largely as mentor and tactician.\n\nIt was a fruitful partnership.\n\nAlthough Rustin worked tirelessly for the causes he believed in so fiercely, he preferred to stay in the background and out of the public limelight. King emerged as the face of the burgeoning movement, helping to found the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, and taking the effort to dismantle legal segregation throughout the South.\n\nThere was a catch, though.\n\nEven during his days in prison as a member of the Fellowship of Reconciliation, Rustin experienced difficulty due to his being gay in a society that arguably opposed homosexuality even more vehemently than it suppressed the rights of African Americans.\n\nHis 1953 arrest in Pasadena, California for “lewd”conduct-Rustin was performing oral sex on a man in a parked car-was just one of the times his sexual orientation became the source of public sanction and later ostracism from within and without the movement.\n\nRustin endured many painful periods in his life in which people dear to him, from Muste to King, either urged him to “discipline” himself by essentially repressing his sexuality or cut ties with the man who had been responsible for much of the organization’s success.\n\nIt is important to note that some of the attacks came from within the community. Harlem congressman Adam Clayton Powell, for example, called Rustin out, precipitating King’s shunning Rustin during a very dark period for Rustin in the late 50s.\n\nD’Emilio effectively shows the sense of betrayal Rustin experienced on a personal level while also analyzing the anti-gay pressures and structures that existed in the society at the time.\n\nAt moments, the movement held firm.\n\nBefore the March on Washington, South Carolina Senator and former Dixiecrat Strom Thurmond started raising the issue of Rustin’s homosexuality as a way to distract from and discredit the impending march.\n\nWhere previously other leaders had forced Rustin into exile from the action he cherished and believed in so deeply, this time they confronted Thurmond and defended the march’s planner. A. Philip Randolph emerges during this part of the book as a particularly staunch supporter of Rustin.\n\nLike many advocates for nonviolence, Rustin found himself at increasing odds with members of the Black Power movement as the 60s progressed. D’Emilio also explores Rustin’s surprising reluctance to forthrightly denounce the War in Vietnam, showing how his support of Democratic Party nominee Hubert Humphrey during the 1968 presidential election left him estranged from black militant and white antiwar protestors.\n\nDuring that time, Rustin was called a strategist without a movement-a label, which, if accurate, was not permanent.\n\nDuring the last two decades of his life, Rustin turned his focus to global issues, working for the rights of Southeast Asian refugees and supporting the efforts of Lech Walesa and others in the Solidarity movement.\n\nHe also spoke out about gay rights.\n\nWalter Naegle, Rustin’s partner and a source of great joy during the last 10 years of his life, encouraged him in that cause.\n\nIn 1987, after a lifetime of working for social change, Rustin died.\n\nHopefully, D’Emilio’s textured portrait, the play and other efforts to preserve Rustin’s legacy will lead to this dynamic and valiant warrior for social justice being remembered by a grateful society for the vital contributions he made."
