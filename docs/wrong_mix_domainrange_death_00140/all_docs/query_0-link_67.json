I am trying to find out about any information that I can, about my great grand parents. I don't have a lot to go on, but hope that somebody can help. My parents and sibling have all died, and I have no knowledge as to my past. I will give you all of the information that I have. Some of the data may be on or about quality. Great Grandparents: Husband: John NELSON; Wife: Emma NELSON; Daughter: Elma. They all lived in Blackberry in 1920, along with some other siblings. They came into the United States from Sweden in either 1881 or 1882, with the daughter Elma, and I believe that they were made citizens in 1887 or 1889. What I would like to know is if I can get a copy of the Declaration of Intent: that they had signed to become citizens, so that I may find out when and where they came into the United States, and from where, in Sweden, they are from, and when they died. This would be of great value to me, and hope that somebody can help. Please reply and I remain humbly, Charles W. Nelson. ps. My mother,father, aunts,uncles,grand parents,sister and myself all spent are live in either Kane or DeKalb counties. hacksaw@grandecom.net\n\nSue McConnell (Submitted 8 Sep 2006)\n\n23 Sep 1946, from his obit, William PFEIL was buried, Lincoln (Highway) Memorial Cemetery.

The McQueen's settled in rural Elgin on what is now Highland Avenue in the area once known as \"McQueen\" (or in railroad literature, McQueen Station). At this time I am very involved in John Alexander McQueen history. He was George and Margaret's son. Lieutenant John McQueen was chief of scouts for General O. O. Howard during Civil War He rescued a prominent family during the infamous burning of Columbia, South Carolina. He was subsequently wounded and captured. He led a daring escape from Confederate hands in Spring of 1865. John McQueen became a prominent land owner in Plato township and a pioneer in the local dairy industry. He had a son, William Charles, that was very well known in Chicago area milk industry, was very active in organizing milk producer's marketing efforts in northern Illinois and southern Wisconsin, helped start and was first President of The Pure Milk Association in response to the city of Chicago's call for disease free milk, and was an adviser to Illinois governors in the early part of the 20th century.

I don't have alot of info, but from writings from my deceased father, I am told that my Great Grandfather Edward SHAW and Great Grandmother Jenny were both born in Elgin. They both had the surname Shaw, and Jennys parents owned the Shaw Hotel on Fountain Square. There apparently was a William Shaw, a carpenter, who built the Elgin Hotel in 1837, and the City Hotel in 1851. I don't know if these were related to Edward and Jenny. Do you have any records of a Shaw Hotel on Fountain Square? Edward and Jenny both died relatively young, I believe in their 40's, around 1897. My grandfather Alfred, was born in Elgin in 1890. He had an older sister Ethel, and an older brother George who later worked in the watch factory. Alfred graduated from Elgin High School. That's about it. If you had any info that could help fill in the gaps I would sure appreciate it, or any advice on how to research it better. dshaw1@nycap.rr.com\n\nSara Cushing (Submitted 19 Nov 2004)\n\nLooking for information on Henry A.

Oct 1837  PA) on 9 Apr 1857 in MN (probably Faribault, Rice Co., MN). Other spelling variations: Bartemess, Bartness, & Barteness. They lived in MN until they are located on the 1880, 1890, & 1900 Federal Censuses living in Aurora, Kane Co., IL. Jacob (aka John) was listed as being a painter and labourer. Eliza Bartemus was always a housewife. They had the following children together: Charles RUPP (1860)  MO; William RUPP (1864) - MN; Arthur George RUPP (11 Jun 1867) - MN; Albert RUPP (1871) - IL; Sidney C. RUPP (May 1874) - IL; Robert E.

BAKER and Sarah A. Stevens BAKER appear in the 1880 census of Batavia, Kane Co., IL. Algernon was 60 years old, a carpenter, born in New York, as were both of his parents. Sarah was 55 years old, born in New York, as were both of her parents. Also in the household are these people who are not known to me: Antoinette GRIFFITH, age 22, born in Wisconsin, both of her parents were born in New York. Under her are Lewis E. GRIFFITH, her \"son\", age 8, born in Iowa, both parents born in New York and Marcus A. GRIFFITH, also her \"son\", age 2, born in Illinois, both parents born in New York. I am thinking that these must be some kind of relatives. Algernon may have had a sister named Antoinette - maybe this was his niece? I think it's possible that she was the guardian of the 2 boys. Their natural mother was born in New York, according to the census. Maybe their parents were dead? Perhaps I can solve a mystery for someone else if we put our heads together. I have more on Algernon and Sarah. Their migration was from Fort Ann, Washington Co, NY > Bradford Township, Rock Co, WI > Milton, Du Page Co, IL > Winfield, Du Page Co, IL > Batavia, Kane Co, IL. I don't know what happened to them after the 1880 census. They had 4 children: Silas Thomas BAKER (my ggg-grandfather), born Fort Ann, Washington Co, NY, c.1843; Ellen A. BAKER, born WI, c. 1847; Herbert BAKER, born WI, c. 1852 and Mary \"Minnie\" BAKER, born WI, c. 1856. I only recently discovered the entire family through the censuses (1850-1880).

Colby was born in Vermont between 1809-1811. About 1835 he married Esther ?, an English Canadian, and moved to Rochester, Monroe Co., NY. Colby and Esther had 4 children: Chauncy (b. 1837, d. 1917), Wiliam C. (b. abt. 1841), Charles (b. abt. 1844) and Josephine (b. abt. 1848) The 1840 census lists them as KIMBALL. The 1850 and 1860 Census lists them as KIMBLE. While in Rochester, Colby worked as a house and portrait painter (producing at least 50 portraits), and ran the city art gallery (Pioneer Hall). Colby KIMBALL/KIMBLE is listed in at least two volumes for appraising paintings: one for the Midwest and Northeast. Sometime between 1865 and 1868, Colby and family (with the exception of Chauncy) moved to Kane Co. and purchased property in or near Campton. An 1872 property map shows a farm being owned by a C. KIMBALL in Campton, Kane Co. The property is close to Wasco and St. Charles The 1870 Census lists them as KIMBALL. Colby, Esther, Charles and Josephine do not appear in the 1880 Census either having moved, died or married (in the case of Josephine). William C. KIMBLE, son of Colby, continued to live in Kane Co. until at least 1910. An 1892 property map shows that the property that Colby owned, having been sold. However William continued to be a farmer until 1910. William married Margaret Jane ? about 1862 and had three children: George Edward, William Colby and Tone Theodore. All three are listed as having been born in Illinois. The 1910 Census lists William and Margaret as having 5 children with only 3 living at that time. They had also moved to St. Charles Township, Kane Co. and continued to farm. I have not been able to find any information on George Edward KIMBLE except a birth range 1870-1871. William Colby KIMBLE was born 1867-1869. About 1894, William married and had two children: Margaret H., born 1895-1896; and Maurine J., born 1894-1895; both born in Illinois. Sometime between 1896 and 1910 William's wife died. By 1910, William had moved to Center Township, Gibson Co., Indiana; working as a buttermaker. Margaret and Maurine stayed with their grandparents William C. and Margaret Jane til at least 1910. Tone Theodore KIMBLE was born December 1875. Tone lived in Campton, Kane Co. til at least 1900 as a school teacher, then moving to Hampshire, Kane Co. til at least 1930. Not sure if being a teacher in the same county for at least 30 years would leave a mark. Josephine Kimble, daughter of Colby was a music teacher in Kane Co. until at least 1880. Not sure of her whereabouts after that time. Any information as to the fate of these particular KIMBLE/KIMBALL's and/or Colby and Esther's origins, siblings and parents, wold be greatly appreciated. jedimstr63@aol.com\n\nCarol Anderson (Submitted 10 Jan 2003)\n\nJohn WILLIAMS born in Wales approximately 1792 immigrated to US 1849.

He died 30 Sep 1935 in Aurora, Kane County. He was born 13 Apr 1900 in Ulm, Germany. An inquiry to the Aurora Historical Society uncovered the following from Werner's Probate file which indicated his parents and, it is believed his ex-wife, were still in Germany. Werner's parents - Eugen BENISCHEK of Ulm-Schwaben, Germany; and Ida dePOTTERE of Herrenberg-Nuerrenberg, Germany. Werner's sister - Alice OSTERRITER of Stuttgart, Germany. The researcher guessed Werner's parents were divorced; and Alice was married to a man named Willy. Werner is buried in Lincoln Memorial Cemetery - Section MAA, Lot 209, Grave 2. Werner was divorced from a woman named Margaret, who was remarried to a man named Langford. The researched doesn't think there were any children, but is double checking and will let me know. Alice's name changed from her marriage to Willy Osterriter; Ida's name from her second marriage was dePottere. Werner was found in City Directories for a year or so before his death. There is no date for his arrival in the U. S. I checked the Ellis Island information online and there was no listing for Werner. At the time of his death, Werner was living at the Elk's Club in Aurora; he was divorced; and his occupation was listed as pathelogist and X-ray man at Copley Hospital for 8 years.
