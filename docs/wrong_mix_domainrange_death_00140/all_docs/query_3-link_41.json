        "text": "Lest We Forget… Images of the Black Civil Rights Movement\n\nAgainst the backdrop of Templeton's humble beginnings in the Great Depression, his passion for art blossomed, defying norms to pursue a career in painting. Influenced by Norman Rockwell's iconic Saturday Evening Post covers, he defied convention by choosing art as a career. He was inspired by the turmoil of the 1967 Detroit riots and embarked on a mission to visually document the struggle for equal rights. In his collaboration with Benjamin Mays, creating a list of individuals whose portraits would embody the fight for equal rights, he painted iconic leaders like Rosa Parks, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., Vice President Hubert Humphrey, A. Phillip Randolph, and others. Martin Luther King, Jr., was assassinated before a sitting could be scheduled, so for Dr. King’s portrait, Coretta Scott King helped Templeton choose the photo which became the basis of Templeton’s largest and most impressive portrait."
