        "text": "McLean Funeral Directors is committed to keeping our community informed and up to date with information that involves funeral service and the families that have suffered recent loss due to COVID-19. As a result of recent federal relief legislation, FEMA is providing Funeral Assistance up to $9,000 in funeral assistance to qualified families who have incurred COVID-19-related funeral expenses after January 20, 2020. FEMA will begin accepting applications for Funeral Assistance on Monday, April 12, 2021, through their dedicated call center at 844-684-6333, Monday-Friday, 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. (ET). FEMA Funeral Assistance covers expenses for funeral services and interment or cremation. Eligible services include a wide range of funeral-related services, such as transportation of up to two people for identification; transfer of remains; casket or urn; burial plot or cremation niche; marker or headstone; clergy or officiant services; arrangement of the funeral ceremony; use of funeral home equipment or staff; interment; costs associated with producing and certifying multiple death certificates; and additional expenses mandated by any applicable local or state government laws or ordinances. In order to apply for this relief, you will need three types of documentation:\n\nAn official death certificate attributing the death, directly or indirectly, to COVID-19. A death certificate stating the death “may have been caused by” or was “likely the result of” COVID-19 is sufficient, and death certificates not specifying this information may be amended, if qualified.\n\nProof of funeral expenses.\n\nIf your family received funds specifically for funeral costs, these must be disclosed and will offset the FEMA benefit.\n\nVisit FEMA's website for more information.\n\nOur top priority is always the safety of the families we serve, our community and our staff. We know you have all continued to see reports about the Coronavirus (COVID-19) and how it is affecting the world, our country, and even our community. Our family is closely monitoring the situation and we are following the health guidance for funeral homes provided by the CDC. As an extra precaution, we suggest staying home if you are sick, washing your hands, and covering coughs and sneezes. We are supplying extra hand sanitizer stations around our locations. If for some reason an individual is unable to attend a service, we will make available streaming of the service. We are also willing to make arrangements virtually if this would be more comfortable for your family. We are doing everything we can to support you and your family during this time. We will continue to monitor the CDC guidance and state and local health official guidance."
