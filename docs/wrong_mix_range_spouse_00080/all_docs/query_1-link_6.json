        "text": "This is it! The penultimate episode of American Idol is here and the Top 7 will perform twice in hopes to make the Top 5 in next week's finale. Host Ryan Seacrest will, as always, usher us through as judges Katy Perry, Lionel Richie, and Luke Bryan will provide their commentary and guidance from a distance. Mentor Bobby Bones will provide some insight as to what it'll take to make the finale plus there's a performance from last year's winner Laine Hardy!\n\nRyan opens the show with a thanks to moms and frontline workers before welcoming Lionel, Luke, and Katy, whose Disney costume this year is Mrs. Jumbo (Dumbo's mom) with her small dog Nugget dressed as Dumbo. And with that, we move quickly to the results. This week, voting opened after all seven finalists were initially revealed and before the second round of songs.\n\nContestant: Arthur Gunn\n\nSong: \"Kiss The Girl\" from The Little Mermaid\n\nJudges' Comments: Katy says he looked relaxed and cool and was really engaging with audience/camera. Luke says it's so fun watching him transition from a very soft-spoken guy to a potentially massive recording artist. Lionel says anything he sings will have the Arthur Gunn stamp on it, and that style and identity is the most important thing to have.\n\nContestant: Just Sam\n\nSong: \"A Dream Is A Wish Your Heart Makes\" from Cinderella\n\nJudges' Comments: Luke says the amazing thing about Sam's voice is how it holds up at every level through her range. Lionel says they've watched her grow up right in front of them and calls her a star. Katy liked when she gave it a bit of gas at the end and wanted a bit more.\n\nContestant: Jonny West\n\nSong: \"Almost There\" from The Princess and The Frog\n\nJudges' Comments: Lionel says he makes it look so effortless. Katy calls him a combination of Billy Joel, Randy Newman, and Paul Simon. Luke kept thinking, \"This guy is a pro,\" throughout his performance.\n\nContestant: Louis Knight\n\nSong: \"Can You Feel The Love Tonight\" from The Lion King\n\nJudges' Comments: Katy says Niall Horan better watch out because Louis is coming in real quick. Luke loved the tenderness in his performance, though thought it got a bit linear towards the end. Lionel says it's kind of difficult to keep your energy up without an audience, but he believe Louis can find and maintain that focus.\n\nContestant: Julia Gargano\n\nSong: \"Beauty and the Beast\" from Beauty and the Beast\n\nJudges' Comments: Luke loves when she lives in the cry area of her voice but feels the song may have been a little too low. Lionel said the lows did not compliment her as much as her mids and highs. Katy loved the arrangement and agrees, adding she's a star no matter what happens.\n\nContestant: Francisco Martin\n\nSong: \"You'll Be In My Heart\" from Tarzan\n\nJudges' Comments: Lionel says they're witnessing a transformation and he's giving confidence and enjoyment in his performances. Katy thought it was amazing and agrees his self-doubt has been stripped away. Luke says his performance felt like the \"King of the Jungle\" and \"King of American Idol.\"\n\nContestant: Dillon James\n\nSong: \"Our Town\" from Cars\n\nJudges' Comments: Katy says he applied their critiques from last week perfectly. Luke said it felt great from top to bottom. Lionel says he wasn't thinking about the notes, he was watching Dillon tell a story.\n\nBefore we get to the second round of songs, we're treated to a performance by last year's Idol winner Laine Hardy who contributes \"Life Is A Highway\" from Cars to Disney night.\n\nFor the Mother's Day dedications, Katy has changed out of her costume and shows off her baby bump, noting she kicks when the performances are good.\n\nContestant: Arthur Gunn\n\nSong: \"Hey, Ma\" by Bon Ver\n\nJudges' Comments: Luke says he's spoiling them with his great performances. Lionel says Arthur could sing the phone book. Katy says he's starting to really make her believe he's a professional touring musician.\n\nRyan takes a moment to announce some special guests and performance on next week's finale: Cynthia Erivo, Lauren Daigle, Rascal Flatts, Katy debuts her new single, Luke will sing \"One Margarita\", and Lionel is going to lead a performance of \"We Are The World\" (which he co-wrote).\n\nContestant: Just Sam\n\nSong: \"I Turn To You\" by Christina Aguilera\n\nJudges' Comments: Lionel says the performance is one step closer to her becoming Sam the Star. Katy says she has grown even in this episode and has a testimony and a victory in her voice. Luke says she's left a forever mark on them and there are little girls out there that she inspires every week.\n\nContestant: Jonny West\n\nSong: \"Amazing Grace\" (with additional lyrics by Jonny)\n\nJudges' Comments: Katy says he's a lot like Alejandro but not Alejandro. Luke says he has God-given songwriting talents. Lionel says Jonny has a future in the business and he should enjoy the ride.\n\nContestant: Louis Knight\n\nSong: \"You've Got A Friend\" by Carole King\n\nJudges' Comments: Luke wanted to hear more dynamics in the Disney song, which Louis delivered here. Lionel said it was simple and heartfelt, exactly what Louis needed to do. Katy says it was one of his best performances.\n\nContestant: Julia Gargano\n\nSong: \"Sweetest Devotion\" by Adele\n\nJudges' Comments: Katy loves hearing her versatility as she moves from ballads to pop songs to classic songs. Luke said she delivered the song like she owned it. Lionel said Julia wasn't thinking about the song, she just delivered it and it was one of her best performances.\n\nContestant: Francisco Martin\n\nSong: \"River\" by. Leon Bridges\n\nJudges' Comments: Katy says his performance was soulful, beautiful, and real. Luke thinks it was better than the original. Lionel loves that his confidence is front and center and that he's no longer in his head.\n\nContestant: Dillon James\n\nSong: \"Hang On, Hang On\" by Amos Lee\n\nJudges' Comments: Luke says it was a great performance and he's going to go far no matter where he finishes in the competition. Lionel says Dillon is a fabulous inspiration to kids who are struggling and it's the best performance he's done so far. Katy says he feels lighter and freer than the first time they saw him.\n\nIf you want your favorites to make it into the Top 5 and possibly become 2020's American Idol, now is the time to visit the voting page to vote!
