I never could have imagined the Commander in Chief on a call putting personal and political gain above our national security.\n\nI believe the Commander in Chief role is the most sacred responsibility of the Presidency, and it is the last place where partisan politics belongs. We hold this highest of standards because we know the incredible power of that singular office. It is a power that has the potential for doing incredible good, but if corrupted, it weakens America’s national security, international standing and the framework of our very Democracy.\n\nBy urging the Ukrainian government to take action to influence our Democracy, Trump has violated that power and the trust of the American people. If the facts are corroborated, that violation, and my understanding of its implications, has led me to come to the conclusion that the President has committed an impeachable offense.\n\nThis decision does not come easily. My focus as your member of Congress remains on the people of Burlington and Ocean Counties. We have to work to lower health care and prescription drug costs, lower taxes and support our veterans. We have to break through the hyper partisanship and find real meaningful ways to work across the aisle.\n\nI have sworn an oath to uphold the Constitution three times in my life. Over the course of my career I worked under both Republicans and Democrats as long as I thought that the leaders who I served were putting our country’s best interests first.
