Lincoln High School’s Tali Chang-Hong Braester was a runner-up. Both won tuition support from the Foundation by writing essays on courageous Washingtonians who improved their communities by fighting for their ideals.\n\nMorgan, who will attend the University of Maryland, won a $5,000 scholarship while Braester took home $2,500. They will attend the University of Washington.\n\nIn its 11th year, the Stim Bullitt Civic Courage Scholarship honors the legacy of the late library supporter, community leader, and activist Stimson Bullitt, who believed that civic leadership could make a lasting positive impact on society. The contest challenges local high school and college students to write an essay about an individual or group from our state who demonstrated the courage to advance an important community issue at great personal, political, or professional risk.\n\nThe Seattle Public Library Foundation received essays from students representing seven Seattle public high schools: Ballard, Garfield, Ingraham, Lincoln, Nathan Hale, Roosevelt, West Seattle.\n\nEach year, $10,000 is divided among three outstanding students, and their essays are permanently cataloged in The Seattle Public Library’s Seattle Room.\n\nRead the essays:\n\nLeah Morgan: “Jeanette Williams: An Unstoppable Force”\n\nTali Chang-Hong Braester: “Pulling the Thread”\n\nNational Merit Scholar\n\nShout out to Cyrus Edwards who was awarded the National Merit Carleton College Scholarship. Edwards, who graduated from Garfield High School in June, plans to study astrophysics.\n\nEdwards was among the more than 2,900 winners of National Merit Scholarships financed by U.S. colleges and universities. These awards provide between $500 and $2,000 annually for up to four years of undergraduate study at the institution financing the scholarship.\n\nCollege-sponsored Merit Scholarship winners are a part of the distinguished group of more than 6,870 high school seniors who will receive National Merit Scholarships for college undergraduate study.\n\nSuperintendent Jones Among Top 100 Influencers in Education\n\nCongratulations to Superintendent Brent Jones who was named a Top 100 District Administration (DA) influencer!\n\nThe DA 100 influencer list recognizes the country’s most influential, impactful leaders and innovators in K-12 education.\n\nDr. Jones was recognized for his dedication to ensuring all students thrive by transforming organizational culture and redesigning preK-12 systems and supports.\n\nRead more about Dr. Jones’ DA 100 recognition\n\nJune SPS Recognitions\n\nJust because the school year is almost over, that doesn’t mean the accolades are slowing down. Across the district, students and staff are still shining a spotlight on SPS by winning awards, scholarships, prestigious internships and more!\n\nCleveland STEM’s Claire Abe Named SPS Counselor of the Year\n\nSeattle Public Schools’ Department of College and Career Readiness selected Cleveland STEM High School’s Claire Abe as the School Counselor of the Year. This program honors the best counselors in the district – those who provide excellent service in their comprehensive school counseling programming.\n\nAbe is in her 10th year as a school counselor; six of those spent at Cleveland. Before becoming a counselor, she was a social worker for the district. Abe is a force as she advocates for students’ needs at multiple levels, including the school board, city council, and at Cleveland STEM.\n\n“I feel honored to receive this award, but it would not be possible without the support and collaboration of so many amazing staff members at Cleveland,” Abe said. “I especially want to recognize my counseling department colleagues, Napsiyah Sallee, Chloe Kimiai, Michael Okumoto, and Kelly Tagupa. Any accomplishment made is due to our counseling team’s collaboration, hard work, and dedication for our students. I feel very fortunate to be a part of the best counseling team in the district.”\n\nNominations for Counselor of the Year are submitted by the community and voted on by other district counselors.\n\nTaking Flight\n\nThe Museum of Flight awarded more than $150,000 in scholarships to four Seattle Public Schools seniors for post-secondary education and flight training during a ceremony held at the Museum on May 9. The scholarships are awarded each year to students who have participated in The Museum of Flight’s education programs.\n\nThien Thang, a senior at Garfield High School, was awarded the 2024 Frank “Sam” and Betty Houston Post-Secondary STEM Education Scholarship. The prize is worth $120,000 towards a degree related to aerospace. Thang will attend the University of North Dakota and major in Commercial Aviation. His goal is to become a commercial airline pilot.\n\nThe Center School’s Sam MacCarthy-Grant and Ryder Waltmire from Ballard High School both received $14,000 flight training scholarships. MacCarthy-Grant will attend Green River College where he will study Aeronautical Science.

In a recent conversation between students after Mr. Flavors had interacted with them, one student asked, “Who was that guy?” One of the other students responded, “Oh, that’s Mr. Flavors.

Since Audra joined our staff, the collection has been made exciting, and student reading minutes have increased dramatically. Her collection is relevant and time sensitive. In addition, her library lessons are engaging and impactful. She also loves to collaborate with teachers on projects and encourages us to branch out from our comfort zone. We are truly lucky to have her at Lawton!” – Emmy Misner, colleague\n\nHenry “Hank” Morgan (Lichton Springs K-8): “Since the first week of school Library has been my kindergartener’s favorite class. I have heard the same from classmates’ parents. I’m not sure what magic Hank works to make library a bigger draw than P.E. or recess. I do know my kid comes home each week with a mix of books. Some he can read or enjoys having read to him. Some are above his reading level, but he was allowed to try them and learn about selecting books he enjoys. Hank does a great job of keeping the kids engaged with reading. This is, in my opinion, a vital element of creating a community of readers and learners.” – Maura Madden, parent\n\nMary Bannister (Louisa Boren STEM K-8): “Ms. Bannister is like the energizer bunny – she is always on the go. She takes time to pull out special interest books and highlights them. The kids love it when Ms. Bannister reads to them during their library time. She is always thinking of the staff on special occasions and never misses an encouraging card with a treat tucked inside! She is not afraid of dressing for the occasion (i.e., St. Patrick’s Day, Pajama Day – any day!) When we were hybrid, and had an outdoor library, she would take great care to set out enough books for each grade and interests. Ms. Bannister, I believe, goes above and beyond for our school and students. She’s an inspiration to be a better human.” – Jody Hapgood, colleague\n\nKirk Van Irvin (Lowell Elementary): “Kirk is new to Lowell, and we all so appreciate the way he immediately opened the library, has expanded the collection, has invited student leadership and voice in set-up, and created opportunities for students to grow in community as readers.” – Chelsea Dziedzic, colleague\n\nStacia Bell (Madison Middle School): “Stacia champions the joy of reading every single day, connecting students to books they would otherwise never find and love. She has done an AMAZING job of purchasing and promoting books that mirror the beautiful diversity in our world. She brings popular authors to our campus–live and virtually, giving students a unique opportunity to interact with published writers. And Stacia’s influence at our school extends far beyond the library walls. She is a thoughtful, committed educational technologist, a Career Ladder Teacher, and an organizer of student teachers.” – Susan Ovens, colleague\n\nAbby Levin (Magnolia Elementary): “Ms. Abby always supports us in reading and beyond. She is an amazing person and is passionate about so many things. If I ever need a book or just some love, Ms. Abby can find me both! I am so happy she works at my school, and I have had the wonderful gift of learning from her!” – Jordan Daligcon, student\n\nDanae Powers (McGilvra Elementary): “Our librarian was INCREDIBLE during the pandemic. She really was the glue that held our school community together with all her wonderful spirit day video montages and other all-school activities which people submitted photos from home. She created the most amazing video lessons for remote learning. And back in person, she comes up with very thoughtful lesson plans – the kids are learning so much from her every week. This woman is a superstar!” – Sarah Cook, parent\n\nDana West (Nathan Hale High School): “Ms. West is just so cool. She’s super friendly with students, she’s with the times, and she can relate to all the students, whether it’s about books, classes, or extracurricular. I definitely want to be like her someday.” – Max Lommers, student\n\nTracy Appleyard (Orca K-8): “Tracy is an incredible librarian and human. She cares deeply for her students and is passionate about making books accessible for all students. During remote learning last year, Ms. Appleyard kept up an online reservation system and held library hours outside the main entrance to Orca every other Tuesday afternoon. Seeing the smiles behind masks as students exchanged books and got to see Ms. Appleyard in person was the kind of necessary joy during a difficult time. This year, Ms. Appleyard has worked hard to bring new and interesting books to Orca’s library, with a focus on the representation of all types of students from diverse backgrounds. We love Ms. Appleyard!” – Heather Zucker, parent\n\nAmi Pendley Noble (Pathfinder K-8): “Ami is the best librarian ever! She is supportive, fun, and leaves lots of room for us to be ourselves. She reads us books that we have never heard of, but that everyone should know. She has the best books, and her book recommendations are amazing too. I have read many books that she suggested, and I haven’t found one that I didn’t like! The library isn’t just for reading either. We have many activities that we can do besides looking at books or reading. We have lessons about all different subjects, and we learn a lot. Not only from books but other types of media too. Every time we leave the library we leave with new knowledge and confidence. She makes our school a better place and is definitely the most loving staff member in our school. Ami is fabulous!” – Jo Russo, student\n\nRebecca Wynkoop (Robert Eagle Staff Middle School): “I love how she’s fun and really nice. She takes into consideration what kids want and is willing to buy books to add to the library if it’s requested. She makes fun activities to do outside of reading and makes the library a fun and safe space for everyone.” – Ava Montejano, student\n\nChris Robert (Roxhill & Highland Park elementaries): “He is so dynamic and a fan favorite at school. The monthly library songs are sung at our house all year round.” – Erin Conery, parent\n\nSarah Johnson (Seattle World School): “Sarah does an amazing job of connecting with the students at Seattle World School. It can be challenging at times since … English is not their primary language. Sarah strives to use different media to answer students’ questions and assist in many ways beyond recommending books such as trouble-shooting computer problems, making sure they have a hotspot, and connecting to needed resources inside and outside the school. Sarah always does this balancing act of juggling many tasks with a smile on her face. Not only does she help the students with their needs, she provides assistance to her colleagues and staff. She is a leader in our school.” – Ana Short, colleague\n\nAmy Young (View Ridge Elementary): “Our librarian is simply the best. She’s greeted like a celebrity at dismissal by all the kids because they adore her. She fosters a love of books and kept my child excited about reading throughout remote learning. As a volunteer, I also get to hear some of the lessons she provides during library time, and I am amazed at the learning that goes on. She weaves elements of history, science, and language arts into her lessons while teaching the kids how to analyze books for literary elements, contextual clues and more, all while they are having fun. Ms. Young is a fabulous librarian!” – Jennifer Beaverson, parent\n\nMaggie Block (Washington Middle School): “They taught me the power of words and the power of creating a safe space. They taught me the power of my words and that what I say can impact others. They inspire me to use my words to help others.” – Nor Luloff, student\n\nKristi Leland (Wedgwood Elementary): “Ms. Leland goes above and beyond her role as librarian, not only guiding students towards books they might love but also taking the time to genuinely check in with each student. My son would live in the library if he could!” – Sara Gutmann, parent\n\nPaula Wittmann (West Woodland Elementary): “Ms. Wittmann is a wonderful advocate for libraries, books and reading. She is very friendly and approachable and always has great book suggestions. She is very thoughtful in planning lessons and highlighting books for different grade levels and tailoring her teaching and discussion to the level of the kids she is working with. She has curated a wonderful collection at West Woodland and made the library there a safe and enjoyable space for all the students and teachers. We are lucky to have her!” – Rachel Rigdon-Bel, parent\n\nRachel Kresl (American Indian Resource Library) “I really love our new books … there are some really amazing books coming out,” Meany Middle School students.

Let us know at Microsoft Forms\n\nFebruary Shout Outs\n\nSPS Shout Outs for School Counselors: We Are Better Together!\n\nWe asked, you answered.\n\nAccolades for school counselors poured in as we recognized National School Counseling Week (February 7-11). This year’s theme, “Better Together,” focused on how counselors work with administrators, teachers, and other school-based mental health professionals for the good of all students. The week also highlights the impact school counselors can have in helping students achieve school success and plan for a career.\n\nSeveral nominations cited their school counselor’s ability to engage with students in a way that supports not only college and career readiness, but also social/emotional development. Others shared personal experiences of how their school counselors help students examine their strengths, interests and talents.\n\n“School counseling programs help to increase student achievement and provide a much-needed resource for students, parents, teachers and administrators,” said Jill Cook, executive director of the American School Counselor Association, the sponsors of National School Counseling Week. “Counselors are integral to student success.”\n\nSeattle Public Schools thanks all our counselors for their commitment to our students. Here’s what students, families and colleagues had to say about their school counselors:\n\nMelissa Matsui “is such an important part of our school community. She helps create and maintain our school culture through her comprehensive guidance program. She is teaching our students skills that will bring them a greater quality of life even into their adulthood. I cannot imagine how our students and staff could have been so well supported emotionally throughout the pandemic without the empathy and guidance of Ms. Matsui.”\n\nPrincipal Katie May, Thurgood Marshall\n\n“I am writing to nominate John Taylor, school counselor at Benjamin Franklin Day Elementary, for his excellent work in our school community. I would also like to nominate Dan Turner, who was an SPS school counselor for decades and substituted for Mr. Taylor during his paternity leave earlier this year.”\n\nAllison D. Brooks\n\n“I would like to submit a nomination on behalf of each of the phenomenal school counselors that I am fortunate to work with at Franklin High School: Natalie Weinstein, Lexi Awdziejczyk, Tony Foland, Darrell Lee, and Corey Goldstein. These five dedicated professionals continually strive to meet the needs of all members of the Franklin community, both as individuals and collectively.”\n\nSchool Psychologist Ashley Burchett, Franklin High School\n\n“The team at Ingraham – Angie Allemand, Jensen Bonney, Jennifer Connolly, Kathryn Feder, and Leanne Hust – are a creative, collaborative and caring group of individuals who work tirelessly to meet student needs. This team fosters a true team approach in their work with students, parents, and staff. We are so lucky to have such a competent and dedicated group of counselors and counseling support staff here at Ingraham.”\n\nTristie McJilton, Inclusion Education Services, Ingraham High School\n\n“Katie Runions’s [McDonald International Elementary] small group sessions are talked about for days after with enthusiasm and understanding. As a parent, we are thrilled with the connection and comfort our child feels with Katie, and we also benefit with tips, tricks and resources that are sent weekly. She has been tremendously helpful for our family to have open conversations and learning moments as we all get better together.”\n\nBeth Koemans, parent\n\n“Jenny Brooks from Salmon Bay went above and beyond the past year visiting families in their yards to provide support and guidance.”\n\nDanae Nakoneczny, parent\n\n“Tammy Foulk [Cascadia Elementary] has been an amazing support for our neurodiverse population to survive and thrive in the social and emotional space. She has a keen eye for justice, a kind heart for the hurt, and a witty approach for solutions to all disputes. We love her. She will always be in our hearts for all the teaching she has allowed for us parents and our kids.”\n\nAyca Dabis, parent\n\nOther counselors receiving recognition:\n\nSaid Ahmed [Bailey Gatzert Elementary] – “He is also a leader for other aspiring school counselors, frequently taking on interns to guide them in their own process of growing into this role.”\n\nGail Olson Laing [Ballard High School] – “I did not anticipate a quick response as I know the counselors support so many kids. It was clear that she had familiarized herself with our child’s transcript and knew the school, teachers and classes well.”\n\nJulie Seltzer [Washington Middle School] – “She has been extremely helpful as my daughter has navigated some tough times. It is just such a relief for her to have such a kind and understanding resource.”\n\nCheryl Fraley [Whitman Middle School] – “Even with the staff shortages and all that has been happening in the last 2 years, Cheryl has been very competent, patient and thorough!”\n\nDo you know a student or staff member who deserves a shoutout?

From cats to calligraphy, these talented students let their artwork tell their stories.\n\nMark, 3rd Grade, Rising Star\n\nWhen Mark’s art teacher, Elaine Dondoyano, says he loves cats, she means he really loves cats.\n\nHe loves to read about them, study them, and draw them. Dondoyano has a binder full of his colorful cat drawings. As Mark flips through the pages, he lists them off one by one.\n\n“This is a cougar. This is a wolf. This is a cat. This is a kitten,” he said. “But I like drawing all animals.”\n\nMark’s artwork is featured on the call for submissions page for the Museum of Museums’ website, which is promoting its “Cats vs. Dogs” exhibition opening in February.\n\nHis work will also be included in the show located in their Emergence Room, a space for rotating, monthly showcases of visual art that celebrates young artists from around the Pacific Northwest.\n\nNouryani Saleh, 12th Grade, Cleveland\n\nAs the youngest of three kids, Nouryani tends to copy her older siblings. She started drawing at a young age after seeing her older sister constantly creating art.\n\nAfter spending years creating digital faces of celebrities, Nouryani is challenging herself by drawing landscapes and architecture. She mainly paints sunsets and skylines based on places she envisions, but she still makes digital art when people commission her work.\n\n“Over the summer, a lot of people wanted me to do calligraphy signs, so I would use digital art to plan everything out and then do it by hand.”\n\nWhat some might call doodling, Nouryani’s customized calendar sketches are where she really shines. She takes ordinary day planners and adds themed drawings to each month, a process that takes dozens of hours to finish. Early on during the pandemic, Nouryani had more time to draw, but as she enters the last semester of her high school career, she’s had to sacrifice her art time for college applications and homework.\n\n“It’s kind of sad to not have time anymore,” she said. “I try to finish as much work as I can for ASB and all my classes. I try to stay on top of things so my weekends can be free [to draw].”\n\nNouryani’s talent has served her school well. After doing an online internship in marketing, she now uses her skills to create advertisements for Cleveland’s Associated Student Body (ASB) and the senior class. She also helps run their Instagram account.\n\nNouryani has her eyes set on attending Stanford, University of Southern California, or Seattle University. She plans to major in marketing.\n\nDo you know a student who deserves a shoutout?

Do you know a student or staff member who deserves a shout-out? Email publicaffairs@seattleschools.org\n\nJoan Steinberg, Bailey Gatzert Elementary\n\nJoan Steinberg is the first to arrive and one of the last staff members to leave. As the school assistant and attendance secretary at Bailey Gatzert Elementary, Steinberg is a jack of all trades who usually masters them all. According to her colleague, Administrative Secretary Carrie Bolden, Steinberg is punctual, dedicated, and up for any challenge.\n\n“Ms. Joan is never late and has not had a sub yet,” Bolden said. “During lunch, you can hear her giving directions to the students, reminding them of the rules of the lunchroom and playground activities.”\n\n“She honestly loves our children … [and] is a joy to have at our school,” Bolden said.\n\nBolden said Steinberg brings a wealth of knowledge from her previous job and has implemented some of those processes at Bailey Gatzert Elementary. In addition to her many duties, this year Steinberg added school webmaster to her list and uses the opportunity to grow and collaborate.\n\n“She is very good at what she does and often asks for my opinion or invites my suggestions on changing formats,” Bolden said.\n\nLeticia Bazemore, Martin Luther King Elementary\n\nAntoinette Harrison, a project manager with SPS, has seen firsthand how Special Education Assistant Leticia Bazemore incorporates love, kindness, and energy into her interactions with students. While K-2 students line up outside the door before school begins, Bazemore has the students engage in morning movements that gets them ready for a day of learning. Harrison has affectionately dubbed Bazemore as her daughter’s new in-school auntie.\n\n“She greets students and parents authentically, and when she is not there, her presence is most definitely missed,” Harrison said. “As a parent and an SPS employee, it brings me joy to see her going above and beyond to create a warm and welcoming environment starting at the door.”\n\nThomas Castle, TOPS K-8\n\nThomas Castle, a 7th grade social studies and language arts teacher at TOPS K-8. As a certified sign language interpreter, Ryan Page has spent a lot of time observing teachers and their teaching styles. He appreciates Castle’s positivity and overall commitment to his students. From classroom management to student participation, Page said Castle knows how to keep all eyes on the lesson.\n\n“Mr. Castle is the most engaging teacher I have ever interpreted for in my five years of interpreting within classrooms,” Page said. “Students are … truly delighted to be part of his classroom.”\n\nAccording to Page, Castle exhibits extraordinary classroom management while retaining respect from his students. Castle also goes out of his way to learn the American Sign Language sign for every new topic he introduces.\n\n“It is truly a pleasure interpreting for him,” Page said.\n\nNovember Shout Outs\n\nThank You School Custodians!\n\nSeattle Public Schools is shining a spotlight on members of the SPS community who have made significant contributions to the district; people who go above and beyond in service at our schools. We received dozens of emails from staff members offering shout-outs, but none received as much praise as the custodial staff.\n\nDespite having 60 vacant custodial positions that add more strain to their jobs, this team of workers has been performing heroics since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. They have worked tirelessly since the shutdown March 2020, ensuring schools were cleaned, disinfected, and ready for students to return.\n\nWhen schools re-opened in April 2021, custodians were faced with staffing shortages, which led to worries of not being able to clean the schools adequately. Director of Facility Operations Frank Griffin oversees the custodial staff. He said the team stepped up and worked overtime to ensure that schools were ready for students.\n\nOnce school started in Fall 2021, custodial staff faced even more challenges with increased workloads caused by outdoor lunches and the constant disinfecting of common surfaces was a strain on the team. But they were not deterred.\n\n“This team is all about serving the staff and students of SPS,” said Griffin. “They understand the importance of the role and have achieved nothing short of miracles.”\n\nWhat SPS Staff Have to Say\n\nRead some of the praise heaped upon the custodial staff:\n\nFrom Director of Facility Operations Frank Griffin\n\nBounma Thongdymanyvong, Inspector and Liaison Specialist: Headed the COVID-disinfecting response to schools with confirmed COVID cases. He has worked tirelessly to ensure spaces were safe for students\n\nYoung Wong, Custodial Engineer, Ballard High School: Trained 100+ new custodians over the course of a year. Ensured they were successful in their roles of supporting the educational process.\n\nMohamed Abdalla, Custodial Engineer: Faithfully served the staff and students at Viewlands Elementary with a can-do attitude and ownership of his role in relocating the school.\n\nNicole Selstead, Custodial Engineer and Roger Broz, License Assistant: Worked tirelessly to ensure that West Woodland was ready for staff and students upon reopening, juggling work with contractors, buildings staff, and various other SPS departments.\n\nFrom staff around the district\n\n“They are simply fantastic and much appreciated,” Jim Stoltzfus, special education teacher, Blaine Middle School.\n\n“Aaron Larson is incredible! [He is] kind, hardworking, personable, funny, thoughtful, and super communicative. Our school is so lucky to have him. Even as demands for his role have gone up over the pandemic, he’s kept an atmosphere of warmth and optimism, and our building is holistically stronger in light of his contributions,” Carrie Snow, resource teacher, Magnolia Elementary.\n\n“Walter Harris worked briefly at Sanislo Elementary but got transferred back to Denny Middle. Walter consistently goes above and beyond to build solid relationships, interact with the kids, and be a generally amazing person. Walter should be recognized for his hard work, amazing attitude, and making life better wherever he works,” Liz Jimmerson-Alaeddinoglu, first grade teacher, Sanislo Elementary School."
