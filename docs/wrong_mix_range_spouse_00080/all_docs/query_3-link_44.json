Despite the historical cultural, social, economic, and political influence of Afro Latinx in the region, their presence, contributions, and recognition remains unspoken and often disregarded. To embrace diversity both at TC and within the Latin American and Caribbean communities in and out of the United States, Afro Latinx cannot be forgotten nor silenced. This initiative will advance educational conversation about ongoing research and practical work related to Afro Latinx while connecting TC and other academic institutions in New York City. The panel will showcase different rhythms with live music for the audience to interact with and dance at the end of the Q&A session. It is open to the entire community.\n\nII.

Mysak Clinic, Department of Biobehavioral Studies, TC ASL Club\n\nDescription: Popular media rarely highlights deaf and hard of hearing (DHH) communities; when issues of DHH language and culture are touched upon, they are often portrayed through a hearing lens as monolithic (i.e., the one Deaf community). However, DHH communities in the United States are extraordinarily diverse. Led by a hard of hearing faculty member in collaboration with the TC ASL Club and the Edward D. Mysak Clinic, the Deaf and Hard of Hearing Voices Film Series will center the experiences of DHH individuals through film screenings, interactive talkbacks, and facilitated community conversations. Three events will take place over three months. Each event will feature a film screening along with interactive talkbacks and/or community conversations that delve more deeply into the film’s themes: language access, community visibility, and incarceration. Audience members will ask questions and engage directly with filmmakers and members of the DHH community, challenging previously held notions of what it means to be DHH. Each event will end with dedicated time for mingling and smaller, facilitated conversations based on the issues raised by the film.\n\nV.

Panelists will have the opportunity to share their work, perspectives, and reflections on strategies to increase the meaningful participation of local RLOs and CBOs in humanitarian responses to crisis, conflict, and displacement. Conference attendees will critically reflect and interrogate the structures of power and control that exclude the participation of local leaders and activists. The multi-modal design of the conference promotes interactivity and collaboration between conference participants and is designed to ensure that content is accessible and inclusive for a diverse audience.

Beyond the activity of debating itself, we aim to create a holistic experience that goes beyond the classroom, encouraging participants to think critically, analyze information and evaluate diverse perspectives around today’s vital social political issues. As we reimagine educational communities, we aim to fully engage in the Smith Learning Center’s multimodal world of possibility. Together, we will use our racial justice, economic justice and social justice lenses to partake in intellectually stimulating yet friendly debate tasks and activities to practice structuring arguments, challenging claims, posing critical inquiries, presenting supportive evidence, and employing active listening techniques through debate flow methods. Participants will elevate their voices through truthful conversations based on human dignity, civil engagement awareness, and social change. Their conversations will unfold as they articulate social justice issues and solutions encompassing sectors such as housing, health care, education, technology, and media. Topics will stem from the New York City Urban Debate League and the National Speech and Debate Association Debate Topics.\n\nIX.

With our initiative, two parallel focus group sessions will be held at TC with Spanish-speaking/bilingual Latinx people with PD and their care partners, respectively. Sessions are estimated to last 90 minutes each and will be led by graduate students from the Communication Sciences and Disorders program and the Bilingual Latinx Mental Health clinic to foster interdisciplinary collaboration between the two departments. These focus groups will aim at understanding the cultural values of Spanish-speaking/ bilingual Latinx people with PD and their families on support groups, communication needs and mental health. A discussion with students from both departments will follow the completion of the focus groups in a special session hosted by both departments. Implications for clinical practice as related to culturally responsive care in this population will be highlighted.\n\nX.

Through the making of recycled paper out of our junk mail, old exams, bills, etc., we will ask what happens to us as we create pulp out of material that has potential to harm us and also the ecosystems that we are a part of. As we ask these questions, we will explore and feel how recycling, reusing, and sustaining can inform our bodies, minds, and the worlds around us. We will ask how making paper may cause a shift within our own selves, and what this shift can mean for the ecosystems that we are a part of. The paper we make will be transformed into handmade books, using processes that center and work with imperfections.\n\nXII.

Visitors will then travel through the art and be greeted by a recording device at the end to reflect on the experience and how who they are fits with TC at large.\n\nXIII. Writing to Read NYC\n\nRecipient(s): Dr. Amina Tawasil, Lecturer, PhD Programs in Anthropology, Dr. Marcelle Mentor, Lecturer, PhD Arts & Humanities, English Education, Skylar Hou, Ph.D. Student in the Program in Anthropology and Education, Student President of Association of Educational Anthropology\n\nSponsor(s): Association of Educational Anthropologists, Arts & Humanities- English Education\n\nDescription: “Writing to Read the City” emphasizes diversity and community. It encourages underserved students to tap into the New York City urban space for sources of inspiration, and challenges the dominant perception about writing as a solitary act. The goal is to create a space for underserved students to network, collaborate, and complete their writing projects together, while learning about the diverse histories of New York City neighborhoods. Students are encouraged to understand the role of space and the act of writing as a way to encourage them to create their own writing groups now and in the future. Every Friday, we meet in different pre-designated cafes in the 5 boroughs. The only requirement is that students bring with them a writing project and learn about the neighborhood we are writing in. The students then sit and write together for two hours. The idea is that space constitutes the act of writing as much as writing reconstitutes that space through words on paper.\n\n2019-2020 Grant Recipients\n\nA Catalyst for Change: Shirley Chisholm's Educational AgendaBeyond Infrastructure:\n\nRecipients: Honey Walrond\n\nCo-Sponsors: Institute for Urban & Minority Education (IUME), The Black Education Research Collective (BERC), Department of Government Relations\n\nA Catalyst for Change consists of a two-part event commentary including a wall exhibit and a panel discussion centered around the film The Fighting Shirley Chisholm.

While the increases in research in epigenetics in psychiatry has benefited people with mental illness through the development of improved treatment modalities and nuanced, complex understanding of mental disorders, it inadvertently promoted a more deterministic and stigmatizing view of mental illness. Therefore, we aim to discuss in depth the advantages and disadvantages of assuming the medical model for the etiology of mental health diseases and the way it affects the lives of people with mental illnesses.\n\nVII. 8th Annual Diversity in Research and Practice Conference\n\nAndrew Mulinge & Brian Allen\n\nSponsor(s): Black Student Network\n\nThe Diversity in Research and Practice Conference is successfully entering its 8th year at Teachers College.

Deconstructing Negative Discourse Brown Bag Series\n\nMartha St. Jean and Rashida Moore\n\nSponsors: Department of Mathematics, Science, and Technology\n\nWithin urban education, words and phrases including trouble-maker, at-risk, defiant, have been used to define and explain the experiences of certain boys and girls, thereby affecting and determining their treatment in schools. Instead of identifying students by their names, they are perceived through behavior. This space is not the final solution but will play an important role in transforming how educators of students of color, within urban spaces, interact with and address the politics of schooling. Brown Bags are an informally positive method of disruption. The space will be used to address the negative schema developed through the years by students about success, failure, and school, with the goal of what educators can do to initiate formal and lasting change.\n\nXI. Leadership Salon\n\nChloe Wright & Jumpei Kato\n\nSponsor(s): Organizational Leadership Association\n\nThis event is composed of panel discussions and round table activities hosted by students or alumni from different programs with different backgrounds and will end with a group discussion with the facilitator(s). Through communication, it is our hope that the attendees will gain an opportunity to exchange ideas with students from variety of programs on the topic of leadership and what that looks like in a variety of fields. Leadership is one of the core values most of our academic programs promote. However, there are very few opportunities to cross-pollinate skills, and knowledge across departments. It is our hope to create a community space where together, faculty and students and discusses leadership and what leaderships looks like in a diverse community.\n\nXII.

MASCLAB Participatory Screening Series\n\nJoe Riina-Ferrie, Cristina Salazar Gallardo & Lisa Mertes Sepahi\n\nSponsor(s): Media and Social Change Lab\n\nThe Media and Social Change Lab (MASCLab) participatory screening initiative is our way of putting into action the idea that engagement with media products can be more than a passive act of receiving information. Rather, we aim to use three screenings to intentionally build connections between the community participants that both produce and watch media. We will use these film screenings to anchor events that invite people to use what they have learned and seen to engage across institutional boundaries on the social issues presented: immigrant rights, foster care, and gun violence. This series invites people to be active participants in a set of ideas, conditions, and challenges--to accept roles as not just attendees of a series but as co-inquirers and citizens. This supports a focus on diversity and community by bringing together many interested parties through the use of a common media artifact to start conversation, allowing for common ground outside of our usual patterns and partners of discourse.\n\nXV. Mind-Body Wellness for Special Needs\n\nShivangi Khatter, Saloni Dev & Jin Zhao\n\nSponsor(s): Neurodiversity & Student Development and Activities\n\nNeurodiversity is the philosophy and civil rights movement that advocates the fact that the conditions identified as developmental disabilities (e.g. Autism, Dyslexia, ADHD) are natural expressions of the human brain and mind. Akin to the intersectional identities based on sex, gender, race, ethnicity. These conditions can be considered as different cognitive orientations. People diagnosed with such conditions often have a remarkable talent in certain areas, however, those exceptionalities are often overlooked, and said people are stigmatized for not conforming to the typical majority. Nevertheless, a healthy society needs all kinds of minds to work together, as well as educators who are versatile to learning differences. NeurodiversiTC aims to reach students, faculty, and staff across many departments to shift the paradigm on curricula, pedagogy, assessment and policy. The motto behind our work is: “Different, not less”- Temple Grandin.\n\nXVI.

In Everett Lounge, we will provide student organizations and independent groups of students with individual tables where they will bring two to three cultural dishes (one grain-bases and one meat-based) and music. In the center of the room will be several round tables to seat our 40-50 expected participants. Students and faculty will be able to eat, connect, and learn about the home and culture of a few of their classmates at these tables. These conversations will also be facilitated and nurtured by discussion and art activities. We expect at least five organizations to participate and two student groups representing Jamaica and China have been confirmed.\n\nXVIII.

Our goal is to foster meaningful dialogue and collaboration around the pressing issues facing these communities today. Racial discrimination has been brought to the forefront locally, nationally, and internationally around issues such as police and community relations and unequal access to education. The Black Lives Matter movement in the United States and Fees Must Fall movement in South Africa are just two examples of a coordinated response to this discrimination. The Center hopes that by bringing different actors seeking to end discrimination into dialogue they may work in collaboration towards justice and equity.\n\nXX.
