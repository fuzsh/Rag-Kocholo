        "text": "Introduction\n\nPrivate law—the law of our horizontal interactions—offers many in­strumental benefits to society: Property and contract law help us assign and reassign entitlements, while tort law helps allocate responsibilities regarding those entitlements. Nothing that follows is intended to imply that these instrumental functions are insignificant. Private ordering may well provide a useful means to achieving important social ends. Yet private law is valuable beyond its contingent, external benefits: It is intrinsically valuable. The intrinsic value of private law lies in its con­struction of frameworks of respectful interaction—of just relationships—among genuinely free and equal individuals.\n\nPrivate law is not reducible to common law. Its promulgation and ad­judication is not confined to the chambers of judges. Rather, private law—whether judge made or statutory—is the law that governs our inter­personal relationships as free and equal persons; it stands in contrast to public law, which governs our interactions as patients of the welfare state or as citizens of a democracy. This seemingly banal definition highlights both private law’s relational form and its normative value. In this Article we develop a distinctly liberal conception of private law, founded on the commitments to individual self-determination and substantive equality. We demonstrate that this conception indeed accounts for much of pri­vate law as we know it. To be sure, private law does not always uphold these values in full. In certain spheres of human interaction, it undersup­plies such frameworks; in others, it fails to meet the demands of just rela­tionships. But these flaws, rather than undermining our theory of private law, highlight its significance as a source of internal critique that can push private law to live up to its implicit normative promise of securing just relationships: relationships of reciprocal respect to people’s self-deter­mination and substantive equality.\n\nOur conception of private law stands in contrast to two broad, competing conceptions. The traditional view—shared by libertarians, modern Kantians and Hegelians, and liberal egalitarians—understands private law as a realm of prepolitical or apolitical interactions. These traditionalists conceptualize private law as that part of our law that is re­sistant to demanding interpersonal claims. To be sure, the traditionalist schools diverge on the question of whether public law should be guided by a commitment to people’s self-determination and their substantive equality (or not, as libertarians advocate). They all agree, however, that such commitments should not affect private law. Instead, they argue that private law should be guided by individual independence rather than by individual self-determination and that it should adhere to formal rather than substantive equality.\n\nThe traditional view has been subject to harsh and relentless criti­cism from many quarters—from Marxists and legal realists to critical legal scholars, feminist legal scholars, and lawyer-economists. These critics differ in many of their convictions, but they raise a shared opposition to recognizing the very existence of a distinction between private law and public law. They point out that private law has certain distributive effects and inevitably relies on public value choices. More­over, they argue that adhering to the public–private distinction tends to obscure certain regres­sive or otherwise oppressive features of private law and thereby shields it from scrutiny. Indeed, many critics conclude that private law should be treated as just one form of regulation, indistin­guishable from other regulatory regimes in both ends and means. Any conceivable distinction between private law and public law, they argue, is entirely con­tingent, deriving at best from their distinctive instru­mental characteristics.\n\nOur approach, like the critique of the traditional view, resists at­tempts to naturalize and depoliticize private law. Private law does rely on public choices that run counter to the traditionalists’ liberal division-of-labor arguments. Yet we reject the critics’ reductionist account of private law, which ignores or marginalizes its noncollectivistic intrinsic value—the value of just relationships. Since private law is the law of our horizon­tal interactions, its roles cannot be properly performed by any other legal field. Only private law can forge and sustain the variety of frameworks for interdependent interpersonal relationships that allow us to form and lead the conception of our lives. Only private law can cast these frame­works of relationships as interactions between free and equal individuals who respect each other for the persons they actually are and thereby vindicate our claims to relational justice from one another. In sum, while the traditional account of private law as the law of independence and formal equality certainly warrants descriptive, conceptual, and normative criticism, the critics’ obliteration of its unique horizontal nature is no less unsupportable.\n\nTo anticipate one takeaway of our approach, consider the issue of housing discrimination. Securing equal opportunity in the housing mar­ket is indisputably a desirable legal end for society. But do landowners bear any freestanding responsibility on this front? Both traditionalists and critics imply that the answer is no: For both groups, the current prohibition on excluding buyers or renters on the basis of race (or some other immutable characteristic) is contingent in that it depends upon the availability of other state-driven means for securing fair equality of opportunity for discriminated groups and ensuring that residential areas are sufficiently integrative. Our approach demonstrates that this view must be wrong.\n\nThe purpose of this Article is to break the impasse between the tradi­tionalists and their critics with a novel conception of private law, one that offers a charitable understanding of its distinctiveness. Part I fleshes out the competing understandings of private law that dominate the current discourse. Against the theoretical deadlock they have generated, we clar­ify the decidedly nonlibertarian values ingrained in private law properly conceived. The crux of our approach, developed in Part II, is a recons­truction of the public–private distinction that recognizes the significance of our interpersonal relationships and thus captures the irre­ducible core of both the form and content of private law. Our account does not eliminate all public concerns from private law; rather, it refines the interpersonal concerns standing at the moral center of private law. We do not claim that there is an intrinsic value in the separation of pri­vate law from public law; rather, we claim that there is an intrinsic value in private law itself, one worth retaining. By the same token, our theory does not ignore the traditionalists’ emphasis on independence and formal equal­ity; rather, we properly construe those values as subordinate to self-determination and substantive equality, the normative commitments that animate private law. Finally, our approach disconnects the misleading association between private law and adjudication by distinguishing be­tween private law’s core feature—structuring just interpersonal interac­tions—and the contingent institutional means of its vindication. This conclusion is particularly important for contemporary private law given the institutional limitations of the judiciary in our increasingly complex, interconnected environment.\n\nThis nuanced approach makes the task of translating our normative theory into legal doctrine far from straightforward. But none of these complexities undermine the theory’s significance. To the contrary, a co­herent theory of just relationships, premised on individual self-determination and substantive equality, is more loyal to private law as we know it than any other competing account is. Indeed, traditionalists and critics (including lawyer-economists) alike fail to explain certain fundamental features of private law, the law of just relationships.\n\nOther lessons of our theory of just relationships go beyond the explanatory plane. We challenge traditionalists who seek refuge in (their constructed version of) the common law from some of the real chal­lenges facing the law governing our interpersonal interactions in crucial contexts like housing and the workplace. We also upset the troubling scholarly schism regarding regulatory schemes that govern interpersonal relationships, such as the law of workers’ compensation. The traditional­ists oust these schemes from their purview entirely, while the critics are not careful to ensure that they are relationally just. Finally, focusing on private law’s commitment to the ideal of just relationships is important not only when it elucidates and reaffirms existing doctrine but also when it demonstrates its failings. Thus, for example, we show that the prevalent doctrine that renders racially restrictive covenants unenforceable fails (notwithstanding its many virtues) to appreciate their most troubling fea­ture, which should on its own render them invalid. We also allude to the overly hesitant approach of contemporary private law toward affirmative interpersonal duties and thus anticipate some reform once released from its traditional libertarian conception.\n\nI. A Misleading Dichotomy\n\nThe traditional conception of private law and the prevailing criti­cism of that conception implicitly share common ground. Both express dissatisfaction with the straightforward, seemingly banal understanding of the public–private distinction—namely, that public law “is the law that pertains to government . . . or to the vertical relation between the govern­ment and individuals,” while private law regulates horizontal dealings among the private parties subject to that political authority. The tradi­tional approach finds this characterization of private law morally vacu­ous; after all, it implies that “even the Soviet Union had a private law.” Accordingly, traditionalists instill into private law values that dissociate it entirely from politics (broadly defined)—namely, from any “common ends” or “member obligations.” By contrast, the critics warn of the in­sidious risks of thus entrenching a libertarian private law. Moreover, because they agree that a law of interpersonal interactions cannot stand for any particular moral value, critics tend to renounce the public–private distinction altogether and instead conceptualize private law as a set of regulatory strategies with no (even potentially) unique moral significance.\n\nA. The Traditional Conception: Private Law as a Locus of Formal Freedom and Equality\n\nWithin the broader traditionalist camp, libertarians construe private law as a prepolitical order. On this conception, private law is typified as a regime of strong property rights that both sets the boundaries of pro­tected domains and establishes strict rules for identifying valid transfer of entitlements. This is unsurprising; such an understanding of private law—as governed by the ideal of people relating as formally free and equal persons—is foundational to the libertarian project. Libertarians typically conceptualize private law entitlements as the prepolitical base­lines for our social contract and, therefore, the bounds of its legitimate demands. Hence, the three principles, which Robert Nozick famously asserted as the only principles the legal regime in its entirety should up­hold, correspond roughly to the three main branches of private law: the principle of acquisition of holdings (property), the principle of transfer of holdings (contract), and the principle of rectification of violations of the first two principles (tort).\n\nMore interesting, however, is the liberal-egalitarian canonical posi­tion. Liberals denounce the libertarian minimal state while endorsing—based on the traditional public–private distinction—a libertarian concep­tion of private law. Liberals insist that justice requires that the state go beyond the libertarian normative commitments to independence (i.e., negative liberty) and formal equality. But they assign to the state the sole responsibility for any additional positive obligations to facilitate individ­ual self-determination and ensure substantive equality. As such, liberals impose limited (if any) responsibility on individuals to engage with other individuals on terms that exceed formal equality and freedom. This idea of an institutional division of labor is the conventional foundation of the public–private distinction.\n\nA well-ingrained notion in liberal-egalitarian thought is that the state’s responsibility to ensure fair equality of opportunity is sufficient for realizing substantive equality and freedom. John Rawls, for example, argues that whereas state institutions, such as the tax system, enforce rules of distribution, private law institutions are supposed “to leave individuals and associations free to act effectively in pursuit of their ends and without excessive constraints . . . secure in the knowledge that else­where in the social system the necessary corrections to preserve back­ground justice are being made.” Ronald Dworkin similarly observes that equality is the sovereign’s virtue and that individuals do not have a “gen­eral duty to treat all other members of [their] community with equal care and concern.” He then compares the liberal-egalitarian and libertarian conceptions of equality, concluding that “[t]hough these two theories are very different from each other,” they are similar insofar as they do not apply the basic ideal of equality—that is, substantive equality—to the conduct of private individuals.\n\nThus, orthodox contemporary liberal political philosophy sees a convergence between the institutional division of labor and the moral division of labor. The most sophisticated and extensive articulation of this idea is in recent elaborations of Immanuel Kant’s conception of pri­vate law. Although many details of the Kantian account are controver­sial, its core understanding of private law as a locus of personal independence and formal equality nicely echoes the mainstream liberal position—including that taken by liberal private law theorists —and thus illustrates well its implications.\n\nKant’s theory of private law builds exclusively on one underlying ideal: freedom cast negatively in terms of “independence from being constrained by another’s choice.” Independence implies that “each person is enti­tled to be his or her own master . . . in the contrastive sense of not being subordinated to the choice of any other particular person.” Accord­ingly, independence requires that no one gets to tell you what purposes to pursue and is therefore “not compromised if others decline to accom­modate you.” Quite the contrary: “Because the fair terms of a bilateral interaction cannot be set on a unilateral basis, considerations whose justificatory force extends only to one party are inadmissible.” The principle of independence and accordingly, the requirement that the terms of people’s interactions manifest the formal equal independence of each interacting party underlie modern Kantian accounts of the three building blocks of private law: property, contracts, and torts.\n\nProperty. The Kantian principle of independence seeks to explain why property rights ought to be protected from external interference in the same manner as life and limb. The starting point of the explanation is the contention that there is no freedom-based justification for denying independent persons the possibility of exploiting external objects that are not already being effectively used (or controlled) by another. If peo­ple are to be allowed “to exercise their freedom by controlling external objects of choice,” these objects must be subject to the sole discretion of the choosing party, so that all others are bound by the proprietor’s unilateral will.\n\nContract. Contractual consent also “gets its significance against the background of the basic [Kantian] right to independence that private persons have against each other.” Contracts “enable free persons to exercise self-mastery together” and to “set and pursue their own pur­poses interdependently.” For A to gain access to B’s property, have an entitlement to B’s services, or enter into a joint venture with B, both A and B must use their “respective moral powers”; anything short of such a “united will” amounts to an attempt by A to convert B’s person or prop­erty into merely A’s own means. Only by contract can B grant A “powers over [her] person and property in a way that is consistent with [her] exclusive power to determine how they will be used.”\n\nTort. The same thin and formal conception of the person as a free and equal agent guides modern Kantians’ accounts of torts. Given the formally equal importance of each party’s independence, the terms of such interactions must be objectively set so as to preclude taking into ac­count the idiosyncrasies of the person whose conduct is being assessed. Incorporating such subjective considerations into the terms of an involuntary interaction would give one party to the interaction the stand­ing to determine these terms unilaterally, which would be in violation of formal equal freedom.\n\nFor Kantians, the interpersonal respect we owe one another as free and equal persons means respecting each other’s abstract personalities. The “particular features—desires, endowments, circumstances, and so on—that might distinguish one agent from another” are “irrelevan[t].” The private individual is free by virtue of her capacity to set and pursue ends by deploying her person and property without being subordinated to others’ choices. Private individuals, moreover, are equal by virtue of having this capacity. They are thus “purposive beings who are not under duties to act for any purposes in particular, no matter how meritorious”; as such, they are subject to “a system of negative duties of non-interfer­ence with the rights of others”—namely, private law.\n\nSome modern Kantians argue that this understanding of private law is “juridical,” in that it “concerns itself only with values that reflect the distinctive nature of justification of private law.” But as Alan Brudner, a modern Hegelian, claims, the presentation of this view of private law as a logical necessity—a “mode of ordering ‘implicit’ in transactions”—fails because the law is not in fact “analytically determined” and the resort to the traditional understanding of private law is “morally contestable.” Furthermore, an argument from logical necessity sets an extremely high bar: There must be no possibility of any other coherent understanding of private law than as the law of interpersonal interactions among for­mally free and equal persons. Perhaps this requirement can be met in theory, but modern Kantians have yet to produce the required argu­ment. Consequently, in order to justify such a libertarian private law, which presupposes “dissociated persons,” Brudner, like other modern liberals, returns to the traditional moral division of labor. Under this idea, the law governing our interpersonal relationships can, and thus should, uphold our independence by prescribing only “duties not to trans­gress personal boundaries” and relying on people’s public law rights—to which “the commonality” is accountable—to secure our “posi­tive right to the conditions of self-determination.”\n\nB. The Critical Account: Private Law as the Continuation of Public Law by Other Means\n\nOver the past century, legal realists, critical legal scholars, feminists, and lawyer-economists have attacked the traditional account of private law and the corresponding public–private distinction. Read in their best light, these attacks correctly put forth two propositions: that this depic­tion of private law is neither inevitable nor apolitical and that at least some of its implications are normatively indefensible. We agree with these propositions. Some critics, however, go too far, adding to these claims more speculative contentions that amount to a dismissal of any possible distinction between private law and public law. This has the effect of abrogating any possible unique normative significance to private law as the law of interpersonal interactions. In so doing, these critics im­properly reduce private law to simply another form of allocation and regulation, indistinguishable from other regulatory regimes.\n\nLegal realists and critical legal scholars direct much of their criticism at the traditionalists’ legal conceptions of property and contract. Because private law structures our daily interactions and thus tends to blend into our natural environment, the traditional discourse tends to “thingify” (or reify) its own contingent choices. This, in turn, causes people to perceive these choices as necessary (or at least, neutral and acceptable). These critics show, further, that the traditional conception of private law as the realm of independence and formal equality is neither obvious nor incon­trovertible. Moreover, because the traditional understanding often turns out to serve “entrenched interests,” these critics insist that, like public law, private law should be subject to a distributive analysis. Thus, since private property is not only “dominion over things” but “also impe­rium over our fellow human beings,” the law must address “the extent of the power over the life of others which the legal order confers on those called owners.” Traditional private law discourse impedes such an in­quiry by obscuring the distributive effects of law. It thereby also safe­guards the status quo from scrutiny and could even serve “to perpetuate class prejudices and uncritical assumptions which could not survive the sunlight of free ethical controversy.”\n\nFeminist scholars similarly criticize the implications of the tradi­tional private law understanding of doctrines relating to the family. They underscore the contingency of the patriarchal family as well as the indis­pensable role of law in constructing this particular form of domestic rela­tions. Thus, they expose the flaws of traditional family law: In classifying the patriarchal family as “private” or “personal,” traditional family law adopts an extreme noninterference policy that obscures and perpetuates its injustice by shielding abuses—such as exploitation and battery of family members—from legal scrutiny. Finally, feminists insist that domestic arrangements need to be publicly reviewed and that they, like any other part of private law, are appropriate subjects for theories of political and social justice.\n\nCritics from each of these groups often take their arguments one step further with stronger—indeed, excessive—claims disputing the potential value of any possible alternative understanding of private law. They assert that “the division of law into public and private realms” is arbitrary and that all categories of private law are “delegation[s] of public power that [can] be justified only by public purposes.” Private law, on this view, is “public law in dis­guise.” Furthermore, “the theoretical distinction between public and private” is considered a legitimating device that “gives credence to the assumption that private activity is in fact purely private, so that the exer­cise of private power does not appear to be publicly sanctioned oppression.” This is why these critics celebrate the “decline of the pub­lic/private distinction” and see the “explo[sion] [of] the private” as the prerequisite for “new possibilities for human contact.”\n\nThe call to discard the public–private distinction implies that the division of labor between private law and public law is purely conven­tional and that at best it is a matter of institutional design based solely on the comparative advantages of the relevant regulatory devices. This posi­tion is currently most closely associated with the economic analysis of law, which in many other contexts is usually viewed as the nemesis of critical theory. As one scholar notes, “law and economics theorists deny the significance of a principled distinction between public law and pri­vate law” and tend to be indifferent toward—and at times even impatient with—theoretical efforts to establish such a differentiation. Their basic view is that “[t]here is work to be done and it ought to be done in the best possible way,” with the choice between private or public agents (or private or public law) a “pragmatic” one that “depends on a comparison between the expected efficacy” of these possible agents “in performing the job.”\n\nTo be sure, some of the economic analyses can be read as grounded in a commitment to autonomy (as self-determination) and thus may fit one of the two pillars of our own conception of private law—namely, sub­stantive freedom (the other being substantive equality). But autonomy is at best implicit in these analyses, while the explicit commitment of eco­nomic analysis is to maximizing aggregate welfare. This commitment necessarily generates an extreme instrumentalist approach to private law, and thus it should not be surprising that lawyer-economists tend to dis­miss the public–private distinction.\n\nWhereas lawyer-economists seem content with such an undifferenti­ated legal domain, more critically oriented scholars tend to recognize both the troubling effects of the possible effacement of the public–private distinction and the resilient persistence of private law as a distinc­tive legal category. As Ruth Gavison asserts, the feminist ideal is most certainly “not a state of affairs in which nothing is private.” Rather, feminists sometimes advocate changes “in the public/private mix,” given “the belief that women deserve more of . . . [the values of the private] than they presently receive.” Similarly, in one of the canonical articula­tions of the critical legal studies critique of the public–private distinction, Alan Freeman and Elizabeth Mensch maintain that “one cannot dispute, and one should not demean, the liberating force” of these private law values. But because they conceptualize “the basic model” of private law as one of “the exclusion of others” and the “affirmation of our alienated distance from one another,” they add that “[t]he dilemma is the extent to which what generates a moment of liberation soon serves to replicate, by use of the very same arguments, the world we are trying to change.”\n\nII. The Justice of Private Law\n\nThese last observations help explain the contemporary theoretical deadlock as well as recent calls for a fresh new start. Both the traditional and critical approaches understand the value of private law in similar terms: namely, as the practical expression of formal freedom and equality. But as established in Part I, they have opposite responses to this value, with the traditionalists endorsing and the critics denouncing or ignoring.\n\nThis understanding of private law is neither self-evident nor inevita­ble. Rather than idling in debate over the virtues and vices of the traditionalist conception of private law, we reconceive private law in a way that both is truer to democratic society’s liberal normative commitments and as it turns out, better accounts for much of our existing law. Our ac­count illuminates the irreducible value of private law in both form and substance, elaborating on the powerful intuition that private law ad­dresses our interpersonal relationships as private individuals rather than as citizens of a democracy or patients of the welfare state’s regulatory scheme. It also puts to rest the misguided identification of private law with adjudication. In this Part, we elaborate the justice of private law—its underlying ideal of just relationships—and explore some of the implications of the reconstructed public–private distinctions it implies.\n\nA. The Relational Form of Private Law\n\nPrivate law addresses our interpersonal interactions by marshaling rights and obligations that take a relational form. This is, of course, mysterious from the standpoint of lawyer-economists and other critics, who see private law as just another means to serve our public goals. Yet private law does not deal with the parties to an interaction, taken sever­ally, but rather with the terms of their engagement with each other. It addresses, in other words, the rights and duties they bear in relation to one another as well as the frameworks of interpersonal interaction they sustain. A right to property, for example, corresponds with a duty against committing trespass. It is a duty owed to the right holder in particular rather than to the entire universe of property-right holders. This duty is owned by the right holder in the sense that it is an upshot of her basic Hohfeldian power to decide, within the limits set by the law of property, whether or not to seek its realization against those who are deemed liable to such power. Similarly, the contractual obligation to keep one’s prom­ise is owed directly to the promisee, who, in turn, exercises an important measure of control over its fulfillment. Tort law, too, applies a relational form of rights and duties. A duty of care, for example, is not owed to the world at large but rather carves out a class of potential victims whose relationship with, and proximity to, an injurer justifies the imposition of a relational duty.\n\n(Private law’s relational form raises the question of how to distin­guish it from criminal law. This concern would be most relevant to those who conceive it as purely a publicization of the private power to vindicate interpersonal rights. This view, however, detaches criminal law’s vertical enforcement structure from an underlying horizontal substantive right and thereby implies that criminal law should indeed be understood to extend, and even bolster, the force of private law. Under this concep­tion, criminal law justifiably bears a significant resemblance to certain modern regulatory schemes that have partially replaced traditional pri­vate law institutions of adjudication and enforcement. )\n\nPrivate law’s relational form of legal ordering can be used for any number of external good causes, such as increasing overall social welfare. Tort law’s duty of care, for instance, makes society safer, and contract law allows people to further their own personal ends efficiently. But it is our contention that the relational form that characterizes private law also has value in and of itself, quite apart from its contribution to the realization of external goals. This is because private law is premised on people’s en­gagement with one another to achieve the ends they each pursue. To this extent, private law’s rights, obligations, and frameworks structure the pursuit of ends in a relational way. To illustrate, while a contractual prom­ise may enable both promisee and promisor to realize their respective desirable goals, the very manner in which the contractual transaction achieves this is of value, too, for it requires those who utilize it to recog­nize each other as parties to a joint endeavor.\n\nIndeed, private law’s relational form of rights and obligations gener­ally facilitates the realization of certain projects through interpersonal interactions. At times, this interpersonal dimension is precisely the goal of the interaction—joining forces is the crux of projects such as marriage, whose essence is an underlying social interaction. In other con­texts, when enlisting others makes projects more feasible or practical (such as a supply contract for goods), parties engage in transactions for more in­strumental reasons. Different theories offer divergent explanations for the value that (arguably) inheres in private law’s relational form. Some articulate a thin and rather generic account of respectful recognition and more generally, liberal solidarity in various areas of pri­vate law; others emphasize thicker types of private law engagements in particular social contexts. We need not delve into these accounts be­cause our primary concern here is the contents of private law’s relational frameworks. But it is worth mentioning that all these different accounts imply that the distinctive feature of private law is the ideal of interper­sonal relationships it sets up rather than the specific legal mechanisms for addressing deviations from this ideal, be they the familiar one-to-one litigation or otherwise. As usual, law’s core significance lies in its every­day success rather than in its pathological failures.\n\nB. The Normative Contents of Private Law\n\nThe traditional conception of private law (and of the public–private distinction) also emphasizes its relational form. But its content differs dramatically from what we propose. Traditionalists construct an ideal of just terms of interaction around a formal conception of the free and equal person. Under this conception, people are equal in their interpersonal relationships if none is superior or subordinate to another and every person is free as against all others—entitled to set and pursue their own conceptions of the good. Die-hard libertarians subscribe to this position because, for them, independence and formal equality are the only legitimate commitments of law, tout court. Liberal egalitarians, by contrast, take individual self-determination and substantive equality more seriously. They too, however, nonetheless exclude these values (at least in principle) from private law, insisting that the polity’s responsibility to these particular values is purely vertical in direction. They argue that the commitment to individual self-determination and substantive equality does not, and should not, govern people’s horizontal relationships and that so long as people respect one another’s independence and formal equality, they bear no responsibility for one another’s autonomy and need not be concerned with claims to substantive equality.\n\nThe critical account of the public–private distinction discussed above is driven by a profound dissatisfaction with the traditionalists’ ideal of just terms of interaction among private individuals. This dissatisfaction is justified: The traditionalist view of private law disturb­ingly takes off the table the liberal commitment to individual self-determination (and not merely independence) and to substantive equal­ity (and not merely formal equality). Setting aside these canonical liberal values insofar as they concern private law is troubling in light of two aspects of the human condition: our interdependence and our per­sonal differences. If we take the facts of interdependence and personal difference seriously—if we appreciate both the vulnerability and the valuable options to which these social conditions give rise—we must acknowledge that the liberal commitment to individual self-determina­tion and substantive equality cannot be excluded from the law governing horizontal relationships. Our approach, then, adopts liberalism’s most fundamental commitments and should be read as a friendly attempt at amending a contingent, albeit significant, feature of its dominant articulations.\n\nTo be sure, the implications of the commitment to the core liberal values of self-determination and substantive equality differ between the private and the public sphere. The source of this difference lies in the varying capacities in which people operate in private law and public law; simply put, our interactions as private individuals are of a different na­ture than our interactions as citizens. Our private obligations are shaped by reference to the particular interpersonal practices involved; they are unencumbered, at least in principle, by the (potentially more demanding) public obligations of cocitizenship. This qualitative differ­ence is well reflected in the parochial scope of our lawmaking practices among members of a political community, on the one hand, and the po­tentially universal scope of our interpersonal practices among persons, on the other.\n\nThis section refines and defends the ideal of just relationships prem­ised on reciprocal respect to self-determination and substantive equality. It also explains both the indispensable role of law in instantiating this ideal and the limits thereof.\n\n1. On Interdependence and Personal Difference. — Our practical affairs are deeply interdependent, replete with interactions with others that range from the trivial, such as purchasing a coffee at a café, to the most valuable and intimate, such as those connected to family, friends, and work. These interactions can take either voluntary or involuntary forms: We invite, or are invited by, others to engage in joint projects. Those same projects often render vulnerable, or otherwise interfere with, the legitimate interests of other people, especially those who are outside the privity of the joint enterprise. The ability to successfully lead one’s life—and to relate to others as equals—is influenced at almost every turn by both of these types of interaction.\n\nThis fact of interdependence does not and need not affect the way libertarians understand private law. If independence (negative liberty) exhausts the requirements of freedom, the fact of interdependence only makes more imperative the requirement that private law vindicate per­sonal independence. But liberal egalitarians contest this decidedly thin understanding of freedom. They insist that an individual person is free not merely in the formal sense of not being subordinated to the choices of another but also in the more robust sense of being able to make mean­ingful choices about the direction of her life. In the formal sense, a person can be “free” simply because no one else is in a position of domi­nance over her. But this conception neglects concerns for the effective realization of that person’s ability to form and pursue her own concep­tion of the good. Rather, self-determination is necessary for people to lead the fully human life to which they are entitled. While this requires a measure of independence, it “is not something automatically guaranteed by a structure of negative rights.” Therefore, if a just relationship requires reciprocal respect of each party’s claim to self-determination, re­lational justice cannot be exhausted by the negative duty of non­interference; it may, at times, require some affirmative interpersonal accommodation that takes account of certain personal circumstances or choices.\n\nThe traditional public–private distinction fails to sufficiently account for the role private law plays in constituting, facilitating, and authorizing such interdependent interactions. (These roles are vividly demonstrated, for example, in the common law rules that help solve collective action problems or oblige recipients of mistaken payments to reverse mistakes for which they have no responsibility. ) This failure reflects—and in­deed perpetuates—an undervaluation of the significance of our interper­sonal relationships to our conceptions of the good life. These errors are troublesome even in societies with just public law arrangements—in which all citizens have adequate opportunities to realize their full free­dom in their private lives. Our interdependence implies that our horizontal interactions are too significant to our autonomy and social equality to be so easily supplanted by vertical arrangements, however just they may be.\n\nFurther, the significance of interpersonal and interdependent en­gagements also implies that the substantive terms of the interactions themselves should be evaluated as just or unjust. Here too the traditional conception disappoints. Notwithstanding the fact of personal differ­ence—we all constitute our own distinctive personhoods on the back­ground of our unique circumstances—the traditional conception replaces a concern for people as real individuals relating to one another as free and equal agents with a concern for people as abstract beings. By assigning sole responsibility to address our personal differences to public law, traditionalists implicitly dismiss any demands private individuals may make on one another as a matter of relational justice.\n\nSuch an underestimation of this horizontal dimension of justice is deeply problematic. For persons to relate to one another as equals, the terms of their interaction must not reflect significantly unequal power or advantage of one party over the other. To meet this demand, the terms of private law interactions must reference the participants’ relevant per­sonal qualities, including their distinctive characteristics and circum­stances. Consider, for example, the tort law requirement that potential injurers accommodate the relevant constitutive features of their victims or the property and contract law rules regarding residential and work­place accommodation. Only if the structure of the parties’ terms of interaction is predicated on the conception of the person as a substan­tively, not merely formally, free and equal agent can it guarantee a more-or-less fair relational starting point from which both parties can realize their respective freedoms. Therefore, to count as just relationships, the terms of the interaction must be determined with regard to the parties’ choices and circumstances to the extent that those choices and circum­stances are crucial to the ability of the parties to relate as equal and self-determining individuals given the persons they actually are. This prescription implies precisely the kind of accommodative structure that the traditionalists’ commit­ment to formal freedom and equality precludes.\n\nIndeed, the respect that interacting parties are required to accord to one another should relate to more than merely their generic human capacity for choice. To be sure, a world that renders any specific accommodation redundant—say, with a certain technological improve­ment or through a reshuffling of a given social practice without undermining the good underlying that practice—would be an improve­ment over a world that requires such an accommodation. Yet while inter­personal respect does not require overemphasizing personal differences, there is a qualitative distinction between entirely eliminating the impact of a certain personal characteristic on a person’s life and merely ameliorating its practical effects through government action.\n\n2. The Conception of the Person of Private Law. — Our emerging no­tion of accommodative terms of interaction raises the question of what features of the human condition are included in a thicker conception of the person. So far we have described what this conception is not: It does not reduce the person to an abstract bearer of generic personality. But what does it consist of affirmatively? To answer this question, it is im­portant to distinguish between two facets in the explication of our account of substantive equality and freedom.\n\nThe first facet consists of the notion that equality in this context is a relational ideal: It focuses on the parties’ equal standing with respect to determining the terms of their interaction. Equality, here, is relational not merely in the form that it takes; it is not merely about duties that per­sons formally owe to certain others. Rather, the relational ideal at the core of private law stands for the normative commitment underlying these duties. In particular, it picks out a commitment to the value of be­ing with others in relations of respectful recognition. This commitment places constraints on the class of conceptions of the good and other personal choices that may require interpersonal accommodation. Not all choices can be the object of interpersonal respect among free and equal persons: Some personal choices, policies, and conceptions of the good deny certain others the very standing to relate to the deniers as equals—the animating ambition of both the murderer and the racist, for example, is the repudiation of their victims’ equal standing. In short, choices that are inimical to the ideal of relational equality cannot lay a compelling claim as plausible candidates for interpersonal accommodation.\n\nThe second facet—which renders more determinate our conception of the person as substantively free and equal—takes up the question of what features of the person’s situation should count for the purpose of being respected by others as the person she really is. For the sake of exposition, consider the distinction between choice and circumstance. Circumstances are strictly construed as encompassing only the immutable features of a person’s situation, such as race, sex, and disabil­ity. Thus, to facilitate respect for a person as substantively free and equal, just terms of interaction cannot allow the full costs of possessing such a feature to be borne by its possessor. Typically, circumstances that gener­ate disrespect for a person’s equal standing are related to traits that have been publicly branded as inferior, something reflected by the suspect classes enumerated in antidiscrimination laws. In principle, however, the demands of relational justice do not depend on such a public perception of inferiority.\n\nChoices, by contrast, consist in a more complex category of personal features. Relevant choices—those that are not inimical to the ideal of relational equality—can be placed on a spectrum based on their relative contribution to self-determination. At one extreme are “ground pro­jects,” or the choices that reflect the commitments that make us who we are. Ground projects—especially religious, ethical, professional, and familial commitments—are fundamental to the meaning of a life. At the other extreme are choices that reflect preferences as to the realiza­tion of superficial ends, whose frustration bears very little, if at all, on one’s conception of the self. In between these poles, there are choices that involve commitments that, although valuable, do not shape the over­arching meaning of one’s life and therefore might not contribute toward defining one’s identity.\n\nSketching the contours of each of these categories of choice requires an elaborate theory of autonomy and an account as to what choices make a person’s life go well. For our purposes, the conception of “person” must encompass the first-category choices—ground projects—that consti­tute an individual’s self, the person one actually is. Conversely, third-category choices—mere preferences—do not have a strong claim to accommodation, and thus their costs should be fully internalized by the person who has made the choice. One familiar example is that of a plain­tiff whose choice of activity exhibits risk-preferring attitudes. The tort doctrine of assumption of risk properly absolves defendants from the duty to accommodate risky choices made by risk-preferring plaintiffs.\n\nIt is less clear whether accommodation duties must also apply to choices of second-category (intermediate) choices. The requirement to respect others on their own terms justifies integrating such choices in the thicker conception of the person. Nonetheless, because these choices have a less profound impact on the chooser’s self-determination, private law can (and probably should) insist on the chooser’s responsibility to moderate her demand to have her second-category choice accommo­dated by those with whom she interacts. To illustrate, the just terms of interaction between an employer and employee could entail that the for­mer should reasonably accommodate the latter’s absence from work due to important familial or religious commitments. Yet the same rationale does not apply for an employee who is, for example, unavailable for work on certain days because of her interest in watching migratory birds pass­ing through; these kinds of leisure activities are clearly not first-category, ground-projects choices, and as such the employer bears no responsibil­ity to accommodate.\n\n3. Toward a Novel Approach to the Problem of Poverty in Private Law Theory. — By reclaiming a thicker conception of the person for private law, our account provides a novel approach to the problem of economic inequality in private law theory. Typically, private law theorists defend the legitimacy of private law in two contrasting ways. Some argue that private law can and should be arranged to promote distributive justice, in which case private law joins tax law’s effort to bring about justice in holdings. Others—private law libertarians—argue that private law must express principled indifference for considerations of economic inequalities, in which case public law alone is expected to do all the heavy lifting.\n\nOn our account, by contrast, the problem of poverty in and around private law is not merely one of distributive justice. It is, instead, a prob­lem of relational justice. The question is not, then, whether to enlist the machinery of private law to promote justice in holdings across society but whether some instantiations of economic disparities ought to be taken into account when fixing just terms of interactions between individual persons even when thus fixing cannot come close to a scheme of system­atic redistribution of resources.\n\nSo the question is whether one’s low economic status can count as one of the personal traits whose existence calls for some measure of ac­commodation by others. While we recognize the possible existence of countervailing considerations—ascertaining one’s economic status can often be either overly intrusive or prohibitively costly, or both—we think that in principle the answer is in the affirmative. Indeed, at times, poverty or an immensely inferior economic starting point may come close to an immutable feature of a person’s situation, as when it is a surface manifestation of some disability or the upshot of an unusually poor back­ground (with very little opportunity to escape such a predicament). At other times, economic hardship that could warrant accommodation may arise from a person’s choice to follow a Franciscan-like conception of the good. In these and similar cases, accommodating one’s poor economic situation is an expression of respect for a person on her own terms.\n\n4. The Role of Law and the Limits of Interpersonal Accommodation. — Even friendly readers who find our account of relational justice among private individuals attractive may raise significant concerns: Are legal du­ties properly suited for expressing the ideal of just relationships? And are not such duties too intrusive on the autonomy of other persons? We ad­dress these questions to clarify the scope and limits of the requirements of interpersonal accommodation.\n\nConsider first how legal norms in a liberal society interact with hu­man agency. Legal duties of accommodation purport to provide duty holders with mandatory reasons for action—in other words, a justifica­tion for why it is necessary to act in a certain way. This implies that a critical distance exists between the normative grounds of a given reason and the motivation for conforming to its demands. The former cannot actually produce the latter; it can only influence persons to acquire it. This gap between reason and motivation is particularly important within the domain of legality. Typically, the law only compels persons to act in conformity with a demand rather than because of a particular reason. Yet the morality of laws adhering to the ideal of just relationships turns not on the actual motivations of duty holders but on their having reason to act in a way that is respectful of others.\n\nThese observations help explain why the responsibility for uphold­ing just horizontal relationships requires a legal apparatus and cannot be fully delegated to social norms. To be sure, social norms may suffice inso­far as they respond to the dictates of just relationships and are taken to have an obligatory nature so that they in fact govern people’s interper­sonal relationships. But this is only because they would then be law-like. If, however, this is not the case—which is likely given our contemporary social environment—relying on social norms amounts, at best, to an indi­rect and opaque endorsement of private law libertarianism. This is deeply problematic because it would threaten the liberal state’s commit­ment to individual self-determination and substantive equality. There is, therefore, a clear role for law in upholding and promoting just relationships.\n\nWe recognize that law’s prescriptive effects are not limitless. In cer­tain cases, for example, legal intervention might backfire by crowding out internal motivations. But notwithstanding these kinds of excep­tions, incorporating interpersonal obligations into the law does not necessarily undermine their moral value. By the same token, although interpersonal practices diverge—some arise independently of political authority, others are the unique creations of such authority, and still oth­ers occupy an intermediate category involving some degree of legal facilitation—private law can be deeply involved in setting out the terms of interaction among those engaging in the vast domain of interpersonal practice. Therefore, the responsibility for upholding just horizontal relationships cannot be fully delegated to social norms.\n\nGiven that law must play this irreducible role, we now turn to the limited scope of the legal application of relational justice. We identify three important limits here. First, some limits emerge from the nature of legal prescriptions. For example, activities that turn on authenticity and sincerity, such as romantic love or friendship, should lie beyond the reach of the law; treating them as mandatory reasons for action neces­sarily destroys their inherent value. Second, other limits of the legal application of relational justice come from the rule-of-law maxim of providing effective guidance to law’s addressees and thus also constrain­ing officials’ ability to exercise power. This maxim helps defuse the po­tentially intrusive and demanding aspects of accommodation by setting out clear categories and doctrines with which individuals can adequately discharge their duties, on the one hand, while allowing them to exercise their rights of accommodation, on the other. These rule-of-law tech­niques create an intersubjective frame of reasoning that is capable of guiding participants’ deliberation and behavior by minimizing resort to individualized knowledge and radically ad hoc judgments.\n\nThird and finally, there are limitations on the scope of relational jus­tice that derive from within this ideal itself. The duty of accommodation is not an all-encompassing requirement to accommodate each and every person in each and every area of their practical affairs. Rather, the duty typically establishes fair terms of interaction in and around one sphere of action; it applies to a particular context or event and with respect to one person (or class of persons) at a time. In the contexts of negligence law and workplace accommodation law, for example, limits to accommoda­tion derive directly from the just-relationships ideal. This is because a duty of accommodation grounded in relational justice is a range prop­erty : People, as noted, cannot be legitimately required to accommo­date choices that repudiate the status of others as free and equal per­sons. This seemingly minimal constraint also implies that the burden to perform an interpersonal duty cannot be excessive because it must neither undermine the autonomy of either party involved nor create interpersonal subordination between the parties. This requirement, which limits the extent of accommodative duties, does not guarantee the degree of independence that a private-law-libertarian regime would secure. But this is justified because ensuring the independence of one party in these cases implies that the other party to the interaction would be denied both the equal power to determine the terms of interactions and the substantive freedom to act as a self-determining agent.\n\nC. The Complexities of the Public–Private Distinction\n\nPrivate law does not, and should not, govern the entirety of our so­cial life, but it is hard to deny its prominence in that sphere. Private law plays an integral role in some of our most important social contexts, from family and community to work and commerce. Our account—that of relational justice—appreciates both the significance of horizontal interactions and the impact of private law in shaping those relations. By rejecting critics’ wholesale dismissal of the distinctiveness of private law as a deeply troubling collectivization of the social dimension of life, rela­tional justice captures the rich normative implications that lie beneath the straightforward understanding of private law as the law governing our interpersonal relationships. Our approach underscores the signif­icant role of private law in structuring relations between people as free and equal individuals who are expected to respect one another as the persons they actually are. It highlights, in other words, the intrinsic value of private law, which lies in its minimal requirements of just relationships. This prescription may seem straightforward, but it is hardly so; several factors complicate the translation of these principles into the nuts and bolts of legal doctrine.\n\nSome of these complexities highlight the risks of unreflective re­nouncement of the traditionalist conception. They may also explain the resilience of the traditional public–private law distinction in liberal cir­cles. Other complicating factors have the reverse effect: They suggest both that respecting self-determination and substantive equality means that private law and public law cannot be mutually exclusive and that the scope of private law and the degree to which its institutions comply with these values are contingent. This could explain the persis­tent suspicion among critics of the public–private distinction toward its rigidification. Their concerns, as well as those of the traditionalists, are valid and important to some extent; however, the traditionalists’ worries do not justify strict adherence to the conventional public–private dis­tinction, while those of their critics cannot justify the dogmatic repu­diation of the distinction. Instead, the complications explored in this section imply and help explain what lawyers already know: Beyond the abstract articulation of the demands of justice, the legal architecture of private law is complex and its relationship with public law is quite intricate.\n\n1. On Formal Equality and Independence. — One complication arises from the roles of formal equality and independence—the values on which the traditional conception of private law focuses. Consider formal equality first. There are contexts in which formal equality is the all-things-considered best proxy for a state of affairs because the participants in these contexts are typically already situated in a relationship of, more or less, substantive equality. This may explain why the legal treatment of commercial contracts by and large conforms to formal equality. Contract theorists use this conformity to support the claim that formal equality is truly the foundational ideal of contracts in this particular context or in general. But this conclusion does not hold.\n\nIndeed, contract law applies any number of doctrines the basic or­ganizing idea of which is to exclude people whose capacities for contract making and contract keeping fall below a certain threshold for par­ticipation. Some of these doctrines take a categorical form—for instance, minors do not possess the legal personality to make an enforceable pro­mise. Other doctrines, such as duress and undue influence, are less rigid but nonetheless manifest hostility toward some transactions based on the concern that one of the parties is not sufficiently competent to make and accept contractual promises. The doctrine that exemplifies this most dramatically is unconscionability, under which contract law ought to protect the vulnerable party—often, the “poor” or the “weak, the fool­ish, and the thoughtless” —if: (1) she could exercise only formal and not “meaningful” choice and (2) the terms of the contract unreasonably favor the other party. All these doctrines—as well as other, more covert means that courts use —aim to reduce the risk that the dis­parities between the parties will prevent the contractual engagement from being between genuinely equally situated agents. These doctrines, in other words, constrain the permitted gap between the commitment to substan­tive equality and the use of formal equality as an imperfect yet adequate proxy.\n\nTo be sure, some or all these doctrines may currently fail to suffi­ciently limit this gap, perhaps due to overrestrictive interpretation by some courts. Yet en if the doctrines are not wholly effective, the struc­tural point remains: Contract law declines to enforce agreements made under circumstances in which formal equality is obviously an inadequate guarantee of substantive fairness. That is, doctrines like incompetency and unconscionability limit the excesses of treating contracting parties as formally equal. They create the doctrinal opening for courts to turn what would otherwise be a freestanding ideal of formal equality into one that is conditional on its (loose) compatibility with substantive equality.\n\nSecond, the value of independence also plays an important role in private law. But independence—unlike formal equality—is not a proxy for the realization of some other value; it is a real, albeit not ultimate, value unto its own. Although a liberal system of private law is ultimately committed to self-determination and not independence, it does not, and should not, dismiss or underrate the value of independence. A responsi­ble liberal account of private law must take seriously Isaiah Berlin’s cau­tionary words against too easily overriding people’s independence “in the name, and on behalf, of their ‘real’ selves” and his accompanying prescription that “some portion of human existence must remain inde­pendent of the sphere of social control.” Indeed, independence must be valued by every decent liberal polity. Yet properly safeguarding peo­ple’s independence while keeping in mind that it is self-determination that justifies (and requires) that independence is challenging. In shaping our private law (and especially in constructing our affirmative duties), we must undertake what H.L.A. Hart described as the “unexciting but indis­pensable chore” of distinguishing “between the gravity of the different restrictions on different specific liberties and their importance for the conduct of a meaningful life.”\n\nThus, an autonomy-based private law system is not reluctant to re­strain the independence of some people when its significance to their self-determination is minimal and upholding that independence could jeopardize their (or others’) self-determination or undermine the substan­tive equality among persons. (A particularly vivid example for this comes in the context of private law rules regarding joint projects. ) But a lib­eral private law would treat people’s independence with greater caution in the absence of strong opposing normative pressure—namely, when there is no threat to self-determination and formal equality roughly approximates substantive equality. Moreover, it would certainly uphold independence when this is crucial for ensuring self-determination.\n\n2. Internal Contextual Factors. — Complicating factors in the transla­tion of the liberal commitment to self-determination and substantive equality into private law doctrine also emerge from contextual considera­tions, both internal and external to the particular social practice at hand. We begin with the internal considerations, which derive from the substantive good (or goods) that the social practice engaged in through the interpersonal interaction is understood to embody or constitute.\n\nBecause every practice is supposed to be rationally conducive to the pursuit of its underlying good(s), each such practice has its own internal logic that is typically informative regarding the specific contents of the relationally just terms of interaction in the particular context. In some cases, this logic could do the fine tuning necessary for turning the ab­stract injunction of just relationships into a workable set of rules. Here, contextual considerations will render intelligible our judgments concern­ing what it is for people to be in relationships of substantive freedom and equality by specifying, for example, the personal qualities that should be determinative in setting the terms of the particular category of interac­tion and how decisive they should be. (The law pertaining to the negli­gent infliction of physical harm will render vivid this point: The relevant qualities are the victim’s physical, mental, and cognitive disabilities, whereas other personal qualities do not warrant accommodation because they are typically irrelevant to our practice of transportation. )\n\nIn other categories of cases, context rules out the possibility of reconciling a particular practice with these liberal commitments, requir­ing that we consider discarding the practice or at least transforming it substantially. In some contexts, the reason will be the repressive nature of a practice: Slavery is an obvious example of a practice indisputably unde­serving of a charitable transformation. But in small-scale instances of flatly illiberal social practices, the option of transformation is often quite attractive.\n\nFinally, in other cases, private law’s commitment to the ideal of just relationships will be inconsistent with the very point of the particular practice (which in itself is grounded on perfectly valid liberal found­ations). This may explain, and even justify, a robust practice of freedom of expression and the privileges it grants to participants to ridicule and even harm others. It may help explain private law’s tolerance of freedom of expression even when it manifests itself in complete disregard of the other’s personal qualities, which is to say their judgments, character traits, and personal circumstances (such as race). Arguably, a structurally similar observation can be made with respect to some of the economic harms generated by moderately regulated economic competition among market participants.\n\n3. External Commitments. — Alongside considerations internal to the practice at hand, external commitments of the liberal state—both normative and pragmatic—may also place constraints on the conception of relational justice in private law. A liberal (as opposed to libertarian) state should be committed to the demands of both distributive justice (which focuses on justice in holdings) and democratic citizenship (which seeks to eradicate hierarchies in our relationships qua citizens). An adequate conception of the public–private distinction must address private law doctrines that may undermine these commitments. To con­tend with such troublesome ramifications, such a conception could apply second-order considerations to adapt the doctrinal framework so that it responds to these concerns, while still meeting the demands of relational justice through private law. One way of achieving this is to restrict individual responsibility by shifting some of the burden onto public law, thereby preventing or limiting the conflict with distributive or democratic commitments. Similar intermediate solutions could be justified for pragmatic reasons, for example, when considerations of efficacy pull toward collectivizing the legal regulation of an essentially horizontal interaction.\n\nMoreover, because there may be some overlap between the public responsibilities to ensure self-determination and substantive equality and the private obligations that our conception of relational justice entails, private law should be wary of diluting public responsibilities. Private law’s commitment to relational justice, in other words, should not be inter­preted as necessarily exhausting or supplanting these public responsibili­ties and the state obligations they entail. This is most acutely so in contexts in which satisfying relational justice in the legal implementation of an interpersonal practice can only be achieved through a private law doctrine constructed on top of a public law regulatory infrastructure (as in the law of consumer transactions). It is also relevant in cases in which the primary responsibility should be private and relational—child sup­port, for example—but fulfilling the parallel public responsibility re­quires that the state assist in enforcing the relational responsibilities or even provide some insurance against noncompliance with them.\n\nYet, as the child support example suggests, there are clear cases in which private law’s terms of interactions should not be enlisted to serve purely public ends. Consider the simple tort duty against committing as­sault and battery. Could it be morally possible to eliminate its relational dimension for the sake of advancing some collectivist end, however desirable it might be? Other features of private law are no less crucial for it to remain the practical domain of relational justice—for example, it is hard to imagine an acceptable legal regime that would eliminate all the normative powers allowing persons to create contractual obligations and control external objects as owners.\n\nLastly, we do not deny that in some contexts a private law framework can be legitimately enlisted to serve irreducibly public values, whereby the state commandeers the support of private individuals to enhance col­lective goals. The incentives set by copyright law and patent law, for example, can (arguably) be understood in terms of delegating society’s collective interest in fostering culture, research, and development to pri­vate individuals and firms. When private bodies are thus publicly en­listed to serve a public role, privatization-or-collectivization debates can properly revolve around considerations of comparative institutional competence. Nonetheless, as long as these public values are promoted through private law doctrines, it is still meaningful, indeed important, to evaluate not merely their (external) regulatory performance but also their (intrinsic) performance: whether they establish, facilitate, and sus­tain the ideal of just relationships.\n\nIII. The Law of Just Relationships\n\nWe are now ready to move from legal theory to legal doctrine. By highlighting the significance of the ideal of just relationships to contemporary private law, we hope to demonstrate what gets lost if the public–private distinction is completely rubbed out or, alternatively, if we accept the traditional conceptualization of private law as a fortress of independence and formal equality. So we turn to four broad areas that exemplify the fact of interdependence and taken together, encompass significant portions of private law.\n\nFor each case study, private law casts (as it should) interpersonal interactions as frameworks of relationships between self-determining individuals who respect each other as the persons they actually are. These case studies show that a private law that adheres to the ideal of just relationships places demands on the conduct of private individuals in particular and that these demands are necessary for people to be in rela­tionships of genuine freedom and equality. Moreover, such demands are not, and certainly need not be, overburdening; it is possible to safeguard against excessive infringements of independence without subscribing to the libertarian freedom-as-independence school of thought.\n\nFinally, the case studies provide opportunities to explore the complexities of the public–private distinction and illustrate how contex­tual considerations refine the incorporation of relational justice into the actual operation of private law. They demonstrate why neither of these complexities justifies discarding the intrinsic value of private law by conceptualizing it either as the “law for persons regarded as ends outside of human association—as morally self-sufficient atoms” (as the traditionalists posit) or as just another garden-variety mode of public regulation (as some critics assert). Although resolving the evaluative questions our account raises requires judgment and entails contextual considerations, this does not strip it of significance. This may alarm formalists, yet for us it is a rather banal truism that reflects the phenome­nology of arguing about law in a particular, detailed context.\n\nA. Accidental Harm to Life and Limb\n\nThe fact of interdependence implies that the possibility of leading a good life requires a sustained effort by society to mitigate the negative side effects of people’s otherwise legitimate pursuit of ends. For instance, going to visit a friend may involve acts, such as driving or crossing the road, that expose oneself and others to accidental but substantial risk of harm—the most prominent type being physical harm (including death). It is not surprising that a—or the—paradigmatic tort in many developed countries since the days of the industrial and automobile revolutions has been the negligent infliction of loss to life and limb. The tort of negli­gence responds to the problem of accidental harm by establishing fair terms of interaction—standards of care—between individuals. These terms respond to several demands, including the preservation of the equal freedom of those involved and the generation of incentives to take cost-justified precautions. What makes this peculiar response particularly challenging is the fact of personal difference, since the actual compe­tency to constrain risky conduct may vary radically across individuals.\n\nTo understand what could count as relationally just terms of interac­tion in these contexts, consider the case of a person with diminished mental capacity who is hit by a car while crossing the street. The victim’s disability can affect the terms of the interaction and ultimately, the resolution of this case in two important ways. First, it can partially deter­mine whether the injurer’s conduct is negligent at all. Any nonarbitrary attempt, for example, at identifying the “reasonable” speed limit presup­poses a prior judgment of what counts as reasonable conduct on the part of a potential victim reacting to an approaching car. In other words, the method of assessing the responding victim’s conduct partially constitutes the contents of the duty of care owed by the potential injurer. Second, the victim’s disability may, under the doctrine of comparative negligence, determine the scope of the liability that can be imposed on a negligent injurer: Excluding the disability as a relevant consideration reduces the injurer’s scope of liability, and vice versa.\n\nEstablishing the terms of interaction between injurers and victims re­quires determining which qualities and circumstances an injurer should accommodate and which should be excluded. Relationally just terms of interaction require that, subject to the existing conventional tort-law thresholds, such as reasonable foreseeability, the duty of care owed by an injurer to a victim be partially set by the latter’s mental or physical capac­ity. The injurer must be held responsible to take extra care—that is, incur additional costs—to protect the mentally disadvantaged person, rather than merely the nondisadvantaged person, from the injurer’s dan­gerous activity. This rule, which current law by and large applies, re­flects the proper understanding of a just relationship characterized by reciprocal respect and equal self-determination.\n\nThis analysis of relational justice challenges the symmetrical treat­ment of the parties under the economic analysis of law, given the qualitative difference between the respective vulnerabilities of victim and injurer and the corresponding significance this difference is accorded in tort law. It also stands in sharp contrast to the requirement in private law’s traditional conception of upholding the parties’ independence and formal equality. This requirement implies an objective standard of due care, one that disallows consideration of the victim’s idiosyncratic charac­teristics (including diminished mental capacity) to unilaterally figure in determining the terms of the parties’ interaction, thus exempting the injurer from attending to her victim’s special circumstances. In so do­ing, the traditional view fails to respect the victim on her own terms—that is, her sensibilities.\n\nTraditionalists who acknowledge the offensiveness of burdening the victim with the entire cost of her own particular circumstances will likely assert that it is entirely the state’s responsibility—through a public law solution such as a national insurance scheme—to rectify the excesses of their conception of private law. Interestingly, critics of the public–pri­vate distinction reach a similar conclusion: For these scholars (especially from the law-and-economics school), the identity of the agent responsi­ble for the necessary accommodation—whether the private injurer or the state—is a matter of institutional design.\n\nIndeed, the key difference between the traditional and critical ap­proaches is that the former dismisses relational justice, whereas the latter renders it wholly contingent. Neither approach, however, takes relational justice seriously. The potential injurer and victim cannot be in a just rela­tionship without allowing the diminished capacity of the victim to have some measure of influence on motorists’ duty to moderate their risky activity when they approach the potential victim. Overlooking the vic­tim’s special makeup and circumstances in determining interpersonal duties in such cases is incompatible with an ideal of relating as genuine equals.\n\nFilling in the contents of the accommodative structure of negligence law raises, of course, concerns beyond the context of diminished mental capacity. There are myriad contexts in which questions arise regarding the appropriate scope and extent of accommodation. The characteristics of the relevant practice help answer some of these questions. Most im­portantly, the personal qualities that should be accommodated by a duty of reasonable care must be connected to the kind of interdependence that brings the injurer and victim together. In this context, the relevant qualities are those associated with both the ability to decide where and when to cross the street and the competency to respond to the surround­ing environment (notably, approaching cars). Physical, mental, and cog­nitive disabilities are the first to come to mind, along with other forms of insufficient ability to adapt oneself to the potential risks of the road. Other personal qualities, by contrast, may not warrant accommodation because they do not reasonably connect to the sort of interdependence relevant to the practice at hand. For instance, it makes no sense to take into account the victim’s political sensibilities or hobbies in setting the contents of the injurer’s duty of care.\n\nMoreover, contextual considerations can constrain the extent of the required accommodation. Inherent in the idea of just relationships is a stopping point to the duty to accommodate the circumstances of the potential injurer. It is self-defeating to convert the injurer into a mere instrument for respecting the victim as a free and equal person. The no­tion of accidental harm implies that the risks created are incidental to the injurer’s pursuits of an otherwise legitimate end and not for the illegitimate purpose of putting others at risk. Accordingly, a requirement to take extraordinary care toward victims like the mentally disadvantaged might adversely affect the injurer’s autonomy to pursue worthwhile ends. Therefore, although an accommodative duty of care should be costly for an injurer to discharge in light of—and in recognition of—the victim’s peculiar sensibilities, it must not be prohibitively so.\n\n***\n\nThere are two points worth considering before proceeding to the next category of cases. First, our analysis, like the traditional approach, presents negligence law as a straightforward expression of the commit­ment to relationally just terms of interaction in the context of accidental harm to life and limb. Contrary to the traditionalists, however, we do not argue that negligence law is essential for this task. Relational justice only requires that the injurer be subject to an obligatory reason to accommo­date, within limits, the person the victim actually is. It follows that compliance with a reason to accommodate can, if necessary, be secured without the support of the adjudicatory and remedial aspects of contemporary negligence law. This conclusion could be particularly significant if these aspects turn out to be flawed in terms of public values, such as distributive justice or social welfare, or even private law values insofar as the existing private law institutions of adjudication fail to re­spond effectively to the increasing demand for dispute resolution.\n\nFor instance, New Zealand famously repudiated most aspects of the traditional tort of negligent infliction of physical harm and created, in­stead, a public insurance scheme subsidized by the general tax coffers. The insurance system presumably promotes distributive justice and according to some studies, attains efficacy. Tort theorists often invoke the New Zealand case as exemplifying a radical transition from a legal order grounded on private law to one grounded exclusively on public law. But these scholars overstate the shift in question and, moreover, fail to acknowledge that negligence law’s traditional scheme of adjudica­tion is not a necessary condition for securing just relationships in the context of risks to life and limb. This is because New Zealand has not abolished the legal doctrines—particularly injunctive relief and punitive damages—that ensure compliance with the reason for discharging the accommodative duty of care. Thus, a victim can seek punitive damages against an injurer who actively disregards the reason she must have (independent of tort law) for accommodating the victim by exercising appropriate care. Until recently, this same doctrine had been applied even in cases of negligence such as medical malpractice and not only in assault and battery circumstances.\n\nA somewhat similar analysis holds for the typical workers’ compensa­tion scheme, which generally prescribes that injured workers are not enti­tled to sue their employers or coworkers for work-related injuries. However, the nonapplication of tort law in this context has not elimi­nated the interpersonal tort duty of care employers owe to employees; this is crucial for the terms of the employer–employee interaction to count as relationally just. Workers’ compensation schemes do not strip employees of their tort law right to bodily safety, under which they can compel their employers to ensure a reasonably safe work environment. Indeed, the duty of reasonable care can serve as the basis for enjoining the employer from exposing employees to an unsafe workplace. Moreover, workers’ compensation schemes do not release employers from their tort liability for any injury caused by their nonaccidental (i.e., intentional or reckless) misconduct.\n\nFinally, taking a relational justice perspective on negligent infliction of physical harm can change the terms of one of the most fundamental debates in private law theory. Most leading noneconomic accounts of tort law presume that tort law expresses a commitment to either corrective justice or distributive justice (or a mix of both). Whereas corrective justice is founded on a noncomparative conception of equality among formally free persons, distributive justice in tort law concerns the fair allocation of the costs of accidents according to some measure of merit. Some liberal egalitarians who find the implications of corrective justice for tort law normatively disappointing are drawn to its competitor, distributive justice. Other liberal egalitarians, less skeptical of correc­tive justice’s moral underpinnings, suggest that tort law’s commitment to equality cannot be evaluated apart from the distributive patterns to which it gives rise or otherwise sustains.\n\nThe dichotomization of corrective justice and distributive justice and, by extension, the debate over whose side tort law ought to take is misguided: Relational justice represents a nondistributive conception of substantive, rather than formal, justice. Relational justice can, therefore, render tort law’s aspiration to do justice between persons both intelligi­ble and normatively attractive—in a way that distributive justice’s collec­tivistic aspirations and commitment to formal freedom and equality (respectively) cannot.\n\nB. Residential Dwellings and the Workplace\n\nThe first category of cases showed how our account of private law can inform and support the accommodative structure of tort law. Moreo­ver, these cases illustrate both the significance of contextual considera­tions and the persistence of the ideal of just relationships even when, for distributive or pragmatic reasons, the legal regulation of the activity at hand is largely collectivized—namely, when a regulatory, public law doc­trine has taken the lead. We focus now on the manifestations of private law’s accommodative structure in two other areas, property and contract, in the respective contexts of residential dwellings and the workplace. The dual purpose is to highlight the implications of our theory in these key doctrines as well as discuss certain contextual considerations that compli­cate matters but do not jeopardize the intrinsic value of private law.\n\n1. Residential Dwellings. — Residential dwellings are understood in contemporary society as a person’s paradigmatic safe haven, as a bastion of individual independence, as shielding us from the demands of others and from the power of the public authority, and as providing us with an almost sacrosanct private sphere that serves as a prerequisite to our per­sonal development and autonomy. While it may be unethical for an owner to refuse to let another into her home on grounds of religious objection, society defends the owner’s right to do so and conceptualizes such nonaccommodative behavior as the inevitable result of our residen­tial practices. In this context, the very point of our residential practices implies ruling out accommodation.\n\nBut the ownership of a residential dwelling also includes other normative powers that do not exclude commitments to relational justice. Suppose that A is interested in selling her dwelling or leasing it out but refuses to accept B as her buyer (or lessee) only because of B’s religious persuasion. Or suppose that B wishes to purchase A’s unit in a common interest development, but the board withholds its consent to the sale on racial grounds. Because buying or leasing a dwelling implies the fact of our interdependence, they expose certain classes of people—recall the fact of personal difference—to discrimination by some homeowners and landlords. The law justifiably interferes by insisting that these interac­tions be consistent with the demands of relational justice. Deciding on one’s residence is often a major act of self-authorship that plays an im­portant role in people’s construction of their ground projects. The requirement that the parties recognize each other as substantively free and equal persons does not undermine the point of these residential practices.\n\nThe objection to discriminatory practices in this context seems indis­putable. Yet our theory nonetheless sharpens its private law implications by focusing on whether the responsibility in question must (at least also) be borne by the private seller or lessor. The positions of both advocates and critics of the traditional conception of private law are surprisingly similar and unsurprisingly disappointing.\n\nCritics of the public–private distinction and scholars indifferent to it (e.g., lawyer-economists) are bound to treat the identity of the agent re­sponsible for eliminating discrimination in selling or renting residential dwellings solely as a matter of institutional design. For them, what mat­ters is that, at the retail level, members of groups that are discriminated against must enjoy fair equality of opportunity in their efforts to buy or rent the dwellings they prefer and at the wholesale level, that residential dwellings be sufficiently integrative.\n\nTraditionalists, in turn, may be able to show that even if private law is founded on the thin commitment to independence and formal equality, there may be circumstances that justify stripping owners of their entitle­ment to exclude potential buyers. This is the case when nonowners do not have sufficient housing opportunities available to them, so that allow­ing owners to make their selling or renting decisions based on discriminatory considerations would make nonowners “fully subject” to the choices of these owners. But since, in principle, private owners and landlords neither exhaust nor control the supply of residential dwellings, there is no relationship of entailment between discriminatory practices on the part of owners and landlords and a state of dependence on the part of nonowners.\n\nThus, under both the traditionalist and critical accounts, the prohibition against obvious discrimination by private owners is neces­sarily contingent: It depends on the extent to which the state carries out its responsibility to eliminate racial injustice in the context of residential dwellings.\n\nBy contrast, our theory of just relationships lays down a firmer, principled ground for this prohibition: Refusing to consider a would-be buyer on racial (or other discriminatory) grounds fails to respect this person on her own terms and so does not relate to her as a free and equal individual.\n\nRelationally just terms of interaction between persons engaging in the context of buying or renting residential dwellings mandate that own­ers and landlords set aside certain considerations, such as their racist preferences, when making selling or renting decisions. In order for the involved parties to relate as free and equal individuals, the would-be buyer should not bear the consequences of adverse assumptions that owners assign to her based on the personal qualities she actually pos­sesses (or is even perceived as possessing). And regardless of whether the state supplies sufficient housing options while sustaining integrative residential communities, private law must not leave intact (and thereby authorize) social relationships that violate the equal standing and the autonomy of the person subjected to discrimination. There is no way around this imperative to establish relationally just terms of interaction among persons engaging in buying or renting residential dwellings. The various pieces of fair housing legislation at both the federal and state levels, which prohibit discrimination in the sale or rental of residential dwellings based on such considerations as race, gender, nationality, religion, disability, familial status, and sexual orientation, properly implement this prescription.\n\nOur account also shows that the Supreme Court decision in Shelley v. Kraemer failed to acknowledge the existence and importance of the private law dimension of substantive equality. The Court held that judi­cial enforcement of racially restrictive covenants amounts to a violation of the vertical dimension of substantive equality—the dimension that captures the relationship between the state (acting through the courts) and the persons excluded by such covenants. The Fourteenth Amendment’s Equal Protection Clause constitutes the doctrinal expres­sion of this proposition. However, resort to constitutional law alone misses the significance of relational justice that ought to govern the terms of the interaction between the individual persons concerned. One of the basic difficulties with the Shelley ruling underscores the importance of relational justice: Racially restrictive covenants are voidable if, and only if, their enforcement is pursued through the courts. By implica­tion, then, these covenants are not illegal per se, and the same holds with respect to their private enforcement. This flaw is the product of a failure to appreciate the freestanding dimension of relational justice, which is the normative core of private law.\n\nThe scope and contents of the accommodative structure of the power and duty an owner bears in connection with her residential dwell­ing are partially set by reference to contextual considerations. To begin with, the special standing private ownership accords to homeowners to make claims that would be otherwise illegitimate suspends many require­ments of relational justice outside the realm of selling and renting. Moreover, insofar as selling and renting are concerned, contextual considerations can also make a difference, as in the case when the leas­ing at hand entails the cohousing of the landlord and tenant, so that the internal logic of the practice of residential dwelling exempts owners from an accommodative duty. In addition, contextual concerns can also shape the contents of the accommodation required for the terms of the interaction between the relevant participants to count as relationally just. Thus, the duty to accommodate need not affect the right of landlords to determine tenants’ maintenance obligations or similar leasing terms.\n\nRegardless of what additional contextual refinements may be neces­sary, the terms of the interaction between owners and nonowners are not merely instrumental to realizing the public demands of justice in the residential dwellings context (and they certainly cannot be reduced to considerations of aggregate welfare). Requiring a private owner to set aside certain considerations, such as racist preferences, need not derive from a demand to support the state in its effort to fulfill its duty toward would-be victims of discrimination because it is fully grounded in private law’s commitment to relational justice. This commitment neither fulfills nor supplants the state’s obligation to curb discrimination in the housing market (including through the enlistment of the support of private own­ers to that end). Rather, it stands on its own, distinctive ground.\n\n2. Workplace Accommodation. — A similar analysis can be applied to the context of workplace accommodation. Work, at least since the de­cline of feudalism, figures prominently in the mature lives of free and equal persons, as it generates both instrumental and noninstrumental value for our ability to do good by doing well in that practice. For many, work is the quintessential ground project. Here, too, there is a strong sentiment against excluding would-be employees from the labor market due to personal qualities such as certain forms of disability, familial sta­tus, and religious affiliation. Liberal egalitarians agree that the costs associated with such human qualities must not be borne exclusively (or even at all) by the would-be employees. Once again, the crucial question is who bears the responsibility to make the practice of working consistent with this truism; the answer to this question depends on the justification of this commonplace sentiment.\n\nUnder our account of private law, for the terms of the interaction between an employer and a would-be employee to count as relationally just, the responsibility in question must be borne, at least in part, by the employer. Moreover, this responsibility should ground a negligence duty to exercise reasonable care in making relevant employment decisions, rather than merely a duty to refrain from making intentionally discriminatory decisions. Consider an employer who turns down a job candidate because the latter requests days off in accordance with her reli­gious calendar. By disregarding the candidate’s choice of religious prac­tice, the employer fails to respect her on her own terms as a free and equal person. A state effort to substitute the employer’s responsibility with workplace accommodation (whether directly or through subsidies) cannot rectify the employer’s failure. To the extent that the employer does not bear at least some of the costs of accommodation, there is no intelligible way to regard the employer as engaging in relationally just relationships.\n\nThe case of work-related accommodation demonstrates the possible tension between the demands of relational justice and some core distributive and democratic commitments. This tension is the product of the objective costs that work-related accommodation often entails; these costs do not turn on intolerant preferences on the part of employers, employees, customers, or even society at large. Employing a member of another religious faith, for example, could place substantial constraints (related to dietary observances, holy days, dress codes, etc.) on the employer in efficiently operating her business; similarly, constructing an accessible workplace may cost more than its inaccessible counterpart. In these and numerous other contexts—such as the case of a disabled person who cannot compete on equal terms with other candidates for a particular job—a duty to accommodate can impose nontrivial costs, including costs that, from the perspective of distributive justice, are soci­ety’s to bear.\n\nThe tension between private and public responsibilities of accommo­dation may be even more acute. Integration through work is conducive, even if perhaps not essential, to the prospering of democracy. Work-related accommodations are, in some cases, the catalyst for the social integration of the disadvantaged. This tension also plays a crucial role in the social integration of members of heterodox religions and of national minorities. Although successful integration into society through work does not entail political integration, the democratic ideal of equal citizenship is hardly sustainable in its absence.\n\nThis means that considerations of both fair distribution and equal citizenship are at odds with the demands of relational justice. Specifying the metric by which the burden should be redistributed across members of society is a complex task, beyond the purposes of this Article. What is important here is that although employers’ accommodation costs are likely to be passed on to some extent to customers and workers, there is no reason to believe that the emerging distribution will mirror the distributive consequences of government-funded accommodation.\n\nThis Article cannot decisively settle this clash between relational justice and external distributional and equality concerns. Yet our concep­tion of private law—that of just relationships—helps address this ques­tion. Under our account, the identity of the agent (i.e., private employers or the state) who bears responsibility for accommodating employees is not merely a question of institutional design. A society that fully collecti­vizes the recognition of the particular traits that constitute the person that an employee actually is (such as religious affiliation, familial status, and disability) fails to uphold the demands of relational justice. Even the most distributively and democratically just schemes of workplace accom­modation (let alone the most efficient ones) do not satisfy the demands of relational justice if private employers are not obligated to assume re­sponsibility for ensuring this state of affairs. Such schemes leave employ­ers with a too-shallow conception of their relationships with employees, as if their employees were merely abstract beings rather than the fully realized persons they actually are.\n\nIt is important to note, howe"
