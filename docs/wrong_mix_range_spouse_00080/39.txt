Brooks Ayers a married man.

The former Real Housewives Of Orange County star has wed Christy Lindeman and the two are living happily with their dogs in Indianapolis, Indiana.

While on the Bravo TV series he dated series regular Vicki Gunvalson, 55, who he had a rocky romance with for nearly five years, and got into trouble for lying about his health.

Brooks and Vicki split in August 2015 after years of quarreling.

On Sunday Tamara Tattles reported that Brooks and Christy had wed, though they did not give an exact date for their ceremony.

They shared a photo from the church with Brooks in a dark suit and his wife in a white sleeveless V-neck lace dress holding a bouquet of pink-and-white roses.

They have been together since January, it was claimed.

She has two children and both love dogs and football, according to his Facebook page.

He works as a medical sales representative and she is a sales director for a tire company.

Ayers was accused of lying about his health condition while on the Bravo show.

After being confronted about falsifying information about his cancer, he admitted to fabricating medical documents about a non-Hodgkin lymphoma diagnosis to Us Weekly in March 2016.

Gunvalson denied involvement in his claims he had cancer.

It seemed that Ayers having cancer helped ratings for the show and made viewers more interested in him and Vicki. There were even accusations that Brooks knew lying about his health would give him more time on the show.

Now Gunvalson is dating Steve Lodge, who is a retired homicide detective. They have been together since April 2016.

And it looks like the insurance salesperson may marry him.

“I’m so ready for marriage, I’m a marriage girl,' she told Us Weekly in December.
