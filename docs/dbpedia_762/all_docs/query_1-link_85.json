With regard to England, you will do well to go on corresponding with ambassador Chappuys, as you have done hitherto. A copy of his letters has been put into the hands of the English ambassador residing at this Our court, (fn. n2) who, however, has hitherto spoken only in general terms. You will, therefore, assure that one (Wallop) that We have already written to England in a fitting manner, and at the same time exhort him to persevere in the right path and continue the good-will he is now showing, and to keep the whole matter as secret as possible. You will tell him that We consider that to be the best plan to follow for the present, and have accordingly intrusted the negociation to Our ambassador at the court of England.—Genova, 30th March 1536. Spanish. Original draft. pp. 2½. 11 Aug. 211. The Same to Chapuys. S. F., L. 3. Enclosed is a copy of a letter received from the king of England, written, as We can gather, at the instigation and desire of king Francis, inasmuch as the letter has been addressed to the English ambassador residing here by his colleague at the court of France. (fn. n2) Enclosed also is Our answer to the said letter, which answer will be a sort of credential for you when you make your representation to king Henry, and explain Our views in conformity with what We wrote from Savigliano, and from other towns. Indeed, We could not, if We wished, add anything more to Our instructions, and therefore We again insist upon your striving to persuade the king of England of the fact that king Francis has really been the aggressor by his commencing war, not only upon Our cousin and brother-in-law, Monseigneur de Savoie, but on Ourselves, provoking and aggravating Us to the utmost. You will represent Us in this as well as in other negociations as you may deem most fit and convenient, and We on our part will take care that the English ambassador residing with Us be sufficiently acquainted with the whole.—Briñolas, (fn. n3) 11th August 1536. Spanish. (fn. n4) Original draft. pp. 3. 2 Feb. 212. The Emperor to his Ambassadors in England. Wien.,\n\nRep. P.C., Fasc. 231.\n\nff. 1-40. The letter which the High Commander of Leon (Covos) and the Sieur de Grantvelle wrote to you from Gerona on the 19th ult., (fn. n5) —a duplicate of which is herein inclosed for fear of accident—must have acquainted you with the substance of their last communications with the French ambassadors, as well as with the closure of the conferences for the present, the departure of the French Commissioners, and the return here [Barcelona] of Ours. Meanwhile the English ambassador has daily and earnestly solicited from Us an answer to the three points submitted to Us during the absence of Covos and Grantvelle, namely, the peace, the celebration of the General Council of the Church, and the marriage of Our cousin, the princess of England [Mary], to the infante of Portugal, Dom Loys, of which three points special mention will be made hereafter, as well as of several incidents connected with them sufficiently important for your guidance in the negotiations entrusted to your care in England, and that you may try to ascertain, as much as possible, what that king's intentions are on the whole, what may be expected from him, and in short that you may make use of the intelligence for the better issue of public affairs. The English ambassador, after a preamble to explain the great pleasure and satisfaction the King, his master, had felt at the words addressed by Us to his vice-admiral here respecting the birth of the Prince, his son, as well as his own inclusion as principal contracting party, or as he might otherwise wish, in the peace with France—the whole of that being evidently said for the purpose of persuading Us that his master is better inclined than ever to unite himself more closely to Us, and that such were his trust and confidence in Us, that immediately after the report of Our said words lie had sent to his ambassador full powers (which he himself showed to the Sieur de Grantvelle) to treat at once of the said peace, and sign in his master's name whatever papers were required, and follow in every respect Our advice—entered into the subject, as you will presently hear. He was assured in general terms by Our ministers of the affection and esteem We had always felt for his master, the king of England, as well as of Our wish to keep peace and friendship with him, upon which, thinking that he had partly gained his point, he came to Us a second time, and proceeded to explain his views further by saying that his master would be extremely glad to hear again the declarations once made by Us, namely, that whether peace with France were made or not, We still were determined to keep and observe all and every one of the treaties We had with England. [This request of the ambassador We have neither granted, nor rejected absolutely, believing it to refer to Our last treaty with England, and that what the King wanted was to make sure of the Pope, the Council, and other matters. And upon the ambassador pressing to know what hope there might still be of the peace being made, and whether the prorogation and amplification of the truce, of which Our ministers and those of the king of France had treated, and which he (the King) had heard was on the point of being settled—the nephew of Mr. de Velly having come here [to Barcelona] for the purpose—had already been agreed to. We said to him that there was still a hope of peace being concluded between king Francis and Us, inasmuch as the prorogation and amplification of the truce had been agreed to between Our ministers and those of France till the 1st of June, in order to look out in the meanwhile for all possible means of arriving at the said peace; so much so, that the Papal legates sent to the king of France and to Us were actually soliciting that we both should approach nearer to each other, either on this side of the frontier, or elsewhere close to Italy, where, with the intervention of the Holy Father, and, by his means, a lasting peace might be concluded. That with regard to the said truce the French ministers had, through Mr. de Velly's cousin, sent in a proposal, which, being found deficient in substance as well as in form, according to diplomatic custom, had been rejected, and that another proposal had been sent by Our ministers, which We trust will be accepted, it being so reasonable that it cannot but give satisfaction. The ambassador's reply, in a secret and confidential manner, was that the former English ambassador had assured him that the principal reason why the peace had not already been made was that, although We had offered to give to Francis the State of Milan almost immediately, annul the treaties of Madrid and Cambray, especially in what concerns the suzerainty of Flanders, and the surrender of Hesdin, and do whatever else the French might wish, provided they would agree to the General Council under the Pope's authority, king Francis had not yet given his consent. This, We and our ministers argued, was neither true, nor likely to be so, since the king of France himself had unconditionally offered to attend to and promote the Council, without reference to or acceptation of any other prince, provided We would promise to deliver Milan to him within a reasonable period of time. And upon the ambassador inquiring and wishing to know why then the peace had not been concluded, he was told that the failure of the negociations was owing to Our having expressed a wish that the King's practices against the King [of the Romans], Our brother, and Us both in Germany and in Italy, should be abandoned, and that We wished above all things that matters of Faith should be settled at a General Council, Our cousin, the duke of Savoy [Carlo III,.], reinstated in Jus dominions, and other conditions equally just and reasonable which the king of France could not well refuse, as the ambaesador himself owned to Us, since it is his duty towards God so to do for the relief of his conscience. We must add, that whenever the Council has been mentioned in the presence of the English ambassador, he has always declared in the most absolute manner that his master will never attend, one convoked by the authority of the Holy Father; that other princes would do the same, and that it was out of reason for the Holy Father to assume an authority belonging exclusively to the Empire, to the great detriment of other kings and princes. Besides which (he said) the Holy Father had, shown too much partiality, and since the principal matters to be decided in the Council touched him and his differences with the Holy See, he would, not attend it. With these and other similar expressions in contempt and abuse of Papal authority, the English ambassador went on to say that, should We initiate the Council, with the participation of the rest of the kings, princes, and potentates in Christendom, his master, the king of England, would certainly join Us. This, he said, intimating in a most forcible manner that were We to allow the Council to be convoked and held by Papal authority, We would greatly impair Our own Imperial and exclusive right of convoking councils, which right belonged to Us as successor of the good Emperors who had done so of their own authority. The ambassador then said that, not being a good French scholar, he had written a paper upon this matter, and saying so, he produced and handed over to Us one containing his own ideas on the subject. This, however, We declined to receive, on the plea that it was a thing extraneous to Our knowledge, but promised to have it forwarded to Mr. de Grantvelle. Upon which the ambassador added, that his master was about to send Us certain notable personages to inform Us wore in detail of his views on the subject. The ambassador's paper has since been answered as follows: That although it be true that in times of old, Imperial authority was so great and absolute as to enable Emperors to make, and unmake Popes, and likewise to convoke and assemble councils, yet We were unwilling to innovate in such matters, and intended to follow the yielding conduct of Our immediate predecessors in the Empire, considering that if the latter had acted thus, and waived what they thought was their right, it was all for the best. Besides which (the ambassador was told) that this was not the fit time, less than ever, for attempting such innovations. Should the King, his master, send to Us the personages he (the ambas sador) spoke of, they would certainly be honorably received at this Our court, as befitted the good friendship existing between Us two; but We could not do otherwise than follow the steps of Our immediate predecessors in the matter. There was still another reason for Our not coinciding with the King's views on the subject, which was, that We were obliged, to indict the Council convoked by the Holy Father, inasmuch as by the recesses of the Auspurgh and Reynspurgh Diets, it had been unanimously resolved by the States of the Empire that the Holy Father should indict and convoke the said Council; and We had consented to that, and given permission to the princes of the Empire to procure it, as We ourselves had done. Accordingly, therefore, the indictment had been made at Our own request. No member of the Empire could possibly oppose it; besides which, the best and healthiest part of the kings, princes, and potentates in Christendom had adhered to it and approved of the measure. The above are the two principal points concerning which the English ambassador has shown considerable perplexity and doubt, all the arguments put forward by Our ministers having remained without any answer from him. In addition, We must tell you, that when the conversation fell on the Council, Our ministers repeated to the English ambassador the very same words which had lately been said to the King and to the Vice-Admiral, as We informed you by Our letter of the 9th of November ultimo (fn. n6) namely, that We would willingly do Our best towards making him the Pope's friend on the very same terms and conditions specified in Our former letters to you, and which need not be reproduced here, though it must be said that the English ambassador has always indignantly rejected the said conditions, maintaining that they are against his masters honor and conscience, and, moreover, that the English, his subjects, would never consent to the Holy Father, whom he calls the Bishop of Rome, or the Holy See, exercising any authority over England. Yet it must be owned that the ambassador, after listening to Our representations on this subject, as well as to the mutual advantages to be derived from the marriages, of which more will be said hereafter, as well as the evil likely to result in future from want of acquiescence on this point, recommended at last that We should order you [Chapuys and Mendoza] to speak to the King on the subject. And upon Our replying to him that We were unwilling to have things reported to his master, the King, at which he might take offence—as his own words seemed to imply—the ambassador retorted that his master could not but take in good part Our objections. It has, therefore, been settled that We will write to you on the subject, so that, in the name of God, if you can do any good that way, We shall be glad to hear of it, and you may assure the King that We shall remain his true friend for ever, at the same time that We keep to the duties of honor and conscience. With regard to the third point, that of the marriages, We postponed Our answer until We heard the resolution of the, king of Portugal [Joaõ], Our brother-in law, as well as that of the infante Dom Luys, which a confidential ambassador was to bring Us. He arrived two days ago, and the King's answer is that he will be glad to treat of the intended marriage with a mutual dower, and on the terms proposed to him, without having regard either to the birth of the prince or the probable contingency of the king of England marrying again and getting, God willing, further male succession. The king of Portugal and the Infante desired the accomplishment of the proposed marriage, provided the Princess' dower were such as to suit her rank, the power of the King, her father, and, the affection he bears her. A, good conclusion was at once arrived at. The affair had so long been on \"the tapis\" that it was high time that one thing or other should be decided, that is, a marriage or no marriage at all. Such is the King's determination, and in that sense We last wrote to you to speak to king Henry on the subject, and ascertain his final resolution. And inasmuch as the English ambassador had previously told Us that you (Chapuys) had once proposed to that king to marry the Infanta of Portugal (Maria), Our cousin, or Our niece (Christina), the dowager duchess of Milan, and We hear from the Portuguese ambassador that the King, his master, is unwilling to treat of the former marriage and alliance, owing to king Henry having had already a male child from his first wife (which excuse on the part of the Portuguese king you are to keep secret), We have said to the English ambassador that, without stopping at the ceremonies and honorable courtesies customary on the betrothal of ladies, who ought to be demanded in marriage, not offered, and having heard from you that Cromwell, as well as Our sister, the queen regent of Hungary, and governor of the Low Countries, had put forward the said marriage; and again, that king Henry seemed better inclined to Our niece, the dowager duchess of Milan, owing to her age and corpulence, as well as the near resemblance of their complexions resulting from their birth in corresponding climates, with similar modes of living; (fn. n7) presuming that Cromwell, who is so much in the King's confidence, would not have entered on such a subject unless he knew it to be quite agreeable to his master, We wrote that We should be glad to treat of the said marriage, as the High Commander of Leon and Mr. de Grantvelle would declare to him, explaining Our views on the subject. We also wrote that, should the King, his muster, agree to that, many good, things might be carried out for the public weal of Christendom, and particular benefit of his own kingdom, (fn. n8)whether peace with France was made or not. In either case, however, We were determined to go on with Our negotiations for peace with France, or break them off if We pleased, but We could not remain long in such irresolution. Since then Our ministers have resumed the declaration of the said three points, as well as that of Our answer to each of them, and have explained, as clearly as it was in their power to do, what Our intentions were, namely, that for the relief of the King's conscience, for his honor, for the weal of his kingdom, and the solid establishment of his affairs, for the trust he ought to place in Us, he is to believe that whatever has been said or done in the negotiation could not be attributed to any other sentiment than the desire to please him and render friendly offices. That for the considerations above caressed, and the respect and esteem in which We had always held him, as well as the modesty of his address to the queen of Hungary, Our sister, both in the affair of the marriage and in that of the peace—to say nothing of the long protracted negotiation for the marriage between the infante Dom Luys and Our cousin of England—and, above all, for the frank and sincere language on the subject of his marriage with the dowager duchess of Milan, We had no objection whatever to treat of it, and suspend for his sake any other treaties and negotiations there might be for her hand. Further still, in order to show the King Our great affection, and the desire We had of pleasing him, and promoting any scheme that might be beneficial to him and to his kingdom, We had suggested that, leaving the inheritance of the kingdom of England to the son of the first marriage,—should that of Our niece be effected,—We would procure such an arrangement between him and the duke Palatine Frederic, who has married [Dorothea], the elder sister of Our said niece [Christine], that the king of England might recover and secure for the children born of this second marriage the whole of the kingdoms of Denmark, Norway, and Sweden, as well as all the patrimonial estates of the King, her father; (fn. n9) the recovery of which kingdoms and patrimonial estates from those who now hold them against all right and reason, as well as the defence of them., would be easily accomplished, owing to their vicinity to England and to the Low Countries. The King himself could not find a more fit and profitable prospect for the children of his second, marriage, or more advantageous for England, and We must add for your information that when We propounded these Our views to the English ambassador he was singularly delighted, saying that he only wished he could be in England to announce to his master such a wonderful project. In full explanation of Our words \"that a good deal more might be done in the King's favor,\" for his honor and reputation, as well as for the benefit of Christendom at large, Our ministers proceeded to inform the English ambassador that, should his royal master agree to treat with His Holiness, make league and confederacy with him, the Signory of Venice and Ourselves, matters might be smoothed and peace ensured in spite of the efforts made by others to bring trouble upon Us; and that, by the marriage of the infante Dom Loys to Our cousin of England, both might be placed in a position of high honor to the King's great comfort and profit, the security of his own kingdom, and peculiar benefit of the Prince, his son; besides other advantages to be derived from his second marriage, as above. Which explanation being heard by the ambassador, he pricked up his ears more than he had done before, and begged Our ministers to put down in writing the above particulars, which has since been done. And whereas this matter is of the utmost importance, as you will easily perceive, and one that requires much steadiness and dexterity on your part, We have given orders that it should be laid down before you with all possible prolixity, that you may, in accordance with Our minister's words to the English ambassador here, shape your conduct as you may think best, and, if possible, bring the whole matter to a satisfactory conclusion with the conditions required for each of the three points, so as to connect and bind together the whole affair, (fn. n10) in such a manner that by the King's intervention in the peace We may he able to obtain from France any conditions We may like to impose, if We agree to deliver to him the duchy of Milan within a specified period of time. But you must bear in mind that it is not Our intention to drop or suspend the negociations with France before We are quite sure and certain that the king of England comes forward in a plain and straightforward manner, and without further delay or tergiversation, to treat of a closer and more binding intelligence with Us, and that the two marriages, namely, that of Our brother-in-law of Portugal, and Our cousin of England, as welt as that of the King himself, with Our niece, the dowager duchess of Milan, be accomplished and effected to the mutual satisfaction and, advantage of the parties concerned. The king of England ought to consider and bear in mind that in favor of the marriage of Our cousin, the princess Mary, to the infante of Portugal, We purpose to bestow upon them and their descendants, the investiture of Milan according to the rides of an Imperial fief and previous to the satisfactory settlement of his differences with the Holy Father, the King joining the league and confederacy between himself, the Apostolic See, the Signory of Venice, and other Italian powers for the defence of the duchy as well as of the rest of Italy, and giving such assistance from his kingdom of England, now and hereafter, that We may rest assured that the State of Milan may in future be guarded and defended without any effort or cost on Our part, so that the infante of Portugal and Our cousin of England and their heirs may enjoy the same peacefully and without opposition, and the whole of Italy be secure. Should, moreover, the king of England marry our niece, the dowager duchess of Milan, We undertake to induce the Palatine duke [Frederic] to take such engagements respecting Our Low Countries as may seem convenient and agreeable to the parties. The king of England moreover, to join Us and Our brother, the king of the Romans, and help towards the preservation of Our Imperial rights in Germany, besides treating the affairs of the king of France in such a manner that the latter may be brought within reasonable bounds, whilst matters of Faith are being adjusted by the future Council. The above named propositions you will forward to that king or to his ministers in the manner you may deem most fit; at any rate, should you not gain your point, let not the King or his ministers profit by the communication of Our views in the matter. With regard to the particulars mentioned In your despatches of the 30th of November and last Christmas Eve, concerning the proposed marriage of Our brother-in-law, the infante of Portugal and Our cousin of England, We cannot at this present time give you a fuller answer, or enter into more minute details than those contained in the corresponding paragraph of these Our Instructions. If interrogated thereupon, you may say that We are as yet ignorant of king Dom Joaõ's final resolution, and cannot guess what his answer will be, but are daily waiting for it. Should you find an opportunity to introduce the summary of Our views about Milan, as above, you may do so. As to your excuses for not mentioning the powers in your possession, We entirely approve of them, and find them good and plausible. In short, and to put an end to this long letter, We again tall you that the above is the summary of Our views in these matters. It is now for you to act and use your discretional powers so as to bring the pending negotiation to a satisfactory issue, and let Us hear from you frequently, and as soon as possible. One fact concerning these affairs We could not omit for your guidance, which is, that the other day, in conversation with Our ministers, the English ambassador showed great satisfaction end pleasure at the last overtures made by them, and said that he would write home immediately, and request that the personages whom his royal master had already appointed to come to this Our Court, should make haste, and bring his final resolution, as well as full powers to conclude the treaty, and, terminate the affair. Of this intelligence you may also make use by way of persuasion, and should the ambassadors' news turn out true, try and endeavour that the plenary powers to be brought by the personages above alluded to, be so full and complete as to require no further consultation.— Barcelona, 2nd February 1538. French. Original. Entirely ciphered. pp. 20. 25 Feb. 213. Eustace Chapuys to the Queen of Hungary. Wien.,\n\nRep. P. C.,\n\nFasc. 231, f. 9-12. Don Diego de Mendoza and I have lately on five different occasions been in communication with this king and his ministers concerning his own marriage with the dowager duchess of Milan (fn. n11) about which His Majesty the Emperor wrote last to both of us—as well as concerning that of Dom Loys [of Portugal] with the Princess [Mary]. After a good deal of disputation and altercation, many devices, and no small amount of expostulation, mutual offers and so forth, the King and his deputies have come to this resolution. They would willingly agree to the Princess' marriage with the Infante of Portugal, were we, the Imperial ambassadors, furnished with full and express powers to name and fix the dowry that the said princess is to have, as well as describe the property and estates on which that dowry is to be settled. But that as our powers were evidently insufficient for that purpose, and besides, did not extend to the other marriage alliances spoken of, such as that of the King himself with the dowager duchess of Milan, that of this prince with His Majesty's second daughter, of the duke of Savoy's son with this king's second-horn daughter, he [the King] and his ministers could not well agree at once, inasmuch as it was the King's wish that all those marriages should he discussed conjointly and at the same time. In addition to that the King (said the deputies) was unwilling to marry the dowager duchess of Milan unless he saw her first; it was hut just also that the Princess [his daughter] should see the Infante [of Portugal]. This might easily he accomplished, the King observed, at one of the conferences, by Your Majesty coming to Calais accompanied by the said duchess [of Milan], as well as by the Infante Dom Loys, when he, himself might repair thither accompanied by the Princess, his daughter, and we, both Don Diego and I, were requested to write to His Imperial Majesty on the subject, which we have since done by an express messenger of his, who came [to London] for the purpose. I must add that the royal messenger to whom I allude brought letters requesting again that the arbitration of peace should be placed in his own hands, offering at the same time to do wonders against the Turk. I have no doubt that he [the King] will go on bragging, hut, in my opinion, solely for the purpose of drawing money out of his subjects on the specious pretence of waging war against the Infidel. It seems to me as if a good deal of the coldness and indifference which these people show in the matter had its origin in the report which has come to them from abroad, namely, that should the Emperor treat of a peace with France, this King would certainly be included in the treaty as principal contracting party, and, moreover, that His Imperial Majesty would never consent to any matters likely to turn out to this king's disadvantage being discussed at the General Council or elsewhere. Indeed, not later than yesterday, as I myself was in the Privy Council urging some of its members to make haste and take some good resolution in the affair before peace was definitely concluded between His Imperial Majesty and the Icing of France, I was answered by one of the councillors to whom I addressed myself, that they were not the least concerned about the peace with France or the General Council. I must say that this king's privy councillors individually are just now treating us with all possible courtesy and favor, and I guess by the King's express commands, who only the other day treated my colleague and myself in the kindest and most honorable manner, sending us a message that he wished to entertain us next week at Anthoncourt (Hampton Court) for three or four days running. In fact I hear that apartments are being prepared for us there, and that, as a mark of still greater favor and distinction, permission is to be granted for us to visit the young prince. I really believe, Madam, that part of this intended favor and feasting owes its origin to the good reception made by the Emperor to this king's ministers, and the other to their wish of promoting the jealousy of the French. Yesterday, the 22nd, Briant (Sir Francis) returned from France. I believe that he is not the bearer of great news, at least if I am to judge from the countenance of those who ought to know. The bishop of Tarbes is on the road. He brings the French answer to the note taken by Briant. On his arrival here I will try to ascertain what his commission is and inform Your Majesty thereof.—London, 23 February 1538.

Last Wednesday, which was the 28 February, this king sent for Don Diego [de Mendoza] and myself to go and visit him at a manor of his, 12 miles distant from London. Two of the principal gentleman of his chamber having been appointed to meet us on the road and conduct us to the Royal presence, we were first of all taken to our respective apartments, and then shown all the curiosities and most remarkable appendages of the place. Then a message came from the King saying that he was ready at any hour that would suit us best to give us audience, and have a talk. We fixed the morning of the next day, and having accordingly appeared before him, were most kindly and graciously received, the King expressing his regret, as well as offering his excuses for the trouble he had given us in visiting him in his manor. (fn. n12) He then asked us whether we had heard anything of what his ambassador residing in France had lately written from that court, namely, that there was a talk of the Emperor's deputies and commissaries again meeting those of king Francis for the purpose of treating about the peace. Our answer was, that we had received no information whatever on that point, upon which he [the King] began to say that in his opinion it would be time lost; the only way to secure the said peace was to appoint him mediator and arbiter of the same. King Francis (he said) will have no difficulty in trusting the mediation to me, and as to the Emperor, I cannot see what objection lie can possibly raise. I imagine that one of the reasons that has brought the bishop of Tarbes to this country is to offer me the arbitration in his master's name, as I will shortly apprise you, for on this very day the ambassadors of France are to come here to me, and explain their charge (fn. n13) After taking leave of the King we were conducted by the said gentleman of the King's chamber to the lodgings (logis) of the Prince, about three or four miles off, where we were as well received, feasted, and banqueted as on the former day at the Royal manor. After dinner we saw the little prince (Edward), who in reality is one of the prettiest children of his age that could be seen any where. We also saw there Madame Isabelle (Elizabeth), the King's daughter, who is certainly very pretty, (fn. n14) From there the gentlemen took us to Richemont, to the princess [Mary], where we stayed a good many hours talking with her, and hearing her play on the luth or the spinet in so admirable a manner that I really believe she is the most accomplished musician that could be found. (fn. n15) Among other things she said to us, one was to commemorate in due terms the immense obligation under which she stands to you, Madam, at the same time begging us both to commend her to Your Majesty's good graces, for whose happiness and prosperity she never ceased, as is her duty, to address her prayers to God. On our return to this town one of Cromwell's secretaries came to us, and said how two or three hours after we had taken leave of the King, the ambassadors of France had arrived [at Hampton Court], and that their message was of such a nature as to cause the King, his master, to communicate at once with his ambassador at the Imperial court. He (Cromwell) had considered it necessary to inform us of the fact, and as be understood that we were on the point of dispatching a courier to the Emperor, he begged us to delay his departure until we heard from the King or from him. The day after, which was the first of March, Cromwell sent us message by the said secretary that the French ambassadors had positively assured the King, his master, that Icing Francis wished nothing so ardently as to see him [the ling of England] mediate and be the arbiter of the said peace. He, king Francis, had written to that effect to the Emperor, but the latter would not hear of it, which was an evident proof of the mistrust and ill-will which the Emperor had towards England, whose king (said the ambassadors) ought not to trust to the former s fine words and promises, only calculated to detach him from French alliance in order to fall afterwards on him. The French ambassadors added that it was in the King, their master's, power to make peace at once, whenever they chose, and yet king Francis would do nothing of the sort without the previous knowledge and consent of his ally [king Henry of England]. They ended by saying that they had mandate and full powers to treat of many other things with the King, &c. The Secretary added that Cromwell wished to inform us of this state of things not so much for the good issue of the negociation in hand, as for his own particular safety, for he would be in danger of being destroyed and branded with infamy were the Emperor to turn against his master, the King, in the manner specified by the ambassadors, since he himself had often assured the King of the contrary. The finer and warmer our reception at Hampton Court the colder was that of the French ambassadors, which circumstance makes me fear that the whole of it has been artfully designed and done by these people for the express purpose of arousing the jealousy of the French, and making their own profit out of it.

P.C.,\n\nFasc. 231.\n\nff. 44-6. 215. The English Ambassador in the Low Countries on the Extradition of certain Criminals. On the 14th of February 1538, the English ambassador personally placed in the hands of the Queen [dowager of Hungary] a certain request to the effect that on Thursday the 6th of the aforesaid month, an Englishman named Henry Philipps (fn. n17) had stolen from him, at his own house, a considerable sum of money, amounting more or less to 2,000 crs. of the Sun, besides some rings, and had fled with an accomplice of his, also an Englishman, Christopher Joye by name. And whereas the said ambassador said that he strongly suspected that one Guillaume Lathon, also an Englishman, in his service, was well acquainted with the aforesaid Henry Philipps, and might perhaps know something of the theft or robbery, he (the ambassador) wished to send the latter to England under irons that he might there be threatened with judicial proceedings, and induce his parents and friends from fear of the Law to restore the money stolen, which request (he said) the Queen ought the more readily grant that the aforesaid Guillaume Layton, having declared himself innocent of the charge brought against him, was very glad of being transported to England that he might then and there clear himself before the judges of the country. The Queen, finding the thing rather difficult owing to the consequences of the affair, answered that the crime of which Layton was accused having been committed in this country (Brussels), where justice was impartially administered, he (the ambassador) might send the culprit before the chancellor of Brabant, who would, by her express commands, have him examined and do speedy justice in the cause, which manner of proceeding the ambassador ought to approve of, considering that by that means reparation would be obtained without any prejudice to the liberties and privileges of the Low Countries or the Emperor's authority. The ambassador, however, did not agree to that manner of proceeding in the affair, upon which Her Majesty the Queen said that she would send his request to the Council and give him an answer as soon as possible. Meanwhile the Queen was told that the case might be different from what the ambassador had stated, for, in the first place, it was rumoured that Layton had, with the knowledge and full consent of the ambassador, written to Henry Phillips, at that time on bad terms with the king of England, owing to his having once accused and denounced in this country a famous English Lutheran of the name of Tindalle (fn. n18) —since executed and burnt at Viluvorde (Vilworden), that if he chose to leave Cleves, where he (Phillips) then resided, and come back to Brussels to the ambassador, the latter would obtain for him the King's grace and pardon for the offence he had done him. Henry Phillips believing Layton's words to be true, determined to come back to Brussels, which he did on Wednesday the 5th instant, when, after certain formalities and talk, the ambassador received him kindly, invited him to supper, addressed him in the most gracious and amiable terms, and ended by telling him that he had actually obtained through his friends in England the King's full pardon for all his previous offences. After supper, however, the ambassador began to hold a very different language to him, saying that he (Phillips) had done well in coming back to Brussels, for even if it had been necessary to spend one hundred thousand angelots to send him a prisoner to England, his arrest and transportation would have been effected, inasmuch as the King wished very much to know from his own lips what were his motives for accusing Tindalle in this country; what he himself had since done whilst at Rome, and what could be cardinal Pole's machinations in that city against England, for it was well known that during his brother's lifetime the Cardinal had planned the invasion of England by a foreign force. The King was aware that he (Henry Phillips) was well acquainted with the Cardinal's movements, and knew his secrets, and, therefore, wished to interrogate him. Had it not been for that the ambassador could never have obtained his pardon. Henry Phillips, hearing the ambassador express himself in such terms and say that he was to go to England willingly or by force, to answer the King's questions as above; knowing the horrible executions which daily take place in that country, where people are put to the rack to confess things which they never did or thought of doing, and where so much human blood had been and is daily being spilt; knowing also that his own father was in gaol, dissembled out of fear, and lest he should be forcibly detained and secretly conveyed to England, said that he was quite ready to obey the ambassador's orders, intending all the time to seize the first opportunity to escape and be free. After this the ambassador retired to his chamber and went to bed, as did also both Joye and Lay ton, who had prepared the trap for Phillips. Next day four post-horses were hired and three of the embassy men made ready to conduct Henry to England; but whilst they were looking out for their traps (houseaulx) he (Phillips) had time to run away, at which the ambassador, perceiving that his plans had been defeated, was exceedingly angry. Then it was that, in order to make sure of his person again, he caused to be publicly cried throughout Brussels and other neighbouring places that he had been robbed by the said Henry Phillips, and that whoever would discover his whereabouts, and reveal it to him, or bring the culprit to the English embassy, would receive forthwith one hundred crs. of gold as reward. (fn. n19) He, moreover, caused all the gates of this city to be closely watched, and sent horsemen to scour the country and look out for him; but in vain, for Henry could nowhere be found. Then the Queen was reminded and she soon recollected, that about three years ago an English ambassador (fn. n20) had brought her letters from his master, in which the said Henry Phillips was described as a great traitor and a criminal lœsœ majestatis, and requesting that, according to the treaties existing between the Low Countries and England, he should be arrested and delivered up to the King's officials in Brussels to be conveyed a prisoner to England, there to be tried and punished according to his deserts; but Phillips having had knowledge of the King's application, and not choosing to become the cause of an international quarrel— though he declared to be innocent of the crimes brought against him, and knew very well that the whole affair had been got up to deceive the Queen, and take revenge of him on account of Tindale (sic)—left Brussels and went away. The Queen then had the whole case submitted to the deliberation of her Council, and inquired whether the ambassador's request was to be granted, and whether he was to be allowed or not to send Layton a prisoner to England. The Council's report was that it would he a bad example for the future, and one much against the Emperor's honor and that of his Low Countries to send away or expel therefrom the said Layton, or anyone else accused of crimes or misdemeanours committed in this country to be punished in England, and that, according to the information obtained, it was probable that the ambassador's request was only dictated by his own desire of safeguarding his honor, and making people believe that the crime with which he charged Phillips was not an invention or a feint, since he was sending to England his own man (Layton) accused of being his accomplice, and that his principal object was to catch hold of Phillips and send him to England if he could. The ambassador alleged that the Queen might well grant him this request, and that she could not well deny the permission he had asked of sending Layton to England, for, after all, robbery and theft (fn. n21) were one and the same thing. It was then deemed fit, in order to put an end to the ambassador's petitions, to tell him that, should Layton wish to go to England of his own accord and will, free, not a prisoner, he would in nowise be prevented from doing so; for the going in and out of these Low Countries was allowable for the natives thereof, as well for English-born subjects. If, however, the ambassador wanted to send him thither in irons, that could not be; Her Majesty had decided to appoint commissioners to interrogate Layton thereupon, and ascertain from him whether it was with his consent and out of his own free will that he was to be conveyed to England as prisoner, and what he himself knew of the theft, and whether he had connived at or taken part in it, in order to investigate the whole case and arrive at the truth. The Queen's resolution was communicated to the ambassador by the Chancellor of the Order, Dr. Schore, without, however, letting him know any part of the above information they were in possession of respecting Phillips and his case. The ambassador's answer was that really and truly he had, at the request of Joie (fn. n22) and Layton, Henry's fellowservants, solicited and obtained for him the King's pardon; that Joie and Layton had accordingly written to him to come to Brussels, which he did; that on his appearing before his presence he wished to touch his hand, but that he (the ambassador) would not give it him at first unless he intended forsaking his old habits, and becoming an honest man; and that having heard from him that he would be such in future, he then tendered his hand, and said to him, \"You are welcome; I have procured your pardon In England; you may be sure of that.\" The ambassador also owned that after supper he had spoken to Phillips the words above related, or nearly the same, and that the latter had shown willingness to go to England, upon which, having decided to send him thither with three of his own men, without any afterthought he (the ambassador) took out of his desk 40 crowns for the expenses of Henry's journey to England, together with his three companions, but had inadvertently left his cash-box (boile) on his bedroom table. The same night, when asleep, his valet went down to banquet with his companions, and left the door of the bedroom ajar, upon which Phillips entered and stole the box (bougette), and next morning went away with it. As Joye (pursued the ambassador) had accompanied him in his flight against his solemn promise of escorting him to England, I infer that he (Joye) had helped to steal the cash-box, inasmuch as some years ago he had robbed his own father, and was altogether a thorough knave. With regard to Layton, I fancy that he was not guilty, since he remained behind, and yet I cannot help thinking that he must have known something about it. That is why I will not have him examined by commissioners, as if he himself were a thief; I intend to keep him in my service as long as I remain at Brussels, and on my return to England will act towards him as I may be legally advised. \"If I have asked for permission to send him to England a prisoner it is not for the purpose of having him examined and tried, but merely to threaten his parents, and compel him by that means to the restitution of my money, as aforesaid.\" The ambassador ended by thanking the Queen for attending to his request, though he said he might have wished for greater dispatch. On the 19th of the same month of February a request was presented to Her Majesty by the said Henry Phillips, stating that he had heard that the ambassador had without reason imputed to him the theft and robbery of his money, of which it was his intention to clear himself before the judges of the land, offering to present himself and surrender his person into the hands of the Emperor's officers in these Low Countries, or in the Chancery of Brabant, and wait for a sentence, however rigorous, provided a good and valid safe-conduct were furnished him to come to, reside, go in and out of these Low Countries for any case that might otherwise be brought against him, save that of the above-mentioned robbery, for which he desired no safe-conduct whatever, since he hoped that all the calumnies raised against him, and the artful devices employed to make him go to a sure death in England would soon be discovered and made patent. The Queen, thereupon, determined to grant the safe-conduct applied for by Henry Phillips, but before doing so, she thought of communicating the petition to the ambassador in order to hear his opinion, and know from him whether in the event of the safe-conduct being granted, Henry Phillips might consider himself secure in the Low Countries, and be without fear of being delivered to England. Should the ambassador refuse, it would be a proof that he objected to the whole truth of the affair being known, and therefore, there would be a presumption of fraud or intrigue of some kind. To ascertain this from the ambassador Her Majesty ordered the Chancellor of Brabant and that of the Order, to call on the ambassador, which they did on the very same day, communicating to him not only the contents of Henry's petition, but the decision also which Her Majesty was likely to take respecting it. Which being heard by the English ambassador, he replied that he was glad that Henry Phillips was still within the Emperor's dominions, perhaps in Brussels itself, as he fancied, for he had had the gates of the city closely watched, and the neighbouring districts well explored, and he could not be found. After which he recited to the commissioners word by word the whole of his allegation, telling them how he had obtained the King's pardon for Phillips; how his companions had written to him to come; how he himself had exhorted him to live honestly; how he had intended to send him to England at his own expense; and how the latter had taken to flight and robbed him in the manner above described. All of this the ambassador swore to be the plain truth, not an invention or a falsehood: he never had received either from the King or from his Privy Council undue orders or instructions respecting the said Henry. This he maintained over and over again, asserting that he was not a man to take part in unbecoming practices and intrigues of that sort, for he professed to be an honest man, as he could prove by referring to the King, and to his Privy Council, if necessary. It seemed to him (the ambassador went on to say) that if faith was attached to Henry's petition, a different opinion might be formed of his own personal character; if so, that pained him exceedingly Ever since his arrival in the Low Countries he had been most unfortunate; in crossing the sea he was seized with quartan fever and ague, which had lasted for upwards of three months. He had been expressly sent to Brussels for some good affair, the first overtures of which had come from the Emperor, and yet he perceived that no good would ultimately come out of it; he had been robbed and lost his money, though he could not positively assert whether it was Henry Phillips who had stolen it, or whether Christophe Joye and Guillaume Lay ton, or any other servant of his household, or some stranger, perhaps, had done the deed, though his presumptions were that the former had been the thief. At any rate, he had lost his money, and Henry Phillips had disappeared. With regard to the safe-conduct applied for, he (the ambassador) begged the Queen to have the said Henry arrested as a traitor and a thief (larron); then he would demand his person to have him tried in England and sentenced, notwithstanding any safe-conduct obtained by him; and upon the commissioners observing that the Queen was not aware of Henry being in Brussels, and that his petition had come by a man quite unknown, who had since gone away, the ambassador affected not to know anything about it, although there is every reason to believe he is perfectly well aware of his whereabouts, having ascertained by the report of his own servants that he quitted this town immediately, and has since been seen at Louvain, which fact has been carefully reported to the Queen. On the 20th, the English ambassador having called on the Queen, thanked her for the honor of the communication brought by her commissioners, but said that he could not possibly agree to the safe-conduct in question, inasmuch as it tended to the prejudice of his master's rights, who is under the impression that as long as the said Henry remains in the Emperor's dominions, he can be personally surrendered when applied for, and therefore, that if Her Majesty would have him arrested and given up, the King would be highly pleased at it. The Queen's answerwas that honesty forbade her summoning Henry to Brussels to be tried and then delivered to the king of England; but if the ambassador insisted upon his being tried and punished for the theft of which he was accused, she could not do less than grant him the safe-conduct he had applied for, and give him an opportunity of clearing himself before the judges of the charges brought against him. She (the Queen) had communicated with the ambassador about Henry's petition, not indeed to obtain his consent as to granting or refusing the safe-conduct, but in order to ascertain whether he (the ambassador) agreed to his trial for the theft whereof he was accused. As to the safe-conduct itself she (the Queen) could not conceive how it could possibly affect or damage the King's rights since the ambassador himself had owned that the King had granted Henry full pardon in all other cases, The ambassador replied that he did not wish the safe-conduct to be granted, or that the said Henry should be tried here for his theft, inasmuch as he was not sure that it was he who had committed it; all he could say was that he had lost his bougette with upwards of 2000 crs. inside, and that he ought to be believed on his word, for he was an honest man, and presumed that it was Henry who had stolen it, from his having immediately taken to flight, though he himself could not adduce further proofs of the man's guilt. It was quite true that the King's pardon had been solicited and obtained; but it was on condition of Henry leading a new life, becoming an honest man, and repairing to England, which he had not done, and had on the contrary broken his promise and secretly fled, and, therefore, made himself undeserving of the King's conditional pardon. The ambassador ended by requesting Her Majesty that since Henry had presented a petition, it was evident that he was still within the Emperor's dominions, and, therefore, he asked that the culprit should be arrested and sent to England, especially as he had been informed that he was still in Brussels. He was ready to pay for any expenses incurred by the most diligent search, for he would spare nothing to secure his person and would willingly spend all his substance to get hold of him, even if he were in the hands and under the shelter of the bishop of Rome. Upon which the ambassador was requested to name the person from whom the information had been obtained as to Phillips being still at Brussels, that the Queen might investigate the truth of the report; but this he declined to do, alleging that the Queen might as well interrogate the man who brought Henry's petition. The Queen's answer was that the petition had been presented by an unknown man while she herself was going to Mass, but that when the answer should be called for, proper inquiries should be instituted as to Henry's whereabouts, at which the ambassador seemed satisfied.

Your letter of 25th ultimo, informing me of your conferences with the king of England and with Sieur Cromwell, respecting the peace and the matrimonial alliances in question, have come to hand. I am perfectly convinced, as you yourself are, that all their flattering words are but a feint to deceive us, and yet that it is necessary to dissemble and try to carry on the negociation as long as possible with them, according to the Emperor's intention and the instructions received from him. However, that you may the better keep to the letter of those instructions there, where you are, I deem it opportune to acquaint you with a fact, of which you are not perhaps aware, namely, that Sieur Cromwell has sent here expressly a man, besides a message by ambassador Hauton, to the effect that the Emperor had proposed to the King, his master, the marriage of my niece, the dowager duchess of Milan, with honorable and advantageous conditions; that he (the Emperor) offers to help efficiently towards it, and wishes it to take place before king Francis becomes aware of it. Cromwell asks that the man be allowed to see and talk with my said niece, and take her portrait in order to show it to the King and give him greater desire to see her. This I have allowed, and the man has actually returned to England with the portrait, well satisfied with the personal appearance and manners of my said niece, who has not failed on the occasion to thank Cromwell for his offers and show of affection. It is now for you to ascertain, as far us it is in your power, how and where this thing has sprung up, how the proposition has been received in England, if it came from the Emporor, as Cromwell says, and, in short, to let me know, in conformity with your ambassadorial duties, how political matters stand. From Italy and France the news is that the meeting of the Pope, Emperor, and king of France, is to take place at the end of this month at Nyce, but the Emperor has not yet written in confirmation, nor do I known whether the duke of Aarschot is on his road or not, by whom I expect to have news. I have given orders that a sum of money on account of your salary be remitted to you in bills from this Imperial treasury, and will take care that the remainder be forwarded to you as soon as possible by the Ministers of the Finances.— [Brussels], March 1538.

Your Majesty's letter of the 4th came to hand, and on the same day I gave orders that a passport should be made out for the courier to go on board the same galleon in which the Sieur de Vauldieu came back from Spain, which is a very fit and well-appointed vessel, and I have recommended the master and crew of the said galleon to make all possible haste, as otherwise they might not reach Spain before the Emperor's embarkation for Italy. Your Majesty has, as on all other occasions, thought prudently and wisely of writing to Sieur Cromwell, who is certainly the personage who desires most, as he justly deserves, to be trusted in these affairs, were it for no other cause than the singular devotion he has always shown for the Emperor's service and your own. He has been immensely gratified and joyful at receiving Your Majesty's letter, and has begged me to thank you for it, making, at the same time, the offer of his small and humble services. On the 12th inst. the courier these people sent to France, immediately after the bishop of Terbes (Tarbes) had spoken to this king, as I had the honor to write then to Your Majesty, arrived. The very moment the courier came back the French ambassadors sent to ask for an audience from this king, which was not granted at first, on the excuse of a severe cold that had come suddenly upon him, and which prevented his seeing any one. The King, therefore, referred the ambassadors to Cromwell, but the Bishop declined, saying that he had been sent expressly to the King, not to his ministers. At last, on the 18th, the ambassadors had audience from the King, who, as far as I can hear from the Princess and from other quarters, gave them a poor reception, and addressed them in such unpleasant words that they came out of the palace greatly disappointed and dissatified, as the Bishop himself has since declared to the Venetian secretary, saying to him : \"One thing consoles me, which is, that I shall soon be revenged of these people and their bravadoes (braveries), for I will now do my best to promote a peace between His Imperial Majesty and the King, my master, of which I hitherto entertained some doubts.\" On the following day the Bishop received, as present, 500 crowns, and about 150 more for a gentleman of his suite (fn. n24) who has come with him; but with all that be has not yet got his passports, nor do I believe he will get them until this king has received an answer from Spain to his two lust despatches, the waiting for which was the cause, as I have said before, of the King delaying so long to give them audience. On the very same day, the 18th, the painter sent by this king to Flanders came back with the Duchess' likeness, which, I am told, has singularly pleased the King, so much so, that since he saw it he has been in much better humor than lie ever was, making musicians play on their instruments all day along. Two days after he went to dine at a splendid house of his, where he had collected all his musicians, and, after giving orders for the erection of certain sumptuous buildings therein, returned home by water, surrounded by musicians, and went straight to visit the duchess of Suffocq, the mother-in-law of the duke of Norfolk, and the wife of his brother, and ever since cannot be one single moment without masks, which is a sign that he purposes to marry again, unless he does all that by way of dissimulation whilst the bishop of Tarbes is here still. As far as I hear this king is anything but pleased at the meeting, which is soon to take place, of the Pope, His Majesty the Emperor, and the king of France; and yet, when Sieur Cromwell sent me the information respecting it, he added, without any further remark on the subject, that should the Emperor decide to part with the duchy of Milan, I ought to suggest that a good and substantial pension should be reserved for the dowager duchess of Milan, in order to give more authority to her marriage. Nothing further to advise from this country save that by this king's order the monasteries and abbeys of this country are being demolished and ruined.—London, 23 March 1538.

I have received Your Majesty's letter of the 26th ultimo, for which I return my humblest thanks, as the first paragraph of it concerns me personally and relates to my honoraries, &c. With regard to other matters contained in the said letter having, as I think, answered in full, I will not be over prolix now, but refer only to it and relate what has happened since. The letter came very à apropos to afford me, in the difficult and embarrassing position of our affairs here, an opportunity to send a message to Cromwell, and refresh his memory respecting the good opinion you have of him; for ever since I last saw him he has never ceased to tell me how astonished he was at not hearing from Your Majesty since the English ambassador residing at that court had written to say that I should soon get a confidential message from him [Cromwell]. (fn. n25) Respecting the business in hand, which is still far from being settled one way or the other, all I can say is that it seems, to judge from the words and doings of these people— that there is much less hope than ever of bringing it to a satisfactory conclusion. To give Your Majesty an idea of the present state of the negociations, I will draw up a summary account of what has happened since the date of my last despatch. On the 24th ultimo a courier lately sent by this king to Spain, returned, bringing despatches from the English ambassador at the Imperial court, as well as official letters for Don Diego and myself. The King and his privy councillors, and above all Cromwell, looking upon the letter of their ambassador as rather cold and unmeaning, the latter sent me word twice, and by two different secretaries of his, the very same day of the courier's arrival, begging and entreating me, for God's sake, if I had any good news to impart likely to be beneficial in the present state of the negociations, to communicate it to him, for (said the message) he was exceedingly disappointed at noticing the coldness and indifference of the ambassador's despatch. And, although I did not fail on this occasion, as on all others, to answer him in hopeful terms, yet he himself came to my lodgings on Lady Day, and we had two hours conversation together, he (Cromwell) going away, as it appeared, more comforted and satisfied than he came to me, chiefly from my having assured him, upon my faith and honor, that His Imperial Majesty proceeded frankly and without dissimulation in the business; that whatever mutual engagements might be taken respecting the two marriages in question, the Emperor was willing and ready to agree to, ratify and observe in the most absolute manner; and that there was no cause or occasion to allege as an excuse on their part the insufficiency, as they called it, of our commission and powers to treat. Next day, which was the 26th, the French ambassador, accompanied by a councillor of the Parliament of Paris, the same who came to London with the bishop of Tarbes, dined at Cromwell's, and after dinner held a consultation with the members of the Privy Council. The day after Don Diego and I went to the Kings, who, I must say, treated us with more civility, kindness, and familiarity than ever, telling us, among other things, which I omit for brevity's sake, that he owned he had hitherto leaned ostensibly on the side of France, but that now he had changed his purpose. He had been told that His Imperial Majesty had lately shown some discontent and jealousy at Mr. de Tarbes' arrival in this country, but there was not the lead occasion for that, the principal object of the Bishop's mission being to apologise for words he had uttered when last in England on the presentation of his master's letters. It was he (the Bishop) who, out of bombastic arrogance and vainglory, had solicited the mission, boasting that he knew well the manner of dealing with the English, and would maintain and affirm that neither his masters letter, nor the words imputed to him on the presentation of it, bound the king of France in the least. To assist him in the disputation he had brought with him the above-mentioned councillor, who, however, did not quite share his opinion on the subject. And inasmuch as on the Bishop's arrival In England the King had treated him as his arrogance and vanity deserved, he (Monseigneur de Tarbes) had immediately after written for his congé, and had actually returned to France, leaving behind him the above-mentioned councillor named in the powers and commission to make a league defensive and offensive against all the World, the Pope and the king of Scotland included. Such was the King's explanation of the whole affair, and he ended by saying, with a gracious smile on his lips: \"It will be a good pastime for you to see the bird within his cage\" (fn. n26) On the 27th Don Diego and I went to dine at Cromwell's, where we met the King's deputies, namely, the archbishop of Canterbury (Cranmer), the Chancellor (Audeley), Suffoc (the duke of Suffolk), the Admiral and two Bishops. By way of \"Benedicite,\" and as a sort of introit to the repast, the abovementioned King's commissioners began unanimously to blame and ridicule the extravagant and mendacious promises which Frenchmen are in the habit of making. The dinner over, the commissioners met, and after a long discussion, at which my colleague and I were present, it was decided to send the King a written report of all that had been said at the meeting, the substance of which is: that the Emperor engaged to give the duchess of Milan in marriage to the king of England with the very same dower she had on her being wedded to the duke Francesco Sforza, and. in addition to that 15,000 ducats, as well as all her rights to the patrimonial estates of her father, besides jewels fit for her high rank. The lady's journey to England to be entirely at the Emperor's expense, who would besides try and procure that the duke Frederic, and his wife the duchess, should relinquish and cede the right they pretend to have to the crowns of Denmark, Norway, and Sweden, though with such indemnity as may be agreed upon between the Emperor and the interested parties. On the other side, the king of England is to grant the hand of the Princess, his daughter (Mary), to the Infante Dom Loys of Portugal with a suitable dower and jewels. The Infante to assign as security for the Princess' dower the fourth part of his own revenue, and more if necessary, calculating 5,000 ducats revenue for each 100,000 of the latter's dower. The Princess' journey to be defrayed by her own father, but the time and place of the delivery to be left entirely at the King's will and discretion, not at her future husband's. This last condition, however, was afterwards changed, for the King disapproved of the whole, so that nothing definitive was settled. My colleague and I have since been twice in communication with the commissioners, who, it must be said, instead of the many good things they offered us before the birth of the Prince (Edward), and when there was a hope of the Princess (Mary) inheriting the crown of England, have now proposed a dower of 100,000 ducats, and even then they wish to know what personal property the Infante Dom Loys owns, and on that account they attempted to leave the marriage in suspense, and only conclude that of the dowager duchess of Milan with this king, for which marriage they ask as a condition that Frederic should at once renounce in favor of the Duchess all his rights to the crowns of Denmark, Norway, and Sweden, without any indemnity or compensation whatever, and besides that the 15,000 cr. of the dowry should be consigned on the treasury of Flanders. The commissioners even moved that a separate article should be introduced into the marriage contract or in the treaty itself stipulating for the recovery of the arrears of pension owed to them by France, and, last not least, that should His Imperial Majesty give the duchy of Milan to the Infante Dom Loys, although, the King had offered to contribute towards the defence of that duchy, he would no longer consider himself bound to pay the Duchess' dower. The above will give Your Majesty an idea of the good intentions and honorable behaviour of these people; but I must not omit a circumstance which will darken still more the picture I have drawn of our negotiations. Twice or three times during the conferences this king's commissioners said, rather abruptly, to Don Diego and to me, without our giving them the least occasion for it, \"You two imagine, perhaps, that we ought to do anything the Emperor asks of us, out of fear of the meeting which is to take place at Nyoe (Nizza); but you are very much mistaken if you think so, for even if a league were formed against us, between the Pope, the Emperor, and the king of France, we should not care a fig for it\" This taunt of the privy councillors I take to be the very reverse of their present sentiments, unless they have entirely lost their senses, or keep close intelligence with the Lutherans and trust greatly in them. I must say, however, that since our diplomatic communications have been resumed, no agent, that I am aware of, has been sent to Germany. True is it that the other day, when Cromwell called on me, he owned that the King had just sent a personage to the coast of Denmark for the purpose of looking into the affairs of that country, and the disposition in which king Christiern was; but whatever he (Cromwell) may say, I suspect that the man is gone thither for some other object. Having eventually hinted to the King's commissioners at the end of our conferences that since our powers and instructions did not seem to them sufficiently ample and well founded, they might advise and persuade the King to send some one to Spain to treat directly with the Emperor, and that the person thus appointed would undoubtedly find him very reasonable and accommodating on all points; and that even in the case of the marriage alliances not taking place, there would still be great friendship and esteem for their master, they answered me that they did not think that this king would ever consent to such marriage alliances being discussed elsewhere than here, in England, and, therefore, that we ought to make up our mind not to be more advanced in the question than we were on the first day, and as to the friendship and esteem of which we had talked, that it would remain on the paper or vellum on which it was written, but not in the hearts; so would the good neighbourhood of the countries, though the sentiments and feelings of the people would be as alien to each other as if they lived at the opposite corners of the globe. Two days after the last conference the King dispatched a courier to Spain, secretly, so that Don Diego and I should not know of his departure, though we had previously been informed that he would not leave without letting us know; for having since sent to Cromwell two or three times to inquire when two doctors at law, whom this king was to send to the Emperor in Spain, were likely to take their departure, we could in nowise get an answer from him, nor ascertain what their names were until the day before their departure, although one week before it was known all over this city. Even Cromwell, to whom I have lately sent no less than three or four messages to know when I could see him at his office, has sent me word that he considered the negociations as altogether broken off, without the least hope of their being again resumed. If so, the doctors above alluded to are no doubt going to Spain for the purpose of justifying the mode of living of these people, of remonstrating against the convocation of the General Council, which, they pretend, is not within the Pope's province, and of alleging that the town of Vicenza is by no means a fit place for the meeting. I even presume that if the doctors do not succeed with their persuasions, they will have recourse to a protest. Indeed, this matter of the Council (fn. n27) is the thing this king dreads most, so much so that the King himself said to Don Diego and to me the other day, \"I cannot conceive why the Emperor wishes to do me such injury as to solicit the meeting of the General Council before the rest of the princes in Christendom have agreed to it, for the whole thing might then turn out to my discredit and shame. Supposing (said the King) that all Christian princes, some of their own free will, others out of shame, fear, or intrigue, attended the Council, which I myself do not intend to do, it would seem as if I wished to make a God of my own, apart and separate from the rest of Christendom, which, besides being a great shame, might bring great harm upon me. I do not percive any signs of satisfaction and contentment between these people and the French, nor have I been able to discover what Master Briant is about. He left this city three days ago, just about the time that the above-mentioned doctors departed for Spain; perhaps he came to guide, instruct, and model another young, though experienced, doctor, who is to reside at the court of France, and replace one of the ablest men of this kingdom, the bishop of Winchester.—London, xiii April 1538.

I hear from a good quarter that the ambassador of France, at his departure from this country, showed some dissatisfaction at the result of his last interview with this king's ministers about the 3rd ult.; from which time the latter ceased cajoling and frequently inviting him to court as they had done before. This, notwithstanding they have, as I am told, within the last fortnight dispatched three messengers to their ambassadors residing in France, though I do not believe that the cause of their being sent has any importance. (fn. n28) Lately, on his way to one of his manors, this king called on the Princess, his daughter, to whom he shows as much affection and love as he ever did, for no other purpose, as I imagine, than to gain credit, and persuade her that he has done more, and tendered more liberal offers than his paternal duties required, with regard to her proposed marriage to the infante Dom Loys, and at the same time make her believe that His Imperial Majesty had feebly supported him, and not behaved well in the matter, to the great disregard and discredit of the Princess, (fn. n29) who, as far as I can gather from the various messages she has sent me, has not only attached faith to the King's words, but begins to show great diminution of her trust and confidence in the Emperor, as well as inclination not to remain so staunch on various points, as she has hitherto been. (fn. n30) The man sent by this king to the assembly of Brunsuyt (Brunswick), arrived in this city a few days ago. Immediately after the King held a council, and was long in it. The man, however, has sent me word that he wished to see me at this embassy. I have given him an appointment, and if there be any means of ascertaining from him what he has been about, I shall not fail to apprise Your Majesty immediately. Just at this moment some one has come to tell me that the King is exceedingly displeased at his ambassadors at the court of France not having had audience for twenty days. The Venetian secretary having for the third time requested this king's help and assistance against the Turk, had the other day a very meagre answer. Indeed, it would seem as if he (the King) wished to make fun of him and his Signory, saying that Venice did not require assistance against the Turk, since she would sooner or later make peace with him. I fancy that by the King holding suck language to the Venetian secretary, he meant to imply that he rather wished the Emperor to be disappointed in that quarter, for immediately after he began to complain of the Signory having granted to his capital enemy, the Pope, the city of Vicenza to hold the General Council of the Church therein; adding several other reasons and arguments why the Signory might as well have refused, to give up Vicenza for that purpose as the duke of Mantua (Frederico Gonzaga) his capital, and thus prevented, for a time, the celebration of the Council.— London, 20 May 1538.

Our joint letter of the 8th of June, which Francois, the Piedmontese, this king's courier, took to Spain, must have informed Your Majesty of what has passed here between this king, the members of his Privy Council, and ourselves since the arrival of ambassador Huyet, (fn. n31) the mere perusal of which account will at once convince Your Majesty of the small appearance there is at present of any desirable or good issue of the negociations so long ago entrusted to our care. It is not to be supposed that this king, who has allowed us to communicate on two different occasions with his privy councillors, showed no desire of bringing the negociation to a close; but having no mandate or commission from Your Majesty to treat of, or solicit anything else, save what was expressly mentioned in Your Majesty's letter, we naturally limited ourselves to reading the same in the King's presence as a confirmation of what Your Majesty had said or caused to be said to his ambassador, Hoyet, who seemed very desirous of penetrating Your Majesty's intentions in the affair, for no other motive perhaps than his own gratification, or else to profit by the intelligence and communicate (fn. n32) the same, if not to the ambassadors of Saxony, and of the Landgrave [of Hesse], at least to that of the king of France here, who, all the while that my colleague and I were communicating with this king's privy councillors in Cromwell's rooms, was having audience from the King, who (we hear) caressed him immensely, and placed at his disposal four of his country seats, there to pass the summer, if he liked, besides giving him for his habitation the very house which Your Majesty occupied when you came here, which is now the usual residence of the said ambassador. (fn. n33) Since the 13th of the said month Cromwell has forwarded to us Your Majesty's letters of the 4th, inquiring at the same time whether we had received any instructions respecting the message brought by Master Hoyet, and begging us to excuse him if he did not communicate all the particulars of that ambassador's charge, inasmuch as the King (he said) had expressly forbidden him to do so, not from any mistrust he had of us, but because he found that, when requested to read in his Privy Council the whole of the letter received from Your Majesty and explanatory of the charge committed to Master Huyet, we, both Don Diego and I, had made scruples about it; and also because Your Majesty had confidentially said to his (the King's) ambassador many things to which there was no reference or allusion whatever in ours, and above all because in the present state of things he (the King) considered the said Master Huyet more Your Majesty's ambassador than his own. The substance of the King's answer, a draft of which has been shown to us, is that he (the King) takes in very good part Your Majesty's affectionate letter, as well as the kind sentiments expressed therein, to which it is his wish to correspond in every possible way; but that he begs to be excused if he does not immediately send the powers asked by Your Majesty. He could in nowise do so owing to the great importance of the affairs in question, and principally of the proposed defensive and offensive league, which requires to be clearly specified and defined, considering that the English are just now enjoying peace whilst Your Majesty is, as it were, in the midst of war, and owns, besides, vast dominions, which must be protected and defended from aggression not only on the part of a foreign enemy, but on the part of those who (the King says) are only your subjects in name. (fn. n34) Besides which, he (the King) has not by him a person sufficiently able to treat of such high matters, and, if he had, could not dispatch him with the haste required. The draft went on to say how the King considered himself wronged by the reduction to one half of the right to the crown of Denmark, which he pretends belongs entirely and exclusively to the dowager duchess of Milan, (fn. n35) for \"desirous as I am (says he) of the peace and union of all Christian princes, and having besides offered to become mediator in the dispute about Milan, it would not do for me so to meddle with the affairs of that duchy, or make any convention respecting the same from which a European war might result.\" (fn. n36) At the end of the draft there was a passage stating that the King hoped that even in the event of the proposed arrangements not taking place, Your Majesty would not disapprove of anything said or done by him pending the negociations. To the foregoing memorandum, the draft of which was shown to us [by Cromwell], our answer was that since the King looked upon Master Huyet more in the light of an Imperial ambassador than as one of his own, so might he look upon us two as if we were his own servants, and confidentially acquaint us with all the particulars of the verbal message brought by Master Huyet. Nevertheless, we said that we took in good part every thing that had been done or said, and should not fail to write home as it was the King's wish, and would do whatever else was in our power to promote the King's wishes in every way. And yet, I (Chapuys) added, both my colleague and I could not help thinking that the excuses alleged in the draft for the delay or suspension of the negociations on foot were futile enough, as we had stated the first time that we met the King's privy councillors. Our reasons then were—and are still—that the pretended inability of the bishop of Winchester (Gardiner), the putting aside of other points in order to treat exclusively of the two marriages were, in our opinion, very feeble and badly framed pretences to protract or suspend the negociations, and that Your Majesty, when informed of the whole, might easily suspect that the King had no desire to treat about the said marriages, —his own and that of the Princess, his daughter,—and that it was only owing to the rumour then current, that the Germans had also offered him other marriages, that he had seemingly stirred in the matter. (fn. n37) Indeed, it is a fact that about that time the King sent to Germany a painter (ung paintre) and one gentleman of his chamber, for the express purpose of pourtraying the personages \"au naturel\"; for, although Cromwell at first denied this, or at least dissembled, he afterwards owned to me (Chapuys) that the report was true, that both from France and from Germany several marriages had been proposed, and yet (said Cromwell on the occasion) \"the King, my master, is not one to many without having first seen and known the princess who is to be his companion for life.\" (fn. n38) Believe me, the affairs we have in hand are in better train than you imagine, much better than ever they were, and, therefore, it is for you two to continue doing good offices. We have not yet been able to ascertain what marriage alliances the Germans propose; some say that the son of the duke of Cleves for the Princess, and a kinswoman of his for the King, and that one of the two ambassadors above mentioned is soon to leave, whilst the other will wait for his return, or have news from him before he quits, (fn. n39) —London, 17 June 1538.

Diary of Occurrences during the Emperor's and King Francis' Interview close to Nizza. S. E., L. 3. It was considered certain for some time past that the proposed interview of our Emperor [Charles V.] and the king of France for the purpose of settling the peace between their respective kingdoms and dominions, would take place at Perpignan, owing to that town being only three leagues distant from the frontier of France, and close to the fortress of Salses, and town of Narbonne in the Roussillon. The Emperor, relying more on the activity (diligencia) generally displayed on such occasions than on the certainty of the interview taking effect, decided to go hastily (fn. n40) from Valladolid, where he was at the time, to Barcelona. Although, it was towards the end of December 1537, close upon Christmas Day, which he would have liked to spend with his Empress [Isabella of Portugal], yet he started on his journey, after ordering the marquis de Villena, (fn. n41) the duke of Najera, (fn. n42) the High Constable of Castille, (fn. n43) and the duke of Infantado (fn. n44) to get ready to accompany and serve him on that expedition. The above-said noblemen, therefore, after making great preparations, and summoning their relatives and kindred— in all which large sums of money were spent by them—left for Barcelona in January 1538. Then the Emperor wrote to them that his interview with king Francis was no longer to take place, and, therefore, that they had better return home, not without thanking them for the promptitude and readiness elicited in his service. On the receipt of which letter the Constable of Castille (Velasco), the marquis de Villena (Pacheco), and the duke del Infantado (Hurtado de Mendoza) went home, but the duke of Najera, accompanied by his brethren and uncles, and followed by the knights and menials of his own household, determined to prosecute his journey to Barcelona. On the road thither the Duke sent forward his own servant, Sancho de Villodas, at that time treasurer of Biscay, with the following message for the Emperor: \"Since he, the Duke, had been invited to attend a meeting for the sake of peace, and that peace did not take effect, whence most probably war would ensue; and since it had always been the habit of his ancestors to follow kings in their wars, he begged for permission to prosecute his journey to Barcelona and kiss the Emperor's hand, for being close to the Imperial presence it behoved him to know how he could serve his lord and master in peace or in war.\" The Emperor was much pleased with the Duke's message, and replied to it in gracious words accepting his services. On this occasion the infante of Portugal, Dom Luiz, (fn. n45) the Emperor's brother-in-law, arrived at Barcelona, where he was greatly grieved to hear of the death of the Infanta, his sister, duchess of Savoy. (fn. n46) The sad intelligence had come to Barcelona some days before Dom Luiz's arrival in that city; the Emperor knew of it, and had accordingly put on mourning. A fortnight afterwards, in order to console the Infante and relieve his mind, the Emperor ordered the duke of Najera to prepare a ladies' party, which gentlemen in masks might attend, so that He himself (the Emperor) and the Infante might mix unknown with the rest of the company. The Duke did as he was told, and on a certain night got together as many as 50 among the principal ladies of Barcelona, richly dressed in brocaded silks of various colours. This was easily accomplished owing to the Duke being a great favourite at Barcelona, and his having many kindred and relatives thereat. To 12 knights and courtiers, moreover, whom the Emperor was pleased to designate, blue velvet robes lined with yellow satin, hats of the same with white feathers, and masks were given. All were dressed alike, and their names were the Emperor himself, the Infante, Dom Luiz of Portugal, the duke of Najera, the duke of Albuquerque, (fn. n47) the duke de Vero (fn. n48) from Portugal, Don Francisco d'Este, brother of the duke of Ferrara (Alfonso), the admiral of Naples, Monsieur de Bossu, the Emperor's Master of the Horse, Don Pedro de la Cueva, (fn. n49) High Commander of Alcantara, Don Luis de Avila, and Monsieur de Pelu, falconete. (fn. n50) When night came, all the above named repaired to the house where the ball and masquerade were to take place, and there, in a spacious hall, each gallant conversed with the lady he preferred, or danced with her to the music of sackbuts, clarions, and other wind instruments. (fn. n51) In this manner was the greater part of the night consumed, when upwards of 40 more masks came in, all of them courtiers, who were so much engaged talking to, and dancing with, the ladies that they actually forgot the supper hour. At midnight the Emperor and the Infante, Dom Luys, went into an adjoining room and supped together at the same table. Another one was reserved for the ladies, and a third for the lords and knights, &c. So abundant was the supper, consisting of all manner of domestic and wild birds, as well as of dishes of all kinds, that the quantity of food which remained untouched was far greater than that wanted in the first instance for the entertainment. Alter this the duke of Alburquerque prepared another feast of the same kind, which took place four days after, although it must be said that as the Duke was not so popular, nor had as many friends, as he of Najera, the ball was far from being so well attended by the Barcelonese ladies, with whom, however, the Duke and the rest of the courtiers managed to dance, talk, and chaff as well as on the former occasion. The Emperor and the Infante were also present. Frequently did it happen that the former, after talking for a while to a lady, declared to her who he was, and took off his mask that she might recognise him, and yet the lady no doubt dissembling, persisted in treating him as if he were a simple knight and she knew nothing of him. Ten days after this the Emperor ordered the duke of Najera to prepare another entertainment, always with a view to cheer and amuse the Infante Dom Luyz. This time tilting with reed-spears and running at the ring (fn. n52) was the order of the day. Accordingly, the Duke gave to Monsieur de Bossu, the Master of the Horse, to the Adelantado de Galicia, to Don Miguel de Velasco, to Don Luys de Avila, to Monsieur de Pelu, to the Baron de la Laguna, to Don Juan de Mendoza, to Don Juan de Bogados (Boxadors?), to Don Antonio de Ril (d'Eril), to Don Alvaro de Madrigal, and to several other gentlemen, vestments of rich yellow satin lined with white silk, and furbelows of the same, as well as harness and trappings for their horses, (fn. n53) of white satin lined with yellow taffeta, besides tufts of white silk for the top of their helmets. (fn. n54) In this manner did several knights tilt or run at the ring. Whenever the Duke did better than his opponent he gained no jewel, as customary in such cases; but, on the other hand, if any of the other players had an advantage in every four runs over his rival, he received forthwith one of the many gold gems previously sent by the Duke to the field for that purpose. This accounts for the entertainment to which I allude having cost the Duke so much money. After the ring, in which several knights and noblemen took part, there was a tournament, and a sham fight on horseback with swords. Both the Emperor and the Infante of Portugal (Dom Luys) attended, this latter leaving some days after for his own country. Meanwhile, Pope Paul III. having heard that the proposed interview at Perpignan would not take place, and fearing lest by the negociation between the Emperor and the king of France remaining in suspense, still greater enmity should be engendered in the hearts of those princes—whence much .scandal and injury might ensue for Christendom—decided, as the peace-maker and good shepherd that he is, to interpose and send to each of them a legate to try and persuade them to hold an interview at Nizza (Nice), a town belonging to the duke of Savoy; His Holiness at the same time offering to be present at the conferences. Both Emperor and King, aware of Pope Paul's righteous intentions, agreed to the interview, and His Holiness, notwithstanding his old age and infirmities, as well as the length of the journey to be undertaken—Nizza being upwards of 80 leagues distant from Rome by land, and 150 miles by sea—determined to go thither and attend the interview. Whilst its form and time were being discussed and settled the Emperor decided to visit Perpiñan (Perpi"
