Some member of the Spanish nobility possess various titles that may be inherited or not, but the creation and recognition of titles is legally the prerogative of the monarchy of Spain.\n\nMany Spanish titles and noble families still exist which have transmitted their aristocratic status since the Middle Ages. Some aristocratic families in Spain use the nobiliary particle de before their family name, although this was more prominent before the 20th century. During the rule of Francisco Franco in Spain, some new hereditary titles were conferred on individuals, and titles granted by Carlist pretenders were officially recognised."
