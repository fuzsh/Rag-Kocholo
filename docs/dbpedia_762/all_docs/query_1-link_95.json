        "text": "Language and other elements that constitute culture should be treated as independent variables when trying to understand late pre-Hispanic and early colonial central Mexican society. At the time of the Spanish conquest, native kingdoms in this region were inhabited by speakers of several languages belonging to diverse linguistic families. The majority languages were Nahuatl and Otomi. A comparative study of the words used in these languages to express concepts from several semantic fields reveals an abundance of calques, or semantic loans devoid of phonological correspondence. In this study, which draws on fifteen years of research on central Mexican culture, language, and writing, examples of calques will be presented from six semantic fields: toponyms, anthroponyms, names of deities, calendrical terms, social structures, and metaphorical couplets. This research reveals a high degree of cultural unity between these two language groups, forcing us to rethink the relationships between language, culture, and ethnicity. The abundance of calques between these and other native languages is the cultural basis for the fundamentally semasiographic system of pictorial writing used throughout much of Mesoamerica; most of the graphic signs in this system of notation can be read in any of the languages spoken by groups that participated in Mesoamerican culture."
