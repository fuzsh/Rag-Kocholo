        "text": "SOUTH AMERICAN DECORATIONS AND WAR MEDALS\n\nBy Harrold E. Gillingham\n\nMany of the war medals and decorations of the South American Republics are concerned with their struggle for independence from Spain . Some knowledge of the causes of this struggle is fitting—the difficulties of stating these causes briefly will be obvious, but the necessity for such a statement as a starting point must suffice as a reason for attempting it. The success of the revolution of the thirteen colonies in North America seems to have had less direct influence in initiating the struggle for independence than the conditions in Spain . In 1808, upon the abdication of Charles IV, Ferdinand VII was proclaimed king in each Spanish-American capital. Shortly thereafter however, and in some places before the proclamation of Ferdinand's accession, emissaries arrived with letters from the Ministers and Council of the Indies, announcing the abdication of Ferdinand, and the confirmation of all the governors and officials by Joseph Napoleon, the new king. This aroused intense opposition. The French successes in the peninsula, however, left the colonies with the suspicion that Spanish power had disintegrated, and the subsequent action of the royalists of Spain and the Spanish Cortes only added to the confusion. A number of leaders who had been working toward independence were quick to seize the opportunity, and in first one capital and then in another, organizations were effected and revolutionary agencies set in motion.\n\nThe Spanish rule was centered in important cities in which Viceroys appointed by Spain were in authority, supported by garrisons of soldiery. The body of citizenry aside from the native Indians was composed largely of European emigrés, many of whom had long been settled in the country and some of whom had inter-married with Negro blood. This Creole population exploited the Indian natives wherever possible and in consequence the natives looked to the Spanish authority for what redress it was possible for them to obtain, and remained sympathetic to the Spanish rather than to the revolutionary cause in most districts. Climatic and geographical surroundings played an important part in the ultimate division of the continent into republics—frequently a nationalistic division would have been hard to discover. The struggle in the south was successful earlier than that in the equatorial section where the leadership of Bolivar, after countless reversals, was to be triumphant.\n\nAfter the achievement of the independence from Spain there were frequent upheavals. Many were of a purely local nature, some being due to individual ambition or assertiveness and some being little more than neighborly quarrels over boundaries or privileges. Occasionally the struggles were bloody ones, but the distances to be overcome sufficiently increased the difficulties of warfare under tropical or semi-tropical conditions to prevent many movements on a large scale. In addition, the problems of financing any prolonged conflict wielded an even greater influence.\n\nThe decorations issued under such circumstances are of necessity of a more or less makeshift nature, and the record of them is often difficult to obtain, and is sometimes to be had only from the decoration itself. As more stable conditions were brought about the record becomes clearer. It will be seen, that accuracy of statement with regard to some of these decorations is impossible, and that difference in descriptions of awards is to be expected. In the following accounts of decorations awarded by South American republics, a citation is made of the authority responsible for the statements recorded, and this is supported wherever possible by photographic reproduction of the respective medals.\n\nThe object of this monograph is to treat only of the medallic awards—those which were made to be worn on the person—and not the embroidered insignia of honour given by some governments of Latin America .\n\nMany of the Spanish-American countries awarded to their military heroes, in place of a medal, an Escudo or embroidered shield or plaque. These varied in size, design and colour, but all were excellently executed, being usually embroidered in gold thread on a brilliant background of silk, such as light or dark blue, or red; and sometimes on a white or black ground. The contrast of the gold on the coloured silk made quite as distinguishing a decoration as a silver or gold medal such as many of the European countries bestow.\n\nOne of the earliest of such escudos was awarded by the government of Buenos Aires for the troops taking part in the battle of Tupiza in Upper Peru November 7, 1810. It was an oval, 2 × 2½ inches, of white silk embroidered with a silver corded edge, within which was the inscription also in silver cord, LA PATRIA A LOS VENCEDORES DE TUPIZA.\n\nAnother attractive escudo is that given by the same authority for the battle against the Spanish forces at the estate called \"La Florida,\" on the banks of the river Piray in Upper Peru on November 9, 1814. This too is of white silk, heart-shaped, 2¾ inches, × 2½ embroidered with light blue silk. The outer edge represents a laurel wreath, then the motto A LOS VENCEDORES EN LA FLORYDA, then a corded border. In the centre are two crossed palm branches and three stars, the whole making a most attractive insignia of honour, when sewed on the breast of the uniform coat.\n\nThis form of decoration varied in size from an oval 2 × 1½ inches to 3½ × 2¾ inches. As they were attached to the uniform they naturally soiled easily and were not well preserved; hence they are not often to be found by the collector, even though awarded as late as 1872. (Rosa, Leyes , p. 130.)\n\nSome of these shields or escudos were made of metal and worn on the uniform's coat-sleeve. These were generally awarded to the troops. It is the intention to include herein all such metallic awards, where information is obtainable.\n\nDuring the Spanish Colonial period in America many medals and decorations of honour were awarded to the royalist troops. Some of these were authorized by the home government in Spain , such as the Order of St. Ferdinand, the Order of Isabella the Catholic, the Cross for Carthagena de las Indias and many others for Cuba and Puerto Rico . These will not be included here, having already been described in Spanish Orders of Chivalry and Decorations of Honour.\n\nThe intention of the writer is to include herein only those decorations for military services which were issued in South America , first by the local Spanish authorities and later by the several republics, after they had obtained their independence. Before the separation of the several colonies, many medals and escudos were authorized by the various Viceroys and Captains General, who apparently did not need the sanction of the home government to reward the royalist forces. Most of these were designed and executed within the several colonies, and but little information concerning them is obtainable. Possibly the records were destroyed during or after the various wars for independence; it would be natural that the patriots should wish to obliterate all reminders of the Spanish regime, under which they had suffered.\n\nIn preparing a record such as this, one succeeds only with the help of one's friends. To the officers of South American countries who have provided information, and to the consular officers of the United States who have aided, grateful acknowledgement is hereby made. To Charles H. Roberts, Esq., of Buenos Aires, I would express deep appreciation for valuable assistance. To Mr. Sydney P. Noe I am deeply indebted—without his help these pages might never have been completed.\n\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\n\nThis list comprises works consulted for data.

In the last quarter of the 18th century the Colonies of the Plata included all of the country now known as Argentina, Bolivia, Uruguay, Paraguay, and the Pacific provinces later ceded to Chile by Bolivia and Peru . The capital was Buenos Aires. The revolution for freedom from Spanish rule was started May 25, 1810, under a provisional junta, and six years later the independence of the United Provinces of the Rio de La Plata was proclaimed. In January, 1825, these became the Argentine Republic or Confederation. From 1835 to 1852, part of the country was under the Dictatorship of Juan Manuel de Rosas. Buenos Aires separated itself from the Confederation in 1852; seven years later, however, it rejoined the Republic of Argentina. By the treaty of 1881, Patagonia and Terra-del-Fuego were divided between Argentina and Chile .\n\nThe Republic of Argentina authorized many awards to officers and soldiers—embroidered shields or plaques, cordons and other evidences of honour; these are omitted from this paper as the intention is to treat only of the medallic awards worn on the person, and conferred for military services.\n\nMEDAL FOR PERDRIEL. This was authorized September 5, 1806, for those who took part in the engagement at the village of Perdriel, 22 km. from the Capital. The English forc.es under General William Beresford attempted to seize Buenos Aires in June and July of that year. It is a cast, oval medal, 32 × 22 mm., surmounted by a ribbon or fillet of the same metal. The obverse displays the arms of the city of Buenos Aires, two sailing ships, with a dove of peace in the upper field and an anchor in the lower. On the ribbon is UaTs RCoQsTds de Bs Aa . (Voluntarios Reconquistadores de Buenos Aires.)\n\nPremios Militares, III, p. 128; Rosa, Monetario, p. 68, illus.; Rosa, Leyes , p. 5; Rosa, Med. Arg., p. 23, illus.\n\nMEDAL FOR BUENOS AIRES, 1807. Authorized January 13, 1809, by a decree of the Junta of Seville, acting in the name of Ferdinand VII for the Spanish troops who had defended the city of Buenos Aires at the time of the second English invasion of that section in July, 1807, when General Whitelock, with a force of 8000 British troops attempted to seize the city and territory, but failed in his endeavour owing to the strenuous resistence of the Spanish colonial forces. This attempt was brought about through the alliance of Spain and France against England , following the French Revolution, when British commerce with Buenos Aires was interrupted.\n\nThe medal, of gold or silver, is oval in shape, 49 × 30 mm.; it bears on the obverse the head of the Spanish king facing to the right, and the inscription FERNANDO VII REY DE ESPANA Y DE LAS INDIAS 1808.\n\nARGENTINA PL. I\n\nPerdriel Tupiza\n\nBuenos Aires Aruhuma\n\nOn the reverse is a laurel wreath within which are crossed palm and laurel branches encircled by VIRTUD Y BALOR PREMIADO EN BUENOS AYRES, and in small letters \"EN POTOSI,\" for the mint in which, according to this inscription, the medals were struck. Potosi at that time, was one of the most celebrated silver mining towns in the world. It lies about 13,000 feet above sea level, at the foot of the rich Cerro de Potosi, in territory now belonging to Bolivia.\n\nPremios Militares, III, p. 138; Rosa, Leyes, p. 9; Medina, Medallas Coloniales, p. 72, illus.; Rosa, Med. Arg., p. 30, illus.\n\nMEDAL FOR TUPIZA, 1810. Five months after having declared its independence, Argentine troops under Colonel Antonia González Balcarce, advanced into Upper Peru (now Bolivia) and met a force of Spanish troops under General José de Cordoba y Rosas, at the mining town of Tupiza, near the Argentine border. An engagement took place on November 7, 1810. To reward the troops taking part, the Provincial Junta authorized this oval, uniface, bronze-gilt medal, 42 × 33 mm., November 29,1810. It bears in the center LA PATRIA A LOS VENCEDORs DE TUPIZA. Above is a radiant sun; the whole is enclosed by the legend ACCION DE GUERRA DEL 7 DE NO VI EMB RE DE 1810, and a laurel wreath. The top of the oval is a scroll of ribbon for a suspension loop. The ribbon is half light blue and half white.\n\nPremios Militares, I, p. 171–174; Rosa, Leyes, p. 12; Rosa, Med. Arg., p. 42, illus.\n\nMEDAL FOR ARUHUMA, 1810. This was awarded the troops for the second victory over the royalists on the field of Aruhuma, in the state of Cochabamba, a central province of Bolivia. It is an oval, silver medal, 27 × 24 mm., in the center of which a radiant sun above palm and laurel branches is encircled by P(or) L(a) PATRIA ALOS FIELES L.(ibertadors) D(e) COCHABANBA; outside the inscription is a wreath. The medal is uniface.\n\nPremios Militares, I, p. 189; Rosa, Med. Arg., p. 39, illus.\n\nMEDAL FOR RIO DE LAS PIEDRAS, 1812. While assisting the insurgents of Upper Peru (Bolivia), in driving the royalist forces from the country, a minor engagement took place on the Rio de las Piedras, on September 3, 1812. No authority has been found for the issuance of this medal, but a specimen is in the National Historical Museum of Buenos Aires—an oval, bronze-gilt medal, 50x40 mm. At the center of the obverse is the word LIBERTAD; above this there is a radiant sun and below, a lance and laurel branch crossed. The legend is LA PATRIA RECONCIDA A SUS NATURs BENEMERITOS HIJOS *. The reverse is plain.\n\nPremios Militares, I, p. 202.\n\nMEDAL FOR SALTA, 1813. Salta, a city founded in 1582, was an old bishopric in the province of the same name in the northwestern part of Argentina, i. e., south of Jujuy, near the Chilean border. It was on the original trade route from the Peruvian mines to the sea, via the Rio Salado and the Rio de la Plata. At Salta, General Manuel Belgrano (1770–1823) won a victory over the Spanish forces, February 20, 1813, during the revolution for independence.\n\nThis medal was authorized March 5, 1813, by the Assembly of the United Provinces of Rio de la Plata. It is an oval of gold or silver, 51 × 40 mm., and bears the early arms of the republic—clasped hands surmounted by a liberty cap on a curved sabre within olive and palm branches; the inscription is LA PATRIA A LOS VENCEDORES EN SALTA EN 20. DE. FEBRO. DE. 1813* .\n\nIn Medallas Coloniales Hispano–Americanos, p. 98, Medina describes an oval, silver medal, 30 × 23 mm., surmounted by a royal crown and edged with palm and laurel branches, having at the center * POR SU LEALTAD Y CONSTANCIA surrounded by EMIGDO. DE LA PROV. DE SALTA EN 26 DE FEB. DE 1814 *. This medal is uniface.

It bears in the obverse center, an oval on which are the arms of the province—(two inverted arrows and an upright spear tied with a ribbon, and nine stars), and the legend REVOLUCION DEL 30 DE JULIO DE 1893. The reverse inscription is VALOR CONSTANCIA PATRIOTISMO, encircled by EL PUEBLO DE LA PROVINCIA A SU DEFENSOR. No description of the ribbon has been obtained.\n\nRosa, Med. Arg., p. 358, illus.\n\nBOLIVIA\n\nThe earlier history of Bolivia is inseparable from that of Peru . In the Spanish Colonial period it was called Upper Peru , and was part of the vice-royalty of Peru . Bolivia became independent in 1829, and was united with Peru from 1836 to 1839; a separation was forced by Chile who feared the federation. Bolivia was attacked by Chile in 1879, and for four years carried on a war in which she was assisted by Peru .\n\nBecause of Bolivia's connection with Peru , some writers have classed as Bolivian certain medals which we believe to belong to Peru , and the reader is referred to those recorded under the latter country for an inclusive list.\n\nThe geographical position of Bolivia imposed on that country all of the disadvantages of isolation, even in times of peace. In consequence, we find that decorations of the country bear evidences that they are of native manufacture and not highly finished. Most of them seem to have been made at the national mint at Potosi. They partake of the nature of the coins issued there, in the making of which the Potosi mint had long been engaged.\n\nIn the Cabinet of the American Numismatic Society there is a collection of seal impressions from medal-dies still in possession of the Bolivian mint and from these it is possible to deduce something about the making of these medals. The illustration of the Medal for Socabaya will disclose a radiant star, silver gilt, and a planchet of silver bearing the same star from the same dies. This star must have been struck first in the circular form and the plain segments then cut away, leaving the star as it is now seen. Another medal in which the same procedure seems to have maintained is the decoration for Ingavi. It is not certain whether the medals were issued in the round form and later cut out by the individuals to whom they were awarded or whether there may have been no intention of having them altered from the original rounded form. It is hoped that further details regarding this procedure may be brought to light.\n\nMEDAL FOR AYOHUMA, 1815. The battle of Ayohuma, near Potosi, was one of the engagements lost by the revolutionists during the struggle for independence. General Manuel Belgrano (1770–1820), led the Bolivian-Argentine forces against those of Spain . The Spanish medal for this engagement, awarded by General Joaquin de la Pezuela, is a silver rhomboid, 54 × 39 mm., having around the sides RECUPERO LAS PROV D POTOSI Y CHARCAS1 EN LA BATALLA, and in the center is A YOHUMA 14 DE NOVRE DE 1815.\n\nMedina, Medallas Coloniales, p. 98, No. 73.\n\nBOLIVIAN MEDAL FOR AYACUCHO, 1824. This was authorized by a decree of the independent government issued from the capital at Chuquisaca, August 11, 1825. It was awarded to the patriot troops under Bolivar and General Sucre for their victory over the Spanish forces led by the Viceroy La Serna, at Ayacucho on December 9, 1824.\n\nIt is an oval, gold or silver medal, 42 × 36 mm., bearing on the obverse the mountain of Potosi, with a trophy of arms and flags in pyramidal form, on which is a figure (of Bolivar) holding a staff bearing a liberty cap. In the exergue is POTOSI , and in the upper field a radiant sun. On the reverse, within laurel branches, is LA REPUBLICA BOLIVAR AGRADECIDA AL HEROE CUYO NOMBRE LLEVA. See also Peru .\n\nRosa, in his Coleccion de Leyes, Decretos, etc., 1891, and in Monetario Americano, 1892, classes this as for Ayacucho; while his Numismatica, 1904, places it under Potosi.\n\nRosa, Leyes, p. 292–293.\n\nMEDAL FOR COBIJA, 1825. Cobija, or Puerto la Mar, a seaport town and formerly Bolivia's port, is now part of the Chilean province of Antofagasta. This is an oval silver medal, 34 × 30 mm., awarded to the Bolivian troops taking part in the war for independence.\n\nBOLIVIA PL. I\n\nAyacucho\n\nCallao\n\nCobija 1825\n\nThe obverse bears the early form of the arms of Bolivia with BOLIVIA A S US DEFENSORES above, and six stars below. The reverse edge is beaded and in the lower field is an oval of rope, within which is a sailing ship; above this is EN COBIJA. A variant has on the reverse the seated figure of Justice, holding a sword in the right, and scales in her left hand.\n\nFonrobert, No. 9745.\n\nCROSS FOR CALLAO, 1826. Awarded by President Antonio José Sucre (1793–1830), to the Bolivian troops aiding in the defence of Callao, Peru , against the Spanish. The decoration is a green-enamelled cross of six arms, bearing on the obverse medallion the head of the president encircled by a band inscribed BOL A LOS VENC DEL CALLAO . On the reverse are the arms of Bolivia. The ribbon is red, blue and white.\n\nMEDAL FOR CALLAO, 1826. This is an oval silver medal, 32 × 30 mm., with beaded border, bearing on the obverse center a tower with a soldier on a ladder; on its base RENDIDO EL CALLAO AL VALOR SIN EJEMPLO. On the reverse, within palm and laurel branches, is a tower from which a flag is flying; above is TOMA DEL CALLAO , and below ANO DE 1826.\n\nCROSS OF BOLIVAR. No authority mentions the creation of this decoration, of which in Schul- man's catalogue of February 9, 1926 (No. 64), a pattern piece was described. A silver medal, 33 mm., in the form of a double-pointed, five-armed cross, with rays in the angles bears in the obverse center the bust of Bolivar facing to the right, and LIBERTADOR SIMON BOLIVAR . On the reverse are the arms of Bolivia and REPUBLICA BOLIVIANA.\n\nMEDAL OF BOLIVAR. A pattern for an oval, silver medal is known. It is 33 × 28 mm., and bears on the obverse the bust of Bolivar in uniform, facing to right; above is the inscription, A SU LIBERTADOR SIMON BOLIVAR . On the reverse are the arms with six stars below, and REPUBLICA BOLIVIANA above. A variant has for the obverse inscription, * SIMON BOLIVAR LIBERTADOR DE COLOMBIA Y Peru PADRE DE BOLIVIA. Still another variant, 35 × 30 mm., has on the reverse the arms of Bolivia, with six stars below, encircled by the inscription, EL SENADO RECONOCE LOS GRANDES SERVICIOS DE SU GRAN CUIDADANO* .\n\nFonrobert, No. 9458; Salbach, No. 1554.\n\nMEDAL OF MERIT. This is a gold or silver medal, 46 mm. in diameter, having on the obverse the uniformed bust of Bolivar facing right, and in the field PREM10 DEL VALOR.\n\nSalbach, No. 1555.\n\nMEDAL FOR YANACOCHA, 1835. During this year two political factions were struggling for control of Peru , and Santa Cruz went to the aid of the Peruvians, defeating Gamarra at Yanacocha, August 13, 1835. One silver medal, 35 mm. in diameter, bears on the obverse a sunburst in the center of which are the early arms of Bolivia, with REPUBLICA BOLIVIANA above and six stars below; and on the reverse center within a circle is AUClLIANDO AL Peru *, with the field inscribed, EN 13 DE AGOSTO D 1835. See also medals described under Peru .\n\nA variation of this medal is a silver oval, 32 × 27 mm., having on the obverse VENCEDOR EN YANACOCHA within a palm and laurel wreath, and on the reverse the combined arms of Bolivia and Peru .\n\nIn Schulman's catalogue of the Salbach Sale a round silver medal, 29 mm. in diameter is listed. It bears on the obverse the arms of Argentina on a seven-pointed star which in turn is enclosed by another seven-pointed star ball-tipped with curved arms; and on the reverse, within a circle, VENCI EN YANACOCHA , superimposed on a twelvearmed double-pointed cross. It is said to have been awarded to Argentine troops.\n\nFonrobert, No. 9263; Rosa, Monetario , p. 211, Nos. 716, 717, illus.; Salbach, No. 2372.\n\nCROSS FOR SOCABAYA, 1836. In 1835, a factional war took place in Peru , and Bolivian troops were sent into that country by President Santa Cruz.1\n\nBOLIVIA PL. II\n\nMedal of Merit Yanacocha 1835\n\nThey were victorious over the forces of Gamarra, at Socabaya, Peru , February 7, 1836. About this time Chile sent troops to the assistance of Peru , and after three years of warfare, the Bolivian forces were defeated at Jungay, in June, 1839, and Santa Cruz exiled. The Bolivian decoration for the battle of Socabaya, is a white-enamelled star of five points, superimposed on a green oak wreath, having in the white medallion, 7 DE FEBR DE 1836, encircled by a red band inscribed VENCEDOR EN SOCABAYA . On the reverse medallion are the arms of Bolivia.2 The ribbon is green, red and green.\n\nSalbach, No. 1555a.\n\nMEDAL FOR SOCABAYA 1836. This is an oval silver or bronze medal, 30 × 26 mm., having on the obverse an oval of rays and dots, within which is a dove holding a laurel branch in its beak, and below DI LA PAZ AL Peru . On the reverse, within palm and laurel branches is an oval inscribed EN SOCABAYA A 7. DE FEBRER DE 1836.\n\nEnd Notes\n\n1\n\nAndres Santa Cruz was an Indian statesman. His mother was a lady of high rank, of the family of the Incas. Of this he was very proud. While not a successful military leader, he possessed great administrative ability, and for nearly three years (1836–1839) he realized his dream of a confederation between Peru and Bolivia.\n\n2\n\nThe arms of Bolivia at this time were a banded oval at the top of which is BOLIVIA, and below, nine stars, surmounted by a condor on a wreath; the whole superimposed on draped flags. In the center of the oval are three mountain peaks, before which are a llama, a tree and a sheaf of wheat; in the upper field a sun.\n\nBOLIVIA PL. III\n\nSocabaya 1836 Ingavi 1841\n\nA variant of this medal has on the obverse the arms of Bolivia, above which is LA PATRIA PREMIA UN BUEN SERVICIO, while still another variety has on the obverse the combined arms of Bolivia and Peru , with a reverse similar to the first described obverse above.\n\nA larger silver medal, 42 mm. in diameter, was struck, having on the obverse a five-armed, double-pointed cross superimposed upon a laurel wreath, bearing in the circular centre a dove holding a laurel wreath, encircled by band inscribed DI LA PAZ AL Peru . On the reverse is a small circular medallion inscribed EN SOCABAYA A 7 DE FEBRERO with DE 1836 in the centre.\n\nThe dies for the above described medals are now at the Bolivian mint at Potosi.\n\nCROSS OF Peru , 1836. This decoration, awarded after the Peru -Bolivian Alliance of 1836–1839, is classed by some writers with the Peruvian war decorations. It is a silver cross of five arms, 55 mm., enamelled white, having in the center medallion a figure of Peace in gold on a blue field, encircled by a white band inscribed in gold DI LA PAZ AL Peru . On the reverse, in gold on a blue field, is A NO 1836, encircled by a band inscribed GRATITUD AL EJERCITO BOLIVIANO.

No. 9516.\n\nCROSS FOR INGAVI (Yngavi), 1841. In August, 1841, President Augustin Gamarra (1785–1841) of Peru , attempted to invade Bolivia and annex the rich province of La Paz. He besieged the capital, but in a battle with the Bolivians, led by General (later President) José Ballivian (1804–1852), at Ingavi, on the 18th of November, 1841, Gamarra himself was killed and his troops routed. Ballivian then attempted to invade Peru , but was prevented by Chilean interference.\n\nThe Bolivians taking part in this engagement seem to have been awarded a variety of decorations.\n\nIn the National Historical Museum of Buenos Aires is a decoration which is said to have belonged to Colonel Juan Andres del Campo. It is gold, in the form of a six-armed cross, double-pointed, and enamelled in the Bolivian national colours, superimposed on a green-enamelled laurel wreath. On the obverse center medallion is the column, or monument of Ingavi, surmounted by a radiant sun; around the whole on a red-enamelled band is inscribed SALVE LA PATRIA Y SU GLORIA EN INGA VI. On the reverse medallion are three mountain peaks with 18 DE NOVIEMBRE DE 1841. The suspension ring is an oval laurel wreath.\n\nThe Marco del Pont collection has a similar decoration in silver and Casa Pardo have one of gold without enamel, while the American Numismatic Society possesses a specimen of brass, 34 mm. in size.\n\nAnother variety is a double-pointed, four-armed cross, of black enamel, with rays in the angles and similar designs and inscriptions on medallions; while a third cross is in the collection of Mr. C. H. Roberts of Buenos Aires. This is a silver fourarmed cross, enamelled white, superimposed on a green wreath of laurel surmounted by a flat laurel wreath, but with an obverse bearing the column of Ingavi encircled by a red-enamelled band inscribed VENCI EN INGA VI.\n\nStill another variant exists in the Municipal Museum of Buenos Aires, which is a five-armed cross as first described, with the obverse inscription reading VENCI EN YANACOCHA AUXILIAN DO AL Peru , and the reverse legend INGA VI 18 DE NOVIEMBRE DE 1841. Other variations seem to have been made, but the differences are not sufficiently distinctive to warrant their description.\n\nFilatel. Argen ., May 1927, p. 602; Revista Filatelica, December 1928, p. 8; Sculfort, No. 1231.\n\nMEDAL FOR INGAVI, 1841. While no decree authorizing these medals has been found, several have been described in auction catalogues, and some are displayed in the National Museum at Buenos Aires. One is an oval, silver medal, 45 × 40 mm., bearing on the obverse shield crossed cannon and the arms of the republic, encircled by REPUBLICA BOLIVIANA, and on the reverse within laurel branches, YNGA VI 18 DE NOVIEMBRE 1841. Another round medal, 43 mm. in diameter, has on the obverse SALVE LA PATRIA Y SU GLORIA EN ENGAVI, and on the reverse, within laurel branches, 18 DE NOVIEMBRE DE 1841.\n\nAnother similar medal bearing a four-armed cross of the same size with three club-rays in each of the angles, and a smaller six-armed cross with the tips of the arms joined by a wreath, both with the inscriptions given above, may be pattern pieces.\n\nSchulman, in the Eyndhoven catalogue of March 17, 1924, illustrates, under No. 2453, a silver medal of same size, having on the obverse, within an eight-pointed star, the monument and ten mountain peaks, encircled by the inscription PREMIO DE HONOR, while the reverse has, within a laurel wreath, YNGA VI 18 DE NOVIEMBRE 1841.\n\nRosa, in Monetario Americano, No. 718, describes still another variety—a silver medal, 45 mm. in diameter, having on the obverse a five-armed cross with curvilinear arms, ball-tipped, and with rays in the angles. On the center medallion are the combined arms of Bolivia and Peru , encircled with the inscription VENCI EN YANACOCHA *AUCILIANDO AL Peru * , and on the reverse, within a laurel wreath, YNGA VI 18 DE NOVIEMBRE 1841.\n\nFonrobert, Nos. 9790, 9791, 9792, 9794; Rosa, Monetario , p. 212, No. 718 illus.\n\nPOTOSI MEDAL, 1857. In September, 1857, Dr. José Maria Linares started a revolution to overthrow General Jorge Cordova as President. In this he was successful; Cordova was compelled to leave the country and Linares became Dictator, but fresh disturbances took place and he too was deposed in 1861. To reward the troops taking part in the revolutionary movement, these oval, silver and gilt medals, 36 × 30 mm., were issued by the City of Potosi.\n\nThere seem to be three varieties of these medals, the first (a gilt medal in the collection of the American Numismatic Society) has on the obverse center three mountain peaks encircled by a garland of flowers, above which is a radiant all-seeing eye. Below are military trophies and a liberty cap. On the upper border is DIOS PROTEJE LA CAUSA D LOS PUEBLOS. In the lower border are nine stars. On the reverse, within a laurel wreath, is LOS HIJOS DE POTOSI A SUS HERMANOS LOS DEFENSORES DE LA CAUSA NACIONAL EN 20 DE OCTUBRE 1857.\n\nBOLIVIA PL. IV\n\nMedal for 1865\n\nPotosi 1857\n\nCallao Cross 1866\n\nA silver variety illustrated by Schulman in the Eyndhoven catalogue of March 17, 1924 (No. 2450), has the same obverse as above, but on the reverse is a radiant sun in the upper field, below which is LOS HIJOS DE POTOSI A SUS HERMANOS LOS DEFENSORES DE LA CA USA NACIONAL EN.\n\nThere is a variant of this medal with the same reverse as the Eyndhoven medal, but with a different obverse. Above the center design are nine stars, and below the inscription EN 20 OCTUBRE DE l857.\n\nFonrobert (No. 9620) describes a medal with a reverse inscribed CONSEJO DE ESTADO within two laurel branches tied below. The obverse for this piece is like that of the variant immediately preceding.\n\nFonrobert, Nos. 9620, 9621; Sculfort, No. 1230.\n\nMEDAL FOR 1865. The revolution which took place under the leadership of General Maria Melgarejo, resulted in February of 1865, in the final defeat of the troops of President Dr. Maria de Acha, near Potosi; Melgarejo became President, only to have two other revolutions to suppress in 1865 and 1866. This oval silver or gilt medal, 43 × 36 mm., has on the obverse a uniformed bust of General Melgarejo facing left, and the inscription EL JENERAL Melgarejo AL VALOR Y LEALTAD *DE LOS DEFENSORES DE* LA CAUSA DE DICIEMBRE 1865. On the reverse, within oak and laurel branches, is DIBRE 28, ENERO 31, MARZO 27, SETBRE 5, with a radiant all-seeing eye in upper field. Rosa in Monetario Americano, No. 747, shows this medal with a condor holding laurel branches in its talons as the suspension device.\n\nA smaller medal, 26 × 21 mm., of white metal, was issued with an abbreviated inscription (Fonrobert, 9674).\n\nFonrobert, No. 9673, 9674.\n\nMEDAL OF POTOSI, 1865.

For description and illustration see p. 112.\n\nMedina, Medallas chilenas, p. 146, No. 55.\n\nMEDAL FOR ABTAO, 1865. During this year Peru became involved in a war with Spain —Bolivia and Chile went to the assistance of Peru . Fonrobert (9976) describes this silver medal, which is 38 mm. in diameter. On the obverse is the bust of the President, Mariano Melgarejo, facing to the left, and the inscription, BOLIVIA A LOS VENCED8 DE ABTAO . On the reverse are the arms of the country with military trophies, encircled by EN LA JORNADA DE 7 DE FEBRERO 1866. A silver cross (pattern) has been seen with the above obverse and a plain reverse. It is a double-pointed, six-armed cross, superimposed on a laurel wreath.\n\nSculfort, No. 1333; Fonrobert, No. 9976; Padiglione, II, p. 16.\n\nCROSS FOR CALLAO, 1866.

This is a five-pointed, ball-tipped star, having in the center obverse medallion, the bust of the President, encircled by eleven stars, and in the reverse center is POTOSI DIEBRE 24 DE 1868, below which are laurel and palm branches.\n\nBOLIVIA PL. V\n\nCross of 1872\n\nOrder of Condor\n\nLEGION OF HONOUR. Founded by President Melgarejo in 1866. The decoration is an eight-pointed, faceted star with a white medallion bearing a gold bust of Bolivar facing right within a red-enamelled circle, and a blue band inscribed SIMON BOLIVAR LIBERATOR; outside of this band is another circle, faceted. The ribbon is composed of equal stripes of green, yellow and red.\n\nLawrence-Archer, p. 307.\n\nCROSS OF 1872. This is a nine-pointed star of white enamel, having an eagle with raised wings for the suspension device. Between each of the points of the star are gold rays bearing a small five-pointed, white-enamelled star. On the obverse medallion is a figure of Liberty holding in her right hand the Bolivian flag, while the left hand rests a book upon a pedestal. A dark blue-enamelled encircling band is inscribed, LA ASAMBLEA NACIONAL DE 1872. HILARION DAZA. On the reverse medallion of white are branches of laurel and coffee plant, enclosing an upright sword and an open book. This is encircled by a band inscribed, AFIANZO LAS INSTITUCIONES DE BOLIVIA * . The ribbon shows the national colours, equal stripes of green, yellow and red.\n\nNATIONAL ORDER OF THE CONDOR OF THE ANDES. This was authorized April 18, 1925, for civil and military merit, and is composed of five classes. The decoration is a blue-enamelled1 Maltese cross, with ball tips and with pink-enamelled kantuta2 (or trumpet) flowers between the cross arms. The cross has a flying condor for the suspension device. On the circular obverse medallion is the mountain of Potosi, with a gold sun in a blue field—encircled by a white band inscribed in gold, LA UNION ES LA FUERZA, MCMXXV. On the reverse medallion of red are letters of gold, R. B. (Republica Boliviano). The ribbon is light green.\n\nORDER OF MILITARY MERIT. This was authorized by a decree of January 19, 1927, and appears to have had seven grades:—star of iron; medal of bronze; cross of bronze; cross of silver, enamelled red, and a similar decoration enamelled blue; a placque of gold; and a collar of honour. No detailed description of the decoration has been obtainable, save that the inscription on the obverse is AL MERITO in the centre, encircled by RE- PUBLICA DE BOLIVIA EXERCITO NACIONAL. The reverse is not described in the decree nor is any account of the ribbon included. It is believed the order was never actually established.\n\nEnd Notes\n\n1\n\nThe decree prescribes a cross of white anamel, but the specimen in the collection of the American Numismatic Society is of blue.\n\n2\n\nKantuta is probably the Quechua Indian name for the Coantutai plant, known among botanists as \"Cantua buxifolia,\" a shrub with a trumpet-like red flower, common through the Andean region of Bolivia and Peru . Some authorities call it the \"Flora del Inca.\"\n\nEnd Notes\n\n1\n\nThe province of Charcas, the Indian name of which is Chuquisaca, was a bishopric founded in 1552, as part of the Spanish vice-royalty of Peru . The name was changed in 1840, to Sucre, in honour of the patriot who aided in gaining the independence of the country. The city of Charcas was the first Spanish South American city to revolt from the Spanish rule (May 25, 1809).\n\nBrazil\n\nBrazil was discovered January 26, 1500, by Vincent Yanez Pinzon (1460–1524) a Spanish navigator, who commanded the \"Niña\" in the first voyage of Columbus in 1492. The same year —April 22, 1500—the Portuguese navigator Pedro Alvarez Cabral, took possession of the land under a dictum of the Pope, who had assigned the territory to Portugal . It was a colony of Portugal until 1807, when Joan VI and Queen Maria I (having established a regency in Lisbon ) fled from Portugal with their governmental staff and here established their kingdom during the Napoleonic wars in the Peninsula.\n\nIndependence from Portugal was declared September 7, 1822, and an Empire formed by Dom Pedro I. (Antonio-Pedro de Alcantara of Bourbon, 1798–1834). He was compelled to resign in 1831 in favour of his son Pedro II. (1825–1891).1\n\nThe empire was overthrown by the revolution of November, 1889, and a provisional government formed by Manoel Deodora da Fonseca (1827–1892).\n\nIn 1891 the United States of Brazil was formed. Fonseca was elected the first President, but he resigned soon after in favour of Fiorina Peixoto (1842–1895).\n\nSeveral of the orders of chivalry which had been established in Portugal for several centuries, were transferred to Brazil , and established there by laws of October 20, 1823 and revised or reorganized by the decree of September 9th, 1843. All Portuguese orders of chivalry were discontinued at the time of the overthrowing of the empire and the establishing of the republic.\n\nD'Amade, pp. 427–429.\n\nTHE ORDER OF CHRIST consisted of three classes: Grand Cross, Commanders and Chevaliers. The decoration was a red-enamelled cross with expanded and flattened ends, on which is superimposed a cross of white enamel; the whole being suspended from a radiant star bearing a flaming heart. The ribbon is bright red, edged with light blue.\n\nTHE ORDER OF AVIS, consisted of a green-enamelled cross with elongated fleur-de-lys ends, suspended from a radiant star bearing a flaming heart, save the lowest grade which was a plain cross. The ribbon is dark watered-green edged with red.\n\nBrazil . Decretos do Governo Provisorio, p. 455–456, illus.; Burke, p. 73; Lawrence-Archer, p. 305–306.\n\nORDER OF SAINT JAMES OF THE SWORD. This decoration, of three classes, was a red-enamelled cross (similar to the Cross of Avis), save that the lower arm was shaped like a two-edged sword. The first class plaque bore a replica of the cross on a radiant star of silver. The second class decoration was surmounted by a star bearing the flaming heart and that for the third class was a plain cross as above described. The ribbon was dark purple edged with light blue.\n\nORDER OF THE TOWER AND SWORD. This fifteenth century Portuguese decoration was likewise taken to Brazil by the royal family when they fled to South America , and it was officially revived in that country on May 13th, 1808. It was discontinued on the establishment of the Republic in 1891. The decoration is a five-pointed white-enamelled star, ball-tipped, superimposed on a green-enamelled wreath, with a gilt tower above. On the white-enamelled centre medallion is a green wreath with a sword, encircled by a blue-enamelled band inscribed VALOR E LEALDADE. On the reverse is an open book inscribed CARTA CONSTITUCIONAL DA MONARQUIA *, encircled by a blue band inscribed PELO REI E PELA LEI (for the King and the law). The ribbon was dark blue.\n\nde Melo, p. 8.\n\nORDER OF THE SOUTHERN CROSS. This decoration was first instituted on December I, 1822, by Dom Pedro I. (1778–1834) and given the name of the Constellation of the South, or Southern Cross. Brazil was first called the Land of the Holy Cross because of this constellation. It was discontinued at the time of the revolution of 1889, when the empire was overthrown, but revived on May 22,1890, by the republican government as a reward of merit. There are four classes, Grand Cross, Commanders, Officers and Chevaliers. The first decoration was a ball-tipped, double-pointed, five-armed cross of white enamel surmounted by an imperial crown and superimposed upon a wreath of tobacco and coffee plant leaves. On the light blue centre medallion is a cross of stars encircled by a dark blue band inscribed BENE MERENTIUM PRAEMIUM. The reverse medallion of gilt bears the head of the emperor facing to the left encircled by a dark blue band inscribed PETRUS I BRASILIAE IMPERATOR.D . When the order was revised in 1890, the style of the cross in the centre was changed to five stars, arranged as they appear in the Southern Cross constellation, and the crown was replaced by a five-pointed star on a wreath. On the reverse the centre medallion bears a female head of Liberty encircled by the inscription ESTADOS UNIDOS DO Brazil * . The ribbon is light blue.\n\nRosa, Leyes, p. 255; Cappelletti, p. 317; Daguin, p. 80.\n\nBRAZI PL. I\n\nOrder of the Southern Cross\n\nORDER OF PEDRO I.

Their daughter, Isabella-Christina-Gonzaga, was married at Rio de Janeiro, October 15, 1864, to Louis-Gaston d'Orleans, Count d'Eu, son of the Ducde Nemours, a Marshal in the Brazilian army. Francois d'Orleans, Prince of Joinville, and uncle of the Count d'Eu, married at Rio Janeiro, May 1, 1843, Francoise-Caroline-Gonzaga, daughter of Pedro I, and sister of Pedro II.\n\nChile\n\nThis section of South America was invaded in 1535 by Diego de Almagro (1475–1538), one of the Spanish conquerors of Peru , and was first settled in 1541 by Pedro de Valdivia (1498–1554). The Spanish were in continuous control for almost three hundred years. Early in 1817, General José de San Martin 1 of La Plata, left Argentina to aid the Chileans in their war for independence. After the battle of Chacabuco, on February 12th of that year, San Martin was pressed into the service of Chile to take supreme command of their army. In 1820 he went to the assistance of Peru , and aided by Lord Cochrane, captured Lima and drove the Spanish from the coast. The independence of Chile was declared February 12,1818. Chile acquired Atacama from Peru , while Tacna and Arica are still the subject of negotiations with Peru as to ownership under the conditions of the treaty which closed the war of 1879–1883. The word Chile is probably derived from the Quichua Indian word tchili, meaning snow.\n\nSPANISH MEDAL FOR FIDELITY. This is classed under Chile by some writers, although it might apply to any of the Spanish-American colonies, as it appears to have been awarded to the troops who upheld the cause of Spain during the period in which several of the South American countries were struggling for their independence. It was issued in gold or silver, 39 mm. in diameter, bearing on the obverse the laureated bust of the king and his title FERNANDO VII REY DE ESPANA Y DE LAS YNDIAS, and on the reverse, within palm and laurel branches EN PREMIO DE LA FIDELIDAD. An oval bronze medal, 47 × 41 mm. was also issued, with a uniformed bust of the king facing to the right and with the same inscriptions. This was made in Mexico and designed by F.

The Spanish forces were led by Marco del Pont and Maroto. The battle was won by a bayonet charge led by O'Higgins himself. This engagement drove the Spanish out of Santiago and resulted in the independence of Chile . O'-Higgins became Director General, an office which he held until 1823.\n\nBy a decree of April 15, 1817, this medal was authorized for all the troops under San Martin and O'Higgins: hence it is also classed with those of Argentina. There were three varieties of the medal: two were pentagonal and made in London; an oval medal was made in Chile . One pentagonal medal of gold or silver, surmounted by a radiant sun with a wide ribbon bar-loop, has on the obverse center the arms of Argentina within laurel branches, below which is the date, 12 DE FEBo.

The whole is encircled by a band inscribed: HONOR Y PREMIO AL PATRIOTISMO. On the ribbon segment above is inscribed: O'HIG'S. INST. The ribbon is half white and half red.\n\nMedina states these were made in Santiago and that another medal of gold and silver was made in Paris and awarded to those not at Chacabuco. This was a red-enamelled five-pointed star, with white-enamelled ball tips and gilt rays in the angles; the whole superimposed on a green laurel wreath.\n\nChile PL.
