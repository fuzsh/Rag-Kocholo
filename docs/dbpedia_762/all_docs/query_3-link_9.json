        "text": "The Spanish Civil War of 1611-1613 (sometimes referred to as the War against Uceda or the War of the Grandees) was an internicine conflict between prominent spanish noblemen. The conflict rocked Spain to the core, and was\n\nindirectly caused by a convergence of factors, including the Conference of Pilsen and the Truce of Antwerp.\n\nThe Road to Civil War[]\n\nTurmoil at court[]\n\nDuring Lerma's tenure as valido, a party of \"progressives\" had been steadily forming itself amongst the Spanish hidalguia. Favouring centralization of the composite Spanish kingdom under the authority of the King, this group centered itself around Baltasar de Zúñiga y Velasco, previously advisor to Albert and Isabella, Lords of the Netherlands, now ambassador of the Spanish court to its counterpart in Vienna. In early 1609, Zúñiga's followers organized a plan for a coup-de-main: Cristóbal Gómez de Sandoval-Rojas y de la Cerda, the Duke of Lerma's son and Duke of Uceda, joined the conspirators the previous winter on pressure of Gaspar de Guzmán y Pimentel, his nephew. Other members of the conspiracy included the King's own confessor, Luis de Alaga, and Luis de Velasco y Velasco, 2nd Count of Salazar, 1st Marquess of Belvedere, employed in the Netherlands. It was rumored that even Ambriosio Spinola Doria, the victorious condottiero of Ostend, was in on the plot, eager to vindicate his grievances against the valido who had denied him the grandeeship in 1606. Zúñiga himself left Vienna in early Summer of 1609, intent on taking control over tercios de bisoño raised for the occasion by the Duke of Uceda and the Count of Salazar. Don Velasco would organize an expedition from the Netherlands with the Velasco, Villar and Queralt Leyva battle hardened tercios. That would, however, take longer than anticipated.\n\nThe Junta's Coup[]\n\nOn the 16th of July, 1609, the troops of the self-styled Junta de la Santa Hermandad surrounded the capital of Madrid. Notably, the Count of Salazar was absent, but the Duke of Uceda, the Valido's own son, soon left for Andalusia and Lower Castille to gather additional support. After a period of two weeks, six thousand more additional troops, formed by noble-backed regiments, were successful in removing the Duke of Lerma from power. The mostly bloodless coup relegated King Felipe to a mere puppet, and replaced the valido with two privados, De Zúñiga and the Duke of Uceda themselves. The Duke of Lerma was put under house arrest.\n\nThe Conference of Pilsen[]\n\nAt the same time, in Pilsen, a conference was indicted to address the simmering religious turmoil in the Empire. The Bohemian town hosted representatives of both the Catholic and Protestant states from all of Europe meet to discuss the situation, something unprecedented for the age. The Junta's representative was Diego Sarmiento de Acuña, a delegate of Zúñiga ad interim. On behalf of the Junta controlling the country, and after much deliberation and correspondence between De Zuñiga, the Austrian Habsburgs and the Conference, de Acuña signed the principles of the Conference[1]. This had immediate ripples throughout the Spanish Realms.\n\nThe Duke of Uceda was furious at the signatory, and blamed his colleague for the binding of Spain to its principles, menacing to have him tried for sedition and heresy. Zuñiga himself was unhappy with the Conference's results, but defended his choice[2]. For weeks, the Consejo de Estado' and the Consejo de Guerra's activity ground to a halt. This paralysis led directly to the confirmation of John Sigismund of Brandenburg's rights to the rich United Duchies of Jülich-Cleves-Berg. In the Spanish Netherlands, the notion of religious tolerance led to a fracture. Pragmatists within the Lordship believed that this would lead to an eventual reabsorption of the Union of Utrecht under the Spanish fold. However, not many were of this counsel (for example Íñigo de Borja, Governor of the City of Antwerp, sided with the Duke of Uceda on the issue).\n\nSplit of the Junta[]\n\nAs the Duke of Lerma languished in his own Palace in Madrid as prisoner, his son clashed with his fellow royal favourite on a variety of ways. Though both favouring a degree of interventionism in the Empire, they could not agree on what measure. The Duke of Uceda, contrary to his father's neutralist policies and the Conference of Pilsen, urged to subject the Austrian branch of the Habsburgs to Spanish primacy[3], while the \"Caballero del León\" favoured a continued cooperation with the Austrian Habsburgs on equal terms. Lastly, Uceda wanted a complete centralization of power in the hands of the Consejo de Estado and the court of Madrid, while the other wanted the Cortes empowered, though agreeing with his counterpart that much of the ancient rights of Spain's many reynos needed to be cut down.\n\nMuch of the Spanish nobility and grandeeship, especially within the former Aragonese and Navarrese crowns, were deeply unhappy with the privados' attempts to rescind their rights. Minor revolts in Catalonia, Aragon and Biscay during the summer of 1610 forced the previously ad hoc armies to stay in the field, and being used to quell the insurgency. As both of Felipe III's favourites vied for power against one another, each regiment chose their favourite candidate in the conflict ahead. The die was cast when the Duke of Uceda managed to gain King Felipe III's support against his rival, as many other major nobles from the Southern reynos followed in shifting their allegiance.\n\nConsequences in the Lordship of the Netherlands[]\n\nAlbert and Isabella were astonished by the events going on in Spain. With such a turmoil engulfing the Iberian mainland, it would surely be a matter of time before Maurice of Orange would appeal to the Estates General of the Union to nullify the terms of the Truce of Antwerp. However, as the Stadtholder was dealing with his own problems, this event never materialized. The Lordship itself was split on who to support and who was the legitimate party in the governing diarchy, threatening to break apart the Union of Arras. The Governor of Antwerp Citadel, Íñigo de Borja, vocally supported Uceda. Others like Don Luis de Velasco continued to support the \"Caballero\". In the end, Ambrosio Spinola-Doria would be swayed to support Zuñiga upon the promise of his ultimate aim: a noble title and a grandeeship rank.\n\nThe Army of Flanders was thrown into chaos, as officers unaligned with their regiment's allegiance found themselves deposed as maestros de campo or suffering mutinies. Don Velasco and his regiments quickly made for Dunkirk, intent on sailing for Spain in due notice. Even Spinola, now styled Marquess de Los Balbases, would return to Brussels in order to remain adjourned of developments.\n\nConsequences in the Americas[]\n\nAmongst the most malcontent were the Viceroys administering various virreynados within the Spanish Colonial Empire. As the mainland continued to request more and more currency to finance sweeping changes in administration, taxation and governance, many found it difficult to accomplish directives often contradictory, confusing and, at times, impossible. Some nobles such as the governor of New Granada, Juan Buenaventura de Borja y Armendia, distanced himself from de Zúñiga, citing as a major issue his complacence with the Conference. Much of the New World was built on catholic conversion policies, after all, and this wasn't going to change.\n\nConsequences in the Kingdom of Portugal[]\n\nPortugal's noble class watched with rising apprehension as Zuñiga and Uceda debated. Uceda's stance of full annexiation into direct control from Madrid made him an enemy of many within the country, as its élite became more and more aligned with the \"Caballero\".\n\nA figure much responsible for this is Teodósio II, Duke of Bragança. The Dukes of Bragança, much like the Dukes of Aveiro, were related to the extinguished House of Aviz, whose successors were the Habsburg Kings of Spain. Loyal to Felipe III's father before, he argued that in the face of Spanish instability, Portugal would be able to emerge more powerful and independent than before under Spanish aegis. In spite of his direct opponent Henrique de Meneses's attempts at undermining his position, many Portuguese nobles sided with Bragança, believing his position to be vindicated in the end[4].\n\nCivil War[]\n\n1611 - Opening moves, Siege of Madrid and Battle of Anchuelo[]\n\nIn Castile, the situation became much too heated to bear any longer. De Zuñiga continued to request money from the various Cortes in order to finance their own disempowerment, and seldom they agreed. This resulted in the nobleman trying to concoct other ways to reduce spending, so that he could have an allowance to spend elsewhere. Not all of them were successful, far from it, in fact. The Inquisition fell under his crosshairs as well, much to the chagrin of Felipe III[5]. A new civil servant class of corregidores were tasked to overtake much of inquisitorial tasks (glossing over religious affairs, quite clearly), but many attributed this move to a will of Zuñiga to create a parallel organization to spy and quell dissent against his rule. This would not work as intended. Many of the permanent tribunals of the Inquisition in the South refused disbandment, and declared allegiance to the legitimate valido: Uceda. As the Duke enjoyed royal vouching, the Caballero and his Baltasarista party prepared for his move.\n\nIt did not want for a long wait: on the 6th of December 1610, the Duke issued an ultimatum: the \"Caballero\" and his collaborators to step down from power and resign. De Zúñiga refused to step down from his office, leading to the Duke of Uceda to take harsh actions against him. Much of the local clergy would flock to Sandoval, who marched southwards, taking control of much of Andalusia and Murcia. His followers, being named the Ucedistas, went on a rampage in the South. The moriscos, accused of having supported Zuñiga and having converted him to the \"Mohammedan faith\", were harshly targeted by Uceda's forces. This triggered the third and final Rebellion of the Alpujarras. Zuñiga saw himself forced to rally support amongst the very people he intended to strip off their privileges. He summoned many notables of Aragon, promising them a rollback of his reforms if he were successful against Uceda. However, distrust ran deep within their ranks. While the lower nobles agreed, the Aragonese grandeza and the urban patriciate of Zaragoza refused, as did the Lordship of Biscay, which instead took Uceda's side.\n\nBy late Summer of 1611, Uceda would return to Madrid with a sizeable host, financed in huge part by major nobles and hidalguìa of the South. Lacking the means (or perhaps the will) to lay siege to Madrid immediately, he demanded once more the immediate surrender of all Baltasaristas, and the seizure of De Zuñiga himself. The latter had by then sent out several diplomats, rallying support for the king, whom he held as a puppet in Madrid[6]. Uceda finally ordered to encircle the city on the 18th of October. The siege itself was pretty ineffective, and so by design. Uceda thought he could scare Felipe III to change his mind again. Numerous secret correspondences were entertained by Sandoval and the Royal Family. Sadly for him, the King's indolence in the face of his own arrest made these attempts futile.\n\nIn a bold winter move, Fernando Girón de Salcedo, Marquess of Sofraga, attempted to relieve the siege. This resulted in the Battle of Anchuelo, in which Zuñigista forces were soundly defeated. The bland siege of Madrid would continue, and Uceda's victory would allow him to recover the entirety of Badajoz and most of the Asturias.\n\nVelasco's Arrival[]\n\nIn the Spanish Netherlands, many were the call to arms from either side to their preferred generals and maestros de campo. Spinola-Doria, in Brussels by winter 1611, would be notified of the departure of ships from the port of Dunkirk. Instead of landing in Baltasarista-controlled Cantabria as expected, the ships made a wide detour towards the South. The Count of Salazar had unexpectedly changed sides, and supported the Duke of Uceda. The Almirante de Aragón Francisco López de Mendoza y Mendoza, Marquess of Mondejar is often credited for this change of heart. De Mendoza, himself born in Granada, had been in Spain ever since 1603. Having served against the Dutch forces of the Union of Utrecht, he was keen for Spain not to indulge in the tenets of Pilsen. He also held against Zuñiga a personal grudge for aligning with Rodrigo Calderón, Conde de la Oliva de Plasencia and Marquess de Siete Iglesias, which was in Madrid at the time. The winter traverse of Velasco's three veteran tercios bode not well for Zuñiga's cause, and most importantly for Spinola, his noble title.\n\n1612 - The Civil War continues[]\n\nSpinola's Arrival[]\n\nBringing with him 4 coronelias of the Tercio Viejo de Napoles, as well as his own, independently raised Spinola tercio, the Genoan landed in Santander in early Spring 1612, taking control of Torrelavega, quickly solidifying their hold over Biscay and Eastern Asturias. De Salcedo's battered forces joined him on the 13th of March.\n\nAragon and Valencia's switch of allegiance[]\n\nWhile the Cortes of Aragon and the Fueros of Navarre refused to take any stance, independent noblemen did. Alonso Diego López de Zúñiga y Sotomayor, Duke of Béjar and Plasencia was Zuñiga's lieutenant in Zaragoza, nominally having control of the region for the Caballero. De facto, the region was under military rule, and only the reyno of Valencia openly vouched for Zúñiga the previous winter. Don Francisco de Mendoza and Don Velasco quickly moved northwards, capturing the city of Dénia in mid-April, and forcing Alonso de Zúñiga to abandon Zaragoza in order to defend Valencia. Having been trampled in their freedom by the Zuñigistas, the Cortes of Zaragoza and Pamplona openly supported Uceda's side once the \"Admiral of Aragon\" approached with his army. In one fell swoop, the Ucedistas secured control over most of Eastern Spain. Only Valencia itself and the Balearic Islands (held by majorcan noble Pablo de Blas) remained under control of their opponents. Velasco besieged it with due haste, beginning in early May. Lacking a substantial enough navy to face Federico Spinola's galleys, the Siege of Valencia would drag on until the next year.\n\n1613 - End of the Civil War[]\n\nThe Battle of Madrid[]\n\nThe one-and-a-half year long siege of Madrid had made no significant progression since its inception. For the Duke of Uceda, recovering Madrid as intact as possible was paramount. Queen Margaret's death during the siege and Rodrigo Calderón's blaming for the event signaled the first cracks in a legitimacy long moribound. Furthermore, within the city stood his personal residence, the royal family itself, and many of his own supporters. A proper assault with contravallations and circumvallations was, in the end, militarily unfeasible in the hilly terrain upon which the Capital was constructed. However, his long and ineffective encirclement of the city made him run out of time. Reinforcements from De Salcedo and Spinola arrived in the outskirts of the city.\n\nThey found to wait for them only a fortified encampment at the foot of Monte de el Pardo, whose forests were dented by the felling of thousands of trees. The Marquess of Los Balbases, used to better fortifications and having proven his mettle in the Siege of Ostend, quickly set up a battleplan. The inexperienced Duke of Uceda's forces were quickly made short work of by Spinola's experienced men, and as the Ucedistas were about to organize a retreat, Salcedo's forces cut their rear. The Battle of Madrid resulted in the annihilation of Uceda's army, as the Duke was taken prisoner. However, Spinola's soldiers suffered from extensive war-weariness, and the war was to enter its third year. Many of the soldiers were left unpaid for months on end, forcing the newly freed Baltasar de Zúñiga to incur in debt with some of his major supporters, Genoese and Florentine bankers, and even moneylenders by profession. Even so, Spinola's troops would not move onwards for months. The Marquess of Los Balbases entered his own personal diplomacy with the King, which confirmed the bestowal of the grandeeship upon him (he was additionally granted the title of Duke of Sesto), and promised aid in resanation of his troubled finances[7]. Spinola moved his forces to Burgos in order to rest.\n\nThe Count of Oliva's demise[]\n\nRodrigo Calderón was a character of dubious loyalty and a carreerist under the Duke of Lerma. At the notice of Zúñiga moving towards Cordoba at the head of his army and the Count of Olivares, he hatched a conspiracy. Shortly after Zúñiga and Olivares' departure from the capital, he declared his support for the captured Duke of Uceda, trying to free him from his house arrest with members of the Madrid garrison turned over to his side. But the Caballero was one step before him. As soon as his troops reached Sandoval's residence, they turned against him, apprehending the Count. After having been promised a fair trial, he was instead executed by the so-called cadenados, the corregidores closest to the Knight of León, by being thrown in a lit pyre[8]. The Duke of Uceda would be instead moved to Alcalá de Henares, being granted his desire to be imprisoned far from his father, languishing instead in Torrejón de Velasco.\n\nFall of Valencia[]\n\nWhile Madrid was relieved and the forces of Salcedo took control of Extremadura, León and the Northern Andalusian lands, the Count of Salazar's forces were aided by the Viceroy of Naples, Juan Alonso Pimentel de Herrera. His flotilla, originally built to contrast barbary corsairs, defeated Federico Spinola in the Battle of the Costa Blanca. With their link to the Balearic Islands severed, the Duke of Béjar surrendered. The Count of Salazar had him released with a small escort to his estates in Valladolid, while he took most of his force prisoner. Only a few regiments were able to be smuggled out of Valencia and ferried to Palma de Majorca by Federico Spinola's flotilla.\n\nEnd of Hostilities[]\n\nSpain was tired and battered. Both sides had incurred into huge debt, both in their own account and on account of the Spanish state. Furthermore, with tensions rising in the Empire, fear arose of Protestant plots afoot to seize Spanish holdings in the Empire, or worse, the Austrian Archdukes moving to assume control of the Netherlands and the Milanesado. Hostilities died down soon after Uceda's capture and imprisonment, and would end right after his execution by beheading. In an uncarachteristic flare of initiative from his usual indolence, King Felipe urged the parts to \"come together in peace\", for the good of the realm. However, the civil war had fractured Spanish society in ways that would take years to mend. With the signing of the Peace of San Lorenzo de El Escorial, the King granted peace to all who would denounce their allegiance to the Duke of Uceda, which meant the majority of them.\n\nMany of the titles and estates of House de Sandoval y Rojas were redistributed amongst the victors.\n\nHistorical Assessment[]\n\nThe War of the Grandees as a \"religious war\"[]\n\nThe Civil War was the culmination of a long-lasting feud between two rival families, vying for the position of royal favourite. Notwithstanding actions of public slander and besmirchment coming from either side, it would be quite the miscarachterization to define the rivalry between De Zúñiga and Sandoval-Rojas as a disagreement borne out of different views on religious freedom. The Treaty or Conference of Pilsen was merely a catalyst that channeled long-running conflicts between great magnates within the Spanish kingdoms, and it can be argued that the short-sightedness of the Austrian branch of the Habsburgs (in particular Emperor Rudolf II) was a direct cause of the conflict. The Spanish branch would from then on have not the means, nor the will to aid their cousin in the wars to come.\n\nThe War of the Grandees as a \"progressive war\"[]\n\nIt is doubtful whether the outcome of this civil conflict can be regarded as a positive one. Mainly centered around personal prestige, the rights of the nobility and centralization, having religion as a liminal factor, it has taken its toll on the economy as well as the population. It has divided the people amongst Zuñigistas and Ucedistas, in the tolerant nobility and clergy and the more Counter-Reformation-oriented ones, in those who supported centralization and those who did not. In the end, the Empire which was already embroiled with corruption and political factions, would now be divided even more, even though the Ucedistas were formally defeated.\n\nThe first policy to be enacted by the new government of Zúñiga was to raise the taxes of the locals which would be used to help redevelop Spain, as well as fund the further policies that Balthasar de Zúñiga wants to make. Not every noble liked this decision, especially those not in favour of him, mainly in the north, where much of the taxes were relatively low. With little effort to enforce these higher taxes, the means remained low for the crown. The fact that internal trade barriers and toll gates within Spain were disbanded, didn’t help the treasury of the state grow at all. The valido's claims for this to be a temporary problem which would keep itself upright in the long-term, as the economy is to grow eventually, fell on deaf ears. The King had returned to his usual indolence for state affairs, but the Caballero's detractors did not.\n\nPerhaps a massive error in political, or rather, economic decision-making, was putting quota on minimal and maximum import of gold and silver from the America’s. While it was meant to keep the inflation at a steady rate, it would lead to the coffers of the crown only dwindling down even more and more. Several new institutions were found, including the Spanish Trade Company, which needed a starting fund, one which the Crown would not allocate for years to come. Perhaps the most supply-demanding institution was the Real Banco de Espanya, which was modelled after the Dutch banking system. More and more money was needed, but the crown had very little capability of actually giving this money.\n\nPortugal's empowerment[]\n\nThere was but one supplier of money, and that was the Portuguese Cortes. The Spanish crown became nearly completely dependable on the Portuguese financers, who would entrust the Spaniards and especially Zúñiga, in his endeavours. However, trust was hard to find among the Portuguese nobles who saw little benefits in this. This eventually led to only a fraction of the needed gold to be send to Spanish directions at a steady interest rate. This issue enveloped the Portuguese Cortes for several months, leading to two different sides, one being a pro-Iberian and the other being anti-Spanish. The Duke of Braganza would be a mediator of the two, being appointed as head of the Cortes and therefore Regent of Portugal on account of King Felipe in absence of a viceroy.\n\nDevelopments in the Colonial Empire[]\n\nWhile the war had not spread to America, it had forced the majority of the fleet to be deployed in different ports in Spain, most notably near Sardinia and Sicily, as well a large part in Dunkirk. To face the sore lack of naval equipment, many commanders in the civil war had opted to commandeer or rent galleys, or seize merchant vessels. Likewise, the war against the Dutch has required a lot of naval equipment and manpower just a few years prior. This included a fraction of the Spanish navy, which would set sail to the Philippines to secure its outposts there. The Americas were nearly deprived of armadas and escorts from the mainland, as it was forced to anchor elsewhere, leading to a lot of independent captains to use the situation to capture smaller ships under Spanish or Portuguese flag, mainly merchant ships. This quickly spiralled down into piracy acts and anarchy on the sea. While some ships remained stationed in ports like Veracruz, Cartagena of the Indies or Havana, it was far from easy to keep the situation under control.\n\nAlong the Swahili coast, foreign pirates, presumably from the Horn of Africa, attempted to find their fortune raiding the Portuguese holdings along the Indian Ocean. Although it would have little success, it would still remain an issue for the Portuguese navy which at the same time was dealing with a war with the Dutch. In India, the piracy issue remained under control, as local navies could easily depose of the pirate ships, supporting Portugal in the endeavour. More than often, the Portuguese authorities were forced to pay captains a sum of money for their support, leading to an intricate web of alliances inside of the subcontinent.\n\nThe Knight's demise[]\n\nAll of these problems combined led to the popularity and the political power of the government under commander De Zúñiga to not be high. His fall from grace was not due to the King’s disfavour (whose political bearing was debatable at best), but that of public opinion. As he was holding a banquet alongside his most trusted advisors, generals and courtiers, he would find his inevitable death, a few years earlier than was expected, by the means of poison. Although some would argue he had saved both Spain and Portugal from corrupt regents, many others blamed him for the state of financial ruin and social upheaval of the Monarquía Católica. He had made a lot of enemies. While they could not raise their bannermen again, they could use other methods, methods that had led to his death.\n\nDe Zúñiga, who was created Duke of Valencia seven months before his death, did not leave any children. During his tenure, he had introduced the still young nephew, the Count of Olivares, to the political scene. He gathered fame during the civil war, earning the title of Duke of Sanlúcar. He was shoved forward as the Duke of Valencia’s likely successor, having been under his tutelage and having served in the government alongside him. Within the army, people were more in favour of Ambrosio Espinola to take over the regency, but in the end, the king appointed Olivares. Spinola himself added that he was not interested in a political career, preferring to stay in the Spanish Netherlands to support Albert and Isabella. Despite all of it, Duke Baltasar De Zúñiga was given a state’s funeral, where his name and his achievements would be honoured."
