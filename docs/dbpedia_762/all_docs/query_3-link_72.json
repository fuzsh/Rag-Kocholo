The viceregal court was a sui generis manifestation of the courtly society that flourished in Spain during the Golden Age and made an important contribution to the fostering of cultural exchange between the Old World and the New World, while also leaving a lasting imprint on the Mexican colonial elites. With the 18th-century Bourbon reforms, the viceregal court underwent changes that resulted in its decline and demise; however, the viceroy remained a prominent figure of the capital, which continued to be the hub of Mexico’s social and political life until the eve of the country’s independence from Spain.",
