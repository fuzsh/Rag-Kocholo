Most of those loans havebeen for less than $200, helping small-scale entrepreneurs — 97 percentof them female — build better lives for themselves and their families.\n\nYunus, who shared the 2006 Nobel Peace Prize with the Grameen Bank,spoke about his model of economic development on Saturday, October 13."
