        "text": "Some years back I made a series of trips to Bangladesh to spend time with the women of Grameen Bank and the entrepreneurial businesses they run in tough circumstances.\n\nMuhammad Yunus and the women of Grameen shared the Nobel Peace Prize for the creation of the pioneering micro credit organisation. I was intrigued by the communication challenges involved in building a storytelling network to scale-up a lending concept in a culture where women were not traditionally allowed to be involved in such activity and the budget to communicate the story was almost zero. Borrowers take small loans from Grameen and use the money to invest in a business. I met entrepreneurs in rural Bangladesh who produced income for their families through activities such as fattening cows, raising chickens for eggs and meat or opening a village store. I met one borrower who built a brick-kiln that she built from scratch, and operated, which employed hundreds of men. One borrower purchased the rickshaw that her husband had previously rented by the day building up an asset base for the family. Six women form a group and take out individual loans for a business purpose and then the group of six travel to a Grameen building each Friday and make a small repayment. The group looks out for each other and the social dynamics lead to above 98% repayment rates without the need for collateral.\n\nThe brickworks built and owned by a Grameen borrower\n\nI sat with Nurjahan Begum in Dhaka who was Deputy Managing Director of the bank and we talked about the work she did in the first days of Grameen in the village of Jobra just outside Chittagong. She arranged for Muhammad Yunus to talk to potential borrowers about building businesses by conversing through their hut walls as it was prohibited for women to talk to men face to face at the time. Before Grameen, women were borrowing just enough cash from predatory money lenders to buy cane each morning that would be woven into baskets over the course of a single day. The finished goods were required to be sold back to the lender and the loan repaid at almost 100% interest for the day. Yunus walked into the village outside his office in Chittagong University and made the first loans to 27 women who collectively borrowed $US42. The borrowers of Grameen own the bank.\n\nWith Deputy Managing Director of Grameen Nurjahan Begum in Mirpur-2, Dhaka\n\nI met Yunus and he pointed out that in 1970’s Bangladesh, men were pretty poor money managers. He chose women to take the loans as they used them in the best interests of their families. He suggests that the problem he faced was just as much a communication problem as it was a poverty issue. The lending model he created was simple, compelling and as a story it was easy to retell. I also sat with Grameen borrowers in Queens just outside New York City – where Bangladeshis were making loans to poor Americans after the GFC . Yunus built a highly repeatable story, unsupported by a communications budget that allowed Grameen to scale up to serve communities around the world. The Grameen story carries many of the elements of great storytelling as it focuses on overcoming obstacles, the players are compelling and there are pretty tangible results that feed back into the storytelling.\n\nWe use exactly the same story constructs in business even though we often have greater financial resources. If we get the story right, make it resonant with the audiences we engage, it can trigger a retelling that spreads the word and shapes opinion.\n\n#grameen #internationalwomensday #story #executiveinfluence #storyphy"
