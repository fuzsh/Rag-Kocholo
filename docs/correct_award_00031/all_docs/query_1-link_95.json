This summit will offer the opportunity for microfinance\n\npractitioners, advocates, donors, and others committed to the Summit’s goals to assess\n\nprogress, discuss challenges to achieving the new goals for 2015, and identify\n\nstrategies for overcoming those challenges.\n\n- 30 -\n\nFor further information, media representatives may contact:\n\nForeign Affairs Media Relations Office\n\nForeign Affairs and International Trade Canada\n\n613-995-1874\n\nhttp://www.international.gc.ca\n\nPascale St-Pierre\n\nPress Secretary\n\nOffice of the Minister of International Cooperation\n\n819-953-6238\n\nMedia Relations Office\n\nCanadian International Development Agency (CIDA)\n\n819-953-6534\n\ninfo@acdi-cida.gc.ca"
