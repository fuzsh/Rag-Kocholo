        "text": "Geoff Bennett:\n\nNearly half-a-century after its birth from a bloody Civil War, Bangladesh has made significant strides in reducing poverty.\n\nOne of the best known architects of this progress is Muhammad Yunus, who popularized the concept of microfinance. But Yunus has run afoul of his country's prime minister and has faced a series of legal challenges and now criminal charges.\n\nFred De Sam Lazaro has our report, part of his series Agents for Change.\n\nFred De Sam Lazaro:\n\nThe Grameen Bank grew quickly, 97 percent owned by millions of its female borrowers, success that earned him the Nobel Peace Prize in 2006.\n\nToday, Grameen has a large footprint in Bangladeshi society, far beyond microlending with affiliated companies that sell cell phone service and food products. There's even a nursing school. Its global reach includes Grameen America, which last year loaned $1 billion to low-income Americans.\n\nAll profits are plowed back into expanding the mission. Yunus has won friends in the highest places across the globe, except at home. In January, Yunus, who is 83, and three senior Grameen colleagues were sentenced to six months in prison for violating labor laws, charges he calls politically motivated.\n\nHe was released on bail, but this case is only the beginning of his legal troubles. He faces more than 100 other charges of labor law violations and graft.\n\nWhat's life like as you go into work these days?\n\nFred De Sam Lazaro:\n\nSheikh Hasina recently won a fourth term in elections, widely discredited and boycotted by opposition parties. Most of their leaders are in prison.\n\nShe's publicly denounced Yunus as a corrupt opportunist in a spat that experts trace back to 2007 and a time of political upheaval, when Yunus toyed with forming his own party. It was at the urging of the country's military leaders, he says, and short-lived.\n\nAli Riaz:\n\nThe prime minister has received unqualified support from two powers, that is Russia and China, not to mention India. India has been the principal backer of this government since 2009.\n\nAnd this is the message to the Bangladeshis that if Professor Yunus can be persecuted and punitive measures can be taken, you are nobody. We can take — do anything.\n\nFred De Sam Lazaro:\n\nHe has a bail hearing on March 3, also the date when an anti-corruption commission is scheduled to release what many colleagues fear will be incriminating results from a yearslong investigation of Yunus' activities.\n\nFor the \"PBS NewsHour,\" I'm Fred De Sam Lazaro.\n\nAnd Fred's reporting is a partnership with the Under-Told Stories Project at the University of St. Thomas in Minnesota."
