        "text": "FRED DE SAM LAZARO, Correspondent, Twin Cities Public Television:\n\nNurul Islam has an unusual routine for a bank loan officer. Once a week, he comes to this shack to meet with his small business clients and to collect their loan installments.\n\nUnusual doesn't start to describe the borrowers: Most are female, illiterate, and, before they joined this group, very poor, not exactly a lucrative group to most bankers, especially since their typical loan is about $100. But these are preferred customers of the Grameen Bank; 2.4 million of them have made Grameen one of the most prosperous financial institutions in the developing world.\n\nMUHAMMAD YUNUS:\n\nWe had a famine in 1974, people were dying of hunger. And I found myself in a very strange situation: teaching elegant theories of economics, telling all my students that every economic problem has beautiful solutions. And I walk out of the classroom. Those elegant theories have no use for people who were dying.\n\nFRED DE SAM LAZARO:\n\nYunus wanted to apply some of his economic theories to the real world he saw. So he surveyed 42 small business owners — fruit vendors, artisans, rickshaw pullers — and found that just $27 would free the whole group from debts to local money lenders, debt that kept them in almost lifelong bonded labor. Yunus decided to bankroll the group himself, after failing to sell local bankers on the idea.\n\nMUHAMMAD YUNUS:\n\nI soon found out that people are paying back, and they paid back every penny without any hitch. So I got very excited. So I thought I should have my own bank. So I went to the government with a proposal that I should be allowed to set up a bank."
