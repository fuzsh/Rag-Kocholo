        "text": "Bangladesh's central bank has removed the Nobel peace prize winner Muhammad Yunus from the post of managing director of the microfinance pioneer Grameen Bank, after allegations of \"irregularities\" in its operations.\n\nYunus, 70, founded the Grameen Bank almost 30 years ago and has been lauded in his homeland and elsewhere as one of the most innovative and effective campaigners against poverty.\n\nHis departure, supporters say, would have \"terrible consequences\" for the poor in his country. Over recent months, the government of Sheikh Hasina has mounted an increasingly aggressive campaign against Yunus.\n\nOn Monday an attempt to oust him was defeated at an acrimonious board meeting of the Grameen Bank in Dhaka, the capital. The Grameen – the name means \"grassroots\" – is expected to reject the bid to sack Yunus and to take their fight to the courts.\n\nThe cited ground for the attempted dismissal appeared to be the age of Yunus, whom Bangladesh's finance minister recently accused of being \"too old\".\n\nThe failed bid to dismiss Yunus earlier this week was based on the claim that the globally famous development economist had broken local laws demanding mandatory retirement at the age of 60. Supporters say the issue is a technicality as the founder has always had the full support of the bank's board of directors. The central bank is the regulatory authority responsible for the Grameen.\n\nThe campaign to get rid of Yunus gathered pace after claims were made in a Norwegian documentary about the bank's transfer of aid money from the Norwegian government between legal entities several years ago. A subsequent investigation launched by Norwegian authorities found that the money had been wrongly moved but found no evidence of any misuse of funds. Yunus had denied any financial irregularities.\n\nThe Bangladeshi government has a 25% stake in the Grameen, which lends to more than 8 million families in Bangladesh and is hugely popular.\n\nSupporters of the pioneering development economist, who conceived the idea for a bank lending very small sums to the very deprived, to enable them to take a first step out of poverty, during a famine in Bangladesh in the late 1970s, say that the government now wants to take total control of what would be a major political asset.\n\nYunus, an outspoken critic of the corruption that is endemic in his homeland, angered senior politicians in 2007 by briefly floating a political party. In recent weeks, a powerful group of international figures led by Mary Robinson, the former president of Ireland, have led vocal backing for Yunus's continued leadership of the Grameen. Governments, too, have lobbied Bangladeshi diplomats."
