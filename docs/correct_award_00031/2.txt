UNESCO Director-General welcomes the award of the Nobel Peace Prize to Muhammad Yunus and Grameen Bank

On 13 October, Koïchiro Matsuura, Director-General of UNESCO, publicly welcomed the awarding of the 2006 Nobel Peace Prize to Muhammad Yunus and Grameen Bank during his closing remarks to the 175th session of UNESCO’s Executive Board.

The Nobel Committee awarded to Mr Yunus and Grameen Bank the 2006 Nobel Peace Prize “for their efforts to create economic and social development from below. Lasting peace can not be achieved unless large population groups find ways in which to break out of poverty. Micro-credit is one such means. Development from below also serves to advance democracy and human rights.”

Mr Matsuura expressed his “highest” satisfaction for this choice that “recognizes a man who tried to find easy solutions to complex problems”. He also recalled that UNESCO had long recognized the important work of Mr Yunus and Grameen Bank by awarding the 1996 International Simon Bolivar Prize to Mr Yunus and Grameen Bank “for their commitment to poverty eradication and their contribution to improving the status of women in rural areas of Bangladesh.”

The Director-General also noted that this award comes on the eve of the commemoration of the International Day for the Eradication of Poverty, held every year on 17 October. “UNESCO is working in all its fields of competence to reach the UN Millennium development goal to eradicate extreme poverty and reduce poverty by half by 2015. The activities of Mr Yunus and Grameen Bank are exemplary and provide hope for the poorest communities. UNESCO will continue to support every effort that promotes innovative solutions to the problem poverty” added the Director-General requesting the Permanent Delegate of the Bangladesh to convey the Organization’s congratulations to Bangladesh.
