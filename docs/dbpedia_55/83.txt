Fine Art Reproductions

We produce Prévost art prints, often referred to as posters, as art reproductions on high quality papers using digital printing technology. We print them on Canon iPF 9400 large format printers. These systems are characterized by an extremely high resolution and thanks to the 12-color ink system also by an enormously large color space and finest color gradations. The quality is significantly better than e.g. on color laser printers or in offset or screen printing. And best of all: You can choose between different papers, such as art paper, canvas, photo paper and watercolor paper. In addition, you determine the size and section of the picture »Visit of the Queen of Sheba to Solomon« itself.
