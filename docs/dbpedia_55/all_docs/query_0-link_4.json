Jeffries himself is known to have murdered the Tibbs infant before likely assaulting Mrs. Tibbs and letting her go. Following this, the escapees retreated to deeper bushland. Jeffries then killed one of the men searching for him, Magnus Bakie. Facing starvation, they killed one of the party members for food before joining up with bushranger gangs. Hanged.[65][66] Alexander Pearce Australia 1822–1823 2–5 Irishman deported in 1819 to Tasmania. He escaped the convict settlement with seven other convicts in 1824 into the Bush. The group was led by Robert Greenhill because he was the only one with a weapon, the axe used to kill members of the party for food when starvation ensued (ironically, in a region abundant with edible plants and other bush tuckers). After the first such murder for survival (unlikely to have been committed by the undersized, weaponless Pearce), 3 of the seven decamped. Pearce escaped being the second of the party murdered for food before one of the remaining three was fatally bitten by a snake. Only Pearce and Greenhill remained. Pearce was the only one left alive to reach the eastern settlements. Pearce was recaptured and sent back to the Macquaire Harbor convict settlement as his claims of murder and cannibalism weren't believed, and escaped soon after with another convict, Thomas Cox. This time Pearce killed and ate his companion in less than ten days, when he surrendered voluntarily to the authorities. It is difficult to justify calling Pearce a serial killer, as he only killed two people on his own and was at most one of Greenhill's accomplices in two earlier survival murders. However, if more than fictional sensationalism to sell newspapers, his reported last words, \"Man's flesh is delicious. It tastes far better than fish or pork\" suggest he may have become one had he lived.\n\nHanged in 1824.[55][67]\n\nCharles Routley Van Diemen's Land 1824–1828 6 Armed robber and duffer who murdered a shopkeeper, a shepherd and four of his own accomplices.

Helped by two accomplices, Lacenaire stabbed a former prison cellmate and his mother in Paris and later attacked a bank employee who survived. They intended to rob the victims, but none of the hits produced any money. While in prison for an unrelated offense, one of the accomplices, Victor Avril, blamed Lacenaire for the murders, and Lacenaire reacted by making a detailed confession that ensured both Lacenaire and Avril would be found guilty and executed. Lacenaire's response and his willingness to answer letters and receive visitors in prison, along with the publication of his memoirs, made him a celebrity. The two men were guillotined in 1836.[78] Burnham Poisoners United Kingdom 1835 3 A group of three, consisting of two women (Catherine Frary and Frances Billing) and one man (Peter Taylor), plotted to poison their respective spouses.

In 1847, his pregnant wife, a member of the Flathead Nation, was killed and scalped by Crow warriors. Johnson is said to have embarked then on a vendetta against the Crow Nation that lasted for years and during which he murdered, scalped and ate the livers of 300 Crow warriors, although Thrapp (1991) considers this number inflated and incompatible with the Crow population at the time.[84] Died of natural causes in 1900.[85] Jonathan Balls United Kingdom 1843–1846 2–5+ Believed to have poisoned his invalid wife, four grandchildren and possibly others. No crime investigation took place before Balls' own suicide by arsenic in 1846.[86] Manuel Blanco Romasanta Spain 1844–1852 9–14 \"The Werewolf of Allariz.\" While on the run from his first murder (a constable killed over a debt), Romasanta assumed a new identity and offered his services as a mountain guide to women and children, whom he murdered, later selling their clothing (and according to rumor, also making soap made from their body fat).
