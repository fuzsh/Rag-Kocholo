The dynasty established itself more permanently in 987, when Hugues \"Capet\" was elected king in succession to Louis V, the last king of the Carolingian dynasty. According to Pinoteau, the name \"Capet\" was first attributed to the dynasty by Ralph de Diceto writing in London in [1200], maybe because of the position of the early kings as lay abbots of St Martin of Tours where part of the \"cappa\" of the saint was allegedly conserved . The name appears never to have been applied officially to the family of the French kings, which from the end of the 13th century was called \"la maison de France\" in primary soruces, presumably to emphasise chronological continuity from the earlier Merovingian and Carolingian dynasties . Nevertheless, the name \"Capet\" provides a convenient epithet for modern historians to describe the dynasty.\n\nThe Capetian dynasty has been studied widely and needs little introduction. However, one of the intriguing puzzles remains its origin, discussed below under Robert \"le Fort\". Doubt also remains about the origin of the wives of four heads of the family in the 9th and 10th centuries, including three Capetian kings: the wives of Robert \"le Fort\" (died 866), King Eudes (died 898), King Robert I (died 923), and King Hugues \"Capet\" (died 996). All these questions are discussed below.\n\nThe expansion of the familys political influence across Europe, through younger branches of the dynasty, was unparalleled compared with other contemporary European ruling families. The brothers of Hugues \"Capet\" King of France were installed as dukes of Burgundy from 956 to 1002, and Robert younger son of Robert II King of France established the main line of dukes which ruled Burgundy from 1032 until 1361 (see the document BURGUNDY DUCHY, DUKES), as well as the kings of Portugal from [1095] until the 1910 revolution (see PORTUGAL KINGS). Hugues, younger son of Henri I King of France, married the heiress of the counties of Vermandois, Valois and Crépy, which his descendants continued to rule until 1213 when they reverted to the French crown (see NORTHERN FRANCE - VALOIS, VEXIN, VERMANDOIS). Robert, son of Louis VI King of France, was installed as Seigneur de Dreux in 1152 and his descendants in the male line ruled as Comtes de Dreux et de Braine from 1184 until [1355], the two counties being sold to the French crown in 1377 (see PARIS REGION - DREUX & MANTES). The Dreux line also provided dukes of Brittany from 1213 until 1514, when the duchy fell to the French crown (see BRITTANY DUKES). Robert's brother Pierre married the heiress of the seigneurie de Courtenay (see CHAMPAGNE - SENS & JOIGNY), although his most prominent descendants were Latin emperors of Constantinople from 1216 until 1261 (see CONSTANTINOPLE LATIN EMPIRE). Robert, younger son of Louis VIII King of France, was installed as comte d'Artois in 1237, his descendants ruling the county until 1329 (see NORTHERN FRANCE - ARTOIS, BOULOGNE etc.), as well as the county of Eu from 1351 to 1472 (see NORMANDY - ARQUES, AUMÂLE, CAUX, EU, ROUEN). Robert's younger brother Charles was invested as king of Sicily by Pope Clement IV in 1265, his descendants continuing to rule in southern Italy until 1435 (see SICILY KINGS) and in Hungary from 1301 to 1387 (see HUNGARY KINGS). Robert, son of Louis IX King of France, was created Comte de Clermont in 1269 and inherited the seigneurie de Bourbon from his wifes family in 1287 (see PARIS REGION - CLERMONT & DAMMARTIN). His descendants were created dukes of Bourbon in 1327 (see BOURBON) and inherited the French crown in 1589 when they were the senior surviving male representatives of the Capetian dynasty. The line of Evreux, descended from Louis Comte dEvreux youngest son of King Philippe III, provided later kings of Navarre (see NAVARRE KINGS). The Valois dynasty of French kings, sub-dynasty of the Capet family, descended from Charles Comte de Valois, younger son of Philippe III King of France (see Chapter 2), younger branches of which provided later dukes of Burgundy (see BURGUNDY DUCHY, DUKES), Dukes of Anjou (and titular kings of Sicily) (see ANJOU - COMTES, DUCS dANJOU), and Comtes and Dukes of Alençon (see Chapter 2.C).\n\nChapter 1. KINGS OF FRANCE (CAPET)\n\nA. KINGS OF FRANCE 888-898 and 922-936\n\nROBERT \"le Fort\", son of --- ([815/30]-killed in battle Brissarthe 2 Jul 866) . Robert´s birth date range is estimated assuming that his known sons were born in [850/60] as suggested below. The parentage of Robert \"le Fort\" is obscure. Some general indications, which are contradictory, are found in near contemporary sources:\n\n· An unspecified Franconian origin is favoured by the Annales Xantenses which name him Ruodbertus ortus de Francia, dux Karoli when recording his death , and by Widukind who refers to his son King Eudes as ex orientalibus Francia .\n\n· A Saxon origin is suggested by two sources: firstly, Richer names ex equestre ordine Rotbertum as father of King Eudes and his avum paternum Witichinum advenam Germanum ; secondly, the Miracula Sancti Benedicti names Robertus, Andagavensis comes, Saxonici generis vir .\n\n· Abbon refers to Roberts son Eudes King of France as \"Neustrien fils de la Neustrie\" .\n\n· Some early sources specifically state that nothing is known of Roberts origins, for example Rodulphus Glaber (\"cuius genus oscurum\") .\n\n· The possible identity of Robert´s mother is suggested by the charter dated 20 Feb \"anno XXVII regnante domino Carolo rege\" under which \"Robertus beati Martini abbas et comes\" confirmed donations to Tour Saint-Martin made \"olim ab Odone quondam comite Aurelianensi avunculo nostro et Willelmo eius filio\" . However, there are two possible interpretations of the dating clause of this document. If it refers to Charles II \"le Chauve\" King of the West Franks, whose reign is normally dated from the death of his father in Jun 840, the year would be [867] the year after Robert \"le Fort\" died. Another possibility is that the clause refers to Charles III \"le Simple\" King of the West Franks, in which case the year would be 920, indicating that the donor was the future Robert I King of France, rather than Robert \"le Fort\", although this would not change the significance of the relationship described (\"avunculus\" could also have been used in the document in the sense of \"great-uncle\"). As discussed further below, Anatole de Barthélemy uses this document as part of his argument for identifying Guillaume Comte de Blois as the father of Robert \"le Fort\". However, \"avunculus\" in its strict sense indicates \"maternal uncle\" and, while the terms \"patruus\" (paternal uncle) and \"avunculus\" (maternal uncle) are frequently used interchangeably in contemporary primary source documentation, it is possible that the relationship was through a sister of the two brothers Eudes Comte d´Orléans and Guillaume Comte de Blois, who could have been the mother of Robert \"le Fort\". If this is correct, he would have been Robert \"le Fort\", son of --- & his wife ---. It should be emphasised that this hypothesis is speculative.\n\n· Another possibility is that, assuming that the donor in the 20 Feb charter was the future Robert I King of France, the relationship could have been through his mother, the wife of Robert \"le Fort\", who as indicated below could have been the niece of the brothers Eudes Comte d´Orléans and Guillaume Comte de Blois.\n\nFour more specific suggestions about Robert´s paternal ancestry have been made:\n\n· Firstly, many modern secondary sources identify him as Robert [Rodbert], son of Rodbert Graf im Wormsgau & his wife Wiltrud ---, who was first named in Germany in 836 as \"son of the late Rodbert Graf von Wormsgau\", in a donation to Mettenheim . No primary source has yet been found which points specifically towards this suggested co-identity, although it is consistent with the Franconian origin referred to by the Annales Xantenses and by Widukind, as noted above. The suggestion is presumably based mainly on onomastics, although the first secondary source which proposed the connection has not yet been identified meaning that this point has not been checked. The author in question may have assumed that Robert was a unique name among noblemen in France in the first half of the 9th century, although this ignores Robert Seigneur [comte] à Sesseau en Berry, who was the possible brother of the wife of Pepin I King of Aquitaine (see the document CAROLINGIAN NOBILITY). The timing of the supposed arrival of Robert from Franconia, assuming that the co-identity is correct, is not ideal either. Robert would presumably have fled Germany after supporting Charles II le Chauve King of the West Franks against his brother Ludwig II \"der Deutsche King of the East Franks. This dispute is dated to 858/59: King Ludwig invaded in Aug 858, when King Charles was faced with widespread rebellion, and was defeated in Jan 859. However, Robert \"le Fort\" is already named as missus in Maine, Anjou and Touraine in Nov 853, in a document issued by King Charles II (see below), unless of course this document refers to Robert Seigneur [comte] à Sesseau, which is not impossible.\n\n· Secondly, a possible connection exists between Robert \"le Fort\" and the family of Aledramn [I] Comte de Troyes, who died in [852] (see CAROLINGIAN NOBILITY). This connection is suggested by Regino naming \"Waltgerius comes, nepos Odonis regis, filius scilicet avunculi eius Adalhelmi in Aquitanien\" when recording his fighting \"Ramnulfum et fratrem eius Gozbertum et Ebulonem abbatum de sancto Dionysio \" in Jul 892, and naming \"Megingaudus comes, nepos supradicti Odonis regis [son of Robert \"le Fort\"]\" when recording his death, also in 892 . A further indication is found in the charter dated 14 Sep 937 under which \"Hugues abbé de Saint-Martin\", grandson of Robert le Fort, donated \"son alleu de Lachy dans le comté de Meaux\" to Tours Saint-Martin, specifying that he had inherited the property from \"comte Aledramnus\" who had been granted it by Charlemagne . It should be noted that all these sources could also be explained if the family connection between Robert \"le Fort\" and Adalhelm was through the female line or even through Robert´s wife.\n\n· Thirdly, an interesting possibility is indicated by Europäische Stammtafeln which names the first wife of Comte Robert as \"[Agane]\" . Presumably the suggestion is based on the Miraculis Sancti Genulfi which names \"Agana filia Byturicensium comes Wifredus [et] Oda coniux\" as wife of \"Roberto viro primoque palatii Pipini regis\" . This \"Roberto\" can probably be identified as Robert Seigneur [comte] à Sesseau en Berry, the supposed brother of the wife of Pepin I King of Aquitaine (this relationship is referred to by Settipani, but he neither quotes nor cites the corresponding source ). Is it possible that he was the same person as Robert \"le Fort\"? Such a case would be consistent with the Saxon origin suggested by Richer and by the Miracula Sancti Benedicti (see above). The supposed father of Robert de Sesseau was Theodebert Comte de Madrie who, it is suspected, was related to the family of Nibelung and Childebrand (see CAROLINGIAN NOBILITY). The Saxon connection of the latter family is suggested by the name Theoderic (nine different individuals named Theoderic have been identified in the family), which was first recorded in Saxony in the family of Widukind by Einhard in 782 (see the document SAXONY).\n\n· Fourthly, Anatole de Barthélemy suggests that Robert was the son of Guillaume Comte de Blois, who was killed in battle in Jun 834 (see CAROLINGIAN NOBILITY) . This suggestion was accepted by René Merlet . Barthélemy bases his theory on the exchange of property in the county of Blois made by Comte Robert dated 865 (see below), concluding that Robert \"avait son principal établissement à Blois en pleine Neustrie, ce qui confirme singulièrement l´allégation d´Abbon\" (who refers to Robert´s Neustrian origin, as noted above) . Barthélemy also quotes the charter under which \"Robertus beati Martini abbas et comes\" confirmed donations to Tour Saint-Martin made \"olim ab Odone quondam comite Aurelianensi avunculo nostro et Willelmo eius filio\", dated 20 Feb \"anno XXVII regnante domino Carolo rege\" . As noted above, the dating clause of this document may either refer to King Charles II \"le Chauve\" or to Charles III \"le Simple\" King of the West Franks. In the latter case the donor was the future Robert I King of France not Robert \"le Fort\", although this would not change the significance of the relationship described (\"avunculus\" could also have been used in the document in the sense of \"great-uncle\"). As discussed further above, the term \"avunculus\" reminds us that the relationship, as described in this charter, could also have been through a sister of the two brothers Eudes Comte d´Orléans and Guillaume Comte de Blois.\n\nWhatever the truth about Robert´s parentage, his career in France is recorded with certainty from 853, although Merlet suggests that he was named in an earlier charter dated I Oct 845 , a co-identity which is not beyond doubt: Charles II \"le Chauve\" King of the West Franks restored property to Hincmar Archbishop of Reims which he had previously granted to his supporters, including property granted to \" Rotbertus \", by charter dated 1 Oct 845 .\n\nA document issued by King Charles II \"le Chauve\" dated Nov 853 names \"Dodo episcopus, Hrotbertus et Osbertus\" as missi in \"Cinnomannio, Andegavensi, atque Turonico, Corboniso, et Sagiso\" , which may refer to Robert le Fort or to Robert Seigneur [comte] à Sesseau who is named above.\n\nThe Annales Bertiniani record that \"Pippinus\" joined with \"Rotberto comiti et Britonibus\" in 859 , which suggests that Robert had earlier rebelled against King Charles II in Brittany. Robert submitted to the king's authority, when he was given command of the march of Neustria, confiscated from the Rorgonid family for supporting the revolt of Louis (later King Louis II) against his father . Regino records that King Charles II \"le Chauve\" invested \"Rodberto comiti\" with \"ducatum inter Ligerim et Sequanam adversum Brittones\" in 861 . The Annales Bertiniani record that \"Rodbertus\" attacked \"Salomone duce\" [duke of Brittany] in 862 . The Annales record that King Charles´s son, the future King Louis II \"le Bègue\", rebelled against his father in 862 and, heading an army of Bretons, defeated \"Rotbertum patris fidelem\" in 862, after which he burned Angers yet again .\n\nCount in the march of Anjou [862/63]: the creation of the \"march\" of Anjou is probably dated to the early 860s, as the Annales Bertiniani name \"Rodberto, qui marchio in Andegavo fuerat\" in 865 . This change of jurisdictional status must have been insufficient to control the Bretons and the Vikings because Robert is named in the Annales Bertiniani in 865 in the context of King Charles imposing direct rule in the area by sending \"Hludowicum filium suum\" into \"Neustriam\" and granting him \"comitatum Andegavensem et abbatiam Maioris-monasterii et quasdam villas illi\", while recording that Robert was compensated with \"comitatum Autissiodorensem et comitatum Nivernensem\".\n\n\"Le comte Robert\" donated \"certains biens situés dans le comté de Blois, dans la viguerie d´Averdon au village dit Gabrium et faisant partie du domaine de Saint-Lubin\" to Actard Bishop of Nantes in exchange for other property \"situés au même lieu et dépendant aussi du domaine de Saint-Lubin\" by charter dated May 865 . Merlet suggests that this charter indicates that Robert \"le Fort\" was Comte de Blois at the time . However, another possibility is that the county indicated was the \"march of Anjou\" as noted above.\n\nComte d'Auxerre and Comte de Nevers 865. The Annales Bertiniani name \"Rodbertus et Odo\" as \"præfecti\" in the Seine valley area in 866 when recording that they repelled the Vikings who had sailed up river as far as \"castrum Milidunum\" . \"Odo\" is presumably identified as Eudes Comte de Troyes, who died 1 Aug 871 (see CAROLINGIAN NOBILITY) and who, according to René Merlet, may have been the brother of Robert \"le Fort\" .\n\nThe Annales Bertiniani record that \"Rotbertum et Ramnulfum, Godtfridum quoque et Heriveum comites\" were defeated by the Vikings at \"Brieserta\" in 866, where Robert was killed . The Adonis Continuatio records that \"Robertus quoque atque Ramnulfus inter primos ipsi priores\" were killed by the Vikings in 866 .\n\nThe name of Comte Robert's wife or wives is not known. There are indications that he married more than once, maybe three times. One possibility can be dismissed immediately: a passage in the Chronicle of Saint-Bénigne, interpolated into the Chronicle of Alberic de Trois-Fontaines, names \"Regine, que cum esset iuvencula fuit concubina Karoli Magni iam senioris\" as wife of \"Roberti Fortis marchionis\" . This is chronologically impossible as Regina must have been born in [785] at the latest (the birth of her older son is recorded in 801), and therefore was far too old to have been Robert´s wife. Three possibilities remain:\n\n[m [firstly] ---. As noted above, Europäische Stammtafeln names \"[Agane]\" as Roberts first wife . As stated above, this is probably based on the Miraculis Sancti Genulfi which names \"Agana filia Byturicensium comes Wifredus [et] Oda coniux\" as wife of \"Roberto viro primoque palatii Pipini regis\" . As discussed above, this would mean that Robert \"le Fort\" was the same person as Robert Seigneur [comte] à Sesseau en Berry. If that is correct, Agane would have been too old to have been the mother of the recorded children of Robert \"le Fort\". The suggestion would therefore be consistent with Agane having been Robert´s first wife.]\n\n[m [secondly] ---. If the theories outlined here relating to Robert´s possible first and third marriages are correct, the chronology dictates that the wife who was the mother of his children, born in [850/60], must have been a different person. There is no indication who she might have been apart from the charter dated 20 Feb \"anno XXVII regnante domino Carolo rege\" which is discussed above. If, in accordance with one of the possibilities suggested above, the dating clause in that document refers to the reign of Charles III \"le Simple\" King of the West Franks, the donor must have been the future Robert I King of France. In which case, the relationship \"avunculus\" described in the document could have been through the donor´s mother which, if correct, would mean that Robert´s second wife could have been the niece of the brothers Eudes Comte d´Orléans and Guillaume Comte de Blois. This suggestion is inconsistent with the alternative interpretation of the same document, whereby Robert le Fort was the son of a sister of Eudes and Guillaume, which is one of the possibilities regarding Roberts ancestry as discussed above.]\n\n[m [thirdly] ---. Some secondary works assert that the wife of Robert was Adelais[de Tours], widow of Conrad Comte de Paris et d'Auxerre [Welf], daughter of Hugues Comte de Tours & his wife Ava --- . If that is correct, Adelais must have been Comte Robert's second or third wife as Conrad died after 862, by which date Robert's known children were already born. The assertion appears to be based on the Chronicle of St Bénigne de Dijon which names \"duo filii Rotberti Andegavorum comitis, frs Hugonis abbatis, senior Odo Robertus alter\" , \"Hugonis abbatis\" being the son of Conrad Comte de Paris and assuming that \"frs\" is an abbreviation for \"fratres\". Settipani states that the passage is a 12th century interpolation and has little historical value, although he does suggest the likelihood that Comte Roberts wife was a close relation of Adelais (without providing the reasoning for his statement) . A family connection between Comte Robert and Conrad Comte de Paris is also suggested by the former being invested with the county of Auxerre in 865, after this county was confiscated from the latter (as recorded by Hincmar ), on the assumption of some basis of heredity behind the transmission of counties in France at that time (which is probable, but remains unproven).\n\nComte Robert & his [second] wife had three children:\n\n1.EUDES [Odo] (in Neustria [after 852] -La Fère-sur-Oise 3 Jan 898) . Herimannus names \"Odo filius Roudperti\" when recording his assuming power in \"Gallia usque ad Ligerim et in Aquitania\" after the death of Emperor Karl III . The Chronicle of Adémar de Chabannes records that \"Odonem ducem Aquitanio\" succeeded as king of France, stating that he was \"filius Raimundi comitis Lemovicensis\" , although it is not known on what information this may be based. He succeeded his father in 866 as Marquis en Neustrie, but was dispossessed in 868 by Charles II le Chauve King of the West Franks in favour of Hugues lAbbé. He was created Comte de Paris 882-83, after unsuccessfully challenging Hugues lAbbé for his inheritance. Abbot of Saint-Martin de Tours: Odo...comes et...abbas...Sancti Martini returned property in Italy Solarium...et Vallem Caumoniam to the abbey by charter dated Apr 886, subscribed by Ademari comitis, Attonis vicecomitis... . \"Eudes comme abbé de Saint-Martin\" exchanged \"la villa de Marsat en Auvergne et la villa Dronius\" for \"les villæ Balneacum et Vineas situées en Berri dans le vicaria Corboninse\" with Frothaire Archbishop of Bourges by charter dated May 886 . He was finally invested as Marquis de Neustrie in Sep 886, following the death during the siege of Paris of Duke Heinrich (who was ancestor of the \"alte\" Babenberg family, see the document FRANCONIA NOBILITY) to whom Emperor Charles II had granted the territories of Robert le Fort on the death of Hugues lAbbé earlier in the same year . \"Odo Parisiorum pagi comes\" donated land at Fontenay, Charenton to Notre-Dame by charter dated to before 888, subscribed by \"Roberti comitis, Altmari comitis\" . He was acclaimed as EUDES King of France 29 Feb 888. He was consecrated king at Compiègne by the Archbishop of Sens. King Eudes defeated the Normans at Montfaucon-en-Argonne 24 Jun 888, after which he was recognised as king by Arnulf King of the East Franks who sent royal insignia for a second consecration at Reims 13 Nov 888 . He was succeeded by the Carolingian Charles III \"le Simple\", who had been consecrated as anti-king at Reims 28 Jan 893, as recorded in the agreement reached in 897 between the two adversaries after Eudes defeated Charles . The Annales Prumienses record the death \"898 III Non Ian\" of \"Odo rex\" . The necrology of the abbey of Saint-Denis records the death \"IV Non Jan\" of \"Odo rex\" . m as her first husband, THEODERADA, daughter of --- (-18 Oct [after 900]). \"Odo rex\" confirmed the possessions of \"monasterio Vedastino\" by charter dated 21 May [891/92] which names \"coniux nostra Theoderada\" . According to Europäische Stammtafeln , she was Theoderada, [daughter of Adelramn [II]]. The primary source on which this is based has not been identified. Settipani says that it has no historical basis . Nevertheless, Theoderic, supposed son of Adelramn [II], was a strong supporter of King Eudes, as recorded in the Annales Vedastini , which is best explained by a family connection: if the relationship is correct, he would have been Theoderada´s brother. She married secondly Otto. Her second marriage is confirmed by the Kalendarium Sanctæ Mariæ Virdunensis, which records the death \"XIV Kal Jul\" of \"Otto comes venerabilis qui dedit fratribus Haraudi montem, Bresadi villam, Samepodium\" , read together with the necrology of Verdun Cathedral which records the death \"XV Kal Nov\" of \"Theudrada regina et postea sancti monialis qui cum viro suo Hattone dedit fratribus Haraldi montem\" . These two sources make it clear that \"viro suo Hattone\" named in the second cannot refer to Eudes King of France, who would not have been called \"Otto comes\" in the first. King Eudes & his wife had [three] children:\n\na) children . King Eudes refers to his unnamed children in 889 according to Settipani, who does not cite the primary source on which this is based .\n\nb) [RAOUL ([882]-after 898).

According to Settipani, the charter is a forgery .]\n\n2.ROBERT ([860]-killed in battle near Soissons 15 Jun 923) . \"Rodbertum fratrem Odonis regis\" is named in the Cartulaire de Saint-Bertin . He was elected ROBERT I King of France in 922.\n\n- see below.\n\nROBERT, son of ROBERT \"le Fort\" Comte [de Tours], Marquis en Neustrie & his [second] wife --- ([860]-killed in battle near Soissons 15 Jun 923) . \"Rodbertum fratrem Odonis regis\" is named in the Cartulaire de Saint-Bertin . He was installed as lay abbot of Marmoutier on the death of Hugues lAbbé in 886 . He succeeded his brother in 888 as Marquis en Neustrie, and probably also as Comte de Paris, d'Orléans et de Tours. After his brother King Eudes captured Poitou in 893, he installed Robert as Comte de Poitou but the latter was expelled by Adémar, son of Comte Emenon . Abbot of Saint-Martin de Tours: \"Robert abbé de Saint-Martin\" confirmed possessions of Saint-Martin de Tours by charter dated 30 Aug 894 . Eudes King of France granted the abbey of Saint-Hilaire de Poitiers to the bishop of Poitiers, at the request of \"marchiones Hrobertus atque Ademarus\", by charter dated to [894] . After the death of his brother in 898, Robert supported Charles III King of France who seems to have confirmed Robert's position in Neustrie. Rotbertus...beati Martini abba...et comes restored cellulæ...Sancti Clementis, previously donated by predecessor noster domnus Odo germanus noster...tunc abbas deinde Francorum rex, to Saint-Martin by charter dated 13 Sep 900, subscribed by ...Attonis vicecomitis, Guarnegaudi vicecomitis, Fulconis vicecomitis, Rainaldi vicecomitis... . He rebelled against the king in 922, triggered by the confiscation of the monastery of Chelles by King Charles from Rothilde (who was the mother-in-law of Robert's son Hugues) in favour of his favourite Haganon. He was elected ROBERT I King of France 22 Jun 922, consecrated at Reims by Gauthier Archbishop of Sens. Flodoard records in 922 that \"Franci\" elected Rotbertum seniorem who was invested Remis apud Sanctum Remigium ab episcopis et primatibus regni . King Robert was killed fighting ex-King Charles, although his forces won the battle: Flodoard records in 923 that \"Karolus cum suis Lothariensibus\" crossed Mosam...ad Atiniacum...et...super Axonam where he lost the battle near Soissons in which Rotbertus...rex was killed . The necrology of Chartres cathedral records the death \"XVII Kal Jul\" of \"Rotbertus rex\" . The necrology of the abbey of Saint-Magloire records the death \"XVII Kal Jul\" of \"Robertus rex\" . The necrology of Auxerre cathedral records that \"Rotbertus rex\" was killed in battle 15 Jun .\n\nm firstly ---. The name of Robert's first wife is not known. However, as King Robert's known wife Béatrix de Vermandois could not have been the mother of his daughter Adela (married to the brother of Béatrix) it is assumed that this earlier marriage is correct. According to Europäische Stammtafeln , Robert's first wife was named AELIS. This may be based on the 21 May 907 donation of Rebais abbey to the church of Paris which refers to \"comitis Rotberti et Adele comitisse\" . However, as shown below, this is more likely to refer to Robert and his daughter than to his wife.\n\nm secondly ([897]) BEATRIX de Vermandois, daughter of HERIBERT [I] Comte de Vermandois & his wife --- ([880/83]-after 26 Mar 931). The Historia Francorum Senonensis records that \"sororem Herberti\" was the wife of \"Robertus princeps\" who rebelled against Charles III \"le Simple\" King of the West Franks . Guillaume of Jumièges records that Rodbertus dux married sororem Herberti by whom he had Hugonem Magnum . \"Hugo rector Abbatiæ sancti Martini\" names \"genitoris nostri Rotberti quondam regis ac genitricis nostræ domnæ Beatricis\" in his charter dated 26 Mar 931 . The marriage date is estimated by Werner on the assumption that the marriage accompanied the political reconciliation between Beatrix's father and Robert's uncle . If the 907 donation mentioned above in fact refers to Robert's first wife, his marriage to Beatrix would of course have taken place after that date.\n\nKing Robert I & his first wife had one child:\n\n1. [ADELA ] (before 898-). The Chronicle of Alberic de Trois-Fontaines refers to \"comitis Heriberti gener Roberti\" and in a later passage to the sister of \"dux Hugo Cappatus\" as the wife of \"comitis Heriberti de Peroni, Campanie et Veromandie\" but does not name her . Her origin is confirmed by Flodoard naming \"Hugo dux cum nepotibus suis, Heriberti filiis\" in 943 . Her birth date is estimated from the birth of her first child in [915]. Her name is deduced as follows. The 21 May 907 donation of Rebais abbey to the church of Paris refers to \"comitis Rotberti et Adele comitisse\" . Although this phrasing usually indicates husband and wife, Settipani suggests that the chronology of the life of King Robert's son Hugues (attested as Robert's son by his second wife Beatrix) favours his birth, and therefore his father's second marriage, well before 907, which would mean \"Adele\" could not have been Robert's wife. This reasoning appears based firstly on Hugues already being married in [914], and secondly on the probability of his having reached the age of majority when he was recognised as duke in 922. The 907 document is therefore explained as referring to Robert and his elder daughter. The issue, however, is not beyond doubt, especially if the document in question was misdated. m (before 21 May 907) HERIBERT [II] Comte de Vermandois, son of HERIBERT [I] Comte de Vermandois[-Carolingian] & his wife [Lietgardis] --- ([880]-23 Feb 943, bur Saint Quentin).\n\nKing Robert I & his [first/second] wife had one child:\n\n2.EMMA (-2 Nov 934) . Flodoard names \"Emma regis Rotberti filia\" when recording that she obliged Seulf Archbishop of Reims to consecrate her as queen at Reims in 923 in the absence of her husband fighting . Rodulfus Glaber names \"Emmam sororem magni Hugonis\" as wife of \"Rodulfus, Richardi ducis Burgundiæ filius\", suggesting that she was instrumental in persuading her brother to support her husband's accession as king . \"Emme nostri imperii consortis\" and \"Emma coniux mea\" is named in the charters of \"Rodolfus Francorum rex\" dated 21 Jun 931 and 1 Jul 931 . There is no indication whether Emma was born from her father's first or second marriage. From a chronological point of view, it appears that both cases are possible. Flodoard records the death of \"Emma regina\" at the end of his passage dated 934 . The necrology of the abbey of Saint-Germain-des-Prés records the death \"IV Non Nov\" of \"domna Emma regina\" . m ([911/19]) RODOLPHE [Raoul] Comte de Bourgogne, son of RICHARD le Justicier Duke of Burgundy & his wife Adélais dAuxerre [Welf] (-Auxerre, Yonne 15/16 Jan 936, bur Abbaye de Sainte-Colombe de Sens). Flodoard names \"Rodulfo filio Richardi\" . He is named \"Rodulfo rex filio meo\" in the grant of \"Adeleydis comitissa soror Rodulfi\" to Cluny dated 14 Jun 929 . Rodulfus Glaber names \"Rodulfus, Richardi ducis Burgundiæ filius\" . He succeeded his father in 921 as Duke of Burgundy. He was elected as RAOUL King of France in 13 Jul 923 at Soissons to succeed his father-in-law, consecrated by Gauthier Archbishop of Sens at the abbey of Saint-Médard de Soissons. Flodoard records in 923 that, after King Charles III had retreated \"trans Mosam\", Rodulfum...regem...[filius Richardi] was elected and consecrated apud urbem Suessonicam . Flodoard records in 936 (as the second report in that year) the death of rex Rodulfus and his burial Senonis apud sanctam Columbam . The Historia Francorum Senonensis records the death \"XVIII Kal Feb\" of \"Rodulfo rege\", specifying his burial \"in basilica aanctæ Columbæ\" . The necrology of Auxerre cathedral records the death 14 Jan of \"Rodulphus rex\" .\n\nKing Robert I & his second wife had one child:\n\n3.HUGUES ([898]-Dourdan, Essonne 16 Jun 956, bur église de l'Abbaye royale de Saint-Denis) .

He was installed as HUGUES \"le Grand\" Duc des Francs in 936.\n\n- see below, Part B.\n\nB. DUCS des FRANCS 936-987\n\nHUGUES le Grand, son of ROBERT I King of France & his second wife Beatrix de Vermandois [Carolingian] ([898]-Dourdan, Essonne 16 Jun 956, bur église de l'Abbaye royale de Saint-Denis) . Guillaume of Jumièges records that Rodbertus dux married sororem Herberti by whom he had Hugonem Magnum . The Historia Francorum Senonensis names \"Hugo Magnus\" as son of \"Robertus princeps [et] sororem Herberti\" . \"Rodbertum fratrem Odonis regis, qui erat pater Hugonis postea Francorum ducus\" is named in the Cartulaire de Saint-Bertin . Rodulfus Glaber names \"Hugo filius Rotberti, Parisiorum comitis\", commenting on the obscurity of his ancestry . He was recognised by the king as heir to his fathers lands in 914. Flodoard records in 922 that, after King Charles III had returned [from Lotharingia] to Laon, \"Hugo filius Rotberti\" arrived post pascha super Vidulam...ubi apud villam Finimas . Flodoard records in 922 that \"Rotbertus\" sent filium suum Hugonem with an army of Franks in regnum Lotharii...propter Capraemontum Gislberti castrum where he relieved the siege led by King Charles and returned after accepting hostages a quibusdam Lothariensibus . He declined the succession to the throne of France on the death of his father in 923, when his brother-in-law Raoul Duke of Burgundy was elected king. Abbot of Saint-Martin de Tours: \"l´abbé Hugues\" granted \"la ville de Mons dans le pays de Melun\" to \"la reine Emma sa sur, fille du roi Robert\" by charter dated 926 . On the death of King Raoul, Hugues once more declined the succession, instead negotiating the return from England of the Carolingian Prince Louis, son of King Charles III le Simple, who was his wife's nephew and whom he installed as King Louis IV. Hugo rector Abbatiæ sancti Martini\" names \"genitoris nostri Rotberti quondam regis ac genitricis nostræ domnæ Beatricis\" in a charter dated 26 Mar 931 . \"Hugues abbé de Saint-Martin\" donated \"son alleu de Lachy dans le comté de Meaux\", inherited from \"comte Aledramnus\", to Tours Saint-Martin by charter dated 14 Sep 937 which names \"sa femme Havis\" . The position of power acquired by Hugues is confirmed by the title dux francorum/Duc des Francs used in charters dated 25 Jul 936 and 25 Dec 936 , and the king's references to him as notre second dans tous nos royaumes. Disputes between Hugues and the king quickly followed. On the death of King Louis IV in 954, Hugues was confirmed as Duc des Francs. He was granted lordship over Burgundy and Aquitaine . He only succeeded in subjugating the former, succeeding Duke Giselbert as Duke of Burgundy in Apr 956. The Historia Francorum Senonensis records the death \"XVI Kal Iul apud Drodingam villam\" of \"Hugo Magnus dux Francorum\" and his burial \"in basilica beati Dyonisii martiris Parisius\" . The necrology of Chartres cathedral records the death \"XVI Kal Jul\" of \"Hugo dux Francorum\" . The Obituaire de Notre-Dame de Paris records the death \"XV Kal Jul\" of \"Hugo dux Francorum\" . The necrology of Auxerre cathedral records the death 16 Jun of \"Hugo comes\" .\n\nm firstly ([914]) [JUDITH] du Maine, daughter of ROGER Comte du Maine & his wife Rothilde [Carolingian] (before 900-925). The marriage of Hugues Comte de Paris with the daughter of Roger Comte du Maine is deduced from Flodoard naming \"Rothildis, amitæ suæ [regis Karoli], socrus autem Hugonis\" when recording that the king deprived her of \"abbatiam Golam\" [Chelles] in favour of his favourite Hagano, the context dictating that \"Hugonis\" was \"Hugo filius Rotberti\" . The source which names her father has not yet been identified, but it appears reasonably certain from the sources quoted in the document MAINE that Rothilde's husband was Roger. She is named Judith in Europäische Stammtafeln but the primary source on which this is based has not been identified. According to Settipani her name is not known .\n\nm secondly ([926]) EADHILD, daughter of EDWARD I \"the Elder\" King of Wessex & his second wife Ælfleda (-937). Flodoard mentions, but does not name, \"filiam Eadwardi regis Anglorum, sororem coniugis Karoli\" when recording her marriage to \"Hugo filius Rotberti\" in 926 . William of Malmesbury names (in order) \"Edfleda, Edgiva, Ethelhilda, Ethilda, Edgitha, Elfgiva\" as the six daughters of King Eadweard and his wife \"Elfleda\", specifying that Ethilda married \"Hugh\". The Book of Hyde names \"Ethyldam\" as fourth of the six daughters of King Edward by his first wife \"Elfelmi comitis filia Elfleda\", specifying that she married \"pater Hugonis Capet\" . At the time of the couple's betrothal, her future husband sent sumptuous gifts to King Æthelstan, including spices, jewels, richly caparisoned horses, three holy relics and a gold crown .\n\nm thirdly ([9 May/14 Sep] 937) HEDWIG of Germany, daughter of HEINRICH I King of Germany & his second wife Mathilde [Immedinger] ([922]-9 Jan [958 or after 965]). \"Hugues abbé de Saint-Martin\" donated \"son alleu de Lachy dans le comté de Meaux\", inherited from \"comte Aledramnus\", to Tours Saint-Martin by charter dated 14 Sep 937 which names \"sa femme Havis\" . Rodulfus Glauber names \"sororem [=Otto] Haduidem\" as wife of \"Hugo dux Francorum cognomento Magnus\" . Flodoard refers to \"sororem Othonis regis Transfhenensis, filiam Heinrici\" as the wife of \"Hugo princeps, filius Roberti\", without naming her, recording their marriage in 938 . Flodoard also refers to \"relicta Hugonis\" as \"amita Lotharius rex\" . The Annales Nivernenses record in 958 that \"rex et mater sua et Ugo filius Ugonis et mater sua\" attended a hearing \"apud Marziacum vicum iuxta Nevernis contra Guillelmum comitem Aquitaniæ post missa sancti Martini\" . The necrology of the abbey of Saint-Denis records the death \"V Id Jan\" of \"Hadhuidis comitissa\" .\n\nMistress (1): RAINGARDE [Ringare], daughter of ---. The Historia Episcoporum Autissiodorensium names \"Heribertus Francigena filius Hugonis Ducis cognomento Magni ex concubina Raingarda\" as bishop of Auxerre from 971 to 995 . The same source names \"Johannes natione Autissiodorensis, patre Ansaldo, matre Raingarde\" as bishop of Auxerre from 996 to 998 . The same name in the same area suggests the possibility that Raingarde, mistress of Duke Hugues, was the same person as the wife of Ansoud [I].\n\nDuke Hugues & his [second/third] wife had one child:\n\n1.BEATRIX(-23 Sep 1003) . Flodoard refers to \"Hugonis principis filiam\" marrying \"Fredericus, frater Adalberonis episcopi\" in 954 . The Gesta Episcoporum Virdunensium names \"Beatricis, Hugonis Capitonis Francorum regis sororis\" as wife of \"ducis Frederici\" . The Chronicle of Alberic de Trois-Fontaines names \"sororem [Otto filius Hugo rex dux Burgundie] Beatricem\" as wife of \"Fridericus dux Mosellanorum\" . There is no proof of the identity of the mother of Beatrix, although it is unlikely that she was the daughter of her father's first wife given the date of her marriage. She acted as regent of Upper Lotharingia for her son Duke Thierry I from 978 to 987, taking an active part in the government of the duchy. She intervened with her brother Hugues Capet over the capture of her son by French troops during the siege of Verdun in 985, and actively attempted to resolve the Franco/German conflict over Lotharingia by diplomatic means. She was imprisoned in an abbey by her son, impatient to assume personal rule, but the Pope obliged him to release her. She visited the monastery of Saint-Dié in 1003 with her family . m (Betrothed 951, [10 Sep/12 Nov] 954) FREDERIC Comte, son of WIGERICH [III] Graf im Bidgau, Pfalzgraf & his wife Cunegondis --- ([910/15]-[Jun/Jul] 978).

The Liber Modernorum Regum Francorum records the marriage in 956 of \"Richardus filius Guillelmi principis Normannorum\" with \"filiam Hugonis ducis\", although she is not named . Guillaume of Jumièges records the betrothal of Hugo dux...filiam suam...Emmam and puerum Richardum, with the consent of Bernardi Silvanectensis, and in a later passage their marriage . No direct proof has yet been found that Emma was the daughter of her father's third marriage. However, this is likely given that betrothals at the time normally took place when the female partner was still a child or in early adolescence. Guillaume of Jumièges records the death without children of Emma uxor eius filia Hugonis Magni . m (Betrothed 956, Rouen 960) as his first wife, RICHARD I Sans Peur\" Comte [de Normandie], GUILLAUME \"Longuespée\" Comte [de Normandie] & his first wife Sprota --- (Fécamp [932]-Fécamp 20 Nov 996, bur Fécamp).

Flodoard names \"Hugonem et Oddonem clericum\" as brothers of \"Otto filius Hugonis\", when he records that the rectores of Burgundy named them as his successors . Rodulfus Glauber names \"Hugoni, Parisiensis ducis filio illius Magni Hugonis\", specifying that his mother was \"Ottone sorore\" . His father named Richard Comte [de Normandie] as Hugues's guardian in 956, the arrangement being confirmed by Richard's betrothal to the sister of Hugues. The Annales Nivernenses record in 958 that \"rex et mater sua et Ugo filius Ugonis et mater sua\" attended a hearing \"apud Marziacum vicum iuxta Nevernis contra Guillelmum comitem Aquitaniæ post missa sancti Martini\" . He was installed as Duc des Francs/dux Francorum by Lothaire King of the West Franks in 960. By 974, Hugues had become effective leader of France under King Lothaire and headed the army which retook the kingdom of Lotharingia from Otto II King of Germany in 978 . He was elected HUGUES \"Capet\" King of France by an assembly of nobles at Senlis 29 May 987, after the death of Louis V King of France. He was consecrated at Noyon 1 Jun 987. Charles Duke of Lotharingia, the late king's uncle who opposed the accession of King Hugues, captured Laon in [May] 988, and Reims in [Aug/Sep] 989, with the help of his nephew Arnoul Archbishop of Reims, but was finally captured at Laon in 991 . The Historia Francorum Senonensis records the death in 998 of \"Hugo rex\" and his burial \"in basilica beati Dyonisii martiris Parisius\" . The necrology of the abbey of Saint-Denis records the death \"IX Kal Nov\" of \"Hugo rex\" .\n\nm ([968]) ADELAIS [de Poitou, daughter of GUILLAUME III Tête d'Etoupes Duke of Aquitaine [GUILLAUME I Comte de Poitou] & his wife Adela [Gerloc] de Normandie] ([950/55]-15 Jun [1004]). There is some doubt about Adelais´s ancestry. The 11th century Translatio S. Maglorii et aliorum names \"Adelaide filia Pictavorum comitis, de progenie Caroli Magni\" as the wife of \"Hugone, Francorum duce\", clarifying that the latter refers to Hugues \"Capet\" King of France when it names \"Roberto rege, memorati ducis filio\" . This Poitevin origin is also suggested by Richer when he records that King Robert \"ob nepotem suum Wilelmum\" besieged \"in Aquitania Hildebertum\" . It is assumed that such a relationship between King Robert and Duke Guillaume would be through the king's mother as no family connection through his father has been established. Some doubt is introduced by the Chronicle of Ademar de Chabannes which recounts the dispute between \"Dux Aquitanorum Willelmus\" and King Hugues, as well as the subsequent peace agreed between the parties in 990, without mentioning that the duke was the king's brother-in-law , all the more surprising if the Poitevin origin is correct as Ademar concentrates on Poitevin affairs and includes genealogical details in his narrative. Another possible ancestry is suggested by Helgaud's Vita Roberti Regis which names \"Rex Francorum Rotbertus patre Hugone, matre Adhelaide\", specifying that \"ab Ausonis partibus descenderat\" . Settipani equates \"Ausonia\" with Rome or Italy , although no other reference to an Italian origin for Adelais has yet been identified. The Chronicle of Alberic de Trois-Fontaines refers to the mother of \"rex Francorum Robertus\" as \"superiorem regum Anglie soror\" , but it is difficult to see to whom this could refer or how it could be correct. The paucity of references in contemporary sources to the wife of Hugues Capet and her origin contrasts with the frequent references to his mother and to the wives of his son King Robert II. This suggests that the background of Queen Adelais may have been obscure and that her family had little political influence at the time, although this would be surprising as her husband already enjoyed a position of some power at the Carolingian court at the time of his marriage. Maybe her family was prominent when the couple married but suffered a subsequent decline by the time her husband was elected king. Nevertheless, an Aquitainian marriage would have fitted the political circumstances of the time. After several decades of dispute between the Capet and Poitou families, a permanent peace appears to have been established from about the time the marriage took place . The necrology of the abbey of Saint-Denis records the death \"XVII Kal Jul\" of \"Adelaidis regina\" .\n\n[Mistress (1): ---. The name of King Hugues's possible mistress is not known.]\n\nKing Hugues & his wife had three children:\n\n1.GISELA de France ([970] -). The Chronique de Saint Riquier records that Hugues \"Capet\" King of France granted the château d'Abbeville \"à un chevalier nommé Hugues\" who had married the king's daughter \"Gisèle\" . m (before 987) HUGUES ---, son of --- (-4 Jul [1000]). Hugues Capet King of France separated Abbeville, Ancre and Domart from the Abbaye de Saint-Riquier and gave them to Hugues, who was known as the avoué de Saint-Riquier . These territories became the foundation of the county of Ponthieu.\n\n2.HEDWIGE [Avoie] de France ([969] -after 1013 ). The Genealogiæ Scriptoris Fusniacensis names \"Robertum regem et filiam Hadevidem comitissam Hainonensium\" as the children of King Hugues . The Chronicle of Alberic de Trois-Fontaines also names \"soror regis Roberti Hadwidis\" as wife of \"Rainero comiti de Hainaco, fratri Lamberti comitis de Lovanio\" . Sigebert's Chronica records in 977 that \"Raginerus\" married \"Hathuidem filiam Hugonis postea regis\" . \"Comes Raginerus et Hathuidis coniux\" are named in the Gesta of Gembloux Abbey . Her brother gave her the towns of Couvin, Fraisne, Nîme, Eve and Bens [all now in Belgium] as her dowry on her marriage. \"Raginero comite et Hathuidis coniunx eius\" donated property at Gion to Gembloux by charter dated to [1013] . \"Heinricus Romanorum imperator augustus\" took into his protection the abbey of Florennes founded by \"Gerardus in primis meus capellanus postea Cameracensis episcopus effectus et fratres sui Godefridus et Arnulphus\" by charter dated 1018, which refers to earlier donations of property by \"comitissa Hawidis, annuentibus filiis suis comite Raginero et Lamberto\" . \"Chuonradus Romanorum imperator augustus\" confirmed the foundation of Florennes abbey by charter dated 1033, which records among others the donation of \"comitissa Hadegundis, annuentibus comite Raginero et Lamberto filiis suis in Prona sita in pago Haynomensi\" . The identity of \"comitissa Hawidis/Hadegundis\", and therefore the existence of Lambert, supposed brother of Reginar [V] Comte de Hainaut, is not certain. Hedwige, wife of Reginar [IV] Comte de Hainaut, is the most obvious candidate. If this is correct, the donation must have been made after her husband's death in 1013 as he is not named in the document. The other possibility is that the donor was the mother of Reginar [IV] Comte de Hainaut and his brother Lambert [I] Comte de Louvain. However, the name of the wife of their father, Reginar [III] Graf im Maasgau, is recorded elsewhere as Adela (see the document BRABANT). m ([996]) REGINAR IV Comte de Hainaut, son of REGINAR [III] Graf im Maasgau & his wife Adela [von Dachsburg] (after 947-1013).\n\n3.ROBERT de France (Orléans ([27 Mar] 972-Château de Melun 20 Jul 1031, bur église de l'Abbaye royale de Saint-Denis) .

André de Fleury´s Vita Gauzlini records that Gauzlinus was ex liberiori totius Galliæ stirpe fertur ingenuam genituram excepisse . These oblique references have been interpreted as meaning that the father of Gauzlin was King Hugues \"Capet\" , although this is not beyond doubt. Kerrebrouck also casts doubt on this assumed paternity of Gauzlin . Abbot of Fleury [1005]. Archbishop of Bourges 1013. André de Fleury´s Vita Gauzlini records the death of Gaucelin Castellionis and in a later passage his burial Floriacum .]\n\nThe precise relationship between the following person and the family of the Capetian kings has not been established.

He was invested as associate-king with his father 25 Dec 987, consecrated 1 Apr 988 at the cathedral of Sainte-Croix in Orléans . He succeeded his father in 996 as ROBERT II \"le Pieux\" King of France. He claimed the duchy of Burgundy on the death of his paternal uncle Duke Henri in 1002, but took 12 years to complete its conquest in the face of opposition from Otto-Guillaume Comte de Mâcon . After the death of Emperor Heinrich II in 1024, King Robert supported the rebels (led by Frédéric II Duke of Upper Lotharingia) opposed to King Konrad II but he refused the crown of Italy which they offered to him. Robert nevertheless sent troops to attack Metz, but was repulsed . The Chronicle of Alberic de Trois-Fontaines records the death in 1031 of \"rex Francorum Robertus\" . Rodolfus Glaber records the death of King Robert at Melun in July and his place of burial . The necrology of Chartres cathedral records the death \"XII Kal Aug\" of \"Rotbertus rex\" .

Regino records that two of the daughters (unnamed) of ex-King Berengario were brought up in the imperial palace by the empress after being brought to Germany . One of these two daughters was presumably Rozala, bearing in mind that the emperor arranged her marriage. The Genealogica Comitum Flandriæ Bertiniana names \"filiam Berengeri regis Langobardorum, Ruzelam quæ et Susanna\" as wife of Comte Arnoul . The Annales Elnonenses Minores record the marriage [undated between 950 and 968] of \"Arnulfus iunior\" and \"filiam Beregeri regis Susannam\" . Her marriage was presumably arranged by Emperor Otto to increase his influence in Flanders at a time when Lothaire IV King of the West Franks was asserting his own control over the county. According to Nicholas, Count Arnoul II married Rozala di Ivrea when he reached the age of majority in 976 , but the source on which this is based has not been located. \"Baldwinus marchysus cum matre sua Susanna\" donated \"villam Aflingehem jacentem in pago Tornacinse\" to Saint-Pierre de Gand, after the death of \"Arnulfi marchysi\", by charter dated 1 Apr 988, signed by \" Waldberto advocato, Theoderico comite, Arnulfo comite, Artoldo comite, Baldwino comite, item Arnulfo comite \" . The Vita Sancti Bertulfi names \"Rozala filia Berengarii Regis Italiæ\", specifying that \"post mortem Arnulfi [Balduini filius] principis, Roberto Regi Francorum nupsit et Susanna dicta\" . Kerrebrouck, presumably basing his supposition on this passage from the Vita Sancti Bertulfi, says that she adopted the name Suzanne on her second marriage , but the sources quoted above show that she was referred to by this name earlier. Hugues \"Capet\" King of France arranged her second marriage to his son and heir, apparently as a reward for Flemish help when he seized power in 987 . She was given Montreuil-sur-Mer by the county of Flanders as her dowry on her second marriage. Richer records that King Robert repudiated his wife \"Susannam genere Italicam eo quod anus esset\" but refused to allow her to retake her castle at Montreuil, whereupon she constructed another nearby . She returned to Flanders after she was repudiated by her second husband, and became one of the principal advisers of her son Count Baldwin IV. France retained Montreuil-sur-Mer. \"Susanna regina cum filio suo Baldwino\" donated \"alodem suum Atingehem et in Testereph\" to Saint-Pierre de Gand, for the soul of \"filie sue Mathildis\", by charter dated 26 Jun 995 . \"Susanna regina cum filio suo Baldwino\" donated \"alodem suum in pago Flandrensi in Holtawa in Fresnere in Clemeskirca in Jatbeka in Sclefteta \" to Saint-Pierre de Gand by charter dated 1 Jun 1003 . The Annales Elnonenses Minores records the death in 1003 of \"Susanna regina\" . The Memorial of \"regina Susanna\" records her death \"VII Feb\" .\n\nm secondly ([late 996/early 997], divorced Sep 1001) BERTHE of Burgundy, widow of EUDES I Comte de Blois et de Chartres, daughter of CONRAD I le Pacifique King of Burgundy [Welf] & his wife Mathilde de France [Carolingian] ([964/965]-16 Jan after 1010). The Liber Modernorum Regum Francorum names \"Berta filia Conradi regis Burgundiæ\" as wife of \"Odone comite Carnotensium\" . This origin is corroborated by Rodulfus Glauber who names \"Odo natus ex filia Chuonradi regis Austrasiorum, Berta nomine\" . Odo comes restored villam...Culturas to Marmoutier, for the souls of ...domini Hugonis archiepiscopi, cujus ibi corpus...jacet, by charter dated to [986], subscribed by Berte comitissæ uxoris eius, majoris filii eius Teutboldi, filii eius Odonis adhuc in cunabulo . Richer records that King Robert married \"Berta Odonis uxor\" . Berta...regina cum filiis meis Tetbaldo...episcopo nec non Odoni comitis donated tonlieu over boats at Blois to Marmoutier by undated charter . Pope Gregory V called on King Robert to repudiate his wife in 998 on grounds of consanguinity. The request was repeated in 1001 by the court of Rome. Robert at first refused and the kingdom of France was excommunicated . \"Bertæ reginæ, Odonis comitis filii eius \" subscribed the charter dated 1004 under which \"Gislebertus prepositus\" recorded a donation . The king, in reaction to the 1108 assassination of his favourite Hugues de Beauvais who had served Queen Berthe, visited Rome in 1008 in an unsuccessful attempt to divorce his third wife in order to take back Berthe . \"Odonis comitis, Ermengardis uxoris eius, Bertæ reginæ \" subscribed the charter dated after 1005 under which \"comitem Odonem\" donated property \"in comitatu Dunensi Boscus Medius\" to \"Sancti Petri\" . The necrology of Chartres cathedral records the death \"XVII Kal Feb\" of \"Berta mater Odonis comitis\" .\n\nm thirdly (after Sep 1001 before 25 Aug 1003) CONSTANCE d'Arles, daughter of GUILLAUME II le Libérateur Comte dArles [Provence] et Marquis & his second wife Adelais [Blanche] dAnjou ([987/89]-Château de Melun 22 or 25 Jul 1032, bur église de l'Abbaye royale de Saint-Denis). The Historia Francorum names \"Constantiam, filiam Guillelmi comitis Arelatensis, natam de Blanca sorore Gaufridi comitis Andegavensis\" as wife of King Robert . The Chronicle of Alberic de Trois-Fontaines also names \"Constantia filia fuit Blanche comitisse Arelatensis\" as wife of \"Robertus rex\" . The Chronicon Hugonis names \"Constantiam\" as wife of \"Robertus\", specifying that she was \"cognatam Hugonis Autisiodorensis episcopi comitis Cabilonensis\" . This is presumably based on Rodulfus Glaber who states incorrectly that \"Constantiam filiam prioris Willemi Aquitanie ducis\" was wife of King Robert II, specifying that she was \"cognatam\" of Hugues Comte de Chalon Bishop of Auxerre . The only relationship so far identified between the two is that Constance's maternal uncle, Geoffroy I Comte d'Anjou, was the second husband of the mother of Comte Hugues. Rodulfus Glauber dates her marriage to \"about the year 1000\" . The king attempted to separate from Constance in 1008 in order to take back his second wife, according to Rodulfus Glaber through the influence of \"Hugo dictus Beluacensis\" , but he restored Constance's royal prerogatives end-1009 . She opposed her husband's proposal to crown their second son Henri as associate king in 1026, supporting the candidature of her third son Robert . She organised two revolts against King Robert, and another against her son King Henri I after his accession in 1031 . Rodolfus Glaber records the death of Queen Constance in the same city as her husband [Melun] and in the same month [July] in the following year, as well as her place of burial . The necrology of the abbey of Saint-Germain-des-Prés records the death \"XI Kal Aug\" of \"regina Constancia\" . The necrology of Argenteuil Priory records the death \"VIII Kal Aug\" of \"Constancia regina\" .\n\nKing Robert & his third wife had [seven] children:\n\n1. [CONSTANCE . There is no proof that Constance, wife of Manassès de Dammartin, was the daughter of King Robert II, the affiliation being proposed for onomastic reasons only . The connection is suggested by the presence of the king and queen at a donation by \"Manasses comes\" dated 4 Feb 1031 . On the other hand, Rodolfus Glaber records that King Robert had two daughters by his wife Constance , presumably referring to Hedwige and Adela, so ignoring any daughter named Constance. According to Europäische Stammtafeln , the wife of Manassès was \"Constance [de Dammartin]\", presumably on the theory that she brought her husband the county of Dammartin. m ([1023 or before]) MANASSES Comte de Dammartin-en-Goële, son of [HILDUIN [I] de Montdidier Seigneur de Ramerupt & his wife ---] (-killed in battle Ornel, near Etain, Bar-le-Duc 15 Nov or 15 Dec 1037).]\n\n2.HEDWIGE [Avoie] de France ([1003]-5 Jun after 1063) . Rodolfus Glaber records that \"Rainaldus Landrici comitis filius\" married a daughter of King Robert . The Chronici Hugonis Floriacensis names \"Adelaidem Rainaldi comitis Nivernensis uxorem\" as the daughter of King Robert and his wife Constance . The Historia Nivernensium Comitum records that the wife of \"Renaldum\" was \"sorori Regis Roberti, filii Hugonis Capitonis\" . The Annales Vizeliacenses also specifies that Renaud's wife was the sister not daughter of King Robert II . However, this is chronologically unlikely given that King Robert and his known sisters were born in the 970s, more than twenty years before the earliest possible date of birth of Comte Renaud. Her marriage was agreed by her father as part of his alliance with Landry Comte de Nevers after capturing Auxerre, which the king gave to his daughter as dowry . \"Rainaldus comes Nivernensis\" donated property \"Belmontis\" to Cluny, for the souls of \" uxoris mee Advise \" by charter dated to [1028/40] . She founded the abbeys of Crisenon and Issenon. m (1006, soon after 25 Jan 1016) RENAUD [I] de Nevers, son of LANDRY Comte de Nevers & his wife Mathilde de Bourgogne-Comté (-killed in battle Sainte-Vertu, Yonne 29 May 1040, bur Auxerre, Saint-Germain).

He was killed in battle against Robert I Duke of Burgundy, his brother-in-law.\n\n3.HUGUES de France (1007-28 Aug 1025, bur Compiègne, church of the Abbaye de Saint-Corneille). The Historia Francorum names (in order) \"Hugonem qui cognominatus est Magnus, Henricum, Robertum, Odonem\" as the four sons of King Robert and Constance . He was consecrated associate-king 9 Jun 1017, at Compiègne, church of the Abbaye de Saint-Corneille, when he was \"barely ten years old\" according to Rodolfus Glaber . He rebelled against his father claiming the full authority of his position as associate-king, but later submitted . The necrology of the abbey of Saint-Germain-des-Prés records the death \"V Kal Sep\" of \"Hugo iuvenis rex Francorum\" .

Rodulfus Glauber names \"Heinricus rex germanium suum Rotbertum\" when recording the latter's installation as duke of Burgundy by his brother . His mother supported him as candidate to be consecrated associate king in 1027, in place of his older brother Henri who was supported by their father. His father named him heir to the duchy of Burgundy in 1030. He was installed as ROBERT I \"le Vieux\" Duke of Burgundy in 1032 by his brother King Henri I.\n\n- DUKES of BURGUNDY.\n\n6.EUDES de France ([1013]-Germigny-des-Prés, near Sully, Loiret 15 May [1057/59]). The Historia Francorum names (in order) \"Hugonem qui cognominatus est Magnus, Henricum, Robertum, Odonem\" as the four sons of King Robert and Constance . He allied himself with Eudes II Comte de Blois in the war against his brother Henri I King of France 1034-1041. He was defeated and imprisoned at Orléans. After his release, he fought for the king in Normandy, but was defeated in 1054 at Mortemer. Orderic Vitalis records the war between the Normans and \"Henricum regem\" in 1054 when \"Odonem fratrem suum\" was defeated by \"Roberti Aucensis comiitis et Rogerii de Mortuomari\" who led the Norman forces \"apud Mortuum-mare\" . He owned land near Bellême .

The Chronicle of Alberic de Trois-Fontaines names \"soror regis Henrici Adela\" as wife of \"Balduino Insulano\" . The Genealogiæ Scriptoris Fusniacensis names \"Alam comitissam Flandrensem\" as the daughter of King Robert . She is named as daughter of King Robert in a manuscript whose attribution to Orderic Vitalis is disputed, which also refers to her marriage . Kerrebrouck mentions her betrothal to Duke Richard \"très jeune\" but does not cite the primary source on which this is based . \"Richardus Nortmannorum dux\" agreed grants of property to \"Adela\" on the occasion of their marriage by charter dated Jan 1026, which does not specify her parentage . Her father gave her the seigneurie of Corbie as her dowry. Ctss de Contenance. She founded the Benedictine monastery at Messines near Ypres. Philippe I King of France donated villam in pago Parisiacensi sitam...Curtesiolum to Saint-Denis, at the request of amita mea soror...patris mei H...Adela, by charter dated 1060, after 4 Aug . The necrology of the abbey of Saint-Denis records the death \"VI Id Jan\" of \"Adelaidis comitissa\" . Betrothed (Jan 1027) to RICHARD III Duke of Normandy, son of RICHARD I Duke of Normandy & his first wife Judith de Bretagne ([1001]-6 Aug 1027). m (Amiens 1028) BAUDOUIN de Flandre, son of BAUDOUIN IV \"le Barbu/Pulchrae Barbae\" Count of Flanders & his first wife Ogive de Luxembourg ([1012/13]-Lille 1 Sep 1067, bur Lille, Saint-Pierre). He succeeded his father in 1035 as BAUDOUIN V le Pieux/Insulanus Count of Flanders. He was regent of France for his nephew Philippe I King of France 1060-1066/67.\n\nHENRI de France, son of ROBERT II \"le Pieux\" King of France & his third wife Constance d'Arles [Provence] ([end 1009/May 1010]-Palais de Vitry-aux-Loges, forêt dOrléans, Loiret 4 Aug 1060, bur église de l'Abbaye royale de Saint-Denis) . The Historia Francorum names (in order) \"Hugonem qui cognominatus est Magnus, Henricum, Robertum, Odonem\" as the four sons of King Robert and Constance . His father installed him as Duke of Burgundy 25 Jan 1016 after completing his conquest of the duchy . He was consecrated associate-king 14 May 1027, at Notre-Dame, Reims, despite the opposition of his mother. He rebelled against his father, together with his brother Robert, 1029-1031, and captured Dreux, Beaune and Avallon . He succeeded his father in 1031 as HENRI I King of France, at which time the duchy of Burgundy was given to his younger brother Robert. In light of his mothers continuing opposition to his succession, he was obliged to take refuge briefly in Normandy in 1033. He regained control with the help of Robert II Duke of Normandy. A fragmentary chronicle records the death Vitriaci in 1059 of Ainricus . The Chronicle of Saint-Pierre de Sens records the death in 1060 apud Vitriacum castrum in Brieria of Rex Hainricus and his burial in Basilica S. Dionysii . Merlet reviews all these sources but, based on other documentation, concludes that the king must have died at Dreux . He refers to the charter of King Henri dated 1060 at Dreux (Drocis castro), under which the king confirmed the foundation of the priory of Saint-Germain de Brezolles, which records the presence of Agobert Bishop of Chartres and various other members of the chapter of Chartres . Merlet refers to Orderic Vitalis who states that at the end of his life the king was treated by a doctor, also from Chartres Joanne...Surdus cognominabatur, but died suddenly from the effects of drinking water against the medical advice . He then highlights the supplementary addition at the end of the charter in question which states that post mortem patris, Philippus rex cum matre regina signed the document Drocis castro in sua aula . This addition is dated anno secundo sui regni, but Merlet attributes the delay to the lapse of time which in medieval times frequently occurred between the action and finalising the corresponding documentation, a practice which is discussed in detail by Giry . The monastery of Saint-Denis´s Historia Regum Francorum records that King Henri died civitate Senonis . The Annales Nivernenses record the death \"1060 II Non Aug\" of \"Henricus rex, Rotberti regis filius\" .

Wipo names \"filia imperatoris Chuonradi et Giselæ, Mahthilda\" when recording her death and burial at Worms in 1034, specifying that she was betrothed to \"Heinrico regi Francorum\" . Her marriage was arranged to confirm a peace agreement between King Henri and Emperor Konrad at Deville in May 1033 . Her absence from the list of deceased relatives in the donation of \"Chuonradus Romanorum imperator augustus\" to the church of Worms by charter dated 30 Jan 1034 suggests that Mathilde died after that date, while her absence from the list of the children of Emperor Konrad named in the same charter may be explained by her youth .\n\nm firstly (1034) MATHILDE, daughter of --- ([1025/26]-Paris 1044, bur église de l'Abbaye royale de Saint-Denis). Rodolfus Glaber records that King Henri married \"Mathildem de regno eius ex Germanie nobilioribus\" . Her precise origin is not known. A manuscript entitled \"Excerptum Historicum\" records the marriage of \"rex Henricus\" and \"neptem Henrici Alamannorum Imperatoris\", commenting that the couple had a daughter who died young and that King Henri's wife died soon after . The Historia of Monk Aimon records that King Henri married \"neptem Henrici Alamaniæ Imperatoris\" in 1034 . Szabolcs de Vajay suggests that she was Mathilde, daughter of Liudolf Markgraf von Friesland [Braunschweig] & his wife Gertrud von Egisheim, her supposed father being the uterine half-brother of Emperor Heinrich III.

Foulques IV \"le Rechin\" Comte d'Anjou ceded Château-Landon and Gâtinais to him in 1069, in return for the king's recognition of his accession as count . King Philippe pursued this policy of expanding his territories, adding Corbie in 1074, acquiring part of Vermandois on the death of Raoul Comte de Vermandois in 1074, invading Vexin in 1077, and taking possession of Bourges in 1100 . In 1071, after ineffectively helping Arnoul III Count of Flanders against his uncle Robert, the latter made peace with King Philippe and arranged the king's marriage to his stepdaughter.

The Gesta Hungarorum records that King András forced the marriage of \"Salomoni regi\" and \"Henricus imperator Sophiam suam filiam\", specifying that she had earlier been betrothed to \"filio regis Franciæ\" . This could only refer to the future Philippe I King of France as it is unlikely that the emperor's daughter would have been betrothed to his younger brother. This betrothal is not corroborated in the western European primary sources so far consulted.\n\nm firstly (1072, repudiated 1092) BERTHA of Holland, daughter of FLORIS I Count of Holland & his wife Gertrud of Saxony[-Billung] ([1058]-Montreuil-sur-Mer, Pas-de-Calais 15 Oct 1094).

The Chronologia Johannes de Beke names (in order) \"Theodricum et Florencium et Machtildim\" as children of Count Floris & his wife, specifying that \"Machtildim\" married \"Philippus rex Francie\" after the death of her father which indicates that \"Machtildim\" in this text is an error for Bertha . Her marriage was arranged as part of the settlement under which her future husband recognised her stepfather as Count of Flanders . She was repudiated after King Philippe abducted Bertrade de Montfort from her husband, and was sent to Montreuil . The necrology of the abbey of Saint-Victor records the death \"Id Oct\" of \"Berta mater Ludovici regis\" .

Orderic Vitalis records that Bertrada...Andegavorum comitissa, fearing that her husband was about to treat her like his previous two wives, sought protection from Philippo regi Francorum who repudiated his own wife and married her, the ceremony being conducted by Odo Bajocensis episcopus . The De Genere Comitum Flandrensium, Notæ Parisienses names \"Fulconi Richin Andegavensi comiti uxorem suam nomine Bertradam\" as second wife of King Philippe, specifying that the king abducted her from her first husband after repudiating his first wife . William of Tyre records this marriage . Pope Urban II at the Council of Autun excommunicated the king 16 Oct 1094, confirmed at the Council of Clermont 18/28 Nov 1095 .

After her second marriage, she remained with her husband in Apulia and never visited Palestine . She was regent for her son in Italy after the death of her second husband . She claimed the title \"Queen\" as daughter of the king of France.

His half-brother installed him as Comte de Mantes and Seigneur de Mehun-sur-Yèvre in [1104]. Suger's Vita Ludovici records the rebellion of \"regis Ludovici Philippus frater\" against his brother, supported by \"Amalricus de Monte Forti avunculus eius\" and \"Fulco comes Andegavensis postea rex Hierosolymitanus frater eius\", and the confiscation of his castles of Montlhéry and Mantes . \"Fulco iunior Andegavensium comes Fulconis comitis filius\" donated property to the abbey of Fontevraud with the consent of \"Bertrade regina matre meo, Philipo fratre meo\" by charter dated to [1109/1112/13] .

The Chronica Regum Francorum records the betrothal of \"unus illorum Regis illegitimus ex comitissa Andegavensi\" and \"filiam Milonis de Montlehery\" . The dating clause of a charter dated to [1106/07] refers to the first year in which \"Philippus filius Philippi regis Francorum\" married \"Helizabeth filiam Guidonis Trosselli\" .\n\n5.FLEURI [Florus] de France ([1095]-after 1119) . The Historia Regum Francorum Monasterii Sancti Dionysii names \"Philippum et Florum et filiam unam\" children of \"Philippus rex [et] Fulconi Rechin Andagavorum comiti uxorem\" . Orderic Vitalis names Philippum et Florum as the children of King Philippe by his second marriage . A document dated Jul 1213 records that \"rex Franciæ Grossus rex fratrem Florium filia Isabellis de Nangies domina de Venisiaco\" . He was living in Anjou with his mother in 1117. Seigneur de Nangis, presumably by right of his wife. m [--- de Nangis, daughter & heiress of --- de Nangis & his wife ---]. Her parentage and marriage are assumed because her daughter is called \"Isabellis de Nangies\" in the source quoted below. Fleuri & his wife had [two] children:\n\na)ISABELLE de Nangis ([1118]-[after 1166/67]) . Documents dated Jul 1213 and Aug 1213, relating to the consanguinity between Erard de Brienne Seigneur de Ramerupt and his wife Philippa of Jerusalem, record \"rex Franciæ Grossus rex fratrem Florium filia Isabellis de Nangies domina de Venisiaco\", adding that her daughter was \"domina de Venisiaco, mater [Erardum de Rameruco] [Erardum de Brena]\", another document in the series clarifying that Isabelle was the mother of \"Aalaidis dominæ Venisiaci mater Erardi\" . Dame de Nangis. A charter dated to after 1151 recites the donation of feodum de Thori by Symon Pichered to Dilo abbey, confirmed by \"Garnerus de Venisiaco a quo feodum illud Symon tenebat et uxor Garini Petronilla sed et filius eius Ansellus\", and a later donation confirmed by \"Ansellus de Venisiaco et frater Anselli, Freherus, sed et uxor sua Elisabeth\", as well as other donations by Anseau, Isabelle and Ferry . She is named in the cartulary of Preuilly . According to Europäische Stammtafeln, Isabelle married firstly \"Guy de Marolles\", adding that he joined the crusade in 1141 and died in Palestine . The primary source on which this is based is not known. However, under a charter dated to [1166/67], Louis VII King of France confirmed donations of property to the abbey of Barbeau, including the donation of \"apud capellam de Sarnai\" made by \"Guidonis de Nangiis cum assensu uxoris sue Helisabeth\" and with the consent of \"Milo de Corteriaco uxore et filiis\" . It is possible that \"Guidonis de Nangiis\" is the same person as Guy de Marolles, and that his wife \"Helisabeth\" was Isabelle de Nangis. If this is correct, Guy would have been Isabelle´s second husband not her first, assuming that the charter relates to then current donations. m [firstly] ([1136]) ANSEAU de Venisy, son of GARNIER de Venisy & his wife Pétronille ---. [m secondly GUY [de Marolles], son of --- (-after [1166/67]). Seigneur de Nangis, de iure uxoris.]\n\nb) [daughter . Her parentage and marriage are recorded in Europäische Stammtafeln which also states that she was \"Dame de Châtel-les-Nangis\" . The primary source on which this is based has not yet been identified. However, as noted above under her supposed sister Isabelle, under a charter dated to [1166/67] Louis VII King of France confirmed donations of property to the abbey of Barbeau, including the donation of \"apud capellam de Sarnai\" made by \"Guidonis de Nangiis cum assensu uxoris sue Helisabeth\" and with the consent of \"Milo de Corteriaco uxore et filiis\" . The consent given by \"Milo de Corteriaco\" and his wife and children would be consistent with him and his wife also having an interest in the property donated, which would be the case if his wife was the sister of Isabelle de Nangis. Her husband´s connection with the Melun family has not been confirmed. m MILON [de Melun] Seigneur de Courtry, son of ---.]\n\n6.CECILE de France ([1097]-after 1145) . The Historia Regum Francorum Monasterii Sancti Dionysii names \"Philippum et Florum et filiam unam\" as children of \"Philippus rex [et] Fulconi Rechin Andagavorum comiti uxorem\", specifying that the (unnamed) daughter married \"Tanchredus Anthiochenus\" . Her parentage is recorded by William of Tyre, who also records her two marriages . Her first marriage was arranged while Bohémond I Prince of Antioch was visiting the French court seeking support against Alexios I Emperor of Byzantium. She sailed for Antioch end 1106 . While dying, Prince Tancred made Pons de Toulouse promise to marry his wife . Albert of Aix records the marriage at Tripoli of \"Punctus filius Bertrannus de Tripla\" and \"uxorem Tancredi, quæ filia erat regis Franciæ\", dated to [1115] from the context . William of Tyre refers to the wife of the count of Tripoli as uterine sister of Foulques King of Jerusalem and names her . She claimed Jebail as her dower, but was eventually satisfied with Chastel Rouge and Arzghan . She became Lady of Tarsus and Mamistra, in Cilician Armenia, in 1126 . \"Cecilia comitissa\" donated property for the souls of \"domini mei Poncii comitis et filii mei Raimundi comitis\" to the church of the Holy Sepulchre, Jerusalem by charter dated 1139 . m firstly (late 1106) TANCRED Prince of Tiberias, Regent of Antioch, son of ODO [Guillaume] le Bon Marquis & his wife Emma de Hauteville (-12 Dec 1112).

[EUSTACHIE de France ([1095/1100]-[1143]) . She and her husband are named by Kerrebrouck who cites no primary source on which the information is based . Presumably this is based on Sainte-Marthe who states that Eustache comtesse dEstampes et de Corbeil, femme de Jean dEstampes is named sur du Roy Louys le Gros by Jacques du Breuil religieux de sainct Germain des Prez les Paris, adding that the latter records that she founded the abbey of Hierre [Kerrebrouck says Yerres ] where she was buried . Sainte-Marthe also says that cest delle que semble parler Nangis disant que le Roy Philippe I eut de Bertrade de Montfort deux fils et une fille quil nomme Comtesse dEtampes. Nangis has not been identified: the Chronicle of Guillaume de Nangis starts in 1113 during the reign of Louis VI King of France. Eustachie is not named by Père Anselme among the children of King Philippe I . Could there be confusion with Eustachie, daughter of Ferry, whose second husband was Jean dEtampes (see the document PARIS REGION NOBILITY - CORBEIL & ROCHEFORT)?. m JEAN Seigneur d'Etampes et de Corbeil, son of ---.]\n\nKing Philippe had one [probably illegitimate] child [by an unknown mistress]:\n\n8.EUDES de France (-1096). The Chronicle of Alberic de Trois-Fontaines records the death in 1096 of \"Odo frater Ludovici Grossi de alia matre\" . According to Europäische Stammtafeln , Eudes was the son of King Philippe & his first wife but this appears to be contradicted by Alberic. According to Kerrebrouck , Eudes was the son of King Philippe's second marriage but there seems little time for a third child to have been born to Bertrade de Montfort during the first three years of her marriage. It is more likely that Eudes was an illegitimate son of King Philippe.\n\nLOUIS THIBAUT de France, son of PHILIPPE I King of France & his first wife Bertha of Holland (Paris end 1081-Château Bethizy, near Paris 1 Aug 1137, bur église de l'Abbaye royale de Saint-Denis) . Orderic Vitalis names \"Ludovicum-Tedbaldum et Constantiam\" as the children of Philippe I King of France and his wife \"Bertrandam, Florentii Frisiorum ducis filiam\" . The Historia Regum Francorum Monasterii Sancti Dionysii names \"Ludovicum regem et filiam unam Constanciam\" as children of \"Philippus rex [et] uxorem sororem Roberti Flandrensis comitis\" . The difficulty of dating Louis´s birth is discussed fully by Luchaire, who opts for end 1081 as the most likely possibility . Louis´s birth would be dated to [1077/78] if Suger is correct in recording that he was about sixty years old when he died . The early 12th century Vita Sancti Arnulfi Bishop of Soissons by Hariulf records Louis´s birth in 1081 . This date is corroborated by the Chronicon S. Petri Catalaunensis which records that Louis was 26 years old when his father died in 1108 . His father installed him as Comte du Vexin, de Mantes et de Pontoise in 1092. He lived away from court after the repudiation of his mother. Associate-king 1098/1100, elected rex designatus by an assembly of nobles and bishops but not crowned . His father transferred effective governing power to him in 1101, investing him as Comte de Vermandois between 1101 and 1105. He succeeded his father in 1108 as LOUIS VI \"le Gros\" King of France. According to Luchaire, the nickname \"le Gros\", while not contemporary, was first applied to him as early as the 12th century, including in a fragmentary manuscript which records that \"Rex Francorum Ludovicus Grossus\" built several churches in 1112 . He was consecrated 3 Aug 1108, at the Cathedral of Sainte-Croix, Orléans. Suger's Vita Ludovici records his coronation at Orléans by \"Senonensis archiepiscopus Daimbertus\" . In 1119, Louis VI took Cluny and all its dependent priories under his protection, acquiring in return the right to build castles on the abbeys lands with the permission of the abbot of Cluny . He transferred effective power to his son at Châteauneuf-sur-Loire 28 Oct 1135, due to ill health. Suger's Vita Ludovici records the death of King Louis VI \"Kal Aug\" aged about sixty years old and his burial \"ad ecclesiam sanctorum Martyrum\" . The necrology of the abbey of Saint-Germain-des-Prés records the death \"Kal Aug\" of \"Ludovicus rex Francorum\" . The necrology of the abbey of Saint-Denis records the death \"Kal Aug\" of \"Ludovicus Francorum rex\" .\n\nBetrothed (1104, annulled Council of Troyes 23 May 1107 on grounds of consanguinity) to LUCIENNE de Rochefort, daughter of GUY [II] \"le Rouge\" de Rochefort Seigneur de Rochefort-en-Yvelines & his second wife Adelais de Crécy dame de Gournay-sur-Marne ([1090/95]-6 May, 1138 or after). This betrothal is recorded by Orderic Vitalis, who calls her \"Luciana\", names her father and specifies that she later married \"Guiscardo de Bello Loco\" . Suger's Vita Ludovici records the betrothal of \"filius dominus Ludovicus\" and \"filiam Guidonis [comitis de Rupe Forti]\" and their separation on grounds of consanguinity . She married (after 23 May 1107) Guichard [IV] Seigneur de Beaujeu. \"Luciana soror Hugonis de Creciaco\" donated \"terrae sue apud Agglias et Buxiacum\" to Notre-Dame de Longpont, with the consent of Louis VII King of France, by charter dated to [1140], signed by \"Hugone de Creciaco Radulfo comite, Manasse de Turnomio et Beatrix uxor eius\" .\n\nm (Paris [25/30] Mar 1115) as her first husband, ADELAIDE de Maurienne, daughter of HUMBERT III \"le Renforcé\" Comte de Maurienne et de Savoie & his wife Gisèle de Bourgogne [Comté] ([1092]-Montmartre 18 Nov 1154, bur Montmartre, église abbatiale de Saint-Pierre). Her marriage is recorded by Orderic Vitalis, who also names her father and her four oldest sons . The De Genere Comitum Flandrensium, Notæ Parisienses records \"filiam Humberti comitis Morienne\" as wife of \"Ludovicum regem Grossum\" . The Chronicle of Alberic de Trois-Fontaines names \"regina Alaydis soror Amadei comitis Sabaudie\" as wife of \"Ludovici Grossi\" . She exercised considerable influence over her husband, playing an active part in the downfall of Etienne de Garlande, Chancellier de France. After her son Louis succeeded in 1137, she conspired against Suger, Abbé de Saint-Denis, triggering a quarrel with her son. She married secondly ([1138]) as his second wife, Mathieu Seigneur de Montmorency, Connétable of France under King Louis VII, and retired to her lands at Compiègne. Her second marriage is confirmed by an undated charter which records a donation to the priory of Saint-Nicolas d´Acy, near Senlis made in the presence of \"dominæ Adelæ reginæ et domini Mathei mariti eius\" . She retired to the church of the Abbaye de Saint-Pierre at Montmartre, which she had founded, in 1153 . The necrology of the abbey of Saint-Denis records the death \"XIV Kal Dec\" of \"Adelaidis regina\" .\n\nMistress (1): MARIE de Breuillet, daughter of [RENAUD de B"
