He initiated the Orleans Parish School Board Collection at the University of New Orleans in 1982, and when New Orleans suffered tragic losses due to the federal levee failure of 2005, many of the historical records of the city’s public schools survived. The collection has grown to the length of five football fields.\n\nKennedy taught American, Louisiana, and New Orleans history at UNO (1999 – 2017), and in his research he documented the link between public school teachers and the music and musical economy of the city. He identified for scholars the dates of some of the earliest educational debates surrounding issues such as integration, corporal punishment, and prayer in schools.\n\nAs Co-Principal Investigator, he worked with UNO graduate students on a Louisiana Board of Regents grant to review the handwritten minutes of the various New Orleans school boards from the 1840s and 1850s to locate and index educational precedents for issues such as corporal punishment, textbook selection, and school construction. He also helped develop a pilot project for the New Orleans Jazz National Historical Park to preserve the personal photos of area jazz musicians.\n\nKennedy's books include Chord Changes on the Chalkboard: How Public School Teachers Shaped Jazz and the Music of New Orleans (2002); Big Chief Harrison and the Mardi Gras Indians (2010); and Chief of Chiefs: Robert Nathaniel Lee and the Mardi Gras Indians of New Orleans, 1915 – 2001 (2018). He also has authored two booklets about New Orleans Public School music teachers and other publications.\n\nKennedy earned a B.A. from Loyola University (2003), followed by a master’s degree in public administration (1987) and a Ph.D. in urban studies/urban history (1996) from the University of New Orleans.\n\nSeries, Subseries\n\nSERIES 1: Orleans Parish School Board\n\nSubseries 1.1: Public Information Office\n\nSubseries 1.2: History of the New Orleans Public Schools\n\nSubseries 1.3: New Orleans Public Schools Documents\n\nSERIES 2: Music\n\nSubseries 2.1: Music in the Schools\n\nSubseries 2.2: New Orleans Music\n\nSubseries 2.3: New Orleans Musicians\n\nSubseries 2.4: Interviews with Musicians\n\nSERIES 3: Music Teachers\n\nSubseries 3.1: Yvonne Busch\n\nSubseries 3.2: Clyde Kerr, Sr.\n\nSubseries 3.3: New Orleans Center for the Creative Arts (NOCCA)\n\nSubseries 3.4: Mercedes Tucker Stamps\n\nSERIES 4: Publications\n\nSubseries 4.1: Chord Changes on the Chalkboard\n\nSubseries 4.2: Big Chief Harrison\n\nSubseries 4.3: Chief of Chiefs\n\nSubseries 4.4: Other Writings\n\nSERIES 5: History\n\nSubseries 5.1: Southern History\n\nSubseries 5.2: Louisiana & New Orleans History\n\nSERIES 6: Personal\n\nSubseries 6.1: Personal\n\nSubseries 6.2: Photographs\n\nSubseries 6.3: Photographs on CD/DVD\n\nDescriptions:\n\nSeries 1: Orleans Parish School Board\n\nSubseries 1.1 includes materials related to Al Kennedy’s employment in the New Orleans Public Schools’ public information office from 1977 to 1998.
