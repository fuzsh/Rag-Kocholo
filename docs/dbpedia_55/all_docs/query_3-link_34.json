They are rightly praised for their facility at fixing both carbon and nitrogen into organic matter, and microbial driven processes have tangibly altered the chemical composition of the biosphere and its surrounding atmosphere. Despite their prodigious capacity for molecular transformations, microorganisms are powerless in the face of the immutability of the elements. Limitations for specific elements, either fleeting or persisting over eons, have left an indelible trace on microbial genomes, physiology, and their very atomic composition. We here review the impact of elemental limitation on microbes, with a focus on selected genetic model systems and representative microbes from the ocean ecosystem. Evolutionary adaptations that enhance growth in the face of persistent or recurrent elemental limitations are evident from genome and proteome analyses. These range from the extreme (such as dispensing with a requirement for a hard to obtain element) to the extremely subtle (changes in protein amino acid sequences that slightly, but significantly, reduce cellular carbon, nitrogen, or sulfur demand). One near universal adaptation is the development of sophisticated acclimation programs by which cells adjust their chemical composition in response to a changing environment. When specific elements become limiting, acclimation typically begins with an increased commitment to acquisition and a concomitant mobilization of stored resources. If elemental limitation persists, the cell implements austerity measures including elemental-sparing and elemental-recycling. Insights into these fundamental cellular properties have emerged from studies at many different levels; including ecology, biological oceanography, biogeochemistry, molecular genetics, genomics, and microbial physiology. Here, we present a synthesis of these diverse studies and attempt to discern some overarching themes.\n\nKeywords: metal homeostasis, sparing, phosphorus, sulfur, iron, zinc, copper, cyanobacteria, diatom, Chlamydomonas, Bacillus\n\nI. Overview: Mendeleev meets Darwin\n\nOne of the great achievements of 20th century science was the melding of two largely distinct disciplines, chemistry and biology, leading to a renaissance in the molecular life sciences. Chemistry underlies the myriad processes that power and enable cell growth, and an understanding of chemical principles is imperative for the modern biologist. One of the most fundamental principles of chemistry is that elements are immutable, at least under the conditions conducive to life processes. Transformation of one element into another occurs either rarely and stochastically, in the case of radioactive decay and nuclear fission, or under extremes of temperature and pressure, in the case of fusion-based nucleosynthesis.\n\nIt is ironic that the very foundations of Chemistry are rooted in the notion of elemental transmutation and the countless years of effort devoted to alchemical pursuits including, most famously, efforts to turn base metals into gold. Isaac Newton was one of the more ardent practitioneers; it is estimated that he devoted far more attention to alchemy than to mathematics and physics combined (Dobbs, 1983). Ultimately, of course, the atomic theory as espoused by John Dalton (1766–1844), with the notion of atoms as indestructible and indivisible, was hailed for its explanatory power and provided a foundation for modern chemistry.\n\nThe atomic theory set the stage for an increased understanding of the properties of the elements, which displayed a periodic pattern when arranged, in early versions, relative to their masses. While many scientists contributed to the development of the periodic table, Dmitri Mendeleev (1834–1907) is generally credited with this synthesis (ca. 1869). In biology, a contemporary of Mendeleev, Charles Darwin (1809–1882) published his landmark \"Origin of Species\" in 1859 with its description of evolution by natural selection. Here, we consider the conceptual intersection of these two great ideas < >. Our theme will be the wide range of remarkable adaptations found in the microbial world that have resulted from limitations for elemental nutrients.\n\nA. The Elemental Composition of Life\n\nLiving cells rely on only a small, and somewhat variable, subset of the periodic table < >. The elements of life can be divided into the macronutrients (C,H,N,O,P,S), major cations (K,Mg,Ca), and the so-called micronutrients (including many metal ions) (Frieden, 1985, Frausto da Silva and Williams, 2001). Many familiar elements are dispensable to living cells and in many cases can be deleterious if present.\n\nIt is unexpectedly difficult to define the minimum set of elements absolutely essential for life, although there is little doubt that all cells require the so-called macronutrients of CHNOPS (note that all elements will be referred to by their atomic symbols with ionization state indicated only where relevant). The requirements for metal ions and other elements is more idiosyncratic. It is likely that all cells require Zn and Mg and nearly all also require Fe. The requirements for Mn, Cu, Co, Ni, Ca, K, Na, Mo, Se, and other elements are likely to be variable and are often unestablished. Some elements have very specialized but beneficial or even essential functions in a very select subset of organisms. Examples include the use of Si in plant and diatom cell walls, B in plants, and Cd in certain marine organisms < >. The atomic inventory has been measured for numerous organisms and is relatively constant for the most abundant macronutrients, but remarkably flexible for the much less abundant micronutrients. As an example, the elemental composition of a representative marine cyanobacterium, Synechococcus sp. CCMP835, is shown in < > (Quigg et al., 2011).\n\nTable 1\n\nElement\n\n(symbol)Major functions and uses in microbial cellsRequired for All CellsCbasis of all organic moleculesHH2O, organic moleculesNorganic molecules, esp. proteins and nucleic acidsOH2O, organic moleculesPnucleic acids, NTPs, metabolites, phospholipidsSproteins, glutathione and LMW thiols, biotin, lipoic acid, thiaminMgmajor cation; cofactor for phosphotransferase reactionsZnenzyme cofactor, protein foldingRequired for Most CellsKmajor cation, common in cellsCamajor cation, required by many eukaryotesMnenzyme cofactor, ribonucleotide reductase, SOD, PS IIFeheme, iron-sulfur cluster, non-heme enzymesCoenzyme cofactor, B12-dependent enzymesCuenzyme cofactor, electron carrier, respiration, SODMoFeMoCo cofactor (nitrogenase), Mo cofactor enzymesRequired for Specialized Functions in Some CellsSeselenocysteine in proteinsBplant cell wall, quorum sensing (some AI-2)Naused for ion potential in halophilesSisome plant cell walls, diatom walls (frustules)Cl,Br,Fl,Isome bacterial secondary metabolitesVnitrogenase, haloperoxidasesNiurease, SOD (SodN), glyoxalaseCdcofactor for carbonic anhydrase (CA) in some marine microbesWtungstoenzymes (aldehyde oxidoreductase, formate dehydrogenase, acetyl hydratase)\n\nThe requirements for macronutrient elements are well established and easily understood. Life is fundamentally based on aqueous chemistry and this requirement alone provides an absolute requirement for H and O, although of course not all organisms require molecular oxygen (O2). The chemistry of proteins, nucleic acids, carbohydrates, and lipids accounts for the major requirements for C, N, P and S. In no case can cells be assembled in the absence of these crucial elements although, as we will see, there are sophisticated mechanisms for minimizing (to the extent possible) the requirements for these macronutrients when they might otherwise be limiting.\n\nRequirements for the remaining elements are less firmly established and few, if any, are likely to be universal requirements ( ). Zn is widely used as a cofactor for protein folding and as a Lewis acid cofactor for several families of enzymes (Andreini et al., 2009). Mg(II) is the major biological cation in many microbial systems. We suggest that both of these are likely essential for all life, at least until a counterexample is identified. Fe is essential for growth of nearly all microbes and is present in heme-cofactored proteins, iron-sulfur cluster (Fe/S) proteins, and di-iron and mononuclear enzymes, amongst others. However, there are organisms, including the lactobacilli and Borrelia burdorferi, that have dispensed with an Fe requirement (Posey and Gherardini, 2000). Other cations (e.g. Ca, Cu, Co, Mn, K) are often needed or at are least stimulatory for growth, but a requirement is not necessarily universal. Note that in most cells the major anions are likely organic compounds (acetate, glutamate), so a requirement for Cl− or other inorganic anions is not universal.\n\nMicroorganisms are the consummate experimentalists; over the course of several billion years of evolution single-celled life forms learned to exploit a wide variety of niches that often differed in the availability of the \"elements of life.\" As organisms adapted to new environments where previously accessible elements were now limited in abundance or absent, they had to evolve alternative solutions for life's chemistry. It is the results of these evolutionary experiments, as embodied in the physiology and genetics of contemporary microbes, that form the basis for this review.\n\nB. Reference Systems for Understanding Microbial Responses to Elemental Limitation\n\nWe will here explore the molecular mechanisms by which microbial cells adapt and acclimate to elemental limitation. Note that throughout this review, the term elemental refers to the atomic elements. We will use adaptation to refer specifically to changes in the DNA that occur in response in selection pressures, potentially acting over very long time scales, and acclimation to refer to those changes in cellular physiology that allow individual cells to better utilize available nutrients. Adaptations may include, for example, changes in protein sequence or the evolution of isozymes with alternative cofactor dependencies. The conditional expression of alternative enzymes or pathways, in response to changes in elemental availability, is a major feature of the acclimation response for many elemental limitations.\n\nAccess to the elements of life plays a large role in defining the microbial composition of the diverse habitats within the biosphere. For some environments, such as the surface waters of the open ocean, elemental composition (and hence limitations) may be relatively constant, and are therefore a driving force for adaptation. Perhaps two-thirds of the ocean's surface waters have biologically limiting levels of P, and for much of the rest, it is the availability of Fe that limits primary productivity. The most successful organisms in these environments have evolved adaptations that allow them to maximize growth by reducing demand for limiting nutrients. These organisms are specialists, and their genomes and their metabolism reflect an evolutionary optimization for their environment. For other cosmopolitan organisms the environment is ever-changing and a more generalist approach is advantageous. Where elemental availability is variable, cells have evolved genetic mechanisms to acclimate their physiology to the changing local environment. In many cases, these types of acclimation involve changes in gene expression.\n\n1. Genetic model systems for investigating mechanisms of elemental economy\n\nNot surprisingly, many of the best understood mechanisms of adaptation and acclimation have been revealed in well-studied reference or “model” organisms < >. Here, we will focus on the Gram-negative bacterium Escherichia coli and the Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus subtilis. Eukaryotic microbes will be represented by the eukaryote Saccharomyces cerevisiae and the photosynthetic eukaryote, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, a soil-resident alga. Each of these four organisms displays sophisticated mechanisms for acclimation to changing nutrient availability ( ). Work in the Archaea is still not well developed in this area, although this diverse group of organisms clearly has sophisticated systems for the optimization of nutrient utilization and, in particular, for metal homeostasis (Bini, 2010). Emerging Archaeal model systems include the halophiles Halobacterium salinarum and Haloferax volcanii and the methanogens Methanococcus maripaludis and Methanosarcina acetivorans (reviewed in Leigh et al., 2011). Of note, systems level studies of Fe homeostasis have been initiated in H. salinarum (Schmid et al., 2011) and methanogenesis is an intensively metal-utilizing process.\n\nTable 3\n\nDomain:PhylumOrganism (abbreviation)EnvironmentNutritionNotable mechanisms for elemental economyA.

Phytoplankton and the marine ecosystem: the global impacts of elemental limitation\n\nLife is thought to have evolved in shallow seas and perhaps other surface waters and the atomic composition of cells reflects this archaic environment (Dupont et al., 2010). As life diversified and colonized a wider variety of environments, the ability to adapt to changing elemental availability likely assumed greater importance (Armbrust, 2009, Sohm et al., 2011). The abundance of life enabled by the evolution of mechanisms to access the most abundant forms of C (photosynthetic fixation of atmospheric CO2) and N (fixation of atmospheric N2) inevitably led to growth restriction by other nutrients (Morel and Price, 2003, Konhauser et al., 2009). The result has been the evolution of mechanisms to either bypass these restrictions or, minimally, to increase the efficiency of utilization of limiting nutrients. Moreover, elemental availability has changed dramatically on geological timescales (Quigg et al., 2003, Konhauser et al., 2009). One major driving force was the great oxidation event (~2.4 billion years ago) and the subsequent depletion of soluble ferrous Fe from ocean surface waters and other aerobic environments. It is estimated that ~30% of the open ocean is Fe-limited and this left a major imprint on the genetics and physiology of the constituent plankton (Armbrust, 2009, Behrenfeld et al., 2009, Sohm et al., 2011).\n\nWe will discuss the marine microbial community in some detail, including cyanobacteria and other phytoplankton, since these organisms provide particularly informative examples of adaptations to limiting P, Fe, and Zn ( ). Because of the severity of nutrient limitations in this environment, and the long timescales over which these limitations have persisted, the resident organisms have evolved unique adaptations to bypass elemental restrictions. These adaptations are, in many cases, complemented by acclimation responses.\n\nThe dominant microorganisms in the open ocean vary depending on location, light fluxes, and availability of both macro- and micronutrients. In many areas of the open ocean, the numerically dominant microorganisms include members of the cyanobacteria (in particular, Synechococcus spp. and Prochlorococcus spp.) (Zehr et al., 2007) and diatoms (Bowler et al., 2010, Partensky and Garczarek, 2010). Diatoms are eukaryotic phytoplankton notable for their silica-containing cell walls (frustules) and are responsible for perhaps 20% of total primary productivity globally (reviewed in Armbrust, 2009). Representative organisms which have helped illuminate mechanisms of elemental economy, and where genomics-enabled approaches are now coming to the fore, are summarized in .\n\nC. General Strategies for Dealing with Elemental Limitation\n\nInsights into how microbes adapt to elemental limitations emerged in laboratory studies of microbial metabolism on the one hand (e.g. Hutber et al., 1977, Wood, 1978, Schönheit et al., 1979, Bishop et al., 1980, Ragsdale and Ljungdahl, 1984) and the study of the microbial ecology, and in particular the ocean ecosystem, on the other (Morel and Price, 2003). Increasingly, genomic and molecular genetic investigations of model organisms ( ) are revealing mechanisms of adaptation and programs for acclimation to elemental limitation. These same mechanisms likely occur in globally important but less tractable organisms such as the marine phytoplankton. Studies of representative marine microbes, many of which are now amenable to genomics-based investigations ( ), reminds us of the impact of elemental limitations on global ecology and primary productivity. Comparing these two bodies of largely distinct literature reveals that similar strategies for elemental economy have evolved independently in many systems.\n\nWith their ability to double their population in as little as 20 minutes or less (under optimal growth conditions), responses to resource limitation are deeply ingrained in the genetics and physiology of microorganisms. The impact of nutrient limitation is apparent both in cellular adaptations and in the processes of acclimation. At the level of adaptation, macronutrient limitation has led microbes to alter the elemental composition of selected constituents through a process of elemental optimization. As one example, signatures of macronutrient limitation are recorded in the protein sequences of the elemental acquisition machinery of phylogenetically diverse organisms (Baudouin-Cornu et al., 2001). At the level of acclimation, nutrient limitation leads to several predictable responses that may be activated either simultaneously or sequentially, depending on the system. These responses can be classified as elemental acquisition, mobilization, sparing, and recycling.\n\n1. Elemental optimization\n\nOrganisms adapt to elemental limitation by altering the atomic composition of their constituents; a trend noted in protein primary sequences. For example, proteins necessary for the acquisition of S are selectively depleted of Cys and Met in their amino acid sequences (Baudouin-Cornu et al., 2001). Clearly, this enhances the ability of the cell to express these proteins under S limiting conditions where translation of proteins requiring high levels of Cys and Met might be impaired. Parenthetically, we note that an analogous selection pressure also operates at higher levels of organization: the amino acids themselves. In the \"cognate bias hypothesis\" it has been noted that amino acid biosynthetic enzymes are under selection pressure to minimize use of the cognate amino acid in their coding sequences (Alves and Savageau, 2005). Other notable examples of elemental optimization include the elimination of an Fe requirement in organisms that grow in severely Fe-limited environments (Posey and Gherardini, 2000), and the substantial reduction in phospholipid content in cells that have adapted to persistent P limitation (Van Mooy et al., 2009). As defined here, elemental optimization is a fixed adaptation and is therefore most characteristic of specialist organisms that inhabit environments of relatively constant elemental composition. However, analogous changes in elemental composition also contribute to the conditionally expressed programs by which organisms acclimate to nutrient limitation.\n\n2. Acclimation: acquisition and mobilization\n\nGenerally, the first major cellular response during acclimation to nutrient limitation is an increased expression of acquisition pathways. Acquisition pathways are dominated by transporters for the limiting element or compounds that are rich in the limiting element. Associated functions include enzymes to help mobilize nutrients, such as proteases, nucleases, and various hydrolases. Acquisition pathways also include, for many organisms, induction of pathways to access resources that are chemically recalcitrant or more energetically prohibitive and therefore only used as a last resort. One well characterized example is the repression of nitrogen fixation by ammonium (Dixon and Kahn, 2004). A second example is the derepression of enzymes to cleave direct C-P bonds (phosphonates) when P (as phosphate) is limiting (Jiang et al., 1995, Baek and Lee, 2007), an adaptation that appears widespread in marine bacteria (Martinez et al., 2010). Phosphonates may comprise up to 25% of the high molecular weight organic P pool in the ocean and uptake and utilization of phosphonates is widespread in the important marine cyanobacterium Prochlorococcus as well as in Synechococcus spp. in microbial mats in hot springs (Adams et al., 2008, Feingersch et al., 2011).\n\nConcomitant with the expression of acquisition pathways, organisms will mobilize stored resources. Examples of this pathway include release of Fe from ferritin, degradation of polyphosphates to release inorganic P, and mobilization of excess C stored, for example, in lipid bodies. In each of these examples, mobilization is from a source whose primary, if not exclusive, function is elemental (or energy) storage. Once dedicated stores are depleted, cells may resort to more drastic measures that involve the selective consumption of their own organelles (autophagy) which we classify as elemental recycling (see below).\n\nAcquisition and mobilization from stores are both typically activated when nutrients first start to become limiting for growth, a state that can be defined as elemental deficiency. If the acquisition and mobilization strategies are ineffective, and the deficiency is not relieved, the lack of the specific required element will ultimately lead to a cessation of growth or of key metabolic activities, a state that can be defined as elemental limitation (La Fontaine et al., 2002). While interesting in their own right, processes of nutrient acquisition and mobilization have been well reviewed elsewhere and we focus our attention on the elemental sparing and recycling responses.\n\n3. Acclimation by elemental sparing\n\nWhen nutrients are not accessible in the environment, and intracellular stores are depleted, austerity measures are implemented following the precepts of reduce, reuse, and recycle. Elemental sparing refers to responses that serve to reduce cellular demand for limiting nutrients by selectively repressing synthesis of non-essential proteins and macromolecules. This is, in essence, a prioritization mechanism by which the cell distinguishes between high priority and often essential functions and those that are of lower priority for survival. Elemental sparing responses are common for both macronutrient (P,S) and micronutrient limitations.\n\nTo be effective, and therefore a target of evolutionary selection, elemental sparing frequently targets the most abundant macromolecules in the cell. As a result, limitations for some of the key macronutrients (C,N,S) typically lead to changes in protein composition (the proteome) and targets highly abundant proteins. Limitation for P often leads to changes in the membrane and cell envelope, which can contain abundant phospholipids and other P-containing macromolecules. P-limited cells may also recycle P from nucleic acids (either DNA in the case of polyploid plastids or RNA in ribosomes). Limitation for specific metal ions often leads to a shift to enzymes that use alternative metal cofactors. Alternatively, some cells may simply dispense with a requirement for what would otherwise be an essential and hard to access nutrient.\n\nWhile it is often possible for microorganisms to reduce their dependency on particular elements by the elimination of specific proteins or other macromolecules, in many cases these changes must be compensated for by the expression of alternative pathways. As a result, a common feature of many elemental sparing responses is functional substitution. For example, in response to metal ion limitation, substitute pathways may take advantage of an alternative, non-metal-based chemistry, or may rely instead on a more abundant metal in place of a scarce one. In response to P limitation, simply repressing the synthesis of phospholipid membrane synthesis would impede cell growth. Expression of alternative biosynthetic pathways for lipids lacking P enables continued cell growth, while sparing P for its more indispensable functions.\n\nNot all elemental substitution processes in cells contribute to elemental sparing. In many organisms, S is substituted with Se, usually at a single active site residue. Since most organisms contain between one and three selenoproteins (Zhang and Gladyshev, 2011), this is not sufficient to affect the overall S budget. In the case of P, there has been a report of its replacement by As with an apparent reduction in cellular P demand (Wolfe-Simon et al., 2011), but this has been widely challenged (see below). Indeed, there is not a single documented example of As replacing P in a biological molecule that retains its normal function in the cell.\n\n4. Acclimation by elemental recycling\n\nIn those systems where it is difficult to dispense with an elemental requirement, and the gains to be obtained by elemental sparing are limited, cells may additionally implement an elemental recycling program. Such strategies may include the degradation of key cellular components (proteins, the ribosome, photosynthetic complexes, and even chromosomal DNA in polyploid plastids) for the sole apparent purpose of recovering the nutrients stored therein to supply new biosynthetic processes < and >. One notable example is the degradation of ribosomes (ribophagy) upon starvation, which frees up significant stores of C, N, P, and possibly Mg (Martin et al., 1976, Kraft et al., 2008). Similarly, in C. reinhardtii and in a marine cyanobacterium, abundant metalloenzymes may be proteolytically degraded simply to release and recycle the valuable copper and iron cofactors (Merchant and Bogorad, 1986a, Saito et al., 2011).\n\nIn the following sections, we will highlight numerous examples, in both model organisms and representative environmentally significant microbes, of these major strategies for dealing with elemental limitation. We will begin with some of the best understood processes that enable efficient macronutrient utilization and conclude with studies of metal homeostasis and the evolution of pathways to bypass metal limitations on growth.\n\nII. Microbial Adaptations to Macronutrient Limitation\n\nBy weight, cells are mostly water and this accounts for, and provides a source of, both H and O. For all of the remaining macronutrients (C,N,P,S) there are well-documented processes of both adaptation and acclimation in response to limitation. The effects of macronutrient limitation on cell growth have long been appreciated in ecology and were perhaps first formalized in terms of crop production by Professor Carl Sprengel of Göttingen (1839) in what became known as the \"law of the minimum\" as popularized by Justus von Leibig. The impact of elemental limitations was highlighted by the influential work of the oceanographer Alfred Redfield who noted that the averaged ratio of macronutrients in biomass (largely phytoplankton) from the oceans (C:N:P=106:16:1) was very similar to the elemental composition of the ocean surface waters. This so-called Redfield ratio is a founding concept in the development of \"ecological stoichiometry\": a discipline which traces the impact of elemental composition and limitations on ecosystem dynamics (Jeyasingh and Weider, 2007).\n\nDespite a long and influential history, ecological stoichiometry has remained a largely descriptive approach. However, insights into the underlying mechanisms by which microorganisms adapt and acclimate to elemental limitation are emerging due to both molecular biological studies and, increasingly, bioinformatic analyses. Genome sequence information, especially when coupled with expression (transcriptome and proteome) data, allows insights into the protein composition of cells from different environments and under different growth regimens. Remarkably, the evolutionary impact of both macro- and micronutrient limitation is often discernable by a careful analysis of genomes: an emerging science for which the name \"stoichiogenomics\" has been proposed (Elser et al., 2011).\n\nA. Carbon, Nitrogen, and Sulfur Limitation: adaptation and acclimation mechanisms\n\nThe bulk of cellular C, N, and S demand is in support of protein synthesis. While C and N are constituents of all amino acids, these elements are not equally distributed due to variations in the length and composition of the side-chains. Two amino acids, Cys and Met, contain S and together these account for the bulk of cellular S requirements. The ability of changes in protein sequence to spare limiting macronutrients was first hinted at from protein sequence analyses of individual proteins, but has more recently been inferred on a genome-wide basis.\n\n1. Adaptation and acclimation to S limitation\n\na. Elemental optimization: selective reduction of Cys and Met content in proteins\n\nFor any given protein, a small subset of amino acids is typically essential for catalytic function, and many others may contribute to optimal expression, protein folding, or stability. However, at many positions, identified as variable in alignments of homologous proteins, substitutions may occur more or less freely (e.g. Wen et al., 1996). The identity of the amino acids at these variable positions can change and become established in response to a variety of selection pressures, including elemental availability.\n\nOne of the first noted examples of such an effect emerged from the protein composition analysis of the abundant sulfate binding protein induced in E. coli upon S starvation (Pardee, 1966). Amino acid analysis suggested that this polypeptide, which can constitute 1% of cellular protein when cells are grown under S limitation, was lacking Cys and Met. The lack of these amino acids (in the mature protein) ensures that its synthesis in response to S limitation is not impaired by restrictions on Cys and Met availability. Numerous other examples are now apparent where proteins expressed under S limitation either lack or have a reduced content of Cys and Met < >. Indeed, at a proteomic level, proteins that are involved in S assimilation may be selectively depleted in Cys and Met relative to other proteins. For example, analysis of proteins annotated as having likely roles in S assimilation in both E. coli (23 proteins) and S. cerevisiae (20 proteins) revealed a substantial decrease (up to 2-fold) in the fraction of amino acids that contain S relative to the rest of the proteome (Baudouin-Cornu et al., 2001). No such difference was seen in the orthologous enzymes (where present) from human, which was interpreted as evidence that S limitation has not been a selective pressure in mammals. The selective reduction of S content in S assimilation proteins is just one of many ways in which macronutrient limitations and energy constraints can influence protein sequences. A survey of ~150 different species (mostly Bacteria) suggests that there are also substantial differences (approaching 2-fold) in the computed fractional S content of proteomes amongst species. One notable trend is a slightly higher S content, on average, amongst anaerobes, although the significance of this observation is not yet clear (Bragg et al., 2006).\n\nb. Remodeling of the proteome as a S sparing mechanism\n\nExpression of S depleted protein variants or isozymes is also an important mechanism of acclimation to S limiting growth conditions. For example, in cyanobacteria, the light-harvesting phycobilisome proteins can account for ~50–60% of soluble protein. In the cyanobacterium Calothrix sp. PCC7601, the phycocyanins, a key phycobilisome constituent, are encoded by three differentially expressed operons (Mazel and Marlière, 1989). The cpc3 operon is specifically induced under conditions of S limitation. The encoded phycocyanins have been selectively depleted of S-containing amino acids relative to the phycocyanins encoded by the cpc1 and cpc2 operons. In over 1000 amino acids of five proteins encoded by cpc3, there are only five Met initiation codons and three indispensable Cys used as attachment sites via thioether linkage for phycobilin (Mazel and Marlière, 1989). A similar response has been documented in a freshwater cyanobacterium, Fremyella diplosiphon (Gutu et al., 2011). This organism also remodels its abundant phycobilisome complex in response to S depletion to replace proteins relatively rich in Cys and Met with a paralog that is depleted of these S-containing amino acids. The replaced phycobilisome proteins are likely degraded which thereby provides the cell with a source of S (and potentially N) under conditions of nutrient deprivation (elemental recycling).\n\nA comparable acclimation response has been noted in the yeast S. cerevisiae. In this organism, intracellular S demand was modified by exposure to Cd, which induces synthesis of the Cys-containing tripeptide glutathione and hence creates a draw on the S metabolite pool. Cd is toxic to cells because of its affinity for intracellular thiols (e.g. at the active site of enzymes) and is detoxified by tight binding to glutathione. The strength of the binding (essentially irreversible), combined with the transport of the glutathione-Cd complexes into vacuoles, results in sequestration of Cd and depletion of intracellular S. Analysis of changes in the proteome of Cd-treated cells revealed the induction of isoforms of three central metabolic enzymes that are selectively depleted in S-containing amino acids (Fauchon et al., 2002). These include an alternative pyruvate decarboxylase, an enolase, and an aldehyde dehydrogenase. These induced isozymes contain only 22 S atoms as compared to 42 for their counterparts. The usual isoforms are among the most abundant proteins in yeast, constituting >6% of the soluble proteome. For pyruvate decarboxylase, down-regulation of the usual isoform was also documented. In addition, several other mRNAs that were induced in Cd-exposed cells were noted to be significantly depleted in Cys- and Met-encoding capacity. These responses are dependent on Met4p, a transcriptional regulator of S assimilation. Interestingly, of the 66 transcripts induced by Cd and dependent on Met4p, just 13 (encoding the most abundant proteins) were significantly depleted of sulfur amino acids. Analysis of the fate of sulfate nutrient in Cd-treated cells indicated a 70% distribution of S in favour of GSH biosynthesis as compared to a 79% distribution towards protein in untreated cells. These S-sparing changes are estimated to lead to an ~30% reduction in cellular S allocation towards protein, which increases S availability for Cd-detoxification pathways (Fauchon et al., 2002).\n\nIn the alga C. reinhardtii, S-starvation induces massive changes in the proteome and transcriptome (González-Ballester et al., 2010). As expected, many of the changes relate to S acquisition, such as mobilization of S from esterified organic sulfates, utilization of less preferred S sources, and sulfate transport (reviewed in Irihimovitch and Yehudai-Resheff, 2008). There is also evidence for S recycling (González-Ballester et al., 2010). For instance, enzymes involved in S mobilization (including CDO1, TAUD1 and TAUD2 encoding cysteine and taurine/α-ketoglutarate dioxygenases, respectively) are strongly up-regulated. These responses are dependent on a plant-specific SNF-related kinase, which is central to the S starvation signaling pathway, indicating the direct relevance of these responses to S metabolism.\n\nDown-regulation of transcripts encoding biosynthesis of S-containing vitamins, thiamin and biotin, and the cofactor S-adenosyl methionine, is likely to be part of an S sparing response in which the limited pool of intracellular S metabolites is directed towards critical processes. Several extracellular proteins (Ecp56, Ecp61, Ecp76 and Ecp88) and a particular isoform of chlorophyll binding light harvesting protein are induced by S deficiency (Takahashi et al., 2001, Nguyen et al., 2008, González-Ballester et al., 2010). In fact, the mRNA for the light-harvesting chlorophyll-binding protein Lhcb9 increases as much as 103-fold to become the 2nd most abundant transcript in the cell. In each case, the induced proteins are depleted for Cys and Met. The induced Ecps have at most one S-containing amino acid out of 500–600 (0 to 0.2%) compared to 4.1 to 7.5% for other cell wall proteins. In the case of Lhcb9, out of five S-containing amino acids that are invariant in the other 8 major Lhcb proteins, this isoform retains only two: Met157, Met213 and Cys101 are replaced by Leu, Ser and Ile, respectively. Interestingly, the depletion is noted only in the mature part of the protein which is the form that accumulates and is hence subject to selective pressure, but not in the signal sequence for export or the transit peptide for thylakoid membrane targeting, both of which are cleaved, with the constituent amino acids recycled. The authors estimate that this form of S sparing reduces from 4.2% to 2.3% the S amino acid content of the C. reinhardtii proteome (González-Ballester et al., 2010), reminiscent of the yeast study discussed above.\n\nS sparing has been documented in multicellular organisms as well (Petrucco et al., 1996, Kim et al., 1999). In the soybean seed, the S content of storage proteins in seed is determined by the level of S nutrition: S-amino acid-rich glycinin is the major protein if S is available, but S-amino acid depleted β-conglycinin accumulates in the S-poor situation. The abundance of a key metabolite, O-acetyl-Ser, signals the change in gene expression (Kim et al., 1999).\n\n2. Elemental optimization: signatures of C and N limitation in proteomes\n\nJust as selection in the face of S limitation has led to a reduction or even eradication of S-containing amino acids from proteins, both C and N limitation can affect protein composition ( and ). It has been noted, for example, that a single amino acid change in a protein can add up to three N atoms (Gly to Arg) or nine C atoms (Gly to Trp). When considered in the context of protein abundance, mathemetical modeling suggests that a single Arg to Gly change, for example, would have a sufficient effect on N balance to be targeted for selection in the most abundant ~8% of yeast proteins and a single Trp to Gly change would provide sufficient C savings to be visible to selection in ~4% of proteins. The effects of depleting proteins for S (by elimination of one or more Cys or Met residues) is even more dramatic and is potentially subject to selection in more than half of all yeast proteins, although this value depends on the precise parameters used (Bragg and Wagner, 2009). Such changes are particularly apparent when one considers only the subset of proteins expressed in response to a particular elemental limitation, as noted for S assimilation proteins above (Baudouin-Cornu et al., 2001). In both S. cerevisiae and E. coli, those enzymes specifically involved in processes of C assimilation have, on average, slightly shorter (less C-rich) side chains than the bulk proteome (or S assimilation enzymes). Conversely, enzymes for N assimilation are built, on average, using amino acids with fewer N atoms (Baudouin-Cornu et al., 2001). These effects are relatively small (5–10% reduction), but the fact that this signature of selection is visible at the proteomic level is rather remarkable. Elemental composition is not the only factor that affects amino acid selection at otherwise neutral positions in protein sequences. It has been shown, for example, that amino acid selection is also driven by the energetic demands of amino acid biosynthesis (Akashi and Gojobori, 2002) or even periodic fluctuations in the predominant metabolic pathways at different metabolic phases of the yeast cell cycle (de Bivort et al., 2009).\n\n3. Recycling: macromolecular turnover as a way of redistributing C, N, and S\n\nElemental sparing responses can significantly reduce cellular demand for S, but are relatively ineffective in the face of the ubiquitous use of C and N in cell constituents. While elemental optimization of protein sequences provides some additional efficiency for utilization for all three of these macronutrients (C,N,S), the gains are incremental. Ultimately, when no external sources can be scavenged, and cell growth becomes severely limited for macronutrients, processes of recycling assume great importance.\n\nRecycling of nutrients within and between cells typically involves the degradation of abundant cellular components to release their molecular (e.g. amino acid and nucleotide) and elemental constituents. In multicellular populations, entire cells may serve as nutrients in this way. Even if we restrict ourselves to the microbial world, this type of process is likely widespread as noted, for example, in the cannibalism response of B. subtilis. When growing populations of B. subtilis become nutrient limited, they synthesize toxins that kill and lyse non-starved cells of the population, which thereby delays entry into sporulation (Gonzalez-Pastor, 2011). Similar processes of fratricide occur in other, genetically homogeneous populations of cells (Claverys and Havarstein, 2007) and it has been suggested that toxin:antitoxin modules may contribute to programmed cell death in a sort of altruistic suicide triggered, at least under some conditions, by nutritional stress (Engelberg-Kulka et al., 2006).\n\nIndividual cells recycle nutrients by the selective degradation of surplus or replaceable constituents. This general process is termed autophagy (eating of self), but can be further classified as ribophagy, mitophagy, and so forth, depending on the structure or organelle that is targeted for destruction. The physiological role of autophagy is not always clear, although recycling of nutrients is one obvious benefit. Autophagy is also related to quality control and serves to selectively degrade non-functioning or damaged organelles. Studies in animal models indicate that autophagy helps prevent numerous degenerative diseases and may be a key mediator of the beneficial effects of exercise (He et al., 2012).\n\na. Recycling of ribosomes (ribophagy)\n\nRibosomes represent a major fraction of cell mass in rapidly growing bacteria and the cell’s requirement for ribosomes scales linearly with growth rate. During rapid growth, ribosomes may comprise close to 1/3 of the dry mass of a rapidly growing bacterium, but far smaller numbers are needed for the slow growth during elemental deprivation or for maintanence of the cell during non-growing (stationary) phases that are imposed by elemental limitations. Early studies in E. coli revealed that ribosomes are degraded in cells presented with C or N limitation (Kaplan and Apirion, 1975, Zundel et al., 2009). Degradation appears to occur during the transition to stationary phase, and is correlated with the formation of free ribosomal subunits (Zundel et al., 2009, Piir et al., 2011).\n\nRecent studies have begun to reveal the pathways of rRNA degradation and their regulation (Deutscher, 2009). Degradation of ribosomal subunits in response to nutrient starvation is initiated by a pathway distinct from the ones operating for quality control during growth (Basturea et al., 2011). Turnover of ribosome subunits begins, in the case of the 30S subunit, with the trimming of the 16S rRNA 3'-end by RNase PH. Since this region contains the anti-Shine-Dalgarno sequence, this functionally inactivates the subunit. Another early step in ribosome degradation is endonucleolytic cleavage which, in both subunits, targets the RNA-rich subunit interface. Although the identity of the relevant endonuclease is not yet clear, this may be part of the mechanism by which un-associated subunits are selectively targeted for destruction. Once cleaved, the rRNA molecules are degraded by processive exonucleases including RNase II, RNase R and polynucleotide phosphorylase. These RNases may work in concert with proteins related to the Ro autoantigen (Wurtmann and Wolin, 2010) and may themselves be regulated. For example, RNase R is regulated by protein acetylation which leads to instability during exponential growth and stabilization during stationary phase (Liang et al., 2011).\n\nIt is not clear whether degradation of ribosomes serves primarily to liberate nutrients associated with the abundant rRNA (which is ~50% of the ribosome mass), the ribosomal proteins, or both. In most cases, it is rRNA that is monitored as this is technically easier. However, it has also been noted that macronutrient limitation leads to a starvation-specific proteolysis of ~20–40% of total cell protein in E. coli (Nath and Koch, 1971), which would be consistent with degradation of released ribosomal proteins (r-proteins).\n\nRibophagy is also increasingly appreciated for its role in nutrient cycling in eukaryotic cells. In C. reinhardtii, nitrogen starvation triggers a conversion of vegetatively growing cells into gametes and this differentiation process involves extensive remodeling of the ribosome pool (Martin et al., 1976). Indeed, it has been suggested that mobilization of precursors (nucleotides) from rRNA degradation is needed for DNA replication under these conditions. However, this remodeling of the ribosome pool may also have other roles in the cell such as modulation of translational accuracy (Bulté and Bennoun, 1990).\n\nIn S. cerevisiae, the induction of ribophagy upon nutrient limitation involves de-ubiquitination of ribosomal proteins by the Ubp3p/Bre5p ubiquitin protease that then triggers engulfment of the large ribosomal subunit into a vacuole for degradation (Kraft et al., 2008, Lafontaine, 2010). This process, for which the term ribophagy was first coined, involves the targeted delivery of both ribosome subunits to the vacuole, the presumed degradation of their protein and nucleic acid components, and the recycling of macronutrients. Genetic studies indicate that the process of ribophagy contributes to survival during prolonged periods of starvation (Kraft et al., 2008).\n\nb. Recycling of other abundant protein components\n\nIn addition to ribosomes, other abundant proteins may be targeted for proteolytic destruction upon nutrient limitation. Indeed, in mammalian cells, protein degradation mediated by the proteasome provides an important source of amino acids for ongoing protein synthesis when amino acid availability becomes limiting (Vabulas and Hartl, 2005). Photosynthetic organisms may also take advantage of protein degradation to release macronutrients when they find themselves N limited. In Synechococcus strain DC2 the light-harvesting phycobiliproteins may constitute 50% of total protein. Phycobilisome complexes in Synechococcus can be targeted for degradation in response to either N or S limitation (Collier and Grossman, 1992) and that degradation appears to be a highly regulated and ordered process (Grossman et al., 1993). It is likely that similar targeted recycling processes will be present in many cell types that devote a large fraction of their biosynthetic resources to one or a few specific proteins.\n\nc. Recycling of sulfolipids as a S source\n\nMany oxygenic photosynthetic organism produce S-containing lipids as part of their chloroplast membrane. For example, sulfoquinovosyl diacylglycerol (SQDG) is a major component of the thylakoid membrane in cyanobacteria and in C. reinhardtii. In the latter organism, SQDG accounts for ~13% of total cell S, and up to 85% of this lipid is degraded within 6–12 hours in response to S limitation. This S recycling mechanism, which is regulated as part of the S acclimation response (Sugimoto et al., 2010), provides a large fraction of the S needed for ongoing protein synthesis. It is formally possible that degradation of an abundant protein (such as Rubisco) could provide a comparable amount of S (and in the more convenient form of Cys and Met) (Sugimoto et al., 2007). Indeed, S starvation does lead to a decrease in Rubisco levels, but this response appears to occur on a much longer timescale than the mobilization of S from SQDG, suggesting that this may be a secondary mechanism (Sugimoto et al., 2007).\n\nB. Phosphorous (P): An indispensable element for information and energy transfer\n\nPhosphorous is required for life and exists in cells primarily as the phosphate anion (PO43−) in various states of protonation and esterification. At neutral pH, phosphate is predominantly in the HPO42− and H2PO4− states; phosphate esters also carry a net negative charge in cells. Phosphate forms the linkage unit of nucleic acids and is therefore essential for the storage, transmission, and expression of genetic information < >. Nucleoside triphosphates (NTPs) not only serve as precursors for the synthesis of DNA and RNA, but also function as the universal energy currency in the cell with most biosynthetic processes fueled directly or indirectly by NTP hydrolysis. In E. coli, the total P content is ~3% of dry weight, making P one of the major macronutrients for cell growth (Neidhardt et al., 1990). The ribonucleotides are present at millimolar concentrations and their γ-phosphoryl groups turnover rapidly during growth. Most ATP is synthesized in respiring cells by ATP synthase using the energy of the proton-motive force. The free energy of hydrolysis of the phosphoanhydride linkages drives anabolic metabolism, while energy yielding catabolic metabolism can be coupled to ATP or GTP synthesis. GTP hydrolysis fuels the process of translation, one of the single most energy intensive processes in growing cells.\n\nPhosphorous can also be used for a variety of other functions including most commonly the synthesis of the phospholipids of the membrane lipid bilayer. Phosphorus containing polymers are also abundant in the cell walls of Gram positive bacteria (in teichoic acids). When in excess, phosphate can be polymerized into polyphosphate, which is a potential storage form of P. Although each of these P-containing molecules can be a significant fraction of total cellular P, they are not universally present and may, in some cases, be expressed conditional on P availability ( ).\n\nWhile it is generally accepted that P is required for life, it has been speculated that alternative types of biochemistry might be feasible in which P is substituted with As (Wolfe-Simon et al., 2009). This idea grew out of an exercise in trying to imagine what types of alternative biochemical processes might be able to evolve in extreme habitats (or on planets) where the availability of elements is substantially different (Davies et al., 2009). The authors postulate that there might exist on Earth a \"shadow biosphere\" of alternative chemistries and analysis of these \"weird\" organisms could shed light on possible lifeforms on other planets. This concept rose to international prominence recently with the publication of an article (Wolfe-Simon et al., 2011) with the unfortunately misleading title of \"A Bacterium That Can Grow by Using Arsenic Instead of Phosphorus.\" In this specific case, a bacterium tolerant to growth in very high concentrations of As was suggested to use As in place of P in some of its macromolecules, and a specific claim was made for incorporation (albeit at a very low level) into DNA. Nevertheless, the evidence presented did not meet biochemical criteria for establishing chemical linkages (see Comments published in response to the article). One of the key concerns is that replacement of a significant amount of P by As is chemically implausible. The phosphoanhydride linkage is special because its hydrolysis has a high activation energy (requiring catalysis in vivo) but a negative free energy change, which drives group transfer reactions. Interested readers will find further discussions of these results in numerous online blogs, news commentaries, and several published articles (Danchin, 2010, Rosen et al., 2011, Silver and Phung le, 2011). As described below, there are in fact numerous examples of elegant solutions to the problem of limited P availability, and these can reduce the P requirements for growth significantly, but not eliminate this requirement completely. These responses often target P-rich components of the cell wall or membrane rather than NTPs or nucleic acids.\n\n1. Acclimation to phosphorous limitation: cell wall remodeling in Bacillus subtilis\n\nGrowth of B. subtilis in phosphate limiting conditions activates a complex acclimation process regulated by the PhoPR two-component system (Hulett, 1996). A central feature of this acclimation mechanism is a remodeling of the cell wall as a mechanism to optimize growth. In media containing sufficient phosphate (~2 mM or more), B. subtilis cell walls contain an abundant anionic polymer known as teichoic acid that accounts for nearly 50% of cell wall weight (Bhavsar and Brown, 2006). Teichoic acids are alternating copolymers of glycerol and phosphate and can be linked to a glycolipid carrier (in lipoteichoic acid) or to the peptidoglycan cell wall (in wall teichoic acid). Cells grown in P limited medium repress the expression of the wall teichoic acid biosynthetic pathway and activate the expression of an alternative anionic polymer, teichuronic acid (Qi and Hulett, 1998, Lahooti and Harwood, 1999). In teichuronic acid, the carboxylates provide the negative charge that the phosphates provide in the teichoic acids. This is not necessarily a complete replacement, since the synthesis of teichoic acids may continue at a low maintenence level even under P limitation (Botella et al., 2011). Nevertheless, this remodeling of the cell wall is found to significantly reduce cellular P demand. Cells grown with limiting P contain only 32–47% as much P as cells grown in P-replete medium and the amount of P in the cell wall fraction was reduced by 25-fold (Lang et al., 1982). The ability of cells to reduce their P demand by a factor of 2 or more, simply by altering the composition of the cell wall (while maintaining a comparable level of anionic polymers in the wall), is an efficient mechanism for optimizing P usage. It is not yet clear to what extent other P-containing macromolecules (including lipoteichoic acid) may be functionally replaced, nor is it clear whether pre-existing teichoic acid is scavenged as a P source, although this seems reasonable.\n\n2. Adaptation and acclimation by membrane phospholipid remodeling in Bacteria\n\nMembrane phospholipids are responsible for a large fraction of the phosphorus content of both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. Heterotrophic and phototrophic microorganisms face P deficient growth conditions in unfertilized soils as well as in aquatic environments (Bieleski, 1973). P deficiency has been described for many regions of the open ocean, yet it does not appear to limit productivity because the inhabiting Prochlorococcus species have adapted to the low P content of that niche by reducing their P quota to 1:500, which is substantially lower than the Redfield ratio of 1:106 (Bertilsson et al., 2003). This is accomplished by replacement of membrane anionic phospholipids by anionic sulfolipids, specifically sulfoquinovosyl diglyceride (SQDG): less than 1% of the assimilated P is incorporated into membrane lipids, which spares P for nucleic acid and nucleotides, where its function is irreplaceable (Van Mooy et al., 2006). In comparing the fate of P assimilate in the Sargasso sea where P levels are <10 nM to the South Pacific subtropical gyre with 10-fold higher P concentrations, the authors noted 1.3% allocation to phospholipid in the former vs. 17% in the latter (Van Mooy et al., 2009). In parallel, analysis of membrane lipids from these locations showed that S- and N-containing lipids were more abundant in the former vs. the latter, and it was suggested that this P sparing adaptation is important for the success of prokaryotic Prochlorococcus and cyanobacterial species as well as eukaryotic phytoplankton in these environments. Measurements of various lipid types in laboratory experiments with P-replete vs. –deplete conditions indicate that the ability of the prokaryotes to synthesize a sulfolipid spares up to 43% of the P quota.\n\nThe replacement of phospholipids is a common acclimation response in bacteria faced with P deficiency. It has been documented in rhizobia, where SQDG, ornithine-containing lipids and diacylglyceryl trimethylhomoserine are used as substitutes, in Pseudomonas, where acidic glycolipids replace phospholipids, in gram positive Marinococcus species, where sulfolipid replaces phosphatidylglycerol, and anoxygenic photosynthetic bacteria where each of these replaces phospholipids in response to P deficiency (e.g. Minnikin et al., 1974, Benning et al., 1995, Geiger et al., 1999, Sprott et al., 2006). Cyanobacterial mutants blocked in sulfolipid synthesis or rhizobium mutants that are unable to synthesize ornithine or betaine lipids are growth compromised only in P-deficiency, indicating the importance of lipid substitution as a P-sparing mechanism (Güler et al., 1996, López-Lara et al., 2005).\n\nLipid substitution is an effective P-sparing response and degradation of pre-existing phospholipids also provides a P-recycling mechanism. Molecular genetic analysis in Rhizobium meliloti indicates that P-recycling is part of the phosphate-deficiency program mediated by the response regulator PhoB. A specific intracellular phospholipase C is induced so that the phospholipids (whose function can be covered by non-P-containing molecules) can be used as a pool of mobilizable P, which is recycled for molecules in which P is essential (like nucleotides) (Geiger et al., 1999, Zavaleta-Pastor et al., 2010).\n\n3. P-sparing and recycling in Chlamydomonas\n\nBecause of the importance of P in agriculture (it is one of the major constituents of fertilizer), there is an excellent understanding of P metabolism and its regulation in reference organisms like C. reinhardtii (reviewed in Irihimovitch and Yehudai-Resheff, 2008, Moseley and Grossman, 2009). Three phospholipids (phosphatidylglycerol, -ethanolamine and –inositol) are prevalent in membranes of P-replete cells. In P-deficiency, phosphatidylglycerol is reduced by as much as 50%, concomitant with a greater than 2-fold increase in sulfolipids. The importance of this substitution is evident from the phenotype of an sqd1 sulfolipid biosynthesis mutant, which grows poorly under P starvation (Riekhof et al., 2003). Nevertheless, because of specific binding sites for lipids in membrane protein complexes (e.g. phosphatidylglycerol in photosystem II; PS II), sulfolipid cannot completely replace phospholipid in the thylakoid membrane (Yu et al., 2002).\n\nP sparing via membrane lipid re-modelling is conserved throughout the plant lineage, and has been documented in moss, Arabidopsis and perennial rye grass, species that are separated from Chlamydomonas by a billion years of evolution (e.g. Yu et al., 2002, Wang et al., 2008, Byrne et al., 2011). In Arabidopsis, SQD1 mRNA and protein are dramatically increased in P-deficient plants and promoter-reporter fusions implicate transcriptional regulation (Essigmann et al., 1998, Hammond et al., 2003). In bacterial, algal, as well as Arabidopsis sqd mutants, the level of glycerolipids is maintained (or even increased), recycling of P is precluded, and mutant cells grow poorly in P-deficient conditions. The eukaryotic phytoplankton, such as the diatoms Thalassiosira pseudonana and Chaetoceros affinis and the coccolithophorid Emiliana huxleyi, use both sulfolipids and betaine lipids as substitutes for phospholipids, which spares about 10–30% of the P quota (Van Mooy et al., 2009, Martin et al., 2011).\n\nNucleic acids represent the other major reservoir of P. In C. reinhardtii, where the plastid genome is polyploid with up to 80 copies per cell, there is evidence for copy number reduction, which could release P for recycling to other processes. Interestingly, plastid mRNA abundance increases under P limitation because of down-regulation of a polynucleotide phosphorylase, a phosphorylytic enzyme responsible for cpRNA degradation which requires phosphate as a substrate. The regulation is dependent on Psr1, a Myb-domain transcriptional activator, which also turns on extracellular phosphatases and assimilatory transporters in P-deficient C. reinhardtii (Wykoff et al., 1999, Yehudai-Resheff et al., 2007). The up-regulation of nucleases in P-deficient plants has been noted in moss and Arabidopsis, but specific intracellular targets have not yet been identified and therefore whether this nucleic-acid based acclimation response extends beyond C. reinhardtii is not known.\n\nIII. Microbial Adaptation and Acclimation to Metal Ion Limitation\n\nSome metal ions are essential or beneficial for life, but others are neutral or even harmful, and some of the beneficial ones can become harmful when they are present in excess. The importance of metals in biology is reflected in the maturation of bioinorganic chemistry as a distinct discipline with its own meetings, societies, and journals including, for example, Bioinorganic Chemistry (Elsevier; initiated 1970), Biometals (Springer; 1997) and, more recently, Metallomics (RSC publishing, 2009).\n\nIt is estimated that 30% or more of proteins contain at least one metal cofactor in most organisms (Waldron et al., 2009, Seravalli and Ragsdale, 2010). The Zn metalloproteome is typically 5–6% of proteins in Bacteria to near 10% in Eukaryotes, with Fe-containing proteins having an inverse trend (Andreini et al., 2009). The key chemical properties of metal ions that contribute to their essential roles are their ability to serve as electron carriers and to function as electrophilic centers in catalysis. The midpoint potentials of many biological Fe and Cu centers are well suited for their electron carrier roles, and Fe, Zn, Mn, Co, and Mg are well suited for roles as electrophilic catalysts. Metal ions can also serve as organizing centers for the folding of small protein domains as exemplified by Zn finger proteins or Ca-binding domains, which are abundantly represented in eukaryotes.\n\nMicrobial responses to metal ions typically follow a gradient including states that can be defined as metal-limited, metal-deficient, metal-replete, or metal-excess. Limitation, also known as starvation, refers to a lack of an essential metal that leads typically to a cessation in the ability of the cell to grow and may lead to a loss of viability. Deficiency refers to a sub-optimal level of metal availability that impacts cell physiology and leads to measurable alterations in metabolism. Metal-replete conditions are those that provide enough metal to support growth and the accumulation of the full quota of proteins that require that metal, whereas metal excess refers to conditions where high concentrations of metals begin to negatively impact growth or may lead to cell death. As cells transition from replete to deficient to limited conditions they engage a variety of acclimation responses which include, as for the macronutrients, elemental acquisition, mobilization, sparing, and recycling. Conversely, as cells transition from replete to excess, they engage mechanisms to store excess metals for future use or may efflux the ions from the cell. Although detailed metal requirements vary significantly between species, similar acclimation strategies have evolved in multiple organisms across phylogenetic boundaries.\n\nA. Metal homeostasis across three domains of life\n\nThe use of metals within biology differs substantially between the Bacteria and Archaea and the Eukarya. In some cases, these differences reflect adaptations to specific niches. For example, the Archaeon Ferroplasma acidiphilum grows in highly acidic environments rich in Fe(II), the more bioavailable oxidation state, and routinely uses Fe in place of Zn to organize metalloprotein domains (Ferrer et al., 2007). More generally, the prevalence of different metal ions in various organisms reflects their evolutionary history. Life evolved in the ancient oceans and, in many ways, cells reflect the chemical composition of this environment (Dupont et al., 2010). The ancient (Archaen) ocean in which life evolved (beginning ca. ~4.5 billion years ago; GYA) was anoxic and chemically reducing with relatively high concentrations of Fe, Mn, Ni, and Co. The evolution of oxygenic photosynthesis contributed to an increase in atmospheric oxygen (~2.4 GYA) leading to an eventual transition to an ocean with oxygen-rich surface waters. As the ocean waters became more oxidizing (by ~0.8 to 0.5 GYA), Cu, Zn, and Mo became abundant whereas Fe, Mn, Ni, and Co were greatly reduced in abundance. Thus, Fe-containing proteins like cytochromes and ferredoxins and many Ni-containing enzymes are ancient, while Cu proteins are a more recent innovation (Crichton and Pierre, 2001).\n\nWith the availability of thousands of microbial genomes, and an ever improving ability to discern metal specificity from protein sequence, it has been possible to distinguish several trends in microbial metal ion utilization (Dupont et al., 2010). Bacteria and Archaea contain a core group of Zn proteins, often involved in central metabolism (transcription, translation), and comparatively more Fe, Mn, and Mo proteins. Assigning metal specificity to protein domains is not trivial, but it is notable that many of the earliest evolving protein domains appear to be cambialistic (able to use or function with multiple metal cofactors). Later evolving Eukaryotes make much greater use of Ca, Cu, and Zn, with the latter represented by the proliferation of Zn finger proteins. Whereas many non-heme Fe enzymes are conserved in all Domains of life, consistent with their early appearance in evolution, many Cu enzymes are specific to the eukaryotes and likely evolved after the great oxidation event when the bioavailability of Cu as cupric ion increased (Crichton and Pierre, 2001, Andreini et al., 2009). Conversely, the use of Ni as an enzyme cofactor appears to have declined over time (Zhang et al., 2009).\n\nMetal ion deficiencies are also widely appreciated in both medicine and agriculture. For instance, Fe deficiency anemia alone is estimated to affect nearly 1.7 billion people (25% of the population) (Benoist et al., 2008). Similarly, Fe-deficiency chlorosis is a common problem in agriculture, especially in alkaline soils. The consequences of excess exposure can also be severe, even for those metals required for life. Sophisticated metal ion homeostasis systems are therefore operative in cells to prevent the adverse effects of either deficiency or excess. Defects in metal ion homeostasis pathways, often involving proteins first defined in model systems, are increasingly recognized as a source of genetic disorders (Bleackley and Macgillivray, 2011).\n\nCompetition for limiting metal ions can be a determining factor for the outcome of host-pathogen interactions. The Fe-withholding response is an important feature of the innate immune system in mammals (Ganz, 2009). Bacterial pathogens have responded to the low levels of available Fe in the human host by elaboration of very high affinity siderophores such as enterobactin made by E. coli and its relatives (Fischbach et al., 2006). Humans have responded by the synthesis of a high affinity siderophore binding protein known as lipocalin or siderocalin. As this evolutionary arms race has continued, Salmonella has evolved the ability to decorate enterobactin with glycosyl groups (generating a family of compounds known as Salmochelins), thereby rendering lipocalin ineffective (Fischbach et al., 2006, Muller et al., 2009). The success of macrophages in killing engulfed bacteria can also depend on metal ion competition: the NRAMP family of divalent metal ion transporters were named for their role as \"natural resistance associated macrophage proteins.\" Subsequent to engulfment, NRAMP proteins deplete the phagocytic vacuole of Mn (and possibly Fe) thereby limiting bacterial growth (Cellier et al., 2007). Many bacteria, in turn, also have NRAMP family transporters working to import these very same cations. Neutrophils also play a role in the competition for metals by secreting a protein, calprotectin, that sequesters Mn and Zn (Corbin et al., 2008, Kehl-Fie and Skaar, 2010, Kehl-Fie et al., 2011). Metal toxicity is also employed as part of the macrophage killing arsenal by the delivery of redox active Cu to the phagosomal compartment (White et al., 2009, Wakeman and Skaar, 2011). Genetic studies indicate that, individually and collectively, these mechanisms can have a large impact on the outcome of infection (White et al., 2009, Haley and Skaar, 2011, Hammer and Skaar, 2011).\n\nB. Challenges in defining the roles of metals in biology\n\nThe concept of the metallome, as first coined by RJP Williams (Williams, 2001), refers to the quantitative description of the metal contents of cells. Ideally, metallomics seeks to describe both the amounts of each metal required for life and their distribution within the cell and its sub-cellular compartments. Clearly, the metallome differs between organisms and depends on the precise growth conditions studied. For many metals, the major fraction of the metallome is bound to proteins (the metalloproteome). However, efforts to define the nature of the metalloproteome are still in their early stages and there are many surprises still in store (Cvetkovic et al., 2010, Seravalli and Ragsdale, 2010).\n\nThe application of high sensitivity techniques for elemental analysis, such as inductively-coupled plasma mass spectroscopy (ICP-MS), allows the quantitation of elements down to at least the 1 part-per-billion (ppb) range. It is thereby possible to determine the elemental composition of cells with very high sensitivity and over many orders of magnitude of concentration. The amount of metal ion per cell is sometimes referred to as the metal quota. The very sensitivity of this technique, however, leads to additional challenges because of the ease with which samples can be contaminated. Analyses of trace elements in environmental samples, and in particular ocean waters (Sohrin and Bruland, 2011), have required the development of sophisticated sampling methods and the corollary laboratory studies typically require extensive efforts to prevent contamination including the use of clean-rooms (e.g. Shiller and Boyle, 1985, Trefry et al., 1985, Tortell and Price, 1996).\n\nWhile elemental analyses of cells can define metal ion quotas, these measurements do not distinguish metal ions bound to proteins or other macromolecules relative to those that are hydrated or bound to low molecular weight ligands. Nor do these measurements, by themselves, distinguish between cell compartment and organelles or between metal that is required for metabolism or stored for future use. When grown under replete conditions, much of the metal may be in storage compartments rather than in active use. Conversely, the metal remaining in metal-limited cells is likely to define a lower limit capable of supporting growth under the tested conditions. The metal quota of a replete cell was used recently in an approach to devise a trace element mix for C. reinhardtii (Kropat et al., 2011). This resulted in removal of non-beneficial elements (Co, B) and reduction of others (Zn, Mn) to provide only 3-fold the quota of a healthy cell, which allows room for accommodating an increased quota in situations of altered physiology.\n\nThe distribution of metals between their various possible coordination environments (referred to as speciation) varies enormously between metals, but is often quite similar between cells, governed as it is by the fundamental properties of the ions themselves (Waldron and Robinson, 2009). For example, Mg(II) is very soluble as a hydrated ion and is often present at high concentrations in cells where it is frequently complexed with phosphoryl groups in nucleic acids and other metabolites. Conversely, metals like Zn and Cu are tightly bound either to proteins or other chelating groups within the cell (Colvin et al., 2010, Robinson and Winge, 2010). As a result, the equilibrium concentration of free ions is sub-picomolar, although there is nevertheless a substantial pool of ions within the cell that is kinetically accessible for incorporation into nascent metalloproteins (Finney and O'Halloran, 2003). For some metals, specific protein \"chaperones\" ferry metals from their sites of uptake to their target proteins (O'Halloran and Culotta, 2000). Such metallochaperones play important roles in the delivery of Cu to specific proteins (Robinson and Winge, 2010), in the assembly of Fe/S clusters (Subramanian et al., 2011), in the insertion of Fe into protoporphyrin to generate heme, and the insertion of Ni into urease (Carter et al., 2009).\n\nThe speciation of metals in cells is governed by both kinetics and thermodynamics. The thermodynamics is described by the Irving-Williams series (Mn(II) < Fe(II) < Co(II) < Ni(II) < Cu(II) > Zn(II)). The ability of Cu to bind more tightly to ligands than other ions leads to toxicity, in part owing to the disruption of Fe/S centers in enzymes (Macomber and Imlay, 2009, Chillappagari et al., 2010). Kinetics is also important, since the ease with which metal-ligand bonds can be exchanged can determine the availability of the metal, both environmentally and within the cell. Intracellular movement of Cu is controlled by protein-protein interactions involving metal binding domains on target proteins and metallochaperones (Tottey et al., 2005, Boal and Rosenzweig, 2009). Proteins that require Cu for function are therefore metallated only by a specific Cu chaperone or after export from the cytosol (Tottey et al., 2008).\n\nDefining which metals are absolutely essential for growth is experimentally challenging even in the best understood model systems. Since many microorganisms can be grown in chemically defined media, it would appear to be easy to define the minimal elemental requirements for growth. Indeed, in the simplest cases the requirements are sufficiently high that they can be determined by monitoring growth as a function of added metal ion. However, in other cases the low level requirements, contamination of reagents and growth chambers, and the presence of high affinity acquisition systems make this approach problematic. Indeed, the impressive ability of cells to scavenge miniscule quantities of essential metals from their environment is a recurring challenge in metal ion nutrition studies. High affinity transport systems are likely present for all essential metals and may involve the secretion of high affinity chelators such as siderophores for Fe. Researchers sometimes rely on chelators to impose metal limitation, but chelation reduces but does not eliminate the bioavailability of the metal and has the added complication that chelators are generally not specific for a single element. The use of high purity chemicals and acid-washed glassware is important for reproducibility in laboratory experiments (e.g. Cox, 1994, Quinn and Merchant, 1998). However, metal ions tend to slowly leach even from acid-washed glassware and for some studies more stringent conditions are needed.\n\nIn one notable example, experiments to study the effects of Zn depletion in E. coli required the pretreatment of all non-metal media components with a solid-phase metal chelator (Chelex-100) and the use of a chemostat made from non-metal components (Graham et al., 2009). Cells were pregrown in Zn free chemically defined medium and yet, when the cells were recovered they contained more Zn than was added to the entire volume of growth medium used for their culture. This anomaly can be accounted for by the ability of cells to leach Zn from within the glass walls of the culture flask, despite the prior removal of bound metals by acid-washing. Indeed, the extent of Zn limitation increased with subsequent uses of the same flask, suggesting that E. coli is more efficient at removal of excess Zn from the culture flask than chemical chelation and acid-washing (Graham et al., 2009). Similar observations were made in laboratory experiments to generate Mn-deficiency in C. reinhardtii (Allen et al., 2007b).\n\nUltimately, the goal of metallome studies is to define both the metals needed for cellular functions, and to identify the enzymes that require metals for their activity. While the study of metalloenzymes in vitro has a long history, there are now several examples where the cofactor required for in vivo function was initially misassigned (Jain et al., 2005, Chai et al., 2008). This reflects the fact that metalloenzymes are often assayed under conditions that may not mimic the levels of metal ion availability in the cell. Moreover, many Fe-containing enzymes must be assayed anaerobically and, when assays are done aerobically, the strongest activation will often be provided by a different ion (Tripp et al., 2004).\n\nAn additional complexity in defining the metals essential for life is that, for some functions, metal ions play redundant roles. For example, two enzymes may each use a different metal ion to catalyze the same reaction and thereby be functionally redundant. This is the case, for example, with the multiple SOD isozymes in many organisms. In other cases, a single protein may be able to function with more than one ion. Such cambialistic enzymes include a subset of SODs (Priya et al., 2007), some carbonic anhydrases (Lane and Morel, 2000b), and a lipid A biosynthetic enzyme (Gattis et al., 2010). More generally, it has been suggested that many E. coli enzymes that may normally function with a non-heme Fe as cofactor may, under conditions of oxidative stress, use Mn instead (Anjem et al., 2009). Although there are relatively few well defined examples to date, these studies suggest that functional redundancy is likely to be more widespread than generally appreciated. One result is that the required levels of each metal may be interdependent, especially for abundant metalloenzymes. For example, for some phytoplankton limitation for Zn can be partially alleviated by Co or Cd (Morel, 2008). In marine systems, low Zn levels are also correlated with low P availability, which is problematic since alkaline phosphatase, a key P acquisition enzyme, is itself a Zn enzyme. To circumvent this Zn-P colimitation, many Prochlorococcus species contain a distinct Ca-dependent phosphatase, PhoX (Kathuria and Martiny, 2011). These complex interactions between elements emphasize the challenges inherent in defining a minimal or representative metallome for any organism.\n\nRecent years have seen the development of powerful new techniques for monitoring metal ion speciation in cells, including both genetically encoded and chemical sensors to monitor metal availability in living cells (reviewed in Cook et al., 2008, Domaille et al., 2008, McRae et al., 2009, Vinkenborg et al., 2010, Palmer et al., 2011), nanometer-scale imaging Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (nanoSIMS) and related techniques to monitor spatial distributions of metals on a sub-micron scale (e.g. Orphan and House, 2009, Byrne et al., 2010), and fractionation techniques for monitoring metalloproteomes (Cvetkovic et al., 2010). These analytical techniques, particularly when applied to genetically amenable model organisms, will likely enable new insights into the diverse roles of metal ions in cells and, as a corollary, increase our understanding of the corresponding acclimation mechanism when metals become limiting.\n\nC. Iron (Fe): A near universal transition metal and redox center\n\nIron is required for the growth of nearly all cells. In cells, Fe is found in heme proteins such as catalase and cytochromes, iron-sulfur cluster (Fe/S)-containing electron carriers and enzymes, and non-heme Fe enzymes. In most cell types, Fe has multiple essential roles in the cell. For instance, both heme and Fe/S clusters are commonly essential for cell growth < >.\n\nThe only known exceptions to this general requirement are certain Bacteria that grow in severely Fe-limited environments. For example, the Lactobacilli and the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi (causative agent of Lyme disease) are thought not to require Fe (Weinberg, 1997, Posey and Gherardini, 2000). In the case of B. burgdorferi, there are at most a handful of Fe atoms present in the cell and no known or demonstrable requirement for Fe for growth (Posey and Gherardini, 2000). In addition to dispensing with heme and Fe/S-containing proteins, enzymes that in other organisms often require Fe for catalytic activity use a different metal in these systems. For example, in both L. plantarum and B. burgdorferi peptide deformylase contains a catalytically essential Zn in place of what would normally be Fe (Nguyen et al., 2007). This is an illustration of the general principle that one way in which cells adapt or acclimate to metal limitation is to replace one metal cofactor with another.\n\n1. Overview of molecular mechanisms of adaptation and acclimation to Fe-limitation\n\nMost bacteria, and all known eukaryotes, do not have the luxury of simply dispensing with a requirement for Fe. For these organisms, Fe is essential for growth and the response to Fe limitation is to reduce, to the maximal extent possible, the burden placed on the cell by the need to obtain Fe. In many different microbial systems, acclimation to Fe limitation involves Fe-sparing and Fe-recycling mechanisms analogous to those discussed above for macronutrients. The Fe-sparing response reduces the requirement for Fe-containing proteins by synthesizing alternative enzymes using either organic cofactors or other metal ions in place of Fe, and concurrently shutting off the synthesis of low-priority Fe proteins. In this context, low priority refers to those functions that are not absolutely essential for growth or which can be functionally replaced by other proteins and pathways. In some cases, as we will see, cells may also recycle Fe: they actively degrade pre-existing Fe-containing protein complexes simply to recover the valuable sequestered Fe.\n\nAcclimation to Fe limitation requires, first, that cells have mechanisms to monitor their Fe status and alter gene expression appropriately. In Bacteria, iron homeostasis is regulated by specific Fe-sensing metalloregulatory proteins, such as the ferric uptake repressor (Fur) and the diphtheria toxin repressor (DtxR), which serve to sense the cytosolic availability of Fe(II) (Hantke, 2001, Andrews et al., 2003). In S. cerevisiae and other fungi, Fe-acclimation responses are coordinated by functionally equivalent metalloregulatory proteins such as Aft1 and Aft2 (Philpott and Protchenko, 2008), whereas C. reinhardtii may use orthologs of the regulatory proteins found in Arabidopsis (Long et al., 2010).\n\nFur is representative of a large group of metalloregulators that sense metal ions such as Fe, Zn, Mn, and Ni to regulate metal homeostasis (Lee and Helmann, 2007). Typically, Fur family regulators act as metal-dependent transcriptional repressors, although there are exceptional organisms where Fur proteins can also act as direct activators by binding upstream of target genes and enhancing the recruitment or activity of RNA polymerase (Delany et al., 2004, Danielli et al., 2006). Under Fe replete conditions, Fur binds Fe(II) and represses the expression of uptake function and activates the expression of Fe storage proteins. Conversely, when Fe levels drop, iron uptake functions are derepressed and pathways contributing to acclimation are induced.\n\nIn response to Fe deficiency, induction of the Fur regulon leads to the expression of iron acquisition systems. Fur directly regulates the synthesis of high affinity uptake systems and chelators (siderophores) for import of Fe. This can potentially relieve the shortage, but only if accessible Fe is present in the environment. Fe may also be mobilized from intracellular stores including ferritins, bacterioferritins, and mini-ferritin/Dps family proteins. Ferritins can sequester up to ~5000 atoms of Fe while the smaller miniferritins can sequester 500 atoms within their spherical protein cores (Bevers and Theil, 2011). Although the pathways of Fe mineralization into these storage proteins are well studied, the processes by which this Fe is mobilized upon starvation are less clear (Smith, 2004). Fe mobilization likely involves the gating of specific pores (Liu et al., 2003, Bevers and Theil, 2011), and presumably also requires either a specific or non-specific reduction of the oxo-Fe core to release soluble Fe(II). In mammals, autophagy by degradation in the lysosome also plays a role in Fe recovery (De Domenico et al., 2009). As cells transition from iron deficient to iron limited conditions, they additionally engage programs of Fe-sparing and, in some systems, Fe-recycling.\n\nInsights into mechanisms of adaptation and acclimation to Fe limitation emerged early in ecological studies of Fe-limited systems and, in particular, studies of the marine ecosystem and its constituent microorganisms. These studies are complemented by detailed analyses of molecular mechanisms in reference organisms (including the Bacteria E. coli and B. subtilis and the Eukarya S. cerevisiae and C. reinhardtii) that have provided insights into how cells acclimate to changes in Fe availability.\n\n2. Fe-sparing and Fe-recycling: insights from marine picoplankton\n\nPrimary productivity of about 30% of the world’s ocean is Fe-limited, due in part to the high Fe-demand for photosynthesis (Raven et al., 1999, Behrenfeld et al., 2009). In addition, Fe-containing proteins are widely used for various redox reactions in cellular metabolism. Ocean surface waters often contain very low levels of Fe, with measurements indicating between 0.01 and 2 nM (Sandy and Butler, 2009). Marine bacteria, like many other Fe-limited organisms, synthesize and secrete siderophores (Sandy and Butler, 2009), express high affinity transport systems, and implement complex acclimation strategies to maximize growth in the face of elemental limitations. Here, we focus specifically on adaptations that have emerged in this environment and on documented examples of acclimation by Fe-sparing and Fe-recycling.\n\na. Fe-sparing by substitution of ferredoxins with flavodoxins\n\nPerhaps the most widespread acclimation strategy for Fe-limitation is replacement of the electron carrier protein ferredoxin with an Fe-free alternative, flavodoxin. Ferredoxins are Fe/S proteins with negative midpoint potentials and they serve as electron donors in many biosynthetic reactions and, accordingly, are often abundant. In 1966, a protein with ferredoxin activity was isolated from Clostridium pasteuranium cultured in iron-poor medium (Knight et al., 1966). This protein had a bound flavin and was named flavodoxin. Subsequent studies revealed that the substitution of ferredoxin with flavodoxin allows the former to be actively degraded in order to release and recycle Fe for maintenance of pyruvate synthase (another Fe/S protein) (Schönheit et al., 1979).\n\nThe loss of ferredoxins appears to have emerged as a genome adaptation for a clade of Prochlorococcus that is associated with very low Fe (estimated at <0.5 nM) in high nutrient, low chlorophyll (HNLC) regions of the ocean (Rusch et al., 2010). Metagenomic analyses suggest that Prochlorococcus strains from this environment have lost ~10% of the estimated 60 or so predicted Fe-containing proteins found in similar strains from more Fe-rich environments. The missing genes encode two ferredoxins, a plastoquinol terminal oxidase, and a cytochrome. Thus, one mechanism for adapting to a chronic limitation for Fe is to reduce the number of Fe requiring proteins encoded in the genome (Rusch et al., 2010).\n\nA more common evolutionary strategy is to retain the genes for both ferredoxins and flavodoxins, but only express the former when Fe is relatively abundant. The Fe-regulated substitution of ferredoxin with flavodoxin as a major electron carrier has been noted in numerous organisms including a chlorophyte alga, several cyanobacterial species, cryptomonads, and diatoms (e.g. Zumft and Spiller, 1971, Hutber et al., 1977, Sandmann and Malkin, 1983, Ragsdale and Ljungdahl, 1984, McKay et al., 1997, Li et al., 2004). The reciprocal pattern of expression is consistent with an Fe-sparing mechanism, since the substitution will decrease the Fe quota of the cell. The phenomenon is so widespread in nature that flavodoxin abundance is now the accepted standard biomarker for assessing Fe-status in the marine environment (La Roche et al., 1996). Down-regulation of ferredoxin in Fe-deficiency occurs even in organisms that do not have genetic information for flavodoxin. In these situations ferredoxin is essential and Fe-deficient cells reduce the abundance of ferredoxin, but do not eliminate it entirely (e.g. Pardo et al., 1990, Terauchi et al., 2010).\n\nIn Synechococcus sp. PCC7942, the regulation of ferredoxin occurs by Fe-dependent stabilization of the petF transcript. Induction of flavodoxin, encoded by the iron-starvation inducible gene isiB, occurs at the level of transcription (Leonhardt and Straus, 1992, Bovy et al., 1993). In many cyanobacteria, isiB is part of an Fe-deficiency stress operon that also encodes a modified antenna for the Fe-rich photosystem I (PS I) (discussed below).\n\nIn a cyanobacterial strain, Nostoc sp., Fe deficiency had a different impact on two ferredoxins of different midpoint potentials, leading to the suggestion that flavodoxin may not substitute for all the reactions of ferredoxin. Accordingly, the ferredoxin whose activity could be replaced by flavodoxin was more rapidly lost upon transition to Fe deficiency. Flavodoxins can replace ferredoxin in photosynthesis, where the proteins are acceptors from PS I and donors to NADP+ via a ferredoxin NADP+ oxidoreductase, and as substrates for a number of enzymes like ribonucleotide reductase, nitrate reductase, pyruvate formate oxidoreductase, hydrogenase, nitrogenase and the fatty acid desaturation reactions (e.g. Sandmann et al., 1990, Gangeswaran and Eady, 1996, Cotruvo and Stubbe, 2008, Chazarreta-Cifre et al., 2011). Biochemical comparison of ferredoxin and flavodoxin from Synechocystis sp. 6803 indicates very similar physical properties of the two proteins (with respect to isoelectric point and midpoint potentials) compatible with co-evolution in response to common reaction partners (Bottin and Lagoutte, 1992).\n\nCuriously, although this Fe-sparing mechanism is widespread in microbes, it appears to have been lost in land plants, even though Fe can be a limiting nutrient in the soil environment (Yi and Guerinot, 1996). Transgenic expression of a chloroplast-targeted flavodoxin complements a ferredoxin mutant, indicating that the protein can function in the plant chloroplast, so its absence in plant genomes remains a mystery (Blanco et al., 2011). Most plants, including algae, express multiple ferredoxin isoforms with specificity for a subset of the many ferredoxin-dependent reactions in the chloroplast (e.g. Hanke et al., 2004, Terauchi et al., 2009). The slightly reduced specificity of flavodoxin interaction with reaction partners compared to that of ferredoxin may have led to its loss in the land plant lineage in the absence of selective pressure for Fe sparing (Zurbriggen et al., 2007, Goñi et al., 2008).\n\nb. Fe-sparing by substitution of FeSOD with MnSOD and NiSOD\n\nThe replacement of FeSOD by MnSOD is another widespread Fe-sparing mechanism. It has been noted in bacteria, algae, as well as diatoms (Privalle and Fridovich, 1993, Wolfe-Simon et al., 2006, Allen et al., 2007b). In organisms adapted to the low Fe content of the open ocean, the use of MnSOD may contribute to their higher Mn quota (Peers and Price, 2004). The two SODs evolved from a common ancestor and are structurally highly similar, with specificity for Fe vs. Mn determined by the second shell ligands (Wintjens et al., 2004). Accordingly, in bacteria with an Fe-sparing genetic program, there are separate Fur-regulated genes, sodA and sodB, for each form (see below). Interestingly, it was reported that Cu can replace Fe or Mn, but the resulting enzyme is less active (Meier et al., 1994). This type of substitution may be adventitious rather than programmed.\n\nAn adaptation that has emerged in some organisms faced with chronic Fe limitation is the evolution of NiSOD (SodN). SodN is a structurally distinct protein that can functionally replace FeSOD. It has been noted that genes encoding SodN are widespread in the marine cyanobacteria and are correlated with the presence of urease, another (typically) Ni-requiring enzyme. Together, these two enzymes contribute to a Ni-requirement for bacteria in the ocean (Dupont et al., 2008b) while concomittantly reducing the cellular Fe quota. Streptomyces griseus and S. coelicolor also use a NiSOD to replace an Fe/ZnSOD and an FeSOD, respectively, but its use is controlled by Ni availability rather than Fe unavailability (see below).\n\nc. Fe-sparing and Fe-recycling by remodeling of PS I\n\nIn aerobic photosynthetic organisms, about half the Fe in the photosynthetic apparatus is found in PS I, which has three Fe4S4 centers. Accordingly, down-regulation of PS I is a common Fe-sparing acclimation response to Fe-deficiency in cyanobacteria, diatoms, and algae (Moseley et al., 2002, Strzepek and Harrison, 2004). In cyanobacteria, the down-regulation of PS I is accompanied by a complete re-modelling of the PS I-associated peripheral antenna to change the supply of excitation energy to that photosystem (Park et al., 1999, Ivanov et al., 2000, Havaux et al., 2005). The new antenna protein is encoded by the isiA (for iron stress induced) gene and is often co-transcribed with the previously-mentioned isiB gene encoding flavodoxin (Laudenbach et al., 1988, and see above). Indeed, isiA sequences are retrieved with the highest frequencies in metatranscriptome surveys of plankton communities in the oligotrophic open ocean. It ranked in the top 4 during a bloom of C. watsonii in the SW Pacific (Hewson et al., 2009). In Synechocystis 6803, the transcription of isiA is repressed by Fur in the Fe replete situation. When Fe is limited, the isiA operon is derepressed, although expression is limited, at least initially, by an antisense RNA (isrR) encoded on the opposite strand (Dühring et al., 2006). Diatoms adapted to low Fe content in the ocean appear to have lowered the ratio of PS I to PS II and also reduced the abundance of cytochrome-containing complexes to reduce the cellular Fe quota (Strzepek and Harrison, 2004).\n\nA fascinating example of Fe-sparing and recycling to reduce the cellular Fe quota was recently described in a marine cyanobacterium (Saito et al., 2011). The constitutive expression of flavodoxin in this organism suggests that it is adapted to persistent Fe-limitation. In many photosynthetic diazotrophs, photosynthesis and N2-fixation are separated either in space or time because of the incompatibility of oxygenic photosynthesis with the O2-sensitive metalloclusters in dinitrogenase (e.g. Schneegurt et al., 1994, Steunou et al., 2008). Temporal separation in Crocosphaera watsonii offers an opportunity for reducing the Fe quota. Proteomic analysis showed that nitrogenase metalloproteins changed from being the most abundant in the dark phase to being undetectable in the light phase while the Psa proteins of the Fe/S containing PS I complex and cytochromes showed the opposite pattern. The authors calculate that the “sharing” of intracellular Fe by daily degradation of the iron proteins and recycling of the released Fe reduces the Fe requirement by 40%, which would clearly be advantageous in a low Fe environment.\n\nWhen an organism is never in a state of Fe luxury owing to persistent (over evolutionary time scales) poor Fe supply in its niche, it may simply dispense with the gene for an Fe-containing protein, as suggested by the constitutive use of Cu-containing plastocyanin in place of cytochrome (Cyt) c6 in the diatom T. oceanica (Peers and Price, 2006). The trade-off is that this organism is now more s"
