This contrasts markedly with the situation in nearly all other European countries during the same period. No Scottish chronicles survive for this period and references to Scottish affairs in English chronicles are infrequent, although more information is included in Irish chronicles. In addition, the earliest confirmed Scottish royal charter dates from the reign of King Duncan II at the end of the 11th century, in contrast to the comparative wealth of charter evidence which has survived for Anglo-Saxon England. Reliable information now available about the early Scottish kingdom and its kings is therefore limited.\n\nThe present document attempts to reconstruct the genealogy of the Scottish kings from the mid-9th century. The earlier period, about which the information contained in the sources appears semi-mythical, has not been attempted. The reconstruction is based mainly on information extracted from Irish annals, in particular the Annals of Tigernath and Ulster (discussed in more detail in the Introduction to the document IRELAND), and in the 10th to 14th century Scottish chronicles which were collected by Skene in 1867 . The Chronicle of John of Fordun , which dates from the 1370s, and the later Liber Pluscardensis are two other important sources which have been consulted, although the former is unreliable on many points of detail. As will be observed when studying this document, these different primary sources are mutually contradictory in many areas. The major point of difference concerns the regnal years, which means that dating of the early Scottish kings is reliable only when it can be checked against outside sources such as the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle. A complete analysis of the differences in regnal years between the 16 different surviving manuscripts is set out by Duncan .\n\nThe nub of the problem with the available Scottish sources is that each succeeding manuscript contains more detailed information than the previous ones. The suspicion is therefore that later chroniclers supplemented the limited information available with bogus additions, for reasons which will be discussed further below. The earliest available source, the late 10th century Pictish Chronicle Cronica de Origine Antiquorum Pictorum which records events up to 995 , contains a bare outline of the names of the kings with some incomplete information about their affiliations and events during their reigns. In particular, the Cronica de Origine includes no information about how King Aedh and King Indulf were related to the main family line. However, when we read the 11th century Synchronisms of Flann Mainistreach and the 12th century Cronica Regum Scottorum , we see that the information has been expanded to show all the kings as related to each other. In the case of Kings Aedh and Indulf, they are stated to have been, respectively, the brother of King Constantine I and the son of King Constantine II. This process of expanded information continues with the Chronicle of the Scots and Picts dated 1177 and the two Chronicles of the Picts and Scots dated 1251 and 1317 , all of which include additional details about where the kings died and were buried, as well as some further family relationships. For example Greg (also referred to as Giric or Grime), son of King Kenneth II, whose death is dated to [1005], is named for the first time in the 1251 chronicle. It is of course not known which earlier sources, since disappeared, may have been used in the compilation of the later manuscripts. Nevertheless, this phenomenon of expanded information over time does not inspire confidence in the overall reliability of the data.\n\nIf this hypothesis is correct, what then would have inspired the later chroniclers to add bogus information? It is not easy to place oneself in the mind of the later medieval chronicler. However, in the late 11th century Scotland was emerging from a couple of centuries of political anarchy, exacerbated by continual rivalries with England and Ireland as well as frequent Viking attacks. For the first time, the kingdom benefited from a series of strong kings (for example Malcolm III, David I and William I) who were powerful enough to forge a sense of national identity. In this climate of renewed vigour, the contemporary chroniclers may have been keen to emphasise continuity in the earlier royal succession in order to reinforce the legitimacy of the present incumbents and boost national identity. The idea of continuity was probably best served by a lengthy male-line royal ancestry. In this context, one is reminded of the lengthy genealogies included in the later Anglo-Saxon chronicles which, as discussed in the Introduction to the document ANGLO-SAXON KINGS, were probably designed to reinforce the legitimacy of usurping monarchs and are of dubious factual accuracy. An interesting case from the Scottish documentation appears to support this idea: that of King Eochlaid, whose reign is dated to the 880s. He is named in the 10th century Cronica de Origine as successor to his maternal uncle King Aedh. However, he is omitted from later documents. If our hypothesis is correct, this omission may have been intentional as his relationship to his predecessor through the female line may have been considered incompatible with the idea of male-line royal continuity. Another point relates to the alleged burial of the early kings on the island of Iona. These burials are not mentioned in the 10th century Cronica but are first referred to in the Chronicle dated 1177, suggesting another case of information introduced into later documentation to reinforce the sense of continuity in early Scottish history.\n\nOther details about the early kings in the later Scottish chronicles are also dubious. For example, the more than 40 year reign attributed to King Constantine III in the first half of the 10th century, compared with the relatively short reigns of his predecessors and successors. King Constantine is named in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle so there is little doubt that he did exist, but it is possible that there were in fact two kings of the same name during this period attributed to Constantine III.\n\nAssuming that the information is correct, the Scottish chronicles reveal a remarkably regular alternation of royal succession between two collateral lines of descent from the earliest kings, with no case of a son succeeding his father. The obvious explanation is that the succession was claimed by the most powerful individual at the time, and that there was no particular pattern or custom which governed the right to the throne. No evidence has been uncovered to support any hypothesis regarding any succession pattern of these early kings. The only reference to succession practice which has been found is the report in the Chronicle of John of Fordun which states that King Kenneth II decreed a change to enable \"the nearest survivor in blood to the deceased king to succeed\" . The move would obviously have been unpopular in the wider royal family, and King Kenneth was not powerful enough to carry it through, as shown by his murder in 995, alleged in the same source to have been committed by his collateral relatives.\n\nAnother feature of the reconstructed genealogy shown below is the almost total lack of information about female members of the family, in particular the royal consorts. It would be inappropriate to draw too many conclusions about the insignificance of the role of early Scottish queens, assuming that consorts bore such a title (of which there is no evidence), as the absence of information may reflect lack of interest of the chroniclers rather than generally prevailing practices or attitudes. However, the information about Scottish queens and princesses which is found in primary sources from other countries is also sparse. This suggests minimal inter-marriage with neighbouring royal or noble families, in contrast once again with the Anglo-Saxon case, where information from Frankish, German and Scandinavian sources supplements the data in English primary sources concerning royal marriages.\n\nScottish kings were neither crowned nor anointed, but inaugurated in a ceremony which took place outdoors near the cross in the cemetery at the east end of the church of Scone. It is not known when this practice started as the first detailed account of such a ceremony is the 1249 inauguration of King Alexander III, recorded in the chronicle of John of Fordun. There appears to have been no equivalent ceremony for the queen.\n\nThe normal recorded form of title of the Scottish kings found in primary sources \"rex Scottorum\", frequently translated into English as \"King of the Scots\" rather than \"King of Scotland\", is of little practical significance as it mirrors the practice in chronicles which describe the king of England as \"rex Anglorum\" and the duke of Normandy as \"dux Normannorum\". The form \"King of Scotland\" is therefore used throughout this document rather than \"King of the Scots\".\n\nEarly Scottish history between the late 8th and late 11th centuries has been analysed effectively by Alex Woolf, who provides a detailed analysis of primary sources in a highly readable narrative . He pays particular attention to the source which in the present document is called the 10th century Pictish Chronicle Cronica de Origine Antiquorum Pictorum, which he suggests represents an original king list, spliced with other later material, and compiled in its present form by [1200] .\n\nChapter 1. ORIGINS, KINGS of SCOTLAND 834-1034\n\n1. [EOCHAID . m ---. The name of Eochaids wife is not known. Eochaid & his wife had [one child]:]\n\na) [ALPIN (-killed in battle against the Picts in Galloway [20 Jul/Aug] 834). The Chronicle of John of Fordun records the accession of \"Alpin the son of Achay\" in 831, his reign of three years, and his defeat by the Picts \"20 July\" after which he was beheaded . The 12th century Cronica Regum Scottorum lists \"Alpin filius Eochal venenosi iii, Kynedus filius Alpini primus rex Scottorum xvi \" as kings, dated to the 9th century . It should be noted that Alpins parentage is not stated in the earlier chronicles.] m ---. The name of Alpin's wife is not known. Alpin & his wife had two children:\n\ni)KENNETH [Cinaed] MacAlpin (-Forteviot, Perthshire 13 Feb [858], bur [Isle of Iona]) . His parentage is confirmed by the Annals of Ulster which record the death in 858 of \"Cinaed son of Ailpín king of the Picts\" . He succeeded as KENNETH I King of Scotland.\n\n- see below.\n\nii)DONALD [Domnall] (-Kinn Belachoir palace or killed in battle Scone 13 Apr [863], bur [Isle of Iona]). The 10th century Pictish Chronicle Cronica de Origine Antiquorum Pictorum records that \"Kinadius filius Alpini, primus Scottorum Dunevaldus frater eius\" ruled for four years . The 12th century Cronica Regum Scottorum lists \"Alpin filius Eochal venenosi iii, Kynedus filius Alpini primus rex Scottorum xvi, Dolfnal filius Alpini iiii \" as kings, dated to the 9th century . The Chronicle of John of Fordun records that \"Donald also a son of Alpin\" succeeded his brother in 854, reigned for four years, died \"at Scone\" and was buried \"in Iona beside his brother\" . He succeeded his brother as DONALD I King of Scotland. The 11th century Synchronisms of Flann Mainistreach name (in order) \"Cinaet mac Ailpin Domnall mac Ailpin, Custantin mac Cinaeta, (Aedh mac Cinaedha), Girg mac Dungaile, Domnall Dasachtach (mac Custantin)\" as Scottish kings, dated to the 9th and 10th centuries . The Annals of Ulster record the death in 862 of \"Domnall son of Ailpín king of the Picts\" . The 10th century Pictish Chronicle Cronica de Origine Antiquorum Pictorum records that \"Dunevaldus\" died \"in palacio Cinn Belachoir idus Aprilis\" . The Chronicle of the Scots and Picts dated 1177 records that \"Douenald mac Alpin\" reigned for 4 years, died \"in Rathinueramon\" and was buried \"in Iona insula\" .\n\n1. [LICET] or [DONGAL] . m ---. The name of his wife is not known. [Licet/Dongal] had one child:\n\na)GREG [Grig/Ciricius] (-Donedoure [892], bur [Isle of Iona]). The 10th century Pictish Chronicle Cronica de Origine Antiquorum Pictorum records that, when \"Eochodius filius Run regis Britannorum, nepos Cinadei ex filia\" succeeded King Aedh, \"others say\" that \"Licet Ciricium filium\" reigned . The Cronica de Origine fixes the chronology by adding that \"Aed filius Neil\" died in the second year of his reign, and that there was a solar eclipse in the ninth year, adding that \"Eochodius\" was expelled from the kingdom. The Annals of Inisfallen and Annals of Ulster record the death of Aedh son of Niall King of Ireland (see the document IRELAND) in 879 of \"Aed son of Niall king of Temuir , which would place the accession of GREG King of Scotland to [877]. The 12th century Cronica Regum Scottorum lists \" Hed filius Kinet i anno, Grig filius Dunegal xii \" as king, dated to the 9th century . No information has yet been found to identify his alleged father \"Licet\". However, a different indication of Gregs parentage is provided by the 11th century Synchronisms of Flann Mainistreach, which name (in order) \"Cinaet mac Ailpin Domnall mac Ailpin, Custantin mac Cinaeta, (Aedh mac Cinaedha), Girg mac Dungaile, Domnall Dasachtach (mac Custantin)\" as Scottish kings, dated to the 9th and 10th centuries The Chronicle of John of Fordun, presumably echoing the Synchronisms, records that \"his brother Heth the Wing-footed also a son of Kenneth the Great\" succeeded King Constantine and reigned one year, although \"according to the rule of the kingship Gregory son of Dungallus should have come before him\", adding in a later passage that Gregory succeeded as king in 875 after Aedh died, and reigned eighteen years . The chronology suggests that \"Ciricius\" and \"Gregory\" refer to the same person. If these sources are being read correctly, Greg and Eochlaid ruled at the same time, presumably as rival kings probably over different parts of the country. If the mid-14th century John of Fordun can be believed, Greg had a better claim to the throne than King Aedh. This would suggest that he was a member of the same family, maybe in the previous generation. The Chronicle of the Scots and Picts dated 1177 records that \"Edh mac Kynnath\" reigned for one year, was killed \"in bello de in Strathalun a Girg filio Dungal\" and that \"Girg mac Dungal\" reigned for 12 years, died \"in Dundurn\" and was buried \"in Iona insula\" . The Chronicle of the Picts and Scots dated 1251 includes the same information . The Chronicle of John of Fordun records that \"King Gregory died after a vigorous reign of eighteen years, all but a few months at Donedoure\" and was buried \"in the island of Iona\" .\n\nThe precise relationship between the following family group and the main family of Scottish kings has not been determined, but the names suggest a close relationship.\n\n1.ALPIN . m ---. The name of Alpins wife is not known. Alpin & his wife had one child:\n\na)EOCHAID (-[937/40]). The 10th century Pictish Chronicle Cronica de Origine Antiquorum Pictorum records the death of \"Dubucan filius Indrechtaig mormair Oengusa, Adalstan filius Advar rig Saxan, et Eochaid filius Alpini\" , dated to [937/40] if the second person named can be identified as Æthelstan King of Wessex.\n\nKENNETH [Cinaed] MacAlpin, son of ALPIN & his wife --- (-Forteviot, Perthshire 13 Feb [858], bur [Isle of Iona]) . The 10th century Pictish Chronicle Cronica de Origine Antiquorum Pictorum records that \"Kinadius filius Alpini, primus Scottorum\" assumed the \"Dalriete regnum\" two years before coming to \"Pictaviam\" which he for 16 years . The 12th century Cronica Regum Scottorum lists \"Alpin filius Eochal venenosi iii, Kynedus filius Alpini primus rex Scottorum xvi \" as kings, dated to the 9th century . The Chronicle of John of Fordun records that \"Kenneth son of Alpin\" succeeded his father in 834, and became king of the Picts in 839 \"when they had been overcome\", and reigned \"nearly sixteen years as sole monarch of these kingdoms\" . Thereafter he is considered to have succeeded as KENNETH I King of Scotland. The 11th century Synchronisms of Flann Mainistreach name (in order) \"Cinaet mac Ailpin Domnall mac Ailpin, Custantin mac Cinaeta, (Aedh mac Cinaedha), Girg mac Dungaile, Domnall Dasachtach (mac Custantin)\" as Scottish kings, dated to the 9th and 10th centuries, adding that \"Kenneth son of Alpin was the first king who possessed the kingdom of Scone, of the Gael\" . The Annals of Ulster record the death in 858 of \"Cinaed son of Ailpín king of the Picts\" . The 10th century Pictish Chronicle Cronica de Origine Antiquorum Pictorum records that \"Kinadius filius Alpini, primus Scottorum\" died \"Id Feb\" from a tumour \"in palacio Fothuirtabaicht\" .

The Chronicle of John of Fordun records that \"Constantine son of Heth the Wing-footed\" granted \"the lordship of the region of Cumbria\" to \"Eugenius the son of Donald his expected next heir\" in \"the sixteenth year of his reign\" ([916/20] . No reference to him as been found in any other primary source. His name is not typical of the period. His existence should be treated with caution.]\n\nii)MALCOLM [Maelcoluim] (-killed Vlurn [954], bur [Isle of Iona]) . His parentage is confirmed by the Annals of Ulster which record the death in 954 of \"Mael Coluim son of Domnall king of Scotland killed\" . He succeeded in 942 as MALCOLM I King of Scotland.\n\n- see below.\n\n2. [AEDH (-killed in battle Strathallan [878], bur [Isle of Iona] or [Maiden Stone, Aberdeenshire]) . The 10th century Pictish Chronicle Cronica de Origine Antiquorum Pictorum records that \"Edus\" succeeded King Constantine I and for 1 year and was killed \"in civitate Nrurim\", but does not state the family relationship between the two kings . As noted in the Introduction to this document, the relationship between Aedh and his predecessors is only mentioned from the 11th century Synchronisms of Flann Mainistreach which name (in order) \"Cinaet mac Ailpin Domnall mac Ailpin, Custantin mac Cinaeta, (Aedh mac Cinaedha), Girg mac Dungaile, Domnall Dasachtach (mac Custantin)\" as Scottish kings, dated to the 9th and 10th centuries .

Her parentage and marriage are confirmed by the 10th century Pictish Chronicle Cronica de Origine Antiquorum Pictorum which records that \"Eochodius filius Run regis Britannorum, nepos Cinadei ex filia\" succeeded King Aedh and ruled for 11 years . m RUN Macarthagail King of Strathclyde, son of --- ([878]).

The 10th century Pictish Chronicle Cronica de Origine Antiquorum Pictorum records that \"Eochodius filius Run regis Britannorum, nepos Cinadei ex filia\" succeeded King Aedh and ruled for 11 years before being expelled . The 12th century Cronica Regum Scottorum does not name Eochlaid in its king-list . He succeeded his maternal uncle as EOCHAID King of Scotland. His succession appears to have been challenged by Greg (see above). Deposed [889].\n\n4.MAEL MUIRE (-913) . The mid-12th century Banshenchas records that \"Mael Muire daughter of Cinaed son of Alpin\" married \"Aed Finnliath and then later Flann Sinna\" . The reliability of this information is unknown, although the inclusion of a record of Mael Muires death in the Annals of Ulster (see below) indicates that she had some connection with Ireland. If the information is correct, the chronology dictates that Aedh Finnliath must have divorced his known wife Land of Osraige before marrying Mael Muire. The Annals of Ulster record the death in 913 of \"Mael Muire daughter of Cinaed son of Ailpin . [m firstly as his [third] wife, AEDH Finnliath King of Ireland, son of NIALL & his wife --- (-Druimm Inasclainn 20 Nov 879). m secondly [as his --- wife,] FLANN King of Ireland, son of MAELSECHLAINN King of Ireland & his [second] wife Land of Osraige ([847/48]-Tailltin 25 May 916).] [Possible child by her first husband:]\n\na) [DOMNALL (-after 911) . King of Strathclyde. The 10th century Pictish Chronicle Cronica de Origine Antiquorum Pictorum records the death of \"Doneualdus rex Britannorum\", during its record of the early part of the reign of Constantine II King of Scotland, and the choice of \"Duuenaldus filius Ede\" to succeed him, \"et Flann filius Maelsethnaill et Niall filius Ede\" . Some secondary sources show Donald as the son of Aedh King of Scotland. However, the subsequent references to the two Irish kings in the same passage suggest that the Chronicle is referring to the son of Aedh King of Ireland. If this hypothesis is correct, it is possible that Domnalls claim to the Strathclyde throne was through Mael Muire, shown above as the possible second wife of his father, which would mean in turn that this Domnall was not the same person as the son of Aedh of the same name who is recorded in 863 (see above).]\n\nAEDH, son of [KENNETH I King of Scotland & his wife ---] (-killed in battle Strathallan [878], bur [Isle of Iona] or [Maiden Stone, Aberdeenshire]) .

As noted in the Introduction to this document, the relationship between Aedh and his predecessors is only mentioned from the 11th century Synchronisms of Flann Mainistreach which name (in order) \"Cinaet mac Ailpin Domnall mac Ailpin, Custantin mac Cinaeta, (Aedh mac Cinaedha), Girg mac Dungaile, Domnall Dasachtach (mac Custantin)\" as Scottish kings, dated to the 9th and 10th centuries . The suspicion is that his family relationship may have been fabricated by later Scottish chroniclers who were concerned with reinforcing the continuity in the male line of the Scottish succession. He succeeded as AEDH King of Scotland. The sources suggest that his succession was challenged by Greg and maybe also by Eochaid. The 12th century Cronica Regum Scottorum lists \" Hed filius Kinet i anno, Grig filius Dunegal xii \" as king, dated to the 9th century .

Florence of Worcester records that \"rex Scottorum Reignoldus rex Danorum rex Streatcledwalorum\" submitted to King Eadward and signed a treaty, undated but dateable to [920/22] from the context . The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle date of 923 is not compatible with the date of the death of Rægnald King of York, recorded in 921 in the Annals of Ulster . This subjection to England evidently did not last as the Chronicle records King Athelstan bringing \"into submission all the kings in this island [including] Constantine king of Scots\" in 926 and invading Scotland in 934 \"both with a land and naval force\" .

The Chronicle of John of Fordun records that, according to \"William\", King Constantine was killed at Brunanburgh, but that \"various truthful chronicles\" say that he reigned for four more years, \"he resigned the crown and, serving God in the monastic garb at St Andrews, was made abbot of the Culdees and lived there five years, where he also died and was buried\" but was reburied in Iona \"in the chapel of the blessed Oran in 947\" .

The Prophecy of Berchán (dated to the early 11th century? ) records that the mother of King Malcolm II came from Leinster . If this report is accurate, Kenneths status suggests that his wife would have been the daughter of one of the kings of Leinster (see the document IRELAND). Insufficient information is known about the several 10th century Leinster kings to be able to guess which one might have been her father. Kenneth II & his wife had one child:\n\na)MALCOLM ([954]-Glamis Castle, Angus 25 Nov 1034, bur Isle of Iona).

The 12th century Cronica Regum Scottorum lists \" Malcolin filius Kinet xxx \" as king . It is tempting to suggest that either he, or his first cousin with the same name, spent time at the court of Edgar King of England during his youth, as \"Malcolm dux\" subscribed a charter of King Edgar relating to land in Cambridgeshire and Norfolk dated 970 , but there is no proof of the co-identity of these persons.

Many secondary sources name Donada as a younger daughter of King Malcolm II and the mother of King Macbeth. It seems that the proof for this connection is slim. The only source so far identified which refers to Macbeths maternal origin is the Chronicle of Huntingdon which names \"Maket Regem [=King Macbeth] nepotem dicti Malcolmi\" when recording that he was expelled from Scotland after ruling 15 years . The word \"nepos\" is of course treacherous, and could indicate a variety of relationships in addition to grandson. However, it appears that early historians assumed that \"grandson\" was the correct translation. For example, Ralph Holinsheds 1577 Chronicle of Scotland names \"Doada\" as second daughter of Malcolm II King of Scotland and adds that she married \"Sinell the thane of Glammis, by whom she had issue one Makbeth\" . Another variation is provided by the Cronykil of Andrew of Wyntoun, which records that \"Makbeth-Fynlak, his systyr sowne\" murdered King Duncan . From a chronological point of view, it is unlikely that Macbeth could have been a nephew of King Duncan, but it is possible that the passage represents an interpretation of \"nepos\" from an earlier source and has confused the king with whom Macbeth enjoyed this relationship. No source earlier than Holinshed has been found which names her Donada. m as his second wife, FINDLAECH MacRory Thane of Angus Mormaer of Moray, son of RUAIDHRI Mormaer of Moray & his wife --- (-1020).

Rodulfus Glaber refers to Canute King of England seeking \"the friendship of the king of the Scots, receiving his son at the font of baptism\" . This passage follows a description of \"the Scots whose king was called Malcolm\" resisting King Canute's invasion, undated but from the context apparently occurring at the start of Canute's reign. If it is correct that King Malcolm had a son baptised at this time, he would have been considerably younger than the king's daughters, presumably therefore born to a different mother. No corroborative evidence for the existence of this son has been found in other contemporary sources.]\n\niv) [daughter . Orkneyinga Saga records that Earl Sigurd married the daughter of Malcolm King of Scots . Snorre records the marriage of \"Sigurd the Thick\" and \"a daughter of the Scottish king Malcolm\" .

The Chronicle of John of Fordun records that \"Machabeus son of Finele\" killed King Duncan and succeeded as king in 1040 . Mormaer of Moray [1029/32]. He may have been one of the \"two other kings, Mælbeth and Iehmarc\" recorded by the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle has having submitted to Canute King of England in 1031 with King Malcolm II . He succeeded in 1040 as MACBETH King of Scotland. The Chronicon of Marianus Scottus records that \"Donnchal rex Scotiæ\" was killed \"1040 XIX Kal Sep\" by \"duce suo Macbethad mac Finnloech\" who succeeded as king for 17 years .

Florence of Worcester records that \"Rex Scottiæ Macbethad\" distributed silver in Rome (\"Romæ argentum spargendo distribuit\"), dated to 1050 by the editor of the edition consulted . The dating of the various reports of King Macbeths defeat and death is inconsistent. It is not certain that all the records refer to the final battle in which he was killed. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle records that he was defeated in battle 27 Jul 1054 by the army of Siward Earl of Northumbria which had invaded Scotland . Florence of Worcester records that \"dux Northhymbrorum Siwardus\" defeated \"rege Scottorum Macbeotha\" in battle, dated to 1054, and installed \"Malcolmum regis Cumbrorum filium\" in his place .

The Annals of Ulster record that \"Lulach son of Gilla Comgain, over-king of Scotland was killed in battle by Mael Coluim son of Donnchad\" in 1058 . Dunbar, basing his argument on this and the other sources which are quoted in this section, states that \"from the above it seems most probable that Lulach was son of Gillacomgan and step-son of Macbeth\" . In addition, the 12th century Cronica Regum Scottorum lists \"Lulac nepos filii Boide\" [\"nephew of the son of Boite\"] as successor of King Macbeth .

Some secondary sources show Donald as the son of Aedh King of Scotland. However, the subsequent references to the two Irish kings in the same passage suggest that the Chronicle is referring to the son of Aedh King of Ireland. If this hypothesis is correct, it is possible that Domnalls claim to the Strathclyde throne was through Mael Muire, shown above as the possible second wife of his father, which would mean in turn that this Domnall was not the same person as the son of Aedh of the same name who is recorded in 863 (see above).\n\nChapter 3.

He is not named as king in the 12th century Cronica Regum Scottorum king-list . The Chronicle of John of Fordun names \"Duncan\" as son of \"Crynyne Abthane of Dul and Steward of the Isles\" and his wife . He succeeded in 1018 as King of Strathclyde. He succeeded his maternal grandfather in 1034 as DUNCAN I King of Scotland. Orkneyinga Saga records that Karl Hundason succeeded King Malcolm in Scotland and records his battles with Thorfinn Jarl of Orkney . No other record has been identified of this alleged person. The Annales Dunelmenses record that \"Dumechanus rex Scotorum\" besieged Durham in 1039 with a large army but retreated from the siege .

The Chronicle of John of Fordun records that the mother of Malcolm and Donald Bane, Duncans sons, was \"the cousin of Earl Siward\" . This information is not included in any earlier source and should be considered dubious. In one earlier king list, King Malcolm III's mother is named \"Suthen\" . No reference has been found in primary sources to her being named Sibylla, the name found in many secondary sources.\n\nKing Duncan I & his wife had [three] children:\n\n1.MALCOLM (1031-killed in battle near Alnwick, Northumberland 13 Nov 1093, bur Tynemouth, later transferred to Dunfermline Abbey, Fife, and later still to Escorial, Madrid) .

Matthew Paris names him as brother of King Malcolm, and records that he was elected by the Scots to succeed his brother in 1093 as DONALD III \"Bane\" King of Scotland . Florence of Worcester records that \"Dufenaldum regis Malcolmi fratrem\" was elected king after his brother's death but that \"filius regis Malcolmi Dunechain\" expelled \"patruum suum Dufenaldum\" . According to Florence of Worcester, he expelled all the English from the Scottish court . \"Douenald filius Conchat Regis\" made donations \"cum ceteris regibus Duncano rege Edgaro et Alexandro et David fratribus\" . This charter is undated and the reference to the four brothers all as kings indicates that it is probably spurious. Florence of Worcester records that King Donald was deposed in 1094 by his nephew Duncan, with help from the English and Normans . The Annals of Inisfallen record that \"Domnall son of Donnchadh killed Donnchadh son of Mael Coluim king of Alba in 1094 and took the kingship of Alba . The Chronicle of John of Fordun records that \"his uncle Donald again usurped the kingship\" after the death of \"Duncan, King Malcolms illegitimate son\" and reigned for three years . Florence of Worcester records that \"clitorem Eadgarum\" led an army to Scotland in [1097] to place \"consobrinum suum Eadgarum Malcolmi regis filium\" on the Scottish throne after expelling \"patruo suo Dufenaldo\" . William of Malmesbury records that King Duncan II \"was murdered by the wickedness of his uncle Donald\" and that the latter was \"dispatched by the contrivance of David, the youngest brother and the power of [King] William [II]\" . He was imprisoned. The Chronicle of the Picts and Scots dated 1251 records that \"Donald mac Donchat\" was captured \"a Edgar mac Malcolm\", blinded, died in \"Rosolpin\" and was buried \"in Dunkelden\", transferred to Iona . m ---. The name of Donald's wife is not known. King Donald III & his wife had [one child]:\n\na) [BETHOC (-[1150/70] ). The sources are contradictory regarding the supposed child of King Donald. The proofs relating to the claim to the Scottish throne in 1291 made by \"dñi Johannis Comyn\" name \"Gothrik\" as the son of \"Dovenald filius Duncani filii Erici\", and trace John Comyns descent from him . However, in the Great Roll, John Comyn traced his descent from Bethoc, daughter and heiress of Donald . Bethocs first marriage is confirmed by a charter of King Henry III dated 1261 which confirmed to John Comyn the land inherited from Hextildis, wife of Richard Comyn and daughter of Uhtred son of Waltheof . Her second marriage is referred to by Young but he does not cite the corresponding primary source, which has not yet been identified . Altogether the chronology for Bethoc is stretched almost to beyond credibility. Her supposed father King Donald Bane must have been born before 1040, and yet his daughter is supposed to have been living more than 100 years later, and her supposed second husband living in the last quarter of the 12th century. It is suggested that this supposed descent of Hextilda, wife of Richard Comyn, from King Donald Bane should be treated with caution. m firstly ([1085]) UHTRED Lord of Tynedale, son of WALTHEOF & his wife ---.

[MAELMUIRE [Melmare] . According to the Complete Peerage, Melmare, who it says was the father of Madach Earl of Atholl, was the son of Duncan I King of Scotland & his wife ---, but it cites no corresponding primary source . The primary source which confirms that this is correct has not yet been identified. The only primary source reference to Maelmuire which has so far been found is the undated charter under which David I King of Scotland granted protection to the clerics of Deer, which is witnessed by \"Donchado comite de Fib et Malmori dAthotla et Ggillebrite comite dEngus et Ghgillcomded Mac Aed \" . From the names of the earls of Fife and Angus, it is unlikely that this document can be dated to before 1135 at the earliest. If that is correct, it is evidently impossible from a chronological point of view that Maelmuire could have been the son of King Duncan I.]\n\nMALCOLM, son of DUNCAN I King of Scotland & his wife [Sibylla of Northumbria] (1031-killed in battle near Alnwick, Northumberland 13 Nov 1093 , bur Tynemouth St Albans , transferred to Dunfermline Abbey, Fife , transferred again to Escorial, Madrid) . The 12th century Cronica Regum Scottorum names \"Malcolaim filii Donnchada\" in one of its lists . The Chronicon of Marianus Scottus records that \"Moelcol filius Donchael\" succeeded Lulach in 1058 . [Florence of Worcester records that \"dux Northhymbrorum Siwardus\" defeated \"rege Scottorum Macbeotha\" in battle, dated to 1054, and installed \"Malcolmum regis Cumbrorum filium\" in his place . The Annales Dunelmenses record that \"Siwardus\" put \"Macbeth\" to flight in 1054 and installed \"Malcolmum rege\" in the following year . It is not clear that these two accounts refer to the future King Malcolm III: it is uncertain why King Malcolm would be called \"regis Cumbrorum filium\".] The Annals of Tigernach record that Lulach rí Alban was killed by Mael-Coluimb, son of Donnchad in 1058 . The Chronicle of John of Fordun records that Malcolm recaptured his kingdom with the help of \"Siward Earl of Northumberland\" and killed \"Machabeus\" 5 Dec 1056 . He succeeded in 1058 as MALCOLM III \"Caennmor/Bighead\" King of Scotland, crowned 25 Apr 1058 at Scone Abbey, Perthshire. Duncan cites sources which demonstrate that this nickname was first applied to King Malcolm III in the 13th century . He suggests that it was originally applied to King Malcolm IV who, he asserts, suffered from Paget's disease, involving a deformation of the bones particularly observable in the skull, and was later misapplied to King Malcolm III. King Malcolm supported the claim to the English crown of Edgar ætheling, whose sister he had married, and led plundering raids into England. Florence of Worcester records that he did homage to William I King of England at Abernethy in Aug 1072 . The same source records that King Malcolm invaded Northumberland in 1091, but did fealty to Willam II King of England after peace was negotiated between the two kings . Florence of Worcester records that \"rex Scottorum Malcolmus et primogenitus filius suus Eadwardus\" were killed in battle in Northumbria \"die S Bricii\" [13 Nov] by the army of \"Rotberti Northymbrorum comitis\" . William of Malmesbury records that he was killed, with his son Edward, by Morael of Bamborough, steward of Robert Mowbray Earl of Northumberland, while leading a raid into England . The Annals of Ulster record that \"Mael Coluim son of Donnchad, over-king of Scotland, and Edward his son, were killed by the French in Inber Alda in England\" .\n\n[m] [firstly] ([before 1058]) ---. The identity of the mother of King Malcolm's sons Duncan and Donald is uncertain. The absence of any reference to her in Scottish sources is best explained if her relationship with the king ended before his accession in 1058. However, this is not totally consistent with the estimated birth dates of her sons as shown below. It should be noted that King Duncan II, in his charter dated 1093, makes no reference to his mother, which implies that his father's relationship with her may have been short-lived and informal. Orkneyinga Saga records that Ingibjorg the Earls-Mother (Ingibjörg Finnsdatter, widow of Thorfinn \"the Black\" Jarl of Orkney and Caithness, daughter of Finn Arnisson [later Jarl of Halland in Denmark]) married Malcolm King of Scots, known as Long-neck and that their son was Duncan, King of Scots, father of William . There must be considerable doubt about whether this can be correct. Ingibjörg's [first] husband died in [1060/65]. King Malcolm's marriage to Queen Margaret is dated to 1070, three years after her arrival at the Scottish court. Although this provides sufficient time after the death of her first husband for the king to have married Ingebjörg, and for Ingebjörg to have died, the chronology for the birth of two sons would be tight. In addition, it is unlikely that either of these sons was born after [1065], as explained further below. If the king had really married Ingibjörg during this time, and if she had given birth to two sons, the absence of any reference to her in either Scottish or English sources is all the more surprising. It is possible that King Malcolm's marriage to Ingibjörg (if it did take place) was more Danico, implying concubinage rather than regular marriage, but this does not change the chronological difficulties. The one puzzle which remains, if the Saga is not correct, is why the author would have fabricated this detail.\n\nm [secondly] (Dunfermline Abbey 1070) MARGARET of England, daughter of EDWARD ætheling of England & his wife Agatha --- ([in Hungary] [1046/53]-Edinburgh Castle 16 Nov 1093, bur Dunfermline Abbey, Fife, transferred to Escorial, Madrid, her head bur Jesuit College, Douai). Although Margaret's birth is often placed in [1045/46] , a later birth would be more consistent with the \"German\" theory of her mother's origin (as discussed in the document ANGLO-SAXON KINGS). Margaret's birth as late as 1053 would still be consistent with her having given birth to four children before her daughter Edith/Matilda (later wife of Henry I King of England), whose birth is estimated to have taken place in [1079/80]. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle records that Margaret left England with her mother in Summer 1067 and found refuge at the court of Malcolm King of Scotland . Florence of Worcester records that \"clitone Eadgaro et matre sua Agatha duabusque sororibus suis Margareta et Christina\" left England for Scotland, in a passage which deals with events in mid-1068 . Florence of Worcester records that \"regina Scottorum Margareta\" died from grief after learning of the death of her husband and oldest son . The Annals of Ulster record that \"his queen Margaret died of sorrow for him within nine days\" after her husband was killed in battle . She was canonised in 1250, her feast day in Scotland is 16 Nov .\n\nKing Malcolm III & [his first wife] had [two] children:\n\n1.DUNCAN ([1060/65]-murdered Monthechim/Mondynes, Kincardineshire 12 Nov 1094, bur Dunfermline Abbey, Fife) .

There is no indication of the identity of Duncan's mother, as explained above. His birth date is estimated on the assumption that he was a child when given as a hostage in 1072, which precludes his being the son of Queen Margaret. It is possible that he was illegitimate, although there is no indication that he was thereby excluded from succession to the throne. \"Dunecanus fili regii Malcolum constans hereditarie rex Scotie\" donated property to the monks of St Cuthbert for the souls of his father, \"fratri mei, uxore mea et infans mei\" (all unnamed), by charter dated 1093, witnessed by \"Eadgari, [Etheread], Aceard, Ulf, Malcolub, Hormer, Heming, Ælfric, Teodbold, Earnulf\" . The copy in Early Scottish Charters lists the witnesses in a different order, and adds \"Grentonis Vinget\" . He was given as a hostage to William I King of England at Abernethy in 1072 to guarantee his father's good behaviour . The Annals of Ulster record that the \"French went into Scotland and brought away the son of the king of Scotland as hostage\" in 1072 , which presumably refers to Duncan as any of his half-brothers (if then born) would have been infants at the time. He was kept in Normandy. Florence of Worcester records that Robert III \"Curthose\" Duke of Normandy released \"Ulfam Haroldi quondam regis Anglorum filium, Dunechaldumque regis Scottorum Malcolmi filium\" from custody after his father's death in Sep 1087, knighted them and allowed them to leave Normandy . He joined William II King of England and remained at his court in England . Florence of Worcester records that Duncan served in the army of King William II, who supported his bid to depose his uncle, and to whom Duncan swore fealty before leaving for Scotland . He deposed his uncle in 1094 and proclaimed himself DUNCAN II King of Scotland . Florence of Worcester records that \"Dufenaldum regis Malcolmi fratrem\" was elected king after his brother's death but that \"filius regis Malcolmi Dunechain\" expelled \"patruum suum Dufenaldum\" . The Annals of Inisfallen record that \"Domnall son of Donnchadh killed Donnchadh son of Mael Coluim king of Alba in 1094 and took the kingship of Alba . The Annals of Ulster record that \"Donnchad son of Mael Coluim, king of Scotland, was treacherously killed by his own brothers Domnall and Edmond\" in 1094 . William of Malmesbury records that King Duncan was \"murdered by the wickedness of his uncle Donald\" . Florence of Worcester records that \"Scotti regem Dunechan\" was killed in [1094] . The Chronicle of the Picts and Scots dated 1251 records that \"Donechat mac Malcolm\" was killed \"a Malpeder Mackcolm comite de Merns in Monacheden\" through the treachery of \"Donald mac Donehat\" . The Chronicle of John of Fordun records that \"Duncan, King Malcolms illegitimate son\" was \"slain at Monthechin by the Earl of Mernys Malpetri, in Scottish, Malpedir, through the wiles of his uncle Donald\" as was buried \"in the island of Iona\" . m ([1090]) ETHELREDA of Northumberland, daughter of GOSPATRICK Earl of Northumberland & his wife --- (bur Dunfermline Abbey, Fife). The Cronicon Cumbriæ records that Waldevus filius comitis Cospatricii enfeoffed Waldeve filio Gileminii with property and Ethreda sorore sua . The Cronicon Cumbriæ records that Ethreda sorore Waldevi patris sui married Doncani comes de Murrayse and that their son Willielmus succeeded her nephew Alanus filius Waldevi . It is assumed that Duncan was Ethelredas first husband and Waltheof her second husband. She married secondly Waltheof. King Duncan II & his wife had one child:\n\na)WILLIAM FitzDuncan ([1091/94]-[1153/54]) . His parentage is confirmed by the Chronicle of John of Fordun (Continuator - Annals) which records the rebellion of his son \"Macwilliam whose real name was Donald Bane son of William son of Duncan the bastard\" against King William . That William was his father's only child is shown by King Duncan's charter dated to 1093 referring to \"infans mei\". As the actual date of the charter is more likely to be 1094, this leaves little time for the birth of any more children before the king's murder. \" Willelmo nepote comitis \" witnessed the charter dated to [1120] under which \"David comes filius Malcolmi Regis Scottorum\" founded the abbey of Selkirk . Lord of Skipton and Craven, by right of his [second] wife.\n\n- see below, Part C.\n\n2.DONALD ([1060/65]-[killed in battle] 1085). There is no indication of the name of Donald's mother. His birth date is estimated on the assumption that he was an adult when killed, and old enough to have had a son himself at that time, but this precludes his being the son of Queen Margaret. It is possible that he was illegitimate. The Annals of Ulster record that \"Domnall son of Mael Coluim, king of Scotland ended [his] life unhappily\" in 1085 . No further information has been found concerning the circumstances. m ---. The name of Donald's wife is not known. Donald & his wife had [one possible child]:\n\na) [LADHMANN (-killed in battle 1116). The Annals of Ulster record that \"Ladhmann son of Domnall, grandson of the king of Scotland, was killed by the men of Moray\" . It is not known with certainty to whom this refers, but a son of Donald, son of King Malcolm, is the most likely possibility.]\n\nKing Malcolm III & his second wife had eight children :\n\n3.EDWARD (-Edwardsisle, near Jedburgh 16 Nov 1093, bur Tynemouth St Albans). Florence of Worcester records that \"rex Scottorum Malcolmus et primogenitus filius suus Eadwardus\" were killed in battle in Northumbria \"die S Bricii\" [13 Nov] by the army of \"Rotberti Northymbrorum comitis\" . He is named, and his parentage given, by Roger of Hoveden, who lists him first of the sons . The Chronicle of John of Fordun names \"Edward, Edmund, Ethelred, Edgar, Alexander and David\" as the sons of King Malcolm and his wife . The Chronicle of John of Fordun records that, according to \"William\", \"Edmund was privy to his brother Duncans death, having bargained with his uncle [Donald] for half the kingdom\" but was captured and \"kept in fetters for ever\" . He died from wounds received at the battle of Alnwick during a raid on England led by his father. The Annals of Ulster record that \"Mael Coluim son of Donnchad, over-king of Scotland, and Edward his son, were killed by the French in Inber Alda in England\" . Matthew Paris reports that the remains of \"regis Scotorum Malcolmi et Edwardi filii sui\" were found at Tynemouth, commenting that both had been killed fighting \"Robertus de Mumbrai\" .\n\n4.EDMUND (-after 1097, bur [Montacute]). He is named, and his parentage given, by Roger of Hoveden, who lists him second of the sons . The Chronicle of John of Fordun names \"Edward, Edmund, Ethelred, Edgar, Alexander and David\" as the sons of King Malcolm and his wife, adding in a later passage that Edmund \"was buried at Montacute in England\" . He succeeded in 1094 as EDMUND joint King of Scotland, jointly with his uncle King Donald III \"Bane\", ruling south of the Forth/Clyde. He was deposed in 1097 by his brother Edgar, and became a monk at Montacute Abbey. Edmund is not mentioned either by Orderic Vitalis in his brief account of the usurpation of King Donald \"Bane\" , or by Florence of Worcester in his account of the deposition of King Donald in 1097 . If Edmund was older than his brother Edgar, it is not clear why their uncle Edgar Ætheling, who led the English army which deposed their uncle, would have supported the accession of Edgar in place of Edmund. The Annals of Ulster record that he was involved in the killing of his half-brother King Duncan . William of Malmesbury records that \"Edmund was the only degenerate son of Margaret\", that he \"[partook] in his uncle Donald's crime and had been accessory to his brother's death\", was \"doomed to perpetual imprisonment\", and \"on his near approach of death, ordered himself to be buried in his chains\" . The 12th century Cronica Regum Scottorum records that \"Edmundus\" was buried \"apud Montem Acutum in cella Cluniacensi\" .\n\n5.EDGAR ([1074]-[Dundee or Edinburgh Castle] 6 Jan 1107, bur Dunfermline Abbey, Fife). He is named, and his parentage given, by Roger of Hoveden, who lists him third of the sons . The Chronicle of John of Fordun names \"Edward, Edmund, Ethelred, Edgar, Alexander and David\" as the sons of King Malcolm and his wife . He succeeded in 1097 as EDGAR King of Scotland. Florence of Worcester records that \"clitorem Eadgarum\" led an army to Scotland in [1097] to place \"consobrinum suum Eadgarum Malcolmi regis filium\" on the Scottish throne after expelling \"patruo suo Dufenaldo\" . The reign of Edgar is ignored by Orderic Vitalis, who says that Alexander succeeded when King Donald was deposed . \"Edgarus filius Malcolmi Regis Scottorum\" made grants for the souls of \"fratrum meorum Doncani et Edwardi\" by charter dated 30 Aug 1095, subscribed by \"Egeri regis, Alexandri fratri eius, Manyanium, Agulfi, filii Doncani, Eyluerti, filii Eghe Omani, Uhtredi, filii Magdufe, Constantini, Rodberti de humet, Ætele, A. gulfi, Alimoldi filii sui, David\" . The precise dating of this charter and the unusual list of subscribers suggest that it may be spurious. \"Edgarus Rex Scottorum\" made grants for the souls of \"Malcolmi patris nostri et Margaretæ matris nostræ ac Edwardi et Duncani fratrum nostrorum\" by charter dated 1095 . Robert of Torigny records the death in 1107 of \"Edgarus rex Scotiæ\" . Florence of Worcester records the death \"VIII Id Jan\" in [1107] of \"Eadgarus rex Scottorum\" . The Chronicle of the Picts and Scots dated 1251 records that \"Edgar mac Malcolm\" reigned for 9 years, died \"in Dunedin\", and was buried \"in Dumferline\" .\n\n6.ALEXANDER ([1077/78]-Stirling Castle 23, 25 or 27 Apr 1124, bur Dunfermline Abbey, Fife) . He is named, and his parentage given, by Roger of Hoveden, who lists him fourth of the sons . The Chronicle of John of Fordun names \"Edward, Edmund, Ethelred, Edgar, Alexander and David\" as the sons of King Malcolm and his wife . Robert of Torigny records that \"Alexander frater eius\" succeeded in 1107 on the death of \"Edgarus rex Scotiæ\" . He succeeded his brother in 1107 as ALEXANDER I \"the Fierce\" King of Scotland. Florence of Worcester records that \"Alexander frater eius\" succeeded his brother King Edgar in [1107] . \"Alexander rex Scottorum filius regis Malcolmi et regine Margerete et Sibilla regina Scottorum filia Henrici regis Anglie\" reformed Scone Abbey by charter dated to [1114/15], witnessed by \"Alexander nepos regis Alexandri, Beth comes, Gospatricius Dolfini, Mallus comes, Madach comes, Rothri comes, Gartnach comes, Dufagan comes, Willelmus frater regine, Edwardus constabularius, Gospatricius filius Walthef, Ufieth Alfricus pincerna\" . The Chronicle of the Picts and Scots dated 1251 records that \"Alexander\" reigned for 17 years and 3 months, died \"in Crasleth\", and was buried \"in Dumferline\" . The Continuator of Florence of Worcester records the death \"VII Kal Mai\" [1123] of \"Alexander rex Scottorum\" . m (before [1114/15]) SIBYL, illegitimate daughter of HENRY I King of England & his mistress [---/Sibyl Corbet] (-Island of the Women, Loch Tay, Perthshire 12/13 Jul 1122, bur Island of the Women, Loch Tay). William of Malmesbury records the marriage of Alexander to the unnamed illegitimate daughter of King Henry, but adds \"there was some defect about the lady either in correctness of manners or elegance of person\" , which appears to imply mental retardation. \"Alexander rex Scottorum filius regis Malcolmi et regine Margerete et Sibilla regina Scottorum filia Henrici regis Anglie\" reformed Scone Abbey by charter dated to [1114/15] . Her name is confirmed by various charters, including the charter dated to [1120] under which \"Alexander Rex Scottorum filius Regis Malcolmi et Reginæ Margaretæ et Sibilla regina Scottorum filia Henrici regis Angliæ\" made grants . Considering the date of her marriage, it is unlikely that she was born much later than [1095]. The Complete Peerage suggests that she was the daughter of Sibyl Corbet, both because of her name and also because of the possible co-identity between \" Willelmo fratre reginæ \", who witnessed the charter dated 1124 under which \"Alexander Rex Scottorum\" granted jurisdiction to the prior of Scone , and \" Willielmo fratre meo \" who witnessed the charter dated to [1163/75] under which \"Reginaldus, Henrici Regis filius, comes Cornubiæ\" granted property to \"Willielmo de Boterell, filio Aliziæ Corbet, materteræ meæ\" . However, this co-identity is not ideal from a chronological point of view. William, brother of Renaud Earl of Cornwall, died after 1187. If he was the same person as the brother of Sibyl Queen of Scotland, he could only have been a child when he subscribed the Scottish charters in which he is named. In addition, as noted in the document ENGLAND KINGS, it is possible that William, brother of Earl Renaud, may have been his uterine brother, in which case it is unlikely that he would have been chosen to accompany the queen to Scotland. Another factor is that the birth of Herbert FitzHerbert, son of Sibyl Corbet by her marriage, is estimated to [1125/35] (see the document UNTITLED ENGLISH NOBILITY). This means that he could only have b"
