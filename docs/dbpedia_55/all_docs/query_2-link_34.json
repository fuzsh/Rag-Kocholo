        "text": "The University of Alabama Libraries\n\nLibraries\n\nSpecial Collections\n\nResearch Portals\n\nRare Maps Collection\n\nBy Kate Matheny, Outreach Coordinator for Special Collections\n\nHoole Library’s Rare Maps Collection is divided into four categories:\n\nWorld – Maps of the world, and of areas of the eastern hemisphere: Africa, Europe, Asia, Australia, and Antarctica.\n\nNew World – Maps of the western hemisphere: North and South America, including Central America and the West Indies.\n\nU.S. and the Americas – Maps of North America after 1776.\n\nAlabama – Maps of Alabama and the surrounding area, including as part of Georgia Territory and Mississippi Territory.\n\nA list is presented below, with call number and, in the case of the World Maps, a description of its scope. To view any of these maps, request them by title and call number in the Hoole Library reading room.\n\nHoole Library has hundreds more maps, especially of Alabama and the southeast U.S. Like these rare maps, they can be found in a search of the library catalog and viewed in the reading room upon request.\n\nMany of these and other rare maps can be found online in our Digital Collections, in Historical Maps. Titles linked below go to those digitized items.\n\nWorld\n\nOverview\n\nThough attempts at a world map date back to ancient Greece and Rome and maps of the world as it was known appear throughout the middle ages, the first maps that look like the world as we know it appear in the 16th century. They came from a school of Dutch and Flemish cartographers working in Leuven, Antwerp, and Amsterdam, then all part of the Netherlands. Those for which we have examples include the following:\n\nGerardus Mercator (1512-1594)\n\nAbraham Ortelius (1527-1598)\n\nJodocus Hondius (1563-1612)\n\nWillem Janszoon Blaeu (1571-1638)\n\nPeter Kaerius (1571-1646)\n\nIsaac Abrahamszoon Massa (1586-1643)\n\nClaes Janszoon Visscher (1587-1652)\n\nJohannes Janssonius (1588-1664)\n\nHendrik Hondius (1573-1650)\n\nJoan Blaeu (1596-1673)\n\nFrederik de Wit (1629/30-1760)\n\nEuropean mapmaking was not, however, confined to the Dutch. French cartographers in our collection include Sébastien Pontault de Beaulieu (1612-1674), Guillaume Delisle (1675-1726), and Jean Baptiste Bourguignon d’Anville (1697-1782). Other prominent cartographers represented here are Llwyd Humphrey (1527-1568) of Wales, Johannes Michael Gigas (1582-1637) of the Holy Roman Empire (German), Vincenzo Coronelli (1650-1718) of Venice (Italian), Herman Moll (1654-1732) in England (Dutch), Timothy Pont (1565-1614) of Scotland, and John Senex (1678-1740) of England.\n\nList\n\nPresented chronologically by region.\n\nWorld\n\nOrtelius, Abraham, and Frans Hogenberg (engraver).

However, as these outsiders were the creators of the modern maps being discussed here, in this context our interest is in seeing these territories primarily as colonial and post-colonial possessions.\n\nMaps of the New World show the spread of European colonial interests in the eastern hemisphere, including major players like Spain, Great Britain, Portugal, France, and the Netherlands.\n\nNorth America was extensively colonized by Great Britain, France, and Spain.\n\nBritain held much of the east coast of North America, from Georgia in the south to Newfoundland in the north, and the Hudson Bay Company held much of Canada west of the St. Lawrence Valley as Rupert’s Land. The earliest colonies were Roanoke (1580s) and Jamestown (1600s). The last British possession was Canada, which gained it independence in 1867.\n\nSpain held much of North America west of the Mississippi, a territory stretching from southern Mexico to Alaska called the Viceroyalty of New Spain (1521-1821), as well as Florida. Spanish Louisiana, the area that would later become the Louisiana Purchase, was ceded to the French in 1800. Mexico gained its independence in 1821, and it split Las Californias with Spain, Alta California being U.S. territory west of the Louisiana Purchase and Baja California being a province of Mexico.\n\nFrance for a time held a stretch of North America from the Gulf coast to the Hudson Bay. Called New France, its provinces were Canada, which encompassed modern Quebec and Ontario but stretched as far west as modern Saskatchewan; and French Louisiana (La Louisiane française), which consisted of Upper Louisiana (la Haute-Louisiane) and Lower Louisiana (la Basse-Louisiane). It ceded Canada to Britain in the 18th century and most of Louisiana to the United States in 1803.\n\nCentral America — modern day Belize, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Panama — was largely colonized by Spain, with the exception of Belize, which was once known as British Honduras.\n\nEven after the heyday of colonization, many European powers had and still have a foothold in the region by way of Caribbean and Atlantic possessions, an area long referred to as the West Indies. While each of these territories and countries has its own unique culture and place in the world, finding and understanding maps about these areas is only possible if one knows the colonial powers involved — those who made the maps and whose colonization still determines much about local place names. Islands in bold still belong to the European power with which they’re listed.\n\nThe British West Indies included territories in the Lucayan Archipelago: the Bahamas and the Turks and Caicos Islands; islands in the Greater Antilles: the Cayman Islands and Jamaica; and islands in the Lesser Antilles: the British Virgin Islands (once Las Vírgenes), Anguilla, Antigua and Barbuda, Saint Kitts (once San Cristóbal, alternatively Saint Christopher) and Nevis (once Nuestra Señora de las Nieves), Dominica, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Grenada, Trinidad and Tobago, and Barbados.\n\nThe French West Indies, not including territories only held by France briefly, included Haiti (then Saint-Domingue) and territories in the Lesser Antilles: Guadeloupe, Martinique, Saint Martin, and Saint Barthélemy (once San Bartolomeo, alternatively Saint Barts).\n\nThe Spanish West Indies included territories in the Greater Antilles: Cuba, the Dominican Republic (then Santo Domingo), and Puerto Rico (once San Juan Bautista).\n\nThe Dutch West Indies included territories in the Lesser Antilles: Sint Maarten, Aruba, Bonaire, and Curaçao.\n\nThe Danish West Indies included what is now the U.S. Virgin Islands, in the Lesser Antilles.\n\nSouth America was colonized heavily by the Spanish and Portuguese, in addition to other powers. Much of the continent was independent from Europe by the 1830s.\n\nBrazil was first colonized by the Portuguese in the early 16th century. At first, it only encompassed the far eastern tip of the continent, having gained the territory in the 1494 Treaty of Tordesillas, which divided Castilian (Spanish) possessions from Portuguese. From 1630 to 1654, the Dutch held part of northern Brazil as New Holland. In the early 18th century, the Portuguese expanded their territory, and in 1775 its three large colonies were united into one under the name Brazil.\n\nThe Viceroyalty of Peru (1542-1824), a Spanish possession, once covered much of South America. By 1776, it had been largely carved up and given to other administrative units or lost territory to Portuguese Brazil; it was confined to the north west and far west coast, modern Peru and Chile, with portions of adjacent countries.\n\nThe Viceroyalty of New Granada (1717), a Spanish possession in the north of the continent, once encompassed modern Colombia, Ecuador, Panama, and Venezuela.\n\nThe Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata (1776-1814), a Spanish possession in the south and east of the continent, encompassed modern Argentina, Bolivia, Paraguay, and Uruguay.\n\nList\n\nPresented chronologically by region.\n\nWestern Hemisphere\n\nOrtelius, Abraham.

To trace those maps, it’s helpful to know who possessed the territory — or, more accurately, the various parts of it.\n\nThe lower third of the future state (south of modern Montgomery but not including the Gulf coast) was sparsely settled until the late 18th century. It formed part of the new Mississippi Territory in 1798.\n\nThe upper portion of state, known as the Yazoo lands, was part of British Province of Georgia and subsequently the State of Georgia (1767-1804). It joined the Mississippi Territory in 1804.\n\nCoastal Alabama (modern Baldwin and Mobile counties) was part of French Lower Louisiana (1702-1763), British West Florida (1763-1783), Spanish West Florida (1783-1810), and the short-lived independent Republic of West Florida (1810-1812). Because of the Louisiana Purchase, it was annexed to the Mississippi Territory in 1812; however, control of that area was disputed with Spain until 1819, when all of Florida was ceded to the U.S. (taking effect in 1821).\n\nAlabama Territory split from the new state of Mississippi in 1817.\n\nAlabama was admitted to statehood in 1819.\n\nOur early Alabama maps cover much of this territorial background, and they also highlight important aspects of the state’s history, including the Native American tribes native to the area and subsequent wars with some of these tribes. They also show the political, administrative, and economic changes that came to the early state. Several cities served as the territorial or state capital, their locations showing a tug of war between regional interests: St. Stephens (1817-1819) was in the southwest, about 60 miles north of Mobile; Huntsville (1819-1820) is in the north, about 20 miles south of the border with Tennessee; and subsequent capitals were nearer the center: Cahaba (1820-1825), near Selma; Tuscaloosa (1826-1846); and Montgomery (1846-present).\n\nList\n\nPresented chronologically.\n\nA correct map of the Georgia Western territory. 1798.\n\nCall Number: G3920 1798 .P6x\n\nPeel & Sannoner (firm), and John Ralph Gardiner.
