        "text": "People\n\nFirst Loyalists Arrive\n\nThe first United Empire Loyalists — 1,124 refugees from New England — arrived in Halifax, NS. Another 40,000 or so followed them to NS and to Québec. The immigration resulted in the formation of New Brunswick and Upper Canada.\n\nGovernment and Politics\n\nTreaty of Paris 1783\n\nThis treaty ended the American Revolution, recognizing the independence of the American colonies. The boundary between British and American territories was set along the St. Lawrence River and through the Great Lakes. Post-war life in the United States was very difficult for British Loyalists, who endured property loss and discrimination. Many left and began to arrive in Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Québec and Ontario. Famous migrant Loyalists include Lieutenant James Moody, Laura Secord and Richard Pierpoint.\n\nGovernment and Politics\n\nBirth of Charles Fisher\n\nPolitician and lawyer Charles Fisher was born in Fredericton, New Brunswick. Fisher was the first premier of New Brunswick and a Father of Confederation. After Confederation, Fisher served one year in Parliament before leaving to join New Brunswick’s Supreme Court.\n\nPeople\n\nWinter march of the 104th Regiment of Foot\n\nGovernor-in-Chief Sir George Prevost ordered the transfer of soldiers from the Atlantic region to the Canadas to help protect them from impending US attacks. Soldiers from New Brunswick began their snow-shoed march from Fredericton to Québec City, eventually reaching Kingston, Ontario. Some died of frostbite on the nearly six week journey.\n\nGovernment and Politics\n\nBirth of John Mercer Johnson\n\nJohn Mercer Johnson was born in Liverpool, England. He was first elected to the New Brunswick assembly in July 1850 as a liberal in favour of responsible government. Johnson was a consistent advocate of Confederation and was defeated in the first New Brunswick election centred on Confederation in 1865. He led the poll in the May 1866 vote that paved the way for the London Conference, which he attended in December.\n\nGovernment and Politics\n\nBirth of Sir Samuel Leonard Tilley\n\nSamuel Leonard Tilley was born in Gagetown, New Brunswick. A Father of Confederation, he attended every Confederation conference. New Brunswick was not wholly supportive of unification, which resulted in Tilley losing his seat in 1865. It is believed that he proposed the name “Dominion” for the new nation at the London Conference in 1866.\n\nGovernment and Politics\n\nBirth of Peter Mitchell\n\nPeter Mitchell, a Father of Confederation, was born in Newcastle, New Brunswick. Known for his communication skills and strong political ideals, Mitchell worked to find compromise with anti-Confederation groups in New Brunswick. Mitchell’s loyalty to the Confederation cause was rewarded with a Senate appointment in 1867.\n\nSports and Culture\n\nFirst Public Museum\n\nAbraham Gesner, a physician and geologist best known for inventing kerosene, opened Canada’s first public museum — which he called “Gesner's Museum of Natural History” — in Saint John, NB. He displayed wildlife specimens, rock and mineral samples, and a variety of artifacts. Although the museum wasn’t financially successful, its collection eventually became the basis of today’s respected New Brunswick Museum.\n\nResources and Environment\n\nWebster-Ashburton Treaty\n\nThe frontier between Canada and the US was defined by the Webster-Ashburton Treaty, which was signed by the US and Britain. The treaty also provided for the surveying, mapping and marking of the agreed NB-Maine boundary, and was completed in June 1847.\n\nGovernment and Politics\n\nNew Brunswick Women Disenfranchised\n\nOfficials in New Brunswick passed a law restricting the right to vote to men. Previously, the province’s 1795 electoral legislation had allowed “persons” meeting certain qualifications to vote. There is evidence that some women voted in New Brunswick prior to the 1843 legislation.\n\nPeople\n\nBirth of Andrew Bonar Law\n\nBritish Prime Minister Andrew Bonar Law, the only British prime minister born outside the UK, was born at Rexton, NB. As a boy, Bonar Law moved to Glasgow to live with wealthy relatives. After a successful career as an iron merchant, Bonar Law moved into politics. He became prime minister in 1922 but served only 209 days. He resigned due to ill health and died six months later.\n\nSports and Culture\n\nCollège Saint-Joseph de Memramcook founded in NB\n\nFather Camille Lefebvre, member of the congregation of the Fathers of Sainte-Croix, founded the Collège Saint-Joseph in Memramcook, New Brunswick. The establishment of this institution was significant because the graduates quickly began to play active roles in the Acadian community and, with the help of the clergy, started questioning their own identity and asserting their aspirations as francophones in an anglophone environment. Collège Saint-Joseph was one of three colleges that merged in 1963 to become the Université de Moncton.\n\nGovernment and Politics\n\nLondon Conference\n\nSixteen delegates from the Province of Canada, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick met with the British government in London, England. During the three month conference, delegates reviewed the Québec Resolutions — creating a document that would form the basis of the British North America Act — chose \"Canada\" as the name of the new country and designated it a Dominion.\n\nGovernment and Politics\n\nBritish North America Act\n\nThe British North America Act was passed by the British Parliament and given royal assent by Queen Victoria on 29 March. It came into effect on 1 July. The Act joined the colonies of Canada, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick in one federal union. In 1949, Newfoundland becomes Canada’s newest province. In 1999, Nunavut becomes Canada’s newest territory. Its creation establishes self-governance for the region’s Inuit population.\n\nGovernment and Politics\n\nDeath of John Mercer Johnson\n\nJohn Mercer Johnson, a Father of Confederation, died in Chatham, New Brunswick. Johnson was as an active yet controversial participant in New Brunswick politics. Applauded for his rhetoric, Johnson was dogged by his lack of organizational ability. Johnson supported John A. Macdonald’s vision of Confederation and became a Member of Parliament in 1867.\n\nDisasters\n\nSaxby Gale Hits Bay of Fundy\n\nThe Saxby Gale, a hurricane in the Bay of Fundy that coincided with an unusually high tide, caused extensive damage along the coasts of New Brunswick and Nova Scotia. It flooded rivers and farmland, destroyed sections of railway, and caused over a hundred deaths. The cyclone may also have caused the formation of the isthmus that connects Partridge Island, NS, to the province’s mainland.\n\nSports and Culture\n\nThe Red Ensign in Canada\n\nSoon after Confederation, Canadians began flying the Red Ensign with the quartered arms of Ontario, Québec, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick in the fly. As provinces joined Confederation, the arms of Canada increased in detail. By 1921 nine provinces had joined Confederation, and the shield was difficult to recognize, especially at sea.\n\nSports and Culture\n\nNew Brunswick Schools\n\nThe New Brunswick government passed the Common Schools Act to strengthen and reform the school system. At the same time, it abandoned an informal system of separate schools that had grown up since the 1850s.\n\nGovernment and Politics\n\nDeath of William Henry Steeves\n\nFather of Confederation William Henry Steeves died in Saint John, New Brunswick. A prominent businessman, Steeves turned to politics in the 1840s and supported reform during a turbulent period in New Brunswick history. After Confederation and his appointment to the Senate, Steeves became an advocate for persons with mental illnesses\n\nGovernment and Politics\n\nDeath of Charles Fisher\n\nCharles Fisher, a Father of Confederation, died in Fredericton, New Brunswick. The first premier of New Brunswick, Fisher advocated for responsible government, educational improvements and Confederation. Fisher had his share of troubles. As premier, his prohibition laws faced opposition, and he was ousted in 1861 over a lands scandal.\n\nCommunication and Transportation\n\nThe Marco Polo Runs Aground\n\nThe famously fast clipper Marco Polo, which had been launched 32 years earlier from Saint John, NB, ran aground on the coast of Prince Edward Island. Local residents rescued the crew. Among the spectators was a young Lucy Maud Montgomery, who would publish her first newspaper article, “The Wreck of the Marco Polo,” eight years later.\n\nPeople\n\nNew Brunswick Women’s Enfranchisement Association Founded\n\nThe New Brunswick Women’s Enfranchisement Association was established in Saint John. It emerged from a small society seeking to become a branch of the Dominion Women’s Enfranchisement Association. Wanting to form connections outside the region, the WEA voted to send a member to the National Council of Women convention in Ottawa.\n\nPeople\n\nSaint John Hosts Association for the Advancement of Women Convention\n\nThe Association for the Advancement of Women, an American women’s rights organization, held its convention in Saint John. In an ironic twist, noted American suffragist Julia Ward Howe stayed at the home of NB Chief Justice William Tuck, who didn’t believe women should be permitted in the public sphere.\n\nGovernment and Politics\n\nBirth of Gilbert Finn\n\nBorn in Inkerman Ferry, NB, Gilbert Finn is an Acadian businessman. After working 37 years at the Assumption Mutual Life Assurance Co, he served on the Atlantic Provinces Economic Council and the Economic Council of Canada, was president of the Université de Moncton and was active in Acadian and New Brunswick community groups. His service to his people and province was rewarded with membership in the Order of Canada. Upon his retirement in 1987 he was appointed lieutenant-governor of New Brunswick, the second person of Acadian descent to be so honoured. He served in this capacity until 1994.\n\nGovernment and Politics\n\nPeter John Veniot becomes NB premier\n\nBorn in Richibucto, NB, Peter John Veniot, \"Pierre,\" was the first Acadian NB premier and served from 1923 to 1925. He succeeded W.E. Foster as premier in 1923 and supported public ownership of the provincial hydro system and the Maritime Rights Movement. He was recognized as the leader of Acadian Liberalism. Following the defeat of his party in 1925, he ran successfully as MP for Gloucester and was appointed postmaster general by Prime Minister W.L. Mackenzie King. He sat as an MP until his death in 1936.\n\nIndigenous Peoples\n\nFirst Nations Win Right to Vote Provincially\n\nExcept in Nova Scotia and Newfoundland, Status Indians had been barred from voting provincially. Beginning with British Columbia in 1949 and ending with Quebec in 1969, First Nations peoples gradually win the right to vote in provincial elections without losing status or treaty rights.\n\nGovernment and Politics\n\nLouis J. Robichaud becomes premier of NB\n\nElected leader of the NB Liberal Party in 1958, Louis Joseph Robichaud led it to victory over Hugh J. Flemming in 1960, served as attorney general between 1960 and 1965, and as minister of youth in 1968. The first Acadian elected premier of NB, he introduced far-reaching social reforms through the centralizing Programme of Equal Opportunity. His government passed an Official Languages Act, established Université de Moncton, increased Acadian administrative influence, and encouraged the mining and forestry industries.\n\nSports and Culture\n\nUniversité de Moncton is founded\n\nUniversité de Moncton was founded by the New Brunswick legislature in accordance with the recommendations of a royal commission. Université de Moncton began with the amalgamation of three institutions which agreed to suspend their charters in order to become affiliated colleges: Saint-Joseph (founded 1864), Sacré-Coeur (1899) and Saint-Louis (1946). As amended in 1977, the university's charter authorized campuses in each of New Brunswick's three francophone regions: Moncton, Edmundston and Shippagan.\n\nResources and Environment\n\n​Kouchibouguac National Park Established\n\nKouchibouguac National Park was established. Situated on the eastern New Brunswick shore of Northumberland Strait, the park is a delicate blend of beaches, sand dunes and salt marshes. A 25 km long barrier-island system shelters lagoons from the often violent sea. Several rivers flowing across the park inspired its Mi'kmaq name \"river of the long tides.\"\n\nGovernment and Politics Sports and Culture\n\nHerménégilde Chiasson is installed as New Brunswick's lieutenant-governor\n\nHerménégilde Chiasson was born 7 April 1946 in Saint-Simon, NB. He is an artist, poet, playwright, film director and lieutenant-governor of New Brunswick. An Officer of the Order of Canada, winner of the Governor General’s Literary Award, and New Brunswick's 29th lieutenant-governor, Chiasson is considered the father of Acadian modernism and is one of Canada's foremost advocates of Acadian culture and the arts. He is also notable for his insistence upon Acadian culture being a living culture rather than a persecuted and exiled one.\n\nSports and Culture\n\nFrance Daigle wins the Governor General’s Literary Award\n\nFrance Daigle, an Acadian author born 18 November 1953 in Dieppe, a suburb of Moncton, New Brunswick, is the leading representative of postmodern Acadian literature. Her work has sparked a great deal of interest in Québec, English Canada, and other parts of the Francophonie. She won the Governor General’s Literary Award for her masterpiece entitled Pour sûr (2011).\n\nDisasters\n\nMoncton Shootings\n\nJustin Bourque shot five RCMP officers in Moncton, NB, killing three and injuring two. A 28-hour manhunt ensued, during which time Moncton’s New North End neighbourhood was placed in lockdown. Bourque was found and taken into custody on 6 June.\n\nPeople\n\nNew Brunswick Morgentaler Clinic Closes\n\nThe Morgentaler Clinic in Fredericton, NB, closed. New Brunswick was the only province with a private abortion clinic that did not receive provincial funding for the procedure. As such, the clinic could not afford to continue performing abortions.\n\nGovernment and Politics\n\nBrian Gallant elected premier of New Brunswick\n\nBrian Alexander Gallant was born 27 April 1982 in the Acadian community of Shediac Bridge, New Brunswick. He was a lawyer and leader of the New Brunswick Liberal Party. At 32 years of age, he became the country’s youngest premier. Gallant is the son of Pierre Gallant, who is of Acadian heritage, and Marilyn Scholten, the daughter of Dutch immigrants.\n\nSports and Culture\n\nMatt Stairs Inducted Into Baseball Hall of Fame\n\nFormer Major League Baseball player Matt Stairs, of Fredericton, NB, was inducted into the Canadian Baseball Hall of Fame. A 19-year veteran of the big leagues, Stairs holds the records for most pinch-hit home runs (23) and the most teams played for by a position player (13).\n\nResources and Environment\n\nEnergy East Pipeline Project Cancelled\n\nTransCanada announced that it had cancelled plans to build the Energy East pipeline, which would have carried crude oil from Alberta and Saskatchewan to refineries in Québec and New Brunswick. From there, oil would have been exported to other countries. The company cited changing market conditions and delays in assessments carried out by the National Energy Board as reasons for its decision. The project’s supporters, including premiers Rachel Notley and Brad Wall, expressed disappointment and criticized the federal government’s approach to the review process. Energy East’s opponents, including municipalities in Québec and Indigenous communities along the proposed path of the pipeline, hailed it as a victory."
