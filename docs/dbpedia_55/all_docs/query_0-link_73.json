        "text": "For in vivo analysis, we subsequently focused on the VWF/p.S1494C-p.S1534C double mutant (mVWF/p.S1494C-A1534C for murine VWF), as the single mutations display behavior similar to VWF/WT in the in vitro assays. VWF/WT and the double mutant were expressed via hydrodynamic gene transfer in VWF-deficient mice. Blood samples were collected 4 and 7 days after injection and analyzed for VWF antigen, platelet counts, and multimeric pattern.\n\nIn accordance with our previous in vivo studies involving hydrodynamic injection-mediated expression of VWF, mice were included expressing VWF antigen levels between 300% and 1000%.16,19,20 At both 4 and 7 days after injection, antigen levels were similar for mVWF/WT and mVWF/p.S1494C-p.A1534C. At day 4, antigen levels were 688 ± 208% (mean ± standard deviation [SD]; n = 6) and 697 ± 302% (n = 7; unpaired Student t test: P > .05) for mVWF/WT and mVWF/p.S1494C-p.A1534C, respectively. At day 7, antigen levels were 553 ± 234% (n = 6) and 660 ± 212% (n = 7; P > .05) for mVWF/WT and mVWF/p.S1494C-p.A1534C, respectively.\n\nMultimer analysis revealed that for mVWF/WT, the full range of multimers was present both at day 4 and day 7 (Figure 4A). A more extended range of multimers was present for mice expressing mutant mVWF/p.S1494C-p.A1534C at both day 4 and day 7. Interestingly, the ratio high molecular weight (11-20 bands)/low molecular weight (1-5 bands) multimers was increased for mutant VWF (0.09 ± 0.04) compared with VWF/WT (0.03 ± 0.02): bands representing dimers and tetramers were more intense for VWF/WT compared with mutant VWF. This increased ratio seems compatible with the presence of VWF that is resistant against proteolytic degradation.\n\nInterestingly, Coulter platelet counts were significantly different between mVWF/WT and mVWF/p.S1494C-p.A1534C at both day 4 and day 7 after injection (Figure 4B). At day 4, platelet counts were 715 ± 107 (mean ± SD; n = 6) and 373 ± 339 (n = 7; P = .0397) for mVWF/WT and mVWF/p.S1494C-p.A1534C, respectively. At day 7, platelet counts were 841 ± 131 (n = 6) and 369 ± 277 (n = 7; 0.0028) for mVWF/WT and mVWF/p.S1494C-p.A1534C, respectively. At both time points, none of the mVWF/WT-expressing mice displayed platelet counts below 600, whereas 5 of 7 (Fisher's exact test: P = .02) and 6 of 7 (P = .005) mice for mVWF/p.S1494C-p.A1534C displayed platelet counts below 450 at days 4 and 7, respectively (Figure 4B).\n\nThese findings show that platelet depletion keeps on occurring in the days that follow the early onset of thrombocytopenia. Giemsa staining of blood smears taken from both mouse groups confirmed that animals expressing VWF/WT have normal platelet and red cell numbers (Figure 4C). Blood smears from mice expressing the double mutant, on the other hand, reveal multiple anomalies. These blood films have fewer red cells, very few platelets, and present with occasional platelet microaggregates and schistocytes (Figure 4C). Interestingly, the extent of the thrombocytopenia seen in these animals was found to vary with the nature of the assay used to assess platelet number, with size-based particle counting of plasma samples (Figure 4B) yielding higher platelet counts than GIEMSA-stained smeared blood samples (Figure 4C). This discrepancy is probably due to the presence of schistocytes in the blood of these animals; red cell fragments being indistinguishable from platelets in the Coulter particle counter, they may cause platelet numbers to be overestimated.\n\nOverall, these studies show that expression of mVWF/p.S1494C-p.A1534C in mice is associated with a range of blood disorders that are considered hallmarks of TTP in humans.\n\nThe aim of this study was the creation of a mouse model that mimics the clinical features of TTP. To achieve that goal, VWF mutants exhibiting various cysteine substitutions were created. Our hypothesis was that if some of the mutants were able to form disulfide bonds within the A2 domain, they would become resilient to deformation by flow forces and proteolysis by plasma proteases. A novel cell-based flow model was created with the intent of testing these VWF mutants in a context as physiologically relevant as possible. As reported elsewhere,21 HEK293T cells have the ability to synthetize, package, and secrete VWF in the form of long multimers (strings). In an attempt to further improve on that model, we created the HA-HRH1 HEK293T cell line that stably expresses the human histamine receptor 1. Histamine treatment of these cells was found to result in cell surface exposure of secreted VWF multimers in structures resembling the VWF dots seen in endothelial cells.17 To trigger the unfurling of these VWF multimers, a novel in vitro cell flow system was designed. In this model, HA-HRH1 HEK293T cells are grown in poly-l-lysine-coated flow chambers and subjected to high shear flow forces 2 to 3 days after transfection. Flow analysis is performed 2 times. Cells are first exposed to a plasma-free blood cell suspension to allow the detection of UL-VWF multimers in the flow chamber in the absence of protease. Once platelet-decorated UL-VWF multimers have been identified, whole blood is injected into the flow chamber to assess the thrombogenic potential and protease susceptibility of each VWF mutant. Exposure of HEK293T cells to high shear rates revealed that cell surface-tethered VWF strings can support the formation of large platelet aggregates. In agreement with previous work by Nishio et al that showed that binding of platelet receptor GpIbα to the A1 domain of VWF facilitates A2 cleavage by ADAMTS13,13 severance of VWF/WT, VWF/p.S1494C, and VWF/p.S1534C strings was only seen after platelet binding had occurred. VWF mutants bearing the p.S1494C-p.S1534C double substitution were found to be resilient to cleavage by plasma proteases under flow and were highly thrombogenic.\n\nAnalysis of recombinant A2 domains confirmed that the p.S1494C-p.S1534C mutation was conducive to the formation of a novel internal disulfide bond and that chemical reduction of this bond was required for A2/p.S1494C-p.S1534C cleavage. A Cys1494 to Cys1534 covalent bond would, in theory, prevent the dissociation of the β1 and α1 A2 subdomains. Because the cleavage site for ADAMTS13 is located on the β4-strand,22 a structurally constrained β1 would, in theory, prevent access to adjacent β4 binding sites (Figure 3A). Whether these mutations prevent protease recruitment to VWF all together or cause a misalignment of the enzymes catalytic domains with important A2 residues remains to be determined. In the case of ADAMTS13, binding sites have been identified inside and outside the A2 domain.23 One such site includes Leu1603, located on the β4-strand. Mutation of Leu1603 was reported to block ADAMTS13 cleavage of VWF but not their association.24 It is therefore conceivable that a β4-strand-proximal steric hindrance due to the Cys1494-Cys1534 bond would primarily affect cleavage rather than binding of the protease. Another possible mechanism through which the p.S1494C-p.S1534C double mutation may confer cleavage resistance to VWF might involve the A2 Ca2+ binding site identified by Zhou et al in their alternate A2 domain crystal structure. The resolved structure published by this group shows that 2 of the 4 residues forming this Ca2+ binding site are located on the β1 and β4 strands of A2.25 It is therefore conceivable that a structurally constrained β1 would reinforce the stabilizing action Ca2+ has on the A2 domain, thereby preventing its unfolding under shear. Follow-up studies will have to be undertaken to further address these issues.\n\nIn acute acquired TTP patients, symptoms are triggered by widespread thrombosis due to the presence of large uncleaved VWF multimers in the circulation. As a result, patients initially present with thrombocytopenia, VWF-rich platelet aggregates, and schistocytes (due to the mechanical fragmentation of erythrocytes in partially occluded vessels). As the disease progresses, they may present with enlarged spleens (splenomegaly), neurological impairment (∼65% of patients), kidney dysfunction, and heart failure. Vectors encoding mVWF/WT and mVWF/p.S1494C-p.A1534C were injected into mice by hydrodynamic injection to assess their ability to elicit TTP-like symptoms in VWF-null mice. Within 4 days of the injection, WT and mutant VWF multimers could be detected in the plasma of these mice at levels comparable to normal C57Bl/6 VWF plasma levels and up to 10 times higher.\n\nThe presence of small-size VWF multimers in the plasma of mVWF/p.S1494C-p.A1534C-expressing animals suggests that proteases other than ADAMTS13 can take on the processing of VWF, an observation that echoes previous findings by other groups.6,7,26 A number of candidate proteases capable of cleaving VWF have been identified, such as cytotoxic lymphocyte T cell- and natural killer cell-secreted granzyme B and M,27,28 leukocyte-derived cathepsin G, elastase, matrix metalloproteinase 9, and plasmin.22,29 Although elastase, matrix metalloproteinase, and cathepsin G have been shown to have either identical or proximal cleavage sites to ADAMTS13, plasmin and granzyme B and M appear to cleave VWF at more distant sites. The relevance of alternative proteases in regulating VWF multimer size has recently been demonstrated in an elegant study by Tersteeg et al,30 revealing that plasmin can function as a backup system in the absence of ADAMTS13. For the present study, we have not yet tested other proteases with regard to the ADAMTS13-resistant double mutant. However, given the notion that leukocyte-derived proteases cleave VWF within the similar A2 domain region as ADAMTS13, we anticipate that the double mutant will be resistant against proteolysis by these proteases as well. This issue will be subject of investigation in future studies by our group.\n\nInterestingly, mVWF/p.S1494C-p.A1534C was found to preferentially form higher-molecular-weight multimers, whereas lower-molecular-size multimers were observed for mVWF/WT. Even at day 7, mice expressing mutant mVWF did have HMW multimers, despite the presence of strongly reduced platelet counts (<300 × 103/µL). Previously, it has been reported that there is a frequent loss of HMW multimers with acute TTP,31 a phenomenon that is not reproduced in our mouse model. One explanation for this apparent discordance could be that the amount of HMW-VWF that is consumed into VWF-platelet aggregates is relatively small compared with the amount of circulating VWF and hence escapes detection via multimeric analysis.\n\nUnlike UL-VWF multimers which are partially in an active, platelet-binding conformation, mVWF/p.S1494C-p.A1534C multimers proved similar to VWF/WT in binding to nanobody AU-VWFa-11, which specifically detects the active conformation present in UL-VWF or VWD-type 2B.12 This indicates that the double mutant lacks the intrinsic potential to spontaneously interact with platelets. To explain its higher platelet binding potential in the circulation and in the in vitro perfusion assays, we can but speculate at this moment. It is known that the A2 domain plays a role in the exposure of the platelet-binding A1 domain.32 In globular VWF, the A2 domain is in close proximity to the A1 domain, interfering with platelet access to the A1 domain. Under elevated shear stress conditions, the A2 moves away from the A1 domain, allowing platelet binding. We anticipate that the increased disulfide bridge-induced rigidity of the A2 domain promotes its moving away from the A1 domain even under low shear stress conditions. This increased platelet binding potential cannot be counteracted via ADAMTS13-mediated proteolysis. Apparently, the combination of both ADAMTS13 resistance and more shear stress-sensitive exposure of the platelet-binding site contribute to the thrombogenicity of the mutant. In any case, mice expressing murine VWF/p.S1494C-p.A1534C were found to develop symptoms very similar to the ones seen in TTP patients: presence of VWF-rich platelet aggregates in the vasculature, thrombocytopenia, red cell fragmentation, renopathy, and occasional splenomegaly. Neurological and cardiac impairments were not assessed in those animals but may be occurring as well.\n\nIn conclusion, we developed a novel model of microangiopathic disease that accurately mimics TTP symptoms and that can be used for various further investigations. First, it provides an alternative approach to existing chemically, mechanically, or heat-induced in vivo thrombosis models,15,33,34 allowing it to study the role of continuous platelet aggregation in the context of thrombosis and hemostasis. Furthermore, this system is based on interactions between VWF and its platelet receptor GpIb and could therefore be used as an in vivo model to study molecular events responsible for the transition of rolling platelets into fully active, firmly adherent platelets. Also from the perspective of our understanding of thrombotic microangiopathies (TMAs), our model could be of relevance. TMA is generally defined as a combination of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and microvascular thrombosis. The initial therapy for all TMAs is plasma exchange, an expensive, cumbersome procedure with such potential side effects as infection, cardiac arrest, venous thrombosis, or hypotension. Although we realize that our model is ill-suited for the study of ADAMTS13-based TTP therapies, it provides several other advantages. It could be useful for preclinical testing of therapies capable of disrupting VWF-platelet interactions, conceptually similar to ALX0081 and ARC15105 that have been tested in a clinical setting for the treatment and prevention of acute and chronic TMA. Finally, our model provides a platform to investigate effects secondary to the occlusion of vessels by VWF/platelet aggregates, in particular, organ damage, neuronal aberrations, and schistocyte formation. Thus, our model could be helpful in further delineating thrombotic processes and their secondary effects, as well as in the development of novel therapeutic strategies in the treatment of TMA."
