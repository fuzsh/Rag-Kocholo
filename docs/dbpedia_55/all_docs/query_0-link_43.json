        "text": "Top 10 Take-Home Messages\n\n1.\n\nHigh-quality cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is the foundation of resuscitation. New data reaffirm the key components of high-quality CPR: providing adequate chest compression rate and depth, minimizing interruptions in CPR, allowing full chest recoil between compressions, and avoiding excessive ventilation.\n\n2.\n\nA respiratory rate of 20 to 30 breaths per minute is new for infants and children who are (a) receiving CPR with an advanced airway in place or (b) receiving rescue breathing and have a pulse.\n\n3.\n\nFor patients with nonshockable rhythms, the earlier epinephrine is administered after CPR initiation, the more likely the patient is to survive.\n\n4.\n\nUsing a cuffed endotracheal tube decreases the need for endotracheal tube changes.\n\n5.\n\nThe routine use of cricoid pressure does not reduce the risk of regurgitation during bag-mask ventilation and may impede intubation success.\n\n6.\n\nFor out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, bag-mask ventilation results in the same resuscitation outcomes as advanced airway interventions such as endotracheal intubation.\n\n7.\n\nResuscitation does not end with return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC). Excellent post–cardiac arrest care is critically important to achieving the best patient outcomes. For children who do not regain consciousness after ROSC, this care includes targeted temperature management and continuous electroencephalography monitoring. The prevention and/or treatment of hypotension, hyperoxia or hypoxia, and hypercapnia or hypocapnia is important.\n\n8.\n\nAfter discharge from the hospital, cardiac arrest survivors can have physical, cognitive, and emotional challenges and may need ongoing therapies and interventions.\n\n9.\n\nNaloxone can reverse respiratory arrest due to opioid overdose, but there is no evidence that it benefits patients in cardiac arrest.\n\n10.\n\nFluid resuscitation in sepsis is based on patient response and requires frequent reassessment. Balanced crystalloid, unbalanced crystalloid, and colloid fluids are all acceptable for sepsis resuscitation. Epinephrine or norepinephrine infusions are used for fluid-refractory septic shock.\n\nPreamble\n\nMore than 20 000 infants and children have a cardiac arrest per year in the United States.1–4 In 2015, emergency medical service–documented out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) occurred in more than 7000 infants and children.4 Approximately 11.4% of pediatric OHCA patients survived to hospital discharge, but outcomes varied by age, with survival rates of 17.1% in adolescents, 13.2% in children, and 4.9% in infants. In the same year, pediatric in-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) incidence was 12.66 events per 1000 infant and child hospital admissions, with an overall survival to hospital discharge rate of 41.1%.4 Neurological outcomes remain difficult to assess across the pediatric age spectrum, with variability in reporting metrics and time to follow-up across studies of both OHCA and IHCA. Favorable neurological outcome has been reported in up to 47% of survivors to discharge.5 Despite increases in survival from IHCA, there is more to be done to improve both survival and neurological outcomes.6\n\nThe International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation (ILCOR) Formula for Survival emphasizes 3 essential components for good resuscitation outcomes: guidelines based on sound resuscitation science, effective education of the lay public and resuscitation providers, and implementation of a well-functioning Chain of Survival.7\n\nThese guidelines contain recommendations for pediatric basic and advanced life support, excluding the newborn period, and are based on the best available resuscitation science. The Chain of Survival (Section 2), which is now expanded to include recovery from cardiac arrest, requires coordinated efforts from medical professionals in a variety of disciplines and, in the case of OHCA, from bystanders, emergency dispatchers, and first responders. In addition, specific recommendations about the training of resuscitation providers are provided in Part 6: Resuscitation Education Science, and recommendations about systems of care are provided in Part 7.\n\nIntroduction\n\nScope of Guidelines\n\nThese guidelines are intended to be a resource for lay rescuers and healthcare providers to identify and treat infants and children in the prearrest, intra-arrest, and postarrest states. These apply to infants and children in multiple settings; the community, prehospital, and the hospital environment. Prearrest, intra-arrest, and postarrest topics are reviewed, including cardiac arrest in special circumstances, such as in patients with congenital heart disease.\n\nFor the purposes of the pediatric advanced life support guidelines, pediatric patients are infants, children, and adolescents up to 18 years of age, excluding newborns. For pediatric basic life support (BLS), guidelines apply as follows:\n\n•\n\nInfant guidelines apply to infants younger than approximately 1 year of age.\n\n•\n\nChild guidelines apply to children approximately 1 year of age until puberty. For teaching purposes, puberty is defined as breast development in females and the presence of axillary hair in males.\n\n•\n\nFor those with signs of puberty and beyond, adult basic life support guidelines should be followed.\n\nResuscitation of the neonate is addressed in “Part 5: Neonatal Resuscitation” and applies to the newborn typically only during the first hospitalization following birth. Pediatric basic and advanced life support guidelines apply to neonates (less than 30 days old) after hospital discharge.\n\nCoronavirus Disease 2019 Guidance\n\nTogether with other professional societies, the American Heart Association (AHA) has provided interim guidance for basic and advanced life support in adults, children, and neonates with suspected or confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Because evidence and guidance are evolving with the COVID-19 situation, this interim guidance is maintained separately from the emergency cardiovascular care (ECC) guidelines. Readers are directed to the AHA website for the most recent guidance.8\n\nOrganization of the Pediatric Writing Committee\n\nThe Pediatric Writing Group consisted of pediatric clinicians including intensivists, cardiac intensivists, cardiologists, emergency medicine physicians, medical toxicologists, and nurses. Volunteers with recognized expertise in resuscitation are nominated by the writing group chair and selected by the AHA ECC Committee. The AHA has rigorous conflict of interest policies and procedures to minimize the risk of bias or improper influence during development of the guidelines.9 Prior to appointment, writing group members and peer reviewers disclosed all commercial relationships and other potential (including intellectual) conflicts. Writing group members whose research led to changes in guidelines were required to declare those conflicts during discussions and abstain from voting on those specific recommendations. This process is described more fully in “Part 2: Evidence Evaluation and Guidelines Development.” Disclosure information for writing group members is listed in Appendix 1.\n\nMethodology and Evidence Review\n\nThese pediatric guidelines are based on the extensive evidence evaluation performed in conjunction with the ILCOR and affiliated ILCOR member councils. Three different types of evidence reviews (systematic reviews, scoping reviews, and evidence updates) were used in the 2020 process.10,11 After review by the ILCOR Science Advisory Committee Chair, the evidence update worksheets were included in Appendix C of the 2020 ILCOR Consensus on CPR and ECC Science With Treatment Recommendations.11a Each of these resulted in a description of the literature that facilitated guideline development. This process is described more fully in “Part 2: Evidence Evaluation and Guidelines Development.”12\n\nClass of Recommendation and Level of Evidence\n\nThe writing group reviewed all relevant and current AHA Guidelines for Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) and ECC and all relevant 2020 ILCOR Consensus on CPR and ECC Science With Treatment Recommendations evidence and recommendations to determine if current guidelines should be reaffirmed, revised, or retired or if new recommendations were needed. The writing group then drafted, reviewed, and approved recommendations, assigning to each a Class of Recommendation (COR; ie, strength) and Level of Evidence (LOE; ie, quality, certainty). Criteria for each COR and LOE are described in Table 1.\n\nGuideline Structure\n\nThe 2020 Guidelines are organized in discrete modules of information on specific topics or management issues.13 Each modular “knowledge chunk” includes a table of recommendations using standard AHA nomenclature of COR and LOE. Recommendations are presented in order of COR: most potential benefit (Class 1), followed by lesser certainty of benefit (Class 2), and finally potential for harm or no benefit (Class 3). Following the COR, recommendations are ordered by the certainty of supporting LOE: Level A (high-quality randomized controlled trials) to Level C-EO (expert opinion). This order does not reflect the order in which care should be provided.\n\nA brief introduction or short synopsis is provided to contextualize the recommendations with important background information and overarching management or treatment concepts. Recommendation-specific supportive text clarifies the rationale and key study data supporting the recommendations. When appropriate, flow diagrams or additional tables are included. Hyperlinked references are provided to facilitate quick access and review.\n\nDocument Review and Approval\n\nThe guideline was submitted for blinded peer review to 5 subject matter experts nominated by the AHA. Peer reviewer feedback was provided for guidelines in draft format and again in final format. The guideline was also reviewed and approved for publication by the AHA Science Advisory and Coordinating Committee and AHA Executive Committee. Disclosure information for peer reviewers is listed in Appendix 2.\n\nAbbreviations\n\nReferences\n\n1.\n\nHolmberg, MJ, Ross, CE, Fitzmaurice, GM, Chan, PS, Duval-Arnould, J, Grossestreuer, AV, Yankama, T, Donnino, MW, Andersen, LW; American Heart Association’s Get With The Guidelines–Resuscitation Investigators.

Cardiac arrest in infants and children does not usually result from a primary cardiac cause; rather, it is the end result of progressive respiratory failure or shock. In these patients, cardiac arrest is preceded by a variable period of deterioration, which eventually results in cardiopulmonary failure, bradycardia, and cardiac arrest. In children with congenital heart disease, cardiac arrest is often due to a primary cardiac cause, although the etiology is distinct from adults.\n\nOutcomes for pediatric IHCA have improved over the past 20 years, in part because of early recognition, high-quality CPR, postarrest care, and extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR).1,2 In a recent analysis of the Get With The Guidelines Resuscitation Registry, a large multicenter, hospital-based cardiac arrest registry, pediatric cardiac arrest survival to hospital discharge was 19% in 2000 and 38% in 2018.2 Survival has increased on average by 0.67% per year, though that increase has plateaued since 2010.2 New directions of research and therapy may be required to improve cardiac arrest survival. More cardiac arrest events now occur in an intensive care unit (ICU) setting, suggesting that patients at risk for cardiac arrest are being identified sooner and transferred to a higher level of care.3\n\nSurvival rates from OHCA remain less encouraging. In a recent analysis of the Resuscitation Outcomes Consortium Epidemiological Registry, a multicenter OHCA registry, annual survival to hospital discharge of pediatric OHCA between 2007 and 2012 ranged from 6.7% to 10.2% depending on region and patient age.4 There was no significant change in these rates over time, consistent with other national registries from Japan and from Australia and New Zealand.5,6 In the Resuscitation Outcomes Consortium Epidemiological Registry, survival of OHCA was higher in regions with more arrests that were witnessed by emergency medical services and with higher bystander CPR rates, stressing the importance of early recognition and treatment of these patients.4\n\nAs survival rates from pediatric cardiac arrest increase, there has been a shift with more focus on neurodevelopmental, physical, and emotional outcomes of survivors. Recent studies demonstrate that a quarter of patients with favorable outcomes have global cognitive impairment and that 85% of older children who were reported to have favorable outcomes have selective neuropsychological deficits.7\n\nThe Pediatric Chain of Survival\n\nHistorically, cardiac arrest care has largely focused on the management of the cardiac arrest itself, highlighting high-quality CPR, early defibrillation, and effective teamwork. However, there are aspects of prearrest and postarrest care that are critical to improve outcomes. As pediatric cardiac arrest survival rates have plateaued, the prevention of cardiac arrest becomes even more important. In the out-of-hospital environment, this includes safety initiatives (eg, bike helmet laws), sudden infant death syndrome prevention, lay rescuer CPR training, and early access to emergency care. When OHCA occurs, early bystander CPR is critical in improving outcomes. In the in-hospital environment, cardiac arrest prevention includes early recognition and treatment of patients at risk for cardiac arrest such as neonates undergoing cardiac surgical procedures, patients presenting with acute fulminant myocarditis, acute decompensated heart failure, or pulmonary hypertension.\n\nFollowing resuscitation from cardiac arrest, management of the post–cardiac arrest syndrome (which may include brain dysfunction, myocardial dysfunction with low cardiac output, and ischemia or reperfusion injury) is important to avoid known contributors to secondary injury, such as hypotension.8,9 Accurate neuroprognostication is important to guide caregiver discussions and decision-making. Finally, given the high risk of neurodevelopmental impairment in cardiac arrest survivors, early referral for rehabilitation assessment and intervention is key.\n\nTo highlight these different aspects of cardiac arrest management, the Pediatric Chain of Survival has been updated (Figure 1). A separate OHCA Chain of Survival has been created to distinguish the differences between OHCA and IHCA. In both the OHCA and IHCA chains, a sixth link has been added to stress the importance of recovery, which focuses on short- and long-term treatment evaluation, and support for survivors and their families. For both chains of survival, activating the emergency response is followed immediately by the initiation of high-quality CPR. If help is nearby or a cell phone is available, activating the emergency response and starting CPR can be nearly simultaneous. However, in the out-of-hospital setting, a single rescuer who does not have access to a cell phone should begin CPR (compressions-airway-breathing) for infants and children before calling for help because respiratory arrest is the most common cause of cardiac arrest and help may not be nearby. In the event of sudden witnessed collapse, rescuers should use an available automatic external defibrillator (AED), because early defibrillation can be lifesaving.\n\nReferences\n\n1.\n\nGirotra, S, Spertus, JA, Li, Y, Berg, RA, Nadkarni, VM, Chan, PS; American Heart Association Get With the Guidelines–Resuscitation Investigators.

Lay rescuers should not delay starting CPR in a child with no “signs of life.” Healthcare providers may consider assessing the presence of a pulse as long as the initiation of CPR is not delayed more than 10 seconds. Palpation for the presence or absence of a pulse is not reliable as the sole determinant of cardiac arrest and the need for chest compressions. In infants and children, asphyxial cardiac arrest is more common than cardiac arrest from a primary cardiac event; therefore, effective ventilation is important during resuscitation of children. When CPR is initiated, the sequence is compressions-airway-breathing.\n\nHigh-quality CPR generates blood flow to vital organs and increases the likelihood of return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC). The 5 main components of high-quality CPR are (1) adequate chest compression depth, (2) optimal chest compression rate, (3) minimizing interruptions in CPR (ie, maximizing chest compression fraction or the proportion of time that chest compressions are provided for cardiac arrest), (4) allowing full chest recoil between compressions, and (5) avoiding excessive ventilation. Compressions of inadequate depth and rate,1,2 incomplete chest recoil,3 and high ventilation rates4,5 are common during pediatric resuscitation.\n\nInitiation of CPR\n\nRecommendation-Specific Supportive Text\n\n1.\n\nLay rescuers are unable to reliably determine the presence or absence of a pulse.6–20\n\n2.\n\nNo clinical trials have compared manual pulse checks with observations of “signs of life.” However, adult and pediatric studies have identified a high error rate and harmful CPR pauses during manual pulse checks by trained rescuers.21–23 In 1 study, healthcare provider pulse palpation accuracy was 78%21 compared with lay rescuer pulse palpation accuracy of 47% at 5 seconds and 73% at 10 seconds.6\n\n3.\n\nOne pediatric study demonstrated only a small delay (5.74 seconds) in commencement of rescue breathing with compressions-airway-breathing compared with airway-breathing-compressions.24 Although the evidence is of low certainty, continuing to recommend compressions-airway-breathing likely results in minimal delays in rescue breathing and allows for a consistent approach to cardiac arrest treatment in adults and children.\n\nComponents of High-Quality CPR\n\nRecommendation-Specific Supportive Text\n\n1.\n\nLarge observational studies of children with OHCA show the best outcomes with compression-ventilation CPR, though outcomes for infants with OHCA are often poor regardless of resuscitation strategy.25–29\n\n2.\n\nLarge observational studies of children with OHCA show that compression-only CPR is superior to no bystander CPR, though outcomes for infants with OHCA are often poor.27,28\n\n3.\n\nAllowing complete chest re-expansion improves the flow of blood returning to the heart and thereby blood flow to the body during CPR. There are no pediatric studies evaluating the effect of residual leaning during CPR, although leaning during pediatric CPR is common.2,3 In 1 observational study of invasively monitored and anesthetized children, leaning was associated with elevated cardiac filling pressures, leading to decreased coronary perfusion pressures during sinus rhythm.30\n\n4.\n\nA small observational study found that a compression rate of at least 100/min was associated with improved systolic and diastolic blood pressures during CPR for pediatric IHCA.31 One multicenter, observational study of pediatric IHCA demonstrated increased systolic blood pressures with chest compression rates between 100 and 120/min when compared with rates exceeding 120/min.32 Rates less than 100/min were associated with improved survival compared to rates of 100 to 120/min; however, the median rate in this slower category was approximately 95/min (ie, very close to 100/min).32\n\n5.\n\nThree anthropometric studies have shown that the pediatric chest can be compressed to one third of the anterior-posterior chest diameter without damaging intrathoracic organs.33–35 An observational study found an improvement in rates of ROSC and 24-hour survival, when at least 60% of 30-second epochs of CPR achieve an average chest compression depth greater than 5 cm for pediatric IHCA.36\n\n6.\n\nCurrent recommendations include a brief rhythm check every 2 minutes when a monitor or AED is available.\n\n7.\n\nThere are no human studies addressing the effect of varying inhaled oxygen concentrations during CPR on outcomes in infants and children.\n\n8.\n\nThe optimum compression-to-ventilation ratio is uncertain. Large observational studies of children with OHCA demonstrated better outcomes with compression-ventilation CPR with ratios of either 15:2 or 30:2 compared with compression-only CPR.25\n\n9.\n\nOne small, multicenter observational study of intubated pediatric patients found that ventilation rates (at least 30 breaths/min in children less than 1 year of age, at least 25 breaths/min in older children) were associated with improved rates of ROSC and survival.5 However, increasing ventilation rates are associated with decreased systolic blood pressure in children. The optimum ventilation rate during continuous chest compressions in children with an advanced airway is based on limited data and requires further study.\n\nRecommendations 1 and 2 were reviewed in the “2017 American Heart Association Focused Update on Pediatric Basic Life Support and Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation Quality: An Update to the American Heart Association Guidelines for Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation and Emergency Cardiovascular Care.”37\n\nCPR Technique\n\nRecommendation-Specific Supportive Text\n\n1.\n\nOne anthropometric38 and 3 radiological studies39–41 found that optimal cardiac compressions occur when fingers are placed just below the intermammary line. One observational pediatric study found that blood pressure was higher when compressions were performed over the lower third of the sternum compared to the midsternum.41 See Figure 2 for the 2-finger technique.\n\n2.\n\nSystematic reviews suggest that the 2-thumb–encircling hands technique may improve CPR quality when compared with 2-finger compressions, particularly for depth.42,43 However, recent manikin studies suggest that the 2-thumb–encircling hands technique may be associated with lower chest compression fractions (percent of cardiac arrest time that chest compression are provided)44 and incomplete chest recoil,45,46 especially when performed by single rescuers. See Figure 3 for the 2-thumb–encircling hands technique.\n\n3.\n\nThere are no pediatric-specific clinical data to determine if the 1-hand or 2-hand technique produces better outcomes for children receiving CPR. In manikin studies, the 2-hand technique has been associated with improved compression depth,47 compression force,48 and less rescuer fatigue.49\n\n4.\n\nThere were no human studies comparing the 1-hand compression versus the 2-thumb–encircling hands technique in infants.\n\nSupport Surfaces for CPR\n\nRecommendation-Specific Supportive Text\n\n1.\n\n“CPR mode” is available on some hospital beds to stiffen the mattress during CPR. Manikin models indicate that mattress compression ranges between 12% and 57% of total compression depth, with softer mattresses being compressed the most.50–53 This can lead to reduced sternal displacement and a reduction in effective chest compression depth.\n\n2.\n\nManikin studies and 1 pediatric case series show that effective compression depth can be achieved even on a soft surface, providing the CPR provider increases overall compression depth to compensate for mattress compression.53–59\n\n3.\n\nMeta-analysis of 6 studies53,56,60–63 showed a 3-mm (95% CI 1–4 mm) improvement in chest compression depth associated with backboard use when CPR was performed on a manikin placed on a mattress or bed.\n\nOpening the Airway\n\nRecommendation-Specific Supportive Text\n\n1.\n\nNo data directly address the ideal method to open or maintain airway patency. One retrospective cohort study evaluated various head-tilt angles in neonates and young infants undergoing diagnostic MRI and found that the highest proportion of patent airways was at a head-tilt angle of 144 to 150 degrees based on a regression analysis.64\n\n2.\n\nWhile no pediatric studies evaluate jaw thrust versus head tilt–chin lift to open the airway, the jaw thrust is widely accepted as an effective way to open the airway, and this maneuver theoretically limits cervical motion compared with the head tilt–chin lift.\n\n3.\n\nThere are no pediatric studies evaluating the impact of a head tilt–chin lift maneuver to open the airway in a trauma patient with suspected cervical spine injury. However, if providers are unable to open the airway and deliver effective ventilations using a jaw thrust, given the importance of a patent airway, using a head tilt–chin lift maneuver is recommended.\n\nFigures 4, 5, 6, and 7 show, respectively, an infographic for pediatric BLS for lay rescuers, the current pediatric BLS algorithms for healthcare provider, single-rescuer CPR and 2-rescuer CPR, and the current algorithm for pediatric cardiac arrest.\n\nReferences\n\n1.\n\nNiles, DE, Duval-Arnould, J, Skellett, S, Knight, L, Su, F, Raymond, TT, Sweberg, T, Sen, AI, Atkins, DL, Friess, SH, de Caen, AR, Kurosawa, H, Sutton, RM, Wolfe, H, Berg, RA, Silver, A, Hunt, EA, Nadkarni, VM; pediatric Resuscitation Quality (pediRES-Q) Collaborative Investigators.

Airway management and effective ventilation are fundamental to pediatric resuscitation. Although the majority of patients can be successfully ventilated with bag-mask ventilation, this method requires interruptions in chest compressions and is associated with risk of aspiration and barotrauma.\n\nAdvanced airway interventions, such as supraglottic airway (SGA) placement or endotracheal intubation (ETI), may improve ventilation, reduce the risk of aspiration, and enable uninterrupted compression delivery. However, airway placement may interrupt the delivery of compressions or result in a malpositioned device. Advanced airway placement requires specialized equipment and skilled providers, and it may be difficult for professionals who do not routinely intubate children.\n\nRecommendation-Specific Supportive Text\n\n1.\n\nA clinical trial and 2 propensity-matched retrospective studies show that ETI and bag-mask ventilation achieve similar rates of survival with good neurological function and survival to hospital discharge in pediatric patients with OHCA.1–3 Propensity-matched retrospective studies also show similar rates of survival with good neurological function and survival to discharge when comparing SGA with bag-mask ventilation in pediatric OHCA.2,3 No difference was observed in outcomes between SGA and ETI.2,3 There are limited data to compare outcomes between bag-mask ventilation versus ETI in the management of IHCA,4 and there are no hospital-based studies of SGA. The data are not sufficient to support a recommendation for advanced airway use in IHCA. There may be specific circumstances or populations in which early advanced airway interventions are beneficial.\n\nThis recommendation was reviewed in the “2019 American Heart Association Focused Update on Pediatric Advanced Life Support: An Update to the American Heart Association Guidelines for Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation and Emergency Cardiovascular Care.”5\n\nReferences\n\n1.\n\nGausche, M, Lewis, RJ, Stratton, SJ, Haynes, BE, Gunter, CS, Goodrich, SM, Poore, PD, McCollough, MD, Henderson, DP, Pratt, FD, et al.

Routine use of sodium bicarbonate and calcium is not supported by current data.3–7 However, there are specific circumstances when their administration is indicated, such as electrolyte imbalances and certain drug toxicities.\n\nMedication dosing for children is based on weight, which is often difficult to obtain in an emergency setting. There are numerous approaches to estimating weight when an actual weight cannot be obtained.8\n\nDrug Administration During Cardiac Arrest\n\nRecommendation-Specific Supportive Text\n\n1.\n\nThere are limited data in pediatrics comparing epinephrine administration to no epinephrine administration in any setting. In an OHCA study of 65 children, 12 patients did not receive epinephrine due to lack of a route of administration, and only 1 child had ROSC.2 An OHCA study of 9 children who had cardiac arrest during sport or exertion noted a survival rate of 67%, of whom 83% did not receive epinephrine. All survivors received early chest compressions (within 5 minutes) and early defibrillation (within 10 minutes), and the initial cardiac arrest rhythm was a shockable rhythm.9 Intravenous/intraosseous (IV/IO) administration of epinephrine is preferred over ETT administration when possible.10,11\n\n2.\n\nOne retrospective observational study of children with IHCA who received epinephrine for an initial nonshockable rhythm demonstrated that, for every minute delay in administration of epinephrine, there was a significant decrease in ROSC, survival at 24 hours, survival to discharge, and survival with favorable neurological outcome.12 Patients who received epinephrine within 5 minutes of CPR compared to those who received epinephrine more than 5 minutes after CPR initiation were more likely to survive to discharge.12 Four observational studies of pediatric OHCA demonstrated that earlier epinephrine administration increased rates of ROSC,13,14 survival to ICU admission,14 survival to discharge,14,16 and 30-day survival.15\n\n3.\n\nOne observational study demonstrated an increased survival rate at 1 year in the group that was administered epinephrine at an interval of less than 5 minutes.17\n\nOne observational study of pediatric IHCA demonstrated that an average epinephrine administration interval of 5 to 8 minutes and of 8 to 10 minutes was associated with increased odds of survival compared with an epinephrine interval of 1 to 5 minutes.18 Both studies17,18 calculated the average interval of epinephrine doses by averaging all doses over total arrest time, which does not account for potential differences in dosing intervals throughout resuscitations of varying duration. No studies of pediatric OHCA on frequency of epinephrine dosing were identified.\n\n4.\n\nTwo studies examined drug therapy of VF/pVT in infants and children.19,20 In Valdes et al, administration of lidocaine, but not amiodarone, was associated with higher rates of ROSC and survival to hospital admission.19 Neither lidocaine nor amiodarone significantly affected the odds of survival to hospital discharge; neurological outcome was not assessed. A propensity-matched study of an IHCA registry demonstrated no difference in outcomes for patients receiving lidocaine compared with amiodarone.20\n\n5.\n\nA recent evidence review identified 8 observational studies of sodium bicarbonate administration during cardiac arrest.5–7,21–25 Bicarbonate administration was associated with worse survival outcomes for both IHCA and OHCA. There are special circumstances in which bicarbonate is used, such as the treatment of hyperkalemia and sodium channel blocker toxicity, including from tricyclic antidepressants.\n\n6.\n\nTwo observational studies examining the administration of calcium during cardiac arrest demonstrated worse survival and ROSC with calcium administration.4,23 There are special circumstances in which calcium administration is used, such as hypocalcemia, calcium channel blocker overdose, hypermagnesemia, and hyperkalemia.3\n\nRecommendation 4 was reviewed in “2018 American Heart Association Focused Update on Pediatric Advanced Life Support: An Update to the American Heart Association Guidelines for Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation and Emergency Cardiovascular Care.”26\n\nWeight-Based Dosing of Resuscitation Medications\n\nRecommendation-Specific Supportive Text\n\n1.\n\nThere are many theoretical concerns about the use of actual body weight (especially in overweight or obese patients).27–29 However, there are no data about the safety and efficacy of adjusting medication dosing in obese patients. Such adjustments could result in inaccurate dosing of medications.30,31\n\n2.\n\nSeveral studies suggest that inclusion of body habitus or anthropometric measurements further refines and improves weight estimations using length-based measures.8 However, there is considerable variation in these methods, and the training required to use these measures may not be practical in every context.\n\n3.\n\nCognitive aids can assist in the accurate approximation of body weight (described as being within 10% to 20% of measured total body weight). Several recent studies demonstrated high variability of weight estimates, with a tendency toward underestimation of total body weight yet closely approximating ideal body weight.29,32,33\n\nReferences\n\n1.\n\nCampbell, ME, Byrne, PJ.

Cardiac arrest due to an initial rhythm of VF/pVT has better rates of survival to hospital discharge with favorable neurological function than cardiac arrests due to an initial nonshockable rhythm. Shockable rhythms may be the initial rhythm of the cardiac arrest (primary VF/pVT) or may develop during the resuscitation (secondary VF/pVT). Defibrillation is the definitive treatment for VF/pVT. The shorter the duration of VF/pVT, the more likely that the shock will result in a perfusing rhythm. Both manual defibrillators and AEDs can be used to treat VF/pVT in children. Manual defibrillators are preferred when a shockable rhythm is identified by a healthcare provider because the energy dose can be titrated to the patient’s weight. AEDs have high specificity in recognizing pediatric shockable rhythms. Biphasic, instead of monophasic, defibrillators are recommended because less energy is required to achieve termination of VF/pVT, with fewer side effects. Many AEDs are equipped to attenuate (reduce) the energy dose to make them suitable for infants and children younger than 8 years of age.\n\nEnergy Dose\n\nRecommendation-Specific Supportive Text\n\n1.\n\n1, 2, and 3. A systematic review1 demonstrated no relationship between energy dose and any outcome. No randomized controlled trials were available, and most studies only evaluated the first shock. An IHCA case series of 71 shocks in 27 patients concluded that 2 J/kg terminated VF, but neither the subsequent rhythm nor the outcome of the resuscitation was reported.2 A small case series of prolonged OHCA observed that 2 to 4 J/kg shock terminated VF 14 times in 11 patients, resulting in asystole or pulseless electric activity, with no survivors to hospital discharge.3 In 1 observational study of IHCA,4 a higher initial energy dose of more than 3 to 5 J/kg was less effective than 1 to 3 J/kg in achieving ROSC. Three small, observational studies of pediatric IHCA3,5 and OHCA6 found no specific initial energy dose that was associated with successful defibrillation. One study suggested that 2 J/kg was an ineffective dose, especially for secondary VF.7\n\nCoordination of Shock and CPR\n\nRecommendation-Specific Supportive Text\n\n1.\n\nThere are currently no pediatric data available regarding the optimal timing of CPR prior to defibrillation. Adult studies demonstrate no benefit of a prolonged period of CPR prior to initial defibrillation.8–12\n\n2.\n\nThere are currently no pediatric data concerning the best sequence for coordination of shocks and CPR. Adult studies comparing a 1-shock protocol versus a 3-shock protocol for treatment of VF suggest significant survival benefit with the single-shock protocol.13,14\n\n3.\n\nProlonged pauses in chest compressions decrease blood flow and oxygen delivery to vital organs, such as the brain and heart, and are associated with lower survival.13,15\n\nDefibrillator Paddle Size, Type, and Position\n\nRecommendation-Specific Supportive Text\n\n1.\n\nLarger pad or paddle size decreases transthoracic impedance, which is a major determinant of current delivery.16–18\n\n2.\n\nOne human and 1 porcine study demonstrated no significant difference in shock success or ROSC when comparing anterior-lateral with anterior-posterior position.7,19\n\n3.\n\nOne study demonstrated no significant difference in median time to shock with paddles compared with self-adhesive pads.20\n\nType of Defibrillator\n\nRecommendation-Specific Supportive Text\n\n1.\n\nShockable rhythms are infrequent in infants.21,22 Studies of rhythm identification algorithms have demonstrated high specificity for shockable rhythms in infants and children.23–25 Although there are no direct comparisons between pediatric attenuator and nonattenuator AED-delivered shocks, multiple case reports and case series document shock success with survival when a pediatric attenuator was used.26–32\n\n2.\n\nThere are no specific studies comparing manual defibrillators with AEDs in infants or children. Manual defibrillators are preferred for in-hospital use because the energy dose can be titrated to the patient’s weight. In adults, use of an AED in hospitals did not improve survival,33 and the peri-shock pauses needed for rhythm analysis were prolonged.34\n\n3.\n\nAEDs without pediatric modifications deliver 120 to 360 Joules, exceeding the recommended dose for children weighing less than 25 kg. However, there are reports of safe and effective AED use in infants and young children when the dose exceeded 2 to 4 J/kg.26–28,30,35 Because defibrillation is the only effective therapy for VF, an AED without a dose attenuator may be lifesaving.\n\nReferences\n\n1.\n\nMercier, E, Laroche, E, Beck, B, Le Sage, N, Cameron, PA, Émond, M, Berthelot, S, Mitra, B, Ouellet-Pelletier, J.

Invasive arterial blood pressure monitoring during CPR provides insight to blood pressures generated with compressions and medications.4 End-tidal CO2 (ETCO2) reflects both the cardiac output produced and ventilation efficacy and may provide feedback on the quality of CPR.5 A sudden rise in ETCO2 may be an early sign of ROSC.6 CPR feedback devices (ie, coaching, audio, and audiovisual devices) may improve compression rate, depth, and recoil within a system of training and quality assurance for high-quality CPR. Point of care ultrasound, specifically echocardiography, during CPR has been considered for identification of reversible causes of arrest. Technologies that are under evaluation to assess resuscitation quality include noninvasive measures of cerebral oxygenation, such as using near infrared spectroscopy during CPR.\n\nRecommendation-Specific Supportive Text\n\n1.\n\nA prospective observational study of pediatric patients with invasive arterial blood pressure monitoring during the first 10 minutes of CPR demonstrated higher rates of favorable neurological outcome if the diastolic blood pressure was at least 25 mm Hg in infants and at least 30 mm Hg in children.4 Of note, the cut points for diastolic blood pressure tracings were analyzed using post hoc waveform analysis; therefore, prospective evaluation is needed.\n\n2.\n\nA single-center, retrospective study of in-hospital CPR in infants found that ETCO2 values between 17 and 18 mm Hg had a positive predictive value for ROSC of 0.885.7 A prospective, multicenter observational study of IHCA did not find an association between mean ETCO2 and outcomes.8\n\n3.\n\nA simulation trial of pediatric healthcare providers demonstrated a significant improvement in chest compression depth and rate compliance when they received visual feedback (compared to no feedback), although overall compression quality remained poor.9 One small observational study of 8 children with IHCA did not find an association between CPR with or without audiovisual feedback and survival to discharge, although feedback decreased excessive compression rates.10\n\n4.\n\nSeveral case series evaluated the use of bedside echocardiography to identify reversible causes of cardiac arrest, including pulmonary embolism.11,12 One prospective observational study of children (without cardiac arrest) admitted to an ICU reported good agreement of estimates of shortening fraction and inferior vena cava volume between emergency physicians using bedside limited echocardiography and cardiologists performing formal echocardiography.13\n\nReferences\n\n1.\n\nNiles, DE, Duval-Arnould, J, Skellett, S, Knight, L, Su, F, Raymond, TT, Sweberg, T, Sen, AI, Atkins, DL, Friess, SH, de Caen, AR, Kurosawa, H, Sutton, RM, Wolfe, H, Berg, RA, Silver, A, Hunt, EA, Nadkarni, VM; pediatric Resuscitation Quality (pediRES-Q) Collaborative Investigators.

It is a resource-intense, complex, multidisciplinary therapy that traditionally has been limited to large pediatric medical centers with providers who have expertise in the management of children with cardiac disease. Judicious use of ECPR for specific patient populations and within dedicated and highly practiced environments has proved successful, especially for IHCA with reversible causes.1 ECPR use rates have increased, with single-center reports in both adults and children suggesting that application of this therapy across broader patient populations may improve survival after cardiac arrest.2–4\n\nThere are no studies of ECPR demonstrating improved outcomes following pediatric OHCA.\n\nRecommendation-Specific Supportive Text\n\n1.\n\nOne observational registry study of ECPR for pediatric IHCA after cardiac surgery demonstrated that ECPR was associated with higher rates of survival to hospital discharge than conventional CPR.5 A propensity-matched analysis of ECPR compared with conventional CPR using the same registry found that ECPR was associated with favorable neurological outcome in patients with IHCA of any etiology.6 There is insufficient evidence to suggest for or against the use of ECPR for pediatric patients experiencing OHCA or pediatric patients with noncardiac disease experiencing IHCA refractory to conventional CPR.\n\nThis recommendation was reviewed in the “2019 American Heart Association Focused Update on Pediatric Advanced Life Support: An Update to the American Heart Association Guidelines for Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation and Emergency Cardiovascular Care.”7\n\nReferences\n\n1.\n\nBrunetti, MA, Gaynor, JW, Retzloff, LB, Lehrich, JL, Banerjee, M, Amula, V, Bailly, D, Klugman, D, Koch, J, Lasa, J, Pasquali, SK, Gaies, M.

The components of post–cardiac arrest syndrome are (1) brain injury, (2) myocardial dysfunction, (3) systemic ischemia and reperfusion response, and (4) persistent precipitating pathophysiology.1,2 Post–cardiac arrest brain injury remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in adults and children because the brain has limited tolerance of ischemia, hyperemia, or edema. Pediatric post–cardiac arrest care focuses on anticipating, identifying, and treating this complex physiology to improve survival and neurological outcomes.\n\nTargeted temperature management (TTM) refers to continuous maintenance of patient temperature within a narrowly prescribed range while continuously monitoring temperature. All forms of TTM avoid fever, and hypothermic TTM attempts to treat reperfusion syndrome by decreasing metabolic demand, reducing free radical production, and decreasing apoptosis.2\n\nIdentification and treatment of derangements—such as hypotension, fever, seizures, acute kidney injury, and abnormalities of oxygenation, ventilation, and electrolytes—are important because they may impact outcomes.\n\nPost–Cardiac Arrest Targeted Temperature Management\n\nRecommendation-Specific Supportive Text\n\n1 and 2. Two pediatric randomized clinical trials of TTM (32°C–34°C for 48 hours followed by 3 days of TTM 36°C–37.5°C versus TTM 36°C–37.5°C for a total of 5 days) after IHCA or OHCA in children with coma following ROSC found no difference in 1-year survival with a favorable neurological outcome.3,4 Hyperthermia was actively prevented with TTM. Continuous core temperature monitoring was used for the 5 days of TTM in both trials.\n\nRecommendations 1 and 2 were reviewed in the “2019 American Heart Association Focused Update on Pediatric Advanced Life Support: An Update to the American Heart Association Guidelines for Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation and Emergency Cardiovascular Care.”5\n\nPost–Cardiac Arrest Blood Pressure Management\n\nRecommendation-Specific Supportive Text\n\n1 and 2. Two observational studies demonstrated that systolic hypotension (below 5th percentile for age and sex) at approximately 6 to 12 hours following cardiac arrest is associated with decreased survival to discharge.6,7 Another observational study found that patients who had longer periods of hypotension within the first 72 hours of ICU post–cardiac arrest care had decreased survival to discharge.8 In an observational study of patients with arterial monitoring during and immediately after cardiac arrest, diastolic hypertension (above 90th percentile) in the first 20 minutes after ROSC was associated with an increased likelihood of survival to discharge.9 Because blood pressure is often labile in the post–cardiac arrest period, continuous arterial pressure monitoring is recommended.\n\nPost–Cardiac Arrest Oxygenation and Ventilation Management\n\nRecommendation-Specific Supportive Text\n\n1 and 2. Because an arterial oxyhemoglobin saturation of 100% may correspond to a Pao2 between 80 and approximately 500 mm Hg, it is reasonable to target an oxyhemoglobin saturation between 94% and 99%. Three small observational studies of pediatric IHCA and OHCA did not show an association between hyperoxemia and outcome.10,11,13 In a larger observational study of pediatric IHCA and OHCA patients, the presence of normoxemia compared with hyperoxemia after ROSC was associated with improved survival to pediatric ICU discharge.12\n\nOne observational study demonstrated that both hypercapnia and hypocapnia after ROSC were associated with increased mortality.11 One small observational study demonstrated no association between hypercapnia (Paco2 greater than 50 mm Hg) or hypocapnia (Paco2 less than 30 mm Hg) and outcome.10 Another observational study of pediatric IHCA, showed hypercapnia (Paco2 50 mm Hg or greater) was associated with decreased survival to hospital discharge.14 Because hypercapnia and hypocapnia impact cerebral blood flow, normocapnia should be the"
