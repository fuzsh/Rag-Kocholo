        "text": "Teenaged French-Canadian Pioneer — François Boucher\n\nB. before 22 Nov 1617 in Saint-Langis, Perche, France1\n\nM. 3 Sep 1641 in Quebec City, New France2\n\nWife: Florence Gareman\n\nD. before 2 May 1678 in (probably) Cap-Rouge, New France3\n\nFrançois Boucher wasn’t yet an adult when he was part of one of the earliest migrations to New France. He was born in Saint-Langis, France, a village of Perche, baptized there on November 22, 1617.1 François’ parents were Marin Boucher and Julienne Baril, and it’s believed that he was their only child who survived to adulthood. The house where François grew up still stands; it's a small cottage that adjoins several other dwellings.\n\nHouse where François was born. (Source: WikiTree)\n\nWhen François was about age 10, his mother died,4 and his father Marin remarried, giving him two half-brothers by 1633. Then Marin was approached by a man named Robert Giffard, who asked him if he’d like to leave France for an opportunity in America.5 Marin not only said yes, he decided to bring 17-year-old François with him. The two of them boarded a ship in April 1634, and by summer, they were established in the fledgling colony of Quebec.5 Things must have worked out for them because the following year, the rest of the family joined them,6 and four more half-siblings were born in their new home in Beauport.\n\nOn September 3, 1641, François got married to Florence Gareman,2 the daughter of a settler living upriver from Quebec City in a place called Cap-Rouge. For the first few years of their marriage, they lived near François’ father, and had three children born there. But in about 1648, they moved to the area where Florence’s father had a farm.7 François was said to have acquired a concession in Sillery,8 and it was here that most of his children were born. By 1664, the family was complete with the births of nine more children.\n\nFrançois’ father-in-law had his life come to a terrible end in June 1653 when he was captured, tortured and killed by Iroquois warriors.7 This demonstrated the terror all of the settlers were under on the frontier of the colony. Florence’s young brother was also captured, and he was kept by the Indians for years.7 The murdered man’s land passed to his three sons-in-law, which included François; the three of them sold the concession and each took a third of the payment.9\n\nBy 1667, François had a farm with 25 arpents under cultivation and 7 head of cattle.10 He died sometime between the dates July 28, 1673 and May 2, 1678,3 but there is no record of his burial. His wife Florence survived him; she died by November 1689.11 François was the ancestor of Leo Durocher.\n\nChildren:\n\n1.

He was from the 10th Arrondissement, presumably born there in about 1652.1 His parents were Nicolas Provost (also spelled Prevost) and Anne St. Amand, who attended St-Laurent parish. René had enough schooling that he could at least sign his name,3 but nothing else is known of his early years.\n\nRené's signature, 1705.\n\nThe first time René showed up in records was in his marriage on January 9, 1684.1 He probably arrived in New France a year or two before that date since he was not listed in the 1681 census.4 His bride was 17-year-old Marie-Anne Daudelin, the daughter of a settler who lived in La-Pérade, the seigneury where the wedding took place. Why René migrated isn’t known; most settlers who came from France arrived a decade or two earlier. It was common for those who migrated after 1680 to have been soldiers, but there’s no evidence that he ever served in the military.\n\nRené settled with his new wife in nearby Batiscan, where his first two children were likely born. Then the family moved to the Montreal area; it’s believed that they made their home in Varennes after René acquired a concession of land on October 1, 1688.5 Eight more children were born there, with the youngest one in 1706.6 Of the ten total children, three (and possibly four) died young.\n\nRené was widowed on July 1, 1733 when his wife Marie-Anne passed away.7 He died on May 31, 1735, and was buried the following day at Ste-Anne parish in Varennes.2 René’s surviving children all seemed to have stayed in Varennes or neighboring Boucherville. Today a small suburban street in Varennes bears his name. René was the ancestor of Leo Durocher.\n\nChildren:\n\n1.

Margaret’s life began in Braunton, England, a village near the northeast coast of Devon, where she was baptized on March 8, 1595.1 Her parents were John Wyatt and Frances Chichester, and she had two brothers and three sisters. Her father was described as a “gentleman,” an indication of his status,3 but he died when she was about 3-years-old.3\n\nOn February 2, 1627, Margaret married Matthew Allyn,1 who may have been ten years younger than she was. They continued to live in Braunton, having three children, one of whom likely died as an infant. Devon was one of the regions of England which had a large following of Puritans, and Margaret and her husband were among them. While the majority of people who joined the migration to America were of what we would consider middle class (yeomen, merchants, artisans, etc.), a few Puritans were from a wealthier class. For such people, the strength of their religious beliefs outweighed any sort of comforts they would have by remaining in England. So in about 1632, Margaret, Matthew and their children boarded a ship to become a part of the Puritan colony.4\n\nAfter arriving in Massachusetts, Margaret and Matthew settled in Cambridge, where they became among the largest landowners in the area,4 and a son was born around this time. Matthew served as a representative to the General Court in Boston,4 but he had disagreements with community leaders. In 1636, the family joined a group led by Reverend Thomas Hooker who formed a new settlement on the Connecticut River called Hartford.4\n\nMargaret and Matthew made their home in Hartford for the next few years, as he took a leadership role there. Then Matthew had a falling out with Reverend Hooker, and the family ended up relocating to the town of Windsor.4 This was where they spent the rest of their lives. Matthew died on February 1, 1671,4 and Margaret passed away on September 12, 1675.2\n\nMargaret’s Family Tree\n\nThe lines of Margaret’s pedigree that trace back into antiquity are through her mother, Frances Chichester. Frances was born into minor nobility, but in a family of 19 children, inheritance becomes splintered, explaining why she didn't marry a nobleman. From here, going back in time, family connections can be pieced together through probate records, and Frances has lines on both sides showing over 20 generations.5 Some ancestors connect to monarchs who include John I (of Magna Carta fame), Henry I of England, William the Conqueror, Alfred the Great, Robert I of France, and Charlemagne.\n\nA page of Margaret's pedigree. (Source: WikiTree)\n\nBeyond the Saxon kings and Norman princes are threads of genealogy that go even further. Through intermarriage of nobility, some lines go back into German, Irish, or other nationalities in Europe. They include people who lived over a thousand years ago, and in a couple of extreme cases, the lines trace to almost the year 1 AD. That’s about 60 generations back from Margaret.\n\nAre these ancestors really Margaret’s? There’s no way to be certain because many of the links are assumptions, and all it takes is for one assumption to be wrong for the chain to be broken. The farther back in time you go, the more doubtful the accuracy is. Still, it’s fun to think about — it demonstrates the idea that we are all descended from thousands of people who lived during the Dark Ages and beyond.\n\nMargaret’s family tree also has very impressive descendants, including Agatha Christie, Mitt Romney, Mike Huckabee, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, and three First Ladies: Ellen Wilson, Bess Truman and Nancy Reagan.6\n\nChildren:\n\n1.

He was born in roughly 1615 in Norwich, England to Thomas and Elizabeth Peirce, one of at least 8 children.1 This area of England was home to many Puritans, and the Peirce family (also spelled Pierce or Pearce) were part of the Great Migration to New England during the 1630s. It isn’t known exactly when they arrived, but it was certainly by 1635, when their names first appeared in records there.4 They settled in Charlestown, Massachusetts, where Thomas was admitted to the church.4\n\nWithin the next few years, Thomas got married to the daughter of another Charlestown settler. His bride was Elizabeth Cole, and their marriage took place in about 1639.2 Between 1643 and about 1662, they had twelve children, of which ten were sons. Two boys died as infants, but the others went on to give him many grandchildren (his two daughters did as well).\n\nBy 1643, Thomas moved to the new settlement of Woburn,5 one of many towns that were springing up as the colony's population grew. As with all men in all Puritan communities, Thomas performed civic duties. He served in the town council as selectman in 1660 through 1662, and in 1664 and 1670, and he was chosen as “commissioner of the rate.”5 Thomas was also elected to be sergeant of the militia in October 1663;5 after this date, he was often referred to as Sergeant Thomas Pierce in town records.\n\nTwo notes in the Woburn town records gave specific projects Thomas was involved with. In 1668, he was member of a committee selected to oversee the division of some common land in Woburn. For his work, he received 37 acres of “make meadow or swamp land.”5 And on November 1, 1671, he was chosen for a 4-man committee to oversee the building of a meetinghouse.5 The existing structure had been in use since Woburn was first settled, and it was already showing signs of age. The new one that Thomas was involved with was ready for use in the fall of 1672.\n\nThomas' signature, date unknown.\n\nBecause Thomas’ father lived until 1665 and had the same name, it’s sometimes confusing to sort out who did what. In 1652, a Thomas Peirce of Woburn charged a man named Samuel Eldred with letting his hogs do damage to his property. It isn’t clear if this was Thomas or his father, or what exactly was damaged. The case was withdrawn before it came to trial.\n\nAt about the end of 1678, Thomas' name was on a list of people who contracted small pox.5 The disease had spread all over the colony after someone who was infected arrived on a ship in July 1677.6 On January 6, 1679, Woburn authorities ordered quarantining in order to stop the further spread of the epidemic.5 It may be that Thomas' son Thomas was actually the one who had small pox, but regardless of who it was, they recovered from the disease.\n\nThomas died at Woburn on November 6, 1683.3 Elizabeth survived for a few more years, passing away in 1688.3 Their descendants included governor of New Hampshire, Benjamin Pierce, President Franklin Pierce, Barbara (Pierce) Bush, George W. Bush, Jeb Bush and James Spader.7\n\nChildren:\n\n1. Thomas Peirce — B. about 1640, (possibly) Woburn, Massachusetts;8 D. 8 Dec 1717, Woburn, Massachusetts;3 M.

(1) before 1640 in (probably) Hengelo, Netherlands1,3\n\nHusband: Arent Theunissen Van Henglen\n\nM. (2) 25 May 1656 in New Netherland1\n\nHusband: Severyn Laurenszen\n\nD. before 5 Aug 1671 in New York1\n\nTryntie Reynders was a woman who settled in New Netherland with her husband, and faced terrible hardships because of it. But she found a way to survive, keeping her children safe, and passing her bloodline on to thousands of descendants.\n\nTryntie (also spelled Tryntje) was born in Hengelo, Netherlands in about 1621.1,2 Nothing is known of her family; surnames were patronymic in most Netherlands families, and “Reynders” was taken from the first name of her father. After she came of age, she married Arent Theunissen Van Henglen, who was also from Hengelo.1,3 Between about 1641 and 1652, she had at least three children.\n\nShortly after the birth of her youngest child, Arent decided the family would find a new life in America. Once in New Amsterdam, they joined a group who were establishing a community on Staten Island.1 For a time, the family enjoyed a peaceful life on their farm, but it came to an abrupt end in a conflict called the Peach Tree War. This was a fight between the Dutch and the Swedish who colonized in the region first. The Swedes enlisted local tribes who could help them fight, and after the Dutch took several of their forts in 1655, Susquehannock warriors retaliated against Dutch civilians on September 15th.\n\nOne of the places they hit was where Tryntie lived. A total of 23 people were killed at the Staten Island settlement, including her husband Arent.1,4 Typically, in a raid such as this, people were slaughtered in their homes with tomahawks, and it’s likely Tryntie was there to witness whatever was done to her husband. She and all three of her children were then captured and taken back to the Susquehannock camp where they were held as prisoners.5 There were over 60 people with her, each living in fear of what would happen next. But luckily, after a month in captivity, their release was negotiated by the man who had run the settlement on Staten Island, Captain Adrian Post.6\n\nWith her husband dead and her home destroyed, Tryntie and her children sought refuge in Manhattan with many other victims of the massacre.5 Needing a husband to support her, she married a man named Severyn Laurenszen on May 25, 1656.1 Severyn was from Denmark, and had come to New Amsterdam as a mercenary soldier.7\n\nNew Amsterdam when Tryntje lived there.\n\nTryntie was by now about age 45, and she had no children with her second husband. It must have been a struggle to make ends meet, which may have led to Severyn being charged with theft in early 1658. A trial on April 12th resulted in him being found him guilty, and his sentence was to be “stripped of arms and publicly flogged and branded.”7 He escaped jail before this was done, and on May 28th, he was pardoned and “permitted to live on Long Island,”7 which meant he and Tryntie moved to either present-day Queens or Brooklyn.\n\nSince Severyn no longer had a place in the military, he needed a new livelihood, and in about 1660, he decided to go into business with another man running a tavern.7 Once again, Tryntie moved, this time to a road on the outskirts of New Amsterdam which became known as The Bowery. Several taverns lined the road, so it must have attracted a somewhat lawless element. Severyn was cited more than once for such violations as “selling liquor during divine service,” and for allowing people in his tavern “to play nine pins” on Sunday.7\n\nTryntie’s ordeal on Staten Island resurfaced in November 1661. Former colony leader Captain Post sued Severyn for money he thought was owed regarding Tryntie’s release back in 1656. To counter that, Tryntie came forward in court with a claim that Captain Post actually owed her a larger amount of money.7,8 The authorities referred the case to Thomas Hall and Fredrick Lubbersen to settle the issue, but there’s no further record of what happened next.\n\nIt isn’t known exactly when Tryntie died. She and Severyn made a joint will in about May 1662,8 and she didn’t appear in any records after that. He married a second wife on August 5, 1671,1 so her death must have been between those two dates.\n\nChildren (all by Arent Theunissen Van Henglen):\n\n1.

He was born in about 1636 in Lafontaine-Milon, a village in Angers, France.1 Étienne’s parents were Claude Boyer and Sébastienne Raveneau, and he was one of at least six children. His father was a butcher, but died when Étienne was a baby;1 then his mother, a brother and a sister all died in 1639.\n\nAfter Étienne came of age, he enlisted in the military, and was part of the Carignan-Salières Regiment that was sent to protect New France in 1665.1 On May 24th of that year, he boarded the ship Saint-Sebastien, and after a crossing that took months, he landed at Quebec City on September 12th.4 Soon after, his company led by La Fouille made their way to the mouth of the Rivière-du-Loup on Lac Saint-Pierre, where they spent the winter.4 Étienne helped build a fort, and presumably he was stationed there for some of his service. At the end of three years, Étienne’s term was up, and he became one of about 400 soldiers who decided to make their civilian life in the colony.\n\nAfter being released from service, Étienne seems to have lived in the Quebec City area. In the fall of 1671, he decided to seek a wife from the Filles du Roi who had just arrived from France. A 20-year-old woman named Marie-Therese Viel must have caught his eye, and on October 20th, a contract of marriage was signed.5 The wedding took place at Notre-Dame-de-Quebec on the 26th,2 and Therese was soon pregnant. Three sons were born between 1672 and 1675, but sadly only the third one survived.\n\nEtienne and Marie-Therese's marriage contract. (Source: BAnQ)\n\nBy this time, Étienne had acquired a concession in a place located north and west of Quebec City. (His land was on a bend in the Charles River, which was said to be the site of Maison O'Neill, a landmark house that was built in about 1860.6) In early 1676, a matter came up that had Therese making a trip back to France;4 such journeys were rare among colonists, and more unusual for a woman to travel alone. Étienne stayed behind with their very young son and waited for her return.\n\nWhen Therese came home months later, she was quite pregnant.4 Étienne was said to have refused to take her back,4 and it’s easy to imagine he was angry and embarrassed over it. Her claim was that she got seduced by a powerful man, Médard Chouart des Groseilliers, a French-Canadian fur trader who was also visiting France when he came into contact with her in La Rochelle.4 By the time Therese gave birth to her illegitimate baby on January 14, 1677,7 Étienne chose to believe her story and they got back together.4 Later that year, he tried to sue Chouart des Groseilliers, who denied being the baby’s father, but the court decided in Étienne’s favor. The plaintiff had to pay him 200 livres; the only stipulation on Étienne’s part was that he was ordered to raise the child.4\n\nAfter that, Étienne resumed normal relations with Therese. Together, they had ten more children, with the youngest born in 1691.8 The following year, Étienne was said to have sold his concession.6 The family seems to have moved to the Charlesbourg area because Therese was involved in an incident there with another woman in 1699.9\n\nÉtienne died on October 3, 1700 at Hôtel-Dieu in Quebec City.3 His widow Therese seems to have been left with a number of underaged children of which only one showed up in later records of New France. She herself was thought to have moved back to France; it’s very possible that many, or all, of the younger children went with her. Étienne and Therese were the ancestors of Ricky Gervais.\n\nChildren:\n\n1. Réne-Louis Boyer — B. 9 Sep 1672, New France;10 D. 11 Sep 1672, New France11\n\n2.

She was born at Quebec City on January 23, 1638 to Guillaume Hébert and Hélène Desportes,1 both of whom had parents who were among the colony’s earliest pioneers. Her mother was thought to be the first European born in all of Canada, and was just 17-years-old at Françoise’s birth. She had an older brother, and a younger sister who likely died as an infant. Françoise’s father died when she was very young, then her mother remarried and produced 12 half-siblings.\n\nFrançoise lived with her family in the Upper Town of Quebec,4 likely growing up in the same house where she was born. Ursuline nuns ran a school nearby, which she probably attended for a time.4 As the oldest daughter in a large family, Françoise would have helped her mother take care of her younger brothers and sisters, especially as they became numerous.\n\nFrançoise’s childhood came to an end on November 20, 1651 when she got married at age 13.2 Her husband was a newcomer to the colony named Guillaume Fournier, and he was in his thirties. It wasn’t uncommon for girls that young to to become brides because there was a shortage of women in the colony. Françoise lived in Charlesbourg early in her marriage, though most of her children were said to be born in Quebec City.4 The first baby came in November 1653, surviving only a month.5,6 She would have 15 children in all; three more died as infants, including the last two, and one of these may have been stillborn.\n\nBy the time Françoise gave birth to her next to last child in 1679,7 her family was living in the south shore community of Montmagny, where Guillaume had become the seigneur. Montmagny was off the beaten path and Françoise had to adapt to life on the frontier. Since it was a new settlement, there was no church there during the first few years, and until one was ready in December 1685, services were held in Françoise’ house8\n\nIt was during this part of her life that Françoise appears to have taken on the role of midwife. During colonial times, childbirth was rarely attended by doctors; instead, women taught each other basic procedures to assist in the delivery of babies. Along with having given birth 15 times, Françoise was likely present at many of her mother’s deliveries. In fact, her mother had also served as midwife for her community, and it’s easy to imagine Françoise may have assisted her. She was formally recognized as a midwife in a vote taken by the women of Montmagny on November 21, 1703.8\n\nIt’s been said that in some instances, Françoise performed baptisms on infants where she was attending a birth. The sacrament would be ideally administered by a priest, but in case the baby was about to die, someone else could have the authority to do it. One record dated September 4, 1702 showed that Françoise baptized the unnamed child of her son Joseph, and her signature was included in the parish register record.9\n\n1702 baptism performed by Françoise. (Source: FamilySearch.org)\n\nFrançoise’s husband Guillaume died in 1699,10 and she herself passed away at Montmagny on March 16, 1716.3 She was the direct ancestor of Celine Dion, Jim Carrey, Ricky Gervais, Chloë Sevigny, and Bridget Fonda.11\n\nChildren:\n\n1.
