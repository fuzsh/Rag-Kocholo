        "text": "III. DUTOT AND THE FINANCIERS (1708–1718)\n\nIn 1708, we find Dutot starting a career working for gens d’affaires in Alsace. How did he go from Normandy to Alsace? To find out, we will have to become acquainted with a series of minor but fascinating characters. The common point linking them is a German cardinal and prince, the bishop of Strasbourg.\n\nThe Farm of the Revenues of the Strasbourg Bishopric\n\nThe bishop of Strasbourg, a prince of the Holy Roman Empire, had seen the bulk of his dominions, situated west of the Rhine, fall under the sovereignty of France in 1681 (Livet Reference Livet1956). The bishop had nevertheless retained considerable powers and revenues, not only from extensive landholdings but also from taxes and monopolies, for example on the sale of salt, making this bishopric the richest in France (Marion Reference Marion1923, p. 60). Wilhelm or Guillaume Egon von Fürstenberg (1629–1704), bishop of Strasbourg from 1682 to 1704, had introduced the venality of offices and tax farming in his dominions at the suggestion of a man named Jacques Auber. In 1708, the senior partner in the farm of the revenues of the bishopric was a fermier général named Cyr Monmerqué (Dessert Reference Dessert1984, p. 651), who left the actual management of the farm to his junior partner and former employee Edme Boudard (1671–1722).Footnote 7\n\nIn Alsace, many rents were still paid in kind (Hoffmann and Ingold 1906–07, 1, p. 207), mostly wine and grains. As a result, a good portion of the bishop’s revenues consisted of large quantities of foodstuffs. But the farmers had to pay the bishop in current money, so the farmers were also, to some extent, in the grain and wine wholesale business. Thus, when the wars of Louis XIV resumed and fighting started in the Low Countries and in Germany, it was natural for these farmers to enter into another activity, the provisioning of troops, also undertaken by private entrepreneurs under contract with the Secretary of War (Sturgill Reference Sturgill1975; Germain-Martin Reference Germain-Martin1973; Iung Reference Iung1983; Corvisier 1992–94; Lynn Reference Lynn1997). Securing these contracts was relatively easy for the farmers of the bishop of Strasbourg, Monmerqué being one of the munitionnaires.Footnote 8\n\nDutot Employee of Boudard (1708–1715)\n\nHaving set the scene in Alsace, we now see Dutot appear in the following circumstances. Some of the distribution of salt, on which the bishop had a monopoly, was subcontracted by Boudard: for the bailiwicks of Benfeld to Joseph and Isaac Kahn in 1710; for the bailiwick of Dachstein to Baruch Weil in November 1708.Footnote 9 It is as witness to the last contract that Dutot first appears in Alsace, at the age of twenty-four. He also appears three years later, with the qualification of employé dans les affaires du Roy, as witness to another contract by which Boudard sold a minor office in the eaux et forêts.Footnote 10\n\nWe left Dutot as the bright son of a shipwright in the Cotentin, whose sharp mind and talent for numbers had been noticed by his family. How, then, did he leave his native Normandy? Without definite proof, I can still sketch a possible path through the Breton town of Saint-Malo.\n\nWe have seen that Dutot was acquainted with, and trusted by, members of the Magon and Moreau families of Saint-Malo. Nicolas Magon de la Chipaudière and Guillaume Moreau de La Primeraye were both active in the South Sea trade (Dahlgren Reference Dahlgren1909), for which a company was formed in 1698, the Compagnie de la Mer du Sud (Lévy Reference Lévy1980, 1, pp. 124–130). The prime mover of the new company was Jean Jourdan de Grouée, and among the shareholders, next to Magon de la Chipaudière, we find the names of Antoine Barrangue, a frequent partner of Jacques Auber who preceded Boudard in the farm of the Strasbourg revenues, and that of Charles Boulanger, treasurer of the Estates of Brittany. A few years later, in 1701, Jourdan founded the Compagnie de Salé to exploit a trading monopoly with the town of Salé in Morocco. Barrangue and Boulanger were shareholders, as was Jacques Auber.Footnote 11 Thus, from Magon in Saint-Malo, whom Dutot knew, through Jourdan and Barrangue, we have a link to Jacques Auber. Dutot may even have found clerical employment in one or the other company, which would account for the impressive collection of books on overseas travels in his library.\n\nHowever Dutot came to Alsace, in 1708, he is employed by Boudard. We learn more about his duties in a remarkable document, the journal of Boudard’s expenses from October 1712 to December 1714.Footnote 12 The diary begins with a trip from Strasbourg to Paris to secure provisioning contracts. Boudard and his wife were accompanied by Dutot and two other employees. Dutot stayed close to his employer: we see Boudard reimbursing his lodger for the purchase of a bed for Dutot. And before Boudard went to Versailles to see the minister, he bought Dutot an expensive black dress for 150 livres, to make him presentable at court.\n\nDuring the next six months, Boudard made several trips to Versailles to negotiate contracts with the munitionnaires. On December 15, 1712, he secured a contract to deliver 50,000 sacks of wheat in Alsace. He apparently was sole contractor initially, the advocate Charles-Henri Adam serving as cashier at first and later as partner. Then, on May 23, 1713, he secures another contract with Fargès, a major munitionnaire, to deliver 20,000 sacks of oats and 30,000 quintaux of hay.Footnote 13 While in Paris, Boudard busily financed his activities, with the help of the banker Pierre Romet. During this period, Boudard paid a total of 150 livres to Dutot, reimbursed him for miscellaneous toiletry supplies, and gave him another 250 livres “for his affairs” before both left Paris. They returned to Alsace in June 1713 to settle the accounts of the various receivers of the revenues of the bishopric.\n\nSoon after, in August 1713, Dutot was married.Footnote 14 The bride was Marie Anne or Marianne Marchand; her father, originally from Picardie, had settled in Strasbourg and purchased in 1693 an office of barber for 550 livres.Footnote 15\n\nDutot’s in-laws were of middling means. They gave their daughter a dowry of 2000 livres, while Dutot brought her 1000 livres, a reasonable establishment for the young couple, but it proved to be a strain on Marchand’s means: he could provide only half the dowry in cash and gave a promissory note for the rest. Moreover, when their younger daughter married in 1717, her dowry, of equal size, was formed with an inventory of housewares and promises to buy more for the young couple in the future. Marchand’s milieu and social position were that of small businesses and craftsmen, as evidenced by the marriage contract of the younger daughter: the groom was the son of a Reims draper, and the witnesses on the bride’s side included two barbers, a publican, and a training master.Footnote 16\n\nDutot’s witnesses came from a different world: Boudard himself and Vincent Loquet, the principal employee of Boudard’s enterprise in Strasbourg who had married a niece of Boudard.Footnote 17 The ceremony was also attended by Denis Garand, a prominent bread maker who served as senator of Strasbourg for his community of bread makers from 1706 to 1731, and had dealings with Boudard, later appearing as one of his creditors for 26,400L.Footnote 18\n\nIn spite of these close connections with Boudard’s employees and associates, Dutot’s exact role in Alsace remains shadowy. The marriage documents describe him as general comptroller of Boudard’s farm, but his name appears nowhere in the documents and accounts of the farms that I have seen, nor was he ever involved in any revenue collection. Only in a few minor instances did he take part in Boudard’s financial operations. When Boudard left Alsace for Paris in December 1713, Dutot met him in Lorraine and was entrusted with letters of exchange to be protested in Nancy.Footnote 19 We also see Boudard drawing bills of exchange on Dutot, twice in July 1714 and once in July 1715, Dutot being located in Metz on both occasions.Footnote 20 He must have worked as a clerk, accountant, or calculator, without operational or financial duties. Such a role is consistent with the nature of his position in Law’s Bank (which we will see below) and with a manuscript attributed to him entitled le Devoir des Comptables (I have found no trace of the text), listed in the catalogue of his library.Footnote 21\n\nThe Chamber of Justice (1716–1717)\n\nThe peace of Rastatt in 1714 put an end to all military operations on the German front and to provisioning activities in Alsace. Monmerqué was personally close to the finance minister Desmarets, and this, no doubt, gave Dutot’s employer high hopes for further opportunities. But Louis XIV’s having died in September 1715, Desmarets was promptly dismissed by the Regent, and the work of cleaning up the chaos of government finances soon began. Within months, Boudard suffered two blows. The first was the declaration of December 1715, which subjected all the debts arising from the provisioning of troops during the recent wars to a visa, in order to reduce them. The second was the Chamber of Justice created by edict of March 1716 to purge the accounts of Louis XIV’s last two wars and pursue malfeasance among financiers and war profiteers.Footnote 22 Suspects were offered a way to avoid prosecution by paying a tax assessed by the government. On December 12, 1716, Boudard was assessed at one million livres.Footnote 23 This enormous sum was far larger than those imposed on a number of more important financiers such as the farmers general; even his associate Monmerqué was taxed only at 480,000 livres, later reduced to 180,000 livres.Footnote 24 Adam was taxed only at 10,000 livres, Romet at 15,000 livres (Lüthy 1959–1961, 1, p. 286). It immediately became apparent that Boudard’s affairs were too complex to allow him to make the payment, because many of his assets were pledged to creditors in fictitious loans designed to park Boudard’s assets out of the government’s reach. A commission was created in 1717 to administer bankruptcy proceedings.Footnote 25 The commission continued its work even after Boudard’s death in 1722, until a final judgment was handed down in 1736.\n\nDutot makes a brief appearance during these proceedings: in July 1715, Boudard had drawn bills of exchange on Dutot in Metz to the amount of 22,400 livres, payable to another employee of Boudard, who immediately endorsed them to the Jewish banker Isaac Spir Levy. The bills were never honored, and Levy had successfully sued Dutot in Metz for payment, but Dutot appealed to the commission, through the office of Boudard’s old partner, the advocate Adam. Dutot claimed that the letters were drawn on him only for business purposes and that recent legislation (a decree of December 4, 1717) released the employees of the contractors of any personal liability; the commission found in his favor and he was discharged.Footnote 26\n\nWe do not know when Dutot left his position in Strasbourg, although we know that he was still employed in July 1715 when he accepted the letters of exchange. By 1717, however, we find him working as a chief clerk (directeur) of the Chamber of Justice. The skills he had acquired as an employee of Boudard suited him well for this job: he knew where the bodies were buried. Unhappily for Dutot, he may have succumbed to the temptation of bribery.\n\nShortly after the abolition of the chamber, on April 20, 1717, a warrant was given for the arrest of one Robert Ciceron, described as curator (procureur fiscal) of one of the possessions of the archbishop of Bordeaux in Languedoc. Ciceron must have been an old acquaintance of Boudard: the bishop of Bordeaux was also the abbot of Notre-Dame-de-Lagrasse, Ciceron was a notary in Lagrasse, and we know that Boudard had been in Lagrasse in 1702. Moreover, Ciceron had borrowed 7088L from Boudard in August 1704 (at a time when Boudard was in Languedoc) and in November 1706.Footnote 27 Arrested on the evening of April 21 and imprisoned in the Bastille, Ciceron was interrogated on April 24 by the lieutenant de police, Marc-René Le Voyer d’Argenson. Another accomplice arrested at the same time, Charles-Damien Foucault, was a prominent notary, having served as alderman (échevin) of Paris; I have not found a direct link to Boudard, but Foucault was the successor of the notary Robillard who had notarized the lease of the revenues of Strasbourg in 1701. Foucault was freed a few days later on April 28. Finally, another warrant was issued on April 23 for the arrest of “Dutaut” but, for unknown reasons, he was not apprehended until April 27.Footnote 28\n\nThe three men were suspected of having colluded to solicit bribes in exchange for reducing taxes imposed by the Chamber of Justice. The notary’s role was to hold the monies.Footnote 29 The personal involvement of the lieutenant-général de police d’Argenson shows that the matter was serious. But the police files are suspiciously empty, as if they had been purged at a later date: aside from arrest warrants, nothing remains, and the interrogations (which we know took place) are missing. Did Dutot actually reduce the assessed taxes? If so, was it out of friendship for his former employees such as Boudard, or out of greed as alleged? Since there was no trial, we cannot say for sure.\n\nAfter staying in the Bastille for five months,Footnote 30 Dutot was freed on September 8, 1717, but ordered to remain in his home (son pays) Barneville. He was allowed to return to Paris (February 23, 1718) for three months. The permission was extended twice, on May 24 and August 19, after which point the affair appears to end.Footnote 31 But we may believe that this brush with the law had a lasting impact on him. Of the very few paintings listed in his after-death inventory, one represents Saint Peter led from his jail by an angel.\n\nDutot’s Financier Friends\n\nDutot’s social circle at the time of his marriage included mainly associates and employees of the financier Boudard. His solicitor in 1718 was Boudard’s partner Adam. We will see in the next section that Dutot was closely involved in Law’s Bank from 1720 to 1723. Yet, throughout this period and into the 1720s, Dutot did not cut his ties with the financiers of his youth. His circle consisted exclusively of people he had known through Boudard, and he also dabbled in commercial ventures.\n\nDutot’s mother-in-law died in 1723, having lived with him for several years. She left little wealth aside from a share in the Indies Company, of which Dutot owned one eighth. Several of her children, siblings of Dutot’s wife, were still minors. Dutot was appointed to be their ward on the advice of family and friends.Footnote 32\n\nSeven friends of the minors are listed, all associates of Boudard. Philippe Regnard, appointed as substitute ward, was a wood merchant born in the same town as Boudard and married to one of Boudard’s nieces. Then come Boudard’s old partner and Dutot’s solicitor Charles-Henri Adam, the ubiquitous Valentin-Gilles Damiens, and Boudard’s banker Pierre Romet. François Joachim Gilbert was the nephew of a military engineer stationed in the Alsatian town of Saverne, where Boudard resided. François-Marie Chautard was an old acquaintance of Damiens, working then as the cashier of a syndicate of financiers selling newly created offices. Finally, Claude Groux was a banker who later inherited an office of payeur des rentes; when Dutot died, Groux lent 300 livres to his widow, and must, therefore, have remained a close acquaintance of the couple.\n\nDutot, as ward of the siblings of his wife, probably took his duties seriously: even though his own marriage was apparently childless, we find several up-to-date books on child rearing in his library. He must have played some part in finding suitable marriages for the sisters: one was married in 1732 to a mason and architect in Strasbourg; the other married François Polisse, a friend of Chautard who worked as a clerk in the office responsible for pursuing the Crown’s creditors such as Boudard.Footnote 33\n\nDutot’s papers listed in his after-death inventory yield a few indications of continued financial dealings, albeit on a small scale, in the early 1720s. In January and September 1725, Dutot lent to a German merchant named André Firnkrans (Fürnkranz) seventeen shares of the Indies Company until March 1727. Firnkrans, who had been involved in provisioning activities for the French armies and was in Paris to settle his accounts, needed them to satisfy an obligation he had toward a man named Lagrange. In March 1726, Firnkrans handed to Dutot as collateral a bill for 15,000 livres signed Taxis, and 9430L 10s in billets des vivres. Firnkrans failed to return the shares, and Dutot sued him in March 1728 before the special commission created in 1719 to handle all litigation related to shares. The commission found for Dutot, and declared Firnkrans liable for 24,225 livres (the value of the shares and dividends), and ordered that the bills that Dutot held as securities be sold on the market. Firnkrans appealed twice but without success.Footnote 34\n\nTraces of other dealings in the 1720s include a sizeable debt of 40,670 livres owed by the bankers Hogguer and Studer (Lüthy 1959–1961, 1, pp. 175, 240) to Dutot, and arising from some partnership between 1720 and 1723, and another debt for 1496 livres on the banker Abraham Worms, dated 1722; both uncollected in spite of sentences in commercial court against the debtors. In one of these sentences, dated 1727, Dutot is designated as a merchant (négociant).Footnote 35 At an unknown date, Dutot entered into a partnership with Horutner, a linen dealer of Swiss origin, established in Rouen (Dardel Reference Dardel1966, pp. 153, 214).\n\nThe list of Dutot’s debts at his death also reveals a number of other acquaintances.Footnote 36 One of his creditors was Simon Mérard, a cashier at the Indies Company: Dutot described him as “a man as prudent as he is wise, and on whose friendship I count” (Mann 1935). Dutot also owed money to the bankers Labhard and Vernet,Footnote 37 and to François-Adam d’Holbach, a well-known agent de change who made a fortune during John Law’s System. The common thread through almost all Dutot’s creditors is d’Holbach. He began his Parisian career in the offices of the banker Labhard. We find him among the creditors of Claude Groux at his death. Mérard and d’Holbach were linked in various ways. Mérard was a partner in tax farms with Nicolas Daine, husband of d’Holbach’s niece (it was Daine who appeared at the inventory of Dutot to present d’Holbach’s claims); and in 1739, we find d’Holbach and Mérard investing together in the Spanish fleet through the Malouin bankers Magon frères and Le Fer of Cádiz.Footnote 38 Finally, let us note that d’Holbach’s notaire and family friend (he was a witness to the marriage of d’Holbach’s nephew, the philosopher) was none other than Charles-Damien Foucault, Dutot’s accomplice in the Chamber of Justice affair.Footnote 39\n\nDutot also remained physically close to these people. In 1721, he lived on rue Gaillon, and in 1722 and 1723 we find him on rue du Temple. In 1725, he had moved to what would be his final dwelling: rue Croix des Petits-Champs, in the Hôtel de Lussan, a sixteenth-century building rebuilt in the 1670s.Footnote 40 All these addresses were in the financial district; the banker Hogguer lived on rue Croix des Petits-Champs, and Mérard lived rent-free in the building of the Indies Company, around the corner on the rue Neuve des Petits-Champs.\n\nTaken together, these scraps of evidence suggest that Dutot was still engaging in commercial and financial speculation, remaining in close contacts with the banking, if not the financier, milieu, till at least the mid-1720s.\n\nDutot and the “gens d’affaires”\n\nParis-Duverney, Harsin (Reference Harsin1935b, 1, pp. xxv–xxvi), and Murphy (Reference Murphy2000, pp. lii–lvii) have posed Dutot as a fierce critic of the ancienne finance, men who lent to the government or derived their income from their role in public finance. The debate between Dutot and Paris-Duverney was but a battle between the traditional finance and the innovative methods of Law. There are indeed many passages where Dutot contrasts commerce and finance. It is, therefore, surprising to discover that Dutot spent his formative years working in the midst of the ancienne finance, ran in with the law while (allegedly) trying to help financiers avoid the king’s justice, and even more surprising to find that, after becoming a disciple of Law, he remained closely tied to that milieu. Perhaps we should revisit Dutot’s views.\n\nIn fact, in his last writings, Dutot explicitly rejected the idea that he held special animosity against financiers (Dutot [1738] Reference Dutot1935, 2, pp. 290–292). He also strongly condemned the visas and special courts (for which he once worked) that targeted them because “there is a manifest injustice to attempt . . . to take back goods which were only acquired by consent, and in virtue of contracts made with the King himself” (Dutot Reference Dutot1739, pp. 41–42). In his unpublished response to Paris-Duverney (chief architect of the 1721 Visa) he asserted that these operations were motivated by envy at the financiers’ rapid enrichment, and served no good purpose (Dutot [1738] Reference Dutot1935, 2, p. 245).\n\nDutot’s views on financiers were rather nuanced if we look beyond the standard rhetoric. In an extended passage, he explains that “the French have a happy genius for trade; but they apply it to the false branches thereof.” The system of rewards that prevails in French society diverts this happy genius (which we would call entrepreneurial or managerial skill), as well as scarce financial capital, into socially wasteful activities, depriving the French economy from the inputs it needs for growth (Dutot Reference Dutot1739, p. 262).\n\nIV. DUTOT AND LAW’S BANK (1720–1723)\n\nThe next known stage in Dutot’s career is his involvement in John Law’s Bank in 1720. How he got the job is unknown. Even the exact nature of his duties has been shrouded in confusion. In a later text defending his management of the bank and company, Law incidentally mentioned Dutot as a “clerk of the Company in charge of the correspondance with the provincial mint directors” (Law Reference Law1790, p. 417). On a manuscript copy of this text by Dutot, Murphy found a marginal note in which Dutot rejected this identification as incorrect, and claimed to have been the under-treasurer and to have handled all the duties of the general treasury of the bank. Elsewhere, Dutot elaborated that this under-treasurer had been appointed on January 30, 1720, by the treasurer Bourgeois, who did not wish to burden himself any longer with the detail of his position, and that this under-treasurer produced all banknotes and delivered them to the bank’s various cashiers (Murphy Reference Murphy2000, pp. xxv–xxvii; Dutot Reference Dutot2000, p. 370). The original documents suggest a more contentious relation between Dutot and Bourgeois, and a more modest role for Dutot in Law’s Bank than Dutot’s own recollection.\n\nDutot’s Quarrels with Bourgeois\n\nThe liquidation of Law’s Bank and the inventory of the bank’s papers by a specially appointed commission revealed serious quarrels between Dutot and his employer, the treasurer of the Bank Bourgeois.\n\nOn April 23, 1721, the commissioners made a first visit to the bank, where they entered “the place formerly known as the Treasury” and were met by Dutot, whom they described as the clerk in charge of exchanging large for small notes. He presented his ledger, the minutes of the destruction of the exchanged notes, and three bundles of vouchers. He also presented a handwritten list of supporting documents he did not have. He had turned over these orders, signed by Law, to one of the directors of the company to be approved by the Regent. Dutot later obtained the documents (not without some difficulty), but, upon checking the contents of the folder, he found that one was missing. He submitted what he had to the commissioners, returning to them a month later with a rather bizarre story. A Capuchin monk, brother Ange Marie, librarian of the Paris convent, had contacted one of the cashiers of the company, seeking Dutot’s address to see him on a matter “of the greatest import.” The monk brought Dutot the missing order now provided by Dutot to the commissioners, along with a statement by the monk verifying this cloak-and-dagger story. The missing document was an order by Law to purchase thirty shares from the bearer for 240,000 livres, dated December 11, 1720, a week before Law left France.Footnote 41\n\nThe commissioners returned to Dutot’s office on May 8, spending five days on a detailed inventory of Dutot’s documents and of bundles of large-denomination notes that had been exchanged but not yet burned.Footnote 42 On May 13, an extraordinary dispute arose in the presence of the commissioners. Dutot was presenting two bundles each of eight 1000L canceled notes, when the treasurer Bourgeois declared them to be counterfeits. Dutot protested that he could not be held responsible for the loss, explaining the procedure used at the bank to exchange worn notes from the public: the notes were not compared with the registers until after they had been exchanged, and he had been ordered to continue in this fashion when he was assigned to the exchange of large for small notes. Bourgeois replied that it was not his responsibility to examine the contents of Dutot’s account. Dutot then proclaimed that “he had never carried out any operation but under the eyes and on the orders of Mr. Bourgeois whose clerk he was.” Bourgeois then boldly denied having ever given Dutot any order or having put him in charge of that account. Although Bourgeois’ statement seems incredible, it remains that, in the presence of the king’s commissioners, Dutot declined to acknowledge the important responsibilities that he would claim to have exercised when describing himself many years later as an informed insider of the bank.\n\nThe dispute between Dutot and Bourgeois led to another bizarre episode. On September 14, 1721, the Regent having allocated the buildings formerly used by the bank to the King’s Library (Balayé Reference Balayé1988, p. 185), it was necessary to vacate the premises immediately. Accompanied by the bank’s former inspector, Fenellon, and controller, du Revest, Bourgeois went on a Sunday morning to move papers and documents from certain rooms. Later that day, they summoned a police inspector to the bank, telling him the following story.Footnote 43 Sitting down at a desk to write, Bourgeois noticed something hidden under the cloth cover, and found a dozen or more orders to deliver small notes to specified individuals, issued by Landivisiau to the clerks of the bureau in charge of division notes. Thinking that they would be very useful in his dispute with Dutot, Bourgeois, after having shown them to du Revest, left them on the table and went home to fetch some documents. Meanwhile, Dutot, arriving to join in the work and being asked to open the chests of his office, showed that the chests were empty, because he had taken all his papers home. After being rebuked by the inspector for doing so, Dutot took the orders on the table, locked them up in one of his chests, and left the premises without saying a word. Upon learning what had happened, Bourgeois, furious, sent a lackey to summon Dutot. Finding only Dutot’s wife and leaving word with her, the lackey returned. Unable to find Dutot, Bourgeois summoned the inspector and filed a complaint. Recalling that a few weeks earlier, Dutot had asked du Revest for access to these rooms and shown displeasure when told that he could do so only in the presence of Bourgeois and Fenellon, they surmised that Dutot had been trying to lay his hands on the papers.\n\nEven more curiously, a few days later, Bourgeois and du Revest delivered the documents (twenty-two orders dated between July 9 and August 27, 1720, totalling a little over 6.3 million L) to the commissioners, without mentioning Dutot, saying instead that the papers had been found by the bank’s janitor the following Monday.Footnote 44\n\nWhat can we make of this story? The account by Bourgeois to the commissioners is inconsistent with the account to the police inspector, and the latter account does not make complete sense. Nor is it clear why Dutot would want to steal papers needed for submission with his accounts.\n\nThere is no further trace of the dispute between Bourgeois and Dutot. Bourgeois retired a wealthy man, and Dutot’s remark that Bourgeois had appointed him “in order to give himself the leisure of finding ways to preserve his fortune” (Dutot Reference Dutot2000, p. 370) betrays a lingering bitterness.\n\nDutot’s Role in the Bank\n\nDutot’s later claim to have been the under-treasurer of the bank conflicts with the evidence describing him as “entrusted by Bourgeois, treasurer of the Bank, of the receipt and disbursement of the banknotes stamped with the word Division.”Footnote 45 What did that exactly represent?\n\nThe notes stamped “division” were small-denomination notes of 10L and 100L (and later 50L), issued from June 26, 1720, for exchange against large-denomination notes of 1000L and 10,000L. At the time, confidence in Law’s System was already collapsing, and the last thing Law wanted was to be seen to increase the supply of notes. Hence, the orders were that these “division” notes were not to increase the total, but be used only to retire existing notes, which were then burned. The initial issue of 100 million L was supplemented three times, on September 2, 19, and October 13, for a total of 246.84 million L, a little less than 10% of all notes issued (Dutot Reference Dutot2000, p. 372).\n\nThis operation seems quite straightforward, and Dutot’s account ought to have been simple enough to give: on one hand, the small-denomination notes printed, sealed, and issued; on the other, the large-denomination notes canceled and burned. But Law’s text, and Dutot’s marginal note, reveal that there was more.\n\nIn the summer of 1720, while Law’s System was collapsing, the Regent approved a plan to buy back shares of the company on the market using banknotes. The logic of the proposal was that shares were supposed to earn about 4% or 5%, while notes were convertible into 2% bonds, so retiring shares would reduce the burden on the company’s cash flow. This, however, ran against the official policy of reducing the amount of notes in circulation. The plan was kept secret and supervised by Noël Danycan de Landivisiau (1686–1730), a government official who had been appointed with two others to supervise the bank and the company on June 20, 1720.Footnote 46 This share purchase program created many difficulties for Dutot during the liquidation of the bank.\n\nDutot Saved\n\nAfter explaining the share purchase program, Dutot added that it had later been an obstacle to closing his accounts, but that it had been removed without any move on his part, and his account closed as he had presented it (Dutot Reference Dutot2000, p. xxvii). The note leaves one with the impression that Dutot was completely vindicated. Dutot’s accounts were closed, but it took considerable effort, if not on his part.\n\nA better understanding of Dutot’s awkward position can be garnered from a series of memoranda by the Paris brothers in which they detailed how they tried to save the company from assuming the liabilities of the bank and likely bankruptcy.Footnote 47 A total of 260 million small-denomination “division” notes had been authorized, of which 246 million were printed and sealed. To account for them, Dutot had proof that 100 million large-denomination notes had been burned, and he held another 45 million, duly canceled but not yet burned. That left 101 million unaccounted for. These notes, as we know, had been used to purchase shares on the open market. Separately, Dutot had been ordered in September 1720 to take 68.43 million in notes retired in exchange for bank accounts. These notes were also used, on Law’s orders and under the supervision of Landivisiau, to purchase shares. Both operations were perfectly illegal, in direct contravention of the decrees that created the division notes and the bank accounts; and Dutot was now technically accountable for 156,900,500 livres, representing the capital losses incurred on the shares, which were now worth much less than the face value he had paid out in banknotes (another 18.5 million had been directly handed over to the Indies Company).\n\nThe Paris brothers, whose job was to salvage the Indies Company, now saddled with the bank’s liabilities, were not interested in putting the blame on clerks: their goal was to find a clean way to paper over the loss, allowing the Indies Company to disentangle itself from the bank and survive as a going concern. They finally arranged for the company to issue a receipt to Dutot for the amount in question, which Dutot could submit to Bourgeois to render his account, the receipt being folded into the 500 million loss owed by the company to the Crown on account of the bank, ultimately written off by the Crown in 1725. On July 10, 1723, a series of orders were approved by the Regent, instructing various clerks to turn over all their accounts and documents to the company’s archivist, and officially discharging them of their liability. Dutot’s own discharge, dated July 20, was among the papers inventoried at his death. This precious discharge closed that chapter of his life with no detrimental consequences. It is not clear whether Dutot knew how much he owed to the man he would later bitterly debate, Paris-Duverney.Footnote 48\n\nDutot and Law\n\nWe do not know if Law and Dutot had a personal relationship. Law knew his name, and mentioned him in passing in a memorandum on the bank written a few years later (Law Reference Law1790, p. 417). Conversely, we know that Dutot, in his later writings, held Law in high but not uncritical regard. At the time of the System, however, Dutot was much less clear-eyed.\n\nThe d’Argenson archives in Poitiers contain a lengthy manuscript by Dutot dating from mid-March 1720.Footnote 49 Titled Réflexions sur le nouveau Système des finances, it is an enthusiastic defense of the System and its chances of survival, and must have circulated because a hitherto unidentified copy is in the archives of the French Foreign Ministry.Footnote 50 “I know that I am blamed for having as a maxim carefully to praise what is praiseworthy in the present government, to excuse what can be excused, and to say also what could be added to make it more perfect.” It was clearly a first draft, since he expected comments from friends, but he argued that confidence in the System must be shored up right away, and its transitory inconveniences looked over in view of the long-term benefits it would ultimately provide. He fully endorsed Law’s views that money creation will stimulate the economy, that paper money is preferable to metallic money, which should be banned, and that shares are a superior form of money since they pay dividends. Lack of confidence would disappear when Frenchmen became used to paper money. He explained away incipient inflation by special factors such as the influx of foreigners in Paris or the bad harvests of 1719, and argued that increased prosperity will more than compensate for the rise in prices, which would be limited by competition. He was not concerned by the revolutionary aspects of the System: change is not always bad, the general good must be preferred over private interests. Caution is advisable when conflicting interests need to be reconciled, but when authority is concentrated, there is no reason to delay.\n\nThe text clearly shows how fully Dutot embraced the program of Law, without reservations. Dutot was thirty-five years old at the time, young enough to be durably impressed by this “genius of the first order,” as he calls him. Only with hindsight did Dutot become more critical of Law.\n\nDid Dutot Profit from the System?\n\nThe aftermath of Law’s System had, for Dutot as well as for hundreds of thousands of Frenchmen, direct consequences. Part of Law’s scheme had been to convert the national debt into shares of the Indies Company; the scheme began to unravel in June 1720, and the government issued new perpetual annuities to begin absorbing the mass of notes and bonds issued by Law, followed by life annuities in August 1720. The subscription to these annuities remained open until January 1721, when the process was halted. Rather than repudiate the debt, the government decided to implement a plan devised by the Paris brothers: all holders of the liabilities of the System were to submit claims to a Visa, or inspection, at the end of which they would either be issued certificates convertible into annuities, or else their existing annuities would be reduced. The rate of conversion or reduction depended on the size of the holdings and the way in which they had been acquired (Velde Reference Velde and Caselli2008).\n\nDutot invested in government annuities in late October and early November 1720. On October 20, he spent 50,000 livres to purchase 1250 livres in perpetual annuities. He did this through an intermediary, who promptly stated in a private document of the same day that the true owners of the sum were Dutot and his wife.Footnote 51 Then, on October 21 and November 14, his wife bought four life annuities of 1000 livres each, for a total price of 100,000 livres.Footnote 52 Both the life and the perpetual annuities were submitted to the Visa and reduced in October 1722 by half. The life annuities were further reduced, like all others, in May 1727 by one-sixth.Footnote 53 This left Dutot and his wife with 1667 livres in life annuities and 625 livres in perpetual annuities, providing him with sufficient income to live comfortably. In his last writings, Dutot declared that he owned only government annuities, and no shares (Dutot [1738] Reference Dutot1935, 2, p. 236; and Dutot Reference Dutot2000, p. 262). This assertion was not quite accurate. Aside from the life annuity, he owned a small life annuity of 55 livres obtained through the Indies Company’s so-called composite lottery of 1724.Footnote 54 Tickets for the lottery could be purchased with 300L and two-tenths of shares of the Indies Company. Some tickets won prizes either in cash or in life annuities; the other tickets (such as Dutot’s) received 55 livres in life annuity.\n\nDutot thus had 150,000 livres in cash to invest in October and November 1720. This is a sizeable sum. We also know from his inventory that on March 12, 1721, Dutot deposited 100,000 livres in banknotes with his friend, the banker Pierre Romet, acknowledging that the real value of these notes was only 13,960 livres. The market value of notes on that date was about 7% of face value, so it is likely that the deposit was actually made earlier, at the end of November 1720, when notes were worth around 14%.Footnote 55 But by March 1721, it was too late to invest the notes in annuities, the subscription having closed in January. Dutot was presumably anxious not to be found holding this large sum in cash, and the banker Romet, by the nature of his business, could more easily account for it than could Dutot.\n\nHow did Dutot acquire 250,000L in cash? Certainly not from the wages of a bank clerk!Footnote 56 The fact that the perpetual and life annuities were reduced by half in 1722 indicates that they fell in one of two categories defined by the rules of the Visa. The 150,000 livres that Dutot used to purchase them came either from real estate (land, houses, or offices) sold after September 1719, or from sale of personal estate, shop inventories, repayments on bills of exchange, or debt reimbursements made before 1719, or, finally, specie brought to the bank or the mints during 1720, a rather vague category requiring no documentation and used by many who could not otherwise account for their wealth.Footnote 57 This leaves the origin of Dutot’s cash in the dark. We may well believe his claim that he received no favors from John Law: “my situation is proof that admits of no reply” (Dutot Reference Dutot2000, p. 178). But when Paris-Duverney said that “cashiers and clerks of the Bank have enriched themselves,” Dutot did not deny it, replying, however, that, if they had, “it was by means permitted and authorized by the government, none were found guilty of corruption in court” (Dutot [1738] Reference Dutot1935, 2, p. 246), perhaps speaking on his own behalf. We can at least say that, unlike Melon, Dutot was not ruined by the System.\n\nV. LATER LIFE (1723–1741)\n\nDutot lived eighteen years after the bank’s affairs were wound up. During the 1720s, his circle of acquaintances remained surprisingly unchanged from his days as an associate of Boudard. It is only with time that he became what one might call an intellectual, retired from the world of financial affairs, increasingly trying to make his mark on policy through his writings.\n\nThe Société des Arts\n\nAs men age, the company they keep can change. This may well have been the case for Dutot, as one curious item in his library suggests. It is a copy of the bylaws of the Société des Arts, dated 1730.\n\nResulting from the association of the mathematicians, Jean-Baptiste Clairaut and his brilliant son Alexis (1713–65), with the clockmaker Julien Le Roy and the instrument maker Jacques Lemaire,Footnote 58 this society intended to bring together scientists and craftsmen, and promote the application of mathematics and physics to the mechanical arts. Dutot’s library, containing the works of a few members (Bélidor’s Cours d’architecture, de Gua’s Usage de l’Analyse de Descartes of 1740, Arbuthnot’s Table of Ancient Coins, Weights and Measures of 1727), perfectly reflects this confluence of interests.\n\nIt was formally organized in November 1728, with different grades of membership. Dutot was admitted as a “free associate” on December 8, 1728, curiously describing himself to the society as a “mechanic” (mécanicien). This is less surprising than it might sound. On the top floor, next to the attic, Dutot had installed a small laboratory where he kept his collection of mathematical and optical instruments, and turning tools: a terrestrial and a celestial globe made by de L’Isle; models of the Copernican and Ptolemaic systems, an equatorial machine (machine parallactique), and a plane table with its compass, all made by Chapotot, a prominent maker of instruments; three microscopes, rulers, and compasses; tools for grinding and polishing lenses; and turning tools. Dutot’s mathematical instruments were appraised after his death by Jacques Lemaire, founding member of the society.\n\nDutot’s interest in clockmaking was manifest. He had a translation of William Derham’s treatise on clockmaking in his library, and several timepieces, all made by members of the society, a small clock made by Le Roy, another clock with chimes and two hands, and a pocket watch made by Dutertre. The latter was also a creditor of Dutot’s estate for an expensive répétiteur d’or (repeating circle in gold) delivered in 1737.Footnote 59\n\nThe surviving minutes of the society indicate that Dutot was active in 1729 and 1730, participating in a committee to vet applicants and searching for a new meeting place. The society’s activities did not last beyond 1736. One can nevertheless imagine that Dutot was well apprised of the great scientific expedition that took place that year in Lapland to measure the Earth’s circumference (Badinter Reference Badinter2003). Led by René Moreau de Maupertuis, nephew of Dutot’s acquaintance Moreau de La Primeraye, and including two members of the society (Alexis Clairaut and the Swedish scientist Anders Celsius), it was an admirable instance of scientific advances through high-precision measurement.\n\nWe know of one paper that Dutot read to the society: Harsin (Reference Harsin1946) found in Douai a manuscript titled “Mémoire sur les foiblages et les écharcetez” with the mention “read on July 2, 1731.” Harsin interpreted this to mean that it had been read before an unknown (to him) learned society, surely the Société des Arts. Dutot included the substance of the paper as a rather strange digression in his manuscript history of the System (Dutot Reference Dutot2000, pp. 144–161). It was an attack on a clause of a monetary edict of December 1719, granting to the directors of the mint a fourth of the amounts by which coins minted were found to be underweight or lacking in purity (these deficiencies were known as faiblage and écharceté, respectively). At the same time, the edict allowed the directors to submit certificates signed by the director general of the mints as evidence of those amounts. Dutot correctly observed that it was an invitation to fraud that could not fail to be accepted, and he cited the details of a case of embezzlement at the Montpellier mint in the 1720s. Having colluded to commit fraud, mint officials attempted to buy the silence of an honest colleague and, failing to do so, arranged for him to be falsely charged and convicted.Footnote 60 The man Dutot implicitly attacked as author of the offending clause, Pierre Grassin (1689–1762), had been director general of the mints since 1717 and an early investor in Law’s Company of the West (Lüthy 1959–61, 2, p. 787; Giraud Reference Giraud1974, p. 96). The attack must have been noticed since an official of the Paris mint, named Renard du Tasta, belonged to the society.\n\nDutot’s role in the society is particularly interesting, given that François Quesnay was admitted into the society in February 1730. The physician’s interests in economics are believed to date from 1756, when he laid the foundations of physiocracy. We now have an intriguing link between Dutot and the flowering of French economic theory in the second half of the eighteenth century.\n\nThis role also shows that Dutot was no hermit. Though lacking in the brilliance and lively witticism that Dutot seemed to appreciate in print, the society provided him an opportunity to meet with kindred spirits, analytical minds, and connoisseurs of careful craftsmanship and exquisite mechanics.\n\nWritings\n\nBy the late 1720s, Dutot was retired. The inventory of his papers yields no evidence of any employment or active investment. Having lost his shares in the Indies Company to Firnkrans, he did not replace them, leaving his financial wealth in government annuities. He did not remain idle, but set to work on writing a history of the System and its aftermath.\n\nThe scope of his project is apparent from a provisional title he scribbled on a sheet:Footnote 61 “Recherches, Réflexions, Considérations politiques sur les opérations de finances faites en France pendant le sistème de M Law qui ne commencent à proprement parler que le 10 avril 1717, et sur leurs influences (sur les effets produis par ces opérations) sur le change étranger et conséquemment sur notre commerce, poussées jusques à la fabrication des monnoyes ordonnée par édit du mois d’aoust 1723, ainsi elles contiennent six années trois mois et quelques jours.” The lengthy title gives both the time frame he was considering (April 1717 to August 1723) and the narrative device he intended to use; namely, the course of foreign exchange, which he called “the true barometer of trade” (Dutot Reference Dutot2000, p. 399). The starting point was the time when the notes of John Law’s Bank became legal tender for public dues. The end point was the recoinage of August 1723, soon after the end of the Visa and the Indies Company’s exit from receivership.\n\nDutot never finished this history.Footnote 62 The manuscript ends somewhat abruptly with the events of December 1720, when he ceased to be a close observer of events. Moreover, some insertions and digressions still had not been smoothed out (Dutot Reference Dutot2000, p. 163, where Dutot details the benefits of the System in the future tense), and he was adding to it in 1735 (Dutot Reference Dutot2000, p. 98). As Murphy (Reference Murphy2000, XL) argues, Dutot was diverted from his opus by the famous controversy with Melon and Paris-Duverney.\n\nIn 1734, Jean-François Melon (1675–1738) published his Essai politique sur le commerce, an enlarged edition appearing in June 1736. Melon had served as an advisor of Law and later of the duc d’Orléans and the duc de Bourbon, who were prime ministers from 1723 to 1726. His book, partly based on memorials he wrote during his service, defended monetary mutations, arguing that inflation properly favored debtors over creditors. Learning of Dutot’s disagreement, Melon wrote to him at the end of 1734, suggesting that Dutot put his objections in writing. Dutot agreed and wrote three letters to Melon in early September 1735, expanding them in early 1736. The Douai library holds an early draft of the resulting work, dating from 1736 (Harsin Reference Harsin1946). With Melon’s knowledge and implicit encouragement,Footnote 63 Dutot then decided to publish it, arranging the printing himself with Vaillant and Prévost, publishers in The Hague of French Protestant extraction. Dutot contracted with the bookseller Jacques Rollin fils for the sale, Dutot receiving 5L for each copy sold (the book sold for 6L). The last page came out of the printing press on the day of Melon’s death, January 24, 1738, and on February 10, Dutot delivered to his bookseller 987 copies on premium paper and 529 copies on regular paper. Of these 1516 copies, 420 were in Dutot’s apartment at his death.Footnote 64\n\nThe book, published anonymously, was immediately noticed. Guyot-Desfontaines (1738–40, 12, pp. 163–165; 12, pp. 241–264; 13, pp. 49–72; 13, pp. 289–305) announced it on February 22, reviewing it extensively and effusively, noting with approval the native pride of his fellow Norman. The Journal de Trévoux reviewed it and praised it at length (May 1738, pp. 895–932; June 1738, p. 1029). Voltaire published his commentary in the periodical Le Pour et Contre (15, pp. 296–312), whose editor had defended Melon (Prévost d’Exiles 1738–40, 15, pp. 25–42; 15, pp. 296–312; 15, pp. 313–317). The Journal des Sçavans summarized the book in its August 1738 issue (pp. 471–481). All reviews named the author.\n\nIn substance, Dutot’s book is a rejection of Melon’s views on inflation on empirical grounds. To prove the damage caused by monetary mutations, he used his “barometer” (the course of foreign exchange) from the recoinage of 1709 (when his career with Boudard began) to the monetary stabilization in June 1726. But he left a gap, skipping from April 10, 1717, to August 1723 (Dutot [1738] Reference Dutot1935, 1, p. 196), explaining that “it would be no easy matter to draw certain light from the course of the exchange in that time.” This somewhat disingenuous statement suggests Dutot’s intent to leave the System entirely out of his reply to Melon, expecting to publish separately a history of the System, the Recherches sur les opérations de finance from 1717 to 1723. Indeed, the 1736 draft of the Réflexions in Douai leaves the System entirely aside.\n\nBut, for reasons that are unclear, Dutot made two major additions (Dutot [1738] Reference Dutot1935, 1, pp. 71–111, 252–264) composed almost entirely of material from his unfinished Recherches. Perhaps a sign of regret, both additions were deleted from the English translation of 1739. The additions defended Law’s System and attacked the policies that followed in its aftermath; namely, the recreation of the public debt during the Visa of 1721–22. In doing so, he severely criticized the work of the Paris brothers, advisers of the government of the duc de Bourbon until the latter fell in June 1726.\n\nThe Paris brothers, with an eye to posterity, extensively documented their activities (Velde Reference Velde and Caselli2008). Paris-Duverney had prepared an unpublished apology of the Visa.Footnote 65 But Dutot’s direct attack could not remain unanswered. Duverney had returned in favor with the government and Voltaire’s review announced that a rejoinder was forthcoming from a “statesman.” Written by François-Michel Chrétien-Deschamps, it appeared in in August 1740. Acerbic in tone, it followed Dutot’s book page by page and disputed many specific facts and figures, as well as the general apology for Law’s System and some of Dutot’s general propositions. Deschamps’ book was also reviewed, respectfully in the Journal des Sçavans and the Journal de Trévoux, approvingly in Prévost d’Exiles (1738–40, 20, pp. 296–329), and objectively in Guyot-Desfontaines (1738–40, 23, pp. 73–87; 23, pp. 265–279; 24, pp. 241–249). Never afraid to take on a powerful enemy, Dutot was soon hard at work composing a response, intended to be final, but death prevented him from having it published. The completed manuscript was found and published by Harsin (Reference Harsin1935b).\n\nThe Trip to London\n\nNothing else is known of his activities, except for his trip to London in 1739 and 1740. The trip has been known through a letter from Dutot to an unnamed correspondent dated from London, December 31, 1739 (Arsenal 4745, fol. 89–90; published by Mann Reference Mann1935). Murphy (Reference Murphy2000, pp. xxx–xxxiii) also uncovered further archival evidence of this London visit, confirming that Dutot had been entertained and even lodged by the French ambassador for several weeks. One reason for the trip was the publication in April 1739 of a translation of Dutot’s book, which was reviewed by several English newspapers (Guyot-Desfontaines [1738–40, 19, pp. 303–309] also announced it on November 14 and cited the translator’s preface). One review, in The Craftsman of December 15, 1739, was deemed of sufficient importance to be translated and sent to the cardinal Fleury, and the ministers of foreign affairs and the navy, mostly because the reviewer viewed Dutot’s proposal to build a military port at La Hougue as a direct military threat to Britain.\n\nBut Dutot had other motives. We know from the letter that his stay (at least several months) was longer than he had expected, because he wished to “make a provision” of the useful knowledge he had found. We know what form this took: Harsin (Reference Harsin1946, p. 20), while perusing a copy of Bishop Fleetwood’s Chronicon Preciosum (1707) at the French National library, discovered an annotation in Dutot’s own hand, dated October 6, 1739, in London: “This book is very rare; it is the only one I have found in over one hundred booksellers I have visited.” Besides this rarity, Dutot purchased dozens of books while in London. The French ambassador’s letter states that Dutot’s purpose was to study England’s trade and finances, and, indeed, most of the books he purchased concern these matters. French authorities could only approve of such intelligence gathering, war between Great Britain and Spain having broken out in October while Dutot was in London, a war that France would join in 1741. Assessing Great Britain’s capacity to sustain the struggle financially was critical for French policymakers.\n\nDutot was also interested in the past. Documents in the d’Argenson archives show that he called on Law’s daughter and her husband Lord Wallingford: there is a slip of paper stating in English that “Lord Wallingford lives in the middle of Grosvenor Street at the two round lamps.” During this visit, Dutot was allowed to make copies of Law’s correspondence after 1721.Footnote 66 He also probably acquired copies of Law’s early writings, which he would quote extensively (and without attribution) in his manuscript response to Duverney written after the trip, while the Réflexions politiques cited only published works of Law.Footnote 67 The French ambassador died in February, and Lord Wallingford died abruptly on June 6, 1740. We do not know when Dutot returned to Paris, but probably not before April.Footnote 68\n\nFinal Illness\n\nDutot’s final manuscript shows that he was still working on it in May 1741 (Dutot [1738] Reference Dutot1935, 2, p. 168). His final illness must have been long and painful, and involved medication and surgery. This we may infer from the debts his widow acknowledged to the physician Dumolin, probably Jacques Molin or Dumoulin (1667–1755), consulting physician to the king (État de la France 1736, 1, p. 353), “for the calls he made to the deceased during his final illness”; to the apothecary Rissoan for his prescriptions; and to Gilles-Bertrand Pibrac (1693–1771), then surgeon to the duke of Orléans (État de la France 1736, 2, p. 396) and later chief surgeon of the Royal Military School and director of the Academy of Surgery. Dutot clearly could afford as good medical care as one could get in Paris at the time.\n\nDutot died in the morning of September 12, 1741, three weeks short of his fifty-seventh birthday. Arriving at the apartment on the rue Croix des Petits-Champs at Marianne Marchand’s request around half-past one in the afternoon, an official of the Châtelet de Paris was shown the body on the deathbed and began the inventory. Two weeks later, the seals were removed and a complete inventory of the contents of Dutot’s lodging was carried out by notaries, in the presence of the widow and of Thomas Gueullette, a famous attorney of the time (Gueullette Reference Gueullette1938), representing Dutot’s only heir, his brother Jean-Charles.Footnote 69 The inventory took two weeks to complete, sorting and listing the books alone taking the bookseller Jean Boudot four days. The costs of Dutot’s funeral were advanced by his brother-in-law François Polisse. Dutot left no will, his brother possibly inheriting his assets while his wife claimed her dotage, a paltry sum of 1000 livres specified by the marriage contract. I have no found no information about the fate of Dutot’s wife.Footnote 70\n\nDutot’s wealth at death can be estimated from the after-death inventory. The total value of the moveable estate was estimated at about 12,000 livres, 5000L in books (although, as we will see, their sale brought nearly twice as much), 2000L in silverware, and the rest in furniture and clothing (the instruments were valued only at 350 livres). Among the books were 420 copies of Dutot’s work, unbound and ready for sale, valued at 1 livre each. Dutot owned no real estate. The financial wealth is a little harder to estimate. We have seen that he owned 1667 livres in life annuities and 625 livres in perpetual annuities. The latter can be valued at 40% of face value, or 10,000 livres.Footnote 71 The life annuity on a forty-five-year-old woman, based on Deparcieux’s mortality tables and the discount rate implicit in the price of the perpetual annuity, would be worth 18,600 livres. This puts Dutot’s financial wealth at 28,600 livres (or 4000L higher if the books are counted at their market value). Dutot ([1738] Reference Dutot1935, 1, p. 108) said that “as regards fortune it is apparent by my state and condition that I am not of those she favors.” This is nevertheless more than twenty times the wealth of his parents, a remarkable testimony to his social ascension.\n\nThe Slide into Semi-Oblivion\n\nDutot’s fame, such as it was, became partly anonymous.\n\nAfter Dutot’s death, his Réflexions were published several times: in 1743, with his name for the first time in 1754–55, and in 1760. The controversy remained a reference for a generation, but lost its importance because of the progress of economic thought, and also because after decades of monetary stability, the main debate between Melon and Dutot became moot. The value of Dutot’s work as historian of Law’s System was intermittently recognized, Thiers (Reference Thiers and Guizot1826, p. 80) calling his observations “undoubtedly the most profound there is on Law’s System and the causes of its fall,” and (Levasseur 1854) citing him abundantly. Nevertheless, by the time Eugène Daire brought Dutot out of obscurity in 1843 with a partial reprint of the Réflexions in his collection of economists, he could admit only complete ignorance of any particulars about the author.\n\nEven Dutot’s first name was lost to posterity, resulting in a strange confusion between Dutot and Charles Ferrare, son of Pierre Ferrare of Italian origin, and a member of the Parlement of Rouen who died in 1694 (de Frondeville and Monville 1960–64, 4, p. 248; L’Estourmy Reference L’Estourmy1999, p. 576). This Charles Ferrare had bought a fief called Le Tot in the Norman parish of Gonfreville-la-Caillot in 1659, and was, therefore, known as the sieur du Tot or Charles Ferrare du Tot.Footnote 72 The obituary of this man of letters in the Journal de Trévoux (July 1702, pp. 40–44) attributes to him a description of the papal court published in 1663 under the pseudonym of Angelo Corraro. The bibliographer Quérard (1826–1842, 3, p. 111) also attributed to him Dutot’s Réflexions Politiques, despite being published seventy-five years later. The confusion propagated into reference works and into the catalogues of the British Museum and the French Bibliothèque nationale. At some point “Ferrare” was assumed to be a second given name, and the author of the Réflexions was identified as Charles Dutot. Harsin (Reference Harsin1935b, 1, p. xi) noted the identification with bemusement, but could not refute it. Although the confusion has since been purged from the catalogues of the British Library and Bibliothèque nationale, it persists in the literature to this day.\n\nVI. DUTOT AND HIS BOOKS\n\nIn Dutot’s library, we find enough material to sketch an intellectual portrait of the man.Footnote 73 The library contained 1662 distinct titles, for a total of 3479 volumes, appraised at 4500L (excluding Dutot’s stock of his Réflexions). The sale brought 9725 livres. This is a sizeable library, especially in relation to Dutot’s wealth (40% of his personal estate). For the period 1750 to 1759, Marion (1978, p. 118) found that 237 Parisian libraries listed in after-death inventories averaged 1084 volumes and 1700L in estimated value. We can also compare the number of volumes and appraised value with that of his two public rivals. Jean-François Melon left 448 volumes valued at 1163 livres; the inventory of Chrétien-Deschamps’ library counted 1365 volumes and appraised them at 1700 livres; in the public sale, 511 titles (1385 volumes) sold for 4300 livres.Footnote 74 The philosopher d’Holbach, nephew of Dutot’s acquaintance but much richer than Dutot, had his library appraised in January 1756 at 8500L for nearly 3000 volumes. Finally, the books that have been traced to Adam Smith’s library represent 1580 titles (Mizuta Reference Mizuta1967, p. xi).\n\nThe majority of his books (60%, or 65% if adjusting for book size and number of volumes) concerned history and geography. The main focus, not surprisingly, is French history (434 titles, or 41% of all books), with 38 books on the later Middle Ages (to 1500), 15 books on the first half of the sixteenth century, and 52 books on the second half, which covers the Wars of Religion. The reigns of the first three Bourbon kings are covered by 165 titles, with 21 titles for the War of Spanish Succession alone. Dutot’s collection of French histories followed closely the path of French historiography. But he found it important to read original sources: contemporary chronicles, memoirs and letters, chronologies, pamphlets, collections of original documents (recueil de pièces). He was not, however, a pure antiquarian, and must have been receptive to the so-called “historical Pyrrhonism” of Vallemont, Johann Burchard Mencke, and Bayle, whose works he owned. The Wars of Religion (down to the siege of La Rochelle) clearly fascinated him, and he had accounts and sources from all sides. By the mid-seventeenth century, the focus of his books turns to European politics and the wars of Louis XIV. Here again, we see in Dutot a very eclectic approach, as shown by his two copies of the Protestant Isaac de Larrey’s Histoire du Règne de Louis XIV. Dutot was an avid collector of the anti-French (and often forbidden) pamphlets churned out of the Netherlands to denounce Louis XIV’s expansionist foreign policy.\n\nDutot’s religious history section is sizeable, but betrays an anti-clerical bent. He was interested in, but no friend of, the Jesuits; holy orders or the papal court appear only as a source of gossip or examples of prurient misbehavior.\n\nThe bulk of religious history concerns the Reformation, the counter-Reformation, and the internal debates of the French church over Gallicanism and Jansenism (ten titles each). This is not surprising, given the focus of the historical section on the Wars of Religion and their aftermath. On closer look, however, we find that while the history of Protestantism was covered by twenty titles, nearly half the books on religion (twenty-seven books) were apologetic works, almost all from the Protestant side, many touching the repeal of the Edict of Nantes. It is striking to see that 52% of the titles on religion had imprints from the Low Countries or Germany, compared with 26% for the library as a whole.\n\nThe focus on the history of the French wars of religion and on Protestantism is intriguing, particularly since the library is otherwise sparsely furnished in metaphysics, theology, or piety.Footnote 75 We find only one copy of the New Testament in French, and another in English, which he bought in London. What little he had in theology did not come from the most orthodox writers. On scriptures, we find only pamphlets from contemporary scholarly controversies. The book on patristics by Louis Ellies Dupin, a staunch Gallican who ran afoul of Bossuet (whose attack on Dupin was in the library), was prohibited, and Adrien Baillet’s works on hagiography were condemned by the Vatican. The inspirational literature is a scant and odd assortment: La Vallière’s Réflexions sur la Miséricorde de Dieu, the Jansenist Du Guet’s Traité de la prière publique, and a translation of the Anglican Richard Allestree’s The Whole Duty of Man.\n\nDid Dutot have Protestant sympathies? That all of his family’s baptisms and burials appear in the local parish registers indicates that they were Catholics in good standing. But there were Protestant communities in lower Normandy, including nearby La Haye du Puits and Glatigny (Cauvin Reference Cauvin1968). The local lord of Barneville, Adrien du Saussey, who was godfather of Dutot’s sister, was baptized at age twenty-three, perhaps indicating a conversion.\n\nDutot collected almost dutifully one or two general works on each French province, with a spark of interest for Normandy, of course. In foreign history, the largest section covers England, although nothing before the Tudors and mostly the events of the Civil War and the Glorious Revolution. The Low Countries and United Provinces are very well covered, the other countries reasonably so. Dutot also owned thirty books on genealogy, nobility, and heraldry.\n\nGeography and travel are also well covered: we find several atlases, including Joan Blaeu’s famous Atlas Maior of 1661 in twelve volumes, and a portfolio of 102 maps by Guillaume de L’Isle. These two titles alone accounted for 10% of the receipts when the library was sold, the former selling for 902 livres and the latter for 155 livres. As with French regional history, Dutot systematically collected sample descriptions of European countries. The collection is much deeper when it comes to the Indies, both East and West, with about thirty titles for each. Dutot’s writings make clear his strong interest in trade and colonization, which he considered essential for economic growth.\n\nThe largest group after history consists of literature and philosophy, and reveals interesting choices. While Dutot had a good collection of classic historians (all translated), he showed little interest in the classics. He had the standard reference books and a choice selection of French writers and poets, but each represented by one title or collected volume. It is among the (now) lesser-known writers of the seventeenth century that Dutot reveals a strong affinity for independent minds: Guillaume du Vair, La Mothe Le Vayer, Naudé, Patin, Richard Simon. We find also several Norman authors: three books of Saint-Évremond (whose birthplace was less than forty miles away from Barneville), Segrais, Jean-François Sarasin. There is some literary criticism and polemic, and a large collection of witticisms and bons mots, the so-called “Ana” that abounded in the second half of the seventeenth century in imitation of the Scaligeriana. Rather than novels, Dutot liked to read fables, tales, and satires, and other whimsical works in the tradition of Rabelais and Verville.\n\nIn philosophy, as in literature, we find few classics. Dutot’s clear favorite among the moderns was Descartes, with six distinct titles; one also finds Malebranche, Bacon, Locke, Pascal, Bayle, a volume of Leibnitz and Newton, and several works by the Protestant pastor Crousaz. Spinoza’s works are absent but there was a biography of him, alongside biographies of Descartes and Edmond Richer (both by Baillet). Moralists and essayists are well represented, with several editions of Montaigne, La Rochefoucauld, La Bruyère, and Gracián. Dutot’s philosophical tastes, not surprisingly, were analytical and moral rather than purely metaphysical, with a strong tinge of criticism and empiricism.\n\nThe collection of books on politics is extensive. There were several books on the education of princes, treatises on ambassadors, ministers, courtiers. Recent works included La Jonchère’s Système d’un Nouveau Gouvernement and several works by his fellow Norman Charles-Irénée Castel de Saint-Pierre (which straddle politics and economics). The collection was completed with various works on the French monarchy and the king’s rights, many grounding the king’s authority as a bulwark against civil strife and reflecting Dutot’s interest in the Wars of Religion.\n\nGiven Dutot’s role in the history of economic thought, the books on economics deserve particular attention. The collection might seem relatively thin, but (setting aside the books in English purchased late in his life) his readings were restricted to texts in French, and the publishing of economics was still limited (Théré Reference Théré and Faccarello1998). Of what could be properly called political economy, there are two copies of Montchrétien’s Traité de l’œconomie politique, a 1700 translation of Thomas Mun’s Treasure by Foreign Trade, Jean Le Pelletier’s Mémoires pour le rétablissement du commerce en France (1701), the French translation of Law’s Money and Trade Considered (1720), and Melon’s Essay politique sur le Commerce (1734). It is rather surprising not to find a copy of Paris-Duverney’s Examen of Dutot’s book, given that Dutot’s manuscript reply follows his “censor’s” text page by page. Another missing work is Bodin’s response to Malestroit, cited by Dutot in his publication (Dutot [1738] Reference Dutot1935, 1, p. 117).\n\nIn public finance, we find Le Secret des Finances de France by Nicolas Fromenteau (1581), Le Denier Royal by Scipion de Gramont (1620), Le Guidon des finances by Vincent Geslée (1644), Vauban’s Projet d’une Dixme Royale and the commentaries by Guérin de Rademont (1715), and Pottier de La Hestroye (1716); all of which he mined for quantitative information on France’s population and income in his Réflexions. Dutot had copies of a Mémoire sur les tailles and a Mémoires concernant les tailles (1721), both authored by Jacques Auber, Boudard’s predecessor as farmer of the Strasbourg revenues.\n\nThe books on coinage include Budel’s classic collection of tracts on money (1591), a summary of the medieval thought, and Nicolas de Coquerel’s Conférence des Monnoyes de France (1619), which tracks the changes in the nominal value of gold and silver, and describes “the damage to the realm from the increase in their price.” The Traité des Monnoyes by Henry Poullain ([1620] 1709) analyzes monetary questions from the same time period, also criticizing monetary manipulations. Used as primary sources for the Réflexions, the treatises by Le Blanc (1680; two copies) and Boizard (1714) are reference works without analysis. There were also a packet of pamphlets on public finance and another on coinage, whose contents unfortunately were not described, copies of the mint ordinances of 1566 and 1577, and several tables of coinage. Practical books on foreign exchange and banking were numerous: Savary’s Parfait Négociant (but not the Dictionnaire universel de commerce), Ricard, Damoreau (two copies, from 1727), Irson, Barrême, Matthieu La Porte, as well as a couple of theologians’ tracts on foreign exchange by Le Correur and Carrel, and on lotteries by Pierre de Joncourt and Jean de La Placette.\n\nWe find a few titles that relate to economics and suggest Dutot’s interest in data collection. One is a manuscript titled État des Grains vendus à Paris en 1724, 1725, 1726 & 1727. This is easily recognized as a copy of a manuscript compilation of biweekly market prices, cited by Dutot ([1738] Reference Dutot1935, 2, p. 78) in his rejoinder to Paris-Duverney, called by Kaplan (Reference Kaplan1984, p. 295) “the Delalande registers.” They survive in Bibliothèque de l’Institut, Paris, mss. 513–521, with the year 1724 now missing, the series continuing to 1733. These data were an important source for Dutot in assessing the impact of monetary manipulations on the price level (Velde Reference Velde2009) by computing a price index as an unweighted average of prices.\n\nOn the subject of index numbers, Bishop Fleetwood’s Chronicon Preciosum (1707) was an early attempt to collect prices for various commodities over long periods of time. The presence of this work by Fleetwood, often credited with first computing a price index, in Dutot’s library might seem to corroborate the claim. But, aside from the fact that Dutot acquired the book in 1739, after writing his pioneering work, the claim is mistaken. Although Fleetwood did assert that £5 in 1460 would represent as much wealth in 1460 as £20 in 1707 if either sum purchased the same basket of five quarters of wheat, four hogsheads of beer, and six yards of cloth, he added: “I do not mean hereby to pre-judge this to be the proportion,” and, in fact, did not attempt to compute such a weighted price index because his only purpose was to show that £5 was worth less in 1707 than in 1460. To compare prices over long periods of time, Fleetwood computed twenty-year averages of commodities prices, and noted that the growth rates of prices varied across commodities, but he did not aggregate them (Fleetwood Reference Fleetwood1707, pp. 61, 167). By contrast, Dutot valued a constant basket of goods at two different dates, and took the ratio to deflate in real terms the French king’s revenues (Dutot [1738] Reference Dutot1935, 1, p. 135). In this respect, Dutot was a true innovator.\n\nWe also note the Cours des Changes et effets commerçables qui se sont négociés à la Bourse pendant l’année 1730 et 1731 (two volumes, 12mo), a tantalizing title given our lack of reliable sources for foreign exchange and bond market prices before 1745 (Velde and Weir Reference Velde and Weir1992). Dutot’s writings amply demonstrate his interest in foreign exchange quotations and securities prices, and provide an unparalleled source on foreign exchange in the early years of the eighteenth century. His writings also show that he had either Giraudeau’s compilation of securities prices during the System or another similar compilation (Murphy Reference Murphy2000, p. xxxviii), but there is no trace of it in the catalogue. Giraudeau’s compilation, like the Delalande registers, resulted from a deliberate effort by the government in the 1720s, probably under the influence of the Paris brothers, to collect economic data. Another interesting manuscript, titled État de baptêmes et mariages de la ville de Paris, probably contained the data that appear in various surviving manuscripts (see Charlot and Dupâquier Reference Charlot and Dupâquier1967), and recalls two English-language books in the library, Petty’s Essays in Political Arithmetick (1699) and John Graunt’s Natural and political observations made upon the bills of mortality (1676).\n\nThe mathematical section, alongside very elementary texts or practical works written for bankers, goes into Cartesian geometry, algebra, and analysis, works by leading French mathematicians of the time. He was clearly keeping abreast of the most recent developments in mathematics. But scientific books outside mathematics are limited to two topics. One is measurement and observation (astronomy, gnomonics, measurement of surfaces, optics). The other is navigation: fluid dynamics, shipbuilding, and nautics (including four copies of Jean Bernoulli’s Théorie de la Manœuvre des Vaisseaux). To the end, Dutot remained a Norman raised on the shores of the sea by a shipwright, fascinated by navigation.\n\nDutot’s collection of periodicals was remarkable, totaling nearly 680 volumes. He had a complete run of the Gazette de France from 1631 to 1722, La Connoissance des Temps, La Clef des temps, the Mercure François, the Lettres historiques, and La Clef du Cabinet des Princes. He had Bayle’s Nouvelles de la République des Lettres, the Journal de Trévoux, Le Journal Littéraire, Les Nouvelles Littéraires, and the literary periodicals of Le Clerc, Basnage, and de La Roche. He also had the Journal des Sçavans, L’Europe Sçavante, and the Mémoires of the Academy of Sciences. Curiously, we do not find the Gazette d’Amsterdam or any other Dutch periodical, although the bookseller Boudot collected fourteen volumes of miscellaneous gazettes into a packet without detailing the contents.\n\nBoudot also collected together the foreign-language books, about fifty titles, nearly all in English: works by John Locke, Josiah Child, William Petty, John Graunt, Francis Brewster, Thomas Baston, William Wood; works on the history of English coinage by Charles Arbuthnot, Martin Folkes, and William Fleetwood; books from the time of the recoinage of 1695 by Locke and Lowndes, and half a dozen titles by Charles Davenant. There are also fifteen works published between 1735 and 1740, concerning the current situation of Great Britain and the war with Spain that began in 1739. It is likely that many of these English titles were acquired when Dutot visited London that very year. The evidence is in his writings. He cited the French translation of Thomas Mun he owned in the Réflexions politiques published before the trip, but cited Petty and Davenant (which he owned in the original English) at the end of the response to Duverney written after the trip.Footnote 76 Aside from the works in English, there are very few books with imprints after 1730 (4%). The exceptions include Melon’s work and historical works related to the period of John Law’s System.\n\nDutot was clearly a bibliophile. We find a copy of Naudé’s Avis pour dresser une Bibliothèque, whose encyclopedic approach is reflected in the fields that interested Dutot. He owned eighteen catalogues of private collections, the earliest from 1643 and the most recent from 1740, a year before his death. Thus, he clearly sought to build a rather comprehensive library, on the model of the great private libraries of the time, which is what makes the gaps in his collection so revealing.\n\nIndeed, Dutot’s collection is also interesting for what it does not contain. Except for the classics of international law such as Pufendorf and Grotius, and a handful of other volumes on commercial law and notarial procedure, there were no law books. Although he owned a harpsichord and a viol, he had no printed music.Footnote 77 Dutot, unlike the next generation of French economists, had no interest in agriculture. The library is also nearly empty of books on fine arts, natural history, or medicine.\n\nA comparison of Dutot’s library with those of his contemporaries (Marion Reference Marion1978, Reference Marion1999) shows that Dutot’s library closely resembled those of superior officers, ministers, and members of the upper nobility. It was somewhat similar to those of financiers and magistrates, and it was most distant from those of professionals: notaries, lawyers, clergymen, physicians. It was not particularly close to those of economists and other figures of the Enlightenment, all of whom belonged to a later generation. This, no doubt, reflects the state of knowledge at the time when Dutot formed his library. He wanted facts, and they were in the history books. The knowledge that he sought had not yet been collected and categorized in the arts and sciences.Footnote 78\n\nIt is also noteworthy that Dutot’s library was quite similar to that of his rival Chrétien-Deschamps. There was substantial overlap between the two. Among the pre-1742 imprints in Chrétien-Deschamps’s library, 36% appear among Dutot’s books. Another similarity is the love of maps. Chrétien-Deschamps had composed his own atlas in three folio volumes, with 276 maps. It was sold for 1024L, more than a quarter of the total for the library (3908L). Melon’s library is harder to compare. No catalogue is available and only twenty-eight titles are named in the inventory. But twenty of those titles appear in Dutot’s library. Melon, like Dutot and Chrétien-Deschamps, also liked maps and owned two folio volumes of maps by de Lisle."
