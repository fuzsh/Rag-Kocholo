XXVIII\n\nFollowing is a synopsis of the documents contained in the present volume:\n\nLV. The Relation of 1644-45 consisted of one part, dated at Quebec, October 1, 1645, written by Vimont, supplemented by a letter from Jerome Lalemant, dated in the Huron country, May 15 previous. The first eleven chapters of Vimonts account were contained in Vol. XXVII. of our series; we now present the remainder of the document, by both Vimont and Lalemant.\n\nChap. xii. is Richards account of the Miscou (or rather Gaspésian) mission. During the year, fourteen persons have been baptized  six in illness, and a family of eight. The converts show edifying piety and obedience; and even the unbelievers have great respect for baptism. The savages themselves say that they would all be Christians by this time, were it not for the liquor that is traded to them; and the lack of restraint on that pernicious traffic ruins everything. The Indians are fond of singing, and offer their prayers with great delight since these have been set to music. Several war parties, passing that way, are interested in the chapel services; they come back from their forays, with several prisoners and scalps, over which they hold rejoicings. The Frenchmen who winter at the Bay des Chaleurs, and the sailors on the fishing vessels, also receive spiritual, ministrations from the missionaries. But the liquor [Page 9] traffic is the scourge of this region, and only Heaven can furnish a remedy therefor.\n\nLalemants supplemental letter is addressed to the provincial, at Paris, and concerns the Huron mission. In accordance with the latters orders, he has relegated his duties there, as superior, to Ragueneau, and is about to go down to Quebec. He glances at the history of the mission since his arrival thereat in 1638, mentioning the calamities that have crowded upon this poor Church  pestilence, famine, and war. So great are the obstacles to the establishment of the faith here,  most of all, in the self-will and unrestrained freedom which prevails among these savages,  that human judgment alone must consider the task almost hopeless. There is among them but little law, and that obeyed only so far as each pleases; their habits are licentious, and their marriages unstable; and, above all, superstition has contaminated nearly all the actions of their lives, and they are the slaves of the devil in everything. For such, the law of God is too heavy a burden. Moreover, the constant raids of the Iroquois threaten to ruin the Huron tribes and to break up their trade with the French; this would compel the abandonment of the missions. But, notwithstanding all these hindrances, the missionaries trust in Gods promises and power, and consider nothing impossible to him. Every year secures them a goodly number of baptisms, and they are comforted by seeing the constancy and devotion displayed by their converts. The progress made during these seven years has, on the whole, been all that could reasonably be expected. Various incidents are related to show the earnestness and sincerity of these new [Page 10] Christians; and the seven Huron churches are enumerated. Lalemant closes with an earnest appeal for more men and funds to maintain and defend this important enterprise.\n\nLVI. In his so-called Novum Belgium, Isaac Jogues gives (August 3, 1646) an account of the Dutch colony at New Amsterdam (later, New York City), for which he obtained material during his stay there in the autumn of 1643. He describes the river, and the fort and other buildings; the character of the population, men of eighteen different languages and of almost as many religious sects,  none of which, however, save the Calvinists, exercise religious functions; and the inducements offered to colonists by the West India Company. He mentions the settlements made by various nations, from the Connecticut to the Delaware,  adding that the English prefer to have lands among the Dutch, who require nothing from them, to depending upon English Milords, who, exact rents and like to put on airs of being absolute. Jogues describes the land and climate; the dwellings of the Dutch settlers; their culture of the land, and trade with the Indians; the savage tribes adjoining the white settlements; and the recent war between the Dutch and Indians.\n\nLVII. In this document (always published, however, in connection with his Novum Belgium), Jogues gives a biographical sketch of the young physician, René Goupil (a Jesuit donné), who for a time shared Joguess captivity, and who met death at the hands of the Iroquois, September 29, 1642. A graphic and pathetic account is given of the painful journey, the cruel torture inflicted on the captives, and the young donnés murder; still more impressive are the [Page 11] fortitude, patience, and holy resignation exhibited by Goupil amid his sufferings, and the self-forgetful altruism which leads him to aid not only his fellow-captives, but a sick Iroquois. On the journey to the village of their captors, Goupil takes, under Joguess direction, the final vows of entrance into the Jesuit order,  which, in France, he had been unable to do, on account of his frail health. The Iroquois murder him,  and often threaten to slay Jogues also,  because of his praying aloud, and making the sign of the cross, as they afterward plainly tell the Father. The latter endeavors at the peril of his own life, but &vain, to save his followers corpse from desecration.\n\nLVIII. This is a letter from Jogues (September 12, 1646) to André Castillon, a fellow Jesuit, and is apparently the last message penned by the martyred missionary. He gives an account of the journey made by him and Bourdon, a few months earlier, to the Iroquois country, whither he is on the eve of departing for a winter sojourn. He describes the beneficial results of the peace concluded last year with the Iroquois; both population and commerce show a notable increase. He prays for similar blessings in spiritual affairs; and closes with an especial petition that prayers may be offered in his own behalf, since he must spend nearly a year away from the sacraments of the Church. A postscript (dated at Three Rivers, September 21) adds the information that he is soon to embark for the Iroquois country.\n\nLIX. The Journal des Jésuites is continued, giving the record for 1646. The greater part of the Journal is occupied with descriptions of the manner in which the various feast days and other functions [Page 12] of the church are celebrated; but many little incidents are related which throw light on social, economic, and political conditions in the early days of Canada; and on the relations existing between the French and the aborigines. On New Years Day, gifts are exchanged between all the French people of the colony; those given and received by the Jesuits are enumerated in detail. The French settlements above Quebec are doing well, on the whole; though a quarrel that arises between the Algonkins at Three Rivers, and some Mohawks sojourning there, causes temporary apprehension. The Sillery Indians go (January I 5) on their usual hunt for game; and those left behind, twenty-five in number, are subsisted by the Jesuits and the Hospital nuns. On one occasion, a zealous lady undertakes to send, in array befitting its holy use, the bread for consecration; she adorns it with a toilet  a crown of gauze or linen puffs, and, if she had been allowed, would gladly have added tapers and golden coins. Vimont, however, before consecrating the bread, had all that removed, and blessed it with the same simplicity that I had observed with the preceding portions, and especially with that of Monsieur the Governor  fearing lest this change might occasion Jealousy and Vanity. Toward the end of January, a disturbance arises among the petty habitants, headed by Marsolet and Maheu; they claim that M. des Chastelets, the general agent, is living too high, etc. One of Montmagnys household takes part with the malcontents, whence arose many difficulties, and offensive words, and dissatisfaction; and pasquinades were composed. Monsieur the Governor having punished the guilty, everything became quiet. [Page 13]\n\nOn February 12, tidings arrive of Father de Nouës death; separated from his companions, while on the way to Fort Richelieu, he loses his way, and is frozen to death on the ice. On the 15th, two men are punished on the chevalet, or wooden horse,  one for blasphemy, the other for assaulting his companion; and, later, another man is thus punished for gluttony. The nuns of both convents send the Jesuits, during the Shrovetide season, and on other festal occasions, various delicacies  pastries, Spanish Wine, etc.; many liberal gifts from Montmagny are also mentioned.\n\nNews is brought from Three Rivers, March 10, that Coûture had returned from the Iroquois country, with Mohawk envoys, and confirmation of the peace recently negotiated.\n\nApril 7, one Master Jaques, surnamed the hermit, began his entrance into our service; it would appear that he became one of the donné of the Jesuits. Since the first of February, the savages left behind at Sillery have been encamped near Quebec, but they return to their homes after Easter; soon after, their hunting expedition comes back. Lalemant, while on a visit to Sillery, meets there Coûture, whose savage name had been changed at 3 Rivers, at a feast made for him by father buteux, from Ihandich, which sounds ill in yroquois, to Achirra,  the name of the late Monsieur Nicolet,  to the joy of all the Huron, Algonquin, and Annieronon savages. At a consultation held on the 26th, the Fathers decide to send Jogues to the Mohawk country, and to retain Druillettes in Canada; and they approve of Coutures proposed marriage. The opening of the St. Lawrence occurs this year on April [Page 14] 17 or 18, and planting is begun a little before that,  not only by the French, but by the savages whom the missionaries have colonized at Sillery and elsewhere.\n\nDuring the first part of May, negotiations with the Iroquois are carried on at Three Rivers; and, on the 16th, Jogues sets out thence on his journey to the Iroquois. Father Masse dies at Quebec, on the 11th. Lalemant records various quarrels, occurring among both the savages and the French. Forest fires have made great havoc about Quebec; one colonist is burned out, but receives liberal aid from the others. During this month, brother Ambroise is engaged in brewing beer. A gunner at Richelieu, weary of life, wishes to commit suicide, but is restrained by his fear of hell. He then accuses himself of a scandalous offense, invented for the occasion,  since, on the one hand, he would die, which was what he sought; and, on the other, they would first have him confess, which would enable him to avoid Hell. Father Du Peron, however, mingles reproof and comfort in his treatment, and leaves the man in a good frame of mind. Good news is brought from Tadoussac, regarding both commercial and religious matters.\n\nOn the 4th of June, it is decided to rebuild the mill on the Jesuits farm at La Vacherie. A marriage occurs on the 18th, at which five soldiers dance a ballet. Indians from Tadoussac bring furs to Quebec, and make complaints of their treatment by De Launay, a French trader at Tadoussac. June 23, St. Johns day is celebrated with cannon shots and bonfires  lighted by Montmagny himself, while Lalemant chants prayers. The governor and [Page 15] Lalemant view the lands along the St. Charles River, in order to ascertain the boundaries of a grant there to the Ursulines; but the decision is left till the return of Bourdon, the surveyor of the colony, from the Iroquois country. The Jesuits receive an increase in the lands of La Vacherie, to replace a tract ceded by them to Quebec. Lalemant here gives interesting information as to the nature of the various land grants in Canada made to the Jesuits. The grant of meadow lands made to the Hospital nuns by Vimont, in the previous year, is retroceded by the nuns, in consideration of other lands obtained by them. The Ursulines promise to do the same, when they shall have secured the lands which they expect to receive. News comes from Miscou that two Indian families have been rendered sedentary.\n\nFather Jogues and Bourdon arrive from the Iroquois country on July 3. The next day, Abenaki chiefs come to Quebec, to ask that a black gown be sent to their tribe, to give them instructions; Lalemant puts them off till Autumn, in order to take time to consider the matter. On the 13th, the Jesuit property at La Vacherie is increased by eighteen arpents of land.\n\nThis year, the fleet from France does not arrive until August 7; with it comes Father Daran. On the next day Charles de la Tour, noted in the annals of Acadia, comes to Quebec for refuge, his fort at St. John having been captured by his rival DAulnay. The Sillery Indians kill a Frenchmans cow, which has injured their corn, and are obliged to pay a fine of six beaver skins, At a consultation held on the 2 I&, the Fathers decide that they will rent their Beauport estate and have a clergy-house built; send [Page 16] Dreuillettes to the Abenaki tribes, and Jogues to the Iroquois; and ask for additional concessions from the habitants. De la Poterie sends a messenger in haste to Montmagny, to inform him of a fancied discovery of gold and copper mines; but the specimens prove valueless  being probably iron pyrites. Des Groseilliers, the explorer, comes down from the Huron country, and apparently returns thither soon after.\n\nEarly in September, disputes arise concerning the Jesuit estates at Three Rivers; but they remain for the time unsettled. The Huron fleet this year numbers 80 canoes; and they carry away a dozen bundles of skins, for want of merchandise. Father Quentin brings from France several men for the Jesuit missions. Among these is a young gentleman of good family, who had professed conversion to the Catholic faith, and made a vow to go to the Hurons; but he proves to be a liar and swindler, concerning whom various scandals are reported. He finally leaves the colony, after having cheated the Jesuits out of more than 200 livres.\n\nLalemant notes the large increase in the habitants income from the fur trade, under the new arrangement with the Hundred Associates,  the habitants share this year being valued at 320,000 livres. The Jesuits ask the Council for an increased allowance; they obtain 1,200 francs additional for each of the missions, but are compelled to furnish their own fuel. Several prominent persons return to France October 31,  Maisonneuve, Giffard, and Tronquet,  all firmly resolved that they would strive to obtain some regulation for their affairs, each one seeking his own private Interests. On another vessel embarked several young men, sons of the leading [Page 17] colonists,  all rogues, for the most part, who had played a thousand tricks on the other voyage; and they all were given high salaries. At this time, work is begun on the new clergy-house and church at Quebec, and on a brewery and oven at Sillery.\n\nMother Marie de St. Ignace, the first superior of the Quebec hospital, dies November 5. On the 12th, Marguerite, widow of the explorer Jean Nicolet, is married to Nicolas Macard. On the 21st, Madame de la Peltrie, her maid, Charlotte Barré, and one Catherine, begin their novitiate with the Ursulines. The same day, comes news of the greatest disaster which had yet occurred in Canada,  the wreck of the brigantine which went from Quebec to Three Rivers, and carried most of the necessary supplies for the settlers at the latter post. These were lost, with nine men,  a loss shared by the Jesuits to some extent, in goods and in the death of a donné, Gaspar Goüaut, of Poitiers. Later advices show that much of the cargo was saved. November 29, Vimont says mass at the hospital,  in acquittal of the obligation laid upon the Hospital nuns, by the terms of their land grants,  for the members of the Hundred Associates. The Jesuits owe a like ceremony, for the deceased associates of the Company; and Lalemant adds: I certainly intend to say it, but not to invite Monsieur the governor to it, in order not to prejudice our former rights from Monsieur de Vantadour (the first Canadian viceroy).\n\nIn December, a soldier, named De Champigny, abjures heresy, and becomes a Catholic; as this man understands music, and can sing the treble part, the Jesuits are now able to have in the church a choir of four voices. On the last day of the year, a dramatic [Page 18] performance is given at the warehouse, at which is apparently enacted Corneilles tragedy of Le Cid. Our Fathers were present,  in deference to Monsieur the governor, who took pleasure therein, as also did the savages,  that is, fathers de Quen, [Gabriel] Lalemant, and defretat; all went well, and there was nothing which could not edify. I begged Monsieur the governor to excuse me from attendance. The price of wood is this year placed at 100 sols, and some interested persons secure control of the market; besides, the wood is of poor quality and short measure. Hence arise great disorder and Jealousy, which are with difficulty quieted.\n\nLX: The Relation of 1645-46 is, like most of its predecessors, in two parts: the first, by Jerome Lalemant, appointed in 1646 to succeed Vimont as superior of his order in Canada, consists of a preliminary letter to the provincial, in France (dated Quebek, October 28, 1646), and ten chapters giving a general view of the missions, particularly of the lower country; Part II. is the Huron report, by Ragueneau, consisting also of a preliminary note to the provincial (dated Des Hurons, May I, 1646), and eight chapters detailing the particulars of the work in Huronia. We herewith present the first two chapters of Part I., and will, conclude the document in Vols. XXIX. and XXX.\n\nLalemant briefly mentions the present prosperous condition of the French settlements, and the good work accomplished therein by the religious orders. The savages are gradually being attracted within religious influences, and thus encourage the missionaries with brighter hopes for their conversion; over 300 baptisms have occurred during the year. The [Page 19] superior then reverts to the peace recently concluded with the Mohawks  which, however, unfortunately does not include the other Iroquois tribes, who are still hostile. The Sokokis and Mohicans are not friendly to the French, but, fearing the Mohawks, are quiet. A detailed account is given of the Mohawk council in which peace with the French was arranged,  based on the reports of Coûture, who had formerly been a captive with that tribe.\n\nIn February, 1646, Coûture returns to Three Rivers, accompanied by seven Mohawk envoys, who come to ratify the treaty with the French, and extend it to their Indian allies. This is accomplished in May following, when Montmagny meets them for that purpose; the speeches and presents are described at length.\n\nR. G.

I have never seen them better disposed, writes Father Richard. We have baptized 14 since my last letter  a family of eight persons; and six in the extremity of illness, who nearly all died shortly afterward. Among these, a young man, who was very intelligent, showed by his answers and his fervor that his was a soul destined for Heaven. As to the family, it was to have been baptized last year; but its head, whose name is Iariet, had been guilty of intemperance, and this occasioned the delay. His wife, however, feared that she might die in childbirth,  for she said that her time had long passed, and she was exceedingly ill,  and desired Baptism before our departure. She obtained it, not only on account of her dangerous condition but also owing to her own [125] merits, which cause her to pass with every one for the most virtuous, the wisest, and most modest of all the Savage women. The administration of the rites was deferred until the Baptism of her husband. On the 30th of July, this favor was granted to him and to all his family. He was named Denis by Monsieur Prevost, Captain in the Kings navy, commanding the Ship St. Joseph; and his wife was named Marguerite. This good woman was [Page 23] not content to answer all questions with the devotion and sentiments with which the Holy Ghost inspired her, but she also assisted her husband,  she exhorted him and suggested to him the answers. They afterward received the Nuptial benediction, and were admitted to Our Lords table. On leaving it, Denis Iariet said to me: Now I. will pray in earnest, and will be a good man. I regret my past life; I hate sin, and wish to lead a better life in future. Then, drawing out a quantity of Porcelain beads, he said: I am sorry that I am so poor; I have neither Moose nor Beaver to present to those Gentlemen who so greatly obliged us at our Baptism. I wish that I had something by which I might acknowledge the kindness that we have received, but since I have [126] nothing else, I shall be pleased if they will deign to accept this little present from me. We thanked him, and were satisfied with this manifestation of his good will. He therefore withdrew, quite content, and returned to Nepegigouit to continue the hunt for Beaver, and to help as much as he could in completing the building that Monsieur the Abbé of sainte Magdalene,[1] and Messieurs the Associates for Miskou, have caused to be begun near us for him and for Joseph Nepsuget, who was baptized last year. They are on good terms with each other; they are good comrades, and hunt together in Summer and in Winter. They had much to suffer at the beginning of last Winter and God tried their constancy and courage. They had selected their hunting district very far within the forest, hoping there to meet better success. They had intended to lay in a supply of Salmon; but the frost forestalled them, and closed the rivers, which quickly reduced them to want. [Page 25] They subsisted as best they could until Advent, when they found themselves completely destitute Of provisions. They searched and hunted everywhere without finding anything but a few Porcupines, and that very seldom. They were [127] compelled to eat their dogs, their skins, and their shoes, and often passed several days without food. During that time, a strange thing happened to a young Frenchman who wintered with them. One day, when a dog had been killed to save the lives of numerous persons who were stating, this boy, who was not satisfied with the little that they had given to him as to the others, seized the liver of the animal, that had been thrown away, and cooked and ate it. He was warned to leave that meat,  that it would do him harm, and make his skin fall off. He would not believe it, and continued his repast, but to his regret,  for it cost him his skin, which fell off in great flakes without any pain, so that in a short time his skin was entirely changed. The Savages know by experience this result on those who have eaten that meat.\n\nThis affliction however did not inspire our people with any distaste for prayer. On the contrary, they had recourse to it in their greatest weakness; and, as they told me, they arose therefrom less inconvenienced by hunger. They attributed the misfortune to their sins, and acknowledged that God punished them for their offenses. It is true, said Joseph Nepsuget, [128] that we have given God cause to be angry with us; but I, principally, have done so by my anger and impatience, and by my former drunkenness. He punishes us justly. Let us therefore have recourse to him; let us ask pardon of him. He will have pity on us; he is our Father. [Page 27] I will never offend him again; I will never allow myself to be overcome by anger or by liquor; I wish for the future to please God, and to be a good man. After that, they began their prayers which they continued for a long time, and frequently recommenced. Finally, God had pity on them; and, after allowing them to suffer much through famine from the eighth of December to the sixth of January, he sent them an abundance of food, and three times as much as the other Savages had. In the first place, they killed a Moose with much difficulty, for they were extremely weak and could hardly stand. This food restored their strength and courage to some extent; so they took the field in all directions, and in a short time they filled their cabin with meat. They were not ungrateful, but thanked God for every animal that they killed, and at the end of the Winter [129] they related everywhere the favors that God had conferred on them. Joseph came to us as soon as the ice had left the rivers free, and Denis came shortly afterward. They told us of their good and evil fortunes during the Winter, and of the care they had taken to pray to God, to observe the Sundays, and to remember what they had been taught. For my part, said Denis Iariet, who was then a Catechumen, I often found by experience that I derived no benefit and gained nothing by hunting on Sundays but if, after having rested on that day, I went to hunt on the morrow, I never failed to be successful. Therefore I will never do anything to transgress that day. It is consoling to see how careful these good people are to observe the Festivals and Sundays. If they had no time to put their few household effects in order, and to prepare their provisions [Page 29] so that they might not be spoiled, still they did not venture to touch them, without previously ascertaining from us whether it was permitted to do so. In the same manner, I often observed that on Fridays and fast days they suffered much, rather than do anything contrary to abstinence on those days.\n\n[130] But we are human, and the strongest are not always sure to remain upright. This Joseph of whom we speak found means to procure a cask of wine; he gave himself up to intemperance, and afterward to disorder, and committed a scandalous sin. This is the evil that we have for a long time deplored here; and the lack of restraint on that pernicious traffic ruins everything, as we have frequently written to Your Reverence. They themselves say that they would all be Christians by this time, were it not for the liquor that is traded to them. When this poor man came to his senses, he was so ashamed that he did not dare to show himself; but, as his offense had been public, he also had to make public reparation. This he willingly agreed to, on a Sunday morning in the Chapel,  in the presence of all, both French and Savages,  with great manifestations of sorrow. May God continue to grant him grace and to strengthen his courage.\n\nAs for the remainder of our Savages, they are very willing and well disposed. Many of them, although they are infidels, are anxious to procure Baptism for their sick; they promptly inform us as soon as they see any one in danger, [131] and beg us to go and baptize them. The principal men among them glory in calling and bringing the others to prayers,  they assemble, urge, and press them though most of them need no spur. Our Chapel is [Page 31] often too small to hold them all; the prayers have to be repeated at various times: and they show by their fervor and modesty that they relish them. In fact, since we have set their prayers to music they take a remarkable pleasure in attending them, and pride themselves on singing well. Some of them, in truth, have very fine voices; and those who have seen and have lived at Kebec, do not find our Savages less deserving of praise than the Montagnais. Two persons of rank among them came one day, when all the prayers were over, to ask that they be made to pray to God. And where were you, they were asked, when the prayers were said? Why were you not there? We knew nothing about it, they said; we were at some distance, and heard nothing of them. Make us pray to God; we are sorry to have failed in that duty. They had to be satisfied, and, when they had performed their devotions, they showed by deed and by word that they [132] were pleased. But truly delightful it is to see, when we teach the Catechism to them, the care and the trouble that the parents take to make their children attentive, and to impress on their minds what by this means we teach them and the older ones. They will take before them their children whom they tenderly love, and have them make the Sign of the Cross; they will repeat to them what the Reverend Father says, and then enlarge upon the subject, and explain it in other words; they will exhort them to remember it well, and will not forget to instill into their souls a horror for sin. A band of Savages, of the chief men of Acadia, led by a brave Captain named Herout, passed here last Spring, on their way to war. They attended the prayers and the [Page 33] exhortations that we addressed to them in their language in the Chapel of this settlement, and were all delighted to hear things so beautiful and so new. Alas! said they, we have so long frequented the French settlements on our shores, and we have never been taught in that fashion. We know not what it is to pray, at least in our own language; our children are not taught as you teach them here. At all events, they went away [133] inclined to right sentiments, and perhaps this Divine seed will bear fruit in its time. On their return from war, a party of them passed by our House of Nepegigouit where they showed themselves as assiduous and as zealous for the prayers, as they had been at Miscou. They came to rejoice with our Savages at the brave exploits of the war that they had performed at Chichedek, in the Country of the Bersiamites, where they had killed seven Savages and taken thirteen or fourteen prisoners, most of whom were children. Those from the Bay here, who had gone before them with the same purpose of war, showed themselves much more reserved and never ventured to attack any Canoes that they met in that quarter, because they imagined, from their speech, that they prayed to God. But these others, who have less love for prayer and are not so well instructed, did not disturb themselves on that account. They threw themselves on the first prey that fell into their hands; they came back victorious, and desired by these massacres to allay the grief and sorrow of all the Country, which is afflicted by the death of many persons who have died during the past few years. They threw on the shore, at landing, the scalps of the poor massacred people, [134] and at the same time [Page 35] spread joy throughout the cabins. The women vied with one another who should first seize these Trophies, and who should sing and dance the best. Neither rain nor wind could stop them, from morning to night. It is strange that this constant and continued dancing and singing for several days did not tire or weary them. But a false alarm, and the rumor that the enemy had appeared, interrupted their rejoicing, threw them into fear and apprehension of falling into the hands of the Hiroquois, and made them think of flight. They all withdrew to Miskou, where for a long time they continued their baleful songs to the cadence of the waving scalps.\n\nSo much for our Savages. As for the French, Your Reverence is aware that we devote ourselves to those who winter in this settlement, and to several fishing ships that come here every year and spend the Summer on these Coasts; and I may say, to the glory of God, that this Mission supplies the spiritual needs not only of the latter but also of the former, and of the Savages of the Country. Sermons, and the teaching of Catechism; the frequent [135] Confessions and Communions; the disputes and quarrels that have been settled and appeased,  even among the principal persons, who had gone so far as to challenge each other,  sufficiently show the importance of these excursions in which the Savages also have a share. For, as they readily remain near the ships, we cannot assist the one without also having the means of assisting the other. But liquor, which is here traded and sold with impunity, is the scourge of this region. When will Heaven furnish a remedy therefor, since we await it in vain from earth? It will be through the prayers of Your Reverence, to which I earnestly commend myself.[Page 37]\n\n[136] Letter from Father Hierosme Lalemant, writ-\n\nten from the Huron country to the Rev-\n\nerend Father Provincial of the\n\nSociety of JESUS.\n\nM\n\nY REVEREND FATHER,\n\nI was deprived last year of an especial consolation, because the letters that Your Reverence had written to me had fallen into the hands of the Hiroquois, our enemies. I learned, however, at the end of the Summer, the orders that you had sent, in accordance with which I have left the care of this Huron Mission to Father Paul Ragueneau and have prepared to depart from these upper countries and go down to Kebec.\n\nIn my uncertainty as to what might happen to me on the way, I have deemed it advisable to write this letter previous to my departure, and to leave it here to be sent after me, so that in any case Your Reverence might know my latest thoughts and opinions concerning the conversion of these Countries,  after I have dwelt here nearly seven years, witnessed the labors of the Fathers of our Society, [137] and seen the fruits that Heaven has reaped from them,  and the hopes that I leave here for the future, if God continue to pour his blessings on these Peoples as he has begun.\n\nMaladies succeeded one another, until it seemed as if they singled out the Christians more than the Infidels, cruelly decimating their families, and more frequently sparing those who had refused Baptism,  while at the same time, in the same cabin, and in the same bed, death snatched others from us who had embraced the Faith. Although by this means God indeed increased in Heaven the number of his Elect, for whose sake alone he has chosen that his holy Name be announced to these barbarous Peoples, nevertheless it was not, it would seem, a desirable preparation for making our Faith more lovable [Page 41] and for increasing the number of this Church militant; it was more fitted to produce aversion therefor, and to inspire a horror of it as great as of death.\n\nThen Famines had their turn; and the people [139] thought that, because they had changed Masters, and had placed their confidence in God rather than in the Demons of Hell, the Faith had drawn these misfortunes after it; and that he whom it adored was either powerless to do us good, or was wanting in love for those who wished to love him.\n\nWars have been more pitiless, and, although they have ravaged this Country most cruelly, without sparing any sex, age, or condition of persons, nevertheless we may truly say that it seems as if God had chosen to reap the flower of our Churches with that sharp sword. Into the heart of the Country, and to the doors of the villages where the reign of the Faith most prevailed, the Hiroquois have come from a hundred leagues distance, to slay those who supported it and who by the example and holiness of their lives, by the ardor of their zeal, and the efficacy of the impassioned words that the Holy Ghost placed in their mouths, already possessed the qualities of Apostles of their country, wherein they preached more powerfully than we the greatness of him who makes Saints of barbarians.\n\n[140] These were deeply felt losses for a Church newly born; but those that have followed since our last Relations have seemed more disastrous,  not only to the advancement of the Faith, but also to all these Countries, which become weaker day by day, and seem to be drawing near their ruin, if some arm more powerful than ours or some intervention of [Page 43] Heaven do not arrest the insolence and success of their Enemies.\n\nA year ago last Summer, our Christians had mustered a band of about a hundred picked men, who joined some Infidel warriors to go and lay ambushes on the frontiers of the enemys Country. They were met by seven or eight hundred Hiroquois; and, after fighting for a whole evening and a whole night, they were all killed on the field of battle or taken prisoners, not one effecting his escape.\n\nOne misfortune attracts another. In the same year, two bands of Hurons fell into the hands of other Hiroquois who are nearer Kebec, and who lay in wait for them on the River which they descend to go and see the French, and to trade their Beaver skins and furs with them.\n\n[141] And last year three other fleets, mostly of Christians, also met with death or captivity on the same road,  one, soon after their departure from Three rivers; another, a little above Ville-Marie; the last, about sixty leagues higher up. For the peril continues over a hundred leagues of road. There is no safety for a moment from an enemy hidden in the rushes along the banks of the river, or in the depths of the forest, which screen them from your sight while they can see you coming from a distance of four, five, or six leagues,  thus having time to prepare for a combat, if they see that you are weaker; or to retreat, or remain hidden in their ambush, if they consider you the stronger.\n\nA single band, which had passed through these dangers, reached here safely, and brought to us Father Jean de Brébeuf, whose absence during three years had been greatly felt by us, and Fathers Leonard [Page 45] Garreau and Noel Chabanel, who had newly come to our assistance. Their arrival consoled us exceedingly in our regret for our recent loss of Father Bressany, who had fallen into the hands of the Hiroquois. [142] This band was escorted by the troops which Monsieur de Montmagny, our Governor, sent us most opportunely, not only for the preservation of the poor Hurons, who ran a great risk of also falling into the ambushes of the enemies, but still more for strengthening this Country, which was threatened this Winter with the sight of a Hiroquois army coming to ravage their villages, bringing with it general desolation, and wasting everything with fire and sword. But the arrival of this relief made them alter their plans. And if this same escort of French Soldiers, which is about to return, in order to accompany the Hurons who are going down the river, reach Kebec as safely as they came up last year, Heaven will have fully blessed all the designs of Monsieur our Governor. In any case, I pray God ever to preserve for New France a person who should be so precious to us; for I do not think that, in the nine years during which he has had the Government of it, any one could have acted with more zeal than he has displayed, with more disinterested prudence, with more [143] strength of mind, and with a more truly Christian courage, amid the almost insurmountable difficulties that have been encountered, and that would have discouraged a heart less firm than his.\n\nBut to return to our subject, and to tell your Reverence my sentiments respecting the conversion of this country, I may frankly confess that, if we had to judge the establishment of the Faith in these [Page 47] countries from the standpoint of human prudence, I could hardly believe that there is any place in the world more difficult to subject to the Laws of Jesus Christ. Not only because they have no knowledge of letters, no Historical monuments, and no idea of a Divinity who has created the world and who governs it; but, above all, because I do not believe that there is any people on earth freer than they, and less able to allow the subjection of their wills to any power whatever,  so much so that Fathers here have no control over their children, or Captains over their subjects, or the Laws of the country over any of them, except in so far as each is pleased to submit to them. There is no punishment which [144] is inflicted on the guilty, and no criminal who is not sure that his life and property are in no danger, even if he were convicted of three or four murders, of having received a reward from the enemy for betraying his country, or breaking off by his own act a peace, that is decided upon by the general consent of the whole country. These are crimes that I have seen committed, the authors whereof have gloried in them and have boasted that the wars that they had aroused would make their names immortal. It is not because there are no Laws or punishments proportionate to the crimes, but it is not the guilty who suffer the penalty. It is the public that must make amends for the offenses of individuals; so that, if a Huron has killed an Algonquin or another Huron, the whole country assembles; and they come to an agreement respecting the number of presents to be given to the Tribe or to the relatives of him who has been killed, to stay the vengeance that they might take. The Captains urge their subjects to [Page 49] provide what is needed; no one is compelled to it, but those who are willing bring publicly what they wish to contribute; it seems as if they vied [145] with one another according to the amount of their wealth, and as the desire of glory and of appearing solicitous for the public welfare urges them to do on like occasions. Now although this form of justice restrains all these peoples, and seems more effectually to repress disorders than the personal punishment of criminals does in France, it is nevertheless a very mild proceeding, which leaves individuals in such a spirit of liberty that they never submit to any Laws and obey no other impulse than that of their own will. This, without doubt, is a disposition quite contrary to the spirit of the Faith, which requires us to submit not only our wills, but our minds, our judgments, and all the sentiments of man to a power unknown to our senses, to a Law that is not of earth, and that is entirely opposed to the laws and sentiments of corrupt nature.\n\nAdd to this that the laws of the Country, which to them seem most just, attack the purity of the Christian life in a thousand ways, especially as regards their marriages  the dissolution of which, with freedom to seek another consort, is [146] more frequent and easy here than it is in France for a master to take another servant, when the one he has does not please him. The result is, truth to tell, that, in the closest of their marriages, and those which they consider most conformable to reason, the faith that they pledge each other is nothing more than a conditional promise to live together so long as each shall continue to render the services that they mutually expect from each other, and shall not in any way wound the [Page 51] affection that they owe each other. If this fail, divorce is considered reasonable on the part of the injured one, although the other party who has given occasion for it is blamed.\n\nBut the greatest opposition that we meet in these Countries to the spirit of the Faith consists in the fact that their remedies for diseases; their greatest amusements when in good health; their fishing, their hunting, and their trading; the success of their crops, of their wars, and of their councils,  almost all abound in diabolical ceremonies. So that, as superstition has contaminated nearly all the actions of their lives, it would seem that to be a Christian, one must deprive himself not only of [147] pastimes which elsewhere are wholly innocent, and of the dearest pleasures of life, but even of the most necessary things, and, in a word, die to the world at the very moment that one wishes to assume the life of a Christian.\n\nNot that, after examining their superstitions more closely, we find that the Devil interferes and gives them any help beyond the operation of nature; but nevertheless they have recourse to him; they believe that he speaks to them in dreams; they invoke his aid; they make presents and sacrifices to him,  sometimes to appease him and sometimes to render him favorable to them; they attribute to him their health, their cures, and all the happiness of their lives. In this, they are all the more miserable that they are slaves of the Devil, without gaining anything in his service,  not even in this world, of which he is called the Prince, and wherein he seems to have some power.\n\nIf lesser difficulties have caused trouble in [Page 53] converting civilized Nations, and if it has taken entire centuries to implant the Faith in them, though God then assisted those who preached his word, with a multitude of miracles,  with the gift of cures, [148] the gift of tongues, of prophecies, and everything that can astonish nature and make even the most impious acknowledge the power and majesty of him whose greatness they proclaimed,  what can be expected from these barbarous nations when it has not pleased God to bless us with frequent miracles, and to make the Faith more agreeable to them by the pleasant things that it would cause Heaven to shower, even in this life, on those who should submit to his Laws; and when we have not here even such temporal aids as the succor, the benefits, and the gifts which have been employed with the Savages in the other countries of the World to procure their conversion? Finally, we cannot here have force at hand, and the support of that sharp sword which serves the Church in so holy a manner to give authority to her Decrees, to maintain Justice, and curb the insolence of those who trample under foot the holiness of her Mysteries.\n\nAs Faith is not natural to these peoples,  as it seems to be in France, where it is imbibed with ones mothers milk,  it is not a mere trifle to have made a man a Christian. More contests, more pains, and more labors are needed to retain and [149] keep him in the Church than were required to win him to God. Temptations show them their feebleness; their minds are not always fervent; Heaven does not always fix their gaze; earth has not lost all its attractions for them; it is easy for them in the course of many years to fall back into their frailties; grace is but transitory, while nature ever remains; in a [Page 55] word, I mean to say that perseverance in the exercise of Faith is no less difficult here than it is in France for the majority to retain the innocence of Baptism, and not to lose through sin the grace that makes us agreeable to God.\n\nAdd to this the fury of a Hiroquois enemy who closes the way to us; who deprives us of the necessities of life, and of the help that may be sent us in a forsaken country; who kills and massacres those who come to our aid; whose insolence grows from year to year; who depopulates the country, and makes our Hurons think of giving up the trade with the French, because they find that it costs them too dear, and they prefer to do without European goods rather than to expose themselves every year, not [150] to a death that would be endurable, but to fires and flames, for which they have a thousand times greater horror.\n\nNow, therefore, what can we expect in the midst of a barbarous nation where we shall no longer have the necessaries of life; where they will no longer venture to send us the reinforcement of laborers that would be required here to promote the affairs of God; where all who shall remain will be abandoned to the fury of a desperate people, who will no longer be restrained from massacring us all by the fear of losing their trade with the French,  which they will find impossible to them, and which will be completely ruined, as far as they are concerned? In that case, the Christians who compose this nascent Church will then see themselves without Pastors, without Sacraments, without Sacrifice, and without the means of having recourse to those who alone are their refuge in their desolation, their support in their weakness, [Page 57] the sacred tie that binds them to God, and their succor against the powers of Hell.\n\nBeyond a doubt, these are reasonable fears,  difficulties capable of arresting our minds, obstacles insurmountable to our weakness, and misfortunes that seem inevitable,  if France does not make [151] extraordinary efforts to overthrow this enemy, who with one and the same blow destroys these Nations and the Faith that we preach to them. To tell the truth, so many misfortunes that have followed one another, and so powerful opposition to the designs that bring us here, would have caused us to lose courage, did we not raise our eyes higher, and if our confidence were not upheld by Heaven. But when we think that these are the affairs of God more than ours; that the Faith has not been founded anywhere in the World except in the midst of tempests; that God has always been pleased to manifest his power where there is least of human strength; that his arm is not shortened; when we think that the Blood of Jesus Christ has been shed no less for these nations than for the remainder of the earth, and that the fruits of his love are not exhausted for those who have already acknowledged him as their Savior; that he must be adored by all the peoples of the earth, and be praised by as many tongues as there are in the Universe; when we see Nations surrounding us on all sides and almost an entire world where his holy Name has never been adored, [152] and where nevertheless it must be that the Gospel shall have penetrated before the end of the ages, since God has pledged his word to it; when we see with our own eyes what he has already begun there, and that he alone has worked there more than we have,  that [Page 59] he performs every day miracles greater than the creation of a new World would be, changing the hearts of Barbarians into Christian hearts; finally, when we think that God never leaves his work unfinished; that his glory is at stake and not ours:  then we consider nothing impossible; we hope against all hope; our confidence is as great as ever; both on account of the pledges of his love in the past, in favor of these nations, and of what he does there now, we feel assured that he will not fail them in the future.\n\nFor notwithstanding all these ravages of plagues, of famines, and of wars; whatever opposition there may be in the nature of these peoples, in their laws, and in their customs, to the holiness of the Faith; whatever Dominion the Demons may have  we have not failed each year to baptize a goodly number, and even this past year more than one hundred and seventy. And though God has disposed [153] of the majority,  several of whom are in Heaven as we have every reason to believer  we have, nevertheless, the consolation of seeing in the midst of this barbarism seven small Churches, wherein the hand of God has worked far more than we; wherein the Spirit of the Faith reigns, and finds nothing barbarous in the hearts of those whom it chooses to subdue to itself; wherein Innocence preserves itself in the midst of impurity. This induces us to say, without the shadow of a doubt, Digitus Dei est hic. Now, as God is for us, can we really feel fear amid our undertakings, without exposing ourselves to the reproaches addressed by the Savior of the world to St. Peter: Modiæ fidei quare dubitasti?\n\nBut I am afraid that too much fear is felt for us, and that want of confidence on the part of those who [Page 61] are far from the fight will arrest the course of the victories that the Faith gains here over impiety. I mean to say that the doubts that may exist in France with reference to the conversion of these nations is one of the greatest impediments that can be offered; and that God may withdraw his favors from these pagan countries because, in the midst of tempests, confidence in him has been withdrawn. For, in [154] truth, it is easy to despair of the conversion of these nations,  even in this presumption alone, that, because they are barbarians, some can hardly believe them to be men, and that we can hardly make Christians of them. But it is wrong to judge thus; for I can say in truth that, as regards Intelligence, they are in no wise inferior to Europeans and to those who dwell in France. I would never have believed that, without instruction, nature could have supplied a most ready and vigorous eloquence, which I have admired in many Hurons; or more clear-sightedness in affairs, or a more discreet management in things to which they are accustomed. Why, then, should they be incapable of having a knowledge of a true God?\n\nIn truth, their customs are barbarous in a thousand matters; but after all, in those practices which among them are regarded as evil acts and are condemned by the public, we find without comparison much less disorder than there is in France, though here the mere shame of having committed the crime is the offenders punishment. What, therefore, would their innocence be if the Faith reigned among them?\n\nAt present we have a greater [155] knowledge than ever of their language, of their customs, and of the means that must be taken to enter into their minds [Page 63] and hearts, and, by winning them over to ourselves, to gain them for Heaven. We find it very easy to expound to them the truths of our Faith which, at the beginning, seemed to us the most difficult to explain, owing to the poverty of their language in such matters, and the ignorance in which they had always lived of things beyond the reach of sight and of the senses. They can no longer reply to us that indeed the Law of Jesus Christ that we preach to them is holy, but that it is impossible for them; for they have seen their countrymen  born in barbarism as well as they, brought up in their customs, fed on their vices, and engulfed as much as they in the impiety that floods all these countries  save themselves from the wreck, cast off nature, clothe themselves with the holiest Virtues of Christianity, and have nothing but horror for earthly pleasures, and no love but for Heaven. They are compelled to confess that God is the master of all hearts, and that his goodness is greater than our evil deeds; when they see [156] every day that those who had had the greatest aversion for our Mysteries are the first to submit to the truth, that Faith opens the Mind; and that, when God has taken possession of their souls, they are more strongly affected by good than they had been attracted by evil.\n\nThe constancy and long-suffering of our Fathers in so laborious a life, in an employment for which nature and all the senses can feel nothing but aversion, in a matter which is not ours, or, at least, from which our Savages see very well that we derive no profit; a courage so invincible in the midst of so strong opposition to the designs that bring us here,  these now serve them as a very powerful reason for [Page 65] rendering the truths of our Faith more credible and more adorable to them. In a word, they admit that it must, beyond a doubt, be true that Heavens pleasures surpass all those of earth, since solely the hope of gaining it makes those who live in that Faith despise all that is pleasant in life, and sweetens for them the bitterness both of life and of death.\n\nAfter this, are we not right in raising our hopes more than ever, and [157] in believing that that all-powerful hand, which out of nothing produced these beginnings, will continue its work; that the Holy Ghost will bless this propitious seed; and that, after having himself inspired dispositions so advantageous to what we most hope for, he will make it fruitful and turn an unfertile soil and an infidel world into a land of holiness and into a Christian world?\n\nIf we had but the Hurons to convert, it might even be thought, perhaps, that from ten to twenty thousand souls are not so great a conquest that one should expose himself to so many hazards and encounter so many dangers, to win them to God. But we are only at the entrance of a land which on the side of the West, as far as China, is full of Nations more populous than the Hurons; toward the South, we see other Peoples beyond number, to whom we can have access only by means of this door at which we now stand. Therefore, since God has called us the first to cultivate this vine for him, should we not be faithful to him with that patience that he recommends to his Apostles,  Fructum afferet in patientia, waiting until he himself [158] gathers the fruits thereof at such time and at such moment as will please him? If we have not that consolation in this life, it will be a sufficient reward for us to have devoted our efforts [Page 67] to it; and, whatever happens, at least we will cheerfully die in the thought that these words of Our Lord will be accomplished in us: Alius est qui seminat, et alius qui metit; that others will enter into our work; that they will enjoy the harvest of which we have sown the first seeds; that they will gather the fruits watered with our sweat and with our blood; and, finally, that God will derive his glory and the salvation of his Elect from our willingness to live and to die in that holy employment to which our vocation so happily pledges us, that I may say in truth that God has exceeded our hopes, and that before my departure from this Huron Country, from which obedience recalls me, I see with my own eyes accomplished in seven years what I would have considered myself very happy to have learned from afar, at the end of a long life, and of which perhaps I would have had some trouble in convincing myself, if I myself had not been an eyewitness of it.\n\nOur previous Relations may have [159] conveyed some idea of it, and perhaps they will have sufficiently shown that God makes no distinction of persons; that his Love does not despise Barbarians; that his kindness makes itself felt as much by our poor Savages as by the most civilized nations of the earth: that Heavens graces do not fall upon countries in proportion to the riches bestowed by nature; and, in a word, that our Hurons are no less born for Heaven than those who have enjoyed the treasures of the Faith a thousand and two thousand years before they have. Now, since that time God has not withdrawn his favors from those little Churches; he is ever their Father, and ever liberal to those who invoke him. [Page 69]\n\nThis is saying in two lines what an entire Relation could have contained, had I chosen to enter more into details, and had not the briefness of a letter compelled me to think of concluding this one. However,  to avoid another extreme, and perhaps blame for having been too brief in matters which show the goodness of God to these peoples, and which oblige us to praise his mercies,  I shall relate some of these, [160] but with no other order than that suggested by the confused recollection that I have of them.\n\nA Christian who had recently escaped from captivity, and who saw himself on his arrival surrounded by his relatives, who came to console him, astonished all present by the words that he used. My friends, he said, God did not abandon me in my captivity. If we should often think of him in prosperity we should also pray to him unceasingly in the height of our troubles. We hear, as it were, a voice within, replying to us that the evils of this life are nothing, that there is a Paradise awaiting us, and that death  which is all the less remote from us, the greater are our sufferings  will soon place us in possession of a happiness of which our cruelest enemies cannot deprive us.\n\nSuch, said he, were the thoughts that consoled me in the midst of the most frightful tortures that the Hiroquois made me endure, when they applied fire and glowing flames to me. Then I felt truly that God helped me; that he was within me, and animated my [161] heart. I know not how it could have been, but it is true that my soul felt unspeakable pleasures, at the very time when my body endured the greatest pain. After these first sufferings, they consulted whether I was destined for [Page 71] death, or whether my life should be spared. I knew not which of the two to desire, and I did not dare to ask God, except that he might send me either life or death, as he deemed best for my salvation, since I was but a child, and he was my Father who alone knew what was best for me, and loved me more than I can love myself.\n\nAlmost at the same time, another Christian, who was about to go to war, was questioned how he would behave if he were captured by the enemy. I cannot, he replied, promise anything of myself, knowing the little good that I can do; but for more than six months I have been questioning myself, and sounding the depths of my heart, and it seems to me each time that nothing in the world could make me forget Heaven. God, said he, has deprived me of nearly all my relatives; he has stripped me of my goods. I am waiting now [162] until he tries me in my own person; and perhaps he will permit that I be captured by the enemies and burned in their fires. I dread this, it is true; but I nevertheless control myself when I say my prayers to him. I merely say to him that he sees very well what my heart fears the most, but that I do not ask him to deliver me from it so long as he preserves me in the Spirit of Faith and in the hope of Paradise,  promising myself that, after that, neither the fires nor the flames of the Hiroquois can deprive me of the desire that I have to live and die a Christian, in whatever situation I may be.\n\nAnother, who was taken prisoner by the Hiroquois this Summer, broke from his bonds two hours before they were to burn him, escaped quite naked, and fled through briers and thorns, wherein the enemy [Page 73] pursued him almost an entire day. He found that, after escaping one misfortune, he fell into ten others; he wandered in the woods for three days without food; the mosquitoes disturbed his rest night and day, piercing him with their stings from head to foot; the whole of his body was but one sore; and finally he despaired of his [163] life. Finding himself still at a distance of more than sixty leagues from any settlement  in a country where the Hirequois are ever hunting men, and where every step that he took to avoid the enemy would, he feared, lead him into their ambushes,  his strength at last failed him; and, as he could proceed no farther, he resolved to die upon a bare rock that he chose for his tomb, when some Huron canoes fortunately caught sight of him, and drew him from the gates of death. I Alas! said that good Christian, I thought not of my misfortunes, or, at least, I could bear them in the thought that I escaped a greater evil. If dread of a fire that would have burned me but for one night made me insensible to so much misery, could I now, he said, find the yoke of the Faith a heavy one, and can the troubles that have to be endured in Gods service really seem troubles to us, if we truly believe that there is a Hell, and that we must suffer in this world in order not to suffer forever?\n\nWhen I was in the fires of the Hiroquois, said another Christian, who had felt their severity, this [164] thought consoled me, that God had ordered it. My sufferings were excessive, and yet I could not in any way complain of his kindness; and, whatever evil he may allow to happen to me, I hereafter believe that it can be only through love, since he has shown it to me by calling me to the Faith, and [Page 75] opening to me his Paradise. After that, they may burn me, they may torture me, and make me suffer a thousand deaths; but they cannot prevent my loving him.\n\nAnimated by the same sentiment, a good Old Man replied to some Infidels, who reproached him, saying that his Faith was useless, since the God whom he adored did not cure him of a painful disease, which made his life not a blessing for which he should thank him, but an unbearable burden. My friends, he said to them, you would condemn your own words if you would raise your eyes to Heaven, to which I try to keep my heart attached. You count the diseases of the body in the number of misfortunes; and, in truth, they are a misfortune for you, who know no other happiness than in this life. But the Christians look upon them as a blessing, [165] when they think of what the Faith teaches us,  that God will reward us in Heaven according to the measure of our sorrows and of our joys, provided we thank him alike for both, because he orders both of them for our good, the reason being, doubtless, that he loves us even in this life since he will love us forever.\n\nThe answer of another Old Man, aged 70 years, was no less inspired by the Spirit of Faith, when the reproach was cast at him that God had no pity on him, because of a stroke of paralysis that had deprived him of the use of an arm. What! he replied, would you wish that there should be no dried trees in the woods and no dead branches on a tree that is growing old? For my part, I take pleasure in seeing my limbs wither; and the approach of death has not frightened me, since I have the Faith [Page 77] that one day I shall rise again in glory, and that this dying body must rot in the ground before it can become immortal.\n\nWhen the same man heard that his only son, who remained to him as a support in his old age, had fallen into the hands of the enemies, and when he saw all the people in his [166] Cabin weeping at the news, he said: For my part, I have no tears for him; he had followed me in the Faith; he has gone before me to that happiness which awaits us after death. At the same time, he came promptly into the Church at ten oclock at night, to offer his only son to God, but with a resignation worthy of a truly Christian heart. My God, he exclaimed, what a precious gift is Faith, and how gently it allays the emotions of a heart that confides in your promises! You had given him to me before I had the happiness of acknowledging you as my God and my benefactor. Since I have had Faith, I have offered him to you a thousand times; and you, who penetrate into the depths of our hearts, have known that my offering was not a feigned one. You have taken me at my word, and have received what belonged to you even before I had offered it to you. Can I complain because you have accepted the gift that I made you? Praise be to you, my God; and if after the Child you deign to receive the Father, I offer myself to you as willingly as I offered my son. Have pity on both. Hardly [167] was his prayer ended, when another Messenger, who had been present at the fight, arrived, quite breathless, and reported that his son whom they thought dead had escaped with him, while the others had remained on the field. It was like that Angel who stayed Abrahams sword, already raised [Page 79] over the Innocent Isaac. My God (exclaimed this good Father, continuing his prayer), if I have received evil tidings from your hand, have I not cause now to bless you for the life of my son whom you give back to me as one risen from the dead, at the moment when I thought that he was killed? It is you who have withdrawn him from the peril; but I beg you that he may never fall into sin; and confer the same grace upon me, so that he and I may praise you in Heaven for this favor and for others, that we can never acknowledge here on earth.\n\nFaith makes no distinction between the sexes, and all ages are ripe for Heaven. A Christian woman, while speaking one day to some infidels whom she exhorted to embrace the Faith, said to them: Alas! even if there were no Paradise after death, and if our Faith [168] should deceive us, I would still believe, in order to enjoy even in this life a peace and repose of mind that cannot be conceived by those who remain in infidelity. Before my baptism, I was every day full of anxiety; present ills tormented me; fear of misfortunes that might happen to me, but which perhaps will never occur, failed not to afflict me before their time. The tidings of ills that were past renewed my sorrow, and the tears that I had already dried; and even the recollection of my former pleasures caused me regret, because they existed no longer and because I could look upon them only as lost to me. Now, nothing of all that afflicts me; but, on the contrary, I derive my good from my evil, because whenever fears, sorrows, or misfortunes assail me, I think of the happiness promised to us by the Faith which is free from any bitterness.\n\nNot long ago, she added, while I wept for [Page 81] the death of one of my brothers and of one of my children, I would never have believed that tears could be so sweet; but, while they [169] flowed from my eyes, my heart was quite consoled by the thought that those for whom I wept were in Heaven, and that an Eternity would unite us so that death could not separate us. But, they said to her, what wouldst thou say if thy husband were to die, he who refuses to become a Christian? I would console myself, she replied, with the thought that God must dispose as he wills of what belongs to him; he knows what is best, and perhaps he awaits the hour of his death to grant him a grace of which he renders himself unworthy during the course of his life.\n\nA young Christian woman in her first confinement betrayed no sign of pain. When she was asked if, in reality, she had not suffered, she replied: Alas, the pains were excessive; but I thought of God and of the blessing of the Faith, which has delivered me from eternal torment. I offered him at the same time the child that I brought into the world, and begged that he might die after receiving holy Baptism, rather than be permitted to fall into mortal sin.\n\nNot all our Christians [170] have such sentiments. Some have not that courage; others fall into sin, and have disastrous relapses; some lose heart in the middle of their career; all are not strong in the spirit of holiness. But I know not in what spot on earth we can find every one perfect. If the seed that Jesus Christ himself came to sow on earth fell sometimes among thorns, sometimes on rocks, and sometimes in sterile places; and if a good portion that had fallen on good ground was eaten by the [Page 83] birds before producing the fruits that were expected of it, we must not be astonished if the same thing happen here. Non erit discipulus super Magistrum. It is sufficient that a portion comes to maturity, and it is notable that in some cases this seed brings forth a hundredfold. But I cannot too often repeat that a patience is needed which can withstand every trial, and be discouraged by nothing. He who is now among the weakest will one day be a great Saint.\n\nApropos of this, I remember an answer given some time ago by a good Christian to one of our Fathers, who, observing in him [171] sentiments of eminent perfection, and being astonished at the graces that God gave him, asked him how long it was since he had attained that degree. You embarrass me as much, he replied, as if you asked me how long it is since I have reached my present stature. As my body has grown since my birth, without my perceiving it, so has my Faith grown since my Baptism. I know not, he added, what I should do to respond to these graces, or even how to pray; but what I cannot weary of telling God when I pray to him is that I believe with all my heart, and that he send me death rather than sin.\n\nA Captain, who is one of the highest in rank in the whole Country, was asked before his Baptism if he really believed the truths of our Faith. My words, he said, may mislead; but I wish my actions and my conduct to reply instead of my tongue. Wait until Winter comes, until the devils are unchained, and I am solicited to sin; then you and I shall be able to see, without being deceived, whether the Faith reign in my [172] heart. In fact, since then his actions have not belied his words; [Page 85] his life has been beyond reproach and his Faith has always been known by his works. He has been assailed a thousand times by slanders and by calumnies; his relatives have risen against him; his friends have openly made war on him; and in secret the beauties who formerly had vanquished him have endeavored to ruin him by loving him; but he has always been true to himself, and, armed at all points with Faith, he has been victorious.\n\nShortly after his Baptism, when he saw that, in the performance of the duties of his office of Captain, he was called upon to be present at some superstitious ceremonies forbidden to Christians, he left the Company, and gave orders in his cabin to bear elsewhere the symbols of his authority and the public presents of which he was the custodian. These are not the Regalia nor the immense riches of European Princes; but they are what is here considered the most honored and the most precious treasures of the Country. The Infidels were astonished at this act; his father, his wife, his relatives asked him what he meant to do. I am a Christian, he replied; and if to avoid [173] sin I must abandon even life, my soul is not attached to my body. The village is in a commotion; the council meets to deliberate on the matter; the leading men are deputed to wait on him, and they beg him not to abandon them. I am a Christian, is his only answer; the Faith is dearer to me than honor and wealth. They spend the night and day in endeavoring to bend his will; but his only answer is that he is a Christian. Then, said the Elders, we must resign ourselves to seeing our Country ruined, since our chief Captains range themselves on the side of the Faith. [Page 87] How can we prevent this disorder? YOU are thinking of it too late, he replies; you should have opposed the progress of the Faith before it had entered our hearts. NOW it will reign there in spite of you; and it will be easier to tear our souls from our bodies than to remove from our minds the fear of Hell-fire, and the desire for the happiness that awaits us in Heaven. At last, to find a way out of this difficulty, which the Elders feared would bring about the dissolution of their village, which is the largest, or at least one of the largest, in the Huron country, the Council decided that it was necessary to divide the office that this Christian Captain [174] so obstinately persisted in resigning; that some one else should thereafter take charge of the matters forbidden by the Faith, who might be called the Devils Deputy; that the Christian should continue to administer public affairs, and should always be acknowledged as their real Captain. He was begged to accept, inasmuch as, by thus delivering him from the things of which he had a horror, he had nothing more to complain of. Yes, I can do so now, he replied; but know once for all that a true Christian considers nothing more precious than the Faith, and that he thinks little of earth when he looks at Heaven.\n\nSuch men are, without doubt, powerful supporters of the Faith; but it seems that God intends that we should place our confidence in none other than him. Our Christians on going to war had taken with them two Infidel Captains, who were among the most war-like in the country, and undertook to win them over to our Faith; they instructed them so successfully, during the two months that the campaign lasted, [Page 89] that they were obliged to baptize them because they could not refuse the urgent requests [175] made to them by these good Catechumens,  who, they said could no longer march bravely in the enemies country when they thought that each day would be the last of their lives, and that, if they died before being immersed in the waters of Baptism, they would be damned for eternity; and that, consequently, each step that they took led them as much toward Hell as toward death.\n\nSo reasonable a request on their part had to be complied with. They knelt on the shore of the lake of the Hiroquois. Two Christians, who had taken charge of instructing them, baptized them publicly, each baptizing him whom he had had for his disciple. I think that the Angels of Heaven took pleasure in watching this holy spectacle in a place where they had never seen God adored; and that doubtless the guardian Angels of these two newly-baptized men had hastened this action, in prevision of their happiness and of their death; for the enemy soon made his appearance. Our Christians at once said their public prayers, to prepare themselves for battle. The two good Neophytes [176] placed themselves at the head of their army, and long withstood the assaults of the enemy; finally, their loss caused the defeat of the Hurons, and left the victory entirely in the hands of the Hiroquois, who were seven to one. But, if our Church has lost by the death of those two Captains and of many Christians who remained on the field with them, for not one fled, it must suffice for us that God has derived his glory from it, and that Heaven has been enriched by our spoils: Novit Dominus qui sunt ejus. God knows his Elect, and [Page 91] chooses the proper moment for opening his Paradise to them. Here is an example which has often made me adore his divine ways.\n\nA young man  a Catechumen, who could not obtain Baptism from us because we did not see clearly enough into his Faith  resolved to go to war with some Christians. They said their public prayers, night and morning; the oldest of the Christians presided at them, and on Sundays he exhorted them to pass that sacred day in a more holy manner, and, since they could not enjoy the blessing of confession, at least to have recourse to God, to detest their sins, and to keep themselves prepared for death. [177] I know not what pressed this young Neophyte so strongly; but, for over seventy days, he kept asking for Baptism from the oldest of our Christians, with such fervor in his requests that finally he was promised that he should be baptized on the Sunday. No, said he, my soul pants but for the sacred waters of Baptism. I detest with all my heart the sins of my past life; I hope that God will have pity on me, because he has witnessed the true desire that I have to live and die a Christian. He was therefore baptized; and, strange to say, the prayers were not yet ended when the advance guard brought the news that they perceived the enemy. All immediately hasten to arms, and take the field; the enemy flees, and is pursued for six whole hours. The newly-baptized man leaves his comrades behind, and advances so far that he finds himself alone, surrounded by thirty Hiroquois, who pierce him with javelin thrusts, remove his scalp, and continue their flight without one of them being caught.\n\nOne of the most right-minded men of this Country, [Page 93] and one of the best informed as regards the Faith, had for six whole years [178] refused Baptism; he admitted to us that he saw the truth very clearly, but that he did not feel within himself enough strength thoroughly to give up sin. Finally, he came one day to one of our Fathers and said to him: Now I beg thee to baptize me. My heart tells me that I shall bear with me to Heaven the innocence of my Baptism; why therefore should I defer it any longer I He is baptized at the beginning of the Autumn; and, throughout the Winter, the Christians and Infidels admire the power of Baptism in him. He voluntarily abstains from feasts, lest he find therein some occasion for sin; he keeps away from company; the women who had formerly most possessed his heart now find no entrance there,  he has neither eyes nor tongue for them; the conversations most agreeable to him are those with the Father who instructs him. When Summer comes, he embarks to go down to Kebec, and, for his last Adieu to his wife and children, he says: I know not whether I am going to death; but, whatever may happen to me, know that I will die a Christian; and if you seek me when I have departed this life, and if you retain any love for [179] me, lift your eyes to Heaven for it is thither that my soul aspires, and whither I believe without any doubt that Faith leads me for an Eternity. In fact, he met the enemies and defended himself bravely. He had already overturned one of their Canoes in the water, when a shot from an arquebus pierced his head through and through, and placed him in the enjoyment of the happiness that he had hoped for, since so innocent a life could only be followed by a saintly death. [Page 95]\n\nWe witness every day a thousand similar events, in which we see the kindness of God toward these peoples, his love for these poor barbarians, and the intentions of his divine Providence, toward his Elect, not one of whom shall be taken from him, whatever opposition hell and the devils may excite against the progress of the Faith.\n\nBut this is too long for a mere letter, and the little that I have said is sufficient to lead us reasonably to hope that Heaven does not withdraw its blessings from this nascent Church, since it takes such loving care of it.\n\nOf the seven Churches that we have here, six are stationary; the first is at our [180 i.e., 180] House of sainte Marie, the five others in the principal Huron villages,  la Conception, saint Joseph, saint Michel, saint Ignace, and saint Jean Baptiste. The seventh Church called that of the Holy Ghost, consists of Algonquins, several Tribes of whom wintered together this year on the Great Lake of our Hurons, about twenty-five leagues from us. This compelled Father Claude Pijart and Father Leonard Garreau who were appointed for their instruction, to pass the Winter with them,  with inconceivable trouble and labors, but not without consolation, when they see that they prepare Spouses for Jesus Christ within these woods, and amid these lakes and rivers.\n\nThis, my Reverend Father, is a portion of what I had undertaken in order to give Your Reverence in this letter a general idea of the state in which I leave this Mission of our Society in the Huron country, and the opinions that I have concerning it before my departure, after having lived there, a useless servant, for seven years. For if God secure his glory in [Page 97] these Countries, and if he has obtained any good in these beginnings of the conversion of these Peoples, it must be admitted that, after [181] God, all is due to the labors of our Fathers, of which Our Lord has chosen that I should be a witness. I have seen the fervor of their zeal, their indomitable courage, their patience in enduring everything, their activity in performing all duties, their humility in a life truly hidden in an unknown world,  persons moreover, for the most part, who are not wanting in qualities that would have rendered them commendable in France. When I see that they embrace the Cross with pleasure, sufferings with joy, and scorn with love; that they each day carry their souls in their hands, being continually exposed to a thousand dangers of death, and that perhaps the majority of them are destined to die in the midst of the fires and flames of a cruel enemy, who ravages these Countries from day to day; when I see that these dangers animate their courage rather than depress it in the least:  the thought frequently comes to my mind that God willed that so strong, so constant, and so vigorous a virtue should supply the absence of miracles, which it seems that his divine Providence does not consent to employ in these latter ages, to further the conversion of these pagan lands.\n\n[182] But the number of these laborers is too small for so many people; we need help in this more than in anything else; we ask assistance, and we hope that Old France will not deny it to New France. It is true that dangers are to be dreaded, and that whoever comes to us must have left behind him in France all love of life, to abandon himself without reserve to whatever can cause most horror to nature. But [Page 99] this I think is what should excite in a good heart the desire to come to these lost lands; to lose himself here in a holy manner, and to find in this world nothing lovable but God. If persons of merit, whose life is precious to an entire Kingdom, expose themselves willingly in the assault of a breach, which frequently is not reasonable; and if the death of those who have stood in the van does not daunt a brave Nobility, most of whom are often incited but by interests of a temporal honor or benefit,  doubtless the conquest of so many souls, each of whom is a Kingdom for Jesus Christ, the prospect of an eternal reward, and the desire [183] of living and dying in the service of a God who was the first to die for us, will have a thousand times more force to sustain the courage of those whom Our Lord may send us, through the perils that must be encountered at any cost, if we wish to advance his glory in these Countries, where we see that it is his will to be adored.\n\nThis is the only request that I make to Your Reverence on leaving these Countries, begging you to procure that assistance for us, and to send us those whom God may select through you; and in this hope I shall conclude the present letter, begging you to commend this Mission to the prayers of all our Fathers and Brethren, and to remember it particularly in your own holy Sacrifices. This, my Reverend Father, from\n\nYour Reverences\n\nFrom the Huron country, this 15th of May, 1645.\n\nVery humble and greatly obliged\n\nservant in Our Lord,\n\nHierosme Lalemant.\n\nLVI  LIX\n\nMISCELLANEOUS DOCUMENTS, 1646\n\nLVL.  Novum Belgium (1643)) par le P.

The entrance to the River, which some call the River Nassau, or the great River of the North, to distinguish it from another which they call South River,  and some charts, I believe, that I have recently seen, the River Maurice,  is in the latitude of 40 degrees, 30 minutes.[2] Its channel is deep, and navigable by the largest ships, which go up to Manhattes Island, which is 7 leagues in circumference; thereon is a fort intended to serve as nucleus for a town to be built, and to be called New Amsterdam.\n\nThis fort, which is at the point of the island, about 5 or 6 leagues from the rivers mouth, is called fort Amsterdam; it has 4 regular bastions, provided with several pieces of artillery. All these bastions and the curtains were, in the year 1643, merely earthworks, most of which had quite given way, and through them the fort could be entered from all sides; there were no trenches. For the defense of this fort,  and of another which they had built, farther on, against the incursions of the savages, their enemies,  there were 60 soldiers. They were beginning to case the gates and the bastions with stone. In this [Page 105] fort there was a house of worship, built of stone, which was quite spacious; the house of the Governor,  whom they call the director General,  built quite neatly of brick; and the storehouses and soldiers quarters.\n\nThere may be, on the Island of Manhate and in its environs, about 4 or five hundred men of various sects and nations,  the Director General told me that there were men of eighteen different languages; they are scattered here and there, up and down the stream, according as the beauty or convenience of the sites invited each one to settle. Some artisans, however, who work at their trades, are located under cover of the fort; while all the others are exposed to the incursions of the Savages, who, in the year 1643, when I was there, had actually killed about forty Hollanders, and burned many houses, and barns full of wheat.\n\nThe River, which is very straight, and flows directly from North to South, is at least a league wide before the Fort. The ships are at anchor in a bay which forms the other side of the island, and they can be defended by the Fort.\n\nShortly before I arrived there, 3 large ships of 300 tons had come to load wheat; two had received their lading, but the 3rd could not be laden, because the savages had burned a part of the grain. These ships had sailed from the West Indies, where the West India Company usually maintains seventeen war vessels.[3]\n\nThere is no exercise of Religion except the Calvinist, and the orders declare that none but Calvinists be admitted; nevertheless, that point is not observed,  for besides the Calvinists, there are in this [Page 107] settlement Catholics, English Puritans, Lutherans, Anabaptists, whom they call Mnistes,[4] etc.\n\nWhen any one comes for the first time to dwell in the country, they furnish him horses, cows, etc., and give him provisions,  all which he repays when he is well settled; and, as for lands, at the end of ten years he gives the Company of the West Indies a tenth of the produce that he harvests.[5]\n\nThis country has for limits on the New England side a River which they call the Fresh River, which serves as boundary between them and the English;[6] nevertheless, the English approach them very closely,  preferring to have lands among the Dutch, who require nothing from them, to depending upon English Milords, who exact rents and like to put on airs of being absolute. On the other side,  the Southern, toward Virginia,  it has for limits the River which they call South River, on which there is also a Dutch settlement; but at its entrance the Swedes have another, extremely well equipped with cannon and people. It is believed that these Swedes are maintained by Amsterdam merchants, incensed because the Company of the west Indies monopolizes all the trade of these regions. It is toward this River that they have found, as is said, a gold mine.[7]\n\nSee in the book of sieur De Laet, of Antwerp, the table, and the account of new Belgium,[8] as he sometimes calls it; or the great map of Nova Anglia, Novum Belgium, et Virginia.\n\nDuring fully 50 years the Dutch have frequented these regions. In the year 1615, the fort was begun; about 20 years ago, they began to make a settlement; and now there is already some little trade with Virginia and New England. [Page 109]\n\nThe first comers found lands quite suitable for use, cleared in former times by the savages, who tilled their fields there. Those who have come since have made clearings in the woods, which are commonly of oak; the lands are good. Deer hunting is abundant toward autumn. There are some dwellings built of stone: they make the lime with oyster shells, of which there are great heaps made in former times by the savages, who partly live by that fishery.\n\nThe climate there is very mild; as that region is situated at 40 and two-thirds degrees, there are plenty of European fruits, as apples, pears, Cherries. I arrived there in October, and even then I found many Peaches.\n\nAscending the River as far as the 43rd degree, you find the 2nd settlement, which the flow and Ebb of the tide reaches, but extends no further; ships of 100 and a hundred and twenty tons can land there.\n\nThere are two items in this settlement, which is called Renselaerswick,  as if one should say, the settlement of Renselaers, who is a wealthy merchant of Amsterdam: first, a wretched little fort, named Fort orange,  built of logs, with 4 or 5 pieces of Breteuil cannon, and as many swivel guns,  which the Company of the West Indies has reserved for itself, and which it maintains. This fort was formerly on an Island formed by the River; it is now on the mainland on the side of the Hiroquois, a little above the said Island.[9] There is, secondly, a Colony sent thither by that Renselaers, who is its Patron. This colony is composed of about a hundred persons, who live in 25 or 30 houses built along the River, as each has found convenient. In the principal house is lodged the Patrons representative; [Page 111] the Minister has his own house apart, in which Preaching is held. There is also a sort of Bailiff, whom they call Seneschal, who has charge of Justice. All their houses are merely of boards, and are covered with thatch. There is as yet no masonry, except in the chimneys.\n\nAs the forests supply many stout pines, the people make boards by means of their mills, which they have for this purpose.\n\nThey have found some very suitable lands, which the savages had formerly prepared, on which they plant corn and oats, for their beer, and for the horses, of which they have a great many. There are few lands fit to be tilled, as they are narrowed by hills, which are poor soil; that obliges them to separate from one another, and they already hold two or 3 leagues of territory.\n\nTrade is free to every one, which enables the savages to obtain all things very cheaply: each of the Dutch outbidding his companion, and being satisfied, provided he can gain some little profit.\n\nThis settlement is not more than 20 leagues from the Agniehronons; there is access to them either by land or by water,  the River on which the Iroquois dwell falling into that which passes by the Dutch; but there are many shallow rapids, and a fall of a short half-league, past which the canoe must be carried.\n\nThere are several nations between the two Dutch settlements, which are 30 German leagues apart,  that is to say, 50 or 60 French leagues. The Wolves, whom the Iroquois call Agotsaganens, are the nearest to the settlement of Renselaerswick or to the fort of orange.[10] Several years ago, there being a war [Page 113] between the Iroquois and the Wolves, the Dutch Joined these latter against the others; but, 4 having been taken and burned, peace was made. Later, some nations near the sea having slain some Dutch of the most remote settlement, the Dutch killed 150 savages,  not only men and women, but little children. The savages having, in various reprisals, killed 40 Dutch, burned many houses, and wrought damage reckoned, at the time when I was there, at 200,000ll,  two hundred thousand livres,  troops were levied in New England. Accordingly, at the beginning of winter, the grass being short, and some snow on the ground, they gave the savages chase with six hundred men, two hundred being always on the march and one set continually relieving another. The result was, that, being shut up on a great Island, and unable to flee easily, because of the women and children, there were as many as sixteen hundred killed, including women and children. This compelled the remainder of the savages to make peace, which still continues. That occurred in 1643 and 1644.\n\nFrom 3 Rivers, in\n\nNew France,\n\nAugust 3, 1646.\n\n[Page 115]\n\nAccount of René Goupil (donné), by Father Isaac\n\nJogues.\n\nR\n\nENÉ Goupil was a native of Anjou, who, in the bloom of his youth, urgently requested to be received into our Novitiate at Paris, where he remained some months with much edification. His bodily indispositions having taken from him the happiness of consecrating himself to God in holy Religion,  for which he had a strong desire,  he journeyed, when his health improved, to New France, in order to serve the society there, since he had not had the blessing of giving himself to it in old France. And, in order to do nothing in his own right,  although he was fully master of his own actions,  he totally submitted himself to the guidance of the superior of the Mission, who employed him two whole years in the meanest offices about the house, in which he acquitted himself with great humility and Charity. He was also given the care of nursing the sick and the wounded at the hospital, which he did with as much skill  for he understood surgery well  as with affection and love, continually seeing Our Lord in their persons. He left so sweet an odor of his goodness and his other virtues in that place, that his memory is still blessed there.\n\nWhen we came down from the Hurons in July, 1642, we asked Reverend Father Vimont to let us take him with us, because the Hurons had great need of a Surgeon; he granted our request. [Page 117]\n\nI cannot express the joy which this good young man felt when the superior told him that he might make ready for the journey. Nevertheless, he well knew the great dangers that await one upon the river; he knew how the Iroquois were enraged against the French. Yet that could not prevent him  at the least sign of the will of him to whom he had voluntarily committed all his concerns  from setting forth for 3 Rivers.\n\nWe departed thence on the 1st of August,  the day after the feast of Our Blessed Father. On the 2nd, we encountered the enemies, who, separated into two bands, were awaiting us with the advantage which a great number of chosen men, fighting on land, can have over a small and promiscuous band, who are upon the water in scattered canoes of bark.\n\nNearly all the Hurons had fled into the woods, and, as they had left us, we were seized. On this occasion his virtue was very manifest; for, as soon as he saw himself captured, he said to me: 0 my father, God be blessed; he has permitted it, he has willed it,  his holy will be done. I love it, I desire it, I cherish it, I embrace it with all the strength of my heart. Meantime, while the enemies pursued the fugitives, I heard his confession, and gave him absolution,  not knowing what might befall us after our capture. The enemies having returned from their hunt, fell upon us like mad dogs, with sharp teeth,  tearing out our nails, and crushing our fingers, which he endured with much patience and courage.\n\nHis presence of mind in so grievous a mishap appeared especially in this, that he aided me, notwithstanding the pain of his wounds, as well as he could, in the instruction of the captive Hurons who [Page 119] were not Christians. While I was instructing them separately, and as they came, he called my attention to the fact that a poor old man, named Ondouterraon, was among those whom they would probably kill on the spot,  their custom being always to sacrifice some one in the heat of their fury. I instructed this man at leisure, while the enemies were attending to the distribution of t"
