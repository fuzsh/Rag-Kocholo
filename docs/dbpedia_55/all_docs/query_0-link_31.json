Enterovirulent bacteria interact with the epithelial polarized cells lining the intestinal barrier, and some invade the cells. A better understanding of the cross talk between enterovirulent bacteria and the polarized intestinal cells has resulted in the identification of essential enterovirulent bacterial structures and virulence gene products playing pivotal roles in pathogenesis. Cultured animal cell lines and cultured human nonintestinal, undifferentiated epithelial cells have been extensively used for understanding the mechanisms by which some human enterovirulent bacteria induce intestinal disorders. Human colon carcinoma cell lines which are able to express in culture the functional and structural characteristics of mature enterocytes and goblet cells have been established, mimicking structurally and functionally an intestinal epithelial barrier. Moreover, Caco-2-derived M-like cells have been established, mimicking the bacterial capture property of M cells of Peyer's patches. This review intends to analyze the cellular and molecular mechanisms of pathogenesis of human enterovirulent bacteria observed in infected cultured human colon carcinoma enterocyte-like HT-29 subpopulations, enterocyte-like Caco-2 and clone cells, the colonic T84 cell line, HT-29 mucus-secreting cell subpopulations, and Caco-2-derived M-like cells, including cell association, cell entry, intracellular lifestyle, structural lesions at the brush border, functional lesions in enterocytes and goblet cells, functional and structural lesions at the junctional domain, and host cellular defense responses.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThe intestine is divided into four anatomical segments: the duodenum, jejunum, ileum, and colon (1). The intestinal epithelium functions as a physical and chemical barrier that protects the host from attack by potentially harmful enterovirulent microorganisms (2) ( ). To enable it to do this, the intestinal tract consists of a complex ecosystem that combines cells of various phenotypes lining the epithelial barrier plus the resident microbiota ( and ). The intestinal mucosa has a surface coating of mucus that is secreted by the specialized goblet cells, which are also known as mucin-secreting cells, and which creates a physical barrier (3). Host defense systems against the unwelcome intrusion of pathogenic enteric microorganisms include both adaptive immunity and innate immunity. The intestinal epithelium senses the microbial environment in order to trigger strong cellular defense responses when this is required, by releasing host cell signaling molecules, such as cytokines and chemokines, which in turn trigger the recruitment of leukocytes and initiate the attraction of immune cells (4–7). Following infection by some enterovirulent bacteria, the host engages a rapid and appropriate innate immune response to control the enteric infection, but strong innate immune responses can be deleterious for the host by inducing severe lesions at the intestinal epithelial barrier. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are one of the families of pathogen recognition receptors (PRRs), including retinoic acid-inducible gene 1 (RIG-1)-like receptors (RLRs), NOD-like receptors (NLRs), and DNA receptors (cytosolic sensors for DNA), which are known to play a crucial role in host defense. These PPRs recognize pathogens that express several signature molecules, known as pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). After recognition by PAMPs, PRRs rapidly trigger an array of antimicrobial immune responses but also long-lasting adaptive immunity responses. The epithelium also provides antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), including defensins, C-type lectins, and cathelicidins produced by enterocytes and Paneth cells, all of which function to rapidly kill or inactivate pathogenic microorganisms (8, 9). In addition, autophagy, an evolutionarily conserved process by which cell constituents are broken down and recycled (10), also acts as a cell-autonomous defense against intracellular pathogenic bacteria (11, 12). Recently, overlaps between autophagy and innate immune signaling have been demonstrated, including responses to intracellular pathogens and damage-associated molecular patterns, such as the DNA-binding nuclear protein, high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), and interleukin-1β (IL-1β), TLRs, NLRs, and RLRs (13). Interestingly, the autophagic adaptors called SLRs (sequestosome 1/p62-like receptors) can be considered a new class of PRRs, contributing to autophagic control of intracellular microbes, including Salmonella, Listeria, and Shigella (13).\n\nThe adult human intestine contains trillions of microbes representing hundreds of species and thousands of subspecies which have a predominantly symbiotic relationship with their host (14, 15). The microbial communities are segregated into three distinct clusters referred to as “enterotypes,” each of which has a distinctive species and functional composition (16). The distribution of bacteria depends on the intestinal site; the duodenum contains far fewer resident bacteria than the ileum, and the colon contains a high level of anaerobic resident bacteria. The intestinal microbiota is involved in the regulation of intestinal epithelial cell turnover, in the structural and functional maturation of the epithelial barrier, in the first line of host defenses against the unwelcome intrusion of pathogenic bacteria, and in the immune modulation that plays a significant role in maintaining intestinal immune homeostasis (17, 18).\n\nThe mucosal surface of the intestinal tract is the largest body surface in contact with the external environment (200 to 300 m2), and it is lined by a simple columnar epithelium that is folded to form a number of invaginations that increase the overall surface area ( ). The intestinal mucosa is formed by a single layer of columnar epithelial cells, the connective tissue of the lamina propria, and the muscularis mucosa (1). The epithelial intestinal cells are constantly regenerated from a source of multipotent stem cells located in the crypts of Lieberkühnn (19) ( ). The intestinal epithelium is completely renewed every 4 to 8 days by shedding mature epithelial cells at the tip of the villi as the result of a programmed cell death process known as “anoikis,” which occurs when the cell is detached from the correct extracellular matrix, thus disrupting integrin ligation at the lateral and basal domains (20, 21). Four highly specialized cell phenotypes are present in the intestinal epithelium: enterocytes (also known as fluid-transporting cells), neuroendocrine cells, mucus-secreting cells (also known as goblet cells), and Paneth cells ( ). Moreover, M cells are located in the intestinal epithelium overlying mucosa-associated lymphoid tissues such as Peyer's patches (PPs), where they act as the antigen-sampling cells of the mucosal immune system and play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of several enterovirulent microorganisms (22). During the crypt-to-villous migration, intestinal epithelial cells acquire a high degree of structural and functional polarization and form three selective membrane domains: the apical domain, which expresses a brush border facing the luminal compartment; the lateral domain, which functions as an epithelial cell-to-cell junctional domain establishing tight contacts with neighboring cells and sealing the intestinal epithelial barrier by the presence of three well-defined cell domains (the tight junction [TJ], the adherens junction [AJ], and the desmosome); and the basal domain, which connects the polarized epithelial cells to the basement membrane (23).\n\nIn the enterocytes, which are the major epithelial lineage of the intestine, the regulated sorting and surface delivery of apical and basolateral proteins lead to the selective presence of functional proteins at each membrane domains ( ). At the enterocytic brush border are present, for example, sucrase-isomaltase (SI), alkaline phosphatase (AP), lactase-phlorizin hydrolase, maltase-glucoamylase aminopeptidase N (APN), dipeptidylpeptidase IV (DPP IV), angiotensin I-converting enzyme, α-glucosidase, p-aminobenzoic acid peptide hydrolase, glycophosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored proteins, sodium/glucose cotransporter 1 (SGLT1), the GLUT1, GLUT2, GLUT3, and GLUT5 hexose transporters, peptide transporter 1 (PEPT1), H+-coupled dipeptide transporter, cholesteryl ester transfer protein, Na+/H+ exchanger (NHE) isoforms, the Cl/HCO3 exchanger DRA (downregulated in adenoma), and some members of the aquaporin (AQP) water channel family, transporting water as well as glycerol and other solutes of small molecules (24, 25). At the basolateral domain are present, for example, Na+-K+ ATPase and diamine oxidase. Moreover, membrane-bound receptors, for example, epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor, insulin-like growth factor-binding proteins (IGF-BP-2, IGF-BP-3, and IGF-BP-4), vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) receptor, protease-activated receptor 2 (PAR-2), and nuclear hormone receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) gamma are present and control cellular functions.\n\nThe goblet cells produce and excrete 17 human mucin-type glycoproteins encoded by the MUC gene family members MUC1, MUC2, MUC3A, MUC3B, MUC4, MUC5B, MUC5AC, MUC6 to -8, MUC10 to -13, and MUC15 to -17 (HUGO/GNC; http://www.hugo-international.org). A cluster of four mucin genes (MUC2, MUC5B, MUC5AC, and MUC6) encodes secreted mucins. Eight genes, MUC1, MUC3A, MUC3B, MUC4, MUC12, MUC13, MUC16, and MUC17, encode membrane-associated mucins. The intracellular processing of mucins involves synthesis, oligomerization in the endoplasmic reticulum, glycosylation in the cis- and trans-Golgi networks, and storage in granules ( ) (3, 26, 27). Intracellular small and large vesicles package the mucins, and the viscous mucus contained in vesicles is extruded after fusion of the vesicles and plasma membranes and the formation of a fusion pore through a process requiring an expulsive force ( ). This second pathway for mucin exocytosis involves the packaging and storage of mucins in large vesicles, from which their release is regulated by specific stimuli involving signaling molecules.\n\nPaneth cells are pyramid-shaped, columnar exocrine cells (28). The ultrastructure of Paneth cells shows that they have a supranuclear region containing numerous highly electron-dense, apically located, eosinophilic secretory granules containing AMPs, and other antimicrobial molecules, including lysozyme, phospholipase A2, and α1-antitrypsin. AMPs are produced by Paneth cells and by enterocytes; all rapidly kill or inactivate pathogenic microorganisms (8).\n\nOnly about 1% of the epithelial cells lining the intestinal epithelium are enteroendocrine cells, which are subdivided into different cell types on the basis of their main secretory hormones and/or signaling molecules, such as ghrelin (B/D1 cells), serotonin (enterochromaffin cells), somatostatin (D cells), glucagon-like peptides (GLP-1 and GLP-2) and peptide YY (PYY) (L cells), gastrin (G cells), cholecystokinin (CCK) (I cells), secretin (S cells), glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide (GIP) and xenin (K cells), motilin (M cells), and neurotensin (N cells) (29). Enteroendocrine cells are conical in shape without microvilli (closed cells) or with microvilli extending into the gut lumen (open cells). Intracellular secretory granules contain hormones and peptides that are exocytosed in response to stimulation into the interstitial space from the basal cell domain ( ). Hormones and peptides act locally on neighboring cells (paracrine function), on neurons located in their proximity (neuronal function), or on distant targets, via the capillary networks of the lamina propria (endocrine function). Enteroendocrine cells secrete hormones and peptides that are well known for their effect on food intake and appetite, the regulation of glucose homeostasis, gut motility, and various other physiological functions.\n\nThe impermeability of the intestinal epithelium is structurally and functionally ensured by TJs, AJs, and the desmosome (23). TJs are the most apical intercellular protein complexes, formed by the interaction of transmembrane proteins claudins and occludin with the actin cytoskeleton via the zonula occludens 1 (ZO-1), ZO-2, and ZO-3 proteins. In addition, the transmembrane junctional adhesion molecule in the TJs is engaged in homophilic or heterophilic binding with other adhesion molecules such as integrins. Beneath the TJs, the multiprotein complexes forming the AJs are composed of transmembrane protein E-cadherin connected to intracellular components such as p120 catenin, β-catenin, and α-catenin linked to the actin cytoskeleton. Desmosomes localized beneath AJs are junctional complexes of transmembrane proteins, including desmoglein and desmocollin, which interact with desmoplakin linked to intermediate filaments. Functionally, TJs are responsible for sealing the intercellular space, and they act as a “gate” regulating the paracellular passage of particles and solutes, whereas the AJs and desmosomes act as adhesive bonds between intestinal epithelial cells, conferring mechanical strength on the intestinal epithelial barrier. Moreover, TJs also act as a “fence” separating the apical and basolateral membrane domains of polarized intestinal cells, thereby segregating the cell surface proteins and the lipids in each of the membrane domains. In addition, there is recent evidence that the enteric nervous system plays a role in modulating the epithelial barrier functions of the intestine (30).\n\nEnterovirulent bacteria execute a prodigious array of complex functions in order to survive, multiply, and disseminate within host intestinal epithelial cells. To do this, genes coding for virulence factors are present in large clusters of virulence genes known as pathogenicity islands (PAIs), which are either present on plasmids or integrated into the chromosome. Each pathovar has developed specific mechanisms for attachment, hijacking, and subverting the host cell machinery. For example, interactions between virulence factors and host cell proteins activate host cell signaling pathways controlling the structural organization of the brush border cytoskeleton or regulating the polarized organization of intestinal epithelial cells. Moreover, enterovirulent bacteria target host cell signaling pathways regulating the intracellular traffic of functional proteins or the activities of membrane-associated functional proteins and transporters. In addition, host cell signaling pathways regulating the structural organization and the functions of the junctional domains of polarized intestinal epithelial cells are subverted by some enterovirulent bacteria, which in turn alters the barrier function of the intestinal epithelium. In this review, we analyze the molecular and cellular mechanisms of virulence developed by enterovirulent bacteria that have been identified using cultured, fully differentiated human colon carcinoma cell lines, subpopulations, and clone cells expressing the functional and structural characteristics of mature enterocytes, goblet cells, or M cells.\n\nDIFFERENTIATED HUMAN COLON CANCER CELL LINES\n\nInvestigation of the mechanisms of pathogenicity of enterovirulent bacteria has long been complicated by the fact that human enterocytes and goblet cells are difficult to isolate and maintain for a long time in culture and tend to give rather variable results, depending on the particular donor. Since 1983, human colon carcinoma cell lines that are able to express the functional and structural characteristics of mature enterocytes or goblet cells in culture have been established (31), which has considerably facilitated the in vitro study of microbial pathogenesis. These cell lines were initially used to investigate basic questions related to the organization and functions of polarized human intestinal cells (32). When fully differentiated in culture, these cells display a polarized organization, form highly regulated junctional domains, and form a cell monolayer that physically and functionally mimics an intestinal epithelium barrier. They functionally mimic an intestinal epithelium barrier since each domain of these cells specifically expresses major differentiation-associated proteins that support specific intestinal functions. The parental fully differentiated human colon cancer cell lines and cell subpopulations and clones have been used since 1987 as models for investigating the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which enteric microbial pathogens hijack membrane-associated proteins, signaling pathways, and intracellular traffic functions, thus promoting structural and functional lesions and host cellular responses by enterocytes or mucin-secreting cells. An analysis of the literature reveals that some of the studies describing various different mechanisms of microbial enteric pathogenesis have been conducted using cultured human colon cancer cell lines that were not appropriately cultured. For examples, many studies have been conducted with parental HT-29 cells, which are wrongly described as “enterocyte-like cells”; in culture these cells formed multilayers of permanently undifferentiated cells which never expressed the polarized organization and the functional characteristics of fully differentiated epithelial cells that line the intestinal epithelium. For the parental Caco-2 cell line or clones, several studies indicating “enterocyte-like cells” have been conducted with cells cultured for 3 to 5 days, after which the cells either remain isolated or assemble to form islands of undifferentiated, nonpolarized cells. In other cases, Caco-2 cells have been cultured for 7 to 10 days, and even though they formed a confluent cell monolayer, the cells were in fact at an early state of cell differentiation in which the brush border was not well formed and the cells had not achieved functional differentiation. We therefore start this review by summarizing the structural and functional characteristics of human colon cancer cell lines that when cultured properly express the structural and functional characteristics of fully differentiated polarized epithelial cells lining the small intestine.\n\nDifferentiated Enterocyte-Like HT-29 Cell Subpopulations and Clones\n\nIn 1972, J. Fogh (Sloan Kettering Institute for Cancer Research, Rye, NY) (33, 34) isolated and cultured cells from human colonic adenocarcinomas. The parental colon cancer HT-29 cell line (33, 35) is composed mainly of undifferentiated cells, with a small minority of differentiated cells (∼3 to 5% of total cells) ( ). Depending on the metabolic stresses exerted, such as glucose deprivation or its replacement by different substrates or culture in the presence of drugs, after an initial phase during which nearly all the undifferentiated cells die, the surviving cells that have resisted the stress consist of the small number of differentiated cells that were present at low levels in the parental HT-29 cell line. Several subpopulations of absorptive HT-29 cell subpopulations have been established ( ). The first enterocyte-like subpopulation of HT-29 cells, designated HT-29 Gal+, was obtained by a selection culture process in which galactose replaces glucose in the culture medium (36). A second enterocyte-like subpopulation of HT-29 cells, designated HT-29 Glc− cells, was established from the parental HT-29 cell line by glucose deprivation during culture (37). The enterocyte-like subpopulation designated HT-29 Rev Glc−/+, which maintains the differentiation characteristics permanently at subconfluence, was established after switching HT-29 Rev Glc− cells back into a standard glucose-containing medium (38) ( ). Other enterocyte-like cell subpopulations, designated HT-29-D4 (39), HT29.74 (40), and HT-29-18-C1 (41), have also been established. From the parental HT-29 cell line, two permanently differentiated clonal cell lines composed of absorptive cells have been established and designated HT-29.19E, obtained after sodium butyrate treatment (42), and HT29 clone 13, obtained after adenosine deprivation using adenosine deaminase (43). All the enterocyte-like HT-29 cell subpopulations or cell clones expressed a well-ordered apical brush border expressing human functional proteins found in the enterocytes of the human small intestine, a tight junctional domain, and a basal domain (31) ( ). Polarized HT-29 cell subpopulations and clones have been used to investigate cell polarization (44) and expression of several differentiation-associated intestinal functional proteins, including SI, APN, DPP IV, and AP (36–38, 42), carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) (45), ATPase activities (46), chloride secretion (47, 48), oligopeptide transport (49), Na+/glucose cotransport (50), PAR2 (51), receptor for VIP (52, 53), and AMPs (54) ( ). They also exhibit a controlled production or cellular effects of cytokines such as interleukin-4 (IL-4) and IL-13 (55), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) (56), IL-1 (57), and IL-8 (58). In contrast to the Caco-2 and T84 cell lines, these permanently fully differentiated, fluid-transporting HT-29 subpopulations have rarely been used to study the pathogenicity mechanisms of enteric bacteria.\n\nTable 1\n\nCell line, subpopulation, or cloneReference(s)Cell characteristicsExpressed intestinal functionsHT-29 Gal+ and HT-29 Glc−36Enterocyte-like cells forming in culture monolayers of polarized cellsExpression of a well-ordered brush border endowed by hydrolases such as SI, APN, DPP IV, and AP (36, 37)HT-29 Rev Glc−/+38Enterocyte-like cells forming in culture monolayers of polarized cellsbExpression of a well-ordered brush border endowed by hydrolases such as SI, APN, DPP IV, and AP (38, 42), ATPase activities (46), CEA (45), chloride secretion (47, 48), oligopeptide transport (49), Na+/glucose cotransport (50); presence of mature junctional complexes (39); receptor for VIP (52, 53) and PAR2 (51); Presence of AMPs (54)HT-29-D4, HT-29-D939HT29.7440HT-29-18-C141Clone HT-29.19E42HT29 clone 1343Clone HT-29.cl16E42Homogeneous subpopulations of goblet cells forming in culture monolayers of polarized cells producing mucins and secreting mucusbExpression of brush border endowed by hydrolases such as SI, APN, and DPP IV (38); presence of MUC2, MUC5AC, and MUC6 secreted mucins and MUC1, MUC3, and MUC4 membrane-associated mucins (62–68); presence of intracellular vesicles containing mucus; presence of two secretory pathways of mucins, a constitutive pathway and a cell signaling-regulated pathway (27)HT29-18N2 clone41, 60HT29-MTX38HT29-SB59HT29-FU61Mixed population of enterocyte-like cells (90%) and randomly distributed, mucin-secreting cells (10%)bExpression of brush border endowed by hydrolases such as SI and DPP IV (61); presence of MUC2 and MUC5AC secreted mucins and MUC4 membrane-associated mucin (61); presence of AMPs (54)Caco-282Spontaneously differentiate in culture in enterocyte-like cells forming monolayers of polarized cellscExpression of brush border endowed by functional proteins such as SI, lactase, AP, APN, and DPP IV (69, 108), SGLT1, GLUT1, GLUT2, GLUT3, and GLUT5 (123), hPEPT1 (126), H+-coupled dipeptide transporter (127), NHEs (128, 129), DRA (130), MCT1 (131), Na+-K+-ATPase (110), diamine oxidase (138), cholesteryl ester transfer protein (132), PAR2 (51), AQP3 and AQP10 (133–137), and receptors, including the epidermal growth factor receptor (139), the insulin-like, growth factor-binding proteins (IGF-BP-2, IGF-BP-3, and IGF-BP-4) (139), VIP receptor (52), and PPAR gamma (140); mechanisms of sorting and surface delivery of apical and basolateral functional proteins (103, 104); in-and-out efflux systems controlling the intestinal transport of drugs (141); positive TER in cell monolayers and expression of TJ proteins ZO-1, -2, and -3, occludin, and claudins claudin-1, -2, -3, -4, -12 but not claudin-5; formation of fluid-filled, blister-like domes resulting from both the paracellular and transcellular pathways of ion and water transport and which determine the net apical to basolateral vectorially transported water (142); presence of AMPs (54, 143)Clones Caco-2BBe 1 and 286Spontaneously differentiate in culture in enterocyte-like cells forming monolayers of polarized cellscClone 4083Clones Caco-2/1 to 1684Clone cl188Clone Caco-2/AQ89Clone NGI390Clones 1, 20, and 219126 clones from late or early passages, including Caco-2/TC794Caco/B792Clones NCL-1 to -1293T84153Spontaneously differentiate in culture in polarized colonic cellsdExpression of brush border endowed by hydrolases such as SI, DPP IV, and CEACAMs; regulated chloride secretion (157), NHE-1, -2, and -4 (158), Na+/K+/2Cl− transport (159), chloride and HCO3− secretion (160), ENT1 and ENT2 (161), the CFTR chloride channel (162, 163), and production of exosomes (164); High level of positive TER, resulting in tightly formed and highly regulated functional TJs expressing ZO-1, occludin, and claudins (156); PMNL transmigration\n\nDifferentiated Mucin-Secreting HT-29 Cell Subpopulations and Clones\n\nDepending on the culture selection system used, several mucus-secreting HT-29 subpopulations have been selected and mucus-secreting HT-29 cell clones have been established from the parental HT-29 cell line. The first permanently differentiated clonal cell line, HT-29.cl16E, was a homogeneous, mucin-secreting, intestinal cell population that emerged from the parental HT-29 cell line after sodium butyrate treatment (42). A second mucus-secreting, clonal derivative (HT29-SB) has also been established (59). Growing the parental HT-29 cell line in the absence of glucose results in the selection of homogeneous columnar cells with the typical goblet cell morphology, which have been designated the HT29-18N2 clone (41, 60). Adaptation of the parental HT-29 cell line to lethal concentrations of methotrexate (MTX) (38) and 5-fluorouracil (FU) (61) has been shown to result in the emergence of subpopulations of cells that are all stably committed to differentiation (38, 61). The HT29-MTX cell subpopulation is a homogeneous subpopulation of goblet cells that secretes the mucus and mucins of gastric and colonic immunoreactivity ( to ). In contrast, the cells in the HT29-FU cell subpopulation are all differentiated and exhibit 2 phenotypes: most are enterocyte-like cells, with a few randomly distributed mucin-secreting cells (61) ( and ). Both secreted and membrane-bound intestinal mucins have been characterized in HT29-MTX and HT29-FU cell subpopulations, since MUC2 and MUC4 were highly expressed in HT29-FU and MUC3 and MUC5AC were highly expressed in HT29-MTX (62–68). The mucin-secreting HT-29 cell clones and subpopulations have been used to investigate the regulation of mucus transport (69–78) and the functionality of human intestinal mucin-secreting cells (26, 27). Moreover, mucin-secreting HT-29 cell subpopulations and clones have been used to investigate the role of human mucins in bacterial pathogenesis (62, 63, 79–81). Enterocytic cells in fully differentiated HT29-FU cells expressed AMPs PR-39 and cecropin P1 (54).\n\nIn some pathogenic or commensal intestinal microbiota bacteria and parasites, the mucus gel can serve at least two functions. First, it can be a source of nutrients for bacterial growth, thus increasing the colonization of the intestine by the adhering bacteria, which have the ability to survive and multiply in the outer areas of the mucus layer. Second, the mucus coat overlying the microvillous surface contributes to the host defenses by preventing bacterial or parasite adhesion or invasion and the binding of toxins to the intestinal brush border.\n\nDifferentiated Enterocyte-Like Parental Caco-2 Cell Line and Clones\n\nThe parental colon cancer Caco-2 cells were established from passage 14 of the cell line obtained from J. Fogh (33, 34). The cells differentiate spontaneously in culture, characterized by the appearance of structural and functional properties of the enterocytes of the small intestine (35, 82) ( ). Several clones of Caco-2 cells have been established: clone 40 (83), clones Caco-2/1 to Caco-2/16 (84), clones Caco-2BBe 1 and 2 (also referenced as C2BBe 1 and 2) (85–87), clone cl1 (88), clone Caco-2/AQ (89), clone NGI3 (90), clones 1, 20, and 21 (91), Caco/B7 (92), and clones NCL1 to -12 (93). Moreover, 26 Caco-2 clones have been isolated from early and late passages of parental Caco-2 cells, 8 clones from passage 29 and 18 clones from passage 198, including the most commonly used Caco-2/TC7 clone (94). Importantly, it should be noted that the fully differentiated Caco-2 cells and Caco-2 clones, although they are of colonic origin, express apical and basolateral proteins and display the specific functions of the mature enterocytes of the small intestine (31). In culture, the fully differentiated parental Caco-2 cell line and its clones form a cell monolayer that mimics the intestinal epithelial barrier ( ). The differentiation process in the culture of Caco-2 cells is growth related; exponentially dividing cells are undifferentiated, and differentiation starts at confluence when the cells stop dividing ( ) and closely mimics the differentiation of enterocytes that occurs along the crypt-villus axis of the small intestine.\n\nParental Caco-2 cells and clones provide the best model for investigating the cell polarization that develops after confluence in culture and the roles of structural proteins, such as actin, fodrin, fimbrin, villin, myosin I and II, and plastin-1, in the structural and functional brush border assembly ( to ) (85–87, 95, 96). For intestinal epithelial cell polarity to develop, there is a complex sorting and cargo-trafficking machinery that carries out the intracellular transport of some functional proteins so that they can be directly and efficiently targeted to the basolateral membrane, whereas the apical functional proteins reach the apical microvillous membrane by several different routes (97). Some proteins are directly targeted to the apical microvillous membrane, whereas others are addressed to the microvillous membrane after a transitional stage in the lateral domain. In addition, a subapical cell compartment seems to function as a docking platform for vesicles containing functional proteins (98). Parental Caco-2 cells and clones have also been used to identify the mechanisms underlying the sorting and surface delivery of apical and basolateral proteins in human enterocytes (99–107) and to find out how functional intestinal proteins take their place in cell membrane domains, including brush border-associated functional proteins such as SI (82, 84, 86, 90, 94, 100, 106, 108–114), AP (110, 111), lactase-phlorizin hydrolase (108, 115), maltase-glucoamylase (108), APN (90, 108, 111), DPP IV (82, 90, 100, 108, 116–121), angiotensin I-converting enzyme (108), α-glucosidase (122), p-aminobenzoic acid peptide hydrolase (108), SGLT1, GLUT1, GLUT2, GLUT3, and GLUT5 (123–125), PEPT1 (126), H+-coupled dipeptide transporter (127), NHEs (128, 129), Cl/HCO3 exchanger DRA (130), monocarboxylate transporter 1 (MCT1) (131), cholesteryl ester transfer protein (132), AQP3 and AQP10 (133–137), Na+-K+ATPase (110), and diamine oxidase (117, 138) ( ) ( to ). Parental cells and clones have been also used to study the regulatory functions of membrane-bound receptors, including EGF receptor (139), IGF-BP-2, IGF-BP-3, and IGF-BP-4 (139), VIP receptor (52), PAR2 (51), and PPAR gamma (140). Moreover, Caco-2 cells and clones have been used to investigate the in-and-out efflux systems controlling the intestinal transport of drugs (141).\n\nParental Caco-2 cells and clones forming a monolayer at the fully differentiated state expressed a well-organized and regulated cell-to-cell junctional domain including TJs formed by ZO-1, -2, and -3, occludin, and claudin-1, -2, -3, -4, -12, but not claudin-5 ( , , and ). In addition, the fully differentiated Caco-2 cell monolayer forms fluid-filled, blister-like domes that are highly dynamic structures formed as the result of both the paracellular and transcellular pathways of ion and water transport and which determine the net apical-to-basolateral vectorially transported water (142) ( and ). Consistent with the production of AMPs by enterocytes (8, 9), parental fully differentiated Caco-2 cells express human cathelicidin LL-37/human cationic antimicrobial protein 18 (LL-37/hCAP18) mRNA and protein and showed positive immunoreactivity for lysozyme, α1-antitrypsin, and AMPs PR-39 and cecropin P1, whereas fully differentiated T84 cells do not (54, 143). The parental fully differentiated Caco-2 cell line and clones have been extensively used to investigate the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which human enterovirulent bacteria and enteric viruses create structural and functional cellular lesions and trigger cellular immune responses in the intestinal barrier. Moreover, fully differentiated Caco-2 cells and their clones have been used to investigate how bacterial species in the human intestinal microbiota control the pathogenesis of human enteropathogens.\n\nParental Caco-2 cells are known to be a homogeneous enterocyte-like cell line, but surprisingly, several reports have documented the presence of MUC genes and MUC proteins, including the MUC1F gene (144) and MUC1 mucin (145–148), the MUC2 gene (145), the MUC3A and MUC3B genes (145, 149), the MUC4 gene (150) and MUC4 mucin (151), and the MUC5B gene (152) and MUC5B mucin (148). Interestingly, the fully differentiated NCL2 clone recently isolated from the parental Caco-2 cell line shows the homogeneous presence of cells apically secreting a glycocalyx-like or mucin-like material (93).\n\nDifferentiated Colon Crypt T84 Cell Line\n\nThe T84 cell line is composed of colonic epithelial cells derived from a human colonic carcinoma (153). The cells were grown to confluence as a monolayer attached to the surface of the culture dish or permeable supports. These cells were highly polarized ( ), with short microvilli on the apical membrane facing the medium ( and ), a basolateral membrane, and TJs and desmosomes between adjacent cells ( ). Fully differentiated cells expressed human functional intestinal proteins at the brush border ( ) and structural and functional proteins regulating paracellular passage at the TJs ( ) ( ). Mounted in Ussing chambers, this cell line provides an excellent model system for studying electrolyte transport processes and the functions of voltage-dependent channels by electrical circuit analysis and membrane-associated vectorial cell transport systems (154–156). Fully differentiated T84 cells have been used to investigate the regulation of chloride secretion (157), NHE-1, -3, and -4 (158), Na+/K+/2Cl− transport (159), chloride and HCO3− secretion (160), Na+-independent equilibrating nucleoside transporters ENT1 and ENT2 (161), the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) chloride channel (162, 163), and production of exosomes (164). Since they express a high level of transepithelial electrical resistance (TER) (154–156), T84 cells provide the best model to investigate the impact of enterovirulent bacterial pathogens and enteric viruses and bacterial toxins on the structural organization of TJs and the transport functions of human colonic cells. The T84 cell line offers the best model for investigating how enterovirulent pathogens induce the transmigration of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNLs) across the intestinal barrier and the resulting cellular consequences (165, 166). The regulation of the PMNL transmigration across T84 cell monolayer has been described in detail (167–178). Moreover, several studies have analyzed the consequences of the transmigration of PMNLs for the polarized cells (179–182) and the changes seen in the PMNLs themselves (183–187).\n\nThe presence of the MUC1, MUC2, MUC3, and MUC5AC genes (188–192) and the regulation of MUC gene expression and the production or secretion of mucins in T84 cells (190–198) have been described. It is noteworthy that unlike the case for the HT-29 and Caco-2 cell lines, no clone or subpopulation has so far been established from the parental T84 cell line.\n\nParental Nondifferentiated Ileocecal Adenocarcinoma HCT-8 Cell Line and Subpopulations of Partially Differentiated HCT-8 and Fully Differentiated HCT8-MTX Cells\n\nThe parental human ileocecal adenocarcinoma HCT-8 cell line (199) and variants (HCT-8, HCT-8R, HCT-8 Nu 1, HCT-8R Nu 1, HCT-8 Nu 2, and HCT-8R Nu 2) (200) express the CEA as fully differentiated HT-29 cell subpopulations and clones and as parental fully differentiated Caco-2 cells. Parental HCT-8 cells cultured at postconfluence (in Eagle's minimal essential medium supplemented with 2 mM glutamine and 10% fecal calf serum or in Dulbecco modified Eagle's medium [DMEM] [25 mM glucose] supplemented with 10% inactivated fetal calf serum and cultured at 37°C in a 10% CO2–90% air atmosphere for 21 days in culture with culture medium changed daily) form a heterogeneous layer with large clusters of piled-up, flat cells and rounded cells alternating with small areas of more spread-out cells in which the cells are attached to each other by poorly organized junctional complexes ( to ) (201). Most of the cells were not differentiated, since villin and DPP IV were found at levels corresponding to unpolarized membrane expression, but a small proportion of the isolated cells or of the cells in clusters exhibited poorly organized cell extensions. Moreover, it has been found that ZO-1 is distributed scantly and anarchically in these HCT-8 cells organized in clusters. When cultured on permeable matrices and at late postconfluence stages, parental nondifferentiated HCT-8 cell layers displayed a low TER (202, 203). HCT-8 variants, such as HCT-8R cells, appeared to be entirely pleomorphic, and colonies contained fusiform, epithelial-like cells without junctional complexes and microvilli that appeared to be irregular in length, shape, and spacing. Parental HCT-8 cells have been grown in microgravity using a rotating-wall vessel (RWV) apparatus (204). After 10 days in culture, layered HCT-8 cell aggregates (HCT-8 organoids) developed, showing a villus-like cell organization. Interestingly, the cells in the HCT-8 organoids displayed a shape characteristic of polarized cells, indicating greater cellular differentiation than conventionally grown HCT-8 cells. Moreover, the cells in the upper part of the HCT-8 organoids developed short and not well-organized microvilli, unlike those observed in enterocyte-like parental Caco-2 cells and clones and HT-29 subpopulations and clones but resembling those present in T84 cells. Consistent with the better polarization and the presence of sparse microvilli, the cells localizing in the upper part of HCT-8 organoids apically expressed villin and expressed the TJ-associated ZO-1 protein in a more organized fashion than the parental HCT-8 cells. Parental HCT-8 cells have been used mainly to investigate drug cytotoxicity, resistance to antitumor agents, and the deregulated functions in cancer cells. Despite the fact that parental HCT-8 cells do not display the structural and functional characteristics of enterocytes, they have been used to study the interactions of a small number of enterovirulent bacteria with human intestinal epithelial cells (205–216) and bacterial toxin effects (217–219).\n\nAn HCT-8 cell subpopulation (HCT8-MTX) has been obtained by culturing these cells in the presence of MTX (201). In contrast to parental nondifferentiated HCT-8 cells, HCT8-MTX cells formed a homogeneous cell monolayer of polarized cells expressing TJs, with short and ordered microvilli forming a brush border at the apical cell surface ( and ) and with a linear expression of villin, DPP IV, CEA and MUC1 corresponding to expression at a polarized membrane. Moreover, HCT8-MTX cells, like fully differentiated Caco-2 cells, formed a number of domes which are indicative of a cell monolayer with vectorial ion transport properties.\n\nCoculture Models\n\nPeyer's patches (PPs), also known as follicle-associated epithelium, are areas in the mammalian gut mucosa consisting of aggregated and isolated lymphoid follicles separated from the intestinal lumen by a single layer of columnar epithelial cells. In these randomly distributed and particular intestinal cell areas, a relatively small number of highly specialized epithelial cells, known as M (microfold or membranous) cells, have been identified (22, 220). The phenotype of human M cells has long remained elusive due to the difficulty of isolating these sparsely occurring intestinal cell areas. M cells play a central role in initiating mucosal immune responses by transporting intact foreign antigens and commensal bacteria into the underlying lymphoid tissue. In this way, the mucosal immune system encounters the virtually limitless variety of antigens that enter the body through the gut mucosa and reacts by mounting specific mucosal and systemic immune responses. M cells are also major adhesion and invasion sites for several invasive enteric pathogens (221). Moreover, after crossing the follicle-associated epithelium, the invading bacteria face phagocytic cells, including the macrophages that are present in the follicle dome. For several enteroinvasive pathogens, the outcome of infection depends on the capacity to survive in the presence of macrophages or within macrophages after phagocytosis and how these invasive species do this (222).\n\nA model of M-like cells has been obtained by coculturing freshly isolated BALB/c mouse PP lymphocytes with parental fully differentiated Caco-2 cells, triggering the phenotypic conversion of Caco-2 cells into cells that express the morphological and functional properties of M cells (223, 224). A more stable model of M-like cells has been obtained by coculturing fully differentiated parental Caco-2 cells (225) or Caco-2 cl1 clone cells (226) with the human Burkitt's lymphoma Raji B cell line. Another model has been constituted from fully differentiated Caco-2 cl1 clone cells cultured in the presence of freshly isolated human blood lymphocytes (227). The mechanism(s) by which the fully differentiated Caco-2 cells are converted into M cell-like cells has not yet been entirely elucidated. Caco-2 cl1 cells cocultured with mouse PP lymphocytes display much lower levels of SI in their apical membranes than their differentiated Caco-2cl1 counterparts (223); a process that could account for this has been proposed. The conversion of M cell-like cells may be due to the disruption of the brush border resulting from a mouse PP lymphocyte-triggered dedifferentiation process (226). Consistently with this, there was an ∼2-fold downregulation of the SI promoter in the M cell-like cells compared to Caco-2 cl1 cells, indicating that the lymphoepithelium-induced downregulation of the differentiation- and brush border-associated SI in converted M cell-like cells is the result of a lymphoepithelium-triggered dedifferentiation process of fully differentiated Caco-2 cl1 cells (226). The dedifferentiation of Caco-2 cl1 cells, converting them into M cell-like cells, probably results from a contact-dependent mechanism that occurs when mouse PP lymphocytes come into contact with fully differentiated Caco-2 cl1 cells, rather than as a result of the action of molecules secreted by mouse PP lymphocytes. Indeed, after coculture with mouse PP lymphocytes, all the fully differentiated Caco-2 cl1 cells were not converted into M cell-like cells, and only randomly distributed M cell-like cells were observed within the Caco-2 cl1 cell monolayer after coculture (223). These M cell-like models have been used to investigate the transport of M cell particles (225, 228–232) and the interaction with and entry into M cells of enteroinvasive pathogens such as Listeria monocytogenes, Yersinia enterocolitica, Salmonella spp., and enterovirulent Escherichia coli (221). It is noteworthy that a mouse model of M-like cells has been established by El Bahi et al. (226) from cultured mouse intestinal mICCl2 cells (233) cocultured with lymphocytes freshly isolated from BALB/c mouse PP. When grown on permeable filters, the m-ICcl2 cells form sealed, confluent monolayers of cuboid, polarized cells with TJs, develop dense, short apical microvilli, form fluid-transporting domes, conserve the main features of small intestine crypt cells (including the expression of cytokeratins, villin, APN, DPP IV, and glucoamylase), and retain crypt cell features (including intracellular sucrase isomaltase, the accumulation of alpha-l-fucose glycoconjugates, and expression of the polymeric immunoglobulin receptor and the CFTR) (233). m-ICcl2 cells have been used to identify the intracellular Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) (which recognizes lipopolysaccharide [LPS]) (234, 235), the migration of CD8+ intraepithelial lymphocytes isolated from CCR5-deficient mice infected with Toxoplasma gondii (236), and the receptor-mediated intestinal transcytosis of botulinum neurotoxin A (237, 238).\n\nThe enteric nervous system, i.e., enteric neurons and enteric glial cells, is a potent modulator of intestinal epithelial barrier function, which has given rise to the novel concept of a digestive “neuronal-glial-epithelial unit” (30). Two coculture models consisting of human submucosa have been described, which contain the submucosal neuronal network cocultured with human fully differentiated mucus-secreting HT29-Cl.16E or enterocyte-like Caco-2 monolayers. These models have been used to investigate the effects of submucosal neuron activation by electrical field stimulation on cell proliferation (239), on the VIPergic neuronal pathway controlling the paracellular permeability and structural organization of TJs (70), and on the protein kinase A (PKA)-independent and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-dependent production of IL-8 (240).\n\nChoice of Cells and Technical Considerations\n\nSome considerations must be taken into account when choosing between human colon cancer fully differentiated Caco-2 cells, HT-29 subpopulations, or HT-29 or Caco-2 clone cells as intestinal models for the study of the mechanisms of pathogenesis of enterovirulent bacteria. It is clear that the different human colon cancer cell lines, subpopulations, or clones are not equivalent. For example, the growth rate (94), TER values (93), glucose consumption (94), expression of SI (94) and hexose transporters (123) at the brush border, expression of NHE antiporters at the brush border or basal domain (129, 241, 242), and sucrose activity values (94) all differ considerably in fully differentiated Caco-2 clone cells (243). Analysis of the literature shows that the enterocyte-like models most often used to investigate the molecular and cellular mechanisms of microbial pathogenesis are parental Caco-2 cells (82), Caco-2BBe 1 (86), cl1 (88), and Caco-/TC7 (94) clones, and the HT-29 Rev Glc−/+ subpopulation (38). The most frequently used mucus-secreting cell models are the HT29-MTX subpopulation (38) and the HT-29.cl16E clone (42).\n\nSome important technical considerations also have to be taken into account for the appropriate culture of human colon cancer cell lines, subpopulations, or clone cells. Some of the cells that have been transferred between laboratories have been contaminated with mycoplasmas, which affects their functional differentiation. They may, unfortunately, even have been contaminated with human cervical carcinoma epithelial HeLa cells, which makes them unsuitable for use in any studies at all. It is therefore important to obtain cell lines, subpopulations, or clone cells from culture collections or from expert laboratories that can validate that the transmitted cells comply with specifications. The most complete cell polarization and fully functional differentiation have been obtained by culturing the cells on polycarbonate filters. However, the high cost of this culture system has restricted its use to experiments involving TER and transcellular or paracellular passage measurements. In general, cells are cultured in polystyrene tissue culture plates. The cell density during growth can influence the morphological and physiological properties of the fully differentiated cells (243–245). Indeed, some reports describe using protocols in which the culture plates are inoculated with cells at high density after trypsinization. This shortens the culture time as the cells reach confluence quickly, but this is achieved at the cost of good functional differentiation. It is therefore important to carry out regular checks of the polarized organization of the cells by indirect immunofluorescence labeling of SI coupled with a confocal laser scanning microscopy examination and determination of the activity of brush border-associated hydrolases (243, 246). The passage number also influences the morphological and functional differentiation of the cells (243, 247–249). The culture medium used also influences the growth and the functional differentiation of the cells. Indeed, some human colon cancer cells lines, subpopulation, and clones can form multilayers in culture in which only the top layer of cells are fully differentiated (243, 247, 248). This phenomenon has been observed particularly for parental Caco-2 cells when the fetal bovine serum used contains high levels of cyclic AMP (cAMP), and the result is that cell proliferation seems to be preponderant relative to cell differentiation (A. L. Servin, unpublished data). A similar effect has been observed with Caco-2BBe 1 clone cells cultured in culture medium supplemented with glutamine (250, 251). It is therefore necessary to select an appropriate fetal bovine serum that will result in the culture of a cell monolayer composed entirely of structurally and functionally fully differentiated cells (243, 252). These considerations highlight the need to be attentive to the details of the culture conditions described in primary reports.\n\nMECHANISMS OF PATHOGENESIS OF HUMAN ENTEROVIRULENT BACTERIA\n\nEnterovirulent bacteria colonize various sites in the human intestine. Vibrio cholerae, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi, enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC), enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC), and diffusely adherent E. coli (DAEC) preferentially affect the small intestine, whereas Shigella spp., Campylobacter spp., enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC), and enteroinvasive E. coli (EIEC) infect the colon and Yersinia spp., enteroaggregative E. coli (EAEC), and Salmonella spp. affect both the small and large bowels. By use of adhesive factors and virulence factors, including bacterial effector proteins, expressed specifically by each pathogen and acting individually or in synergy, enterovirulent bacteria use sophisticated strategies to manipulate the host cell differently ( ).\n\nA critical step in intestinal bacterial pathogenesis is the ability of enterovirulent bacterial pathogens to interact efficiently with the different cell phenotypes lining the host intestinal barrier. In order to interact with the polarized host epithelial cells that line the intestinal barrier, many bacterial species move within the luminal intestinal compartment by rotating their flagella (253, 254). The molecular mechanism by which the flagellum is assembled involves the regulation of flagellar gene transcription, as well as translational and posttranslational regulation events. For example, the biogenesis of the flagellum in S. enterica serovar Typhimurium develops by the coordinated structural assembly of the flagellar proteins that form the flagellar propeller (255–257), and MotA and MotB are cytoplasmic membrane proteins that form the force-generating unit of the flagellar motor (256, 258). The flagella of enterovirulent bacteria have been shown to be necessary for colonizing the intestine, crossing the intestinal mucus layer and then attaching to epithelial cells, and promoting early innate host responses. Human enterovirulent bacteria display huge genetic diversity, and have evolved a wide repertoire of virulence and colonization factors that facilitate host-pathogen interactions with the apical domain of the fully differentiated polarized epithelial cells and M cells that line the intestinal epithelial barrier (259–265). Moreover, human intestinal bacterial pathogens are equipped with a variety of weapons that provide them with a variety of mechanisms for subverting the cellular machinery and circumventing host defenses.\n\nGram-negative bacteria have developed a variety of solutions for secreting proteins from the cytoplasmic compartment outside the bacterial cell (265–267). Six major protein secretion pathways, numbered I to VI, have been characterized for Gram-negative bacteria (268). The type I secretion system consists of an ATP-binding cassette transporter or a proton antiporter, an adaptor protein that bridges the inner membrane and outer membrane, and an outer membrane pore facilitating the passage of proteins, including cytotoxins belonging to the RTX (repeats-in-toxin) protein family, proteases, lipases, microcins, and colicins, across the cell envelope of Gram-negative bacteria (269, 270). The type II secretion system is a macromolecular, multicomponent structure that translocates a precursor effector protein through the inner membrane by the Sec translocon or the Tat pathway within the periplasm, after which the effector protein is translocated through the outer membrane (271, 272). The type III secretion system (T3SS), composed of more than 20 different proteins which form a large supramolecular structure crossing the bacterial cell envelope, includes the bacterial flagellum and the virulence-associated injectisome, which are two complex, structurally related nanomachines that enterovirulent bacteria use for locomotion and for the translocation of virulence factors into eukaryotic host cells, respectively (273–276). The type IV secretion system is a translocation pore involving the coordinate assembly of core complex proteins, including VirB3 to VirB10, which assembles with VirD4 for substrate recruitment and which, after activation, secretes the substrate (277–279). In addition, by association of the core complex proteins with the VirB11 protein, a pilus formed of VirB2 and VirB5 proteins assembles. The type V secretion system forms a pore in the outer membrane through which the passenger domain passes to the cell surface (280, 281). The newly identified type VI secretion system is a complex bacterial export pathway composed of at least two complexes, a dynamic bacteriophage-like structure and a cell envelope-spanning membrane-associated assembly (282, 283). Like the type III and IV secretion systems, the type VI secretion system translocates substrates directly into recipient cells in a contact-dependent manner.\n\nEnterovirulent noninvasive EPEC and EHEC and enteroinvasive Yersinia, Shigella, and Salmonella use T3SS injectisomes for the infection of host intestinal epithelial cells ( ). Injectisomes are macromolecular infection machineries consisting of structural and nonstructural proteins which form a basal body anchored in bacterial membranes, an external needle that protrudes from the bacterial surface, and a tip complex that caps the needle, functioning as a bacterial syringe through which bacterial effector proteins are delivered into the cytoplasm of target host cells (284–287). It has recently been revealed that Shigella and Salmonella injectisome subunit proteins adopt a conserved structure and orientation in their assembled state (288). The analysis of the molecular and cellular mechanisms of virulence of enterovirulent bacteria has shown the great sophistication of the T3SS-associated bacterial effectors. As the result of the piracy of host cell machinery, some enterovirulent bacteria increase the targeting and biochemical activities of their bacterial effectors (289). For example, some bacterial effectors are modified by the attachment of a variety of lipid groups by S-palmitoylation or N-myristoylation and prenylation, thus facilitating their interaction with the host cell membrane or with membrane lipid raft microdomains. Others modifications allow the optimal targeting of bacterial effectors within the host cell mitochondria or nucleus (289). Following delivery into the host cytoplasm, the bacterial effectors of Shigella (290–293), Salmonella (291, 293–298), and Listeria (293, 299–301) initiate and maintain infection by manipulating host cell biology, such as cytoskeletal dynamics, cell signaling, membrane trafficking, protein ubiquitylation, transcription, and cell cycle progression, and by reprogramming of host cells and circumvention of host defense mechanisms. For EPEC and EHEC pathogenesis, the T3SS injectisome produces an attaching and effacing (A/E) lesion at the microvilli of the brush border. These bacteria bind intimately at the brush border membrane of fully differentiated intestinal epithelial cells, which leads to a localized effacement of absorptive microvilli and the accumulation of host cytoskeletal proteins just beneath the attached bacteria, thus forming the “pedestal” structure of the cell membrane. The capacity for A/E lesion formation is encoded mainly on the locus of enterocyte effacement (LEE) pathogenicity island, the core of which harbors the genes for the T3SS regulators, chaperones, and effector proteins that subvert the host cell cytoskeletal and signaling machinery (302–305). On the other hand, some enterovirulent bacteria produce toxins that, after endocytosis, target the host epithelial cell actin cytoskeleton or microtubule network, impairing the polarized cell sorting of functional proteins, affecting the polarized cell organization, or altering the junctional domain organization (287, 304, 306). Other toxins produce their cytotoxic activity by inducing generally apoptotic death (307). Moreover, enterotoxigenic bacteria deliver cytotonic toxins that after receptor-binding- and endocytosis-activated cell signaling pathways regulating the functionality of membrane-associated proteins supporting specific intestinal functions of absorption/secretion (308, 309) ( ). Investigation of the pathogenic molecular and cellular mechanisms of enterovirulent bacteria using cultured, fully differentiated human colon cancer cell lines, subpopulations, and clone cells has provided detailed models of their molecular manipulation of host cell biology.\n\nCell Interaction, Cell Entry, and Intracellular Lifestyle\n\nEnterovirulent bacteria interact with intestinal epithelial cells that form the intestinal barrier via adhesive molecules expressed on their surfaces ( ). The biogenesis and regulation of bacterial adhesins in both intestinal and extraintestinal bacterial pathogens have been studied in detail (259–265). Attachment to host intestinal cells is a way of avoiding being dislodged by mucosal secretions and peristalsis, and enterovirulent bacteria produce a wide variety of adhesive structures or factors, including, for example, nonfimbrial and fimbrial polymeric structures that extend out from the bacterial surface and allow them to interact at a distance from the cells. These adhesive factors allow a close association to develop between enterovirulent bacteria and host cell membrane-bound molecules expressing an extracellular domain. The bacterial adhesion to the brush border of enterocytes is much more than just simple attachment. In the case of ETEC, it allows the optimal delivery of cytotonic toxins in the vicinity of their membrane-associated receptors, which is followed by signaling events that affect electrolytes and fluid secretion. Close adhesion allows both EPEC and EHEC to insert the translocated intimin receptor into the host cell membrane, triggering the recruitment of actin immediately underneath the attached bacterium to form the pedestal structures that create and maintain the intimate attachment of the bacterium, resulting in characteristic A/E lesions on the brush border and in dramatically impaired absorption/secretion functions. For Shigella and Salmonella, adhesion initiates an orderly series of bacterial effector-controlled molecular events within a defined area on the host cell membrane, which facilitate the formation of the dramatic actin-rich cell surface ruffles that are pivotal to the successful completion of bacterial invasion followed by the adoption of an intracellular lifestyle by the internalized bacteria.\n\nTable 2\n\nPathogenCell linePathogenicity island, virulence factor, or cellular proteinEffectReference(s)YersiniaCaco-2, T84InvCell entry blocked by polarization during cell differentiation313, 314M-like Caco-2UndeterminedEntry within M-like cells227, 824ShigellaCaco-2UndeterminedSpecific basolateral cell entry320Caco-2IpaRelease of Ipa proteins by bacteria interacting with the basolateral surface322Caco-2IpgB1, IpgB2Role in basolateral cell entry323Caco-2/TC7ConnexinsRole of Cx26, Cx32, and Cx43 in basolateral cell entry328ListeriaCaco-2UndeterminedDecrease of cell entry as a function of the polarization during cell differentiation337, 338, 339Caco-2ActARole in cell entry within epithelial cells340C2BBe 1InlC, TubaRole in bacterial spreading341CampylobacterCaco-2UndeterminedCell entry346Caco-2UndeterminedParacellular translocation347Caco-2FlaA, FlaB, MotRole of flagella and swimming motility for cell entry350, 351T84UndeterminedPI3K-dependent cell entry658Caco-2UndeterminedResiding within CD63-positive vacuoles356Caco-2LuxSRole in cell entry364T84FlaA, CadF, PldA, CiaB, CdtA, CdtB, CdtCRoles in cell entry352T84CapARole in adhesion and cell entry354Caco-2LOSRole in cell entry348HtrA, E-cadherinRole in cell entry357SalmonellaCaco-2, T84UndeterminedInteraction with apical microvilli and cell entry374–377, 389Caco-2FlagellaRole in association with brush border and cell entry382–384Caco-2SopA, SopB, SopD, SopE2Role in cell entry391Caco-2UndeterminedInternalized bacteria residing within membrane-bound vacuoles374, 377, 393T84SodC1, SodC2Role in intracellular survival394Caco-2MgtBC, PstACS, Iro, SPI-2Upregulation of genes for magnesium, phosphate, and iron uptake and SPI-2396Vibrio choleraeCaco-2UndeterminedAdhesion to microvilli408Caco-2OmpURole in cell association410Caco-2Type IV toxin-coregulated pilusRole in cell association411ETECCaco-2CFAsAdhesion to microvilli423Caco-2CSsAdhesion to microvilli422, 426–429, 431, 432Caco-2PCFsAdhesion to microvilli422, 424Caco-2AntigensAdhesion to microvilli423, 425Caco-2Type IV long pilusAdhesion to microvilli433Caco-2EtpA and EtpBAdhesion to microvilli434Caco-2, HT-29 Glc−CFAsCell differentiation-dependent adhesion of ETEC to microvilli435, 436AIECCaco-2UndeterminedAdhesion to microvilli and role of CEACAM6 as cell membrane receptor415, 456Caco-2, T84FimHIdentification of FimH mutations affecting adhesion457, 458Caco-2BB2, T84FlagellaRole in cell association and cell entry449T84OmpCRole in cell association and cell entry459Caco-2OMVsRole of chaperone Gp96 in cell recognition of OMVs460tEPECCaco-2UndeterminedFormation of typical tEPEC microcolonies464HT-29 Glc−/+, Caco-2, T84UndeterminedCell differentiation-dependent formation of typical tEPEC microcolonies467Caco-2Bundle-forming piliRole in formation of typical tEPEC microcolonies465, 466Caco-2UndeterminedRecruitment of cell surface nucleolin around the bacteria present in microcolonies609aEPECCaco-2UndeterminedLocalized adherence-like, DA and AA patterns of adhesion487, 488EHECCaco-2, T84UndeterminedDense and localized microcolonies at the brush border464, 492Caco-2LEERole in adhesion493–496Caco-2OmpA, long polar fimbriaeRole in adhesion497, 498Caco-2TirRole in adhesion496Caco-2YhiE, YhiF, ToxBRegulators for T3SS-dependent adhesion499, 500Caco-2Type 4 piliRole in adhesion501T84Hemorrhagic E. coli piliRole in adhesion and biofilm formation502, 503EAECCaco-2, T84EspP, EhxDRole in adhesion to brush border507, 644, 645T84AAF/I and AggRRole in adhesion to brush border508Caco-2, T84UndeterminedCell invasion509Afa/DrDAF/CEACAMs DAECCaco-2Afa-I, Dr, F1845Role in cell differentiation-dependent diffuse adhesion at the brush border533–535Caco-2/TC7Dr, F1845Role in hDAF and hCEA receptor clustering around bacteria adhering onto the brush border526Caco-2/TC7Dr, F1845, Afa-IIIIncreased lipid raft-dependent internalization after basolateral infection compared to apical infection536, 537Role in recruitment of β1-integrin around adhering bacteria and preceding cell entry538, 539aDAECCaco-2CF16K, CS31ARole in adhesion at the brush border432, 517\n\nYersinia.\n\nThe three Yersinia species that are human pathogens are Y. enterocolitica, Y. pseudotuberculosis, and Y. pestis. Y. enterocolitica and Y. pseudotuberculosis are Gram-negative, food- or waterborne enteropathogenic bacteria that share the same modes of transmission and typically cause self-limiting infections restricted to the intestinal tract and intestinal lymphoid system (310, 311). The core of the Yersinia pathogenicity arsenal is the Yop virulon, also known as the “Yop secretion system,” expressed by Y. pestis, Y. pseudotuberculosis, and Y. enterocolitica, which allows Yersinia to inject specialized proteins, known as Yop effectors, through the plasma membrane into the cell cytoplasm (285, 312).\n\nThe cell association and cell entry of Yersinia pseudotuberculosis expressing inv and/or ail loci as a function of intestinal cell differentiation has been investigated by Coconnier et al. (313) using parental undifferentiated and fully differentiated Caco-2 cells ( ). This phenomenon parallels the change in the cell distribution of α5β1 integrin, since integrin expression is high at the cell surface of proliferative undifferentiated cells, and the integrin is redistributed so as to localize at the cell-to-cell contacts when the cell reach confluence. Cell invasion occurs when the Caco-2 cells are undifferentiated and is arrested when differentiation commences. Similar differentiation-dependent internalization has been observed for Y. enterocolitica in T84 cells (314). In contrast, it has been reported that Y. enterocolitica O:8 WA interacts with and is internalized into fully differentiated Caco-2 cells (315, 316). Moreover, the entry of Y. pseudotuberculosis and Y. enterocolitica into nonphagocytic cells is mediated by the bacterial outer membrane protein (OMP) invasin, and the invasin-mediated uptake requires high-affinity binding of invasin to host cell membrane-associated multiple β1 chain integrin receptors (317, 318).\n\nShigella.\n\nShigella spp. are Gram-negative, enteroinvasive bacteria belonging to the Enterobacteriaceae family (290, 292, 319). The genus Shigella is divided into four species, S. boydii, S. dysenteriae, S. flexneri, and S. sonnei. The World Health Organization (WHO) considers that shigellosis is a significant public health burden in developing countries, with about 160 million cases occurring annually, predominantly in children under 5 years of age, possibly leading to one million deaths per year worldwide. Members of the genus Shigella cause bacillary dysentery in humans by invading the colonic epithelial mucosa, inducing a strong inflammatory response, and causing devastating diarrhea. After crossing the epithelium barrier and entering the M cells, Shigella bacteria are delivered to resident macrophages, within which they induce apoptosis, and thus reach the basal membrane of fully differentiated intestinal epithelial cells, through which they enter the cells (291). To enter a cell, Shigella bacteria use their T3SS needle, which is inserted into the cell membrane to allow the translocation of bacterial effector proteins into the host cell cytoplasm. Once inside the cell, the bacteria escape from the Shigella-containing vacuole into the cell cytoplasm, in which the bacteria move through an actin-based motility and spread to the neighboring cells via cellular membrane invaginations known as transpodia (293).\n\nMounier et al. (320), using fully differentiated Caco-2 cells, were the first to demonstrate that the invasion of human intestinal cells by S. flexneri occurs via the basolateral pole of these cells, whereas other bacteria interact with the apical surface without causing any detectable change in the microvilli ( ). After bile salt exposure, S. flexneri increases the expression of OMP-associated OspE1/OspE2 proteins and displays an increased capacity to adhere to the brush border of fully differentiated T84 cells (321). In fully differentiated Caco-2 cells, Ipa proteins are released from bacteria interacting with the basolateral surface rather than with the apical surface (322). Mutation of the genes encoding the T3SS effectors IpgB1, acting as a functional Rac mimic, and IpgB2, acting as a molecular mimic of Rho for the Shigella-induced formation of cell surface lamelliopodia, shows that the cell entry of S. flexneri mutants into fully differentiated Caco-2 cells is 70% lower than that of the wild-type strain (323). The S. flexneri O antigen, regulated by the WzzB protein, and a very long O antigen have been found to be involved in basolateral cell entry into fully differentiated Caco-2 cells (324). A role of cellular gap junctions in S. flexneri pathogenesis has been recently demonstrated. Gap junctions consist of arrays of intercellular channels composed of integral membrane proteins called connexin (Cx) (325). The type of Cx expressed in intestinal cells is still a matter of debate, and little is known about the role of hemichannels in intestinal epithelial cells. Cx26, Cx32, and Cx43 were present in fully differentiated T84 and Caco-2 cells (326–329). Functional data suggest that Cx26-mediated gap junctional intercellular communication plays a crucial role in enhancing the barrier function of TJs in fully differentiated Caco-2 cell monolayers (326). In fully differentiated Caco-2/TC7 cells, Ca2+ movements through opening of Cx hemichannels were detected upon S. flexneri invasion (328). Moreover, in partially differentiated Caco-2/TC7 cells, S. flexneri is captured at a distance from the cell surface on the apical side of the cell-to-cell domain by nanometer-thin micropodial extensions (330). This phenomenon is accompanied by F-actin condensation and cell entry via an extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (Erk1/2) MAPK-dependent process involving the T3SS tip complex proteins and stimulated by ATP- and Cx-mediated signaling.\n\nMovement of Shigella within the host cell cytoplasm requires F-actin polymerization, which allows Shigella to induce F-actin nucleation and elongation, thus gaining propulsive force. This bacterial movement causes the cell membranes of primarily infected polarized cells to protrude, forming transpodia allowing the penetration of the intracellular bacteria into neighboring cells and thereby allowing the bacteria to disseminate into adjacent cells. It is noteworthy that the roles of the S. flexneri virulence factors involved in intercellular spread of S. flexneri or cell-to-cell passage via transpodia have been investigated using plaque assay consisting of nonintestinal undifferentiated epithelial cells such as HeLa cells (331) or isolated Caco-2 cells or islets of undifferentiated Caco-2 cells (332, 333).\n\nListeria.\n\nListeria monocytogenes is a ubiquitous, Gram-positive bacterium that thrives in diverse environments such as soil, water, various food products, human beings, and animals (300, 301, 334). The disease caused by this bacterium, listeriosis, is acquired by ingesting contaminated food products and mainly affects immunocompromised individuals, pregnant women, and newborn infants. It is responsible for severe systemic infections with high mortality rates, including meningitis or meningoencephalitis, septicemia, diarrhea, miscarriages, and perinatal infections. After being ingested, this intracellular pathogen breaches the intestinal barrier. During severe infections it crosses the blood-brain barrier, resulting in infection of the meninges and the brain, and in pregnant women it crosses the fetoplacental barrier, leading to infection of the fetus. L. monocytogenes displays a battery of virulence factors, some of which functionally or structurally mimic host proteins to hijack host cellular processes (299, 301, 335, 336), and several different host cell signaling cascades during its intracellular life cycle (293).\n\nThe first report describing the interaction and cell entry of an enterovirulent bacterium with the cultured Caco-2 cells was made by Gaillard et al. (337) ( ). These authors used semiconfluent, mainly undifferentiated cell monolayers and reported that L. monocytogenes entered the cells and that the internalized bacteria resided inside vacuoles. These authors also observed that listeriolysin O (LLO) functions as a major factor allowing bacteria to escape from phagosomes and to multiply within the cell cytoplasm. Karunasagar et al. (338), using fully differentiated Caco-2 cells, reported that L. monocytogenes entered the cells through the apical surface without modifying the microvilli but as the result of forming lamellipodia that are involved in the cellular uptake of the bacteria. Gaillard and Finlay (339) have investigated the entry of L. monocytogenes into Caco-2 cells as a function of cell polarization and differentiation. L. monocytogenes entered through the entire surface of undifferentiated cells but predominantly through the basolateral surface of polarized cells, since the numbers of internalized bacteria decreased dramatically when the Caco-2 monolayers were cultured beyond confluence. Interestingly, by creating a disruption of intercellular junctions in Caco-2 monolayers that expose the lateral domain of the fully differentiated cells, an enhanced number of bacteria were internalized after apical infection. Loss of the actin-polymerizing protein ActA reduces the apical entry of L. monocytogenes into fully differentiated Caco-2 and MDCK epithelial cells (340). Scanning electron microscopy examination of infected, fully differentiated Caco-2 cells suggests that internalization involves microvilli that mediate bacterial uptake after being remodeled to form pseudopods. In contrast, ActA does not contribute to L. monocytogenes internalization by COS-1 fibroblasts or Hepa 1-6 hepatocytes, indicating that ActA can direct an internalization pathway specific to epithelial cells. It has been established in undifferentiated Caco-2 cells that InlA interacts with human E-cadherin to promote L. monocytogenes cell entry through a dynamic process involving coordinated actin cytoskeleton rearrangements and host cell membrane remodeling at the site of bacterial attachment. Bacterial and host proteins that directly regulate L. monocytogenes-induced protrusions have been identified using fully differentiated Caco-2BBe 1 clone cells, and this showed that the spread of the bacterium between polarized cells requires secreted protein InlC and cell adaptor protein Tuba (341). Indeed, Tuba functions as a ligand of InlC. InlC binds to a carboxy-terminal SH3 domain in Tuba that normally engages the human actin regulatory neural Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (N-WASP). Since Tuba and N-WASP are known to control the structure of apical junctions in epithelial cells, it has been proposed that InlC may promote protrusion formation by inhibiting Tuba and N-WASP activity, probably by impairing the binding of N-WASP to the Tuba SH3 domain. Experiments with myosin II inhibitors indicate that InlC-mediated disruption of apical junctions accounts for the role of this bacterial protein in protrusion formation.\n\nIt is noteworthy that as for Shigella, isolated undifferentiated Caco-2 cells, islets of undifferentiated Caco-2 cells, or undifferentiated Caco-2 cells at the early stage of confluence have been used to identify Listeria virulence factors involved in the intracellular lifestyle, including intracellular movements (342, 343).\n\nCampylobacter jejuni.\n\nCampylobacter spp. are microaerophilic, curved, Gram-negative rods exhibiting motility and are carried in the intestines of many wild and domestic animals, particularly avian species, including poultry (344). Campylobacter is recognized as the leading cause of bacterial food-borne diarrheal disease worldwide. Symptoms can range from mild to serious infections in children and the elderly to permanent neurological symptoms. Campylobacter spp. express a set of virulence factors, including flagella for swimming within the mucus and host-bacterium interactions, chemotaxis proteins, adhesive factors (including CadF, which recognizes fibronectin), Peb1, Cj1496c, JlpA (which activates NF-κB and p38), mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), lipoprotein CapA (implicated as a possible adhesin), the secreted protein CiaB (which is required for the invasion of epithelial cells), and cytolethal distending toxin (CDT), (345). Campylobacter spp. lack T3SS and invade intestinal epithelial cells, but the mechanisms that control cell entry are not fully understood. It is clear that cell entry involves a microtubule-dependent mechanism, since the pseudopods entrapping cell-associated bacteria contain microtubules. In addition, several Campylobacter strains also require microfilament polymerization for cell entry. Once internalized, C. jejuni localizes within vacuoles and moves along the microtubules to the perinuclear region of the cell. The role of these internalized bacteria in pathogenesis, possibly by evading the immune system and establishing a protected reservoir, remains to be determined.\n\nUsing fully differentiated Caco-2 cell monolayers grown on microporous membrane filters, Konkel et al. (346) were the first to observe that C. jejuni translocates across the cell monolayers by passing both through and between cells ( ). When infecting a T84 cell monolayer via the basal domain, C. jejuni translocation appears to occur via a paracellular route rather than a transcellular route (347). C. jejuni isolates expressing ganglioside-like lipooligosaccharide (LOS) are highly adhesive and penetrate into fully differentiated Caco-2 and T84 cells, in contrast to C. jejuni isolates that lack these structures (348). Cell association and invasion of Caco-2 cells are inhibited by various sugars, including d-glucose, d-mannose, d-fucose, and N-acetylneuraminic acid (349, 350), and intracellular C. jejuni is localized within membrane-bound vacuoles (350). Examination of the role of flagella and swimming motility in the interactions of C. jejuni with fully differentiated Caco-2 cells reveals that both the flagellated, nonmotile (flaA+ flaB+ mot) and nonflagellated, nonmotile (flaA flaB mot) mutants, unlike the wild-type strain, are unable to translocate across cell monolayers (350–352). Moreover, in the presence of intestinal mucus, C. jejuni displays straight swimming motility punctuated by tumbling (353). An autotransporter protein capA insertion mutant has a significantly lower capacity to associate with and invade fully differentiated Caco-2 cells (354). During C. jejuni translocation across fully differentiated Caco-2 cell monolayers, the absence of any change in TER and inulin paracellular passage indicates that the bacteria translocated through the cytoplasm of the cells invade, rather than via intercellular spaces (355). C. jejuni invading, via an actin- and microtubule-independent mechanism, fully differentiated Caco-2 cells localized in at the periphery of large islets of cells have been found residing within CD63-positive vacuoles, in which they are metabolically active (356). The serine protease HtrA of C. jejuni plays a role in promoting the basolateral invasion of fully differentiated Caco-2 by cleaving E-cadherin (357).\n\nQuorum sensing (QS) is a “language” by which bacteria and host cells communicate (358–360). Signaling factors produced by enterovirulent bacteria have the function to communicate both the cell density and the metabolic potential of the environment and also to regulate the expression their virulence factors (361–363). Consistent with the fact that the genome sequence of C. jejuni NCTC 11168 contains a gene encoding an orthologue of LuxS, which is required for QS autoinducer-2 (AI-2), a luxS mutant displays the same ability to invade fully differentiated Caco-2 cell monolayers as the parental strain, even though it exhibits decreased motility in semisolid media, suggesting that quorum sensing may play a role in the regulation of motility (364).\n\nWhen C. jejuni is grown in iron-limited medium in the presence of norepinephrine (NE), the motility of bacteria and their entry into fully differentiated Caco-2 cells are both increased (365). In addition, in the presence of NE, C. jejuni causes greater disruption of cultured epithelial cell monolayers than in the absence of NE. The roles of environmental stress factors, including temperature shift, nutrient starvation, and atmospheric oxygen concentration, in C. jejuni pathogenicity have been evaluated in fully differentiated Caco-2 cell monolayers (366–368). Nutrient insufficiency and temperature elevation both transiently affect bacterial growth and also affect the adhesion and invasive properties of C. jejuni. Oxidative stress does not affect either the binding or invasion of cells, whereas oxygen exposure or microaerobic conditions increase both the invasion capability and survival of intracellular C. jejuni.\n\nSalmonella spp.\n\nSalmonellae are Gram-negative bacteria that cause gastroenteritis and enteric fever (295). Salmonella serovars associated with gastroenteritis orchestrate a strong intestinal inflammatory response and cause deleterious structural and functional cell injuries that result in severe secretory disease. Salmonella bacteria share the ability to invade the host by inducing their own uptake, and they survive and multiply within the epithelial cells and M cells lining the intestinal epithelium (369). To do this, Salmonella virulence requires the coordinated expression of complex arrays of virulence factors (369, 370). The most important Salmonella virulence genes are those located within the five so-called Salmonella pathogenicity islands (SPIs) (369, 370). Salmonella cells attach to the enterocytes and M cells by means of adhesions, including those encoded within SPI-3 and SPI-4. Invasion of adhering Salmonella within the cells occurs by an F-actin-dependent process triggering a cell membrane engulfment mediated by virulence factors encoded within SPI-1 and SPI-5. Both T3SS-1 and T3SS-2 are composed of approximately 20 to 30 proteins, with a major subset of these proteins having a structural role in forming the supramolecular injection apparatus, known as the needle complex, which is composed of three distinct substructures: a multiring base, an inner rod, and a needle (286, 371). Another set of proteins forms the translocon, thus producing a pore in the host cell membrane allowing the delivery of bacterial effectors into the host cell cytoplasm (286, 294, 372). Moreover, both T3SS-1 and T3SS-2 are responsible for delivering a series of specific bacterial effectors into host cells, altering host cell organization, functions, and survival. When internalized, bacteria reside within the cell cytoplasm within large vesicles named Salmonella-containing vacuoles (SCVs), where they replicate. For the intracellular lifestyle, virulence factors dependent on SPI-2 and the plasmid pSLT (a cryptic plasmid present in S. Typhimurium strain LT2) are essential for survival (298, 373). The SCVs transcytose to the basolateral membrane and release the bacteria to the submucosa, in which they are internalized within resident phagocytes again within SCVs, where SPI-3 in addition to SPI-2 and the pSLT plasmid plays an important role. Lastly, the infected phagocytes can disseminate through the lymph and the bloodstream. Alternatively, bacteria can also be directly taken up by dendritic cells (DCs) from the submucosa (370). In addition, emerging evidence indicates that these effectors are also modular proteins consisting of distinct functional domains/motifs that are utilized by the bacterium to activate intracellular signaling pathways that modify host cell functions (370).\n\nThe first reports describing the interaction of S. Typhimurium with fully differentiated Caco-2 cells and the cellular consequences were from Finlay's group (374–377) ( ). Adhesion of Salmonella at the brush border of fully differentiated Caco-2 cells has been observed to involve the SPI4-dependent, very large nonfimbrial adhesin SiiE (378) and Std fimbriae (379). It has been suggested that a Galβ(1-3) GalNAc epitope located in the glycocalyx is involved in the early recognition events between S. Typhimurium and Caco-2 BBe clone cells (380). Moreover, SadA, a purported trimeric autotransporter adhesin of S. Typhimurium, appears to be involved in cell aggregation and biofilm formation, and it increases adhesion to fully differentiated Caco-2 (381). In addition, it has been observed that flagella of S. enterica serovar Enteritidis are involved in the association with and invasion of fully differentiated cells (382–384). Using three of the four classes of mutants that remain virulent in mice, Betts and Finlay (375) observed that S. Typhimurium invasiveness requires intact motility and at least six distinct genetic loci. CorA, the primary or “housekeeping” Mg2+ channel, appears to be involved in the expression of several S. Typhimurium virulence factors, since a corA mutant strain loses swimming motility and expresses lower levels of InvH and SipC, accompanied by a decreased ability to invade fully differentiated Caco-2 cells (385). Overexpression of matrix metalloproteinase 9, which regulates the production of MUC-2 mucin, increases S. Typhimurium adhesion to fully differentiated, mucin-secreting HT-29 cl.16E cells (386). Adherence of Std-fimbriated S. Typhimurium to fully differentiated Caco-2 cells is blocked by H type 2 oligosaccharide (Fucα1-2Galβ1-4GlcNAc) (387). In addition, sialic acid plays a role in the adhesion of S. enterica serovar Typhi to fully differentiated Caco-2 cells (388).\n\nFinlay and Falkow (377) reported for the first time that S. Typhimurium, after interacting with the well-organized apical microvilli of fully differentiated parental Caco-2 cells, induced a dramatic, localized reorganization of the F-actin cytoskeleton at the site of bacterial attachment known as membrane ruffling (377, 389). Following the disruption of the cell membrane, S. Typhimurium penetrated the cells and appeared in the basolateral medium of the fully differentiated Caco-2 cell monolayer. F-actin filament rearrangement and morphological changes at the apical domain of Caco-2 cells are essential for the entry of S. Typhimurium (374–377). The T3SS-1 effector SipA, which directly binds F actin, thus modulating actin dynamics and facilitating bacterial entry, has been found to be preferentially associated with peripheral cortical F-actin filaments but not with stress fibers in infected fully differentiated Caco-2 cells (390). The T3SS-1 effectors SopE2 and SopB are required for invasion, whereas the SipA protein accelerates entry into epithelial cells. A contribution of the T3SS-1 effectors SopA and SopD to the invasion of nonpolarized T84 cells by S. Typhimurium has been observed, whereas in contrast, SopA, SopB, SopD, and SopE2 all increase the invasiveness of an SipA-positive strain in polarized T84 cells (391). These observations in fully differentiated Caco-2 and T84 cells have been validated in a human intestinal in vitro organ culture system in which S. Typhimurium has been shown to interact with border-expressing cells and induce membrane ruffles (392).\n\nInternalized S. Typhimurium cells are enclosed in SCVs within the cytoplasm (374, 377). It has been noted that S. Typhi and S. Typhimurium use similar mechanisms to invade and carry out intracellular trafficking in Caco-2 cells (374, 393). The biogenesis of SCVs within mammalian cells has been intensively studied over recent years using various different polarized epithelial cells. The ability of S. enterica serovar Choleraesuis to survive within fully differentiated Caco-2 cells has been found to depend on sodC genes, with sodC2 being more important than sodC1 (394). Investigation of the role of T3SS-2 in cell entry, survival, and proliferation within the cells has revealed more efficient entry into fully differentiated Caco-2 and T84 cells than into HeLa cells (395). Moreover, although T3SS-dependent intracellular proliferation has been observed in HeLa cells, intracellular replication in fully differentiated cells was severely restricted and was not affected by SPI-2 deletion (395). Analysis of the transcriptome of S. Typhimurium in fully differentiated Caco-2 cells has been conducted and compared to Salmonella gene expression inside macrophages (396). Upregulation of the mgtBC, pstACS, and iro genes for magnesium, phosphate, and iron uptake and of the SPI-2 pathogenicity island has been observed. Moreover, the invasion-associated SPI-1 pathogenicity island, and the genes involved in flagellar biosynthesis were expressed inside epithelial cells at later stages of the infection, whereas they were constantly downregulated in macrophage-like cells. The ability of Salmonella to sense and adapt to the intracellular environment of different types of host cells has also received attention. S. Typhimurium replicating in the Salmonella-containing vacuole in undifferentiated Caco-2 cells utilized glucose but not glucose 6-phosphate or other phosphorylated carbohydrates, gluconate, or fatty acids as their major carbon substrate (397). Carbohydrate phosphotransferase systems were encoded by the genes ptsG/crr, manXYZ, fruBA, malX/crr, scrA/crr, and bglF, and glucose 6-phosphate was taken up by both pathogens via the UhpT transporter, which is under the control of a complex two-component system (uhpABC). S. Typhimurium mutants defective for the uptake of glucose and mannose (ΔptsG manXYZ) and glucose 6-phosphate (ΔuhpT) have less capability for intracellular replication in undifferentiated Caco-2 cells, and the ΔptsG manXYZ uhpT triple mutant is still able to replicate within the vacuoles (398).\n\nVibrio cholerae.\n\nThe facultative pathogen and Gram-negative bacterium Vibrio cholerae is the causative agent of cholera, which is responsible for significant mortality and economic damage (399–401). During its life cycle, V. cholerae has both a human stage and an environmental stage. V. cholerae is differentiated serologically on the basis of the O antigen of its lipopolysaccharide. The O1 serogroup has been subdivided into two phenotypically distinct biotypes: El Tor and classical. Cholera toxin (CT)-producing strains of the O1 and O139 serogroups cause the vast majority of cases of the disease worldwide. The major virulence factors of toxigenic V. cholerae are CT, which is encoded by a lysogenic filamentous bacteriophage (CTXPhi), and toxin-coregulated pilus (TCP), an essential colonization factor that is also the receptor for CTXPhi (402, 403). The type IV TCP acts as a receptor for CTXPhi, contributes to the secretion of the colonization factor TcpF, and contributes to microcolony formation by mediating bacterium-bacterium interactions. In addition to CT, V. cholerae produces other putative toxins, such as the zonula occludens toxin (Zot) (404) and accessory cholera enterotoxin (Ace) (405). The role of Zot in V. cholerae pathogenesis is a subject of debate (403). Rearrangements occurring in the water environment in virulent V. cholerae strains have been proposed as one of the mechanisms of formation of clones with an incomplete or no prophage. Interestingly, it has been shown that variability of the CTXPhi prophage genome is an important factor in the modification of V. cholerae virulence potential, determining the severity of the infection (406, 407).\n\nPanigrahi et al. (408) were the first to report the adhesion of non-O1 V. cholerae strain NRT36S to the microvilli of fully differentiated Caco-2 cells ( ). Adhesion of V. cholerae has also been investigated using fully differentiated mucus-secreting HT-29-18 N2 cells (409). V. cholerae uses its OmpU outer membrane protein to adhere to the brush border of fully differentiated Caco-2 cells (410). The type IV TCP of V. cholerae has three functions: it acts as a receptor for CTXPhi, the lysogenic filamentous bacteriophage that carries the CT genes in epidemic V. cholerae strains; it secretes the colonization factor TcpF and contributes to microcolony formation by mediating bacterium-bacterium interactions; and it acts as an attachment factor for binding to fully differentiated Caco-2 cells, since attachment was defective in mutants lacking TCP compared to in the wild type (411).\n\nEnterovirulent E. coli.\n\nSix classes of human enterovirulent E. coli have been defined: ETEC, EPEC, EHEC, EAEC, EIEC, and DAEC (304, 412–414). In addition, the existence of a particular group of E. coli strains named adherent-invasive E. coli (AIEC) has recently emerged from studies investigating mucosa-associated bacteria in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) (415–418). ETEC, EPEC, EHEC, and EAEC interacted with the brush border of mature enterocytes and remained extracellular. Nataro et al. (419), examining adhesion of diarrheagenic E. coli to cultured nonintestinal undifferentiated epithelial Hep-2 cells, first observed three different patterns of adhesion: diffuse adherence (DA), in which bacteria cover the whole surface of the cell, localized adherence (LA), in which attachment is limited to one or a few sites on the cell surface, and aggregative adherence (AA), in which adhering bacteria aggregate in an unorganized fashion. Only EIEC and AIEC are capable of entering and replicating within enterocytes.\n\n(i) ETEC.\n\nEnterotoxigenic E. coli strains are a main cause of diarrhea in young children under 5 years of age in developing countries and also in adult travelers visiting areas of endemicity (420). ETEC produces a cholera-like, watery diarrheal disease by adherence, involving adhesive factors, onto brush border-associated receptors in mature enterocytes and expression and delivery of heat-labile enterotoxin (LT) and/or heat-stable enterotoxin (ST)-recognizing, brush border-associated receptors activating cAMP or cGMP, respectively, and cell signaling controlling intestinal transports (308, 412, 421). ETEC attaches to microvilli via filamentous bacterial surface structures, known as colonization factors (CFs), and more than 20 different CFs have been described. A family of ETEC adhesive factors that includes colonization factor antigens (CFAs), E. coli surface antigens (CSAs), and PCFO71 has been classified with the class 5 fimbriae on the basis of the complete DNA sequences of the gene clusters encoding CFA/I, CS1, CS2, the major fimbrial subunit, and outer membrane protein (OMP) and of the primary sequence of the major fimbrial subunit, CFA/I, and related fimbriae, (422).\n\nDarfeuille-Michaud et al. (423) were the first to have reported that ETEC strains expressing colonization factor antigen I (CFA/I), CFA/II, CFA/III, and antigen 2230 adhere to isolated human enterocytes ( and ). Other ETEC adhesive factors conferring adhesion to fully differentiated Caco-2 cells have been identified, including adhesive factor PCFO20 (424), antigens 8786 (425), CS4 (422), CS6 (426), CS14 (422), CS17 (422), CS19 (427), CS20 (428), CS22 (429, 430), CS23 (431), and CS31A (432), PCF071 (422), type IV long pilus encoded by ingA (433), high-molecular-weight glycosylated protein EtpA (434), and the putative EtpB transporter (434). Adhesion of ETEC strains develops at the brush border without modifying the structure of the microvillus (423). The expression of ETEC CFA receptors at the brush borders of fully differentiated, HT-29 Glc−/+, and Caco-2 cells develops as a function of cell differentiation and appears to be controlled by the presence of glucose during cell culture (435, 436). ETEC bearing the fimbrial colonization factor antigens CFA/I, CFA/II, and CFA/III and the nonfimbrial antigen 2230 interacted with the mucus produced at the apical domain of fully differentiated mucin-secreting HT29-MTX cells (437). It was noted that ETEC strains have been found to be invasive in the undifferentiated ileocecal adenocarcinoma HCT-8 cells (216).\n\n(ii) EIEC.\n\nEnteroinvasive E. coli strains can cause diarrhea (304, 413, 414). EIEC strains are biochemically, genetically, and pathogenically closely related to Shigella spp. Like Shigella, EIEC infects the colonic mucosa. The pathogenesis of EIEC has not yet been fully elucidated. EIEC can be distinguished from Shigella by a few minor biochemical tests, but these pathotypes share several identical virulence factors (412–414, 438, 439). The genes necessary for EIEC cell entry are carried on a 140-MDa plasmid designated pInv. Prominent among these genes are the mxi and spa loci, which encode a T3SS that allows the secretion of numerous proteins, including the effectors of the invasion phenotype Ipa proteins such as IpaA, IpaB, IpaC, and IpaD. The escape of internalized EIEC from the endocytic vacuole into the cytoplasm is followed by an actin-dependent motility movement, which leads to the passage of the bacteria into neighboring cells.\n\nEIEC strains growing in the cytosol of undifferentiated confluent Caco-2 cells utilize glucose, but not glucose 6-phosphate, or other phosphorylated carbohydrates, gluconate, or fatty acids as their main carbon substrates (397, 398) ( ). Moreno et al. (440) have compared the intracellular lifestyle of EIEC within fully differentiated Caco-2 cells at the cellular and molecular levels to that of S. flexneri. In a plaque assay of confluent undifferentiated Caco-2 cells, the levels found for EIEC and S. flexneri were similar at 1, 2, and 3 h postinfection, but at 4 and 5 h postinfection, fewer intracellular EIEC cells were found, suggesting lower intracellular proliferation than for S. flexneri.
