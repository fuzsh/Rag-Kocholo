Summary:In 'Preaching a Dual Identity' Nicholas Must examines seventeenth century Huguenot sermons seeing them as a window into the development of French Reformed confessional identity under the Edict of Nantes. In particular Must is concerned with the details of how a Huguenot hybrid identity was formulated an identity that balanced a strong sense of religious particularism with an enthusiastic political loyalism. Must argues that sermons were an integral part of asserting this unique confessional position, both in their preached an printed forms. To demonstrate this, Must studies a variety of sermon themes to access the range of images and arguments that preachers employed to articulate a particular vision of their community as a religious minority in France
