In modern years, they truly do serve that purpose. But like many government regulations, their origins have more to do with self-interest than safety.</p><p>The first proof marks started appearing in 15th century France, and by the 17th century, European firearms guildsmen were heavily promoting their use — and lobbying their governments for laws requiring them — primarily to dissuade competition from non-guildsmen and scare potential purchasers away from un-proofed guns.</p><p>In 1637, after heavy lobbying from the <em>London Gunmakers Company</em>, a London-area firearms guild, King Charles I issued a Royal Charter setting firearms safety standards. The London Gunmakers Company set up a “proof house” in London, and not surprisingly… firearms makers who were not part of a guild tended to fail testing more often than the guild members. Guns that passed testing were stamped with a mark representing the proof house. Over the next few decades, other countries established their own safety standards and proof houses, along with their own unique marks. Much like reciprocity of modern concealed carry permits between states, some European countries began to recognize each others’ proof marks as a high enough testing standard for foreign countries’ firearms to be legally imported.</p><img src='https://images.gunsinternational.com/listings_sub/acc_993/gi_101146404/Sig-Sauer-P365-9mm-Caliber-Pistol-NIB-S-N-66A250052XX_101146404_993_46800674F8E0E30C.JPG' alt='Sig sauer p365 serial number location' title='Sig sauer p365 serial number location' /><p>Fast forward to 1914, when a number of European countries formed the CIP (Commission Internationale Permanente pour l’Epreuve des Armes à Feu Portatives) as a formal standards group to ensure consistent testing among member countries. As of 2015, the CIP includes 14 member states. In order for a civilian firearm produced in a CIP member state to be legally imported to another CIP country, it must bear the proof mark of a CIP member state (military testing standards are, predictably, different than civilian ones). The United States does not participate in CIP, but instead formed its own standards group named SAAMI (Sporting Arms and Ammunition Manufacturers’ Institute). While the CIP and SAAMI do share information and cooperate, neither has a requirement regarding selling in each other’s countries. <strong>Because the US is not a CIP member state, foreign guns do not need a CIP proof mark to be sold in the US, nor do US guns need a US proof mark to be sold in CIP member countries.</strong> This is an important fact that will become relevant again later in this article.</p><h2><span>Examples of German Proof Marks</span></h2><p><span>Here’s an assortment of mid 20th century proof marks used through Germany’s (and West Germany’s) history:</span></p><h3 id='sig-sauer-p220-serial-number-location'>Sig Sauer P220 Serial Number Location</h3><p>The top row (a) indicates the German (or East/West German, depending on the year) city in which the proof house is located. The column marked (b) shows varios German/West German proof marks after 1945, while the column marked (c) shows German proof marks used from 1939-1945.</p><p>Here’s another image showing the marks of German/West German proof houses, along with the approximate year they were first in use:</p><img src='https://i.imgur.com/eSkew45.jpg' alt='Sig sauer serial number lookup' title='Sig sauer serial number lookup' /><h2>Proof Marks on SIG Sauer Pistols</h2><p>Depending on it’s vintage and model, you might see proof marks on a German / West German SIG’s frame:</p><p>Proof mark on a West German P220 frame</p>Or on its barrel:On the slide chin (the underside of the slide near the muzzle end), which is the most common location for West German and German SIG Sauers:<p>Proof marks on the slide chin of a West German SIG Sauer pistol</p>To make sense of these proof marks, let’s look at those on the above slide chin.<h2>Kiel Proof House Mark</h2><p>The top proof mark indicates the <strong>Kiel Proof House</strong>. Since Kiel is only 17 miles from SIG Sauer’s manufacturing facility in Eckernförde, that’s the proof mark you should expect to see on a proofed SIG Sauer. Many refer to the Kiel mark as a “squashed bug,” while others have claimed it’s an oak leaf. Actually, the proof mark is based on the city of Kiel’s coat of arms:</p>…which in turn is based on the district of Schaumburg’s coat of arms:<p>Coat of arms of Schaumburg</p>The shape represents a <em>Nesselblatt</em>, or nettle leaf. Tradition held that the leaves of the nettle were symbolic of the nails used to crucify Christ, so the three larger leaves represent the nails of the crucifixion.<p>All true German and West German SIGs were test fired at the Kiel proof house, so the Nesselblatt proof mark is an indicator of a true German or West German SIG. I’ve also heard one report of the Ulm proof house’s stag antler mark appearing on a the frame and slide of a 1993 SIG P226 (in addition to the Kiel mark on the slide), which would imply that the firearm required repair and re-proofing… and presumably the repair took place at a location that was closer to Ulm than Kiel. Normally, you’d expect to see the Ulm proof mark on a Walther or H&amp;K firearm.</p><h2>The German Definitive Mark and Nitro Testing</h2><p>Underneath the Kiel Nesselblatt (though the order of the marks is not important), we find the image of an eagle with the letter “N” underneath. Some incorrectly believe that the eagle mark is a remnant of Nazi-era Germany, particularly since Germany’s firearms proof mark was a previously crown, and was changed to an eagle in 1939.</p><p>In actuality, the German <i>Reichsadler </i>(literally “Eagle of the Realm”) dates back to the eagle on the standard of the Roman Empire, and was used as a symbol of the Second German Empire as early as 1871… long before the National Socialist German Workers’ Party. The same eagle design has continued its use in West Germany since 1945, but under a new name of <em>Bundesadler,</em> or “Union Eagle.”</p><p>The Eagle-N mark signifies that the firearm was proofed in Germany (or West Germany, depending on when the firearm was proofed), while the “N” indicates that the firearm was proofed using a <em>Nitro Beschuss</em> load. “Beschuss” translates as “bombardment,” “shelling,” or “firing” depending on context, and “nitro” is short for “nitrocellulose,” a highly flammable compound used to creates pressures inside the firearm higher than standard gun powder.</p><p>Pistols are delivered to the proof houses in their fully assembled form for proofing. For pistols, CIP standards require cartridges that generate pressure 30% higher than the standard ammunition for which the pistol is designed, so the two high pressure nitro rounds are fired through the pistol. Technicians then disassemble the pistol and examine it in a dark room using a fluoroscopic lamp, looking for magnetic flux leakage. Provided everything looks good, the pistol is re-assembled and receives the country’s CIP proof mark indicating what type of test it passed (the Eagle-N or “definitive” mark in the case of a German gun), the mark of the proof house, and marks indicating the date of the tests. The firearms is then returned to the manufacturer who can legally sell the firearm domestically or export it to another CIP country.</p><p>The “nitro” proof mark is also referred to as the “definitive” (or final) mark of the proof house, as opposed to a “provisional” mark which would generally only apply to shotgun barrels in an early stage of manufacture, which are tested at proof houses to prevent the manufacturer from continuing work on defective tubes.</p><h2>Date Codes</h2><p><span>Looking back at our photo, the “JK” under the definitive proof mark is the <strong>date code</strong>. </span>Date codes are two-letter indicators of the year that a firearm was proofed. Major German firearms companies such as Heckler and Koch, Walther, and SIG Sauer all used a similar date code format:</p><p>German gun manufacturers used these letters in place of numbers for date codes</p>Just to keep things interesting, SIG Sauer chose not to use the letter “I” because it looked too much like the numeral “1,” so J = 8 in SIG speak. The proof house in Koln (Cologne), Germany also follows this format. Walther and Heckler &amp; Koch chose to use “I” for 8 but skip “J,” except that you will see a “J” on an H&amp;K magazine’s date code. Gotta love German logic. 🙂<img src='https://www.sigsauer.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/M17_COMMEMORATIVE_SHIP_BOX2-700x467.jpg' alt='Sig' title='Sig' /><p>Using the above table, we can determine that the “JK” date code in the photo stands for “89” — meaning this firearm was proofed in 1989… which coincidentally happened to be the year the Berlin Wall came down. This doesn’t necessarily mean that the pistol was <em>manufactured</em> in 1989. It’s quite possible the barrel was made in 1986, the frame in 1987, and the slide in 1988… but that all the parts weren’t assembled together into a firearm and delivered to a proof house until 1989. Or it’s possible that all the parts were actually made in 1989, and then assembled and proofed that same year. There’s no way to know. A true German / West German firearm isn’t technically “born” until it’s been proofed.</p><p>Note that a gun’s date code is <em>different</em> than its serial number. It’s impossible to decode a SIG serial number to determine when it was proofed, although you can try to locate the range of your SIG’s serial number in this list to approximate when it was made, or call SIG Sauer with the serial number and see if they have any info in their system. Serial numbers aren’t always truly representative of the chronological order of a firearm, but they can sometimes get you close. Only a date code can tell you the year of proofing.</p><h2>Proofed vs. Non-Proofed “Made in Germany” Guns</h2><p>If you’ve read my article on West German vs. German vs. Other SIGs, you’ll know that proof marks are one of the primary indicators or whether a SIG Sauer (or any other firearm) is truly “made” in Germany (or West Germany) as opposed to assembled in the US using German-made parts… even though the parts might be stamped “Made in Germany.” Because the US is not a CIP country, guns marked “Made in Germany” do not need to be proofed in order to be sold here, as long as they are assembled in the US.</p><p>In my opinion, a gun without German proof marks (with <em>very</em> few exceptions) is not truly a German gun. Whether that actually affects the desirability or quality of the gun is for you to decide. But you should at least be aware that for most SIG purists, the existence of proof marks is what determines whether a gun is correctly referred to as “Made in Germany.”</p><h3 id='sig-sauer-serial-number-check'>Sig Sauer Serial Number Check</h3><h2>Putting it All Together</h2><p>Now that you know how to decode proof marks and date codes, see if you can figure out where and when the following firearms were proofed.

PC game review. Publisher/Developer: Muzzy Lane. $29.99; <em>World Wars</em> package (<em>The Great War</em> and <em>War of the World</em>), $34.99<br /></strong></p><p><b>Passed Inspection: </b>Great historical detail and breadth, excellent AI, allows innovative strategies, much replay value</p><p><b>Failed Basic:</b> Steep learning curve, bland graphics, only two long scenarios.</p><p>All war games allow players to change history: Pickett’s charge may work if done well; an early Allied attack in the West could end World War II in 1939. Yet, all these examples work within strict parameters. Players have limited freedom of action to keep the games from being wildly ahistorical. Muzzy Lane’s <i>Making History</i> series shows how to give players vast latitude while not going into science-fiction style alternatives. Their latest game<i>, Making History: The Great War</i>, is great example of how intense research in a period creates a game that allows players to think and act outside the box without violating the realities of the period under study.</p><h2 id='the-great-war-youtube'>The Great War Youtube</h2><p><b>Appearance Isn’t Everything.</b><br />The graphics for this game won’t win even Honorable Mention at an eye-candy convention. Maps—covering around 200 countries, colonies and protectorates—are simply bland with cities tending to look alike, resources blurry at even the closest zoom and terrain features such as rivers and mountains not very outstanding. The military sprites have the correct uniform types but do not inspire any “OOOHs.” Some ships and aircraft, including zeppelins, are exceptions to the usual blandness. Animations indicate movement and combat but can block access to the yellow-orange blotches that provide information on battles. The poster-like announcements of events at the beginning of turns provide nice breaks from the visual monotony, as does the parade of era-correct flags.</p><p>However, game play depends on functionality, not glitz and <i>Making History: The Great War</i> provides functional graphic effects in spades. Twelve map overlays provide information on matters such as diplomacy, national stability, resources, demographics and supply. Each map has color-coded sub-categories related to the issue—for example, the resource map is broken down into resource type with levels of production. Zooming in and out, these maps can give players solid understanding of their empire. This understanding is further expanded by a myriad of tables accessed through seven tabs that open up windows for factors like politics, the military, trade and production. Each window, in turn, yields multiple levels of detail on the subject. The military window shows all of an empire’s forces and then breaks them down by land, sea, and air units. This breakdown continues in groups for each unit type with a further panel to give empire-level orders. Helpful tool tips clarify each sub-division of all factors in a window. Moving around maps and the research tree can be done through arrow keys or “grabbing” with a left click and dragging the map.</p><p>Simpler but perhaps more important are the elements in the bar at the top of the screen. The elements represent the stockpiles of arms, food, metal, steel, fuel, oil, coal, gas shells and money. Mousing over each shows how much of that resource is in storage versus the amount in demand. The similar boxes to the left show the same things for road, rail and shipping capacity. Right-clicking anywhere on an empire allows selection of the empire’s statistics and status for economics, internal affairs, research and diplomatic ties. Taxes can be raised and diplomatic actions made from this window. The sound effects in this game are as bland but functional as the graphics and the music, while nice for a few minutes, invokes Benjamin Britten at his most somnambulant. The tutorial scenario uses Austro-Hungary during the summer of 1914 to teach basic gameplay, and the 56-page PDF manual is fairly comprehensive but lacks page numbers in the table of contents. The tutorial and manual are helpful but nothing can truly prepare gamers for the scope and detail of the game. New players may be better off playing “plucky little” Belgium to begin.</p><img src='https://images.gamewatcherstatic.com/game/image/2/77/1502/medium_130033447.jpg' alt='With' title='With' /><p><b>In the Deep End</b><br /><i>Making History: The Great War</i> is a turn-based game with week-long turns. Other than the tutorial, the game comes with two scenarios: the inevitable July 1914 run-up to the war and one that begins in 1912. Players can choose one of the eight Great Powers or select a smaller country. The game can continue for eight years after the scenario start with victory decided by the amount of victory points gained through territorial gains, military power, regional improvements and research.</p><p>The July 1914 scenario begins with all powers ready for war. Austria-Hungary will go after Serbia, and war of some sort will happen. Military matters become the focus of play with the other aspects subordinate to the demands of war. True, peace can be made, but usually just as a breather before re-starting the fighting. The 1912 scenario is where all aspects of the game are of equal importance.</p><p>In 1912, the world is open for players. Perusal of resource stockpiles is a good start to determine direction. Shortages in metal, coal and food can be rectified by right-clicking on regions to create infrastructure to increase output of coal and metals or to build better farms for more food. If stockpiles are solid, building amenities like hospitals, power stations and universities in regions may help stability. Improving roads and railroads allows for better transport of goods and resources—and troops if necessary; some heavy artillery units require railroads. Any improvements cost resources so players should resist the urge to overbuild and should look at what their cities are producing to either decrease the need for a resource or increase a particular capacity.</p><p>If needed resources are not present in an empire, trade is the answer. Trade is handled in two ways. Empires can choose to buy or sell resources on the world market or try to get a trade agreement with a specific nation. Prices are fixed by the game but players can control the amount purchased or sold. Limitations on trade not only affect diplomatic relations and money but also reduce rail and shipping capacity. Every import and export reduces these capacities.</p><p>Cities are another important cog in the economic wheel. Clicking on a city (or scrolling through cities) shows the number of factories it has and if it recruits troops. An empty factory slot can be filled with the factory type, dependent on the city’s infrastructure and available resources. An order slot reveals possibilities for buildings. Again, the benefits of factories may be outweighed by the costs of not only building them but providing the raw materials for production. Other buttons show the city’s tax income, buildings, factories and recruitment order.</p><p>The research tree has three levels: pre-industrial, early industrialization and machine age. Great powers begin with most of the early industrial projects already completed but a few remain. Depending on players’ strategy, uncompleted industrial projects can be mopped up or players can begin researching the machine age. The costs in money and research points are found by clicking on the encyclopedia button, which also explains benefits accrued and prerequisites. Research points are gained by building universities and research centers.</p><p>Despite all the building, <i>Making History: The Great War</i> is not a country-building game; improvements and resource management are secondary to governing. Selecting the country tab brings up the issues players must cope with internally. Right-clicking a region and then choosing “Select (Whichever Empire Being Played)” will bring up the government window. Clicking the flag opens the governmental choices list. Here, players can adjust taxes and increase or decrease funding to social programs, religion, education, propaganda and purging corruption. Also possible is ordering a trade offer from a colony, relocating a capitol or, if a rebellion occurs and a splinter nation is created, funding a coup against the rebels. All these options should be made in conjunction with the regional map overlay to check on national stability and unrest.</p><img src='https://www.console-deals.com/advice/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/xhalo-wars-2.jpg.pagespeed.ic.8vXVv6ME3Y.jpg' alt='Console' title='Console' /><p>Diplomacy is the other hand of governance. Clicking on a nation or picking it from the list from the diplomacy tab allows the usual functions of trade agreements, military access, territorial concessions, alliances or war. The shadier side of diplomacy has financial support for the government, faction or coup attempts. Diplomatic moves of multi-ethnic empires should coincide with domestic policy.</p><p><b>The Sharp End</b><br />Regardless of how pacific players act, their empire will eventually be drawn into a war. Signs of impending conflicts can be seen in notification pop-ups at the beginning of turns, announcing diplomatic moves and wars as well as interesting events like the <i>Titanic</i>’s sinking. Some events will have no interest to players but others may be crucial, particularly those events that require players’ response. For instance, the US won’t care about the activities of the Dervish but will care about Mexican affairs. The diplomacy window will list wars and allow players to support sides. However, taking sides requires a military.</p><p>An empire’s military has four parts, the troops, navy, fledging air force and artillery. Each of these is broken down by type, e.g., infantry, engineers, dreadnoughts, rigid airships and field guns. Troop types are recruited from cities, artillery is built at cities with steel and tool factories, ships are constructed at shipyards and planes at hangers. Although always called armies, troops seem to be regiments, guns are batteries and aircraft are squadrons. Ships are shown individually. Units can be merged into larger groups which can then be split. The military panel yields group positions, costs and combat power. This panel is also used to set readiness and mobilization levels. High levels increase combat prowess but is expensive. As war looms, armed forces should be readied but going to general mobilization too fast is not only expensive, it sends a dangerous signal to neighbors. Units are moved individually by selecting them and right-clicking on destinations. Movement options include road and rail travel if transportation capacity is sufficient. Aircraft need an airbase at the destination, but naval forces move freely.</p><p>War can be started in two ways: by simply moving a unit into a foreign country or declaring war via diplomacy. The latter course is best as players can call on alliance members to join the fray. Land combat happens when enemy units meet in a region, although heavy howitzers can bombard from adjacent regions, with observation balloons decreasing the chance of friendly fire casualties. Battles are marked by splotches; their names appear when moused over. Clicking on a battle shows each army’s number of units, attack and defense modifiers, and morale. Once commenced, players can only reinforce a battle, which will end when one side’s morale drops to a low point. Morale drop is a function of a force’s percentage losses, so a large force can lose several units without significant morale effects. Naval combat is very similar, but submarines and merchant raiders can interdict enemy shipping.</p><h2 id='world-war-1'>World War 1</h2><p>Battles can last for weeks and players who focus on one area of operations may feel bored just clicking through turns. They would be wrong. Events are happening around the world and the AI has surprises. Allies may change sides, war weariness may cause civil war and the AI may do something completely opposite of the historical track, such as Germany abandoning the Schlieffin plan and using Moltke the Elder’s “Russia First” strategy. Players should look to their colonies, either to defend them or go on the offensive. Research will provide new weapons that may decide the war. All this time, players also need to tend domestic affairs. Military operations, though crucial, are only part of this game.</p><p>Replay possibilities are tremendous given the number of countries to be played, a very surprising AI and multi-play via Steam. A newly added editor will allow mods when a manual is finished for it.</p><img src='https://images.gamewatcherstatic.com/news/image/1/1c/951/index_0038906.jpg' alt='Making history the great war console commands pdf' title='Making history the great war console commands pdf' /><h2 id='the-console-war'>The Console War</h2><p><i>Making History: The Great War</i> can be improved. An auto-victory option based on gains and losses could accommodate players who don’t want to wait 435 turns to see which empire has the most points. Another option would be to give players a bit more control over battles. These recommendations in no way neglect the fact that this game is a superlative experience in learning, creativity and entertainment.</p><img src='https://blog.playstation.com/tachyon/2018/09/L-lead-hand.jpg' alt='Making History The Great War Console Commands' title='Making History The Great War Console Commands' /><h2 id='making-history-the-great-war-console-commands-cheat'>Making History The Great War Console Commands Cheat</h2><p><b>Armchair General Rating: 89%</b></p><p><b>About the Author</b><br />Jim <span>Cobb</span> has been playing board wargames since 1961 and computer wargames since 1982.
