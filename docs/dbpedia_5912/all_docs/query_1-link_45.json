        "text": "Stylus RMX Xpanded is an award-winning, industry standard groove-based virtual instrument plug-in. Stylus RMX Xpanded is the first product to offer the combined power of Groove ControlÂ® with Spectrasonics Advanced Groove Engine (S.A.G.E.â¢) technology giving users dramatic control over groove production and performance. Spectrasonicsâ in-house development team created the instrument from the ground up, with dozens of innovative features including the ground-breaking Time Designer®, Chaos Designer®, a completely redesigned multi-page user interface, a legendary core library of sounds, all with a focus on realtime groove creation and performance. RMX quickly became and remains an industry standard tool of most top composers and music producers.\n\nUnsurpassed Innovations\n\nOf the many remarkable capabilities in Stylus RMX Xpanded, possibly the most innovative features are the Time Designer® and Chaos DesignerÂ®. With simple controls, the user can introduce musical Chaos into the groove, which allows it to have constantly evolving variationsâ giving the impression that the audio grooves are improvising. The results can be subtle or extreme by setting the simple to use controls. A Capture feature allows the spontaneous audio chaos patterns to be made into a MIDI file, dragged and dropped into the host sequencer, and played back again for further editing by the user. The Time Designer feature is unmatched in any other rhythm software and allows realtime changing of audio grooves to any time signature, feel or pattern - an infinite creative tool!\n\nCore Library\n\nThe highly acclaimed core library in Stylus RMX Xpanded has thousands of cutting-edge grooves and sounds that were created by Spectrasonicsâ international sound design team, and produced by Eric Persing. The core library contains nearly triple the amount of sounds originally offered in the original Stylus, and contains all the original material as well. The sounds and grooves in Stylus RMX Xpanded offer a much wider range of modern musical genres than the original Stylus. Mixes of grooves are broken down into individual tracks called Elements for flexibility and infinite combinations.\n\nAlso introduced in Stylus RMX Xpanded are thousands of Kit modules, 250 Kit patches, as well as user Kit construction....Users can create their own customized multitrack remix grooves and kits, save them into the plug-in, and even share them with other Stylus RMX Xpanded users on different platforms and hosts. RMX now even comes with 500 Multi grooves.\n\nXpanded and Xpandable\n\nStylus RMX Xpanded now includes all five Spectrasonics âS.A.G.E. Xpandersâ, bringing the total number of included grooves/sounds to nearly 10,000. The RMX platform has huge third-party library support with hundreds of available titles and can also can be expanded with REX files â which opens the door for musicians to utilize their own audio loops within the powerful S.A.G.E. Environment."
