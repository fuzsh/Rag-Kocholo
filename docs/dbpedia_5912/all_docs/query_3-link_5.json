        "text": "Hey everyone. I don't have a dog in this fight at all, but i wanted to give a shout-out to Eric and the gang, especially after the virtual whiplash a lot of people think they are suffering upon the latest release of Keyscape.\n\nHere's my 2 cents. I don't want to get all \"I remember when\" on you, but I remember when I first started into just WANTING to own my first keyboard, in the early 80s. Where I lived, you couldn't even find more than a Korg Poly 800 or DW-8000. Eventually, by the mid eighties, a Mirage showed up at a local store and that seemed like a miracle, but it was all just a dream to me because everything was so expensive, at east for me it was.\n\nI never was able to afford my own keyboard other than a Yamaha PSR-32 and a few other home models, Casios, etc.\n\nIn about 92, I got what I considered my first real synth, the Roland U-20. For a synth, it was weak, but to me, it was amazing at around $1,100. Years go by, I start earning money, and go through a few mid-line keyboards, never buying the big stuff but still getting into the game. I could play gigs with great (we all thought so at the time) pianos, organs, synth sounds (samples of synths) etc etc....\n\nThen in early 2000s everything started getting really crazy with Giga Sampler and the like. I buy my first PC and Cubase (2 I think), and start the ascension to virtual instrument greatness. All of a sudden, for $3000, and 4 PCs, you could own and run EWQLSO. For $500, you could have a choir with Symphony of Voices. Then Atmosphere came out and was freaking totally revolutionary, as well as RMX, and Trillian, and Omnisphere, and all the add-ons.\n\nAll of this to say, Eric has done a HUGE service to the community and culture of electronic arts and music. He's done SO much more than what I am skimming over here in my shadowy memory banks, but it has been of the most important and ground-breaking contributions of the entire industry.\n\nTo my point, I am disappointed in anyone feeling the need to whine about the latest release not being what they wanted or expected. I know there are public forums, and that most of us enjoy free speech, but I wouldn't want to be Eric having to read many of the posts about the latest release. Some are whiny, some are downright unpleasant, here and elsewhere on the internet.\n\nAt this point, I'd say that if Eric wanted to deeply sample the largest collection of vintage kazoos and cricket legs, it's totally his call and that he'll surely bring something new and useful to the table no matter what. That's what he has always done.\n\nI do understand that people might be disappointed, but that's mainly because all of Spectrasonics' releases have been SO ground-breaking and this one meets that definition as well, just not in the way you had fantasized. Tell me in your wildest fantasies; What could anyone release in this day and age that would be jaw-dropping. I mean, less than 20 years ago you couldn't have imagined an entire orchestra, now you have probably 20 of them, or a deeply sampled piano, of which you own 17 of the available 242. The market is saturated and we have the best prices on the most AMAZING tools ever.\n\nThe only person who can change the whole game for you is yourself. I plan on doing that with the help of some amazing VI's, many that came from Eric P.\n\nIn short: Holy Sh*t this world is amazing!!! Stop whining and use the amazing things we have, and be thankful for them."
