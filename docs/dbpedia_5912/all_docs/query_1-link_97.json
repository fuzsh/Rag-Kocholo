        "text": "Because of the size of our instruments, we don't offer Demo versions. However, you can contact one of our local dealers in your area in order to arrange a live demo of Omnisphere 2. To find a local dealer in your area, please contact your local Authorized Reseller.\n\nAll Spectrasonics instruments are available in two different editions: Boxed and Download. The physical boxed editions now contain high quality USB drives and are sold exclusively to new customers through our Authorized Resellers. The download editions are now available and sold exclusively through our Webstore.\n\nYes to all of the above! We are happy to announce that there are now alternative forms of installation available optionally to registered users - no matter which edition you have originally purchased.\n\nTo address all the various user needs and scenarios, we now have added a REINSTALL tab in the User Account area for easy downloading of a product you have purchased whenever that is needed. The Support Services area of our Webstore offers USB Drives for optional purchase for registered users.\n\nNo. Customers who participate in a special upgrade program for any Spectrasonics virtual instruments are not eligible for license transfers either for the original instrument or its subsequent upgrade. For example, if an original owner of Atmosphere takes advantage of our special “legacy” upgrade program to Omnisphere 2, the owner is not permitted to resell either instrument and no license transfer will be granted.\n\nAll our instruments include a comprehensive online Reference Guide, which is accessible directly through the plug-in. The integrated Reference Guide is searchable and we can keep it up to date with the software releases. You can check out the Reference Guide HERE.\n\nYes, you can definitely install the library to a secondary or external drive. It is very important that it is NOT formatted to FAT32 though, otherwise the performance will be extremely sluggish. It's recommended to always reformat a new drive to newer standards prior to installing Omnisphere on that drive.\n\nOmnisphere 2 supports one audio file of any length per soundsource. You can layer up to four soundsources in a patch and 8 patches in a multi. Keep in mind that Omnisphere's focus is as a synthesizer and will never be a sampler with multiple velocities, key-mapping, round-robin, etc. - there are other instruments out there that do that very well.\n\nOmnisphere 2 allows you to easily turn your audio files and even your audio tracks/mixes into synthesis source for Omnisphere 2's powerful oscillators. It's remarkable how much you can creatively mangle one sound and transform it into something awesome!"
