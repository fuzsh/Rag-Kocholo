        "text": "Catcher Tucker Barnhart has signed a minor-league deal with the Cincinnati Reds. This comes after he was released by the Arizona Diamondbacks last month. According to Jon Heyman, the veteran catcher is returning to the team that spent most of his career with, albeit on a minor league deal.\n\nReds Sign Catcher Tucker Barnhart to a Minor League Deal\n\nDrafted by the Reds in 2009, Barnhart spent the first eight years of his career in Cincinnati. A two-time Gold Glove winner, the 33-year-old has received strong grades for his blocking and control of the running game. Coming off his second Gold Glove, Barnhart caught Wade Miley‘s no-hitter in 2021 before being traded to the Detroit Tigers. Throughout his 11-year big league career, Barnhart has been stronger behind the plate than at the plate. But since leaving Cincinnati ahead of the 2022 season, his offense has been steadily declining.\n\nBarnhart spent the entire 2022 season with Detroit playing in 94 games while posting a .221/.287/.267 slash line. Following his stint with the Tigers, Barnhart signed a two-year contract with the Cubs in 2023. However, he was designated for assignment after just 44 games. Appearing in 31 games with the Diamondbacks to begin the season, he was designated for assignment and released last month. Despite hitting .208/.286/.255 in the majors going back to 2022, Barnhart’s defensive work continues to get strong grades.\n\nAiming to bring his veteran experience back to the organization where his career began, Barnhart is returning to the Reds to provide much-needed catching depth. Tyler Stephenson and Luke Maile are Cincinnati’s primary catching duo, but third catcher Austin Wynns is on the injured list. Eric Yang was called up from Triple-A Louisville to cover for Wynns but was outrighted back to Louisville once Maile returned. In the coming days, Barnhart will likely report to Triple-A Louisville, joining Yang as non-roster depth options for Cincinnati.\n\nPhoto Credit: © Sam Greene via Imagn Content Services, LLC"
