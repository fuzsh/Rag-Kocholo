        "text": "The 89th Major League Baseball All — Star Game is schedule to take place Tuesday, July 17 in Washington D.C.’s Nationals Park. I could not be more excited for the game to take place in this ball park as I love the city. Washington D.C. dates back to 1790, the year it also became our nation’s capital. The political significance alone is enough to make it one of my favorite places to be in and explore. But, I also fell in love with D.C. for its rich baseball history. From the city’s first team in 1859 to the present-day Washington Nationals, the city has gone through ups and downs regarding their baseball franchises.\n\nThe name “Nationals” dates back to the first club which was formed in 1859. That team was mostly made up of government clerks, who were often found practicing on the grounds of the White House. The team played through the Civil War when other clubs tended to fade from view and in 1867 they became the first team to travel West of the Allegheny Mountains to cities such as Cincinnati, Louisville, Indianapolis, Chicago, and St. Louis.\n\nThis league disbanded in 1875 but was replaced the following year by the National League of Professional Base Ball Clubs. D.C. teams included the Washington Statesmen in the American Association and the Washington Nationals in the Union Association. Neither of these teams was any good, and the Nationals hung up their spikes after the 1889 season.\n\n*** Notable Player: 1888 — William or “Dummy” Hoy. A deaf and mute player who stole 82 bases as a rookie outfielder for the Nationals. As legend goes, the umpires started using hand signals to accommodate his disability.\n\nWhen Ban Johnson founded the American League in 1901 he gave Washington D.C. another chance at a baseball franchise. Officially name named the Senators, the team was also called the “Nationals”, and “Nats” by the fans and media over the next 60 years. However, they did not have much success at first, finishing below 7th place in the league until the 1912 season. The tides turned after that; from then until 1933 the Senators were considered one or the most successful franchises in the MLB. The team’s roster in this span included Hall of Famers; Goose Gosling, Sam Rice, Joe Cronin, Bucky Harris, Heinie Manush, and Walter Johnson. Despite their success in these middle years, the Senators are remembered most for their many years of mediocrity and failures, including six last place finishes.\n\n*** 1902 — Ed Delahanty signed with the Nationals after they gave him a $1000 pay raise to pull him away from their National League rivals, the Philadelphia Phillies. In 1902, he hit .376. However, just two months into the 1903 season, Delahanty was suspended for missing a game. He boarded a train from Detroit to New York and got was ejected near Niagara Falls for threatening other passengers. His body was found a few days later in the Niagara River. He was 35 years old and the cause of his death still remains a mystery. Some suspect suicide, others an accident, and some even think it may have been robbery murder.\n\n*** 1907 — Walter Perry Johnson, or the “Big Train,” was signed when he was 19 years old. In his first full season, he went 14–14 with for a very bad Senators team but his ERA was a spectacular a 1.65. By the end of his career, Johnson set the all-time strikeout record at 3,508 (later broken by Nolan Ryan) and he also led the league in strikeouts a dozen times. His 417–279 record (.599) puts him second in career wins behind Cy Young.\n\nWorld Champions!\n\nComing off of two straight losing seasons and four managers in four years, the Senators had no expectations of becoming contenders in 1924. Owner Clark Griffith named 27 year old second baseman, Bucky Harris, as playing manager at the beginning of the season. Despite their previous losing records, Washington ended up with a talented team including two future Hall of Fame outfielders, Goose Goslin and Sam Rice. The team was very skilled offensively and contained five hitters with an average over .300. Walter Johnson anchored a solid rotation which also included George Mogridge and Tom Zachary. They would face the New York Giants in the World Series and even though the Giants were heavily favored, the Senators forced a 7 game series. Game 7 was a thriller and lasted 12 innings, culminating with the team’s first and only World Series title.\n\nThe franchise repeated as American League champions in 1925 but lost the World Series to the Pittsburgh Pirates. They endured some mediocre seasons before returning to the World Series in 1933 where they would face the Giants again, but this time would lose in five games. The season after started the Senator’s skid down the ranks. The team was the butt of many nationwide jokes during the 1950s for their poor performances. The famous 1904 joke about the Nationals, “Washington, first in war, first in peace, and last in the American League” was reborn into use with a slight twist into “Washington, first in war, first in peace, and STILL last in the American League.”\n\n***1954 — Harmon Killebrew signed with the Senators at 17 years old. He bounced between the major and minor leagues for the next few years. In 1959, he became the regular third baseman and led the League with 42 home runs, earning a starting spot on the All Star team. He provided frequent excitement for the franchise during the late 1950s and was seen as their leading player and the star of the team.\n\nThe first major era of the Washington Nationals in Major League Baseball ended in 1961. Clark Griffith died in 1955 and his nephew Calvin took over as the team president. Calvin sold Griffith Stadium to the city of Washington and was planning to take place in the baseball franchise shift of the mid — 20th century. The Braves, Browns, and Athletics all moved earlier in the 1950s, and he was planning to follow suit. He took his team west and the old Washington Senators became the new Minnesota Twins.\n\nWashington was awarded with an expansion team after they lost theirs in 1961. For most for their existence, this Nationals Senators team was horrible, losing an average of 90 games a season. Ownership changed hands several times during this span, but the franchise’s stay in Washington was constantly plagued by poor decision making and planning. The 1969 season was their only winning one.\n\nOwner, Bob Short threatened to move the team if nobody bought it. He priced it at $12 million (for comparison, the New York Yankees sold for $8.8 million in 1973). Nobody bought the team, and at the end of the 1970 season Short dealt his best starting pitcher and left side of the infield to the Detroit Tigers for pitcher, Denny McLain. In 1968 McClain had won 30 games and the Cy Young, but in 1970 he spent most of his time suspended because of gambling allegations. The trade made the Tigers a contender and McClain lost a league worst 22 games. When Short announced he was moving the team to Texas, fans were outraged. After the 1971 season, the Senators moved to Arlington, Texas, and debuted as the Texas Rangers the following spring. This marked the end of baseball in the nation’s capital for 33 years.\n\nThe Montreal Expos, a Canadian professional baseball team based in Montreal, Quebec was the next baseball franchise to play in Washington D.C. Following the 2004 season, they relocated to Washington, D.C. and became the Washington Nationals.\n\nThis iteration of Washington D.C.’s baseball franchise is still there today as the present day Washington Nationals. They play in National’s Park and will be hosting the 2018 All — Star game. Three seasons after their return to the capital, they built a state of the art ballpark in the Capitol Riverfront neighborhood. This team has brought us great first round talent such as Ryan Zimmerman, Stephen Strasburg, Bryce Harper, and Anthony Rendon and were the National League East division winners in 2016 and 2017.\n\nFor the 2018 MLB All — Star game, Nationals players, Bryce Harper and Max Scherzer will participate in the game while closer, Sean Doolittle was selected but will not participate due to injury. Harper was voted in as a starting outfielder by fans and while no starting pitcher has been named, Scherzer is remains a front runner.\n\nWashington D.C. is one of the United States’ most interesting baseball cities. From winning the World Series in 1924, to losing their franchise twice and the return of the Nationals in 2005, the city has had its fair share of good and bad with regards to baseball. Another historic event is taking place in Washington D.C. this July. Baseball Treasure coins are making their debut at the MLB All — Star game on Tuesday, July 17th. Find out exactly where we’ll be and how you can find us in my next post.\n\nFor more information on how to #JoinTheHunt visit the website!\n\nBaseball Treasure\n\nRiley Poole\n\nBaseball Treasure\n\nRiley Poole\n\nBaseball Treasure\n\nRiley Poole"
