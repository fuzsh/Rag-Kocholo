        "text": "For the sake of simplicity, we will break down the Nationals roster by position group. One thing you will notice, is the Nationals are willing to explore any and all options in order to add someone that they think will add value to their team.\n\nStarting Pitchers\n\nMax Scherzer: After breaking onto the scene with the Detroit Tigers from 2010-2014, Max Scherzer signed a 7-year $210 million dollar contract with the Washington Nationals during the 2014-2015 MLB offseason.\n\nStephen Strasburg: Stephen Strasburg was a product of the terrible Nationals teams in the late 2000’s. After finishing dead last in 2008, the Nationals had the first pick in the 2009 MLB draft, and they selected Strasburg with that pick. In May of 2016, the Nationals locked Strasburg up for the long term, signing him to a 7-year $175 million dollar contract extension.\n\nPatrick Corbin: During the 2018-2019 MLB offseason, while the Nationals were losing superstar Bryce Harper, they went out and made one of the biggest pitching acquisitions of the offseason, signing Patrick Corbin to a 6-year $140 million dollar contract.\n\nAnibal Sanchez: Anibal Sanchez had a strong bounce-back season with the Atlanta Braves in 2018. As a result, this motivated the Nationals to give him a 2-year ,$19 million dollar contract, with a third-year team option, last winter.\n\nRelief Pitchers\n\nSean Doolittle: Before the 2017 MLB trade deadline, the Nationals traded for Sean Doolittle and Ryan Madson. In exchange, the Nationals traded away Blake Treinen and Jesus Luzardo.\n\nDaniel Hudson: Just hours before the 2019 MLB trade deadline, the Nationals acquired Daniel Hudson from the Toronto Blue Jays, in exchange for minor leaguer Kyle Johnson.\n\nWander Suero: As part of the 2010 International free agent class, Wander Suero signed with the Nationals and has spent the past 10 seasons with the organization.\n\nTanner Rainey: The Cincinnati Reds drafted Tanner Rainey 71st overall in the 2015 MLB draft. Last winter, the Reds sent Rainey sent to the Nationals, in exchange for Tanner Roark.\n\nFernando Rodney: After getting released by the Oakland Athletics back in May, the Nationals signed him to a minor league deal a week later.\n\nJavy Guerra: The Nationals claimed Javy Guerra off waivers in May of 2019. They then designated him for assignment in July, before re-signing him again in August.\n\nJoe Ross: In December 2014, the Nationals traded away Steven Souza, as part of a three-team deal with the Tampa Bay Rays and San Diego Padres.\n\nInfielders\n\nRyan Zimmerman: As the fourth overall pick in the 2005 MLB Draft, Ryan Zimmerman was the first ever draft pick by the Nationals organization after they moved away from Montreal.\n\nAsdrubal Cabrera: The day after the Texas Rangers released Asdrubal Cabrera in August of 2019, the Nationals signed him to a minor-league contract.\n\nHowie Kendrick: Yet another trade deadline acquisition for the Nationals, Howie Kendrick first came to Washington D.C. in July of 2017, as part of a trade that sent McKenzie Mills to the Philadelphia Phillies. After the 2017 season ended, Kendrick re-signed with the Nationals on a 2-year $7 million dollar contract.\n\nBrian Dozier: After becoming a free agent at the end of the 2018 season, Brian Dozier signed a 1-year, $9 million dollar deal with the Nationals.\n\nTrea Turner: In the same trade that the Nationals acquired Joe Ross, Trea Turner was the headlining piece returning to the Nationals after being selected with the 13th overall pick by the San Diego Padres just six months prior.\n\nAnthony Rendon: The top of the 2011 MLB Draft was absolutely loaded, giving the Nationals plenty of options with the sixth overall selection. They decided to go with Anthony Rendon and haven’t looked back since. At the time of his selection, draftees were allowed to sign MLB contracts right after being drafted. As a result, Rendon signed a 4-year, $7.2 million dollar deal.\n\nKurt Suzuki: Once his time with the Twins had ended, Kurt Suzuki joined the Atlanta Braves organization, where he seemed to find his form from early in his career. This led Suzuki to signing a 2-year $10 million dollar contract with the Nationals last offseason.\n\nYan Gomes: With the Cleveland Indians desperate to find ways to trim money from their 2019 payroll, they opted to trade Yan Gomes and the $7 million that was due to him to the Nationals in exchange for prospects Daniel Johnson and Jefry Rodriguez.\n\nOutfielders\n\nJuan Soto: Signing with the Nationals for $1.5 million dollars, Juan Soto was one of the highest paid players in the 2015 international free agent class.\n\nAdam Eaton: After the 2016 season, the Chicago White Sox went into full fire sale mode to try to stockpile their farm system with as much talent as possible. One of the trades they made was sending outfielder Adam Eaton to the Nationals in exchange for Lucas Giolito, Reynaldo Lopez and Dane Dunning.\n\nVictor Robles: In the loaded 2013 international free agent class that featured players like Eloy Jimenez, Gleyber Torres and Rafael Devers, Victor Robles flew under the radar, and might go down as the steal of the class.\n\nGerardo Parra: The man who started the baby shark craze in Washington D.C. was signed by the Nationals in May of this year after the San Francisco Giants designated him for assignment.\n\nMichael A. Taylor: Stephen Strasburg wasn’t the only player on this roster that the Nationals picked up in the 2009 MLB draft, as they also took Michael A. Taylor in the sixth round, with the 172nd overall pick in that year’s draft.\n\nBy looking back on their roster, it is clear that Mike Rizzo and company had a layered approach when it came to building this roster. They made it their main priority to spend the majority of their budget on building a dominant top of the starting rotation. They also did an excellent job in armateur scouting and acquired many of their top players from the MLB draft and International free agency. They then went out and made a few trades to acquire a few more pieces to the puzzle. Once they had their core in place, they went to the scrap heap to fill out any remaining holes on their roster and squeeze as much value out of these players as they could. It might not have always looked pretty, but at the end of the day, banners fly forever."
