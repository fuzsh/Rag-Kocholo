        "text": "As the month of July came to an end Wednesday, Arizona Diamondbacks manager Torey Lovullo knew his team was in a far different place now compared with this time last year.\n\nIn 2023, the Diamondbacks had a July that gave no indication of the World Series run that was to come, going 8-16. This year, the club went 17-8 with wins in seven of their last eight games to end the month.\n\nThat included Wednesday afternoon’s cringy 5-4 win over the Washington Nationals, which moved the Diamondbacks into the second National League wild-card spot for the moment but assured them of holding a wild-card spot going into August.\n\nLovullo said the experience of having gone through a season of twists and turns has helped keep the team on an even keel, even when the Diamondbacks struggled earlier this season.\n\n“The first game back post-(All-Star) break, we immediately got into a little bit of a fistfight out there, and it got our heart pumping and got us focused. We’ve done a really good job for a couple of different reasons,” Lovullo said. “The experience has told us we’re OK. ... We know where those hot coals are and we’re avoiding them. And then just getting right into the heat of the moment immediately the first game back… our heart got pumping in Chicago.\n\n“August, everybody is jockeying and it’s go time. That’s what I want our team to focus on.\"\n\nIf August and September are loaded with games like Wednesday’s, Diamondbacks fans are in for another thrill ride. The Diamondbacks were headed for what looked like an easy win, up 5-1 through seven innings. But the bullpen couldn’t put away the pesky Nationals, who ultimately loaded the bases with one out, down 5-3 in the top of the ninth against struggling closer Paul Sewald.\n\nLovullo didn’t shut down the notion of Sewald being replaced, after expressing continued confidence in him last week. Sewald blew four saves in July and came close to another on Wednesday.\n\nLovullo said the first thing to look into with Sewald is a delivery issue.\n\n“I have a lot to think about over the next several hours, and I will,\" Lovullo said. “I just want to make sure that we dig into finding out what’s happening with him because he’s not hitting his spots. I know everybody wants to know what’s the closer situation -- 'are you going to dump him out of the closer role?'\n\n\"That’s not my priority with Paul right now. My priority is to find out if he’s getting blocked by some sort of a delivery. That’s my job, and then I’ll take the necessary steps from there.”\n\nEnter Ryan Thompson, who overcame a passed ball, struck out his first batter faced, and, after an intentional walk to reload the bases, induced a ground ball for the game’s final out. He earned his first save of the season.\n\n\"Going out there in that situation, I've been there before,\" Thompson said. \"Probably won't happen again. So it's one of those things where I go in, trust my defense and I think the worst thing you can do in that spot is nibble the zone. So I threw a few more balls than I wanted to, but I just wanted to go out there and give my team a chance.\"\n\nThompson said the team still believes in Sewald. His advice for Sewald is to keep trusting his stuff.\n\n\"Paul, he's a veteran,\" he said. \"He's not pouting, he's not overthinking it. He knows how good he is. He knows he's going to go out there the next time he gets the opportunity and get the job done. We all in this clubhouse, we believe in Paul a lot.\"\n\nThompson also said that the Diamondbacks hadn't played up to their expected level until now.\n\n\"This is the expectation,\" he said. \"I think we were in the World Series for a reason, and I think a lot of the come-from-behind wins we're seeing, we can start using the 'Answer-backs' thing again. We can start using the 'Embrace the Chaos,' all that stuff that was a little bit silent for a while.\n\n\"It's all back. The vibe, the aura that we feel, it's all there.\"\n\n—José M. Romero\n\nEduardo Rodriguez, Merrill Kelly look sharp in sim games\n\nLeft-hander Eduardo Rodriguez and right-hander Merrill Kelly each turned in crisp outings at Salt River Fields on Wednesday morning as they each near returns to the majors following lengthy injury absences.\n\nRodriguez is the closer of the two. He threw four innings and 57 pitches, and said he felt prepared to make his long-awaited season debut but was waiting to hear from the organization on what the next step would be.\n\nAs for Kelly, he threw three innings and 51 pitches and said his next outing will come on a rehab assignment at High-A Hillsboro on Tuesday. He said he has begun to feel more like his old self over the past week or so, getting his timing down in his mechanics while his shoulder has continued to feel stronger.\n\nRodriguez, who signed a four-year, $80 million deal with the Diamondbacks as a free agent in December, went down with an issue behind his shoulder in spring training. He suffered a setback a month later and has been brought along slowly since. He lines up to pitch next week in Cleveland, where the Diamondbacks will face the Guardians after a three-game set in Pittsburgh over the weekend.\n\n“I feel good to go,” he said. “I’m just waiting to talk to them and see what the decision will be. I’ll do whatever they want. That’s what they signed me here for. If they want me in Cleveland, that’s where I’ll be. If they want me to throw another one (rehab start), I’ll throw it. It just depends. I have to have that conversation with them and see what they think.”\n\nKelly, who made four starts before going down with a teres major strain in his right shoulder in April, hopes he can return after next week's rehab start.\n\n“Today was obviously good getting those three ups (innings),” Kelly said. “We’ll try for four and 65 (pitches) or whatever it is on Tuesday. After that, I’m not sure what the exact plan is, but hopefully within that next week, I would imagine. If everything goes well — I’ve got to jump through those hoops and go step by step — but hopefully I’ll be back soon after that.”\n\n—Nick Piecoro\n\nNew Diamondback Dylan Floro settles in to new digs\n\nDylan Floro could have pitched Tuesday night if needed, even though he'd changed teams only hours before game time.\n\nThe new Arizona Diamondbacks reliever was with the Washington Nationals Tuesday before he arrived at the visiting clubhouse at Chase Field. That's where he found out he was traded to the Diamondbacks, and so began the physical and mental process of packing up, walking a few steps down the hallway to the home clubhouse, and getting settled with his new team.\n\n\"Definitely a little weird,\" Floro said. \"Two days ago I was sitting over there in that (visiting) bullpen and (Tuesday) night I was sitting over in this bullpen on this side. It was definitely a funny feeling at first, but starting to meet some of the guys, starting to get to know some people around here.\n\n\"It's exciting to join a team that's going for the playoffs. I got to experience that for a few years when I played for the Dodgers.\"\n\nFloro was also traded at the deadline last year from the Miami Marlins to the Minnesota Twins.\n\nDiamondbacks manager Torey Lovullo said he intends to use Floro in the late innings out of the bullpen, much like he does another new arrival, A.J. Puk.\n\nThe other deadline deal the Diamondbacks made brought infielder Josh Bell from the Marlins. Bell will join the Diamondbacks when they get to Pittsburgh for the start of their next series, Lovullo said.\n\n—Jose Romero\n\nFriday's Diamondbacks-Pirates pitching matchup\n\nDiamondbacks at Pirates, 3:40 p.m., Cox, Ch. 34\n\nDiamondbacks RHP Brandon Pfaadt (5-6, 3.92) vs. Pirates RHP Luis Ortiz (5-2, 2.75).\n\nAt PNC Park: Pfaadt is 2-0 over his last three starts, including a win over the Pirates on July 27 in Phoenix. He allowed five earned runs on seven hits in six innings, striking out four with no walks. Pfaadt had two strong starts before that, with a combined 13 innings of scoreless ball on four hits allowed. He got a win over the Atlanta Braves on July 11 and a no-decision against the Chicago Cubs on July 21. Ortiz gave up three runs on five hits in his start against the Diamondbacks on July 26, in a no-decision. He's proven to be one of the promising young arms for a Pirates team that is in contention for a postseason spot.\n\nComing up\n\nThursday: Off.\n\nFriday: At Pittsburgh, 3:40 p.m., Diamondbacks RHP Brandon Pfaadt (5-6, 3.92) vs. Pirates RHP Luis Ortiz (5-2, 2.75).\n\nSaturday: At Pittsburgh, 3:40 p.m., Diamondbacks LHP Jordan Montgomery (7-5, 6.51) vs. Pirates LHP Marco Gonzales (1-1, 3.72)."
