After six outings this spring, he owns a 0.94 WHIP with 10 strikeouts through 5.1 innings, but his back tightness must be monitored moving forward.\n\nMarch 17, 2024\n\nWashington Nationals – It’s not considered serious, but manager Davey Martinez mentioned Kyle Finnegan has been dealing with a “stiff back” and will receive a bit more rest, then pitch on Wednesday (March 20) per Mark Zuckerman’s post on MASN. He last appeared on March 12, retiring both batters faced via strikeout.\n\nMarch 2, 2024\n\nWashington Nationals – With his manager’s backing, Kyle Finnegan will open the season as the primary save option. He’s also working on a new pitch (it’s a sweeper), covered by Mark Zuckerman of MASN.\n\nMarch 1, 2024\n\nWashington Nationals – It’s roster projection season, and Jessie Camerato of MLB.com provided her take on the Nationals bullpen. She did not name a closer, but it’s been reported by other sources Kyle Finnegan will begin the year as the primary save source.\n\nSeptember 14, 2023\n\nWashington Nationals — Mason Thompson was optioned to Rochester on Wednesday, reopening the seventh inning for Jordan Weems.\n\nUpdated hierarchy: Finnegan | Harvey | Weems.\n\nAugust 26, 2023\n\nWashington Nationals — Kyle Finnegan got the day off after pitching in two of three, including a 31 pitch save on Thursday.

Manager Davey Martinez said that Kyle Finnegan will remain as the team’s closer while Harvey slots into a setup role.\n\nUpdated hierarchy: Finnegan | Harvey | Weems.\n\nAugust 6, 2023\n\nWashington Nationals – Mason Thompson has been placed on the IL. Andres Machado should see more time in the later innings while Thompson is out.\n\nUpdated hierarchy: Finnegan | Weems | Machado.\n\nJuly 18, 2023\n\nWashington Nationals – Kyle Finnegan did indeed get the first save opportunity following Hunter Harvey’s injury. It was his 12th of the year. Also as expected, Mason Thompson bridged the gap to Finnegan.\n\nHierarchy remains: Finnegan | Thompson | Weems.\n\nJuly 17, 2023\n\nWashington Nationals — As we alerted you Sunday night, Hunter Harvey has a sore right triceps and is very likely to be placed on the IL today. This opens up the door for Kyle Finnegan to resume the closer role, and probably eliminates any chance that the oft-injured Harvey is traded this season.\n\nUpdated hierarchy: Finnegan | Thompson | Weems.\n\nJuly 16, 2023\n\nWashington Nationals – Hunter Harvey appears to be headed to the IL with a sore arm, as Davey Martinz said he’d prefer to be cautious with him. Kyle Finnegan returns to the closer’s role and expect Mason and Jordan Weems to be the top choices for holds.\n\nUpdated hierarchy: Finnegan | Thompson | Weems.\n\nJuly 3, 2023\n\nWashington Nationals – Hunter Harvey picked up his 8th save on Sunday; as promised, we’re kicking his asterisk.\n\nUpdated hierarchy: Harvey | Finnegan | Thompson.\n\nJune 29, 2023\n\nWashington Nationals — Yet another save for Hunter Harvey, who certainly seems to have the inside track on the Nationals’ ninth. We’ll pull the asterisk sooner than later if current trends hold.\n\nHierarchy remains: *Harvey | Finnegan | Thompson.\n\n* = closer-by-committee\n\nJune 25, 2023\n\nWashington Nationals — Hunter Harvey pitched a scoreless 9th inning for his 5th save of the season while Kyle Finnegan pitched the 8th ahead of him. Harvey has recorded three of the last four saves for the Nationals. Meanwhile, Kyle Finnegan has not recorded a save since May 25th. We will move Harvey to the head of this committee and see if Finnegan will remain in the mix or if Harvey takes the job by himself moving forward.\n\nUpdated hierarchy: *Harvey | Finnegan | Thompson.\n\n* = closer-by-committee\n\nJune 22, 2023\n\nWashington Nationals — Carl Edwards Jr. headed to the injured list with shoulder inflammation, moving Mason Thompson into the Nationals’ hierarchy.\n\nUpdated hierarchy: *Finnegan | Harvey | Thompson.\n\n* = closer-by-committee\n\nJune 16, 2023\n\nWashington Nationals — Given a 1-0 lead Thursday, Hunter Harvey blew the save, but if you played him in your lineup, you were fortunate he earned the win. Washington took the lead in the top of the tenth, giving space for Carl Edwards Jr. to record three outs for his second save. Kyle Finnegan pitched the eighth inning, allowing one hit but striking out three against the Astros 8-9-1-2 hitters. This is a messy situation, and given Harvey’s blown save, we’ll leave the committee as is for now.\n\nHierarchy remains: *Finnegan | Harvey | Edwards.\n\n* = closer-by-committee\n\nJune 1, 2023\n\nWashington Nationals — Washington just won’t commit to a traditional reliever setup, using putative closer Kyle Finnegan to start the seventh on Wednesday night. He surrendered the lead, but was staked to a three-run advantage entering the eighth — where he gave up a leadoff home run. Enter Hunter Harvey, who pitched two scoreless innings to earn the save.\n\nHierarchy remains: *Finnegan | Harvey | Edwards.\n\n* = closer-by-committee\n\nMay 28, 2023\n\nWashington Nationals – The Nationals used their hierarchy in order last night with Carl Edwards pitching a scoreless 7th, Hunter Harvey a scoreless 8th, and Kyle Finnegan a scoreless 9th for his 11th save of the season. Finnegan has been up and down this season but still has produced double digit saves already and should continue to be the best bet for the save on any given night.\n\nHierarchy remains: *Finnegan | Harvey | Edwards.\n\n* = closer-by-committee\n\nMay 27, 2023\n\nWashington Nationals – The Vulture Save Watch told you that Kyle Finnegan and Hunter Harvey would be getting a rest on Friday, but when Carl Edwards was called upon to put out a fire in the 7th inning and when he loaded the bases in the 8th inning the Nationals turned to Chad Kuhl to protect their lead. He allowed 2 inherited runners to score, but pitched a clean 9th inning for the first save of his career. Kuhl began the season as a starter, but after struggling in that role he moved to the bullpen. He has yet to give up a run of his own in that role, although it has only been 2 appearances.\n\nHierarchy remains: *Finnegan | Harvey | Edwards.\n\n* = closer-by-committee\n\nMay 26, 2023\n\nWashington Nationals – Kyle Finnegan pitched a clean eighth inning Thursday, leading to a save situation for Hunter Harvey, who allowed three runs on three hits to take the blown save and loss. He had been pitching well lately, but the bad outing brings his ERA up to 3.86. Finnegan (4.50 ERA) lives another day atop this committee.\n\nHierarchy remains: *Finnegan | Harvey | Edwards.\n\n* = closer-by-committee\n\nMay 22, 2023\n\nWashington Nationals – Would-be closer Kyle Finnegan came on in a tight spot in the 6th and registered five outs before giving way to Carl Edwards Jr. and then Hunter Harvey, the latter of whom picked up his second save of the season. Finnegan’s shaky start (5.00 ERA, 1.72 WHIP) coupled with this unorthodox usage means we’re in committee mode until further notice.\n\nUpdated hierarchy: *Finnegan | Harvey | Edwards.\n\n* = closer-by-committee\n\nMay 8, 2023\n\nWashington Nationals – Hunter Harvey got the save chance after the Nationals rallied to take the lead in the top of the 9th, and the righty converted for his first save of the season. We’ll shuffle him up to handcuff status as a reward.\n\nUpdated hierarchy: Finnegan | Harvey | Edwards.\n\nMay 1, 2023\n\nWashington Nationals – It wasn’t a save chance, but another successful 9th inning for Kyle Finnegan means he’s kicked his asterisk.\n\nUpdated hierarchy: Finnegan | Edwards | Harvey.\n\nApril 26, 2023\n\nWashington Nationals – Mason Thompson pitched the final three innings of a 5-0 win over the Mets on Tuesday to collect the save.\n\nHierarchy Remains: *Finnegan | Edwards | Harvey.\n\n* = closer-by-committee\n\nApril 9, 2023\n\nWashington Nationals – After a disatrous 9th inning on Tuesday, Kyle Finnegan has bounced back with two scoreless outings. However, both of those were in non-save situations and after Anthony Banda turned a 7-2 Nationals 9th inning lead quickly to a 7-4 Nationals lead, it was Carl Edwards who came on for the save chance. Edwards allowed a pair of hits and a pair of runs (one charged to Banda), but was able to close out the game for his first save of the season. We aren’t ready to move Edwards to the top of the hiearchy but he is certainly in the mix for saves and will likely move to the top if he gets the next save chance.\n\nHierarchy Remains: *Finnegan | Edwards | Harvey.\n\n* = closer-by-committee\n\nApril 5, 2023\n\nWashington Nationals – Washington’s held a 1 run lead going into the 9th inning, and turned to closer/fireman Kyle Finnegan. Finnegan misunderstood the assignment, and started the fires instead of putting them out. He gave up back to back homers to blow the save, and then end up in line for the loss. 4 batters (and one pickoff) later, a 3 run shot pushed the lead to 4 runs. Finnegan was pulled after that, for a final line of 0.1 innings, 5 H, 5 ER, 3 HR surrendered. After the game, Davey Martinez referred to Finnegan as “our closer” and said they “need to get him right, right?” Based on those comments, we’ll leave the hierarchy in place for now, but it might be time to buy a little insurance in the form of Carl Edwards, who has come out of the gate strong.\n\nHierarchy Remains: *Finnegan | Edwards | Harvey.\n\n* = closer-by-committee\n\nApril 3, 2023\n\nWashington Nationals – Washington’s first win was closed out by Kyle Finnegan, and while Davey Martinez said that Finnegan would sometimes be used as a fireman, Sunday’s usage gave good insight into the pecking order when the bullpen is deployed traditionally. Hunter Harvey got out of a tight spot in the 6th inning, and after a clean 7th by Erasmo Ramirez, Carl Edwards Jr. got the 8th. Given that Harvey’s spot was higher-leverage than Ramirez’s, we’ll sort the hierarchy accordingly.\n\nUpdated hierarchy: *Finnegan | Edwards | Harvey.\n\n* = closer-by-committee\n\nMarch 16, 2023\n\nWashington Nationals – Kyle Finnegan is the guy this year in Washington… except that Davey Martinez has already told him that sometimes he’ll be used as a fireman rather than traditional closer. So while he’s definitely the best National reliever to own, that could mean a handful of save chances for Hunter Harvey, CJ Edwards, and perhaps even Sean Doolittle. We’ll keep an eye on this early on to see if Martinez keeps his word, or whether he just defaults to Finnegan as his regular 9th inning guy.\n\nStarting 2023 hierarchy: *Finnegan | Harvey | Edwards.\n\n* = closer-by-committee\n\nHolds candidates: Harvey, Edwards, Doolittle.\n\nSeptember 22, 2022\n\nWashington Nationals — After a few weeks where Washington played matchups, Kyle Finnegan seems to have fully regained the ninth, allowing us to banish the asterisk from the Nationals’ pen.\n\nUpdated hierarchy: Finnegan | Edwards | Harvey.\n\nSeptember 18, 2022\n\nWashington Nationals – Kyle Finnegan struck out the side yesterday to record his second straight save. After a rough little stretch that made it look like Finnegan was losing his grip on the closer’s job, he has bounced back and looks like the primary ninth inning guy in Washington again.\n\nHierarchy remains: *Finnegan | Edwards | Harvey.\n\n* = closer-by-committee\n\nSeptember 12, 2022\n\nWashington Nationals – Kyle Finnegan’s usage hasn’t resembled anything close to “closer” lately, and that trend continued last night, when he was sent out for the bottom of the 7th inning in a tie game, whereupon he promptly gave up a hit, then a homer, and took the loss. We’re putting a committee tag on here and wouldn’t be surprised if Carl Edwards Jr. got the next save chance.\n\nUpdated hierarchy: *Finnegan | Edwards | Harvey.\n\n* = closer-by-committee\n\nSeptember 9, 2022\n\nWashington Nationals — After a rough outing Wednesday, Kyle Finnegan was called into Thursday’s game in the eighth inning to face the 7-8-9 hitters with a three-run lead. He retired the side to earn a hold, and the game got out of reach in the ninth so no save was to be had. The usage is notable because it wasn’t the ninth inning, and while the game was within three runs, the bases were empty when he entered and he was tasked with taking care of the bottom of the order, so not exactly the game’s tightest spot. He’s the top guy, but there some days when he won’t pitch the ninth. We’ll monitor his usage the next several days to see if an asterisk is needed for this hierarchy.\n\nHierarchy remains: Finnegan | Edwards | Harvey.\n\nSeptember 8, 2022\n\nWashington Nationals — You always remember the non-save closer outings that end poorly, and last night was one of those for Kyle Finnegan. Called on with a five-run lead because he hadn’t pitched in six days, Finnegan surrendered two walks, two singles, and two doubles in a combination that left him walking off the mound with the loss. Dave Martinez probably should have turned to John Daly.\n\nHierarchy remains: Finnegan | Edwards | Harvey.\n\nSeptember 6, 2022\n\nWashington Nationals – Mason Thompson pitched the last three innings of a six-run Washington victory on Monday, earning his first career save.\n\nHierarchy remains: Finnegan | Edwards | Harvey.\n\nAugust 19, 2022\n\nWashington Nationals — Carl Edwards Jr. tossed a clean eighth inning Thursday ahead of Kyle Finnegan, who pitched a clean ninth inning to earn his sixth save. There is some evidence that manager Dave Martinez will play the matchups with these two, but they don’t win often enough for us to get a clear read on the situation yet, so given Thursday’s result we’ll continue to leave Finnegan up top.\n\nHierarchy remains: Finnegan | Edwards | Harvey.\n\nAugust 14, 2022\n\nWashington Nationals — After the Nationals tied the game in the bottom of the 6th inning, manager Davey Martinez called on Kyle Finnegan to pitch the 7th against the 3-4-5 hitters in the Padres’ lineup. Finnegan ended up with the win after the Nationals took the lead and Carl Edwards Jr. handled the 9th for his second save. This is the second straight win where Finnegan was used before the 9th inning in a big spot and Edwards got the save. The Nationals don’t win often enough for us to get a good read on the bullpen but we will lead Finnegan at the top right now and see how Martinez continues to deploy Finnegan and Edwards.\n\nHierarchy remains: Finnegan | Edwards | Harvey.\n\nAugust 10, 2022\n\nWashington Nationals — Davey Martinez needed to use Kyle Finnegan in the seventh inning to try and protect a two-run lead with two on and nobody out. While Finnegan did give up the lead, he earned the win when Washington regained its advantage and Carl Edwards Jr. closed the door in the ninth for his first save of the season.\n\nHierarchy remains: Finnegan | Edwards | Harvey.\n\nJuly 27, 2022\n\nWashington Nationals — After recording a seventh-inning hold on Monday, Hunter Harvey pitched a scoreless ninth on Tuesday to close out an 8-3 win. It’s worth noting that Harvey was warming up when the Nationals’ lead was just 5-3, which means he was in line for a vulture save with Kyle Finnegan and Carl Edwards Jr. unavailable.\n\nUpdated hierarchy: Finnegan | Edwards | Harvey.\n\nJuly 15, 2022\n\nWashington Nationals — Manager Davey Martinez said Thursday that Kyle Finnegan is going to be “the guy” with Tanner Rainey on the 60-day IL. He adds that if Finnegan is unavailable, Carl Edwards Jr., Steve Cishek and Jordan Weems are all candidates for save chances.\n\nUpdated hierarchy: Finnegan | Edwards | Cishek.\n\nJuly 14, 2022\n\nWashington Nationals — As we noted last night, Tanner Rainey is out for at least two months with a sprained UCL, and we expect Kyle Finnegan and Carl Edwards Jr. to split save chances in his absence.\n\nUpdated hierarchy: *Finnegan | Edwards | Cishek.\n\n* = closer-by-committee\n\nJuly 13, 2022\n\nWashington Nationals — Prior to Wednesday’s doubleheader, Tanner Rainey was suddenly placed on the 60-day IL with a sprained UCL. Tyler Clippard joined the club as a result, but we think Kyle Finnegan and Carl Edwards Jr. have the best shot at save chances, with Steve Cishek and Andres Machado a little further down the list.\n\nUpdated hierarchy: *Finnegan | Edwards | Cishek.\n\n* = closer-by-committee\n\nJune 28, 2022\n\nWashington Nationals – Kyle Finnegan was already “hot” in the bullpen and was ready to go in for the top of the 9th in a game the Nationals were initially down 2-1. When they rallied to take the lead, Davey Martinez stuck with his set-up man, knowing he’d be down Tuesday either way, having already gotten loose. The result was Finnegan’s first save of the season.\n\nHierarchy remains: Rainey | Finnegan | Edwards.\n\nJune 22, 2022\n\nWashington Nationals – Since he vultured a save on June 6, Steve Cishek has just one hold, and that came on June 10. Carl Edwards Jr., meanwhile, hasn’t allowed a hit over his last four appearances, picking up a pair of holds in the process. That includes a scoreless eighth inning in Tuesday’s 3-0 win.\n\nUpdated hierarchy: Rainey | Finnegan | Edwards Jr.\n\nJune 6, 2022\n\nWashington Nationals – With Tanner Rainey and Kyle Finnegan both getting Sunday off, the Nats turned to veteran Steve Cishek for the save chance. Cishek converted for his first save of the season.\n\nUpdated hierarchy: Rainey | Finnegan | Cishek.\n\nMay 19, 2022\n\nWashington Nationals — Kyle Finnegan pitched a clean eighth, but after Tanner Rainey blew the save with a run in the ninth, Victor Arano converted the extra-inning save, his first as a National.\n\nHierarchy remains: Rainey | Finnegan | Arano.\n\nApril 21, 2022\n\nWashington Nationals — Sean Doolittle’s strong season — powered by a new breaking ball — has been interrupted by an elbow sprain that might keep him out for an extended period of time. Taking his place in the seventh inning will be Victor Arano, who has outpitched veteran Steve Cishek thus far.\n\nUpdated hierarchy: Rainey | Finnegan | Arano.\n\nApril 20, 2022\n\nWashington Nationals – Tanner Rainey has three straight saves for the Nationals, which means we’re saying goodbye to the asterisk.\n\nUpdated hierarchy: Rainey | Finnegan | Doolittle.\n\nApril 11, 2022\n\nWashington Nationals – Kyle Finnegan finished last year as the Washington closer, but the hard-throwing righty was used in the 8th inning, with the Nats behind by a run. When they rallied in the bottom half, he earned the win, while Tanner Rainey picked up the team’s first save. With little to go on in the postgame, we’ll slap a committee tag on here for now and see if Rainey is the guy to own going forward.\n\nUpdated hierarchy: *Rainey | Finnegan | Doolittle.\n\n* = closer-by-committee\n\nMarch 24, 2022\n\nWashington Nationals – It’s not certain that Kyle Finnegan starts out as the Washington closer, but he’s the best bet, having finished 2021 with the job. Veterans Will Harris and Sean Doolittle figure to help bridge the gap along with Tanner Rainey, who has flashed at times in his young career.\n\nStarting 2022 hierarchy: Finnegan | Rainey | Harris.\n\nHolds candidates: Rainey | Harris | Doolittle.\n\nSeptember 28, 2021\n\nWashington Nationals – Tanner Rainey has looked significantly better since his return from AAA, and last night, the Nats rewarded him with a save chance. He retired the first two hitters before surrendering a walk and a double, but still got the job done, earning his third save of the year. We’re going to put a committee tag on here as it now seems to reason that Rainey and Kyle Finnegan (who pitched the 8th) are sharing the job.\n\nUpdated hierarchy: *Finnegan | Rainey | Machado.\n\n* = closer-by-committee\n\nSeptember 24, 2021\n\nWashington Nationals — The Nationals went to Kyle Finnegan to close out Thursday’s win and he converted his 11th save of the season. Tanner Rainey, who snagged an unlikely save yesterday, walked one but struck out two in a relatively clean eighth inning to set up Finnegan.\n\nHierarchy remains: Finnegan | Machado | Rainey.\n\nSeptember 23, 2021\n\nWashington Nationals — When Ryne Harper couldn’t set down the Marlins with a five-run lead in the ninth, Washington called on Tanner Rainey, who grabbed his second save of the year. Kyle Finnegan has struggled lately, blowing two straight saves last week, and Rainey — who was just called up from Rochester this weekend — has an outside shot at some more chances down the stretch.\n\nUpdated hierarchy: Finnegan | Machado | Rainey.\n\nSeptember 4, 2021\n\nWashington Nationals — Kyle Finnegan has been activated from the paternity list, and should step right back into role as closer.\n\nHierarchy remains: Finnegan | Machado | Voth.\n\nSeptember 1, 2021\n\nWashington Nationals — Kyle Finnegan was placed on the paternity list on Tuesday. It was not a good night for the remainder of the Nats’ bullpen, as Andres Machado was rocked in the sixth inning to blow a lead before Wander Suero, who was recalled from Triple-A earlier in the day, had this nightmare of a ninth inning.\n\nHierarchy remains: *Finnegan | Machado | Voth.\n\n* = closer-by-committee\n\nAugust 25, 2021\n\nWashington Nationals — The Nationals optioned Gabe Klobosits to Triple-A Rochester. Welcome back to the hierarchy, Austin Voth.\n\nUpdated hierarchy *Finnegan | Machado | Voth.\n\n* = closer-by-committee\n\nAugust 21, 2021\n\nWashington Nationals — Kyle Finnegan earned another save last night, but it was Andres Machado pitching the eighth inning ahead of him. Machado now has two eighth inning holds in his last two appearances, which is enough to move him onto the hierarchy. With Finnegan needing a rest sometime this weekend, we could see Machado in another high-leverage spot soon.\n\nUpdated hierarchy *Finnegan | Klobosits | Machado.\n\n* = closer-by-committee\n\nAugust 4, 2021\n\nWashington Nationals — Being a Nationals reliever is tough. Not only does your team stink, but if you struggle to succeed in high-leverage spots, you get sent to the minors. That’s exactly what happened to Wander Suero, as he joined teammate Tanner Rainey in Triple-A Rochester.\n\nUpdated hierarchy *Finnegan | Klobosits | Harper.\n\n* = closer-by-committee\n\nAugust 2, 2021\n\nWashington Nationals – Tanner Rainey was sent to AAA to try and get back on track. Rookie Gabe Klobosits, a 6’7″ righty who has two holds in his first two major league appearances, slides into this hierarchy.\n\nUpdated hierarchy: Finnegan | Suero | Klobosits.\n\nJuly 31, 2021\n\nWashington Nationals — In addition to Brad Hand, the Nationals shipped out Daniel Hudson, who is currently on the COVID IL. This is mostly news for anyone who was hoping that Hudson would fill the void left by Hand, as it doesn’t seem likely that Hudson will be closing for the Padres.\n\nHierarchy remains: *Finnegan | Rainey | Suero.\n\n* = closer-by-committee\n\nJuly 30, 2021\n\nWashington Nationals — The Nationals set fire to their 2019 championship core on Thursday, dealing away megastars Max Scherzer and Trea Turner. They also gutted the bullpen, trading Brad Hand to the Blue Jays and Daniel Hudson (who is on the COVID-19 IL) to the Padres. Kyle Finnegan picked up a save in game one of a doubleheader on Thursday, while in game two, Wander Suero and Tanner Rainey did not pitch well, combining for 3 ER over two innings. Now that the dust has settled, we’ll keep the hierarchy the way things worked Thursday, with Finnegan leading the way.\n\nUpdated hierarchy: *Finnegan | Rainey | Suero.\n\n* = closer-by-committee\n\nJuly 29, 2021\n\nWashington Nationals — The Nationals dealt Brad Hand to the Blue Jays. With Daniel Hudson and Austin Voth on the COVID-IL, Kyle Finnegan and the just-activated Tanner Rainey will lead this bullpen.\n\nUpdated hierarchy: *Finnegan | Rainey | Suero.\n\n* = closer-by-committee\n\nJuly 22, 2021\n\nWashington Nationals — Daniel Hudson has moved into an eighth-inning setup role for Washington, with Kyle Finnegan preceding him most frequently.\n\nUpdated hierarchy: Hand | Hudson | Finnegan.\n\nJuly 8, 2021\n\nWashington Nationals — Daniel Hudson has been activated from the injured list and will immediately bolster Washington’s late-inning lineup.\n\nUpdated hierarchy: Hand | Voth | Hudson.\n\nJune 30, 2021\n\nWashington Nationals — Tanner Rainey became the latest Nationals reliever to hit the IL on Tuesday thanks to a stress reaction to his right tibia. Austin Voth protected a two-run lead last night with a perfect eighth inning against Tampa’s 4-5-6 hitters and will join Wander Suero as the late-inning options that need to get the ball to an overworked Brad Hand. In other news, Daniel Hudson might throw a bullpen today, and boy do the Nationals need that to go well.\n\nUpdated hierarchy: Hand | Voth | Suero.\n\nJune 25, 2021\n\nWashington Nationals — Daniel Hudson threw off flat ground on Thursday, but it’s not known when he’ll be back. No timetable has been given for a return.\n\nHierarchy remains: Hand | Rainey | Suero.\n\nJune 24, 2021\n\nWashington Nationals — Kyle Finnegan hit the IL with a strained hamstring right when we were thinking he might get a vulture save shot. Instead, after Austin Voth and Tanner Rainey blew the lead in the eighth (and Hector Neris handed it right back in the top of the ninth), the Nats called on Paolo Espino to lock down the ninth. Espino came through for his first career save, but expect Rainey and Wander Suero to fill out the hierarchy for now.\n\nUpdated hierarchy: Hand | Rainey | Suero.\n\nJune 20, 2021\n\nWashington Nationals — Fantasy owners can thank Wander Suero for gifting Brad Hand an easy save yesterday. With the Nationals up by four in the last inning of the second game of the doubleheader, Suero put a couple runners on with two outs, and that allowed Hand to come in and retire one batter for the save. About a month ago it looked like Hand might be losing his grip on the closer’s role in Washington but he has now converted eleven straight save opportunities.\n\nHierarchy remains: Hand | Finnegan | Rainey.\n\nJune 13, 2021\n\nWashington Nationals — The Nationals placed Daniel Hudson on the IL with elbow inflammation. Manager Davey Martinez mentioned Kyle Finnegan, Tanner Rainey, and Wander Suero as candidates to receive more high leverage spots while Hudson is out. Finnegan recorded the 6th inning hold (it was a doubleheader so the equivalent of an 8th inning hold) ahead of closer Brad Hand in game 1 yesterday so we will slide him into Hudson’s spot as 1st in line. Tanner Rainer has a modest three-game scoreless streak, including an extra-innings save and the 6th inning of a tie game ahead of closer Brad Hand, so we will slide him to 2nd in line despite his high ERA.\n\nUpdated hierarchy: Hand | Finnegan | Rainey.\n\nJune 10, 2021\n\nWashington Nationals — Wander Suero has been pitching in the third and fourth innings lately, and last night, Kyle Finnegan got the call in the sixth inning with a two-run lead. We like Finnegan for second in line over Suero and Tanner Rainey, whose 9.35 ERA outweighs last night’s 11th-inning save. Of greater ultimate concern to Nationals fans coming out of Wednesday’s game will be Brad Hand’s 44-pitch blown save.\n\nUpdated hierarchy: Hand | Hudson | Finnegan.\n\nMay 28, 2021\n\nWashington Nationals — The Nationals activated Tanner Rainey ahead of yesterday’s doubleheader and immediately threw him into the resumed game with a five-run lead in the eighth inning. He gave up three singles and got pulled without retiring a batter, eventually getting charged with all three runs when they came around to score off of Daniel Hudson. Rainey was expected to be a big part of the Nationals’ bullpen this year but has yet to really find his footing, sitting on a 9.49 ERA. The good news for Washington is Brad Hand pitched a clean ninth for his eighth save of the year and now has a modest three-game scoreless streak going.\n\nHierarchy remains: Hand | Hudson | Suero.\n\nMay 26, 2021\n\nWashington Nationals — With Will Harris on the IL, Wander Suero has seen more high-leverage work, picking up a pair of holds this past weekend.\n\nUpdated hierarchy: Hand | Hudson | Suero.\n\nMay 23, 2021\n\nWashington Nationals — Brad Hand bounced back with a perfect 9th inning to record his 6th save of the season. Daniel Hudson earned his 3rd win of the season with a scoreless 8th and now has a stellar 1.13 ERA and 0.69 WHIP for the season. The Nationals will hope that Hand can settle back in and start pitching like he did for the first month of the season, but considering how well Hudson is pitching, the situation is still worth monitoring.\n\nHierarchy remains: Hand | Hudson | Harris.\n\nMay 22, 2021\n\nWashington Nationals — With the Nationals holding a four-run lead in the ninth inning they turned the ball over to Brad Hand in a non-save situation. He gave up two runs but managed to finish the game. Hand has struggled recently, giving up runs in five of his last six appearances. Daniel Hudson, who pitched a clean eighth ahead of him yesterday, has yet to give up a run in May. Because it wasn’t a save situation and because Hand did finish the game, we aren’t ready to remove him from the closer spot just yet, but Hudson makes for a good speculative add in case Hand’s struggles continue.\n\nHierarchy remains: Hand | Hudson | Harris.\n\nMay 13, 2021\n\nWashington Nationals — A week ago, Brad Hand was humming along — 0 runs, 4 hits, 3 saves, and 9 Ks over 8.1 innings. But over his last three appearances, Hand has picked up two blown saves, two losses, and a very hot seat. Daniel Hudson wasn’t great as the closer last season, but he’s been effective in setup this year, and he’s most likely to inherit the job if Hand needs a break. Speculators take note.\n\nHierarchy remains: Hand | Hudson | Harris.\n\nMay 5, 2021\n\nWashington Nationals – Will Harris made his 2021 debut on Tuesday after beginning the season on the IL, striking out two in a scoreless eighth inning of a Nationals loss. We expect to see Harris eventually pitch in high-leverage situations, so we’ll move him into Tanner Rainey’s spot in the hierarchy, especially after Rainey gave up a grand slam to the Braves’ starting pitcher last night that pushed his ERA to 10.00 for the season.\n\nUpdated hierarchy: Hand | Hudson | Harris.\n\nApril 10, 2021\n\nWashington Nationals – The Nationals activated Brad Hand from the COVID list, and it’s safe to assume he will resume closing duties as nobody else converted a save while he was out.\n\nUpdated hierarchy: Hand | Hudson | Rainey.\n\nApril 7, 2021\n\nWashington Nationals – With closer Brad Hand not be on the opening day roster due to the COVID outbreak on the Nationals, the team will likely turn to a committee, with Daniel Hudson and Tanner Rainey being the two most likely to get save chances while Hand is out. Hudson did indeed pitch the ninth inning of a tie game that the Nationals won in the bottom half of the frame.\n\nUpdated hierarchy: *Hudson | Rainey | Suero.\n\n* = closer-by-committee\n\nApril 6, 2021\n\nWashington Nationals – Closer Brad Hand will not be on the opening day roster due to the COVID outbreak on the Nationals. The team will likely turn to a committee, with Daniel Hudson and Tanner Rainey being the two most likely to get save chances while Hand is out.\n\nUpdated hierarchy: *Hudson | Rainey | Suero.\n\n* = closer-by-committee\n\nMarch 5, 2021\n\nWashington Nationals – After all 29 teams passed on his $10 million contract in October, Brad Hand signed with the Nationals… for $10.5 million. He will start the season as closer, with Daniel Hudson setting up. Tanner Rainey still has real promise and should factor in to the late innings, while a hodgepodge of veterans round out the Washington bullpen.\n\nStarting 2021 hierarchy: Hand | Hudson | Rainey.\n\nHolds candidates: Hudson, Rainey, Will Harris, Jeremy Jeffress.\n\nSeptember 27, 2020\n\nWashington Nationals – The Nationals swept the Mets in their doubleheader yesterday with Will Harris and Daniel Hudson each recording a save.\n\nHierarchy remains: Hudson | Harris | Suero.\n\nSeptember 17, 2020\n\nWashington Nationals – After Daniel Hudson couldn’t hold a 1 run lead in the 9th, the save chance in extra innings fell to Kyle McGowin. McGowin converted the save in style, striking out the side on 17 pitches. McGowin has yet to give up a run over 5 appearances this year, but Washington had already used their whole hierarchy by the time McGowin got into the game, so we will keep things as they are for now.\n\nHierarchy remains: Hudson | Harris | Suero.\n\nSeptember 16, 2020\n\nWashington Nationals – Tanner Rainey landed on the 10-day IL with a right flexor strain, and it’s hard to imagine the Nationals will let him pitch again this season.\n\nUpdated hierarchy: Hudson | Harris | Suero.\n\nAugust 19, 2020\n\nWashington Nationals – The Nationals wasted no time going back to their closer after an ugly blown save. Daniel Hudson bounced back from Monday’s meltdown with two strikeouts as part of a 1-2-3 ninth inning in Tuesday’s 8-5 win.\n\nHierarchy remains: Hudson | Rainey | Harris.\n\nAugust 18, 2020\n\nWashington Nationals – A full fledged meltdown from Daniel Hudson — his second blown-save-loss outing in his last four — has us continuing to stare at the numbers Tanner Rainey is posting thus far. If you have room for a speculative add, consider the young fireballer; in medium-sized leagues, he’s likely good enough to help you even as a middle reliever.\n\nHierarchy remains: Hudson | Rainey | Harris.\n\nAugust 14, 2020\n\nWashington Nationals – Sean Doolittle was placed on the injured list with right knee fatigue. Daniel Hudson has grabbed the role as the team’s top save-getter these days, so the Nationals aren’t in a bind or anything. Plus, they’re getting additional reinforcements, as the team’s top add in the offseason, Will Harris, has been activated off the IL and should immediately compete for late-inning holds.\n\nUpdated hierarchy: Hudson | Rainey | Harris.\n\nAugust 12, 2020\n\nWashington Nationals – Tanner Rainey continued his terrific 2020 campaign on Tuesday with a perfect 1.2 innings of work to set up Daniel Hudson’s third save of the season. Rainey has allowed just one hit, a solo homer, all season.\n\nUpdated hierarchy: Hudson | Rainey | Guerra.\n\nAugust 5, 2020\n\nWashington Nationals – Daniel Hudson earned another save on Tuesday, with Javy Guerra picking up an eighth-inning hold after a 67-minute rain delay. Sean Doolittle, who spent the weekend working on his mechanics, had been warming up prior to the delay and would have pitched the eighth if the weather had cooperated.\n\nHierarchy remains: *Hudson | Doolittle | Rainey.\n\n* = closer-by-committee\n\nJuly 31, 2020\n\nWashington Nationals – Despite throwing 21 pitches over 1.2 innings Wednesday, Daniel Hudson was called on to save things for the Nationals Thursday night, even though Sean Doolittle was well-rested. Hudson converted for his first save. After the game, manager Dave Martinez told reporters Doolittle is working on his mechanics, and with the Nationals off this weekend, he will pitch in a simulated game on Saturday. We’ll slide Hudson to the top while Doolittle works things out.\n\nUpdated hierarchy: *Hudson | Doolittle | Rainey.\n\n* = closer-by-committee\n\nJuly 30, 2020\n\nWashington Nationals – Daniel Hudson continued his good form to begin the year, pitching the last two outs of the seventh and a clean eighth in a tie game, then picking up the win. Sean Doolittle needed rest, so his absence today wasn’t too suspicious, but his early usage hasn’t been what you’d expect from a closer, and Hudson is getting a lot of high-leverage work. Until Doolittle blows a save, it’s hard to move him from the top spot, but we repeat that now’s the time to grab Hudson. Meanwhile, Tanner Rainey struck out the side with a four-run lead, and seems to have Dave Martinez’s trust at the moment. We will slot him at second in line based on this usage.\n\nUpdated hierarchy: Doolittle | Hudson | Rainey.\n\nJuly 29, 2020\n\nWashington Nationals – Sean Doolittle hasn’t had the most promising start to the 2020 season. He got the final two outs of the seventh inning on Tuesday night to keep the Nationals within two runs, but his velocity continues to be an issue. If Daniel Hudson is available in your league, it may be worth adding him. Tanner Rainey is also someone to watch, as he has not allowed a hit in all three appearances, while Will Harris’ shaky start to 2020 continued on Tuesday.\n\nHierarchy remains: Doolittle | Hudson | Harris.\n\nFebruary 26, 2020\n\nWashington Nationals – The Nationals bullpen was largely terrible in 2019, but they patched their way through the playoffs and won a World Series. That success led them to probably be less aggressive than they could have been in free agency, as the only acquisition they made was former Astro Will Harris; instead, they’re hoping that Sean Doolittle and Daniel Hudson can tag-team the late innings the way they did in the playoffs last year. Tanner Rainey and Wander Suero are likely to make the roster, as will Hunter Strickland and Roenis Elias, but we’d only consider drafting the top three guys here, even in deep leagues.\n\nStarting 2020 Hierarchy: Doolittle | Hudson | Harris.\n\nHolds candidates: Hudson, Harris, Rainey.\n\nSeptember 27, 2019\n\nWashington Nationals – Score another one for the Vulture Save Watch. Daniel Hudson did the honors for the Nationals on Thursday as Sean Doolittle received a day off instead of going in three straight. Hudson converted his sixth save. We expect Doolittle to get any remaining opportunities this weekend, if he’s well-rested enough.\n\nHierarchy remains: *Doolittle | Hudson | Strickland.\n\n* = closer-by-committee\n\nSeptember 26, 2019\n\nWashington Nationals – Sean Doolittle earned the save on Wednesday, pitching 95 mph and getting several swinging strikes. We listed this as a vulture save yesterday, but Doolittle looked good enough that we think he has the best shot at another save this season.\n\nUpdated hierarchy: *Doolittle | Hudson | Strickland.\n\n* = closer-by-committee\n\nSeptember 25, 2019\n\nWashington Nationals – Daniel Hudson saved both games of the double-header yesterday. Sean Doolittle picked up a hold in game one by pitching a scoreless 8th inning. Hudson has six straight scoreless appearances, recording four saves during that time, but he still thinks they need Doolittle as their closer. The Nationals have clinched a playoff spot and we will see if that allows them to throw Doolittle into a save situation during the last week of the season.\n\nHierarchy remains: *Hudson | Doolittle | Strickland.\n\n* = closer-by-committee\n\nSeptember 24, 2019\n\nWashington Nationals – With a 4-run lead in the eighth inning, Sean Doolittle started warming. He sat back down when the Nats tacked on two insurance runs, but the lefty has been slowly building back up to become a late inning option again; it seems he’s reached the point where Washington is ready to trust him in key spots.\n\nUpdated hierarchy: *Hudson | Doolittle | Strickland.\n\n* = closer-by-committee\n\nSeptember 22, 2019\n\nWashington Nationals – After Fernando Rodney blew a 4-0 eighth-inning lead, current good person and former closer Sean Doolittle was finally in line for a save chance in the 10th inning, but the Nationals scored too many runs and took a 10-4 lead, which rendered Doolittle’s services unnecessary. There’s reason to think that Doolittle still isn’t right, but the Nationals may have to turn to him for some high-leverage spots in the final week as they look to clinch a wild card spot.\n\nHierarchy remains: *Hudson | Strickland | Rodney.\n\n* = closer-by-committee\n\nSeptember 5, 2019\n\nWashington Nationals – In his second appearance back from the injured list, Sean Doolittle allowed two baserunners but no runs in a scoreless ninth, down four runs. Doolittle will keep getting low-leverage work for the next few weeks as he gets back into shape.\n\nHierarchy remains: *Hudson | Strickland | Rodney.\n\n* = closer-by-committee\n\nAugust 31, 2019\n\nWashington Nationals – The Nationals activated both Hunter Strickland and Roenis Elias before last night’s game, and the duo immediately combined to blow a lead. Strickland entered the seventh inning with the Nationals up two but gave up a run and loaded the bases before giving way to Elias. Elias walked in an inherited runner before getting an inning-ending double play. Daniel Hudson also blew a save late, but got the win on an Anthony Rendon walk-off. The Nationals can’t wait for Sean Doolittle to get back, and he had a successful rehab outing, so his return may come sooner rather than later.\n\nHierarchy remains: *Hudson | Strickland | Rodney.\n\n* = closer-by-committee\n\nAugust 30, 2019\n\nWashington Nationals – Hunter Strickland should be activated from the paternity list on Friday. Meanwhile, Sean Doolittle is expected to make a rehab appearance Friday and if all goes well, he should return soon. The Nationals were also feeling positive about Roenis Elias’ progress and may activate him on Friday.\n\nHierarchy remains: *Hudson | Strickland | Rodney.\n\n* = closer-by-committee\n\nAugust 28, 2019\n\nWashington Nationals – Hunter Strickland flew home for the birth of his second child and is on the paternity list. He will return for the Nationals’ weekend series with the Marlins. Meanwhile, Sean Doolittle said he is progressing well and is hoping to be activated this weekend.\n\nHierarchy remains: *Hudson | Strickland | Rodney.\n\n* = closer-by-committee\n\nAugust 21, 2019\n\nWashington Nationals – It was a tough night for the Nationals’ bullpen on Tuesday, as Wander Suero and Daniel Hudson failed to protect a 1-0 lead in the eighth inning. Suero began the frame by allowing all three hitters he faced to reach base. Hudson then entered and made sure all three runs crossed the plate thanks to a sac fly and a three-run homer. Meanwhile, Hunter Strickland broke his nose in a weightlifting accident before the game. Dave Martinez insisted afterwards that Strickland was available and that he simply liked Suero in that spot.\n\nHierarchy remains: *Hudson | Strickland | Rodney.\n\n* = closer-by-committee\n\nAugust 19, 2019\n\nWashington Nationals – The Nationals placed Sean Doolittle on the IL on Sunday with right knee tendinitis. Daniel Hudson has been the most effective arm in the bullpen lately and is likely the best bet for saves in the near future. Hunter Strickland could also get a look.\n\nUpdated hierarchy: *Hudson | Strickland | Rodney\n\n* = closer-by-committee\n\nAugust 18, 2019\n\nWashington Nationals – The Nationals placed Sean Doolittle on the IL on Sunday with right knee tendinitis. Daniel Hudson has been the most effective arm in the bullpen lately and is likely the best bet for saves in the near future. Hunter Strickland could also get a look.\n\nUpdated hierarchy: *Hudson | Strickland | Rodney.\n\n* = closer-by-committee\n\nAugust 18, 2019\n\nWashington Nationals — Sean Doolittle blew a threw run lead giving up three homeruns and four runs in just 13 pitches. Doolittle’s velocity was down and manager Davey Martinez said he may need to reconsider Doolittle’s workload. If Doolittle receives more rest, that could open up more save chances for Daniel Hudson, Hunter Strickland and maybe even our old friend, Fernando Rodney.\n\nHierarchy remains: Doolittle | Hudson | Strickland.\n\nAugust 15, 2019\n\nWashington Nationals — For Proust, it was a madeleine: sensual vector to transcendent reverie; summoner of deep and dormant ecstasy; midwife to the ever-present past. For Closer Monkey, it is Javy Guerra. Our muse. Subject of our fourth post, ever. And so a vulture save for a 33-year-old journeyman — three innings, three runs, five hits — becomes, somehow, very much more. With Proust, we find “the vicissitudes of life become indifferent to [us], its disasters innocuous, its brevity illusory.” Here, there is no Sean Doolittle. There is no Daniel Hudson. There is definitely no Fernando Rodney. There is, at long last, only “the echo of great spaces traversed,” and a blue-check Twitter confused about what team it plays for. Until next time, Javy. May there ever be a next time.\n\nHierarchy remains: Doolittle | Hudson | Strickland.\n\nAugust 14, 2019\n\nWashington Nationals – We predicted that Sean Doolittle would get a night off on Tuesday, but it was Daniel Hudson who picked up a four-out save, not Fernando Rodney. In fact, Rodney didn’t even pitch in last night’s 3-1 win; it was Hunter Strickland and Wander Suero who got the ball to Hudson. We’ll move Hudson into Rodney’s spot in the hierarchy based on last night, but with all the new relievers pitching well since arriving in Washington, Dave Martinez can be flexible on when to deploy his top arms in the late innings. Don’t be too surprised to see Rodney back in a high-leverage spot soon.\n\nUpdated hierarchy: Doolittle | Hudson | Strickland.\n\nAugust 7, 2019\n\nWashington Nationals – Fernando Rodney protected a two-run lead in the eighth inning on Tuesday. This came after he kept the Nationals ahead by three during the eighth inning of Monday’s triumph. Rodney has now earned an eighth-inning hold in each of the last three Nationals victories, which means we’ll slide him ahead of Hunter Strickland in this revamped Washington hierarchy.\n\nUpdated hierarchy: Doolittle | Rodney | Strickland.\n\nAugust 5, 2019\n\nWashington Nationals – Roenis Elias does indeed need an IL stint, so as promised: welcome back to the hierarchy, Mr. Rodney.\n\nUpdated hierarchy: Doolittle | Strickland | Rodney.\n\nAugust 4, 2019\n\nWashington Nationals — Roenis Elias tweaked his hamstring on Friday and is still being evaluated. If Elias is forced to go on the IL, everybody’s favorite terrible closer Fernando Rodney would move back on to the hierarchy.\n\nHierarchy remains: Doolittle | Strickland | Elias.\n\nAugust 1, 2019\n\nWashington Nationals — Washington is another team going all-in on bullpen help in the push for the playoffs, nabbing Daniel Hudson from Toronto and Roenis Elias and Hunter Strickland from Seattle. Sean Doolittle remains the unquestioned closer, but the road through the middle innings will look a lot different.\n\nUpdated hierarchy: Doolittle | Strickland | Elias.\n\nJuly 31, 2019\n\nWashington Nationals — The Nationals have been busy today, first acquiring Daniel Hudson from the Blue Jays and then trading for Mariners closer Roenis Elias. This gives the Nationals much-needed depth in their bullpen behind closer Sean Doolittle.\n\nUpdated hierarchy: Doolittle | Elias | Rodney.\n\nJuly 27, 2019\n\nWashington Nationals — Kyle Barraclough was called up from AA yesterday and immediately found himself in a high-leverage spot. Needing to get just one out in a tie game with runners on first and second, Barraclough immediately threw a wild pitch before giving up a three-run homer to hang Tony Sipp with the loss. Back to Double-A for you, Kyle!\n\nHierarchy remains: Doolittle | Rodney | Suero.\n\nJuly 5, 2019\n\nWashington Nationals — Sean Doolittle earned a day off yesterday after throwing 76 pitches over the last four days, which left the final two innings to Wander Suero and Fernando Rodney. Suero allowed a hit to both batters he faced in the eighth before being pulled to set up a lefty-lefty matchup. After the team got to the ninth with the lead, Rodney shut the door in the ninth for his second save with the Nationals. After the game, Dave Martinez confirmed that if Doolittle is unavailable, Rodney will be the team’s closer. What a time to be alive.\n\nUpdated hierarchy: Doolittle | Rodney | Suero.\n\nJune 29, 2019\n\nWashington Nationals — Fernando Rodney heard about our Twitter thread and set out to prove all his haters wrong. With Sean Doolittle and Wander Suero both coming off back-to-back games, the Nationals turned to Fernando Rodney to close out the ninth inning with a two-run lead. Rodney slammed the door for his first save of the year. One reason why Rodney drew such widespread ire is that with his save last night, he joins Goose Gossage and Octavio Dotel as the only players to have saves (and presumably blown saves) with nine different teams. At 42, Rodney’s best days are behind him, but last night’s usage and Dave Martinez’s postgame comments suggests he will be in line for save chances in Washington when Doolittle and Suero are both unavailable. Welcome to another hierarchy, Fernando!\n\nUpdated hierarchy: Doolittle | Suero | Rodney.\n\nJune 26, 2019\n\nWashington Nationals — Yesterday we asked our Twitter followers to tell us who their favorite terrible closer of all-time is. Fernando Rodney, one of the most popular answers to that question, made his Nationals debut on Tuesday and pitched the ninth inning of a 5-1 victory. Rodney walked one, struck out one and induced a game-ending double play in his first MLB outing in over a month. Dave Martinez said that Rodney and fellow newcomer Jonny Venters will see some high-leverage situations, so we’ll keep an eye on how Rodney in particular performs with his new club.\n\nHierarchy remains: Doolittle | Suero | Rainey.\n\nJune 22, 2019\n\nWashington Nationals — Sean Doolittle had thrown 33 pitches over the last two days, so the Nationals rested him on Friday night. That allowed Wander Suero, who also pitched in each of the last two games, to collect his first big-league save.\n\nHierarchy remains: Doolittle | Suero | Rainey.\n\nJune 5, 2019\n\nWashington Nationals — Kyle Barraclough hasn’t pitched since May 28, and it seems like primary setup duties have somehow gone to Wander Suero despite his 5.96 ERA. One arm to keep an eye on however is flamethrower Tanner Rainey. He hasn’t allowed an earned run over his last five appearances and sports a K/9 of 15.96.\n\nUpdated hierarchy: Doolittle | Suero | Rainey.\n\nJune 2, 2019\n\nWashington Nationals — The Nationals bullpen got it done last night as Wander Suero pitched a scoreless seventh and eighth inning for his fifth hold of the season and Sean Doolittle pitched a perfect ninth for his eleventh save. However, they still have one of the worst bullpens in the league and at least one beat writer thinks the Nationals should keep an eye on the market for Kimbrel and make a play for him if the price drops.\n\nHierarchy remains: Doolittle | Barraclough | Suero.\n\nMay 30, 2019\n\nWashington Nationals — Kyle McGowin did something amazing on Wednesday. Entering with an 14-run lead in the seventh, he gave up three straight singles and a grand slam to make things a bit more sporting, then retired 9 of the next 10 batters (six by strikeout) to earn the “save.” Per the Baseball-Reference Play Index, this was only the fourth save of the Closer Monkey era (2011-present) to include four or more earned runs (Jerome Williams, Eddie Butler, and Sergio Romo complete Mount Runsmore). And no one had done it with six strikeouts since the legendary . . . Kevin Gregg.\n\nHierarchy remains: Doolittle | Barraclough | Suero.\n\nMay 24, 2019\n\nWashington Nationals — The good news: gifted a one-run lead in the eighth, Wander Suero struck out the side! The bad news: he also gave up a double, an intentional walk, and a home run! Oops! You win some, you lose some — but if you’re Washington’s league-worst bullpen, you mostly just lose some. Fun fact: Sean Doolittle has saved as many bookstores (8) as he has baseball games this season.\n\nHierarchy remains: Doolittle | Barraclough | Suero.\n\nMay 19, 2019\n\nWashington Nationals — Justin Miller has been placed on the IL with a strained right rotator cuff. Wander Suero has a couple holds in his last two appearances, including an eighth-inning hold ahead of a Sean Doolittle save so he should continue to see time in the later innings with Miller out. Speaking of Doolittle, the Cubs filed a formal protest after yesterday’s game alleging that Doolittle used an illegal delivery. We will see if anything comes out of this.\n\nUpdated hierarchy: Doolittle | Barraclough | Suero.\n\nApril 25, 2019\n\nWashington Nationals — Trevor Rosenthal has lost 12 pounds from a viral infection, the second dozen he’s given up on the season. His upcoming stint on the IL will give him up to a month of minor-league rehab to (hopefully) regain his form. The Nationals also activated Justin Miller from the IL, and he’ll return to 2nd in line.\n\nUpdated hierarchy: Doolittle | Barraclough | Miller.\n\nApril 25, 2019\n\nWashington Nationals — Trevor Rosenthal gave up three runs in an inning of work on Wednesday and still lowered his ERA. Rosenthal is hitting 99 on the radar gun, but his control is nonexistent. It’s not fun to watch.\n\nHierarchy remains: Doolittle | Barraclough | Grace.\n\nApril 15, 2019\n\nWashington Nationals — The Nationals placed Justin Miller on the IL over the weekend. Look for Matt Grace and Wander Suero to get more hold opportunities in his absence.\n\nUpdated hierarchy: Doolittle | Barraclough | Grace.\n\nApril 4, 2019\n\nWashington Nationals — In three 2019 appearances, Trevor Rosenthal has faced seven batters. All seven have scored. We think he’ll get a break from high-leverage work, and Justin Miller has impressed thus far.\n\nUpdated hierarchy: Doolittle | Barraclough | Miller.\n\nFebruary 21, 2019\n\nWashington Nationals – Sean Doolittle (1.60 ERA, 0.60 WHIP in 2018) is doing what he can to make Nationals fans forget that they once had both Blake Treinen and Felipe Vazquez in their midst, and Washington is hoping to support him this year with two offseason acquisitions: former Marlins closer Kyle Barraclough and former Cardinals closer Trevor Rosenthal, who is fresh off of elbow surgery. (Dave Martinez has already said that Rosenthal will get a few save chances, though we’re a bit skeptical, given how good Doolittle has been.) Justin Miller, Matt Grace, Koda Glover, and Sammy Solis should round out this pen, which will likely see its share of saves and holds in support of their three top-tier starting pitchers.\n\nStarting 2019 hierarchy: Doolittle | Rosenthal | Barraclough.\n\nHolds candidates: Rosenthal, Barraclough, Glover.\n\nSeptember 12, 2018\n\nWashington Nationals — Sean Doolittle picked up his first save since returning from the DL in the first game of Tuesday’s doubleheader in Philadelphia. Greg Holland, who pitched the eighth inning ahead of Doolittle in game one, tossed a scoreless 10th inning in the nightcap to earn his third save of the year. Doolittle may get some extra rest here and there depending on how cautious the Nats want to be, but he should be their first option in the ninth inning the rest of the year. Holland, meanwhile, has allowed only one earned run in 18 appearances with Washington.\n\nUpdated hierarchy: Doolittle | Holland | Miller.\n\nSeptember 9, 2018\n\nWashington Nationals — Sean Doolittle saw his first action in over two months yesterday in game two of the Nationals’ doubleheader. He got the last two outs of the 8th inning, including one strikeout. After that inning, the game was delayed by rain and Doolittle would have gotten the save if the game did not resume. However, the rain stopped and Greg Holland came on to pitch a scoreless 9th inning and record his second save. It sounds like Doolittle was only used in the 8th because of the threat of rain and may have gotten the 9th in a normal game. We except Doolittle to see the next save chance.\n\nHierarchy remains: *Doolittle | Miller | Holland.\n\n* = closer-by-committee\n\nSeptember 8, 2018\n\nWashington Nationals — Although their game was rained out yesterday, the Nationals did activate Sean Doolittle from the DL. He hasn’t pitched since July 6, so he may not resume closing immediately, but we expect him to be back in that role sooner rather than later since the Nationals’ committee has been shaky since Doolittle’s injury.\n\nUpdated hierarchy: *Doolittle | Miller | Holland.\n\n* = closer-by-committee\n\nSeptember 7, 2018\n\nWashington Nationals — Injured hurler Sean Doolittle played catch on Thursday and could be activated from the DL over the weekend. He’d likely take over as closer in short order.\n\nHierarchy remains: *Miller | Holland | Glover.\n\n* = closer-by-committee\n\nSeptember 2, 2018\n\nWashington Nationals – Justin Miller worked around a leadoff home run in the ninth inning yesterday to lock down his second save. Meanwhile, Sean Doolittle was encouraged with his simulated game on Friday and is scheduled to throw another one today.\n\nHierarchy remains: *Miller | Holland | Glover.\n\n* = closer-by-committee\n\nSeptember 1, 2018\n\nWashington Nationals – The Nats traded Ryan Madson to the Dodgers yesterday. Madson never really found his footing with the Nationals and will look to right the ship on the West Coast. Meanwhile, the biggest bust signing of the offseason, Greg Holland, has been really good since being pick"
