        "text": "At FanFest yesterday I stood before a timeline of baseball in the nation’s capital. Two fellows were wondering why the Senators were also called the Nats. I made bold to tell them, as I had just written the story below for the All-Star Media Guide.\n\nWhen ownership of the Montreal Expos National League franchise was transferred to Washington, DC in 2004, it was only natural for the club to be named the Nationals rather than the Senators, whom we recall as an American League club in two incarnations. The first was the generally woeful club that played in the nation’s capital from 1901 through 1960, featuring Hall of Famers Walter Johnson, Goose Goslin, and Sam Rice. When those Senators relocated to Minnesota for the 1961 season, an expansion franchise of the same name replaced them until 1972, when they relocated to become the Texas Rangers.\n\nAlthough commonly known as the Senators, the original team was also known as the Washington Americans and, paradoxically, as the Washington Nationals, as early as 1905. The nickname “Nats” soon thereafter came to be used as a newspaper-headline contraction (as in “Sox top Nats, 9–8”) of either Senators or Nationals.\n\nBut why was this charter club of the American League called the Nationals anyhow? Working backwards: the National League had included a Washington club in the period 1891–1899 that was known principally as the Senators, or Solons. Another NL club, operating from 1886–1889, was known principally as the Nationals. So why was that latter club thus named?\n\nBecause an even earlier professional club in DC bore that name: the Washington Nationals of the National Association, as early as 1872, which in turn derived from a famous amateur club founded in 1859. Here you have the reason that Washington celebrated its baseball centennial in … 1959!\n\nWho were these Washington Nationals, and why did they long retain their fame? Read on.\n\nA scrapbook of one of the club’s members, E.F. French, survives, but the principal reason to recall this early club is a game it played on a Western tour in 1867, an upset that transformed the future of the game.\n\nThis extraordinarily significant club has been rather neglected by scholars who have instead rushed to celebrate the Cincinnati Red Stockings of 1869 and the economic model of professional play they created … by emulating that of the Washington Nationals. Their notice published in the sporting paper the New York Clipper read:\n\nThe famous Washington club will start upon their proposed Western trip on the 10th [of July], visiting and playing friendly games with the leading clubs of Columbus, Cincinnati, Louisville, Indianapolis, St. Louis, and Chicago, reaching the latter place on the 24th. . . .\n\nThe Washington club was in fact not yet famous, but wished to become so. They had played only five match games in 1865, when they had welcomed clubs from Philadelphia and Brooklyn to play on the “White Lot” behind newly installed President Andrew Johnson’s White House.\n\nAlthough the 1866 Nationals won ten games against five defeats, they were by no means a club to rank alongside the Atlantics, Athletics, Mutuals, or the champion Unions of Morrisania. Those Unions were led by handsome young George Wright, the coming hero of the age, whose older brother Harry had played with the Knickerbockers in the 1850s and had lately reverted to the role of a cricket professional, in Cincinnati.\n\nIn 1867 the Nationals strengthened themselves with additional recruits, giving each a patronage government job, and somehow persuaded George Wright to join them too. Although the players were nominal amateurs, there can be no doubt of their uniformly professional status. The club president listed George’s place of employment as 238 Pennsylvania Avenue, at that time an open field and even today a parking lot.\n\nDuring the three weeks of their Western tour the Nationals made a show of maintaining their amateur status by refusing payments of any kind, even declining reimbursement for travel expenses; these, of course, were covered by their employers, who had graciously permitted them to abandon the desks at which they had seldom been seen anyway. The aim of the National Club directors in going out on tour was not pecuniary gain but social éclat and pride of place: the Western farmers had been getting a bit chesty about their brand of baseball and, it was thought back East, needed a slap of reality at the hands of an experienced ball club.\n\nThe Nationals prepared for their trip with easy triumphs over local cupcakes until they journeyed to Cincinnati to play the Red Stockings on July 15, in a battle of two unbeaten nines. George Wright’s older brother Harry had left New York for the Queen City of the West in March 1865 to serve as the professional instructor and bowler of its Union Cricket Club. It may have seemed to him that as there was no real money to be made from baseball, and the distant cricket club was offering him $1200 annual salary, he might as well return to the trade of his father, Sam Wright, the formidable cricket professional of the celebrated St. George club.\n\nBy the summer of 1866 the Cincinnati Base Ball Club formed, and Harry Wright was enticed to be its pitcher. To devote his full attention to the new national game for 1867 the baseball club’s directors, many of them holding office in common with the cricket club, offered him the same salary he was already receiving to switch sports. The other players were local amateurs, including some doing double duty as cricketers, and they did not take the field until the end of September.\n\nLeading up to their match with the Nationals, the 1867 edition of the Cincinnati Base Ball Club — already popularly named “Red Stockings” for the innovation of hiking their pants, better to display their manly calves in carmine hose, while all other players still wore long trousers — had drubbed four local clubs. But Harry’s expected pleasure in playing against his brother’s club soon was dashed: the Reds were humiliated by a count of 53–10. Although this would be their only loss of the year, it came against their only opponent from outside the tristate area, and so a lesson was there to be drawn. At the end of the season the Red Stocking directors instructed Harry to follow the Nationals’ model and begin recruiting professionals from distant places. The upshot, of course, was the brazenly salaried Red Stockings of 1869, undefeated against all comers from coast to coast.\n\nAfter crushing the Red Stockings and four other patsies, the Nationals headed for Chicago for highly anticipated games against that city’s best, the Excelsiors and Atlantics, named in emulation of Brooklyn’s finest clubs. The Forest Citys of Rockford, Illinois had already played the Excelsiors twice that year, losing narrowly each time — the scores were 45–41 and 28–25 — and thus ceded the state championship. All the same, the Rockford boys were given the consolation prize of an invitation to Chicago to play what amounted to a warmup game against the Nationals on Thursday the 25th at Dexter Park. On the following Saturday the Nationals would defeat Rockford’s nemesis, the Excelsiors, by a score of 49–4 (not a typo); on Monday the Washington nine would trounce the Atlantics by 78–17.\n\nFacing a frightful outcome, the “corn crackers” of Rockford were led by novice pitcher Albert Spalding, not yet seventeen years of age. Four decades later he recalled:\n\nI experienced a severe case of stage fright…. A great lump arose in my throat, and my heart beat so like a trip-hammer that I imagined it could be heard by everyone on the grounds. I knew, also, that every player on the Rockford nine had an idea that their kid pitcher would surely become rattled and go to pieces as soon as the strong batters of the Nationals had opportunity to fall upon his delivery….\n\nIn the sixth inning George Wright “took the bat and by a splendid stroke to center field made a home run.” As Spalding recalled,\n\nAt this psychological moment, Col. Frank Jones, President of the National Club, rushed up to George Wright, who was about to take his position at the bat, and said, in a louder voice possibly than he intended:\n\n“Do you know, George, that this is the seventh innings and we are six runs behind? … to lose this game would be to make our whole trip a failure.”\n\nThis incident inspired the Rockfords with confidence and determination, and for the first time we began to realize that victory was not only possible, but probable, and the playing of our whole team from that time forward was brilliant.\n\nRockford and Spalding held their lead, emerging victorious by a score of 29–23. There had been upsets before in baseball’s brief history, but never one on this scale. When the Nationals won their next game handily to close out their tour, the cries of fraud regarding the Rockford contest grew loud. No one could have known then that several of the Forest City lads would one day become nationally prominent players — particularly Al Spalding and infielder Ross Barnes.\n\nThe Nationals broke up after the season, but even in defeat their Steinbrennerian squadron had supplied the model for how baseball might succeed as America’s game. The club had brought together the best talent from distant places, and playing skill rather than local celebrity would be the path to victory ever after. Cincinnati began importing stars in 1868, and one year later took the Washington Nationals model to its logical conclusion — an all-salaried team of all-stars."
