        "text": "In sports, there are often moments that leave fans and players alike up at night, wondering what would have happened if things were a little different. Some of them have to do with a play on the field, others have to do with trading away or not signing a player, and some happen fully off the field.\n\nThe Pittsburgh Steelers have a moment that falls into the latter category. The year was 2006, and the team was fresh off winning a Super Bowl in 2005. Quarterback Ben Roethlisberger went out on his motorcycle, as he often did, and got into a crash that landed him in the ICU."
