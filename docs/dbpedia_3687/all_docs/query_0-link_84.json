She’s the only woman in X Games history to earn three medals as a rookie as well as the only woman to win two gold as a rookie. Other highlights included Mathilde Gremaud becoming the first woman ever to land a double cork 1440 in either ski or snowboard competition; it powered her to Ski Big Air gold. And Dusty Henricksen joined Gu as a rookie with two gold medals when the teen shocked onlookers by winning both Men’s Snowboard Slopestyle and Knuckle Huck.\n\nX Games summer returned in 2021 after the pandemic forced its cancellation in 2020. With uncertainty still surrounding the event world, X Games went to a “backyard model,” with multiple small venues across Southern California -- including one literally in an athlete’s yard -- hosting competitions. The Moto X contests were held on Axell Hodges’ property in Ramona; most BMX disciplines were in Pat Casey’s backyard in Riverside; and BMX Street and Skateboard were at the California Training Facility (CA|TF) in Vista. Skateboard Best Trick stole the show and earned attention worldwide when 53-year-old Tony Hawk spontaneously decided to compete. And while the sports icon performed well, it was 12-year-old Brazilian Gui Khury who took gold. Khury landed the first 1080 on a vert ramp, ever, in the process becoming the youngest gold medalist in X Games history.\n\nThough there were capacity restrictions, fans returned to X Games Aspen! They got a show, too: With two more podiums, Jamie Anderson extended her record for most medals by a woman at X Games; she now has 21 -- tied with Mark McMorris for the most in winter disciplines. In other Snowboard action, Kiwi Zoi Sadowski-Synnott took gold in both Snowboard Big Air and Slopestyle, where she became the first woman to land multiple double corks in either a ski or snowboard contest. And Marcus Kleveland almost became the first person to earn three gold at the same X Games winter event when he won Big Air and Knuckle Huck and took silver to McMorris in Slopestyle. In the Ski disciplines, 19-year-old Kelly Sildaru scored her tenth X Games medal with SuperPipe gold. The victory makes her the most-medaled teenager in history, breaking a tie with Nyjah Huston and Shaun White. Alex Hall became the first male skier to collect three medals at one X Games, punctuating his weekend with the first 2160 ever landed in a contest, ski or snowboard.\n\nIn late April, X Games traveled to Japan for the first time. X Games Chiba was held at the ZOZO Marine Stadium, homefield of the Chiba Lotte Marines baseball team. Japanese athletes excelled and combined for ten medals, tied with the United States for the most at the event. Japanese athletes also swept the Men’s Skateboard Street and Women’s Skateboard Park podiums, the second and third time they’ve accomplished that feat at X Games.\n\nX Games summer returned to the backyard model in 2022, and a new yard was added to the roster: Elliot Sloan hosted Skateboard Vert, Vert Best Trick and the competition debut of MegaPark at his house in Vista, California. San Diego’s legendary Brooklyn Rail was the site of another X Games first: Real Street Best Trick, won by Yuto Horigome. Teen multi-sport sensation Sky Brown took her second straight Women’s Skateboard Park victory, and BMX Street ace Garrett Reynolds earned his fifteenth X Games gold. That ties him with Shaun White for the most in history. In Moto X, Australian Rob Adelberg became the first person to land back-to-back frontflips, while Colby Raha smashed the old X Games QuarterPipe High Air record by skying 49 feet for a walk-off gold, his fifth. Including the 18-foot takeoff ramp, Raha was 67 feet high, or nearly 7 stories in the air.\n\nThe year ended with a bang: In late October, it was announced that after 27 years at the forefront of action sports, ESPN sold a majority share of the X Games property to MSP Sports Capital. Onward into the future!\n\nWomen stole the show at X Games Aspen 2023. Megan Oldham became the first woman to land a triple in either ski or snowboard contest history -- her triple cork 1440 scored a perfect 50 and led to Ski Big Air gold. Not to be outdone, Reira Iwabuchi stuck the first triple in women’s snowboard history later in the weekend and also earned gold. Speaking of perfect scores, Mac Forehand claimed a dramatic victory in Men’s Ski Big Air. Trailing entering his final attempt, Forehand had to log a 50 to win; a 49 would’ve left him with silver. And he did, thanks to a world’s-first forward leftside 2160. Forehand is the first man since Bobby Brown in 2010 to tally a perfect score in Ski Big Air. Other X Games Aspen 2023 highlights included Mark McMorris’ walk-off gold in Snowboard Slopestyle for his 22nd medal, the most in X Games winter discipline history. And just like at Aspen 2022, Marcus Kleveland almost became the first person to earn three gold at the same X Games winter event when he won Big Air and Knuckle Huck and took silver to McMorris in Slopestyle.\n\nIn May, X Games returned to Japan after a successful debut in 2022, and young athletes excelled. Teens and pre-teens comprised 32.4% of the X Games Japan 2023 roster, the highest percentage of any X Games in history. Ten teens earned medals, and they swept the podium in both Women’s Skateboard Park and Women’s Skateboard Street. Ginwoo Onodera stunned the world by dominating Men’s Skateboard Street. At age 13 years, 2 months, the budding Japanese star is the youngest champ in X Games Street history.\n\nFans returned to X Games’ summer showcase for the first time since 2019! X Games California featured crowds packing the beachside venue in Ventura, and additional contests were held in the San Diego area: Real Street Best Trick and Real BMX Best Trick thrilled at the iconic Rincon Middle School, and MegaPark was back in Elliot Sloan’s yard. The youth again impressed: Reese Nelson’s silver medal in Women’s Skateboard Vert made her the youngest medalist in X Games history, at age 10 years, 8 months. Arisa Trew, age 13 years, 2 months, won both Women’s Skateboard Vert (where she landed the first women’s 720 in a contest) and Park, smashing a record Shaun White owned for 20 years: youngest X Games double gold medalist. Tony Hawk competed in Skateboard Vert Best Trick for the second straight X Games, but it was 14-year-old Gui Khury who took his second gold in the discipline. Ryan Williams and Kevin Peraza both collected two gold and a silver, becoming the first BMX athletes with three medals at the same X Games since 2006."
