        "text": "Washington, D.C., March 22, 2011 – The Washington Nationals, in association with the Washington Nationals Dream Foundation and The Annette M. and Theodore N. Lerner Family Foundation, today announced their partnership with the Miracle League of Montgomery County, the Kiwanis Club of Bethesda, the Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission (M-NCPPC)’s Montgomery Parks Department, and the Montgomery County Recreation Department to construct the Washington Nationals Miracle Field in Germantown, Maryland.\n\n“This partnership exemplifies both the Nationals’ commitment to the community and the Dream Foundation’s dedication to improving the lives of children in the Capital region,” Nationals Principal Owner and Dream Foundation Chair Marla Lerner Tanenbaum said. “We are proud to partner with these organizations to help make this field a reality for local children with special needs who will now have a place to play baseball.”\n\nScheduled to open this summer, the new field will be home to the Miracle League of Montgomery County, which provides children with mental and/or physical challenges the opportunity to play competitive baseball in a safe environment. Unlike typical baseball fields, this specially-designed field will incorporate a cushioned synthetic turf that allows children in wheelchairs and walkers to safely “run” the bases without fear of injury.\n\n“This new field will give children facing tremendous challenges the opportunity to get out in the sunshine and play ball,” said Dr. Jim Leder, President of the Miracle League of Montgomery County and the Kiwanis Club of Bethesda. “We are proud to offer children of Montgomery County and beyond the resources to play the game of baseball.”\n\nConstruction of the venue, which was designed by Grace E. Fielder of GE Fielder Associates, will be funded in part by large contributions from the Washington Nationals Dream Foundation, The Annette M. and Theodore N. Lerner Family Foundation, the Kiwanis Club of Bethesda, and Montgomery Parks via their public-private partnership program. Through this program, Montgomery Parks and its partners have provided County residents with an array of facilities such as the Go Ape complex in Rock Creek Regional Park, the Red Wiggler Community Farm, the Maryland SoccerPlex, Great and Small, and the Jack Schore Tennis Center. The new Miracle League field will be located in South Germantown Recreational Park as part of the larger athletic complex that includes the Maryland SoccerPlex, a splash playground, a swim center, a miniature golf course and a driving range.\n\n“The Miracle League project is a perfect example of how our public-private partnership program can successfully leverage private dollars to provide our residents with valuable and desired parks and recreation facilities,” Montgomery Parks Deputy Director Mike Riley said. “We would like to recognize the hard work and contributions of the Miracle League and all the others who helped make this project a reality – we are all looking forward to opening day!”\n\n“The Department of Recreation enthusiastically ‘steps up to the plate’ to provide the programming for the Miracle League,” Department of Recreation Director Gabriel Albornoz said. “I am very pleased that the Department of Recreation is a partner in this dedicated collaborative work that will provide children with disabilities the opportunity to actively participate in baseball.”\n\nCommunity members can support construction of the field by purchasing an engraved brick, which will be used to fill in the “stitches” of the baseball-shaped main plaza at the entrance of the Miracle Field. Bricks can be purchased for pre-construction rates starting at $250.
