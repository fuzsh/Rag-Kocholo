        "text": "White House history and American baseball history have been intertwined for more than a century, creating a rich legacy of presidential fans, championship celebrations, and more than a few first pitches. During a three-year partnership with the Washington Nationals, the Association was able to reach a new audience with our mission through a fun, educational collaboration that elevates White House history; increasing awareness of the Association's signature fundraising tool, the Official White House Christmas Ornament; and engaging students and fans across the city in new and exciting ways.\n\nRacing Calvin & Racing Herbie\n\nNearly 10 feet tall and a formidable racer, Racing Calvin, joined the Washington Nationals Racing Presidents line-up in the summer of 2015 as new favorite in the popular mid-game race. Building on the presidential history already a part of the racing team with Presidents Washington, Jefferson, Lincoln, T. Roosevelt, and Taft, the new Visiting President adds visibility and connectivity to the partnership around Coolidge and his ties to the Washington team. In 2016, Racing Herbie joined the lineup to coincide with the Official 2016 White House Christmas Ornament honoring the administration of Herbert Hoover, who served as the thirty-first president of the United States from 1929 to 1933. Both Racing Cal and Racing Herbie were retired at the end of the 2016 baseball season.\n\nWhite House History Challenge\n\nDuring our three-year partnership, fans could test their White House history knowledge at each home game during a live fifth-inning quiz created by Association historians and features a range of trivia questions from first pets to significant White House events. In-game winners were rewarded with their own Official White House Christmas Ornament.\n\nIn Stadium Promotion\n\nVisitors to the Nationals team store were able to purchase the Official White House Christmas Ornament. Each year, the Association sequentially honors a president or significant White House anniversary with the Official White House Christmas Ornament. During the partnership, the Nationals team store carried the 2015, 2016, and 2017 White House Christmas ornaments.\n\nEducation Program\n\nThe White House Historical Association and the Washington Nationals launched their educational program for high school students in the Washington metropolitan area that examined the powers of the president and focus on decision-making in the White House. Aligned with school learning standards, White House at Bat: A Presidential History Challenge offered a creative way to research and interpret White House history with the power of the Racing Presidents line-up.\n\nStudents were invited to submit a project entry consisting of a storyboard for a 50-second video about a decision made by one of the Racing Presidents, an accompanying essay, and an annotated bibliography. Five winning projects, one for each of the Racing Presidents, were be chosen each year during the three-year partnership to be produced for the big screen at a major league baseball game at Nationals Park.\n\nMembership Promotion\n\nDuring the 2017 baseball season, The White House Historical Association’s partnership with the Washington Nationals expanded to offer a membership program with exclusive Nationals-themed incentives. For $50, fans could become a member of The White House Historical Association and receive a new Washington Nationals experience or item for members who joined in April through September of 2017.\n\nIncentives for members included autographed photos of Nationals players, an exclusive invitation to a private event with Baseball Hall of Famers Ivan “Pudge” Rodriguez and Tim Raines, a customized New Era Nationals cap, and much more."
