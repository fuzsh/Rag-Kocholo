        "text": "On Saturday, baseball’s top prospect, James Wood, reached the 130 at-bat milestone which moved his status from “prospect” to “rookie” within MLB’s definition. With Wood graduating as a prospect, a few of us in NatsTown gave TalkNats our Top-30s, and what we knew going into this is that few people agree on even a Top-10.\n\nYou can use different methodologies on ranking prospects from the 80/20 tools rankings to future value to the most potential. Who will be the best MLB players?\n\nContinue reading →\n\nWhile you would appreciate less drama in your Washington Nationals’ wins, the team has the chance to have a walk-off for an entire series if the Nats can win today via a walk-off to go with Friday and Saturday’s walk-off wins. A rare feat.\n\nThe heroes from the bullpen to throw zeroes in both games in come-from-behind wins that saw Alex Call and Jose Tena get consecutive walk-off hits has been dramatic to say the least. The LED lights that are new at Nats Park this season have added to the effects of these walk-offs as they go red and flicker.\n\nContinue reading →\n\nIn the new MLB scheduling, the Washington Nationals have the Los Angeles Angels in Nationals Park on even years, and hopefully one day for a World Series. Both teams are rebuilding now, and by the looks of it, the Nats are far ahead in the rebuilding process. This week in fact, Baseball America ranked the Nats as the 4th best farm system in baseball, while the Angels were ranked at dead last. If the Angels were a playoff team now, maybe you could justify their barren farm system — but they are a 3 1/2 games ahead of the lowly Oakland A’s in the AL West standings. Sadly, the Nats are only 1/2 game ahead of the Angels in MLB standings.\n\nContinue reading →\n\nYesterday’s game was a muddy mess at Nationals Park, both figuratively and literally. The rains pelted the playing surface for much of the day. The game itself, encapsulated the great, the good, the bad, and the ugly. The score was a 2-2 tie going into the 9th inning. Up until that point, during the pouring rain at parts of the game, and three separate rain delays, there was hope for a Washington Nationals victory.\n\nA key mistake pushed the game to a 3-run deficit in the 9th inning from what should have been a 2-run deficit. Then a baseball miracle from Luis Garcia Jr. brought visions of a Nats’ victory. Never in the history of the Nationals has a game been tied in the 9th inning from a 3-run deficit in a 2-strike, 2-out situation until Garcia Jr. knocked a baseball just above the left field wall, 351 feet, for a wall-scraping home run to tie the game with the improbable, “Weaver.”\n\nBut what happened before that, had the postgame consternation, because the Nationals ended up losing the game in extra innings. With bases loaded in this 2-2 game in the 9th inning, it was a good pitch by Kyle Finnegan that turned into a disaster — because he did not back-up his catcher in case of an errant throw from the outfield — which occurred — as the throw skipped off the wet grass into the Giants’ dugout — allowing an extra run to score. A 4-2 deficit turned to 5-2 when the umpire awarded the runner at third base the advancement to home plate.\n\nContinue reading →\n\nThe Washington Nationals Twitter/X account posted up what they called “a painting” that looked a photo, so we used Photoshop to get us started on creating a DC Masterpiece, and then added some brushstrokes. In the center of the painting is James Wood sporting the Uncle Slam hat, and he is surrounded by his teammates in a celebration of one of the most impressive home runs in Nats’ history.\n\nFor Wood, that was just his 31st career game, and he did it all last night with a home run, triple, two walks, two stolen bases, and four runs scored, to get his team to an 11-5 laugher that began kind of gloomy in a first inning 4-0 deficit.\n\nContinue reading →"
