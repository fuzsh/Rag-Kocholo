        "text": "Most of the Library's online collections, databases, and Web pages can searched through the Library's primary search engine, located on the Library's home page as well as at https://www.loc.gov/search/.\n\nThe Library's search engine takes advantage of \"faceted searching,\" which allows users to refine the results of an initial keyword search, or to browse for content using various categories of information (facets) related to items in the Library's physical and online collections. To view available facets, go to https://www.loc.gov/search/ and examine the options in the \"Refine your results\" column at the left of the page:\n\nMajor facets available include Original Format; Online Format; Date; Location; Part of; Contributor; Subject; Language; and Access Condition. Under each major facet are numerous, more specific facets that you can select to narrow a results set. The default for search results is to display materials available online. Select \"All Items\" to change the list of results to include records for items in the Library's physical collections.\n\nBrowsing by Facet for Baseball Materials\n\nWhen using the main search page to locate baseball materials, you do no need to enter an initial keyword search in order to begin refining results by facet. You can immediately start browsing by facet and locating materials without ever needing to conduct a keyword search.\n\nOne of the most important facets for identifying baseball-related material on the Library's website is the Subject facet:\n\nTo find subjects related to baseball, select \"More Subjects\" at the bottom of this facet to open up a larger list of subjects:\n\nThis larger list of subjects is arranged by number of matches, from the subject with the most available items to the subject with the least. You can browse this list to find subjects related to baseballâ€”select \"Alphabetically\" to search for subjects that begin with a specific word or phrase, such as Ruth, Babe. Searching alphabetically on \"Baseball\" will bring you to a page listing all subjects that begin with that term:\n\nYou can select a specific heading to be brought to a list of items assigned it.\n\nSearching by Keyword, then Refining by Facet\n\nRather than beginning your search by using the \"Refine your results\" facets, you can begin with a keyword search and then refine the keyword results by facet. For example, you can search across the Library's website on the keyword baseball by entering the term into the search box at the top of the main search page (or other Library pages):\n\nThe default arrangement is by number of matching items, though the list can be sorted alphabetically as well. Once you find a subject, or another facet, in which you are interested, select it to be brought to a list of items on the Library's website assigned that facet that also include a match on the keyword baseball. For example, if you are interested in baseball sheet music, select Notated Music under the \"Original Format\" facet:\n\nThis will bring you to a results page listing items on the Library's website that include a match on the keyword baseball and whose original format is Notated Music:\n\nYou can browse this list of results or resort them using the \"View\" drop-down menu at the top of the results list. If you want to further refine your results, you can again use the facets available from the \"Refine your results\" column at the left. For instance, if you want to narrow your results to notated music published in 1908, go to the Date facet and select \"1900-1999\":\n\nOnce you select this date range, the facets listed under Date will automatically adjust to present a refined list of dates from which to choose, this time by decade:\n\nWhen you choose a decade the list will again be refined, this time by individual year. After selecting \"1900 to 1909\" you can then select \"1908\" from the more refined list of Date facets to be brought to matching items in our online collections: items published in 1908, whose original format is Notated Music, and whose text or record includes the keyword baseball:\n\nGranular Searching by Facet\n\nWhen searching or limiting results by facet, keep in mind that the same facet, such as Date or Subject, can often be refined multiple times. For example, if you begin your search by limiting content to the subject Baseball, you can return to the Subject facet to find a newly refined list of subject facets that includes more granular subjects from which to choose:\n\nClicking on the \"More Subjects\" link will open the complete list of refined subject facets from which you can choose. You can refine results by two, three, or more Subject facets, and combine that search with other facets (e.g., Original Format, Location, and Date) as you browse for content.\n\nLeveraging the power of faceted searching from the Library's faceted search home page, as well from the main Subject page for baseball, you can quickly and efficiently mine much of the Library's online baseball-related content to find exactly the types of resources in which you are interested.\n\nSearch Help"
