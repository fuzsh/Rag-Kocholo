        "text": "One way to begin in AKC Rally is to find a training club near you to take classes with your dog. Prospective students are usually welcome to observe a class before signing up.\n\nIf you haven’t attended a Rally event in person, we highly recommend you attend one as a spectator. It will familiarize you with ring procedures and give you a chance to ask questions of those who are more experienced at Rally events.\n\nAfter you have completed your training classes and you decide to enter a Rally trial, there are six levels of competition: Novice, Intermediate/Advanced, Excellent and Master/Choice. Look on the AKC Events Calendar to find an event near you and then submit an official AKC entry form to the trial secretary or superintendent listed to take entries for the trial. Scoring is not as rigorous as traditional obedience, and all teams begin with a perfect 100 with points deducted along the way. If you retain a score of at least 70 points, you will earn a leg towards a title."
