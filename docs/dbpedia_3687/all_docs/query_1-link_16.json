        "text": "Discover History\n\nStories from baseball's rich history are constantly being added to keep you connected to the game you love. Our stories explore the game on the field, its legendary contributors and baseball's impact on American culture.\n\nOff\n\nFrom the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum’s collection containing tens of thousands of artifacts, our curators have created each team’s Starting Nine by hand-picking nine must-see pieces for each of the 30 MLB teams. This limited-time list is the perfect introduction to the Museum for every Washington Nationals fan. Don’t wait to make your visit to Cooperstown to take the Hall of Fame Starting Nine challenge.\n\nPURCHASE MUSEUM TICKETS\n\nWearing this Montreal jersey on July 28, 1991, Dennis Martínez pitched the first perfect game in the history of the Expos/Nationals franchise. The 2-0 victory over the Dodgers in Los Angeles made the native of Nicaragua the first foreign-born pitcher to toss a big league perfecto.\n\n¡Viva Baseball!\n\nWielding this bat, Washington outfielder Bryce Harper hit three home runs to lead the Nationals to a 7-5 victory over the visiting Miami Marlins, May 6, 2015. At the age of 22, Harper became the youngest player to hit three homers in a game since Joe Lahoud of the Red Sox in 1969.\n\nWhole New Ballgame\n\nOn June 29, 1984, over two decades before the Expos moved to Washington, D.C. to become the Nationals, Pete Rose wore this Montreal cap when he played in his 3,309th career game, breaking the big league record held by Boston Red Sox great Carl Yastrzemski.\n\nOne For The Books\n\nThrowing 96 of his 119 pitches for strikes, Washington Nationals pitcher Max Scherzer wore this cap while whiffing a record-tying 20 Detroit Tigers, en route to a 3-2 complete-game victory, May 11, 2016.\n\nOne For The Books\n\nWhile today’s Washington Nationals feature some of the game’s most dominant pitchers, none have had a career quite like that of Walter Johnson, star of the old Washington Senators (now the Minnesota Twins). The author of 3,509 strikeouts, 110 career shutouts and 417 career wins, “The Big Train” wore this uniform near the end of his 21 years with the club.\n\nOne For The Books\n\nIn Game 7 of the 2019 World Series, Washington DH Howie Kendrick reversed the contest’s momentum when he knocked this ball off the right field foul pole in the seventh inning for a two-run homer, giving the Nationals a 3-2 lead they would not relinquish.\n\nYour Team Today\n\nWith his club down three games to two in the 2019 World Series, Nationals pitcher Stephen Strasburg donned this jersey for Game 6. The 2019 league leader in wins (18) and innings pitched (209) came through in the clutch, winning 7-2, to force a deciding seventh game.\n\nYour Team Today\n\nJuan Soto wore this jersey during his stellar 2018 rookie season with the Nationals. In 116 games, the Dominican native blasted 22 homers, notched 70 RBI and finished second for NL Rookie of the Year honors. Soto’s sophomore season didn’t disappoint, as he was a major factor in the Nationals run to their first World Championship title.\n\nYour Team Today\n\nAndre Dawson’s Hall of Fame plaque features “The Hawk” wearing the cap of the Montreal Expos, the club now known as the Washington Nationals. After 11 seasons with the Expos (1976-1986), Dawson left the club as the franchise career leader in games played, runs, hits, doubles, triples, home runs, RBI and steals.\n\nPlaque Gallery"
