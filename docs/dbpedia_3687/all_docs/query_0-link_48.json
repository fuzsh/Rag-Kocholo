        "text": "I’m not sure why, but the Washington Nationals have made a bunch of uniform changes and they are almost all bad. To quote Uni Watch – the Nats are a “Pepsi team” when it comes to uniforms – constantly changing their appearance.\n\nRoad Uniforms\n\nThe script “Washington” jersey that debuted for 2009 is out. This is really disappointing because it was the best away uniform in the history of D.C. baseball. Using the curly W in the city name was classic.\n\nThe old\n\nTodd Radom, who designed the Nats original look and the road script lamented it’s end on instagram.\n\nThe new\n\nStarting this year the roadies will feature a block “WASHINGTON” that is so generic looking it appears like a knockoff you’d see in the clearance bin at Marshall’s or TJ Maxx. BORING.\n\nNew pullover\n\nIf there was a bright spot to not having D.C. baseball for over three decades it was that we missed the bad 1970s uniforms with sansabelt pants and pullovers. Somebody decided that needed to be rectified. This will be an alternate jersey.\n\nIt looks like leisure wear Capt. Kirk wore in the first Star Trek movie if he were a Nats fan.\n\nAt least the interlocking DC is back on a patch within the outline of the District. That was also a Todd Radom design. A little progress…\n\nBye the numbers\n\nThe Nats home and navy alternate uniforms (best known for being worn during the 2019 World Series championship) will no longer have numbers on the front.\n\nEXCLUSIVE: Nationals Making Changes to Home Whites, Navy Alternates – Uni Watch\n\nFewer Curly W sightings\n\nIt’s been a few years since the Nats regularly wore their red curly W caps at home, opting for a white panel cap and a block W in the Capitol dome. It’s a downgrade, but I don’t think it’s a mystery of why the red caps are less prominent (Uni Watch) though the curly W isn’t involved there.\n\nA new spring training cap has a bold navy block W outlined in white on a navy cap. It’s boring. It’s not to be confused with the “clubhouse cap” which has a curly W.\n\nSPRING TRAINING CAP\n\nCLUBHOUSE CAP (1 of 6!)\n\nYes, there are too many different uniform options and incoherent branding seems to be top down from MLB, not strictly a Nats issue. Still, there are about 72 caps for sale and I still can’t find the original Nats navy road cap online! It may be available at Nationals Park though. I need to splurge and get it.\n\nThe Cherry Blossom uniforms last season\n\nThough they aren’t my thing, the popular cherry blossom uniforms are sticking around for one more season.\n\nOh and by the way, the Lerners are no longer selling\n\nYup, after putting the team on the market two years ago, they are no longer selling. They aren’t investing in the on-field product either. Joey Gallo doesn’t count.\n\nMore Nats uniforms coverage\n\nLots of pixels generated over these changes…\n\nNationals’ new uniform set features a pullover and redesigned road grays – The Post\n\nNationals unveil new uniforms for 2024 – MLB\n\nThe Washington Nationals unveiled five new baseball jerseys for this season – WUSA\n\nWashington Nationals Unveil New Pullover and Road Jerseys – Uni Watch\n\nMLB Releases Silly 2024 Clubhouse Cap Collection – Uni Watch\n\nMLB Finally Releases 2024 Batting Practice Caps – Uni Watch\n\nAnd then there is the matter of overall uniform quality\n\nOh man, the new Nike/Fanatics uniforms are about as well put together as a Jim Bowden rotation. Uni Watch has it covered – start here Let’s Assess the Nike/MLB Uni Snafu, FAQ-Style\n\nNike and Fanatics: Who’s Responsible for MLB’s New Uniforms?\n\nNike’s Latest MLB Snafu: New Pants Don’t Leave Much to the Imagination\n\nRadical Transparancy: More MLB Teams Victimized by See-Thru Pants\n\nAn Open Letter to My Friends at Nike\n\nMLB/Nike Fiasco Now Features Mismatched Road Greys\n\nNike? Fanatics? Nope, Turns Out It’s MLB’s Fault! (Maybe)\n\nAn Open Letter to My Friends at Major League Baseball\n\nEXCLUSIVE: The Inside Story Behind MLB’s Mismatched Grey Uniforms\n\nNo wonder Lukas is retiring from Uni Watch!\n\nFootnotes"
