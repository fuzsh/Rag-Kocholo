        "text": "For a decade, Nationals Academy has served over 6,000 D.C. youth across a continuum of free programs designed to foster their positive character development, academic achievement, and improved health. Since beginning after school programs in the fall of 2013, five classes have matriculated from third through eighth grade in the BASE afterschool and summer program, going on to excel on and off the baseball field at some of the regionâ€™s most competitive high schools.\n\nNationals Academy has also grown into a community pillar over the last decade, serving as a hub of support throughout the pandemic and a critical food access point for the neighborhood through its weekly produce market and meal programs.\n\nBecause of the continued generosity of its partners, supporters, and volunteers, more young people every year will have access to academic enrichment, effective coaching, and the joy of baseball at the Nationals Youth Baseball Academy."
