We could have made a lot of excuses but we didn't, we attacked the game. Lampard has already brought in assistant manager Edwards from Chelsea, while first-team coach Clement was Carlo Ancelotti's assistant during his time as the Blues' manager from 2009-2011, when Lampard and Cole were players at Stamford Bridge. The result means Marseille stay in third place in Ligue 1, two points behind Nice in the race for the podium, while Lille climb above Lyon into 10th. I think that was a big boost for him to realise in difficult moments that people are going to give him support, and the club did exactly the same as his team-mates. Both of the new teams will therefore have a smaller pool of players to choose from in the expansion draft, which has suited all parties well. Many players who have been traded have expressed a desire to join one of the new franchises, which makes for a more comfortable transition than the typical practice of players who are often unwittingly selected in the expansion draft. Team news, stats and how to follow on Sky Sports as the Scottish Premiership returns on Saturday afternoon. But as we defended well, the triumph was never in danger. But ultimately, it was a truly deserved victory for Leeds and there is something special about a celebratory Elland Road. Ben Arfa signed for Newcastle United from Marseille in January 2011 and scored 13 goals in 76 league appearances for the Tyneside club. What remains unknown is whether England can get the job done against true world-class opposition who can control possession, and whether they - and by association Southgate - are overcome by conservatism when the pressure valves tighten, as when they took early leads against Croatia in the 2018 World Cup semi-final and against Italy in July. Sky Sports' Ben Grounds: Pulisic's frustration is understandable, but it ought to be said that his history of injuries has contributed to him being in and out of the Chelsea team. Chelsea hit back just before half-time, however, Mateo Kovacic curling one in off the inside of the post from distance after Caoimhin Kelleher, Liverpoolâs stand-in goalkeeper, had punched clear a free kick. Ron Walker: Bowen running out of time Sky Sports' Ron Walker: I can't remember a time where picking an England squad has been quite this tricky. If they'd lost to Liverpool, Chelsea and Man City in the last few weeks you hold your hands up and you accept that they are just better teams at this time. The teams play against each other in a home-and-away round-robin format, with each side playing 14 matches. The top three teams in the table will qualify for the 2022 World Cup, while the team that finishes fourth will progress to the inter-confederation play-off fixture. Newcastle United defender Kieran Trippier fractured a foot in Sunday's Premier League win over Aston Villa. San Francisco Giants vs. Washington Nationals Box Score CBS Sports brings you live coverage, scoring and stats for the MLB matchup between San Francisco Giants and Washington Nationals on August 6Â ... It is possible for someone else, not a big, high-profile team, to win it, and I think Scotland have a chance this time. Current boss Clarke has already backed his players to 'become legends', adding the team have the potential to progress beyond the group stages. Webster's Liverpool heroes when he was growing were up were Steven Gerrard, Jamie Carragher and Robbie Fowler. I've had the pleasure of meeting Robbie and Jamie a couple of times and working with them, he said. Stevie follows me on Instagram and he dropped me a little message when I announced I was playing the Arena in Liverpool - I actually met him when I was a little kid, but not since then. That day will hopefully come soon and I am looking forward to it. I said on transfer deadline day I thought Jesse Lingard was the signing of the window. To get someone of his quality from Manchester United is a great coup for West Ham. That crucial match at Stamford Bridge on April 20 marks the beginning of a tricky run for the Gunners, with a home clash against Manchester United swiftly following that game in hand, before a trip to West Ham at the start of May. The Lionesses drew 0-0 with Spain in their second fixture of the tournament on Sunday after drawing 1-1 with Canada in their opener at the Riverside Stadium. That will likely see the north Londoners step up their attempts to land a forward, with Kulusevski fitting the profile. In 18 Premier League appearances for Wolves this season, the Spaniard is yet to score or assist, and across his top-flight career in England, he registers a goal or assist at half the rate of Moura and Bergwign. The European champions got a first-half goal from Romelu Lukaku and then had to hold on in the second half, with Kepa Arrizabalaga making a pair of big saves to preserve the lead. You've only got to watch them play - who wouldn't go there? I don't see them going anywhere and hanging on, booting the ball away and taking a 2-0 defeat.

Alex Lowry scored a dream debut goal while James Tavernier scored and missed a penalty as Rangers swept Stirling Albion 4-0 in the Scottish Cup. However, due to injury issues, Ramos has yet to play for the club, but Pochettino says that the Spanish star's debut should be coming in the near future. No United player has made more tackles or recoveries this season. He also ranks top in terms of possession won in the middle third. He makes me better, said Guardiola of his Liverpool counterpart. The FA Cup is a massive competition, he said this week. Fans at the Rod Laver Arena were in full voice while the Scot downed Nikoloz Basilashvili in the first round of the Grand Slam. Off the field too, life was tumultuous. Two relationships resulted in two children, only one of whom remained part of his life. A series of failed financial investments and long-standing problems with a house in the hills outside Madrid played out over the backdrop of a football career that was fading much faster than anyone had hoped.
