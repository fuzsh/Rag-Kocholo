Wilson Bryan Key has been dismissed as a crackpot and a conspiracy fetishist, and I have little patience with global conspiracies. But at the time I did find some of the types of things he was talking about in magazine ads. I have no idea how effective subliminal marketing is, but I was seriously disturbed - and angry - to find those ghost images in all sorts of places.\n\n21heyjude\n\nOct 25, 2007, 9:07 pm\n\nArslan by M.J.

Check out the reviews (editorial as well as customer) at Amazon.\n\n22Nickelini\n\nOct 25, 2007, 10:43 pm\n\nIn movies and in books, I find realism much scarier than any science fiction or horror could ever be. That's why my vote goes to A Fine Balance, by Rohinton Mistry.\n\nHolocaust stories will give me nightmares too.\n\n23xenchu\n\nOct 25, 2007, 10:52 pm\n\nThe book My Awakening by David Duke was racist and disturbing.\n\nThe touchstone gave the wrong book for My Awakening.\n\n24thatbooksmell\n\nEdited: Oct 25, 2007, 10:59 pm\n\nWhen Rabbit Howls By Truddi Chase. Another horrible story of child abuse. :o( In second place in a similar vein (terrible childhoods) is Running with Scissors--although in this memoir I was most disturbed by the utter lack of guidance and protection offered to a child's life run amuck as he's left to his own pitiful devices. And to try and portray it as humorous was also disturbing to me.\n\nI'm trying to think of which horror novel bothered me most but I tend to shy away from gruesome for the heck of it type books.\n\n25sarahemmm\n\nOct 26, 2007, 2:37 am\n\nAs a child Knock Three Times had me completely terrified! Interestingly, I recently met someone else who had had the same reaction to it.\n\nIn more recent reading, I tend to agree about We Need to Talk About Kevin - I found the mother particularly disturbing.\n\n27raggedtig\n\nOct 26, 2007, 4:09 am\n\n#24 thatbooksmell I have to agree with you on When Rabbit Howls. I just finished that a month ago and it just made me cringe picturing what that poor woman went through. Another one for non-fiction would have to be Hot House about the prisoners in Leavenworth.\n\nFor fiction, Suffer the Children was very eerie and just creepy. Kids eating human flesh and other grotesque things. Made me not want to have kids...LOL But I had 2 anyway.\n\n28frogbelly\n\nOct 26, 2007, 4:14 am\n\nIn Cold Blood stuck with me for a long time. I found it absolutely terrifying. The little glimpses of kindness and humanity in Smith were nearly as troublesome and upsetting as the murders themselves. I shudder thinking about it.\n\n29DLSmithies\n\nOct 26, 2007, 7:43 am\n\nI second The Handmaid's Tale and In Cold Blood. I haven't read The Wasp Factory but lots of people tell me it's flippin creepy.\n\nCan I add Lord of the Flies, just because for a long time after reading it I couldn't look at mischievous boys in the same light?\n\n(Touchstone trouble, sorry about that)\n\n30prophetandmistress\n\nOct 26, 2007, 9:29 am\n\nDefinitely A People's History of the United States. The last 200+ years of American history should be taken to the ICC. If we had bothered to join it.\n\nThe Guns of August, about the big ol' cluster f*ck that was WWI is also really disturbing. Who let's soldiers march in machine gun fire and spends thousands of lives for a few yards of no-man's-land?\n\nHouse of War is really messed up too. It's unbelievable how many times we've been a hairs breath away from nuking ourselves out of existence. This book contains a lot of \"oh, my (insert deity who may or may not exist) listen to this..\"\n\nWasn't shocked by Haunted, Lord of the Fliesor 1984. Probably because I poured over my mom's medical texts when I was little and was just fascinated by pictures of compound fractures and abnormal growths. And I grew up on Blade Runner and other totalitarian fiction.\n\nBut non-fiction will freak me out every time.\n\n-the mistress\n\n31SqueakyChu\n\nOct 26, 2007, 9:42 am\n\nThere have been quite a few, but a recent one is The Ministry of Special Cases by Nathan Englander ...specifically at a point in the book in which I figured out what the ending had to be.\n\n32momom248\n\nEdited: Oct 26, 2007, 1:23 pm\n\nThatbooksmell I agree w/ you on Running With Scissors. While at times I was laughing and thinking this must be fiction, other times I was sickened by what went on in this boys life--it was just twisted and perverted.\n\nAnother book, although fiction, that disturbed me was Nineteen Minutes about a high school shooting. At times in that book I was in tears. I think because of what is reality in today's world and the fact that I have a daughter in high school now. Very disturbing!.\n\n33corgi_girls First Message\n\nOct 26, 2007, 4:59 pm\n\nRag and Bone Shop by Robert Cormier. It's about a young teen boy who is accused of killing a little girl.\n\n!SPOILER ALERT!\n\nHe didn't do it, but by the end of the book he has been so damaged by interrogation that he confesses. Frightening!\n\n34jkmansfield\n\nOct 26, 2007, 6:36 pm\n\nMost disturbing book ever is a tough call. The most disturbing book I've read this year is probably A Long Way Gone by Ishmael Beal. It is his memoir of his war experiences as a young boy in Sierra Leone. Disturbing and heartbreaking.\n\n35Lman\n\nOct 27, 2007, 7:55 am\n\nI was most disturbed reading American Psycho by Bret Easton Ellis so much so that I didn't finish it. It was lent to me and I couldn't get past the vivid description of violence to understand any point he was trying to make. When I was discussing this with the person who lent me the book, she inadvertently let slip the ending and I gratefully stopped reading it. But it stayed in my mind for a long time and I still shudder sometimes if I think about it.\n\n*shudder*\n\n36TeacherDad\n\nOct 27, 2007, 11:43 am\n\nAround 12 or 13, I remember being troubled by Lord of the Flies, thinking about it for weeks after finishing it... and The Exorcist gave me nightmares, probably helped by reading it by flashlight under the covers so my parents wouldn't know (thought I was so mature... then I wanted my mommy!)\n\n37jhowell\n\nOct 28, 2007, 5:56 pm\n\nOh easy; hands down Blood Meridian by Cormac McCarthy. Nothing else comes close.\n\n38bookladykm\n\nNov 2, 2007, 7:04 pm\n\nStranger Beside Me about serial killer (thankfully no longer with us) Ted Bundy. Geez, I didn't sleep for weeks after reading that book and will NEVER stop to help a guy wearing a cast with ANYTHING no matter how desperately he needed help! Eek!!\n\n39aviddiva\n\nNov 2, 2007, 11:20 pm\n\nThe Collector by John Fowles. Still makes me shudder to think about it.\n\n40oakes\n\nNov 3, 2007, 1:21 am\n\nThis member has been suspended from the site.\n\n41raggedtig\n\nNov 3, 2007, 2:51 am\n\nAnother book that really have me keeping the lights on at night and jumping at every little sound was Pet Semetary by Stephen King. I live in a state where there are Indian burial grounds all over the place so I'm kinda jumpy about it.\n\n42Jenson_AKA_DL\n\nNov 3, 2007, 10:08 am\n\nI pretty much stay away from anything that I might find too freakish or disturbing, which is kind of an odd statement considering I read mostly paranormal and urban fantasies. I guess you could say I'm more into the fantasy aspects than the horror ones.\n\nI know people will think I'm crazy but the book I found the most disturbing of what I've read most recently is The Giver by Lois Lowry.\n\n43devenish\n\nNov 3, 2007, 12:37 pm\n\nRead years ago,but for me it has got to be The Fog by James Herbert which was an awful book in the er,best sense of the word.\n\n44streamsong\n\nNov 3, 2007, 1:03 pm\n\nSophie's Choice bothers me still even after 10 or so years.\n\n45litasbooks First Message\n\nNov 8, 2007, 10:03 am\n\nI have to agree with posting above for (The Wasp Factory) by ((Iain Banks))\n\n46TeacherDad\n\nNov 8, 2007, 1:49 pm\n\nlita, try the brackets ... as in The Wasp Factory by Ian Banks\n\n47Revenant\n\nNov 8, 2007, 2:22 pm\n\n> 37\n\nI think McCarthy's most disturbing book was Child of God. Not because of it's imagery, not because of it's subject matter, but because of the way it's written. The way it has most readers kind of relating to, and even quite liking, the main character despite his abhorrent habits. McCarthy seems to have tapped into elements of humanity that unite us all, whether it be in beauty or ugliness or a bit of both. I think the ending of that book was one of his most effective endings. The message it's trying to convey is unmistakeable and is that the connection we have with the main character cannot be dismissed, no matter how much we try to suppress it or drive it away. We need to acknowledge its presence, reconcile with it, and move forward.\n\n48litasbooks\n\nNov 8, 2007, 2:36 pm\n\nSorry first post and I used the wrong brackets. Still not sure if this automatically shows up so please pardon the test.\n\n49varielle\n\nNov 8, 2007, 2:40 pm\n\nBarry Hannah wrote a short story collection called Bats out of Hell. The story which I believe was called \"The Bats out of Hell Division\", did not let me get to sleep that night. It was a particularly bloody, and disturbing Civil War tale.\n\n50MerryMary\n\nNov 8, 2007, 2:57 pm\n\nlita: Welcome aboard - and yes, it does show up automatically.\n\n51karenk\n\nNov 8, 2007, 3:25 pm\n\n> 47\n\nI agree with Child of God by Cormac McCarthy. I had been reading a bunch of his books, but I had to take a break after that one. I am looking forward to the Coen Brothers' movie version of No Country for Old Men. I loved that book (also disturbing, but I liked the Sheriff's voice).\n\n52stephmo\n\nNov 8, 2007, 3:55 pm\n\nI've got to go with The Grizzly Maze by Nick Jans. Simply becuase even though I'd seen the documentary (and was already horrified, saddened and angry at Mr. Tradwell's folly), they'd gone to great pains to not use the audio discovered at the campsite.\n\nIn the book, the author describes the audio in technicolor detail - I actually had a nightmare that I believe represented a fairly accurate depiction of what happened to the two of them when the bears attacked.\n\nIn the end, still horrified, saddened and angry but with worse picutres in my head.\n\n53Revenant\n\nNov 8, 2007, 4:27 pm\n\n>47 Revenant:\n\nJohn Hillcoat is also directing an adaptation of The Road. If you are familiar with Hillcoat's previous film \"The Proposition\" you'd see why the paring of him and McCarthy's work is perfect. If this is successful I hope he undertakes an adaptation of Blood Meridian. The books are always better of course but, I'd love to see McCarthy's other notable books reach a wider audience. All the Pretty Horses is all right but I don't consider it his best.\n\n54krolik\n\nNov 8, 2007, 4:41 pm\n\nCan't say a whole book but Isaac Babel's collected short stories, when in the vengeful Cossack mode, show some of the depths of human nature. The sex scene in Hamsun's |Hunger will also give pause.\n\nSome of the examples cited in earlier posts seem like wardrobe disfunction episodes in comparison.\n\n55libraryclerk\n\nNov 8, 2007, 4:45 pm\n\nI agree with you on The Giver. And as you, I try to stay away from those that would be too disturbing to me. Though as everyone knows you can't always tell what a book will hold until you get into it. I also agree with those that listed the Lord of the Flies, The Exocist, In Cold Bood, and this one that hasn't been mentioned yet This Present Darkness by Frank E. Peretti.\n\n56littlegeek\n\nNov 8, 2007, 7:09 pm\n\nOut. Coudn't finish it.\n\nGeek Love is one of my all-time favourite books. (My username is a tribute.)

The book made me consider how deeply \"the military\" secretly maintains control. It's a very frightening read...even today...I would guess. I know this was fiction, but it was based on the author's experiences of being a student within a military academy. To me, it was most amazing that he was not too frightened by \"The Establishment\" to publish this book.\n\nHas anyone else here read it?\n\n--> 56\n\nI relished Geek Love, too! I think the author had an excellent point.\n\n62tim_watkinson\n\nNov 9, 2007, 12:15 pm\n\nToni Morrison's Beloved.

But after reading it, I was very wary of the other boys on the playground...\n\n64dempsterstreet\n\nNov 9, 2007, 2:41 pm\n\nZombie by Joyce Carol Oates.

Rape a Love Story by Joyce Carol Oates\n\n2. We Need to Talk About Kevin by Lionel Shriver\n\n3. The Handmaids Tale by Margaret Atwood\n\nDisturbing yes, but all three also powerful and thought-provoking. The Handmaids Tale is a watershed book for me.\n\noh, yeah, anything about the Bush administration...:-)\n\n72Zmrzlina\n\nNov 10, 2007, 8:21 pm\n\nGeek Love, The Collector, Perfume and Lord of the Flies are for sure up there on the disturbing shelf, but I enjoyed them all. Geek Love is a favorite, although I alternate between throwing it against the wall and hugging it close. The movie version of The Collector is fabulous, too.\n\nLove You Forever is disturbing in the worst possible way. I don't like that book at all. True story... I was working in a bookstore and a man bought many copies of that book. I commented that I didn't like it very much, but some of Munsch's other stories, like Paper Bag Princess are fabulous. The guy asked why I didn't like it and I said it was creepy. He told me he is Munsch's brother. He was quite convincing. I kept my composure and said that it didn't matter, I still didn't like that book.\n\n73Mel723\n\nEdited: Nov 11, 2007, 7:10 pm\n\nI agree with a few of you that Haunted by Chuck Palahniuk was, by far, the most disturbing book I've ever read. Palahniuk is cringe-worthy to begin with, but Haunted went above and beyond the bar of disturbance.\n\n74Zmrzlina\n\nNov 15, 2007, 9:37 pm\n\nGot another one for the list... The Housekeeper by Melanie Wallace. Yikes... beautiful prose but very, very disturbing. One character, a teenage boy, commits hideous acts against his family and Wallace manages to describe it all in stark language that bares the brutality without an ounce of judgment. This has all the horror of Perfume, though the characters in The Housekeeper are even scarier than Grenouille in Perfume.\n\n75januaryw\n\nNov 17, 2007, 10:07 am\n\nMessage 72: Zmrzlina\n\nHa!

Terrible, terrible thing happens near the end.\n\n79Akiyama\n\nNov 22, 2007, 2:13 pm\n\nBooks about the real world tend to disturb me much more than fiction. I just finished reading what is probably the scariest book I've ever read - Six Degrees by Mark Lynas, about global warming. The book desribes how things might change on earth with if the climate warms by one degree, two degrees etc. then discusses how likely different levels of warming are, what would cause them, and how we might avoid them.\n\nBasically, the author says that there are a number of \"tipping points\" which, once triggered by rising temeratures, will cause the climate to heat up even more, regardless of anything we do, that we have already passed the first of those tipping points (a reduction in snow and ice - which reflects sunlight back into space, helping cool the earth), and that the sort of changes now necessary to avoid \"runaway global warming\" - ending in the extinction of almost all life on earth - will be impossible to carry out in time due to their being politically unacceptable.\n\nDoubly disturbing because, firstly, I recently read The Revenge of Gaia for the second time, which says basically the same thing, and secondly, the news on the radio this morning was of govenment plans to build another runway at Heathrow Airport, because it sees increased air travel as vital for Britain's future economic growth. This a couple of days after Gordon Brown made a speech about how committed the government is to tackling climate change.\n\nAnyway, I urge everyone to read Six Degrees. Forewarned is forearmed. Move to Canada now and avoid the rush!\n\n80SaintSunniva\n\nNov 22, 2007, 9:39 pm\n\n#42 The Giver is creepy, I agree. And In Cold Blood has pretty much cured me of ever wanting to have a farm in the country. Left to Tell by Immaculee Ilibagiza with its description of ever-increasing murderous propagandizing on the radio before the terrible events occurred...and how the victims simply didn't believe it could really happen -- even though in their parents' lifetime it had happened before (although not as terribly).\n\nI generally stay away from things I might find too disturbing, too. But there are exceptions, as above.\n\n81BookBindingBobby\n\nNov 22, 2007, 10:27 pm\n\nWell, this isn't a book, it is a short story, but it disturbed me nonetheless.

I never finished the series and that, for me, is unusual. I do remember deciding to learn about the Inquisition as a college student. I can't remember what books I read (several from the library), but I had nightmares for weeks. I think my tendency to read mostly lighter (i.e. not \"serious\") \" fiction may be an attempt to ameliorate overdoses of history.

It was an up close and personal look at supposedly civilized people doing monstrous things. Almost as disturbing as the perpetrators were the experiences of the survivors. In one incident the doctors are trying out a new method for killing and being assisted by prisoners from the camp. Then the father of one of the prisoner helpers walks in to be killed. They know if they say anything they will both be killed. The father is killed and the son survives, no blame to the son. The father wanted the son to survive and they were living in the twisted reality of the death camps. The high suicide rate of the survivors is no surprise. I never finished the book.\n\nThe most disturbing fiction I recall is H. P. Lovecraft Tales published by Library of America. To evoke terror is Lovecraft's sole goal. He is effective.

However, I feel compelled to mention the book I am currently reading.\n\nThis book, As Nature Made Him by John Colapinto, is the true story (which was once written as an award-winning Rolling Stone magazine article) about an 8-month-old child (the older boy in a set of twins) who had his penis accidently amputated during a botched circumcision and had his childhood/life terrorized and ruined by a famous Johns Hopkins psychiatrist/sexologist. It makes me wonder about some unscrupulous practitioners of psychiatry.\n\nI'm only halfway through this book, but I feel so very sad for this child and his family who really knew very little about how to deal with the unfortunate situation in which they found themselves. :-(\n\n103beschrich\n\nNov 26, 2007, 11:20 pm\n\nLear by Edward Bond, and Blasted by Sarah Kane, two plays with such extreme violence in them that I can't even imagine seeing them staged.\n\n104Just1MoreBook\n\nNov 27, 2007, 12:08 am\n\nAlthough the subject matter of Running with Scissors is tragic (unfortunately all to common for some portions of our society) I found the use of humor to be refreshing.

God, that was actually painful to read.\n\nSula by Toni Morrison, probably because I read it so young. Night by Elie Weisel gave me nightmares when I first read it, but that might have been because of the age again. When I was 8 and 9, my mom would just give me money and let me get whatever I wanted from the bookstore. She never looked at what I was reading. That led to a lot of interesting picks that were probably a little heavy for me.

I know the veracity of this book has been called in to question, but it is most definitely disturbing anyway. I was first introduced to this book, and its sequels, by a student. This was a boy in 7th grade who was always bouncing off the walls and could not sit still to save his life. One day he came in with this book and sat quietly reading all period. He continued to do so all week. On Friday, he laid the book on my desk and said, Miss, this book is just like my life. I read it that weekend and bawled when I thought of my student, and all children who have to go through that kind of life.

The Painted Bird was the first to come to mind--I don't think I made it through 10 pages before literally THROWING it across the room in shock. It starts off calmly at a dinner table and then someone reaches over and performs an outright atrocity on another person. That did it.\n\nA la Clinton, it depends on what the definition of 'disturbing' is--Kosinski freaked me out in a frightened disgusted way. Disturbing in a challenging way is a whole different topic. Beloved brought home the total helplessness of slavery in a way no other book had because of the incredibly personal viewpoint (particularly in the scene in the barn).\n\nby the way Out: A novel was the ickiest book I've read in a while.

It was very difficult for me to consider eating meat for some time afterwards... not to mention all of the horrific social and political aspects that Sinclair brings to light throughout the book.\n\n161janoorani24\n\nJan 25, 2008, 11:39 pm\n\nI read The Other by Thomas Tryon when I was in Junior High (a long, long time ago). I still get the creeps thinking about it.\n\nHeart of Darkness by Joseph Conrad and King Leopold's Ghost: A Story of Greed, Terror, and Heroism in Colonial Africa by Adam Hochschild were both very good books, but hard to read because of some of the content.\n\nThe winner for most disturbing, yet life-altering book, for me is Cadillac Desert: the American West and Its Disappearing Water by Marc Reisner. It shapes most of my political decisions, and even the choice I made on where to live.\n\n162Tay11\n\nJan 25, 2008, 11:50 pm\n\nnineteen min. was a disturbing book but it taught me so much it is one of my favorites\n\n163Tay11\n\nJan 25, 2008, 11:52 pm\n\nthe book Double Idenity was a disturbing on it messed with your head alot\n\n164Tay11\n\nJan 25, 2008, 11:55 pm\n\nI read a book about natzis called Natzie Hunters and it was very disturbing\n\n165bookladykm\n\nJan 29, 2008, 3:45 pm\n\nSaw Ted Kennedy on the news last night which reminded me of Black Water by Joyce Carol Oates.

I read a lot of horror and someone passed onto me a Richard Layman book.\n\nIt did what it was supposed to do, scary in places and entertaining enough so I bought and borrowed his other books. In every single book I had there was at least one rape and in some cases repeated sexual assaults.\n\nIt really put me off him because some of his stories would have been perfectly valid without these scenes. It felt like he has this really awful formular - pretty girl, crazy guy, murder, rape, murder, murder, rape, murder, vengence, end. He left me very disdurbed I've never read any more of his books.\n\nJonathan Carroll has been the same but his theme seems to be cruelty to animals. I liked his books and his imagination but he has too recurrent a habit with the animal abuse for my comfort.\n\n170GulfShoresLibrary\n\nJan 30, 2008, 4:08 pm\n\nGalapagos by Kurt Vonnegut.

I'll add The Informers by him as well.\n\nIt just seems to take such a nonchalant view of violence and disorders, especially among kids, which is more disturbing than the violence itself.

That book actually gave me nightmares, I woke up with a scream dreaming I was in the house. Also the narrator's insanity was too convincing for me. I started to feel like I was going insane myself.\n\n195CarlosMcRey\n\nFeb 13, 2008, 8:54 pm\n\nIn terms of inspiring nightmares, I'd have to say Thomas Ligotti can do it pretty consistently. I re-read My Work Here is Not Yet Done recently and had some nightmares where I knew an evil thing was just out of sight manipulating everything happening. Even the graphic novel adaptation The Nightmare Factory, which has its problems, inspired some freaky dreams.\n\n196zodiacdeb\n\nFeb 14, 2008, 2:40 pm\n\nI couldn't get past the crucifixion scene in Stephen King's The Stand.\n\n197rocketjk\n\nFeb 15, 2008, 6:43 pm\n\nFor me it was Under the Volcano by Malcolm Lowry, an extremely chilling description of self-destructive alcoholism.\n\n198marvas\n\nFeb 18, 2008, 8:08 am\n\nDark places by Kate Grenville, Grenville traps the reader inside the mind of a psychopath, it is utterly convincing, horrible and fascinating at the same time.\n\nIf this is a man, because it is still unbelievable that this actually happened.\n\nPet cemetary, couldn't finish it because of the nightmares it gave me when I was 15, and still haven't found the courage to pick it up again.\n\n199alk290\n\nEdited: Feb 22, 2008, 5:45 am\n\nI am such a disturbing-book-junkie - they are my favorite kind!\n\nI think the three most disturbing books I've read (and enjoyed) are:\n\nBack Roads by Tawni O'Dell\n\nCRUDDY by Lynda Barry\n\nThe End of Alice by A.M.

First published in France in 1928, this book makes Sade blush. Susan Sontag called it the \"most accomplished artistically of all pornographic prose I've read.\" And Sartre said of the book, \"Bataille denudes himself, exposes himself, his exhibitionism aims at destroying all literature.\" Having made it to the end of the book, I know I'll never look at eggs or eyes in quiet the same way.\n\n202aces\n\nFeb 24, 2008, 7:58 pm\n\nI recently finished The Road by Cormac McCarthy and I was depressed for days afterward.\n\n203rocketjk\n\nFeb 25, 2008, 3:09 pm\n\nOne more I thought of the other day was The Executioner's Song by Norman Mailer.\n\n204punkypower\n\nFeb 29, 2008, 1:53 am\n\nAnother one to add for me:\n\nAmerican Psycho\n\nI still have about 70 pages to go, but jeezalou!!!

There are also some videos of his interviews on youtube, but they don't even touch the gruesomeness and the cold calculating ways of the Iceman.\n\n208gorgeousbutterfly\n\nMar 19, 2008, 5:18 am\n\nmy sweet audrina by v.c andrews. so so so so bad. horribly written. i can't believe this has been published!!!\n\n209Thalia\n\nMar 19, 2008, 8:07 am\n\nThere aren't really any books today that disturb me too much.\n\nBut I remember as a kid all the books by Gudrun Pausewang gave me nightmares, especially Die letzten Kinder von Schewenborn.

There are at least 2 books out, but the really well written is Iceman by Philip Carlo.\n\n212TheNun\n\nMar 20, 2008, 12:16 am\n\n1984, Perfume and Wuthering Heights.\n\n213TheNun\n\nMar 20, 2008, 12:18 am\n\n...also Dracula. Both Dracula and Perume are disturbing in a good way though (erotic).\n\n214Booksloth\n\nMar 21, 2008, 8:29 am\n\nWow! Only just discovered this thread. So pleased to note I'm not the only one who loves being 'disturbed' - most of my family think I'm a bit weird. I think all my favourites have been mentioned - The Collector, We Need to Talk About Kevin (which, although I also loved Jody Picoult's Nineteen Minutes, makes that one look like a fairy tale), Lord of the Flies, The Wasp Factory, Sophie's Choice. Just to add a couple more (I hope non-fiction counts) there's also Cries Unheard by Gitta Sereny, then back to fiction, Senor Vivo and the Coca Lord by Louis de Bernieres, Under the Skin by Michel Faber, deadkidsongs by Toby Litt and The Bad Seed by William March. Mostly, though, just wanted to say thanks for all those wonderful suggestions from everyone else - now I can go away and be disturbed to my heart's content!\n\n215JacInABook\n\nMar 21, 2008, 6:49 pm\n\nThe one book that disturbed me the most was It by Stephen King. I read it many years ago and when I talk about it now I can still feel those icy fingers of fear moving up my spine. Probably because I've always had an irrational fear of clowns and dolls.\n\n216Booksloth\n\nMar 22, 2008, 7:36 am\n\nSo what's irrational about that? I hated circuses as a kid because of the clowns and, when much older, found that my daughter had inherited my fear of them (I think that was before she read It, though there could be a connection - certainly mine came from back when Mr King was but a twinkle . . . as soon as I picked up It I knew he had done a brilliant thing in picking a clown as the villain of the piece). So what I want to know is - is there anyone who actually LIKES the evil twisted piece of sub-humanity that is a clown? And why do people insist on inflicting them on innocent kids? Sick, sick, sick! (Apologies to any clowns who are LT members.)\n\n217JacInABook\n\nEdited: Mar 22, 2008, 8:54 am\n\nTo be honest I suppose it's not irrational, both dolls and clowns are hiding the real them behind painted faces, I don't particularly like mime's either thinking about it, plus my mother collected those china dolls and one of my sisters collected clowns, I was surrounded by them from a very early age.\n\nTrips to the circus for me were completely out unless the family wanted a tantrum, with screaming and stamping of feet and crying because the clowns were \"bad men\".\n\n218kaelirenee\n\nMar 22, 2008, 10:33 am\n\nHands down, American Psycho was the most disturbing book I've ever read. When I read it, I was working on a degree in forensic science, so I could perfectly picture everything happening and imagine working up the crime scene later, plus I'm a woman so some of the scenes were just WAY WAY too disturbing for me. To top it off, Christian Bale has been my celeb crush since I was 12 years old and I'd seen the movie version before reading the book so of course, it was his face the whole time.\n\nI also used to read quite a few non-fics about WWII and there was one about the (I think) the Dutch Resistance that was just too real and too well-written to even finish. To this day, I can't read WWII non-fic.\n\n219Booksloth\n\nMar 22, 2008, 12:47 pm\n\n217 'Trips to the circus for me were completely out unless the family wanted a tantrum, with screaming and stamping of feet and crying because the clowns were \"bad men\".\n\nGood for you Imp!

So that always makes me wonder...why are they still around??? I completely agree with you on his choice of villain, and for years after seeing the movie (which I first saw when I was 4 or 5) every time I had to take a shower I would stand as far away from the shower as possible, reach way way out, barely touch the shower curtain, and yank it back, because I was positive that there was a clown hiding in the drain! This went on well into my teen years.\n\nCletis: sweet! What kind of roles did they have, if you don't mind sharing?\n\n224Bunbury\n\nMar 24, 2008, 5:26 am\n\nI'd have to say American Psycho.

I just read Boy by R D and will now look for Pig.\n\n226karenmarie\n\nApr 3, 2008, 12:59 pm\n\nThe Silence of the Lambs absolutely. I can read lots of strange stuff and be okay, but for some readon Hannibal Lechter gives me the willies. Every time I see another book by Thomas Harris I say \"I don't think so.\"\n\nClowns are very creepy. My mother-in-law gave me a painting of clowns for my daughter's bedroom. My daughter didn't mind, but I always hated looking at them. I was very glad when she outgrew the clowns and I could give the picture away.\n\n227Booksloth\n\nApr 3, 2008, 1:03 pm\n\nI always thought Red Dragon was a lot creepier than Lambs.

Clarice isn't in Red Dragon. It's the prequil.\n\n234AngelaB86\n\nApr 6, 2008, 5:32 pm\n\nThat's right, I got the two confused. Either way, the *main* character is the same, so I'm assuming I won't enjoy the book. The movie Silence of the Lambs was gross enough (cannibalism is one of those subjects I just can't deal with), so I'm avoiding any thing else in the series.\n\n235wcath\n\nApr 6, 2008, 9:09 pm\n\nI have to agree with #180... Red Dragon by Thomas Harris. It disturbed me so much that I could not finish it. In fact, I had to physically remove the book from my house. Pretty bad! I read Silence of the Lambs and although it was quite scary, it did not affect me in nearly the same way. Red Dragon took my mind to places that I definitely did not wish to go.\n\nAlso, Into the Forest by Jean Hegland disturbed me but is also one of my favorite books. Same kind of thing with The Poisonwood Bible by Barbara Kingsolver.\n\n236alaskabookworm\n\nApr 7, 2008, 12:16 am\n\n#52 stephmo: I know you did your post awhile back, but I agree that The Grizzly Maze was very upsetting in its visual nature.

Some conclusions are my own assumptions:\n\n>11 wester: -Perfume: The Story of a Murderer\" by Patrick Suskind\n\n>112 Malrose01: -Blue World by Robert McCammon\n\n>120 Smeagle_Monkey: -The Eyes of the Dragon by Stephen King\n\n>158 Ladybugsplendor: -Haunted by Chuck Palahniuk\n\n>164 Tay11: -Nazi Hunters by Charles Ashman\n\n>169 QueenOfDenmark: -Island by Richard Laymon, White Apples by Jonathan Carroll\n\n>176 SLHobbs: -Night Shift by Stephen King\n\n>179 DeusXMachina: -Russian Fairy Tales by Aleksandr Afanasev\n\n>186 ironmonkey: -Collected Short Stories of Roald Dahl by Roald Dahl\n\n>218 kaelirenee: -Things We Couldn't Say by Diet Eman\n\nI am not intending to maintain this profile, my work schedule is too unpredictable.\n\nIf someone wants the keys, I'll give them to the lucky person with too much spare time to waste.\n\n238budrfly9\n\nApr 7, 2008, 1:08 pm\n\nI gotta agree with LindsayG... What the heck was that book about anyway? I got lost (like I was actually in the house), but I continued reading out of obsession.\n\n239absurdeist\n\nApr 7, 2008, 6:52 pm\n\nFor N-F I would add Night by Elie Wiesel. The descriptions of babies being thrown into pits full of fire I still can't quite shake. That Wiesel witnessed this as a boy disturbs me deeply as well.\n\nFor Fiction I'd add The Royal Family by William T. Vollmann, an understandably little read novel comprised of brutally blunt descriptions of prostitution in SFs Tenderloin District.\n\n240Phlox72\n\nApr 7, 2008, 8:37 pm\n\nI just finished Thomas Tryon's The Other which I thought was wonderfully written and quite disturbing. I also found Perfume:the story of a murderer by Patrick Suskind to be weirdly upsetting.\n\n241alaskabookworm\n\nApr 7, 2008, 8:40 pm\n\n#237 MostDisturbingBooks: What a great idea! Thanks for starting it!\n\n242brlb21\n\nEdited: Apr 7, 2008, 9:23 pm\n\nExquisite Corpse, really there is just this one scene that utterly freaks me out.\n\nAmityville Horror I actually don't know if the touchstone goes to the correct book. The one I am thinking of is the original, I know there have been lots of movies and remakes, but that book is terrifying - I could not finish it. Perhaps b/c it is supposed to be a true story...\n\nAlso, to add a short story \"The Yellow Wallpaper\" by Charlotte Gilman. The reason honestly being this one particular line \"I always lock the door when I creep by daylight.\" It doesn't sound that bad until you read the whole thing. I was going to post a link to it online, but I couldn't get it to work.\n\n244Booksloth\n\nApr 8, 2008, 6:50 am\n\n#242 Definitely with you on The Yellow Wallpaper - a little gem.\n\nMust add my congrats to the person who thought up this thread. It is the one that provides the biggest additions to my wishlist - can't resist being freaked out!\n\n245petersfamily\n\nApr 8, 2008, 7:37 am\n\nI just thought of the most disturbing book I read before I read Ordinary Men.\n\nIt was The Turner Diaries by Andrew Macdonald.\n\n246petersfamily\n\nApr 8, 2008, 12:28 pm\n\nThis message has been deleted by its author.\n\n247petersfamily\n\nApr 8, 2008, 12:32 pm\n\nArmyAngel1986 has graciously offered to take over maintenance of MostDisturbingBooks.\n\nThank you so much, Angel!\n\n248cal8769\n\nApr 8, 2008, 12:58 pm\n\nThanks, Angel!!\n\n249Booksloth\n\nApr 8, 2008, 1:46 pm\n\nMaintenance? Please someone explain.\n\n251petersfamily\n\nApr 8, 2008, 3:08 pm\n\n>249 Booksloth: Maintenance? Please someone explain.\n\nThe books in post 250 are not in the library. I have stretches of weeks at a time where I work 60-70 hours a week, so LibraryThing gets bumped to a low priority. Last week was not one of these weeks, so I had time to blow and I created the library. I can not promise to keep it updated.\n\nI maintain, install and fix battery backups for a living, so I go from not-busy to swamped to not-busy\n\n(...Abby, Tim, if you're reading and you have one of our units at your facility or co-lo, tell Chuck Wearne \"Hi.\" If Chuck isn't your guy, I can fix you up with the best in Power Protection available. Is this spam or a TOS vio????)\n\n252ree-raw\n\nApr 8, 2008, 6:46 pm\n\nI think there are many different defintions of disturbing being used here, and I could mention many non-fiction (i.e. true crime) books that tell about very disturbing incidents. But the work of fiction that most disturbed me was Johnny Got His Gun by Dalton Trumbo. If anyone can think of a more horrifyng situation than the one the main character found himself in, I'd be surprised. And the novel has a very effective anti-war message. A powerful read.\n\n253NativeRoses\n\nApr 8, 2008, 7:30 pm\n\nAnd The Band Played On : Politics, People and the AIDS Epidemic by Randy Shilts\n\nGreed, venality, hatred, timidity, squeamishness, self-interest, and lust for power created one unconscionable act after another leading to staggering levels of suffering and death.\n\n254MostDisturbingBooks\n\nApr 8, 2008, 7:35 pm\n\nAlrighty, the catalog has been updated with the latest suggestions, keep 'em coming! Some time this weekend I'm hoping to make a list on Lists of Bests of these books, that way people who are so inclined can see how many they've read, and work on reading more. I would also like, at some point, to tag the books according to what makes them disturbing, but that will be a longer project I think. This week is busy for me, but once it's over the rest of the semester should roll by smoothly.\n\n255weener\n\nApr 8, 2008, 7:56 pm\n\nI love the new profile! It made me think of one extremely disturbing book which I have not yet mentioned: Level 7 by Mordecai Roshwald, which is a science fiction book in the form of the diary of a military employee whose job is to sit in a room in a bunker thousands of feet beneath the surface of the earth, waiting for the order to push a button that will unleash a nuclear holocaust upon the earth.\n\nSeeing the Dr. Seuss book in there made me think, \"Huh?\" but also made me realize that I was very bothered as a kid by Hop on Pop, especially the part about the guy whose sadistic bed is too short and won't let him be comfortable. If he pulls his feet onto the bed, his head sticks off the end of the bed, if he pulls his head in, his feet hang off.\n\nAlso, Great children's stories, Volland Collection. Has classics like 3 Billy Goats Gruff, Goldilocks, Chicken Little, but some more obscure and horrifying tales like Titty Mouse and Tatty Mouse, and The Lambikin, with some of the creepiest drawings around.\n\n256emaestra\n\nApr 9, 2008, 6:48 am\n\n#252 - I will second Johnny Got his Gun. Images from that book stuck with me for months. I also found it interesting that, as mentioned in the introduction of my 1980s version (I think), it had never been in print during wartime. Hmm.\n\n257MostDisturbingBooks\n\nApr 11, 2008, 3:00 pm\n\nSince I haven't read most of the books in the MDB library, I was thinking about starting a Most Disturbing Books group where people who had suggested a book could comment about why they suggested it. This would make it easier for me to tag and possibly put together comments on the books. Would y'all participate? Yay or nay?\n\n259Phlox72\n\nApr 11, 2008, 4:11 pm\n\nYay yay!\n\n260AngelaB86\n\nApr 11, 2008, 4:53 pm\n\nMost Disturbing Books group, open for business (I obviously didn't need a lot of prodding, lol).\n\n261Booksloth\n\nApr 11, 2008, 5:08 pm\n\nSure thing. Will be there tomorrow - off to bed now.\n\n262MostDisturbingBooks\n\nApr 11, 2008, 5:12 pm\n\nQuick note: anyone who had favorited the MDB library got an invite already.\n\n263Mr.Durick\n\nApr 11, 2008, 5:20 pm\n\nThat explains it. I did mark it interesting. I got the invitation right after I marked the group to watch it. Now I have to spend the weekend deciding whether to join; so much for going skiing or swimming.\n\nRobert\n\n264AngelaB86\n\nApr 11, 2008, 5:23 pm\n\nlol rd, I know, LT groups are all consuming, that's why I made the group and sent out invitations even though I'm still at work. :)\n\n265wildbill\n\nEdited: Apr 14, 2008, 9:39 am\n\nI didn't even read Johnny Got His Gun someone else did and told me about it and that was bad enough. A couple of more in the theme of how awful people can be, Lord of the Flies and The Gulag Archipelago, 1918-1956; an experiment in literary investigation\n\n266DFED\n\nApr 14, 2008, 11:39 am\n\nDefinitely The Handmaid's Tale by Margaret Atwood. I read it several years ago and I still randomly think about it and shudder!\n\n267bookladykm\n\nApr 15, 2008, 4:24 pm\n\nJust finishing up Exquisite Corpse by Poppy Brite, which is already noted. Wow. Finding out that I'm really quite a prude! Much more disturbing to me than American Psycho or Zombie...the necrophilia aspects are troubling to me, however, I'm managing to get through it. If nothing else, it's a fast read.\n\n268Booksloth\n\nApr 16, 2008, 6:04 am\n\nHmmmm, just came on here to thank whoever it was who'd recommended The Killer Inside Me which arrived in this morning's book parcel, and now I can't find any mention of it. Maybe I'm just not looking carefully as I thought several people on this thread had been talking about it, or maybe I dreamt the whole thing! Anyway, if anyone did - thanks, I'm really looking forward to reading it.\n\nRe N/F disturbing books, when I was a Psych first-year, the most disturbing things I ever read were all the Psychology books that mentioned the experiments of either Philip Zimbardo or Millgram (forget his 1st name) - the prison one and the electric shock one. The ease with which otherwise good people could be persuaded to do something they would never have thought possible really gave me the chills. I have now just bought Zimbardo's The Lucifer Effect: How Good People Turn Evil and am looking forward to being freaked out all over again!\n\n269MostDisturbingBooks\n\nApr 16, 2008, 9:46 am\n\nBooksloth, Killer Inside Me wasn't in the catalog before you mentioned it, maybe you're remembering it from a different thread? Thanks for the two new books!\n\n270Katie_H\n\nApr 16, 2008, 9:49 am\n\n268 > Let me know what you think about The Lucifer Effect: How Good People Turn Evil. I read it already, and I was very excited about it, but I found it to be extremely political. That would have been fine if I'd known it would be that way, but I really felt blindsided by the author. I wrote a review on it if you want to check it out .\n\n271Booksloth\n\nApr 16, 2008, 10:13 am\n\n#269 You're right - it must have been a different thread but I'm sure the talk was about how disturbing it was. I hope so anyway, as that's why I bought it! Will let you all know if it drives me over the edge.\n\n272Booksloth\n\nApr 16, 2008, 10:19 am\n\nBy the way - I really do mean to posts details of my nominated books sooner or later but it won't be for a week or so now - good luck with that, though!\n\n273AngelaB86\n\nApr 16, 2008, 10:25 am\n\nThankee Booksloth! There's no rush, it will be May before I can seriously get to work on the catalog.\n\n274kjlou\n\nApr 21, 2008, 6:13 pm\n\ni just really like the book\n\n275carpelibrisreviews\n\nApr 22, 2008, 9:34 am\n\nI read Yalo by Elias Khoury and reviewed it on my blog. I don't know if it was the most disturbing I've ever read, but it was the first to jump into my mind. You're reading about someone who has been tortured in a Lebanese prison, and who is now a serial rapist - and he's the protagonist! Very hard to side with him, but it is brilliantly written. I had to set it down and do something else at points, just so I wasn't too drawn into the darkness of it.\n\n276Booksloth\n\nApr 24, 2008, 3:09 pm\n\n#268 Well, I read The Killer Inside Me and it didn't really do it for me. I guess I can see how many people might find it disturbing but maybe I've just read too much of this kind of thing (protagonist as murderer - that's not a spoiler, btw, it's made clear right from the outset). To its credit, though, it is a short book and a quick read, so at least I don't feel I've wasted too much of my life over it. (Actually, that's bit unfair, as it wasn't a waste of time at all and was, in fact, quite a satisfactory read - just didn't do my head in as I had hoped.)\n\n277Booksloth\n\nEdited: Apr 27, 2008, 5:16 pm\n\nOoh! Just remembered another one. Factual books about the holocaust rarely fail to disturb me but the one I had to get rid of after the first few chapters because it was genuinely giving me nightmares was Hitler's Willing Executioners.\n\n278hemlokgang\n\nApr 27, 2008, 1:11 pm\n\nI have to add The Piano Teacher by Elfriede Jelinek to my short list, which previously consisted of only Lolita. it was disturbing for the same reason. It was so well written that I could not tolerate the pain. Exquisite writing, but just too much for me.\n\n279tropics\n\nMay 5, 2008, 6:28 pm\n\n#278:\n\nI had to abandon Snow Flower And The Secret Fan by Lisa See for the same reason. For approximately ONE THOUSAND YEARS, countless women in China were subjected to (and subjected themselves to) foot binding.\n\n280alcottacre\n\nMay 6, 2008, 6:30 am\n\nThe most recent book that seriously disturbed me was The Man in the Basement by Walter Mosley. Probably a weird pick for most, but it reminded me of how all too often \"normal\" people can be turned into something they are really not.\n\nJust about any book on the Jewish Holocaust in Nazi Germany seriously disturbs me for much the same reason.\n\n281farmgirlnot\n\nMay 8, 2008, 4:28 pm\n\ni have read BACK ROADS and CRUDDY...and found neither of them Disturbing in the least...if i had had a teenage daughter i would have given her a copy of CRUDDY...as a sort of anti-guidebook...but a damned good story\n\n282farmgirlnot\n\nMay 8, 2008, 4:33 pm\n\ni agree with this nomination wholeheartedly\n\n283AngelaB86\n\nMay 8, 2008, 4:34 pm\n\nI don't think anyone thinks a disturbing book is necessarily a bad book (unless it happens to be both). Sometimes the fact that it is disturbing is what makes it good; not all stories are meant to be warm and fuzzy, and some situations people shouldn't feel comfortable reading about.\n\nnote: I haven't read most of the books on the list, I was just chiming in with my opinion.\n\n284kaelirenee\n\nMay 8, 2008, 5:08 pm\n\n>283 AngelaB86:, Angel, I agree completely. For example, I thought American Psycho was a great book, but it was incredibly disturbing. But if it was a warm fuzzy story or if the violence and gore was toned down, I don't think it would have had such an impact on me or other readers. The movie scaled down the violence, but some things are missing from Patrick Bateman's psyche because of it (granted-I really DON'T want to see what was written about, especially since Christian Bale was the actor who played him and I've had a crush on him since I was 12 LOL).\n\n285kmstock\n\nMay 8, 2008, 6:32 pm\n\nI vote for Lord of the Flies - I found this very disturbing (and still feel disturbed 25 odd years later). The thought that normal and civilised people could turn into such monsters at the drop of a hat chills me to the bone.\n\n286Sandydog1\n\nMay 8, 2008, 10:21 pm\n\n>253 NativeRoses:, I thought And the Band Played on was an excellent study in epidemiology. Great book.\n\n287wildbill\n\nMay 9, 2008, 9:59 am\n\nI second The Lord of the Flies. What makes the book so disturbing is the truth that civilized humans are only one step from amoral barbarians. We look at Nazi Germany as a glaring example but we don't have to look that far. How is it that in contemporary America we have an ongoing debate about what forms of torture are acceptable in fighting the war on terror.\n\nIt is the fact that Lord of the Flies is horrible and true that makes it so disturbing to me.\n\n288Booksloth\n\nAug 11, 2008, 1:24 pm\n\nI just got disturbed again. This time it was As If I Am Not There - aka S: A Novel About the Balkans. Nothing more disturbing than the things human beings do to each other.\n\n289whymaggiemay\n\nAug 11, 2008, 2:20 pm\n\n#62 You wrote: Toni Morrison's Beloved. I just had to stop, it crushed me to know there were lives out there like that, even knowing it was fiction.\n\nAre you not aware that Morrison based the book on a true incident in history?\n\n#37 I would agree that Blood Meridian is the most disturbing of those I've read. Child of God is on Mt. TBR with No Country for Old Men.\n\n290AMQS\n\nAug 11, 2008, 2:38 pm\n\nThe News from Paraguay by Lily Tuck. I kept looking at the author photo wondering who could write this and survive it.\n\n293TheCriticalTimes\n\nAug 17, 2008, 7:05 pm\n\nWithout a doubt mine is House of Leaves by Mark Z. Danielewski. Never read such an immersive story about an ungraspable nightmare. A good second is At the Mountains of Madness by H.P. Lovecraft. A book that sucks you into an alien world and leaves you there stranded with no points of reference.\n\n294Booksloth\n\nAug 25, 2008, 7:10 am\n\nAnd Sophie's Choice. Did I already mention Sophie's Choice? How could anything be more disturbing than that? Everything else I've nominated has been enjoyably disturbing but this one just tears me to shreds.\n\n295Tigercrane\n\nAug 25, 2008, 3:04 pm\n\nThe Shock Doctrine: The Rise of Disaster Capitalism, by Naomi Klein.\n\nBacklash: The Undeclared War Against American Women, by Susan Faludi.\n\nMediated: How the Media Shapes Your World and the Way You Live In It, by Thomas De Zengotita (this one screwed with my head for weeks afterward).\n\nThe short story \"The Veldt,\" by Ray Bradbury.\n\nAnd I second the vote for Deerskin by Robin McKinley.\n\n296retropelocin\n\nAug 25, 2008, 3:20 pm\n\nJohn Saul is pretty good at disturbing:\n\nSuffer the Children and The Manhattan Hunt Club, especially.\n\nOnly one touchstone is working.\n\n297Booksloth\n\nAug 25, 2008, 4:11 pm\n\nI love this thread for recommendations! Mediated has definitely gone on the list.\n\n298renderedtruth\n\nAug 25, 2008, 4:49 pm\n\nI would say Art & Science by Dr. Leonard Shlain.\n\nIt was the textbook in a course I took of the same name in Berkeley at their community college. I found it very disturbing that a book that was so poorly concieved had a glowing review from the New York Times and the author was being treated as a visionary genius in so many places. The man is not informed on anything he writes about and I found that I could find logical flaws in nearly every assertion he puts forth in the book. I find it very scary that such a travesty of reason should be allowed to exist with barely a complaint from anyone. His book \"The Alphabet Versus The Goddess\" is just as terrible, on different subjects. It however was a critical dissapointment.\n\nWhat is special about Shlain is that he has no formal education in the areas he chooses to write about and he writes across disciplines. Which means he tries to tie various subjects from academia together in his ingenius imagination. What he has produced is a pile of muck. He is a leftist politically. He most recently wrote articles on the Huffington Post where he made character attacks on George Bush's brain based on his theories about left and right brain function that call on his proffesional expertise as a brain surgeon. He tries to prove George Bush is some sort of miscreant because his smirk shows a sinister fault in his character. Pandering to people's political differences obscures the idiocy of his theory, I suppose. I dissapprove of Bush, he says his brain is disordered, he makes a good point.\n\n299Dyrk\n\nAug 25, 2008, 4:50 pm\n\nAh me droogies...A Clockwork Orange is disturbing but still a classic...need to add it to my library list.\n\nWhen I was 13 I read It by Stephen King. I really wish I had not done that, because it seriously messsed me up every step of the way, but still I kept on reading it.\n\nRed Dragon disturbing but still a good book. American Psycho disturbing and still a bad book.\n\nMost disturbing book I ever read Eichmann in Jerusalem by Hannah Arendt. The banality of evil. How an entire nation decided to go psychotic altogether at the same time. Everyone was disturbing, the Germans, the Israelis, the Mossad, and especially Eichmann.\n\n301prudence2001\n\nEdited: Nov 9, 2008, 12:44 am\n\nmost of Cormac McCarthy's work would fall under this list. Especially The Road which I just re-read, and Blood Meridian, mentioned above.\n\nAmerican Psycho was a terrible book, a complete waste of the paper it was printed on.\n\nA recent read, 1491 by Charles C. Mann detailed how horrifying the encounter with Europeans was for the Native Americans, with over 90% of the entire NA population being decimated by imported diseases, completely depopulating vast areas of N and S America. That must have been horrifying.\n\n302Booksloth\n\nNov 9, 2008, 6:51 am\n\nSo good to see this great thread up and jumpin' again! And I'm now reminded of a jolly disturbing book I read quite recently - Monster Love by Carol Topolski - a kind of We Need to Talk About Kevin but on the subject of child abuse. The cover I have makes it look a bit like a remainder-bin misery-lit but it's actually well-written and very scary indeed.\n\n303BHenricksen\n\nNov 9, 2008, 2:50 pm\n\nI'd put \"American Psycho\" high on the list. I remember reading it on an airplane and being nervous about my neighbor seeing what was on the page. The only time I've actually been self-conscious about what I was reading in a public place.\n\n304LisaMorr\n\nNov 19, 2008, 4:52 pm\n\nNever Let Me Go - read it some months ago, and I can still reproduce the feeling of uneasiness as I consider what will happen to the protagonist after the end of the book, once she ceases to be a caregiver.\n\n305Booksloth\n\nNov 19, 2008, 5:20 pm\n\nGreat book! Great author!!!\n\n306AuntieCatherine\n\nNov 19, 2008, 9:49 pm\n\nI'd echo whoever suggested Ordinary Men by Christopher R. Browning how a bunch of not particularly Nazi policemen started out revolted by the Final Solution and mostly ended up as enthusiastic participants, not in the Death Camps but in the shootings which occurred behind the advancing German lines. Also his book on the implementation of the Final Solution - not as an efficient implementation of a long-planned action but as an escalating muddle of ruthless men each trying to out-ruthless each other in the solution of problems they had entirely created themselves.\n\nAlso We wish to inform you that tomorrow we will be killed with our families a day to day history of the massacre in Rwanda.\n\nbut if by disturbing you mean scary (or rather) terrifying, I offer The Collected Ghost Stories by M R James. Little Victorian slices of absolute terror that made me unwilling to get out of bed - in case there was something under it. I was 35 at the time.\n\n307GirlFromIpanema\n\nNov 21, 2008, 6:54 am\n\nShake hands with the devil by Roméo Dallaire. Also about the Rwandan Genocide, but from the point of view of the commander of the UNAMIR unit sent to Rwanda as peacekeepers during the failed peace process in late 1993. Dallaire writes about the development of the genocide, its historical roots and the way he and his men tried to cope with what was going on and trying to help, despite the major let-down by UN headquarters. The first non-fiction book that made me cry.\n\n308CarolynSchroeder\n\nNov 26, 2008, 1:32 pm\n\nI'll affirm We Need To Talk About Kevin ... both Kevin and Mom, incredibly disturbing humans. Took a while to shake this one. Pretty well written though.\n\nAlso, Glamorama by Bret Easton Ellis ... also gets my vote for one of the worst novels of my adult life (that I actually finished). Same old sophmoric junk from this author, but brutal/hatchet Hollywood stuff.\n\nWill also affirm Geek Love by Katherine Dunn ... read it years ago, but recall it quite vividly based on how disturbing it is. This one too was well written.\n\n309ainsleytewce\n\nNov 26, 2008, 5:06 pm\n\nOne fairly recent one is Pandemic by Gary Ridenour. He self-published and self-marketed this little book.\n\nAnother that springs to mind is Dying to Get Married by Ellen Francis Harris. I finally had to force myslef to get rid of this because I dept re-reading it and obsessing over it. Unlike a lot of true crime cases, this one had only one book written about it as far as I know, and no TV movie or anything. I suspect that it got covered more in Missouri where it took place. I read a lot of true crime, so I read a lot of disturbing stuff.\n\n310bookmark\n\nJan 8, 2009, 10:08 am\n\nAll of the Hannibal Lector books\n\nTami Hoag's Ashes to Ashes\n\n311beatles1964\n\nJan 8, 2009, 11:40 am\n\nI have found the book The Ruins to be very disturbing to me even though I haven't finished it yet.\n\nBeatles1964\n\n312lilisin\n\nJan 8, 2009, 1:35 pm\n\nI have to agree on The Lord of the Flies and how rules and morality can just die when outside of \"society\".\n\nOn a similar note Blindness which was also mentioned earlier is disturbing. During the pivotal scene I actually started crying and was so angry and disgusted that I wanted to rip out the pages and throw the book across the room to not read on. Thankfully I did and the book has stayed with me ever since and I have recommended it to so many. One of my friends has gone so far as to call it the \"perfect book\". Truly gripping.\n\nA recent read (as in finished it last night) that I found gripping and rather disturbing at parts was Fires on the Plain by Shohei Ooka. It is another story about humans being left to themselves to survive. Images of cannibalism are never pleasant, I'll just say.\n\n313JimThomson\n\nEdited: Mar 18, 2009, 3:03 am\n\nOne book that I had to stop reading was Stilwell and the American Experience in China, 1911 to 1945 by Barbara Tuchman. When I read that about one-third of the Chinese Army would die each year from total lack of medical treatment, malnutrition and malnourishment because the Chinese Officers were stealing and selling the soldier's food I had to quit. Maybe its just me.\n\nBastard out of Carolina also was horrific.\n\nThere is a web-site that is called www.everything2.com that has a section called 'Books that will Induce a Mindfuck'. Some of the authors most likely to cause this are: Margaret Atwood, Hakim Bey, Lewis Carroll, Adolfo B. Casares,\n\nJulio Cortazar, Don DeLillo, Philip K. Dick, Umberto Eco, Greg Egan, Franz Kafka, J. Gregory Keyes, Mark Leyner, E. A. Poe, Thomas Pynchon and many others. This list is worth reviewing.\n\nAlso check out all the book related sites on http://book.populair.eu/.\n\nI almost forgot. Does it matter if the author is Criminally Insane? About forty years ago I read 120 Days of Sodom by the Marquis De Sade. If you want disturbing, just try finishing it, even though about half of the book is just an outline of the mutilation torture that he intended to elaborate upon at a later time. I believe that this is called 'Psychopathic Literature'. This is not for those with weak stomachs. Ladies should avoid even attempting to skim it, even though he is equally vicious to the boys as he is toward the girls. All his victims were listed as fourteen or fifteen years of age.\n\n314meggyweg\n\nMar 16, 2009, 6:59 am\n\nOffhand, I would say Robert Cormier's I am the Cheese. However, I Remember Nothing More, a Holocaust memoir by Adina Blady-Szwajgier, and Thomas Hardy's Jude the Obscure is also pretty hair-raising.\n\n315jedziedz\n\nEdited: Mar 16, 2009, 1:05 pm\n\nDisturbing, haunting, depressing ... The Road is my pick.\n\nCheck out my blog:\n\nhttp://barneysbookblog.blogspot.com/\n\n316Jenson_AKA_DL\n\nMar 17, 2009, 4:50 pm\n\nIn addition to The Giver (my post 42), I discovered another really distrubing story in Lost Souls by Poppy Z. Brite. I'm afraid to read anything else by her.\n\nSometimes I'll just be sitting and zoneing and a scene from the book will pop in my head and make me feel a little ill. I didn't hate the book, but it really did disturb me.\n\n317RebeccaAnn\n\nMar 18, 2009, 1:12 pm\n\nI found World War Z by Max Brooks to be a very disturbing book. I mean, the scene with the people stuck on boats with the infected still makes me shiver...\n\n318Jayne49\n\nMar 19, 2009, 5:19 pm\n\nI vote for Dean Koontz writing of The Bad Place.\n\n319ladybug74\n\nMar 22, 2009, 8:46 pm\n\nSurvivor by J.F. Gonzalez is the sickest, most disturbing book I've ever read. Women are raped and cut to pieces and even a baby is raped and cut to pieces. It was so sick I could hardly finish it.\n\nThe Girl Next Door by Jack Ketchum would have to be a close 2nd, but not nearly as disturbing as Survivor was.\n\n320theretiredlibrarian\n\nApr 3, 2009, 6:14 pm\n\nThe Giver; recently The Underneath. Both kids books, both read when I was an adult. Makes me wonder what kids make of them...\n\n321rrp\n\nApr 3, 2009, 7:11 pm\n\nLife of Pi; it appalls me that such a dreadful philosophy finds such popular acclaim. My reaction is similar to Bertrand Russell's to William James's Will to Believe; take that path and it leads to many, many bad things ... ( ... trying to avoid Godwin's Law).\n\n322rdewar839797\n\nApr 3, 2009, 7:24 pm\n\nWas it scary because you thought we might someday actually get there, or because you realize that we are already there?\n\n323Copperskye\n\nApr 3, 2009, 8:27 pm\n\nThis is an interesting thread that I've only just discovered. I didn't see The Swallows of Kabul by Yasmina Khadra mentioned at all. I read it a few years ago and still shudder when I think of it.\n\n324rrp\n\nApr 3, 2009, 10:29 pm\n\n#322\n\nIf that question was for #321, the North Koreans are there already (collective willful denial); I sometimes wonder where the rest of us are headed.\n\n325Booksloth\n\nEdited: Apr 4, 2009, 6:42 am\n\n#321 Must admit I ruffled a bit at Life of Pi 'cos I just adore that book, but it did make me wonder in general (because, just because I love it, doesn't mean I agree with it) - is it necessary to share a book's philosophy in order to enjoy the story and the writing? I'm also nuts about what are probably the two most misogynistic writers (well, practically) ever to have walked this earth - John Steinbeck and D H Lawrence - simply because they both wrote beautifully and I get lost in the stories they tell - but I certainly don't agree with all (or even most of) their attitudes or philosophies of life. Just wondered how other people feel about that? Then again, I did feel that way about The Shack and anything by (hisssssss) Paolo Coelho (no touchstones - won't give the guy the publicity). What about the rest of you?\n\nAnd here's another 'most disturbing' - Do They Hear You When You Cry?. A must for anyone who thinks 'these things' only go on in third world countries and kept me having 'flashbacks' for weeks.\n\n326refashionista\n\nEdited: Apr 4, 2009, 9:32 am\n\nOff the top of my head, I'd have to say The Rape of Nanking, by Iris Shun-Ru Chang, The Historian, by Elizabeth Kostova (the end of every chapter lead me which this horrid unsettled feeling, only resolved by startin"
