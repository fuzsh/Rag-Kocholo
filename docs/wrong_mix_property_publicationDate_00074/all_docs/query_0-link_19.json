        "text": "(Cover for the 1967 edition of vol. 1 of The Moon is a Harsh Mistress (1965), Robert A. Heinlein)\n\nThe Portuguese painter and illustrator Lima de Freitas (1927-1998) created a vast number of covers for the Portuguese press Livros do Brasil. For more on the range of art he produced in his career consult his wikipedia page [here].\n\nA while back I reviewed Mordecai Roshwald’s Level 7 (1959) and discovered de Freitas’ amazing cover (below). More than any of the US editions, it evokes the claustrophobic tone of the novel (and even some of the surreal elements).\n\nAs the son of two architects, architecturally inclined SF covers always fascinate. Thus, as an introduction to his art (if you do not know it already) I have collected a handful of his cityscapes. They are surreal masterpieces. Lima de Freitas’ covers emphasize the city as a canvas, the textures of human Continue reading →\n\nI can’t pass up a Sheckley collection!\n\nNor can I pass up a rather unknown “discovered manuscript” type 1960s feminist dystopia by Marya Mannes. She wrote for Vogue and The New Yorker over her career….\n\nNor can I pass up a Sturgeon collection (perhaps I will appreciate his more radical SF short stories?)….\n\nAnd finally, a best of collection by an author who might not be worth exploring, but, sometimes short stories give a better impression of an author’s capabilities than a novel-length work.\n\nAs always, thoughts/observations/comments are welcome!\n\n1. They, Marya Mannes (1968)\n\n(Stanley Zuckerberg’s cover for the 1970 edition) Continue reading →\n\n(Robert Foster’s stunning cover for the 1968 edition)\n\n2.75/5 (Collated rating: Vaguely Average)\n\nDespite the presence of one of Robert Foster’s best covers (for more on his art: Part I, Part II), New Writings in SF 4, ed. John Carnell (1965) contains only a few glimmers of brilliance—concentrated in Keith Roberts’ short story “Sub-Lim” (1965), a dark tale of crooked people and subliminal stimuli. Isaac Asimov regurgitates something about a SF heist he scribbled on a napkin, Dan Morgan mumbles about alternate universes and tricycles, and Colin Kapp lectures on the “unusual methods of cementation of electrolysis” (54) instead of telling a Continue reading →\n\nAnother batch of volumes from the mysterious person with the initials KWG who ditched their entire collection at the local Half Price Books.\n\nI have rarely seen the New Writings in SF series edited by John Carnell on used bookstore shelves. But, as I am a fan of discovering new authors who might not have collected volumes of short stories, it pretty easy to justify snatching them up…. A while back I featured the covers of David Mccall Johnson, and now I have my first physical copy with his art!\n\nMore Algis Budrys… Is it my need to read the major “classics” so I can “rewrite” the canon? Certainly not out of any love for his SF (or criticism for that matter) —> see my review of The Falling Torch (1959) and my short review of Michaelmas (1976). I will probably read his short story collection I recently acquired before another one of his novels.\n\nAs always, thoughts and comments are welcome/appreciated.\n\nEnjoy!\n\n1. Rogue Moon, Algis Budrys (1960)\n\n(Richard Powers’ cover for the 1960 edition) Continue reading →\n\n(Richard Powers’ cover for the 1953 edition)\n\n4.25/5 (Very Good)\n\nPreliminary Note: I read the 1969 Lancer edition which was “specially revised and updated by the author.” Other than many overt references to the Vietnam War which chronologically could not have been in the original 1952 edition, I am uncertain how much was subtracted, added, or re-conceived. John Clute at SF Encyclopedia indicates that “early editions” deleted references to cannibalism. Perhaps he means the pre-1969 editions as it is horrifyingly present in this edition. I wish I read the first edition as comparisons to his contemporaries would be easier to make. Anyone who has read both versions or knows of a resource which lays out the modifications, please let me know. The idea of updating a radical 50s novel for a late 60s audience intrigues me!\n\nThe Long Loud Silence (1952, revised 1969) is a quiet novel that depends on the emotional impact of loneliness and trauma, and the desire for intrahuman connection Continue reading →\n\n(José Cruz’s cover for The Traveling Soul (1978), Hugh C. Rae; Carl Lundgren’s cover for Weeping May Tarry (1978), Raymond F. Jones and Lester del Rey)\n\nAround three years ago I put together a list of sites and resources that exerted an appealing gravitational pull…. drawing me into their SF depths. And it is time to add to the list! If you haven’t seen the original and you like my site I recommend checking it out.\n\nUnfortunately, a few from the original list have gone defunct or are on hiatus. I will echo (and amend) my earlier call to arms!\n\n“I love the idea of a community of science fiction reviewers–so I’ve put together a list of a handful of book review blogs focused on classic/slightly more esoteric science fiction. Obviously there are plenty of great sites I’ve omitted that focus on new releases or visit vintage science fiction only occasionally…. Or, blogs that refrain from reviews of vintage science fiction unless participating in certain reading challenges….\n\nPlease visit them, comment on their reviews, and browse through their back catalogues.”\n\n1. From Couch to Moon: Megan’s site focuses on classic SF (in addition to worthwhile read-throughs of newer award slates etc). What perhaps delights me the most, other than her voracious SF passion and intellect that shows through in every review, are her stylistic pastiches—for example, her review of John Brunner’s Stand on Zanzibar (1968) in his style: “This is sensory overload. Polemics in the form of ADHD. Part oracle, part Anarchist Cookbook. A graduate of The Space Merchants Academy, hold the cheese.”\n\nA sample of her reviews: a mini-flash paragraph Continue reading →\n\nA person with the initials K.W.G ditched their entire SF collection at my local Half Price Books. So many books that the store made a new SF anthology section that did not exist a few months ago and the “vintage” SF books made up more than half the non-vintage SF section. I spent too much money. One of many future SF Acquisitions posts featuring books from the mysterious K. W. G….\n\nA famous anthology important for showcasing UK authors in America! I’ve included the lengthy description of the collection by Ace and their position vis-à-vis New Wave SF. I find it humorous that the publisher has to defend their position!\n\nAn often praised 1950s post-apocalyptical novel by Wilson Tucker…. My 1969 edition was “rewritten” by the author–unfortunately, I have already started reading it (not sure how much it will tell me about its position in 1950s SF if it were rewritten in the 60s). Perhaps someone knows how much was changed? Admiral Ironbombs wrote a worthwhile review here.\n\nFred Saberhagen’s best known work.\n\nAnd one of the few Frank Herbert novels I have not read…\n\nThoughts and comments are always welcome.\n\n1. England Swings SF: Stories of Speculative Fiction, ed. Judith Merril (1968)\n\n(Ron Walotsky’s cover for the 1970 edition) Continue reading →\n\n(Cover for the 1972 edition of Recalled to Life (1958), Robert Silverberg)\n\n“I think the 60s and 70s were probably one the most creatively interesting periods for everyone. Art, music, film all pushing the envelope. New York City was affordable and fun, fertile in its influences. Book cover art, book jacket art was fun concept art, a bit more free than other illustration work” — Emanuel Schongut\n\nBack on May 19th, I showcased Emanuel Schongut’s 1960s SF covers [link]. His nephew found my post and put me in touch. Over the last few weeks I have had a wonderful discussion via email about his time creating covers for Doubleday under the direction of Margo Herr (art director + cover illustrator/artist). Emanuel graciously agreed to a short interview. He gives a behind-the-scenes look at SF cover illustrating in the 60s/70s, reflects on his own career, and discusses his artistic process. If you have any questions, I will be more than happy to relay them to the artist.\n\nAlso included after the interview is a delightful selection of his 1970s covers–a double post! I also recommend visiting his online portfolio for his more recent non-SF work.\n\nAs always, thoughts and comments are welcome.\n\nEnjoy!\n\nNote: I have made only minor edits for clarity and inserted publication dates where necessary.\n\nInterview\n\nThank you so much for agreeing to do an interview on your 60s/70s science fiction covers. Over more than two decades of producing SF covers for Doubleday, you put together an impressive body of work. They graced novels by some of the most esteemed authors of the genre, including Kate Wilhelm, John Brunner, Clifford D. Simak, Robert Silverberg, Keith Laumer, among others.\n\n1) First, can you say a little about yourself.\n\nThank you for your interest Joachim.\n\nContinue reading →"
