        "text": "Since my last annotated list, I’ve read twelve books, for a total of 202. With more than two months remaining in the year, it is possible that I will blow through my goal (revised thrice: from 104 to 120 to 156 to 208).\n\n■ Leopoldstadt (Tom Stoppard; 2020. Drama.)\n\nRead to prepare for Deep Dive: Tom Stoppard’s Leopoldstadt, presented by the Court Theatre and the University of Chicago.\n\n■ The Bacchae of Euripides: A Communion Rite (Wole Soyinka; 1973. Drama.)\n\nRead to prepare for the second “Theatre & Thought” series, Euripides’ The Bacchae and Contemporary Adaptations.\n\n■ Strangers on a Train (Patricia Highsmith; 1950. Fiction.)\n\nIt is hard to believe this brooding, accomplished thriller was her first novel. Related article here.\n\n■ Solitary (Albert Woodfox; 2019. Non-fiction.)\n\nReview here.\n\n■ They Thought They Were Free: The Germans, 1933-45 (Milton Mayer; 1959 (2017 edition). Non-fiction.)\n\nExcerpt here. I cannot recommend this book enough.\n\n■ Death of a Salesman (Arthur Miller; 1949. Drama.)\n\nReread after watching the stream of the Tony Award-winning Broadway production directed by Goodman Theatre’s Robert Falls.\n\n■ The Bear (Andrew Krivak; 2020. Fiction.)\n\nAs I said to my husband, it is well written and engaging but not as special as the many recommendations had led me to believe.\n\n■ Who Do You Love (Jennifer Weiner; 2015. Fiction.)\n\nOnce in a while, I just need some mental M&Ms.\n\n■ Survival: Another Story, Vol. 1 (Takao Saito; 2017. Graphic fiction.)\n\n■ Family Tree, Vol. 2: Seeds (Jeff Lemire; 2020. Graphic fiction.)\n\nI no longer remember who pressed Survival on me, but it was worth the time; and I’m not certain where Family Tree is heading, which is a compliment of sorts.\n\n■ Don’t Call Us Dead (Danez Smith; 2017. Poetry.)\n\nReviews here and here.\n\n■ It Can’t Happen Here (Sinclair Lewis; 1936. Fiction.)\n\nRead in anticipation of this. Review of the production here.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nI’ve finished twelve books since my last post, for a total of 190; my goal of 208 for the year is within reach.\n\n■ Seven Guitars (August Wilson; 1995. Drama.) ATY\n\n■ King Hedley II (August Wilson; 1999. Drama.) ATY\n\n■ Jitney (August Wilson; 1982. Drama.)\n\n■ Gem of the Ocean (August Wilson; 2003. Drama.)\n\n■ Joe Turner’s Come and Gone (August Wilson; 1984. Drama.)\n\n■ The Dramatic Vision of August Wilson (Sandra G. Shannon; 1995. Non-fiction.)\n\nAs I mentioned in my last post, Court Theatre’s 2020/21 season includes “Theatre & Thought,” four series of lectures by University of Chicago faculty and other scholars. The first four-week series, “The World of August Wilson and the Black Creative Voice,” concluded this week.\n\n■ The Bacchae (Euripides; 405 B.C. Trans. Nicholas Rudall; 1996. Drama.)\n\nThe second four-week series, “Euripides’ The Bacchae and Contemporary Adaptation,” begins next week.\n\n■ The Walking Dead: The Alien (Brian K. Vaughan; 2020. Graphic fiction.)\n\nHe had a brother?\n\n■ Caste: The Origins of Our Discontents (Isabel Wilkerson; 2020. Non-fiction.)\n\nReview here.\n\np. 223\n\nThis was the thievery of caste, stealing the time and psychic resources of the marginalized, draining energy in an already uphill competition. They were not, like me, frozen and disoriented, trying to make sense of a public violation that seemed all the more menacing now that I could see it in full. The quiet mundanity of that terror has never left me, the scars out living the cut.\n\nWe are told over and over again in our society not to judge a book by its cover, not to assume what is inside before we have had a chance to read it. Yet humans size up and make assumptions about other humans based on what they look like many times a day. We prejudge complicated breathing beings in ways that we are told never to judge inanimate objects.\n\n■ Monogamy (Sue Miller; 2020. Fiction.)\n\nReview here. A satisfying way to pass a Sunday afternoon.\n\n■ Level 7 (Mordecai Roshwald; 1959. Fiction.)\n\nWhat an odd time to rediscover this fictional diary of a nameless, button-pushing soldier.\n\n■ Dear Edward (Ann Napolitano; 2020. Fiction.)\n\nEarlier this summer, a friend asked if I had read this. We don’t necessarily read in the same ways or for the same reasons, but when I reached for a simple book earlier this week, I didn’t put it down. Sad without being (too) sentimental, true without being (too) didactic, it’s also filled with quiet humor. The main character may be a bit precocious, but then again, he was homeschooled.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading..."
