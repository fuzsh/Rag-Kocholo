        "text": "January 19, 2012\n\nI read this book during the 1961 Berlin crisis while still in primary school. Science fiction was already an addiction and I'd put away a book or two a day when school wasn't in session. Politics was also of interest since Dad had been a vocal supporter of Kennedy against Nixon the previous year as well as active in community affairs. Indeed, he took me to village board meetings, encouraging my interest in public affairs and reading of the newspaper.\n\nThe Berlin crisis had lasted from the previous spring and had resulted in the erection of the wall dividing the city and daily newspaper reports. I recall being frightened by one headline about imminent war in particular. Although fascinated by things military, the idea of actual warfare terrified me, particularly in light of the thermonuclear capacities of powers engaged. On at least one occasion I recall having run to Mother, crying.\n\nLevel 7 was probably obtained at the nearest library, out in East Dundee, Illinois. It had everything: military stuff and politics in a science fiction wrapper--a sure thing. It scared the shit out of me.\n\nSometimes I've marveled at how kids seem to enjoy horror stories, how modern kids I know gravitate to horror films. For me, the horror was contemporary politics.\n\nIt still is.\n\nMarch 17, 2015\n\nThis is one of those books that rewards patient reading--its cumulative power is immense. We follow the diary of a man who lives on Level 7 of a bunker where the best and brightest go in a kind of experiment to see how humans would endure extended life in isolation after a nuclear holocaust. The details of day to day life are interesting enough, but the book's best aspect is the growing sense of dread that our protagonist will have to do his duty in case of war.\n\nOnce he does this simple, unremarkable act, his life in the bunker is, literally, without purpose, and he and the reader await the end of the war above. But things don't go as expected.\n\nIn my collection of favorite post-apocalypse novels, EARTH ABIDES, ALAS BABYLON, and A CANTICLE FOR LEIBOVITZ are now joined by LEVEL 7. It may not be as richly-written as EARTH or CANTICLE, but in its stripped-down simplicity it has great emotional impact. It is a fine fictional warning about what might await those who are 'lucky' enough to survive a first strike.\n\nOctober 1, 2016\n\n***Review below contains some spoilers.***\n\nBleak. With no chance of redemption whatsoever. If you like happy endings, you might want to stay away from this book.\n\nThis book is quiet similar to On the Beach and Alas, Babylon, both in the era in which they were published and the primary subject matter with which they deal: nuclear apocalypse. While I personally found On the Beach totally unimpressive and a drag, Alas, Babylon became one of my favorite novels.\n\nSo where does \"Level 7\" stand?\n\nWell, while it may not become one of my favorites, it comes very close to being one. I found it scientifically more accurate than \"Alas, Babylon\" and \"On The Beach\". But in one department, \"Level 7\" truly is way better than both these classics. And that is: Depicting Human Psychology about War. Roshwald has described the human psychology about war with total (and so, quite discomfiting) accuracy, which is the most unsettling as well as interesting aspect of the book.\n\nThere are no names. No names at all. Enemy is called just the \"enemy\" and allies \"allies\". Even people living in the bunker are not known by what might be their original names. For example, the protagonist is known only as X-127 from whose personal diary \"Level 7\" takes form. He lives in a bunker named \"Level 7\" with 500 people which is 4400 feet underground. He is a \"Push-Button\" officer, the one that pushes buttons to launch nuclear missiles and annihilate the world when such orders are received.\n\nThis book is a scathing satire on war and the mentality which prevailed especially during the Cold War era.\n\nA must read for anyone who liked books such as Alas, Babylon and even dystopian classics like 1984 and Brave New World, as apart from the apocalyptic scenario, there is also a strong dystopian feel to \"Level 7\".\n\n4.65 Stars.\n\nOctober 2, 2011\n\nLevel 7 is the tale of a military man who lives in a bunker 4,400 feet below the surface of the earth. His job is to sit in a room and wait for the command to push a series of buttons which will unleash complete nuclear destruction on the earth. He is not told why he is to go into the bunker beforehand, and when he gets there he finds out that he must spend the rest of his life there.\n\nHe's not the only one down there. There are two more people like him who wait in shifts for the command to come. Then, there is an army of nurses to care for their physical needs, scientists who keep the air flowing, psychologists to pooh-pooh the worries of those who miss fresh air and sunshine.\n\nLevel 7 takes the form of this man's diary, the only thing that keeps him sane in this unbelievable situation. You never learn his name or the country of his citizenship.\n\nWhen the day of horror finally arrives, our man records the events and his thoughts and feelings, and he later discovers that the truth about this war is more horrifying and depressing than he had previously imagined.\n\nThis book might give you nightmares. However, it is just barely Cold-War-Era dated and far-fetched enough to not be as scary or depressing as it could be. It's insanely memorable and I recommend it to everyone I know who likes nuclear war stories, but I had to subtract a star for its sexist, dated attitude towards women.\n\nSeptember 3, 2007\n\nI'm not sure where this book would rank on my list if I re-read it now - but it left an indelible mark on the mind of my twelve-year-old self. Aside from weeks of nightmares about an atomic war, it’s influenced my opinion of every other post-apocalyptic novel I’ve read since . . . usually to their detriment, as none of them ever hit me emotionally in quite the same way.\n\nMarch 9, 2016\n\nA deeply sarcastic dystopian novel regarding the stupidity of nuclear weapons, decisions behind and behaviour of people involved. However, I have found the characters and writing too dull to empathize with the enormity of the act.\n\nAugust 31, 2018\n\nEro molto titubante ad affrontare questa lettura per varie ragioni.\n\nAnzitutto il tema trattato, la guerra nucleare, è importante e serio, per quanto troppo spesso dimenticato o banalizzato (che forse è peggio) negli ultimi decenni. Io ero teenager nei primi anni 80 e ricordo sia la parte finale della guerra fredda sia il disastro di Černobyl, il tutto sicuramente acuito da un'età, quella attorno ai 15 anni, in cui si è ipersensibili e i cui ricordi restano indelebili anche da adulti.\n\nQuesta premessa personale era importante per far capire che ho affrontato questa lettura non \"alla leggera\" e che sento molto il tema trattato nel libro. A ciò si aggiunge il fatto che questo romanzo, sconosciuto ai più, gode di un'ottima fama fra gli appassionati di fantascienza. E in questi casi il rischio di rimanere delusi è sempre molto alto.\n\nVenendo finalmente al libro, dopo le prime pagine interlocutorie, il racconto decolla subito approfondendo gli aspetti sociologici della società in cui il protagonista si trova a vivere. La scrittura in forma di diario, semplice e asciutta, è uno strumento perfetto attraverso cui Roshwald indaga e approfondisce, ancor più nella seconda parte del libro, l'aspetto psicologico dell'apocalisse sull'animo umano.\n\nLivello 7 è un libro splendido, senza una parola di troppo, imperdibile per gli appassionati di fantascienza. E forse anche per tutti coloro che pensano che \"l'apocalisse\" sia quella propinataci negli ultimi anni, l'avventuretta di improbabili ragazzini unici sopravvissuti di un imprecisato virus che ha ucciso tutti gli adulti.\n\nIl mio voto: 4,5 stelle.\n\nSeptember 13, 2013\n\n\"I am the god who pushed the buttons,\" says the narrator, a dull nuclear weapons technician who happens to be the proximate cause of starting World War III. Later, he apologizes for this atypical and unprofessional lapse into poetry.\n\nNovember 4, 2017\n\nEver since reading \"Survivor Type\" by Stephen King at what was most likely too young of an age, I've been a sucker for the whole writing-a-diary-while-going-mad genre. If you're willing to suspend the disbelief required of the best examples of this writing, i.e., how on earth are you still writing stuff down when you're insane?, then it can be a real treat, as far as I'm concerned.\n\nUnfortunately, this book is not a shining example of the crazy diarist. Although the initial premise is quite exciting, the execution is more dull than anything. X-107 or X-117 or whatever his name is descends into a bunker 400 miles underground to wait for an inevitable nuclear war & writes quite banally about his predicament. Luckily, a helpful overhead voice breaks down the different levels of confinement from 7 on up and the people who'll be stuck there, so he transcribes that to mind-numbing effect. No one has a name, only a number, and while I get that this is probably a plot device to show how cruelly inhuman the military can be, it basically serves to make it impossible to remember who is who or forge any human connection with anyone. Then an unintentionally (surely) hilarious interlude once all the \"buttons\" are pushed and the world has been destroyed by nuclear weapons; both sides, us and our enemies, get on radios from their respective underground holes & yell at each other for starting things. \"We fired at you just because you fired at us!\" \"But we fired at you because you fired back!\" and so forth. Luckily, towards the end, everyone starts dying as each level becomes contaminated with radiation. X-10-whatever becomes the last man on earth, continues keeping his diary, and the last 15 or so pages are really pretty macabre. It's no \"Survivor Type\", though.\n\nFebruary 19, 2012\n\nLevel 7 isn't truly a book that I just read. It's a book that I've just re-read, which is a bit different. With over 25 years since the first reading, however, my views and appreciation for the art intrinsic in the novel have changed a bit.\n\nFirst off, I should say that the copy I first read was without the preface found in my new copy. For first time readers I'd recommend reading that preface after the whole of the novel. It's rather heavy-handed in reinforcing the spin of the novel and rather ruins the ending for first-time readers.\n\nLevel 7 is in diary format, the words and thoughts of push button officer X-127 as he lives in an underground shelter. The naming (or rather numbering) convention is clever in that it allows the reader to identify him with either of the superpowers of the cold war era.\n\nThis was my first exposure to this sort of fiction, though I've read a great deal more in the intervening years. If you're a fan of the faux-utopian visions of Aldous Huxley, Yevgeny Zamyatin, or George Orwell, I'd recommend giving it a read. For the easily disturbed and those who need a happy ending, steer clear.\n\nJanuary 25, 2009\n\nThe book reads like a twisted version of Plato's Republic - a dissertation on the sort of society and people required to commit and survive atomic armageddon. It is a coldly logical social structure inhabited by emotionally stunted human beings, whose purpose is to be the push-button operators for otherwise fully-automated weaponry, and later to continue the species.\n\nParts border on parody. From their deep-hole bunkers, politicians spit vitriol upon their enemy counterparts, even after such chest beating becomes pointless.\n\nAs a warning and social statement, it is something of a relic.\n\nMarch 14, 2009\n\nKind of wish I didn't read this book. Don't know what possessed me to keep reading it. Worst writing style I remember in a while. It is clear that the author was going for a kind of satire, setting up straw-man characters to poke fun at. Didn't work. Don't read it, really.\n\nAugust 14, 2021\n\nThis book provides so much food for thought. It's incredible how humanity have to destroy what they have in the hope that they will win something completely unnecessary.\n\nOctober 30, 2014\n\nLevel 7 is the story of an atomic war, and of the post-apocalyptic world briefly succeeding it. Written at the start of the race for nuclear domination, in plain Cold War's mid-1950s, Mordecai Roshwald 's book was aimed to be a deterrent to atomic weapons and related politics. Overall, a frightening book that reads poorly; had it not been for the topic, a solid 1-star.\n\nThe plot is simplistic--the two world super-powers have both acquired nuclear bombs sufficient to wipe each other out. When the trio military, politicians, and technology experts realize that a second-strike policy (that is, a policy of being able to strike back after a nation's own annihilation, for example by launching a retaliatory and equally annihilating attack coordinated from an impenetrable bunker) is technically feasible, both nations act upon it and set up a set of automated tools. Only a few people are still needed to operate the infernal machine, perhaps to enable each country's leaders to override the automatic control, perhaps because it serves the author better. In any case, a hierarchy of bunkers is built, to host civilians, politicians, and military in case of nuclear attack from the opposite side, and, for a subset of the sheltered military, to retaliate with a devastating attack of their own. The military in charge of the retaliation are specially selected and psychologically trained to be capable of \"pressing the button\", the physical act of igniting thousands of atomic-bomb-carrying rockets through the push of one button. They are sequestered underground and wait for the order, which does not fail to arrive. The atomic war is fought and, as expected, lost by all sides. Powerful message transmitted: thou shalt not carry through a nuclear war!\n\nMordecai also raises interesting philosophical questions, about the nature of the individual, about boredom, about the psychology of being imprisoned, about the notion of an enclosed utopian state, etc., but the book is short so the questions remain without proper answer.\n\nUnfortunately, the main anti-nuclear message is not compensated by either believable characters or reasonable writing. There is also a problem of the morals present in the book being outdated.\n\nThe characters, besides being wooden in expression, lack believability - - always obeying orders although there is little stick, to the point where the reader can easily find the main actors as mere puppets. Where is the stick, when the place where the main action happens, Level 7, has been physically isolated from the rest of the world, for 500 years?! Why would the characters switch to calling each other by military names (such as X-107 or P-123)?! Where would such sociopaths be grown in the Western society?! Etc. In his 2003 preface, Roshwald discusses this aspect, claiming that the main actors are by design so inhumane. However, this explanation may explain the actions of his characters, but makes the story similar to the bad horror movies of the early 2000s, in which the viewer simply knows that the normal human response would have averted the danger. There is only one believable character, the neurotic X-107 who ignites three series of rockets but then refuses to press the button for the last and most destructive, but he has only an episodic appearance and is replaced without stopping the attack.\n\nThe writing is terrible, for today's standards. The text moves slowly and does not seem to match the diary format. The constructs seem also outdated.\n\nTo conclude: this is a book to read, but perhaps it should have been written as non-fiction, as a realistic what-if scenario. Read it this way and you may find it useful.\n\nMay 3, 2016\n\nWhat I found most disturbing about this novel was not the hopelessness of the Level 7 dwellers, buried thousands of feet beneath the earth, then assigned to annihilate humanity and continue living for 500 years. I suppose we've heard that story before and become dulled to the prospect of a fusion armageddon. I was more repelled by the personalities of the individuals on level 7. X-127 guesses that they must have all been chosen for their mission because they don't like others, and are all somewhat antisocial. Without any ties to the surface, the pushbutton officers can carry out their orders without hesitation. However, they also dislike the others within their own community, and are incapable of building real relationships on Level 7.\n\nThis was a first novel, and lacks some polish and focus. However, it is worthwhile as a quick reading experience.\n\nMay 27, 2019\n\nScritto nel 1959, in piena guerra fredda, questo romanzo mantiene ancora oggi la sua carica emotiva. Bellissimo, ci fa veramente vivere in prima persona la realtà di una guerra atomica, da cui non si sarebbe salvezza !!!\n\nOctober 14, 2014\n\nPretentious twaddle disguised as lame science fiction.\n\nJune 30, 2021\n\nKind of interesting: First published in 1959, a story about push-button nuclear armageddon, told through the diary of a guy, permanently isolated deep underground, whose job is to push the appropriate button if/when told to via loudspeaker.\n\nRoshwald takes every effort to obscure whether said guy is on the Western side or the Soviet side.\n\nIt's hard to appreciate, in 2021, the height of fear that must have been a constant background in those days of the Cold War.\n\nJune 1, 2020\n\n***4.25 stars***\n\nDefinitely a product of the Cold War era but it's a fascinating glimpse of the prevailing fears that must have plagued people during that period. Dystopian fiction mixed with musings on life, death and humanity.\n\nSeptember 4, 2022\n\nA book that causes one to ponder the big questions, from the use of autonomous weapons in total and limited warfare to what it means “to be” as a person in adverse and ideal circumstances. Merits multiple rereads.\n\nFebruary 13, 2024\n\nFeel like I just got punched in the chest. Read the diary first, and then the introductions.\n\nJuly 21, 2017\n\nAwesome book. Simply told, very powerful. I've been reading a whole lot of nuclear apocalypse-themed novels from the 50s and 60s lately and I reckon this takes the cake. It's beautifully written; the characters are distinctive and authentic despite being described so economically; the plot is brilliantly crafted and rings true; the psychology and sociology and politics and everything is just spot on. I really can't recommend it more highly. (I do recommend that you don't read the lengthy, scholarly introduction until you've read the book though, as it is full of spoilers.)\n\nSeptember 25, 2023\n\nDeeply unsettling.\n\nHopefully not prophetic.\n\nI know this last bit makes me sound like a cynical fool, but we just never know when someone will push a button somewhere.\n\nFebruary 23, 2014\n\nI just finished reading Wool, another post-apocalyptic book about life underground, and decided it was time to read Level 7 again. About ten years ago my teenage son and I both read it and agreed it was quite good.\n\nLevel 7 is written in the form of a diary. It is the diary of a military man who has been assigned to Level 7, a subterranean command post/bomb shelter that has been built to endure for 500 years if need be. The personnel who are “stationed” here are technicians, doctors, psychologists, teachers and other professionals qualified to keep this little microcosm functioning should the unthinkable happen. Needless to say, the unthinkable does happen. The order comes for X-127, author of the diary, button-pusher by training, to push the buttons that will launch the nuclear arsenal of his country, which remains unnamed, against the enemy, another unnamed superpower.\n\nThis book was written in 1959 while I was being taught to “duck and cover” in the event of a nuclear attack. Right. I just learned online, to my surprise, that this training began in the early 50’s and continued until the late 80’s. Apparently the first proponent of this measure was a Hiroshima police officer, and it actually was effective enough that not a single Nagasaki police officer was killed in the intial blast there (according to Wikipedia, anyway). But I digress.\n\nLevel 7 may be dated, but it is still a powerful indictment of the mentality that sees mutual assured destruction as a sensible deterrent to nuclear war. I can only imagine the impact of its message in the 50’s when it was originally published. In fact, I’m surprised it even was published, considering how subversive it must have appeared in light of the climate of paranoia that reigned at the time.\n\nJune 14, 2011\n\nI am so glad this novel is now available in e-book form. I read it in high school, loved it, and have wanted to read it again. I’m sure that beat up library copy was out of print even then. What? I just noticed it was published in 1960. No wonder it was in crappy condition and smelled of mildew. I am even more impressed the story feels so 2011ish.\n\nThe story is told in diary form, written by a missile technician only known as x-127. The story starts out as the solider x-127 and 250 other soldiers (men and women) head down deep into an underground bunker called Level 7. The bunker is an immense system of tunnels and rooms about 4000 ft underground. Room enough for the button pushers, engineers and scientist to continue our way of life after a nuclear holocaust strikes. The mood of the story is grim, as X-127 realizes that once he makes the descent down into Level 7, there is no turning back to the outside world. The government has deemed the soldiers in the bunker the saviors of our way of life. They have enough food, water, and air to last them 5 lifetimes.\n\nWell, eventually it gets to a point where a war breaks out. There are not descriptions of nuclear explosions, or fiery death raining down on the populace's heads. Instead the author portrays the war through the eyes of radar technicians and button pushers who only see blips on radar screens and are told via a loudspeaker on what buttons to push.\n\nAfter the totally destructive war, radiation spreads and wipes out life on the surface. A claustrophobic life in a bunker becomes stifling for X-127 has he watches and listens to his fellow soldiers start to loose it in a \"not so\" hermetically sealed bunker.\n\nThis story is very sad, and chilling. The last paragraph of the story has to be the most riveting.\n\nMay 13, 2011\n\nVery chilling book. I have always been obsessed with stories/films about nuclear holocaust. This is an older book, written during the Cold War between the U.S. and Russia. As was common at that time, the story focuses on the absurdness of the concept of \"Mutual Assured Destruction\", wherein if two parties are engaging in nuclear war, both sides try to completely destroy the enemy even if they themselves have already been decimated.\n\nLevel 7 revolves around a multi-level underground bunker that holds military personnel and civilians. The lowest level, Level 7, houses the main character X-127 who is a \"button pusher\". His job is to push the buttons that launch the nukes at the enemy if told to do so by his command. He and his fellow workers are told that they must live in the bunker forever and will never be able to return to the surface. The are given sterile names that coincide with their jobs and become very dehumanized.\n\nThe book is written as if it is a diary kept by X-127 and records his eventual decent into despair and madness. The war happens with predictable results; total destruction of the human race. At first the underground levels are safe but the radiation slowly makes it way down, level by level. The end is sobering and ultimately futile.\n\nJuly 22, 2015\n\nA little difficult to find a copy of this. This is a quick read, which surprised me. I expected a much worse novel, to be honest. I expected tedious preaching and vague droning. Instead, this is the novel that happens after all the faux-conundrums get asked. You know, \"If you got paid a trillion dollars if you just pressed a button - but that button destroys so many people... would you do it?\" This is that novel. Very clinical and scientific approach to the worst situation: mutual destruction via atomic weaponry. Two things about this book (and author) that make this an extremely good read: the details about the underground facility are worked out carefully and consistently, the argumentation to make the scenarios robust and logical is very well-written. Every aspect of this book is tightly wound around the horror of the atomic war. The novel hardly seems dated, which is rather eerie. Highly recommended for readers of Howey's Wool, nuclear war \"fans,\" and vintage science fiction fans.\n\nApril 4, 2022\n\nAllegorical tale that starts off slowly but eventually becomes engrossing and horrifying. The main character, who is faceless/nameless and at times acts as the author's surrogate, eventually grew on me with his philosophical ruminations on the nature of man, war, self-isolation, love, etc. The diary entries start in media res, which was kind of a neat choice, through the means of an \"introduction\" the \"author\" wrote about a month or so into his isolation in the bunkers. We then jump back to how it all began, him getting used to his surroundings, before eventually small bits start to happen before, well, the world blows itself up. There's not a ton of \"plot\", and the way it's delivered is very dry (it being recounted in diary entries) but it's stuck with me and is very haunting in its simplicity.\n\nI found the beginning entries boring and they rang a bit false, since it seemed to read as if the author was trying to give a hypothetical proposal for how to effectively build underground nuclear fallout shelters in the case of an atomic war. Everything is \"perfectly designed\" and \"well though-out\" and boy, those smart military leaders (or this very smart author) sure did think of everything, huh! It's very efficient, and there's no cracks in the system and hoo boy, maybe we should all listen to this Mordecai Roshwald just in case Putin gets a bit twitchy on the push-button, huh? I found these sections to be almost annoying in how self-congratulatory they were.\n\nHow wrong I was. It wasn't the author interjecting himself into the story as a means of potential candidacy for a government contract; on the contrary, it was to build you up, so that later you could be broken down. It was to show the gullibality, the undeserved faith in their leaders that military personnel have. Surely, everything is in its place for a reason! Surely, they'd thought of everything! Us down here at Level 7 are the most qualified, most important, most protected! And yet...by the end, we see that is untrue. In fact, we see that it was all for naught, as crack after crack begins to show. Is it man's stubbornness? Hubris? His individuality? Or the flaws we have in our understandings of psychology, human nature, automation, hell, even our own systems of government, organization, industrialization? In short: what the fuck do we know? Turns out, not a lot. Man thinks he hath control over all: man, beast, machine, nature. But we don't, and this book serves as a grim reminder of that.\n\nNow, where this book slips a bit is in its description of Level 7, insofar that it's, well, kinda boring. Like I get that's the point, but at the same time, I had a really tough time picturing what it looked like, sounded like, felt like, smelled like. There's not a whole lot that goes into that. In many ways, it read like it was really an underground submarine of sorts, with small, boring rooms full of pipes and walls. Even the \"lounge\" as it's described read to me like just a room with a couch in it (did it even have a couch?). Now, a lot of this may be on purpose, but in some ways it breaks the credibility of the allegory, considering it just doesn't seem like any human would look at that and go \"yep! this'll do!\" even with the proper amount of screening/training. Since the inhabitants (especially the main character) start to question their surroundings and the world that's been created for them, this felt like a bit of suspension of disbelief. All that is left is paper to write on and a 12-day looping track of music? I'd think even the most amateur psychologist could tell you that even the most level-headed (ha!) person would be driven mad under those circumstances. Especially if the plan was to survive for hundreds of years.\n\nThere's also the fact the book was written in 1959 that hinders it a bit, as the technology is incredibly outdated and doesn't strive that far into future-thinking to make it seem realistic. I think 1984 did a good job of thinking ahead in such a way that the novel didn't feel dated form a technology standpoint. I wish Roshwald had interjected just a teeny bit of sci-fi into this book, because reading it now it's hard to imagine how this whole thing would've even worked, if it's supposed to be \"future-proof\". Though it did make a fun exercise in trying to update this in modern levels; think of all the music one could fit on a terabyte hard drive! But again, this could've been remedied with a bit more description of the place. I can't help but picture the vaults in Fallout and how \"livable\" they seemed in contrast to Level 7.\n\nThere's also some funny 1950's-esque \"gender roles\" stuff that is a bit silly looking back on it. The idea that people on Level 7 should get \"married\" was funny, since it equated to nothing more than walking up to a woman, asking her, and seeing what she said. Not very romantic; and kind of ill-thought out, if you ask me, considering that I'd think love and sex would interfere with the \"perfect harmony\" of their underground shelter, but since neither really came into play here, I suppose it's a moot point. BUT! That's the issue rearing its head of there not being a whole lot of conflict in the book. I really thought I'd see more deconstruction of society, Lord of the Flies type of stuff down here, but really these military-minded people seemed to be well-trained or something, as there wasn't a lot. Only one character, X-117 seems to show remnants of humanity, which of course doesn't end up well. But I expected to see more, including more snapshots of the other inhabitants. For there being so many people on Leve 7 (what was it, 500?) it sure felt empty and lifeless.\n\nStill, the novel's strength is in showing how easily we can/will destroy ourselves. As Putin shows off his \"small dick energy\" invading Ukraine at the moment I'm writing this, gently teasing the notion of nuclear annihilation, I can't help but be terrifed at how quickly this could all go away. Why, it'd be merely the push of a button. Scary to think how easy that could be..."
