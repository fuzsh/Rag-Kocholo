        "text": "A large amount of literature exists on the diverse effects of colonialism on development, but studies based on quantitative evidence are still in short supply. We assess the impact of exposure to European trade and early colonization on human capital in the regions of today's Senegal, Gambia and Western Mali between the late-eighteenth century and the eve of the twentieth century. Figure 1 maps the area that we study. We proxy human capital with an index of numeracy, which is arguably one of the core factors of economic development (Hanushek and Woessmann Reference Hanushek and Woessmann2012; Baten Reference Baten2016). With this approach, we estimate human capital trends between 1770 and 1900 and put forward a number of interpretations about their determinants.\n\nNotes: The bold, black lines identify the approximate borders of the macro-regions that we take into account in our econometric analysis of the correlates of numeracy. The area of Direct Influence includes the Four Communes along the coast of today's Senegal (St. Louis, Dakar, Gorée, and Rufisque in light grey). The area of Colonial Influence stretches from the mouth of the Senegal River (Walo) to southeast Senegal, and includes the pre-colonial kingdoms of Baol, Cayor, Jolof, and Futa Toro, mainly inhabited by Wolof groups. The kingdoms of Sine and Salum, inhabited by a majority of Serer people, are taken into account separately. The macro-region of the Casamance and Southeast includes the area south of the Gambia River and east of the region of Colonial Influence. Finally, the Gambia and Kayes (in today's Mali) are included as separate regions. The underlined labels represent pre-colonial kingdoms, while those in italics show areas inhabited by the Serer and Wolof groups. The dotted area shows were peanut production became most prominent after the 1840s. Dotted lines represent rivers and water streams. Finally, the bars show the number of individuals that we could include in our sample from each region (see legend). Sources: Digital map elaborated by the authors.\n\nOur work is based on a two-step methodology. First, we estimate basic human capital by relying on the age-heaping technique. We estimate levels of numeracy for a number of macro-regions within Western Sudan, separately for Christians and Muslims, between 1770 and 1900. Western Sudan is defined as the area including Senegambia (today's Senegal and Gambia) and the region of Kayes, in modern-day Western Mali, which was called French Sudan during the colonial period. Second, we explore the determinants of regional human capital formation by drawing on the existing literature about factors that might have influenced the economic fortunes of West African regions before the turn of the twentieth century.\n\nThis new quantitative evidence suggests that the influence of European trade and early colonialism on human capital growth was heterogeneous and depended to a large extent on local conditions, factor endowments, and institutions (Austin Reference Austin2008a, Reference Austin2010). This heterogeneity is clearly shown by human capital indicators at the regional level within Western Sudan. Considering Joseph E. Inikori's (Reference Inikori2007) view, we first assess the hypothesis that the slave trade brought about a disintegration of Senegambia's market, as the coastal regions became more specialized and integrated into the Atlantic economy, while inner areas developed less dynamically. Next, we study whether this pattern was reinforced by the impact of domestic slavery, as well as French military campaigns in the early phases of colonization—before the Scramble for Africa. Finally, we argue that Inikori's hypothesis of interregional divergence can be expanded to take into account the rise of other trades, such as the peanut trade, after slavery was formally abolished during the first half of the nineteenth century.\n\nIndeed, the twofold analysis of numeracy and qualitative evidence suggests that economic incentives motivated by European demand for cash crops had different impacts across West African regions, depending on factor endowments and, in turn, the organization of peanut production itself. On the one hand, relatively high population densities, a more favorable climate, the influx of seasonal migrant labor from northern regions, and the limited reliance on slaves favored African producers in coastal regions (e.g., in Sine and Salum). On the other hand, inner regions (e.g., Cayor and Jolof) reacted to the incentives induced by cash crops by relying on slaves and extensive agriculture. This, together with the emigration of their labor force, growing regional conflicts, and French early occupation further limited human capital development."
