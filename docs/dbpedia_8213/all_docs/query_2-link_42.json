        "text": "Who are you (the long answer, no cheating by just giving your name!) and what is your profession (as in, how do you define it, rather than just the job title it has)?\n\nI'm a bit of a mess but I have some good principles, I think. I think almost everything is possible so I’m in a lot of different places at the same time. I’m also in continuous transformation so it’s kind of hard to answer. I’m the only one who can sit for a drink and a chat with all the expressions of myself, we are so many we started a business.\n\nWho would you confine with?\n\nI would confine in a farm away from the city with a team of like-minded people, and maybe never leave. Isolation is such a personal journey anyway. We (or at least I) are not very used to stay still and own our time as we do, now and even before. Using this time to actively work on ourselves or on anything else; it’s just so interesting to observe ourselves living with what we have, where we are and with the people we have around... with not much option to escape. You can learn and understand a lot of things about yourself.\n\nWhat's your work-from-home style?\n\nI’m really enjoying taking care of the vegetables I planted; I’m treating them like babies. Then I’m cooking a lot; I had literary never baked a cake before and now here I am making coconut cookies and vegan lasagna. I decided I would watch all the classic old movies I never took enough time to watch and I’m painting and making things. I’m enjoying having enough time to do all of these things whenever I feel like doing them. The only thing I really try to control is how and when I keep myself informed on things in the world; I give myself a certain topic I want to research about rather than getting lost in the stream of news.\n\nTell us something about yourself that isn't on your resume (a secret skill, a hobby, a previous job or fun fact about you).\n\nUntil a few years ago I was sure I could have lived forever without money. I was a bit wild and it was fun for a bit!\n\nWhat's the first place you'd want to go when it's safe again to travel and go out?\n\nI'll go home to see my family first. They are near Venice and I’ve been worried about them. Things are going a bit better there now. That's the first place where I would go once I can travel. And then I would go to the sea.\n\nWho is in your fantasy Zoom party (Skype or FaceTime)?\n\nOk, Zoom parties are a mission... but other than having Zoom parties with my friends or family, it would be fun to say hi to random people around the world and share opinions and experiences of this quarantine.\n\nWho are you (the long answer, no cheating by just giving your name!) and what is your profession (as in, how do you define it, rather than just the job title it has)?\n\nI’m a very patient person, what helps me a lot in modeling. My job is to listen and understand the people I’m working with before just posing in front of a camera. Than I try my best to help them make what they want to create.\n\nWho would you confine with?\n\nWith nobody, hahaha! Most of my friends work at the hospital, so I don’t think it would be a good idea.\n\nWho are you (the long answer, no cheating by just giving your name!) and what is your profession (as in, how do you define it, rather than just the job title it has)?\n\nMy name is Maikls, but that’s not all… Safe to say that I am a human. Still breathing and doing #stayhome. I'm a son, brother, friend and a boyfriend.\n\nMy profession as a model could be put in different words, but I could say that in a way it is a set of performance. In a way similar to acting… Different day, different setup; runway, clothes, magazines, photo shoots, designers, castings, hair, make-up, etc. Since all this has stopped, I try to stay home as much as I can.\n\nTell us something about yourself that isn't on your resume (a secret skill, a hobby, a previous job or fun fact about you).\n\nI used to play basketball for a long time. I started when I was about 6 years old and played all through high school. I was born into an athletic family: my dad was a professional volleyball player.\n\nFun fact: me and my sister, when we were little, we used to play dress-up and act like male and female models. Actually not my idea, but my sisters.\n\nWhat's the first place you'd want to go when it's safe again to travel and go out?\n\nFirst thing first… I would go out for dinner or hang out with my closest friends. My sister has been living abroad and it would be nice to see her and my little niece. To get back into traveling for modeling wouldn’t be bad either.\n\nWho are you (the long answer, no cheating by just giving your name!) and what is your profession (as in, how do you define it, rather than just the job title it has)?\n\nI’m Serigne Lam from Senegal, in the city named Dakar. I live in New York for 3 years now, I’m single with no child… for now. I’m a male fashion model. This really is a job that helps me to discover some city or country’s culture and traditions. That’s something I wouldn’t have had the chance to discover if I wasn’t a model.\n\nWho would you confine with?\n\nMy family.\n\nWho are you (the long answer, no cheating by just giving your name!) and what is your profession (as in, how do you define it, rather than just the job title it has)?\n\nI’m Coni. I live in Bendigo some of the time, next to a park. I’m a pretty good person; I’m interested in good and I like to think about what is good. It’s almost to say nothing, but I like people ❤ I’m a bit disagreeable, a bit lazy. I’m a model for a job only. I don’t know what to say, it’s a lifestyle. You are so free, and also a commodity. I like to move some, but right now I am playing a lot of chess & learning Farsi. I also love reading in the shower. It’s the staple of my identity.\n\nWho are you (the long answer, no cheating by just giving your name!) and what is your profession (as in, how do you define it, rather than just the job title it has)?\n\nMy name is Rose Van Bosstraeten. I'm a mother of an amazing daughter (she's 8) and married! I have been modeling since I was 14 and I own a shop in Belgium with my sister; we sell fair and square clothing for women and men. It’s called SWAY.\n\nWho would you confine with?\n\nI'm very lucky to be confined with my 2 favorite people: my husband and daughter.\n\nWho are you (the long answer, no cheating by just giving your name!) and what is your profession (as in, how do you define it, rather than just the job title it has)?\n\nHello, my name is Pablo. I’m 19, I’m 1m88 and I’m a teenager from Granada who loves sneakers, nature and discovering new cultures. I was scouted 2 years ago when walking down the street and I have been modeling ever since. That means I have been traveling a lot, meeting really cool people and working for the most amazing brands.\n\nWho would you confine with?\n\nI’m pretty good being alone listening to music, reading, watching movies, playing video games, … The perks of being a model: you get used to enjoy your own company.\n\nWho are you (the long answer, no cheating by just giving your name!) and what is your profession (as in, how do you define it, rather than just the job title it has)?\n\nHonestly, I’m just a young person still figuring out all the things I want to do with my life. I’m mainly at university studying law and philosophy, but have other interests outside of this. I’m also very passionate about gastronomy, fragrance, design and architecture. Modeling is a newer addition to my life; I enjoy the theatrical aspect of it and getting to experience part of the creative process. There are lots of parts to the job that you wouldn’t realize unless you’ve done it.\n\nWho would you confine with?\n\nI’m confined with one of my best friends, Indra, in our apartment by the beach. We’ve been cooking up a storm. I wouldn’t have it any other way.\n\nWhat's your work-from-home style?\n\nMy work-from-home style is all over the place. I’ll go back and forth between different tasks, University work, playing around in the kitchen. I’m trying to learn Illustrator to keep myself busy also.\n\nTell us something about yourself that isn't on your resume (a secret skill, a hobby, a previous job or fun fact about you).\n\nI try and regularly learn new facts about different places, experiences and concepts, and spend a few hours a week doing this in a deep dive at random. I don’t read many books as my attention span is pretty poor, but this helps me learn and I find it interesting. I don’t know if this is resume worthy but I still find it useful!\n\nWhat's the first place you'd want to go when it's safe again to travel and go out?\n\nSkiing. I haven’t been in over a year and I love it. I’m hoping the Australian snow season will still be up and running later this year. I also miss New York, and my Dad, stepmom and sister who live there.\n\nWho is in your fantasy Zoom party (Skype or FaceTime)?\n\nI have to confess I’m not a big fan of FaceTime etc. I think it’s a great tool, but I just don’t really enjoy talking on the phone. In saying that, if I had too it would be a call with Amal Clooney, as she works in one of the areas of law that interests me.\n\nWho are you (the long answer, no cheating by just giving your name!) and what is your profession (as in, how do you define it, rather than just the job title it has)?\n\nI’m a chill guy, always relaxed. I’m very open minded and always ready to learn from what is around me. That’s probably the reason why I don’t talk too much. I’m a model and that gave me the opportunity to travel the world, meet a lot of people, cultures and places and it really helped me to grow a lot. It’s not just a job like I thought when I just started, it’s more like a lifestyle.\n\nWho are you (the long answer, no cheating by just giving your name!) and what is your profession (as in, how do you define it, rather than just the job title it has)?\n\nI actually would say I’m still trying to find out who I really am. As far as I know I’m just a kid born in a little village in the far south of Brazil who’s led an amazingly cool and humble life in a small town. I didn’t like going to school but I had a lot of friends there, I loved playing sports. I’ve always been extremely good at all kinds of sports. The reason why I first left my hometown Panambi was to play tennis in the selection and then, 2 years after, I moved to the capital to play tennis in one of the best teams of Brazil. And that’s why I became a model; I was just doing my thing, playing after a ball, when I got scouted and the fashion world opened up for me (another super long story). But who I am right now, that is still being processed... maybe next time.\n\nWhat's your work-from-home style?\n\nI would say my work-from-home style is working a little bit on myself; spirit, mind, and health since living in Brooklyn by yourself in this quarantine is not that easy. But I find ways to make it funny. I try to read about a million different things, just to inform myself a little bit. I think it’s a good thing to be an informed person. I also try to study some other things I feel could help me in the future. I try to meditate when I feel too stressed out, or I call my old friends I haven’t called in a while. Just to see how their life’s going, which is something I really recommend; I feel so good talking to old friends on FaceTime. And of course I play videogames all the time; I had to find a way to be competitive since I can’t play soccer, volleyball or tennis in my little apartment.\n\nWho are you (the long answer, no cheating by just giving your name!) and what is your profession (as in, how do you define it, rather than just the job title it has)?\n\nI'm Doeke, I’m trying to do my exams this year but due to corona it's all a bit complicated, and besides my school I’m spending the rest of my time playing sports and hanging out with friends.\n\nWho would you confine with?\n\nThe perfect quarantine confinement would be with a few of my friends in a house with a big garden so we can sit in the sun all day long.\n\nWho are you (the long answer, no cheating by just giving your name!) and what is your profession (as in, how do you define it, rather than just the job title it has)?\n\nMy name is Serge. I’m studying to be a film director and work as a model. For now my job has stopped, but the studying process is happening online. I have a lot of homework to do, so my quarantine time is not so boring.\n\nWho would you confine with?\n\nMy family and me, and also me …well… did I mention me? ;D\n\nTell us something about yourself that isn't on your resume (a secret skill, a hobby, a previous job or fun fact about you).\n\nRight now my hobbies are photography, playing the piano, working out and running, drawing and reading, play billiard and of course study. (Sometimes I drive my car very fast at night, but that’s a secret).\n\nMy study program in university is film direction, so I’m trying to watch as many movies as I can about the film industry. I’m also interested in acting and I consider myself as a communicative, funny and interesting person, so I think I can become a good actor.\n\nI played billiard professionally for more than 10 tears (exactly: snooker). My father is my coach; he is working and coaching the best snooker players in the whole world.\n\nI try to read as much as I can since reading develops our brain and soul. Each day I read something new about psychology and write in my notebook what is important to me.\n\nI’ve always loved photography; my granddad used to be a professional photographer. When I go out taking new pictures I do it only on my film camera; I don’t know the model’s name exactly, but I know it’s pretty old and it’s a Nikkormat. It’s probably around 30 years old, but it still works perfectly.\n\nI draw when I’ve got inspiration and time, but right now I spend more time on study and other hobbies.\n\nI’ve always loved working out and running. Sometimes it’s hard, but I know what I want to achieve and I motivate myself.\n\nI used to play piano when I was 10 years old, but after 2-3 years of studying I quit. Now if I want I learn how to play some music on the piano by myself.\n\nBasically right now during quarantine I study and do my hobbies after, if I still have energy))).\n\nWho are you (the long answer, no cheating by just giving your name!) and what is your profession (as in, how do you define it, rather than just the job title it has)?\n\nI'm Jeenu, a 21 year old guy from Norway, but ethnically Tamil (Sri Lanka). I work as a model. I'm lucky enough to have very creative people choose me to present their clothes or star in their projects.\n\nWho would you confine with?\n\nMy closest friends for sure, I confide in them all the time!\n\nWhat's your work-from-home style?\n\nThere's no such thing unfortunately lol. My style is as non-existent at home as it is everywhere else.\n\nWho are you (the long answer, no cheating by just giving your name!) and what is your profession (as in, how do you define it, rather than just the job title it has)?\n\nI’m Najib from Somalia, but I moved when I was 15 years old. I lived in Italy as a refugee and then moved to Paris. I actually don’t have any professional skills but I work different jobs like sewing tutorials, at a restaurant, … and now I work at the same time with my designer friends, just to learn something.\n\nWho would you confine with?\n\nWith my brothers and some of my friends.\n\nWho are you (the long answer, no cheating by just giving your name!) and what is your profession (as in, how do you define it, rather than just the job title it has)?\n\nMy name is Valentin Humbroich, I’m 21 years old and I’m from Hamburg, Germany. I started modeling two years ago and I’m doing it as a full time job since I left school one year ago. For me modeling is not just about being ‘pretty’ but rather about getting into a different role for every shoot. Modeling has a lot of different kind of aspects and every set has its unique look and vibe that you have to adopt. Every shooting is a project by its own and a lot of different kind of people from all around the world come together and create something.\n\nWho are you (the long answer, no cheating by just giving your name!) and what is your profession (as in, how do you define it, rather than just the job title it has)?\n\nMy profession, in my definition, would be a creator. I create garments, drawings, songs, and most knowingly, help photographers and brands create images through the importance of looks, features, and clothing otherwise known as a model. So to sum it up, my profession is a creator... with many vast mediums.\n\nWho are you (the long answer, no cheating by just giving your name!) and what is your profession (as in, how do you define it, rather than just the job title it has)?\n\nI am me - I like to spread positivity to those around me, and I work as a professional clothing rack lol. My job is an easy way to do that because I am able to be around open minded and creative people all the time so I don’t feel restricted. Shoots are fun too because I get a chance to express emotion just with an outfit, pose or facial emotion. Sometimes you could be having a horrible day and then have your whole mindset turned around because of a shoot or the people there. I am very lucky to be in the position I am in at the moment."
