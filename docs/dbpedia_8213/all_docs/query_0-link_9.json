        "text": "Patrick Vieira (born 23 June 1976) is a French professional football head coach and former player. He is the manager of Nice. Considered one of the best players of his generation, Vieira began his career at Cannes in 1994, where several standout performances in his debut season garnered him a move to Serie A club Milan a year later. His single season in Italy was marred due to limited playing time, and he featured mainly for the reserve team. This allowed him to relocate to England, in order to join countryman Arsène Wenger at Arsenal, for a fee of £3.5 million in 1996. During his nine-year stint in the Premier League, Vieira established himself as a dominating box-to-box midfielder, noted for his aggressive and highly competitive style of play, an attitude that also helped him excel as captain of the club from 2002 until his departure in 2005. He helped Arsenal achieve a sustained period of success during his time at the club, where he lifted three FA Cups and three league titles, including one unbeaten. He then returned to Italy, playing for Juventus, but quickly departed after the club sustained relegation for their part in a match-fixing scandal. He then signed for Inter Milan, where he won three league titles, before featuring for Manchester City, where he won another FA Cup before retiring in 2011.Vieira featured at senior level for much of his international career, representing France over a period of 12 years, where he also spent some part as captain. He played in the final in his nation's victorious campaign at the 1998 FIFA World Cup, and featured heavily as the team also won Euro 2000. Despite also playing a key role in the side that finished runners-up in the 2006 World Cup, Vieira was used sparingly by France in the latter stages of his career, and he retired from international competition in 2010, after amassing 107 appearances for the side. Following retirement, Vieira transitioned into coaching, where he took charge of the academy at Manchester City in 2013. He would depart two years later, after signing for sister club New York City. His arrival in Major League Soccer (MLS) saw the team adopt a free-flowing, attacking, press-based system, which gained him many plaudits, and garnered him a move back to his homeland to manage Ligue 1 club Nice in 2018, marking his first managerial role in Europe.\n\nPatrice Latyr Evra (French pronunciation: ​[pa.tʁis e.vʁa]; born 15 May 1981) is a French former professional footballer. Originally an attacker, he primarily played as a left-back. Evra, whom manager Sir Alex Ferguson praised for his leadership, also describing him as one of the best left-backs in Europe, served as captain for both Manchester United and the France national team.The son of a diplomat, Evra was born in Senegal and arrived in Europe when he was a year old. He was raised in France and began his football career playing for various clubs in the Île-de-France region such as hometown club CO Les Ulis and CSF Brétigny. In 1997, he had a stint at professional club Paris Saint-Germain. A year later, Evra signed his first professional contract with Italian club Marsala, who gave him his professional debut. The following season, he joined Monza, but returned to France a year later to play for Nice. It was while playing at Nice that Evra was converted into a full-back. In 2002, he joined Monaco and was part of the team that won the Coupe de la Ligue in 2003. He also featured in UEFA competition for the first time in his career and, in the 2003–04 season, was the starting left-back for the Monaco team that reached the 2004 UEFA Champions League Final. That same season, Evra was named the National Union of Professional Footballers (UNFP) Young Player of the Year for Ligue 1 and included in the division's Team of the Year. Evra's performances for Monaco culminated in a move to English club Manchester United in January 2006. While playing for Manchester United, Evra won a slew of trophies, including the League Cup in his debut season at the club. In his second season, he eclipsed Gabriel Heinze and compatriot Mikaël Silvestre as first-choice left-back and went on to win five Premier League titles, one UEFA Champions League title, one FIFA Club World Cup, three League Cups and four Community Shield titles. Evra has been named to the Professional Footballers' Association (PFA) Team of the Year on three occasions. For his performances during the 2008–09 season, he was named to both the FIFPro World XI and the UEFA Team of the Year. After joining Italian side Juventus in 2014, he immediately helped the club to a domestic double and the 2015 UEFA Champions League Final, and won a second domestic double and the Supercoppa Italiana the following season, before moving to Marseille in January 2017; however, he was released in November 2017 after being banned from UEFA competition for seven months for kicking a fan prior to a UEFA Europa League match. He then signed a short-term contract with West Ham United in February 2018. After leaving the club at the end of that contract, Evra was a free agent for a year before retiring from professional football in July 2019. Evra is also a France international. After playing 11 times at under-21 level, he made his senior international debut in August 2004 in a friendly match against Bosnia and Herzegovina. He has participated in five major international tournaments for France: the 2008, 2012 and 2016 UEFA European Championships, winning a runners-up medal at Euro 2016; and both the 2010 and 2014 FIFA World Cups. Ahead of the 2010 World Cup, Evra was named captain of the national team by manager Raymond Domenech and wore the armband for the first time in the team's friendly match against Costa Rica in May 2010. At the tournament, he appeared in two group matches, although France had a poor campaign that saw the players go on strike after a first-round elimination. The incident resulted in Evra, for his role as captain, being suspended from national team duty for five matches. He returned to the squad and enjoyed a successful 2014 World Cup in Brazil under Didier Deschamps as France reached the quarter-finals."
