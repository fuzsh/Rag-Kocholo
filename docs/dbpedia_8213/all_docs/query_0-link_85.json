        "text": "This article critically considers the legacy of hybridity in African popular music studies and questions whether contemporary African engagements with diasporic popular musics like hip hop call for new interpretations of musical genre. Through ethnographic research with hip hoppers in Senegal, I explore how practices of musical intertextuality reinscribe global connections as diasporic ones and challenge the conditions for musical hybridity. I argue for a consideration of the formal parameters of musical genre themselves as conscious and strategic social practice that situates human actors in local and global place. Appert, Catherine M. 2016. \"On Hybridity in African Popular Music.\" Ethnomusicology 60(2):279-99.\n\nAbstract: The following article is the attempt of an historically oriented analysis focused on the role of Nigerian music as a cultural hub for the export of African cultural influences into the Black diaspora in the United States and its anticipation by the Free Jazz/Avantgarde-scene as well as the import of key-values related to the Black Power-movement to the African continent. The aim is to demonstrate the leading role and international impact of Nigerian cultural expression among sub-Saharan African nation states and its specific ability to absorb and incorporate elements of Western culture. After a short discussion of African influences on Jazz-music in general and the socio-political, cultural, and artistic context in which Free Jazz emerged, examples for the articulation of African consciousness among influencing key figures such as saxophonist John Coltrane or the Art Ensemble of Chicago are being presented. Furthermore, the personal and ideological links between the Free Jazz-scene and the Black Power-movement - especially the Black Panther Party - are made transparent. In a second step the central influence of the Nigerian drum-pioneer Babatunde Olatunji on the Africanization of US-Jazz-musicians, his personal and creative impact on John Coltrane, as well as on the Black Power-movement is being highlighted. On the other hand, Coltrane, Free Jazz, and the Black Panther Party are being portrayed as a central creative and ideological turn in the career and work of Fela Kuti towards political activism and his efforts to implement and apply the Africa-inspired Black Power-struggle of the US on the African continent in order to oppose post-colonial forms of oppression. Keywords: Nigerian Music, Black Power, African Identity, Free Jazz, Avantgarde Jazz, Black Nationalism\n\nMichael Titlestad has suggested that jazz serves “to mediate, manage and contest” what he terms a “staggered, but also cruel and unusual South African modernity.” His volume Making the Changes (2004) uses the “pedestrian” as a chronotope to describe the “local peripatetic appropriations of global symbolic possibilities” that jazz affords there. This paper proposes a different “chronotope”: that of the train. This substitution facilitates the reading of jazz history in South Africa in tandem with histories of labour migration and other forms of displacement—including trajectories of exile that intersect my account elsewhere of the “global itinerary” of South African cultural formations under apartheid. The deterritorialisation of South African works of expressive culture and social actors associated with anti-apartheid resistance, I have argued, affords the cultural historian strong historiographic purchase over conjunctures outside of South Africa. The present discussion explores this claim in relation to Miriam Makeba’s memoir Makeba, My Story (1988), written during her stay in Guinea. Makeba’s life-writing shows the strategies of the black South African performer in exile to be embedded in the conviviality that shaped jazz performance culture during its emergence in urban South African. Conviviality can be shown to offer an implicit critique of nativist imaginaries in decolonizing Africa – including in this instance, the doctrine of authenticité promulgated by Guinea’s controversial leader, Ahmed Sékou Touré.\n\nThis paper is based on a conference that took place in June 2009 on ‘The African Roots of Jazz’ orgnanised by the New York University Faculty Network Resource Seminar . The co-conveners of of this five day workshop in New York were John Collins and the African American clarinettist Dr. Michael White of Xavier University in New Orleans. Collins spoke on African popular music and the circular trans-Atlantic relationship between the performing arts of Africa and the Black Americas, whilst Michael White, who is a brass band musician , presented a brief history of New Orleans music . The two conveners also made comparisons between two forms of brass band music that were developing on both sides of the Black Atlantic from the late 19th century: namely Ghanaian Fanti brass band music that fed into early highlife, and New Orleans brass band tradition that evolved into jazz The psychologist Richard Tietze of Marymount Manhattan College, who was present throughout the workshop, later wrote this paper on it, as well as a psycho-social interpretation of the facts presented by Collins and White: such as identity, syncretism, dual consciousness and multicultural viewpoints; the sublimation of imagery from the subconscious and ‘collective unconscious’ ; improvisation and Jung’s ‘active imagination’."
