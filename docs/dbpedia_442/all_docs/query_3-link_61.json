Cohen\n\nLyrics by Dean Pitchford\n\nMusic by Michael Gore\n\nAdapted from Stephen King’s Carrie\n\nDirected and Choreographed by Victoria Rae Sook\n\nAdapted from Stephen King's 1974 novel Carrie, the musical focuses on an awkward teenage girl with telekinetic powers whose lonely life is dominated by an oppressive religious fanatic mother. When she is humiliated by her classmates at the high school prom, she unleashes chaos on everyone and everything in her path.\n\nElizabeth Baker Theater\n\nView Cast and Creative\n\nSCHOOL OF THEATER PRESENTS\n\n1st Year MFA Directors’ Projects\n\nmacbitches\n\nDirected by Devin Ty Franklin\n\nWhen a freshman is unexpectedly given the coveted role of Lady Macbeth, a few upperclassmen actresses invite her over to “celebrate” her casting and reassert their positions at the top of the theatre department’s hierarchy. As the Fireball and Svedka flow, the girls interrogate their own sense of ambition as well as the power structures that have shaped their theatrical education.\n\nPlaySpace, Putnam Hall RM 227\n\nThe Secretaries\n\nDirected by Caitlin Lopez\n\nPretty Patty Johnson is thrilled to join the secretarial pool at the Cooney Lumber Mill under the iron-fisted leadership of sultry office manager Susan Curtis. But she soon begins to feel that all is not right—the enforced diet of Slim-Fast shakes, the strange clicking language between the girls, the monthly disappearance of a lumberjack… By the time Patty discovers murder is part of these office killers' skill set, it's too late to turn back! In the guise of satiric exploitation-horror, The Secretaries takes an unflinching look at the warped cultural expectations of femininity.\n\nPlaySpace, Putnam Hall, RM 227\n\nSCHOOL OF THEATER PRESENTS\n\nJulius Caesar\n\nBy William Shakespeare\n\nDirected by Shelley Delaney\n\nPower and Ambition.

They also covertly perform abortions--long ago made illegal. When approached by a local young woman, Hannah, to perform an abortion, Fade must assist her before the sheriff can nail them for the “attempted murder of an unborn person.” This post-Roe v. Wade play about mothers and daughters is poetic, sexy, vulgar, queer, and a little too real.\n\nVirginia Hahne Theater\n\nView Cast and Creative\n\nSCHOOL OF THEATER PRESENTS\n\nwhat the Gods gave me\n\nBy Eryn Elyse McVay\n\nDirected by Molly H. Donahue\n\nMoon magic, man eaters, and matrimony; the women of Nevermoore Inn are preparing for the first night of the rest of their lives, but their carefully crafted mythos is about to catch fire.

Fast-forward fifteen years, and Lola’s still reaching toward that dream, still just on the cusp on true greatness. From betraying a friend to making deals with a demon, Lola will do just about anything to get on that Vegas stage, she has to, because everything she’s done, everything she’s gone through, it has to be worth it, right?\n\nSQUEAKERS\n\nby Steven Strafford\n\nDirected by Sam Nelson\n\nJane is a new mother of a young baby, who finds herself on an adventure she never wanted to take.
