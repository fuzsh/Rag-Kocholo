He is interested in the role of open source software, community development and open access to enable digital curation. Ed has a MS in Library and Information Science and a BA in English and American Literature from Rutgers University. He is also a PhD student in the UMD iSchool where he studies web archiving practices.\n\nPrior to joining MITH Ed helped build the Repository Development Center (RDC) at the Library of Congress. In that role he led the design and implementation of the NEH funded National Digital Newspaper Program’s web application, which provides access to 8 million newspapers from across the United States. He also helped create the Twitter archiving application that has archived close to 500 billion tweets (as of September 2014). Ed created LC’s image quality assurance service that has allowed curators to sample and review over 50 million images. He served as a member of the Semantic Web Deployment Group at the W3C where he helped standardize SKOS, which he put to use in implementing the initial version of LC’s Linked Data service.\n\nEd likes to use experiments to learn about the web and digital curation. Examples of this include his work with Wikimedia Labs on Wikistream (which helps visualize the rate of change on Wikipedia); and congressedits, which allows Twitter users to follow edits being made to Wikipedia from the Congress. You can find out more about what Ed is up to by following his blog, his Twitter stream, and his software development activity on Github.\n\nJingmin Zhang\n\nResearch assistant at the Smithsonian’s Freer-Sackler Gallery of Art\n\nDr. Jingmin Zhang currently works as a research assistant at the Smithsonian’s Freer Gallery of Art and Arthur M. Sackler Gallery in Washington, D.C.\n\nSince 2015, she has been working with Keith Wilson, Curator of ancient Chinese art, to develop a digital catalogue of the museum’s outstanding ancient jade collection. The digital platform allows limitless image sharing, easy combination of art historical research with archival records, and links to related objects in this and other collections. The catalogue, which will include some 1000 entries, is divided into five period-based releases. Two volumes have been published and a third one is on the verge of being released.\n\nPrior to joining the Freer, Jingmin worked as a graduate assistant in the Digital Humanities Lab at the University of Maryland, College Park. She explored different ways of using technology to enhance art historical teaching and research, including visualizing primary sources, such as diaries and original historical documents, through Google Earth maps.\n\nJingmin holds a BA and MA in archaeology from Beijing University and a PhD in art history from the University of Maryland, College Park.\n\nDiane Zorich\n\nDirector, Digitization Program Office, Smithsonian Institution\n\nAs Director of the Smithsonian’s Digitization Program Office (DPO), Diane Zorich leads an expert team in digitizing Smithsonian collections to maximize their impact for the public.
