        "text": "Artificial intelligence, or at least the modern concept of it, has been with us for several decades, but only in the recent past has AI captured the collective psyche of everyday business and society.\n\nAI is about the ability of computers and systems to perform tasks that typically require human cognition. Our relationship with AI is symbiotic. Its tentacles reach into every aspect of our lives and livelihoods, from early detections and better treatments for cancer patients to new revenue streams and smoother operations for businesses of all shapes and sizes.\n\nAI can be considered big data's great equalizer in collecting, analyzing, democratizing and monetizing information. The deluge of data we generate daily is essential to training and improving AI systems for tasks such as automating processes more efficiently, producing more reliable predictive outcomes and providing greater network security.\n\nTake a stroll along the AI timeline\n\nThe introduction of AI in the 1950s very much paralleled the beginnings of the Atomic Age. Though their evolutionary paths have differed, both technologies are viewed as posing an existential threat to humanity.\n\nThis article is part of\n\nA guide to artificial intelligence in the enterprise\n\nWhich also includes:\n\n10 top AI and machine learning trends for 2024\n\n10 top artificial intelligence certifications and courses for 2024\n\nThe future of AI: What to expect in the next 5 years\n\nThrough the years, artificial intelligence and the splitting of the atom have received somewhat equal treatment from Armageddon watchers. In their view, humankind is destined to destroy itself in a nuclear holocaust spawned by a robotic takeover of our planet. The anxiety surrounding generative AI has done little to quell their fears.\n\nPerceptions about the darker side of AI aside, artificial intelligence tools and technologies since the advent of the Turing test in 1950 have made incredible strides -- despite the intermittent roller-coaster rides mainly due to funding fits and starts for AI research. Many of these breakthrough advancements have flown under the radar, visible mostly to academic, government and scientific research circles until the past decade or so, when AI was practically applied to the wants and needs of the masses. AI products such as Apple's Siri and Amazon's Alexa, online shopping, social media feeds and self-driving cars have forever altered the lifestyles of consumers and operations of businesses.\n\nThrough the decades, some of the more notable developments include the following:\n\nNeural networks and the coining of the terms artificial intelligence and machine learning in the 1950s.\n\nEliza, the chatbot with cognitive capabilities, and Shakey, the first mobile intelligent robot, in the 1960s.\n\nAI winter followed by AI renaissance in the 1970s and 1980s.\n\nSpeech and video processing in the 1990s.\n\nIBM Watson, personal assistants, facial recognition, deepfakes, autonomous vehicles, and content and image creation in the 2000s.\n\n1950\n\nAlan Turing published \"Computing Machinery and Intelligence,\" introducing the Turing test and opening the doors to what would be known as AI.\n\n1951\n\nMarvin Minsky and Dean Edmonds developed the first artificial neural network (ANN) called SNARC using 3,000 vacuum tubes to simulate a network of 40 neurons.\n\n1952\n\nArthur Samuel developed Samuel Checkers-Playing Program, the world's first program to play games that was self-learning.\n\n1956\n\nJohn McCarthy, Marvin Minsky, Nathaniel Rochester and Claude Shannon coined the term artificial intelligence in a proposal for a workshop widely recognized as a founding event in the AI field.\n\n1958\n\nFrank Rosenblatt developed the perceptron, an early ANN that could learn from data and became the foundation for modern neural networks.\n\nJohn McCarthy developed the programming language Lisp, which was quickly adopted by the AI industry and gained enormous popularity among developers.\n\n1959\n\nArthur Samuel coined the term machine learning in a seminal paper explaining that the computer could be programmed to outplay its programmer.\n\nOliver Selfridge published \"Pandemonium: A Paradigm for Learning,\" a landmark contribution to machine learning that described a model that could adaptively improve itself to find patterns in events.\n\n1964\n\nDaniel Bobrow developed STUDENT, an early natural language processing (NLP) program designed to solve algebra word problems, while he was a doctoral candidate at MIT.\n\n1965\n\nEdward Feigenbaum, Bruce G.

in business processes, manufacturing, healthcare, financial services, marketing, customer experience, workforce environments, education, agriculture, law, IT systems and management, cybersecurity, and ground, air and space transportation.\n\nIn business, 55% of organizations that have deployed AI always consider AI for every new use case they're evaluating, according to a 2023 Gartner survey. By 2026, Gartner reported, organizations that \"operationalize AI transparency, trust and security will see their AI models achieve a 50% improvement in terms of adoption, business goals and user acceptance.\"\n\nToday's tangible developments -- some incremental, some disruptive -- are advancing AI's ultimate goal of achieving artificial general intelligence. Along these lines, neuromorphic processing shows promise in mimicking human brain cells, enabling computer programs to work simultaneously instead of sequentially. Amid these and other mind-boggling advancements, issues of trust, privacy, transparency, accountability, ethics and humanity have emerged and will continue to clash and seek levels of acceptability among business and society."
