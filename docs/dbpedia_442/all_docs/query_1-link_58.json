        "text": "JOHN BROCKMAN\n\nOnline Digital Archive\n\nAbout John Brockman (Brief Bio)\n\nJOHN BROCKMAN (born February 16, 1941) is an American cultural impresario whose career has encompassed the avant-garde art world, science, books, software, the internet, and artificial intelligence.\n\nHe began his career in 1965 while working at the Film-Makers' Cinematheque. During this period, he was influenced by the ideas of Norbert Wiener, Claude Shannon, John Cage, and Marshall McLuhan. In 1966, he was hired to develop a special mixed-media event at the Lincoln Center Film Festival. This led to his establishment in 1968 as the first McLuhanesque consultant, helping clients such as General Electric, Columbia Pictures, Scott Paper, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the White House to rethink their activities in light of the emerging science of cybernetics.\n\nIn 1973, he founded John Brockman Associates (now Brockman, Inc.), the international literary and software agency specializing in representing serious nonfiction and science-related works.\n\nIn 1991, the Los Angeles Times published excerpts from Brockman's influential essay \"The Third Culture,\" which he defined as \"those scientists and other thinkers in the empirical world who, through their work and expository writing, are taking the place of the traditional intellectual in rendering visible the deeper meanings of our lives, redefining who and what we are.\"\n\nResponding to the rise of the internet, in 1996 Brockman established the non-profit Edge Foundation, Inc., and in 1997 launched Edge (Edge.org), a website devoted to discussions of innovative science by many of the world's brilliant thinkers, the leaders of what he termed \"the third culture.\"\n\nThe critic John Naughton, in The Guardian, called Edge \"the world's smartest website.\" He continued:\n\nSince the mid-1960s, John Brockman has been at the cutting edge of ideas. He is a passionate advocate of both science and the arts, and his website Edge is a salon for the world's finest minds.\n\nTo say that John Brockman is a literary agent is like saying that David Hockney is a photographer. For while it's true that Hockney has indeed made astonishingly creative use of photography, and Brockman is indeed a successful literary agent who represents an enviable stable of high-profile scientists and communicators, in both cases the description rather understates the reality. [1]\n\nMore accurate ways of describing Brockman would be to say that he is, as his friend Stewart Brand puts it, an \"intellectual enzyme.\" (Brand goes on helpfully to explain that an enzyme is \"a biological catalystâan adroit enabler of otherwise impossible things.\") Brockman's own view, Naughton adds, is that any attempt to describe himself \"would result in awkwardness, confusion, and contradiction.\"\n\nBrockman and his work have been celebrated in more than 100 of the world's publications, including American Scientist, The Atlantic, The Boston Globe, The Chicago Tribune, Corriere della Sera, The Economist, Financial Times, Foreign Affairs, Forbes, Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, The Guardian, The Independent, Korean Joong-Ang, Le Monde, Life, Los Angeles Times, La NaciÃ³n, The Nation, Nature, Neue ZÃ¼rcher Zeitung, The New Republic, Newsweek, New Scientist, New Statesman, New York Magazine, The New Yorker, The New York Times, The New York Times Magazine, The Observer, O Globo, la Repubblica, SaarbrÃ¼cker Zeitung, Salon, San Francisco, Chronicle, Science, Scientific American, Smithsonian, Il Sole 24 Ore, Der Spiegel, La Stampa, SÃ¼ddeutsche Zeitung, The Telegraph, The Times, La Vanguardia, Vanity Fair, Il Venerdi di Repubblica, Vogue, Wall Street Journal, The Washington Post, Die Welt, Die Zeit, and Wired.\n\nHe is the author of By the Late John Brockman and The Third Culture: Beyond The Scientific Revolution and editor of forty-five other nonfiction books, including Possible Minds: 25 Ways of Looking at AI and the Edge Annual Question Series (This Idea Is Brilliant, Know This, This Idea Must Die, This Explains Everything, This Will Make You Smarter, What We Believe But Cannot Prove, and other volumes). He lives in New York City, with his wife, Katinka Matson; their son, Max, now heads Brockman, Inc.\n\n~ ~ ~\n\nEarly Life\n\nJohn Brockman was born on February 16, 1941, in an Irish Catholic enclave of Boston, Massachusetts, to Jewish parents. His mother, Ruth Brockman, was a registered nurse, and his father, Ellis Brockman, was a flower broker known throughout the city as \"the carnation king.\" When Brockman was three-and-a-half years old, he contracted spinal meningitis and, with a temperature of 106 degrees, was in a coma for six weeks at Boston Children's Hospital. Though the initial prognosis suggested that he would not survive, he eventually recovered.\n\nWhen he finally awoke, the first two things he reportedly told the nurses were, \"I want to go to New York\" and \"No tomatoes.\" He pushed the tomatoes away and eventually found his way to New York, but he didn't get there immediately.\n\nBrockman grew up in a tough Irish neighborhood rife with virulent anti-Semitismâalmost like a war zone. At the age of five, he learned that he, personally, was responsible for the death of Jesus Christ. In this regard, getting to and from school every day was an adventure. When he and his brother Philip heard \"Christ killers!\" they knew a fight was imminent. And fight they did. In those days, the mid-1940s, your life wasn't in danger, but more than a few bloody noses taught the brothers the value of discretion. The routine was that Philip, three-and-a-half years older, would take the brunt of it, and more than a few times he would return home with a bloody nose. But Brockman's mother would have none of it. She would wipe Philip's nose and yell at him, \"Get the hell back out there and fight!\"\n\nAnd so he did, only to get clobbered once again. \"What do they have, those damn Irish?\" she would say. \"We have Einstein!\"\n\nRuth Brockman was a fierce woman. Soon enough, the brothers were making a weekly trek across town for boxing and jiu-jitsu lessons with a martial arts instructor. Brockman was an apt student. He learned how to fight, and his Irish problems disappeared.\n\nScience was also a factor in Brockman's early life, via brother Philip, who was a member of the first group of NASA employees hired to meet the challenge of the 1957 launch of Sputnik. He belonged to a small team of scientists labeled \"The Mad Scientists of MPD\" by NASA historian James R. Hansen in his Spaceflight Revolution: NASA Langley Research Center from Sputnik to Apolloâ\"MPD\" being mercifully short for \"magnetoplasmadynamics.\" [2] The MPD thruster, still under development, will potentially produce by far the highest form of electromagnetic propulsion, enabling us to send heavy cargo and piloted space vehicles to Mars.\n\nResearch physicist Philip Brockman pushes the button to start NASA's MPD-arc plasma accelerator in December 1964 [3]\n\nIn mid-career in the 1970s, Philip reinvented himself as a laser scientist, performing spectroscopy of atmospheric molecules. During this second part of his forty-three-year NASA career, his perhaps most outstanding contributions concerned airport terminal area productivity and aircraft safety. In 1997, he was awarded the NASA Exceptional Service Medal \"for outstanding contributions and exceptional service in the development of NASA's laser remote sensing technology and capability.\"\n\nFor his part, John Brockman attended the Babson Institute and, later, Columbia Business School, where he received an MBA in 1963. After serving in the Army, he returned to New York for good in 1964 and opened a financial leasing company.\n\nEarly Career\n\nWesleyan Conference, 1963\n\nBrockman was first exposed to the \"cybernetic idea\" when he was invited to participate in a Wesleyan University conference convened by the literary critic Ihab Hassan, a celebrated definer and expositor of postmodernism. Those present included composer John Cage, literary critic Leslie Fiedler, architect and systems theorist Buckminster Fuller, and social philosopher Norman O. Brown.\n\nSt. Mark's Church-in-the-Bowery, 1964\n\nOnce in New York, Brockman worked in his financial company office on Park Avenue during the day. At night, he went downtown, where, along with Charles Mingus Jr. and playwright and actor Sam Shepard, he volunteered to set up performances at Theatre Genesis, one of the first off-off-Broadway theaters, housed in St. Mark's Church-in-the-Bowery. The church, at East 10th Street and Second Avenue, was the center of the universe for local young people interested in poetry, film, and exploring new forms of expression in the arts. It was the home of The Poetry Project, run by Anne Waldman, and, later, of Richard Foreman's Ontological-Hysteric Theatre.\n\nIntrigued by the scene and the people, Brockman approached Reverend Michael Allen, rector of St. Mark's, and asked permission to launch a program of screenings of experimental films by independent filmmakers, such as Albert and David Maysles, Robert Frank, Richard Leacock, and D. A. Pennebaker. The first screening, in 1964, was perhaps the big event of the year. The large hall at St. Mark's was overflowing, and a long line of people encircled the church. The St. Mark's film program struck a nerve and was a huge success.\n\nAt the beginning of the screening, as Brockman greeted the audience and introduced the participants, he noticed a young woman sitting in the second row. The twenty-one-year-old Katinka Matson, already a presence among the young poets in the East Village, had found her way to Lee Strasberg's Actors Studio. Her father, Harold Matson, was a literary agent who represented numerous distinguished clients including Evelyn Waugh, C. S. Forester, Arthur Koestler, Malcolm Lowry, William Saroyan, Allen Drury, Robert Ruark, Herman Wouk, and Flannery O'Connor.\n\nKatinka Matson, 1971\n\n(photo: Â© John Brockman)\n\nBrockman knew what had to be done. In 1973 he founded his own literary agency, John Brockman Associates (now Brockman, Inc.). In 1975, he hired Matson to work with him.\n\nDinners with Cage, 1965\n\nBrockman had the good fortune to be one of half a dozen young people in the art world to be invited by John Cage to attend a series of dinners at the New York townhouse of poet Dick Higgins. During these evenings, Cage served beer and cooked mushroom dishes, initiating conversations about the questions he was asking himself, which, at that time, focused on Norbert Wiener's cybernetics, Claude Shannon's mathematical theory of information, and Marshall McLuhan's ideas about media.\n\nCage was aware of research conducted in the late 1930s and 1940s by Wiener, Shannon, Warren McCulloch, et al. He had picked up on McLuhan's idea that by inventing electric technology we had externalized our central nervous systemsâthat is, our mindsâand that we now had to presume that there's \"only one mind, the one we all share.\" Or, as McLuhan would say, the \"collective conscious.\"\n\n\"Mind\" had become socialized. \"We can't change our minds without changing the world,\" Cage told his dinner companions. Mind, as a man-made extension, had become our environment, and we could tap into the collective consciousness by creating \"a global utilities network.\"\n\nOne evening Cage reached into his briefcase, took out a copy of Wiener's Cybernetics, and handed it to Brockman, saying, \"This is for you.\"\n\nThus began Brockman's career-long interest in what he termed \"the cybernetic idea.\" Two years later, while Stewart Brand was preparing the first edition of The Whole Earth Catalog for publication, he and Brockman sat together in Menlo Park for two days, reading, discussing, and underlining Cybernetics.\n\nThe New Cinema Festival 1, 1965\n\nThe New Cinema Festival 1 (later universally and colloquially known as \"The Expanded Cinema Festival\") was a seminal event of that decade. Critic and filmmaker Jonas Mekas, the leader of the underground film movement, remained focused on 16mm movies, but the artistic world was moving on, as artists began using film cameras instead of paintbrushes. Mekas wanted to embrace a broader palette of art and artists. His idea was to invite thirty artists, dancers, poets, happenings artists, and filmmakers and give them each a modest sum of money, with a mandate to bring cinema into their work.\n\nAware of Brockman's successful film program at St. Mark's, Mekas asked Brockman to organize and produce the festival and to manage the Film-Makers' Cinematheque (founded by Mekas the previous year). This established Brockman's connection with many leading figures in the art world, such as Andy Warhol, Juan Miro, Meyer Schapiro, Nam June Paik, Carolee Schneemann, the USCO arts collective, Robert Rauschenberg, and Claes Oldenburg.\n\nThe Film-Makers' Cinematheque was considered by many to be unruly and unmanageable. But Brockman, recently discharged from the Army, was disciplined. And with his Columbia MBA he was into business. Mekas believed he was the right person for the job.\n\nBut just as the \"New/Expanded\" cinema\" festival began, on the first day in November 1965, Mekas abruptly announced that he was departing for a month-long family visit to Lithuania. He handed Brockman the Cinematheque's checkbook, putting him in charge of enlisting artists and producing future festivals.\n\nBrockman's change was one of emphasis. The Cinematheque had been home to underground movies, the center of action for avant-garde filmmakers such as Stan Brakhage and Gregory Markopoulos. Even more than Mekas, Brockman wanted to expand the conversation to include much that was new in the New York City art worldâthe new forms of expression in the air: happenings, dance experimentation, avant-garde theater. He paid attention to marketing, with an eye to reaching a bigger audience.\n\nThe festival began on November 1, 1965. Of note that month was the appearance of the writer Susan Sontag, who showed up for the first of the two shows presented by the arts collective USCO. Sontag had arrived in the company of Henry Geldzahler, the Metropolitan Museum's curator of American art and Andy Warhol's close friendâa leading tastemaker in the New York art world. At the end of the first USCO show, Sontag approached Brockman to tell him that she had been deeply moved by what she considered a powerful art experience. She asked to use the phone and spent the next hour calling friends and imploring them to come to the Cinematheque for the second show of the evening. The word spread, and people responded. The second show was packed. The festival became the talk of the art world.\n\nUSCO (The name is an acronym for Us Company, or the Company of Us) was an art collective whose members believed in anonymous artworks in the spirit of the artisans of medieval times. Principal among the USCO people were the poet Gerd Stern, the electrical engineer Michael Callahan, and the painter and multimedia artist Steve Durkee.\n\nTheir mantra was \"We are all one,\" and they worked and lived in a \"Psychedelic Tabernacle\" in an old church in Garnerville, in the Hudson Valley of New York. [4] In his Dictionary of the Avant-Gardes, literary critic Richard Kostelanetz has noted of USCO:\n\nTheir masterworks were kinetic Environments . . . filled with paintings, objects, audio, slides, films (sometimes looped), colored lights, and a pulsing strobe light . . . . The one I remember best, and which also influenced many artists who saw it, was at the Riverside Museum in Manhattan. It was filled with elemental symbols and materials: male and female, heartbeats, and seven spheres representing seven planets. \"We also had five elements,\" Durkee told me. \"We had sand in the box in the middle; fire in the candles; we had air; we had water in the fountain around the periphery of the column, which was also the lingam inside the yoniâa psychosexual situation. There was an \"om\" tape playing on a stereo tape recorder. \"Om\" was the original sound of the universe. What we had in that room, in short, was everything that is. [5]\n\nWhen Mekas returned from Lithuania for the final evening of the month-long festival, he walked into the overcrowded lobby to find many TV cameras and reporters hovering around Mike Wallace of 60 Minutes, who was conducting a live CBS News interview with Senator Ted Kennedy. Brockman recalls a visibly annoyed Mekas walking up to him and presenting him with a handwritten note informing him that his services were no longer required.\n\nThe back story is that there was a tension between various factions involved with the Cinematheque. Mekas was an advocate of the highly eroticized theatrical presentations of Jack Smith's \"Flaming Creatures,\" Charles Ludlam's \"Ridiculous Theatrical Company,\" and John Vacarro's \"Theatre of the Ridiculous.\" Brockman had no problem with the content of these theatrical events, but he did have a serious problem with the unprofessional attitude of some of the participants. On the night of the 1965 blackout, with the Cinemathque (and the entire neighborhood) in the dark, Jack Smith went beserk and began throwing chairs aimed at Brockman's head. Tally Brown, a reputable and serious actor who was a very large woman, appeared onstage with another actor one third her size, in a \"plural garment.\" But as was the case at certain Cinematheque events, the actors went off script, and Brown, in a huff, imperiously stomped off the stage, having forgotten that her diminutive fellow-actor was bound to her and being dragged off as well.\n\nOn December 4th, The New Yorker published the festival's first review:\n\nThe Film-Makers' Cinematheque, a society of avant-garde film-makers, with headquarters at the Astor Place Playhouse, devoted last month to something called the New Cinema Festival I, which was described in a prospectus as \"a survey of recent experiments to expand the dimensions of cinema\" through the use of \"multiple screens, multiple projectors, multiple images, inter-related screen forms and images, filmdance, moving slides, kinetic sculptures, hand-held projectors, balloon screens, video tape and video projections, light and sound experiments.\" We have always had a weakness for ambitious prospectuses, so when we read this one we headed for the Astor Place Playhouse to take in a representative sample of Festival programs. We came away convinced that the Cinematheque is fulfilling all its promises, and then some.\n\n.â¦ As the New Cinema Festival was getting into full swing at the Playhouse, another survey of work by independent film-makers was being screened uptown in the Museum of Modern Art. Many of the best-known experimental film-makers were represented in both places, but the Museum's selections went back as far as 1957, and all were shown on a single screen, from a single projector, and used either black-and-white or color film. Many of the movies, already regarded as classics in the field, have been giving fits to local police, college authorities, and conventional audiences for years, and the Museum's monthly calendar for members carried a special warning: \"These films are not suitable for children.\" But, compared to what was happening downtown, the films looked as old-fashioned, as early-twentieth-century, as all those paintings by Picasso and Matisse on the walls upstairs.\n\nWriting in The Nation, Howard Junker reported:\n\nBrockman has already earned a page in cinema history by explaining that the Underground film makers are not, after all, making movies. Whereas Mekas has consistently refused to acknowledge the constraints of necessity, Brockman says, straight out: \"The Underground film makers are artists. And they happen to use film. But they are not even trying to duplicate Hollywood. Film is just the most appropriate medium for what they want to say.\" Brockman documented his understanding of the new possibilities with the November-long Expanded Cinema Festival which featured a couple of dozen events with multiple projections and with film-plus-live-action. [6]\n\nBrockman remembers:\n\nThe date was September 4, 1966. I was sitting on a park bench on Labor Day weekend in Easthampton, Long Island, reading about myself [in] the New York Times Sunday Arts section. I was wondering if the article would get me fired from my job at the New York Film Festival at Lincoln Center, where I was producing \"expanded cinema\" events. I was twenty-five years old. New and exciting ideas and forms of expression were in the air. They came out of happenings, the dance world, underground movies, avant-garde theater. They came from artists engaged in experiment. Intermedia consisted more often than not of nonscripted, sometimes spontaneous, theatrical events by artists in which the audience was also a participant.\n\nI arrived at this spot after managing the Film-Makers' Cinematheque, the home for underground cinema in 1965, where my mandate had been to produce a festival that expanded the form of cinema. I commissioned thirty performance pieces by world-class artists, dancers, poets, dramatists, and musicians. They were free to do anything they wanted, the only stipulation being that their piece incorporate cinema.\n\nThe result was the Expanded Cinema Festival, and it received major media attention. Within a year there were two Life covers and a New York Times Magazine cover on derivative works. Intermedia, the word I . . . used as my logo, was hot.A number of legendary art world figures became interested in the genre. Some of the people I worked with during that period included visual artists Les Levine, Claes Oldenburg, Robert Rauschenberg, Andy Warhol, Robert Whitman; kinetic artists Charlotte Moorman and Nam June Paik; happenings artists Allan Kaprow and Carolee Schneemann; dancer Trisha Brown; filmmakers Jack Smith, Stan Vanderbeek, Ed Emshwiller, and the Kuchar brothers; avant-garde dramatist Ken Dewey; poet Gerd Stern and the USCO group; musicians La Monte Young and Terry Riley; and, through Warhol, the music group Velvet Underground. [7]\n\nGerd Stern recalls:\n\nAfter a while, we were kind of getting out of overload, and we felt that we had freaked out too many people. . . .Now what we did is we would build up to overload, then from overload we would come down to a meditational transformation and just [hums] \"ommmmmmmmmm.\" There would be these hundreds of images just multiplying and overloading and sounds. Eventually the only image there would be on a big displayâa CRT [cathode-ray tube] monitorâan oscilloscope sine wave which looks like the infinity sign or a Moebius loopâjust dancing for fifteen minutes just very low \"ommmmmmmmmm.\" It would cool everybody out; it was our intention to excite people and to give them the multiplicity sensation and then to bring them back to unity. It worked beautifully; it was amazing.[8]\n\nHarvard-MIT Art/Science Meeting\n\nBrockman soon received a phone call from two notable scientific figures: Arthur K. Solomon, professor of biophysics at Harvard Medical School, and Walter Rosenblith, professor of communications biophysics at MIT. Both were close friends and colleagues of Norbert Wiener, who had died the year before, and Rosenblith would contribute an Afterword to Avon Books' 1967 edition of Wiener's The Human Use of Human Beings.\n\nThey told Brockman that they were intrigued by the articles in The New Yorker and The Nation reporting on the \"expanded cinema\" festival and the connection between the artists in the New York art world and Wiener's pioneering work on cybernetics. They asked to meet. The phone call resulted in an unprecedented art/science event, after Solomon asked Brockman to put together a group of avant-garde artists to come to Cambridge for a two-day seminar with Harvard and MIT scientists; besides Solomon and Rosenblith, these included Harvard applied mathematician and AI pioneer Anthony Oettinger and MIT electrical engineer Harold \"Doc\" Edgerton, inventor of ultra-high-speed, stop-action, stroboscopic photography. The artists in the group included Ken Dewey and Terry Riley of Theatre X, and Gerd Stern and Michael Callahan of USCO. The meeting was the first art/science event of its kind, occurring almost a year before Robert Rauschenberg and Billy KlÃ¼ver's 69th Regiment Armory show, \"9 Evenings: Theatre and Engineering,\" staged in October 1966.\n\n\"The World\" and the New Age of Disco\n\nMichael Myerberg, the Broadway producer known for his innovative Broadway production of Waiting for Godot, owned a large, abandoned airplane hangar at Roosevelt Field in Garden City. In 1965, he asked Brockman to transform the space into a gigantic intermedia discotheque. The result was an intermedia kinetic environment with dozens of channels of audio and visual inputs, featuring state-of-the-art electronic technology including Doc Edgerton's strobes bouncing their rays of light against a twirling mirrored globe consisting of diffracted glass.\n\nBrockman brought in Andy Warhol to be the face of \"Andy Warhol's World,\" and he retained the USCO group to design the audio-visual aspects of the project and handle its overall execution. Michael Callahan of USCO described the environment to Artforum's senior editor, Michele Kuo:\n\nThere was a three-camera setup, and we had the Eidophor video projector as well; much of this equipment was actually surplus from the 1964 World's Fair. The Eidophor was incredibly complexâNASA used it at Mission Control: The image was formed by an electron beam on a rotating disc coated with oil, and light from a 2,500-watt xenon bulb was diffracted off the image onto the screen. In The World, three TV-camera operators would zoom in on people dancing and project this on the big screen. And they could do a disorienting visual mix of fading, juxtaposing the images. This was quite something at the time. The Eidophor was as brilliant as 35-mm filmâa huge, bright, crisp, immersive image. And on each side of the Eidophor screen was a 16mm film, from beautiful Philips projectors. There were also nineteen slide projections on peripheral screens; these were all controlled from a console I built, largely from salvaged IBM computers.[9]\n\nA week before the launch, Warhol backed out, over money issues with Myerberg. Nevertheless \"The World,\" immediately dubbed \"the first discotheque,\"opened to instant acclaim and was featured on the May 27, 1966 cover of Life announcing \"New Madness at the DiscothÃ¨que.\"\n\nAccording to Life:\n\nTo enjoy the latest thing in discothÃ¨ques, you had better wear ear plugs, dark glasses and shin guards. Otherwise, you may be deafened, blinded and bruised in an electronic earthquake that engulfs you completely in an experience called \"total recreation.\" It has developed out of the tamer discothÃ¨que clubs, and its common ingredients are blinking lights that look like Broadway signs gone berserk, canned or live music, dancing and far-out movies flashed on small screens. One place has a boutique, where you can buy nutty clothes to wear so you really fit into the picture. In these new clubs everybody looks like a kook in a Kubla-Khanteen.\n\nThe World club, in Garden City, N.Y. While the band plays on raised stage at right, a TV camera throws images of dancers on center screen and slides appear on side screens.\n\nIntermedia Kinetic Environments\n\nThe term \"Intermedia\" came into use in 1966. Dick Higgins and Brockman, both regular attendees at the dinners with John Cage, began to use the term.\n\nHiggins was not alone, for around the same time, John Brockman began using the term for the Expanded Cinema festivals he organized at Film-Makers' Cinematheque in New York. While Higgins' essays promulgated the term among artists and scholars, Brockman's work helped bring the term to wider use among film-makers, surfacing to address the larger public in a New York Times article (\"So What Happens After Happenings?\") that appeared shortly after Higgins' essay [10] was published. [11]\n\nThis led Brockman to coin the phrase \"lntermedia Kinetic Environments,\" a reflection on the nonlinear relationship between input and output in which an oscillation occurs and the individual is very much a part of the creation of the reality.\n\n\"These people traffic in experience, not objects or products,\" Brockman told a New York Times reporter. \"Their performances result from an awareness of the reality inherent in the new technologies. Their function is to make visible the perceptions of science. They use the environment as an art form and have abandoned the notion of art as metaphor to deal with man in time and space.\" [12]\n\nOn Sunday, September 4, 1966, The New York Times profiled Brockman in the Arts section; the piece, by Elenore Lester, was titled \"SO WHAT HAPPENS AFTER HAPPENINGS?\":\n\n\"Hate Happenings. Love Intermedia Kinetic Environments.\" John Brockman is speakingâpartly kidding, but conveying the notion that Happenings are Out and Intermedia Kinetic Environments are In in the places where the action is. John Brockman, the New York Film Festival's 25-year-old coordinator of a special events program on independent cinema in the United States, plugging into the switched-on \"expanded cinema\" world in which a film is not just a movie, but an Experience, an Event, an Environment. This is a humming electronic world, in which multiple films, tapes, amplifiers, kinetic sculpture, lights and live dancers or actors are combined to Involve Audiences in a Total Theater Experience. Unlike Happenings, which often involve audiences in complicated relationships with plastics, bottles, sacks, ropes and other objects, Intermedia Kinetic Experiences permit audiences simply to sit, stand, walk or lie down and allow their senses to be Saturated by Media.\n\nNo Way Out\n\n\"You can't escape from an Intermedia Kinetic Environment the way you can from a play or any art form that reaches you through language,\" says Brockman. \"This is primary experience. It takes place in a 360-degree environment.\" Brockman, who fully accepts Marshall McLuhan's \"the medium-is-the-message\" thesis, believes that full exposure to I.K.E. is positively \"therapeutic.\"\n\nWhen he was selected by New York Film Festival Director Amos Vogel to work with him on the special events program, Brockman immediately thought in terms of helping to bring this farthest-out development in the film-art-dance-music world before a public \"that really doesn't understand how our world has changed.\" When the festival starts at Lincoln Center on Sept. 12, four of 27 special events will be concerned with this area of film experimentation. The other programs cover a wide range of aspects of independent filmmaking from the cinema vÃ©ritÃ© work of Ricky Leacock and Albert and David Maysles to poetic-impressionistic works and experiments involving the physical aspects of vision.\n\nBut how came Brockman, pink-cheeked, shiny-eyed, fresh out of business school, a traineeship at Bloomingdale's and involvement in a leasing corporation, to the world of artistic experimentation where in one year he has been largely responsible for bringing the underground cinema into the light of day and promoting an unlikely marriage between mixed media and commercial discothÃ©quesâa marriage consummated when USCO (Us Company), a group of poets, artists and engineers, designed an \"environment\" for the World, a teen-age night club on Long Island. \"All accident. I did what I wanted,\" says Brockman. \"After that it was logical thinking. That I learned at business school.\"\n\nBrockman was enmeshed in finance and knew practically nothing of media outside of The Wall Street Journal when his friendship with Off-Off Broadway actor Kevin O'Connor led him to an interest in theatrical activities at St. Mark's Church-in-the-Bowery. He and O'Connor suggested to Ralph Cook, director of the church's art program, that a showing of the work of young independent film-makers might be interesting. The thing caught on. But no one was more caught by it than Brockman himself. In the work of the underground film-makers, the young businessman found a soul the computers lacked. \"Money is just an abstraction. These people were doing something important. They are artists. They see through years of conditioned responses.\" The barriers of his own conditioned responses fell like the stock market. \"Movies? I had loved themâWesterns, foreign films, all kinds of Hollywood films. But this was Something Else!\"\n\nA New Wave\n\nDominating the far-out scene at this time (which will undoubtedly go down in film history as the first period of the new American cinema of the 60's) was the beat type of filmmaker like Jack Smith, Ron Rice and Andy Warhol, whose work projected a wry, personal social criticism, using everything from pathos to put-on to point up modern man's alienation from his society, from his own body and soul. However, this programatically naive, home-movie approach represented only one strain in the new cinema. Other filmmakers were more concerned with extending the range of film-making through technical innovations such as the use of multiple screens and projectors, video tapes, and light and sound experiments. It was this aspect of the new work that most fascinated Brockman. Becoming connected with the Film-Makers' Cooperative, he promoted a week-long festival that brought widespread attention to the group.\n\nSince then, intermedia presentations by Robert Whitman have been given at the Martinique Theater and at Circle-in-the-Square, and a Whitman work was shown before an invited audience at Easthampton, L.I., last weekend. Although Circle audiences have displayed amusement, bafflement and hostility, the art-oriented audience of Easthampton was enthusiastic about a \"theater piece\" based on a watery themeâpenguins, a boat, a strange inflated whale-like object, amplified water sounds and people wrapped in plastic coverings that made them appear to have emerged from the depths of the sea. The work will be given as the final presentation of the special events program at Lincoln Center on Sept. 23.\n\nBrockman feels sure that exposure to Intermedia Kinetic Environments like these will change people's perceptions. He finds it difficult to describe exactly from what to what (\"You just have to experience it. The whole point is that it cannot be told in words.\") In any case, he is sure the change will be for the better. \"After all, we're living in the second half of the 20th century, and for all most people know we may as well be in the 16th. Only the hippest, most aware artists are able to make a statement about our world today.\"\n\n4th New York Film Festival, September 12-22, 1966\n\nAmos Vogel, director of the New York Film Festival at Lincoln Center, hired Brockman to develop special projects for the 1966 Festivalâespecially, to screen new films by a younger generation to be premiered the same week that the main theatre screened new mainstream films by world-famous directors such as Godard, Pasolini, and BuÃ±uel. As a result of his scouting activity, Brockman visited the dorm room of an NYU film student and watched his short film It's Not Just You Murray! (1964), which Brockman selected for the festival, giving Martin Scorsese his first public screening.\n\nWarhol and Bob Dylan at the Factory\n\nAndy Warhol's Factory, on East 47th Street, was the scene of 1966. On any given day, the Factory would be packed with socialites, heroin addicts and amphetamine freaks, art dealers, movie stars, and \"famous\" people such as Edie Sedgwick, Paul America, and Nico. Yet the Factory was very much a workplace: At the center of the large loft, Warhol and his close collaborator, Gerard Malanga, worked tirelessly, mostly on the floor, on new silk-screened images.\n\nWarhol would often be in the corner of the large loft, filming a \"screen test.\" Brockman had been working with Warhol on an ongoing initiative to distribute Warhol's movies to a wider commercial audience, and he made it a point to stop by the Factory on most days. It was during this period that The Event occurredâi.e., Bob Dylan's much-anticipated first visit to the Factory to meet Warhol. When the elevator door opened and Dylan walked in, Warhol and Brockman were talking together near the entrance, in front of a ladder. The photographer Nat Finkelstein happened to be on the scene with his camera and took this photo.\n\nJohn Brockman, Andy Warhol, Bob Dylan at the Factory, 1966\n\nPhotograph by Nat Finkelstein\n\nBriggitte Berlin, Andy Warhol, Gerard Malanga, John Brockman, 1967\n\nThe Jewish Museum's \"Lower East Side\" Show, 1966\n\nThe Village Voice wrote that the opening night event that Brockman produced in collaboration with USCO for the Jewish Museum's \"Lower East Side\" show, was \"the craziest\" embodiment of \"the first days of disco.\" [13]\n\nThe show featured an aural environment, executed by USCO, featuring a 14-channel media mix which attempted to capture experientially the atmosphere of the Lower East Side through light, and the actual sounds from the lower east side during the 1910s and 1920s.\n\nThe New Yorker ran a brief announcement: \"Jewish Museum: Fifth Ave, at 92nd St.â'The Lower East Side: Portal to American Life,' a display of photographs, posters, and films, and a group of paintings and drawings (by George Bellows, John Sloan, and Joseph Stella, to name a few), documenting a chapter of American-Jewish cultural and social history from 1870 to 1924; also included is a mixed medium environmental effect by John Brockman Associates and USCO.\"\n\nThe Youth International Party (the Yippies)\n\nThrough his friendship with radical organizer Abbie Hoffman, Brockman was invited to be a founding member of a new activist group called the Youth International Party (Yippy), whose first meeting was held at Hoffman's apartment on December 31, 1967. The other founders were Stew Albert, Bob Fass, Paul Krassner, and Jerry Rubin. \"It was revolution for the hell of it,\" Brockman recalled.\n\n\"It was theatre, throwing money off the balcony of the stock market and watching these millionaires diving and fighting for dollar bills. Trying to levitate the Pentagon.\" [Brockman] was attracted to their Dada-esque tactics to overthrow established authority, but felt the political posturing was \"beneath what artists should be doing.\" He parted ways with the Yippies, but stayed connected to the radical left, regularly visiting his friend Huey Newton, chairman of the Black Panther Party, in Oakland, California. [14]\n\nIn 1974, Hoffman, after having plastic surgery to alter his appearance, went underground until 1980, posing as an environmental activist under the assumed name of \"Barry Freed.\" On his return in 1980, Hoffman spent his first evening in New York having dinner with Brockman, who asked, \"How did living as Barry differ from your life as Abbie?\"\n\n\"When Barry said something at a dinner party,\" Abbie responded, \"nobody listened.\"\n\nIntermedia '68\n\nBrockman organized and produced \"Intermedia '68âA Festival for New York State,\" with support from the New York State Council on the Arts and the National Council on the Arts. Behind the scenes was Rockefeller Foundation executive Boyd Compton, who was instrumental in convincing New York State to get involved.\n\nOver a period of two months, twelve artists presented their work at twelve different art institutions across the state, including MoMA and the Brooklyn Academy of Musicâa total of 144 events, comprised of happenings, electromedia theatre, space-time art, ecumenical technology, kinetic environments, action theatre, acoustic space, mixedmedia, dance, and sound construction.\n\nCarolee Schneemann\n\nParticipating artists were Remy Charlip, dancer/choreographer; Aileen Passloff, dancer/choreographer; Al Carmines, composer (and minister of Judson Memorial Church); Carolee Schneemann, painter and one of the early practitioners of environmental theatre; Ken Dewey, pioneer happener with a background in theatrical arts; Dick Higgins, poet and Fluxus founder; Allan Kaprow, happenings artist; Les Levine, artist and \"media sculptor\"; Nam June Paik, video pioneer; Terry Riley, musician/composer; Trisha Brown Schlichter, dancer; and Aldo Tambellini, artist and filmmaker.\n\nThe Monkees' Movie, \"Head\"\n\nIn 1968, Brockman and his friend and colleague Gerd Stern were contacted by Hollywood producer Bert Schneider and his partner, director Bob Rafelson, who asked them to consult on a movie they wanted to make with the MonkeesâHead, the first movie in a six-picture deal they had with Columbia Pictures under the banner of BBS Productions (Bert Schneider, Bob Rafelson, and Steve Blauner). In the late '60s, the Monkees, through their TV show, records, and merchandise, were the among the biggest acts in show business.\n\nIn his 1996 oral biography, Gerd Stern recalled:\n\nWhen I had been working with John Brockman in New York, we got a lot of publicityâThe New York Times Magazine, and there was national and international interest in our work. People would call up and ask us things. One time we got a call from Hollywood from Bert Schneider and Bob Rafelson, asking us if we would be interested in consulting with them about a project that they were doing at the time. Bert is the son of the former head of Columbia Pictures, Abe Schneider. A very substantial force in the industry. They met us in New York, and they explained to us that they were doing this film with the Monkees, and it was a very far-out film. They were both big heads. Mucho smoke, in quantities that were impossible for me to even conceive of. The Monkees were not exactly what we thought of as our kind of culture, but they brought us out and paid us royally. John got the lion's share: he wound up with a yellow Jaguar sports car out of this gig. [15]\n\nBrockman, who was not into the Hollywood lifestyle, declined at first. A year later, Schneider and Rafelson reappeared at a time when he needed a payday. Their movie had been made, and now they wanted advice on how to market it. When they asked Brockman to a screening, he agreed to watch the movie under the condition that they pay his $1,500 consulting fee (a) in advance and (b) in cash.\n\nSchneider and Rafelson, both entitled golden boys at the pinnacle of the Hollywood elite, were not used to this kind of treatment, but, oddly, they greatly admired Brockman's chutzpah. Soon, Brockman and Stern were on a plane to Hollywood to spend a week consulting with Schneider and Rafelson on how to market their interesting but quirky movie to the public.\n\nStern decided that the movie would be called Head, and the campaign would be built using the image of Brockman's headâthe irony being that he had nothing to do with the actual movie.\n\nAt Columbia's Burbank studio, Brockman shot a one-minute film of his head, but instead of using the standard speed of 24fps (frames per second) to which audiences were accustomed, he shot the film at 16fps, which intentionally altered the perception of how the audience experienced the movie.\n\nAt the 16fps speed, Brockman's only gesture, an occasional blink, was, by design, slightly out of sync. Although barely noticeable to the viewer, the effect was enough to drive some people crazy. The trailer was silent; the word \"Head\" flashed on and off for about a second, every few seconds or so. The one-minute clip became the trailer and the basis for the TV campaign and commercial.\n\nJohn Brockman (American, born 1941)\n\nJudy Stern\n\nHead 1969\n\nPoster for a film directed by Bob Rafelson\n\nSilkscreen on aluminized Mylar\n\nGift of Columbia Pictures, 1969\n\nThe metalyzed mylar poster for the movieâon which Brockman collaborated with Judy Sternâis a collector's item and part of the permanent collection of the Museum of Modern Art. In this version, the viewer sees his or her own head reflected in the silkscreened image. The same applies to the cover for the record album of songs from the movie. The press missed the point, but the art world certainly got it.\n\nFor the movie poster, Brockman's approach was influenced by the conceptual artists he was working with. He ran the clip as a video, photographed the TV screen, and cropped the image. The image that blanketed the nationâfrom subway posters in New York City to Sunset Strip billboards in Hollywood and full-page ads in all the major papers, isn't of Brockman's head but rather a cropped photograph of a TV set in Burbank, California.\n\nColumbia spent millions on the ad campaign. At one point, Brockman asked Schneider why Columbia Pictures was paying him vast sums of money, far beyond what he had a right to expect.\n\n\"Look,\" Schneider responded, \"I have a new production company, and this is the first of six movies we are doing with Columbia. My father is chairman of the board of Columbia. My brother is the president of the studio. But the movie's a bomb. You know it, and I know it. So, when it bombs, I pick you up, and together we go to Columbia, walk into my father's office, and then I point at you and exclaim: 'Brockman!! You will never work in Hollywood again'âand I get to make the rest of my movies!\"\n\nNonetheless, a year later, Brockman was seated at a table with Abe and Bert Schneider, their spouses, and Jack Nicholson at the celebratory dinner in New York City that followed the opening of BBS's second movie, Easy Rider, one of the great successes in Hollywood history.\n\nNext up for BBS was Bob Rafelson's Five Easy Pieces. And then The Last Picture Show. But Schneider was right: Brockman never worked in Hollywood again.\n\nThere was a subplot, which only two people were aware of. Bert Schneider, who by this time had become the king of \"the New Hollywood,\" was a Machiavellian character. After hiring Brockman to work on Head , he explained his real agenda: \"Your job is to assassinate The Monkees,\" he told Brockman. Schneider, who had grown up in an atmosphere of privilege and wealth, was tired of living the kind of conventional life expected of him. He wanted out. And the way to make that happen was to rid himself of The Monkees. And that's just what happened.\n\nScott Confidets and General Electric\n\nSome years later, in a profile of Brockman, Wired magazine recalled these antics, reporting that they\n\nprompted a fateful call from a business-school pal who was an executive at Scott Paper. He asked Brockman to produce a multimedia presentation to motivate the lethargic sales force of Scott's Confidets, a sanitary napkin. Brockman responded, \"My fee is $15,000,\" a sizable amount for a directionless hippie with no consulting experience. Scott Paper hired him despite the fee, or perhaps because of itâa moment that taught Brockman the value of playing hard to get.\n\n\"It's amazing how tough people will think you are just for saying no,\" he says.\n\nThe Confidets performance . . . motivated, or perhaps just terrified, the Scott team into action, prompting an upward spike in sanitary-napkin sales. Brockman was seen as a boy wonder; he was profiled in The New York Times , and soon he became one of the most in-demand twenty-somethings in corporate America. Companies like General Electric and Gulf Western hired him to do his intermedia thing. [16]\n\nBrockman and USCO were also commissioned by General Electric to prepare an intermedia report on a seminar conducted by GE's Lighting Development Group. The report, printed on plastic sheets, was inserted into a giant light bulb equipped with a strobe light. The strobe, adjustable to any speed from a slow pulse to a rapid flicker, turned the business of reading the plastic sheets into something of a psychedelic experience. \"The intent was to violate the ritual of a report,\" declares Brockman. \"Executives go to sleep with reports. We had to make the point that 'Process is our most important product.'\"\n\nBy the Late John Brockman\n\nBrockman's first book, By the Late John Brockman, was published by Macmillan in January 1969. The first sentence was \"Man is dead.\" Reception was mixed. (\"I found this impenetrable,\" one reviewer posted on Amazon.) In a foreword to its re-publication in 2014, Brockman's colleague Hans Ulrich Obrist, curator of the Serpentine Gallery in London, was more forthcoming:\n\nIn the first edition of By the Late John Brockman, it is not only the content that is highly experimental, but also its format and layout. Each page contains a single paragraph comprised partly of quotes from works by figures from Marshall McLuhan to Ludwig Wittgenstein, Samuel Beckett and ee cummings, that is disconnected from its predecessor. . . . Pre-empting the ebook by many decadesâor conversely, recalling ancient scrollsâthe first edition was printed on one side of the page only. Brockman had told his editor at Macmillan: \"It is obscene to print on both sides of a page.\"\n\nGeorg Diez of Der Spiegel observed that the first edition \"made [Brockman] briefly known, then it was forgotten. It was too early, too radical, nobody wanted to say goodbye to humans, at least not in the literary milieu.\" [17]\n\nNevertheless, a year later, Holt Rinehart Winston published his second book, 37, an examination of Heisenberg's theory of indeterminacy.\n\nThe 1970s\n\nThe Cybernetic Idea\n\nBy 1971, Brockman had established himself in what he considered to be the most important scientific revolution of our time: the cybernetic idea, which came out of work in the 1930s and 1940s by Alan Turing, John von Neumann, Claude Shannon, and Norbert Wiener. The cybernetic idea set the stage for the digital revolution.\n\nAccording to anthropologist Gregory Bateson, \"The cybernetic idea is the most important abstraction since the invention of Jesus Christ.\" We were now living in \"a world of pattern, of order, of resonances in which the individual mind is a subsystem of a larger order. Mind is intrinsic to the messages carried by the pathways within the larger system and intrinsic also in the pathways themselves.\" [18]\n\nBrockman has asserted:\n\nIn this new radical epistemology, Ockham's Razor meets GÃ¶del's Proof and the fabric of our habitual thinking is torn apart. Subject and object fuse. The individual self decreates. Reality passes into description and thus becomes invention. Such ideas, which appear destructive, liberate, allowing us to lay waste to the generalizations of previous epochs, which we decreate by getting through the history of our words. As Wallace Stevens wrote: \"The words of the world are the life of the world. \" [19]\n\nWhile John von Neumann, Claude Shannon, and Norbert Wiener were concerned about systems of control and communication of observed systems, their colleague Warren McCulloch wanted the new cybernetic discipline to be inclusive of the mind.\n\nIt was Gregory Bateson and Margaret Mead, married at the time, who inserted the missing cognitive element into the conversation and made the connection to the social sciences. They brought their anthropological fieldwork to bear on the conversation about patterns and processes, or \"the pattern which connects.\" [20]\n\nThey called for a new kind of systems ecology in which organisms and the environment in which they live, or which they study, are one and the sameâhenceforth to be considered as a single circuit. Bateson believed that the cybernetic explanation was the critical intellectual advance of the last two thousand years. (\"[T]he fabric of our habitual thinking is torn apart. Subject and object fuse. The individual self decreates.\") It is a world of pattern, of order, of resonances.\n\nAround this time, spearheaded by physicist and philosopher Heinz von Foersterâeditor of the five volumes of Cybernetics (1949-1953), conference transcripts representing foundational conversations in the fieldâthe cybernetics of observed systems (1st order cybernetics) began moving to the cybernetics of observing systems (2nd order cybernetics, or \"the cybernetics of cybernetics\").\n\nJames Lee Byars: The World Question Center\n\nThe conceptual artist James Lee Byars was a longtime neighbor, friend, and collaborator of Brockman's. Byars had spent a number of years in Japan and had a decidedly Zen-like epistemology in which there was no distinction between art and life. While Brockman liked to ask, \"What comes before performance?\" for Byars performance was an exercise in the interrogative. Byars liked questions.\n\nIn her book First Reader, Gertrude Stein writes about Jimmie measuring Johnnie and Johnnie measuring Jimmie until the characters become meaningless and what remains is the act of measurement. She was the first writer who made integral to her work the idea of an indeterminate and discontinuous universe. Words represented neither character nor activity: they were \"not imitations either of sounds or colors or emotions.\" [21] Language was an intellectual re-creation. Through an emphasis on such stylistic devices as repetition, she used language to deny meaning and representational concerns. As she pointed out, she would write \"as if in the act of writing something were continuously coming true and completing itself, not as if it were leading to something.\" [22] A rose is a rose is a rose. And a universe is a universe is a universe.\n\nIt was in this spirit that James Lee Byars (Jimmie) and Brockman (Johnnie) began an intense dualogue that evolved from Byars' interest in Brockman's first book, By the Late John Brockman, and Brockman's fascination with Byars' notion of the Steins: Einstein, Gertrude Stein, Wittgenstein, and Frankenstein.\n\nByars believed that to arrive at an axiology of societal knowledge, it was pure folly to go to a Widener Library and read 3.5 million books. (In this regard, he kept only four books at a time in a box in his minimally furnished room, replacing books as he read them.) This led to his creation of the World Question Center in 1970, in which he planned to gather the 100 most brilliant minds in the world together in a room, lock them behind closed doors, and have them ask each other the questions they were asking themselves. The expected result, in theory, was to be a synthesis of all thought. But between idea and execution are many pitfalls. Byars identified his 100 most brilliant minds, called each of them, and asked what questions they were asking themselves. The result: 70 people hung up on him.\n\nBy 1971, Byars and Brockman were conducting a conversation during frequent walks in New York's Central Parkâa dualogue consisting of communicating to each other in the interrogative mood.\n\nAsking questions. They catalogued some of their best lines, assembled from dozens of notebooks, hundreds of handwritten pages, reduced to 100 sentences, one to a page. The privately published work is entitled: He confuses l and 2 the 200 I.Q.,by James Lee Byars and John Brockman.\n\nHere's a sampling: [23]\n\nHe confuses l and 2 the 200 I.Q.\n\nHe likes sentences that go 100 ways at once. You can't tell where the subject is, what the subject is.\n\nWears his hat to deny his head.\n\nHe wants it written so that at the end of the book you can't imitate, can't possibly think of anything he's done. Written so each sentence has in all its parts an openness.\n\nLines that are too easy can't attract complexity: have to write for subtle people, not for the world.\n\nIs self-conscious option enough?\n\nLike a dream, like a vision, like a bubble, like a shadow, like dew, like lightning was his 8th name.\n\nThe book: artifice. Show them your notes.\n\nAt first sight do you perceive the full potential of a circumstance?\n\nHe can't remember it before he pays attention to it.\n\nThank God for the names of the body.\n\nPeople pay twice for describing.\n\nBuy my head for life, think of you only, won't think of anything else.\n\nHis product's fame.\n\nSpeaking and writing styles are always the same. Nobody can write, nobody can talk.\n\nDismiss yourself.\n\nThe great personal hallucination: he.\n\nI comma the complete history of the world?\n\nIs there an imaginary question?\n\nHe married 12 women by mail and lived with them hypothetically.\n\nThe sentence, being strong, on both sides being equivocal.\n\nThe world is so fantastic why make up?\n\nWhich questions have disappeared?\n\nTo accomplish the extraordinary, you must seek extraordinary people. That's a question.\n\nHe collected a million minutes of attention.\n\nI'll have to think about it; I just thought about it.\n\nIt's funny to be news?\n\nNobody knows and you can't find out; there's no point in describing what you don't know.\n\nWho can talk of one anymore.\n\nHe whistled e=mc2 all year long.\n\nJust to name things.\n\nHe's the incorrigible pronoun problem.\n\nI can repeat the question but am I bright enough to ask it?\n\nHe's not difficult, he's just not interested in you or your ideas.\n\nWhat was an animal?\n\nThe brightest of all angels. His first words to God: \"Give me a world to run.\"\n\nMeditate the putrifying corpse.\n\nDo all possibilities exist in any?\n\nHe's trying to hold on to his body, his life: it's a horrible experience.\n\nIf you ask for something that doesn't exist, you deserve it on the intelligence of the request.\n\nNumbers don't count?\n\nHe's the person they pretend doesn't exist.\n\nFrom fairest creatures we desire increase.\n\nHe's so in love with the cosmos that he has to pretend anger.\n\nA single line can be a complete autobiography.\n\nHe's making his fame by saying \"He's right.\"\n\nHe \"sees\" words as they are spoken (never having learned how to think).\n\nThink yourself away?\n\nHe displayed and edited 3 people as public information.\n\nHave we eaten of the insane root?\n\nEpitaph: kicking the shit out of physical phenomena.\n\nThe only thing left for him is the unreal.\n\nMen whose heads do grow beneath their shoulders.\n\nThe extraordinary god at the Japanese shrine deals with all forgotten material.\n\nHe likes sentences that go 100 ways at once. You can't tell where or what the subject is.\n\nBut these are only words.\n\nThe White House\n\nBy the 1970s, Brockman was making his mark as the first cybernetics consultant, successfully employing the ideas from the new science of cybernetics to a wide array of applications. One project he was planning involved reaching into the inner-city community to work with the serious problem that had been identified by Senator Daniel Moynihan: addressing the fact that generation after generation of black children in the inner cities were growing up without fathers.\n\nIn pursuit of this agenda, he sent letters to both the Ford and Rockefeller Foundations, in each case, to people he knew and had already worked with. In the letters, he pointed to his success in bringing new communication ideas, such as cybernetics, to seemingly intractable problems.\n\nTo his surprise, the responses from Ford and Rockefeller were scathing, accusing him of instituting a regime of \"brainwashing.\" Shortly after, he wrote a second letter addressed personally to Richard M. Nixon, President of the United States. Within days, Brockman received a call from the President's secretary Evelyn Woods (of the \"18-minute gap\"), who said, \"President Nixon has asked me to respond to your interesting letter and to set up a meeting for you at the White House to meet with Secretary of Defense Melvin Laird and the Joint Chiefs of Staff.\"\n\nA few days later, Brockman was at the Pentagon to meet with Secretary Laird and the Joint Chiefs: JCS Chair Admiral Thomas H. Moorer; Admiral Elmo R. Zumwalt, Jr., Chief of Naval Operations; Army Chief of Staff General William C. Westmoreland; Air Force Chief of Staff General John D. Ryan; and Marine Corps Commandant General Leonard F. Chapman, Jr.\n\nThe agenda was to hear Brockman's ideas on a specific national security issue. U.S. soldiers were deployed in Vietnam, and marijuana use was widespread. The commanding officers were aware of the situation but let it pass. They were, however, adamant that smoking dope or shooting heroin on a nuclear submarine could not be tolerated.\n\nAt the Pentagon meeting, each of the abovementioned chiefs attended with a serviceman, who was a heroin addict. The White House then proceeded to hired him as a consultant on how to deal with this situation. Brockman is sometimes asked about this work and its results. Due to security issues, he can't get into specifics. Rather, his response is to ask, \"How many US nuclear submarines have blown up lately?\"\n\nThe AUM Conference\n\nIn 1973, Brockman was invited by Alan Watts, John C. Lilly, and Heinz von Foerster to Esalen at Big Sur, to speak at the AUM Conference (American University of Masters). Brockman's friend Hans Ulrich Obrist has described the premise of AUM: It is \"comprised of those maverick intellectuals whose authority derived from their persona, ideas, and work, and not from their institutional affiliations.\" [24]\n\nThe goal of the 1973 conference was to study G. Spencer Brown's book, The Laws of Form. Brockman was a last-minute replacement for the keynote speaker, theoretical physicist Richard Feynman, who had been hospitalized. Brockman, who has been known to say that \"Life is the theatre of one chance,\" jumped at the opportunity to spend a week getting to know the architects of cybernetics and talking to them about his own contemporaneous writing exploring 2nd-order cyberneticsâthe self-referential systems that focused on, in von Foerster's coinage, \"the cybernetics of cybernetics.\"\n\nIt was at the American University of Masters (AUM) conference where Brockman stumbled into becoming a book agent. Everyone there was an authorâsome had No.1 bestsellersâbut nobody had an agent. Several of them said, 'You know how to do business, why don't you take care of our books?' He did just that, and sold Lilly's book idea, officially launching his literary agency, John Brockman Associates (now Brockman, Inc.) in 1973. [25]\n\nThe Home Computer Handbook\n\nWith Edwin Schlossberg & Lynn Horton, Brockman co-authored The Home Computer Handbook (1978), the first trade book on the personal computer.\n\nIFEL Magazine, Special Paris Issue, September 1973\n\nIn the late 1960s, the Canadian artists AA Bronson, Felix Partz, and Jorge Zontal formed an arts collective called General Idea, which explored themes such as self-mythology, spectacle, appropriation, parody, media deconstruction, an ironic interest in commerce, and the semiotics of advertising language.\n\nThe group came together in Toronto in the late 1960s, galvanized by the decade's psychedelic counterculture and experimental art practices, and its politics of protest and communal living. General Idea took aim at the myths of consumer affluence, patriarchal power, and technological progress that shaped life in North America after World War IIâmyths they argued were sustained by cultural forms and images that spread through society like a virus. The group's strategy, drawing from Susan Sontag's idea of camp and from the queer science fiction of William S. Burroughs, was to appropriate these cultural forms and images, exposing their power and using their viral nature to spread alternative, more subversive, messages.\n\nGeneral Idea's first major experiment in appropriation was their 1970â71 \"Miss General Idea Pageant,\" in which they emulated a beauty pageant to mock the competition of the art world. Over the coming years, General Idea appropriated the mythic forms of postwar militarism, fashion, and architecture. They circulated the resulting artworks through a network of correspondence artists they called 'The Subliminal,' and in the pages of their own journal FILE. The group eventually assembled these various projects into a vast mythological apparatus, which they explained would one day be housed in the 1984 Miss General Idea Pageant Pavilion. Though never built, this planned museumlike structure was the subject of exhibitions, artist books, and a set of 289 explanatory \"showcards.\" [26]\n\nTheir Special Paris Issue in September 1973 (IFEL Magazine) was a parody of both Life magazine and By the Late John Brockman.\n\nYou Are Truly Invisible When... striding on the subliminal, one step ahead of the reductio ad absurdum and one step behind the reductio ad logicum....\n\nDangerously consistently outside their field of vision. a trifle sad and... suddenly you are not there.\n\nCross all borders. Sneak past the fashion guards and steal away the Glamour Myth! Counterfeit! Interphase! Camouflage! Throw away old disguises and give your overworked lighting man a holiday, 'cause the spotlight is not on youâit's through you. You have broken the visibility barrier, way past Ultra-violet; all the images in the Image Bank lie scattered and your no mean feat; you've got nothing to wear to John Brockman's party. Oh dear! What could the matter be when there's no matter to be . . .\n\nAfterwords\n\nIn 1973, Anchor Press published Brockman's third book, Afterwords, as part of a collected works edition that included the first two, at which time he announced that he had accomplished what he had set out to do and stopped writing, moving on to a new career as a literary and software agent, and launching John Brockman Associates. In an epilogue to Afterwords, Von Foerster wrote:\n\nAfterwords to John Brockman's Afterwords should best be written by John Brockman. In fact, he wrote it. It is Afterwords. They are put into 292 propositions to be found on pages paginated correspondingly. He who holds paginated blank pages against my counting them as propositions still travels in the semantic universe of forewords. Forewords are propositions which are designed to do some other words: those which follow.\n\nAfterwords undo themselves, including their precursors. Post-Wittgensteinian epistemologists first wrestled with, and are now slowly beginning to understand, the last proposition (No. 7) of Wittgenstein's Tractatus Logico Philosophicus: Of which we cannot speak we have to remain silent. Brockman understands. Afterwords silence themselves. His last proposition (No. 292) is: Nobody knows, and you can't find out.\n\nOK. If this is so, why bother? Because Afterwords takes the mystery of language and puts it right back into its own mystery; that is, Afterwordsexplains the mystery of language by taking language out (ex-) of the plane of its mystery, so as to become visible to all before it slips back into its plane. This in itself is a remarkable achievement that has been denied to almost all linguists, for they stick to the description of the plane without seeing that it is the plane that holds their descriptions. . . .The blessed curse of a meta-language is that it wears the cloth of a first-order language, an object language. Thus, any proposition carries with it the tantalizing ambiguity: Was it made in meta- or in object-language? And thus: \"Nobody knows, and you can't find out.\" . . .\n\nAll who are concerned about the violence committed in the name of language will appreciate the useful uselessness of Brockman's un-book.\n\nThe publication of Afterwords was followed by a volume of essays entitled After Brockman: A Symposium, in which artists, poets, and scientists commented on Brockman's trilogy. Jay Bail, editor of the San Francisco Book Review, wrote:\n\nThere are certain writers whose thought is so important that it doesn't matter whether you agree with them or not. A verbal tension so powerful, an ascetic appetite so huge and consuming forces us both to accept the vision as a revelation and to resist it as a duty. . . .\n\nFor John Brockman is the kind of writer you both agree with and don't agree with at all.\n\nEither way you must pay a profound attention to what he says in this remarkable book. In short, sharp strokes of words, he breaks through the very forest of meaning by denying meaning, eschewing traditional forms of activities, thoughts and emotions. It is not what he says that is so valuable; it is his whole manner of negating what can be said. His words backtrack on themselves, stalk their own meanings, and thrash about in the underbrush of our sensibilities. There is a total devastation of language, isolating and withering the very hands our dreams are made of.\n\nAnd the literary critic Richard Kostelanetz commented:\n\nJohn Brockman's three books are not as incomprehensible as they might initially seem; indeed they are at base quite simple. The first takes information theoryâthe mathematical theory of communicationsâas a model for regarding all human experience. The second is a print portrait of Heisenberg's theory of indeterminacy. The third investigates the limits of words as tools for understanding. What distinguishes this trilogy is not their informing hypotheses, which are familiar to various degrees, but the author's unfettered exploration of their implications. I also admire enormously their style and structure, as well as their remarkable capacity to implant themselves in the reader's mind. [27]\n\nPublication of About Bateson, 1977\n\nGregory Bateson was one of the most important and least understood thinkers of the 20th century. Bateson, who originated the double-bind theory of schizophrenia, was the first to apply cybernetic theory to the social sciences and made important biological discoveries about such nonhuman species as the dolphin. His book, Steps to an Ecology of Mind, published in 1972, attracted widespread attention.\n\nBrockman and Bateson met in April 1973 at the AUM Conference and immediately became friends. With Bateson's blessing, Brockman conceived of an edited volume entitled About Bateson, which featured seven essays by eminent thinkers, containing their interpretations of and reactions to Bateson's work.\n\nNora Bateson, Gregory Bateson, and Brockman\n\nat AUM Conference, 1973\n\nAt that time, Bateson contended that advances in cybernetics and fundamental mathematics had resulted in shifts in many other areas of thought. In The Evolutionary Idea, a proposed new book, he planned to gather those new advances to present an alternative to then current orthodox theories of evolution. This alternative view was to stress the role of informationâthat is, of mind, in all levels of biology from genetics to ecology and from human culture to the pathology of schizophrenia. In place of the natural selection of organisms, Bateson considered the survival of patterns, ideas, and forms of interaction. \"Any descriptive proposition,\" Bateson said, \"which remains true longer will outsurvive other propositions which do not survive so long. This switch from the survival of the creatures to the survival of ideas which are immanent in the creatures (in their anatomical forms and in their interrelationships) gives a totally new slant to evolutionary ethics and philosophy. Adaptation, purpose, homology, somatic change, and mutation all take on new meaning with this shift in theory.\"\n\n\"Evolutionists are an anxious, conservative, and spiteful bunch,\" Bateson told Brockman in 1973. \"In fact, they kill each other.\" He was referring to the famous affair involving his father, William Bateson, the preeminent English biologist of his dayâwho, picking up on the work of Mendel, coined the word \"genetics\" and began the fieldâand Paul Kammerer, an Austrian biologist and Lamarckian who committed suicide after he was accused of doctoring his research to show the inheritance of acquired characteristics in the midwife toad. \"I don't think they will like this book very much,\" Bateson said, realizing that he would be straying far from the traditional debate of natural selection versus inherited characteristics. \"I shall not write the book. I am too old and too sick to fight the fight.\" [28]\n\nThe 1980s\n\nGuggenheim Museum: USCO Re-creation of 1965 \"Sames\" by Ken Dewey and Terry Riley\n\nIn 1980, Brockman, Gerd Stern, and Michael Callahan collaborated on a re-creation of the original November 20-21, 1965, Expanded Cinema Festival production of Kenneth Dewey's \"Sames\" at Film-Makers' Cinematheque.\n\nThe Reality Club\n\nThe Reality Club, co-founded in 1981 by Brockman and the physicist Heinz Pagels (executive director of the New York Academy of Sciences) and run by Brockman, was an informal group of adventurous intellectuals; its invitation-only membership roster reads like a Who's Who of American arts, science, politics, and business.\n\nFrom 1981 to 1989, the Reality Club met once or twice a month, usually in New York: in boardrooms at the New York Academy of Sciences or Rockefeller University or investment banking firms, Chinese restaurants, artists' lofts, ballrooms, museums, living rooms. Reality Club members presented rough drafts of their new work with the understanding that they would be challenged.\n\nThe club's hallmark was rigorous and sometimes impolite (but not ad hominem ) discourse consonant with its motto: \"To arrive at the edge of the world's knowledge, seek out the most complex and sophisticated minds, put them in a room together, and have them ask each other the questions they are asking themselves.\"\n\nAmong the more than seventy-five speakers were psychologist Rollo May, Zen master Richard Baker, political activist Abbie Hoffman, poets Michael McClure and Gerd Stern, essayist Annie Dillard, psychedelic experts Stanislav Grof and Terence McKenna, energy consultants Amory and Hunter Lovins, feminist Betty Friedan, computer scientist Edward Feigenbaum, plant physiologist Rupert Sheldrake, physicist Fritjof Capra, religious historian Elaine Pagels, anthropologist/shaman Michael Harner, avant-garde playwright Richard Foreman, gerontologist Roy Walford, sociologist Sherry Turkle, and Stewart Brand.\n\nThe Software Market\n\nThe introduction of IBM's personal computer in 1981 started a tsunami in the marketing of software. Until that time, the software market was still a lawless frontier. Pioneers were the guys with arrows in their backs. The way to make money in this gold rush was to sell eggs at 10 cents apiece.\n\nBrockman realized that, in effect, software programmers were writers. Not many people were aware that under United States law, anything one writesâwhether on paper, on a computer, or on a bronze tabletâis automatically subject to copyright. In other words, if you write it, you own it.\n\nWithin a few weeks of buying his own PC, Brockman was visiting the heads of the major New York publishing companies and pitching the idea that there was a huge untapped consumer market for easy-to-use software products.\n\nIt was a hard sell at first, and Brockman received a lot of blank stares. And once he had managed to convince the traditional trade book publishers that software would be the next big thing, he ran into the traditional software publishers (for example, Bill Gates of Microsoft and Mitch Kapor of Lotus), who argued that the model was more akin to that of a factory.\n\nBut soon, with a single phone call to the head of Simon & Schuster, Brockman licensed the pop-software program Typing Tutor III for a million dollars and went on to sell entire catalogues of computer-related trade books to the major New York publishersâcountless how-to books for the Apple II and the PC.\n\nWired took note:\n\nThe advent of personal computers brought his next truly transformative moment. In 1982, Brockman bought one of the first IBM PCs, and he quickly realized that software programmers were like writers: They needed agents. He tried to convince traditional trade publishers that software would be the next big thing.\n\n\"I said, 'There's this thing called software. It's already as big as dog food, and it will be as big as all publishing put together.\" Soon he was making the most lucrative deals of his career. He sold the pop-software program Typing Tutor III to Simon & Schuster [and] went on to hawk computer-related guides and instructional books . . . , series after series by the editors of computer magazines. In 1983 alone, Brockman reportedly sold $20 million worth of books. \"My father cornered the gladiola market in 1948,\" he says. \"I cornered the computer-book market in '83 and '84.\" [29]\n\nOne of those deals achieved a kind of mythic status: the 1983 sale of Stewart Brand's Whole Earth Software Catalog.\n\nAfter receiving Brockman's brief proposal, an editor at Doubleday made a pre-emptive offer of $1 million for the U.S. rights, planned as a paperback original. In full performance mode, Brockman hung up on him, one of his great moments as an agent. Fifteen minutes later, the panicked editor called back, and Brockman accepted his offer of $1.3 millionâat the time, the most expensive deal ever for a paperback original, which is still the case.\n\nFifth Generation AI\n\nBy 1983, Brockman had extended his interest in cybernetics to artificial intelligence. Over the years, he made a point to stay connected to the key researchers in the field. Among the early AI crowd were Marvin Minsky of MIT's AI Lab and John McCarthy at Stanford's AI Lab. Next came the second wave of expert-systems researchers, including Edward Feigenbaum and Yale computer scientist Roger Schank. In the early '80s, the big scare was \"They're coming, they're coming,\" a reference to the launching of Japan's government-sponsored Fifth Generation Computer Systems project to produce intelligent softwareâwhich created a panic among American AI researchers as it posed a threat to American dominance in AI research. To ascertain the threat level, Heinz Pagels of the New York Academy of Sciences convened a small private meeting to meet the leaders of the Japanese effort. Brockman was in the group of seven; the others were Minsky; McCarthy; Feigenbaum; Schank; Joseph Traub, chairman of Columbia's Computer Science Department; and Pamela McCorduck, author of Machines Who Think.The Japanese came and they went, as the Fifth Generation eventually fizzled.\n\n\"Information Wants to Be Free\"\n\nIn November 1984, Brockman and Stewart Brand were sitting next to each other at the front table at the first Hackers' Conference, which had been convened at an old Army base by the sea in Marin County. Brand had organized the conference with the help of Kevin Kelly; Brockman and software publisher Doug Carlston co-sponsored the event. All the original hackers were present when Brand tossed this off: \"On the one hand, information wants to be expensive because it's so valuable. The right information in the right place just changes your life. On the other hand, information wants to be free, because the cost of getting it out is lower and lower all the time. So you have these two things fighting against each other.\"\n\nA year later, in 1985, Kelly published a piece in CoEvolution Quarterly which acknowledged \"information wants to be free\" but he left out the first part. The result was that \"Information wants to be free\" became a mantra, then an ideology, almost a religion. For many, it was a cashbox for stock or speaker fees. What was most interesting was the tension of the two ideas fighting against each other and what happened to one half of the fight.\n\nThe \"Millionaires' Dinner\"\n\nAt the 1984 COMDEX (COMputer Dealers' EXhibition) conference in Atlanta, Brockman hosted a dinner to bring together the young emerging software moguls. The press jumped on it, and the reporters on the scene had some fun with the coinage of the \"Millionaires' Dinner.\"\n\nThe 1990s\n\nThe Third Culture\n\nIn collaboration with a group of leading scientists, Brockman wrote an influential essay in 1991 entitled \"The Third Culture.\" In it, he defined the Third Culture as \"those scientists and other thinkers in the empirical world who, through their work and expository writing, are taking the place of the traditional intellectual in rendering visible the deeper meanings of our lives, redefining who and what we are.\" [30]\n\nIn 1996, Brockman published his book The Third Culture: Beyond the Scientific Revolution, [31] which presented twenty-three essays by influential scientists on their work and their ideas. Among the contributors were biologists Richard Dawkins, Stephen Jay Gould, and Lynn Margulis; philosopher Daniel Dennett; physicists Murray Gell-Mann, Lee Smolin, and Alan Guth; mathematical physicist Roger Penrose; astrophysicist Martin Rees; psychologist Nicholas Humphrey; mathematician and computer scientist Marvin Minsky; and cognitive scientist Steven Pinker.\n\nIn his Introduction, Brockman wrote:\n\nIn the past few years, the playing field of American intellectual life has shifted, and the traditional intellectual has become increasingly marginalized. A 1950s education in Freud, Marx, and modernism is not a sufficient qualification for a thinking person in the 1990s. Indeed, the traditional American intellectuals are, in a sense, increasingly reactionary, and quite often proudly (and perversely) ignorant of many of the truly significant intellectual accomplishments of our time. Their culture, which dismisses science, is often nonempirical. It uses its own jargon and washes its own laundry. It is chiefly characterized by comment on comments, the swelling spiral of commentary eventually reaching the point where the real world gets lost.\n\nIn 1959 C. P. Snow published a book titled The Two Cultures. On the one hand, there were the literary intellectuals; on the other, the scientists. He noted with incredulity that during the 1930s the literary intellectuals, while no one was looking, took to referring to themselves as \"the intellectuals,\" as though there were no others. This new definition by the \"men of letters\" excluded scientists such as the astronomer Edwin Hubble, the mathematician John von Neumann, the cyberneticist Norbert Wiener, and the physicists Albert Einstein, Niels Bohr, and Werner Heisenberg.\n\nHow did the literary intellectuals get away with it? First, people in the sciences did not make an effective case for the implications of their work. Second, while many eminent scientists, notably Arthur Eddington and James Jeans, also wrote books for a general audience, their works were ignored by the self-proclaimed intellectuals, and the value and importance of the ideas presented remained invisible as an intellectual activity, because science was not a subject for the reigning journals and magazines.\n\nIn a second edition of The Two Cultures, published in 1963, Snow added a new essay, \"The Two Cultures: A Second Look,\" in which he optimistically suggested that a new culture, a \"third culture,\" would emerge and close the communications gap between the literary intellectuals and the scientists. In Snow's third culture, the literary intellectuals would be on speaking terms with the scientists. Although I borrow Snow's phrase, it does not describe the third culture he predicted. Literary intellectuals are not communicating with scientists. Scientists are communicating directly with the general public. Traditional intellectual media played a vertical game: journalists wrote up and professors wrote down. Today, third-culture thinkers tend to avoid the middleman and endeavor to express their deepest thoughts in a manner accessible to the intelligent reading public.\n\nThe recent publishing successes of serious science books have surprised only the old-style intellectuals. Their view is that these books are anomaliesâthat they are bought but not read. I disagree. The emergence of this third-culture activity is evidence that many people have a great intellectual hunger for new and important ideas and are willing to make the effort to educate themselves.\n\nThe wide appeal of the third-culture thinkers is not due solely to their writing ability; what traditionally has been called \"science\" has today become \"public culture.\" Stewart Brand writes that \"Science is the only news. When you scan through a newspaper or magazine, all the human interest stuff is the same old he-said-she-said, the politics and economics the same sorry cyclic dramas, the fashions a pathetic illusion of newness, and even the technology is predictable if you know the science. Human nature doesn't change much; science does, and the change accrues, altering the world irreversibly.\" We now live in a world in which the rate of change is the biggest change. Science has thus become a big story.\n\nScientific topics receiving prominent play in newspapers and magazines over the past several years include molecular biology, artificial intelligence, artificial life, chaos theory, massive parallelism, neural nets, the inflationary universe, fractals, complex adaptive systems, superstrings, biodiversity, nanotechnology, the human genome, expert systems, punctuated equilibrium, cellular automata, fuzzy logic, space biospheres, the Gaia hypothesis, virtual reality, cyberspace, and teraflop machines. Among others. There is no canon or accredited list of acceptable ideas. The strength of the third culture is precisely that it can tolerate disagreements about which ideas are to be taken seriously. Unlike previous intellectual pursuits, the achievements of the third culture are not the marginal disputes of a quarrelsome mandarin class: they will affect the lives of everybody on the planet.\n\nThe role of the intellectual includes communicating. Intellectuals are not just people who know things but people who shape the thoughts of their generation. An intellectual is a synthesizer, a publicist, a communicator. In his 1987 bookThe Last Intellectuals, the cultural historian Russell Jacoby bemoaned the passing of a generation of public thinkers and their replacement by bloodless academicians. He was right, but also wrong. The third-culture thinkers are the new public intellectuals.\n\nAmerica now is the intellectual seedbed for Europe and\n\nAsia. This trend started with the prewar emigration of Albert Einstein and other European scientists and was further fueled by the post- Sputnik boom in scientific education in our universities. The emergence of the third culture introduces new modes of intellectual discourse and reaffirms the preeminence of America in the realm of important ideas. Throughout history, intellectual life has been marked by the fact that only a small number of people have done the serious thinking for everybody else. What we are witnessing is a passing of the torch from one group of thinkers, the traditional literary intellectuals, to a new group, the intellectuals of the emerging third culture.\n\nScience Masters Book Series\n\nThe Science Masters series consisted of short, non-technical books for a general audience by scientists known for their popular writings. In collaboration with the British publisher Anthony Cheetham, Brockman developed the series, which debuted in 1994, with Basic Books. Proceeding with a list of twelve names of scientists who were already established in their fields and had written a \"big\" book on their subjects (John Barrow, Paul Davies, Richard Dawkins, Martin Rees, Ian Stewart, Daniel Dennett, Richard Leakey), he licensed the first twelve books of what became known as Science Masters I to twenty-six publishers around the world. Soon, another ten authors joined the series (Science Masters II).\n\nThe New York Times has described Brockman's modus operandi thusly:\n\nHe sells foreign rights to books himself, rather than letting publishers reap those profits, and prides himself on working a global market. . . .[H]e does not wait for the scientists to decide that it is time to review their careers and write for the ages. He recruits professors who have received good press for their work the way another agent might recruit actors or quarterbacks.\n\nActing as a book packager, something between an agent and a publisher, he created a Science Masters series of short, reader-friendly books by scientists like Dr. Pinker and Dr. Dennett and others who are not clients, like the paleontologist Stephen Jay Gould. He has sold the rights for this series worldwide. [32]\n\n\"The enticing collections roll in with impressive frequency (from) edge.org, a world-renowned online science salon . . . any curious reader can benefit from and be enthralled by Brockman's stimulating, jargonfree Edge books.\" âBooklist\n\nThe deals sent shock waves through the publishing industry, and, going forward, led to dramatic changes in the nature of the publishing business.\n\nContent.com\n\nWhile book publishers already had their own websites by 1995, Brockman and magazine publisher David Bunnell decided that year to co-found Content.com, an internet-based service intended to allow consumers to browse online according to their interestsâfor example, biographies, thrillers, travel books, etc.ârather than poring through multiple publishing websites. As the New York Times explained their plan:\n\n[P]ublishers would pay to have their books, authors and forums on Content.com. The service will also seek ads. American Express, for example,â¦ might be interested in sponsoring discussion forums in the travel book section. Subscribers will need access to the Internet, though they will not be charged for the basic service.\n\n[The] venture has created a stir among Internet enthusiasts . . . largely because of [Bunnell's] track record. The 47-year-old editor and publisher has founded some of the most successful computer magazines, starting with PC Magazine in 1981, followed by PC World and Macworld. . . . Mr. Bunnell will be president and chief executive of the company, while John Brockman, an author and literary agent who represents many technology and science writers, will be chairman. The company's first offering will be a service of on-line forums, discussion and information for readers and book publishers, [called] Book Channel. [33]\n\nHowever, the company never got off the ground, as its founders and interested investors realized that at that moment there was no way to monetize the business. It took another decade before people involved with the internet realized that the way to build a business on the internet was to lose money, lots of it.\n\nEdge.org\n\n\"The internet has created sites like John Brockman's wonderful edge.org, where it's possible for laymen to sit in on conversations between scientists. And when scientists have to address each other out of their specialisms, they have to speak plain English, they have to abandon their jargons, and we're the beneficiaries of that.\" âIan McEwan. [34]\n\nIncorporated by Brockman in 1996 as a 501(3) nonprofit foundation, Edge (edge.org) is the online instantiation of the Reality Club. As defined on the site, it is a living document on the Web that displays the third culture in action. Tim Adams of The Guardian observed:\n\nBrockman's cross-fertilising club, the most rarefied of chatrooms, has its premises on his website www.edge.org. Eavesdropping is fun. Ian McEwan, one of the few novelists who has contributed to Edge's ongoing debates, suggests that the project is not so far removed from the \"old Enlightenment dream of a unified body of knowledge, when biologists and economists draw on each other's concepts and molecular biologists stray into the poorly defended territory of chemists and physicists.\" [35]\n\nThe \"content\" of Edge is the group of people who connect in this way. As Brockman describes the site:\n\nThe ideas presented on Edge are speculative; they represent the frontiers of knowledge in the areas of evolutionary biology, genetics, computer science, neurophysiology, psychology, and physics. Some of the fundamental questions posed are: Where did the universe come from? Where did life come from? Where did the mind come from? Emerging out of the third culture is a new natural philosophy, founded on the realization of the import of complexity, of evolution. Very complex systems, whether organisms, brains, the biosphere, or the universe itself, were not constructed by design; all have evolved. . . .\n\nThrough the years, Edge has had a simple criterion for choosing contributors. We look for people whose creative work has expanded our notion of who and what we are. A few are best-selling authors or are famous in the mass culture. Most are not. Rather, we encourage work on the frontiers of the culture, and the investigation of ideas that have not been generally exposed. We are interested in \"thinking smart,\" not in received \"wisdom.\" In communications theory, information is not defined as data or input but rather as \"a difference that makes a difference.\" It is this level [that Edge hopes] our contributors will achieve. Edgeencourages people who can take the materials of the culture in the arts, literature, and science and put them together in their own way. We live in a mass-produced culture where many people, even many established cultural arbiters, limit themselves to secondhand ideas, thoughts, and opinions. Edge consists of individuals who create their own reality and do not accept an ersatz, appropriated reality. The Edge community consists of people who are out there doing it rather than talking about and analyzing the people who are doing it.\n\nEdge bears resemblance to the early seventeenth-century Invisible College, a precursor to the Royal Society. Its members consisted of scientists such as Robert Boyle, John Wallis, and Robert Hooke. The Society's common theme was to acquire knowledge through experimental investigation. Another inspiration is The Lunar Society of Birmingham, an informal club of the leading cultural figures of the new industrial ageâamong them James Watt, Erasmus Darwin, Josiah Wedgwood, Joseph Priestley, and Benjamin Franklin. While different from the Algonquin Roundtable or the Bloomsbury Group, Edge offers the same quality of intellectual adventure.\n\nIn a retrospective tribute, Nobelist Daniel Kahneman, Eugene Higgins Professor of Psychology emeritus at Princeton, wrote:\n\nIt seems like yesterday, but Edge has been up and running for twenty-two years. Twenty-two years in which it has channeled a fast-flowing river of ideas from the academic world to the intellectually curious public. The range of topics runs from the cosmos to the mind and every piece allows the reader at least a glimpse and often a serious look at the intellectual world of a thought leader in a dynamic field of science. Presenting challenging thoughts and facts in jargon-free language has also globalized the trade of ideas across scientific disciplines. Edge is a site where anyone can learn, and no one can be bored.[36]\n\nDigerati: Encounters with the Cyber Elite\n\nIn 1996, Brockman published Digerati: Encounters with the Cyber Elite, in which he wrote in a prologue:\n\nValue is in activity. Content is no longer a noun. Content is context. Content is activity. Content is relationship, community. Content is not text or pictures as distinct from the interactive components that provide access to them. Content is the interactive quality. Content is a verb, a continuing process. Value on the internet will be created through services, the selection of programming, the presence of other people, and assurance of authenticity, reliable information about sources of bits. In short, intellectual processes and services will appreciate; intellectual assets will depreciate. Content is information, and information is not a thing.\n\nAmong the twenty-three contributors to the book were Bill Gates (\"Companies are moving as fast as they can, and the marketplace is the judge of who gets these things right\"), W.Daniel Hillis \"[O]ver the long run, we have a chance of fundamentally changing humanity\"), Kevin Kelly (\"[C]ommunication is the basis of culture\"), John Markoff (\"A small anarchic community of wireheads and hackers made the mistake of giving fire to the masses. . . .It is paradise lost\"), and David Gelernter (\"[T]he most important aspect of the communication that people have is emotional . . .\"). The questions explored by them and the other digerati include: What is the nature of the next big thing? What kind of vocabulary do we need to describe it? Who is driving it? Who can render it visible for us? How does it change our culture, and ourselves?\n\nThe Edge Annual Question\n\nEach year, from 1998 to 2018, a question was posed to the Edgecommunity, who were invited to respond with short essays. Brockman holds that \"[t]he art of a good question is to find a balance between the abstract and the personal, to ask a question that has many answers that are grounded in experience but bigger than any experience alone.\" [37] The Edge Annual Question and the resulting essays were published collectively in book form the following year. Here is a list of the questions:\n\n1998: What questions are you asking yourself?\n\n1999: What is the most important invention in the past two thousand years?\n\n2000: What is today's most important unreported story?\n\n2001: What questions have disappeared?\n\n2001: What now?\n\n2002: What is your question? Why?\n\n2003: What are the pressing scientific issues for the nation and the world?\n\n2004: What's your law?\n\n2005: What do you believe is true even though you cannot prove it?\n\n2006: What is your dangerous idea?\n\n2007: What are you optimistic about?\n\n2008: What have you changed your mind about? Why?\n\n2009: What will change everything?\n\n2010: How is the internet changing the way you think?\n\n2011: What scientific concept would improve everybody's cognitive toolkit?\n\n.2012: What is your favorite deep, elegant, or beautiful explanation?\n\n2013: What should we be worried about?\n\n2014: What scientific idea is ready for retirement?\n\n2015: What do you think about machines that think?\n\n2016: What do you consider the most interesting recent [scientific] news?\n\n2017: What scientific term or concept ought to be more widely known?\n\n2018: What is the last question?\n\nRights Center, Inc.\n\nIn August 1999, with several technology colleagues, Brockman started RightsCenter (www.rightscenter.com), an extranet (private internet exchange) meeting place for authors, agents, and publishers. Based solely on the performance of his own literary agency, he calculated that use of the site would provide six-figure printing and shipping savings. In addition, the time needed to do business with overseas clients (which accounted for up to two-thirds of his agency's business) went to practically nothing. The site was up for a year; however, the major publishing houses weren't ready for the digital age and failed to engage.\n\nThe 2000s\n\n\"Everything is up for grabs. Everything will change. There is a magnificent sweep of intellectual landscape right in front of us.\"\n\nâDavid Gelernter, \"The Second Coming: A Manifesto.\"\n\nThe Billionaires' Dinner\n\nBy the year 2000, the crowd attending Brockman's annual dinner consisted of mostly the same peopleâalthough thanks to the exponential growth of the internet many had added three zeros to their net worth. Among the attendees at the February 24, 2000, dinnerâheld in conjunction with that year's TED conference, in Montereyâwere Web entrepreneur Brewster Kahle; Steve Riggio, CEO of Barnes & Noble; David Braunschvig, of Lazard Freres; Nathan Myhrvold, former chief technology officer at Microsoft; Danny Hillis, co-founder of Applied Minds; and Nicholas Negroponte, of the MIT Media Lab.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal took note:\n\nLike a lot of things in the frothy Internet world, it didn't take long for an annual get-together at one of the industry's trendiest conferences to show mindboggling growthâin this case a change in its name from the Millionaires' Dinner to the Billionaires' Dinner.\n\nAnd why not? Sure, precious few of the people at the dinner supping on ahi tuna and shrimp scampi on Thursday at Cibo restaurant actually had billions in net worth. But the crowd was sprinkled generously with those who had amassed wealth beyond imagining in a historical eye blink. The muscle and money behind tech stars such as Microsoft, America Online, Sun Microsystems and others had gathered at the Technology, Entertainment and Design Conference here.\n\nWhen the host, New York literary agent John Brockman, added three zeros to the dinner last year, there was more than a bit of giggly discomfort among the attendees. The general agreement was that the provocative Mr. Brockman, who also runs a discussion Web site called Edge.org, was poking fun more than offering a description. The \"B\" word, many attendees insisted, just wasn't for themâwho are really just regular people.
