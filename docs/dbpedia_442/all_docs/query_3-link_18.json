In September of 1969, he sent test transmissions between the computer at UCLA and the first Interface Message Processor (IMP) in order to develop the earliest protocols. On October 29, 1969, Charley attempted to remotely access the Stanford Research Institute (SRI) computer and managed to send the first letters of the word 'LOGIN' before the computer at SRI crashed. Later that day, he was able to successfully login to the SRI computer. At that moment, computer networking changed from a concept into a reality!\n\nCharley continued his research at UCLA and received a Ph.D. for his pioneering works on computer system security, network security and encryption protocols. He remained at UCLA and led research efforts into the fundamental concepts of distributed computing.\n\nCharley left UCLA to form Locus Computing Corporation, one of the largest Unix and open systems companies. Locus developed the AIX operating system for IBM as well as the first PC networks. After Locus, Charley has been involved with several startup companies.
