        "text": "Our program is committed to equity and diversity and encourages applications from all qualified studies, including women, people of any sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression, Indigenous Peoples, racialized people, and people with disabilities.\n\nAdmission requirements: DEADLINE FOR CLINICAL APPLICATIONS IS DECEMBER 1, 2024\n\nB.A.(Hon.) or B.Sc.(Hon.) in Psychology or equivalent combination of courses and experience in research (transcript from University)\n\nReferences - 3 references, ideally from someone who can speak about your interpersonal skills and academic/research skills\n\nStatement of research and clinical interests and plans - this should identify a possible supervisor (1 to 3 pages)\n\nUp-to-date CV (any format)\n\nIn-person or videoconferenced interviews for shortlisted candidates\n\nApplication fee of $120\n\nThe main admission route is for students entering Year 1 following completion of the B.A.(Honours) or equivalent.\n\nPlease review the policy on Reserved Admissions for Indigenous Students in the Graduate Program in Clinical Psychology.\n\nQualified Canadian applicants are given preference over non-Canadian applicants.\n\nAdmitted applicants generally have a mean average mark (over the previous 2 years of study) of 83-88%, have completed an honours degree, and are Canadian citizens. Few students with averages under 82% have been admitted, but there is no specific cutoff.\n\nIn the next year or two, provincial legislation may be introduced that will require our program to make admission conditional on passing a police check which would be required for any clinical practicum placement. This is not yet required.\n\nTo be placed in the health region for practicum placements you need to be able to pass a criminal record check. Students who cannot pass this cannot be admitted to the program because they cannot get placements and cannot get registered to practice post-PhD.\n\nAdditional Information:\n\nFor more information or to apply please see the College of Graduate and Postdoctoral Studies and information on financial support.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions:\n\nShould I have a potential supervisor identified?\n\nYour statement of research and clinical interests and plans should speak to potential supervisors and labs you would like to work with. Ideally, applicants will have checked to ensure potential supervisors are taking students. If they do not have time to meet with you to discuss your interest – this is typical. Many clinical supervisors from programs across the country, ours included, will interview applicants only after they have applied and made the interview shortlist. Any supervisor in psychology or an allied program on campus can be a research supervisor – your supervisor does not have to be in the clinical program. You will need to research areas of interest and make an argument to the potential supervisor that your research interests align.\n\nHow specific should the areas of interest listed in the online application be?\n\nThe statement of research and clinical interest needs to be detailed, well-reasoned, and well-written. Areas of interest listed in the online form are less important but should be consistent with the statement of research and clinical interests (also known as a letter of intent).\n\nWho should I get to write letters of reference?\n\nWe ask for 3 letters, and if you have an honours supervisor we pay a lot of attention to their letter. If you have volunteer experience this would be a good letter to get too – ideally one of your letter writers can speak about your interpersonal skills. The third letter should be someone who can speak to your academic and/or research skills.\n\nAre applicants required to apply for tri-agency funding?\n\nApplying for tri-agency funding demonstrates initiative, organization, and forethought and reflects well on a student. However, applying for tri-agency funding is not required. We do ask about it in interviews though!\n\nAs someone with a bachelor's degree, should I be applying to the MA or PhD program?\n\nUnless they already have a master’s degree, students should apply at the MA level. Our program is typically a MA to PhD transfer program, but we do have people who have a MA outside of clinical psychology apply to the PhD program.\n\nIs an honors degree required?\n\nHonours degree or equivalent is required, but almost all of the admitted students have an honours degree. If you have an equivalent degree, please detail how you feel what you have is equivalent to an honours degree.\n\nIs a psychology degree required?\n\nA psychology degree or equivalent in a related discipline is required. More importantly, students must have completed numerous senior psychology courses which are considered Foundational Knowledge to the profession of psychology and are typically met at the undergraduate level. Those with a degree in psychology typically have most of these Foundational Knowledge (using ACPRO language) or General Psychology Core Content Courses (using CPA language) addressed. More information on the foundational knowledge is in the ACPRO Position Statement and CPA accreditation resources.\n\nThe basic knowledge for the discipline that is typically met at the undergraduate level includes 1) biological bases of behaviour & psychopharmacology; 2) cognitive and affective bases of behaviour; 3) social and cultural bases of behavior; 4) individual differences, diversity, growth, and lifespan development; and 5) the history of psychology.\n\nIt is common for clinical psychology students to have to take 1 or 2 of these core content courses after entering the clinical program, but we will not admit students whose undergraduate training does not address most of the core content areas of psychology.\n\nIs the GRE required for clinical?\n\nNo.\n\nAre students funded?\n\nYes, all students are funded in their pre-residency years through a variety of means; we figure this out after admissions shortlists are complete.\n\nHow should I answer this question on the online form: Is your ability to attend a graduate program with us dependent upon receiving funding from USask?\n\nStudents should indicate 'yes' - the clinical program funds all accepted students as needed (if they do not have other funding, such as tri-agency grants), so this factor is not used to evaluate applicants for admission.\n\nWhen will I hear back about if I have been accepted?\n\nWe follow CPA guidelines and ensure our first-round offers go out by 1 April. We typically provide these before this deadline. All CPA-Accredited clinical programs have an agreement that first-round offer spots are held until mid-April to give students who have multiple offers some method for managing these offers."
