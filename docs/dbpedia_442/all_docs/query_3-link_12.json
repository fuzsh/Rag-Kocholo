        "text": "My wife asked you something about CM and found you were looking for stories. Here's mine:\n\n-------------\n\nIn 1987 I was do some work in Artificial Intelligence. I became a big fan of Marvin Minsky. That led me to someone I had not heard of before: Danny Hillis. I bought Danny's PhD dissertation (about the Connection Machine) and read it. About that time I interviewed at a company that didn't seem all that appealing at the time: Science Applications International Corporation. During the interview, a manager mentioned that they probably had access to every kind of super-computer except a Cray in the office. I more or less mumbled: \"probably not a Connection Machine\". That manager heard (good ears!) and said: \"Did you say Connection Machine? We have one downstairs. Do you want to see it.\". I want from \"I don't want this job\" to \"I'll sell my first-born to get it\" in a flash! When I got an offer to work on the CM at SAIC I told my wife I would do it for free. She thought that was not the best negotiating position and suggested I keep that idea to myself. Smart lady.\n\nWhen was hired, I was a \"Connection Machine\" expert despite the fact that the only thing I new about it was from reading Danny's dissertation. I did make that clear to SAIC but as is often the case \"expert\" just means \"knows more than anyone else in the room\". Before SAIC, I was programming in Lisp and the CM was programmed in \"*Lisp\" so it was a great fit. I spent several years doing my dream job. It was very difficult to pull myself away and go home at the end of the day. Our use of the CM was through DARPA. Eventually contracts moved on, \"our\" CM was taken away. I did some other CM work on a remote machine for awhile after before switching to more traditional architectures.\n\n------\n\nIf you hear of any actual CM-2's that are up an running anywhere, I would love to know about them! I still long to do that kind of data-parallel programming and would consider just about anything to be able to do it again."
