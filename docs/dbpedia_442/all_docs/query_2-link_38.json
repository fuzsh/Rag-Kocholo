Rice Chair in the Center for Memory and Recording Research at UCSD, has established a new endowment fund called the Shannon Graduate Fellowship Fund. The purpose of this endowed fellowship is to honor an outstanding graduate student at UCSD whose research is in the field of information theory. The naming of the fund is to commemorate the achievements of the late Claude E. Shannon, a Bell Labs mathematician who in 1948 originated the “information theory” on which the fundamental principles of digital telecommunications and information storage are based. The income from the endowment will be used to fund a graduate fellowship that well be awarded annually. The selection of the Shannon Fellow will be announced at the CMRR Shannon Memorial Lecture which is held annually on Claude Shannon’s birthday, April 30th.\n\nRecipients\n\nPaolo Minero - April 2008\n\nYuzhe Jin - April 2009\n\nEhsan Ardestanizadeh - April 2010\n\nHessam Mahdavitar - September 2011\n\nJayadev Acharya - May 2012\n\nLele Wang - May 2013\n\nAnanda Theertha Suresh – May 2014\n\nVeeresh Taranalli - December 2015\n\nJoseph Connelly - October 2016\n\nHamed Omidvar – November 2017\n\nHeng Qiao – June 2019\n\nShubhanshu Shekhar - November 2020\n\nAyush Jain and Hanwen Yao - 2021"
