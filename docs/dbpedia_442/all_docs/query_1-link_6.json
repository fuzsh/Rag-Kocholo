        "text": "There's Science Fiction books in which the dates of things are so many years A.S. where the A.S. stands for \"After Shannon\". In some sense, if you look at human civilization, the sudden change in human civilization that was created by the digital revolution, computers... happened at such a short period of time that there's nothing else like that in history.\n\nSo it could very well be that historically people will look back and say \"what happened there?\" And if you were going to tie it to anybody, Shannon is the one that gave us the tools that people would still be using in the future.\n\nSo it's not so implausible that people would start measuring years after Shannon."
