        "text": "Hello how are you my name is Pade Abiri, i am a 27 year old uni student and when i am not at uni i am looking after my one year old son or i am at work.\n\ni was born in Africa then came to England and have been here for 26 years i would love love go and live back in Africa as soon as i sort everything out i am going back.\n\nHere are some of my assignments and class activities\n\nActivity on video (Habits of Successful College Students)\n\nSummarise contents of video:\n\nYou should always show up to your classes if not you will miss out on things that go on. The student s who come to most or all of their classes will do a lot better when it comes to exams and getting the work done.\n\nIf you can’t make it to a class or lecture email or call your lecturer so you can get the work or sheets that you missed. If it is possible you could ask a friend or another class mate for help. When you miss classes it takes you long to catch up with what you missed and it will take out time from your next class or classes.\n\nIt is best that you should always come prepared to all your lectures and classes e.g. pens and paper. If you are on time or early to class it shows more seriousness.\n\nThere are so called friends that will try and get you not to pay attention in class or not to go. This can have serious effect on your studies and motivation towards university.\n\nIts better to hand in work early so you can get feed back from your tutor or lecturer and if it is not left to last minuet you will not feel under pressure and have more time to get it done.\n\nWhat are you good at already?\n\nI am good at getting to my classes on time\n\nI am good at working in a team and helping others\n\nI am good at taking instructions and flowing\n\nI am good at giving presentations\n\nI am good at making friends in classes\n\nWhere do you need to improve? How do you plan to do that (be specific – as explained in the video)?\n\nI need to make sure I contact my lecturer if I won’t be able to come into class.\n\nCritical thinking\n\nActivity #1\n\nActivity #2\n\nPassage 1: in the West, all life forms are divided into one of two categories: plant or\n\nanimal. Animals move and take in food. Plants are rooted into the earth in some way and\n\nlack locomotion. They photosynthesise their food. Zoologists study animals, and\n\nbotanists study plants. Bacteria were classified as plants because many kinds of bacteria\n\nphotosynthesise their food. However, they also have locomotion. Recent research has\n\nshown that there is an enormous variety of bacteria. Some are able to survive at\n\nextreme temperatures and in the absence of oxygen. Most plants cannot usually survive B P I 2 0 1 4 – 1 5 W e e k 5 – C r i t i c a l T h i n k i n g ( c o n t )\n\nB P I 201 4 – 1 5 W e e k 5 – C r i t i c a l T h i n k i n g ( c o n t ) Page 2\n\nin those conditions. Therefore, even though bacteria photosynthesise, they are not now\n\nregarded as plants.\n\nPassage 2: The difficulty in categorising bacteria was partly based on the assumption\n\nthat all life forms were divided into two main categories, plants and animals.. Organisms\n\nthat photosynthesised and lacked mobility were classified as plants; those that had\n\nlocomotion and ingested food were classifies as animals. Bacteria were traditionally\n\ncategorised as plants because many forms of bacteria photosynthesised their food like\n\nplants. However, bacteria also have locomotion, associated with animal life. Genetic\n\nresearch has now shown that there are at least eleven major divisions of bacteria, all of\n\nwhich are more genetically distinct than plants are from animals (Fuhrman et al., 1992).\n\nIn addition, the minute organisms formerly described as ‘bacteria’ are now found to\n\nconsist of several major kingdoms and domains of unicellular and multi-cellular life\n\n(bacteria, archaea, eucarya) (Woese, 1994). This research is significant as it has shown\n\nthat the fundamental division of all life forms into ‘plant’ or ‘animal’ was an error, and\n\nthat plants and animals form only a very small part of a much more diverse range of\n\nliving organisms.\n\nthis is descriptive writing as it has wots of description it the text.\n\nActivity #3 – Tour Guide for an Alien\n\nWhat is a game?\n\nA game is a sport or activity in which groups of people (known as teams) play against each other, within a time limit, to score points. The team of people with the highest score of points at the end of the game are the winners and the team of people with the lowest score of points are the losers.\n\nWhy are there no female players?\n\nIn this particular game men and females do not play with or against each other as the strengths and abilities of men and females can vary vastly. This could be seen as unfair advantages/disadvantages, therefore females play the game with other female players and men play the game with other male players.\n\nWhy do people get so passionate watching other people play games?\n\nPeople get passionate watching others play games as the person usually feels some sort of connection to the team they are watching. Maybe because they have history of watching their teams games for a long period time which has helped build a bond or ‘team spirit’ with the players. Also, no one likes to lose so the passion of wanting to win the game will always be present.\n\nWhat is a team?\n\nA team is a number of people/players that are working together to win the game.\n\nWhy can’t people in their seats just go down on the field and join in?\n\nThis game like most has rules. Only a certain number of people are allowed to play the game on each team at one time. If the crowd watching were allowed to join in there would be too many people playing the game and too much confusion and chaos caused.\n\nActivity #4\n\nMy mum is the best mum on earth\n\nI think that is an opinion because you don’t know the other persons mum or every mum there is.\n\nMy dad is taller than your dad.\n\nI think this could be a fact because the dad in question might actually not be as tall.\n\nMy telephone number is hard to memorise\n\nI think that is a fact because the number might be hard for the owner to memorise the numbers could possible very random.\n\nThe deepest part of the ocean is 35,813 feet deep\n\nThat is a fact it has been proven that the deepest part of the ocean is 35,900 feet deep.\n\nDogs make better pets than turtles\n\nI think this is an opinion because the person or people making the statement may not like turtles or could have possible had a bad experience whit them.\n\nSmoking is bad for your health\n\nThis is a fact it has been proven over the years through sickness and many deaths.\n\nEighty- five present of all cases of lung cancer in the uk is caused by smoking\n\nThis is a fact the research has been done.\n\nIf you flatten and stretch out a slinky toy it will be 87 feet long.\n\nI think this could be a fact or an opinion depending on the size of the slinky toy.\n\nSlinky toys are fun\n\nI think this is an opinion because some people might like slinky toys some people might not.\n\nOne in every hundred UK citizen is colour blind\n\nI think this an opinion because the person or people who made the statement may have come across a lot of colour blind people.\n\nTwo out of 10 uk citizens are boring\n\nHomework\n\nCritical thinking/writing is thoroughly analysing, questioning and examining any previous knowledge or theories as opposed to automatically believing what we have already been told to be true, which would be more descriptive.\n\nDescriptive writing is mainly the reflection or explanation of things that are said to have happened without any real evidence to support the views.\n\nIt is usually not hard to tell the difference between fact and opinion, however sometimes it can be hard to tell between the two. Facts are mostly a form of statistic that can easily be researched and checked, however an opinion is the view of one or many people which may not be entirely true even though they may think it is.\n\nSometimes hearing the same opinion more than once or from multiple people may lead to that particular opinion to be believed as a fact.\n\nMy research\n\nDanny Hillis\n\nDanny Hillis is an inventor he was born in Baltimore Maryland in 1956. His father William Hillis was an Air force epidemiologist studying hepatitis in Africa. Dannie’s mother Argye Briggs Hillis was a biostatistician who home schooled him for a period of time while they lived in Calcutta India. This is also the time were Danny developed an early appreciation for mathematics and biology. David Hillis is a professor evolutionary biology at the university of Texas at Austin this is the brother of Danny. Argye E Hillis is a professor of neurology at John Hopkins university and is also the sister of Danny.\n\nDanny himself studied at MIT and graduated with a BS Degree in mathematics followed by another degree in electrical engineering and computer science specialising in robotics. He later on worked for MIT in the Logo laboratory developing computer hardware and software for children. He designed computer-oriented toys and games for the Milton Bradley Company and co-founded Terrapin software. Terrapin software is computer software for elementary schools also he built a digital computer composed of Tinkertoys. This computer is now on display in the ` Museum of Science in Boston USA. Also designed tendon-control robot arms and a touch-sensitive robot skin.\n\nThinking Machines Corp. was the leading innovator in massive parallel supercomputers and RAID disk arrays. In addition to designing the company’s major products, Hillis worked closely with his customers in applying parallel computers to problems in astrophysics, aircraft design, financial analysis, genetics, computer graphics, medical imaging, image understanding, neurobiology, materials science, cryptography and subatomic physics.\n\nHillis major research was into parallel computing that’s what lead him to design the Connection Machine a parallel supercomputer in 1983. Hillis then went on and co-founded Thinking Machines Corporation to produce and market supercomputers based on his design. In 1985 while conducting his research Hillis received a PhD from MIT in electrical engineering and computer science under the doctoral advisers Gerald Jay Sussman, Mavin Minsky and Claude Shannon. Hillis thesis won the ACM Distinguished Dissertation prize for 1985.\n\nThinking Machines\n\nThe thinking Machines Corporation was developed to combine the connection machine Hillis designed into commercial parallel supercomputers and to explore computational pathways to building artificial intelligence. Hillis had a lot of ambition for his invention and life as he had the motto “were building a machine that will be proud of us” his parallel architecture was the component for this task.\n\nThe organizing principle of the brain is parallelism. Massive Parallelism is used. The information is in the connection between a lot of very simple parallel units working together. So if we built a computer that was more along that system of organization, it would likely be able to do the same kinds of things the brain does.\n\nHillis is also Judge Widney Professor of Engineering and Medicine of the University of Southern California (USC), professor of research medicine at the Keck School of Medicine, and research professor of engineering at the Viterbi School of Engineering.\n\nHillis built a technical team up of many people that would one day become leaders in the science and industry. Thinking Machines were the market leader in parallel supercomputers, with sales of about $65 million.\n\nDuring 1994 Thinking Machine filed for bankruptcy and in 1996 Hillis left from being a professor at MIT Media Lab and joined the Walt Disney Company in a newly created roll Vice President for research and Development for Disney Imagineering. Hillis clams this was an early ambition for him.\n\nHow has it benefited us\n\nHillis stated he had wanted to work at Disney ever since I was a child he remembered listening to Walt Disney on the television describing the Imagineers who designed Disneyland. From then he decided that one day he would work for Disney and become an Imagineer. This was a good start for Hillis as he was into magic then he found a different kind of magic the magic of bringing computers into Disney\n\nAt Disney, Hillis developed new technologies as well as business strategies for Disney’s theme parks, television, motion pictures, Internet and consumer products businesses. He also designed new theme park rides, a full sized walking robot dinosaur and various micro mechanical devices.\n\nThese are some bits from some articles Hillis has wrote\n\nTED2013\n\nVint Cerf: Actually, the Internet’s going to be just fine\n\nMarch 19, 2013\n\nOne of the greatest privileges of co-curating TED isn’t just getting to work with incredible speakers, but also talking with those in the audience. Danny Hillis gave a sobering presentation, “The Internet could crash. We need a Plan B,” at TED2013, detailing his concern at the exponential growth of the Internet, and the need for […]\n\nTechnology\n\nWhat the internet looked like in 1982: A closer look at Danny Hillis’ vintage directory of users\n\nMarch 18, 2013\n\nDanny Hillis registered the third domain name on the internet. You read that correctly — the third. In today’s talk, given at TED2013, he shares what a different world the ONLINE COMMUNITY felt like at that point in time. To underscore the point, Hillis brought a book onstage with him. It’s the ARPANET Directory, a […]\n\nSCIENCE\n\nDefending the internet itself: Danny Hillis at TED2013\n\nFebruary 27, 2013\n\nDanny Hillis has a book. It’s a directory of everyone in the world who had an internet address in 1982, including the names, addresses and telephone numbers. And it was a very thin phonebook. That was the community. It was a tight community where everyone knew and trusted each other. Hillis has been a fixture […]\n\nWhat books did he write or what has he published\n\nHillis has published scientific papers in journals such as Science, Nature, Modern Biology, Communications of the ACM and International Journal of Theoretical Physics and is an editor of several other scientific journals, including Artificial Life, Complexity, Complex Systems, Future Generation Computer Systems and Applied Mathematics. He has also written extensively on technology and its implications for publications such asNewsweek, Wired, Forbes ASAP and Scientific American\n\nHillis has also written two books The Pattern on The Stone volume 1: The simple Ideas and The Pattern on The Stone: How Computers Work"
