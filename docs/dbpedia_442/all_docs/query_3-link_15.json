        "text": "When she founded the Thinking Machines Corporation here in 1983, Sheryl L. Handler was an unlikely candidate to become a major figure in the highly technical field of supercomputers. Ms. Handler had spent the past dozen years running her own economic development consulting firm and while she had a doctorate from M.I.T. it was in urban planning, not computer science.\n\nBut Ms. Handler, 45 years old, has spent most of her professional life ignoring preconceived notions about business. In Thinking Machines, the country's second-largest supercomputer maker, behind Cray Research, she has built an offbeat but disciplined organization.\n\nMs. Handler has been somewhat of a mystery figure in the esoteric world of supercomputers, preferring to remain in the background as Danny Hillis, the company's chief scientist, has taken on the role of corporate frontman. \"I prefer that the focus be on the company, not on me,\" she said in a rare interview last week as Thinking Machines unveiled its latest computer, a system selling for under $1 million.\n\nMs. Handler's concept for Thinking Machines was to bring together experts from a variety of backgrounds to create a new advanced computer.\n\nWith little more than a company name, Ms. Handler recruited such diverse talents as physicist Richard Feynman, artificial intelligence guru Marvin Minsky and computer scientist Jack Schwartz.\n\nThe key recruit turned out to be Mr. Hillis, a young computer genius and one of Mr. Minsky's graduate students at M.I.T. Mr. Hillis wanted to build a super-fast, high-performance computer that ran thousands of microprocessors simultaneously to solve a problem. The concept was called massively parallel processing.\n\nDespite contrasting personalities, Ms. Handler and Mr. Hillis built the new venture with miraculous speed. Their result, the Connection Machine, which used 64,000 microprocessors, was designed, built and introduced in three years.\n\nSince then, the still-privately held Thinking Machines has grown to nearly $100 million in revenue and 600 employees and has sold more than 100 of its computers.\n\nAnalysts who praise Thinking Machines for being at the leading edge of high-performance computing warn that Ms. Handler faces her biggest challenge now as competitive and economic pressures are making sales of the multimillion-dollar machines even tougher."
