        "text": "W. Daniel Hillis: I have always envied Alexander the Great, because he had Aristotle as a personal tutor. In those days, Aristotle knew pretty much everything there was to know. Even better, Aristotle understood the mind of Alexander. He understood which topics interested Alexander, what Alexander knew and did not know, and what kinds of explanations Alexander preferred. Aristotle had been a student of Plato, and he was himself a great teacher. We know from his writings that he was full of examples, explanations, arguments, and stories. Through Aristotle, Alexander had the knowledge of the world at his command.\n\nOf course no one today knows all that is known, in the sense that Aristotle did. Now there is far too much knowledge for that to be possible. The scientific revolution, and the technological revolution that followed it, led to a self-reinforcing explosion of knowledge. The explosion continues. Today not even the most highly trained scientist, the most scholarly historian, or the most competent engineer can hope to have more than a general overview of what is known. Only specialists understand most of the new discoveries in science, and even the specialists have trouble keeping up.\n\nThis problem isn't new. In 1945, Vannevar Bush wrote an essay for Atlantic Monthly about the problem of too much knowledge. He wrote:\n\nThere is a growing mountain of research. But there is increased evidence that we are being bogged down today as specialization extends. The investigator is staggered by the findings and conclusions of thousands of other workers—conclusions that he cannot find time to grasp, much less to remember, as they appear. Yet specialization becomes increasingly necessary for progress, and the effort to bridge between disciplines is correspondingly superficial.\n\nBush's imagined solution to this problem was something he called Memex. Memex was envisioned as a system for manipulating and annotating microfilm (computers were just then being invented). The system would contain a vast library of scholarly text that could be indexed by associations and personalized to the user. Although Memex was never built, the World Wide Web, which burst onto the scene half a century later, is a rough approximation of it.\n\nAs useful as the Web is, it still falls far short of Alexander's tutor or even Bush's Memex. For one thing, the Web knows very little about you (except maybe your credit card number). It has no model of how you learn, or what you do and do not know—or, for that matter, what it does and does not know. The information in the Web is disorganized, inconsistent, and often incorrect. Yet for all its faults, the Web is good enough to give us a hint of what is possible. Its most important attribute is that it is accessible, not only to those who would like to refer to it but also to those who would like to extend it. As any member of the computer generation will explain to you, it is changing the way we learn.\n\nA New Tool for Learning\n\nLet's put aside the World Wide Web for a moment to consider what kind of automated tutor could be created using today's best technology. First, imagine that this tutor program can get to know you over a long period of time. Like a good teacher, it knows what you already understand and what you are ready to learn. It also knows what types of explanations are most meaningful to you. It knows your learning style: whether you prefer pictures or stories, examples or abstractions. Imagine that this tutor has access to a database containing all the world's knowledge. This database is organized according to concepts and ways of understanding them. It contains specific knowledge about how the concepts relate, who believes them and why, and what they are useful for. I will call this database the knowledge web, to distinguish it from the database of linked documents that is the World Wide Web.\n\nFor example, one topic in the knowledge web might be Kepler's third law (that the square of a planet's orbital period is proportional to the cube of its distance from the sun). This concept would be connected to examples and demonstrations of the law, experiments showing that it is true, graphical and mathematical descriptions, stories about the history of its discovery, and explanations of the law in terms of other concepts. For instance, there might be a mathematical explanation of the law in terms of angular momentum, using calculus. Such an explanation might be perfect for a calculus-loving student who is familiar with angular momentum. Another student might prefer a picture or an interactive simulation. The database would contain information, presumably learned from experience, about which explanations would work well for which student. It would contain representations of many successful paths to understanding Kepler's law.\n\nGiven such a database, it is well within the range of current technology to write a program that acts as a tutor by selecting and presenting the appropriate explanations from the database. The automated tutor would not need to create the explanations themselves—human teachers would create the explanations in the knowledge web, and the paths that connect them. The program would merely find the appropriate paths between what a student already knows and what he or she needs to learn. Along the way, the automatic tutor would quiz the student and respond to questions, much as a human tutor does. In the process, it would improve both its model of the student and the information in the database about the success of the explanations.\n\nFor example, imagine yourself in the position of an engineer who is designing a critical component and wants to learn something about fault-tolerant design. This is a fairly specialized topic, and most engineers are not familiar with it; a standard engineering education treats the topic superficially, if at all. Fault-tolerant design is an area normally left to specialists. Unless you happen to have taken a specialized course, you are faced with a few unsatisfactory alternatives. You can call in a specialist as a consultant, but if you don't know much about the field it's difficult to know what kind of specialist you need, or if the time and expense are worth the trouble. You could try reading a textbook on fault-tolerant design, but such a text would probably assume a knowledge you may have forgotten or may never have known. Besides, a textbook is likely to be out of date, so you will also have to find the relevant journals to read about recent developments. If you find them, they will almost certainly be written for specialists and will be difficult for you to read and understand. Given these unsatisfactory choices, you will probably just give up. You will go ahead and design the module without benefit of the proper knowledge, and hope for the best.\n\nLearning with Aristotle\n\nNow let's assume that you have access to the automatic tutor. Let's call it Aristotle.\n\nAristotle would begin by asking you how much time you're willing to devote to this project and the level of detail you want. Then Aristotle would show you a map of what you need to learn. The tutor program does this by comparing what you know to what needs to be known to design fault-tolerant modules. It knows what needs to be known because this is a common problem faced by many engineers, and knowledgeable teachers have identified the key concepts many times. Aristotle knows what you know because it has worked with you for a long time. There may be some things you're familiar with that Aristotle doesn't know you know, but you can point these things out to Aristotle when it shows you the learning plan. Aristotle might take your word for what you know, but it is more likely to quiz you about some of the key concepts, just to make sure.\n\nAristotle plans its lessons by finding chains of explanations that connect the concepts you need to learn to what you already know. It chooses the explanatory paths that match your favorite style of learning, including enough side paths, interesting examples, and related curiosities to match your level of interest. Whenever possible, Aristotle follows the paths laid down by great teachers in the knowledge web. Aristotle probably also has a model of how you want to be paced: when you have learned enough for one day, when it needs to throw in an interesting side story, etc. Along the way, Aristotle will not only explain things to you but will also ask you questions—both to make you think and to verify for itself that concepts are being learned successfully. When an explanation doesn't work, Aristotle tries another approach, and of course you can always ask questions, request examples, and give Aristotle explicit feedback on how it's doing. Aristotle then uses all these forms of feedback to adjust the lesson, and in the process it learns more about you.\n\nThe process of teaching helps Aristotle learn to be a better teacher. If an explanation doesn't work, and consistently raises a particular type of question, then Aristotle records this information in the knowledge web, where it can be used in planning the paths of other students. The feedback eventually makes its way back to the knowledge web's human authors, so that they can use it to improve their explanations.\n\nLike any good tutor, Aristotle allows you to get sidetracked from a lesson plan and follow your interests. If you find a particular example compelling, you may want to know more about it. If some concept you have just learned allows you to appreciate an elegant explanation of some fact you already know, Aristotle may point it out. If you are close to understanding something of critical importance or something that would be of particular interest to you, Aristotle may decide to show it to you even though it is not strictly necessary as part of the lesson. Of course, as Aristotle gets to know you, it will know how much you like this sort of distraction.\n\nOnce you have learned the material and Aristotle has verified that you have learned it, the program will update its database to indicate that you have recently learned it. As you learn more and more, it will continue to connect your recently acquired knowledge to the new concepts you are learning, until you have fully integrated them. Because Aristotle knows which subjects you are and have been interested in, it can consolidate your learning by finding connections that tie these subjects together.\n\nFor example, there's a short film of Dr. Richard Feynman explaining a principle of quantum mechanics called Bell's inequality. Most people have little interest in quantum mechanics and no interest at all in understanding Bell's inequality. Most quantum physicists already understand Bell's inequality and would learn little from Feynman's explanation. On the other hand, if you are a student who is just learning quantum mechanics, who has just mastered the necessary prerequisites, Feynman's explanation can be exciting, startling, and enlightening. It not only can explain something new but can also help you make sense of what you have recently learned. The trick is showing the film clip at just the right time. Aristotle can do that.\n\nI used an engineering example to describe Aristotle because most engineering knowledge is a straightforward, factual type of knowledge. Similar techniques would work for learning other subjects—history, mathematics, or the kind of technical information that might normally be conveyed in a training course or a technical manual. Of course, there are types of useful knowledge that a program like Aristotle would not be suited to: Aristotle would not be of much use in learning how to ride a bicycle or tell a joke. It would not replace hands-on experience, nor would it replace the enthusiasm and wisdom of a great teacher. What Aristotle would do is help you gain mastery of factual knowledge—exactly the kind of knowledge that is overwhelming us.\n\nHow the Knowledge Web Changes Education\n\nIn his book Diamond Age, the science fiction writer Neil Stephenson describes an automatic tutor called The Primer that grows up with a child. Stephenson's Primer does everything described above and more. It becomes a friend and playmate to the heroine of the novel, and guides not only her intellectual but also her emotional development. Such a Primer is beyond the capabilities of current technology, but even a program as limited as Aristotle would be a step in that direction. Teachers and students both understand that a school is no longer able to \"pre-load\" its students with the knowledge that they will need for life. Instead, a good school teaches the basics—reading, arithmetic, social skills—and introduces students to subjects that they can learn more about. It gives them an overview of knowledge as a starting point for further learning. A good school education also gives students the skills to acquire knowledge as they need it.\n\nTeachers know that individual attention helps a child learn and they would like to give their students more of it. Even a young child has special interests, special topics that he or she would like to know more about. A good teacher learns to recognize these individual interests and tries to nurture them, but this takes a lot of time. A program like Aristotle will give teachers a tool to help children follow their passions. It will also enable teachers to evaluate a child's progress and to provide individualized instruction in areas in which the child has gaps. A computer program like Aristotle cannot replace most of what goes on in school, but it can complement what goes on there. It can free teachers from the routine job of broadcasting information and give them more time for individual attention to their students.\n\nA system like Aristotle also enables teachers by giving them a way to publish. Any good teacher knows how to teach certain topics especially well, but there are few easy ways for them to share that information effectively with others. A teacher can write a textbook, or develop a curriculum, but each of those efforts is a major undertaking. There is no simple way for a teacher to publish an isolated idea about how to explain something. If a system like Aristotle existed, then with the proper authoring tools a teacher could publish a single explanation—an effort comparable to creating a Web page. In fact, existing Web pages are a good source of initial content for the knowledge web. As Marshall McLuhan said, \"The content of the new medium is the old medium.\" The initial content of the knowledge web will be the old curriculum materials, textbooks, and explanatory pages that are already on the World Wide Web. The existing materials already contain most of the examples, problems, illustrations, and lesson plans that knowledge web will need.\n\nAs students gain access to the best explanations from the best teachers on a given subject, their own teachers will be able to take on the role of coaches and mentors. Freed from the burden of presenting the same information over and over, the teachers will be able to give greater individual attention to their students.\n\nA Better Infrastructure for Publishing\n\nThe shared knowledge web will be a collaborative creation in much the same sense as the World Wide Web, but it can include the mechanisms for credit assignment, usage tracking, and annotation that the Web lacks. For instance, the knowledge web will be able to give teachers and authors recognition or even compensation for the use of their materials. Teachers and learners will be able to add annotation and links to explanation—connecting them to other content, suggesting improvements, or rating their accuracy, usefulness, and appropriateness for children of various ages. For instance, with such a system, it would be possible for the learner to accept only knowledge that had been certified as correct by an authority such as Encyclopedia Britannica or the National Academy of Sciences.\n\nAll of this raises the possibility of a different kind of economic underpinning for the knowledge web, one that is not possible on the document Web of today. The support infrastructure for payments would allow different parts of the knowledge web to operate in different ways. For instance, public funding might pay for the creation of curriculum materials for elementary school teachers and students, but specialized technical training could be offered on a fee or subscription basis. Companies could pay for encoding the knowledge necessary to train their employees and customers, consultants would be able to publish explanations as advertising for their services, and enthusiasts would offer their wisdom for free. Students could subscribe not only to particular areas of knowledge but to particular types of annotations, such as commentary or seals of approval. Schools and universities could charge for interaction with teachers and certification of the student's knowledge. The system could also become the ultimate hiring tool, since employers could map areas of knowledge that they need in prospective employees.\n\nWhat Makes the Knowledge Web Different?\n\nOne way to think about the knowledge web is to compare it with other publishing systems that support teaching and learning. These include the World Wide Web, Internet news groups, traditional textbooks, and refereed journals. The knowledge web takes important ideas from these systems. These ideas include peer-to-peer publishing, vetting and peer review, linking and annotation, mechanisms for paying authors, and guided learning. Each of these existing media demonstrates the success of one or more of these ideas. They are all incorporated into the knowledge web.\n\nPeer-to-Peer Teaching\n\nOne of the reasons why Internet news groups and the World Wide Web have enjoyed such runaway success is that they allow people to communicate with each other directly, without publishers as intermediaries. The great advantage of such a peer-to-peer publishing system is that anyone with something interesting to say has an easy way to say it. The Internet has eliminated the publishing bottleneck and has created a flood of authorship. This basic human desire to share knowledge is what will drive the creation of the knowledge web. The task of recording the world's knowledge is so overwhelming that only peer-to-peer publishing can plausibly accomplish it. Yet the knowledge web is not only a record of knowledge but also a way of imparting it. The knowledge web will do for teaching what the World Wide Web did for publication. Peer-to-peer teaching will allow literally millions of people to help each other learn.\n\nVetting and Peer Review\n\nOne of the downsides of peer-to-peer publishing is quality control. Publishers of textbooks and journals do more than market and distribute; they also edit and select. In the case of peer-reviewed journals, some of the burden of quality control is shifted to the reviewers, but it is still coordinated by the publisher. On the World Wide Web, there is no commonly accepted system of rating and peer review, nor is there a mechanism to support one. The result is chaos. The information you find by searching on the World Wide Web is often irrelevant, badly presented, or just plain wrong. It is difficult to screen out obscene material and propaganda. It is almost impossible to sort the wheat from the chaff.\n\nThe knowledge web addresses this problem by supporting an infrastructure for peer review and third-party certification. It supports mechanisms for the labeling, rating, and categorization of material, both by the author and by third parties. The browsing tools will allow information to be filtered, sorted, and labeled according to these annotations. In addition, user feedback tools will be built into the browsing software to help identify material that is particularly good, bad, or controversial.\n\nLinking and Annotation\n\nAnyone who has used the World Wide Web understands the importance of linking. In principle, articles in conventional journals also support a kind of linking, in the form of footnotes and references, but these kinds of links are far less convenient to use than the convenient \"click throughs\" of hypertext. Even the simple message-thread linking of threaded news groups helps make the information more usable. Students accustomed to hypertext find the linear arrangement of textbooks and articles confining and inconvenient. In this respect, the Web is clearly better. The knowledge web will allow an even more generalized form of linking than the World Wide Web. In the knowledge web, not only the author but also third parties can create links, comments, and annotations.\n\nWays to Pay Authors\n\nAn advantage of textbooks and journals over the World Wide Web is that they support a mechanism for paying the author. The World Wide Web has demonstrated that many authors are willing to publish information without payment, but it does not give them any convenient option to do otherwise. The knowledge web will provide that option by supporting various payment mechanisms, including subscription, pay per play, fee for certification, and usage-based royalties. It will also support and encourage the production of free content.\n\nMuch of the content on the knowledge web will probably be free, but there are a number of other economic models that can coexist with this. One of the most obvious is the paid course, in which a student pays tuition for a cluster of services, including access to teachers, curriculum materials, and interaction with other students, and some form of certification at the end. With the knowledge web, many institutions may choose to offer the curriculum material for free—as a form of advertising—and charge for the other services, especially the certification. The knowledge web would also help solve one of the online course providers' greatest problems, which is marketing. The knowledge web would help direct students to the courses that meet their need.\n\nAnother model that may work well is a micropayment system, in which a student pays a fixed subscription fee for access to a wide range of information. Usage statistics would serve as a means to allocate the income among the various authors. This system has the advantage of rewarding authors for usefulness without penalizing students for use. The students' fees would be independent of the amount of use they make of the system. The ASCAP music royalty system and university payments for student access to Encyclopedia Britannica are examples of how such a system might work.\n\nGuided Learning\n\nPart of the information in a textbook is about the subject matter, but part of it is also about how to learn the subject matter. A good textbook is full of information on the plan of attack, strategies for learning, practice problems, and suggestions for further study. Part of what makes up a good curriculum is not just the material but the plan for moving through it. A textbook often has an accompanying \"teacher guide\" that contains more of this type of information. For example, the guide may note that if the student makes a certain type of error, the student is probably missing a particular point and needs it to be re-explained. Some of the best computer-aided instructional material also encodes such information. The knowledge web provides an easy mechanism for a teacher to include this type of information.\n\nTable of Affordances\n\nThe Web News\n\nGroups Text\n\nBooks Journals Peer-to-Peer publishing Yes Yes No Limited Supports linking Yes Limited No Limited Ability to add annotations No Yes No No Vetting and certification No Limited Yes Yes Supports payment model No No Yes Yes Supports guided learning Limited No Yes No\n\nAchieving Critical Mass\n\nOnce the knowledge web achieves critical mass, it is easy to see how it can sustain itself. The real question is how it gets started. Presumably, first users will be adults, and the first adopters will be industry and government. Industry spends $60 billion a year on training for employees. It spends even more on customer support, product liability, poor design, and other costs that could be mitigated by better training. This is the first market for the knowledge web. The second market is probably the military, which is the single largest educator of adults. The third market is continuing education for individuals.\n\nAdults are an easier initial market than children for several reasons. Adults are usually learning because they want to or because they need to. They are already motivated to learn. Adults often need specific knowledge for a specific reason. A recent survey of the American workplace showed that 80 percent of workers feel that additional education is important for them to be successful at their job. Adults are much more likely to treat time as a limited resource. They want to learn efficiently. Also, the mechanisms that pay for adult education are often more rational and less politically charged than the mechanisms that pay for the education of children. For-profit companies are likely to adapt quickly to a more efficient process.\n\nEventually traditional educational institutions will use this new system of learning. It will be used first by colleges and trade schools; then it will make its way into secondary and elementary education. It is important to emphasize that computers will not replace the teachers; rather, they will give teachers a new tool. Instead of spending most of their time broadcasting information to a group, teachers will have more time to help students integrate their knowledge through discussion and through individualized interaction.\n\nThere are three technical components necessary for such a system to work: the tutor (browser), the authoring tool, and the knowledge web itself. This last component is the most difficult to create, but fortunately it does not have to be built all at once. Even a small part of it would be useful. Presumably the knowledge web will get its start in a few narrow areas, probably determined by available funding. For instance, it is easy to imagine a scenario in which a part of the knowledge web is initially funded by a supplier to explain the use of its products. Imagine, for example, that Cisco publishes the knowledge of how to configure and maintain its routers in this form. Another scenario is that the government sponsors the creation of the system for a specific application, such as continuing education for schoolteachers or job training for factory workers. A company might pay for the development of training programs for its workers and customers. A foundation might sponsor an initial effort as a way to have an impact on education.\n\nSummary: An Idea Whose Time Has Come\n\nIt seems almost inevitable that such a system will eventually be developed, but why is now the time to undertake such a project? After all, people have been dreaming of such a project for half a century, yet Memex, Xanadu, Plato, Wais, and numerous other schemes failed to achieve critical mass. Why should this one succeed? For one thing, the infrastructure is now ready for it. The knowledge web requires widespread access to network-connected computers capable of handling graphics, audio, and video. This did not exist until recently. But it is not just the technology that is ready for this idea—people are ready for it. Email, the Web, and video games have all whetted their appetites. The younger generation is more than ready. They expect something better than listening to lessons in class-sized groups.\n\nAt the same time that a solution is becoming possible, the problem is reaching a crisis point: the amount of knowledge is becoming overwhelming, and the need for it is increasing. There is a widespread conviction that something radical needs to be done about education—both the education of children and the continuing education of adults. The world is becoming so complicated that schools are no longer able to teach students what they need to know, but industry is not equipped to deal with the problem either. Something needs to change.\n\nWith the knowledge web, humanity's accumulated store of information will become more accessible, more manageable, and more useful. Anyone who wants to learn will be able to find the best and the most meaningful explanations of what they want to know. Anyone with something to teach will have a way to reach those who what to learn. Teachers will move beyond their present role as dispensers of information and become guides, mentors, facilitators, and authors. The knowledge web will make us all smarter. The knowledge web is an idea whose time has come.\n\nI am always ready to learn, but I do not always like being taught.\n\n— Sir Winston Churchill\n\nFirst let me say that I am glad Danny Hillis is getting interested in education. We will never be able to change education unless the best and brightest care to start thinking about what is wrong and what can be done. The knowledge web idea is a reasonable started but Hillis misses some key points about what is needed. When we begin to consider how computers can help in education we need to what is wrong with traditional school settings. Is school broken because students lack access to knowledge or to personal tutor? It could be improved by the construction of a dynamic knowledge base to be sure, but why would that be the key issue?\n\nThe only thing that interferes with my learning is my education.\n\n— Albert Einstein\n\nI have never let my schooling interfere with my education.\n\n— Mark Twain\n\nEducation is an admirable thing, but it is well to remember from time to time that nothing worth knowing can be taught.\n\n— Oscar Wilde\n\nAt least six things need to be changed in order to create school settings that work for those who have difficulties in traditional school settings.\n\n1. The role of the teacher\n\n2. The contextualization of what is learned\n\n3. The relevance of what is learned to children's goals\n\n4. The emphasis on success vs. failure\n\n5. The measurement criteria\n\n6. The fun\n\nTeachers would be great to have around if they were there only when you needed them. In this, Hillis is right. It is clear why traditional school settings do not operate in this fashion. One cannot expect a classroom of thirty children to each be doing their own thing, asking for the teacher's help as needed. Of course, some schools actually try to do this kind of thing, Montessori Schools for example. But, even those schools give up on this model of education when faced with curricula that must be taught and tests that must be passed. It is the curriculum and the size of the class that binds the teacher, making him or her a provider of information and judge of right answers rather than someone who is there for help as needed. Hillis' tutor is great for the adult student who really cares about physics, but most children are not trying to understand physics, they are trying to understand why someone is making them take physics.\n\nIt must be remembered that the purpose of education is not to fill the minds of students with facts... it is to teach them to think, if that is possible, and always to think for themselves.\n\n— Robert Hutchins\n\nPeople who talk about education have forever been mouthing aphorisms about teaching students to think for themselves. It is the Holy Grail of teaching. Everyone believes it, but very few do much about it. Robert Hutchins transformed the University of Chicago. But he didn't eliminate grades and therefore he didn't eliminate the teacher as an authority figure whose views must be followed. Hillis' tutor would do that and therefore it might actually be consulted by students. But most students are trying to figure out how to please the teacher and get a good grade. They are not like Hillis who is more motivated by truth than by grades one would assume. As long as the teacher makes a judgment about the student, many students will try to please him. It is simple human nature. Then, original thinking goes out the window. For students who feel they cannot or do not want to please the teacher, school becomes tedious and learning becomes quite difficult.\n\nThe authority of those who teach is often an obstacle to those who want to learn.\n\n— Cicero\n\nA teacher who is attempting to teach without inspiring the pupil with a desire to learn is hammering on a cold iron.\n\n— Horace Mann\n\nNo matter how good a teacher is, they are still guided by the curriculum in which they are teaching. We must get over the idea that students who fail to learn algebra or chemistry or English literature would do so if only they had a really good tutor. We need to understand that there are other things to learn besides these subjects, and that a student who turns off to the traditional curriculum, designed in 1892 for a while different set of students and circumstances, can still lead a happy and productive life if only we would consider giving him or her a more meaningful and relevant educational experience.\n\nSchools are armored against change. But, in the last few years, a chink has appeared in that armor. It may be possible to exploit it. That chink is the internet. But it is not the knowledge contained on the internet that is the real hope here. The problem is not getting the net to contain better knowledge but getting the net to be the source for education not the supplement for education.\n\nCourses have been with us for so long that we simply accept that they have the structure, length, and characteristics that they should have and leave it at that. Web courses can be different than what is there now. They can be different for three reasons. (1) Current courses aren't very good and the new medium exposes their weak underbelly. Listening to a lecture on line is a disaster. (2) The length, material covered, and general methodology in courses was derived from practical considerations that are irrelevant in this new medium. Faculty only can teach so many hours per week. Rooms can only accommodate so many people. Buildings open and close at certain times. None of this matters on line. (3) Its on a computer. This new medium has to change the very nature of how things are presented because it can. Just like movies ceased to be filmed plays quickly enough, on line courses will cease to be on line copies of what was there before.\n\nWhat should a web course be? For starters the concept of course is all wrong. A course is of arbitrary duration. Horses run courses set up at pre-established standardized distances at various racetracks. Students are not horses. Students need to accomplish tasks and having accomplished them they should move on to the next task. Students are not horses. They needn't run through courses. They need to practice whatever skills they are being taught in a realistic environment. Such an environment is the kind of \"course\" that should be on the internet.\n\nTo put education on line, one needs to think about the experiences that students need to prepare for. Here is where Hillis' idea can be very valuable. As we design new experiences for kids we will need on line tutors who can help guide students through those experiences. Some of these tutors can be pre-packaged and automated. The best and brightest of our teachers can be used as a source for creating such tutors. The best expertise in the world can be captured and made available to a program that is smart enough to figure out who needs what story or suggestion at what time and get it to him. If that is what Hillis means by the knowledge web, I am all for it. It is an idea whose time has come. But it will only be of value if it fits within a new conception of what needs to be taught and who certifies who has learned what. Within the current school system it would be of little value.\n\nNew on line curricula need to be built that can utilize existing teachers and existing materials and new materials created for the knowledge web that support new kinds of experiences that students will be living. To put this another way, we can build learn-by-doing curricula by making teachers into Socratic tutors and creating realistic tasks for students to do. Those tasks should come from the real-life situations that they might be called upon to do. In this context the knowledge web would be invaluable as a means of creating an educational system that is relevant to the students within it.\n\nWhen books were moved to classrooms, they were not simply read to the assembled students. (Actually they were at the beginning, hence the word lecture.) New teaching methodologies evolved that were more appropriate to classrooms and books became supplemental materials for teachers. Different media require different methods.\n\nOn line education needs to mean the creation of a complex learning environment where there are mentors available and realistic roles to learn. We need to create such environments as a significant part of the knowledge web.\n\nIf computer folk are about to be flattered yet again with a rush of fresh cash (I'm thinking of that Google IPO, and the implied revitalization of Silicon Valley), even as the world at large might be falling apart, the least we can do is try to solve some of the long standing problems we were supposed to be doing something about all along. Education and the healthcare system come to mind immediately.\n\nSo, yes. Let's raise our army and do education right.\n\nAs Danny points out, there's a long history of utopian projects that aim to enhance learning through digital connectivity and good user interfaces. To his list I'd add a couple more of my favorite examples, Alan Kay's Squeak and Andy Van Dam's Exploratories. All the projects mentioned so far share the trait that they were built primarily by experts in order to be consumed by learners, but there have also been a variety of successful kid-driven networked learning technology experiments. My two favorites of these are Thinkquest and Whyville.\n\nOne point of potential confusion ought to be addressed: Moore's Law has the unfortunate side effect of allowing so many virtual objects, or worse, proposed virtual objects, to come into existence that it is impossible to find enough names for all of them. In the case of \"Knowledge Web\", there are already a few namesakes. There's James (\"Connections\") Burke's Knowledge Web, which proposes to organize knowledge historically using loops of human-to-human relationships, and will have a spiffy VR-ish user interface. There's also a Knowledge Web that's associated with the Semantic Web research community, which is led by Tim Berners-Lee.\n\nDanny asks two big questions:\n\n1) What technology strategy should we advocate? 2) What human strategy will not get bogged down in stupid politics?\n\nHere's my take:\n\n1) On technology\n\nWhy is Danny still carrying the burden of AI? What is gained by designing learning tools around a supposed artificial tutor? Certainly it's clear that we don't understand how a mind learns as yet. Yes, we're understanding more all the time about scattered details of the learning process, but I'm sure even the most hardcore of AIers would agree that many of our basic assumptions about learning are vulnerable to overhaul as we discover more about the brain and development in the coming decades. The only reason it's even possible to consider designing an artificial tutor is that it would be hard to isolate the effects of such a construction, so it would be hard to know if it really worked. We can't even make a robot car that can drive itself, so what makes it ok to assume that we can make a robot that can \"model\" a child's brain?\n\nThe AI debates are old. Whether or not the ultimate project of AI makes any sense (and I believe it does not), can we at least agree that a program to model what humans know or how humans learn is not something we can plan on in the near future?\n\nWhile AI-ers like the idea of adding animated paper clips and \"Wizards\" to user interfaces as part of a march to a holy inauguration of a new life form, what happens in practice is that AI interfaces in training and education become the tools of the worst, dullest bureaucrats who seek to use automation to avoid liability and lower labor costs. Computers in the field are inevitably used to obscure feedback that could improve a process unless the user interface is designed so that it's clear that specific humans are responsible for what happens.\n\nAbsolutely every function that can be provided by an AI interface can be provided by an honest interface better. Let's make a \"Google\" instead of an \"Ask Jeeves.\" Let's make something with a user interface that's honest about what it can do and leave fantasies of future AI to the movie makers.\n\nThe viability of an artificial tutor is not the only technology strategy question to be examined. A more subtle question is the degree to which knowledge can be represented by software at this time, in the future, or ever. If the tutor is like a verb, or an actor, knowledge representation is like the corresponding noun. Somehow \"content\" has to be found and presented in the proper context. Once the concern of theoreticians, automated content interpretation is no longer an academic question. Huge sums are spent, for instance, on attempts to improve software that can automatically classify internet content.\n\nThree non-glamorous examples are spam catching, obscenity blocking, and terrorist interception. The results of the first two have become part of our common experience, and the results are better than useless but short of inspirational. (Does education need to rise to the level of the inspirational to succeed?) My own web pages are blocked in most public school libraries, much to my dismay. Spam-catching filters are worth using, but in my experience are not yet good enough. Whenever I've thought they were working, it turned out I was actually missing out on messages I would have liked to have received. Automation always seems to work best when it is allowed to obscure its own results.\n\nThe current crop of academic projects to add an ontology layer to the internet usually rely on the distributed volunteer efforts of large numbers of humans. Such approaches generally start with an ontology a little like the Dewey Decimal System, but different in that on the net a card catalog's categories can be more easily extended, and one can choose unlimited, or even fuzzy, partial categories for a given entry. There are also projects that hope to generate implicit ontologies by extending what Google and other search engines have done with specific words to loose collections of adjacent words. A less rigid model of association might generate a more useful ontology.\n\nA fair summary is to say that the whole business of generating context and ontology is still experimental, especially at large scales. Since money is flowing into the search business, there are a lot of people looking at these problems, and I hope the happy side effect of another Silicon Valley wealth convulsion will be accelerated progress.\n\nSo, while I'm deeply skeptical of an artificial tutor, I'm somewhat hopeful about improved knowledge representation. What kind of technology strategy should follow from those conclusions? Since I'm skeptical about the prospects for automation, my guess is that the answer can be found by thinking about people and politics, which brings us to the second big question.\n\n2) On humans\n\nEducation in America is a mass of deadwood and sludge studded with gems. It's not too hard to find a magical school with devoted teachers to try out new educational technologies and generate promising results. These aren't necessarily the rich schools, either. It seems impossible, however, to preserve any of the best elements of educational technology in large scale deployment. The typical school computer is an aging business-oriented machine running useless software. It can't compete with the video game boxes kids love.\n\nWhy? Part of the problem is entrenched political and financial interests. In the state of California, for instance, textbook publishers convinced the legislature to keep non-book curriculum materials out of the requirements, so that they must be conceived as a luxury. If you want to cure a case of excessive cheer, go take a look at some of the current textbooks and see how much they cost. I saw one recently in New York, a big, expensive elementary school math textbook filled with color pictures of diverse people who \"love math\", but displaying no love of math itself. It was also filled with errors. Look at how cheap video game boxes are and how expensive crummy required textbooks are. While medicine and defense are the first choices for those who think of the government as the worlds stupidest but most reliable customer, education comes in as a close third.\n\nThere are two plans of attack, bottom-up and top-down. I don't want to dismiss top-down at all. We elite technical people know a lot of elite business and political people and maybe it's possible to start something grand. My sense is that this is what Danny hopes for, and I would do anything to help that effort, even if it included a non-catastrophic level of AI confusion.\n\nThere have been a few bottom-up attempts, and I'd like to tell the story of one of them because it's instructive. Thinkquest was a project conceived by Al Weis, who used to run the supercomputer business for IBM and then built much of the core of the Internet's hardware infrastructure as it existed in the 1980s and early 1990s. The idea was to run a contest in which high school age kids from all over the world would compete to build the best curriculum entries in web format. The prizes were scholarships, along with cash awards to the winning kids' teachers and schools. There were many thousands of entries, and the winners were spectacularly good. In one case, a major corporation chose a Thinkquest entry as a central training tool to teach programming. Super high quality content was created in all subjects, in many languages. Results were judged by a net-enabled community of educators from around the world managed by the Internet Society. Special credit was given to development teams who collaborated across language barriers and time zones. A grand prize winning entry one year was created by kids from Japan, South Africa (a Zulu kid), and Poland. They used barely adequate language translation software to coordinate their efforts, but they managed. The library of entries was one of the most sought after destinations on the net during the late 1990s, even though it was not publicized. It had great international buzz in the worldwide net kid underground.\n\nSo, the paradigm was to get the brightest kids to write the curriculum for the rest. Communication skills were taught along with the official topics. The contest was very cost effective since there weren't that many prizes, but there were lots of wonderful entries. Even kids who didn't win benefited hugely in gaining skills, visibility, and contacts.\n\nThe problem with the Thinkquest model wasn't the cost of the prizes, but the cost of the judging and maintenance. It became harder to manage the vast amount of content and huge number of human relationships. Hard to prevent abuse, fraud, hate speech. Hard to assure fairness. The project was transferred to a larger foundation with greater resources that had a strict policy of maintaining a firewall on all its servers. Thus, while the Thinkquest library was still readable, the authors could no longer update it. (All authors were previously expected to keep their entries current, because untended digital information rapidly loses relevance and value. No one likes stale web content.) The first experiment in global curriculum, and in mass collaboration for student-created curriculum, slowly lost it's vitality and turned into a mere contest.\n\nWhat Thinkquest demonstrated was an almost successful model for distributing the overhead of content creation and classification to a huge number of people instead of artificial agents. It was close enough to being a success that it's worth trying to see if the design can be tweaked to completion. I wonder if it would be possible to reach an agreement within the technical community on something like Thinkquest as a foundation layer, with the possibility of automated content interpretation and creation being an option for the future. Automation is so easy to have illusions about when it comes to something like education, where it's hard to measure efficacy.\n\nIn this regard I'm a skeptic that the new wave of testing in American education is doing what it claims."
