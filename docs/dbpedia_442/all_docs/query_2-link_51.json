Unlike most other contributors here, I knew Claude primarily through his work in juggling. A PERSONAL TRIBUTE TO CLAUDE SHANNON Note: excerpts of this tribute appeared in the May/June 2001 issue of 'Juggle' magazine. Reprinted by permission. By Professor Arthur Lewbel March, 2001. Claude Elwood Shannon 1916-2001. Survived by his wife Mary Elizabeth (Betty) Shannon, a son, Andrew Shannon, and a daughter, Margarita \"Peggy\" Shannon. Many Jugglers have heard about the juggling robot invented by Claude Shannon, and jugglers of a mathematical bent will know of Shannon's juggling theorem. However, among mathematicians and computer scientists, Claude Shannon is a legend, widely recognized as one of the most brilliant men of the twentieth century. It is impossible to overstate his importance in the early development of computers and digital communication. In 1990, Scientific American called his paper on information theory, \"The Magna Carta of the Information Age.\" In the 1980's Claude quietly showed up at a computer science lecture (after having been away from the field for many years). One attendee said, \"It was as if Isaac Newton had showed up at a physics conference.\" When people realized who he was they pushed him on stage. He gave a very short speech, then juggled a bit. Afterwards, attendees lined up to get his autograph. Any encyclopedia will give you a short biography of Claude's life, and thousands of books, articles, and webpages exist describing his work in math and computer science. I will therefore skip most of that, and instead provide my own recollections and impressions of an extraordinary man. I first met Claude at the MIT Juggling club. One nice thing about juggling at MIT is that you never know who will show up. For example, one day Doc Edgerton, inventor of the strobe light, stopped by the juggling club and asked if he could photograph some of us juggling under strobe lights. So it wasn't a great surprise when a cheerful, gray haired professor stopped by the club one afternoon and said to me, \"Can I measure your juggling?\" That was my introduction to Claude Shannon. Not long after, the MIT juggling club decided to have a video and pizza night, and needed someone with a big TV, in a room large enough to hold dozens of jugglers. We all ended up in Claude's living room, in a stately home (originally owed by Thomas Jefferson's great granddaughter) overlooking a lake in Winchester, Massachusetts. Another time he invited me to dinner at his house, saying only that, \"he had another juggler coming over as well.\" The other guest turned out to be Albert Lucas. Unlike most brilliant theoretical mathematicians, Claude was also wonderfully adept with tools and machines, and frequently built little gadgets and inventions, usually with the goal of being whimsical rather than practical. \"I've always pursued my interests without much regard to financial value or value to the world. I've spent lots of time on totally useless things,\" Shannon said in 1983. These useless things would include his juggling robot, a mechanical mouse that could navigate a maze, and a computing machine that did all its calculations in roman numerals. Claude never did care about money. He never even put his paycheck into a bank account that paid interest, until he married and his wife Betty suggested it to him. Still, he became a very wealthy man, partly as a result of early investments with some of his computer scientist pals, including the founders of Teledyne and of Hewlett Packard. When he did think about finance, Claude was as brilliant at that as with anything else he set his mind to. Knowing I was an economist, he once explained to me his thoughts on investing. Some were wonderfully practical, as when he said he'd always buy stocks rather than gold, because companies grow and metals don't. Some were more esoteric, for example, he had ideas regarding mean-variance analysis that jibe well with many aspects of modern portfolio theory. Some of the juggling artifacts that Claude had in his large 'toy room:' A zoetrope made of a dozen little still figures of juggling clowns. Spin it, and they look like one clown juggling. A sculpture of a juggler, juggling 3 jugglers, each of whom is juggling three jugglers. His famous juggling robot, complete with the head of W. C. Fields stuck on top. A mechanical diorama that shows three clowns, juggling many balls rings and clubs. The props move so realistically that the clubs even rotate and land correctly (triple spins, if I remember right). In the basement was an air hockey table, mounted at an angle, for two dimensional, low gravity juggling. And in the garage, a collection of exotic unicycles. In addition to his famous juggling theorem, Claude came close to inventing site swaps. In the 1970's, he was asked by Scientific American magazine to write an article about juggling. In addition to including his juggling theorem, the draft of his article contained an attempt to count the number of different possible juggling patterns. Scientific American asked him to revise the article, but by then he was doing other things and never bothered to finish it. (A copy of his draft article can be found in the book, \"Claude Elwood Shannon Collected Papers,\" edited by N.J.A. Sloane and A. D. Wyner, New York, IEEE Press, 1993, pages 850-864). He made an offhand remark that maybe I should write an article for them instead. Years later, I took his advice (see, \"The Science of Juggling, Scientific American, Nov. 1995). Claude told me this story. He may have been kidding, but it illustrates both his sense of humor and his delightfully self deprecating nature, and it certainly could be true. The story is that Claude was in the middle of giving a lecture to mathematicians in Princeton, when the door in the back of the room opens, and in walks Albert Einstein. Einstein stands listening for a few minutes, whispers something in the ear of someone in the back of the room, and leaves. At the end of the lecture, Claude hurries to the back of the room to find the person that Einstein had whispered too, to find out what the great man had to say about his work. The answer: Einstein had asked directions to the men?s room. Claude wrote the first paper describing how one might program a computer to play chess. He wrote, \"Communication Theory of Secrecy Systems, \" which the Boston Globe newspaper said \"transformed cryptography from an art to a science.\" Yet neither one of these were his greatest works. Here's my own interpretation of Claude's two most famous and important papers. His 1937 thesis basically said, \"if we could someday invent a computing machine, the way to make it think would be to use binary code, by stringing together switches and applying Boole's logic system to the result.\" This work, done while he was still a student at MIT, has been called the most important master's thesis of the twentieth century. The idea was immediately put to use in the design of telephone switching systems, and is indeed how all modern computers think. But that was only Claude's second most important idea. His most famous paper, written in 1948 at Bell Labs, created what is now known as information theory. In \"A Mathematical Theory of Communication,\" Shannon proposed the idea of converting any kind of data, (such as pictures, sounds, or text) to zeroes and ones, which could then be communicated without errors. Data are reduced to bits of information, and information transmission is then measured in terms of the amount of disorder or randomness the data contains (entropy). Optimal communication of data is achieved by removing all randomness and redundancy (now known as the Shannon limit). In short, Claude basically invented digital communication, as is now used by computers, CD's, and cell phones. In addition to communications, fields as diverse as computer science, neurobiology, code breaking, and genetics have all been revolutionized by the application of Shannon's information theory. Without Claude?s work, the internet as we know it could not have been created. Some of Claude?s honors include the National Medal of Science, Japan's Kyoto Prize, the IEEE Medal of Honor, and about a dozen honorary degrees. In 1998, the two building AT&T labs complex in Florham Park, N.J., was named the Shannon Laboratory. One day, almost immediately after I'd arrived at his house, Claude said to me, \"Do you mind if hang you upside down by your legs?\" He had realized that while bounce juggling is much easier than toss juggling in terms of energy requirements, throwing upward as in toss juggling is physiologically easier, and so he wanted to try combining the two, which meant bounce juggling while hanging upside down. For every one invention he built or theorem he proved, he had a hundred other ideas that he just never got around to finishing. One juggling example: He showed me a vacuum cleaner strapped to a pole, pointing straight up, with the motor reversed to blow instead of suck. He turned it on, and placed a styrofoam ball in the wind current. It hovered about a foot above the vacuum. He then varied the speed of the motor, and the ball drifted up and down as the speed changed. \"Now,\" he said, \"Imagine three balls and two blowers, with the blowers angled a bit towards each other, and the motors timed to alternate speeds.\" The last time I saw Claude, Alzheimer's disease had gotten the upper hand. As sad as it is to see anyone's light slowly fade, it is an especially cruel fate to be suffered by a genius. He vaguely remembered I juggled, and cheerfully showed me the juggling displays in his toy room, as if for the first time. And, despite the loss of memory and reason, he was every bit as warm, friendly, and cheerful as the first time I met him. Billions of people may have benefited from his work, but I, and thousands of others who knew him a little bit, are eternally grateful to have known him as a person. \"Shannon's juggling theorem\" and \"Shannon's juggling robot\" below reprinted with permission from The Science of Juggling, By Peter J. Beek and Arthur Lewbel, Scientific American, November, 1995, Volume 273, Number 5, pages 92-97. Copyright � 1995 by Scientific American, Inc. All rights reserved. The entire Science of Juggling article (except for some copyrighted photos) may be found here: The Science of Juggling. Shannon's juggling robot. Shannon pioneered juggling robotics, constructing a bounce-juggling machine in the 1970s from an Erector set. In it, small steel balls are bounced off a tightly stretched drum, making a satisfying \"thunk\" with each hit. Bounce juggling is easier to accomplish than is toss juggling because the balls are grabbed at the top of their trajectories, when they are moving the slowest. In Shannon's machine, the arms are fixed relative to each other. The unit moves in a simple rocking motion, each side making a catch when it rocks down and a toss when it rocks up. Throwing errors are corrected by having short, grooved tracks in place of hands. Caught near the zenith of their flight, balls land in the track; the downswing of the arm rolls the ball to the back of the track, thus imparting suffcient energy to the ball for making a throw. Shannon's original construction handled three balls, although Christopher G. Atkeson and Stefan K. Schaal of the Georgia Institute of Technology have since constructed a five-ball machine along the same lines. Shannon's juggling therorem JUGGLING THEOREM proposed by Claude E. Shannon of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology is schematically represented for the three-ball cascade. The exact equation is (F+D)H=(V+D)N, where F is the time a ball spends in the air, D is the time a ball spends in a hand, V is the time a hand is vacant, N is the number of balls juggled, and H is the number of hands. The theorem is proved by following one complete cycle of the juggle from the point of view of the hand and of the ball and then equating the two.\n\nShannon once visited Russia. It was in 1960-ies. Shannon arrived for participation in the Annual Popov Society Conference. About twenty Russian engineers and scientists arrived to the Moscow airport to meet Shannon. We did not see Shannon before and were afraid not to recognize him in flow of incoming passengers. However, when Shannon appeared, it was impossible not to recognize him. Shannon radiated, as it seemed to us, a powerful inherent intellectual light. At the conference, Shannon presented the last results on the bounds to error probability for optimal coding in discrete memoryless channel. The talk was great and raised a long stream of questions and comments. One of the main Russian newspapers \"Literaturnaia Gazeta\" published an article about Shannon with short interview. When Shannon visited Moscow, he had a meeting with A. N. Kolmogorov in Moscow State University. I was present at that meeting. Shannon told Kolmogorov about some open Information Theory problems. That were the problems on multiuser channels and sources. The problems were new and very interesting. Shannon presented also his intuition on in which Information Theory terms he saw the solutions of these problems. (As we know now, some years after that meeting and independently, T. Cover published his famous paper on one of the multiuser problems. The outstanding results of D. Slepian, J. Wolf, and R. Ahlswede should be mentioned also in this context.) Kolmogorov expressed his extremely high appreciation of Shannon's work and pointed out the significance of the concepts of entropy and epsilon-entropy not only for the communications science. I had two long-lasting personal conversations with Shannon. The first of them was in Moscow. I accompanied him to the Publishing House Mir, which published the book of Shannon's papers in Russian. Shannon, his wife Mary (as she asked to call her at that time) , and me were on that trip to and from the Publishing House Mir for about one hour. It was interesting for me to learn the Shannon opinion on some unsolved Information Theory problems and some papers, which appeared at that time. My second conversation with Shannon was at MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology). Professors P. Elias and R. Gallager invited me in 1969 to work with them for three months at MIT. When I arrived at MIT, I saw an office door with the name \"Prof. Claude Shannon\". However soon I noticed that Shannon did not come to work at MIT. Professors R. S. Kennedy, H. L. Van Trees, and M. Hellmann told me that Shannon did not appear at MIT at least for a year. I asked to call Shannon and ask him whether he wants to meet me and talk. In spite of a priori skepticism on getting a positive reply such call was done. As a result, Shannon appointed a meeting with me in the MIT Faculty Club Restaurant on lunchtime. One of famous MIT professors suggested accompanying me to the Club. I replied that I could come to the Club without help. I asked that might be the professor had his own interest in accompanying. He answered yes and told me that he wanted to meet Shannon, lift with us in an elevator up to the top floor where the Club was located, and then leave us. During the time in the elevator, he said that he wanted to speak to Shannon about a new problem, which he (the professor) solved recently, and to ask for Shannon's opinion on the problem and the results. The professor said (R. Fano told me the same earlier) that usually, with rare exceptions, the Shannon opinion was that he (Shannon) knew the problem and knew its solution. As it was preplanned, our lifting in the elevator began with the professor talk about his new problem. Just before the stop at the top floor, the professor asked the Shannon opinion. At this time, Shannon said just the same that he was usually saying. During the lunch Shannon writing on the ordinary napkins explained his view on the application of Information Theory to the analysis and prediction of share prices and stock exchange indices. I was very impressed by this presentation. Shannon told me that in the US there was a possibility to get money by playing with shares, whereas in the USSR there was no such possibility. I should say that one month after this meeting with Shannon and after my lecture at IBM, I told B. B. Mandelbrot about Shannon's applications of the information concept and channel capacity to stock exchange processes. B. B. Mandelbrot did not agree with Shannon's approach and said that the stock exchange processes had to be modeled with the help of self-similar processes. Frankly speaking, I do not know up to now which approach is more productive in practice. Also, I remember my brief conversations with Shannon, one on a party given by P. Elias in 1969 and another one on the Information Theory Symposium in June 1985. I am very lucky to be influenced by Shannon who, in my opinion, was a real genius of science."
