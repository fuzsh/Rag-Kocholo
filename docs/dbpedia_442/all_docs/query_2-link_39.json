        "text": "From Bits to Qubits:\n\nA Celebration of Claude Shannon, Father of the Information Age\n\nPhoto Credit: MIT Museum\n\nWidely known as the “father of the information age,” mathematician and computer scientist Claude Shannon conceived of and laid the foundations for the digital communications networks that weave across the Earth today.\n\nNo scientist has a higher impact-to-fame ratio than Claude Shannon, who continues to inspire research not only in computer science but also in neuroscience, physics and other fields. Despite his vast contributions, he remains relatively unknown.\n\nSponsored by Stevens Institute of Technology and the IEEE History Center, this event will feature a historical perspective of Claude Shannon by Stevens’ President Nariman Farvardin and a panel discussion with Stevens faculty that will examine Claude Shannon's legacy and influence on today’s powerful technologies.\n\nFor a full description of the program and speakers, please visit www.stevens.edu/shannon"
