With luck, the snowy days are behind us at last and we can look forward to warmer days and the greening of our beautiful campus. I would like to thank everyone in the campus community who took the time to complete a Strategic Plan Survey. The Strategic Plan Steering Committee is now hard at work sifting through your responses and identifying major themes that will inform the planning process going forward. I encourage you to mark your calendar for 11 a.m. April 26, when the committee and I will share these initial results during a meeting in Frazier Hall and provide information about the next steps in the process, including the formation of university-wide work groups to evaluate each major theme.
