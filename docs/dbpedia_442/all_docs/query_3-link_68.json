        "text": "Rotations\n\nChoosing a research advisor and a dissertation research project are some of the most significant decisions you will make in graduate school. First-year lab rotations provide students the opportunity to explore different research interests and lab management styles prior to the selection of a Ph.D. supervisor. You may do first-year research rotations with any faculty member on the Cell and Molecular Biology, Biochemistry or Microbiology Graduate Studies Committees.\n\nTo help make an informed decision about your lab rotations:\n\nAttend seminars by faculty members\n\nMeet individually with faculty members\n\nConsult with other graduate students\n\nConsult the CMB Graduate Advisor\n\n2024 Laboratory Rotation Schedule\n\nJune 3 - August 9, 2024 // Early Summer Rotation\n\nAugust 12 – September 20, 2024 // First Rotation\n\nSeptember 23 – November 1, 2024 // Second Rotation\n\nNovember 4 – December 13, 2024 // Third Rotation\n\nRotations are arranged through mutual agreement between the student and the faculty member (Principal Investigator or ‘PI’) of the lab in which the rotation is arranged.\n\nRefer to the Graduate Program Handbook for additional information about lab rotations and joining a permanent lab.\n\nCourses\n\nStudents must complete a set of core courses as required by the CMB program, plus additional track-specific electives. Students must register for a minimum of nine credit hours each fall and spring semester and a minimum of 3 credits in the summer semester. These credits may include formal graded courses and/or research hours. In order to maintain satisfactory academic progress, students must maintain a cumulative grade point average (GPA) of 3.0 or higher.\n\nPlease see the Graduate Program Handbook for additional detail about courses and registration.\n\nRequired Student Training\n\nThe University of Texas requires safety training for laboratory employees, which includes all Cell and Molecular Biology graduate students. CMB students are required to be in compliance with these safety classes prior to beginning their first lab rotation. The required safety courses offered by the Environmental Health and Safety Office (EHS) are:\n\nOH 101 Hazard Communication\n\nOH 102 Hazard Communication (Site-Specific)\n\nOH 201 Laboratory Safety\n\nOH 202 Hazardous Waste Management\n\nFF 205 Fire Extinguisher Use\n\nThese trainings are offered online in a self-paced asynchronous format. Students may register for and complete the above courses online via UT Learn.\n\nThe Fire Prevention Services Office sponsors the Fire Extinguisher Use course, with more information at fireprevention.utexas.edu/fire-safety/portable-fire-extinguisher-training.\n\nAnimal Use Training, and Radiological Health are available on-campus classes and are typically offered at the start of every fall semester.\n\nIn addition, all academic graduate student employees must complete the following University-wide trainings:\n\nTitle IX Basics\n\nSexual Misconduct Prevention\n\nInformation Security Awareness\n\nCompliance & Ethics Program at UT Austin\n\nCMB Core Courses\n\nThe current Fall required Core Courses are:\n\nMOL 290C Introduction to Biostatistics & Computational Analysis\n\nMOL 190C Responsible Conduct of Research\n\nMOL 395J Genes, Genomes, and Gene Expression\n\nIn Spring, CMB students must take at least one of the following core courses:\n\nMOL 395H Cell Biology\n\nMOL/BIO 95F Genetics\n\nIf students choose to take only one of the above courses, they must take one of the following core courses in accordance with their chosen track (see Track Selection below):\n\nBCH 394P Bioinformatics\n\nBCH 394 Structure and Function of Proteins and Nucleic Acids\n\nBIO 395G Graduate Biochemistry\n\nBIO 395M Advanced Microbiology\n\nIf a student earns less than a B in any of the core courses, they will need to retake the course. If it is necessary to repeat a core course, it must be taken at the very next opportunity that the course is offered. The core courses may not be taken more than twice.\n\nNote that the Graduate School requires a cumulative GPA of 3.0 to remain in good standing. Failure to pass a core course that is being re-taken for the second time and/or failure to maintain a GPA of 3.0 or higher will result in dismissal from the program.\n\nCMB Track-specific requirements\n\nPrior to the Spring semester, students will self-affiliate with the CMB program track that is most relevant to their research interests. Each of these tracks has suggested or required courses for the spring semester. In the absence of student input, BIO 395F and BIO 395H are the default courses for the spring semester. Students who wish to take courses other than these default Spring courses should discuss this with the First Year Graduate Advisor and the Graduate Program Staff prior to registration.\n\nSpecific requirements and course options may be found under the Tracks tab.\n\nAdditional Courses\n\nIn preparation for the qualifying exam, second-year students are required to take BIO 391 Grant Writing & Presentation Skills. BIO 391 is a writing-intensive course that involves writing of an NIH-style grant proposal on their own research, presentation of the proposal to the class, and practice in identifying specific aims in research areas outside their primary area. The class is taken by students in the Microbiology, Biochemistry, and Cell and Molecular Biology Programs.\n\nTracks\n\nTrack Requirements: Core Courses and Electives\n\nStudents in the following tracks may substitute track-specific course for either Genetics (BIO 395F) or Cell Biology (BIO 395H) (but not both), in the spring semester of the first year.\n\nPlease note that the approved track core course lists are constantly changing and students should consult with the First Year Graduate Advisor if they wish to substitute a track-specific course for one of the spring core courses. Students not in the following tracks may still be able to substitute a track core course in consultation with their supervisor and Track Representative.\n\nTracks reserve the right to modify and change track-specific requirements and will inform students of any such changes\n\nStudents must consult their PI, Track Representative and the Graduate Program Handbook for information about the requirements for their specific track. Courses should be selected in consultation with the student’s PI and Track Representative. Journal club courses are NOT suitable as electives, although note that some tracks may have additional journal club or seminar course requirements.\n\nThe specific requirements for each track are listed below.\n\nCMB Tracks\n\nBioinformatics and Computational Biology\n\nTrack Representative: Can Cenik\n\nComputational analysis is now widely used in the vast majority of cellular and molecular biology. Students in the Bioinformatics and Computational Biology Track will have an increased emphasis on the computational aspects. What constitutes significant computation is dependent on the lab and project, with an allowance for a significant amount of diversity in scope. All computational student dissertations must address a topic in cellular and molecular biology (defined broadly, and including, for example, systems and synthetic biology, biochemistry, microbiology, developmental biology, etc.) and may involve the development of new software tools, computationally intensive statistical analyses, or theoretical modeling. Typically employed programming languages include Python, R, Java, C++, RUST, Julia, and Matlab. The balance between pure computer science and data analysis can vary and will be dictated by the nature of the project and the interests of the student and advisor, but it is expected that thesis projects will have some significant biological focus. Projects can emphasize the development of a new algorithm (e.g. protein folding), data processing, statistical analyses, or use of sophisticated database management systems for big data applications to name just a few examples.\n\nAll BCB students should take one class from the list below. Students are required to take one BCB elective that may be chosen from the pre-approved list below or in consultation with their PI and Graduate Advisor or Track Representative.\n\nA partial list of these courses includes:\n\nBIO 382K Computational and Statistical Biology\n\nBCH 394P Bioinformatics\n\nCSE 382M. Foundational Techniques of Machine Learning and Data Sciences\n\nCSE 383M Stat/Discrete Methods Sci Comput\n\nCSE 380 -Tools/Techniqs Computatnl Sci\n\nSDS 380C. Statistical Methods I\n\nSDS 380D. Statistical Methods II\n\nSDS 384. Topics in Statistics and Probability\n\nSDS 385. Topics in Applied Statistics\n\nSSC 394C Parallel Comput for Sci & Engr\n\nCS 391L Machine Learning\n\nIn addition to the core courses taken in the first year, students must meet the following track requirements:\n\nDemonstrate competence in computer programming. It is expected that all BCB Track students can program in at least one language (e.g. Python, Julia, Java, R, Matlab, C, C++ etc.). This competency can be demonstrated through coursework or through practical experience. Contact the Track Representative and the student’s PI with any questions.\n\nDemonstrate competence in the fundamentals of Biostatistics and/or Data Science (e.g. sequence analysis). It is expected that BCB Track students can interpret and perform basic statistical analyses and/or rigorous data analysis and communicate effectively with a statistician and/or domain scientist for more sophisticated analyses. This competency can be demonstrated through coursework or through practical experience.\n\nFaculty Affiliated with BCB Track:\n\nAlper, Hal\n\nAnslyn, Eric\n\nBarrick, Jeffrey\n\nBolnick, Daniel\n\nBrock, Amy\n\nBull, JamesCenik, Can\n\nCenik, Elif\n\nContreras, Lydia\n\nElber, Ron\n\nEllington, Andrew\n\nGeorgiou, George\n\nGutell, Robin\n\nHillis, David\n\nHofman, Hans\n\nJansen, Bob\n\nMakarov, Dmitrii\n\nMarcotte, Edward\n\nMarkey, Mia\n\nMeyers, Lauren\n\nMiranker, Daniel\n\nPress, William\n\nWilke, Claus\n\nYi, Stephen\n\nBiomolecular Structure and Function\n\nTrack Representative: Kenneth Johnson\n\nThe BSF Track covers research involving the determination of structures of macromolecules and studies to define their functions.

In the fall of their second year, students complete Principles of Neuroscience I (NEU 482T), a course that deals with cellular and molecular neuroscience. In the spring semester of their 2nd year, students are required to complete an additional elective course, from the following, selected in consultation with the track representative and the research mentor. Note that this list is constantly changing, and students may have to refer to the Track Representative for a current list\n\nFall:\n\nNEU 382T Principles Of Neuroscience I\n\nPGS 383D Neuropharmacology\n\nNEU 383C Functional Neuroanatomy\n\nNEU 384M Advanced Statistics: Inferential\n\nNEU 385L 8-Ion Channels/Neuronal Sign\n\nSpring:\n\nNEU 383D Neuropharmacology\n\nNEU 380E Vision Systems\n\nNEU 383T Principles Of Neuroscience II\n\nNEU 385L Pharmacolgcl Mechs Of Addictn\n\nNEU 381N Basic Processes Of Nerve Cells\n\nNEU 385L 9-Synap Phys/Plasticity In Cns\n\nNEU 385L Computational Neuroscience\n\nNEU 394P 1-Curr Tpcs In Behav Neurosci\n\nNEU 394P 3-Neurobiol Of Learning/Memory\n\nNEU 396D Clinical Psychopharmacology\n\nCourses that may not consistently be offered:\n\nNEU 385L Brain, Behavior, and Evolution – Fall\n\nNEU 385L 12-Quantifying Brain Structure – Fall\n\nNEU 384C Bootstrap Statistics\n\nNEU 394P Tpcs Statistics/Neural Coding\n\nBeginning their 3rd year of graduate training, students must enroll and actively participate in the presentation and discussion of the current scientific literature in neuroscience. A list of appropriate journal clubs is available from the track representative. As faculty, we strongly recommend (and students PIs may require) that students serve as a teaching assistant in a graduate or undergraduate course in neuroscience, neurobiology, or neuropharmacology at least once in their graduate career.\n\nFaculty Affiliated with Neurobiology Track:\n\nAgarwala, Seema\n\nAldrich, Richard\n\nAtkinson, Nigel\n\nBen-Yakar, Adela\n\nBittner, George\n\nDrew, Michael\n\nEllington, Andrew\n\nGolding, Nace\n\nGore, Andrea\n\nHarris, Adron\n\nHofman, Hans\n\nMarcotte, Edward\n\nMatsui, Bill\n\nMessing, Robert\n\nMihic, John\n\nMorikawa, Hitoshi\n\nNishiyama, Hiroshi\n\nPhelps, Steven\n\nPierce, Jonathan\n\nPriebe, Nicholas\n\nSenning, Eric\n\nShear, Jason\n\nZakon, Harold\n\nZemelman, Boris\n\nPlant Molecular Biology\n\nTrack Representative: Mona Mehdy\n\nThe Plant Molecular Biology faculty address fundamental biological questions important to plant development, physiology and evolution at molecular, cellular and organismal levels. Plants not only provide us with food, fiber and shelter but have also provided the experimental systems for major advances in science such as the discovery of hereditary laws (Gregor Mendel’s work in garden peas), the discovery of transposable elements (Barbara McClintock’s work in maize) and the discovery of RNA interference (co-suppresion in petunia). Arabidopsis thaliana, a fast growing flowering plant with a completely sequenced genome, has become a major model organism for studies in genetics, development, cell biology and evolutionary biology.\n\nFaculty with research interests in plant molecular biology represents a broad range on several frontiers of plant molecular biology. These include cell fate determination, cellulose biosynthesis and fiber development, signal transduction, gene regulation by light and environmental cues, RNA splicing, translational regulation, function of duplicate genes and genomes, comparative genomics, plant pathogen interactions, molecular systematics, and phenotypic evolution.\n\nStudents interested in plant molecular biology are encouraged to explore the exciting research in the laboratories listed below.\n\nThe Plant Biology Track requires students to complete the global requirements of the Cell and Molecular Biology program that ensure that trainees have a strong grounding in the biological sciences. There is one elective requirement for the Plant Biology track. Students may choose from the following list:\n\nFall:\n\nBIO 388M Plant Molecular Biology (Herrin)\n\nBIO 381P Advanced Plant Physiology (Clark)\n\nSpring:\n\nBIO 388E Plant Growth And Development (Huq)\n\nFaculty\n\nBrowning, Karen\n\nChen, Jeff\n\nHawkes, ChristineHuq, EnamulJansen, Robert\n\nJuenger, Thomas\n\nEllington, Andrew\n\nLloyd, Alan\n\nMarcotte, Edward\n\nMehdy, Mona\n\nMoran, NancyQiao, Hong\n\nRoux, Stanley\n\nSung, Sibum\n\nTorii, Keiko\n\nQualifying Examination\n\nQualifying Examination\n\nIn order to proceed with the Qualifying Exam, a CMB graduate student must:\n\nHave a cumulative GPA of at least 3.0\n\nHave completed all core courses with a grade of B or above\n\nBe assigned to a permanent laboratory\n\nIf an international student, have completed ITA English-Language Certification and be eligible for employment “with student contact”\n\nBelow is a summary of the Qualifying Exam. Please review the Graduate Program Handbook for complete guidelines.\n\nPurpose\n\nThe Qualifying Exam, often called the “qual” or “prelim”, is a major milestone in the Ph.D. program. The purpose of the Qualifying Examination is to evaluate a graduate student’s aptitude to perform original and independent research and to write a doctoral dissertation. The examination provides a means for a faculty committee to assess the student’s mastery of concepts and methodological approaches by evaluating the student’s general knowledge and fundamental understanding of cellular and molecular biology and the student’s ability to design, articulate, explain and defend the proposed aims and research approach of their dissertation research. The ultimate goal of the Qualifying Examination is to ensure that the student has achieved a sufficiently high level of knowledge and skills necessary for successful completion of a Ph.D. dissertation.\n\nTimeline & Procedure\n\nAll graduate students in their second year who have passed the appropriate number of required courses will take the Qualifying Exam to advance to candidacy. If a student has not passed all the core courses with a grade of B or above, or, if they are an international student and are not yet “certified for employment with student contact,” the Qualifying Exam will be delayed to within 3 months of completing these requirements. The Qualifying Exam is normally taken in the spring semester of a student’s second year.\n\nStudents who have not taken the Qualifying Exam by the end of their second year must write an explanatory letter of appeal to the GSC Chair and will be assigned a probationary status until further notice\n\nA Qualifying Exam informational meeting for second-year students will take place in the fall semester each year. At this meeting, students will review the timetable and guidelines of the Qualifying Exam as well as the expectations and exam process.\n\nFormat\n\nThe Qualifying Exam consists of written and oral components. The written component is submitted two weeks prior to the Qualifying Exam and will form a large basis of the oral exam.\n\nBelow is a summary of these requirements. Please refer to the Graduate Program Handbook for additional details.\n\nQualifying Exam Outcomes and Consequences\n\nAt the conclusion of the examination (usually when committee members have no further questions), the student will again be asked to leave the room and the committee will deliberate. The committee will then call the student back into the room to convey its decision. Possible outcomes are:\n\nPass;\n\nConditional Pass (with conditions specified by the exam committee);\n\nRe-examination of one or more parts of the Qualifying Exam at a later date;\n\nTermination of work toward the Ph.D.\n\nCandidacy\n\nOnce a student successfully completes their Qualifying Exam, they will apply for, and be admitted to candidacy. Students are expected to do so by the end of your second year. There may be a small number of students who are not able to complete their Qualifying Exam with the rest of their cohort. In such cases, the student must reach candidacy by the end of the third year (sixth long semester). Failure to meet this benchmark will result in loss of good standing in the program. Any exceptions require approval of the Graduate Advisor, and must be communicated to the Graduate Program Administrator. The Graduate School will notify the student via email when their Candidacy Application is approved\n\nRequirements for Admission to Candidacy\n\nCompletion of all core courses with a grade of B or above\n\nA cumulative grade point average of at least 3.0\n\nSuccessful completion of the Qualifying Exam\n\nSubmission and final approval of a Candidacy Application.\n\nDissertation Committee\n\nBefore submission of the Candidacy Application, the student will need to form an official dissertation committee.\n\nThe Dissertation Committee has three primary responsibilities:\n\nGeneral supervision of the student’s research,\n\nTo Monitor progress toward degree,\n\nTo Certify to the Graduate Dean that an acceptable dissertation has been submitted.\n\nPlease review the Graduate Program Handbook for complete guidelines for applying to Candidacy and forming a Dissertation Committee.\n\nAnnual Meetings\n\nOnce a student has been admitted to candidacy, they are required to meet annually with their Dissertation Committee to review their progress. The first annual meeting with the Dissertation Committee should be held within the next long semester (typically by the end of the fall semester) following admission to candidacy. Subsequent annual meetings should be held in the fall semester of each academic year; however, committee meetings may also take place in the spring semesters, at the discretion of the committee.\n\nStudents are responsible for coordinating a meeting date and time with faculty. Once a date for the committee meeting has been agreed upon students must email the Graduate Program Staff the date the meeting has been scheduled for. Students who have not conducted or scheduled their meeting by March 31st each year will have a registration bar placed on their account. They will not be able to register for Summer or Fall classes until they have scheduled their committee meeting and conveyed this to the Graduate Program Staff.\n\nFollowing the annual meeting, the Acting Committee Chair will complete an evaluation form, with input from all the committee members, including the PI. This form will be endorsed by the committee and must be returned to the Graduate Program Staff. The signed form and written recommendations will be included in the student’s record.\n\nIf a student has not completed the dissertation within three years of admission to candidacy, the results of the annual review will be presented with recommendations to the CMB GSC Executive Committee. The CMB Executive Committee will then decide what actions may be required.\n\nAlthough the supervising professor provides day-to-day guidance, all members of the committee are expected to be available for consultation and students should feel free to ask for advice from them or any faculty member.\n\nTeaching\n\nThe CMB Graduate Program requires all students to be appointed as a TA for at least one semester by no later than the fourth year. All students must complete a mandatory TA training workshop prior to their first TA appointment. This workshop is offered at the start of each fall and spring semester and is coordinated by the Biology Instructional Office (BIO).\n\nPlease review the Graduate Program Handbook for additional guidelines about Teaching Assistantships.\n\nITA English Language Certification for International Students\n\nUT Austin conducts English-Language Certification for TAs whose first language is not English. The CMB Graduate Program requires this certification of all international students, regardless of whether they serve as teaching assistants. All international students admitted to the CMB Graduate Program are anticipated to unconditionally pass the Oral English Proficiency Assessment and be “certified with student contact.” Students must be certified to be employed “with student contact” before being admitted to candidacy. Under certain circumstances, international students may be exempt from the requirement to complete the ITA English-Language Certification exam.\n\nAdditional information can be found at global.utexas.edu/english-language-center/about/department-resources. ILSGP will sponsor the registration cost for ITA English-Language Certification. Please also consult the Graduate Program Staff prior to registration."
