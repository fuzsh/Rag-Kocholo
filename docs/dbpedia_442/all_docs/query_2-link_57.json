My journey continues to rediscover the great ideas and people of the digital age. This journey brings me to this book about Claude Shannon. Shannon has his place on that list. Identified as a unique individual, so early on, people protected him. He was known as the creator of Information Theory (or, more precisely, Transmission Theory). He liked tinkering and theory; they aligned with his research interests. Meaning he was a mathematician, scientist, and engineer. He was an avid un-cyclist and juggler.\n\nShannon was inherently private, never seeking publicity or media attention. He didn't play politics, didn't care about such things. He preferred quietness as he thought about big problems. His early days were \"normal\" and uneventful. He did try to learn to fly at MIT, and the lead instructor was so worried that a valuable person such as Shannon would be put in danger. He even notified his concerns to the MIT President at the time. This short snippet shows Shannon's importance, even when young. He was always treated differently (probably to the annoyance of fellow students and colleagues).\n\nThe book goes over his significant and unusual achievements, his early work on the re-configuration of an analog computer, creating one of the first mathematical representations for biology (before the discovery of A, C, G, and T), war effort, Information theory, cryptography, first robot mouse maze solver, exploring AI to solve the Game of Chess, juggling algorithm, and building a system to teach Americans to drive on the left-hand side of the road. His joy was jumping into subjects where there was no existing thought. His most incredible skill was picking a new topic, generalizing it, and leaving exceptions for others to discover.\n\nHe believed humans are just complicated machines. AI will be an evolutionary step in transitioning intellect from the biological to something more intelligent, lasting longer and making humans obsolete. His point was that the human system was a terrible design, and the parts were difficult to replace.\n\nHe even created the first portable system to scam Casino Roulette wheels. He appears throughout the book to be modest and fun. When Information Theory took the world by storm, he disliked the idea that it was the ultimate solution to every problem. He even wrote about his dislike and tried to ground people in reality. More importantly, he helped many people; he never directly criticized them but instead asked poignant questions to expand their thinking.\n\nRichard Hamming (of error correction fame) said of Shannon a sign of a great scientist is courage. Shannon's courage was a significant piece of the Information Age. He eventually succumbed to Alzheimer's in 2001. The great thing about any biography is that it describes the person behind the ideas. Shannon maybe lesser known in the history of computing but we all see his influence everyday."
