        "text": "The following excerpts are from an interview with Marvin Minsky which took place at his home in Brookline, Massachusetts, on January 23rd, 1991. The interview, which is included in its entirety as a Foreword in the book Understanding Music with AI: Perspectives on Music Cognition (edited by Mira Balaban, Kemal Ebcioglu, and Otto Laske), is a conversation about music, its peculiar features as a human activity, the special problems it poses for the scientist, and the suitability of AI methods for clarifying and/or solving some of these problems. The conversation is open-ended, and should be read accordingly, as a discourse to be continued at another time.\n\nIt's quite conceivable that human thinking can be completely taken over by devices. In any case, there is a stage conceivable in the future when our thinking and doings will be completely regulated by machines. Or by those who are behind this development, or those who have programmed those devices. Just as the stupid have ended up in prisons and institutions, so too it can easily be arranged that people with an intelligence much less than AI are going to be completely monitored and controlled. At the moment, this is still a matter of speculation, but experiments in that direction have already been set in motion. However, what is \"stupid,\" I wonder. Measuring the risk of clash and crash using my algorithm is quite different from an IQ-test. My message is: â€¢ Most scientific research is superfluous because they are impracticable and unsuitable in a non-technical field.\n\nThis chapter is aimed at introducing the reader to field of artificial intelligence (AI) in the context of its history and core themes. After a concise preamble introducing these themes, a brief and highly selective history will be presented. This history will be followed by a succinct introduction to the major research areas within AI. The chapter will continue with a description of currents trends in AI research, and will conclude with a discussion of the current situation with regard to the core themes.\n\nHaving artificially intelligent machines that think, learn, reason, experience, and can function autonomously, without supervision, is one of the most intriguing goals in all of Computer Science. As the types of problems we would like machines to solve get more complex, it is becoming a necessary goal as well. One of the many problems associated with this goal is that what learning and reasoning are have so many possible meanings that the solution can easily get lost in the sea of opinions and options. The goal of this paper is to establish some foundational principles, theory, and concepts that we feel are the backbone of real, autonomous Artificial Intelligence. With this fully autonomous, learning, reasoning, artificially intelligent system (an artificial brain), comes the need to possess constructs in its hardware and software that mimic processes and subsystems that exist within the human brain, including intuitive and emotional memory concepts. Presented here is a discussion o...\n\nEvery other aspect of intelligence and every structure of the learning process can be described very precisely in a way that teaches a machine how to simulate it, at which point Artificial Intelligence (AI) was established as a new field of study and research and generated expectations extraordinary. AI is the ability of a machine to imitate human functions such as reasoning, learning, planning and creativity. AI systems are able to adapt their behavior to some extent by analyzing the effects of previous actions and operating autonomously. Some AI technologies have been around for over 50 years, but increased computing power, the availability of enormous amounts of data, and new algorithms have led to major advances in AI in recent years. Artificial intelligence is considered a central element of the digital transformation of society and has become a priority for the EU. Future applications are expected to bring enormous changes, but AI is already present in our daily lives. Like an..."
