Less than\n\n100,000\n\nyears ago Homo sapiens begin using intelligence to further their goals More than\n\n5,000\n\nyears ago The abacus, which resembles the arithmetic unit of a modern computer, is developed in the Orient. 3000-700 B.C. Water clocks are built in China in 3000 B.C., in Egypt c. 1500 B.C. and in Assyria 700 B.C. 2500 B.C. Egyptians invent the idea of thinking machines: citizens turn for advice to oracles, which are statues with priests hidden inside. b. 469 B.C. Socrates, the mentor of Plato, is the first Western thinker to assert that mental activities occur in the unconscious. 469-322 B.C. Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle establish the essentially rationalistic philosophy of Western culture. 427 B.C. In the Phaedo and later works Plato expresses ideas, several millennia before the advent of the computer, that are relevant to modern dilemmas regarding human thought and its relation to the mechanics of the machine. c. 420 B.C. Archytas of Tarentum, a friend of Plato, constructs a wooden pigeon whose movements are controlled by a jet of steam or compressed air. b. 415 B.C. Theaetetus, a member of Plato's Academy, creates solid geometry. 387 B.C. Plato founds the Academy for the pursuit of science and philosophy in a grove on the outskirts of Athens. It results in the fertile development of mathematical theory. 343-334 B.C. Aristotle carries on the Platonic tradition by becoming the teacher of Alexander the Great in 343 B.C. and founding the Lyceum, also known as the peripatetic school of philosophers, in 334 B.C. 293 B.C. Euclid, also a member of Plato's Academy, is the expositor of plane geometry. He writes the Elements, a basic mathematics textbook for the next 2,000 years. c. 200 B.C. In China artisans develop elaborate automata, including an entire mechanical orchestra. c. 200 B.C. An Egyptian engineer improves the water clock, making it the most accurate timekeeping device for nearly 2,000 years. A.D. 529 Plato's Academy and Aristotle's Lyceum are closed by the emperor Justinian. c. 600 The earliest works mentioning the game of chess appear in India. 725 A Chinese engineer and a Buddhist monk build the first true mechanical clock, a water-driven device with an escapement that causes the clock to tick. c. 1310 The first mechanical clocks appear in Europe, apparently stemming from stories about the existence of mechanical clocks in China. 1494 Leonardo da Vinci draws a clock with a pendulum. 1530 The spinning wheel is in use in Europe. 1540, 1772 The technology of clock and watch making results in the production of more elaborate automata during the European Renaissance.

Jacquet-Droz's child (1772) are famous examples. 1543 Nicolaus Copernicus publishes De Revolutionibus, in which he states that the earth and the other planets revolve around the sun, thereby changing humankind's relationship with God. 17th-18th\n\ncenturies This is the age of the Enlightenment, a philosophical movement to restore the supremacy of human reason, knowledge, and freedom, with parallel developments in science and theology. It had its roots in the European Renaissance and the Greek philosophy of twenty centuries earlier and constitutes the first systematic reconsideration of the nature of human thought and knowledge since the Platonists. 1617 John Napier invents Napier's Bones, of significance to the future development of calculating engines. 1637 Rene Descartes, who formulated the theory of optical refraction and developed the principles of modern analytic geometry, pushes rational skepticism to its limits in his most comprehensive work, Discours de la Methode.
