Less than\n\n100,000\n\nyears ago Homo sapiens begin using intelligence to further their goals More than\n\n5,000\n\nyears ago The abacus, which resembles the arithmetic unit of a modern computer, is developed in the Orient. 3000-700 B.C. Water clocks are built in China in 3000 B.C., in Egypt c. 1500 B.C. and in Assyria 700 B.C. 2500 B.C. Egyptians invent the idea of thinking machines: citizens turn for advice to oracles, which are statues with priests hidden inside. b. 469 B.C. Socrates, the mentor of Plato, is the first Western thinker to assert that mental activities occur in the unconscious. 469-322 B.C. Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle establish the essentially rationalistic philosophy of Western culture. 427 B.C. In the Phaedo and later works Plato expresses ideas, several millennia before the advent of the computer, that are relevant to modern dilemmas regarding human thought and its relation to the mechanics of the machine. c. 420 B.C. Archytas of Tarentum, a friend of Plato, constructs a wooden pigeon whose movements are controlled by a jet of steam or compressed air. b. 415 B.C. Theaetetus, a member of Plato's Academy, creates solid geometry. 387 B.C. Plato founds the Academy for the pursuit of science and philosophy in a grove on the outskirts of Athens. It results in the fertile development of mathematical theory. 343-334 B.C. Aristotle carries on the Platonic tradition by becoming the teacher of Alexander the Great in 343 B.C. and founding the Lyceum, also known as the peripatetic school of philosophers, in 334 B.C. 293 B.C. Euclid, also a member of Plato's Academy, is the expositor of plane geometry. He writes the Elements, a basic mathematics textbook for the next 2,000 years. c. 200 B.C. In China artisans develop elaborate automata, including an entire mechanical orchestra. c. 200 B.C. An Egyptian engineer improves the water clock, making it the most accurate timekeeping device for nearly 2,000 years. A.D. 529 Plato's Academy and Aristotle's Lyceum are closed by the emperor Justinian. c. 600 The earliest works mentioning the game of chess appear in India. 725 A Chinese engineer and a Buddhist monk build the first true mechanical clock, a water-driven device with an escapement that causes the clock to tick. c. 1310 The first mechanical clocks appear in Europe, apparently stemming from stories about the existence of mechanical clocks in China. 1494 Leonardo da Vinci draws a clock with a pendulum. 1530 The spinning wheel is in use in Europe. 1540, 1772 The technology of clock and watch making results in the production of more elaborate automata during the European Renaissance.

Jacquet-Droz's child (1772) are famous examples. 1543 Nicolaus Copernicus publishes De Revolutionibus, in which he states that the earth and the other planets revolve around the sun, thereby changing humankind's relationship with God. 17th-18th\n\ncenturies This is the age of the Enlightenment, a philosophical movement to restore the supremacy of human reason, knowledge, and freedom, with parallel developments in science and theology. It had its roots in the European Renaissance and the Greek philosophy of twenty centuries earlier and constitutes the first systematic reconsideration of the nature of human thought and knowledge since the Platonists. 1617 John Napier invents Napier's Bones, of significance to the future development of calculating engines. 1637 Rene Descartes, who formulated the theory of optical refraction and developed the principles of modern analytic geometry, pushes rational skepticism to its limits in his most comprehensive work, Discours de la Methode.

It is the world's first automatic calculating machine. c. 1650 Otto von Guericke perfects the air pump and uses it to produce vacuums. 1670 Pensees, by Blaise Pascal, is published posthumously. 1687 Isaac Newton's Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica, known as Principia, established his three laws of motion and the law of universal gravitation. 1694 Gottfried Wilhelm Liebniz, an inventor of calculus, perfects the Liebniz Computer, a machine that multiplies by performing repetitive additions, an algorithm still used in modern computers. 1719 What appears to be the first factory, an English silk-thread mill, employs 300 workers, mostly women and children.for row 33, column 2 1726 Jonathan Swift describes a machine that will automatically write books in Gulliver's Travels. 1733 John Kay paves the way for much faster weaving by patenting his New Engine for Opening and Dressing Wool, laster known as the flying shuttle. 1760 Benjamin Franklin, in Philadelphia, erects lightning rods after having found, through his famous kite experiment in 1752, that lightning is a form of electricity. c. 1760 Life expectancy at the beginning of the Industrial Revolution is about 37 years in North America and northwestern Europe. 1764 James Hargreaves invents the spinning jenny, which is able to spin eight threads at once. 1769 Richard Arkwright, the founder of the modern factory system, patents a hydraulic spinning machine that is too large and expensive to use in family dwellings. He builds a factory for his machine in 1781, thereby paving the way for many of the economic and social changes that will characterize the Industrial Revolution. 1781 Immanuel Kant publishes his Critique of Pure Reason, which expresses the philosophy of the Enlightenment while deemphasizing the role of metaphysics. He sets the stage for the emergence of twentieth-century rationalism. 1792 Edmund Cartwright devises the first machine to comb wool to feed the new mechanized spinning machines. 1792 William Murdock invents coal-gas lighting. The streets of London will be illuminated by 1802. 1800 All aspects of the production of cloth are automated. 1805 Joseph-Marie Jacquard devises a method for automating weaving with a series of punched cards.
