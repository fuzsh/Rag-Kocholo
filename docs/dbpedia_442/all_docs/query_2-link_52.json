        "text": "Claude Elwood Shannon (April 30, 1916 â€“ February 24, 2001) was an American mathematician, electrical engineer, computer scientist and cryptographer known as the \"father of information theory\" and as the \"father of the Information Age\".[1][2] Shannon was the first to describe the Boolean gates (electronic circuits) that are essential to all digital electronic circuits, and was one of the founding fathers of artificial intelligence.[3][4][5][1][6] He is credited alongside George Boole for laying the foundations of the Information Age.[7][8][9][6]\n\nQuick Facts Born, Died ...\n\nClose\n\nAt the University of Michigan, Shannon dual degreed, graduating with a Bachelor of Science in both electrical engineering and mathematics in 1936. A 21-year-old master's degree student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in electrical engineering, his thesis concerned switching circuit theory, demonstrating that electrical applications of Boolean algebra could construct any logical numerical relationship,[10] thereby establishing the theory behind digital computing and digital circuits.[11] The thesis has been claimed to be the most important master's thesis of all time,[10] as in 1985, Howard Gardner described it as \"possibly the most important, and also the most famous, master's thesis of the century\",[12] while Herman Goldstine described it as \"surely ... one of the most important master's theses ever written ... It helped to change digital circuit design from an art to a science.\"[13] It has also been called the \"birth certificate of the digital revolution\",[14] and it won the 1939 Alfred Noble Prize.[15] Shannon then graduated with a PhD in mathematics from MIT in 1940,[16] with his thesis focused on genetics, with it deriving important results, but it went unpublished.[17]\n\nShannon contributed to the field of cryptanalysis for national defense of the United States during World War II, including his fundamental work on codebreaking and secure telecommunications, writing a paper which is considered one of the foundational pieces of modern cryptography,[18] with his work described as \"a turning point, and marked the closure of classical cryptography and the beginning of modern cryptography.\"[19] The work of Shannon is the foundation of secret-key cryptography, including the work of Horst Feistel, the Data Encryption Standard (DES), Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), and more.[19] As a result, Shannon has been called the \"founding father of modern cryptography\".[20]\n\nHis mathematical theory of communication laid the foundations for the field of information theory,[21][16] with his famous paper being called the \"Magna Carta of the Information Age\" by Scientific American,[9][22] along with his work being described as being at \"the heart of today's digital information technology\".[23] Robert G. Gallager referred to the paper as a \"blueprint for the digital era\".[24] Regarding the influence that Shannon had on the digital age, Solomon W. Golomb remarked \"It's like saying how much influence the inventor of the alphabet has had on literature.\"[21] Shannon's theory is widely used and has been fundamental to the success of many scientific endeavors, such as the invention of the compact disc, the development of the Internet, feasibility of mobile phones, the understanding of black holes, and more, and is at the intersection of numerous important fields.[25][26]\n\nShannon made numerous contributions to the field of artificial intelligence,[3] writing papers on programming a computer for chess, which have been immensely influential,[27][28] and also his Theseus machine was the first electrical device to learn by trial and error, being one of the first examples of artificial intelligence.[29][30] He also co-organized and participated in the Dartmouth workshop of 1956, considered the founding event of the field of artificial intelligence.[31][32] He also made contributions to multiple other fields, such as detection theory and combinatorics.[33]"
