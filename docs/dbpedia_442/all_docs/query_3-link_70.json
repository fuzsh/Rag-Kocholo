        "text": "Since 2013, the Cincinnati May Festival has partnered with CCM’s choral conducting department each year to select a Fellow from the doctor of musical arts (DMA) class. The unique partnership was established through the generous support of Ginger Warner, a University of Cincinnati trustee and Director Emeritus of the May Festival Board of Directors.\n\nThe collaboration between a top conservatory and a leading choral festival \"attracts the top choral leaders from all across the country,\" said Steven Sunderman, Executive Director of the May Festival. \"The program provides the appointed Fellow opportunities to enrich personal and professional development, and it contributes to the legacy of the May Festival, providing the world with the highest standard of musical excellence.\"\n\nWhile at IU, Tkachenko directed the All-Campus Chorus, Conductors Chorus and was the assistant conductor for the Singing Hoosiers, IU’s widely celebrated show choir. In his role as Fellow, Tkachenko will assist Director of Choruses Robert Porco. \"Sergey brings great experience and talent to our organization,\" said Porco. \"I look forward to working with him in his new capacity.\"\n\nIn addition to assisting Porco in the leadership of the May Festival Chorus, Tkachenko will have the opportunity to gain invaluable hands-on experience with all facets of a major choral organization—including artistic planning, finance, marketing and engagement.\n\n\"The May Festival Conducting Fellowship is a unique and successful alliance of two world class choral organizations,\" said CCM Professor and Director of Choral Studies Joe Miller. \"Sergey comes to Cincinnati with an extensive background in professional conducting, and this opportunity will allow our community to nurture and celebrate a rising talent in the conducting profession.\"\n\n\"I am thrilled to start my musical journey in Cincinnati as the May Festival’s next Choral Conducting Fellow,\" said Tkachenko, who is the eleventh CCM student to take on the role. \"It’s an honor to join one of the finest choral music organizations in the world. I look forward to making meaningful connections, and sharing compelling stories with our audiences through the performance of beloved masterworks.\""
