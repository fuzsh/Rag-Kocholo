Our community is rich in history. Founded as a lumber mill town and railroad hub on the Rock River, over time the community has become synonymous with the Horicon Marsh, outdoor adventures, and wildlife conservation. Horicon has a historic downtown, quaint lodging and shops, walkable traditional neighborhoods, and an outstanding school district. Our community is affordable, and has a variety of large employers with a range of manufacturing and service businesses that are remarkable in such a beautiful natural setting.

Our Schools

Horicon has a strong school district that routinely exceeds the expectations of the State of Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction, placing us in fine company when compared with similar communities. Our particular strength is a high rating on student growth, and in closing gaps for economically disadvantaged students.

Secondary Education

Moraine Park Technical College (MPTC) is located a close 15-minutes away, and UW-Madison is only one hour away, making secondary education very accessible to our community.
