        "text": "Composition. There shall be created a board to be known and designated as the \"Tree Board\" composed of residents of the City of Horicon. Five of said members shall be appointed by the Mayor with the approval of the Common Council. The sixth member shall be the Director of Public Works-Utilities who shall be an nonvoting member. All members of the Tree Board shall serve without pay. Members appointed by the Mayor initially and thereafter shall be appointed for terms of three years. Vacancies caused by death, resignation, or otherwise shall be filled for the unexpired term in the same manner as original appointments are made.\n\n[Amended at time of adoption of Code (see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art. II)]\n\nOrganization. Within a reasonable time after the appointment of said Tree Board and the approval of the members thereof, upon call of the Mayor, the Tree Board shall meet and organize by the election of a Chairperson and the appointment of a Secretary. The Tree Board shall then provide for the adoption of rules and procedures and for the holding of regular and special meetings as said Board shall deem advisable and necessary in order to perform the duties set forth.\n\nThe City Forester, the Forester's authorized representative and members of the Tree Board may enter upon private premises at all reasonable times for the purpose of examining any tree or shrub located upon or over such premises and carrying out any of the provisions of this chapter. If consent to entry to personal or real properties which are not public buildings or to portions of public buildings which are not open to the public for inspection purposes has been denied, the City Forester shall obtain a special inspection warrant under ยง 66.0119, Wis. Stats.\n\nPermit required. No person, except upon order of the City Forester, shall plant or remove or perform major alterations, as determined by the Forester, on a tree or shrub in the public right-of-way terrace area or cause such act to be done by others without first obtaining a written permit for such work from the Forester through the Department of Public Works-Utilities. The applicant shall comply with the standards set forth in the City of Horicon Arboricultural Specifications Manual.\n\nPermit form; expiration; inspection. Every permit shall be issued by the City Forester or Director of the Department of Public Works-Utilities on a standard form and shall include a description of the work to be done and shall specify the genus, species, variety, size, nursery grade and location of trees and shrubs to be planted, if any. Any work under such permit must be performed in strict accordance with the terms thereof and the provisions of the Arboricultural Specifications Manual. Supervision and inspection of work done under a permit shall be by the City Forester or Director of the Department of Public Works-Utilities. Permits issued under this section shall expire six months after date of issuance. There will be no charge for this permit.\n\nUnlawfully planted trees. Trees, plants, or shrubs planted within any terrace or planting easement without the authorization and approval of the Forester may be removed. The abutting owner shall be notified in writing, listing the unlawfully planted trees, plants or shrubs, ordering their removal and establishing a reasonable time within such removal shall be accomplished. In the event that removal is not to be accomplished within the time specified, the City may remove such trees, plants or shrubs and assess the costs thereof to the owner.\n\nShould any person or persons owning real property bordering on any street fail to prune trees as herein provided, the City Forester may order, by written notice, the owner or occupant of any private place or premises on which there stands a tree or shrub which unreasonably interferes with or encroaches upon the street or sidewalk to take such steps as are necessary to remove such interference. If such owner or occupant fails within 10 days of receipt of notice to take such necessary steps, the City Forester and/or Director of Public Works-Utilities shall order City employees to remove the interference. The cost of removing the interference shall be levied and collected as a special tax upon the property upon which or in front of which such tree or shrub stands.\n\nDangerous, obstructive and infected trees. Any tree or part thereof, whether alive or dead, which the City Forester shall find to be infected, hazardous or a nuisance so as to endanger the public or other trees, plants or shrubs growing within the City or to be injurious to sewers, sidewalks or other public improvements, whether growing upon public or private premises, shall be removed, trimmed or treated by the owner of the property upon or adjacent to which such tree or part thereof is located. The City Forester shall give written notice to said owner to remedy the situation which shall be served personally or posted upon the affected tree. Such notice shall specifically state the period of time within which the action must be taken, which shall be within not less than 24 hours nor more than 14 days as determined by the City Forester on the basis of the seriousness of the condition of the tree or danger to the public. If the owner shall fail to remove, treat or trim said tree within the time limited, the City Forester shall cause the tree to be removed, treated or trimmed and shall report the full cost thereof to the Clerk-Treasurer, who shall thereupon enter such cost as a special charge against the property.\n\nRemoval standards. In cutting down trees located in public and terrace areas, the tree must be removed with the root stump grubbed out, or ground out to a depth of at least nine inches below grade. The grade shall be measured in a straight line with the normal grade of sidewalk to the top of curb. All wood and debris must be removed from the street prior to the end of each working day and all holes shall be filled to normal grade level with topsoil as soon as practicable. The City shall pay the cost of stump removal and filling the hole. The abutting property owner shall have a right of first refusal to keep the wood, provided that such wood is not diseased.\n\n[Amended at time of adoption of Code (see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art. II)]\n\nPrivate removal. No person, firm, organization or corporation shall plant, injure, trim, remove or destroy any tree or shrub located in or upon any public place until a permit shall have been issued by the City Forester. Such permit shall be issued only when the removal, trimming or cutting of the tree or shrub is necessary, as determined by the City Forester, because of disease, damage, hazardous condition and/or location or its location is such that substantial detriment is done to the property upon which the tree or shrub stands or property abutting the same. Such permit shall expressly state the premises upon which the tree stands and the location of the tree thereon.\n\nDamage to public trees. No person shall, without the consent of the owner in the case of a private tree or shrub or without written permits from the City Forester in the case of a terrace area tree, public tree or shrub, perform or cause to be performed by others any of the following acts:\n\n(1)\n\nSecure, fasten or run any rope, wire sign, unprotected electrical installation or other device or material to, around or through a tree or shrub.\n\n(2)\n\nBreak, injure, mutilate, deface, kill or destroy any tree or shrub.\n\n(3)\n\nPermit any toxic chemical, gas, smoke, oil or other injurious substance to seep, drain, or be emptied upon or about any tree or shrub or place cement or other solid substance around the base of the same.\n\n(4)\n\nRemove any guard, stake or other device or material intended for the protection of a public tree or shrub or close or obstruct any open space about the base of a public tree or shrub designed to permit access of air, water and fertilizer.\n\n(5)\n\nAttach any sign, poster, notice or other object on any tree, or fasten any guy wire, cable, rope, nails, screws or other device to any tree, except that the City may tie temporary \"no parking\" signs to trees when necessary in conjunction with street improvement work, tree maintenance work or parades.\n\n(6)\n\nCause or encourage any fire or burning near or around any tree.\n\nExcavations. All trees on any parkway or other publicly owned property near any excavation or construction of any building structure or street work shall be sufficiently guarded and protected by those responsible for such work as to prevent any injury to said trees. No person shall excavate any ditches, tunnels or trenches or install pavement within a radius of 10 feet from any public tree without a permit from the City Forester.\n\nAny person who receives a determination or order under this chapter from the City Forester and objects to all or any part thereof shall have the right to appeal such determination or order, subject to the provisions of Ch. 68, Wis. Stats., to the Tree Board within seven days of receipt of the order, and the Tree Board shall hear such appeal within 15 days of receipt of written notice of the appeal. After such hearing the Tree Board may reverse, affirm or modify the order or determination appealed from and the grounds for its decision shall be stated in writing. The Tree Board shall, by letter, notify the party appealing the order or determination of its decision within 10 days after the hearing has been concluded. The Tree Board shall file its written decision with the Clerk-Treasurer."
