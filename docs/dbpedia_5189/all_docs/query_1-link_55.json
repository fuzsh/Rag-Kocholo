        "text": "Horicon Marsh Bird Club invites birders of all skill levels—as well as anyone who enjoys the great outdoors—to the Annual Horicon Marsh Bird Festival. This weekend-long event provides family-friendly activities and educational experiences designed to showcase Horicon Marsh’s role as an important habitat for birds and wildlife. The festival will include birding, paddling, LIVE birds of prey, smaller more intimate guided tours, and so much more!\n\nThe Horicon Marsh vast wetland is both a State Wildlife Area and a National Wildlife Refuge. Originally established as habitat for migrating and nesting ducks, it has since become a stopover for Canada Geese. Today, Horicon Marsh is increasingly recognized and managed as a wetland ecosystem for all of its plants and animals. Horicon Marsh has been designated as a Wetland of International Importance by the Ramsar Convention and a Global Important Bird Area by the American Bird Conservancy. No group of wildlife better represents the vitality of this marsh better than its birds. Over the years, a total of 304 species of birds have been sighted on this marsh.\n\nIf you’re a birder or a naturalist or just someone who enjoys the beauty of nature we encourage you to come visit Horicon Marsh. The Horicon Marsh Bird Festival will focus on introducing visitors to many of these birds at the peak of the spring migration.\n\nPack up your binoculars and join us!"
