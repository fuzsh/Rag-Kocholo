        "text": "The Horicon Marsh is recognized as a Wetland of International Importance as both a globally and state-important bird area. It is also a unit of the Ice Age Scientific Reserve and is the largest freshwater cattail marsh in the United States, measuring over 32,000 acres. It provides habitat for endangered species and migrating Canada geese and ducks, which often number more than 200,000.\n\nNature observation has grown throughout the years and people are fascinated and want to be educated about wildlife.\n\nBirds are the attraction to the area.\n\nThe Horicon Marsh is a shallow peat-filled lakebed gouged out by the Wisconsin Glacier about 12,000 years ago and is located on the west branch of the Rock River in Fond du Lac and Dodge Counties."
