        "text": "Horicon Marsh\n\nSite Information\n\nEcological Landscape: Southeast Glacial Plains.\n\nLocation: Dodge, Fond du Lac counties.\n\nPriority Habitats: Emergent Marsh, Idle Cool Season Grasses and Forbs, Idle Warm Season Grasses and Forbs, Central Hardwoods.\n\nIntroduction\n\nWhen early European settlers came to this land, they settled among the Indian villages and established their first modern settlement - the town of Horicon. In 1846, a dam was built to power a sawmill and develop steamboat navigation. It raised water levels by 3 meters and created Lake Horicon, then considered to be the largest man-made lake in the world. The dam remained for 23 years but was eventually removed to restore marsh conditions and wildlife populations.\n\nThe era that followed was one of hunting clubs and market hunting, which lasted into the early 1900s. Over-harvesting decimated waterbird populations and reduced hunting interest, however other interests soon emerged. Moist-soil agriculture, particularly root crop cultivation, provided incentive to drain surrounding lands and eventually the entire marsh. Despite these alterations, farming efforts failed and had ceased by the early 1920s due to the wet springs, heavy rains, and peat soil of Horicon Marsh.\n\nDevoid of water, stripped of wetland vegetation, ditched, tilled, and burned, the marsh was ecologically devastated. In 1921, several conservation-minded individuals began campaigning to restore the marsh. Six years later, the state legislature passed the Horicon Marsh Wildlife Refuge Bill, thereby establishing the state wildlife area. This action authorized dam construction to restore marsh water levels and permitted the acquisition of lands in and around the marsh. Although state funds only acquired one-third of the marsh, federal funds completed the acquisition and led to the establishment of Horicon National Wildlife Refuge in 1941.\n\nExisting topography/vegetation\n\nHoricon Marsh formed in the late Pleistocene period when a recessional moraine impounded glacial meltwaters. As its outlet eroded, this lake eventually drained and succeeded to an emergent marsh. Today, the agricultural landscape that surrounds Horicon Marsh contains the highest concentration of glacial drumlins in the world. The marsh measures 21 km long and up to 9 km wide and supports a robust aquatic plant community. Throughout the property, native and non-native emergents such as cat-tail, bur-reed, common reed, and reed canary grass are interspersed with open water to create hemi-marsh conditions. Vegetated islands, native and non-native grasslands, and hardwood forests on the property provide habitat for a diverse suite of nesting, foraging, and roosting bird species.\n\nCurrent management/land use\n\nHoricon Marsh was restored as an emergent marsh following attempts to drain it for agricultural production in the early twentieth century. Currently, the southern one-third of the marsh is a wildlife area managed by the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources and the northern two-thirds is a wildlife refuge managed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Surrounding uplands are in private ownership, largely in agricultural production with some residential development.\n\nA variety of management techniques are used to maintain emergent marsh conditions and thus benefit wetland-associated birds. Water level manipulations create habitat mosaics that support a diverse avifauna, including waterfowl, shorebirds, and waders. Drawdowns begin in early April and are timed so that migrant shorebirds benefit from the lowered water levels and exposed mudflats. At the Refuge, management units are drawn down for two years to control nuisance aquatic species, diversify plant composition within monotypic stands, and provide an abundant seed source. After the second growing season, water is slowly returned to the unit to coincide with the fall migratory period for shorebirds. Water level management in combination with physical removal, chemical eradication, and native predator introduction (i.e., northern pike) also has been instrumental in carp control and minimizing the ecological damage they cause.\n\nTo provide upland nesting habitat for waterfowl and grassland-associated species, Horicon Marsh restored degraded uplands by seeding prairie grasses and forbs native to Wisconsin and by removing tree lines that served as predator corridors. Mowing and prescribed burns are used to control invasive species encroachment in wetland, native prairie, and oak savanna habitats. Other invasive plant control techniques include biological and chemical control, cutting, pulling, mowing, and haying.\n\nImportance to Birds\n\nHoricon Marsh is the largest freshwater cat-tail marsh in the United States. It supports very high concentrations of Mallard, Blue-winged Teal, Gadwall, Northern Shoveler, Green-winged Teal, Ruddy Duck and other migrating ducks. Hundreds of thousands of Canada Geese migrate through the marsh annually, with peak numbers as high as 300,000 occurring in the fall. It also is a significant stopover site for Greater and Lesser Yellowlegs, Semipalmated Sandpiper, Least Sandpiper, Pectoral Sandpiper and other migrant shorebirds. Horicon Marsh hosts the largest breeding population of Redhead east of the Mississippi River as well as significant breeding populations of Least Bittern, American Bittern, King Rail, Forster’s Tern, and Black Tern. For many years, Fourmile and Cotton Islands hosted the largest Great Egret rookery in the state as well as Great Blue Heron and Black-crowned Night-Heron colonies. After nearly 50 years of use, these nesting colonies deteriorated due to natural causes. The Refuge still hosts a Black-crowned Night-Heron colony of approximately 500 birds and American White Pelican recently established nesting colonies on the Main Ditch spoil banks within Refuge boundaries.\n\nGrassland habitat in the surrounding uplands supports upland-nesting waterfowl such as Mallard and Blue-winged Teal and breeding passerines such as Sedge Wren, Henslow’s Sparrow, Bobolink, and Dickcissel. There is potential to expand these grassland tracts and improve conditions for area-sensitive species by restoring surrounding uplands degraded by agriculture or other anthropogenic activities. Horicon Marsh was designated a Wetland of International Importance under the Ramsar Convention in 1991, a Globally Important Bird Area in 2001, and a Wisconsin Important Bird Area in 2004.\n\nPriority Birds\n\nSpecies Opportunity Special Habitat Feature Canada Goose High Forages in open water areas.

Urban and agricultural runoff enters the marsh through various watershed tributaries and delivers excessive chemicals, nutrients, and sediments into the marsh. This diminishes water quality and can stimulate the germination and growth of dense vegetation, especially cat-tail. Cat-tails effectively take up phosphorus and thus have thrived in the nutrient-rich waters entering the marsh. Non-native carp are abundant and further reduce water quality and habitat diversity by roiling marsh sediments and uprooting aquatic plants. Invasive plant species including reed canary grass, common reed, wild parsnip, purple loosestrife, leafy spurge, common buckthorn, and garlic mustard form monotypic stands in some areas with little wildlife value.\n\nOther conservation issues have more direct impacts to Horicon’s avifauna. Overabundant native predators such as raccoon, opossum, and skunk as well as feral cats impact ground-nesting birds. Many species also are threatened by State Highway 49, a high-speed road that bisects the northern portion of the marsh for 4 kilometers. Bird species with the highest mortality rates include Canada Goose, Least Bittern, American Coot, and Red-winged Blackbird. Frogs, turtles, and muskrats also experience significant adverse impacts (B. Volkert, pers. comm.). The construction of a large wind energy generating facility approximately 2 kilometers from the Refuge poses some risk to bird populations. Cranes, shorebirds, raptors and other bird species commonly fly at relatively low altitudes from the marsh to nearby foraging areas, the proposed locations for turbines. Impacts to bird populations could be significant if a larger buffer zone is not implemented.\n\nManagement Recommendations\n\nRe-establish a natural water flow to the marsh by restoring natural water courses.\n\nContinue control of carp, purple loosestrife, and other invasive species through biological, chemical, and mechanical means.\n\nConduct water level manipulations to control cat-tail and diversify site conditions for a diverse suite of birds.\n\nCollaborate with partners in the Rock River watershed to reduce sediments and nonpoint pollutants in the marsh.\n\nExplore strategies to reduce or eliminate bird mortality from vehicle collisions on Highway 49.\n\nImplement a marshbird monitoring program to adequately measure abundance, distribution, population status, and habitat use at Horicon Marsh.\n\nContinue efforts to restore native prairie and oak savanna habitat adjacent to Horicon by brush and tree line removal, prescribed fire, mowing, and other appropriate management techniques.\n\nDetermine most effective season to conduct prescribed burns for cat-tail control.\n\nPartners\n\nFriends of Horicon Marsh International Education Center: http://www.horiconmarsh.org/\n\nFriends of Horicon National Wildlife Refuge: http://www.fws.gov/midwest/horicon/friends.html\n\nHoricon Marsh Bird Club: http://www.horiconmarshbirdclub.com\n\nRock River Coalition: http://rockrivercoalition.org\n\nU.S. Fish and Wildlife Service: http://www.fws.gov/\n\nWisconsin Department of Natural Resources: http://www.dnr.state.wi.us/\n\nInformation Sources\n\nHoricon National Wildlife Refuge Comprehensive Conservation Plan: http://www.fws.gov/midwest/planning/Horicon/index.html\n\nU.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Horicon page: http://www.fws.gov/midwest/horicon\n\nWisconsin Department of Natural Resources Horicon page: http://www.dnr.state.wi.us/land/wildlife/reclands/horicon\n\nWisconsin Important Bird Areas Horicon page: http://www.wisconsinbirds.org/iba/sites/horiconmarsh.htm\n\nInformation for this account was taken from:\n\nSteele, Y.
