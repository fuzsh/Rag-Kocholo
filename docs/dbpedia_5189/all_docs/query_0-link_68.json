        "text": "Matt Simpson was elected to the New York State Assembly on November 3, 2020. His district is comprised of Essex County, Warren County, and parts of Saratoga, Washington and Fulton counties.\n\nMatt firmly believes in putting his constituents interests first in order to prioritize making the community a better place for everyone. Throughout his first term as Assemblyman, he worked to rein in out-of-control spending, fought for lower taxes, eliminated burdensome unfunded mandates, and improved the state’s failing infrastructure. Matt will continue to advocate for better resources for law enforcement while making public safety a priority; protect the state’s vibrant state parks; gain financial support for local businesses; hold the government accountable for lack of transparency; and work to keep money in the pockets of hard working taxpayers.\n\nSimpson grew up in the North Country and was first elected to the public office in 2011 when he won a seat on the Horicon Town Board. Two years later, he was elected Town Supervisor where he served until his election to the Assembly.\n\nWhile Town Supervisor, he worked double duty by sitting on the Warren County Board of Supervisors. There, Matt served as Committee Chair of Public Works, Committee Chair of Personnel, Committee Vice Chair of Public Safety, and in a number of other capacities.\n\nHe was appointed to the Warren and Washington County IDA in 2015, and served as its Chair from 2018-2019. During that time, he oversaw many projects designed to advance the economic viability of the area.\n\nHis volunteer work includes serving as President of the Adirondack Association of Towns and Villages (AATV). The AATV represents more than 100 municipalities throughout the Adirondack Park. In his time there, he has worked alongside members of the New York State Assembly and Senate, as well as numerous environmental organizations like the Adirondack Counsel.\n\nPrior to public service, Matt was a small business owner for more than 30 years in the construction trades industry. There, he learned the value of having to roll up his sleeves and work until a job is done. Over the span of three decades, Matt also learned first-hand what goes into creating jobs, making payroll, and succeeding in growing a business in the North Country despite being faced with challenges."
