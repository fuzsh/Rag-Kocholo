On the other, you just want to be in the moment and enjoy, as you bike, birdwatch, paddle, ski or hike. Horicon Marsh is the largest freshwater cattail marsh in the U. S., and has been named a Wetland of International Importance by the United Nations. It’s often referred to as the “Everglades of the North”."
