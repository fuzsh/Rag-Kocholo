        "text": "These are the most common terms used within the U.S., although senior housing terminology may vary from state-to-state. We advise you to always check with individual facilities for specific senior living services offered and we recommend personal visits and reference checks. Many types of senior living facilities are rental apartments for seniors, but you may also find some communities where homes are bought and sold. We understand there are many choices and that choosing the right senior housing facility is important, so make sure to take advantage of the Resources for Seniors on SeniorHousingNet. Also try our Senior Care Assessment Tool if you are not sure which type of senior care is right for you or your loved one and learn about the various Types of Senior Housing.\n\nTo search for senior living and senior care, simply type a location into the search bar and select the types of care you are interested in. For example, if you are looking in your city for low-income senior housing communities that offer some personal assistance, type your city name, select \"Assisted Living\" and \"Low Income-Affordable\", and then click \"Search\". From there you will see listings of communities who offer assisted care and have senior housing for low income seniors. When you see a community you are interested in, click on the name, address or photo to see more details.\n\nYou can learn more about senior apartment communities when you:\n\nRead community descriptions\n\nBrowse photos and floor plans\n\nLearn about pricing, amenities and features\n\nContact the community to learn more\n\nStart your search for senior living right here on SeniorHousingNet.com and find a place to call home."
