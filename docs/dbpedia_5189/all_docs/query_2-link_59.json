        "text": "Horicon Marsh, the largest freshwater cattail marsh in the US, is one of the top birding destinations in the Midwest. The marsh provides habitat for endangered species and is a critical rest stop for thousands of migrating ducks and Canada geese. It is recognized as a Wetland of International Importance, as both Globally and State Important Bird Areas and is also a unit of the Ice Age Scientific Reserve. Spring and fall bring massive migrations of waterfowl, with nearly 500,000 birds stopping at the marsh to feed and rest on their way to warmer climates. During the summer, many species of birds remain in the marsh to breed and raise their young. Throughout the summer, heron, egrets and other shorebirds can be seen stalking the margins of the cattails. A birder’s paradise and one of the best birding areas in the entire Midwest region of the country.\n\nHoricon National Wildlife Refuge\n\n920‑387‑2658\n\nhttp://www.fws.gov/midwest/horicon/\n\nwww.horiconchamber.com\n\nwww.dodgecounty.com\n\nBrand new to the Education and Visitor’s Center is the Explorium. Did you ever want to know what it is like to step inside a glacier? Or experience what it might have felt like during the last Ice Age? A new exhibit at the Horicon Marsh is designed to do just that. A few steps inside the Explorium can take you back 10,000 years. “You get the feeling of it actually being cold, like you’re walking into a glacier,” said Liz Herzmann, Horicon Marsh Wildlife Educator. Herzmann says the chill in the air is for effect. “We even have smells of what a mammoth might smell like,” said Herzmann. The new Explorium exhibit takes a look at the history of the marsh, from the Ice Age, to the wetlands of today. “We lift these boards and it releases water, and that’s how we can drain some of the impoundments at the marsh,” said Herzmann as she demonstrated a water control structure. Tools of the trade are on display. People are asked to look, and touch. “One of our goals through the Explorium is to educate people about Horicon Marsh, but doing it in a way where they don’t know they’re learning,” said Herzmann. Park leaders say the experience is designed to go beyond the Explorium and the nature center. Visitors are encouraged to take what they learned inside, outside. “We have about five miles of hiking trails that go through different portions of the marsh. Those trails go through a variety of different habitats, wetlands of course, but also your prairies, and your forested areas that are around the marsh as well.” The $3.7 million project opened August 2015. http://fox11online.com/news/local/fox-cities/explorium-at-horicon-marsh-set-to-open\n\nThe Wild Goose State Trail runs for 34 miles along the western edge of the Horicon Marsh. The crushed limestone path runs along a former railroad grade, making the trail suitable for all types of bicycles. The trail runs from Fond du Lac to Clyman Junction. The trail is less than 2 miles outside of Horicon. Bicycling – Walking – Hiking – Jogging and Cross-Country Skiing are permitted year round on the main trail. Additional bicycling is available on county roads around the perimeter of the Horicon Marsh. Also many bike trails and cross country skiing trails are located throughout the Horicon Marsh. Dodge County Tourism\n\n800-414-0101\n\nwww.dodgecounty.com\n\nSnowmobile Use – Permitted on the main trail between December 1 and March 31 when conditions allow county officials to officially open the trail. No trail fee. For trail status call 920-386-3705\n\nRiver Bend Park 18 hole Disc Golf course in Horicon. Established in 2011, the River Bend Disc Golf Course is located in a beautiful park along the Rock River in Horicon. For more information go to:\n\nhttp://www.horiconphoenix.com/river-bend-disc-golf-course\n\nCrystal Lake Disc Golf Course is an 18 hole course located in Beaver Dam, Wisconsin, about 13 minutes from us. Most holes are around 200 feet, with the shortest being 148 and the longest at 350. Hills, trees, streams and a lake, make it an interesting and fun course. Each hole has both a “professional” and “amateur” tee-off.\n\nFor pictures and more information go to:\n\nhttps://www.cityofbeaverdam.com/\n\nThe glaciers that once covered Dodge County have sculpted a landscape ideal for auto touring. Several scenic overlooks around the Horicon Marsh allow you to view the wetland’s wildlife. Follow the brown signs that mark the route of the Horicon Marsh Parkway, a 50-mile auto tour that encircles the Horicon Marsh and follows state and county highways through Burnett, Kekoskee, Horicon, Mayville and Waupun. Another great trip is the Horicon Marsh Tern Pike. Located off Hwy 49 in the northwest portion of the marsh, this scenic drive winds throughout the wetlands and along dikes, allowing for great wildlife viewing\n\nHoneybee Inn is located at bottom of map. Look for North Palmatory Street, and we are two blocks west.\n\nwww.horiconmarsh.org\n\nJust 25 miles southeast of Horicon and located on the highest elevation in this part of the state; visible for miles in all directions, the spires of Holy Hill, National Shrine of Mary, soar into the sky. The Neo-Romanesque Church, completed in 1931, with priceless stained glass windows and magnificent mosaics, boasts a breath-taking view of the southern Kettle Moraine Countryside. During summer and fall, thousands climb the 178 steps to the top of the observation tower inside one of the church spires for an unparalleled glimpse of the dramatic surroundings and the skyline of Milwaukee on the horizon. Special seasonal events include a live nativity, uplifting concerts and a popular arts and crafts fair.\n\nHoly Hill is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and a state landmark. Open year round, free admission and parking. Picnic grounds, gift shop, cafeteria and gourmet bake shop.\n\nwww.holyhill.com\n\n262-628-1838"
