        "text": "About Horicon Island This is a gorgeous one campsite island covered in blueberry bushes with lots of great swimming. As it's a narrow island, the breeze crosses from east to west, which makes it less likely to be buggy. Horicon Island has two docks but only one tent site so it is a favorite with those looking for a picnic site. There is also a bay where boaters like to hang out right in front of the island, so although the island is out of the way, it's not completely secluded."
