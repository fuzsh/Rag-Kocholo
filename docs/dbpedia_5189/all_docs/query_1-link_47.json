        "text": "Explore Horicon Wildlife Refuge, the premier wetland in the Midwest, during the spring season when thousands of migrating birds pass through the area. Discover this Wetland of International Importance by car and on foot with experienced guides. As the largest freshwater cattail marsh in the United States, Horicon Marsh is home to over 260 bird species and other diverse wildlife.\n\nWe’ll visit the Wisconsin DNR Education and Visitor’s Center and travel to the north side of the marsh for the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service Auto Tour. We will have the opportunity to observe the birds which depend on this important habitat for their survival, including a variety of ducks, songbirds, secretive marsh birds, and raptors. Your guides for the day will be Director of Education Tom Finley and Adult Programs Coordinator Michelle Allison. Both are avid birders and have led numerous trips to the marsh.\n\nThe field trip begins and ends at Horicon Marsh. You will need to provide your own transportation to and from the Marsh and to the various locations during the trip. Please bring your own lunch/snacks. You’ll come away with a better understanding of local waterfowl, the importance of the wetland ecosystem and hone your identification skills. Further details and meeting location will be emailed to registered participants one week prior to the trip. No additional entrance fees are required at the marsh.\n\nMembers: $50 | Non-Members: $65"
