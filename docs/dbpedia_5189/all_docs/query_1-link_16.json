This birding paradise was first created by glacial activity in Wisconsin. Throughout the years, the area was inhabited by native tribes and then settled by hunters and farmers looking to make a living off of its rich water and land resources. Today the marshland area is restored to its original state and, as the United State’s largest cattail marsh, serves as a sanctuary for the wildlife of all kinds. Come weave your way through the marshlands, whether by hiking trails, boardwalks, a special ‘Ternpike’ auto tour road, or by paddling, and enjoy the natural beauty of the Horicon Marsh.\n\nAbout the Marsh\n\nThe Horicon Marsh & National Wildlife Refuge encompasses more than 30,000 total acres. The Horicon Marsh consists of two parts: the northern, larger portion of the Horicon National Wildlife Refuge and the Horicon Marsh State Wildlife Area to the south. The Horicon Marsh is also home to three visitor/nature centers: The Horicon Marsh Education & Visitors Center, located in Horicon, the Horicon National Wildlife Refuge Visitor Center, in Mayville, and the Marsh Haven Nature Center in Waupun.\n\nPlan Your Visit: Horicon Marsh Education & Visitors Center\n\nAddress: N7725 Highway 28, Horicon\n\nhoriconmarsh.org\n\nHours:\n\nMonday – Friday: 9 am – 4 pm\n\nSaturday – Sunday 10 am – 4 pm\n\nCLOSED Sundays in December through February\n\nExplorium:\n\nHours:\n\nMonday through Friday: 9 am – 4 pm\n\nSaturday & Sunday: 10 am – 4 pm\n\nClosed all major holidays\n\nAdmission:\n\nGeneral: $6\n\nChildren (5-17 years): $4\n\nChildren (4 and under): FREE\n\nSpecial Annual and other passes available\n\nBe sure to stop downstairs to check out the amazing Explorium! Here you and your kids will use sight, sound, smell, and touch to learn about the history of the marsh: how it was formed, how it was used, how it changed over the years, and how it is being preserved today.\n\nTips To Enjoy Your Visit With Little Ones: The Horicon Marsh Education & Visitors Center is an excellent place to begin your adventure with little ones. You can enjoy the indoor learning center area, gift shop, Explorium, and easily access the boardwalk (stroller friendly when not snow-covered) all from the Center.
