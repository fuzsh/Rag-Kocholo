        "text": "What is the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands?\n\nThe international Convention on Wetlands (known as the “Ramsar Convention”) is a non-regulatory, intergovernmental treaty that provides the framework for national action and international cooperation for the conservation and wise use of wetlands and their resources. The Ramsar Convention on Wetlands is an international convention first signed in Ramsar, Iran in 1971. The Ramsar convention encourages nations to promote wetland conservation and to designate of Wetlands of International Importance (“Ramsar sites”).\n\nThe United States is a Party to the Convention, and as such has committed to support the “three pillars” of the Convention, including ensuring the conservation and wise use of wetlands it has designated as Wetlands of International Importance. The U.S. has designated more than 40 sites within its borders as Wetlands of International Importance, including the Chesapeake Bay, the Everglades, and the Niagara River Corridor. Six of these sites are located in the state of Wisconsin: Horicon Marsh, Upper Mississippi River Floodplain Wetlands, Kakagon/Bad River Sloughs, Door Peninsula Coastal Wetlands, Chiwaukee Illinois Beach Lake Plain, and the recently designated Lower Wisconsin Riverway.\n\nA few key facts about Ramsar site designation:\n\nRamsar does not impose restrictions on nations and landowners, affect sovereignty rights, or act as a regulating entity or a UN convention.\n\nSite designation is voluntary (land is only included if the landowner expressly requests to be included).\n\nSite designation is entirely non-regulatory and does not supersede local ownership and management authority.\n\nHoricon Marsh\n\nThis site is one of the largest intact freshwater wetlands in the United States and also one of the largest cattail marshes in the world. It is an important staging area for numerous species of migratory birds, especially Canadian geese and mallards. In the fall, 80% of the Mississippi Flyway population of Canada geese (around 1.1 million birds) and 2% of the regional population of mallards use this site during their migration.\n\nRamsar Sites Information Service page\n\n2020 Wetland Coffee Break presentation by Liz Herzmann\n\nWisconsin Wetlands Association Wetland Gems® factsheet\n\nKakagon/Bad River Sloughs\n\nThis site is a largely undeveloped wetland complex composed of sloughs, bogs, and coastal lagoons that harbor the largest natural wild rice bed on the Great Lakes. The area is under tribal management that is protected as a Conservation Area by an Integrated Resource Management Plan under the jurisdiction of the Bad River Band of the Lake Superior Tribe of Chippewa. It provides necessary and rare feeding, resting, and nesting habitat for both migrating and local populations of birds. Access to the area is strictly limited to Bad River tribal members and Bad River Natural Resources staff.\n\nRamsar Sites Information page\n\n2020 Wetland Coffee Break presentation by Naomi Tillison\n\nWisconsin Wetlands Association Wetland Gems® factsheet\n\nLower Wisconsin Riverway\n\nThis site covers the longest free-flowing stretch of river in the Midwest and includes nearly 44,000 acres of land from the Prairie du Sac Dam to the confluence with the Mississippi River. The Riverway is one of Wisconsin’s most significant conservation and recreational areas because of its relatively wild, continuous natural area with a wide variety of native plant-animal communities. Its sloughs and marshes, forested bottomlands, sand terraces, and bluff tops harbor many animal and plant species (some of them rare and threatened) and diverse and rich communities.\n\nRamsar Sites Information Service page\n\n2020 Wetland Coffee Break presentation by Mark Cupp (social history)\n\n2020 Wetland Coffee Break presentation by Mike Mossman (ecology)\n\nWisconsin Wetlands Association Wetland Gems® factsheet"
