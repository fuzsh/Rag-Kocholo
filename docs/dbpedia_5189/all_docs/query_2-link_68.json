        "meta_description": "Horicon, Wisconsin is a modern, progressive city with a population of nearly 4,000. It is favorably located by nature and man on both sides of the Rock River at the southern fringe of the Horicon Marsh. Encompassing 32,000 acres, Horicon Marsh is the largest freshwater cattail marsh in the US. This marsh is also a restoration project, having been ditched and drained for agriculture in the early 1900’s. The marsh is divided into two units. The southern one-third is a State Wildlife Area managed by the Wisconsin DNR. The northern two-thirds is a National Wildlife Refuge administered by the USFWS. While the marsh is primarily managed as a waterfowl area it hosts a tremendous variety of other birds. This marsh is perhaps best known for the spring and fall migration of Canada geese which often number more than 200,000 birds.",

Encompassing 32,000 acres, Horicon Marsh is the largest freshwater cattail marsh in the US.

Since these early origins, it has been home to an abundant variety of fish, birds, and other marshland wildlife. Evidence indicates that man was already here when this marsh was in its infancy. Over the years, more than 265 species have been sighted here and this marsh regularly attracts some of Wisconsin’s rarest birds. Being a National Wildlife Refuge, public access is limited in this portion of the marsh in order to protect the wildlife for which it has been established. Most of the state area is open to the public. One of the best ways to explore this area is by canoe or shallow draft boat, but please be aware of restricted use and closed areas."
