        "text": "Bird enthusiasts can experience the sights, sounds and natural beauty of birds in peak spring migration as the Horicon Marsh Bird Club hosts the 21st annual Bird Festival at Horicon Marsh Education and Visitor Center May 10-14.\n\nFrom the backyard birder to the world traveler, four days of adventure await by foot, boat, bus and bicycle at Horicon Marsh, one of the largest freshwater marshes in the United States. The Horicon Marsh Bird Festival is the oldest bird festival in Wisconsin.\n\nHighlights of this year’s Bird Festival include a keynote speech from birder and humorist Al Batt; ‘Mom and Me, Birding Together’, a beginner’s guide to birding (and a great way to spend some time with mom on Mother’s Day) and bird banding demonstrations by Dr. Sheldon Cooper from UW-Oshkosh.\n\nThe Birding by Bicycle guided tour invites birders to peddle their way through the area. A Birdy Scavenger Hunt offers a unique way to explore the Marshes scenic views, sounds and enjoyment.\n\nAt over 33,000 acres, Horicon Marsh provides habitat for endangered species and is a critical rest stop for thousands of migrating songbirds and waterfowl. It is recognized as a Wetland of International Importance and as Globally and State Important Bird Areas. More than 300 bird species are on the Horicon Marsh checklist.\n\nThe festival begins with an Early Bird Bus Tour. Popular favorites include the Hot Spot Birding Bus Tour, Beginners Bird Hike, Birding Adventure Boat Tour, and 20+ other tours and activities planned by the Horicon Marsh Bird Club.\n\nFor the early morning birder, First Light Birding offers a glimpse of the birds at sunrise. At sunset, a Night Sounds Bus Tour is offered. Throughout the festival, the Horicon National Wildlife Refuge Visitor Center, Marsh Haven Nature Center and Horicon Marsh Education and Visitor Center will be buzzing with interactive displays, programs, and opportunities for viewing birds at their observation areas.\n\nTo plan your birding adventure, visit www.horiconmarshbirdclub.com (exit DNR) and click on the Bird Festival link for a complete list of events, descriptions and registration information. For additional registration information, contact Liz Herzmann, DNR wildlife conservation educator, at 920-387-7893.\n\nMany tours require advanced registration and fees and spaces are filling up fast. Partners for this event include the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Marsh Haven Nature Center, Horicon Marsh Boat Tours, Friends of Horicon National Wildlife Refuge, and Friends of Horicon Marsh Education and Visitor Center."
