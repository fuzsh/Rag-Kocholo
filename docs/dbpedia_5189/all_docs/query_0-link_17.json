You get to it by Exit 25 to Route 8, then head east a short way until you cross the Schroon River on an old style steel superstructure bridge. The lake itself is over 9 miles long and has been a popular tourist and summer destination for over a century. It has four summer camps along the lake, including a Boy Scout camp. The actual hamlet of Brant Lake is on a sluice gate controlled pond at the west end of the lake."
