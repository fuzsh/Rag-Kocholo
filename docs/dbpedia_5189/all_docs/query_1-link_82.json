        "text": "THE PHYSICAL CACHE IS NOT LOCATED WITHIN THE FEDERAL BOUNDARIES OF THE MARSH\n\nThis is a 5 location multi stop cache. The stops encircle the marsh with great views. It may take you a few hours to complete this cache!\n\nThe Horicon Marsh is the largest freshwater cattail marsh in the United States. Located in southeast Wisconsin, this vast wetland is only one hour drive from Milwaukee and Madison. While this marsh in renown for its migrant flocks of Canada geese, it is also home to more than 260 kinds of birds which have been sighted over the years.\n\nHoricon is a migratory stop-over for the geese. Each fall, in October and November, tens of thousands of Canada geese leave their Canadian breeding grounds and head for Horicon Marsh where they stop for several weeks. In spring, they are on the marsh from late February or early March until mid-April. The marsh is a staging area that provides important spring food which will fuel their journey north and supply the energy for reproduction. Over the years, their average departure date from the marsh has been around April 21. It is the increasing daylight hours which stimulate the spring migration. From here, they migrate to their northerly breeding grounds, near Hudson Bay. They arrive on their breeding grounds around the end of April or beginning of May and begin to nest as soon as melting snow makes nesting sites available.\n\nFind the clues and enter the values for the coordinates given\n\nLOCATION #1: N43 27.852 W088 37.409\n\nLocate the sign describing the area.
