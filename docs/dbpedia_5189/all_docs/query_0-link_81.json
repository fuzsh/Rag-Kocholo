The numbers are not a specific count of immigrants in each community, yet the changes in Hispanic and Asian populations shown by the data are largely driven by immigration. Figures seen here were compiled as part of the Federal “Common Core Data” on school districts, and obtained by the New York Times from the National Center for Education Statistics. In some cases, The Times obtained additional information from state and local education agencies to fill in gaps for missing figures, but generally, the information is presented here as provided by the government. In a handful of districts, particularly in early years, figures may be missing, misreported or not allotted by race."
