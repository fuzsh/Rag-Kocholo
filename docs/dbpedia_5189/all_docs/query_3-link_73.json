        "text": "Wisconsin is a state in the Upper Midwestern region of the United States with an area of a little under 170,000 km2 (54,000 square miles). It borders Minnesota to the west, Iowa to the southwest, Illinois to the south, Lake Michigan to the east, Michigan to the northeast, and Lake Superior to the north. Wisconsin is the 25th-largest state by land area and the 20th-most populous. The bulk of Wisconsin’s population live in areas situated along the shores of Lake Michigan. The largest city, Milwaukee, anchors its largest metropolitan area with around 1.5 million people, followed by the state capital, Madison, which is the fastest-growing city in the state, followed by Green Bay and Kenosha. Wisconsin is divided into 72 counties and has a population of nearly 6 million people.\n\nWith its location between the Great Lakes and the Mississippi River, Wisconsin is home to a wide variety of geographical features. The state is divided into five distinct regions. In the north, the Lake Superior Lowland occupies a belt of land along Lake Superior. Just to the south, the Northern Highland has massive mixed hardwood and coniferous forests including the 1,500,000-acre (610,000-hectare) Chequamegon-Nicolet National Forest, as well as thousands of glacial lakes, and the state’s highest point, Timms Hill. In the middle of the state, the Central Plain has some unique sandstone formations like the Dells of the Wisconsin River in addition to rich farmland. The Eastern Ridges and Lowlands region in the southeast is home to many of Wisconsin’s largest cities. The ridges include the Niagara Escarpment that stretches from New York, the Black River Escarpment and the Magnesian Escarpment. The state’s boundaries include the Mississippi River and St. Croix River in the west, and the Menominee River in the northeast. In the southwest, the Western Upland is a rugged landscape with a mix of forest and farmland, including many bluffs on the Mississippi River. Overall, 46% of Wisconsin’s land area is covered by forest.\n\nDevils Lake State Park – ©Yinan Chen Public Domain via Wikimedia Commons\n\nWisconsin is one of the nation’s leading dairy producers and is known as ‘America’s Dairyland’; it is particularly famous for its cheese. The state is also famous for its beer, particularly and historically in Milwaukee, most notably as the headquarters of the Miller Brewing Company. Wisconsin has some of the most permissive alcohol laws in the country and is well known for its drinking culture. Its economy is dominated by manufacturing, healthcare, information technology, and agriculture—specifically dairy, cranberries, and ginseng. Tourism is also a major contributor to the state’s economy.[ Most of Wisconsin is classified as warm-summer humid continental climate, while southern and southwestern portions are classified as hot-summer humid continental climate. Wisconsin also receives a large amount of regular snowfall averaging around 40 inches (100 cm) in the southern portions with up to 160 inches (410 cm) annually in the Lake Superior snowbelt each year.\n\nBirding Wisconsin\n\nWhile Wisconsin lacks the scenic grandeur of the west and the notoriety of the east, it does contain variety and surprises that few states can match. It’s a place where boreal forests of the north meet hardwood forests of the east and the grasslands of the west. Rough dimensions of the state are 300 miles north & south by 150 miles east & west. The northern third of the state contains thousands of lakes surrounded by forests of White Pine, Hemlock, Maple, and Yellow Birch. These lakes provide nesting areas for Bald Eagle, Osprey, and Common Loon (Great Northern Diver). The western boundary is the Mississippi River and its associated wetlands and bottomland forests. The eastern boundary is Lake Michigan with its sandy shores. The latter two serve as major flyways for numerous migratory birds… ducks, swans, raptors, and passerines.\n\nWhile more than 400 species have been observed in Wisconsin, a more realistic number to shoot for in a given year would be 300. This of course would require lots of driving to find rarities. Warblers are high on the most-desired list for birders in Wisconsin; with over 30 species occurring and over 20 species nesting in the state. Warblers such as Kentucky, Cerulean, Prothonotary, and Yellow-throated can be observed in the southern part of the state, especially along the Mississippi River in places like Wyalusing State Park. While the north woods are home to Blackburnian, Cape May, Northern Parula, Nashville, Canada, and Magnolia. The peak time for warbler watching is the first two to three weeks in May.\n\nOther highlights include wintering Bald Eagles along the Mississippi and Wisconsin Rivers. Where dams keep the water open, eagles can easily be observed. Sauk Prairie along the Wisconsin River and Cassville along the Mississippi are consistently good during the winter. Waterfowl migrations along the Mississippi River. Each Spring and Fall, thousands of geese and ducks pass through. Most impressive are the thousands of Tundra Swans that congregate along the Mississippi in October and November. Good spots to observe the Swans are Rieck’s Lake in Alma and Trempealeau National Wildlife Refuge north of La Crosse. Horicon Marsh is the largest freshwater cattail marsh in the country. Hundreds of thousands of geese and ducks pass through here each spring and fall. In addition, several species of ducks along with herons, egrets, bitterns, and rails nest here.\n\nThe recommended guidebook is Wisconsin’s Favorite Bird Haunts published by the Wisconsin Society for Ornithology. The revised fifth edition (2009), contains detailed descriptions with maps of birding hotspots in every county of the state and is archived on their website."
