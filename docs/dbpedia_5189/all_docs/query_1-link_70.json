        "text": "Birdwatching is one of the most beloved springtime activities in Wisconsin. There are plenty of places to enjoy the annual spring migration of birds in the nearby Kettle Moraine State Forest, but one of our favorite birdwatching destinations is the Horicon National Wildlife Refuge. The Horicon National Wildlife Refuge encompasses the northern two-thirds of the famed Horicon Marsh, the country’s largest freshwater cattail marsh.\n\nThe Horicon National Wildlife Refuge is one of the best birdwatching destinations in the state, and it’s also a wonderful place to enjoy some hiking, canoeing, kayaking, and biking. It’s only 30 minutes from our Wisconsin Bed and Breakfast, too, which makes it an easy day trip into nature for couples who are enjoying a romantic getaway with us.\n\nHidden Serenity Bed and Breakfast is a top-rated romantic getaway in Wisconsin. Our motto is for guests to “find adventure, return to comfort, and come away refreshed.” To this end, we offer exceptional hospitality, including a freshly made breakfast each morning of your stay and concierge service throughout. Our attention to detail sets us apart as one of the best places to stay in Wisconsin. If you’re ready to get out and explore this spring, it’s time to book a room at our Wisconsin Bed and Breakfast.\n\nVisit the Horicon National Wildlife Refuge This Spring\n\nBirdwatching is a great way to get out and enjoy the gradual emergence of spring. Though you can sit back, relax, and enjoy birdwatching just about anywhere – including at our Inn – it’s even better when you go to places like the Horicon National Wildlife Refuge.\n\nIn total, the Horicon National Wildlife Refuge encompasses 22,000 acres of marsh and woodland habitat – and it’s this vast expanse of protected lands that makes it such a prime birdwatching destination. There’s a broad diversity of birds and wildlife that call the Horicon National Wildlife Refuge home, including marsh-loving birds like ducks, geese, pelicans, herons, egrets, cormorants, and more. Migrating songbirds love the surrounding woodlands, too, and add some delightful character to the Horicon Marsh each spring and fall as they move through the area.\n\nOver the years, more than 300 species of birds have been observed at the Horicon National Wildlife Refuge – but they aren’t the only wildlife worth seeing here. Keep your eyes open, and you’ll also see plenty of other wildlife, including white-tailed deer, muskrats, mink, and river otters.\n\nThough birdwatching is the prime draw to the Horicon National Wildlife Refuge, there are other great things to do here. There are five miles of hiking trails through Horicon National Wildlife Refuge, including a 1,400-foot accessible boardwalk. Cyclists can also enjoy the Horicon National Wildlife Refuge as they move through the area. The Wild Goose State Trail passes along the western edge of the marsh.\n\nFor a unique experience and an up-close view of these protected habitats, consider renting a canoe or kayak and paddling around the Horicon Marsh Canoe Trail. There are also guided boat tours offered seasonally from early May through mid-October. Finally, now is a great time to plan to attend the upcoming Horicon Marsh Bird Festival, which will be held May 6 – 8, 2022. Visitors will enjoy guided birding hikes, bus tours and paddles, bird-banding demos, and special exhibits throughout the festival.\n\nThe Best Place to Stay Near Horicon Marsh\n\nThough the Horicon National Wildlife Refuge offers some of the best birdwatching in the state of Wisconsin, it’s certainly not the only place to see some of the state’s most colorful inhabitants. You can also enjoy plenty of birdwatching while relaxing at our beautiful Wisconsin Bed and Breakfast.\n\nOur Inn is nestled quietly in the forest, with wooded trails throughout the property for you to enjoy. We offer binoculars and guides for our guests, too, so you can get to know the birds that frequent our Inn. When you’re not outside enjoying our natural surroundings, you’ll find yourself comfortably lounging in our luxury guest rooms or common areas or savoring a relaxing treatment in our spa."
