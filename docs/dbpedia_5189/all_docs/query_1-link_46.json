        "text": "I just returned from a few family events in Wisconsin and want to share some of the summer beauty of the Horicon Marsh. It is an expansive protected wetland filled with wild wonders.\n\nWith 32,000 acres (130 square km), it is the largest freshwater cattail marsh in the United States, located in southeast Wisconsin. I am fortunate to have family and friends who live in the area and have returned numerous summers.\n\nA National Wildlife Refuge and Ramsar Wetland Site, it was created by glacial activity during the Pleistocene Ice Age.\n\nMore info Horicon Marsh Wikipedia\n\nThese shallow waters are attractive to herons, terns, and cranes, while the reeds and cattails are alive with an impressive variety of songbirds.\n\nWe watched these American white pelicans cooperative feeding. Brown pelicans dive for fish, but the white pelicans do not–they hunt by corralling the fish as seen here.\n\nFrogs, turtles and insects decorated the scene.\n\nThe summertime marsh is also home to the sandhill crane.\n\nThe refuge has narrow roads open to the public and a slow drive yields many close-up looks.\n\nThere is a recently built visitor center, too, and nearby boardwalks offer intimate views inside the marsh reeds. There are adjacent woods and meadows as well.\n\nIn the woods we discovered this hidden yellow warbler, below, protecting her nest.\n\nLong ago glacial activity also produced prairies. A common road near the marsh–one that locals use daily on their way to and from home–presents a vast prairie.\n\nThis is a photo of the prairie in June, below. Under that is a photo of a dapper denizen of the prairie.\n\nWildlife-filled waters, woods, meadows and prairies–it’s a dazzling place for outdoor enthusiasts to spend summer days.\n\nWritten by Jet Eliot.\n\nPhotos by Athena Alexander.\n\nOne of the largest freshwater marshes in the United States, Horicon Marsh offers a plethora of wildlife. Located in the southeastern quadrant of Wisconsin, U.S.A., and covering 32,000 acres (12,949 ha), the marsh is a critical rest stop for migrating birds.\n\nWikipedia Horicon Marsh.\n\nI love the solitude and beauty of this marsh, have written posts outlining how it was shaped: first by the glaciers, then by humans. But today I’m focusing just on the wildlife, because this is what I find so enchanting.\n\nPreviously written post: Horicon Marsh\n\nOne of the most elegant terns on earth, the black tern migrates to North America from South America, and breeds at the Horicon Marsh, as well as other sites in northern U.S. and Canada.\n\nForster’s terns also breed at the Horicon Marsh.\n\nTrumpeter Swans nest here too. This bird nearly went extinct, but has had a successful reintroduction. In 1933, there were fewer than 70 trumpeters living; today there are approximately 46,000 (Wikipedia).\n\nAnd cranes! There are only two crane species in North America, and I’ve seen them both here at this marsh. There are few places of which this can be said.\n\nIn summer, sandhill cranes can often be seen at the marsh or in nearby fields, most often in pairs. The wild whooping cranes, however, were a rare sighting; they are an endangered species.\n\nIn 1941 there were only 21 wild whooping cranes in existence. It has a been a long, hard struggle for this beautiful bird; but in 2015 the count was up to 603 individuals (including 161 captives) (Wikipedia).\n\nDragonflies abound, box turtles, butterflies, and over 300 species of birds.\n\nMarsh birds are prevalent, like Canada geese, ducks, and herons.\n\nRed-winged blackbirds, a healthy marsh staple, were everywhere; and one special siting that lasted about ten seconds: a yellow-headed blackbird.\n\nAlso saw numerous American White Pelicans. Wisconsinites are happy about the come-back of this bird. The pelicans were absent for about one hundred years, probably due to over-hunting. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife estimated, in 2002, that the Horicon Marsh numbers had risen to about 1,200 white pelicans.\n\nIt was a thrill to see several muskrats (locals call them “muskies”), especially the one that climbed out of the water–wonderful to see the whole body.\n\nMarshes were once thought of as wasteland because they were not commercially enterprising. Part of the Horicon Marsh history includes those periods too, destruction and failed developments.\n\nFortunately residents and environmentalists changed that, saw its value, and preserved 32,000 acres. Today the benefits of wetlands are more widely known; they help moderate global climate conditions and play an integral role in watershed ecology. They also provide a productive ecosystem for countless living organisms.\n\nHow lucky for us.\n\nAll photos by Athena Alexander (except where noted)\n\nThe largest freshwater cattail marsh in the United States, Horicon Marsh covers 32,000 acres (12,949 ha).\n\nApproximately 10,000 years ago it was shaped by the Wisconsin glacier during the Pleistocene era. When the glacier receded, it left debris which re-shaped the area, eventually forming this marsh.\n\nIn unique cooperative management, this large wetland preserve is owned and managed by both state and federal governments.\n\nIt is also a Ramsar Site–a member of an international organization devoted to conserving the earth’s wetlands and the sustainable use of their resources.\n\nWetlands are vital to human survival for providing water and biological diversity for our plants and animals. In past centuries it has been common for wetlands across the world to be filled in for development purposes.\n\nIn 1971 this degrading trend was addressed at the Ramsar Convention, by the signing of an international treaty established by UNESCO. Today we have 2,231 Ramsar sites in the world protecting 531,118,440 acres (214,936,005 ha) of wetlands. More Ramsar wetland info here.\n\nHaving grown up in the Horicon Marsh area, I am well aware it hasn’t always been a peaceful preserve filled with protected wildlife like it is today.\n\nOver the centuries the marsh has been milled, dammed, undammed, drained, burned, and ignored. Ducks were hunted to devastation.\n\nOver the years conservationists struggled and fought to return the Horicon Marsh to its natural wetland origin. But each new generation had industrious and prosperous plans for it, rather than let it remain a swampy marsh, something they considered at the time to be useless.\n\nFinally in July of 1941, conservationists won the battle and the Horicon National Wildlife Refuge was established. In 1990 it was designated a Ramsar site.\n\nToday it is a paradise of protected birds and wildlife boasting 304 bird species; and numerous species of wetland mammals, reptiles, and amphibians.\n\nMore Horicon Marsh info here.\n\nOn a recent visit, every day I witnessed songbirds and waterfowl tending their nests, heard native frogs rhythmically bellow, saw turtles on logs basking in the sun. The area was loaded with birds, including sandhill cranes ambling through the surrounding fields with their families.\n\nMost prevalent was the classic wetland sound: the fluty and constant trills of the red-winged blackbird.\n\nPerhaps they were singing about the success and glory of this natural wetland.\n\nPhoto credit: Athena Alexander\n\nYellow warblers are a sunshine-bright New World warbler. They frequent willow and cottonwood thickets near streams, swamps, and marshes.\n\nOn a recent Sunday I was on the trails of the Horicon Marsh (Wisconsin) at dawn, following the warbler’s subtle seet calls, hopeful to set eyes on this cheerful songbird.\n\nA widespread bird, at this time of year Setophaga petechia are busy breeding in almost all of North America. They winter in Central America and parts of South America, and migrate to North America in warm months.\n\nSee migration map below.\n\nTheir diet consists mainly of insects–moths, spiders, mosquitoes, mayflies, etc.\n\nIn the marshy thickets they prefer, they are busy snagging mosquitoes, and hovering underneath leaves foraging among spider webs.\n\nIn spite of their glaring bright color, these small birds (about five inches [12.7 cm] long) can be difficult to spot, due to their quick, flitting behavior, and surrounding thick foliage.\n\nWith 35 subspecies, some species have a slightly different physical appearance depending on the male in breeding. The name consequently changes too. The yellow warbler in Belize for instance, pictured here, is known there as the mangrove warbler.\n\nMore warbler info here.\n\nWhile walking, I was alerted to the high-pitched chip (“seet”) sound. I stayed focused on this sound, ignoring whining mosquitoes (best I could) and other flutey bird song.\n\nThere’s a mnemonic phrase that birders memorize for this warbler, and I heard it in the swampy woods. It sounds (sort of) like the bird is saying, “sweet sweet sweet I’m so sweet.”\n\nAnd they are so sweet…so I continued down the trail getting closer to the song.\n\nThen she fluttered into my periphery and disappeared; appeared again, and vanished. I knew I was close, so I stood back a few feet and waited.\n\nThis time she perched on a nearby branch, looked around. I noticed she wasn’t hunting. Parents usually exhibit this behavior to make sure a predator isn’t watching. Then she disappeared into an inconspicuous nest.\n\nI was so excited to have spotted her nest, watched intently. In this quiet little patch of forest, hidden in a tiny, neat cup of dried grass, warbler eggs were being carefully protected.\n\nTwo days later I was in the airport waiting for my delayed flight, surrounded by the noise, chaos, and crowds that is air travel in the summertime.\n\nI sat thinking about the yellow warbler…that sweet and quiet yellow warbler mother, and her heroic and successful efforts to keep her brood safe.\n\nPhoto credit: Athena Alexander\n\nI had the fortune of spending the past few days all around the Horicon Marsh, a vast wetland in southeastern Wisconsin. Right now they are just beginning their summer and it’s an ongoing jubilee of outdoor joys after a frozen, frigid winter. I like the Horicon Marsh for three reasons.\n\n1. I’m a birder, and this 32,000 acre wetland boasts 300 species of birds. Joining this muskrat (a “muskie”) and Canada Geese pictured here are raptors, cranes, owls, songbirds, waterfowl, reptiles and other mammals. Every May they have a bird festival hosting hundreds of birders for the spring migration of numerous species.\n\n2. I like this marsh for its history. There were mistakes made along the way, but the land and its people have co-evolved to create this successful ecosystem. You can walk along the paths as terns silently fly overhead and red-winged blackbirds deliver their melodic liquid burbling, hidden rails squawk in the cattails while chiggers quietly munch on your ankles.\n\nThe area is the result of glacial formation during the last Ice Age many, many years ago. There were nomadic hunters, prehistoric Indian cultures, then Native American tribes, then white settlers. Closer to our time, in the mid-1800s a dam was built, flooding the marsh, creating a large man-made lake. A few decades later, controversy ensued and the dam was destroyed. When the dam was torn down the marsh habitat was restored, with that came an influx of ducks and geese.\n\nSo the ducks and geese began congregating again in the Horicon Marsh, much to the delight of the local residents. It was the late 1800s and early 1900s and the wildlife had returned to what was feared to be destined as a wasteland. The wildlife came back and began once again to multiply, the people were elated. What happened next? Hunting was unregulated and hunters wiped out all the ducks and geese!\n\nBack to a wasteland. Around 1910 they dredged the marsh since there was no life left, prepared it for agriculture. But farming failed. Next the land turned into peat moss and it caught fire and burned and burned until there was nothing left again. Another period of being a wasteland, until 1921 when conservationists pushed through some laws and regulations.\n\nToday it is the opposite of a wasteland; it is a wetland managed both as a national refuge and a state refuge. The largest cattail marsh in the United States, it is home to abundant wildlife and appreciative humans. There are duck hunters here, and much of the marsh is funded by them, but there is also regulation and conservation. Hunters, wildlife conservationists, Packer fans and dairy farmers…we all learned how to get along together. This marsh turned into a success story.\n\n3. I like the Horicon Marsh because I was born here. I have memories of my father and his kin and friends hunting ducks, duck for dinner, decoys in the garage. The summers were thick with mosquitoes and one of our childhood thrills was running after the “spray trucks” that blew giant plumes of insecticide in our faces. (imagine!) There was an annual festival every summer called “Marsh Days.” The parade had dozens and dozens of contingents, many of the floats decorated with cattails and duck decoys. We always knew that summer was coming to an end when the honking chorus of geese began, the sky was filled with v-shaped lines of geese beginning their migration.\n\nMarsh habitat all over this country has declined, but I have witnessed the Horicon Marsh as a thriving place of wonderment for a half century. It’s not to say there aren’t current problems, because with more people come more problems; but this marsh, this beautiful brackish expanse of water and weeds, is not going away.\n\nPhoto credit: Athena Alexander"
