Franklin D. Miller, who won the Medal of Honor in the Vietnam War for single-handedly repulsing an attack on his patrol after he had been shot in the chest, died June 30 in Florida. He was 55 and lived in St. Pete Beach, Fla.

The cause was cancer, his family said.

In addition to receiving the Medal of Honor, the nation's highest award for valor, Mr. Miller was awarded the Silver Star, two Bronze Stars, the Air Medal and six Purple Hearts in four years in combat, prompting Gen. Henry H. Shelton, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, to call him ''an icon to what service in the armed forces is about.''

But when Mr. Miller was sent to Vietnam in 1966, he hardly seemed destined to have his portrait hanging in the Hall of Heroes at the John F. Kennedy Special Warfare Center and School at Fort Bragg, N.C.

Mr. Miller, a native of Elizabeth City, N.C., was a private first class in training with the Special Forces, popularly known as the Green Berets, when he received his orders for Vietnam.

''One day I was the dining room orderly, and the night before I'd been running around all night, so when I thought no one would miss me, I went up to the barracks and I fell sound asleep,'' he recalled in an interview in 1998 with an Army publication at Fort Bragg.

''The first people to wake me up were the company commander and the first sergeant, who were inspecting the billets. The first sergeant said, 'You can take your punishment from me, or you can go see the old man.' I'd never been in trouble before so I said I'd go see the old man. I figured he would just chew me out. He said, 'We've got your reassignment orders to Vietnam.' ''
