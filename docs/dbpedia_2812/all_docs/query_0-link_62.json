        "text": "Mullen now works as a civilian for the U.S. Department of Defense. Still in the civil engineering field, he serves in a supervisory capacity alongside his old squadron at Mountain Home Air Force Base. Mullen not only supports active duty servicemembers but also retirees from our armed forces. For the past 16 years, he has been a member of the American Legion and has served in a number of positions for Post 101, including his current position of Commander of the post. He helped create the American Legion Off Road Riders, which is a program for any Legion, Legion Auxiliary or Sons of the American Legion member to take their off-road vehicles or toys and spread word of the work the Legion does for Idaho’s veterans. He and fellow members of Post 101 also created the Armed Forces Ride, where they were able to raise $20 thousand in four years for programs such as Veterans in Need and Children and Youth.\n\nIn 1945, Bud flew his PBY into intense hostile fire to rescue a downed B-26 bomber crew. Directing the plane two miles on water, he and his eight man crew rescued all six bomber crewman with no casualties. Despite his PBY then being overweight and damaged, he was able to take off, fly in pitch darkness and, navigating by the stars, safely landed on their island base 500 miles away. For that feat, the head of the Air Force, General George Kenney, awarded him the highest pilot award in WWII--the Air Medal. Lt. Hayes’ action is referenced in Navy texts on air sea rescue.\n\nAt the end of the war 1945, while retrieving an Army reconnaissance unit off the Culasi, Panay Philippines coast, Lt. Hayes’ PBY was hit by a rogue wave, and broke apart. The cockpit containing him, co-pilot, Lt. Jack Leonard and one solider sank and perished. Efforts were unsuccessful in recovery. Lt. Hayes did not return from overseas and is still classified as Missing in Action.\n\nRetired veteran Darryl L. Heisey: Sergeant First Class (SFC) Darryl Heisey served in the United States Army from 1982 to July 2002. “The Army was always a calling in my life, the opportunity to serve my country as my father did in the Navy and my Uncles on my mom’s side in each branch of service,” SFC Heisey says. A man committed to his faith, SFC Heisey said he wanted to serve God, and thus a career as Army Chaplain Activities Specialist was the perfect match. He served as Military Drill Corporal directly after Basic Training at Fort Dix, New Jersey. SFC Heisey then attended Advanced Individual Training at Fort Monmouth, New Jersey, at the United States Army Chaplain Center and School. He later served at Fort Richardson, Alaska, where he says he “learned the value of warm feet and mental toughness in minus zero temperatures.” He became the first Sergeant for his class and considers graduating Air Assault was one of the greatest highlights of his service in the Army. He returned to Fort Monmouth, New Jersey, after time in Fort Carson, Colorado. Once promoted to SFC, Heisey trained new and transferred Chaplains in the basics of military drill and ceremony and taught them the basics of military drill and navigation to get from one point to another using a variety of sources, including map, redlight and compass. His final stint in the Army led him to Fort Huachuca, Arizona, where he worked with the Command Chaplain for all of the Army Signal Command. In that capacity, he traveled to many places overseas. He retired from service shortly after the September 11, 2001, attacks. He has received numerous awards and decorations, including Meritorious Service Medals, Army Commdendation Medals, Army Achievement Medals, among many more. After his retirement, SFC Heisey moved to Idaho, where he served as a Veteran Service Officer (VSO) in Kootenai County and State Veteran Service Officer for 16 years. He says these experiences were “life changing” by being able to help many fellow veterans by the work he conducted on a daily basis. “Helping Veterans with VA claims is a challenge and a blessing,” he says. He shared a detailed, heartwarming story with my office about navigating the VA benefits process for a WWII veteran in Kootenai County. “If you are a veteran and you have not asked about VA benefits . . . you need to call your local State Veteran or County Service Officer so they can explain ALL the benefits you have earned because of your military service,” Heisey told my office. After retiring as a VSO in January 2020, SFC Heisey became a full time Worship Pastor and Minister of Youth in Hayden, Idahho. “All of this would not have been possible without the help and guidance of my God; and my wife Anna,” Heisey says of his wife of 33 years.\n\nVeteran William Mostoller: Corporal (Cpl) William E. Mostoller served in the United States Marine Corps as a light armored vehicle (LAV) mechanic for the 3D Light Armored Reconnaissance Battalion, 1st Marine Division. As a line mechanic, his duties were to help maintain vehicles during daily combat operations, conducting raids and checkpoints in search of enemy high-value targets or enemy combatants. Additionally, his efforts disrupted pipelines supplying the Taliban with weapons, money and drugs. During his deployment to Afghanistan, Cpl Mostoller received several awards, including a Navy Achievement Medal with a V for Valor, which he received for directly saving the lives of two Marines. The LAV Cpl Mostoller was traveling in struck an improvised explosive device (IED) while conducting a reconnaissance patrol. Once he regained his situational awareness, Cpl Mostoller, “Braving certain danger, extinguished two fires in the engine compartment while shielding the Marines from more harm,” reads a certificate for the medal. “Lance Corporal Mostoller’s initiative, perseverance, and total dedication to duty reflected credit upon him and were in keeping with the highest tradition of the Marine Corps and the United States Naval Service,” it further reads. Finally, the summary of action reads, “In the midst of chaos and uncertainty, Lance Corporal Mostoller braved imminent dangers at great personal risk.” Cpl Mostoller has received other awards and ribbons, including a Combat Action Ribbon, Global War on Terrorism Service Medal, Afghanistan Campaign Medal, a Certificate of Commendation, among others. Mosteller is proud of his family roots in the United States military, including a great-great grandfather Medal of Honor recipient in the Civil War, John Mostoller, and Philip Marsteller, a Lieutenant Colonel in the Revolutionary War. You can read more about John HERE and Philip HERE. Cpl Mostoller now resides in Hagerman and is the CEO of Magic Valley Fit personal training.\n\nJardine’s brother, Virl, describes him as a person of “many hats.” He had a love for scouting, the Church, flowers, and music, among many other interests. He loved to spend evenings with his family playing Rook, Checkers and other board games. Jardine also loved to spend time outdoors in the mountains and in Teton Valley. As described by his brother, “He was at his best when with nature and among the handiworks of God.” He showered the children in his family with love, even though he did not have children of his own. Jardine was ordained a Deacon in 1935, a teacher in 1938, and a Priest in 1940. He received three Oak Leaf Clusters as well as an Award of Distinguished Flying Cross and an Award of Commendation Ribbon during his service. Jardine received a Purple Heart posthumously."
