        "text": "Frank Leon Miller was born in Missoula, Montana, as the youngest of three siblings. At 20 years old he was working in the family run Miller’s Garage as a mechanic’s helper in Cathlamet, Washington, a trade he learned at the side of his father Frank T. Miller and his older brother Gratian.\n\nIn August of 1942 Frank traveled to Portland, Oregon, and enlisted in the US Navy, starting an apprentice seaman. At the U.S. Naval Training Station in San Diego, California, he completed his basic training. He then continued in the Service School expanding his mechanical expertise while working his way up in rank from apprentice seaman, to seaman 2nd class, and fireman 1st class (F1c). After s short trip home, he reported to the cruiser USS Nashville (CL-43) April 15, 1943. On May 12, 1943, while shelling Vila airfield on Kolombangara, Nashville had a powder charge explode in one of her turrets which killed 18 men and wounded another 17. Shortly after the ship returned stateside for repairs and by August the Nashville was busy again in the Pacific.\n\nIn early October F1c Miller was back in California. The following month he started a round of training to prepare him for working on a destroyer (firefighting, gunnery, night lookout, and learning how to be a petty officer in E.P.O. School). On December 31, 1943, he joined the crew (plank owners) of USS Cassin Young (DD-793). Frank continued to work his way up the ranks as a water tender (WT3c in February of 1944, WT2c February of 1945). He qualified to stand watch in the fireroom.\n\nOn April 12, 1945, while on picket duty off the coast of Okinawa, a kamikaze struck the mast of Cassin Young and exploded. Shrapnel rained down on the ship, killing one sailor and wounding 59 more. Miller was wounded in the leg and awarded a purple heart.1 Cassin Young went to Ulithi Atoll where the radar and mast were repaired, and then returned to picket duty. In The Two-Ocean War historian Samuel Eliot Morrison writes, \"Radar picket duty could be as suicidal for the picketing sailors as for the attacking Japanese.\"2\n\nOn July 30, 1945, USS Cassin Young was struck by a kamikaze a second time. This time the plane crashed through the main deck and into the forward fireroom, causing a significant explosion. WT2c Miller was one of 22 sailors killed, passing later that day aboard USS Cascade (AD-16). He was 23 years old.\n\nIn 1949 Frank Miller’s final resting place became the Greenwood Cemetery in his hometown of Cathlamet, Washington.\n\nFootnotes:"
