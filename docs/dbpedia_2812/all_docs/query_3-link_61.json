        "text": "The Army’s top recruiting award was presented for the first time in 10 years to eight recruiters from the Raleigh Recruiting Battalion at a ceremony held here today.\n\nThe Glenn E. Morell Award, which consists of a bronze medallion and a ring, is the ultimate achievement award offered by U.S. Army Recruiting Command for recruiting excellence.\n\n“It means a lot to me to know that I'm being looked at in a different way. I'm very shocked,” said Staff Sgt. Tenesha Friday, Army recruiter and award recipient. “It feels good to stand out in that way. I did my job. I just put people in the Army - that's just what I do.”\n\nThe Morrell Award is named after retired Sgt. Maj. of the Army Glenn E. Morrell who served as USAREC’s command sergeant major from October 1981 to September 1982. Morrell stands for professionalism, integrity, and devotion to duty - all the positive attributes required in order to achieve this award.\n\nThe award was first introduced to the USAREC awards program in 1994, but was suspended in February 2011. Maj. Gen. Frank Muth, commanding general, U.S. Army Recruiting Command, submitted a request to reinstate the award in December 2018 citing the need to recognize Soldiers for their continued outstanding contributions to the recruiting mission.\n\nThe award was reinstated by the U.S. Army Training and Doctrine commander on Aug. 13, 2019.\n\n\"This is a very, very special award. I brought it back because I thought it was important to recognize the recruiters for all of their efforts,\" Muth said. \"They live and swim in a sea of rejection, and the ones that are able to achieve this award are able to get through that and still put people in boots.\"\n\nThe Soldiers who received the Morrell Award today are as follows:\n\nSgt. 1st Class Esther Kuttler\n\nSgt. 1st Class Jeffrey Thompson\n\nStaff Sgt. Michael Crump, Jr.\n\nStaff Sgt. Paul Ernandes\n\nStaff Sgt. Tanesha Friday\n\nStaff Sgt. Jamus Lee\n\nStaff Sgt. David Miller\n\nStaff Sgt. Darius Streeter"
