Nine students have received additional accolades as part of the school’s 2022 spring Commencement celebration.  Agustina Yanez (MSW ’22), Edith M. Davis Award  The Davis Award recognizes the best paper focusing on a non-dominant racial or ethnic group or a person or persons of color. The award honors Professor Emerita Edith M. Davis, who was the founding director of the GSSW doctoral program. A bilingual (English–Spanish) advocate for well-being and healthy youth development in marginalized communities, Yanez was recognized for her paper “Food Security in Venezuela,” which faculty readers said “offers a compelling argument about an international issue that requires the attention of social work as it relates to human rights.” Yanez graduated in spring 2022 with a concentration in Organizational Leadership & Policy Practice and also earned a Latinx Social Work Certificate.    Liana Moss (MSW ’22), Tommi Frank Memorial Award  The Frank Memorial Award is named for the late Tommi Frank, MSW ’64. It recognizes the student judged by faculty to have submitted the most creative and imaginative paper or project in social work or social welfare. The award particularly values the creation of new concepts, arrangements of concepts and/or new ways of relating knowledge to practice, profoundness of thinking and the scholarly application of such thinking to the refinement of theory and/or practice and to applicability for use in practice. Moss’s paper, “Free In-Patient Substance Use Rehabilitation: Co-housing Adults and Their Canine Companions,” provided a comprehensive proposal of the components that can help provide substance abuse treatment for individuals who own dogs without separating the clients from their animals. Moss graduated in spring 2022 with a concentration in Organizational Leadership & Policy Practice and earned a Human–Animal-Environment Interactions in Social Work Certificate as well.    Julia Kennedy (MSW ’22), Ina Mae Denham Award  The Denham Award is presented annually to the graduating student who writes the best clinical paper describing and analyzing his/her own actual case practice, including the rationale and application of appropriate interventions based on relevant theory and clinical literature. The Colorado Society for Clinical Social Work created the award, which includes a cash award and society membership. Kennedy’s case conceptualization paper “displayed a strength of your clinical insight, application of clinical assessment and theory and critical self-reflection,” the Faculty Awards committee wrote. Kennedy graduated in spring 2022 and aims to become a licensed clinical social worker.    Anna Vivian (MSW ’22), Dorothea C. Spellmann Award  The Spellmann Award honors a student whose paper or project best demonstrates understanding, creativity and competence in work with groups, including an understanding and appreciation of groups as a primary means of service with people. The award was named for Professor Emerita Dorothea Spellmann upon her retirement in 1972. Faculty found Vivian’s paper “IPV Intersections: Mental Health and Substance Use: A Professional Development Manual for Child Welfare Case Workers” to be “amazing — an impressive amount of work, professional and incredibly comprehensive.” Vivian graduated in spring 2022 and has joined Denver Human Services as a social caseworker, partnering with families to pursue safety, wellness and permanency for children and young people.    Joel Berdie (MSW ’22), William Bartholomew Memorial Award  The William Bartholomew Memorial Award was established in 2018 to honor William Bartholomew, MSW ’04, who devoted his professional life to empowering individuals to fulfill their potential and overcome barriers posed by factors such as trauma, addiction and oppression. The award honors students who embody principles of social justice, preservation of human dignity, and a commitment to facilitating healing of human suffering. Berdie was honored for his essay “Reciprocal Medicine,” which the Faculty Awards Committee found to be “incredibly thoughtful and self-reflective.” In the essay, Berdie discusses the death of a family member by suicide, an event that sparked his interest in walking alongside people in pain as a social worker. “The more I sit in these raw spaces, perhaps counterintuitively, I feel a warm sense of confidence, solidity, value, and pride in being present for people’s tears and despair. It is reciprocal medicine; it is an honor,” wrote Berdie, a 2022 graduate of the Four Corners MSW Program.",
