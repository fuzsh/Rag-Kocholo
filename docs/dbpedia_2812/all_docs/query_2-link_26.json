        "text": "Frank Miller\n\n“I have no right to be possessive, but once I’ve worked on a character, it’s hard to see any other way than my way,” says Miller, photographed Feb. 23 at his office in New York.\n\n‘The Spirit’\n\nWhen he helmed 2008’s The Spirit, Miller became the only comics creator to graduate to director of a studio release. The film grossed $39 million worldwide.\n\nStoryboards\n\nMiller drew more than a thousand storyboards for The Spirit, now housed in 13 volumes.\n\nToy Cars\n\n“Drawing girls and drawing cars, those were my two nemeses, the hardest things for me to draw,” says Miller, who keeps an entire cabinet of toy cars for reference.\n\n‘Sin City’\n\nMiller on the set of Sin City with Bruce Willis, who played his creation Hartigan. Director Robert Rodriguez quit the DGA so Miller, who had never helmed a film before, could receive a co-director credit. “He’s a man of honor,” says Miller.\n\nMiller’s Mother\n\nWhen he was a 7-year-old growing up in Vermont, Miller told his mother, Marjorie, he was going to draw comics as a career: “She was the best cheerleader I could have.”"
