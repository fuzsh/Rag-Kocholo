        "text": "Thanks for sharing these! I haven't fact checked them (trust but verify!) but it makes me think of how many unsung war heroes have stories like this. Grandpa was allegedly involved in many of the notorious sites as army infantry from WWII but never talked about them. Explains why he would \"hit the deck\" in the yard when planes flew over as family lore tells....\n\nBeen binging on The Fat Electrician and his war and military telling's, his commentary, different sayings like \"war heads on foreheads\" \"bigger bullet, bigger hole, less bad guy-its science\" and his dogging on the metric system makes me chuckle. I like this kind of history and wish he was one of my teachers is high school."
