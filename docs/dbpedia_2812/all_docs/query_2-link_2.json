        "text": "WHITPAIN – As long as the action kept him moving, it seemed Dr. Frank L. Miller simply had no time for fear when dealing with the ravages of World War II.\n\n“No, I was never afraid,”‘ the then-98-year-old Miller had recalled, sitting in an elegant drawing room at Normandy Farms Estates, a place the onetime Norristown General Practitioner and his wife Betty had been calling home for a decade when The Times Herald came calling for an interview back in 2012.\n\nMiller passed away on Monday at age 104 at Normandy Farms and will be buried at Arlington National Cemetery, his son, William Miller said.\n\nA reception will be held at Boyd-Horrox-Givnish, 200 W. Germantown Pike, East Norriton on Friday, Aug. 30, 10 to 10:30 a.m., followed by a service at 10:30 a.m.\n\nAfter the war, Miller had returned home to Jeffersonville, settling into family life with his wife and four children and a private practice with an affiliation with Montgomery Hospital and Sacred Heart Hospital that lasted more than 50 years.\n\nBut in his late 1990s it was the memory of his time as a World War II frontline battle surgeon serving in combat from 1941 to 1945 that he recalled with stunning clarity.\n\nMiller’s recollections went back even further than that, to his bucolic boyhood existence as a farm hand milking cows and gathering eggs on his parents’ farm on the Perkiomen Creek, as he got his educational start at Henry K. Boyer School on Evansburg Road in Lower Providence.\n\nAs a young pre-med student at Ursinus College, he had little inkling of the harrowing journey that awaited him after graduation in 1937.\n\nAfter earning his medical degree from Hahnemann University Hospital in 1941 and logging a brief internship at Montgomery Hospital in Norristown, he enlisted in the U.S. Army at age 28.\n\nIt was then that the newly married Miller embarked on a trek that would take him to France, Holland, Germany and back, gathering the medical and military skills in many desperate situations that were vital to the perseverance that would earn him Silver and Bronze Star Medals.\n\n“The day I graduated from medical school I was made a first lieutenant in the Medical Corps,” Miller had recalled. The pursuit of his Combat Medic badge took him through a basic training stint at Carlisle Barracks, which was quickly followed by a life-changing alliance with the 104th (Timberwolf) Infantry Division at Oregon’s Camp Adair.\n\nFrom one training facility to another, Camp Kilmer, N.J., he was finally off to war in 1942.\n\nThe 104th Infantry Division would see nearly 200 days of fighting in northwestern Europe, fighting its way through many devastating German counterattacks in France, Belgium, and western Germany.\n\nMiller’s battalion was the first to reach the coast of France, docking in Cherbourg.\n\n“We joined the Canadian and the British armies in helping liberate Belgium and Holland,’ Miller remembered. “Our divisions were attached to them.’ From there thousands of the men who wore the Timberwolf shoulder insignia moved on to North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany.\n\n‘Then we really started to participate in quite a few battles until we got to the Rhine River,’ Miller said.\n\nMaking tracks across the Bridge at Remagen over the Rhine River, the Timberwolves were under the divisional command of Lt. General Courtney Hodges and later, Major General Lightning’ Joe Collins and General Terry Allen.\n\nWhen asked about one of his most ingrained memories, Miller said the horror he experienced as he and his comrades helped liberate Nordhausen, a sub-camp of the concentration camp Dora-Mittelbau, created by the Nazis for prisoners too weak or too sick to work in the tunnels of Dora on the building of the German V1 and V2 rockets.\n\n“‘There must have been 4,000 or 5,000 cadavers around the place. It was horrible,’ he said. “We liberated a few hundred, and years later some of them would come to our reunions to thank us.’\n\nA pair of surgical scissors had a prominent place among the war memorabilia Miller kept with him at Normandy Farms as an indelible reminder of the horror wrought by just one day in battle.\n\nA thin shoestring once secured the scissors to his belt so he’d never misplace them.\n\n“All hell broke loose and artillery were firing all around and this soldier was in an inn where the troops were getting ready to attack and I had to amputate his foot,’ Miller remembered. ‘There were shells all over the place. We had to do what we could to patch them up. I went up the street and told the Colonel I was going to set up an aid station, when a shell came into the middle of the street, killed the Colonel, wounded another soldier behind me and I wasn’t touched at all.”\n\nThrough numerous incidents like this, Miller acknowledged his own good fortune at never sustaining so much as a scratch.\n\n“I was just lucky,’ he had said matter-of-factly.\n\nAs a testament to his bravery, Miller had been recommended for the Congressional Medal of Honor, the nation’s highest military award, but was denied that prestigious honor because it was determined to be ‘a fighting man’s medal, and he didn’t carry a gun,” his son, William explained.\n\nHowever, Miller’s Silver Star Medal Citation, signed by Allen, was subsequently awarded for Miller’s ‘gallantry in action in Germany’ on Nov. 27, 1944, for ‘complete disregard for his personal safety … in the face of intense artillery barrage.’\n\nA Bronze Star Medal Citation, also signed by Allen, was awarded for meritorious achievement in connection with military operations in Holland on Nov. 2, 1944.\n\nOn that night, Miller’s battalion aid station was set up at a crucial juncture where a river crossing was to be the next move. “I set up an aid station and a regimental surgeon came and said I had to take care of all the casualties,’ Miller recalled. ‘That night they made the attack and the casualties started coming back so we started taking care of quite a few of them. The next morning we had no more casualties, so I went to the battalion executive officer and said, Major Gordon I think we’re too far behind now. So I loaded up the Jeep and drove down to the river.”\n\nThe citation noted that Miller moved his aid station while under heavy enemy fire, resting only when all the transported casualties were moved.\n\n“After that we went on to the next town and it was the end of the war in Holland,” Miller said.\n\nYears later, Miller’s patients would view the citations on the walls of his 715 W. Marshall St. office.\n\n‘The way I was in practice just doesn’t exist anymore,” he said.\n\nMiller said he was thoroughly enjoying his post-war, post-career years at Normandy Farms.\n\n“It’s a good deal when you retire somewhere like this,’ he said."
