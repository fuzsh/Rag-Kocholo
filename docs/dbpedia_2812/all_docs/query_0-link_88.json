        "text": "Bureaucracy has a way of perpetuating injustice. A perfect, unfortunate example is the ongoing injustice that has kept the Medal of Honor nomination of retired U.S. Army Col. Paris D. Davis bouncing around the Army and the Pentagon for a half century.\n\nDavis was one of our nation’s first black Special Forces officers. He led his unit in Vietnam at around the same time that Bloody Sunday was occurring in Selma, Alabama. Largely ignoring the social strife at home, Davis engaged in multiple valorous actions during the battle of Bong Son in Vietnam in 1965. Despite being wounded himself, Davis saved the lives of multiple soldiers and held off a numerically superior enemy force. His extraordinary heroism during the 19 hours of battle has been periodically reported on through the years.\n\nA team of volunteer historians, military officers and men who fought with Davis has advocated for him for decades. This much is clear: At the end of the Bong Son battle, he was recommended for the Medal of Honor by one of his team sergeants whom he had rescued that day. That nomination package and all supporting documentation were somehow “lost” without explanation. When his commander and the Army determined his 1965 packet disappeared into the bureaucracy, a subsequent recreated packet also was “lost” in 1969.\n\nAmerica Talks: Come #ListenFirst in a conversation with another American to bridge political divides\n\nWhile most of the eyewitnesses to the heroic events at Bong Son have passed away, and the memory of one surviving witness is failing, the volunteers who support Davis recently recreated another nomination package and located even more witnesses to his heroism. They developed a compelling update on the Davis story. Their documentation, both on paper and on a website, answers the important looming questions about Davis and his heroism.\n\nMade aware of the Davis case during my tenure at the Pentagon, I directed my office to recreate and resubmit the lost Medal of Honor package for Army review and forwarding to my office for approval. After my departure, the bureaucracy again stalled the nomination package without much explanation.\n\nDefense diversity: Kamala Harris and Lloyd Austin portraits will spur change in the military and America\n\nAs Acting Secretary of Defense, I took direct steps to root out systemic injustice in the Department of Defense. When I approved internal Department of Defense recommendations to improve racial and ethnic diversity and inclusion in the military, I was confident we could bring some immediate change. I was wrong – because I underestimated the Pentagon bureaucracy.\n\nThe Davis case raises troubling questions about what truly happened to his Medal of Honor nomination in 1965, then in 1969, and again through the years. We may never solve that mystery, but I do know our military has a decades-long tradition of leading change toward racial and ethnic equity. While far from perfect, our military has strived to right wrongs, set examples, and address racial injustices. Another important step in that process is to continue to revisit and then recognize the sacrifices and heroism of our black service members – both contemporary and historic.\n\nAwarding Davis the Medal of Honor now might not untangle much military bureaucracy. But it would address an injustice. Some issues in our nation rise above partisanship. The Davis case meets that standard.\n\nMen-only draft? Supreme Court should strike down vestige of anti-women bias.\n\nThrough it all, Davis has epitomized humility. He is grateful for the efforts of the volunteer team that wants his story told and for the respect of the men who served with him. Our country would do well to know more of his life story which, besides his extraordinary military service in Vietnam and beyond, includes a loving family, multiple college degrees, and a career as a local newspaper publisher.\n\nThe military bureaucracy should not be allowed to obscure the important contributions and legacy of Col. Paris Davis. For that reason, I urge President Biden to award the Medal of Honor to him.\n\nMiller served as Acting Secretary of Defense and as Director of the National Counter-Terrorism Center under former President Donald Trump. He is a 20-year veteran of Army Special Forces."
