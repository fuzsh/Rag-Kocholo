        "text": "This has been discussed ad nauseum across the net, but I just wanted to get my viewpoint down for the record. Last weekend, Rich Johnston reporter on Bleeding cool some of the comments from Frank Miller regarding the Occupy Wall Street Movement.\n\nOccupy Frank Miller\n\nNow, I’m already on record as saying that I don’t totally agree with the direction of this so-call movement, I think it lacks focus. But Miller’s comments are absurd. I’m just going to address the parts that Rich quoted in his article.\n\nThe “Occupy” movement, whether displaying itself on Wall Street or in the streets of Oakland (which has, with unspeakable cowardice, embraced it) is anything but an exercise of our blessed First Amendment.\n\nReally? Maybe Mr. Miller needs to re-read the First Amendment. It seems like that’s exactly what it is, to me. Whether Frank Miller, or I, don’t completely agree with this particular display doesn’t change that fact.\n\n“Occupy” is nothing but a pack of louts, thieves, and rapists, an unruly mob, fed by Woodstock-era nostalgia and putrid false righteousness. These clowns can do nothing but harm America.\n\n“Occupy” is nothing short of a clumsy, poorly-expressed attempt at anarchy, to the extent that the “movement” – HAH! Some “movement”, except if the word “bowel” is attached – is anything more than an ugly fashion statement by a bunch of iPhone, iPad wielding spoiled brats who should stop getting in the way of working people and find jobs for themselves.\n\nFor a man who has been a professional writer for 2 or 3 decades, a bunch of name-calling is the best he can do?\n\nThis is no popular uprising. This is garbage. And goodness knows they’re spewing their garbage – both politically and physically – every which way they can find.\n\nWell, it may not be popular with him, but it sure seems to popular with a lot of other people.\n\nBut here’s my favorite part:\n\nWake up, pond scum. America is at war against a ruthless enemy.\n\nMaybe, between bouts of self-pity and all the other tasty tidbits of narcissism you’ve been served up in your sheltered, comfy little worlds, you’ve heard terms like al-Qaeda and Islamicism.\n\nAnd this enemy of mine — not of yours, apparently – must be getting a dark chuckle, if not an outright horselaugh – out of your vain, childish, self-destructive spectacle.\n\nNow this makes absolutely no sense. What in the bloody hell does this have to do with fighting terrorism? This isn’t a peace rally or anti-war rally. How does protesting abuses in American businesses hurt America in regards to fighting terrorism? Yet, apparently, it was perfectly fine for the Tea Party Movement to hold hundreds of rallies denouncing the President of The United States, questioning his eligibility to hold the office by denying that he was an American Citizen, and calling him and the majority party in congress names, over the past 3 years, including while we were right in the middle of fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan, and Osama Bin Laden was still alive and free. THAT didn’t hurt America, or make us look weak to the terrorists? Apparently, according to Frank Miller, that was just fine, an example of our “blessed First Amendment” but, somehow, the OWS participants are dangerously irresponsible. He’s just grasping at straws, now.\n\nIn the name of decency, go home to your parents, you losers. Go back to your mommas’ basements and play with your Lords Of Warcraft.\n\nNow that is the most insulting part of this idiotic rant. This type of “mother’s basement” insult is EXACTLY, what many people think about comic-book fans, and use to insult them. NEWS FLASH MISTER MILLER: The audience of video game players shares an awful lot of overlap with the audience of comic-book collectors. You know, the people who have enabled you to make a living? Way to piss all over your own fanbase, genius.\n\nOr better yet, enlist for the real thing. Maybe our military could whip some of you into shape.\n\nWell, that makes sense, coming from a brave military veteran like Frank Miller.\n\nOh, right, Miller’s never served in the military. But he did BRAVELY help the fight against terrorism by…writing & drawing a comic-book about terrorists.\n\nGee, and President Barack Hussein Obama hasn’t given Miller a medal yet? What a communist!\n\nWhat’s funny is the reminds me of what Grant Morrison said when he first heard of the idea about Miller’s comic: “I’d be so much more impressed if Frank Miller gave up all this graphic novel nonsense, joined the Army and, with a howl of undying hate, rushed headlong onto the front lines with the young soldiers who are actually risking life and limb ‘vs.’ Al Qaeda”\n\nThey might not let you babies keep your iPhones, though. Try to soldier on.\n\nSchmucks.\n\nIn other words: YOU KIDS STAY OFF MY DAMN LAWN!!!\n\nHe just sounds like a grumpy old man who’s lost touch with reality. Well, he can join his other Far Right buddy Chuck Dixon on my personal boycott list now. Let the Tea Party buy their junk."
