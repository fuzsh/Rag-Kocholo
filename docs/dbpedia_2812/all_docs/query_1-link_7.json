Lying on this street, shaking in deep shock, dying for no reason at all. They showed me that the world only makes sense when you force it to. „ ~ Batman.\n\nBruce Wayne, better known as Batman or the Goddamn Batman, is a superhero appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics and the main protagonist of Frank Miller's Dark Knight series in Earth-31.\n\nIn some of Miller's works like Batman: The Dark Knight Returns, Batman: Year One, Spawn/Batman, The Dark Knight III: The Master Race, and Dark Knight Returns: The Last Crusade, Batman continued to exhibit heroic qualities, even though the stories were grittier and more mature than most other Batman books. In later stories The Dark Knight Strikes Again and All-Star Batman and Robin, the Boy Wonder, Batman is a sociopathic anti-hero that is panned by both critics and readers alike. This article will cover the Goddamn Batman.\n\nIn the animated adaptations of Year One and The Dark Knight Returns, the Goddamn Batman was voiced respectively by Ben McKenzie and Peter Weller, the latter of whom also played John Frederick Paxton in Star Trek: Enterprise, Christopher Henderson in 24, Alexander Marcus in Star Trek Into Darkness, Mr. Yin in Psych, Stan Liddy in Dexter and Caleb Thies in Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare.\n\nBiography[]\n\nAll-Star Batman and Robin, the Boy Wonder[]\n\nIn what is said to be the canonical start of all of Frank Miller's Batman works following Batman: Year One, Bruce Wayne first appears to watch the performance of Dick Grayson, age 12, and his family perform, with a particular focus on Dick. When Dick's parents are murdered, Batman abducts Dick against his will, saying he has been \"drafted into a war\", and takes him into the Batmobile. When the police give chase, Batman violently rams the Batmobile through their cars, splitting one in half.\n\nHe rationalizes his actions by saying the police are corrupt. He also hits Dick when the child understandably cries out of fear. Although Batman briefly questions his own actions, he nevertheless keeps Dick as a prisoner. At the Batcave, Batman shows a childlike annoyance in Dick's lack of wonder at the sight of the Batcave and leaves him there. When asked what he should do, Batman simply tells Dick to survive on his own and eat at the rats that show up. Batman's butler Alfred Pennyworth becomes concerned for the child and gives him food and warm clothes; Batman reprimands Alfred for \"interfering\".\n\nOne night, Batman met and teamed up with Black Canary and then they both had sex before Batman took her home.\n\nThey eventually capture the killer of Dick's parents and find that he had been hired by the Joker, and then dump the killer in a river. During one of their rounds, Batman lures Green Lantern and beats up the superhero with no provocation in a room full of yellow, which he cannot use his ring's powers against. Green Lantern argues against the cruel and unsavory methods Batman employs, only to be mocked by Batman and urged into a fight when Robin steals his ring. However, Batman shows an uncharacteristic humanity when he stops Dick from killing Green Lantern, and they later shares a moment of grief for their respective parents in a graveyard. Nevertheless, he still retains Grayson as Robin.\n\nThis is also the incarnation of Batman that spawned the infamous \"I'm the Goddamn Batman!\" Internet meme as seen in the page quote, further demonstrating how radically different this incarnation of Batman is.\n\nThe Dark Knight Strikes Again[]\n\nIn the years following the events of The Dark Knight Returns, Batman returns to action to enact against the tyranny of Lex Luthor. However, his actions are more in line with those of a terrorist than a superhero. In his instance of attacking and taking down Luthor, he does not stop the villain right there, instead preferring to rely on terrorist acts (most notably mutilating Luthor's face with a massive \"Z\"). He then puts on Kryptonite-laced gloves and gives Superman a savage beating. While Superman is forced by Luthor and Brainiac to work for them to defend the city of Kandor, Batman shows very little mercy to his former ally, instead using the opportunity to just beat up Superman while hypocritically declaring the superiority of heroes without superpowers.\n\nHe also encourages a group of young women dressed as superheroes called The Superchix to rebel, resulting in their deaths for a completely pointless act, likely his Moral Event Horizon-crossing act. He also pulls another MEH-worthy action in having the heroes hold back when many civilians are murdered and injured by a Brainiac-conjured monster. While he does recognize it as a trap, he still prefers to let millions die just to ensure his plan works, an action very uncharacteristic of the usual Batman. When he finally gets to Luthor, Batman allows himself to be captured and tortured, only to set up Luthor to be caught by Hawkman and Hawkgirl's son. In another very uncharacteristic act for Batman, he encourages their son to get revenge on Luthor, leading to the villain's horrific death. When Flash questions this action, Batman silences him.\n\nAt the end, he goes to rescue his new Robin-turned-Catgirl Carrie from a superhero-killing Joker-esque shapeshifter that is revealed to be none other than Dick Grayson. Grayson reveals past affections for Batman, to which Batman taunts with disturbingly homophobic slurs while also noting that he was useless and pathetic (which definitely takes a darker overtone when one considers All-Star Batman and Robin, the Boy Wonder). Batman ultimately kills Grayson by knocking him into a volcanic center below the Bat Cave after being saved by Superman yet expresses some regret for having to do it. By taking the previous narrative into consideration, this is the tragic and disturbing result of Batman's abuse of Grayson, which might have even been sexual as well as physical and emotional. Nevertheless, Batman once again shows a somewhat human side by his apparent care for Carrie, although some have interpreted this as implying creepy wife husbandry at work - although Carrie shows none of the resentment towards Batman as Grayson does here.\n\nBatman also presents another disturbing side to his character in the arc involving Superman and his daughter, who questions why they, as Kryptonians, should just not use their power to rule over those on Earth. Superman argues that such a thing would be wrong, until Batman steps in and actually mocks Superman for not taking advantage of his powers to accomplish such a goal, possibly showing that he doesn't care for humanity's welfare (yet it could be in part that he along with most members of the Justice League of America were banned by the government from continue their heroic activities).\n\nPersonality[]\n\nThis version of Batman is pretty much the complete opposite of any trait associated with the classic Batman; whereas the original Batman adhered to a strict moral code, this Batman is a violent sociopath. It is clear through the story of All-Star Batman and Robin, the Boy Wonder that this Batman is mentally ill, as he tends to overreact to nearly everything with extreme violence, even the smallest sign of provocation. He exhibits a childish personality, getting mad at Dick Grayson because the child didn't think the Batcave was \"cool\" and is completely abusive towards everyone who crosses his way, even his butler, Alfred, and Black Canary, whom Batman forms an abusive relationship with (ironically, as Black Canary was depicted as hating men due to them being extremely disrespectful to her for being an attractive woman). He also presents a disturbed obsession with Dick, which is shown by the fact that he spied on the boy for months before his parents were murdered and immediately kidnapped him to force him to fight crime without a care for the boy's opinion. He lacks empathy and codes, as he brutally killed numerous criminals he encountered (including police officers), and also had no problem forcing the 12 year old Dick to eat rats and bats to survive alone in a cave, as well as tricking and brutally beating up Green Lantern just because the hero didn't agree with his methods; he even physically threatened Alfred for providing Dick with proper food. He was willing to leave millions of innocent people to die just to complete his plans and taking no responsibilities for his acts, as he repeatedly berates Dick for coming into his life and making his job more difficult, while ignoring that he was the one who abducted the boy against his will to fight crime. He also shows signs of hypocrisy in his disdain for Spawn due to the demonic anti-hero's tendency to mercilessly kill criminals, when he himself has caused deaths or endangered the lives of many people.\n\nHowever, this Batman isn't completely lacking in morals, as he stopped an enraged Dick Grayson from killing the beaten and defenseless Green Lantern, as well showing some signs of regret for his treatment of Grayson; he's shown to care about Carrie and is not seen as abusive towards her as he was towards Dick. As Batman is already a mature man in his mid-50s by the time Carie takes the mantle of Robin, it might be possible that within the years, he may have softened and become a better crimefighting crusader than he was when he started, yet the Lex Luthor/Dick Grayson incident causes him to temporarily revert back to his younger self. However, even so, he expressed remorse by having to get Grayson killed, possibly implying that he regretted his previous treatment towards him and that he felt a fatherly bond towards him as in Carrie's case (having been confirmed by Frank Miller that as Carrie sees him as the paternal figure she never had, Batman most likely sees her as the daughter he never had as well).\n\nGallery[]\n\nVideos[]\n\nTrivia[]\n\nFrank Miller's Dark Knight Universe series is considered non-canon to the mainstream Batman continuity, with the exception of Batman: Year One, which is commonly accepted as the origin story of Batman.\n\nIn the original The Dark Knight Returns, Bruce Wayne retires following the death of Jason Todd, only to be brought back into acting as Batman years later. While this incarnation is indeed an anti-hero (and definitely far more heroic than either of the other works mentioned here), it also reflects his returning dip into insanity. If the Frank Miller chronology is accurate, it can be assumed that he was the psychopathic self-seen within All-Star Batman & Robin before realizing his own insanity and retiring. However, this return to Batman led to his eventual insanity.\n\nWhile mostly heroic, there is still the major battle between Batman and Superman who acts on behalf of the government after the Joker finishes himself off. In the brutal fight to follow, Batman fakes his own death. However, he is also shown instigating riots in the streets against the Mutants by stirring the \"Sons of Batman\" (or the S.O.B.s), who demonstrate a darkly anti-heroic vigilantism (such as S.O.B.s murdering would-be robbers, rather than arresting them as Batman would).\n\nOriginally, the ending of The Dark Knight Returns had the Gotham City Police Department officers led by Ellen Yindel gun down Batman. However, Frank Miller ultimately changed the ending to symbolize that Bruce Wayne has died but the Dark Knight lives on. Had Miller maintained the original ending, this wouldn't have only prevented any sequels to be made, but most likely would have kept this Batman as a firm hero rather than a psychopathic anti-hero as later depicted.\n\nIt is generally theorized that both of these characterizations are a response and ridicule to the Dark Age incarnation of Batman seen in The Dark Knight Returns. However, in both instances, they only further cement the character as a sociopath.\n\nIn his reviews of the issues of All-Star Batman and Robin, the Boy Wonder, Linkara theorizes at one point that this isn't Batman, but instead a crazy hobo named Steve who managed to steal the Batsuit and began thinking that he was actually Batman. Thus, Linkara's name for the character \"Crazy Steve\" has become a fan nickname for the ASBRtBW incarnation, with the series being referred to as \"All-Star Crazy Steve and Dick Grayson, Age 12\".\n\nThe DC Extended Universe incarnation of Batman is primarily based on Frank Miller's Batman, in terms of costume design, his aggressive nature and lethal methods of combat and interrogation. However, unlike this Batman, the DCEU Batman is a far more caring and respectful person who only resorts to brutal violence due to the loss of Dick Grayson, which is far more akin to the version of the character in The Dark Knight Returns as opposed to later stories.\n\nDespite this version being hated, the popular nickname \"The Goddamn Batman\" originated within this version of Batman.\n\nThis version of Batman also appears as the co-star of the Spawn / Batman crossover, the result of a collaboration between Miller (to the script) and Todd McFarlane (to the drawings), where he fights against the demonic anti-hero after watching him burn two delinquents alive, to then join forces with him to stop a dangerous criminal intent on carrying out a genocide. Despite this, Batman has a deep disgust for Spawn's violent and homicidal nature (despite the fact that he himself does not skimp on violence towards criminals and has in the past stained himself with murder) and, after stopping their common enemy, after communicating his contempt, he wounds Spawn in the face with one of his Batarangs, promising that one day he will find a way to stop him. Despite this premise, there will be no subsequent clashes between the two, and Spawn will no longer make extras in the Miller timeline (there is another crossover between Batman and Spawn, but not in continuity with the story of Miller and McFarlane, as the Batman who meets Spawn is that of DC Comics mainstream continuity).\n\nWhile Batman is usually slow to engage in intimacy, this version has sex with Black Canary on their first meeting; befitting Frank Miller's penchant for prostitutes, she is also implied to be one, but happy to do it for free with him because he is just so good.\n\n[]\n\nBatman on the Heroes Wiki\n\nNavigation[]\n\nVillains\n\nComics\n\n2-Face-2 | Abraham Langstrom | Alfred Protocol | Alfred Stryker | Alice | Amanda Waller | Amygdala | Anarky | An Innocent Guy | Ares | Arkham Knight | Arnold Flass | Azrael | Baby Doll | Bane | Barbatos | Batman of Zur-En-Arrh | Bat-Mite | The Batman Who Laughs | Bizarro | Black Glove | Black Mask | Blockbuster I | Blockbuster II | Brain | Brainiac | Broker | Bronze Tiger | Brother EYE | Bruno | Calculator | Calender Man | Castle Bat | Captain Fear | Captain Boomerang | Captain Cold | Carmine Falcone | Catman | Catwoman | Cheetah | Cheshire | Circus of Strange | Clayface | Clayface (Matt Hagen) | Claything | Clock King | Clownface | Club of Villains | Cluemaster | Composite Superman | Condiment King | Colony | Copperhead | Cornelius Stirk | Court of Owls | Crazy Quilt | Crime Doctor | Curtis Base | Dark Archer | David Cain | David Li | Darkseid | Dark Knights | Daniel Captio | Deacon Blackfire | Deadshot | Dealer | Deathstroke | Devil Nezha | Dick Grayson (DC vs Vampires) | The Dawnbreaker | The Devastator | Dr. Crane | Doctor Death | Doctor Double X | Doctor Phosphorus | Doctor Randolph Porter | Doomsday | Dollmaker | Donna Troy | Dr. Silversmith | The Drowned | Eggers | Electrocutioner | Emperor Penguin | Enigma | The Eraser | Ernie Chubb | Failsafe | Faceless | False-Face | Falcone Crime Family | Film Freak | Fun Haus | Firebug | Firefly | Flamingo | Floronic Man | Gearhead | General Ulysses Armstrong | Gentleman Ghost | Gilda Dent | Gorilla Boss | Gorilla Grodd | Gotham City Police Department | Gillian B.
