        "text": "Franklin D. Miller, who won the Medal of Honor in the Vietnam War for single-handedly repulsing an attack on his patrol after he had been shot in the chest, died June 30 in Florida. He was 55 and lived in St. Pete Beach, Fla.\n\nThe cause was cancer, his family said.\n\nIn addition to receiving the Medal of Honor, the nation's highest award for valor, Mr. Miller was awarded the Silver Star, two Bronze Stars, the Air Medal and six Purple Hearts in four years in combat, prompting Gen.

The first sergeant said, 'You can take your punishment from me, or you can go see the old man.' I'd never been in trouble before so I said I'd go see the old man. I figured he would just chew me out. He said, 'We've got your reassignment orders to Vietnam.' ''\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
