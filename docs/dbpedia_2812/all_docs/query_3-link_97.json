Recipients also are honored with a biographical video.\n\nCarlos del Rio 86MR 88FM\n\nWhen it comes to experts in the field of infectious disease research, one name rises to the top: Carlos del Rio. A renowned clinician and epidemiologist, del Rio attended medical school in Mexico. After graduating, he came to Emory as a medical resident. He returned to Mexico as a physician and educator, and from 1992 to 1996, he was executive director of the National AIDS Council of Mexico.\n\nNow del Rio is a distinguished professor of medicine in the Division of Infectious Diseases at Emory University School of Medicine, executive associate dean for faculty and clinical affairs in Emory’s School of Medicine, and a professor of global health and epidemiology at the Rollins School of Public Health. He has recently been appointed chair of the Department of Medicine at the School of Medicine.\n\nThroughout the COVID-19 pandemic, del Rio advised municipal, state, and national leaders and was a frequent source for international media to educate the public about the ongoing health crisis.\n\nDel Rio is the immediate past president of the Infectious Diseases Society of America. He also chairs the Scientific Advisory Board of PEPFAR and is a member of the UNAIDS Scientific and Technical Advisory Committee. Del Rio is an elected member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and of the National Academy of Medicine, where he also serves as international secretary.\n\nHe has been recognized by the Carnegie Corporation as a “Great Immigrant, Great American” and by the City of Atlanta with the Phoenix Award, the city’s highest honor, for his medical guidance and support during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nDel Rio and his wife, Jeannette Guarner 87MR 89FM, are committed to support Emory in many ways. They have endowed scholarship funds to support Latino/Hispanic students at the Rollins School of Public Health and the School of Medicine. In 2023, del Rio and Guarner made a bequest to support the School of Medicine’s Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine and the Department of Medicine, Division of Infectious Diseases.\n\nC. Robert Henrikson 72L\n\nEmory University School of Law has been intentional about attracting a diverse student body, thanks in part to C. Robert Henrikson. In 2002, he and his wife, Mary, endowed a scholarship fund to support the recruitment of minority students.\n\nAfter graduating from Emory School of Law in 1972, Henrikson had a successful career at MetLife, Inc. He started his career as a sales representative for the company and became CEO in 2006. Henrikson built the company to be the leading voice in insurance. At the time of his retirement in 2011, MetLife’s portfolio was $450 billion—the largest growth in the company’s history.\n\nHenrikson is a pioneer in the insurance sector, setting standards for insurance and business practices that companies still follow. One of the most trusted voices in the sector, Henrikson has testified in front of Congress several times about retirement, pensions, and employee benefits.\n\nIn July 2010, he was appointed by President Barack Obama to the President’s Export Council, the principal national advisory committee on international trade. Henrikson was a board member of the American Council of Life Insurers, a board member of The Ron Brown Award for Corporate Leadership, and a board member emeritus of the American Benefits Council. He also served on the National Board of Advisors at the Morehouse School of Medicine and the board of directors of the New York Botanical Garden, and he was a trustee of the American Museum of Natural History. Additionally, he served on the Emory Law School Council and the Emory Campaign Steering Committee."
