That was June 1968. Johnny was killed in September in an ambush. I read of his death in the Armored Forces Newspaper while I was in the field in Anlock Vietnam. Every September I remember him. Years later when I visited The Wall in DC I found his name and did of rubbing of it as a keepsake. He was 21. Today I am 77 and still miss his great smile and laugh.\n\nFrom: Brenda Floyd Underwood\n\nI Will Always Remember….\n\nDear Lonnie, you are in my heart and thoughts today and everyday, You were a great big brother and a brave member of C/4/503 173rd ABN.

Bush whose POW/MIA bracelet I wore in high school and have kept all these years.\n\nFrom: MSgt Fred W. Saunders, USAF, Retired\n\nI Will Always Remember….\n\nMy outfit was the Detachment 1 of the 4252nd Strat Wing, SAC, Tahkli AB, Thailand. We provide all the inflight refueling for our combat planes going and coming from Vietnam. Our KC 135s rotated back to the States from time to time. They had a refrigeration unit on board and could bring back fresh milk . Ice Cream, beer. I was lucky one day to snatch a quart of Ice Cream! Because of the heat and humidy, I sat down and consumed the whole quart of Ice Cream! We also had King Cobras that liked our outhouse commodes, we had standing orders not to shoot up the outhouse and was required to call the MPs to remove the snake. Bugs came a million at a time after a rain. The water was nasty and contaminated so we drank the beer that our KC 135s brought.\n\nFrom: Carole\n\nI Will Always Remember….\n\nI am remembering my husband Sgt Harvey McKee Carkin who was killed on February 15, 1967.

Remembering Richard today and always.\n\nFrom: Shelly Pershing\n\nI Will Always Remember….\n\nI will always remember the brave Men and Women I was able to meet when our City of Lewisville, Texas, hosted The Wall That Heals in May 2019. Seeing their faces as they looked at The Wall and hearing their stories and the stories of those they came to pay respects to was something I will keep with me forever. These Men and Women define courage, bravery, integrity and honor. It was my privilege to honor you and help bring The Wall to our community for all to see. Thank you to all of those who sacrificed and served.\n\nFrom: CAPT Carl W.

To all our brothers near and far for those who serve today, thank you are very small words of what my heart wants to say. I miss my Brother Richard and keep him close inside, today, tomorrow and always til the day we meet again.\n\nLove your Gold Star Sister, Karen Sablotny-Rudolph\n\nFrom: Adriane Kelly\n\nI Will Always Remember….\n\nI will always remember Edgar Moran, who was a year ahead of me at Chartiers Valley High School in Pittsburgh. We had art class together. I regularly carried my chunk of sculpting marble home and back to school. Edgar, such a kind gentleman, insisted on bringing it to me. His favorite song in 1974 was Daniel, by Elton John. I still get floods of electric tingles and goosebumps when i hear it. Edgar joined up immediately after graduating, and during my senior year, we heard he and others in his company were shot down in their helicopter over Laos, following the fall of Saigon. I couldn’t cry until many years later when I stood at the Wall in DC and found his name, laid a rose beneath. I still can’t believe he’s gone, after all these years.\n\nAlso, i wore a POW/MIA bracelet in high school. Major Floyd Olsen. 4/21/68. He and his family have been in my prayers all these years.\n\nFrom: Mary Greiner\n\nI Will Always Remember….\n\nOur high school in southern Illinois was small but mighty. Several served, a few lost their lives. Two from the Class of 1967 have their names on the Wall and are remembered on our class Facebook page on the days of their birth and death. We remember you Tommy and Gary, and honor your sacrifice.\n\nFrom: Liz McAleavey, Fiance\n\nI Will Always Remember….\n\nThe Watch. I will always remember Michael A. Lackner. Mike was always punctual because he wore his watch every day. This was a good thing for me when I dated him in high school. My parents were very strict and expected me home on time. I never wore a watch and would have been late often, if it had not been for Mike. A couple of years I had to be home by 10 pm and later, as we got older, I had to be home by 11 pm; not a minute later. Mike was so responsible that he always got me home a couple of minutes early. There were my parents at the top of the steps gazing up at the clock. Mike also always knew exactly how long it would take him to walk from his home on W 11th St. to my home on W 21st St. He timed himself many times. That’s another thing that was good for me because my Mother would refuse to allow any of her daughters to go out with a date, if he was even 5 minutes late. Mike was always on time for our dates. I learned later that my parents liked him for his promptness and reliability. Mike’s watch kept my parents happy and kept me out of being punished, as he always saw to it that he arrived on time and got me home safe and sound from dates. Forever loved and forever remembered. Seg A Po Mike and Semper Fi our young Marine hero.\n\nFrom: Family\n\nI Will Always Remember….\n\nDouglas J Glover, SFC\n\nAnother year without you\n\nRemembering your strength and dedication and your pride in earning your jump status and the coveted GREEN BERET\n\nFrom: Chairman of Kershaw County and the American Legion and VFW of Kershaw County, SC\n\nI Will Always Remember….\n\nNo 18 wheeler has ever delivered such precious cargo as the Veterans and Patriots of South Carolina welcomed here in the Vietnam Wall that Heals: Honor and Remembrance in equal parts to celebrate the sacrifice of an entire generation in grateful testimony for generations to follow.\n\nFrom: Gary B\n\nI Will Always Remember….\n\nI’m praying for those who didn’t come home\n\nFrom: Jim Watson\n\nI Will Always Remember….\n\nCaptain Larry Helber, USMC, VMFA-314, MIA 1/24/66, Panel 4E, line 84. A rare Marine who worked his way up through the ranks from Private to Staff Sergeant to Lieutenant to the final rank that he was not to get to enjoy, we lost a man we will always admire and remember in Captain Helber.\n\nFrom: Despina Tucker\n\nI Will Always Remember….\n\nI will always remember what a wonderful man you were.

He followed in the footsteps of prior family members that served our country in WW II.\n\nFrom: Barbara Koker\n\nI Will Always Remember….\n\nI will always remember Cpl. Ralph “Pete” Triplett. He was my high school sweetheart. He was handsome, funny & intelligent. Pete’s favorite group was Gary Lewis & the Playboys & he loved the Three Stooges. Fifty years later, I still think of him and miss and love him every day. Till we meet again…\n\nFrom: Joan A. Brown\n\nI Will Always Remember….\n\nWhen I think about my younger brother, Dennis Robert Michalek, I am reminded of the times we roamed around Long Island from Jones Beach to Montauk Point. I think fondly of the special trip we took together to see the Macy’s Day Parade or visited Manhattan excited about going to Ellis Island or the Metropolitan Museum of Art. It is difficult knowing that we will not share more trips together in the future.\n\nDennis died in September of 2018. Many of his medical problems in later years were a result of his time as a soldier in the Vietnam War. When I looked at the photographs of Dennis in Vietnam, I am struck by how very young he was to be in a war. Dennis was the youngest in the family and was referred to as “Dennis the Menace” after the cartoon character in the funny papers.\n\nAs a youngster he wanted to grow up to be an apple juice salesman. Instead for a while he became a soldier along with many young men at the time. He bravely served his country in a war far away from home and family. My brother rarely talked to me about his experiences in Vietnam. It wasn’t until Dennis was older that he spent time reading about the history of the war, contacted other veterans, and searched out information about the war’s impact on his health.\n\nDennis loved meeting people. He would strike up a conversation with whoever he met and was known for his kindness and humor. He was the extrovert in the family ready to have a few beers and laughs. I will miss my baby brother and am proud to honor his memory as part of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial project especially on Memorial Day. He is now in the company of the brave men and women who served this country during a difficult time in our history. Dennis’ memory lives on through the Memorial project and his family, who will never forget him.\n\nFrom: Barb Vanderpool Lutes\n\nI Will Always Remember….\n\nMy big brother Sgt Edward L Vanderpool. You were a guardian angel here on earth that was proven when you gave your life to save a fellow soldier. Greater love hath no man than this that a man lay down his life for his friends.

Never forgotten!\n\nFrom: Wallace K. Beck\n\nI Will Always Remember….\n\nI will always remember your light, pop. It still shines even now.

In support of your family and to honor you I visit 51W19 often.\n\nFrom: Your Niece\n\nI Will Always Remember….\n\nLonnie Allen Floyd — I will always have you in my heart. I miss you and wish you were here to see my kids! I know they would love you as much as I did. I remember you always giving me your watch to keep when you were in and I also remember you telling me you would not like my baby sister about to be born and I would always be your favorite because she would pee on you! LOL. I ended up having 4 other sisters! One of them is up there with you. Lanette Floyd Bevel I’m sure you two have met. I can’t wait to see you again. I want you to also know that you can not imagine the hurt your brothers and sisters feel every day of their life without you! You were one loved boy!\n\nFrom: Dunn Family\n\nI Will Always Remember….\n\nToday, and every Memorial Day we remember in a special way my uncle, Major Pierce Robertson, who gave his life for our country and freedom in Vietnam on 10/9/66, while flying a helicopter. We also remember his widow, Aunt Sandi and son, our cousin Bruce.\n\nFrom: Susan Blaine\n\nI Will Always Remember….\n\nLyle Fitzgerald He was a combat Veteran in Vietnam.He was in the 101st Airborne Division Infantry Spec 5.

I will always remember the rain stained letters that told of the time you spent in the 101st Airborne Unit. I esp. remember the bracelet that a little Viet Nam boy put on your wrist that meant so much to you. Your life was taken away too soon and I truly wish we had more time to spend together on this earth. You are truly missed.\n\nFrom: Melanie Le Compte\n\nI Will Always Remember….\n\nI Will Always Remember EVERYONE who was in war. That war (Vietnam) was in my era (early teens). I was against the war, but NOT the ppl. who fought in it! Never protested it. I remember thinking How Much it SUCKED the way soldiers were treated on return. THANK YOU ALL!\n\nFrom: Mary Miller\n\nI Will Always Remember….\n\nI remember my grandfather, Robert T Sparks, who reluctantly answered the call in 1918, saw his infant daughter once, shipped out, and was killed Oct. 5, 1918 in the Meuse-Argonne. His daughter, our mother, never knew her dad and that unintended consequence of World War I forever scarred one more innocent.\n\nFrom: Jeff Silverman’s family\n\nI Will Always Remember….\n\nWe will be remembering our Dad, Jeff Silverman, this Memorial Day.\n\nHe served in the Navy from 1964-1970. During that time he was sent to Vietnam and was awarded the Vietnam Service Medal with Ribbon and a Bronze Star.\n\nHe faced life’s challenges with a great sense of pride and integrity. He worked very hard to provide a good life for his family. When this great country plunged into a recession in the 1980’s, he was laid off from his job, he used his talents and resourcefulness to care for his family.\n\nAs a result of his exposure to Agent Orange, he battled countless health issues and at the age of 72, lost the fight.\n\nHe was our Dad and our Hero.\n\nWe Love and Miss You Dad!\n\nFrom: Sterlin R. Mullins\n\nI Will Always Remember….\n\nKenneth Daugherty because he was a friend who lost his life while beside me the night I was wounded in a large fire fight and Thomas Olin because he was a friend and had just become a first time new father who never got to see his son. These agonizing memories are forever close to my heart. I will also remember my A.Co. 199th 1st Sgt. Charles …. as a brave and fair leader who gave his life to save others. May they Rest In Peace knowing their job was well done in the most difficult of circumstances.\n\nFrom: Verizon Veterans Advisory Board\n\nI Will Always Remember….\n\nWe will always remember the sacrifices of all of the Men and Women on the wall who served our nation as our Fathers had done in WWII and Korea.

With love and gratitude to all who gave their lives to their country, Pam\n\nFrom: Barbara\n\nI Will Always Remember….\n\nI remember Sharon (Lane) frequently. We met at Fort Sam in the spring of 1968 during basic training and became great friends. Three of us became inseparable while there. Two of my basic classmates and I arrived in Vietnam together in the fall of 1968. Sharon arrived at another hospital in the spring of 1969. We heard of her death a few hours after the rocket attack at Chu Lai. It was heartbreaking. I corresponded with her parents and they came to see me shortly after my return stateside. It was a sad but much appreciated visit by the three of us. I visit the wall sometimes and leave her notes and flowers as a remembrance. She is never forgotten. I also frequently think about the young soldier I sat with on Christmas Eve 1968 in the ER triage area, holding his hand and talking to him as his life slipped away, not wanting him to be alone. I still remember his red hair. I never forgot his name and leave him flowers also.\n\nFrom: The Ballard Family\n\nI Will Always Remember….\n\nIn honor of Pvt.

He Sacrifice his life for GOD, COUNTRY, and FAMILY. I was too young to embrace him before left to fight and he was too young, very young when he lost his life fighting. We often look at HERO that have many stripes and weighted down in gold, though my brother was just a Private to me he’s worth more than gold. Army personnel came to our house and delivered the news as they had did to some of you. Word of sorry and word of Sacrifice of your love one, some you have been there too. We all wanted our love ones to come home in a manner as if they were still young, but the war had taken a heavy toll on them and the youthful age was gone. No, my brother received 9 medals for the Sacrifices in Honor of his country. He didn’t avoid his duties, he served. He is at home known with his fellow brothers and sisters who also Served to the best of their abilities. We as a nation THANK them for their Sacrifice and Dedicated Services.

And the crooked system that allowed exemptions for “special boys. 7 boys, 6 served, 5 in Nam, 2 KIA. That’s not right.\n\nFrom: Janet Bamford\n\nI Will Always Remember….\n\nOf course, I could never forget my late husband, Dennis Bamford. But, just as memorable is Dennis Bamford, the Army retiree and veteran of the Viet Nam war. His exposure to all of the numerous chemicals that were sprayed, which caused his terminal cancer, and his daily suffering from PTSD, greatly affected him, until the moment he collapsed into a coma. I only hope that the soldiers who served with him in ‘Nam and throughout his career will also remember him as a most dedicated soldier and a true American patriot and hero.

Thirteen young men from our county were killed serving their country in Vietnam. The Wall That Heals gave us a chance to Honor those brave men. The Wall That Heals truly lives up to its Title.

At the time there was a effort to recognize the solders still missing. We wore a bracelet with the name of our solder, who was MIA. Many of my friends bought one as well. My soldier’s name was Sgt. Rose and he was from West Virginia. He was MIA. The bracelet was to be worn until the solder came home. Many of my friends’ soldiers did come home. Some received letters from the soldier, thanking them for the many prayers. I wore that bracelet for a very long time. As far as I know today, my soldier did not come home. I still think of him to this day.\n\nFrom: A Fiance, a Classmate, and Neighbor\n\nI Will Always Remember….\n\nI will always remember our DEER PARK 7, who served their country proudly.

What must we do that is worthy of a country that holds so many beautiful hearts, full of compassion and concerns for humanity around the world?\n\nFrom the spirit of service and courageous sacrifice, aunts and uncles gave their life. They left behind a noble value within a holy love from God.\n\nFrom this love, aunts and uncles plunged into war, sacrificed their life to save our younger generations. The life of our younger generations in this country and around the world need their hearts of service and courageous sacrifices for the goal of removing the destructive acts against basic human rights and the right to life.\n\nThis holiday we are filled with sadness because we are unable to come to the memorial to lift our reverent hearts to the names of aunts and uncles on the Wall.\n\nWe lift our prayer to God in Jesus Christ; may He pour love into the heroic souls of aunts and uncles.

Marines are very tough mentally, I just had a feeling he would not return alive ! I was in shock when the local paper announced he was a casualty, I cried a lot. I still cry a lot. All my life I have been overcome with grief! I am also a Vietnam Veteran and so I took not only his loss, but other Vets casualties very very hard. I pray that their sacrifice was not in vain.

Today is yesterday’s tomorrow.\n\nYesterday, we were confronted by the turmoil of an unpopular war and we had to overcome that challenge. Today, we are confronted by another challenge: we are challenged by an enemy that is almost invisible. It will take all of us again, working together as one, to overcome this latest challenge. We must remember that a different world will not be achieved by indifferent people.\n\nIt will take all of us working together to make the difference that is necessary to continue to move forward. We need to stop asking for more, but rather, ask for the wisdom, the power, the fortitude to do more with what we already have. Doing more with what we already have will honor those whom we memorialize today in the best possible way.\n\nToday is yesterday’s tomorrow. If change is going to be, it is up to you and me.\n\n– BG (USA, Ret.) George B.

The work is hard for the entire crew. 12 hours on 12 hours off. Steam upwind, then downwind. Launch and recover.\n\nOccasionally a plane will “crunch” during landing. “Hung Bombs” routinely release upon landing, bounce on the deck and splash harmlessly into the ocean. The days and nights are 99% filled with routine and hard work.\n\nTowards dusk, word comes down about a damaged Skyhawk attempting to land. There’s a little more tension now. We only see the light on the wing. We’ve seen thousands. This one indicates the bird’s in trouble. All eyes are on it for the 30 second final approach. Count 30 seconds.\n\nNose up, nose down. Too fast, too slow, and upon touch down, way too slow. The Skyhawk gives up the will to fly, makes a left turn and crashes into the deck, the landing signal officer’s platform and then the ocean.\n\nBig explosion and “birds” in the air with nowhere to go. They’ve got to land or crash, we have to make the deck ready. Perform. Do your job. Two dead, one dying and one badly injured.\n\nBobby Lee Spencer is dying. He was the radio man for the Landing Signal Officer and my friend. His left leg and right arm were ripped from his body by the A-4. We put him into a litter and immediately took him to the operating room where he died.\n\nI visit his name on the wall. Panel 42W, Line 2. I think about sacrifice and I often wonder if anyone else even thinks about Bobby these days. His death hurts more now than it did at dusk, on the 23rd of September, 1968. Now I’ve got the time.\n\nBruce Edgerly Roemmelt\n\n23 September 1985\n\nFrom: Family\n\nI Will Always Remember….\n\nCaptain Thomas W. Hart will always be remembered for his service in WWII.

He was a devoted family man who loved spending time with his wife and 3 children. He also loved to go fishing and was a devoted Roman Catholic. His devotion and love of his family, his country and the Corp was unwavering. The USMC and Vietnam are forever a part of my life because it was a part of his. One of my daughters went on to follow in her grandfather’s footsteps and joined the Corp after college. She made her way to Camp Pendleton once just to see where her grandfather took his last steps on US soil. This family is military strong (USMC, USAF) and I know a lot of it has to do with keeping his legacy alive.\n\nTo all of the military men and women who have sacrificed for this great country, I say “Thank You” for loving this country and its people so much.

May they be always remembered, ever honored, and forever be in our hearts.\n\nFrom: Nancy Ferris\n\nI Will Always Remember….\n\nI will always remember the incredible experience I had as the coordinator/host of the Wall that Heals when it came to Durant, Oklahoma in May, 2019. Months of preparation and visits with hundreds of Vietnam veterans and families prior to the event changed my life forever.\n\nAs the wife of a Vietnam veteran (now deceased), I thought I understood PTSD…I thought I understood the hardships and loss endured by families of servicemen and countrymen during the 60’s and 70’s because that was MY time. But not until I lived this incredible journey did I realize the special powers the Wall That Heals possesses to heal not just servicemen and women…but all of us….those who lived through it..and those of us who still fight the effects of the war and the changes it made in our world.\n\nSeveral incredible events happened during the time the Wall that Heals was in our town. Two weeks from its arrival, a community in our county was struck by a tornado. There were deaths…and a good many of my first string critical volunteers were members of our amazing Emergency management team for Bryan County as well as the Choctaw Nation’s EMS group.They left me to assist those in need. the second team stepped up to the task with dedication and commitment and the Wall that Heals kept coming our way.\n\nWe were plagued by devastating rain and thunderstorms on the day we put up the Wall that Heals. Many times first responders called us off the field due to lightening..but the the volunteers, many of whom were Vietnam vets never stopped..because the Wall kept coming.\n\nWhen we were ready to put up the last panel..Vic, the site manager, called upon the Vietnam vets to join together to erect the last crucial piece. Seeing that… made me cry with respect and gratitude. Their wet, muddy clothes, and miserable conditions which had lasted for hours had not deterred their determination to see the task completed. I cried as they pushed the last piece in place. But then..the younger men who had worked alongside them all day in the muck and the water formed a line and filed past each of them to shake the hand of each former soldier. such respect…a gesture that gave me bountiful hope that this generation “got it.” They understood the sacrifice. I was never so proud to be from Durant, Oklahoma as I was right then. I cried. I cried in the shadows at 3:00 a.m each morning as the mini van carrying a now disabled vet pulled himself from the driver’s seat into a walker and made his way across the wet, muddy field, only to be seen in the hallowed, misty, light…sitting on the walker at the same spot each time..quietly touching the wall with love and admiration in his fingertips…just sitting there until day’s light…. when he returned to his vehicle and rode away.\n\nFrom the first day that SSG Daniel Earley, U.S. Army, a Vietnam veteran and two time Purple Heart recipient, came to me asking for my help in bringing the Wall That Heals to Durant, I felt that God meant for this task to be mine. I have never before witnessed a more Christian experience than at the site, where one story poured from one heart (that of a vet)..into another (a volunteers) without judgement or prejudice.\n\nnow.. In the shadows…where no one can see… for those brave young soldiers…I cry…\n\nFrom: I am his daughter\n\nI Will Always Remember….\n\nI will always Remember….Delbert Chan Totty, USA panel 17 East .\n\nYou are my loving father, I will never forget a moment with you.\n\nI love you forever.

I had no idea I would be going to Vietnam. My life changed and I grew up fast and become a man. When I left Vietnam it never left me. I found out after 40 plus years I have been avoiding a lot out of life. I thank the Vietnam Veteran who point me to the VA about getting help. I know it is not a cure for PTSD but I have a great support system at the VA that teaching me how to deal with my PTSD. This Memorial Day I salute myself and thank God for keeping me along with a great family. The icing on the cake is I celebrate my first grandchild Olivia on this day.\n\nFrom: Beverly Metcalf\n\nI Will Always Remember….\n\nRemembering SFC (Ret) Timothy H.

May God bless you and your families and may God bless America.\n\nFrom: Sister\n\nI Will Always Remember….\n\nI will always remember my selfless brother, Mike Bartkowiak, who asked for nothing except a smile. His last Facebook post 2 days before he passed unpeacefully: “43 years ago today, the 17th of July was a Sunday. My life ended as I knew it with the loss of my last friend and 2 Bullets slowing down a touch as they hit me. In all 14 men were shot. I was the only one that lived. They are still there, 22 kilometers inside of Laos. In many ways I never left that place. In so many ways, I never left the war. Maybe I never will. ” Rest easy with your men.\n\nFrom: I Served in Pleiku in 1969 – 1970\n\nI Will Always Remember….\n\nThank all those who served in Vietnam, those who supported us and I’m sorry, for those who Never Returned Home to their loved ones. I wasn’t a combat soldier, but supported those who served in the Central Highlands of South Vietnam, II Corps, from June 1969 until I received a drop in May 1970. I had just met my replacement, and he was killed while I was home on leave. I had lost over 28 cousins from San Diego to Santa Barbara,, California, one of which, we met every time that I had gone to Santa Barbara as a kid. I went to college, he joined the Marines and was killed one month before I had arrived. Others were lost at different times and locations, God Bless Them All and all those who were lost, and all those who came home. And on 21 April 1970, God had me in his hands, as a Mortar round landed a few feet away from me, and it was a dud, and friendly fire. Not my time, and maybe I was kept alive for several reasons, one to help keep my mother alive, until she died in 2008, and maybe something else. God Bless us all, and America. Bob Smith,\n\n1st Signal Brigade, Pleiku Detachment, 361st Signal Battalion. I did manage to do some things not related to my jobs over there, but maybe I made up for some of my times, by transferring to Military Intelligence until I retired in 1989.\n\nFrom: Bernie Harry, your Hermitage Treasurer\n\nI Will Always Remember….\n\nI will always remember all the brave men and women who gave their lives for our freedom, and especially my good friend, Ginny Kirsch.
