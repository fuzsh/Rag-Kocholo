        "meta_description": "The graphic artist Frank Miller represents an innovative force in the field of graphic novels who pushes the medium into new territories. One such territory is Islamophobia and terrorism in his graphic novel Holy Terror (2011). This article explores how Islamophobia has been mediated and how media systems of the twenty-first century forge Islamophobia into new shapes asking: How does Frank Miller’s aesthetics of silhouetted bodies reframe Islamophobia in an interpictorial and intermedial discourse of images? To what extent do Miller’s graphic stylizations of Islamophobia remediate elements of his previous work on fictional (super)heroes and historical leaders from Batman to the 300 Spartans? I argue that Miller’s visual narrative participates in the Islamophobic discourse of American popular culture by appropriating a wide array of popular culture visual archives for a propagandistic call for Muslim “Othering.” Holy Terror references news media, films and television series, 9/11 photography, familiar comic book heroes, and, of course, Miller’s own oeuvre. Thus, the graphic novel represents what I conceive as a virtual agora where different media converge to negotiate public discourses on Islamophobia. I will turn to the medium of graphic novels to first reveal how Miller’s narratives and silhouette aesthetics of (super)heroes have become complicit with Islamophobic responses to the crisis of 9/11; second, to trace the discourse of Islamophobia in post-9/11 America in Miller’s work; and, third, to reveal how this discourse interlinks with the patriotic logic of the fight against terrorism.",

        "text": "Frank Miller—the iconic writer/artist of Sin City and 300 brings you a no-holds-barred action thriller for the modern era. Join The Fixer, a brand new, hard-edged hero as he battles terror in the inaugural release from Legendary Comics:\n\n1 See https://www.superrobotmayhem.com/comics/the-fixer/holy-terror/.\n\nFrank Miller’s Holy Terror—coming September.\n\n“Holy Terror,” Super Robot Mayhem\n\n1. Introduction\n\n2. Frank Miller’s Visual Rhetoric of Aestheticized Violence\n\n6Frank Miller’s visual rhetoric of aestheticized violence in Holy Terror goes back to the beginnings of his career. Miller began to make his mark on superhero comics with his visual approach to Daredevil, written by Roger McKenzie in 1979. In Ronin, the six-issue miniseries he did for DC in 1983-4, he started to shift his attention to creative visual storytelling in order to foster a new narrative tone and level of drama. Here, Miller successfully blended Japanese manga techniques (particularly Katsuhiro Otomo’s work on Akira) with Franco-Belgian comic traditions (borrowing from Alain Saint-Organ, Hergé, and others) to evoke a dark, dystopic New York of the future. A few years later, in his epochal Dark Knight miniseries for DC Comics (1986), he found in Batman a superhero whose persona could be translated into an expressionist aesthetics of a shadowy doppelgänger. Miller emphasized the violent roots of the Batman character as markedly different from the campy TV show of the 1960s. The gritty and noir vision of vigilantism of the caped crusader lent itself to an exploration of the narrative potential of silhouette ﬁgures in dark urban environments. Emphasizing the criminal underworld, corrupt cops, bad guys, femme fatales, and heroes of the urban jungle in, for example, his highly lauded crime series Sin City (June 1991 and April 2000), Miller quickly emerged as an iconic artist who excelled in the use of silhouette aesthetics. Sin City explores the narrative potentials of silhouette bodies and urban landscapes, featuring a highly evocative textual and visual style that activates memories, fantasies, dreams, and nightmares associated with global cities.\n\n3. Silhouettes in Transatlantic Contexts\n\n4. Silhouetted Stereotypes of Terror and Islamophobia\n\n5. Visualizations of Terror\n\n16The black and white aesthetics often reflect the world-view of Miller’s characters that live in urban environments dominated by brutality, violence, sexual thrills and situations in which heroes need to take up arms against monolithic adversaries. While Holy Terror features similar tropes of violence, vigilantism, and the fight for freedom and justice with Miller’s earlier work, particularly on the Batman figure, the references to Islamophobia appeared first in his epic work on 300 (1998). The ancient battle from September 480 BC at the arrow coastal pass of Thermopylae (the so-called “Hot Gates”) is turned into a mythical tale of heroism at the birth of ancient democracy against the army of the Persian king Xerxes.\n\nThe Law. We Do not Sacrifice the Rule of Law to the Will and Whim of Men. That is the Old Way. The old, sad, stupid way. The Way of Xerxes and Every Creature like him. A new age is begun. An age of great deeds. An age of reason. An age of Justice. An age of law and all will know that three hundred Spartans gave their last breath to defend it. (300, unpaginated)\n\n6. Visualizations of Terrorists\n\n24Silhouettes, more than other visual stylizations, function along the lines of offering a sense of closure. “Closure is a term you learn in art school. It is the teasing of the viewer’s eye to complete the image you not-so-entirely present. You, the storyteller, leave your piece of work deliberately incomplete, so that the viewer becomes an active, creative participant, finishing the job and thereby enjoying it all the more,” Miller argues in his blog on “When in Doubt, Black it Out” (http://sequart.org/​magazine/​7644/​frank-miller-controversy/​).\n\n25One can trace many interpictorial references to Islamophobia to understand how Miller’s work ties in with other media. For example, a cover of season 4 of the television series Homeland shows dark silhouetted women wearing a burka. These are nameless masses in black with no eyes and personality. Only the white female protagonist in red turns to the viewer with a nervous look. The striking image draws on interpictoral and intertextual references to the little red riding hood fairy tale. Like the innocent girl in the Brother Grimm story, Carrie Mathison, the CIA officer with bipolar disorder, needs to fight the terrorist mastermind Haissan Haqqani in Afghanistan and Pakistan. Other post-9/11 series such as The West Wing and 24 follow intermedial aesthetic strategies to create a specific sense of disorientation and paranoia. However, in contrast to Holy Terror, these series offer an ambivalent space for “interpretation, consent and dissent” that transcends a clear-cut visualization of Islamophobia as Brigitte Findlay has shown in this special issue.\n\n7. Visualizations of Violence against Terrorists\n\n26Let me turn to another image that shows the Fixer and Natalie taking on Muslim terrorists that—among other visual points of reference—reflect the theme of the battle at Thermopylae. Instead of the Spartans with their shields and arrows we see the two heroes shooting and clawing at the enemy in full-blooded anger driven to destroy the enemy. The drawing on the opposite side offers a gruesome fantasy of brutality, rage, and revenge coupled with a reference to the intersection of violence and sexuality. In a key panel of Holy Terror, we see the Fixer hovering over a crowd of terrorists. He shoots them down in a fit of fury. Standing next to him, Natalie Stack engages in a fistfight with terrorists who have bomb belts around their waists. Her silhouetted body emphasizes her large breasts while she manhandles the terrorist. The scene is accompanied by a single blurb that frames traditional diplomatic approaches to conflict of past administrations as weak, appropriate and ineffective. The textual reference can be read as a sick joke on the failure of finding a diplomatic solution. “We engage in postmodern diplomacy” (unpaginated).\n\n28Compared to the caricatures of citizens of Empire City—the innocent victims of the bombing—the representations of the terrorists show a racial profile with specific patterns of a turban, beards, or bad teeth. The only women depicted are female terrorists wearing a black head scarf. The center of the image shows a silhouette firing at the viewer with the onomatopoeic sound effects of a threefold repetition of the word BLAM. “We give them exactly what they want / minus the innocent victims.” Visually, Miller seems to answer Jack Shaheen’s rhetorical question “what is an Arab” (ebook, unpaginated). For the viewer, the identification of terrorists via 14 caricatures creates a kind of index of racial profiles that are likely to incite racism, prejudice and fear.\n\n29The stereotyping has a clearly discriminatory function in the sense of Walter Lippman who described the term in the following fashion:\n\nA pattern of stereotypes is not neutral. It is not merely a way of substituting order for the great blooming, buzzing confusion of reality. It is not merely a short cut. It is all these things and something more. It is the guarantee of our self-respect; it is the projection upon the world of our own sense of our own value, our own position and our own rights. The stereotypes are, therefore, highly charged with the feelings that are attached to them. They are the fortress of our tradition, and behind its defences we can continue to feel ourselves safe in the position we occupy. (qtd. in Dyer 11)\n\n30However, as Richard Dyer argues, “power relations between a dominant and marginal social group need to be taken into consideration. While stereotypes are essential defined… by their social function” (13), Dyer argues that fictional characters are constructed as archetypes, with typical, recognizable and defining traits. The role of stereotypes is “to make the visible invisible, so that there is no danger of it creeping upon us unawares; and to make fast, firm and separate which is in reality fluid and much closer to the norm than the dominant value system cares to admit” (16).\n\n31Miller uses stereotypes of the Muslim “other” as a kind of “short cut” (Dyer 11) in order to take away complexity from the historical, political and cultural encounters surrounding 9/11 and its traumatic aftermath. The negative stereotyping allows Miller to strengthen the values and beliefs of the implied white, Christian, democratically inclined, American readership.\n\n32The fourteen caricatures to identify stereotypical Muslim terrorists interact visually with an earlier index of people that represent the victims of the terror attack in the stylized city of New York. Following an abstract site of destruction with the Fixer and Natalie crouching on a platform among the ruins, the speech blurb says: “THE BASTARDS.” “HOW MANY OF MY NEIGHBORS HAVE THEY MURDERED?” (unpaginated). What follows on the next three pages are 20, 30, 30, 48, 48 and 160 panels that are supposed to be filled by portraits of neighbors. While the first two sets of panels offer a wide array of white people of various gender and age groups, with each portrait fading more and more into lighter gray colors, the remaining panels are left empty to activate the imagination of the readers based on the first 50 visual references.\n\n33The fading panels of Miller’s graphic novel interplay with the archives of American visual culture of 9/11. In newspapers and news media, charts of portraits of missing or dead victims circulated. The appropriation and transformation of powerful cultural photographs in the medium of graphic novels show how Miller resignifies conventions, repertoires and visual traditions for the purpose of spreading a sense of Islamophobia. Miller activates what scholars of iconography have called “Bildgedächtnis” (Poeschel 7, Hebel 416). The photographic portraits of victims of the World Trade Center attacks from the website http://americanbuilt.us are a case in point. On first view, the sheer number and small size of images does not allow to differentiate and identify the individuality of the portraits. The viewer needs to zoom into the collage if he/she wants to recognize individual faces. A similar case can be made for those readers who visited the gallery at the National September 11 Memorial Museum, on the trade center site in Lower Manhattan. Here we find nearly 3000 faces of 9/11 victims. The collection has been called a “tapestry of Grief, Loss, Life and Joy” (David W. Dunlap and Susan C. Beachy). The goal of the museum is to achieve an overwhelming effect on the viewer. The gallery’s walls are filled from floor to ceiling with 3000 5-by-7-inch portraits, arrayed in 250 columns and 12 rows. Only when the viewer moves closer to the walls, he/she can identify individual personalities. Miller reverses this process by starting from simplified black-and-white portraits to ever smaller images until they become empty signifiers. At that state, the viewer is invited to draw on his/her visual media memory to fill in the blanks. Thereby, the identification of the reader with the victims via an emphatic process of filling in the gaps complicates the interpictorial reading. Miller’s technique prepares the reader for an emphatic identification with the brutal revenge of the main characters.\n\n34While the portraits of the victims suggest diversity, the index of terrorists draw on the stereotype of the bearded Arab who deserve to be killed. The other prominent stereotype not part of the 14 panels, the terrorist with a turban, is featured on the opposite page. The opposition of panels depicting Muslims as terrorists and ethnically diverse Americans provides the basis for an illusory sentiment of multicultural unity in the U.S. with Muslims as the racialized “Other” that should be excluded due to their stigma of terrorism. Islamophobic hatred directed at the Muslim “Other” is paradoxically recruited to reinforce paradigms of American multiculturalism.\n\n8. Visualizations of Torture\n\n36In the final part of Holy Terror, Natalie gets caught by the terrorists while she tries to infiltrate the cell dressed like a stereotypical Muslim woman in a black burqa. When captured, she is tied up and appears like a figure about to engage in sadomasochistic practices, as the Muslim terrorists are about to inflict physical pain on her for the sake of pleasure. “THEY USE A LOT MORE ROPE THAN THEY NEED TO,” as Natalie observes. She is tied up in a way to emphasize her protruding breasts while she kneels on the ground. A turbaned terrorist leaves no doubt that the sexual undertones are intended. “AND NO, I DIDN’T KEEP YOU ALIVE JUST TO GLOAT. YOUR BEHEADING WILL MAKE A BITCH OF A VIDEO. MAYBE WE’LL DO YOU NUDE” (unpaginated). The sexualization of the hostage situation in which an attractive white woman is about to be tortured by a cartoonish Arab terrorist has been remediated from Hollywood blockbuster films. For example, James Cameron’s action comedy True Lies shows the terrorist Salim Abu Aziz, leader of the “Crimson Jihad,” in a pseudo-romantic posture using a knife to tease the film’s female star, played by Jamie Lee Curtis. She wears a tight black dress which emphasizes her breasts. Like the panel in Holy Terror, the movie scene is set up to humiliate the female star in front of the terrorist fighters.\n\n37Miller’s reference to sadistic Arabs torturing Americans is reversed in an earlier part of the story. One of the most controversial sequence of images in Holy Terror relates to a scene of torture in which the Fixer and Natalie act as revengeful perpetrators. A terrorist with a belt of explosives is strung up on arms and legs with ropes, his face distorted with pain. His body is horizontally dangling in the air while the Fixer is standing on his back. The pressure is particularly strong since Natalie playfully sits on the Fixer’s shoulder. Natalie is holding the remote control for the detonator searching for the correct frequency. Since the terrorist does not talk, the Fixer breaks his spine. “YOU’LL NEVER WALK AGAIN.” “YOUR EYES ARE NEXT” (unpaginated). Unable to endure the torture any longer, the terrorist reveals the frequency of the detonator. The body is thrown off the roof of a building while Natalie aims the device and presses the red button. Drawn in silhouette, the Fixer and Natalie chat cynically above the letters BOOM: “Yeesh. That’s a lot of chunks of terrorist,” to which the Fixer responds “At least we know they’re the same species” suggesting that it is hard to believe that terrorists can be part of the human race (unpaginated).\n\n40While Miller worked on his graphic novel, public and social media engaged with and disseminated the Abu Ghraib photographs, critical scholarly analyses by Susan Sontag and Mark Danner, Stephen Eisenman, Barbara Ehrenreich and David Levie informed public discourse, and two successful documentary films brought the archive to the attention of a large public: Rory Kennedy’s The Ghosts of Abu Ghraib and Errol Morris Standard Operating Procedure (both 2007). The image of “the hooded man,” in particular in Morris, gained an iconic status. As cultural critic Rob Kroes reminds us, “[f]rom the moment that photographs acquire iconic status and enter the realm of the mass circulation of images, they begin to affect history rather than merely reflecting it” (30). The photograph in question shows an Arab prisoner standing on a box with electric wires attached to his hands and genitals. Should he move or fall off the box, he was told he would be electrocuted. The strategy is to lay the human body in a position of self-torture since any movement to ease the stress is supposed to cause an increase in pain. The image is resonant of Christian iconography with the crucifixion as its iconic tableau (114). By many in the Arab world, the invasion of Iraq was seen as a continuation of the Christian Crusades and a thoroughly imperialistic act. The image of the hooded man seemed like a cynical comment on the link to this part of history.\n\n41Despite the public outcry regarding the use of torture and inhumane treatment of Abu Ghraib prisoners, Miller seems to endorse torture as a means to respond to terrorist attacks suggesting that this practice is part of the so-called “postmodern diplomacy” his heroes are engaging with. Director Kathryn Bigelow’s Hollywood film Zero Dark Thirty (2012) extends the use of torture in a filmic re-enactment suggesting that with the help of torture Osama bin Laden was tracked down by U.S. military forces. In addition, Miller’s remediation of silhouette aesthetics which emerged in the 1920s visual culture of the Harlem Renaissance and has been appropriated by modern media campaigns such as Apple’s advertisements for the iPod (see Mehring, “Visual Rhetoric” 182) can be associated with what Thomas Cripps identified as an aesthetic du cool: “outward detachment, composed choreographic strides, and a self-possessed enigmatic mask over inner urgency” (9). Miller merges an American comic code of communication related to (super)heroes fighting criminals with a political agenda to justify violent responses against terrorism and make it look cool.\n\n9. The Long Shadow of Holy Terror\n\n48 See http://frankmillerink.com/.\n\nMaybe, between bouts of self-pity and all the other tasty tidbits of narcissism you’ve been served up in your sheltered, comfy little worlds, you’ve heard terms like al-Qaeda and Islamicism.\n\nAnd this enemy of mine—not of yours, apparently—must be getting a dark chuckle, if not an outright horselaugh—out of your vain, childish, self-destructive spectacle.\n\nIn the name of decency, go home to your parents, you losers. Go back to your mommas’ basements and play with your Lords of Warcraft.\n\nOr better yet, enlist for the real thing. Maybe our military could whip some of you into shape.\n\nThey might not let you babies keep your iPhones, though. Try to soldier on.\n\n43The racist agenda that is part of Holy Terror by pitting the rightful white American heroic representatives of the democratic land of freedom against the stereotypical brutal, barbaric, inhuman Muslim “others” in a fictional graphic novel resonates with what a key Bush aide explained as the agenda of framing historical events. He argued that the “judicious study of discernible reality” should no longer be the basis of the U.S. after 9/11. Rather, he claimed:\n\nThat’s not the way the world really works anymore. We’re an empire now, and when we act, we create our own reality. And while you’re studying that reality—judiciously, as you will—we’ll act again, creating other new realities, while you can study too, and that’s how things will sort out. We’re history’s actors… and you, all of you, will be left to just study what we do. (Mitchell xviii)\n\n44The advertisement for the then new book addressed comic fans expressively by asking them to “join” the main character on his rampage against stereotypical Muslims in the “war on terror.” The sad irony of the marketing campaign suggests that Miller is fighting the terror attacks of 9/11 2001 with a new call for counter-terrorism in 2011, now in the disguise of the kind of heroes he has helped to revitalize such as the figure of the Dark Knight, Batman. With its provocative nature in the medium of the graphic novel, Holy Terror does not recognize transcultural processes, for example in the field of literature, music or comedy, where “notions of Muslimness are negotiated in ways that can broaden reader’s understanding of the contributions of Muslims to US culture” (Marr 267). As a matter of fact, Holy Terror and its vigilante hero offer an intermedial narrative that erases transcultural processes related to Muslim Americans.\n\n10. Conclusion\n\n47Holy Terror exemplifies how the production of images and the framing of war have undergone a radical transformation in entertainment culture. The circulation of the so-called “hooded man” of Abu Ghraib, often represented in silhouette shape in aestheticized versions of the original photograph, has become an iconic image that “undermined the last remaining alibi for the war on terror in Iraq, namely, that it was a moral crusade to liberate Iraq from tyranny” (Mitchell 4). Miller, in turn, uses images of torture, vigilantism, and lustful revenge to counterbalance the use of the hooded man as a kind of recruiting poster for jihadists throughout the Arab world. In Holy Terror, he creates an intermedial discourse with current political images bringing an “emotional truth” to the fight against terrorism. The use of extreme violence, exaggerated forms of stereotyping through silhouette aesthetics, the celebration of vigilantism, sexism and an endorsement of right-wing approaches to a law-and-order mentality place Holy Terror in a continuity of Miller’s creative output from Ronin, Batman, Sin City and 300 rather than positioning the work as a remarkable racist exception.\n\n48The patriotic agenda behind Holy Terror, however, has changed the perspective on the visual and textual framing in Miller’s previous work. Miller’s oeuvre must be seen in a new light of radical right-wing agendas to endorse nationalism, a racist agenda regarding immigration policies, extreme forms of violence, and states of exception including the use of torture. Silhouettes are successfully employed and exploited in order to reduce complex socio-political, historical and cultural contexts. Post 9/11 Islamophobia in the graphic novel Holy Terror, with its use of silhouettes to reference a tradition of patriotic superheroes and its built-in counter-narrative of stereotyping media images of terrorism, begs us to modify Richard Dyer’s statement that “the effectiveness of stereotypes resides in the way they invoke a consensus” (14) to make room for stereotypes that thrive on in-text dissensus. In the age of fake news, the visual program of “postmodern diplomacy” of Holy Terror turned out to become a visionary tale about a country being pushed towards a politics of “fire and fury.” The use of graphic novels as a call to arms to fight terrorism vigilante-style puts limits on Royal’s assessment that this visual medium has a remarkable democratic fabric woven into its texture."
