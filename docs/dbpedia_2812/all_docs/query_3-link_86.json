His career achievements and service to the University began when he was just a recent graduate. It was during his lifetime of service- he served on the Board of Trustees for an incredible 71 years and was President of the board from 1903 to 1956- that he saw his “big dream” become a reality when he led the relocation of Butler from its old Irvington campus to the ten-times bigger Fairview Park. In his chosen career, he was an award-winning newspaper journalist and Managing Editor at the Indianapolis News for over seven decades and recipient of numerous awards, including the Butler Medal.\n\nPast recipients include:\n\nMark Adler ’99\n\nWilliam Brooks Jr. MBA ’96\n\nEd Carpenter ’03\n\nBrent S.

As a freshman, he was selected by area students to serve as Chairman of the city’s annual celebration honoring Washington’s birthday. During the ceremony, he gave a speech that captivated the audience and inspired a column in the Indianapolis Journal. At the time of his untimely drowning death in the summer of 1900, he was only 19 years old, yet was about to enter his senior year. Joseph Sweeney accomplished an incredible amount as a student in an abbreviated college career.\n\nPast recipients include:\n\nDavid H. Arland ’85\n\nJulie Yancich Beggs ’94\n\nMichael R.

She was the granddaughter of the first Treasurer of the State of Indiana, and the niece of Catharine Merrill, a Professor of English Literature at Butler who was only the second female full professor in the US. She graduated from Butler in 1878, and was a Professor of English Literature at the University from 1907 to 1930, receiving an honorary doctorate of literature in 1928. Graydon served as the Alumni Secretary and Editor of the Alumnal Quarterly from its first edition in 1922 until her retirement in 1929, when she was named Professor Emerita. During World War I, she maintained correspondence with Butler students and alumni serving on the Western Front. She compiled a volume of these letters, including an account of Butler men who had served in the Civil War and the Spanish–American War, and helped raise funds for memorials honoring Butler’s war dead of the Civil War and World War I.\n\nPast recipients include:\n\nKaren Schultz Alter ’85\n\nClarrean Anthony ’38\n\nMichael D.

The Robert Todd Duncan Alumni Achievement Award recognizes those who have earned their degree more than fifteen years prior to the presentation of the award.\n\nRobert Todd Duncan ’25, made his operatic debut in Mascagni’s Cavalleria Rusticana at New York’s Mecca Temple in 1934. In 1935, George Gershwin personally selected Duncan to play the role of Porgy in the first staging of Porgy and Bess, a role he performed more than 1,800 times. His 1936 performance of the role resulted in the first desegregated performance at the National Theatre in Washington, DC. In 1945, he broke the color barrier, becoming the first African American to sing with a major white opera company in the role of Tonio in Leoncavallo’s Pagliacci at the New York City Opera Company. He sang at the White House for three different presidents, and taught voice at Howard University for more than fifty years. In 1983 he received the Alumni Achievement Award from Butler University.\n\nPast recipients include:\n\nJoseph N. Allegretti ’59\n\nCraig A. Anderson, Ph. D. ’76\n\nKevin Ault ’84 MD\n\nThomas A.
