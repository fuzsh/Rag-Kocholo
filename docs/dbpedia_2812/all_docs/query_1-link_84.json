        "text": "Comics legend Frank Miller made waves the other day when he unleashed this screed against Occupy Wall Street. Miller says, among other things, \"This is no popular uprising. This is garbage. And goodness knows they’re spewing their garbage – both politically and physically – every which way they can find.\"\n\nSci-fi author David Brin has his own take - and connects Miller's anti-OWS rant to his defense of Sparta.\n\nFor one thing, \"300\" gave all credit to the Spartans, extolling them as role models and peerless examples of manhood. Adorably macho defenders of freedom.\n\nUh, right. Freedom. Sorry, but the word bears a heavy burden of irony when shouted by Spartans, who maintained one of the worst slave-states ever, treating the vast majority of their people as cattle, routinely quenching their swords in the bodies of poor, brutalized helots... who are never mentioned, even glimpsed, in the romanticized book or movie. Indeed, the very same queen who Frank Miller portrayed as so-earthy, so-kind, was said to be quite brutal with a whip, in real life.\n\nMiller's Spartan warriors honestly and openly conveyed the contempt for civilians that was felt across the ages by all feudal warrior castes. An attitude in sharp contrast to American sympathies, which always used to be about Minuteman farmers and shopkeepers - citizen soldiers - the kind who bravely pick up arms to aid their country, adapting and training under fire. Alas, Frank Miller's book and movie \"300\" ridiculed that kind of soldier...\n\n...even though the first invasion by Persia, ten years earlier - under Xerxes's father - had been defeated by just such a militia army... from Athens... made up of farmers, clerks, tradesmen, artists and mathematicians. A rabble of ill-disciplined \"brawlers\" who, after waiting in vain for promised help from Sparta, finally decided to handle the problem alone. On that fateful day that citizen militia leveled their spears and their thin blue line attacked a professional Persian force many times their number, slaughtering them to the last man on the legendary beach of Marathon.\n\nI will fully confess that I'm very sympathetic to the Occupy movement. To be sure, I'm certain that there are people within it I don't agree with. (And I absolutely condemn the violence by some in the movement as I condemn some of the seemingly unprovoked violence by the police against OWS). I'm certainly not anti-capitalism! Markets are an important tool to improve human welfare. But they're not perfect. Like The Atlantic's Megan McArdle, I am deeply disturbed by the lack of opportunities in the United States for economic advancement. (I'm more worried about income inequality than she is, because I think extreme income inequality also limits opportunities for economic advancement.)\n\nThe contempt that Frank Miller spits out against Occupy Wall Street is very much in the vein of the contempt his Spartans shower at the Athenians. But as Brin points out, real Spartans were slavemongers of the worst sort, living in one of the most stratified societies in human history. Athenians, with their emphasis on democracy and trade (relatively speaking - obviously, they had slaves, too) was a much more freewheeling, diverse, and successful society.\n\nFrank Miller is in Athenian company, though. There were more than a few people in the Athenian aristocracy who admired Sparta for their \"order\" - i.e., for building a society where the poor knew their place, and upstart merchants couldn't earn their way into upper society. As the cream of the crop, they preferred rules that ensured that they would stay at the top and keep the rabble in their place.\n\nTo me and my own observations, Occupy Wall Street is reminscient of the labor riots of the Gilded Age in the United States. It was a time when the economy was changing rapidly, and many hardworking people were driven out of work or to poor economic circumstances while a few lucky people were able to game the system and obtain wealth beyond what they merited. Sure, there's some of the usual left-wing anti-capitalist stuff, but by and large the movement seems to be driven by people who worked hard and played by the rules, and are mad that it turns out that doing so has become a losing game while people with the right political connections get their losses socialized by taxpayers with no consequence.\n\nAs McArdle points out, \"It is hard to get civic engagement, or respect for the law, when the bottom 40% or so feels that the game is rigged.\" What we need in this country is to open up opportunities in this country and make it more like Athens, and less like the oligarchy of Sparta. I'm firmly convinced that this country can do so. We have the means. There are brilliant people developing new technologies that open up wonderful opportunities for economics. What we need is a level playing field so that people who want to get into the market can do so and succeed."
