        "text": "William W. Whitley Citizen-Scholar Prize\n\nAt the Doerr School of Sustainability diploma award ceremony each year in June, a graduate of the Earth Systems Program is awarded the William W. Whitley Citizen-Scholar Prize. The prize honors William Whitley (1925-2001), a Stanford geology alumnus (BS '49). Bill was an active member of the school's Petroleum Investments Committee beginning in 1980, including serving as its chairman from 1986 to 1989.\n\nBill Whitley was widely respected for the quality of his work. He was also respected and loved for the quality of his character, distinguishing himself in a graceful and unassuming manner by always being there for his family, friends, colleagues, and the institutions he supported. In keeping with Bill's spirit, recipients of the William Whitley Citizen-Scholar Prize are chosen both for their impressive academic work and because they give significantly through service to the school and community.\n\nThe Whitley Citizen-Scholar Prize is by nomination only- students may not apply for this award. Awardees receive a cash prize.\n\nTanvi Dutta Gupta, 2024\n\nJonathon Borja, 2023\n\nKendall Matsumoto, 2022\n\nTheo Bamberger, 2021\n\nDevon Burger, 2020\n\nAli Hoffer, 2019\n\nSierra Garcia, 2018\n\nMiller-Marsden Prize for Innovative Research on the Environment\n\nThe Miller-Marsden Prize is named for two former faculty members in the Petroleum Engineering Department, (the late) Professor Frank Miller and (the late) Professor Sully Marsden.\n\nThe award carries a cash prize. Earth Systems students who have undertaken innovative research (internship, masters research, honors) on an environmental topic and who want to submit the written results of that work for prize consideration are invited to do so.\n\nA call for nominations is sent out in early Spring quarter. A self-nomination package should include the research paper and a brief letter defending its \"innovative\" character. All candidates should be prepared to give an oral presentation on the results of their research, as the winner may be asked to do so.\n\nMiller-Marsden Prize Recipients\n\nDakota Riemersma, 2024\n\nSydney Schmitter, 2023\n\nBenji Reade Malgueno, 2022\n\nCaroline Beckman, 2021\n\nManisha Rattu, 2020\n\nHailey Deres, 2019"
