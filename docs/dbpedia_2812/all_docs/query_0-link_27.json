He attended Deerfield Academy and worked on the family farm until he received an appointment to the U.S. Military Academy at West Point at the age of twenty. He graduated with the Class of 1849 and was commissioned a second lieutenant in the Artillery Branch.\n\nBefore the Civil War, Saxton served in the 3rd Artillery in Florida against the Seminole Indians, and then on General George B. McClellan’s staff surveying the uncharted Rocky Mountains ahead of the Northern Pacific Railroad. From 1855 to 1859, he served at several posts with the Coastal Survey in the East. It was during this period of time he made improvement in the instruments for deep-sea soundings. He patented a self-registering thermostat which bears his name. In 1859, Saxton became an instructor of artillery tactics at West Point.\n\nWhen the Civil War began in 1861, Saxton was in command of an artillery detachment at the St. Louis Arsenal. After supporting General Nathaniel Lyon in dispersing the Confederate sympathizing Missouri State Guard at Camp Jackson, Saxton became General Lyon’s Chief Quartermaster. Later, he joined General George B. McClellan’s staff in West Virginia and later accompanied the Port Royal Expedition as Quartermaster. He was appointed brigadier general of U.S. volunteers as of April 15, 1862, and commanded the defenses of Harpers Ferry in May and June, where he earned the Medal of Honor for “Distinguished gallantry and good conduct in the defense.” General Saxton was awarded the Medal of Honor on April 25, 1893.\n\nFor the remainder of the Civil War, Saxton commanded at various locations in the South with numerous titles. His principal occupation was the enlistment and organization of Negroes, principally ex-slaves, into the Federal Army. At the end of the war, he became acting assistant commissioner for the states of South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida in the newly created Freedman’s Bureau. In January 1866, Major General Rufus Saxton was mustered out of the volunteer service. He lived in Washington, D.C., until his death on February 23, 1908. He was eighty-three years old. He is buried in Arlington National Cemetery and is honored with a private memorial.\n\nHe signed his SAR application as “Rufus Saxton, Brevet Major General, U.S. Volunteers,” in January 1893. His SAR National number is 6917 and his District of Columbia Society number is 417. His application lists two SAR patriot ancestors: his great-grandfather David Saxton (Sexton) of Deerfield, Massachusetts, a private in Massachusetts Militia, Magistrate, and Member of the Massachusetts Legislature; and his great-grandfather Salmon White of Whately, Massachusetts, a sergeant in the 6th Massachusetts, later an ensign and lieutenant in the Massachusetts Regiment.\n\nOrlando Bolivar Willcox was born on April 26, 1823, in Detroit, Michigan. He graduated eighth in his class from West Point in 1847. Following graduation, he served in garrisons in Mexico City and Cuernavaca at the close of Mexican War and then served in garrisons in the New Mexico Territory, Massachusetts, and Florida. Willcox resigned his commission in 1857 and returned to Detroit to practice law. At the start of the Civil War, Willcox returned to the Army in 1861 as colonel of the 1st Michigan Volunteer Infantry.\n\nAt the First Battle of Bull Run or First Manassas, Willcox was wounded and captured while in command of a brigade and remained a prisoner for more than a year. On the day of his release, August 19, 1862, he was commissioned a brigadier general of volunteers to rank from the date of the battle in which he had been captured the previous year and was given command of the 1st Division of Ambrose Burnside’s IX Corps. He led the Division, and sometimes the Corps itself, at Sharpsburg, Fredericksburg, Knoxville, and during Grant’s Overland Campaign against Richmond in the summer of 1864.\n\nWillcox was brevetted major general in both the Regulars and the Volunteers. In 1895, after thirty-four years, he was awarded the Medal of Honor for his “most distinguished gallantry” at the battle of Manassas. His citation states that he “led repeated charges until wounded and taken prisoner.” He was mustered out of service in January 1866 and returned to Detroit to resume his law practice.\n\nWith the enlargement of the Regular Army in July 1866, Willcox was reappointed as a colonel of the 29th US Infantry. He was transferred to the 12th U.S. Infantry in 1869 and served in San Francisco almost continuously until 1878, when he assumed command of the Department of Arizona during a period when Apache warfare was at its zenith. Willcox remained in this post until 1882. The town of Willcox, Arizona, was later named for him.\n\nHe retired from the Army in 1887. Two years later, Willcox served as the governor of the U.S. Soldiers’ Home in Washington, D.C. General Willcox joined the District of Columbia SAR and served as its fifth president from 1896 to 1897. His SAR National number is 1981 and his D.C. Society number is 181. He died at the age of eighty-four on May 10, 1907, in Coburg, Ontario, Canada, of acute bronchitis. Brigadier General Willcox is buried in Arlington National Cemetery.\n\nByron Mac Cutcheon was born on May 11, 1836, in Pembroke, Merrimack County, New Hampshire. He was orphaned at an early age, attended local schools, worked in the cotton mill to earn money, entered Pembroke Academy, taught school for several years, and then moved to Ypsilanti, Michigan. In 1855, he was principal of the Birmingham Academy in Oakland County and then graduated from the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor in 1861. Before graduating, Cutcheon had become the principal and was a professor of ancient languages, higher mathematics, and mental and moral philosophy in the Ypsilanti High School in 1861 and 1862.\n\nHe was principal of the Ypsilanti High School when he answered President Lincoln’s call and enlisted in the Union Army and help raise a company for the Twentieth Regiment, Michigan Infantry who mustered him into service as a second lieutenant. He quickly rose in rank.\n\nDuring his service, Cutcheon fought in twenty-five major battles and engagements. He was wounded at the Battle of Spotsylvania Court House while leading a charge and was hospitalized for about two months. For his gallant conduct on this occasion, he received a commission as brevet colonel. For his conspicuous gallantry at the battle of the Wilderness at Horseshoe Bend, Kentucky, on March 13, 1865, Cutcheon received a commission as a brevet brigadier general. Byron Cutcheon commanded the Second Brigade, Second Division, Ninth Army Corps, from October 16, 1864, until his resignation on March 6, 1865. He returned to Michigan to study law and graduated from the University of Michigan Law School in 1866.\n\nIn 1882, Cutcheon was elected as a Republican from Michigan’s 9th Congressional district to the Forty-eighth Congress and served for three succeeding Congresses from March 4, 1883, to March 3, 1891. In the Fifty-second Congress, Byron Cutcheon served as chairman of the Committee on Military Affairs. He was defeated in reelection in 1890 to the Fifty-second Congress.\n\nMajor Byron M. Cutcheon was awarded a Medal of Honor by Congress on June 29, 1891, “for distinguished gallantry at the Battle of Horseshoe Bend, Ky., May 10, 1863.” His citation reads, “Distinguished gallantry in leading his regiment in a charge on a house occupied by the enemy.”\n\nWhile he was a member of Congress, Cutcheon became a member of the District of Columbia SAR. His National number is 2123 and his D.C. Society number is 323.\n\nPresident Harrison appointed Byron Cutcheon as a civilian member of the Board of Ordnance and Fortifications in July 1891 and Cutcheon served until March 25, 1895. He returned to Michigan and resumed his law practice in Grand Rapids. He also served as an editorial writer for the and from 1895 until 1897. He died on April 12, 1908, in Ypsilanti at the age of seventy-one and is buried in Highland Cemetery.\n\nGeorge Greenville Benedict was born on December 10, 1826, in Burlington, Vermont. He was the son of Professor George W. Benedict. He writes on his SAR application that his father was a soldier in the War of 1812. Not much is known about his personal life. He graduated from the University of Vermont in 1847. At the age of thirty-five, Benedict enlisted for the Union army as a private in the late summer of 1862. His unit was mustered out 1865 and George G. Benedict left the service as a lieutenant colonel.\n\nAs a member of Company C, 12th Vermont Infantry 2Lt. George Benedict was present the battle at Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. On the last day of the battle during Pickett’s Charge, the 13th and 16th Vermont Infantry advanced to the front in a flanking movement on General Pickett’s forces. While this was happening, Lt. Benedict braved a murderous fire of grape and canister to deliver orders on the field. It is said that he walked calmly along the line with his back to the enemy until he had straightened out the Union line and reformed them properly for combat. It was for this action that he was awarded the Medal of Honor, one of sixty-three men to be so honored during the period from July 1 to July 3, 1863.\n\nBenedict wrote letters back home that gave the folks a firsthand account of a soldier’s life in the Civil War. His letters describe military life, including picket duty, food, pay, and health, as well as news of fighting and news about friends. The book, , is a collection of his thirty-one letters written between 1863 and 1864 to his wife, Sarah Benedict, at Belvidere, Allegany County, New York, and one letter from James Hall to Sarah Benedict telling her that her husband had been severely wounded. The book is edited by Eric Ward.\n\nOn the family tombstone, there is a plaque that reads “George Greenville Benedict, 54 years Editor of the Burlington Free Press, 41 years as Clerk of the College Street Church, A Volunteer in the War for the Union, 42 years as a Trustee of the University of Vermont.”\n\nHe signed his SAR application with his full name on April 1, 1889, and does not indicate an occupation. His National number is 2703 and his Vermont Society number is 3. His application lists his SAR patriot ancestor as the Rev. Abner Benedict who “was a Chaplain in the Revolutionary Army serving in the battles of White Plains and Harlem, NY.” In February 1898, at the age of seventy years old, George Benedict submitted a supplemental application listing two patriots: Captain Stephen Dewey and his son, Private Stephen Dewey, Jr. Both men served in the Massachusetts Infantry. On his supplemental application, he writes his occupation as “Journalist.”\n\nLieutenant Colonel George Benedict died on April 8, 1907, in Camden, North Carolina, at the age of eighty, and is buried in Greenmount Cemetery in Burlington, Vermont, only a short distance from the grave of Ethan Allen.\n\nClinton Albert Cilley was born on February 16, 1837, in Rockingham County, New Hampshire. Carol Cepregi, Deputy Director of Operations for the Congressional Medal of Honor Society, responded to a request of information on Clinton A. Cilley with the following: “I found a newspaper article from the St. Paul Sunday Pioneer Press dated May 28, 1972. In it, it describes Professor Cilley, as president of the new Free Will Baptist Seminary, in Wasioja, Minnesota the day after the firing on of Ft. Sumter, as he spoke to the students, and, according to the article, said, “Would it were God’s will that peace prevailed, but now we can do no other than serve our Union cause. Are you with me?” This began one of the first student marches in America, not in protest, but to enlist in the Union Army at a tiny building which is now a museum in the town. The seminary burned down in 1905.”\n\nClinton A. Cilley was serving as a captain in Company C, 2nd Minnesota Infantry in the Union Army at the Battle of Chickamauga, Georgia, September 19 through 20, 1863, when he earned the Medal of Honor. The citation reads “Seized the colors of a retreating regiment and led it into the thick of the attack.” He was subsequently promoted to brevet colonel in the Union Army. He is the second SAR compatriot Medal of Honor from that campaign; the other is Horace Porter. Colonel Cilley was awarded the Medal of Honor on June 12, 1895.”\n\nClinton A. Cilley moved to Lenoir and Hickory in western North Carolina at the end of the Civil War and became regional administrator for the Freedmen’s Bureau. Cilley became very popular as a lawyer in Lenoir, North Carolina, where he was elected one of the town’s first mayors. He later became a judge and a politician. Cilley married Emma Harper, daughter of James C. Harper, former member of the North Carolina House of Representatives, and then was later elected himself to the House of Representatives of the 42nd U.S. Congress.\n\nClinton A. Cilley became a member of the New Hampshire SAR in 1894. His National number is 7521 and his Society number is 21. His SAR patriot ancestor was Joseph Cilley who was “appoint Major in Enoch Poor’s Regiment on May 24, 1775 under recommendation of the Committee on Safety.” Later, Colonel Joseph Cilley was appointed to the command of the 1st Massachuesetts Continental Regiment. Joseph Cilley survived both the battles of the American campaign in Canada and the smallpox epidemic, fought and escaped with his regiment in the Battle of Long Island; tasted victory at the Battles of Trenton and Princeton, was assigned to General Sullivan’s Brigade and participated in the Battles of Saratoga.\n\nPersonal papers of Clinton and his wife may be found in the library of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. The Catawba County Museum of History contains the Clinton Cilley Collection of Civil War artifacts. He died on May 9, 1900, at the age of sixty-three in North Carolina and is buried in Oakwood Cemetery Hickory, Catawba County, North Carolina.\n\nHorace Porter was born in Huntingdon, Pennsylvania, on April 15, 1837. He was the son of David R. Porter, a wealthy ironmaster who later served as the governor of Pennsylvania, and grandson of Andrew Porter (1743-1813), an officer in the Continental Army during the War of Independence. In 1854, Horace Porter studied for a year at the Lawrence Scientific School of Harvard University and then entered the United States Military Academy at West Point. He graduated in 1860, third in his class.\n\nPorter served in the Union army in the Civil War, reaching the rank of brigadier general. He received the Medal of Honor at the Battle of Chickamauga, which occurred on September 19 and 20, 1863. The battle took place approximately three to four miles downstream on the Tennessee River from Chattanooga. On September 20, 1863, Porter was serving as a captain in the Ordnance Department. His citation that accompanies the award reads, “While acting as a volunteer aide, at a critical moment when the lines were broken, rallied enough fugitives to hold the ground under heavy fire long enough to effect the escape of wagon trains and batteries.” In the last year of the war, he served as a personal aide to the General-in-Chief Ulysses S. Grant.\n\nFrom 1869 to 1873, Porter served as Grant’s personal secretary in the White House. Porter resigned from the army in December 1873 and became vice president of the Pullman Palace Car Company.

He grew up on a farm and was apprenticed to a physician when he was fourteen years old. Stanley was interested in a military career, however, and was excited to receive an appointment to the U.S. Military Academy at West Point.\n\nDavid S. Stanley graduated from West Point in 1852 (the class known for having produced fifteen future generals), and became an officer in the 2nd U.S. Dragoons. He went to the Western frontier to survey railroad routes in Arkansas, California, Texas, and Kansas. He refused a commission in the Confederate army in 1861, and fought for the Union instead.\n\nStanley was stationed at Fort Washita in Indian Territory at the beginning of the Civil War. He led his men to Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. In doing so, he fought at several battles in Missouri, including the Battle of Wilson’s Creek, where he guarded the supply trains.

He later commanded the 22nd U.S. Infantry, primarily serving in the Dakota Territory until 1874. During this time, while skirmishing against the Sioux, Stanley encountered another Civil War officer, Lieutenant Colonel George Custer. General Stanley had to officially reprimand Custer while under his command for a series of offences.\n\nIn 1873, General Stanley commanded the Yellowstone Expedition through several uncharted areas. His favorable reports on the country led to the subsequent settlement of the region.\n\nIn 1870, Stanley and his regiment were reassigned to Texas to suppress Indian raids in the western portion of the state. He was ordered to Santa Fe, New Mexico, in 1882, and placed in command of the District of New Mexico.

He is buried at Fort Custer, Montana. Fort Custer was abandoned in 1898. In the Fort’s interment records there is an entry for the interment of 1st Lt Powhatan Clarke. The Fort Custer internment records show that in October 9, 1934, he was “disinterred and sent to St. Louis, MO.” He is buried in Calvary Cemetery, St. Louis, Missouri. His wife and son are buried with him.\n\nPowhatan H. Clark signed his SAR application and became a member in January 1891. His National number is 1976. He was a member of the District of Columbia SAR. His D.C. Society number is 176. Powhatan Clark lists three SAR patriot ancestors on his application: “James Clarke, of “Keswick,” Powhatan County, Virginia, commanded a regiment at the Battle of Craney Island (War of 1812), and, as a youth, served in the Revolution; Robert Goode (1743-1809), of Whitby, Chesterfield County, Virginia, “Captain, Chesterfield Militia, 1775-1776, and later Major and Colonel of Militia, Acting Governor of Virginia, 1792; and Richard Bland (1710-1760, of “Jordans,” Virginia, “the Cato of the Revolution,” Member of all the early Virginia Conventions; Delegate to Continental Congress, 1774.”\n\nAdolphus Washington Greely was born on March 27, 1844, in Newburyport, Massachusetts.

He served throughout the Civil War, seeing action in several major battles. He sustained serious wounds on three occasions, and achieved the rank of brevet major of volunteers by the end of the Civil War. In 1886, he joined the regular Army as a second lieutenant in the 36th Infantry. In March 1873, Greely was promoted to first lieutenant in the Cavalry and served mainly in the West and in Washington, D.C.\n\nGreely volunteered and was named head of the Lady Franklin Bay Expedition in 1881. The purpose of the expedition was to establish one of a chain of meteorological observation stations as part of the First International Polar Year. In crossing Ellesmere Island, two members of the expedition managed to get farther north, at 83 degrees, 24 minutes north latitude, than any previous attempts.\n\nThe expedition established itself for two years of weather observations, at the end of which it made its way on small boats through two-hundred miles of treacherous Arctic waters to its assigned rendezvous with a relief ship, the . Weeks and then months passed, with the party unaware that had been crushed by icebergs. By the time another relief expedition arrived to rescue them, only Greeley and six of the original team had survived: nineteen men had perished from drowning, hypothermia, or starvation. At first Greely was criticized, but he was absolved after an investigation found that he had acted properly. The most definitive story of this remarkable journey can be found in Alden Todd’s book, . Adolphus Greely was promoted to captain in 1886.\n\nIn March 1887, President Grover Cleveland appointed Captain Greely as the Chief Signal Officer of the U.S. Army with the rank of brigadier general. During his tenure, nearly twenty-thousand miles of telegraph lines consisting of land cables, submarine cables, and wireless telegraphy were constructed, operated, and maintained by the Army in the U.S., Cuba, Puerto Rico, Alaska, the Philippines, and other locations. General Greely was a delegate to the International Telegraph Conference in London and the International Wireless Telegraph Congress in Berlin in 1903. In 1906, he was promoted to the rank of major general and oversaw the relief operation after the San Francisco earthquake and resultant fire.

General Greely was a frequent contributor to the National Geographic Magazine from the earliest days and lectured on many occasions before SAR members in Washington.\n\nIn 1905, Adolphus Greely accepted the honor of serving as the first president of the Explorers Club. In 1922, he was awarded an honorary fellowship and the Daly Medal by the American Geographical Society.\n\nThe award of the Medal of Honor presented to Greely, on his ninety-first birthday in 1935, would have been in clear violation of the revised 1916 Army warrant requiring combat action and risk of life “above and beyond the call of duty,” except that it was specifically authorized by a special Act of Congress. His award was the second Army presentation contrary to the combat requirement, as eight years earlier in 1927, the Medal had been presented to Charles Lindbergh, an Army reservist but not on active duty, for his solo transatlantic flight.\n\nGeneral Greely’s SAR National number is 1914 and his District of Columbia Society number is 114. His SAR patriot ancestor, Sergeant Joseph Greely, was a Minuteman who marched to Lexington on the alarm on April 19, 1775, and later contributed supplies to the Continental Troops. Greely’s SAR application shows that he resigned on March 14, 1914. He was “Reinstated April 3, 1935 and made a Member Emeritus by the District of Columbia SAR Board of Management.”\n\nMajor General Adolphus W. Greely died on October 20, 1935, at the age of ninety-one, less than a year after being awarded the Medal of Honor.

Gresham died on September 2, 1926, in San Diego, California, at the age of seventy-four. He is buried in the San Francisco National Cemetery, a U.S. National Cemetery, located in the Presidio of San Francisco, California.\n\nTheodore Roosevelt was born at 28 East 20th Street in the city of New York on October 27, 1858. He graduated Phi Beta Kappa and from Harvard in 1880, and entered Columbia Law School.

His SAR patriot ancestor was Timothy Matlack (1736 – 1829), of Pennsylvania, “the fighting Quaker,” member of the Committee of Safety; colonel of militia; deputy in the State Conference of 1776; delegate of the Continental Congress, 1780-1787; secretary of the Council of State; and master of rolls, 1781.” He signed his SAR application in April 1891, as B. A. Byrne, U.S. Army, 1st Lieutenant – 6th Regiment of Infantry.\n\nPlease note that there is a discrepancy in the spelling of Byrne’s middle name between open literature and his SAR application and tombstone. His SAR application, in his handwriting, shows his name to be Bernard Abert Byrne. He writes that he was “born in the Town of Newport, County of Campbell, State of Kentucky.” Open literature says his middle name to be Albert and that he was “born in Newport Barracks, VA.” There was a Newport Barracks at this time, but it was located in Kentucky across the river from Cincinnati. His SAR application lists his parents as Bernard M. Byrne and Louisa Abert and his grandparents as Col. John James Abert and Ellen Matlack Stretch. Further, U.S. Pensioners, 1818-1872, records for Bernard M. Byrne, MD, show his widow to be Louisa Abert Byrne.\n\nByrne died on February 28, 1910, at the age of fifty-six, in California and is buried in Arlington National Cemetery. His tombstone reads: “MEDAL OF HONOR; BERNARD ABERT BYRNE; LIEUT. COLONEL, U.S. ARMY; OCT. 19, 1853, FEB. 28, 1910; ‘Well done, good and faithful servant.’”\n\nFrank Friday Fletcher was born on November 23, 1855, in Oskaloosa, Iowa, and graduated from the United States Naval Academy in 1875. After his first cruise on the USS, he was commissioned an ensign in 1876. In 1878, he participated in a world cruise aboard the USS Ticonderoga​ under Commodore Robert Wilson Shufeldt. Fletcher was later assigned to the Bureau of Ordnance where he developed the Fletcher breech mechanism that increased the speed of rapid-fire guns.\n\nHe developed the first doctrines for torpedo warfare while commanding the torpedo boat in 1893. In 1896, Fletcher was assigned to the battleship USS, but was absent when the ship was blown up in Havana Harbor in February 1898, triggering the Spanish-American War.\n\nIn 1910, he was appointed an aide to the secretary of the Navy. In October 1911, he was promoted to rear admiral and until 1913, commanded divisions of the Atlantic Fleet. In September 1914, Admiral Fletcher was named commander of the Atlantic Fleet and served as an admiral until the completion of that assignment.\n\nAs commander of U.S. Naval Forces on the east coast of Mexico in 1914, he occupied the city of Vera Cruz, and was awarded the Medal of Honor for his heroic leadership. His citation reads “For distinguished conduct in battle, engagements of Vera Cruz, 21 and 22 April 1914. Under fire, Rear Adm. Fletcher was eminent and conspicuous in the performance of his duties; was senior officer present at Vera Cruz, and the landing and the operations of the landing force were carried out under his orders and directions. In connection with these operations, he was at times on shore and under fire.” Admiral Fletcher was awarded the Medal of Honor on December 4, 1915.\n\nAfter returning to shore duty in June 1916 and returned to the rank of rear admiral, Fletcher served on the Navy General Board and on the War Industries Board during World War I until his retirement in 1919, earning Distinguished Service Medals from the Navy and the Army for his meritorious service during the First World War.\n\nAdmiral Fletcher was twice recalled for temporary active duty, and in 1925 sat on a board that explored how aircraft could be most effective in national defense.\n\nFrank Friday Fletcher joined the District of Columbia SAR in 1909. His National number is 19721 and his D.C. Society number is 1096. He listed his residence as U.S. Navy and occupation as Naval Officer. His SAR patriot ancestor is Ensign Archibald Fletcher who served in the 3rd Company of the 2nd Battalion of the Bedford County Pennsylvania Militia. One of his supplemental SAR ancestors was Captain Samuel Miller who served with the 8th Pennsylvania Regiment in the Continental Line. While at Valley Forge, he was ordered on February 10, 1778, to Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania, on recruiting duty. While returning, he was killed in a fight with the Indians on July 9, 1778. A second supplemental SAR ancestor was John Jack, a militiaman in Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania, in Captain Joseph Eager’s Company in Colonel Archibald Lackey’s Pennsylvania Regiment. Jack was wounded in the engagement at Ash Swamp during the Battle of the Short Hills in June 1777 near Woodbridge, New Jersey. In 1781, Jack served in Captain Andrew Searingen’s Company of Rangers on the frontier of Washington County, Pennsylvania.\n\nThe USS (DD-445), named for Admiral Frank F. Fletcher, was the lead Fletcher-class destroyer. The ship served in the Pacific during World War II. She received fifteen battle stars in World War II and five for Korean War service.\n\nAdmiral Fletcher’s nephew, Frank Jack Fletcher, was also awarded the Medal of Honor for distinguished conduct during the Vera Cruz operation, was the senior officer present during the battles of Coral Sea and Midway in World War II, and retired with the rank of admiral, passing away in 1973. The second USS (DD-992) was named in his honor.\n\nDouglas MacArthur was born on January 26, 1880, in the Little Rock Arsenal, Little Rock, Arkansas. He was the son of Lieutenant General Arthur MacArthur, Jr., who was also a recipient of the Medal of Honor during the Civil War in the Battle of Missionary Ridge in November 1863.\n\nMacArthur graduated from the U.S. Military Academy at West Point in 1903 as valedictorian of his ninety-three-man class. During his life, General MacArthur took part in three major wars (World War I, World War II, and the Korean War) and rose to the rank of General of the Army, one of only five people to hold that rank in U.S. history. He served his country for over sixty years.\n\nGeneral MacArthur was awarded the Medal of Honor for his actions early in World War II in the Philippines and on the Bataan Peninsula. The citation dated 01 April 1942 accompanying the award reads, “For conspicuous leadership in preparing the Philippine Islands to resist conquest, for gallantry and intrepidity above and beyond the call of duty in action against invading Japanese forces, and for the heroic conduct of defensive and offensive operations on the Bataan Peninsula. He mobilized, trained, and led an army which has received world acclaim for its gallant defense against a tremendous superiority of enemy forces in men and arms. His utter disregard of personal danger under heavy fire and aerial bombardment, his calm judgment in each crisis, inspired his troops, galvanized the spirit of resistance of the Filipino people, and confirmed the faith of the American people in their Armed Forces.”\n\nDouglas MacArthur’s SAR National number is 65843 and his Empire State Society number is 7723. His SAR patriot ancestor is John Barney, of Taunton, Massachusetts, who served as a private in the Massachusetts Militia. Compatriot Douglas MacArthur selected the design for the Patriot Medal just prior to his death. He received the first medal, presented posthumously at his tomb in Norfolk, Virginia, on October 19, 1964, where it is on permanent display. MacArthur’s application notes that his military service was in World War I, World War II, and the Korean War. The general did not sign his SAR application, but it was attested to by Murray Hulbert, U.S. District Judge, from a letter from MacArthur “from his military headquarters in the Pacific theatre of war” received on July 16, 1945. General Douglas MacArthur died on April 6, 1964; he and his wife are buried in Norfolk, Virginia.\n\nJoseph Jacob “Joe” Foss was born in a farm house on April 17, 1915, outside Sioux Falls, South Dakota. At the age of twelve, he visited a local airfield to see Charles Lindbergh on tour with the Spirit of St. Louis. Four years later, he and his father paid to take their first airplane ride. Two years later, in 1933, his father died and young Joe took over running the family farm. Within another two years, dust storms of the Depression had destroyed the crops and the stock.\n\nBy 1940, Foss had earned a degree from the University of South Dakota and a pilot’s certificate. He enlisted in the Marine Reserves to join the Naval Aviation Cadet program. Upon completion, Foss was designated a naval aviator and commission as a second lieutenant.\n\nBy October 1942, he was executive officer of VMF-121 on Guadalcanal. In a short period of time, “engaging in almost daily combat with the enemy from 9 October to 19 November 1942, Capt. Foss personally shot down twenty-three Japanese planes and damaged others.” He would become the first Marine to become an “Ace in a Day.” A few days later, he would have twenty-six aerial victories equaling Eddie Rickenbacker’s World War I record. In May 1943, President Roosevelt personally presented Foss with the Congressional Medal of Honor for his outstanding heroism, courage, and leadership. The next month, Captain Foss’ image graced the cover of magazine, where he was identified as “America’s No. 1 Ace.”\n\nAfter the war, Foss capitalized on his name recognition by starting a charter flying service and flight instruction school. He helped organize the South Dakota Air National Guard, commanded the Guard’s 175th Fighter Interceptor Squadron as a lieutenant colonel, and rose to the rank of brigadier general.\n\nIn 1948, he was elected to the South Dakota Legislature as a Republican. During the Korean War, Colonel Foss was called to active duty with the U.S. Air Force and served as a Director of Operations and Training for the Central Air Defense Command. In 1954, he was elected as the governor of South Dakota, the youngest governor in the history of the state, and two years later was elected to a second term. After serving two two-year terms, he ran for Congress against George McGovern, the future Democratic presidential nominee, and was defeated.\n\nFoss followed his political career by becoming the first commissioner of the American Football League in 1960, a position he held for six years. During that time, he signed a multi-year, multi-million dollar television contract with ABC and advocated an association with the National Football League under a single commissioner while hoping to keep the leagues’ identities separate. He resigned as AFL commissioner on his fifty-first birthday. Less than two months later, the League announced plans to merge with the NFL in 1970.\n\nJoseph Foss became the first host of “The American Sportsman” from 1964 to 1967, and his own syndicated television show, “Joe Foss: Outdoorsman,” from 1967 to 1974.\n\nIn the early 1980s, Foss retired to Arizona and soon accepted the position of president of the National Rifle Association (NRA) in 1988, which he held until 1990.\n\nToday, his legacy lives on through the Joe Foss Institute founded by him and his wife, Didi Foss. The Joe Foss Institute is dedicated to promoting patriotism, public service, integrity, and an appreciation for America’s freedoms. Its goal is to instill these values by making presentations to one-million young people each year. Veteran volunteers present to K-12 schools and a variety of youth groups a no-cost, thirty- to fifty-minute presentation. In 2008, the “Veteran’s Inspiring Patriotism” program was presented in thirty-eight states. In addition, three students were awarded $5,000 scholarships for submitting winning essays describing what patriotism means to them.\n\nJoseph Jacob Foss’ SAR National number is 51396. He was a member of the South Dakota Society, number 172. His SAR patriot ancestor is Rufus Cady, Sergeant, Massachusetts Troops. Foss signed his SAR application on April 19, 1943. Brigadier General Foss died on New Year’s Day, 2003, at the age of eighty-seven in Scottsdale, Arizona, and was buried at Arlington National Cemetery on January 21, 2003.\n\nTheodore Roosevelt, Jr. was the son of President Theodore Roosevelt. He was born on September 13, 1887, at the family estate in Oyster Bay, New York. Roosevelt graduated from Harvard University in 1908 and entered the business world in the steel and carpet industries before becoming a branch manager of an investment bank.\n\nAfter service as an officer and rising to the rank of lieutenant colonel during World War I, Roosevelt began his political career in the New York State Assembly. He later was to serve as assistant secretary of the Navy, the governor of Puerto Rico from 1929 to 1932, and the governor General of the Philippines from 1932 until 1933. He resigned and returned to the U.S. shortly after his cousin, Franklin D. Roosevelt, was elected President of the United States. He served as Vice President at Doubleday Publishing Company, later serving as chairman of the board of the American Express Company, as vice president for Boy Scouts of America, and as president of the National Health Council.\n\nRoosevelt returned to active duty in April 1941 and was placed in command of the 26th Infantry Regiment, 1st Infantry Division: the same group in which he fought during the First World War. Late in 1941, he was promoted to the rank of brigadier general. Throughout World War II, Theodore Roosevelt, Jr. suffered from heart trouble and arthritis problems which caused him to walk with a cane. He saw action in northern Africa, Sicily, and the mainland of Italy.\n\nIn 1944, General Eisenhower assigned Roosevelt to England to help lead the Normandy invasion on June 6, 1944. On D-Day, Brigadier General Theodore Roosevelt, Jr. led the first wave of the U.S. 4th Infantry Division’s landing at Utah Beach and earned the Medal of Honor. His Medal of Honor citation reads in part that “he repeatedly led groups from the beach, over the seawall and established them inland. His valor, courage, and presence in the very front of the attack and his complete unconcern at being under heavy fire inspired the troops to heights of enthusiasm and self-sacrifice. Although the enemy had the beach under constant direct fire, Brig. Gen. Roosevelt moved from one locality to another, rallying men around him, directed and personally led them against the enemy. Under his seasoned, precise, calm, and unfaltering leadership, assault troops reduced beach strong points and rapidly moved inland with minimum casualties. He thus contributed substantially to the successful establishment of the beachhead in France.”\n\nOne month after the landing at Utah Beach, Roosevelt died of a heart attack in France. He is buried at the American cemetery in Normandy, next to his brother, Quentin, a World Was I Air Corps pilot who was shot down and killed behind enemy lines on July 14, 1918.\n\nTheodore Roosevelt, Jr.’s SAR National number is 32876 and his Empire State Society number is 3526. His SAR patriot ancestor is Jacobus I. Roosevelt, who served as commissary in the New York Troops during the Revolutionary War. He signed his SAR application on June 10, 1919. Attached to the last page of Roosevelt’s SAR application is a newspaper clipping of unknown origin with a handwritten date of “9/20/44” entitled “Gen. Roosevelt’s Widow Presented Medal of Honor.” Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson presented the award to Roosevelt’s widow. Also attending the presentation were “Gen. George C. Marshall, chief of staff, and Gen. H. H. Arnold, commander of the Army Air Forces. The War Department said that the award had been recommended prior to Roosevelt’s death in Normandy on July 12.”\n\nRobert Hugo Dunlap was born on October 19, 1920, in Abingdon, Illinois. He graduated from Abingdon High School in 1938. In May 1942, he graduated with a degree of Bachelor of Arts degree from Monmouth College in Monmouth, Illinois, where he majored in Economics and Business Administration and minored in Mathematics. While at Monmouth College, Dunlap played on the football team and ran track. He also served as treasurer of the student body in his senior year.\n\nWhile attending Monmouth College, he enlisted in the Marine Corps Reserve. Upon graduation, he was called to active duty and assigned to the Officers Candidates Class at Quantico, Virginia. On July 18, 1942, Robert H. Dunlap was commissioned a second lieutenant. On November 23, 1942, he graduated from Parachute Training School. As a first lieutenant, he took part in the invasions of Vella Lavella and Bougainville in the Solomon Islands during the latter part of 1943.\n\nFirst Lieutenant Dunlap returned to the United States in the spring of 1944 to join the 5th Marine Division then being formed. As a combat-experienced officer he became a machine gun platoon leader in Company G, 3rd Battalion, 26th Marines. A few months later, he departed for combat duty for the second time. He was promoted to captain in October 1944.\n\nAs Commanding Officer, Company C, 1st Battalion, 26th Marines, 5th Marine Division, during the Iwo Jima campaign, on the day following the original landing of February 19, 1945, Captain Dunlap led his company through heavy artillery, mortar, rifle, and machine gun fire in a determined advance off the low ground uphill toward the protection of the steep cliffs. When the enemy fire finally became too intense to advance any farther toward the caves located high to the front, Captain Dunlap held up his company and crawled alone approximately two-hundred yards forward of his front lines.\n\nFrom this position at the base of the cliff, about fifty yards from the Japanese lines, the captain spotted the enemy gun positions. He returned to his own lines and relayed vital targeting information to the supporting artillery and naval gunfire units. Persistently disregarding his own safety, he then placed himself in an exposed vantage point to direct a more accurate supporting fire. Captain Dunlap worked without respite for two days and two nights under constant enemy fire, skillfully directing a smashing bombardment against the almost impregnable enemy positions. During this battle, his company suffered heavy casualties, but by his inspiring leadership and indomitable fight spirit, Captain Dunlap spurred his men on to heroic effort which resulted in the final decisive defeat of Japanese in that area.\n\nOne week later, Captain Dunlap was wounded by a bullet in the left hip. He was evacuated from Iwo Jima and spent nearly fourteen months recuperating. President Harry S. Truman awarded the Medal of Honor to Captain Dunlap in ceremonies at the White House on December 18, 1945. Captain Dunlap was discharged from the Great Lakes Naval Hospital on April 20, 1946. He went on inactive duty in September 1946 and was retired with the rank of major on December 1, 1946.\n\nRobert H. Dunlap’s National number is 105475 and his Illinois Society number is 5507. His SAR patriot ancestor was Colonel Johnathan Latimer of New London, Connecticut, who served as an officer in the Continental Army. Dunlap signed his application on January 13, 1973. His occupation is listed as “School Teacher.” Interestingly, he is a cousin of another SAR Compatriot Medal of Honor recipient, James Bond Stockdale. Major Robert H. Dunlap died on March 24, 2000, at the age of seventy-nine. He is buried in Warren Country Memorial Park in Monmouth, Illinois.\n\nHershel Woodrow Williams was born on October 2, 1923, in Quiet Dell, West Virginia. He joined the U.S. Marine Corps in West Virginia and served in the Pacific theater during the Second World War. Williams was awarded the Medal of Honor on October 5, 1945 for conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty as a demolition sergeant serving with the 21st Marines, Third Marine Division, in action against enemy Japanese forces on Iwo Jima, Volcano Islands, on the February 23, 1945.\n\nQuick to volunteer his services when American tanks were maneuvering vainly to open a lane for the infantry through the network of reinforced concrete pillboxes, buried mines, and black volcanic sands, Williams daringly went forward alone to attempt the reduction of devastating machine gun fire from the unyielding positions. Covered only by four riflemen, he fought desperately for four hours under terrific enemy small-arms fire. Williams repeatedly returned to his own lines to prepare demolition charges and obtain serviced flamethrowers, struggling back, frequently to the rear of hostile emplacements, to wipe out one Japanese position after another. On one occasion, he daringly mounted a pillbox to insert the nozzle of his flamethrower through the air vent, killing the occupants and silencing the gun; on another, he grimly charged enemy riflemen who attempted to stop him with bayonets and destroyed them with a burst of flame from his weapon. His unyielding determination and extraordinary heroism in the face of ruthless enemy resistance were directly instrumental in neutralizing one of the most fanatically defended Japanese strong points encountered by his regiment and aided vitally in enabling his company to reach its objective. Williams’ aggressive fighting spirit and valiant devotion to duty throughout this fiercely contested action sustain and enhance the highest traditions of the U.S. Naval Service.\n\nToday, Hershel Williams spends his time very actively promoting the Hershel Woody Williams Medal of Honor Foundation that seeks to erect memorials honoring Gold Star families and recognizing the sacrifice of not only the heroes but also of their families. SAR President General Lawrence presented Williams’ foundation the SAR’s Distinguished Patriotism Award in December 2015 along with Williams’ West Virginia SAR membership certificate and a War Service Medal. Compatriot Williams is also the recipient of the Gold Good Citizenship Medal and the Patriot Medal.\n\nJohn D. ‘Bud” Hawk was born in San Francisco, California on May 30, 1924 and grew up in the Rolling Bay area of Bainbridge Island, Washington. His mother, Margaret Helen Druse was a native of Washington. His father, Lewis Milton Hawk was a native of Wichita, Kansas. He graduated from Bainbridge High School in 1943 and joined the Army two weeks later.\n\nBy August 20, 1944, Hawk was serving in Europe as a sergeant in Company E, 359th Infantry Regiment, 90th Infantry Division. During a German counterattack on that day, near Chambois, France, he was wounded in the leg but continued to fight and, in order to direct the shots of friendly tank destroyers, he willingly exposed himself to intense enemy fire. For his actions during the battle, he was issued the Medal of Honor on July 13, 1945. The medal was formally presented to him by President Harry Truman. Hawk recovered from his wounds and continued to serve in combat. He was wounded three more times before the end of the war, earning a total of four Purple Heart medals. At the end of the battle the US Army took more than 500 prisoners.\n\nIn 1945, Hawk returned from the war and earned a bachelor’s degree in biology from the University of Washington. For more than thirty years he worked as a teacher and principal in the Central Kitsap School District. He currently lives in Bremerton\n\nJohn Druse (Bud) Hawk originally came to the attention of the John Paul Jones Chapter when a Compatriot was awarding Flag Certificates on Patriots Day. Bud Hawk agreed to have the Chapter assist in locating a Patriot from the Revolutionary War through his mother’s lineage. As research was made on his Patriot it was discovered that his lineage included War Service in World War I, The Spanish American War, The Civil War, The War of 1812 and then to his Patriot Ancestor, Great Grandfather Isaac Lawrence who was a Corporal in Captain John Hartwell’s Company, Col. Dike’s Regiment. It was earned that Isaac Lawrence pparticipated in the Battle for Bunker Hill. Bud Hawk joined the Washington Society in June 2013 at the age of 89. His National Number is 188000. His Washington State Number is 188000.\n\nJohn D. ‘Bud” Hawk died in Bremerton, WA, on November 4, 2013. His Memorial service was held at 3:00PM on November 11 2013 at the Kitsap Sun Pavilion.\n\nColonel Ralph Puckett, Jr. was born on 8 December 1926 and hails from Tifton, Georgia. Col Puckett is a combat veteran of two U.S. wars, Korea and Vietnam. In 1949, Puckett graduated from the United States Military Academy (where he captained the Army Boxing Team), was commissioned as an Infantry Second Lieutenant, deployed to Japan, and immediately volunteered to be assigned with the Rangers. When he was informed that there were no more lieutenant positions in the 8th Army Ranger Company, he said that he would “take a squad leader’s or rifleman’s job”; positions several grades lower than a lieutenant’s. Colonel McGee, who was in charge of forming the company, was so impressed by Puckett’s attitude that he gave him the company commander’s position; a position normally reserved for Captains. On 11 October 1950, the Eighth Army Ranger Company entered the Korean War, conducting raids during both daylight and night time conditions.\n\nOn April 30, 2021, Puckett was notified of the recent decision to award him the Medal of Honor for his actions on November 25, 1950. He received the Medal of Honor during a ceremony at the White House from President Joe Biden on May 21, 2021.\n\nFor conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty: First Lieutenant Ralph Puckett, Jr. distinguished himself by acts of gallantry and intrepidity above and beyond the call of duty, while serving as the Commander, 8th U.S. Army Ranger Company during the period of 25 November 1950 through 26 November 1950, in Korea. As his unit commenced a daylight attack on Hill 205, the enemy directed mortar, machine gun, and small arms fire against the advancing force. To obtain supporting fire, First Lieutenant Puckett mounted the closest tank, exposing himself to the deadly enemy fire. Leaping from the tank, he shouted words of encouragement to his men and began to lead the Rangers in the attack. Almost immediately, enemy fire threatened the success of the attack by pinning down one platoon. Leaving the safety of his position with full knowledge of the danger, First Lieutenant Puckett intentionally ran across an open area three times to draw enemy fire, thereby allowing the Rangers to locate and destroy the enemy positions and to seize Hill 205. During the night, the enemy launched a counterattack that lasted four hours. Over the course of the counterattack, the Rangers were inspired and motivated by the extraordinary leadership and courageous example exhibited by First Lieutenant Puckett. As a result, five human wave attacks by a battalion strength enemy element were repulsed. During the first attack, First Lieutenant Puckett was wounded by grenade fragments, but refused evacuation and continually directed artillery support that decimated attacking enemy formations, repeatedly abandoned positions of relative safety to make his way from foxhole to foxhole to check the company’s perimeter, and distribute ammunition amongst the Rangers. When the enemy launched a sixth attack, it became clear to First Lieutenant Puckett that the position was untenable due to the unavailability of supporting artillery fire. During this attack, two enemy mortar rounds landed in his foxhole, inflicting grievous wounds which limited his mobility. Knowing his men were in a precarious situation, First Lieutenant Puckett commanded the Rangers to leave him behind and evacuate the area. Feeling a sense of duty to aid him, the Rangers refused the order and staged an effort to retrieve him from the foxhole while still under fire from the enemy. Ultimately, the Rangers succeeded in retrieving First Lieutenant Puckett and they moved to the bottom of the hill, where First Lieutenant Puckett called for devastating artillery fire on the top of the enemy controlled hill. First Lieutenant Puckett’s extraordinary heroism and selflessness above and beyond the call of duty were in keeping with the highest traditions of military service and reflect great credit upon himself, his unit, and the United States Army.\n\nFollowing the Korean War, Puckett served over two years in the U.S. Army Infantry School Ranger Department as commander of the Mountain Ranger Division. As the first Ranger Advisor in the U.S. Army Mission to Colombia, he planned and established the Colombian Army Escuela de Lanceros (Ranger School). Later, he commanded “B” and “C” teams in the 10th Special Forces Group in Germany. In 1967, then-Lieutenant Colonel Puckett commanded the 2d Battalion, 502d Infantry (Airborne) of the 101st Airborne Division in Vietnam. He was awarded a second Distinguished Service Cross for heroic leadership in August 1967. During a dire, night-long defense near Chu Lai, he inspired his soldiers, who rallied to repel the attacking North Vietnamese. A rifle platoon leader preparing for a “last stand” recalled Colonel Puckett’s effect on the nearly exhausted soldiers: “… word of Colonel Puckett’s arrival spread like wildfire. We all stiffened up and felt that nothing bad could happen now because the Ranger was with us.”\n\nColonel Puckett retired in 1971 after 22 years of active duty to become the national programs coordinator of Outward Bound, Inc. He subsequently established Discovery, Inc. After several years of successful leadership at Discovery, Inc. in Herndon, Virginia, Puckett moved to Atlanta and began the Discovery Program at The Westminster Schools, which became known nationally in the adventure education community. In 1984, he became the executive vice president of MicroBilt, Inc., a soft- and hardware computer company. Puckett finally retired to Columbus, Georgia, where he has remained actively involved with the Ranger School at Fort Benning.\n\nHe has continued to be very active in military affairs. Puckett was an inaugural inductee into the U.S. Army Ranger Hall of Fame in 1992. He served as the Honorary Colonel for the 75th Ranger Regiment from 1996 to 2006 for which he was awarded the Distinguished Civilian Service Award. He speaks often at graduations and other functions at Fort Benning and is an Honorary Instructor at The Infantry School. He was inducted into the Order of St. Maurice in 1998, and was the 1998 Ranger of the Year for the Ranger Infantry Companies of the Korean War. He was inducted into the USAF Gathering of Eagles in 1999. He was added to the Tifton, Georgia, Wall of Fame in 2004. Other honors include appointment as an Ambassador of Goodwill by the Western Hemisphere Institute for Security Cooperation, selection as a Distinguished Graduate of the United States Military Academy in 2004, and selection as the Infantry’s Doughboy Award recipient in 2007. He is the author of Words for Warriors: A Professional Soldier’s Notebook and numerous media articles.\n\nHe lives in Columbus, Georgia with his wife the former Jean Martin. They have two daughters (Jean and Martha), one son (Thomas), and six grandchildren (Lauren, Dixon, Martha Lane, Jean, Sarah, and Jack).\n\nJames Bond Stockdale was born on December 23, 1923, in Abingdon, Illinois, the son of Vernon B. Stockdale and Mabel E. Bond. He graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy in 1946. Upon graduation, he earned his pilot’s wings at Pensacola, Florida. In 1954, he reported to the Test Pilot School at Patuxent River, Maryland.\n\nIn August 1964, while serving as squadron commander, Stockdale was one of the U.S. pilots flying overhead during the Gulf of Tonkin Incident. On a mission over North Vietnam on September 9, 1965, Stockdale’s A-4E Skyhawk was disabled by anti-aircraft fire and he was forced to eject. Stockdale parachuted into a small village, where he was severely beaten and taken into custody. He was held as a prisoner of war in the Hoa Lo prison for the next seven years where he was tortured many times but refused to capitulate. Stockdale was released as a prisoner of war on February 12, 1973. His citation reads, in part, for “his valiant leadership and extraordinary courage in a hostile environment,” James Bond Stockdale received the Medal of Honor in 1976 from President Gerald Ford.\n\nAfter his retirement, Stockdale became the president of the Citadel in South Carolina in 1979. He left the Citadel to become a fellow of the Hoover Institution at Stanford University in 1981. During the following two decades, Stockdale wrote a number of books both on his experiences during the Vietnam War and afterwards and also on philosophy. His best known work is In Love and War, co-written with his wife Sybil and published in 1984. It was later made into an NBC television movie of the same name.\n\nStockdale came to know H. Ross Perot through his wife’s work in establishing an organization to represent the families of Vietnam prisoners of war. Perot asked Stockdale to accept the nomination as the vice president on the ticket for the Reform Party in March 1992. Admiral Stockdale accepted. The independent ticket of Ross Perot and James Stockdale received nineteen percent of the vote in the 1992 presidential election. Although they did not carry any states, it was one of the best showings by an independent ticket in U.S. electoral history.\n\nVice Admiral Stockdale retired to California as he slowly succumbed to Alzheimer’s disease. He died on July 5, 2005. Stockdale’s funeral service was held at the Naval Academy Chapel and he is buried at the United States Naval Academy Cemetery in Annapolis, Maryland.\n\nCompatriot Stockdale was a life member of the Illinois SAR. His SAR National number is 110583 and his Illinois Society number is 5765. His SAR patriot ancestor was Captain James Elliot, who served as a soldier and officer of the Rockbridge County Militia in Virginia. There is a note on the back of his applications which reads, “Admiral Stockdale was a member of the “Winifred Miller” chapter of C.A.R., which has disbanded.” Interestingly, he is a cousin of another SAR Compatriot Medal of Honor recipient, Major Robert H. Dunlap. In September 2008, the Navy accepted delivery of the, (DDG-106), a guided missile destroyer ship.\n\nPatrick Henry Brady was born on October 1, 1936, in Phillip, North Dakota. His family soon moved to Seattle, Washington, where Brady attended O’Dea High School, an all-boys school run by the congregation of Christian Brothers. He was active in sports. He graduated from Seattle University and was commissioned a second lieutenant in the Army Medical Service Corps in 1959 through the university’s ROTC program. He served in Berlin, Germany, with the 279th Station Hospital. In 1963, he graduated from the U.S. Army Aviation School at Fort Rucker, Alabama.\n\nBrady’s next assignment was with the 57th Medical Detachment in Vietnam. After the death of his commanding officer, Brady assumed command of the unit’s Detachment A. On his second tour, now a major, Brady was second in command of the 54th Medical Detachment. It was during this tour of duty that Major Brady was awarded the Medal of Honor.\n\nOn January 6, 1968, while flying near Chu Lai, Vietnam, Major Brady earned the Medal of Honor. His citation reads, in part: Major “Brady distinguished himself while serving in the Republic of Vietnam commanding a UH-1H ambulance helicopter, volunteered to rescue wounded men from a site in enemy-held territory which was reported to be heavily defended and to be blanketed by fog. To reach the site he descended through heavy fog and smoke and hovered slowly along a valley trail, turning his ship sideward to blow away the fog with the backwash from his rotor blades. Despite the unchallenged, close-range enemy fire, he found the dangerously small site, where he successfully landed and evacuated two badly wounded South Vietnamese soldiers. He was then called to another area completely covered by dense fog where American casualties lay only fifty meters from the enemy. Two aircraft had previously been shot down and others had made unsuccessful attempts to reach this site earlier in the day. With unmatched skill and extraordinary courage, Maj. Brady made four flights to this embattled landing zone and successfully rescued all the wounded. On his third mission of the day, Maj. Brady once again landed at a site surrounded by the enemy. The friendly ground force, pinned down by enemy fire, had been unable to reach and secure the landing zone. Although his aircraft had been badly damaged and his controls partially shot away during his initial entry into this area, he returned minutes later and rescued the remaining injured. Shortly thereafter, obtaining a replacement aircraft, Maj. Brady was requested to land in an enemy minefield where a platoon of American soldiers was trapped. A mine detonated near his helicopter, wounding two crewmembers and damaging his ship. In spite of this, he managed to fly six severely injured patients to medical aid. Throughout that day Maj. Brady utilized three helicopters to evacuate a total of fifty-one seriously wounded men, many of whom would have perished without prompt medical treatment.”\n\nHis record shows that during his two tours of duty in Vietnam, Brady flew over two thousand combat missions and evacuated more than five thousand wounded.\n\nReturning to the U.S., Brady continued serving in the U.S. Army. He retired in 1993 as a major general with thirty-four years of service.\n\nPatrick Henry Brady became a member of the Texas SAR in September 2011. His National number is 180845 and his Texas Society number is 11114. His SAR patriot ancestor was John Lammon who was born on September 12, 1761, in Palmer, Hampshire County, Massachusetts. Lammon served as a private in the 8th Regiment, Albany County Militia from Albany County, New York. Lammon died on April 16, 1847, in Orangeville, Wyoming County, New York.\n\nGeneral Brady served for a number of years as the chairman of the Citizens Flag Alliance, an organization, founded in 1989 by the American Legion. It was formally called the Citizen’s Flag Honor Guard. The Alliance is dedicated to protecting the American flag from desecration.\n\nSergeant Gary Michael Rose distinguished himself by acts of gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty while serving as a Special Forces Medic with a company sized exploitation force, 5th Special Forces Group, 1st Special Forces. Between 11 and 14 September 1970, Sergeant Rose’s company was continuously engaged by a well-armed and numerically superior hostile force deep in enemy-controlled territory. Enemy B-40 rockets and mortar rounds rained down while the adversary sprayed the area with small arms and machine gun fire, wounding many and forcing everyone to seek cover. Sergeant Rose, braving the hail of bullets, sprinted fifty meters to a wounded soldier’s side. He then used his own body to protect the casualty from further injury while treating his wounds. After stabilizing the casualty, Sergeant Rose carried him through the bullet-ridden combat zone to protective cover. As the enemy accelerated the attack, Sergeant Rose continuously exposed himself to intense fire as he fearlessly moved from casualty to casualty, administering life-saving aid. A B-40 rocket impacted just meters from Sergeant Rose, knocking him from his feet and injuring his head, hand, and foot. Ignoring his wounds, Sergeant Rose struggled to his feet and continued to render aid to the other injured soldiers. During an attempted medevac, Sergeant Rose again exposed himself to enemy fire as he attempted to hoist wounded personnel up to the hovering helicopter, which was unable to land due to unsuitable terrain. The medevac mission was aborted due to intense enemy fire and the helicopter crashed a few miles away due to the enemy fire sustained during the attempted extraction. Over the next two days, Sergeant Rose continued to expose himself to enemy fire in order to treat the wounded, estimated to be half of the company’s personnel. On September 14, during the company’s eventual helicopter extraction, the enemy launched a full-scale offensive. Sergeant Rose, after loading wounded personnel on the first set of extraction helicopters, returned to the outer perimeter under enemy fire, carrying friendly casualties and moving wounded personnel to more secure positions until they could be evacuated. He then returned to the perimeter to help repel the enemy until the final extraction helicopter arrived. As the final helicopter was loaded, the enemy began to overrun the company’s position, and the helicopter’s Marine door gunner was shot in the neck. Sergeant Rose instantly administered critical medical treatment onboard the helicopter, saving the Marine’s life. The helicopter carrying Sergeant Rose crashed several hundred meters from the evacuation point, further injuring Sergeant Rose and the personnel on board. Despite his numerous wounds from the past three days, Sergeant Rose continued to pull and carry unconscious and wounded personnel out of the burning wreckage and continued to administer aid to the wounded until another extraction helicopter arrived. Sergeant Rose’s extraordinary heroism and selflessness above and beyond the call of duty were critical to saving numerous lives over that four day time period. His actions are in keeping with the highest traditions of military service and reflect great credit upon himself, the 1st Special Forces, and the United States Army."
