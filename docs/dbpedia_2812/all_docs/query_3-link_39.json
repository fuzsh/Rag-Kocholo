        "text": "Baseball 6/20/2024 11:30:00 AM\n\nMichigan State Athletics Announces 2024 All-Sports Award Winners\n\nEast Lansing, Mich. – Michigan State Athletics has announced its All-Sports Awards winners for the 2023-24 season. The awards include the George Alderton Male and Female Athletes of the Year, Chester Brewer Leadership Award, Dr. James Feurig Achievement and Service Award, the Big Ten Conference Medals of Honor and the Big Ten Conference Outstanding Sportsmanship Award winners. A panel of administrators and athletics department staff selected the winners.\n\nGeorge Alderton Co-Male Athletes of the Year – Heath Baldwin (men's track & field) / Ozan Baris (men's tennis)\n\nGeorge Alderton Female Athlete of the Year – Skyla Schulte (gymnastics)\n\nChester Brewer Leadership Award – Nash Nienhuis (men's ice hockey)\n\nDr. James Feurig Achievement and Service Award – Ashley Harlock (field hockey)\n\nBig Ten Conference Medal of Honor (Male) – Jack Frank (baseball)\n\nBig Ten Conference Medal of Honor (Female) – Justina Gaynor (soccer)\n\nBig Ten Conference Outstanding Sportsmanship Award (Male) – Nicolas Muller (hockey)\n\nBig Ten Conference Outstanding Sportsmanship Award (Female) – Macy Lee (softball)\n\nGEORGE ALDERTON CO-MALE ATHLETE OF THE YEAR\n\n(Presented to top male athlete of 2023-24)\n\nCo-Winner: Heath Baldwin (men's track & field)\n\nFor the second-straight year, Heath Baldwin rewrote the Michigan State track & field history book for the MSU squad. In his final season as a Spartan, he broke a total of five school records, earning First-Team All-America honors and a runner-up finish at the NCAA Indoor Championships.\n\nBaldwin did not compete at the NCAA Outdoor Championships in order to prepare for the U.S. Olympic Trials. At the NCAA East First Round in Lexington, Kentucky, he competed in the 110m hurdles. The Kalamazoo, Michigan native's time of 13.71 was an MSU school record, knocking off Will Agodu's 2019 time of 13.75. Baldwin now owns five school records, all broken this year: 110m hurdles, 60m hurdles, javelin, the heptathlon and the decathlon. Baldwin ties former All-American Morgan Beadlescomb (2018-22) for the most individual program records at five.\n\nThe highlight of Baldwin's outdoor season was 8,470 points earned in the decathlon at the Mt. SAC Relays in April in Torrance, Calif. The 8,420 points ranks third among all athletes in the United States in 2024 and earns him a spot in the upcoming United State Olympic Trials. It also broke a Big Ten record and his own school record.\n\nHe rounded out his MSU career earning Great Lakes Region Outdoor Field Athlete of the Year.\n\nDuring the indoor season, he was the runner-up in the heptathlon at the NCAA Indoor Track & Field Championships in Boston in March. Not only was Baldwin's score of 6,238 points a school record, but it was also the Big Ten record, sixth-best of all time and made him the U.S. No. 1 in the event at the time.\n\nPrior to notching four personal bests at the national championships, the 2023 MSU Athletics George Alderton Male Athlete of the Year posted a school record in the 60m hurdles on the way to the podium at the B1G Championships (2/23-24), also scoring points in the high jump.\n\nBaldwin qualified for the NCAA Championships on his first and only attempt of the season back in January when he won the heptathlon title at the competitive PNC Lenny Lyles Invite (1/26-27). During the meet he broke the Norton Healthcare SLC facility record in the heptathlon shot put (15.73m) while finishing in the top four of each of the seven events. In addition, he was named the Great Lakes Region Indoor Field Athlete of the Year.\n\nBaldwin was also a standout in the classroom in 2023-24, earning Academic All-Big Ten and College Sports Communicators (CSC) Academic-All District nods. He is pursuing his masters in marketing research & analytics.\n\nBaldwin is the sixth track & field athlete to earn the George Alderton Male Athlete of the Year Award and the second to win back-to-back honors since Tim Ehrhardt (2017-18).\n\nCo-Winner: Ozan Baris (men's tennis)\n\nIn a year full of firsts, it's only fitting that Ozan Baris is the first Michigan State men's tennis student-athlete to be named the George Alderton Athlete of the Year\n\nThe hometown Spartan out of Okemos, Mich., entered his sophomore season already as one of the most decorated men's tennis players in MSU history. As a freshman, Baris captured Freshman of the Year and First Team All-Conference accolades from the Big Ten before earning a bid to the NCAA Championships in both doubles and singles, where he became an All-American alongside doubles partner Max Sheldon.\n\nA highly anticipated sophomore season awaited Baris, and he delivered. In the fall, capturing the singles title at the Battle in the Bay Tournament and finishing second at the ITA All-American Championships in singles play, completing the fall with a 13-3 record, with eight of his victories over ranked opponents. The highlight of Baris' fall season came at the ITA Fall National Championships, where he and Sheldon captured the program's first-ever national doubles title.\n\nBaris earned a spot on the All-Big Ten First Team for the second-straight year and was named the program's first Big Ten Player of the Year in the spring after posting a 14-3 singles record during the regular season, including a perfect 6-0 record against B1G opponents. He also recorded a 12-6 regular season record in doubles play. He led the Spartans to the semifinals of the Big Ten Tournament, MSU's first appearance since the tournament switched to a single-elimination format in 1999.\n\nBaris was selected to the NCAA Championships alongside Sheldon in doubles for the second-straight year, where the pair fell in the first round to the No. 2 overall doubles team. He earned the No. 8 overall seed in the NCAA Singles Championship and made a historic run to the national semifinals, becoming the first in program history to do so, finishing the season with an overall record of 32-7 and as the program's first two-time All-American.\n\nHe finished the year ranked No. 5 in the final ITA singles rankings, a program-high, and 22nd in doubles with Sheldon.\n\nBaris helped lead a resurgence for an MSU men's tennis program in 2023-24 that reached the NCAA Tournament for just the second time in program history, securing the program's first NCAA Tournament victory. The Spartans also captured a program-high 23 wins.\n\nA standout in the classroom, Baris holds a near-perfect 3.908 cumulative GPA and was named the program's fourth-ever First Team Academic-All American by the College Sports Communicators (CSC) in 2024.\n\nHe is the first MSU tennis student-athlete, male or female, to win the George Alderton Athlete of the Year Award.\n\nPAST WINNERS - ALDERTON MALE ATHLETE OF THE YEAR:\n\n2023-Heath Baldwin (track & field); 2022-Kenneth Walker III (football); 2021-Morgan Beadlescomb (cross country/track & field); 2020-Cassius Winston (basketball); 2019-Cassius Winston (basketball); 2018-Miles Bridges (basketball) and Tim Ehrhardt (track & field); 2017-Tim Ehrhardt (track & field); 2016-Denzel Valentine (basketball); 2015-Jake Hildebrand (hockey); 2014-Darqueze Dennard (football); 2013-Le'Veon Bell (football); 2012-Draymond Green (basketball); 2011-Greg Jones (football); 2010-Greg Jones (football); 2009-Franklin Gomez (wrestling); 2008-Jeff Lerg (hockey); 2007-Jeff Lerg (hockey); 2006-Brad Gebauer (track & field); 2005-Nick Simmons (wrestling); 2004-Jeff Smoker (football); 2003-Charles Rogers (football); 2002-Paul Terek (track & field); 2001-Ryan Miller (hockey); 2000-Mateen Cleaves (basketball); 1999-Mateen Cleaves (basketball) and Mike York (hockey); 1998-Chad Alban (hockey); 1997-Reid Friedrichs (soccer); 1996-David Morgan (wrestling); 1995-Shawn Respert (basketball); 1994-Emilio Collins (wrestling); 1993-Bryan Smolinski (hockey); 1992-Anthony Hamm (cross country/track & field); 1991-Steve Smith (basketball); 1990-Kip Miller (hockey) and Percy Snow (football); 1989-Bobby Reynolds (hockey); 1988-Todd Krumm (football/baseball); 1987-Don McSween (hockey); 1986-Mike Donnelly (hockey), Lorenzo White (football), Scott Skiles (basketball); 1985-Sam Vincent (basketball); 1984-Carl Banks (football); 1983-Ron Scott (hockey); 1982-Ron Scott (hockey).\n\nGEORGE ALDERTON FEMALE ATHLETE OF THE YEAR\n\n(Presented to top female athlete of 2023-24)\n\nWinner: Skyla Schulte (gymnastics)\n\nAs Michigan State gymnastics continues to reach new heights, so does Skyla Schulte.\n\nThe junior from Bolingbrook, Ill. put together one of the most impressive seasons in program history in 2024, capping off her historic year with an All-American finish at the NCAA Championships in April after leading the Spartans to their first Big Ten Championship title and second-straight regular season crown.\n\nSchulte competed in the all-around in all but three meets in 2024, capturing the all-around title in seven of those meets while adding 12 individual event titles for a team-leading 19 titles throughout the season. She earned a season-high 39.600 in the all-around on four occasions while tying career highs on beam (9.950) and floor (9.9750) and scored season highs of 9.875 on vault and 9.925 on bars. Schulte also collected her third First Team All-Big Ten nod, becoming the third gymnast in program history to earn three first-team honors from the conference and was named the league's gymnast of the week three times.\n\nAt the Big Five Meet in February, Schulte helped the Spartans to victories over Minnesota, Nebraska, Ohio State and Rutgers to complete an undefeated regular season in the Big Ten, becoming the first team to go undefeated in conference action since 2022 and fourth team overall. The title was MSU's first outright crown after earning a share of the regular season title in 2023.\n\nSchulte found herself hoisting a Big Ten trophy with her team again exactly one month after winning the conference regular season title at the Big Ten Championships in March. MSU narrowly edged out second-place Minnesota, 197.600-197.500, in front of a sold-out Jenison Field House crowd to win the program's first championship title. Schulte also topped the podium in the all-around, winning MSU's first Big Ten all-around title, and earned a share of the floor title.\n\nMSU finished fourth at the NCAA Gainesville Regional Final after advancing to its third-straight regional final. A 9.900 on floor in the regional second round from Schulte secured a trip to the NCAA Championships in Fort Worth, Texas, for the second time in her career. She earned a 9.925 in Fort Worth to collect NCAA Second Team All-America honors, becoming MSU's first All-American on the event and first to capture multiple NCAA All-America honors after earning second-team honors on beam in 2022.\n\nSchulte is just the third MSU gymnast to be named the George Alderton Female Athlete of the Year and first in 31 years, joining Michelle Ingalls (1988) and Jodi Blotcher (1993).\n\nPAST WINNERS - ALDERTON FEMALE ATHLETE OF THE YEAR:\n\n2023-Lauren Kozal (soccer); 2022-Jenna Magness (track & field/cross country); 2021-Jenna Magness (track & field/cross country); 2020-Annie Fuller (track & field) and Valery Plata (golf); 2019-Asya Reynolds (track & field) and Ally Geer-Park (golf); 2018-Sarah Burnham (golf); 2017-Sarah Burnham (golf) and Tori Jankoska (basketball); 2016-Aerial Powers (basketball); 2015-Leah O'Connor (cross country/track & field); 2014-Allyssa Ferrell (golf); 2013-Caroline Powers (golf) and Beth Rohl (track & field); 2012-Laura Heyboer (soccer) and Caroline Powers (golf); 2011-Emily MacLeod (cross country/track & field) and Caroline Powers (golf); 2010-Floor Rijpma (field hockey); 2009-Nicole Bush (cross country/track & field); 2008-Sara Brown (golf); 2007-Sara Brown (golf); 2006-Liz Shimek (basketball); 2005-Kristin Haynie (basketball); 2004-Jamie Krzyminski (cross country/track & field); 2003-Michelle Carson (cross country) and Jamie Krzyminski (cross country/track & field); 2002-Emily Bastel (golf); 2001-Summer Mitchell (swimming & diving); 2000-Emily Bastel (golf); 1999-Carrie Carpenter (softball); 1998-Jill Lusher (field hockey); 1997-Sevatheda Fynes (track & field); 1996-Val Sterk (volleyball); 1995-Karen Winslow (soccer); 1994-Susan Francis (track & field); 1993-Jodi Blotcher (gymnastics); 1992-Misty Allison (cross country/track & field); 1991-Julie Farrell-Ovenhouse (swimming & diving); 1990-Julie Farrell (swimming & diving); 1989-Julie Farrell (swimming & diving); 1988-Michelle Ingalls (gymnastics); 1987-Odessa Smalls (track & field); 1986-Mary Schoenle (swimming & diving); 1985-Kelly Becker (volleyball); 1984-Deanne Moore (softball); 1983-Judi Brown (track & field); 1982-Molly Brennan (track & field).\n\nCHESTER BREWER LEADERSHIP AWARD\n\n(Presented to a graduating senior in his or her last year of eligibility for distinguished performance in athletics and scholarship and for possessing a high degree of leadership qualities and skill.)\n\nWinner: Nash Nienhuis (men's ice hockey)\n\nThe 78th different player to be named the captain of the Spartans and an alternate captain as a junior, Nash Nienhuis' work ethic and leadership helped bring Michigan State hockey back into the national spotlight. From seventh-place finishes during his freshman and sophomore seasons to Big Ten regular-season and tournament titles and a spot in the NCAA regional final in 2023-24, the hockey program grew by leaps and bounds over the last two seasons when Nienhuis was part of the leadership group helping to set and raise the standards in the dressing room.\n\nA selection to the Big Ten All-Tournament team after a thrilling overtime victory at Munn Arena over Michigan, Nienhuis completed his career with a season that established his career best in points (24) and assists (15), and scored more goals (9) than he had in his first three seasons combined. Helping guide the on-ice development of freshman phenom Artyom Levshunov, Nienhuis finished at +20, good for second on the team and blocked 30 shots, third among Spartan blueliners, while tying for third in the Big Ten in game-winning goals (4). He appeared in 131 career games on the Spartan blueline, with a 16-45-61 scoring line (3 ppg, 6 gwg).\n\nNienhuis' leadership and work ethic was acknowledged in every season of his career with team awards – the team's Outstanding Rookie in 2020-21, he was the team's Most Improved Player as a sophomore and was the recipient in 2022-23 of both the Spartan Fitness Award and the Dave Carrier Award, which is awarded in honor of the Spartans' longtime athletic trainer and acknowledges the \"comeback player\" who overcame injury or adversity throughout the season.

He also posted a .724 overall slugging percentage and a 1.233 in B1G only games, both also ranking second in the conference, in addition to a 1.089 OPS in all games, ranking fifth in the league. In overall games, Frank was tied for seventh in doubles (17). Frank knocked 11 doubles in B1G only games, also good for second, boosted by four doubles in the final weekend series of the weekend against Nebraska.\n\nIn the season finale, Frank went out with a bang in his final game as a Spartan, going 4-for-5 with two doubles, logging three RBI and two runs scored. With the four hits, Frank matched his jersey number with his team-leading 21st multi-hit game, as well as his fourth game with four hits, finishing with nine games with two hits, seven games with three hits, four four-hit outings and one five-hit game. He also had 10 games with multiple RBI.\n\nFrank also had 19 stolen bases on the season, finishing fourth in the league overall.\n\nOne of three Spartans to start and play in all 51 games, Frank not only led the Spartans in average (.383), but also in slugging percentage (.573) and on-base percentage (.467), along with runs scored (55), hits (80), triples (3), home runs (9), stolen bases (19) and total bases (130), while ranking tied for first in doubles (17) and second in RBI (40).\n\nFrank left his mark on MSU's career lists, including tied for No. 2 for doubles (48), No. 3 for runs (155), No. 5 for stolen bases (52), tied for No. 7 for home runs (26) and No. 10 for hits (226).\n\nHe also posted a season-long seven-game hitting streak in all games done twice, (March 17-27 and April 17-April 28), as well as 11-game hitting streak in B1G only games (April 19-May 11). Frank also had a stretch of reaching base in 13-consecutive at bats from April 21-27.\n\nFrank earned the Bobby Bragan National Collegiate Slugger of the Week Award on May 1, and followed that honor up by being named Big Ten Player of the Week on May 6. He collected the MSU team awards as he was tabbed the recipient of both the John Kobs Most Valuable Player Award in addition to the Kirk Gibson Co-Offensive Player of the Year Award. Frank also earned First Team All-Big Ten accolades and was named an All-American DI Right Fielder by 64Analytics.\n\nFrank is the second baseball student-athlete to win the Big Ten Medal of Honor in the last four years, joining former teammate Bryce Kelley, who won the accolade in 2021.

She notched a pair of assists in MSU's 3-0 win over Iowa in the Spartans' regular-season finale to clinch back-to-back Big Ten titles before tallying a goal and assist in MSU's opening-round victory in the NCAA Tournament over Ohio. MSU advanced to the third round of the NCAA Tournament for the first time in program history after Gaynor scored the game-winning goal in a 1-0 victory over Harvard.\n\nWith one season remaining in the Green and White, Gaynor has totaled 12 goals and 14 assists for 38 points as a Spartan.\n\nGaynor has also shined off the pitch, graduating with a perfect 4.0 in kinesiology this spring. She has earned Academic All-Big Ten and Big Ten Distinguished Scholar honors in each eligible season and collected United Soccer Coaches Third Team Scholar All-American accolades in 2022.
