        "text": "Dr. Diehl, founder of the Lifestyle Medicine Institute and the Complete Health Improvement Program (CHIP), was a clinical professor of preventive medicine at Loma Linda University and a founding member of ACLM and its Board of Advisors.\n\nDr. Diehl established the Lifestyle Medicine Institute more than 25 years ago.\n\nHis pioneering efforts with Nathan Pritikin and Denis Burkitt, MD have shown that simple lifestyle changes can prevent, treat and reverse many of today’s diseases.\n\nDr. Diehl’s work as a lifestyle interventionist, researcher, educator, and speaker has found its most powerful expression in CHIP, a community-based, 12-week, 40-hour intensive educational lifestyle intervention, which draws together healthcare professionals, faith-communities, corporations, schools, and community infrastructures, such as restaurants and grocery chains. As the first research and education director at the Pritikin Longevity Center, he aspired to make better health accessible to the masses, developing this affordable program designed to arrest and reverse society’s most common chronic diseases. CHIP has empowered countless individuals to make lasting, positive changes in their health. His co-authored books Health Power, the Optimal Diet Cookbook, Take Charge of Your Health, and You-Turn have been translated into 36 languages with a circulation of over two million.\n\nDr. Rippe is regarded as a leading authority on preventive cardiology, health and fitness, and a pioneer of the fitness walking movement. He graduated cum laude from Harvard College and Harvard Medical School. He founded and directs both the Rippe Lifestyle Institute in Shrewsbury, Mass., and the Rippe Health Assessment at Florida Hospital Celebration Health in Celebration, Fla. The Rippe Lifestyle Institute promotes health and disease prevention research and communication. The Rippe Health Assessment provides comprehensive health evaluations for high-performance individuals.\n\nRippe’s main goal is empowering people to take charge of their own health through simple lifestyle changes. His numerous books include Fit Over Forty, The Healthy Heart for Dummies, and The Healthy Heart Cookbook for Dummies. He has frequently appeared on television shows such as Today, Good Morning America, and PBS’s Body Watch and has served as a health and fitness consultant for the Television Food Network. The New York Times, Los Angeles Times, and The Wall Street Journal have featured his work.\n\nRippe, an enthusiastic athlete, holds a black belt in karate. He jogs, skis, and windsurfs regularly.\n\nKoushik: Dr Reddy is a foremost champion of LM within the Tampa VA where he serves as an interventional cardiologist. He has worked tirelessly to promote ACLM’s 5.5-hour CME/CE accredited LM and FAM Essentials online course in his own VA hospital and throughout the national Veterans Administration system. He has been a beacon of LM light in this agency often not known for its innovation. His scrubs have an embroidered carrot and stent, which he points to asking his patients to “pick one.” His passion is contagious and he’s deserving of this recognition!\n\nMichelle: Dr. Tollefson is a professor in the Health Professions Department at Metropolitan State University of Denver where she created and oversees the nation’s very first bachelor in Lifestyle Medicine program. This enables students to “major” in the field of LM. All students become qualified to take the National Board of Health and Wellness Coaches exam. Many of Metropolitan State University of Denver’s students are Pell grant recipients and first generation students. MSU has one of the most diverse student bodies in this beautiful state of Colorado! Nearly 54% of MSU’s student body are students of color, with MSU being noted as an Hispanic-Serving Institution, committed to serving DACA and undocumented students.\n\nMorris Cardio: Dr. Cliff Morris and his team at the Morris Cardiovascular and Risk Reduction Institute have enthusiastically integrated lifestyle medicine into their cardiology practice, embracing various initiatives such as facilitating group medical appointments, prescribing dietary recommendations, and allocating office space for an on-site gym where patients can exercise under the guidance of a medical fitness specialist. They bring a farmers market, in their office, to a disadvantaged local community. Dr. Cliff Morris and his team have advocated for the transformation of Hopewell, VA into a Blue Zone.\n\nThe L&PM WG was chartered in 2019 with 20 core members, primarily Air Force (AF) physicians. From this WG, the L&PM Coalition of the Interested (COI) was created as a grassroots effort to reach Department of Defense (DoD)-affiliated healthcare professionals with a mission to infuse L&PM into every aspect of the Military Health System (MHS) and the military population. COI membership has grown by 75% in the last year to nearly 350 healthcare professionals across the U.S. Air Force, Army, Navy, and Coast Guard, including Service Members (SMs) and government employees. Since its inception, the L&PM WG has achieved exceptional results across the DoD and beyond!"
