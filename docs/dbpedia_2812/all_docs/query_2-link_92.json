Wieb was widely recognized as a champion of great design and for his work for nonprofits throughout the city, from founding Don’t Tear it Down (now the DC Preservation League) to designing cheerful spaces for places like Bread for the City and Martha’s Table. He began his career in Boston working with Walter Gropius at the Architects Collaborative and later with Charles Moore, designer of California’s famous Sea Ranch, who taught him that architecture should be fun. Wieb’s portfolio includes private homes, schools, restaurants and nonprofits. When not designing buildings that have been described by the Washington Post as “at once creative and sensible,” Wieb drew Archihorse, a comic strip focused on urban design and architecture, which was published for many years by the Progressive Review. Wieb was also a prolific map maker.\n\nThe first Wieb award was given posthumously to John Wiebenson. We are reminded of the spirit, creativity, and great humor he brought to his work which has enriched the city for all people.\n\nGranting Organization: Washington Architectural Foundation\n\nEligibility: Practicing architect in the Washington community.
