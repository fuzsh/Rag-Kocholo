        "text": "Joe Kubert\n\nUnknown Soldier v1 #219, 1978 - One of Frank Miller's early works for DC, this back-up story chronicles the rise of the ancient Achaeans. His drawings lack polish and distinctiveness, made worse by the heavy-handed inks of Danny Bulanadi. The title page, with its use of darkened foreground shapes to increase depth, only hints of his potential. Joe Kubert's cover design is also dampened by its noticeable lack of detail. Other artists in this bronze age comic include Fred Carrillo, Dick Ayers and Romeo Tanghal. This is 12 of 62 Unknown Soldier issues by Kubert and 1 of 1 Unknown Soldier issues by Miller.\n\n- - - - - - - - - -\n\nKubert cover pencils and inks = **\n\n\"The Edge of History\" Miller story pencils (Danny Bulanadi inks) 5 pages = *\n\nFrank Miller\n\n- - - - - - - - - -\n\nHome / Kubert / Miller / Unknown Soldier / DC\n\nebay >this issue >Kubert >Miller\n\n(The affiliate links above earn commissions which help support this blog)"
