        "text": "More than 100 Defense Logistics Agency Troop Support employees were recognized for various achievements during the quarterly awards ceremony June 14 at the Bldg. 6 auditorium.\n\nArmy Brig. Gen. Charles Hamilton, DLA Troop Support commander, officiated the ceremony.\n\n“I just want to say that I am proud of all of you and what you do ... thank you,” Hamilton said.\n\nHamilton first presented Army Capt. Franklin Carr, a strategic planner for the Clothing and Textiles directorate, with the Defense Meritorious Service Award.\n\nCarr was recognized for his previous work as aide-de-camp to former DLA Troop Support Commander Maj. Gen. Stephen Shapiro, as well as assisting in humanitarian aid efforts for Iraq and Syria.\n\n“It is a great honor to be recognized here today, particularly amongst our peers,” said Carr. “For a service member, that (recognition) continues to go on with them.”\n\nMore than 15 employees received career service certificates for 30, 35 and 40 years of government service. Patricia Scott, chief of Subsistence garrison feeding, and Kathleen Nolan, Customer Operations program management analyst, received certificates for 40 years of service.\n\n“It is amazing how quickly the time went by,” said Nolan. “It has been a wonderful career and it is hard to imagine that it has been this much time.”\n\nNolan said she is grateful for the many opportunities DLA has afforded her over the years, from education, part-time work when her kids were young, being able to telework and fitness time.\n\nEmployees who volunteered during the Take Your Daughters and Sons to Work Day annual event were also recognized. The event is DLA Troop Support’s longest running community relations program.\n\n“It is good to see an organization that takes the time to recognize everybody’s efforts for what they do,” said Carr. “From volunteer efforts as it was with bring your children to work day, to work with humanitarian aid efforts, everybody on every team means something and their impact is felt across the board.”"
