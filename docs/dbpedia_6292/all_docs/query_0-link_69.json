Following a nearly six year struggle with lymphoma, Shelby survived twice her life expectancy with determination and fearlessness, not attempting to dissuade God's vision but rather to lengthen her time with her loved ones on this earthly place before rising to her eternal ecstasy where she no longer had to conceal her angel wings.\n\nAlthough words were inescapable, when Shelby knew her final moment was approaching she chose to use her final trace of energy to open her eyes and take one last glimpse of her family bedside while sharing a shedding of tears, hers of joyfulness, theirs of sorrow. Shelby waited until early moments of Sunday to depart this earth; she had spoken of wanting to celebrate her arrival to Heaven on the Lord's Day. Those family members present knew she had gone home to be welcomed by her grandparents and other family and friends that had been waiting for her so longingly. Shelby Jean Breon was born Oct. 8, 1937, in an upstairs bedroom of her grandparents' farm house in Sugar Valley, Pa., delivered by her grandmother, Linnie Mabel Lamey; her parents were Cecilia and Parse Breon. Shelby shared her childhood with six brothers and one sister.\n\nShelby's mother encouraged a young gentleman to call her by giving him her telephone number; he did and after a year of courting, Shelby married Robert Eugene Rhinehart of Avis on March 21, 1981. The date was chosen on this first day of spring to signify a new beginning for the two of them; the couple spent 27 years together. Shelby graduated from Sugar Valley High School at age 17 before working her way through college at Lock Haven University. She earned a bachelor's degree in education and spent the remaining years of her career influencing the lives of others by teaching them not only about school, but about life. She retired from Jersey Shore Area High School in 1997. Shelby is survived by her husband, Robert Rhinehart of Avis, children Gary (Linda) Lapp of Avis, Susan (Lenard) Kirkman of Mechanicsburg, and Dave (Gabi) Rhinehart of Beech Creek, grandchildren, Brooke (Micgar) Allen of York, Lindsey Lapp and Matthew Lapp both of Bloomsburg, Serena Kirkman of Mechanicsburg, Rick Thompson of Billings, Montana and Tim Rhinehart of Beech Creek, great grandchildren, Amethyst Shelby and Anthony Allen of York, brothers, James (Carol) Breon, Richard Breon both of Loganton, Donald (Gloria) Breon of Cammal, Terry (Ruth) Breon of Loganton, Jack (Barbara) Breon of Sparta, Tennessee, Barry (Cindy) Breon of McElhattan and a sister Sheri (Bill) Gardner of McElhattan. Shelby expected to be blessed with another great granddaughter, Seyla Lapp this spring. Countless other family and friends will also share in the loss of Shelby and miss her dearly. Shelby was predeceased by her daughter Susan Sheasley in 1985. Memorial service to bid Shelby farewell will be held at noon Friday, Feb. 27, 2009 at the Avis United Methodist Church with Rev. Tom Jones officiating. Shelby's Life Celebration will begin with a visitation Thursday evening from 6 until 9 p.m. at the Rearick-Carpenter Funeral Home, Ltd., \"A Life Celebration Home\" 1002 Allegheny St., Jersey Shore and on Friday from 11 a.m. until noon at the church.

Third St., Williamsport, PA 17701.

Warren Robinson, James Redka and William Beltz and the few special nurses and physicians on 3 East at the Williamsport Hospital who shared in Shelby's vigil with her family during her last week of life.

Crandall; On the morning of July 24, 2003, Canton Lake Hill resident Allen Eugene Crandall passed away peacefully at Dar-Way Nursing Home after a brief illness. He was 81 years of age. Born in Williamsport on Jan. 25, 1922, he was the son of Burdette Robert and Ella Mae (James) Crandall. An accomplished classical musician, Mr. Crandalls musical prowess manifested itself by the age of five. He became a boy chorister at Trinity Episcopal Church in Williamsport, where he also studied piano and organ. He would later serve as organist and choirmaster at Trinity, officiating at the 400th anniversary celebration of the English Book of Common Prayer. Mr. Crandall also served as organist at Christ Episcopal Church in Williamsport, and substituted at other churches in the city, as well as churches in Mansfield and Jersey Shore. As a youth he attended Williamsport Elementary School, and spent two years at Williamsport High School before transferring to a school in Connecticut. He answered our countrys call to arms during World War II, serving with the Army Air Corps. He was trained in radar and electronic design. During his tour of duty he was sent to India and across the Himalayas to a one man radar station in southwestern China. He spent many months alone there, and his fathers cousin, Rhoda Hackett, then editor of the Canton Independent-Sentinel, wrote a story about Mr. Crandalls China experience. Following the war he earned a B.A. from Mansfield and an M.A. from Penn State. He taught music in Potter County schools, and later at a private Episcopal school in Hawaii.

Technology fascinated him, from the old one-cylinder generator at the familys summer home on Lake Nephawin, to creating his own sound recording studio, to developing color photographic film, to the mechanical and electrical workings of pipe organs, to steam locomotives. As a boy, he often boarded the Williamsport to Canton train with his bicycle in the baggage car, and then would bicycle home at the end of the weekend. A strong advocate of animal rights and a great lover of nature, Mr. Crandall eventually made the summer home on Cantons Lake Nephawin his permanent residence.\n\nMr. Crandall is survived by nieces, Mrs. Warren (Janie) Erb and Jacqueline Crandall Kurtz of Williamsport; nephews, James Crandall Jr. of Williamsport and Bob Musko of Hackettstown, N.J., and numerous great-nieces and great-nephews.
