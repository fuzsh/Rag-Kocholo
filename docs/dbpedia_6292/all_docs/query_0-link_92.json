        "text": "Mercy Anne/ Ann Coles.\n\nBorn February 1, 1838, Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island. Died February 11, 1921, Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island. Not much is known about Mercy. She was one of 12 children of George Coles (1810-1875) and Mercy (née Haines) Coles of P.E. I. Mercy would accompany her parents in 1864 to the events leading up to Canadian Confederation. They travelled to Quebec City, Montreal, and on to Niagara Falls, Ontario. It is known from comments in documents from Sir John A. Macdonald, Canadas 1st Prime Minister and a political power figure, in the years building up to Confederation that the Coles daughters were attractive, well educated, and well informed. On his part, at this time he was a widower who was considered quite eligible to unattached women. At 26 years of age in 1864 when the Quebec Conference to consider Canadian Confederation took place, Mercy would have been one of the older unattached women. She was an ardent diarist and her legacy is that she has left behind the scene details which serve to enliven the rather dry political happenings of the day. There were numerous soirees, balls, and other social events that were used to court the visiting politicians to join Canada but were also used by the unattached ladies, such as Mercy, to entice courting from the eligible single politicians. Details, such as those of the ball of October 14, 1864, hosted by Governor General Lord Monck in the Parliament Buildings, were recorded by Mercy with particular attention paid to these unattached gentlemen. Alas, Marcy did not gain a suitor at the described events but remained single, living out her life in Charlottetown.
