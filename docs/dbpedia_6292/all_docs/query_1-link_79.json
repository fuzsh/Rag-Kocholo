Every spot at the table\n\nhad its own untouched place setting, and on every empty seat, organizers taped a photo of a hostage\n\nwith the words “KIDNAPPED” or\n\n“MURDERED” written in bold letters above their face.\n\nLess than 24 hours earlier, the Los\n\nAngeles Police Department arrested 93 protesters for participating in\n\nthe pro-Palestinian “Gaza Solidarity\n\nOccupation” at Alumni Park.\n\nSabrina Jahan, one of the students\n\nwho arranged the Seder and a senior majoring in business administration with an emphasis in finance,\n\nsaid she and her friends “felt that it\n\nwas more important than ever” to\n\nhost the empty Seder because she felt\n\nthe presence of the “Gaza Solidarity\n\nOccupation” was contributing to\n\nstudents experiencing “more harassment, just because of their Jewish,\n\npro-Israel or Zionist identities.”\n\nAfter the organizers finished setting up the empty Seder, pro-Palestinian and pro-Israel students began arguing in front of the display.\n\nJahan said she witnessed a woman\n\nwho appeared to be a student spitting at the feet of one of the Jewish\n\norganizers. A video from the Seder\n\nappeared to show the incident.\n\nThe same day, a man who did\n\nnot appear to be affiliated with\n\nthe University approached Jahan\n\nand her friends and proceeded\n\nto perform the Nazi salute. Jahan\n\nalso caught this incident on video.\n\nUSC’s chapter of Jewish Voice for\n\nPeace also held a Seder for Palestine\n\nthe day after Jahan and her friends\n\nheld their empty Seder for the hostages in Gaza. JVP’s event featured various speakers, singing and a Seder plate\n\npainted on a white tablecloth.\n\nDuring the Seder, a man who did not\n\nappear affiliated with the University\n\ninterrupted a speaker from the organization Southwest Asian & North\n\nAfrikan - Los Angeles to yell, “Fuck\n\nyou, Jews. Go home. This is America.”\n\nThe man initially left but not long\n\nafter returned and said, “Go home. Go\n\nfucking home,” to which a Seder participant said, “We are home.” The man\n\nthen threatened to break the nose of a\n\nmember of the Seder’s safety team and\n\nattempted to break through the team\n\nto reach the protesters. He also hit a\n\nparticipant’s drink out of her hand.\n\nSince Oct. 7, the Department of\n\nPublic Safety received four reports\n\nthey classified as antisemitic hate\n\ncrimes, a rise from the one report DPS\n\nreceived during the same period last\n\nyear, according to DPS Assistant Chief\n\nDavid Carlisle. Several Jewish students\n\ntold the Daily Trojan they felt increasingly unsafe on campus this past year.\n\nHana Masrour, a junior majoring\n\nin business administration, was one\n\namong numerous other students who\n\nsaid she went home early because she\n\n“did not feel safe as a Jewish student\n\nwalking around on campus” after the\n\nencampment began April 24.\n\nAnother student, who spoke to the\n\nDaily Trojan on the condition of anonymity out of fear for his safety, also\n\nsaid he felt that going home was the\n\n“only way” he could finish the semester and do well in his classes.\n\nPaul Lerner, a professor of history, said while some signs in\n\nthe encampment also made him\n\nfeel uncomfortable as a Jewish\n\nman with many loved ones living\n\nin Israel, he did not see student\n\nprotesters as the true threat to the\n\nJewish community on campus.\n\n“I am really concerned about antisemitism, but I’m much more concerned about antisemitism coming from the Christian nationalists\n\nthan I am about antisemitism coming from the encampment,” Lerner\n\nsaid. “Whatever they are — Christian\n\nnationalists, white supremacists —\n\nthey’re not our friends as Jews.”\n\nLerner and — at the time — 48\n\nother USC Jewish and Jewish studies faculty and staff signed a letter\n\nMay 8, condemning the arrests and\n\nforced removal of encampment protesters. The group’s letter states that\n\nantisemitism had been nationally\n\nweaponized in order to silence protesters and that the University needed to hear from the students, “many\n\nof them also Jewish,” who condemned\n\nIsrael’s actions against Palestinians.\n\n“Far from fighting antisemitism —\n\na serious problem that, like all forms\n\nof bigotry and racism, requires a rigorous approach — the university’s\n\nactions have distorted principled,\n\npeaceful protest and demonized encamped students,” the letter reads.\n\nAfter classes and finals came to an\n\nend, arguments between pro-Palestinian and pro-Israel community members continued online. For some students, however, hateful comments and\n\nmessages had been a regular occurrence since the war began.\n\nThe anonymous student shared\n\nscreenshots of death threats he\n\nand his pro-Israel co-organizers\n\nreceived this year, with one man\n\ncalling the students an antisemitic\n\nslur and saying he hoped they got\n\n“caught in the next school shooting,” and that “Hitler did nothing\n\nwrong [sic] Israel will be destroyed.”\n\nThe student said the protests,\n\non top of the threatening\n\nmessages he and his friends were\n\nreceiving online, were also taking\n\na toll on his mental health.\n\n“When they’re vandalizing statues\n\nand ruining graduation and harassing students, it’s extremely frustrating,” the student said. “As someone\n\nwho’s lived in Israel, as someone who\n\nhas family and friends in Israel, as\n\nsomeone who has lost friends and\n\nfamily in this conflict and Oct. 7 specifically, it is extremely frustrating\n\nthat I’m not able to engage in a productive dialogue that moves the needle forward towards peace.”\n\nProtesters vandalized the\n\nTommy Trojan statue April 27,\n\nspray painting “SAY NO TO\n\nGENOCIDE” on the base. Protesters\n\nalso vandalized the Youth Triumphant\n\nJewish students discuss incidents\n\nof antisemitism, harassment on campus\n\nSome students said they no\n\nlonger felt safe on campus\n\nduring end-of-year protests.\n\n| see ANTISEMITISM, page 2 |\n\nBy sCaRLeTT LOVaLLO\n\nStudent Health Beat Writer\n\nStudent Health services — including primary care, specialty\n\nservices and mental health counseling — will continue supporting\n\nstudents during the summer, Chief\n\nCampus Health Officer Dr. Sarah\n\nVan Orman said in a briefing with\n\nthe Daily Trojan on May 22.\n\nSummer can be a good time for students to check in on their health, Van\n\nOrman said, and consider practicing a\n\nnew healthy habit — such as daily exercise, nutrition, meditation or sleep.\n\n“Many of our students — they get\n\nreally busy during the year [and]\n\nmaybe don’t have time to have general preventive health services … [or]\n\nto see somebody about [a health issue] … We have students who might\n\nhave been struggling with mental\n\nhealth issues over the semester but\n\nhaven’t seen anyone,” Van Orman\n\nsaid. “Those are all great things to\n\nthink about seeking out health services over the summer.”\n\nStudents can also access services\n\nfor acute care or routine medical visits, including annual physical exams,\n\nimmunizations and recommended\n\npreventive care screenings.\n\n“As students move through\n\ntheir career, maybe they don’t\n\ngo home for the summer … [and]\n\nthey move away from a previous\n\nprimary care provider,” Van\n\nOrman said. “That’s something\n\navailable through Student Health\n\n— not just if you’re sick or have an\n\nillness or injury — but also just\n\n[to] get routine services.”\n\nAs Student Health services remain available, Van Orman encouraged students to consider summer\n\nhealth risks — including greater ultraviolet radiation exposure — and\n\ntake preventive health measures.\n\n“People may be outside [and] exposed to sun more, so just [be] mindful\n\nabout sunscreen, UV protective clothing and wearing hats … to reduce\n\nyour long-term risk of skin damage as\n\nwell as skin cancer,” Van Orman said.\n\nIf students have a new partner, preventive health behaviors — as appropriate — are recommended, including\n\nusing condoms, being tested and considering PrEP — pre-exposure prophylaxis, a medication prescribed to\n\nprevent contracting HIV. Students can\n\nschedule an appointment with campus health providers for relevant health services during the summer.\n\nAs students leave campus for the\n\nsummer, Van Orman said that mixed\n\nfeelings may accompany change —\n\nand campus mental health services\n\nremain available for support.\n\n“For some students [returning\n\nhome], it feels odd [when] they have\n\nto renavigate [and] negotiate relationships with their family [and]\n\nfriends … [and] it sometimes can\n\nfeel hard or lonely,” Van Orman\n\nsaid. “Seek out help if you need it,\n\nbut just recognize it’s part of the\n\nchange you’re going through.”\n\nCounseling and Mental Health\n\nServices offer therapy appointments, nonclinical “Let’s Talk”\n\nsessions and health workshops\n\n— for stress-management skills,\n\nrestorative sleep tips and support\n\nfor students who may be experiencing depression or anxiety.\n\nStudents can schedule services\n\nand workshops via mySHR.\n\nIf not enrolled in summer term\n\nclasses, students can opt in to\n\nthe Summer Health Fee to access\n\nStudent Health services — and those residing in California remain\n\neligible for telehealth visits.\n\n“Students might be out-of-state … [and] they’re not sure what\n\nto do — they [may] need help navigating, locating a healthcare provider or [continuing treatment]\n\nfor a health care condition,” Van\n\nOrman said. “Reach out to us, and\n\neven if we can’t provide direct services, we will be glad to help you\n\nfigure out what’s the next best\n\nstep to get connected to care.”\n\nStudent Health services will be available throughout summer\n\nStudents can opt in to the\n\nSummer Health Fee if they\n\nare not in summer classes.\n\nKate McQuarrie / Daily Trojan\n\nSabrina Jahan, a senior majoring in business administration with an emphasis in finance, hosted an empty\n\nPassover Seder in front of the Trousdale North Entrance with her friends to honor the over 130 hostages in Gaza.\n\nPaGE 2 May 29, 2024 | WWW.D a I Ly TROJ a N.COM NEWS\n\nFountain at Alumni Park, spray painting “FREE GAZA” and “STOLEN\n\nLAND” on the fountain.\n\nThe USC Divest from Death\n\nCoalition posted pictures of the two\n\nvandalized statues on its Instagram\n\naccount later that day, accompanied by the caption: “After students\n\nreclaimed Alumni Park, DPS and\n\nLAPD have begun circling campus\n\nand parked outside school gates.\n\nFollowing their failed attempts at repression on Wednesday, though, the\n\ncowardly pigs are threatened by the\n\nstudents’ power and are too scared\n\nto enter campus! Show up to Alumni\n\nPark to support USC students in\n\ntheir Gaza solidarity occupation!”\n\nOn April 28, however, the coalition\n\nreleased a statement on Instagram\n\nthat stated that the graffiti violated their “no desecration of the land”\n\nand “no autonomous action endangering the collective” community\n\nguidelines. The post stated that “the\n\nperson who spray painted was not a\n\nmember of the occupation.”\n\nOn May 3 — two days before DPS\n\nand the LAPD cleared the encampment from Alumni Park for the second and final time of the semester — President Carol Folt released\n\na Universitywide statement that\n\nread, “Free speech and assembly\n\ndo not include the right to obstruct\n\nequal access to campus, damage\n\nproperty, or foment harassment,\n\nviolence, and threats.”\n\nFolt did not directly name the\n\nUSC Divest from Death Coalition\n\nor encampment protesters in her\n\ncondemnation of “harassment, violence, and threats” or elaborate on\n\nthe instances that had taken place.\n\nIn a written statement to the\n\nDaily Trojan, the coalition wrote\n\nthat they were “deeply disappointed”\n\nwith Folt’s “continual mischaracterization” of the encampment.\n\n“From our community guidelines\n\nto the consistent support of faculty\n\nand staff, our camp has been a space\n\nof collective unity. In stark contrast,\n\nFolt’s administration seems to default\n\nto unleashing police forces to torment, brutalize and repress USC students,” the statement read.\n\nThe USC Divest from Death\n\nCoalition had 10 community\n\nguidelines, which included “no desecration of the land,” “respect[ing]\n\npersonal boundaries,” “not engaging\n\nwith Zionist counter-protesters” and\n\n“approaching confict [sic] with the\n\ngoal of addressing and repairing.”\n\nThe coalition also condemned\n\nFolt and her administration for\n\nfailing to acknowledge or punish\n\nthe “countless documented cases\n\nof harassment against our Gaza\n\nSolidarity Occupation.”\n\n“If Folt were actually to care about\n\nUSC students, she would have to first\n\nacknowledge the excessive police violence her administration enacted on\n\nthe student body — which she has not,”\n\nthe statement read. “The harassment\n\nour occupation faced highlights the\n\ngrowing contradictions of the Folt\n\nadministration’s weaponization of\n\nracist & classist notions of safety to\n\nevade genuine accountability.”\n\nThe Daily Trojan was not able to\n\nreview the cases of harassment the\n\ncoalition referred to in their statement by the time of publication.\n\nAmong the chants used by protesters at the encampment, some\n\nused the word “intifada,” which directly translates from Arabic to\n\n“shaking off,” but in the context of\n\nIsrael and Palestine, refers to two\n\nmajor Palestinian uprisings that\n\ntook place from 1987 to 1993 and\n\nfrom 2000 to 2005. Protesters also\n\nused the phrase, “From the river to\n\nthe sea, Palestine will be free,” which\n\nthe U.S. House of Representatives\n\nclassified as antisemitic in April.\n\nSeveral Jewish students told the\n\nDaily Trojan that hearing the phrases made them feel unsafe.\n\n“People can say it means ‘shivering off’ or ‘shaking off’ or whatever\n\nthe connotation of it is, but the first\n\nand second Intifada killed thousands of Israelis,” the anonymous\n\nstudent said. “It literally means calling for violence against Jews.”\n\nOther Jewish students expressed\n\nsimilar sentiments, saying the\n\nphrase was painful for them to hear.\n\n“What they’re chanting is extremely violent,” Masrour said.\n\n“If you simply do a quick Google\n\nsearch of what the Intifada is, the\n\nfirst thing will pop up is that it is\n\nterrorism, so it’s kind of disturbing\n\nto hear that chanted at school.”\n\nIn a written statement to the\n\nDaily Trojan, JVP wrote, “For many\n\nAmerican Jews, ‘intifada’ does indeed\n\ninvoke images of historical violence\n\nand terror,” but the chapter wrote that\n\nthe use of the word was “employed in\n\ndirect and intentional solidarity with\n\nPalestinian resistance movements.”\n\n“We choose to remember the\n\nentire Intifadas as they occurred\n\nbetween 1987 and 2005: the disproportionate use of force and\n\nviolence by the Israeli military\n\nagainst demonstrators, the unequal death toll of Palestinians\n\nas compared to Israeli Jews, and\n\nthe suppressive and illegal tactics\n\nused by the Israeli government to\n\nsquash peaceful protest in occupied Palestine,” the statement read.\n\nLerner said while he didn’t like slogans that referenced the abolition of\n\nIsrael or the phrase “from the river to\n\nthe sea” and preferred ones that called\n\nfor the end of Israel’s war in Gaza and\n\nthe return of the hostages held in Gaza,\n\nhe was “very reluctant to classify certain kinds of slogans as hate speech,\n\nunless they’re specifically threats.”\n\n“I shouldn’t control what another\n\ngroup says, and it’s not my place to\n\ntell people, ‘Protest the way I want\n\nyou to protest because your words\n\nmake me uncomfortable,’” he said.\n\nTo Lerner, the administration’s first\n\npriority should have been to heal divisions on campus, and the University’s\n\ndecision to bring in the police and lock\n\ndown campus only divided the community further. Facilitating an open\n\ndialogue would, in his eyes, be the first\n\nstep toward fostering understanding\n\nand compassion between people\n\non both sides of the war.\n\n“What I’ve barely seen at USC\n\nat all — and this is where I think\n\nthere’s a real failure of leadership\n\n— is having these difficult conversations,” Lerner said. “There’s a lot\n\nof ignorance on both sides of this\n\nissue, and as faculty, we have a lot of\n\npeople at this University who could\n\nbe helpful in bridging some differences and having conversations,\n\nand I see … that there are students\n\nwho are having these conversations, but they’re not really getting\n\nleadership from the University.”\n\naNTISEMITISM | Faculty call for open dialogues on Israel, Palestine\n\n| continued from page 1 |\n\nZongyi Wang / Daily Trojan\n\nUSC’s chapter of Jewish Voice for Peace wrote in a statement to the Daily Trojan that they used\n\nthe Arabic word “intifada” “in direct and intentional solidarity with Palestinian resistance movements.”\n\nPublished weekly on Wednesdays in May and June during\n\nthe summer session by the University of Southern California in\n\nStudent Union 402, MC 0895,\n\nLos Angeles, California 90089-0895.\n\nDaily Trojan mail subscriptions are $265 per year.\n\nTypeset by the Office of Student Publications at USC.\n\nPrinted by Gardena Valley News in Gardena, California.\n\nEDITORIAL MATTER · Editorial opinions expressed in the\n\nSummer Trojan are those of the respective writers, and do not\n\nnecessarily reflect those of the University of Southern California,\n\nits faculty or student body.

As freshly\n\ngraduated high school seniors preparing to enter college, you may be clouded by the concern that the institutions\n\nyou have looked up to for the longest\n\ntime are not what you imagined. When\n\nthe glamorous facades are disrupted,\n\nyou are left reevaluating your options.\n\nWith the ongoing campus protests\n\naround the nation, and the challenges and disputes that have come with\n\nthem, you may feel a sense of distrust and uncertainty. I am here to\n\ntell you that even though it may be\n\nintimidating to enter a space that is\n\nsurrounded by academic and civil\n\nturmoil, you have plentiful support\n\nand mentorship on this journey.\n\nAlthough the joy of being admitted to USC gave me great satisfaction,\n\nwhen I first arrived during orientation\n\nweek as an international student, I was\n\nincredibly concerned that I made the\n\nwrong decision. I quickly concluded\n\nthat I could never see myself fitting\n\nin simply because I had too much\n\n“catching up” to do in terms of understanding Southern Californian\n\nculture and social norms.\n\nNonetheless, 10 months later, I am\n\nenjoying a summer filled with stable\n\nfriendships and opportunities I never thought to explore before.\n\nThe truth is, just as transitioning\n\nfrom the pandemic to an in-person\n\nsetting was uneasy for the upperclassmen, pretending like the world\n\nis back to normal after two months of\n\nstrict regulations and widespread anxiety will be difficult — particularly for\n\nfirst-years getting accustomed to the\n\nflow of the college lifestyle. However,\n\ndespite what you have learned, please\n\ngive USC a chance and get to know this\n\nplace through your own eyes.\n\nYou may be familiar with the optimistic review of USC being the epitome\n\nof a “work hard, play hard” attitude.”\n\nOr, you may be immersed in the contrasting criticisms about the recent\n\nevents on campus with a heavy\n\nemotional backdrop. The most important principle you should take\n\naway from this information is to\n\nhone your critical thinking abilities: Instead of letting these polarized reviews dictate your initial impression, you need to generate an\n\nindependent judgment about your\n\nupcoming freshman experience.\n\nUSC is not a monolithic space with\n\na predominant, mainstream opinion.\n\nIn fact, I was somewhat offended when\n\nI discovered that The New York Times\n\nreferred to the activities occurring at\n\nour school as a symptom of “unexpected activism,” casually assuming that\n\nwe are incapable of taking ourselves\n\nas seriously as students at UC Berkeley\n\nor other historically politically active\n\ninstitutions. This popular rhetoric is\n\noutdated, as I have always found myself\n\nsurrounded by intense yet practical\n\nconversations about our place in the\n\nworld and the future we may construct.\n\nUnlike what the press has been\n\npropagating, this type of social inquiry does not only exist in extreme\n\nscenarios such as rallies and public\n\nspeeches. It survives well in dining\n\nhall chats, picnics on the great lawns\n\nand the backyards of house parties.\n\nHowever, you don’t have to feel discouraged or afraid just because we\n\nas a student body have deviated from\n\nthe initial lighthearted expectations\n\nwe were given by adults who live far\n\nfrom USC. After enduring a series of\n\nscandals and leadership changes,\n\nwe have proved that we can reclaim\n\nthe power to manage our lives with\n\nconfidence and autonomy.\n\nExtending from that, take advantage of the duality you perceive.\n\nWhen I engage with the different\n\nclusters of social circles at USC, I am\n\nconstantly consumed by the overwhelming happiness of being able\n\nto juggle between peers with different personalities and interests.\n\nI would stay up until 3 a.m. having deep contemplations about the\n\nconceptual systems introduced in\n\nmy Thematic Option classes, but\n\nI would also grab midnight meals\n\nin Koreatown with members of my\n\nclubs after a long event. The freedom to devote yourself is liberating,\n\nbut you also have to understand that\n\nthere is no threshold for how much\n\nor how little you should commit to\n\nmany compelling communities.\n\nLastly, if I may offer some simple\n\nadvice, invest in a hammock so you\n\ncan bathe in the sun when the weather is nice, try to go off-campus as often as possible and don’t get into a\n\nrelationship your first semester.\n\nRemember, take ownership of your\n\nunique experiences. You are the future, and the rest of us will be here\n\nwatching as you discover your new\n\nself when August comes around.\n\nTo the class of 2028, here’s my advice\n\nThis new chapter at USC\n\nwon’t be easy, but you can\n\ninfluence your experience.\n\nBy LUIsA LUO\n\nStaff Writer\n\nThe nation has its eyes on USC.\n\nWhile the University is caught in\n\nthe storm assessing every move,\n\nit’s time to shift the focus from\n\nthe press to the very construct of\n\nour institutional endowments.\n\nBefore dissecting the essential\n\nflaws in our current leadership hierarchy, it is important to unpack\n\nthe roots of our ongoing tensions\n\nso the administration and the students are on the same page about\n\nthe demands for divestment. When\n\nthe organizing groups such as the\n\nDivest from Death Coalition chanted the word “disclose,” they called\n\nfor endowment transparency.\n\nThis may seem like a simple task\n\nsince it does not require direct changes to the University’s finances, and it\n\nis merely asking for information to be\n\npublicized. Nonetheless, many schools\n\nchoose to reserve these astronomical\n\nnumbers behind closed doors.\n\nFinancial representatives stated\n\nthey were unwilling to disclose for\n\nthe sake of protecting the integrity\n\nof their investments; they want to\n\navoid their risks and returns from\n\nbeing skewed by public opinions.\n\nSo, to prioritize profits and stir away\n\nfrom political pressure, administrations shielded their financial statuses and decision-making processes.\n\nIn this light, not only is divestment\n\ndifficult to achieve, but even transparency seems far from reach, especially when USC is trying to separate itself\n\nfrom prevalent political disputes, establishing an independent, isolated brand.\n\nThis idea echoes the mission statement\n\nissued by the Board of Trustees, as they\n\ninsist that they are “unfettered by political control.” However, this statement\n\nwas adopted in 1993, which casts doubt\n\non whether the outdated principle can\n\nstill address contemporary crises.\n\nIt’s impossible to say our campus is\n\ndevoid of political discussions when\n\nstudents are consistently engaging in\n\ndiscourse through institutional projects such as the Shoah Foundation\n\nand the Center for Advanced Genocide\n\nResearch. The two centers study survivors’ accounts of historical atrocities and the origins of mass violence.\n\nNaturally, they also stimulate conversations about human rights, and this\n\ntype of exchange should be encouraged. However, when students want\n\nto challenge these inquiries through\n\na critical lens outside of these\n\nacademic spaces, they do not have\n\naccess to democratic platforms that\n\nguarantee freedom of expression.\n\nLet’s be clear, I am not here to argue that USC’s hierarchical structure is completely ineffective. In fact,\n\nas a private university, our administration carries itself differently from\n\nhow the UC Board of Regents operates, considering that we do not receive governmental funding and\n\ncharge higher tuition, resulting in a\n\ncomplex pool of monetary incomes.\n\nBut, to fix the misalignments\n\nbetween students and the administration, both sides should be more\n\nreceptive to reimagining shared\n\nvalues. This broadened perspective requires reaching for consensus\n\nthrough bottom-up feedback loops.\n\nUSC should conduct the following\n\nreforms to keep up with the shifting\n\nlandscapes of the modern world.\n\nFirst, the Academic Senate needs\n\nto stay updated with its meeting minutes to maintain transparency. The\n\nlast time this record-keeping documentation was uploaded was in\n\nJanuary. Instead of a detailed outline\n\nwith a Q&A section, the only information about the May 8 meeting is\n\nthe one-page agenda listing the item\n\n“President Folt and Provost Guzman\n\nDiscussion” with no further details.\n\nAlthough the University announced that the meeting resulted\n\nin Folt’s censure, we cannot grasp\n\nthe nuanced debate that resulted in\n\nthat decision. The thorough explanation of this procedure will allow\n\nthe public to understand how the\n\nrepresentative body finalized judgments about Folt and Guzman.\n\nSecond, the Academic Senate\n\nneeds to expand its demographics\n\nbeyond established chairs and department heads. It is currently composed\n\nof only 46 voting members, a striking\n\n1% of USC’s total full-time faculty.\n\nThrough a series of Letters to the\n\nEditor published by the Daily Trojan\n\nand responses on social media, we can\n\nsee a significant portion of professors\n\nstrongly sympathized with their students, not just on the cause but also on\n\nphysical mistreatment and legal punishments against students. The faculty\n\nfocused USC’s resources on educational initiatives. Now more than ever,\n\nwe must recognize their social justice-oriented service to our community and allow for their contributions to shine through.\n\nThird, the administration needs to\n\nprovide thorough justifications for the\n\nUniversity’s investments. If we commit to divestments from the fossil\n\nfuel industry, the University is not utterly non-negotiable in terms of withdrawing partnerships and leveraging\n\nenvironmental, social and governance\n\nstandards. So, if the administration\n\ncollaborated with students for our sustainability cause just a year ago, then\n\nthey should also comply with their\n\n“Investment Stewardship Policy”\n\nin the current controversy.\n\nLast, the University needs to foster an environment that balances the\n\nstakeholders and students. We have\n\nall heard the saying that students are\n\n“never on the wrong side of history.”\n\nWhile this rhetoric may sound naive,\n\nI uphold that it is not about picking a\n\nside, but rather about writing the historical narrative ourselves.\n\nThe practice of introducing the\n\nLos Angeles Police Department and\n\ninflicting violence is not new to the\n\nUniversity. During the protests\n\nagainst apartheid in South Africa\n\nin 1990, USC students encountered\n\nsimilar clashes in their struggles.\n\nYet today, with historical hindsight,\n\nwe collectively acknowledge corporate social responsibility as a crucial form of self-regulation.\n\nLearning a tough lesson from the\n\npast instances of resisting unethical\n\ncorporations, we should be consistent with our beliefs and craft codes\n\nof conduct by incorporating students’\n\ninput. These regulations would devise categories for the businesses we\n\ninvest in based on their ESG practices, and decide the degree of financial commitment we should devote\n\nto each category. This teamwork\n\nwill minimize conflicts between\n\nthe different parties of interest\n\nand act as an imperative component for USC’s future success.\n\nUSC admin needs to reconsider their governing structure\n\nThe University must review\n\nits own management system\n\nwith checks and balances.\n\nK Cox / Daily Trojan\n\nArielle Rizal / Daily Trojan\n\nArts & Entertainment\n\nPAGE 4 | WEdnEsdAy, MAy 29, 2024 | WWW.DAILYTROJAN.COM/AE\n\nBy GIAnnA CAnTO\n\nStaff Writer\n\nBranded as an alternative rock\n\nband, Wallows makes true-to-heart\n\nindie pop for the masses. On “Model,”\n\nthe band’s third studio album, listeners find Braeden Lemasters, Dylan\n\nMinnette and Cole Preston doing just\n\nthat. It’s no groundbreaking feat, no\n\nextensively drawn-out metaphorical\n\nthemes, not an off-kilter experiment\n\npushing the boundaries of music;\n\nthis album is the Wallows blueprint,\n\nthe band doing what it does best. So,\n\nif you take the album for what it is,\n\nyou won’t be disappointed.\n\nIn the context of the band’s previous releases, “Model” is their\n\nGoldilocks record. The mixes are not\n\nas busy as its predecessor, “Tell Me\n\nThat It’s Over,” and the songs are not\n\nas narratively focused as their first record, “Nothing Happens.” “Model” is\n\na just-right medley of easy-to-listento, easy-to-digest and easily-stuckin-your-head tracks for the teens and\n\n20-somethings to jump around to.\n\nMarking the band’s second endeavor with John Congleton — the\n\nproducer of their debut album —\n\n“Model” feels like a reintroduction\n\nto Wallows. Its tracks make up\n\nthe backbone of their sound, taking off from a more developed version of the stripped-down guitar,\n\nbass and drums that fans fell in\n\nlove with in their earliest singles.\n\nIn perfecting the Wallows formula, the band has come into its own\n\nwith a newfound confidence listeners can hear from the get-go.\n\n“Model” erupts with breakneck\n\nspeed in its opening tracks, a game of\n\nmusical leapfrog that grips listeners\n\nwith a three-track series of upbeat\n\nexcitement. On “Your Apartment,”\n\nrolling drums and guitar loop\n\nthrough melodic piano chords,\n\nclocking the pace and setting the\n\ntone for what’s to follow. Tension\n\nbuilds as Minnette recounts the\n\nchallenging flurry of emotions that\n\ncome with the end of a relationship.\n\nOver before you know it, this\n\ndrawn-out build and quick release\n\nis a pattern worked well into the\n\nWallows form. It’s part of what makes\n\nWallows songs so addicting, a headbopping kind of catharsis that gets\n\nfans to their feet, shouting at the top\n\nof their lungs. The band puppeteers\n\nyour brain’s reward system, building\n\nthis prolonged anticipation to make\n\nthe song’s fateful conclusion all the\n\nmore enjoyable, satisfying your craving with the next track before you can\n\neven realize you wanted more.\n\n“Anytime, Always” kicks off with\n\nclean guitar and a persistent bass line,\n\nan outline deceptively reminiscent of\n\nNew album ‘Model’ sees Wallows in full bloom\n\n| see WALLOWS, page 5 |\n\nJason Pham / Daily Trojan\n\nCalic Bagels offers a variety of brunch favorites, according to columnist\n\nJason Pham. Head over to the spot for fantastic stuffed bagels.\n\nStuffed bagels are my latest\n\ngo-to brunch bangers\n\nHappy summer, Trojans!\n\nThis is my first break based\n\nin Los Angeles, so I’m\n\nexcited to continue exploring the\n\nfood landscape that the warmer\n\nweather has to offer.\n\nAs the Californian sun returns, and\n\nsince I have a few mornings off during\n\nthe work week, I’ve found myself in\n\na brunch mood, frequenting more\n\noutdoor cafes to fill up my free time.\n\nSorting brunch plans in the school\n\nyear is difficult, with morning classes\n\nand weekend club events always on\n\nthe radar, so I’m glad to be taking\n\nadvantage of my last summer break.\n\nMy first stop on my newfound\n\nsummer cravings and explorations\n\nwas Calic Bagel. First introduced to\n\nme through a viral TikTok post, the\n\nrestaurant has garnered widespread\n\nrecognition for its delicious take\n\non bagels that are difficult to find\n\non the West Coast. After viewing\n\nmixed reviews online, I set aside\n\na Thursday morning with a friend\n\nto try the spot for ourselves.\n\nCalic Bagels is located inside\n\nMarkEat 8, a plaza near Koreatown\n\nthat houses several other local\n\nbusinesses, such as Seven Tigers Pie\n\nClub and Groundwork Coffee. The\n\nrestaurant features various signature\n\nsandwiches and endless iterations\n\nof bagels on its menu, from different\n\nspreads and schmears to their highly\n\npublicized stuffed versions.\n\nOnce we arrived at premier\n\nbrunch hours around 11:30 a.m., the\n\nrestaurant appeared busy but not\n\ntoo much to scare us away. Their\n\nwebsite suggests arriving early\n\nin the mornings as stuffed bagel\n\nquantities are limited, but we had\n\nno issues with our day and time.\n\nThe space appeared as a fast-casual\n\nenvironment with few seating options\n\nand many customers taking their\n\norders to go. The ordering process\n\nwas completely self-serve, with digital\n\nmenus and pay screens for a nocontact service style.\n\nAlthough the space was not the\n\nmost inviting in terms of face-to-face\n\ncustomer service, the prices were\n\nsomewhat reasonable for a hot new\n\nrestaurant on the market.\n\nPriced between $3 to $5 for\n\nschmears and $8 for stuffed bagels,\n\nthe restaurant can easily satisfy\n\nyour brunch cravings for a few\n\ndollars. Those with a larger appetite\n\ncan fuel up on the sandwiches\n\npriced from $8 to $15 as well as a\n\nwide selection of sides and drinks\n\n— including draft beer and wine\n\n(although maybe an interesting\n\nchoice at 11 a.m., personally).\n\nThe real crowning glory for\n\nme was Calic’s stuffed bagels.\n\nI ordered the Signature Calic\n\nstuffed bagel, which included\n\ngarlic butter dipped with garlic\n\ncream cheese for a tasteful yet\n\nsubtle delivery of seasoned flavors.\n\nPaired with the freshly baked,\n\nsweet breading, the stuffed bagel\n\nmade for a satisfactory brunch\n\n| see PHAM, page 5 |\n\nArielle Rizal / Daily Trojan\n\nJason\n\nPham\n\nDINING DOLLARS\n\nA & E May 29, 2024 | WWW.D a I Ly TROJ a N.COM PaGE 5\n\nThe Strokes, until the song unravels\n\ninto an exciting call and response that\n\nfeels like a punchier follow-up to the\n\nband’s 2019 single “Just Like a Movie.”\n\n“Calling After Me” has an intoxicating pop sense about it, with a\n\nspringy rhythm and catchy melody\n\nthat sticks to your brain like freshly\n\nchewed bubblegum. As much as these\n\nfirst few tracks work to raise your\n\nheart rate, all this momentum comes\n\nto a grinding halt, slowing the tempo\n\nwith the pared-down, reflective nature of “Bad Dream” and “A Warning.”\n\nThe heart of this album lies in\n\nits ease of access; it’s easy to latch\n\nonto, composed of a characteristic breeziness that comes to fruition at the heart of the album. After\n\nthe success of the band’s 2021 single “Quarterback,” Wallows devotees will undoubtedly lose their\n\nminds at the sound of “I Wouldn’t\n\nMind,” seeing drummer and USC\n\nalum Preston’s first official album\n\nappearance taking lead vocals.\n\nPreston’s vocals have a charming\n\nbashfulness to their simplicity that\n\npairs well with the flowing nature\n\nof the track’s instrumentals.\n\nBesides the bongos on “She’s an\n\nActress” — which feel somewhat out\n\nof place on first listen and definitely\n\ntake some getting used to — the album blossoms in its second half, a\n\nlush, expansive soundscape that feels\n\nlike it was meant to fill a room. “You\n\n(Show Me Where My Days Went)”\n\nand “Canada” express this airiness\n\nas Minnette floats between Adam\n\nLevine-inspired “She Will Be Loved”\n\nhigh notes, to the conversational\n\nsinging style Minnette previously adopted in hits like “Especially You.”\n\nThere’s a clear 2000s influence\n\non this record. “Don’t You Think\n\nIt’s Strange?” and other fast-paced\n\ntracks are reminiscent of a mid2000s indie sensibility, alluding to\n\nthe rhythm and guitar tone of bands\n\nlike Phoenix, The Kooks and Vampire\n\nWeekend. “Going Under” has a 2010s\n\npsychedelic twang to it, presenting\n\nitself with the ethereal expanse of\n\nMelody’s Echo Chamber. It unfolds\n\ninto its own interesting hybrid as\n\nLemasters fills the space with pentup discontent, completely letting go\n\nas the instrumentals swell — a nod\n\nto John Lennon’s straining cries in\n\nThe Beatles’ “Oh! Darling.”\n\nDrawing the album to a close\n\nwith its lighthearted tenderness,\n\n“Only Ecstasy” is a cinematic devotional fit to play out a coming-ofage movie. You can almost picture\n\nthe scene, the film’s main characters driving under a watercolor\n\nsunset with the top down, hands\n\nwaving in the wind as the harmony sings, “You are my only ecstasy /\n\nYou are the only one for me.”\n\nWine-drunk, middle-aged moms\n\nwould fiend over “Only Ecstasy”\n\nif Chris Martin got ahold of it,\n\nand in 10 to 15 years, Wallows\n\nfans will raise their glasses to\n\nits swaying melodies, what could\n\nvery well be their generational\n\nequivalent to Coldplay’s “Yellow.”\n\nWallows has undoubtedly found\n\nwhat works. It’s new but familiar,\n\nas authentic as they’ve sounded in\n\na while. This coherence reflects the\n\nconfidence that comes with finding your place and getting older.\n\nHaving made music together for almost two decades, Wallows has\n\ngrown with their music, and with\n\n“Model,” they’re not trying to be\n\nanything other than themselves.\n\nIn this way, an irony comes with\n\nthe album’s namesake. A model\n\nis deemed perfect by nature, and\n\nthough this album is far from infallible, it comes close to perfect in\n\nthe way that it represents the band.\n\n“Model” adopts the lighthearted humanity Wallows has made a\n\nname off of, becoming a touchpoint\n\nfor the roots of their sound. As the\n\nband embarks on their biggest tour\n\nto date — including stops at the\n\nKia Forum and Madison Square\n\nGarden — “Model” is sure to make\n\nfor quite the show, as fans across\n\nthe globe will catch a glimpse of\n\nWallows in full bloom.\n\nWaLLOWS\n\n| continued from page 4 |\n\nanthony Pham\n\nWallows released their latest album “Model” on May 24. The record\n\ncombines the group’s classic, lighthearted sound with a new twist.\n\nthat left me wanting to come\n\nback and try the other versions.\n\nThe cream cheese sat perfectly\n\npiped between cut sections of the\n\nbagel for easy pull-apart action and\n\nsharing with friends. The thick bagel\n\nbread was soft yet dense, which\n\nmade for a filling meal.\n\nWith habanero and pizza stuffed\n\nbagel options on the menu, the\n\nrestaurant also offers savory options\n\nfor those with more of a lunch craving.\n\nI also ordered the Calic tots off the\n\nsides menu, which featured a tater\n\ntot base with eggs, cheese and mixed\n\ngreens piled on top. The dish seemed\n\nmouthwatering in my head, but the\n\nCalic tots unfortunately didn’t taste\n\nvery cohesive. The eggs and cheese\n\ndried up fast, becoming stale on top of\n\nthe already dry tater tot texture.\n\nCalic Bagels was created and\n\nadvertised under ALMG Hospitality,\n\na group focused on “redefining” and\n\nrebranding the entertainment scene\n\nin L.A. and Koreatown through\n\ninnovative content. Restaurants\n\nsuch as Yup Dduk and Egg Tuck\n\nare also created and advertised\n\nthrough ALMG Hospitality.\n\nSince arriving in California\n\nand exploring the different\n\nlocal eateries, I’ve noticed\n\nsister restaurants and larger\n\nmanagement groups are more\n\ncommon than my experiences at\n\nhome in Oregon. Another one of my\n\nabsolute brunch favorites is NẾP\n\nCafe in Fountain Valley, owned by\n\nKei Concepts, a restaurant creation\n\ngroup also known for The Vox\n\nKitchen and INI Ristorante.\n\nAlthough these sister brands and\n\ncorporate ties are new to me, I’ve\n\ngrown to love exploring the different\n\nrestaurants a branding group has\n\nto offer if I already enjoy one of\n\ntheir eateries. It’s almost like a\n\nfilter or menu of new restaurants\n\nthat I know will be reliable.\n\nSo, if you’re out for a casual\n\nbrunch or want to try a taste of\n\nALMG Hospitality, Calic Bagels\n\nis a delicious destination for your\n\nnext L.A. itinerary.

Junior Amari\n\nAvery won her individual match by\n\ntwo holes after birdies on holes No. 16\n\nand 17, while senior Brianna Navarrosa\n\nand sophomore Catherine Park narrowly lost by scores of 2&1 and 3&2,\n\nrespectively. Both Navarrosa and Park\n\nheld one-hole leads early in the last\n\nnine holes of their respective matches,\n\nbut Stanford’s sophomore Kelly Xu\n\nand sophomore Megha Ganne won\n\nlate holes to best the Trojans. USC junior Cindy Kou struggled in her match\n\nand found herself down by five holes\n\nafter finishing the front nine.\n\nDuring USC’s date with Clemson\n\nin the quarterfinals, individual wins\n\nby Avery, freshman Bailey Shoemaker\n\nand Navarrosa led the Trojans to a\n\n3-1 victory over the Tigers. Navarrosa\n\ndominated and won by seven holes\n\nagainst Clemson’s sophomore Sydney\n\nRoberts. In what was Shoemaker’s\n\nmatch play debut, a clutch long putt\n\nled to her 3&2 win over sophomore\n\nIsabella Rawl, clinching the match for\n\nUSC. Avery won her match by six holes.\n\nUSC would not have had its matchplay success without its clutch performances throughout stroke play,\n\nas only the top-eight teams made it\n\nto the quarterfinals with the opportunity to advance to the championship. The Trojans struggled during the first day of stroke play, as\n\nthey posted their highest single total round of the year with 299 shots\n\n— good for 21st in a tie with Oregon\n\nState. However, USC had a complete\n\nturnaround the following day and\n\nmoved up 11 spots as they posted the\n\nsixth-lowest score of the day.\n\nNavarrosa led the Trojans in\n\nthat turnaround, carding one of\n\nthe day’s best scores with a 1-under-par round of 71. Three birdies with just two bogeys allowed\n\nNavarrosa to move up to 21st in the\n\nentire field, which was crucial after\n\nthe Trojans were 8-over-par after\n\nthe first nine holes. Avery finished\n\neven par on the day in what was a\n\nback-and-forth round, recording\n\ntwo birdies on both the front and\n\nback nine while a triple bogey on\n\nthe par-4 No. 13 hole kept her from\n\nshooting under-par for the round.\n\nThe final round of stroke play\n\nsaw two Trojans — Shoemaker and\n\nNavarrosa — record 1-under-par\n\nrounds, finishing 15th and 19th overall, respectively. Avery finished in\n\n19th with Shoemaker, after a 3-overpar round, ended with a total score\n\nof 4-over-par. Park struggled in this\n\nyear’s stroke play after finishing in\n\na tie for second overall at last year’s\n\nchampionships at 9-under-par, which\n\nwas the highest seen by a Trojan since\n\n2014.

The 2024 Paris Olympics\n\nwill feature one new sport, bringing a unique flavor to the games.\n\nBreaking, making its Olympic\n\ndebut, will showcase the artistry and athleticism of street\n\ndance. Skateboarding, sport\n\nclimbing and surfing after making their debut during the 2020\n\nTokyo Games. However, baseball,\n\nsoftball and karate, which were\n\npart of the 2020 Tokyo Games,\n\nwill not be returning this year.\n\nUSC’s Legacy in the\n\nOlympic Games\n\nUSC has a proud legacy in the\n\nOlympic Games, with 510 athletes\n\nwho have collected 326 medals including 153 golds, 96 silvers and 77\n\nbronzes. The cardinal and gold’s\n\nremarkable achievements come\n\nfrom the likes of Allyson Felix, John\n\nNaber, Andre De Grasse and Janet\n\nEvans, to name just a few.\n\nIn 2020, the Trojans sent a\n\nrecord 65 athletes to the Tokyo\n\nOlympics, where they placed on\n\nthe podium 21 times — the second most from a United States\n\nuniversity. USC had the most\n\ngold medalists, with 11.\n\nAs audiences eagerly anticipate the Paris 2024 Olympics, the\n\nparticipation of USC’s alumni and\n\ncurrent students promises to be a\n\nhighlight. From track and field to\n\nbeach volleyball to water polo, the\n\nTrojan spirit will be on full display\n\nin the French capital this summer.\n\nMichael Norman (Track)\n\nMichael Norman is one of the favorites to win the 400-meter dash\n\nin Paris for the U.S. In the 2020\n\nTokyo Olympics, Norman played\n\na pivotal role in securing gold for\n\nthe U.S. in the 4x400-meter relay.\n\nHowever, he came up short of the\n\npodium in his signature event —\n\nthe 400m — finishing fifth.\n\nThe Southern California native\n\nlooks prepared to make a statement\n\nat this year’s summer games. In 2022,\n\nhe became the first U.S. world champion in the 400m since 2013 at the\n\nWorld Athletics Championships\n\nwith a time of 44.29. Later in the\n\nyear, he improved that time, posting a season-best time of 44.07 in\n\nthe Olympic trials.\n\nKelly Cheng and Sara Hughes\n\n(Beach Volleyball)\n\nKelly Cheng and Sara Hughes\n\nwere both standout athletes for\n\nthe Trojans. They won back-toback NCAA titles in 2016 and 2017,\n\nlooking unbeatable on the sand.\n\nHowever, what seemed like a\n\nproblematic partnership for opponents needed to be more clearcut when they began their professional careers. In 2018, they split to\n\npursue different partners in their\n\nquest for the Tokyo Olympics. It\n\nwasn’t until late 2022 that they\n\nreunited, and their partnership\n\nhas since paid dividends.\n\nThe pair now sit fourth in\n\nthe Fédération Internationale de\n\nVolleyball global rankings following the Xiamen Challenge. They\n\nclinched the title at the Beach Pro\n\nTour finals in Doha, Qatar, marking\n\na significant achievement for a U.S.\n\npair since Alix Klineman and USC\n\nalum April Ross won gold in Tokyo.\n\nKaleigh Gilchrist, Emily\n\nAusmus, Amanda Longan and\n\nDenise Mammolito (Water Polo)\n\nWomen’s water polo looks to continue its gold medal win streak that\n\nbegan at the 2012 London Olympics.\n\nVeteran returners Kaleigh\n\nGilchrist, Amanda Longan and\n\nDenise Mammolito add heavily to\n\nthe star-studded American squad\n\nthat has become a women’s water polo powerhouse. However, the\n\nAmericans also enter with youth in\n\ntheir team this year. USC freshman\n\nphenom Emily Ausmus — who took\n\na gap year for the 2024 Games —\n\nwill make her Olympic debut.\n\nAusmus is no stranger to playing in higher roles against older players. The 18-year-old from\n\nRiverside, California, competed\n\nat the Pan American Junior Water\n\nPolo Championships at just 12\n\nyears old — a tournament typically for players 19 and under.\n\nGilchrist, Longan and Mammolito\n\nall made their mark during their\n\ntime as Trojans, with Gilchrist\n\ncontributing to NCAA titles in\n\n2013, Longan leading to championships in 2016 and 2018 and\n\nMammolito playing a pivotal role\n\nin victories in 2018 and 2021.\n\nThe Paris Olympic Games will\n\nopen July 26 on the River Seine\n\nand close Aug. 11.\n\nUSC athletes are ready to shine at the 2024 Olympics\n\nAnticipation increases for\n\nformer and current Trojans\n\nahead of the Paris Games.\n\nUSC baseball will be back\n\nI\n\nt’s not how you start the\n\nseason; it’s how you finish.\n\nEven though USC baseball\n\n(31-28, 17-12 Pac-12) was without\n\nits normal home stadium, started\n\nthe season out 3-11 and lost its\n\nstar pitcher due to injury for\n\nover a month, the Trojans still\n\nmanaged to have a winning\n\nrecord and reach 17 conference\n\nwins. USC has now hit that\n\nconference win total in back-toback seasons for the first time\n\nsince the 2001 and 2002 seasons.\n\nThe Trojans were unable\n\nto earn an at-large bid to the\n\nNCAA Tournament, which was a\n\nforegone conclusion given they\n\nonly finished three games above\n\n.500 and missed out on a bid\n\nlast season despite finishing 11\n\ngames over .500. Even their strong\n\nshowing in the Pac-12 Tournament\n\n— making it to the finals and\n\nlosing on an excruciating walkoff — will not be able to save them\n\nfrom their postseason drought.\n\nThis should not take away\n\nfrom what Head Coach Andy\n\nStankiewicz, in his second year at\n\nthe helm for USC, did for a team that\n\nlost two of its best hitters to Major\n\nLeague Baseball after last season,\n\namid all the other adversities.\n\nA step back from the 2023\n\nseason to the 2024 campaign\n\nmight seem disappointing on\n\npaper, but the Trojans saw major\n\nimprovements in important\n\nareas. The 2023 squad played to a\n\nterrible 6-15-1 mark on the road,\n\nbut USC secured a 12-11 away\n\nrecord this season.\n\nArizona (36-21, 20-10 Pac12) — the winner of the Pac-12\n\nTournament and the No. 18 team in\n\nD1 Baseball’s most recent rankings\n\n— was 13-11 on the road this past\n\nseason, showing nationally ranked\n\nteams don’t have to dominate on\n\nthe road, but rather just stay afloat.\n\nWhere the Trojans failed to\n\nprogress was playing at home, but\n\nthis is understandable given the\n\nteam had three “home parks.” USC\n\nhad a near-unfathomable 26-6\n\nhome record in 2023, but regressed\n\nto the mean in 2024, sporting a 16-\n\n10 mark at home this year.\n\nIf Stankiewicz was able to\n\nturn around USC’s road struggles\n\nin merely a year, he likely can\n\nreturn the Trojans to home\n\ndominance as they get more\n\ncomfortable playing most of their\n\nhome games in Irvine, a rather\n\nuncomfortable travel situation.\n\nAs USC’s skipper enters his third\n\nyear as the Trojan head coach, the\n\nteam is, of course, preparing to\n\nmove to the Big Ten, a conference\n\nwith six national championships —\n\nhalf of what USC has as a team —\n\nand none since 1966.\n\nWhile the Pac-12 is no SEC — a\n\nconference with five of the last six\n\nnational titles — the Conference\n\nof Champions boasts 22 College\n\nWorld Series championships since\n\nthe Big Ten’s last win.\n\nThe Trojans are leaving the\n\nstiff competition of the Pac-12 for\n\na conference of historically worse\n\nteams. This season will likely\n\nleave a sour taste in fans’ mouths\n\nexpecting USC’s first trip to the\n\nNCAA Tournament since 2015,\n\nbut the future is still bright for\n\nthe Trojans under Stankiewicz.\n\nUSC currently has Perfect\n\nGame’s No. 22 high school\n\nrecruiting class in the country,\n\nthe highest ranking of any\n\ncurrent or future Big Ten\n\nschool. Stankiewicz will have\n\nanother offseason under his belt\n\nto develop his No. 22-ranked\n\nrecruiting class from 2023,\n\na group that already saw\n\nsignificant playing time on the\n\ndiamond this past season.\n\nWhere the Trojans will need\n\nto come along heading into next\n\nseason is in the pop department. USC\n\ncompiled a Pac-12-worst 35 home\n\nruns this past season with a major gap\n\nto first place. Comparatively, Oregon\n\nState (42-14, 19-10 Pac-12) slugged a\n\nwhopping 112 round trippers.\n\nThe Trojans desperately need some\n\npower, as Stankiewicz was often\n\nforced to manufacture runs through\n\nsmall ball play this past season. If USC\n\ncan increase its power, the team will\n\nbe set up for success in the Big Ten.\n\nEven though the future seems\n\nbright for the Trojans, there are\n\nstill a lot of “ifs” that need to\n\nbecome reality before USC truly\n\nreturns to the national spotlight.\n\nBut for now, the Trojans are in\n\ngood hands under Stankiewicz.\n\nThomas Johnson is a rising senior\n\nwriting about USC’s move to a new\n\nconference and all of the implications\n\nsurrounding the transition in his\n\ncolumn, “Big Ten Bites.”\n\nThomas\n\nJohnson\n\nBIG TEN BITES\n\nAilura / Wikimedia Commons\n\nFormer Trojan Sara Hughes won back-to-back NCAA titles for USC with\n\nteammate Kelly Cheng. The two will pair up in search of the gold in Paris.\n\nJena Ragon / Wikimedia Commons\n\nMichael Norman holds the USC record for the 200m with a time of 19.84.\n\nHe is now one of the favorites to take home the gold for the 400m in Paris."
