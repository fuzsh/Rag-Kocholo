The Tritons have advanced to the semifinals of the Big West Championship in each of the last three seasons.\n\nKreutzkamp holds an overall record of 290-209 (.581) during his tenure and was named the Association of Collegiate Water Polo Coaches (ACWPC) and WWPA Coach of the Year five times during this stretch.\n\nIn 2024, UC San Diego earned an 18-12 overall record and went 4-3 in the Big West, finishing fourth in the conference. At the Big West Championship, the Tritons defeated CSUN to advance to the semifinal round, where they fell to top-seeded and eventual league champion Hawai‘i.\n\nIn early March, UC San Diego defeated UC Irvine for the first time since 2006.\n\nTo close out the 2024 regular season, UC San Diego beat San Diego State in the 22nd Harper Cup to retain the trophy for the eighth-consecutive year.\n\nThree players garnered All-Big West recognition including Kendall Thomas (First Team), Caroline Christl (Second Team), and Lexi Stahl (Second Team).\n\nIn 2023, the Tritons' fourth season as a member of the Big West, the squad went 14-17 overall and 4-3 in the conference. UC San Diego caught fire late, winning five of its last six games. For the second-straight year, the Tritons were victorious in a Big West Championship game, taking down UC Davis to advance to the conference semifinals. The team was ranked as high as 10th in the country. Caroline Christl, Courtney Okumura, and Kendall Thomas earned All-America Honorable mention from the Association of Collegiate Water Polo Coaches (ACWPC). Sofia Munatones and Sydney Munatones joined that trio in earning Big West postseason recognition.\n\nThe 2022 campaign was highlighted by the team's first-ever Big West postseason victory as the Tritons defeated UC Davis in sudden death overtime in a conference tournament quarterfinal at the University of Hawai‘i. UC San Diego put together a 20-11 overall record and an even 3-3 mark in Big West action, good for third place in the regular season standings. Four Tritons - Bennett Bugelli, Ciara Franke, Taylor Onstott, and Kendall Thomas earned All-America honors from the ACWPC. Annika Arroyo and Courtney Okamura joined that quartet as All-Big West selections.\n\nIn 2021, UC San Diego's first full season in The Big West, the team compiled a 9-8 overall record and went 3-2 in conference action with wins against Hawaii, UC Santa Barbara, and UC Davis. The wins over Hawaii and UC Davis marked the first time the Tritons had beaten the two programs since 2014 and 2013, respectively. To close out the year, UC San Diego finished third at the conference tournament. Franke was named the Big West Player of the Year, the first-ever Triton in any sport to earn that title.\n\nDuring UC San Diego's inaugural season in The Big West in 2020, the Tritons opened up by defeating then number four California for the first time in program history. Kreutzkamp also led the team to a fourth-place showing at the Triton Invitational, its best-ever finish in the tournament. On February 29, the Tritons won their first Big West game in program history, topping CSUN to start 1-0 in conference play.\n\nUC San Diego won its seventh-consecutive WWPA championship and advanced to the NCAA Quarterfinals in 2019. The season was highlighted by an NCAA opening-round victory over Wagner on May 7, a fourth-straight Harper Cup win against San Diego State on April 20, and a home triumph over future conference foe Long Beach State on Feb. 10. The Tritons finished the year ranked No. 14 in the nation.\n\nUC San Diego had one of its most successful seasons in program history in 2018, finishing 24-12 overall with an appearance in the NCAA opening round. The Tritons won the WWPA Championship tourney for the sixth-straight season and seventh time overall, while Kreutzkamp was named WWPA Coach of the Year for the third time in his career. In addition, the Tritons earned 11 victories over ranked opponents.\n\nKreutzkamp earned his milestone 200th career victory in the WWPA tournament championship game on April 29. Earlier in the season, he passed former head coach Larry Sanders' total of 180 wins amassed during his tenure from 2000-09.\n\nThe 2017 season saw UC San Diego post a 19-15 overall record with a 3-0 mark in WWPA play. The Tritons won their fifth-straight conference title and advanced to NCAA postseason play for the sixth time under Kreutzkamp.\n\nThree players were selected to ACWPC All-America teams, including senior Lauren Boyer, who was also tabbed the ACWPC Division II Player of the Year. In addition, Boyer was the WWPA Player of the Year and six other Tritons garnered postseason recognition from the league.\n\nIn 2016, Kreutzkamp led his team to a 28-11 overall record and the Tritons fourth-straight WWPA title with a 9-5 victory over Cal State East Bay. UC San Diego advanced to its fifth NCAA Championship and matched a program-best sixth-place finish. The team recorded 28 wins for the first time since the 1994 national championship squad finished 28-2.\n\nKreutzkamp was named the Division II Co-Coach of the Year by the ACWPC for the fourth time in his career. He led four Tritons to ACWPC All-America honors and saw a program-record eight players make WWPA All-Conference teams.\n\nDuring the 2015 season, Kreutzkamp led his team to its third-straight WWPA title and fourth in five years with a 10-8 victory over Cal State East Bay. The Tritons made their fourth NCAA appearance, finishing eighth at the championship.\n\nIn 2014, Kreutzkamp paced the Tritons to a 27-13 overall record, which was the second most wins in the program's 30-year history. UC San Diego earned its third WWPA title in four years after downing Cal State East Bay, 16-3. The Tritons went on to finish in eighth place at the NCAA Championship.\n\nThe Tritons picked up eight wins against nationally-ranked NCAA Division I programs in addition to being featured in the CWPA's top-20 national poll all 17 weeks, beginning at No. 14 and finishing at No. 12. The Tritons reached as high as sixth in the poll, which marked their highest ever ranking under Kreutzkamp.\n\nKreutzkamp was named the ACWPC Division II Coach of the Year for the third time. The Tritons placed four players on ACWPC All-America teams, the most of any NCAA Division II institution. UC San Diego had seven players make All-WWPA teams, a program record for Kreutzkamp.\n\nIn his fourth season in 2013, Kreutzkamp led UC San Diego to an NCAA Championship berth after knocking off Loyola Marymount, 10-8, in the WWPA title game. The 12th-ranked Tritons finished a program-best sixth place at the NCAA Championship and closed the season with a 26-15 overall mark, recording their most wins since the 1994 national championship squad went 28-2.\n\nThe schedule featured 21 games against nationally-ranked NCAA Division I programs. The Tritons finished with an 8-13 record. UC San Diego was featured in the CWPA Top-20 national poll all 16 weeks, beginning at No. 20 and finishing as No. 12 in the final poll.\n\nKreutzkamp was honored as the Division II Coach of the Year by the ACWPC and was also named WWPA Coach of the Year. The Tritons boasted four players on ACWPC All-America teams, six on All-WWPA teams, eight on the WWPA All-Academic team, and four on the ACWPC All-Academic team.\n\nIn 2012, Kreutzkamp and the Tritons went 21-14 overall and narrowly missed their second-straight trip to the NCAA Championship. The Tritons were 8-2 in WWPA play and earned the No. 2 seed for the conference championship, but fell by a single goal to Loyola Marymount in the title game. UC San Diego won 10 of its final 13 contests.\n\nKreutzkamp guided the 2011 Tritons to an 18-20 overall record and led the Tritons to their first WWPA title since 2000 and the school's first appearance at the NCAA Championship in program history. UC San Diego defeated No. 8 LMU, 13-11, to earn its first conference title in more than 10 years. The Tritons went 1-2 at the NCAA Champion­ship in Ann Arbor, Mich., taking down No. 20 Iona, 15-9, in the seventh-place match.\n\nIn 2010, Kreutzkamp led the Tritons to an 18-19 overall record during his first season as head coach. UC San Diego finished fourth in the conference after posting a 10-3 mark in WWPA competition. The team advanced to its first WWPA championship match since 2004 after beating Sonoma State and Colorado State in the first two rounds of the conference tournament. However, the squad fell to No. 8 Loyola Marymount, 13-10, in the championship. Four players earned All-WWPA accolades, while two Tritons were named All-Americans.\n\nKreutzkamp was named the head coach of the women's water polo team in September of 2009. He came to UC San Diego as an assistant with the women's team in 1999, before joining longtime head coach Denny Harper on the men's staff the following season. He served as an assistant under Harper until 2006, when he was promoted to associate head coach, a position he held until 2010.\n\nThe Triton men went 194-106 (.646) during Kreutzkamp's time, winning WWPA championships in 2000, 2002, and 2006. In his first year with the program, Kreutzkamp helped guide UC San Diego to a 9-8 victory over USC in the NCAA semifinals as the Tritons became the first non-Division I program to play for a national championship.\n\nPrior to his arrival on the La Jolla campus, Kreutzkamp was the head coach of both the boy's and girl's varsity programs at Grossmont High School from 1996-99. He held both positions at Patrick Henry High School for two seasons prior to that. While at Patrick Henry, he led the girl's squad to the inaugural San Diego CIF Division I championship in 1995 and was named both the Girl's Eastern League and CIF D-I Coach of the Year. He also served as the head girl's coach with the highly-successful Sunset Water Polo Club, winning a pair of silver med­als at the 18-U Junior Olympics."
