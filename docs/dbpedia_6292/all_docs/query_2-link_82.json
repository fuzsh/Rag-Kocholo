        "text": "When I discuss “domestic partnerships”, it has nothing to do with the political climate we find ourselves in these days. I’m referring to the domestic partnerships on the intermodal transportation landscape. I have been in this industry for a long time and I have seen so many changes, some good and some not so good. The past 12 years were spent on the drayage side and that’s one of the reasons so much of my commentary reverts to our drayage brothers and sisters. That got me thinking about “partnerships” and how we all sort of just throw that term around when we want something. There are several definitions of partnership, but I found this one to be the most compelling and spot on when we talk about partnerships between shippers/receivers and intermodal transportation providers:\n\nA partnership is a relationship between individuals or groups that is characterized by mutual cooperation and responsibility, as for the achievement of a specified goal.\n\nYou may be asking yourselves, “Okay Castagno…so where in the heck are you going with this?” Well, here goes. I have commented recently about the capacity issues that we face in the transportation and distribution business – you all know it, and you’re all probably experiencing it to some degree. What this means is that there will be fewer assets to fill our ever-growing need and challenge for the efficient and uninterrupted movement of our goods and products. What I have seen and experienced in this business, at least for the most part when it comes to “partnerships”, is that the term is bandied about hither, thither and yonder and that’s about the extent of it. And while the intention to partnership has almost always been there, the reality is that for the most part, it just doesn’t happen. As my Pop used to say, “The road to heck is paved with good intentions.”\n\nReally, this is just something I have thought about for a long time, especially when (in a previous life of course) one of our clients would decide to partner up with a new partner for various and in sundry reasons. I now realize that was the old reality of the way we did business and something we had to live with; right, wrong or indifferent. However, now we are approaching the dawn of a new reality, one in which we are being challenged from a capacity perspective on both the over the road service as well as the intermodal mode. The common thread is qualified truck drivers and owner operators, and we most definitely need them to keep America moving. New reality: what can we do to help protect ourselves, our customers our service providers and our partners? First of all, embrace the concept of a true partnership with your good service providers and hold onto them like there’s no tomorrow. As assets and capacity in our business become strained, it will be extremely important for shippers and receivers to make certain that they can get their products to market with little or no interruption, and that means having a mutually cooperative and responsible relationship with your transportation provider.\n\nI know that rates will always play a role in who we do business with, but let’s not lose sight of what other attributes should become a major part of the mix. As your business grows, you will need more capacity and will need to work with partners that can and will grow with you as your business increases. Please don’t let rates be the ultimate basis for your transportation decisions. In my “intermodal world”, a true partner in every sense of the word should work with you and provide:\n\nRespect, honesty, confidence, professionalism, and integrity as to how they conduct their business.\n\nAn up to date Transportation and Operating system.\n\nA company that has the ability to grow as you grow – this will help ensure that you always have capacity.\n\nA provider with world class customer service.\n\nThey should be financially secure and stable.\n\nThey should be solutions oriented and great communicators.\n\nAnd, they should always have your best interests at heart!\n\nOh, and I almost forgot – a competitive and marketable pricing format.\n\nTo wrap this up – in my little corner of “transportation heaven”, I would answer in the affirmative – YES, it is the right time for domestic partnerships (and we don’t even need SCOTUS to figure this one out)."
