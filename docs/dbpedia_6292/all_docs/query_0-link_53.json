His explanatory letter from November 4 reached Rous too late to have any influence on the negative decision (by the Rockefeller Foundation and the American Red Cross) in this matter. Contrary to Weindling's affirmation Mooser was neither in Warsaw in 1941, nor was he a member of the Swiss Sanitary Missions to the eastern front.\n\nSport and Other Motor Activities of Warsaw Students\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nBiernat, Elzbieta\n\n2011-01-01\n\nStudy aim: To assess the engagement of students of Warsaw university schools in sports and in recreational motor activities.

Methods of collection include espionage, overt collection, acquisition by scientific and educational exchange participants, and illegal trade activities. Examples of methods used by the Warsaw Pact countries (except the USSR) are provided. The US faces barriers to preventing loss of its technologies. Among these are resistance from US business interests, insufficient cooperation between US government agencies and overseas allies, lack of US counterintelligence personnel, and the openess of American society.

The diagnosis requires careful observation of the individual's course of growth and metabolic condition. Various criteria are used to diagnose hypotrophy; 3rd, 5th or 10th percentile body mass are the most common, although others recommend using a value of -2.0 SDS body mass and length. To define the frequency of body mass and length deficiency in newborns in the Warsaw population. 4096 children born in single deliveries in 2009 at one Warsaw hospital. Body dimensions at birth were compared against the following standards, taking gestation period and sex into consideration: 1. Usher and McLean (UML). 2. A standard generally used in Warsaw maternity wards, drawn up by the Mother and Baby Institute (IMiD). 3. A standard drawn up in Wielkopolska (WLKP). Hypotrophy was diagnosed retrospectively on the basis of -2.0 SDS body mass and/or body length and 10th percentile body mass criterion. Regardless of sex and the standard being applied, at least one of the analysed body dimensions fell at or below -2.0 SDS in approximately 1% of all children. In newborn boys hypotrophy was diagnosed significantly less frequently using the UML standard than using the national ones, while in newborn girls it was diagnosed less frequently using the IMiD standard than UML or WLKP. Birth mass below the 10th percentile was found in approximately 7% and in just over 3% of all newborns using the IMiD and WLKP standards respectively. The absence of national standards for body length at birth makes the -2.0 SDS criterion difficult to use, while basing the diagnosis purely on evaluating body mass results in too few diagnoses of hypotrophy. Using the 10th percentile criterion allows for diagnosing hypotrophy in a few percent of newborns, while the Warsaw and Wielkopolska standards result in more diagnoses. Taking population trends into account, we postulate the need to prepare new national standards of body dimensions of\n\nCourage under Adversity: Luba Bielicka-Blum (1906-1973) and the Nursing School of the Warsaw Ghetto.\n\nPubMed\n\nBen-Sefer, Ellen; Shields, Linda\n\n2016-01-01\n\nThe Warsaw Ghetto was a place where Jews were kept until deportation to Nazi death camps. It contained a nursing school, run by Luba Bielicka-Blum. We explore the contribution of Luba Bielicka-Blum to nursing and specifically, the nursing school of the Warsaw Ghetto by using primary sources of Bielicka-Blum's daughter's archive held by Yad Veshem, supported by secondary sources. We conclude that, despite extreme hardship and abject horror, the nursing school in the Warsaw Ghetto continued to provide the highest level of nursing education possible. The relatively unknown story of Luba Bielicka-Blum and her determination to continue the education of nurses in the Warsaw Ghetto demonstrates the courage of a nursing leader during dreadful times.\n\nThe Warsaw Pact Baltic Fleet.\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n1984-09-01\n\nSome analysts have concluded that the Warsaw Pact already controls the Baltic Sea.

Exploration for hydrocarbons in this zone, however, was limited until recently due to a lack of a suitable explanation for reservoir development in this interval. The theory that Waulsortian mound development may explain many of these reservoirs was first presented in 1990. Research effort led by Zakaria Lasemi at the Illinois State Geological Survey has since established an excellent model for the generation of these bioherms. Lasemi performed numerous examinations of outcrops, cores, and well cuttings to develop his theory on themoreÂ Â» development and evolution of these biohermal features. This article presents an application of Lasemi`s model to an oil field in the Illinois basin. Similar applications could improve exploration and development success in Warsaw reservoirs.Â«Â less\n\nSpatial Distribution and Conservation of Speckled Hind and Warsaw Grouper in the Atlantic Ocean off the Southeastern U.S.\n\nPubMed Central\n\nFarmer, Nicholas A.; Karnauskas, Mandy\n\n2013-01-01\n\nThere is broad interest in the development of efficient marine protected areas (MPAs) to reduce bycatch and end overfishing of speckled hind (Epinephelus drummondhayi) and warsaw grouper (Hyporthodus nigritus) in the Atlantic Ocean off the southeastern U.S. We assimilated decades of data from many fishery-dependent, fishery-independent, and anecdotal sources to describe the spatial distribution of these data limited stocks. A spatial classification model was developed to categorize depth-grids based on the distribution of speckled hind and warsaw grouper point observations and identified benthic habitats. Logistic regression analysis was used to develop a quantitative model to predict the spatial distribution of speckled hind and warsaw grouper as a function of depth, latitude, and habitat. Models, controlling for sampling gear effects, were selected based on AIC and 10-fold cross validation. The best-fitting model for warsaw grouper included latitude and depth to explain 10.8% of the variability in probability of detection, with a false prediction rate of 28â33%. The best-fitting model for speckled hind, per cross-validation, included latitude and depth to explain 36.8% of the variability in probability of detection, with a false prediction rate of 25â27%. The best-fitting speckled hind model, per AIC, also included habitat, but had false prediction rates up to 36%. Speckled hind and warsaw grouper habitats followed a shelf-edge hardbottom ridge from North Carolina to southeast Florida, with speckled hind more common to the north and warsaw grouper more common to the south. The proportion of habitat classifications and model-estimated stock contained within established and proposed MPAs was computed. Existing MPAs covered 10% of probable shelf-edge habitats for speckled hind and warsaw grouper, protecting 3â8% of speckled hind and 8% of warsaw grouper stocks. Proposed MPAs could add 24% more probable shelf-edge habitat, and protect an additional 14â29% of\n\nThe Warsaw Ghetto: A Shattered Window on the Holocaust.\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nBurstin, Barbara Stern\n\n1980-01-01\n\nReviews literature about the Warsaw ghetto uprising in April, 1943, in which Jewish resistance fighters fought to the last against the Nazi war machine.

During the partition of Poland, the Imperial (Russian) Warsaw University conducted research on avian embryology (and to a smaller extent, on reptilian embryology). When Poland regained independence in 1918, these studies were continued under the Chair of Comparative Anatomy headed by Professor Jan Tur. A new Department of Embryology created in 1954 was first headed by Professor Stanislaw Bilewicz and since 1964 by Professor Andrzej Tarkowski, who in 2003 was succeeded by Dr. Marek Maleszewski D.Sc. During the last 45 years, embryological research at Warsaw University has concentrated mainly on mammalian development with special emphasis on the regulative capabilities of early embryos and also on experimental chimaeras, nucleo-cytoplasmic interactions in oogenesis and early embryogenesis (including regulation of DNA replication and transcription), experimental parthenogenesis and fertilization.\n\nNATO-Warsaw Pact.

The intake ofselected trace elements was estimated on the basis of three-day dietary records. Microelement contents in the diet were calculated using Food Composition Tables. The percentage of the RDA realization for the safe level was calculated on the basis of standards for Polish population, developed by National Food and Nutrition Institute. It was demonstrated that adolescents living in Warsaw had 50-60% copper-deficient diets. The content of iron and zinc in the diet of adolescents was about 10-40% lower than recommended. Deficiency of iron in the body causes anaemia and influences learning process, therefore the content of this element in the diet of young people is especially important.\n\nThe fate of the Warsaw Ghetto Medical Faculty.\n\nPubMed\n\nWeisz, George M; Grzybowski, Andrzej; Albury, William Randall\n\n2012-04-01\n\nThe Warsaw Ghetto, in existence from 1940 to 1943, was the largest ghetto in Nazi-occupied Europe. The 400,000-500,000 Jews incarcerated within its walls were deprived not only of food and medicine but also of education. Nonetheless, Jewish physicians served the community as befits their profession, and against all odds obtained permission to conduct a course on sanitary measures to combat epidemics, which they transformed into a veritable, clandestine medical school. This review follows the fate of the school faculty, with an emphasis on the achievements of the survivors.\n\nEthanol-induced conditioned taste aversion in Warsaw Alcohol High-Preferring (WHP) and Warsaw Alcohol Low-Preferring (WLP) rats.\n\nPubMed\n\nDyr, Wanda; Wyszogrodzka, Edyta; Paterak, Justyna; SiwiÅska-ZiÃ³Åkowska, Agnieszka; MaÅkowska, Anna; Polak, Piotr\n\n2016-03-01\n\nThe aversive action of the pharmacological properties of ethanol was studied in selectively bred Warsaw Alcohol High-Preferring (WHP) and Warsaw Alcohol Low-Preferring (WLP) rats. For this study, a conditioned-taste aversion test was used. Male WHP and WLP rats were submitted to daily 20-min sessions for 5 days, in which a saccharin solution (1.0Â g/L) was available (pre-conditioning phase). Next, this drinking was paired with the injection of ethanol (0, 0.5, 1.0Â g/kg), intraperitoneally [i.p.] immediately after removal of the saccharin bottle (conditioning phase). Afterward, the choice between the saccharin solution and water was extended for 18 subsequent days for 20-min daily sessions (post-conditioning phase). Both doses of ethanol did not produce an aversion to saccharin in WLP and WHP rats in the conditioning phase. However, injection of the 1.0Â g/kg dose of ethanol produced an aversion in WLP rats that was detected by a decrease in saccharin intake at days 1, 3, 7, and 10 of the post-conditioning phase, with a decrease in saccharin preference for 16 days of the post-conditioning phase. Conditioned taste aversion, measured as a decrease in saccharin intake and saccharin preference, was only visible in WHP rats at day 1 and day 3 of the post-conditioning phase. This difference between WLP and WHP rats was apparent despite similar blood ethanol levels in both rat lines following injection of 0.5 and 1.0Â g/kg of ethanol. These results may suggest differing levels of aversion to the post-ingestional effects of ethanol between WLP and WHP rats. These differing levels of aversion may contribute to the selected line difference in ethanol preference in WHP and WLP rats. Copyright Â© 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Etiological factors include gastrointestinal peristalsis disturbances, visceral hypersensitivity, chronic inflammation of the mucous membrane, dysbacteremia, intestinal infections, psychosomatic and nutritional factors. Gastrointestinal motility disturbances in case of IBS are manifested by the inhibition of the intestinal passage, which favors the development of constipation or occurrence of diarrhea. The aim of the study was to evaluate IBS symptoms and demonstrate the relationship between physical activity and place of residence amongst Warsaw University students. The study was conducted in march, 2014 using a specific questionnaire, amongst Warsaw University students. The study group comprised 120 female patients, aged between 19 and 27 years (M=23.43; SD=1.29). The chi-square test was used for analysis, p<0.05 was considered as statistically significant. The BMI of investigated patients ranged between 16.30-31.22 kg/m2 (M=21.27; SD=2.71). The majority of respondents (76.6%) weighed within the normal limits. Abdominal pain or discomfort occurred more frequently in the group of students who considered their physical activity as low. In case of respondents with a low physical activity bowel movement disorders and stool continence changes occurred more often, as compared to those with moderate physical activity. The most common symptom was rectal tenesmus, the least common-presence of mucous in the stool. Analysis showed that students with low physical activity were more frequently absent from school/work, due to abdominal symptoms. The respondents with moderate activity more often considered their abdominal symptoms, being associated with stress. IBS symptoms are common amongst Warsaw University students. In case of respondents with low physical activity, abdominal pain or discomfort occurred\n\n[Activity of sanitary surveillances/offices in Warsaw at the time of the second republic of Poland].\n\nPubMed\n\nBerner, WÅodzimierz\n\n2006-01-01\n\nAt the time of the Second Republic of Poland, Warsaw, the capital of the rebirth country, was a neglected town as regards sanitary conditions. The genesis of this situation dates back to the period of the national bondage by the Russian partitioner, and since 1915 by the German invader who did not care about the problems associated with public health. The sanitary and hygienic conditions worsened significantly in 1916, after incorporating into Warsaw large out-of-town regions whose housing was of the rural character with numerous wooden cottages, field roads, without any sanitary sewage system. Poor municipal sanitary-maintenance conditions and infectious diseases spreading in Warsaw made the Town Authorities implement preventive action and entrust sanitary surveillances with this difficult task. These surveillances were set up at the time of the First World War, and after 1920 were changed into sanitary offices. Their duties included control of acute infectious diseases, sanitary inspection of living quarters, sites of production and selling of food articles, plants, service outlets, shops of a different character, as well as surveillance of food purchased by the inhabitants. In each sanitary office a doctor was employed who supervised the work of one, two or three sanitary inspectors.\n\nBeyond the Warsaw Pact: Russian Foreign Policy in East Central Europe\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n1992-06-01\n\nWestern Overview.\" Problems of Communism 37 (May/August 1988): 56-60. 134 Brzezinski , Zbigniew. \"East-West Relations and Eastern Europe...A Special...Bonn Press EC Superpower Role.\" Times (London), 17 October 1991, 10.

During the study the highest contamination was near the Warszawa Steel Mill, northwestern Warsaw. Lead concentrations in moss bags decreased in time, while those of Cd and Zn did not show clear trends. Between 1994 and 2004, Pb, Cd, and Zn were also monitored in the Crimean linden (Tilia Euchlora) foliage along the main city avenue and in a northwestern warsaw park. Lead concentrations decreased more near the avenue than in the park, indicating that the phasing-out of leaded gasoline had a major effect on reduced Pb contamination in Warsaw. At the same time, foliar concentrations of Cd and Zn in both areas decreased much less.\n\nThe use of the Hurst exponent to predict changes in trends on the Warsaw Stock Exchange\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nDomino, Krzysztof\n\n2011-01-01\n\nThe local properties of the time series of the evolution of share prices of 126 significant companies traded on the Warsaw Stock Exchange during the period between 1991-2008 have been investigated. The analysis was applied to daily financial returns. I have used the local DFA to obtain the Hurst exponent (diffusion coefficient) while searching for negative correlations by which changes of long-term trends would be effected. A certain evidence, proving that after the signature of anti-correlation-the drop in the Hurst exponent-the change in the trend and in the return rate of an investment is probable, was pointed out. Hence after further investigation this method may be useful as a part of an investment strategy. As the Warsaw Stock Exchange is relatively smaller and younger than other significant world Stock Exchanges-and as the developing market is less efficient-the generalization for others markets needs further investigation.\n\nThe nutritional habits among centenarians living in Warsaw.\n\nPubMed\n\nKoÅÅajtis-DoÅowy, Anna; Pietruszka, Barbara; KaÅuza, Joanna; PawliÅiska-Chmara, Romana; Broczek, Katarzyna; Mossakowska, MaÅgorzata\n\n2007-01-01\n\nThe aim of the study was to determine the preferences and nutritional habits of Warsaw centenarians during their \"third period\" of life. The study was conducted by a questionnaire method among 29 centenarians. Most of centenarians had general good health condition. Almost 60% of centenarians performed manual labor in the past. Then they drank small amounts of alcohol irregularly. Several percent of centenarians smoked in the past. Before the age of sixty less people then at present snacked between meals. Sweets both now and in the past were preferred products, however, in the past sweets were rarely eaten by centenarians. At the present time centenarians ate more often yogurt, skim curd, fish, lean meat products, plant oils and sweets. The changes in eating habits were probably caused by civilization changes.\n\nThe Bear and the Foxes Understanding Soviet Policy in the Warsaw Pact.\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n1981-06-01\n\nview was challenged by some Western critics, and labeled as a \"lost opportunity\", there is every reason to believe that Stalin was seeking a tactical...fraternal friendship between free and equal Nations.\" (171, C.

Kazimierz Twardowski (1866-1938), founder of the school, developed a philosophical and psychological program on the basis of (among other things) the theory of actions and products, including the research program that is now included in the thread of historical psychology. His student, Wladyslaw Witwicki (1878-1948), developed the cratism theory (the theory of power) on the basis Twardowski's assumptions, providing an alternative to Alfred Adler's theory of striving for superiority while also declaring it a few years before Adler. The consequence of Witwicki's theory and the methodological assumptions was the creation of psychobiography: the first nonpsychoanalytical psychobiography of Socrates (Witwicki, 1909, 1922) and the psychobiography of Jesus Christ (Witwicki, 1958). The school's activities weakened for political reasons, particularly the outbreak of the First World War. The members of the school dispersed after 1918, and they lost international connections with the world of science. Their significant achievements in the field of psychology remained unknown to psychologists for nearly a century. In this article, I would like to present the school's unique but unfinished program of reconstructing mental life through the psychological interpretation of cultural products (literature, arts, diaries), and its value for the practice of research in historical psychology. This program required additional development, but because of the war this never happened. Some of the school's theoretical findings and the first attempts to apply them have still significant value and show us the originality of Lvov-Warsaw School psychology.

Guided by resiliency theory, we examine if developmental risk and promotive factors are associated with substance abuse risk. Objectives We examined the association between adolescent cigarette and alcohol use and related risk and promotive factors including maternal support, neighboursâ informal social control, friendsâ acceptance of substance use, and alcohol and cigarette use by nonparental adults. Method Data were collected from a random sample of 13â14-year old students attending Warsaw middle schools (N=3029). We used hierarchical regression models and examined compensatory and protective models of resilience, controlling for sociodemograhic factors. Results Our results indicated that friendsâ acceptance of substance use and perceived drug use among nonparental adults was associated with increased risk cigarette and alcohol use among youth. We found that maternal support moderated the relationship between friendsâ acceptance of substance use and cigarette use (protective model of resilience). Thus, maternal support buffered the negative effects of friendsâ acceptance of use on youthsâ cigarette use. Neighborâs informal social control and maternal support were associated with reduced risk of alcohol use (compensatory model of resilience). Conclusion Collectively, results of the study support compensatory and protective models of resilience in a large representative sample of Warsaw adolescents.

Many Polish students were attending in Paris natural history, botany, zoology, chemistry and mineralogy courses. The Warsaw Society of Friends of Learning was the largest scientific society and one of the most important scientific institutions in Poland. It had also an impact on the political and cultural life of the country, occupied and deprived of freedom at that time. Amongst its founders and members, could be found listeners to the lectures of Lamarck, HaÃ¼y, Vauquelin, Desfontaines, Jussieu. Moreover, seven professors of the National Museum of Natural History were elected foreign members of the Warsaw Society of Friends of Learning: Cuvier, Desfontaines, HaÃ¼y, Jussieu, Latreille, Mirbel, Vauquelin. The article analyses this choice and underlines the relationship between these scientists and Warsaw's scientists. The results of this research allow to confirm that the National Museum of Natural History was the most important foreign institution in the 19th century for Polish science, and more specifically natural sciences.\n\nEffects of urban agglomeration on surface-UV doses: a comparison of Brewer measurements in Warsaw and Belsk, Poland, for the period 2013-2015\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nCzerwiÅska, Agnieszka E.; KrzyÅcin, Janusz W.; JarosÅawski, Janusz; Posyniak, MichaÅ\n\n2016-11-01\n\nSpecific aerosols and cloud properties over large urban regions seem to generate an island, similar to the well-known urban heat island, leading to lower ultraviolet (UV) radiation intensity compared to the surrounding less polluted areas, thus creating a shield against excessive human exposure to UV radiation. The present study focuses on differences between erythemal and UVA (324 nm) doses measured by the Brewer spectrophotometers in Warsaw (52.3Â° N, 21.0Â° E) and Belsk (51.8Â° N, 20.8Â° E). The latter is a rural region located about 60 km south-west of the city. Ratios between erythemal and UVA partly daily doses, obtained during all-sky and cloudless-sky conditions for the period May 2013-December 2015, were analysed to infer a specific cloud and aerosol forcing on the surface UV doses over Warsaw. Radiative model simulations were carried out to find sources of the observed differences between the sites. It was found that Warsaw urban agglomeration induced 8 and 6 % attenuation of the erythemal and UVA doses respectively. This is mostly due to the lower sun elevation in Warsaw during the near-noon measurements and the larger optical depth of the city aerosols and increased cloudiness. It could be hypothesised that the expected stronger absorption of the solar UV radiation by urban aerosols is compensated for here by a higher surface reflectivity over the city.\n\nFlood Frequency Analysis using different flood descriptors - the Warsaw reach of the river Vistula case study\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKaramuz, Emilia; Kochanek, Krzysztof; Romanowicz, Renata\n\n2014-05-01\n\nFlood frequency analysis (FFA) is customarily performed using annual maximum flows. However, there is a number of different flood descriptors that could be used. Among them are water levels, peaks over the threshold, flood-wave duration, flood volume, etc. In this study we compare different approaches to FFA for their suitability for flood risk assessment. The main goal is to obtain the FFA curve with the smallest possible uncertainty limits, in particular for the distribution tail. The extrapolation of FFA curves is crucial in future flood risk assessment in a changing climate. We compare the FFA curves together with their uncertainty limits obtained using flows, water levels, flood inundation area and volumes for the Warsaw reach of the river Vistula. Moreover, we derive the FFA curves obtained using simulated flows. The results are used to derive the error distribution for the maximum simulated and observed values under different modelling techniques and assess its influence on flood risk predictions for ungauged catchments. MIKE11, HEC-RAS and transfer function model are applied in average and extreme conditions to model flow propagation in the Warsaw Vistula reach. The additional questions we want to answer are what is the range of application of different modelling tools under various flow conditions and how can the uncertainty of flood risk assessment be decreased. This work was partly supported by the projects \"Stochastic flood forecasting system (The River Vistula reach from Zawichost to Warsaw)\" and \"Modern statistical models for analysis of flood frequency and features of flood waves\", carried by the Institute of Geophysics, Polish Academy of Sciences on the order of the National Science Centre (contracts Nos. 2011/01/B/ST10/06866 and 2012/05/B/ST10/00482, respectively). The water level and flow data were provided by the Institute of Meteorology and Water Management (IMGW), Poland.\n\nTemporal variations in optical and microphysical properties of mineral dust and biomass burning aerosol derived from daytime Raman lidar observations over Warsaw, Poland\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nJanicka, Lucja; Stachlewska, Iwona S.; Veselovskii, Igor; Baars, Holger\n\n2017-11-01\n\nIn July 2013, favorable weather conditions caused a severe events of advection of biomass burning particles of Canadian forest fires to Europe. The smoke layers were widely observed, especially in Western Europe. An unusual atmospheric aerosol composition was measured at the EARLINET site in Warsaw, Central Poland, during a short event that occurred between 11 and 21 UTC on 10th July 2013. Additionally to the smoke layer, mineral dust was detected in a separate layer. The long-range dust transport pathway followed an uncommon way; originating in Western Sahara, passing above middle Atlantic, and circulating over British Islands, prior to its arrival to Poland. An effective radius of 560 nm was obtained for Saharan dust over Warsaw. This relatively small effective radius is likely due to the long time of the transport. The aerosol-polarization-Raman PollyXT-UW lidar was used for a successful daytime Raman retrieval of the aerosol optical properties at selected times during this short event. The aerosol vertical structure during the inflow over Warsaw in terms of optical properties and depolarization was analyzed, indicating clear distinction of the layers. The microphysical properties were inverted from the lidar derived optical data for selected ranges as representing the smoke and the mineral dust. For smoke, the effective radius was in the range of 0.29-0.36 Î¼m and the complex refractive index 1.36 + 0.008i, on average. For dust, the values of 0.33-0.56 Î¼m and 1.56 + 0.004i were obtained. An evolution of the aerosol composition over Warsaw during the day was analyzed.\n\nImpact of urban environmental pollution on growth, leaf damage, and chemical constituents of Warsaw urban trees\n\nTreesearch\n\nWaldemar Chmielewski; Wojciech Dmuchowski; Stanislaw Suplat\n\n1998-01-01\n\nIn the last 10 years, 3.5 percent of the tree population died annually in PolandÃÂs largest and most polluted cities, which is a problem of economic importance.

The central region is unique and compatible with the two above-mentioned harmonic modes of operation. Only one spiral type inflector will be used. The electric field distribution in the inflector and in the four acceleration gaps has been numerically calculated from an electric potential map produced by the program RELAX3D. The geometry of the central region has been tested with the computations of orbits carried out by means of the computer code CYCLONE. The optical properties of the spiral inflector and the central region were studied by using the programs CASINO and CYCLONE, respectively.\n\nPain associated with the musculoskeletal system in children from Warsaw schools.\n\nPubMed\n\nSÅowiÅska, Iwona; Kwiatkowska, MaÅgorzata; Jednacz, Ewa; MaÅczak, MaÅgorzata; Rutkowska-Sak, Lidia; Raciborski, Filip\n\n2015-01-01\n\nTo assess the prevalence of pain in the musculoskeletal system and possible reasons for these complaints among early age children from Warsaw schools. The study was conducted in 34 randomly selected primary schools in Warsaw in 2011. 2748 survey-questionnaires were given to parents or legal guardians by children. Of these, 1509 surveys were subject to a final analysis. The survey included 66 questions regarding, among other things, pain in the musculoskeletal system in children. Additionally, there were questions about possibly occurring diseases, any postural defects, significant obesity, as well as effects of these complaints on the child's physical activity. Survey data regarded 6-7-year-old children. In the group of 1509 respondents, 242 children (16%) complained about pain in the musculoskeletal system. Pain was located most frequently in the knee joints, and more rarely in the spine and joints in the upper extremities. In the group of children who complained about pain, moderate physical activity was statistically significantly limited. According to parents, physicians did not diagnose any medical conditions in 106 children. Joint disease was diagnosed in 33 children. Postural defects were diagnosed in 589 children. In 123 children complaining about pain at least one postural defect was diagnosed. Such defects were diagnosed statistically significantly more rarely (p = 0.011) in 1234 children who did not complain about pain (460 children). Platypodia or other foot deformation was observed in 25% of these children, spinal curvature in 12%, abnormal knee joint position in 11% and uneven hip position in 2% children. Of note, 17% of all children were significantly overweight. In overweight children the prevalence of pain, especially in the knee joints and feet, was significantly higher. This study aims to underline the problem of musculoskeletal pain in early-age children which limits their physical activity. Also the authors draw attention to the issue of\n\n75 FR 59690 - Endangered and Threatened Wildlife; Notice of 90-Day Finding on a Petition To List Warsaw Grouper...\n\nFederal Register 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014\n\n2010-09-28\n\n...

Professors Joanna Pijanowska, Edward SiÅski and Maria Doligalska were the hosts of the meeting at the Warsaw University. Four lectures were given during the conference. Professor Leszek KuÅºnicki presented professor Janicki's life and followers who continued his research. Professor StanisÅaw Kazubski reminded the main topics of the parasitological studies conducted by professor Janicki. That lecture was illustrated by coloured diagrams taken from original papers published by Janicki. In the next lecture, professor Teresa PojmaÅska reminded \"the theory of the cercomer\". She viewed some polemics and discussions made by the opponents of the theory. Professor Alicja Guttowa presented a paper on the history of the exploration of the D. latum life cycle and the main scientific researches carried out on each life stages of the broad tapeworm. Afterwards the lectures, professor Kazubski showed several pictures taken inside and outside of the Main School of the Warsaw University at the time when professor Janicki had been working there. The professor's students were also seen in these pictures. Next, associate professor Bozena Moskwa, the President of the Polish Parasitological Society presented the Konstanty Janicki Medal, awarded for outstanding activities for the benefit of parasitology. Up to data, 17 scientists and one school: the Warsaw Uniwersity was honored with this Medal. After the conference, participants visited the Powazki Cementary, where the renovated sepulchral monument of professor Konstanty Janicki was uncovered.\n\nDosimetry in radiobiological studies with the heavy ion beam of the Warsaw cyclotron\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKaÅºmierczak, U.; BanaÅ, D.; Braziewicz, J.; Czub, J.; JaskÃ³Åa, M.; Korman, A.; Kruszewski, M.; Lankoff, A.; Lisowska, H.; Malinowska, A.; StÄpkowski, T.; SzefliÅski, Z.; WojewÃ³dzka, M.\n\n2015-12-01\n\nThe aim of this study was to verify various dosimetry methods in the irradiation of biological materials with a 12C ion beam at the Heavy Ion Laboratory of the University of Warsaw.

This contributes to increased consumption of added nutrients, which can be an effective tool for improving public health. To identify and characterise products fortified with vitamins, available on the Warsaw foodstuff market, which can thereby be used as a source of information for the assessment of dietary micronutrient intake. Data were gathered using the information provided on labels from foodstuff products found in 14 Warsaw supermarkets during March to October 2012. There were 588 products found to be fortified with vitamins. The number of vitamins added ranged from one in 193 products to twelve in 14 products. The group of vitamins used for enrichment consisted of: A, D, E, B1, B2, B6, B12, C, niacin, pantothenic acid, folic acid and biotin. Juices, non-alcoholic beverages (29.4%) and cereal products (18.9%) constituted the largest product groups. In addition, fortified vitamins were also significantly present in sweets (15.8%), instant beverages and desserts (13.6%), milk products, fat spreads and soy products. The most frequently added vitamins were: vitamin C (58% products), vitamin B6 (46%) and B12 (45%), whilst the least frequently added was biotin (16%). The highest content of vitamins A and D were seen in fat spreads, whereas the highest levels of B vitamins, vitamin C and E were observed in certain sweets. The wide range of fortified products available can serve to increase vitamin intake in many population groups, especially in children and teenagers. In order that consumers can make informed choices in buying these product types, appropriate education is necessary to raise public awareness of the health issues involved.\n\nShort Communications Prepared for the Second Congress of the International Association for the Scientific Study of Mental Deficiency (Warsaw, 1970).\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nAcademy of Pedagogical Sciences of the USSR, Moscow.

To assess the effects of alcohol consumption on mortality due to cardiovascular diseases (CV) in the population of the Eastern part of Warsaw. The study group consisted of representative, independent and randomly selected samples of the populations of two Warsaw districts (Praga PÃ³Ånoc and Praga PoÅudnie), aged between 35 and 64 years. The studied subjects were examined in 1984 (2570 subjects), in 1988 (1397 subjects) and in 1993 (1485 subjects). Their survival rates were followed up until 1998. The annual beer, wine and vodka intake was assessed using a standardised questionnaire and calculated for a daily pure ethanol intake. The studied subjects were divided into four groups: abstinents and three groups according to the tertile distribution of the alcohol intake (mean alcohol intake in the first tertile: males 1.1 g/day, females 0.2 g/day, in the second tertile: 3.9 and 0.4 g/day, respectively, and in the third tertile: 28.2 and 2.8 g/day, respectively). The relative risk of death in the analysed groups was assessed using the proportional hazard Cox analysis. In total, 471 males and 244 females died during the follow-up period. There were 221 CV deaths among males and 85 among females. The relative risk of CV death after adjustment for other parameters (age, screening, cigarette smoking, body mass index, education level, cholesterol level, anginal symptoms, systolic blood pressure and self-assessed health status) was approximately 40% lower among males who consumed alcohol compared with the abstinents. The lowest risk of CV death was noted in the first tertile group. Females who consumed alcohol, had a 40-70% lower CV risk of death than abstinents the lowest risk was documented for the third tertile group. Alcohol consumption independently lowers the risk of death due to cardio-vascular diseases.\n\nOccurrence of cardiovascular drugs in the sewage-impacted Vistula River and in tap water in the Warsaw region (Poland).\n\nPubMed\n\nGiebuÅtowicz, Joanna; Stankiewicz, Albert; WroczyÅski, Piotr; NaÅÄcz-Jawecki, Grzegorz\n\n2016-12-01\n\nIn recent years, cardiovascular diseases were the second most common cause of death worldwide. Therefore, the consumption of drugs used to treat cardiovascular diseases is high. So far, there were no such comprehensive reports regarding the presence of cardiovascular drugs in surface and tap waters, particularly in Central and Eastern Europe. The aim of our study was to determine the presence of 30 pharmaceutically active compounds and some of their metabolites, at specific points of the Vistula River and in tap water samples in the Warsaw region. The analysis was performed using the liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry method, coupled to solid-phase extraction. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first time where the presence of ciprofibrate in the environment was investigated. Cardiovascular drugs found at the highest concentrations (reaching 1Â Î¼g/L or higher) in surface water were beta-blockers, sartans and diuretics. In tap water samples, trace amounts of pharmaceuticals were detected, for almost all target compounds. This highlights their inadequate elimination by the treatment facility used in the Warsaw region. The presence of cardiovascular compounds in the aquatic environment could have a long-term effect even at a low exposure level, since synergy effects amongst pharmaceuticals may occur.\n\n[Smoking among patients of selected specialist clinics of Miedzylesie Specialist Hospital in Warsaw].\n\nPubMed\n\nPytka, Dorota; DoboszyÅska, Anna\n\n2011-01-01\n\nThe purpose of the study is to examine the issue of smoking among patients of selected clinics of the Miedzylesie Specialist Hospital in Warsaw, assessment of nicotine addiction of smokers and motivation to give up smoking. The survey was carried out in June and July 2009 after obtaining the consent of the Director of Miedzylesie Specialist Hospital in Warsaw. The survey was participated in by 100 patients of selected specialist clinics. The survey was carried out on the basis of a questionnaire consisting of 7 questions. Furthermore, the \"Test of motivation to give up smoking\" (Schneider's test) and the \"Assessment of nicotine addiction level\" (FagerstrÃ¶m's test), published in the \"Consensus regarding recognition and treatment of nicotine addiction\", were used. When processing data, the descriptive statistics were applied. Those surveyed included 53 former cigarette smokers 47 active smokers and. In the group of former smokers, 19 people still were exposed to passive smoking. In the past, the problem regarded 41 people. Thirty former smokers smoked cigarettes among non-smokers, including young children (18 people) and when pregnant and breastfeeding (2 people). Also 30 respondents smoked despite medical contraindications and bad conscience. For 27 people, expenditures on cigarettes constituted a considerable burden of their respective household budgets, and 20 said that it was a significant item in their expenditures. Smokers have been smoking cigarettes for 30 years, on average 20 cigarettes a day. Those patients began to smoke at the age of 20. Thirty one active smokers exposed other people to passive smoking and 38 respondents smoked cigarettes despite medical contraindications and with bad conscience. For 22 people, expenditures related to smoking are a considerable burden of the household budget and for 21 people, it is a significant expenditure. Almost one half of the patients smoke cigarettes although they should brake off smoking for medical reasons.

With each method, 136 midnight relative humidity profiles were obtained for lidar observations from July 2013 to August 2015. Comparisons of these profiles showed in favor of the latter method (iii), but it also indicated that the other two data sources could replace it, if necessary. Such use was demonstrated for an automated retrieval of water vapor mixing ratio from dusk until dawn on 19/20 March 2015; a case study related to an advection of biomass burning aerosol from forest fires over Ukraine. Additionally, an algorithm that applies thresholds to the radiosounding relative humidity profiles to estimate macro-physical cloud vertical structure was used for the first time on the Raman lidar relative humidity profiles. The results, based on a subset of 66 profiles, indicate that below 6 km cloud bases/tops can be successfully obtained in 53% and 76% cases from lidar and radiosounding profiles, respectively. Finally, a contribution of the lidar derived mean relative humidity to cloudy conditions within the range of 0.8 to 6.2 km, in comparison to clear-sky conditions, was estimated.\n\nPLASMA-2013: International Conference on Research and Applications of Plasmas (Warsaw, Poland, 2-6 September 2013)\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSadowski, Marek J.\n\n2014-05-01\n\nThe PLASMA-2013 International Conference on Research and Applications of Plasmas was held in Warsaw (Poland) from 2 to 6 September 2013. The conference was organized by the Institute of Plasma Physics and Laser Microfusion, under the auspices of the Polish Physical Society. The scope of the PLASMA conferences, which have been organized every two years since 1993, covers almost all issues of plasma physics and fusion research as well as selected problems of plasma technology. The PLASMA-2013 conference topics included: â¢Elementary processes and general plasma physics. â¢Plasmas in tokamaks and stellarators (magnetic confinement fusion). â¢Plasmas generated by laser beams and inertial confinement fusion. â¢Plasmas produced by Z-pinch and plasma-focus discharges. â¢Low-temperature plasma physics. â¢Space plasmas and laboratory astrophysics. â¢Plasma diagnostic methods and applications of plasmas. This conference was designed not only for plasma researchers and engineers, but also for students from all over the world, in particular for those from Central and Eastern Europe. Almost 140 participants had the opportunity to hear 9 general lectures, 11 topical talks and 26 oral presentations, as well as to see and discuss around 120 posters. From about 140 contributions, after the preparation of about 100 papers and the peer review process, only 74 papers have been accepted for publication in this topical issue. Acknowledgments Acting on behalf of the International Scientific Committee I would like to express our thanks to all the invited speakers and all the participants of the PLASMA-2013 conference for their numerous contributions. In particular, I wish to thank all of the authors of papers submitted for publication in this topical issue of Physica Scripta .

I have used the local DFA (Detrended Functional Analysis) to obtain the Hurst exponent (diffusion exponent) and investigate the signature of anti-correlation of share price evolution around the maximum. The analysis was applied to the share price evolution for variable DFA parameters. For many values of parameters, the evidence of anti-correlation near the WIG20 maximum was pointed out.\n\nResults from a first production of enhanced Silicon Sensor Test Structures produced by ITE Warsaw\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBergauer, T.; Dragicevic, M.; Frey, M.; Grabiec, P.; Grodner, M.; HÃ¤nsel, S.; Hartmann, F.; Hoffmann, K.-H.; Hrubec, J.; Krammer, M.; Kucharski, K.; Macchiolo, A.; Marczewski, J.\n\n2009-01-01\n\nMonitoring the manufacturing process of silicon sensors is essential to ensure stable quality of the produced detectors. During the CMS silicon sensor production we were utilising small Test Structures (TS) incorporated on the cut-away of the wafers to measure certain process-relevant parameters. Experience from the CMS production and quality assurance led to enhancements of these TS. Another important application of TS is the commissioning of new vendors. The measurements provide us with a good understanding of the capabilities of a vendor's process. A first batch of the new TS was produced at the Institute of Electron Technology in Warsaw Poland. We will first review the improvements to the original CMS test structures and then discuss a selection of important measurements performed on this first batch.\n\nEuroguidelines in Central and Eastern Europe (ECEE) conference and the Warsaw Declaration - a comprehensive meeting report.\n\nPubMed\n\nKowalska, J D; Oprea, C; de Witt, S; Pozniak, A; GÃ¶kengin, D; Youle, M; Lundgren, J D; Horban, A\n\n2017-05-01\n\nThe objective of this paper is to summarize the outcomes of the Euroguidelines in Central and Eastern Europe (ECEE) conference held in Warsaw in February 2016. The main aim of this conference was to facilitate a discussion on European AIDS Clinical Society (EACS) guidelines implementation across the region and neighbouring countries and to present the current obstacles in benchmarking HIV care in Europe. During a 2-day meeting, there were country-based presentations using a predefined template so as to make the data comparable and focus the discussion. Areas covered were country epidemiology, surveillance, national strategy for treatment and prevention, standards of care, access to care and treatment availability. Each participant filled in a questionnaire investigating HIV guidelines usage per country. In total, 16 Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) and neighbouring countries were represented at the conference: Albania, Armenia, Belarus, Croatia, Czech Republic, Estonia, Georgia, Hungary, Lithuania, Moldova, Poland, Romania, Russia, Serbia, Slovakia and Turkey. EACS guidelines version 7.1 were used in 14 (87%) countries. In 11 (69%) countries, national guidelines were available, of which eight had been recently updated. Half of the countries declared that they use World Health Organization (WHO) and Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) guidelines, over one-third the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) HIV testing guidelines and one in five the International Antiviral Society-USA (IAS-USA) Panel guidelines from 2012. Participants declared their will to promote the widespread use of EACS guidelines for HIV infection in the CEE region and neighbouring countries by signing the Warsaw Declaration. They also emphasized the need to increase publishing of data from national cohorts in that region.

Use of different types of treatment].\n\nPubMed\n\nSupranowicz, Piotr; Wysocki, MirosÅaw J; Car, Justyna; Debska, Anna; Gebska-Kuczerowska, Anita\n\n2012-01-01\n\nThe global economic crisis led to the need to reduce the public expenditure, including health care. In a situation of reduction of the publicly guaranteed benefits, some services may be available only in private physicians for particular patients. Therefore, there is a need to examine factors determining the use of both types of health care. The aim of the study was to assess the association between the use of free treatment of general practitioner and the use of private physician services on one hand, and health and its disorders, assessment of physician, and expenditure on treatment of the Warsaw inhabitants on other hand. The data were collected from 402 Warsaw inhabitants by not-addressed questionnaire elaborated in Health Promotion and Postgraduate Education Department of the National Institute of Public Health-National Institute of Hygiene. Our findings showed that the majority of respondents used the both types of health care. Males, people from the youngest and the oldest group, those having elementary education, students and unemployed were more likely to use only free treatment from general practitioner, whereas people aged 30-44 years, higher educated, employed and those depending on other people were more often treated only by private physicians. The beneficiaries of only private physician services higher evaluated their health, physically felt better, perceived stronger social support and rarely remained at home due to illness. Private physicians were evaluated more positively in comparison with general practitioner practicing in public health care, nevertheless, the difference was not large. With respect to their own financial situation, the people using private physician services did not find higher medical expenses than those using only the general practitioner of public health care. CONCLUSIONS. Our research indicates that uncontrolled development of private medical services market may increase inequality in access to health care, if not protected\n\nNighttime lidar water vapor mixing ratio profiling over Warsaw - impact of the relative humidity profile on cloud formation\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nCosta SurÃ³s, Montserrat; Stachlewska, Iwona S.\n\n2016-04-01\n\nA long-term study, assessing ground-based remote Raman lidar versus in-situ radiosounding has been conducted with the aim of improving the knowledge on the water content vertical profile through the atmosphere, and thus the conditions for cloud formation processes. Water vapor mixing ratio (WVMR) and relative humidity (RH) profiles were retrieved from ADR Lidar (PollyXT-type, EARLINET site in Warsaw). So far, more than 100 nighttime profiles averaged over 1h around midnight from July 2013 to December 2015 have been investigated. Data were evaluated with molecular extinctions calculated using two approximations: the US62 standard atmosphere and the radiosounding launched in Legionowo (12374). The calibration factor CH2O for lidar retrievals was obtained for each profile using the regression method and the profile method to determine the best calibration factor approximation to be used in the final WVMR and RH calculation. Thus, statistically representative results for comparisons between lidar WVMR median profiles obtained by calibrating using radiosounding profiles and using atmospheric synthetic profiles, all of them with the best calibration factor, will be presented. Finally, in order to constrain the conditions of cloud formation in function of the RH profile, the COS14 algorithm, capable of deriving cloud bases and tops by applying thresholds to the RH profiles, was applied to find the cloud vertical structure (CVS). The algorithm was former applied to radiosounding profiles at SGP-ARM site and tested against the CVS obtained from the Active Remote Sensing of Clouds (ARSCL) data. Similarly, it was applied for lidar measurements at the Warsaw measurement site.\n\nAmnion allografts prepared in the Central Tissue Bank in Warsaw.\n\nPubMed\n\nTyszkiewicz, J T; Uhrynowska-Tyszkiewicz, I A; Kaminski, A; Dziedzic-Goclawska, A\n\n1999-01-01\n\nApplications of allogenic amnion grafts range from wound dressing of severe burns, dermabrasions and lower extremity ulcer treatments to plastic surgery, laryngology and ophthalmology. The aim of the present study was to elaborate the method of processing, preservation and sterilization of human amnion allografts prepared as wound dressing used mainly for burned patients. During the amniotic sac processing (after separation of chorion) special attention was paid to ensure that the epithelial side of amnion is placed directly on polyester net used as a support. After application on the wound, the epithelial side with the basement membrane is facing outwards; this will promote migration, attachment and spreading of the host cells encouraging epithelialization. Human amnion allografts were preserved by lyophilization or deep-freezing and subsequently radiation-sterilized with a dose of 35 kGy. It has been observed, however, that lyophilized irradiated allografts are resorbed within a few days, while frozen irradiated ones better adhere to wound and persist even 3 weeks after grafting, therefore, it has been decided to preserve amnion by deep-freezing. Since the beginning of 1998 over 400 preserved radiation-sterilized amnion allografts (with a total surface area over 40,000 cm2) have been prepared at the Central Tissue Bank in Warsaw and distributed to clinics and hospitals throughout the country.\n\nFeasibility studies and pre-design simulation of Warsaw's new wastewater treatment plant.\n\nPubMed\n\nOleszkiewicz, J A; Kalinowska, E; Dold, P; Barnard, J L; Bieniowski, M; Ferenc, Z; Jones, R; Rypina, A; Sudol, J\n\n2004-12-01\n\nThe proposed transfer of wastewater from the western part of Warsaw, across the Wisla (Vistula) River for joint treatment at the existing eastern side \"Czajka\" wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) will result in combined winter flows of approx. 580,000 m3 d(-1). One-year of pilot-scale studies defined the COD characteristics and kinetics of nitrogen removal and VFA production from primary sludge. BioWin simulation was used to size and price the optional processes and pointed to the Westbank process as the most cost-effective. The process consists of a sequence of a RAS pre-denitrification zone followed by an anaerobic, anoxic and aerobic zone. Some 100-150 t d(-1) of 10% methanol would be needed to remove 2-4 mg l(-1) of NO3-N above the recommended effluent level TN = 10 mg l(-1). Applying the principle of annual average 80% TN removal, and allowing for use of daily composite samples (rather than grab) could annually save the municipality over 1.5 million Euro on external carbon source.\n\nBulgarian military neurosurgery: from Warsaw Pact to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.\n\nPubMed\n\nEnchev, Yavor; Eftimov, Tihomir\n\n2010-05-01\n\nAfter 45 years as a closest ally of the Soviet Union in the Warsaw Pact, founded mainly against the US and the Western Europe countries, and 15 years of democratic changes, since 2004 Bulgaria has been a full member of NATO and an equal and trusted partner of its former enemies. The unprecedented transformation has affected all aspects of the Bulgarian society. As a function of the Bulgarian Armed Forces, Bulgarian military medicine and in particular Bulgarian military neurosurgery is indivisibly connected with their development. The history of Bulgarian military neurosurgery is the history of the transition from the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics military system and military medicine to NATO standards in every aspect. The career of the military neurosurgeon in Bulgaria is in many ways similar to that of the civilian neurosurgeon, but there are also many peculiarities. The purpose of this study was to outline the background and the history of Bulgarian military neurosurgery as well as its future trends in the conditions of world globalization.\n\nOutbreak of Ceftazidime-Resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae in a Pediatric Hospital in Warsaw, Poland: Clonal Spread of the TEM-47 Extended-Spectrum Î²-Lactamase (ESBL)-Producing Strain and Transfer of a Plasmid Carrying the SHV-5-Like ESBL-Encoding Gene\n\nPubMed Central\n\nGniadkowski, Marek; PaÅucha, Andrzej; Grzesiowski, PaweÅ; Hryniewicz, Waleria\n\n1998-01-01\n\nIn 1996 a large, 300-bed pediatric hospital in Warsaw, Poland, started a program of monitoring infections caused by extended-spectrum Î²-lactamase (ESBL)-producing microorganisms. Over the first 3-month period eight Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates were identified as being resistant to ceftazidime. Six of these were found to produce the TEM-47 ESBL, which we first described in a K. pneumoniae strain recovered a year before in a pediatric hospital in ÅÃ³dÅº, Poland, which is 140 km from Warsaw. Typing results revealed a very close relatedness among all these isolates, which suggested that the clonal outbreak in Warsaw was caused by a strain possibly imported from ÅÃ³dÅº. The remaining two isolates expressed the SHV-5-like ESBL, which resulted from the horizontal transfer of a plasmid carrying the blaSHV gene between nonrelated strains. The data presented here exemplify the complexity of the epidemiological situation concerning ESBL producers typical for large Polish hospitals, in which no ESBL-monitoring programs were in place prior to 1995.

Historically, airports are understood as places of aircraft landing, control towers operation and location of other facilities used for communication and transport. This traditional model is giving way to the concept of so-called Airport Cities, based on the assumption that, in addition to its infrastructure and air services, also non-air services are performed, constituting a source of income. At the same time, their reach and impact on the economy of the areas around the airport are expanding. Idea City Airport appeared in the United States in the late twentieth century. The author is J. D. Kasarda, he believes that it is around these big air ports that airport cities develop. In the world, there are currently 45 areas which can be classified in this category, out of which 12 are located in Europe. Main air traffic hubs in Europe are not only the most important passenger traffic junctions, but also largest centres dispatching goods (cargo). It can be said that, among the 30 largest airports, 24 are the largest in terms of both passenger and freight traffic. These airports cover up to 89.9% of the total freight transport of all European airports. At the same time, they serve 56.9% of all passengers in Europe. Based on the concept of Airport City was developed document THE INTEGRATED REGIONAL POLYCENTRIC DEVELOPMENT PLANS FOR THE WARSAW MODLIN AIRPORT CATCHMENT AREA. The plan developed takes into account the findings of the Mazovian voivodeship spatial development plan, specifying the details of its provisions where possible. The development is the first step for the implementation of the concept of the Modlin Airport City. The accomplishment of this ambitious vision will only be possible with hard work of a number of entities, as well as taking into account the former Modlin Fortress, currently under revitalisation, in concepts and plans.\n\nDeterminants of self-rated health of Warsaw inhabitants.\n\nPubMed\n\nSupranowicz, Piotr; Wysocki, MirosÅaw J; Car, Justyna; Debska, Anna; Gebska-Kuczerowska, Anita\n\n2012-01-01\n\nSelf-rated health is a one-point measure commonly used for recognising subjectively perceived health and covering a wide range of individual's health aspects. The aim of our study was to examine the extent to which self-rated health reflects the differences due to demographic characteristics, physical, psychical and social well-being, health disorders, occurrence of chronic disease and negative life events in Polish social and cultural conditions. Data were collected by non-addressed questionnaire methods from 402 Warsaw inhabitants. The questionnaire contained the questions concerning self-rated health, physical, psychical and social well-being, the use of health care services, occurrence of chronic disease and contact with negative life events. The analysis showed that worse self-rated health increased exponentially with age and less sharply with lower level of education. Pensioners were more likely to assess their own health worse then employed or students. Such difference was not found for unemployed. Compared to married, the self-rated health of divorced or widowed respondents was lower. Gender does not differentiate self-rated health. In regard to well-being, self-rated health linearly decreased for physical well-being, for social and, especially, for psychical well-being the differences were significant, but more complicated. Hospitalisation, especially repeated, strongly determined worse self-rated health. In contrast, relationship between self-rated health and sickness absence or frequency of contact with physician were lower. Chronic diseases substantially increased the risk of poorer self-rated health, and their co-morbidity increased the risk exponentially. The patients with cancer were the group, in which the risk several times exceeded that reported for the patients of other diseases. Regarding negative life events, only experience with violence and financial difficulties were resulted in worse self-rated health. Our findings confirmed the usefulness\n\n\"Eurotrain for Training.\" Proceedings of a European Congress on Continuing Education and Training (4th, Berlin, Germany; Warsaw, Poland; Prague, Czechoslovakia; Budapest, Hungary; Vienna, Austria, October 5-9, 1992).\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nWisser, Ulrike, Ed.; Grootings, Peter, Ed.\n\n1992-01-01\n\nA \"travelling\" congress was conducted in five European cities (Berlin, Warsaw, Prague, Budapest, and Vienna) to promote a mutual exchange of views between east and west.

The quantification of the health risks and benefits arising from these factors would provide useful information for the planning of cost-effective mitigation actions. In this study we quantified the burden of disease caused by local transport in the city of Warsaw, Poland. The disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) were estimated for transport related air pollution (particulate matter (PM), nitrogen oxides (NOx), sulfur dioxide (SO2), benzo[a]pyrene (BaP), cadmium, lead and nickel), noise, injuries and physical activity. Exposure to these factors was based on local and international data, and the exposure-response functions (ERFs) were based on published reviews and recommendations. The uncertainties were quantified and propagated with the Monte Carlo method. Local transport generated air pollution, noise and injuries were estimated to cause approximately 58,000 DALYs in the study area. From this burden 44% was due to air pollution and 46% due to noise. Transport related physical activity was estimated to cause a health benefit of 17,000 DALYs. Main quantified uncertainties were related to disability weight for the annoyance (due to noise) and to the ERFs for fine particulate matter (PM2.5) air pollution and walking. The results indicate that the health burden of transport could be mitigated by reducing motorized transport, which causes air pollution and noise, and by encouraging walking and cycling in the study area.

The phenotypic tests recommended by EUCAST for the detection of ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae are not always suited for P. aeruginosa strains. This is mainly due to the presence of other families of ESBLs in P. aeruginosa isolates more often than in Enterobacteriaceae, production of natural AmpC cephalosporinase and its overexpression, and co-production of metallo-Î²-lactamases. The aim of this study was to determine the occurrence of ESBLs in P. aeruginosa isolated from patients from hospitals in Warsaw, to evaluate the ESBL production of these isolates using currently available phenotypic tests, their modifications, multiplex PCR and molecular typing of ESBL-positive isolates by PFGE. Clinical isolates of P. aeruginosa were collected in 2000-2014 from four Warsaw hospitals. Based on the data obtained in this study, we suggest using three DDST methods with inhibitors, such as clavulanic acid, sulbactam and imipenem, to detect ESBL-producing P. aeruginosa strains. Depending on the appearance of the plates, we suggest a reduction in the distance between discs with antibiotics to 15 mm and the addition of boronic acid at 0.4 mg per disc. The analysed isolates carried genes encoding ESBL from the families VEB (69 isolates with VEB-9), GES (6 with GES-1, 1 GES-5, 5 GES-13 and 2 with GES-15), OXA-2 (12 with OXA-15, 1 OXA-141, 1 OXA-210, 1 OXA-543 and 1 with OXA-544) and OXA-10 (5 isolates with OXA-74 and one with OXA-142). The most important result of this study was the discovery of three new genes, blaGES-15, blaOXA-141 and blaOXA-142; their nucleotide sequences have been submitted to the NCBI GenBank. It is also very important to note that this is the first report on the epidemiological problem of VEB-9-producing bacterial strains, not only in Poland but also worldwide.

Changes in gene expression have been implicated in mediating brain functions, including reward system and addiction. The current study aimed to identify genes that may underlie differential ethanol preference in Warsaw High Preferring (WHP) and Warsaw Low Preferring (WLP) rats. Microarray analysis comparing gene expression in nucleus accumbens (NAc), hippocampus (HP) and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) was performed in male WHP and WLP rats bred for differences in ethanol preference. Differential and stable between biological repeats expression of 345, 254 and 129 transcripts in NAc, HP and mPFC was detected. Identified genes and processes included known mediators of ethanol response (Mx2, Fam111a, Itpr1, Gabra4, Agtr1a, LTP/LTD, renin-angiotensin signaling pathway), toxicity (Sult1c2a, Ces1, inflammatory response), as well as genes involved in regulation of important addiction-related brain systems such as dopamine, tachykinin or acetylcholine (Gng7, Tac4, Slc5a7). The identified candidate genes may underlie differential ethanol preference in an animal model of alcoholism.

Investigations by polarised optical microscopy, scanning microscopy, powder X-ray diffraction and simultaneous thermal analysis were preformed. Based on the results obtained, it was concluded that terrazzo tiles were prepared on the basis of ordinary Portland cement and aggregate, dominated with crushed stone (marble, serpentinite, limestone and marl), accompanied by sparse quartz sand grains. The binding mass was colourised with the use of pigments containing iron ions. The occurrence of altered serpentinite and marble grains, the latter clouded and partly replaced with micrite, the presence of portlandite, indicate the terrazzo tiles were subjected to thermal impact. This is related to the fire that took place at the beginning of World War II. Based on this study, repair mortars were formulated, on one hand compatible with the authentic ones, on the other retaining traces of fire.\n\nBe Healthy as a Fish Educational Program at the International Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology in Warsaw, Poland\n\nPubMed Central\n\nSzymaÅska, Ewelina; BiaÅek-Wyrzykowska, Urszula; Wiweger, MaÅgorzata; KuÅºnicki, Jacek\n\n2016-01-01\n\nAbstract The purpose of the Be Healthy as a Fish educational program that is organized by the International Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology (IIMCB) in Warsaw, Poland, is to educate children about the ways in which zebrafish can be used as a model organism to help scientists understand the way the human body works. We introduce Be Healthy as a Fish workshops to children in fourth to sixth grades of primary school (9â11 years old), together with two kinds of materials under the same title: a book and a movie. We focus on the field of biology in a way that complements the children's classroom curriculum and encourages them to broaden their interests in biology in the future. The Be Healthy as a Fish educational program was inaugurated in 2014 at the Warsaw Science Festival. As of October 31, 2015, 526 primary school students participated in 27 workshops. Approximately 2000 people have received the book and nearly 1700 people have watched the movie. Be Healthy as a Fish: Origin of the Title There is a popular saying in Poland that someone is âhealthy as a fishâ meaning that one enjoys good health. Does this imply that fish are really that healthy? Obviously, some fish may not be healthy. Just like other animals and humans, they can and do get sick. However, this common and deceptive impression of âhealthy fishâ results from the fact that people hardly ever have an opportunity to observe a fish that is sick. Why does our educational program have such a possibly misleading title that may not always be true? We took advantage of this provocative title and commonly known expression and assigned to it a completely new meaning: fish can get sick, but they are important for human health. Notably, this catchy sentence intrinsically combines two keywordsâhealth and fishâwhich, in our opinion, makes it a good title for a successful educational program.

To date there have not been any reports regarding the presence of these pharmaceuticals in surface and tap waters in Eastern Europe. Therefore the aim of this study was to determine the presence of 21 antidepressant pharmaceuticals at specific points of the main Polish river - the Vistula, a smaller river of the Warsaw region - the Utrata, as well as in tap water samples of Warsaw. Samples were collected twice at one month intervals and analysed using solid-phase extraction (SPE) technique coupled with the liquid chromatography-electrospray ionisation-tandem mass spectrometer (LC-MS/MS) method operated under the multiple reaction monitoring mode (MRM). This is the first study where active compounds such as moclobemid or trazodone in the environment have been investigated. Environmental risk assessment of antidepressants in Poland was estimated on the basis of annuals sale data extracted from the NFZ (Narodowy Fundusz Zdrowia-National Health Service) base of reimbursed pharmaceuticals(1). Predicted environmental concentration (PEC) of target pharmaceuticals were compared with their measured concentration (MEC). Moreover, the application of the EMEA/CHMP guideline for environmental risk assessment of the antidepressants was discussed. The highest concentration of antidepressants was observed in the small river Utrata. In tap water only trace amounts of antidepressants including citalopram (up to 1.5ng/l), mianserin (up to 0.9ng/l), sertraline (<3.1ng/l), moclobemid (up to 0.3ng/l) and venlafaxine (up to 1.9ng/l) were detected. However this highlights their inadequate elimination in the drinking waste treatment facility. The presence of antidepressants in drinking water and the aquatic environment could have long-term effects even at low exposure level\n\nBe Healthy as a Fish Educational Program at the International Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology in Warsaw, Poland.\n\nPubMed\n\nGoÅ, Daria; SzymaÅska, Ewelina; BiaÅek-Wyrzykowska, Urszula; Wiweger, MaÅgorzata; KuÅºnicki, Jacek\n\n2016-08-01\n\nThe purpose of the Be Healthy as a Fish educational program that is organized by the International Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology (IIMCB) in Warsaw, Poland, is to educate children about the ways in which zebrafish can be used as a model organism to help scientists understand the way the human body works.

The samples of sediments, soil, and plants were analyzed in terms of Cu and Cd content. The research concerned the heap of dredged bottom sediments from WyÅcigi Pond, Warsaw, Poland. Two boreholes were made to obtain sediment cores with depths of A 162.5Â cm and B 190.0Â cm. The cores were divided into 10 sub-samples with a thickness of about 15-20Â cm. A control sample of soil was taken from the horse racecourse several hundred meters away from the heap. The vegetation was sampled directly from the heap. The predominating plants were tested: Urtica dioica, Glechoma hederacea, Euonymus verrucosus, and Drepanocladus aduncus. A control sample of U. dioica taken outside of the heap was also tested. The commercial PHYTOTOXKIT microbiotest was applied to evaluate the influence of heavy metal-contaminated sediments (used as soil) on germination and growth of the chosen test plants. The analyses of cadmium and copper concentrations revealed that the metal concentration in sediments was diverse at different depths of sampling, probably reflecting their concentration in stored layers of sediments. Moreover, the metal content in core A was four to five times lower than that in core B, which reveals heterogeneity of the sediments in the tested heap. In core A, the copper concentration ranged from 4.7 to 13.4Â mg/kg d.w. (average 8.06âÂ±â0.71Â mg/kg d.w.), while in core B, it ranged from 9.2 to 82.1Â mg/kg d.w. (average 38.56âÂ±â2.6Â mg/kg d.w.). One of the results of the heavy metal presence in soils is their bioaccumulation in plants. Comparing plant growth, more intensive growth of roots was observed in the case of plants growing on the control (reference) soil than those growing on sediments. The intensive development of both primary and lateral roots was noticed. During this early growth, metal accumulation in plants occurred.\n\nEvaluation of vitamins A, C and E content in diets of adolescents living in Warsaw, Poland.\n\nPubMed\n\nDybkowska, Ewa; Waszkiewicz-Robak, Bozena; Piekot, Edyta\n\n2014-01-01\n\nAntioxidant vitamins such as alpha-tocopherol (vitamin E), ascorbic acid (vitamin C), and beta-carotene (provitamin A), play a significant role in protecting the body from an excess of free radicals. The vitamin content of the diet is thus very important. To assess whether the dietary intake of vitamins A, C and E is adequate in a selected group of adolescents living in Warsaw. The mean vitamin consumption was estimated using three-day dietary records whilst vitamin contents of selected foodstuffs were obtained from Food Composition Tables. Both were related to Polish nutrition standards applied to adolescents; i.e. EAR (Estimated Average Requirement) for vitamins A and C and AI (Adequate Intake) for vitamin E. Dietary vitamin C in adolescents and vitamin E in girls were around 18-25% lower than that recommended. Diets that were deficient in vitamins C and E were recorded in 47% to 67% adolescents. It is therefore necessary to increase the consumption of vegetables and fruit which provide a valuable dietary source for these vitamins.\n\nBurden of Mortality and Disease Attributable to Multiple Air Pollutants in Warsaw, Poland\n\nPubMed Central\n\nKaÅuszko, Andrzej; Nahorski, Zbigniew\n\n2017-01-01\n\nAir pollution is a significant public health issue all over the world, especially in urban areas where a large number of inhabitants are affected. In this study, we quantify the health burden due to local air pollution for Warsaw, Poland. The health impact of the main air pollutants, PM, NOX, SO2, CO, C6H6, BaP and heavy metals is considered. The annual mean concentrations are predicted with the CALPUFF air quality modeling system using the year 2012 emission and meteorological data. The emission field comprises point, mobile and area sources. The exposure to these pollutants was estimated using population data with a spatial resolution of 0.5 Ã 0.5 km2. Changes in mortality and in disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) were estimated with relative risk functions obtained from literature. It has been predicted that local emissions cause approximately 1600 attributable deaths and 29,000 DALYs per year. About 80% of the health burden was due to exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5). Mobile and area sources contributed 46% and 52% of total DALYs, respectively. When the inflow from outside was included, the burden nearly doubled to 51,000 DALYs. These results indicate that local decisions can potentially reduce associated negative health effects, but a national-level policy is required for reducing the strong environmental impact of PM emissions.

The studied population was divided into six age categories. The study method was a diagnostic poll conducted with the use of an original questionnaire containing 10 multiple-choice questions. Results Nearly 70% of the women showed an interest in taking a test to detect predispositions to develop breast and ovarian cancer. More than 10% did not want to take such a test, while every fifth women was undecided. No statistically significant differences between the respondentsâ willingness to pay and education were found (p = 0.05). The most frequent answer given by women in all groups was that the amount to pay was too high. Such an answer was given by 52.17% of women with primary education, 65.22% of women with vocational education, 58.61% of women with secondary education, and 41.62% of women with higher education. Conclusions Women with a confirmed increased risk of developing breast and/or ovarian cancer due to inter alia the presence of BRCA1 and BRCA2 gene mutations should pay particular attention to 1st and 2nd level prophylaxis.

The Case of the National Economy Bank in Warsaw Restored During the Second World War\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nÅotysz, SÅawomir\n\n2016-12-01\n\nThe Polish national historiography remains silent on the reconstruction of damaged towns and cities that was undertaken by the German administration after capturing Poland in September 1939. This paper, on the war-time restoration of the National Economy Bank's headquarters in Warsaw, is an attempt to at least partially fill the gap. Designed by celebrated architect Rudolf ÅwierczyÅski in the late 1920s in accordance with contemporary air raid defence regulations, it was bombed and nevertheless seriously damaged during the September Campaign. Under the German management of the bank, the building was reconstructed and even modernized by commissioned Polish engineers.\n\nEffects of visitor pressure on understory vegetation in Warsaw forested parks (Poland).\n\nPubMed\n\nSikorski, Piotr; Szumacher, Iwona; Sikorska, Daria; Kozak, Marcin; Wierzba, Marek\n\n2013-07-01\n\nVisitor's access to understorey vegetation in park forest stands results in the impoverishment of plant species composition and a reduction in habitat quality. The phenomenon of biotic homogenisation is typical in urban landscapes, but it can proceed differently depending on the scale, a detail that has not been observed in previous studies. This research was carried out in seven Warsaw parks (both public and restricted access). Thirty-four forested areas were randomly selected, some subjected to strong visitors' pressure and some within restricted access areas, free of such impacts. The latter category included woodlands growing in old forest and secondary habitats. Public access to the study areas contributed to the disappearance of some forest species and their replacement by cosmopolitan non-forest species, leading to loss of floristic biodiversity in areas of high ecological importance at the city scale. Some human-induced factors, including soil compaction and changes in soil pH, moisture and capillary volume, were found to cause habitat changes that favoured native non-forest plants. Despite changes in species composition, the taxonomic similarity of understorey vegetation in both categories--public access and restricted access--was comparable. In a distance gradient of measurements taken around selected individual trees, there was found to be significant variation (in light, soil pH and compaction) affecting the quality and quantity of understorey vegetation (including rare species). In conclusion, the protection of rare forest species could be achieved by limiting access to forested areas, particularly in old forest fragments, and we highly recommend its consideration in the proposal of future park restoration plans.\n\nThe use of copula functions for modeling the risk of investment in shares traded on the Warsaw Stock Exchange\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nDomino, Krzysztof; BÅachowicz, Tomasz\n\n2014-11-01\n\nIn our work copula functions and the Hurst exponent calculated using the local Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (DFA) were used to investigate the risk of investment made in shares traded on the Warsaw Stock Exchange. The combination of copula functions and the Hurst exponent calculated using local DFA is a new approach. For copula function analysis bivariate variables composed of shares prices of the PEKAO bank (a big bank with high capitalization) and other banks (PKOBP, BZ WBK, MBANK and HANDLOWY in decreasing capitalization order) and companies from other branches (KGHM-mining industry, PKNORLEN-petrol industry as well as ASSECO-software industry) were used. Hurst exponents were calculated for daily shares prices and used to predict high drops of those prices. It appeared to be a v"
