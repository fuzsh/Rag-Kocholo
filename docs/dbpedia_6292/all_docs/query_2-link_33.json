Polish documentary film was also the special guest at, among others, DOK Leipzig Film Festival, Trieste Film Festival and GZ DOC in China. We were also present on the short list for the Academy Awards and among the nominees for the European Film Award. We would like to invite you to read the summary of the previous year.\n\nIn 2016, Polish documentary film was very successful in the international arena. For the sixth time, the editors of Polish Docs prepared a numerical summary of festival screenings and awards won by Polish film-makers.\n\nLast year, Polish documentary films were shown at almost 230 festivals around the world. During twelve months, almost 430 film screenings took place, approximately 330 out of which were competition screenings. In 2016, international festival audience at the festivals watched almost 90 Polish documentary films.\n\nThis year, once again short films became the favourites of the foreign audience. The festival record-breaker is the animated documentary film, entitled \"A Documentary Film\" by Marcin Podolec, shown abroad as many as 43 times. The second place went to \"Super Unit,\" directed by Teresa Czepiec, with the number of 22 screenings. It is worth adding that this film came second in our list also last year. Whereas this year, the last film on the podium is \"End of the World\" by Monika Pawluczuk, shown abroad 21 times.\n\nIn 2016, the films, which were successful last year, continued to enjoy popularity. \"The Place\" by Julia Popławska was shown to the audiences at 16 festivals, whereas \"Object\" by Paulina Skibińska, \"Brothers\" by Wojciech Staroń, \"Casa Blanca\" by Aleksandra Maciuszek and \"Invisible\" by Zofia Pręgowska each had 14 screenings abroad. Polish mountain documentary films are also constantly successful: \"K2. Touching the Sky\" by Eliza Kubarska can boast the number of 17 screenings, whereas \"Jurek\" by Paweł Wysoczański - 10 presentations.\n\nThere is no lack of new players on this year's list. \"Snails\" by Grzegorz Szczepaniak were shown 16 times at the festivals abroad, \"Two Worlds\" by Maciej Adamek and \"A Brave Bunch. Children of Warsaw Uprising\" by Tomasz Stankiewicz - 11 times.\n\nLast year, Polish documentary film-makers won over 80 awards around the world. Here, mountain documentary films were also successful. In 2016, \"Jurek\" won 8 awards, \"K2. Touching the Sky\" - 11, and \"The Place\" - 4. The film \"The Touch of an Angel\" by Marek Tomasz Pawłowski can boast seven awards, \"Casa Blanca\" and \"Call Me Marianna\" – fiveawards each, and \"A Documentary Film,\" \"Two Worlds\" and \"End of the World\" were eachawarded four times.\n\nPrestigious awards went to the short documentary film \"Close Ties.\" The film was given the IDFA Special Jury Award for Student Documentary in Amsterdam, as well as the Golden Dove at the Festival Dok.Leipzig. The Silver Dragon, won at Krakow Film Festival, enabled the film to apply for the Academy Award nomination. The film by Zofia Kowalewska was included on the short-list for the Academy Award in the category \"Documentary Short Subject.\"\n\n\"Close Ties\" is not the only documentary film awarded at the festival IDFA, \"When Will This Wind Stop\" by Aniela Gabryel won the ARRI IDFA Award for Best Student Documentary in Amsterdam.\n\nImportant awards went also to \"Communion\" by Anna Zamecka. The documentary film was honoured during the Film Critics' Week in Locarno - and it left Locarno with the Premio SRG SSR award. The film also won the Best Documentary Film award at the festival in Bratislava and the Young Eyes Film Award at the festival DOK Leipzig.
