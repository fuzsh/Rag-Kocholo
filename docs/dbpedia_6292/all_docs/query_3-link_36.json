        "text": "by Editor Miro Susta\n\nEdited and published by Yvette Depaepe, the 26th of July\n\nPart two “From Handball to Wrestling” - (If interested, click here for Part one).\n\nToday, 26th July 2024, the 33rd Summer Olympic Games will kick off in Paris. For the first time, the opening ceremony will not take place inside a stadium, but in the centre of Paris and with boats on a 6km route along the famous Seine River!\n\nOn this day, the French capital will be transformed into a gigantic stadium and the largest sports stage. The traditional parade of athletes will pass the most famous Parisian landmarks in boats on the Seine.\n\nOn the evening of 26th August, the famous Olympic flame will end its long journey from Athens to Paris at the Jardin des Tuileries, where it will burn during the Olympic Games until 11th August 2024.\n\n'La Conciergerie' by Jean-Charles Mudet\n\nDuring planning for the ceremony, care was taken to ensure that the largest possible audience, an estimated 600,000 people, could attend and that most visitors would not have to pay an entrance fee.\n\nAn estimate of 10,500 athletes from 206 National Olympic Committees and the IOC Refugee Olympic Team will take part at the Paris 2024 Olympic Games — and for the first time ever, the split will be 50% men and 50% women.\n\nThe Olympic Games are expected to draw around fifteen million visitors.\n\nThe athletes will compete for the highly prestigious Olympic Medals in following sports:\n\nArchery, Artistic gymnastics, Athletics, Badminton, Basketball, 3x3 basketball, Beach volleyball, BMX racing, Boxing, Breakdance, Canoeing, Equestrian, Fencing, Football, Golf, Handball, Hockey, Judo, Modern pentathlon, Mountain biking, Open water swimming, Rhythmic gymnastics, Road cycling, Rowing, Rugby, Sailing, Shooting, Scate boarding, Sport climbing, Surfing, Swimming, Synchronized swimming, Table tennis, Taekwondo, Tennis, Track cycling, Trampolining, Triathlon, Volleyball, Water jumping, Water polo, Weightlifting and Wrestling.\n\nHANDBALL\n\nThe beginning of handball is considered to be 29th October 1917, when the head gymnastics coach in Berlin, Max Heiser, decided that the game he had designed for women in 1915, ‘goalball’, should be called ‘handball’ in future.\n\n'Handball' by Dusan Ignac\n\nHandball first became part of the Olympic programme in 1936 (as field or grass handball) and was a demonstration sport at the Helsinki 1952 Games but has only officially returned to it in Munich 1972 (as indoor Handball) and in Montreal 1976 with the premiere of the women's tournament.\n\n'Handball' by Rainer Mueller\n\nSince then, handball has not been absent from any Games. Historically, France has been the most successful country among the men with three gold medals, while Denmark has also won three times in the women's event.\n\nJUDO\n\nJudo is more than just a sport. Judo was created in Japan in the 19th century, by combining a variety of different forms of fighting. In the present time, it is estimated that over forty million people across the planet participate in this sport.\n\nThe judo values: Courtesy, honesty, respect, modesty, courage, self-control, friendship, helpfulness, seriousness, and appreciation.\n\n'Judoka' by Rainer Mueller\n\nJudo has been an Olympic sport continuously since the 1964 Tokyo Olympics except for 1968 in Mexico City. Seven men's and seven women's weight classes will be contested in Paris. There will also be a mixed team competition.\n\nUnsurprisingly, Japan, the home of the sport, is also the leading country in this sport, having historically racked up forty-eight gold, twenty-one silver and twenty-seven bronze Olympic medals.\n\nMOUNTAIN BIKING\n\nIn this racing cycling sport, bikers leave the paved roads and cycle across the terrain. There are hardly any paths that cannot be ridden on.\n\n'The leader' by Benny Pettersson\n\nSince 1996, the mountain bike cross-country race for men and women has been included in the programme of the Summer Olympic Games.\n\nThe traditional mountain bike superpowers are Switzerland and France.\n\nOPEN WATER SWIMMING\n\nOpen water marathon swimming became the last swimming discipline to be included in the Olympic programme when the 10km race was included at the 2008 Beijing Games.\n\n'Swimming race' by Halit Kartal\n\nThe Seine River will host the open water swimming events during the Games.\n\nIt is estimated that the fastest men will complete the ten kilometres in less than one hour and fifty minutes, and the fastest women will cross the finish line in less than two hours.\n\nRHYTMIC GYMNASTICS\n\nAs the younger sister of artistic gymnastic, rhythmic gymnastics did join the Olympics in Los Angeles 1984.\n\n'Rhythmic Gymnastics' by Anna Wan\n\nEastern European countries and particularly Russia heavily dominate in this sport; Russia for example has taken home ten out of seventeen titles since rhythmic gymnastics joined the Olympic programme.\n\nROAD CYCLING\n\nRoad cycling has always been a part of the Olympic programme since the very beginning in 1896.

It only became a sport in England between the end of the 17th and the beginning of the 18th century.\n\nThe first major rowing competition took place in 1820, which is now known as the Oxford and Cambridge Boat Race and is held annually.\n\n'Armony' by Francisco Jose Lopez Fernandez\n\nRowing was not absent from any Olympic Games except the first in 1896. In Montréal 1976, the women's events were included in the competitions.

Americans have won thirty-three gold, thirty-two silver and twenty-four bronze medals.\n\nRUGBY\n\nThe game of rugby was originally invented at rugby school in England. A boy named William Webb Ellis was impatient when playing football and decided to carry the ball with his hands.\n\n'Rugby' by Cesar March\n\nThis simple action was to become the basis for the new game, which quickly gained popularity. In the years that followed, the rules of the game evolved, and the first rugby clubs were founded.Although rugby made its debut at the 1900 Olympics, it dropped out of the programme after 1924 Games and did not return until the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Games.\n\n'Chaos on the Field' by Darlene Hewson\n\nIn the men's event, each Fiji and USA players have won twice in a row, while Australia and New Zealand have been victorious in the women's event.\n\nSAILING\n\nSailing was included in the programme at the first Games in 1896, but the races were cancelled due to severe weather conditions. Since then, however, except for 1904, it has always been in competition.\n\nThe sailing competitions will head for the Mediterranean. The start will be in the Roucas-Blanc harbour in the city of Marseille where five men's, four women's and one mixed event will be held.\n\n'Full speed race' by Marc Pelissier\n\nGreat Britain leads the Olympic sailing medal tally with a combined total of sixty-three medals (thirty gold), followed by the USA with sixty-one medals (nineteen gold) and France with fifty-one medals (seventeen gold).\n\nSCATE BOARDING\n\nOne of the latest Olympic sports is skateboarding, which made its debut in Tokyo in 2021.\n\n'High Jump' by Antonyus Bunjamin (Abe)\n\nThere are two men's and two women's categories. Three of the four events have been dominated by Japanese athletes, who may well be among the favourites in Paris.\n\nSURFING\n\nSurfing made its Olympic debut in 2021 at the most recent Games in Tokyo. This year's competition is scheduled to take place on the island of Tahiti in French Polynesia in the middle of the Pacific Ocean.\n\n'Breakthrough' by Jie Cheng\n\nThe gold medal is to be defended by Brazil in the men's and by the USA in the women's event.\n\n'Surf's Up!' by Annie Poreider\n\nSWIMMING\n\nSwimming has been a regular part of Olympic programme since its very beginning in 1896, when only four men's categories were competed.\n\nThe nation that is widely recognized as the best at swimming in the Olympics is the USA. Since the inception of the modern Olympic Games, USA has been dominating the sport of swimming with a total of 520 medals won, 246 of them gold. This is more than double the number of medals won by the second-ranked country, Australia.\n\n'Start' by Milan Malovrh\n\nUSA swimmer Michael Phelps has so far won the most medals at the Olympic Games, a total of twenty-eight, including twenty-three gold, three silver and two bronze medals.

Former Soviet Union leads the Olympic medal table in weightlifting with thirty-nine gold, twenty-one silver and two bronze medals ahead of China with thirty-eight gold, sixteen silver and eight bronze and USA with sixteen gold, seventeen silver and eleven bronze medals.\n\nWRESTLING\n\nWrestling, whose history stretches back to the ancient times, can be considered one of the characteristic sports of the Olympic Games.\n\nWrestling has been a part of the Olympic programme from the very beginning, except for 1900.\n\nOriginally, there was only one wrestling category, the men's Greco-Roman style. Over time, however, freestyle wrestling was added to the program in seven weight classes, and since 2004 women also participate in the freestyle.\n\nBa Chukhe wrestling Mohammad Sorkhabi (Sorkhe Abi)\n\nWith sixty-two Olympic gold medals in wrestling, the former Soviet Union ranks first in the historical rankings. Among current countries, the United States leads with fifty-seven gold medals.\n\nFinally, I would like to express my great appreciations and congratulations to all contributing authors and all not mentioned 1x sports photographers, as I consider sports photography to be one of the most challenging categories of action photography.\n\nCapturing emotions and telling an entire story in one picture is an art.\n\nWhy is sports photography particularly challenging? Because sports images emphasise the action movement and emotion factor.\n\nFor example, it is not easy task to capture a football player receives a ball in the air but is obstructed by an opponent at exactly right moment.\n\n'Kick behind the back' by Daniel Åström\n\n‘It takes a bit of luck to take a perfect sports picture,’ says Alessandro Della Bella, who has been working as a sports photographer for many years.\n\nBut it takes more than just luck. It takes a sense of the right moment to press the shutter button and capture key scenes focussing on action and emotion.\n\nA good picture also requires knowledge of the distinctive features of the respective sport. The photographer must understand the sport and always be focussed. Full concentration throughout an entire sporting event is absolutely necessary.\n\nHave a wonderful time following the Games, be it at home in front of the TV, at a Public Viewing or on the ground in Paris.\n\nAnd if you are in Paris, do not forget to capture the sports action and then bring it to the 1x photo gallery."
