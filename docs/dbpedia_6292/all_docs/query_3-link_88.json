        "text": "Team GB have taken their medal total past the 60 mark on a 'Super Saturday' with Georgia Bell producing a stunning performance in the 1500m to claim bronze\n\nOn the penultimate day of the Paris Olympics, Great Britain’s Georgia Bell collected 1500 metres bronze and set a new national record on the final day of track action in a race won by Kenya’s Faith Kipyegon in Olympic record time.\n\nBell patiently executed her race and started to pounce on the back stretch in the final lap.\n\nIn the Velodrome, Team GB were left furious as Oliver Wood was left sprawling on the track after being 'headbutted' by a Dutch rival. Wood said he felt like a “crash test dummy” after being sent sprawling by Jan Willem van Schip.\n\nTeam GB's Kate Shortman and Izzy Thorpe won a silver medal in the women’s artistic swimming duet.\n\nTeam USA won the Women's Football final, beating Brazil 1-0 as Emma Hayes, the iconic ex-Chelsea boss, landed a gold medal. And it was a fifth successive gold medal for Team USA in the men's basketball final as they defeated France 98-87 in a fiercely contested finale in the French capital.\n\nAdditionally, George Mills was left disappointed after not medalling in the Men's 5000m Final. He said: \"I gave my best in every race, and there’s not anything more I could’ve done.\"\n\nHeading into the final day of Olympic action, Team GB sit sixth in the overall table having amassed 14 gold medals and 63 medals overall.\n\nKeep scrolling to follow all of the action from day 15 of the the Paris Olympic Games...\n\n22:41Megan Feringa\n\nA penultimate day of Olympic action comes to an end\n\nAnd that's it for our Olympic live blog today. What a day it's been. China still lead the way in the medal table with 39 gold medals, but the United States are right behind them with 38 old medals courtesy of Team USA's victory over France in the basketball final.\n\nIt's been a sensational showing from Team GB, who sit sixth in the overall medal table with 14 gold medals behind hosts France, Japan and Australia.\n\nTomorrow is the final day of the Paris Games, so make sure to check back in for all the final day drama in store.\n\nGoodbye for now!\n\n22:25Megan Feringa\n\nSweden win beach volleyball gold\n\nSweden’s David Ahman and Jonatan Hellvig beat Germany’s Nils Ehlers and Clemens Wickler in straight sets to win the beach volleyball gold medal.\n\nThe Swedish pair won the first set 21-10 and the second 21-13 in front of the Eiffel Tower.\n\n22:19Megan Feringa\n\nUSA win gold in Paris\n\nWhat a game. USA defeat France 98-87. The hosts deserve so many plaudits for a superb fight against the defending champions. Victor Wembanyama is in tears and is currently being consoled by his fellow NBA stars.\n\nBut this Olympic Games ultimately belonged to Steph Curry, who ensured that it's five basketball gold medals on the bounce for defending champions Team USA.\n\n22:14Megan Feringa\n\nParis belongs to Steph Curry\n\nThis man. After having a startling quiet start to these Games, the gold medal final has belonged to him. That's his eighth triple of the night, fourth in a row and WHAT A FOURTH it was.\n\nThe USA have not made this easy, nor have France allowed them too. But there's very little you can do when you're playing a Lights-Out-Shooting-King Curry.\n\n22:10Megan Feringa\n\nWhat a final this is!\n\nWe can't provide accurate updates here because it's so chaotic. Literally a basketball game. France were within three points of the USA until Steph Curry drained a three with his usual Curry elan, before the USA extended their lead back to eight points.\n\nBut Victor Wembanyama has been a sensation all game and is refusing to relinquish the victory just yet. Which is the 20-year-old's perogative if we're being honest. What a campaign he's had in his home country.\n\n22:03Megan Feringa\n\nBasketball update\n\nIt's intense, but the USA are comfortable in their lead of eight points. France are playing well and producing some wonderful basketball. But that's overshadowed by the rampaging all-action wonder that is Lebron James hunting down a gold medal.\n\nWe're halfway through this fourth quarter. And it's drama, drama, drama.\n\n21:59Megan Feringa\n\nHeading into the final day of Olympics action...\n\nAre we really at the end? You know what they say. It's not about the destination.... unless it's the Olympics. Then it's only about the destination. And that destination is the medal table.\n\nAs of right now, China lead the way with 39 gold medals (their overall tally is 90). The United States are right behind with 37 gold medals, while touting a ridiculous 121 medals in total. From there, Australia and Japan are level with 18 goals apiece, followed by France with 16 and Team GB with 14.\n\n21:53Megan Feringa\n\nFourth quarter, here we go.\n\nFrance are still in this, courtesy of a scintillating third quarter display which saw them outscore their American opponents 25-23.\n\nTeam USA have been sloppy, turning the ball over 12 times as they recovered from a 14-point deficit.\n\nFinal 10 minutes? High-stakes drama in the French capital? Bring it on.\n\n21:47Megan Feringa\n\nFrance holding on against the USA\n\nOr they're trying to. As we typed the above, Lebron James stuffed a three-point shot down the French team's throat to extend his team's lead to a more comfortable nine points.\n\nBut France are letting up here, fueled on by the raucuous home crowd.\n\n21:29Megan Feringa\n\nMen's basketball final update\n\nThe second-half is officially underway. The USA have the lead, but this game is certainly only getting into its calf stretches. We're expecting a dramatic and tense finale with the hosts refusing to give in.\n\nThat is, unless manager Steve Kerr has put the thunder back in his side. If that's been done, then we expect this to be rather straightforward.\n\nStay tuned.\n\n21:17Megan Feringa\n\nMcGowan speaks out after bronze medal loss\n\nBritain's Rebecca McGowan told Eurosport after losing the bronze medal: “It’s a bit raw right now, I am just devastated.\n\n“A massive thank you to those in the crowd supporting and all at home. I am just sorry.”\n\n21:13Megan Feringa\n\nLin Yu-ting wins gold medal in boxing\n\nThe Taiwanese boxer defeated Poland's Julia Szeremeta in the gold medal featherweight bout.\n\nLin's participation at this summer's game has been a subject of intense controversy and debate. Alongside Algeria's Imane Khelif, who also won gold, Lin found herself at the centre of a gender-test storm.\n\nBoth boxers were banned by the disgraced IBA after underdoing gender tests, though the IBA failed to release the details of the tests.\n\nThe IOC permitted the participation of both boxers, but the governing body has come under significant condemnation from corners of the political and sporting world.\n\nYou can read the full story below.\n\n21:10Megan Feringa\n\nCunningham wins silver for Team GB\n\nCaden Cunningham was cheered on by his family including mum Lisa and dad Trevor, a former champion kickboxer, as he left Paris with a silver medal, writes Jeremy Armstrong.\n\nIt completes a remarkable rise through the ranks for the young fighter from Huddersfield, West Yorkshire.\n\nJust six years ago he had to launch a crowdfunding appeal to pay for his trip to the world championships in Tunisia as the sport’s junior level doesn’t get full funding.\n\nThe 21-year-old, a part-time model, took up the sport when he was six. He was given a weekly prize of sweets.\n\n20:55Megan Feringa\n\nMen's basketball update\n\nFrance are dreaming and their dreams look feasible. The USA have been forced to call an emergency time out after France rallied eight successive points to take the lead without response from the reigning champions.\n\nIt's been a wonderful spectacle so far in the French capital, in large part to these young French players wanting to put on a show. And indeed they are.\n\nTeam USA on the otherhand look as they did against Serbia: scatter-brained, frenetic, disjointed. A lot of star power without a much-needed binder.\n\n20:53Megan Feringa\n\nTeam GB's McGowan loses bronze medal match\n\nHeartbreak for McGowan. After the British athlete recovered in round 1, she could never get the better of her Turkish opposition Kus Aydin who took the third round 5-2. She bursts into tears, so much emotion.\n\n20:44Megan Feringa\n\nTeam GB in action in the Taekwondo\n\nGB's Rebecca McGowan is in action tonight in the women’s +67kg bronze medal final against Turkey’s Nafia Kus Aydin.\n\nThe Turkey star stormed into an early lead, but McGowan recovered to win the first round after landing at least two head kicks. But Aydin did well to take the second round.\n\n20:40Megan Feringa\n\nMen's basketball final underway\n\nIt's the hosts versus the reigning (five-time) champions in the basketball final tonight.\n\nUSA are the obvious favourites to win, but France will be hoping to disrupt history with a shock win tonight. Steve Kerr's side showed a rare vulnerability against Serbia that was very nearly punished before Lebron James went full berserker mode to ensure history continued to repeat himself.\n\nCan France spring a surprise tonight?\n\n20:20Megan Feringa\n\nTeam GB claim silver in women's artistic swimming\n\nGreat Britain’s Kate Shortman and Izzy Thorpe have won a silver medal in the women’s duet at the Paris Olympics.\n\n20:08Megan Feringa\n\nMen's 4x400m relay final goes to USA\n\nUSA claim another gold medal, with Botswana winning silver and GB claiming bronze.\n\nThe USA had a good start and while Botswana had a really impressive third 400m, they just missed out on pipping the Americans to the gold medal.\n\n19:57Press Association\n\nJoe Choong slams Britain's selection policy after girlfriend snub\n\nJoe Choong hit out at Britain’s selection policy and the governance of modern pentathlon after failing to defend his Olympic title in Paris.\n\nThe 29-year-old was part of a brilliant double British success in Tokyo along with women’s champion Kate French but needed a miracle after a poor fencing ranking round on Thursday.\n\nHe scraped through to the final by finishing eighth in Friday’s semi-final and performed almost as strongly as he could have in the riding, swimming and laser run, eventually claiming ninth place, well adrift of Egyptian winner Ahmed Elgendy.\n\nChoong blamed his poor fencing performance on the decision not to select his girlfriend Olivia Green, saying:\n\n“I wish I’d been able to bring home a medal this time round.\n\n“I showed physically I got my preparation right, I just mentally wasn’t in the right head space to perform when it mattered a couple of days ago so I left too much to do.\n\n“The saying goes a happy athlete’s a good athlete, and I think that’s true. I’ve not been particularly happy with the training environment for a couple of months.\n\n“The decision around not picking my girlfriend, that process was really disappointing. It’s been difficult to work through that.”\n\n19:40KEY EVENT\n\nGeorgie Bell claims incredible bronze!\n\nGeorgia Bell completed her incredible journey from the local park run to Olympic bronze medallist!\n\nThe Londoner had given up on athletics after finishing college but decided to start running again just three years ago to keep fit.\n\nShe earned her first GB call up a matter of weeks ago and took bronze in the 1500m in a new British record of 3:52:61, taking 14 seconds off her PB.\n\nIt took Team GB's total at the Games to a Super 60 on what organisers called 'Super Saturday', with 59 gold medals up for grabs.\n\nGeorgia, who specialises in artificial intelligence, was beaten to silver by just five hundredths of a second as Aussie Jessica Hull crossed the line in 3:52:56. Kenyan Faith Kipyegon set a new Olympic record to take gold in 3:51:29.\n\n19:21Megan Feringa\n\nIngebrigtsen wins men's 5000m gold\n\nJAKOB INGEBRIGTSEN earned a sweet taste of redemption by charging home to win the 5000m, writes Alan Smith from Paris.\n\nThe Norwegian shrugged off some of the frustration from his 1500m failure to win in 13:13.66 after a last-lap burn up in which his speed from the shorter distance paid handsome dividends.\n\nDespite a bloated start line of 22 men because of four athletes being afforded byes following a shambolic series of falls in the semi-finals, there was surprisingly little chaos in a race that began at a saunter and only wound up with 800m to go.\n\nEthiopia’s Hagos Gebrhiwet led at the bell before Ingebrigtsen moved up the gears going into the final bend and kicked on to win comfortably.\n\nIn an attempt to fend off Ingebrigtsen, Gebrhiwet went too early and he was overtaken by Kenya’s Ronald Kwemoi and America’s Grant Fisher to complete the podium.\n\nIngebrigtsen had already won the past two world championship titles over the longer distance but he is intent on continuing with the 1500m for the next Olympic cycle despite falling short in the past three championship finals.\n\nBritain’s George Mills, who had reacted furiously after becoming one of those tripped in the semis, finished 21st in 13:32.32\n\n19:12KEY EVENT\n\nTeam GB star involved in collision\n\nTeam GB star Oliver Wood saw his hopes of an Olympic medal in the men's madison event ended by a horror crash.\n\nWood was taken out by Dutch rider an-Willem van Schip, who appeared to lead with his head as he crashed into the 28-year-old Brit. The incident cost Team GB a place on the podium, with Wood and team-mate Mark Stewart ending up in a lowly 12th place. Van Schip escaped the incident without punishment as he rode away.\n\nYou can read the full story here.\n\n19:04Megan Feringa\n\nMen's high jump update\n\nDefending champion Gianmarco Tamberi cleared 2.22 on his third attempt and he celebrated wildly, the prospect of retaining his title still in reach. But the Italian failed to clear 2.27m, meaning Tamberi, Czech Republic’s Jan Stefela and Jamaica’s Romaine Beckford are knocked out.\n\nTamberi, the joint gold medallist in Tokyo, was a doubt for the competition today after suffering from health issues at this Games. You can tell the Italian is devastated.\n\n18:57Megan Feringa\n\nUSA win gold in women's hurdles\n\nTHEY WERE made to wait for it but France finally claimed a first athletics medal on the final evening of action thanks to Cyrena Samba-Mayela, writes Alan Smith from Paris.\n\nThe 100m hurdler initially thought she had won a mildly surprising gold to almost lift the roof off Stade de France.\n\nBut after her name briefly appeared in first place on the big screen, it was removed to show that American Masai Russell had instead pipped her by one-hundredth of a second in a winning time of 12.33secs.\n\nPre-race favourite Jasmine Cmacho-Quinn earned bronze - just three-hundredths of a second behind the winner.\n\n18:18Megan Feringa\n\nMarta's career ends in silver\n\nHeartbreak for Marta, who will now officially sign off her historic career with a silver medal.\n\nIt's a volatile mix of emotions for the Brazil legend. Marta was inconsolable after being sent off in this year's group stages, incurring a two-game ban and staring down the spectre of an illustrious career ground to a halt with a red card as her last act.\n\nBut two wonderful displays from her teammates meant redemption and maybe a fairy tale in the gold medal final.\n\nEnter: the USWNT. Enter: Emma Hayes. Enter: Alyssa Naeher.\n\nBrazil had chances and will rue those they wasted. With 88 minutes gone and Brazil needing something special, Marta standing over a free kick in a dangerous area seemed to signal just that. But it wasn't meant to be for one of the finest footballers in women's football history, who bows out in Paris.\n\n18:11Megan Feringa\n\nScenes at the Parc de Princes as Emma Hayes wins her first major honour as USWNT head coach\n\n18:09Megan Feringa\n\nTom Cruise and Megan Rapinoe celebrate the USWNT's gold medal victory\n\n18:06Megan Feringa\n\nUSWNT clinch gold over Brazil in women's football final\n\nWhat a difference a year makes. Or rather, an Emma Hayes makes.\n\nThis USWNT is unrecognisable from the one that reached an historic nadir Down Under just 12 months ago. It's back to winning ways for the former world champions and you have to wonder whether this is only the beginning for America's Hayes Era.\n\nThere are plenty of areas in new of improvement, and some places worthy of criticism, including whether entrusting so many minutes in a select few players is sustainable in the long term.\n\nBut for now, it's Emma Hayes' USWNT's world. And we're all just living in it.\n\nTop StoriesDon't Miss\n\nMORE ON"
