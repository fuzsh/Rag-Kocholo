        "meta_description": "In a 5000m final that was worth a whole bag of popcorns, Faith Kipyegon had the last laugh as her silver medal was reinstated following a successful appeal, leaving Kenya with silver and gold following Beatrice Chebet's victory.Kipyegon was judged to have committed an infringement when tangling with Ethiopia's Gudaf Tsegay which meant that the silver she won was handed to Dutchwoman Sifan Hassan who finished third.##NAJAVA_MECA_8252665##But following a successful appeal from Team Kenya, the medal was rightfully handed back to Kipyegon who had left the Stade de France arena in tears after learning of the disqualification.\"The Jury of Appeal has reviewed all available evidence and agreed there was significant contact between, and by the two athletes. The Jury concluded that the incident did not warrant a disqualification.The Jury wishes to make clear that jostling of this nature is never acceptable and therefore recommends that Faith Kipyegon receives a disciplinary yellow card which would carry throughout the remainder of the Games,\" read part of the ruling.Kenya had suffered disappointments since the track and field events began at the Paris Olympics but finally the whole nation had something to celebrate after Beatrice Chebet secured the first gold on her debut at the games.Chebet cruised to victory in the 5000m, stunning pre-race favourite Faith Kipyegon and a strong field to the gold.Chebet clocked 14:28.56, while her compatriot Kipyegon finished in 14:29:60 with the outgoing champion Hassan timing a season’s best of 14:30.61.##NAJAVA_MECA_8249369##Battocletti who finished fourth run a national record of 14:31.64 as well.Before the race, expectations for Kipyegon to carry the day were high given that she had declared herself ripe for double success in Paris, just like she did during last year’s World Athletics Championships in Budapest.She was well on course to mine gold, but Chebet out sprinted her in the final 50 metres to clinch top honours.Paris Olympics: Kenyan trio advance to 3000m Steeplechase finalHassan had been aiming to become the first woman in history to win 5,000m, 10,000m, and marathon gold at the same Olympics, emulating the feat achieved by men's distance running legend Emile Zatopek at the 1952 Helsinki Games.Chebet will certainly be delighted with the win, as it will further decorate his profile as she is the 10000m record holder.She won silver in the 2022 World Championships and settled for bronze in last year’s edition.There is a possibility for the world cross country champion to add another medal in Paris, as she is set to feature in the 10000m final.She will seek to dethrone Hassan in the final set for Friday.",
