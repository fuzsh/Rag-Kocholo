She is a USA Swimming certified coach and has been coaching with the STJ swim team since 2019.\n\nAs the child of an Army Officer, Jessie grew up moving around the country but has lived in VA since 2011. She attended Marymount University and graduated with a B.S. in Biochemistry in 2020. Bricker swam competitively for 16 years on club teams around the country and with the NVSL when located in VA. Her swimming experience also includes being on the Marymount women's swim team for four years and being a co-captain for her final season.\n\nJessie started coaching in 2014 as a lane coach for the MVP Gators. She fell in love with it and has continued in various capacities ever since. She has coached summer league, all age group levels, masters swimming, pro bono coaching, and private lessons. In addition to coaching at STJ she was also the Head Coach for the Hunt Valley Stingrays from 2021-2023.\n\nJessie has a passion for swimming and sharing her love of the sport through coaching the next generation of swimmers. She believes in the quality over quantity philosophy and strives to recognize each athlete as a unique individual to best help them learn and grow, both as a swimmer and as an individual.\n\nJessie is also an Officer in the U.S. Army Reserves, and is pursuing her Doctorate in Physical Therapy at Marymount University. She is a travel enthusiast and proud dog mom to her puppy Theo.\n\n“Success is not final; Failure is not fatal; It is the courage to continue that counts.”\n\n- Winston Churchill\n\nASSISTANT HEAD COACH - Chris Stankiewicz\n\n13-14 Group Competitive Team\n\n9-10 Group Competitive Team\n\nChristopher Stankiewicz graduated from George Mason University in 2020 with a B.A. in Government and International Politics, as well as minors in International Security, and Economics.\n\nStankiewicz has been a USA Swimming certified coach since 2018, and has worked with swimmers of all ages. He recently completed his pool operator certification, and his first year as Head Coach at Hunt Valley Swim Club, an NVSL division two program in Springfield, VA.\n\nStankiewicz competed for the George Mason University NCAA Division 1 Men’s Swim and Dive Team from 2016-2020, earning the A10 Conference Athlete of the Week award twice in his career as a Patriot. He helped the men’s team achieve its first ever Atlantic Ten Conference Team Championship in 2020, and is grateful for the camaraderie and life-long friendships made during his time at university.\n\nStankiewicz grew up swimming in the Northern Virginia Swim League (NVSL) and Potomac Valley Swimming (PVS), and has experience working as a private instructor and swim clinician since 2014. Chris is a self-proclaimed “swimming nerd,” and student of the sport. Swimming has been his life-long passion, and he is excited to share his love of the sport with the athletes. Chris is looking forward to using his experiences as an athlete and a coach to help swimmers grow and achieve their dreams.\n\nAGE GROUP COACH - Cosmo DiFazio\n\n11-12 Group Competitive Team\n\nHello! My name is Cosmo DiFazio, and I am a software developer and swim coach from Charlottesville, Virginia. With over 10 years of competitive swimming experience and another 10 years of coaching experience, I feel like I practically live on the pool deck in the best possible way!\n\nI have swam and coached multiple swim leagues, including USA Swimming, the Jefferson Swim League, and the Virginia Independent Schools Athletic Association. Most of my coaching experience comes from VISAA, where I have been leading my former high school swim team since 2018. I am proud to have led that team to win two state championships and seven conference championships in that time.\n\nMy coaching philosophy is to try to be intentional about everything and ensure stroke technique is sound before worrying too much about speed. My practices tend to favor drill work over raw yardage because I believe that taking the time to establish a solid foundation in each stroke will serve the athlete better in the long run. I believe this approach helps to avoid injury due to over training and also makes my practices accessible to more athletes regardless of skill level.\n\nI am very excited to be a coach at STJ again this season! I have been here since last season and I have greatly enjoyed getting to know all the swimmers and coaches. I especially enjoyed running the afternoon practices this past long course season, and I am looking forward to picking up where we left off in the fall! I hope each swimmer enjoys their time swimming with me as their coach and I hope I can help them achieve their goals!\n\nAGE GROUP COACH - Michelle Poole\n\n11-12 Group Competitive Team\n\n8+ Under Group Competitive Team\n\nHello! I'm Coach Poole and I've been immersed in the world of competitive swimming for as long as I can remember. My personal journey with swimming began as a child, where I committed to year-round training with elite swim clubs. This dedication saw me wake up every morning to be at the pool by 5am, and yes, that included those freezing spring mornings when our sessions were outdoors!\n\nMy passion for swimming is unwavering. To me, swimming is more than just a sport; it's a discipline that shapes character, fosters resilience, and brings joy. It has instilled in me the values of hard work, commitment, and the tenacity to push beyond my limits. These are the very same values I aim to impart to every swimmer I coach.\n\nOutside of the pool, I am equally passionate about health and fitness. On any given day, if I'm not coaching, you'll find me pursuing some form of exercise. It's this holistic approach to wellness that I believe compliments my coaching philosophy beautifully.\n\nI have had the privilege of coaching at St. James for academics, specifically the Splash and Stroke Academy, and have also been offering private lessons to aspiring swimmers. In addition to my coaching responsibilities, I wear the hat of a real estate agent and am a proud mom of two.\n\nSpeaking of which, my children are the apples of my eye, both of whom are incredibly talented swimmers. My son, Harrison, recently wrapped up his first year of swimming at St. James and has made us tremendously proud by emerging as an NVSL Divisional Champion for his local club team for the 2023 Season.\n\nIn every role I play, be it as a coach, a mother, or a real estate agent, my aim is to inspire, guide, and empower. I'm thrilled to be part of your swimming journey and look forward to making waves together!\n\nAGE GROUP COACH - Meghan Curley\n\nMorning Group Competitive Team\n\nMeghan Curley has been a dedicated coach since 2017, bringing a wealth of experience and enthusiasm to her role at The St. James.

All questions, and conversations can be addressed at the end of practice.\n\nAll athletes will use the non-member locker rooms before, during and after practices.\n\nAll athletes will leave their electronics in their swim bags. There are no phones or electronic devices permitted in the locker rooms or on the pool deck.\n\nAll athletes will bring their water bottles to every practice! (Coach Jessie recommends keeping an empty bottle in the gear bag and filling it up on deck before practice then emptying anything left over after practice.)\n\nThe St. James Elite Team\n\nObjective:\n\nTo help encourage athletes of all ages and abilities to experiment and get experience in multiple events.\n\nTo give athletes incentive to create and reach goals.\n\nTo challenge swimmers to participate in meets and reach out of their comfort zone.\n\nStandards:\n\nThe first goal is for each swimmer to complete their respective age-group goals. To do this they must swim and get legal and official times in ALL the events in their age-group’s required events. Each swimmer has the entire season from September 1st 2021 until August 2022 to complete the events in USA Swimming sanctioned swim meets (summer league not included). Once the swimmer completes ALL the events, they will earn their Elite Team Patch.\n\nThe second goal is to earn National Age Group Time Standards (form attached). This can only be earned after earning the Elite Team Patch.\n\nB Star – awarded with the swimmer earns 7 B times\n\nBB Star – awarded when the swimmer earns 6 BB times\n\nA Star – awarded when the swimmer earns 5 A times\n\nAA Star – awarded when the swimmer earns 4 AA times\n\nAAA Star- awarded when the swimmer earns 3 AAA times\n\nAAAA Star – awarded when the swimmer earns 2 AAA times\n\nHow To:\n\nIn order to prove and receive the earned patches and stars the swimmer must fill out their respective form with the official USA Swimming times found from online meet results. Once the form is complete the athlete can turn the form into a coach and they will receive their earned award as soon as the form is checked and processed.\n\nThe St. James Swim Club\n\nElite Team\n\n8 & Under\n\nName:______________________________________________________\n\nDate of Birth:_____/_______/______\n\n*Please fill in the best time column and then check respective boxes\n\nAthlete’s Signature______________________________________________________\n\nCoach’s Signature______________________________________________________\n\nDate:____/____/_____\n\nThe St. James Swim Club\n\nElite Team\n\n9-10\n\nName:______________________________________________________\n\nDate of Birth:_____/_______/______\n\n*Please fill in the best time column and then check respective boxes\n\nAthlete’s Signature______________________________________________________\n\nCoach’s Signature______________________________________________________\n\nDate:____/____/_____\n\nThe St. James Swim Club\n\nElite Team\n\n11-12\n\nName:______________________________________________________\n\nDate of Birth:_____/_______/______\n\n*Please fill in the best time column and then check respective boxes\n\nAthlete’s Signature______________________________________________________\n\nCoach’s Signature______________________________________________________\n\nDate:____/____/_____\n\nThe St. James Swim Club\n\nElite Team\n\n13-14\n\nName:______________________________________________________\n\nDate of Birth:_____/_______/______\n\n*Please fill in the best time column and then check respective boxes\n\nAthlete’s Signature______________________________________________________\n\nCoach’s Signature______________________________________________________\n\nDate:____/____/____\n\nThe St. James Swim Club\n\nElite Team\n\n15-18\n\nName:______________________________________________________\n\nDate of Birth:_____/_______/______\n\n*Please fill in the best time column and then check respective boxes\n\nAthlete’s Signature______________________________________________________\n\nCoach’s Signature______________________________________________________\n\nDate:____/____/____\n\nParent Volunteers\n\nMeets\n\nAs we all know, swimming tends to be a whole family event.
