        "text": "Clara Hughes\n\nCanadian cyclist and speed skater\n\nClara Hughes (born September 27, 1972, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada) is a former cyclist and speed skater who is the only athlete to have won multiple medals at both the Summer and Winter Olympics, with two medals in cycling and four medals in speed skating. She also won a combined total of 35 national championships in road cycling, track cycling, and speed skating, and she won eight medals in cycling at the Pan American Games and three medals in cycling at the Commonwealth Games.\n\nEarly career\n\nInspired by Gaétan Boucher’s success in the 1984 Olympic Winter Games in Sarajevo and by the 1988 Olympic Winter Games in Calgary, Hughes took up speed skating at 16 and won a junior national title in the 3,000 meters. She skated competitively for two years and started cycling in 1990 as a means of cross-training for the winter sport. At that time Andrea Auch (sister of Susan Auch, two-time Olympic speed skating silver medalist) was working for a cycling association and told officials about Hughes’s tremendous potential as a cyclist. After some deliberation, Hughes decided to leave skating to become an Olympic cyclist.\n\nCycling\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nQuick Quiz: All About Cycling\n\nDuring the 1990s Hughes established herself as a major force in the world of cycling. In 1991 she won a silver medal at the Pan American Games and became a member of the Canadian National Cycling Team. She won a silver medal at the 1995 World Cycling Championships and silver and bronze medals at the 1995 Pan American Games. She also competed in four Tours de France Féminins and won multiple Canadian championships.\n\nAt the 1996 Olympic Summer Games in Atlanta, she earned two bronze medals, one in the time trial and one in the most demanding of cycling events, the road race. For most of 1998, Hughes battled retrocalcaneal bursitis, a nagging ankle ailment, and temporarily retired. She resumed her training in January 1999 and won gold at the nationals that year, but struggled a month later at the Pan American Games. Less than a week before the world championships, she was hit by a car while training but still competed and finished seventh in the time trial. She went on to compete at the 2000 Olympic Summer Games in Sydney and placed sixth. After the 2000 Olympics, Hughes decided to pursue a speed skating career.\n\nHughes continued to cycle after resuming speed skating, competing in numerous races for her professional team, Saturn, and in 2003 she won gold, silver, and bronze medals at the Pan American Games. In 2010, at the age of 38, she announced her comeback to international cycling competition, later qualifying for a spot on the Olympic team destined for the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, where she participated in the 140-km women’s road race. She finished 32nd in a field of 66 competitors, having spent much of the race near or at the front of the peloton on a rain-soaked and crowded course. Hughes also placed an impressive fifth in the road time trial at the Olympics. She later revealed that she had been competing with the lingering effects of a back injury that she had incurred in a crash during the nationals in Gatineau, Québec, the previous May.\n\nSpeed skating\n\nHughes returned to her first love, speed skating, in 2000, after a break of 10 years. After training for only seven weeks, Hughes made the national speed skating team and qualified for three World Cup events in 2001. In November 2001 she placed fifth in the 5,000 meters at the World Cup in The Hague. Shortly after, in December 2001, she finished second in the 3,000 meters at the Olympic qualifying meet in Calgary. These accomplishments earned her a spot on the 2002 Canadian Olympic speed skating team.\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content.

Her bronze medal in the women’s 5,000-meters speed skating event made her the first Canadian athlete, and the fourth athlete since 1896 (joining Eddie Eagan of the United States, Jacob Tullin Thams of Norway, and Christa Luding-Rothenburger of East Germany), to win a medal in both the Olympic Summer Games and the Olympic Winter Games. At the Torino Winter Olympics in 2006, Hughes won gold in the 5,000 meters and silver in the team pursuit. She thus became the first Olympian to win more than one medal at both the Summer and Winter Games.\n\nDid You Know?\n\nClara Hughes is the only Canadian athlete to have won medals at both the Summer and Winter Olympics.\n\nIn 2010 Hughes was chosen by the Canadian Olympic Committee to carry Canada’s flag at the opening ceremony of the Vancouver Olympic Winter Games. She won bronze in the 5,000 meters, the last race of her speed skating career. Her sixth Olympic medal tied her with fellow speed skater Cindy Klassen for the most medals won by a Canadian athlete; that medal total was surpassed by Penny Oleksiak in 2021.\n\nActivism and advocacy\n\nIn addition to her record-setting athletic career, Hughes became well known for her advocacy and humanitarianism. She joined the Right to Play organization as an Athlete Ambassador in 2003, and in 2012 she became a member of its International Board of Directors. Not-for-profit initiatives that drew her support include the Nunavik Youth Hockey Development Program, Take a Hike (an alternative education program for at-risk youth), and the Axel Merckx Youth Development Foundation, which supports young cyclists in Canada. In 2010 Hughes became the national spokesperson for the Bell Let’s Talk campaign for mental health in Canada. Known almost as much for her smile and sunny disposition as for her athletic accomplishments, Hughes shared her struggle with depression in order to help the campaign’s stated goal of dispelling the stigma associated with mental illness and promoting dialogue about mental health.\n\nHonors and awards\n\nHughes received wide recognition for her contribution to sport. In 2006 she was awarded the International Olympic Committee’s Sport and the Community Award. Four years later she was inducted into Canada’s Sports Hall of Fame and received a star on Canada’s Walk of Fame. She also received honorary doctorates from the University of New Brunswick, University of Manitoba, and University of British Columbia. She was named an Officer of the Order of Canada and a Member of the Order of Manitoba. A number of places were named in her honor, including a park and community center in Winnipeg and Clara’s Climb (formerly Sydenham Hill) in Dundas, part of the city of Hamilton, Ontario, where Hughes trained for seven years.\n\nIn addition to these achievements, Hughes is an avid hiker, and she achieved the “triple crown” of long-distance hiking by completing the Pacific Crest Trail, Continental Divide Trail, and Appalachian Trail. Her memoir, Open Heart, Open Mind, in which she relates her struggles and triumphs, was published in 2017.\n\nRoch Pilon Tabitha Marshall The Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica\n\nThe original version of this entry was published by The Canadian Encyclopedia."
