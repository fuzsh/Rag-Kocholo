        "text": "December 8, 2021 (Los Angeles, CA) – Slamdance Film Festival, the premiere film festival and organization “by filmmakers, for filmmakers,” today announced the full lineup for its 28th edition hybrid festival. Known for challenging the status quo, Slamdance and its artist-led community have long held a reputation for discovering talent, often overlooked by the mainstream, that go on to change the entertainment industry. In 2022, the festival returns to its original home in Park City, Utah for its physical festival January 20-23, 2022, bridged with an accessible and robust program of virtual screenings, running January 20-30, 2022.\n\n“We are anti-algorithm. That’s always been true, but it’s more urgent than ever as we continue to celebrate truly unique voices that defy simple classification and transcend analytics,” said Slamdance President and co-founder Peter Baxter. “This year our programmers gravitated towards films that embody the true DIY spirit of guerrilla filmmaking and push the boundaries of what’s possible in storytelling. The Slamdance team is honored to introduce everyone of these storytellers, who are changing the media narrative and elevating the art form of independent film.”\n\nDedicated to fostering a community for independent emerging artists, the feature competition lineup boasts 23 premieres, including 13 World, 6 North American, and 4 U.S. debuts. Chosen from over 1,124 submissions, this year’s competition lineup hails from all corners of the globe, including Germany, Australia, Iran, Canada, China, Italy, Poland, and the UK among others. All competition films are feature-length, directorial debuts without U.S. distribution, with budgets of less than $1 million USD – a feature that has been unique to Slamdance since its founding in 1995. Photos of selected films are available here.\n\nAs always, all films in the lineup were selected by a team of Slamdance alumni via a blind submission process and are programmed democratically. This year it received 8,168 total submissions, of which 1,579 were features. Narrative Features, Documentary Features and Episodes sections are eligible for the Audience Award while all films and projects are eligible for the George Sparks Spirit of Slamdance Award and the AGBO Fellowship, the former of which is voted upon by filmmakers at the festival.\n\nThe prestigious AGBO Fellowship will continue in 2022. Founded by Slamdance alumni Anthony and Joe Russo (Avengers: Endgame, Avengers: Infinity War), the AGBO Fellowship provides a $25,000 cash prize, mentorship from the Russos and their team, and office space, enabling a filmmaker to continue honing their skills and pursuing their craft. The 2021 fellowship was awarded to Agnieszka Polska for her debut feature Hurrah, We Are Still Alive!\n\nIn addition to the competition films, Slamdance has also announced the selections for its 4th annual Breakouts section, featuring films by seasoned directors – nearly 50% of whom are alumni of the festival – who demonstrate a determined vision of filmmaking that is distinctly their own. These artists continue to push the boundaries of filmmaking, creating their own genres and forms, and Slamdance is proud to give them a platform to share their work with audiences all over the world.\n\nBuilding on the legacy it started last year, Slamdance has expanded the Unstoppable program. Now in its 2nd annual edition, this inclusive program showcases films by or about creators with visible and non-visible disabilities. Programmed exclusively by alumni who themselves have visible and non-visible disabilities, this program aims to eliminate the prejudices and gate-keeping that have historically kept disabilities from being represented in the entertainment industry. Launched last year with a series of short films, Slamdance Unstoppable is now including feature films in its 2022 program.\n\nThe festival is proud to announce a brand new addition to its unique storytelling program – Blockchain Fairy Tales (BFT). Presented by Columbia University’s Digital Storytelling Lab, BFT is an immersive storytelling experience that invites participants to step into an enchanted world powered by collaborative storytelling, play and world-building. Leveraging Blockchain Technology from the eco-conscious Tezos platform, this two-hour project subverts the current value system of cryptocurrency and uplifts shared community values, collectively questioning: what if happily ever after is not guaranteed? BFT is available both online and in-person in Park City, with participants able to see their collective ideas come to life on the silver screen and become part of a real blockchain ledger, allowing future participants to use these festival-created artifacts to continue the tale.\n\nAs always, Slamdance will have an exciting shorts program, showcasing more than 79 films from filmmakers around the world. Shorts in the Narrative, Documentary and Animation sections are eligible for the 2022 Oscar® Qualifying Shorts competition. And returning for its 3rd year is an Episodes category showcasing episodic work in any style, genre and format intended for broadcast.\n\nIn addition to showcasing the best in new filmmakers, Slamdance is also pleased to present DIG, a showcase of innovative digital, interactive, and gaming artwork. DIG provides a platform for independent artists who create out-of-the-box media to bring their ideas to life in novel and uncompromising ways. These pieces will be featured at Slamdance events and virtual spaces throughout 2022.2022 features programming includes:\n\nNARRATIVE FEATURES\n\nActual People – (USA) North American Premiere\n\nDirector/Screenwriter: Kit Zauhar; Producers: Kit Zauhar, Andrew Nadkarni, Jason Wang\n\nDuring her final week of college, Riley goes to great lengths to win the affections of a boy from her hometown of Philly, and ends up confronting her escalating anxieties about her love life, family, and future.\n\nCast: Kit Zauhar, Scott Albrecht, Audrey Kang, Vivian Zauhar, Henry Fulton Winship, Isabelle Barbier, Fraser Jones\n\nGoodafternoon Sweetdream – (South Korea) World Premiere\n\nDirector/Screenwriter: Bang Seung Hyeon\n\nFollowing her father’s death, Ye Won hangs out with her friends, but her mind is elsewhere.\n\nCast: Son Ye Won, Kim Woo Kyeom, Sung San Hee, Yang Min Ju, Bang Seung Hyeon\n\nHannah Ha Ha – (United States) World Premiere\n\nDirectors/Screenwriters: Jordan Tetewsky, Joshua Pikovsky; Producers: Roger Mancusi, Emily Freire\n\nA kind-hearted townie living with her aging father is pulled in different directions by her type-A older brother who returns closer to home and imposes his lifestyle choices on the family.\n\nCast: Hannah Lee Thompson, Roger Mancusi, Avram Tetewsky, Charlie Robinson, Jake Stern, Petr Favazza, Peter Cole, and Chuck Fazzio\n\nHoneycomb – (Canada) World Premiere\n\nDirector/Producer: Avalon Fast; Screenwriters: Avalon Fast, Emmett Roiko\n\nFive girls stray from society on the hunt for something more special…. you can find them if you follow the sound.\n\nCast: Rowan Wales, Sophie Bawks-Smith, Jillian Frank, Destini Stewart, Mari Geraghty, Jaris Wales, Henri Gillespi, Max Graham\n\nLove Tasting – (Poland) US Premiere\n\nDirector/Screenwriters: Dawid Nickel; Producer: Marta Habior\n\nA group of lost (and nowhere near found) high school friends are waiting by the pool for junior prom.

Though Slamdance has greatly evolved since the early years, its spirit remains the same. Slamdance is a community, a year-round experience, and a statement in which everyone is invited to take part. As an artist-led group Slamdance has been able to thrive working outside the system to create a disruptive co-operative run ”by filmmakers, for filmmakers.” Slamdance continues to discover and nurture diverse, international creators through new programs like Slamdance Unstoppable, which focuses on creators with visible and nonvisible disabilities, existing programs like the Screenplay Competition, DIG (digital, interactive and gaming), grants and mentorships, and of course, its namesake film festivals: Slamdance Joshua Tree, which took place September 24-26, 2021, Slamdance Miami, which takes place October 28-30, 2021, and the festival that started it all, Slamdance Film Festival, which will take place in Park City, Utah January 20-23 and online from January 20-30, 2022.\n\nSlamdance conducts business as a Non-Profit Organization under U.S. Internal Revenue Code Section 501(c)(3).\n\nFor more information on Slamdance, visit: https://slamdance.com\n\nFollow Slamdance on Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and Instagram\n\nAdditional References: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slamdance_Film_Festival\n\n#Slamdance2022\n\nPhotos/Images:\n\nSlamdance Logo\n\nFilm Stills\n\nPRESS CONTACT:"
