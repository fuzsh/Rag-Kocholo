        "text": "NASHVILLE, Tenn. (WSMV) - Just like athletes today, 100 years ago this week Americans were also heading to France to compete in the 1924 Paris Olympics. It was where the first person from Tennessee would take home gold.\n\n“Think about it all the Olympians from the United States, crossing the ocean, to go compete in the Paris Olympics 100 years ago,” John Noel III said.\n\nOne of those athletes was John Noel Sr., a man born and raised in Nashville who was representing the country in clay pigeon shooting. Known for being a great businessman he started the Noelle Hotel, previously called the Noel Hotel and did shooting as a hobby.\n\n“What it takes is a masterful amount of eye-hand coordination, as well as real focus. So he had the ability to do that. And then he also had the ability to win,” Noel III said.\n\nIn Paris, his team narrowly defeated the Canadians, bringing home Tennessee’s first-ever gold medal.\n\n“Winning the gold medal is a very remote quest and a very remote success if you can do it,” Noel III said.\n\nHis grandson says he never met his grandpa - but got to know him through what he left behind. The original gold medal, the rifle he used, the patch he wore, and his portrait are all being donated to the Tennessee State Museum.\n\n“To share it during this important centennial, put it on display, and really just introduce the story to individuals who haven’t heard it. That’s why the museum is here and something we take great pride in,” Museum Curator Matthew Gailani said.\n\nSo next week, when Noel III sits down to watch the Olympics, he sees a bit of himself in the history.\n\n“You watch someone go up on the podium to get that gold medal, a little something special that comes in through me because of my grandfather, realizing that he was there,” Noel III said.\n\nYou can see the items for yourself starting on July 30 here at the Tennessee State Museum."
