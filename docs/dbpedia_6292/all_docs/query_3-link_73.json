        "text": "In the last three Olympics the majority of U.S. medals were won by women despite fewer overall medal and participation opportunities. In the 2020 Tokyo games, 58.4% of medals won by U.S. women was their highest-ever percentage. 2024 is the first Olympics with an equal number of male and female participants. And so far, the US medal trend continues. It's taken awhile, but people are finally waking up to the fact that, yes, women's sports are exciting and worthy of coverage and investment on a large scale. It's taken an enormous burden of proof but here's hoping we continue to see a sharp upward trajectory in the growth of women's sports. https://lnkd.in/ehvsU7qy\n\nWith England reaching the sharp end of UEFA EURO 2024 (thank you, Jude) and Wimbledon starting this week, the back pages have been dominated by events in Germany and SW19. However, with the Opening Ceremony just over three weeks away, the #Paris2024 Olympics (and Paralympics thereafter) will soon take centre stage. Hosting the world’s largest multi-sport international event inevitably presents logistical and operational challenges, with some 10,500 athletes from over 200 nations due to compete across 32 Olympic sports (and circa 4,400 athletes in 22 Paralympic sports). When you throw in the existing geo-political climate, medical/environmental considerations and the pursuit of many athletes to reach the pinnacle of competition, it is inevitable that lawyers will be involved (to some extent). In this first article, I examine some of the key legal issues/controversies that have dominated the build-up to the Paris Games, including: ▶ The participation of Russian and Belarusian athletes; ▶ Athlete selection and qualification; ▶ Para-athlete classification; ▶ Transgender and DSD athletes; and ▶ The environmental impact and sustainability of the Games. In part 2, to follow, I will then consider some the contentious and regulatory issues that we might expect to arise once the 🏹Games formally get underway on 26 July. 🏹🤺🏋♂️🤸♀️🤼♂️🚴♂️🏇🏊♂️🤽♂️🚣♂️ ⛵🏄♂️⚽🏀🏉🏐⚾🎾🏓🏑🥊🥋⛳ #paris2024 #olympics #paralympics #sportslaw https://lnkd.in/epJpBkwW\n\nA Team Davie goal in recent years has been to take the kids to the Paris 2024 Olympics. Jon/Dad helped bring the Olympics to London, way-back-when. So this goal was meaningful to us. And this week we achieved it… We watched the football - men’s and women’s - and the women’s rugby sevens (Team Davie’s two favourite sports); We cheered for Iraq, Argentina, Columbia, New Zealand, South Africa, Japan, Australia, Ireland, France, USA… and, of course, for our very own Team GB; We travelled to Lyon, then to Paris, then back to Lyon. We took planes, trains, trams and the Metro, and we averaged 12km on foot each day, in 35 degree heat - a feat of endurance and, at times, one that tested our team spirit! We saw winners, losers, celebrated heroes and unsung ones: namely the 45,000 strong team of volunteers who welcome, chaperone and signpost the millions of fans from all over the world, the professionals, who work tirelessly for years to prepare the hosting cities for the biggest show on earth, and the fans themselves, who flock from the 206 competing countries to support the 10,714 sportsmen and women. The Olympics is astonishing: it is as audacious as it is inspiring. It teaches us what we can achieve when we dare and when we come together. It’s about competition on the field and collaboration and inclusion off. It’s about audacity, ambition, courage, determination, physical and mental strength, overcoming adversity, valour, heroism. It’s about individual and team spirit. It’s about setting goals, hard work, sacrifice and achievement. It showcases our global diversity *and* commonality. It demands the best of us individually, while giving us a deep sense of belonging. I wonder how we might extend, amplify and emulate the spirit of the Olympics in our teams, organisations, communities and teams? I know that I return to my work as an exec and leadership coach feeling inspired and invigorated to enable others to perform like our awe-inspiring Olympians. How are the Olympic Games inspiring you in your work? #Olympicgames #Paris2024 #Olympicspirit #inspiration\n\nAncient Olympics 1. Origins: The first recorded Olympic Games took place in 776 BCE in Olympia, Greece. These games were held in honor of Zeus, the king of the Greek gods. 2. Events: The ancient Olympics initially featured a single footrace but later expanded to include events such as wrestling, boxing, long jump, javelin, discus throw, and chariot racing. 3. Frequency: They were held every four years, a period known as an Olympiad. 4. Participants: Only freeborn Greek men were allowed to compete. Women were not permitted to participate or even attend. 5. Decline and End: The games continued for nearly 12 centuries until Emperor Theodosius I banned them in 393 CE as part of a campaign to promote Christianity. Modern Olympics 1. Revival: The modern Olympic Games were revived by Pierre de Coubertin in the late 19th century. The first modern Olympics were held in Athens in 1896. 2. Expansion: Initially featuring 14 nations and 43 events, the modern Olympics have grown significantly. The 2020 Tokyo Olympics featured over 200 nations and more than 300 events. 3. Summer and Winter Games: The Winter Olympics were introduced in 1924, featuring sports practiced on snow and ice. The Summer and Winter Games were held in the same year until 1994, when they were staggered to occur two years apart. 4. Inclusivity: Unlike the ancient games, the modern Olympics include female athletes and participants from all nations. The Paralympics, introduced in 1960, provide a platform for athletes with disabilities. 5. Contemporary Issues: The modern Olympics face challenges such as political boycotts, doping scandals, and the enormous cost of hosting the Games. #FORTHELOVEOFSPORT\n\nA Modest Proposal for the Inauguration of the Dunning-Kruger Olympics: Part 1 I thought of this as I read about the USA Men's Basketball Team's interaction with the US Ping Pong Team according to The Athletic. In a world brimming with experts of the highest caliber, individuals whose confidence in their own genius far outstrips any mundane acquaintance with reality, it has become clear to me that we are witnessing a golden age of intellect, if not always of wisdom. It is with this undeniable observation in mind that I, in the grand tradition of modest proposals, suggest the establishment of the \"Dunning-Kruger Olympics,\" a biennial celebration of the remarkable prowess of those who possess the rare gift of knowing more than everyone else—especially when they do not. The Dunning-Kruger Olympics, hereafter referred to as the DK Games, shall be the preeminent event for showcasing the talents of those whose self-assurance is inversely proportional to their knowledge. It is an arena where the champions of misunderstanding, miscalculation, and misinterpretation shall finally receive the recognition they so fervently believe they deserve. Conclusion In proposing these Games, I offer not just a sport, but a celebration—a tribute to the self-assured, the certain, the supremely confident in their own infallibility. For too long, the world has overlooked the contributions of these individuals, who, despite the odds and the evidence, remain convinced of their unparalleled genius. It is high time we rectify this oversight and elevate these champions of the Dunning-Kruger Effect to the pedestal they believe they deserve. Let us come together in a global display of misplaced confidence, and let the DK Games begin! See Part 2 for the events!\n\n#Paris2024 highlights at the halfway mark! 🥇 Athletic Excellence: Simone Biles stands unmatched – Whether with precious metal around her neck or on #SocialMedia. With 7.4 million engagement she dominates both social media and gymnastics, pushing it to be the most-discussed sport during the first half of the Olympics. 🥈 Focus on #Sustainability: Efforts to make the games more sustainable have been met with mixed reactions. Issues like the condition of the Seine River (54% negative sentiment) and the athletes' village (29% negative sentiment) have drawn criticism. 🥉 Sponsors in the Spotlight: Samsung Electronics tops the list of most visible sponsors by leaps and bounds, reaching over 270 billion people. Thanks to the innovative #marketing campaign the Galaxy Z Flip is setting the scene at award ceremonies. We share insights into what’s driving conversation during the first 9 days of the Olympics.

The Paris Games of 1924 fit historically in the window of five enormously significant Olympic Games sandwiched between the first and second World Wars- Antwerp 1920, Paris 1924, Amsterdam 1928, Los Angeles 1932 and Berlin 1936. That the Olympics simply returned in Antwerp in 1920, after WWI caused the cancelation of the 1916 Games is probably significant enough. No Olympic truce for us 20th Century types. Amsterdam saw women on the track for the first time, Los Angeles marked a return to America and all that LA symbolizes in Olympic history, and Berlin is the culmination of the Olympics and political and social spectacle as Jesse Owens defied Hitler's ideals on supremacy as sport was a surrogate for statecraft. It is in these \"sandwiched Games,\" the Olympics first began addressing the issues that defined the next one hundred years, gender, race, inclusion, opportunity and global politics of society not just sport. There is probably no better lens to see the modern Olympics coming of age than that of Paris 1924. Professional coaches, if not athletes. Yes, even tennis players like Rene Lacoste were amateurs, yes that Lacoste. It was the Olympics of Harold Abrahams and Eric Liddell made famous in \"Chariots of Fire,\" of Johnny Weissmuller and Duke Kahanamoku who remain famous even today anywhere there is water, and of Jackson Scholz and the incomparable Paavo Nurmi. 1924 was also the year that Coca-Cola began the longest continuously running sports sponsorship in history with the Olympics that will celebrate its centennial in Paris this year. These Games would mark Baron Pierre de Coubertin’s, the father of the revived Olympics, last as President of the IOC. The folks at The Atlantic have compiled an amazing photographic history of the 1924 Paris Games to help us get ready for the 2024 Paris Games. #Olympics, #HistoryofSports #GlobalSports #SportsSponsorship\n\nNext week I will finish my term as Deputy Chair of Channel 4 It has been a huge privilege to be associated with Channel 4 for all these years and, as the Paris Games approach, I wanted to celebrate #C4: #theParalympicBroadcaster. At LOCOG (London Organising Committee Of The Olympic & Paralympic Games) we wanted the #London2012 Games to create a new #Paralympic paradigm – we wanted to change hearts and minds and get the sport in front of hundreds of millions of new ‘Para’ fans. Doing the deal with Channel 4 was such a huge part of this. “We sold all the Paralympic tickets, we needed a massive moment to drive broadcasting audiences” Channel 4 got it. Their vision and the “Meet the Superhumans” campaign was spectacular. The ad is studied in schools (on the GCSE and A level curriculum) and 79% of people said they felt “more comfortable discussing disability” after seeing it. The Last Leg and Is it Ok.. was similarly groundbreaking. #Rio2016 took it on a stage when Channel 4’s coverage of the Rio Paralympics was watched by nearly half of the UK population. #Tokyo2020 was a difficult games but great coverage again by C4. And It has just been announced that Channel 4 Sport’s YouTube channel will broadcast every single televised moment of live sport from the #Paris2024 Paralympic Games… As Clare Balding says, \"it’s about how the games make you feel\". And as the Daily Mail put it, \"Channel 4's joie de vivre shines through its Paralympics coverage\" Channel 4: the Paralympic broadcaster. Sending a message to the world through #sport, a narrative of #inclusion, a tale of #empowerment and the legend that hope will always conquer fear. #Disability #Sports Alex Mahon Craig Spence Department for Culture, Media and Sport International Paralympic Committee ParalympicsGB Ofcom Creative Diversity Network (CDN) Paris 2024 - Comité d'organisation des Jeux Olympiques et Paralympiques de 2024"
