Through continual outreach visits across Texas combined with advanced technological infrastructure and multiple funding sources, TDNP has become a state and national leader in newspaper preservation. People who work with the Digital Newspaper Program range from university researchers to librarians, K-12 students and educators, lay historians, and genealogists.\n\nThe success of the Texas Digital Newspaper Program has been heavily supported by grants from the National Endowment for the Humanities' National Digital Newspaper Program, the Texas State Library and Archives Commission, and the Tocker Foundation."
