        "text": "Mandatory lawn watering restrictions specify the days when you may water. These days depend on whether you have an odd- or even-numbered address, and the time of year. Per County ordinance, the following restrictions apply to landscape irrigation regardless of whether the water comes from groundwater or surface water, from a private well or pump, or from a public or private utility:\n\nOutdoor irrigation is limited to one day a week during Eastern Standard Time (from the first Sunday in November until the second Sunday in March) and two days a week during Daylight Saving Time (from the second Sunday in March until the first Sunday in November).\n\nWater only if necessary and not between 10:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m.\n\nWater for no more than one hour per zone.\n\nTime of year Homes with\n\nodd-numbered or no addresses Homes with\n\neven-numbered addresses Nonresidential properties March 10 to\n\nNovember 2, 2024 Wednesday\n\nSaturday Thursday\n\nSunday Tuesday\n\nFriday November 3, 2024 to\n\nMarch 8, 2025 Saturday Sunday Tuesday\n\nFirst time violators will receive a warning through a door hanger notice and by letter.\n\nRepeat violators will be subject to a fine of $25 per violation. A violator can appeal to a Hearing Officer after a written request is submitted and a $25 filing fee is made. Failure to pay the fine or to contest the violation within 30 days will be considered an admission of liability and fines may be collected by any available legal means, including adding the fine to the water bill of the account holder. If you have questions regarding the mandatory watering restrictions, or need assistance resetting your irrigation controller, call the Water Division at (407) 254-9850.\n\nAll e-mail sent to this address becomes part of Orange County public record.
