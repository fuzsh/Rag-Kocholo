        "text": "The history of natural resource protection by the State of Texas is one of gradual evolution from protecting the right of access to natural resources (principally surface water) to a broader role in protecting public health and conserving natural resources for future generations of Texans.\n\nNatural resource programs were established in Texas at the turn of the 20th century, motivated initially by concerns over the management of water resources and water rights. In parallel with developments in the rest of the nation, and at the federal level, state natural-resource efforts broadened at mid-century to include the protection of air and water resources, and later to the regulation of generating hazardous and non-hazardous waste.\n\nDuring the 1990s, the Texas Legislature moved to make natural-resource protection more efficient by consolidating programs. This trend culminated in the creation of the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission in the fall of 1993 as a comprehensive environmental protection agency.\n\nSunset legislation passed by the Texas Legislature in 2001 continued the agency and changed its name to the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality. In 2011, sunset legislation continued TCEQ through 2023, and in 2023, sunset legislation continued TCEQ through 2035.\n\nList of TCEQ commissioners and executive directors, 1993 to the present\n\nTime Line\n\n1900s | 1910s | 1920s | 1930s | 1940s | 1950s | 1960s | 1970s | 1980s | 1990s | 2000s | 2010s |2020s\n\nThe major events in the history of the TCEQ are outlined below.

The legislation requires early public notice, encourages early public involvement, and requires substantive public comment and agency response. This legislation establishes criteria that would limit the scope of hearings by requiring referral of discrete issues that are in dispute and material to the decision of the commission. This process applies to permits issued by the agency under Chapters 26 and 27 of the Texas Water Code and Chapters 361 and 382 of the Health and Safety Code.\n\nBack to top\n\n2001\n\nThe agency is continued for 12 years under HB 2912, which changes the TNRCC's name to the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality by Jan. 1, 2004.\n\nThe legislature transfers responsibility for accreditation of environmental laboratories and certification of residential water treatment specialists from the Texas Department of Health to the TNRCC.\n\nThe Texas Environmental Health Institute is created by joint agreement between the TNRCC and the Texas Department of Health to identify health conditions related to living near a federal or state Superfund site.\n\nThe Texas Emissions Reduction Plan (TERP) is established by the legislature to be administered by the TNRCC, the comptroller, the Public Utility Commission of Texas, and the Texas Council on Environmental Technology.\n\n2002\n\nOn September 1, the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission formally changes its name and begins doing business as the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality.\n\nThe name change was required by our Sunset legislation, House Bill 2912. The Texas Legislature felt that the new name is shorter and gives people a better sense of the agency’s purpose. Plus, it’s more consistent with what other states call their environmental agencies.\n\nThe agency name change did not affect any previous permits, registrations, or any other paperwork or transactions between the public and the TNRCC earlier than Sept. 1, 2002. It also did not affect any signs or other postings required of businesses by this agency. All the powers, duties, rights, and obligations of the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission are the powers, duties, rights and obligations of the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality. (See the official notice in the Texas Register of March 30, 2002.)\n\nBack to top\n\n2003\n\nUnder HB 1365, the legislature provides a stable funding source for TERP program activities under the TCEQ and ends funding for TERP-related programs under the comptroller and the Public Utility Commission of Texas.\n\nThe legislature establishes a program for dry cleaning regulation and remediation at the TCEQ with the passage of HB 1366.\n\nThrough HB 1567, the legislature provides for the licensing of a facility for disposing of low-level radioactive waste and establishes procedures for the TCEQ to accept and assess license applications from businesses to dispose of such waste.\n\nIn the third called session, the legislature transfers the technology research and development program within the TERP from the Texas Council on Environmental Technology to the TCEQ.\n\nThe TCEQ implements the Permit Time-Frame Reduction Project, designed to shorten the time it takes to review major uncontested permits.\n\n2004\n\nThe TCEQ initiates the Environmental Monitoring and Response System, designed to improve the agency’s ability to measure environmental conditions in real time, notify the public of potential threats, and respond quickly and proactively.\n\n2005\n\nThe TCEQ undertakes comprehensive review and overhaul of the state’s regulations on municipal solid waste.\n\nThe commissioners direct TCEQ personnel to begin a comprehensive review, including extensive public involvement, of the agency’s enforcement process.\n\nThe legislature authorizes the Clean School Bus Program with passage of HB 3469.\n\n2006\n\nThe TCEQ reviews the extensive public comments on the agency’s enforcement process. The commissioners adopt a number of significant revisions to the process, including a pilot field-citation program, which begins on March 13.\n\nOn March 1, the TCEQ adopts major revision, streamlining, and improvement of state regulations on municipal solid waste.\n\nBack to top\n\n2007\n\nThe legislature passes SB 1604, which transfers regulatory authority from the Department of State Health Services (formerly the Texas Department of Health) to the TCEQ for commercial radioactive-waste processing, uranium mining, and by-product disposal.\n\nSB 1604 also addresses the process for TCEQ review of a pending application submitted to the DSHS for a by-product disposal facility proposed for Andrews County.\n\nIn addition, SB 1604 addresses the TCEQ’s underground injection-control program for regulation of in situ uranium mining and requires the TCEQ to administer a new state fee for the disposal of radioactive wastes other than low-level radioactive waste.\n\nSB 1436 transfers the responsibility for the National Floodplain Insurance Program from the TCEQ to the Texas Water Development Board.\n\nPassage of SB 12 extends the Texas Emissions Reduction Plan through August 2013.
