        "text": "If freezing rain and/or snow is predicted, Meals on Wheels will make a collective decision by 11:00 p.m. on whether they believe it is best to cancel meal delivery for the next day.\n\nClients who have opted in for text message notifications from VNA will receive a text notifying them of cancellations. Additionally, notification is given to appropriate news and radio stations for a public service announcement of the meal program closure. We will also post closings on our Facebook and Instagram pages and Twitter feed.\n\nDelivery will resume the following business day unless inclement weather continues. Clients are encouraged to eat one of their shelf stable meals when these situations arise.\n\nClients who have opted in for text message notifications from VNA will receive text messages related to a variety of updates and resources. Additionally, Meals on Wheels staff may contact clients for reassessment of program needs, various surveys and to provide other resources.\n\nOur volunteers will provide you with important updates and information as needed with your meal delivery service each day. Updates are also always available online on our website and through our social media channels including Facebook and Instagram pages and Twitter feed.\n\nIf you need assistance, you may always contact our team at the office by phone or email.\n\nPhone: (214) 689-2639\n\nEmail: gethelp@vnatexas.org\n\nThe VNA Meals on Wheels team is happy to assist you with any questions or to address any issues with your meal delivery service.

Fees for the service are supported by government and private sources.\n\nIf a client would like to sign up for a self-pay option, the fee is $6 per meal and the client may choose the number of meals he/she would like to receive each week.\n\nVNA complies with all statutes, guidelines, laws, standards and regulations regarding food service and senior meals. As a food service provider, VNA is routinely audited and inspected by the Texas Health and Human Services Commission, Dallas Area Agency on Aging, Texas Department of Agriculture, Community Health Accreditation Program, and the City of Dallas Health and Environmental Services. VNA has a comprehensive program of monitors and controls to assure that the food products and prepared foods are handled appropriately from the time it arrives from the prime vendor to the unit, to delivering the meal to the participant.\n\nYes.

The easiest way to donate is through our Amazon Wish List which ships directly to VNA.\n\nIf you would like to donate, you may drop off your donation Monday – Friday from 9:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. at:\n\nVNA Haggerty Center\n\n1440 W. Mockingbird Lane, Dallas, TX 75247\n\nSince 1934, the purpose of the Visiting Nurse Association of Texas (VNA) has been to provide the highest quality care in the home across North Texas, especially for those with no place to turn and no means to pay.\n\nVNA was chartered as a nonprofit organization to address the desperate need for home health care in the midst of the Depression.\n\nSince that time, VNA has added additional services including Meals on Wheels, Hospice Care, and Palliative Care to ensure the homebound, elderly and disabled in our community are cared for expertly and with compassion.\n\nThe Meals on Wheels Program in Dallas was organized in 1957 as a pilot project by the Women’s Council of Dallas County. It was one of the first Meals on Wheels programs in the United States. In 1973, VNA agreed to take over the service, viewing the Meals on Wheels program as a logical extension and advancement of the agency’s mission."
