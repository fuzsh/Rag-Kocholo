Although state law already declared restrictions and provisions in real property records that prohibit the use, sale or transfer of real property to a person based on race, color, religion, or national origin to be void and unenforceable, Senate Bill 30, which took effect on September 1, 2021, establishes a process for a property owner, or another person that the owner authorizes, to request a judicial review of specific property records to determine whether they contain prohibited discriminatory provisions.\n\nThe bill sets out the contents of the documents required to be submitted to the court as well as a suggested format for the court’s findings and order. Under certain circumstances, the court may issue its determination without conducting a hearing. No filing fees may be charged under the statute.\n\nTo view the language of the bill and the format for filing with the court as well as the format for the court’s findings and order, use the link: 87(R) SB 30 - Enrolled version (texas.gov)\n\nINFORMATION ON eRECORDING DEEDS AND OTHER OFFICIAL RECORDS AND DOCUMENTS:\n\nCSC eRECORDING\n\n866-652-0111\n\nwww.erecording.com\n\nSIMPLIFILE\n\n800-460-5657\n\nsimplifile.com\n\nePN (eRecording Partners Network)\n\n888-325-3365\n\nwww.goepn.com\n\nINFORMATION ON E-FILING COURT CASE DOCUMENTS:\n\nState law requires the use of e-Filing for all Civil Cases and many Criminal Case filings.\n\nFor E-Filing Assistance, please go to: EfileTexas.gov\n\nThe new Odyssey court case management system is now available.
