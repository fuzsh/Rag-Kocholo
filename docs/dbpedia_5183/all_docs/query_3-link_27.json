        "text": "The New York State Board of Elections has issued a press release advising that individuals throughout New York State have been going door to door impersonating County Board of Elections staff and confronting voters regarding their registration status and erroneously accusing them of wrongdoing because of how they appear in the state voter database.\n\nhttps://www.elections.ny.gov/NYSBOE/news/2023CBOEImpersonation.pdf\n\nThe Suffolk Board is aware of one incident in Suffolk County in which individuals posing as Board of Elections staff sought to verify a voter’s identity and requested to see the voter’s driver’s license which was smartly declined.\n\nThe Suffolk County Board of Elections staff is not visiting voters’ homes to verify their registration and is not going door to door to request proof of identification. Should anyone appear at a residence and claim that they are a Suffolk County Board of Elections’ employee or official, please request identification and then notify the Suffolk County Board of Elections at 631-852-4500 immediately. If you obtain a photograph or video of the individual through security devices, please forward such photograph or video to the Board for forwarding to appropriate law enforcement. Do not provide any personal information.\n\nCriminal impersonation is a crime as is voter intimidation."
