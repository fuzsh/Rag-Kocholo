What is the last day that I can pay my property tax bill without penalty and interest?\n\nProperty Tax payments are due by January 31st in order to be considered timely.\n\nThe only exception to this rule is when the last day of the month is a Harris County holiday or falls on a weekend.\n\nIn that case, then the next business day (or first business day in February) is honored as timely for receipt of payment.\n\nThe extended due date also applies to:\n\nthe date of USPS postmark\n\nreceipt mark from a contract carrier (such as UPS or FedEx)\n\ntransaction date of Harris County Tax Office online payment portal\n\ntransaction date of telephone payment\n\nQ. Where can I pay my property taxes?\n\nYou may pay by cash, check, or credit card at any of our branch office locations throughout Harris County.\n\nPayments by check or money order can be made payable to Ann Harris Bennett , and if possible, include the coupon from your tax statement in the envelope (or write your account number on your check) mailed to:\n\nAnn Harris Bennett, Tax Assessor-Collector\n\nP.O. Box 4622\n\nHouston, Texas 77210-4622\n\nOnline and phone credit card or e-check payments are also accepted (see below for more information).\n\nQ. Why do I make checks payable to Ann Harris Bennett?\n\nThe County Tax Assessor-Collector is an office created by the Texas Constitution. Under the Constitution’s provisions, the Assessor-Collector is personally liable for the funds collected and deposited in separate bank accounts under his control. The Assessor-Collector is relieved of this responsibility and liability when he deposits the funds with the County Treasurer.\n\nQ. Can I pay my property taxes online?\n\nYes. The Tax Office accepts full or partial payment of property taxes online. Property taxpayers may also use any combination of credit cards and/or e-Checks for payment. We accept American Express, Discover, MasterCard, and Visa credit/debit card.\n\nA non-refundable surcharge of 2.45% ($1.00 minimum) will be added to each credit card transaction. E-checks are free.\n\nQ. Can I pay my property taxes by telephone?\n\nYes. The Tax Office accepts full or partial payment of property taxes by touch-tone telephone by calling 713-274-CARD (2273) from any place in the world, seven days a week. Property taxpayers may also use any combination of credit cards and/or e-Checks for payment. We accept American Express, Discover, MasterCard, and Visa credit/debit card.\n\nA non-refundable surcharge of 2.45% ($1.00 minimum) will be added to each credit card transaction. E-checks are free.\n\nQ. Our company no longer prints checks; can the Tax Office accept electronic payments?\n\nThe Tax Office accepts ACH payments from large taxpayers who participate in our mortgage company/large payer program. A single payment can be used to pay up to 50 accounts. However, the Tax Office does not process electronic payments for fewer than five accounts from one taxpayer. Please send inquiries about this program to:\n\nAnn Harris Bennett, Tax Assessor-Collector\n\nAttn: Mortgage Company Processor\n\n1001 Preston, Suite 310\n\nHouston, TX 77002\n\nWe strongly encourage taxpayers paying individual accounts to use our on-line payment functions. All on-line payments can be made with E-checks, Visa, MasterCard, Discover or American Express. All other credit and debit cards incur a fee of 2.45% ($1.00 minimum) of the amount paid. E-checks are free.\n\nQ. Can I pay my current taxes before paying my delinquent taxes?\n\nPayments made by mail, credit card, or over the phone are applied to the current taxes first.\n\nQ. Can I make monthly payments on my current taxes?\n\nYes. For real property you can make monthly payments through June but you will have to pay penalty and interest starting February 1. If you still have a balance at the end of June, you can enter into an installment agreement with our office at that time to pay any remaining balance plus penalty and interest over the next six months. While you won't avoid paying penalty and interest under this plan, you will avoid the additional collection fee of 15% to 20% on the outstanding balance by signing the installment agreement in June and making the payments on time.\n\nInstallment agreements are only available through April 1 for business personal property accounts that have been noticed in February. After April 1 the additional 15% to 20% collection fee will apply to these accounts.\n\nQ. Can I make monthly payments on my delinquent taxes?\n\nYes, but payment arrangements will have to be made through the delinquent tax law firm.\n\nQ. Why do I have to pay penalty and interest when I never received a bill?\n\nAs a property owner, it is your responsibility to make sure that you receive a bill and that it is paid on time. The statements are mailed and the taxes are due at the same time each year. If you have not received a bill by the middle of December, you should call and request that another one be mailed to you. You are also able to call and get an amount due over the phone as early as October or look up your account on the website www.hctax.net. It is not necessary to have a statement to make payment as long as you have your account number and know the correct amount. You can either mail or take your payment to any Harris County Tax office location.\n\nQ. I was granted an exemption on my account. Can the refund be mailed directly to me?\n\nYes, the refund check will be mailed directly to the name and address on the tax roll at the time the tax was paid. If there is a change of ownership, tax agent or litigation on the account, however, please contact our office.\n\nQ. The mortgage company paid my current taxes. I failed to claim the homestead. How do I get a refund?\n\nFirst, apply to HCAD for the exemption. We will send an application for the homestead exemption, or you may obtain the form directly from HCAD online at www.hcad.org/ or by calling 713-957-7800. Once the exemption is approved by HCAD, the refund will be processed directly to the name and address on the tax roll. If there is a name change, the refund will be issued to the owner of record on the tax roll at the time the tax was paid.\n\nQ. I received a bill for personal property taxes, but I do not own any real estate; I just lease it for my business. Why am I receiving a bill on property I do not own? Should the property owner be paying this?\n\nAll businesses are taxed on their personal property, such as furniture, fixtures, machinery, equipment, inventory and vehicles. Most likely, the bill that you received is for your business personal property and not for the real estate itself. The real estate is taxed separately and the tax statement sent to the property owner.\n\nEChecks\n\nQ.

A lawsuit for tax lien foreclosure can be filed and a judgment subsequently granted by the court. The attorneys, with the approval of the Harris County Tax Assessor-Collector’s Office, can then proceed with Tax Sale procedures.\n\nQ. Who holds the Tax Sale?\n\nTax Sales are held by the eight Harris County Constables who are responsible for holding sales of property with delinquent taxes within their respective precincts.\n\nTypes of Auctions and Sales\n\nQ. What is the difference between a Tax, Trustee, and Execution Auction?\n\nExecution Auction:\n\nThe Constable conducts the sale pursuant to a court order on behalf of a private plaintiff.\n\nThe property is being sold for reasons other than delinquent property taxes.\n\nThe property will be listed in the Daily Court Review and other foreclosure publication services.\n\nTax Auction:\n\nThe Constable conducts the sale on behalf of the taxing entities.\n\nThe property is being foreclosed on for delinquent property taxes.\n\nThe property will be listed in the Daily Court Review and other foreclosure publication services.\n\nTrustee Auction:\n\nThe Trustee conducts the sale on behalf of a lender.\n\nTrustee auctions, while held at the same time and place as delinquent Tax Auctions, are not\n\nconducted by Harris County. Trustees are hired by the lienholder to legally foreclose on\n\nthe mortgagor/debtor.\n\nQ. How do I know if a property will be offered in the Tax Auction or the Trustee Auction?\n\nA property will be offered for sale by a Constable at a Tax Auction if there are delinquent property taxes owed that were taken to judgment.\n\nA property will be offered for sale by a Trustee at a Trustee Auction if the Trustee (represents lienholder) forecloses on a deed of trust.\n\nNote: You do not need to register with the Harris County Tax Assessor-Collector’s Office to bid at the Trustee Auction. You may, however, need to register with the trustee.\n\nQ. What is the difference between a sale and a resale?\n\nA sale is for a property that is being offered for the first time. When a property does not receive at least the minimum bid at a first Tax Sale, it may be “struck off” to the taxing entity that initiated the sale. A new deed is filed, reflecting the change in ownership to the posting jurisdiction. Usually, the property is posted for resale at a later date.\n\nDate, Time and Location\n\nQ.

However, the property location can be determined by researching the account details available from the Harris Central Appraisal District at: www.hcad.org.\n\nQ. Why was a property sale canceled?\n\nA property can be canceled for a number of reasons, the most common of which is that the delinquent taxes have been paid. If a property has been canceled, it will not be offered for sale at auction, but could come up at a later date if it was canceled for another reason other than paid.\n\nQ. Can a property be canceled on the day of the auction?\n\nYes. A property can be canceled at any time before it comes up for auction.\n\nPurchasing Property\n\nBidding\n\nQ. How is the minimum bid determined?\n\nIn order to purchase Tax Sale property at a first sale, the bidder must pay at least the statutory minimum bid, which is set at the lower of:\n\njudgment value – value of the property at the time the judgment is taken\n\nthe total of all amounts awarded in the judgment, including costs of suit and sale\n\nThe minimum bid is determined prior to the sale by the Constable and is announced at the sale. If taxes have accrued on the property for years after the date of the foreclosure judgment (“post-judgment taxes”), the Tax Sale purchaser is responsible for those taxes. Post-judgment taxes are paid at the Tax Assessor-Collector’s Office – not at the post-judgment sale.\n\nQ. What if no minimum bid is received at the Tax Sale?\n\nIf no minimum bid is offered, the property will be struck-off to the posting jurisdiction and sold at a later date. Harris County properties may be offered at a later Constable sale for a lower minimum bid.\n\nQ. How do I bid on a property?\n\nOnce you have registered with the Harris County Tax Assessor’s Office and obtained a bidder card, you are eligible to bid by raising your card in plain sight for the Constable to see at a certain bid price.\n\nQ. Can I bid on multiple properties?\n\nYes\n\nQ. Can I bid in multiple precincts?\n\nYes\n\nBuying\n\nQ. What does it mean to purchase the property “as is”?\n\nIn Harris County, and in the State of Texas, the taxing units have no liability or responsibility for the condition of the properties or the title of the properties that are posted for public sale. The successful bidder purchases the property “as is;” meaning that each purchaser is responsible to do their own\n\ninvestigation of the properties being offered for sale, both as to the physical condition of the property, as well as any title issues, etc.\n\nThe property is subject to any other liens or encumbrances that are not cleared from the sale of the property. This may include other tax liens and judgments not included in the sale. There are no expressed or\n\nimplied warranties. The purchaser has no recourse against the taxing jurisdiction(s).\n\nQ. How and when do you pay for property that is purchased at a Tax Sale?\n\nYou must pay for the property at the time of sale. Only cash or certified funds (cashier’s checks) are accepted. Certified checks should be made payable to the selling Constable precinct. Alternatively, certified checks may be made payable to the buyer, and then endorsed over to the selling Constable precinct.\n\nQ. Can I go to the bank for money and come back to pay?\n\nNo. You must pay for the property at the time of sale. The County may pursue legal actions for non-payment or rescission of a winning bid.\n\nQ. What type of document is issued when I purchase a property?\n\nA receipt will be issued on the day of the sale. The successful bidder on a property will be issued a Constable’s Deed within 4 to 6 weeks after the auction date. The name indicated below the Registrant’s Name on your bidder card will be the name appearing on the new Constable’s Deed.\n\nQ. Will I be refunded any amount I pay over the winning bid amount?\n\nYes. If the payment is more than the winning bid, the Constable’s Office will issue a refund for the difference. The refund will be made at a later date.\n\nQ. Can I return the property I purchased at auction?\n\nThe officers who conduct Tax Sales regard all sales as final and not subject to rescission due to mistake or dissatisfaction with the property. The County may pursue damages against a bidder who rescinds on a purchase.\n\nQ. Can the former owner get the property back after it is purchased?\n\nMost properties sold at the Harris County Delinquent Tax Sale are subject to the defendant’s right of redemption – 2 years for residence homestead and 180 days for non-homesteaded properties.\n\nQ. I received my tax statement and it does not show my exemption?\n\nIf you have recently submitted your exemption application, please allow the Harris County Appraisal District several months to process the exemption request. Once the exemption is approved by the Appraisal District, the Tax Office would receive the updated records for its next billing processing. If your account qualifies for a refund due to the exemption, the Tax Office will process and mail the refund to the property owner after the correction roll is certified to our office. You do not need to submit the refund request.\n\nQ. We are over 65 and pay no taxes. We received a statement showing a emergency service district tax. Why?\n\nEmergency service districts were created by the state legislature and approved by the voters of the various districts. They have the legal authority to set a tax rate and may not allow exemptions. These exemptions are not mandatory, and they do not have to grant them. If no exemption is allowed, you are liable for the tax. There is a maximum allowable exemption, and if the value is higher than the exemption, the value above the exemption is taxable.\n\nQ. I received a homestead exemption for the current year, but I sold the property. How can I correct this matter?\n\nIf you have sold your property, or you own but no longer occupy the property as your primary residence, you can notify the appraisal district to update the ownership record or exemption status of the property. The forms are available at www.hcad.org.\n\nQ. What are the types of Homestead Exemptions?\n\nGeneral Residence Homestead Exemptions: You may apply the residence homestead exemptions to one property in a tax year. To qualify for a homestead exemption, you must own and use the property as your primary residence. Your diver's license or state issued ID must show the same property address for which you are applying the homestead exemption. Contact the appraisal district or www.hcad.org for the homestead application form and the required qualifications.\n\nOver-65 or Disability Exemptions: You may receive an over-65 or disability homestead exemption immediately upon qualification for the exemption. If you have not provided your birth date on this application, you must apply before the first anniversary of your qualification date to receive the exemption in that tax year. For example, if you turn 65 or are disabled on June 1 of the current year, you have until May 31 of the next year to apply for the current tax year’s over-65 or disability exemption. This special provision only applies to an over-65 or disability exemption and not to other exemptions for which you may apply.\n\nDisability Exemptions. You are entitled to the exemption if you meet the Social Security Administration's tests for disability. In simplest terms: 1) You must have a medically determinable physical or mental impairment; 2) The impairment must prevent you from engaging in any substantial gainful activity; and 3) The impairment must be expected to last for at least 12 continuous months or to result in death. Alternatively, you will qualify if you are 55 or older and blind and cannot engage in your previous work because of your blindness. To verify your eligibility, attach a copy of your disability determination letter from Social Security (or other recognized retirement system), or have your physician complete and mail us the HCAD form titled Physician's Statement Verifying Eligibility for Disability Homestead Exemption.\n\nTax Limitations: The over-65 or disability exemption for school taxes includes a school tax limitation, or ceiling. Other types of taxing units – county, city, or junior college – have the option to grant a tax limitation on homesteads of homeowners who are disabled or 65 years of age or older.\n\n100% Disabled Veterans: Certain disabled veterans are eligible for 100% exemptions for their residence homesteads. Current documentation from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) must be submitted to prove that the veteran receives full VA compensation and is either rated at 100% disabled or has a determination of un-employability from the VA.\n\nSurviving Spouse Age 55 or Older: Age 65 or older – You qualify for an extension of this exemption if (1) you are 55 years of age or older on the date your spouse died and (2) your deceased spouse was receiving the over-65 exemption on this residence homestead or would have applied and qualified for the exemption in the year of the spouse’s death. You will not receive the school tax limitation for the over-65 exemption unless your spouse died on or after December 1, 1987\n\nDisabled: You will not qualify for a disability exemption claimed by your deceased spouse. You are not entitled to continue the school tax limitation; however, you will be entitled to continue the local option county, city or junior college limitation.\n\nSurviving Spouse Age 55 or Older: If your deceased spouse was receiving or qualified for the over-65 exemption at death, you may be entitled to receive the exemption, as well as the school tax ceiling if you were 55 years of age or older on the date of your spouse's death. If your deceased spouse received the disability exemption and not the over-65 exemption, you may be eligible for continuation of a tax ceiling granted by a city, county, or junior college, but you are not eligible for the disability exemption or the school tax ceiling.\n\nFor more details, please refer to the Exemptions website of Glenn Hegar, Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts.\n\nQ. If I pay my property taxes to the Harris County Tax Office, why do I have to file my Homestead Exemption with the Harris Central Appraisal District?\n\nThe Harris Central Appraisal District (HCAD) sets the taxable value of your property each year. Homestead exemptions affect the value of your property and must be approved by the Harris Central Appraisal District. The Harris County Tax Office (HCTAX) only collects property tax and does not determine the value of the property or the tax amount owed\n\nPlease refer to the Guide to Understanding The Property Tax Process prepared by the Harris Central Appraisal District for additional information.\n\nTo obtain a Homestead Exemption, please submit the completed APPLICATION FOR RESIDENTIAL HOMESTEAD EXEMPTION (Form 11.13) and submit it directly to the Harris Central Appraisal District.\n\nHarris Central Appraisal District CONTACT INFORMATION\n\nOFFICE LOCATION:\n\n13013 Northwest Freeway\n\nHouston, Texas 77040-6305\n\nMAILING ADDRESS:\n\nP.O.

I am a totally (100%) disabled veteran, how do I receive the 100% exemption on my property taxes?\n\nStarting in Tax Year 2009 qualifying veterans are eligible for a 100% exemption on their homestead. Please contact HCAD by calling 713-957-7800 for the application and required documentation.\n\nQ. I paid off my house and my mortgage company will not be paying my taxes this year. How do I make sure that I receive my tax statement? When are the statements mailed out and when are taxes due?\n\nAs long as a statement is not requested by a mortgage company, it is automatically mailed to the current certified owner of record per the Harris Central Appraisal District. The majority of statements are mailed out during November of each year. If you have not received your statement by mid-December, it is your responsibility to notify us so that we can send out another statement. Taxes are due upon receipt of the statement, and should be paid no later than January 31st of the year following the year the tax was incurred.\n\nQ. This is not my property. What shall I do with this statement?\n\nIf you know the name of the owner, please return the statement to this office with the name of the owner. If you do not know the name of the owner, return the statement with that notation.\n\nQ. The name and address on this statement are incorrect. How can I get it changed?\n\nThe Harris Central Appraisal District is responsible for determining each property owner's name and address. We can send you a name and address correction form, and then you forward it to the Harris Central Appraisal District, Customer Service Division, P.O. Box 922010, Houston, TX 77292-2010. If it is more convenient, you can get the form directly from HCAD by calling 713-957-7800, or download the real property correction form or personal property correction form directly from our website.\n\nQ. What is a tax account number and what do you mean by a \"legal description\"?\n\nThe tax account number is assigned by the Harris Central Appraisal District and is used to help identify each piece of property. Normally, only one account number is assigned to each parcel. The legal description describes the property as a parcel in a larger tract (e.g., Lot 1, Block 2 in Meadow Subdivision), so it can be located on a map. If the legal description is wrong on your statement, this error should be directed to the Harris Central Appraisal District for proper handling. If you so request, we will send the necessary real property correction form or personal property correction form to you, or you may obtain them directly from HCAD by calling 713-957-7800.\n\nQ. How do I receive my tax bill electronically?\n\nThe Tax Office provides taxpayers the opportunity to receive an electronic version of their tax statement as authorized by HB 843, passed in 2011.\n\nTaxpayers can sign up to use this service by using the unique e-Bill code on their prior tax year bill. The use of the unique e-bill code is designed to provide Harris County taxpayers with some assurance that another individual cannot re-direct their tax statement.\n\nQ. Can you send me a statement on my taxes for part of the year?\n\nThe Harris County Tax Office does not prorate taxes; the tax bill must reflect the full amount owed.\n\nQ. Why am I getting a delinquent tax bill on a parcel I just purchased?\n\nThe tax laws require this office to mail delinquent tax bills to the current owner of real estate, rather than to the previous owner. Because a tax lien exists against that parcel, it is in the current owner's best interest to have knowledge of that lien. If a lawsuit were filed to foreclose the lien, the current owner (not the previous owner) risks losing the property to foreclosure.\n\nQ. What is a tax deferral?\n\nA deferral allows eligible taxpayers to postpone payment of property taxes on their residence homestead for as long as they own and live on the property.\n\nQ. Who is eligible for a tax deferral?\n\nTaxpayers who are age 65 or older, as well as those who are disabled, may obtain a tax deferral on their residence homestead. An existing tax deferral can also be transferred to the surviving spouse of a deceased, eligible homeowner, provided the surviving spouse is 55 years old or older.\n\nQ. Does the tax deferral cover only my Harris County taxes? What about my school (or other) taxes?\n\nThe tax deferral applies to ALL taxes owed for the property for as long as the tax deferral is in force.\n\nQ. Does my mortgage company have to honor a tax deferral?\n\nMost mortgage companies have language in their contracts requiring payment of taxes in full each year. Check with your mortgage company to determine if they will honor a tax deferral on your homestead.\n\nQ. How do I apply for a tax deferral?\n\nThe Over-65 or Disabled Tax Deferral Affidavit form 33-06_fill.pdf can be found at www.hcad.org. Complete and return the form to the Harris Central Appraisal District (HCAD).\n\nQ. When does a deferral begin?\n\nOnce you have completed and filed the deferral affidavit, HCAD will process and grant the deferral. Each affected jurisdiction will subsequently be notified that a tax deferral has been granted.\n\nQ. Can I make payments while under the deferral?\n\nYes. You may wish to have a tax deferral in force simply to protect your property, but continue to make payments.\n\nIf payment is made before taxes become delinquent, no penalty or interest will be assessed.\n\nAny delinquent payments made while the deferral is in force will be assessed a maximum of 5% interest for each year the amount has been delinquent.\n\nQ. Does my surviving spouse qualify to keep the deferral?\n\nYes. A surviving spouse, age 55 or older, can contact the Harris Central Appraisal District to request that the deferral be continued.\n\nQ. How long does my deferral last?\n\nA deferral remains in force until one of the following occurs:\n\nthe owner requests removal of the deferral\n\nthe owner no longer qualifies for a homestead exemption\n\nthe owner is deceased and does not have a surviving spouse, aged 55 or older, to continue the deferral.\n\nQ. Do deferred taxes accrue penalty and interest?\n\nThere is no penalty assessed on the taxes while under the tax deferral. Interest is assessed at a rate of 5% per year for each year that taxes remain delinquent under the deferral.\n\nQ. What if I already have delinquent taxes when I obtain the tax deferral?\n\nOnce you obtain a deferral on your account, the delinquent amount owed, plus any penalty, interest or attorney fees that have accrued, will be protected under the deferral. No additional penalty will be charged, no legal action can be taken and no tax sale can occur during the deferral period. A maximum of 5% interest per year, however, will be added for each year the taxes are delinquent. Once the deferral ends, you must pay the total amount due within 180 days in order to avoid further penalty, interest or legal action.\n\nQ. What if I have a lawsuit or a judgment on my property? How does the tax deferral affect that?\n\nDuring the deferral period, taxes continue to be assessed, but no collection action can be taken against the property. The deferral, however, does not dismiss, but only suspends any collection efforts/lawsuits. If the total due is not paid within the 180 days after the tax deferral ends, then legal action can resume at the point at which it left off, prior to the deferral.\n\nQ. How are my taxes calculated, once the deferral ends?\n\nAs soon as the deferral ends, all taxes, plus any pre-deferral penalty and interest and the 5% deferred interest per year become due.\n\nIf paid within 180 days after the deferral ends a flat 5% interest per year for each year of the deferral will be added to the tax amount owed. The tax amount owed includes any taxes that were delinquent prior to the deferral, plus any penalty, interest and attorney fees incurred on the delinquency, prior to the deferral. It also includes any subsequent taxes that were assessed during the deferral period.\n\nBeginning on the 181st day, any unpaid delinquent balance will be subject to regular penalty and interest, plus attorney fees until paid in full. If the delinquent amount continues to remain unpaid, the account may also face legal collection action by a law firm.\n\nInstallment Payment Plans for Delinquent Accounts\n\nQ. What types of installment plans are available for payment of delinquent taxes?\n\nHomestead Installment Payment Agreements are only available to those who have a homestead exemption on the account.\n\nAgreements will include all delinquent taxes for both current and prior years.\n\nAccounts may qualify even with a lawsuit, bankruptcy or pending tax sale.\n\nOnce the agreement is in force, no additional penalty will be assessed, however 1% interest will accrue each month until the account is paid in full.\n\nIf you defaulted on a previous homestead agreement, you must either pay the amount due or wait 24 months before entering into a new agreement.\n\nHomestead Installment Payment Agreements are available to accounts which are not your homestead property.\n\nThe agreement may be for current year delinquent taxes ONLY.\n\nAll prior year taxes must be paid before entering into an agreement for current year taxes.\n\nAccounts with a lawsuit or bankruptcy do NOT qualify.\n\nOnce the agreement is in force, penalty and interest will continue to accrue each month until the account is paid in full, but attorney fees will not apply.\n\nIf you defaulted on an earlier agreement, you may pay off the balance in full before entering into a new agreement.\n\nNo active agreement may exist on the account. The term for most agreements is 12 months.\n\nQ. What is the benefit of entering into a payment agreement for delinquent taxes?\n\nDelinquent accounts incur monthly penalty and interest charges on any unpaid balance due on the account. If the account remains delinquent, it will be referred to a law firm for collection, at which time an additional attorney’s collection fee of 15-20% will be assessed as follows:\n\non Business Personal Property, beginning on the second business day in April\n\non Real Property, beginning on the first business day in July\n\nIf you enter into a payment agreement, the account will not be referred to a law firm for collection and the additional attorney’s collection fee of 15-20% will not be assessed, provided your plan begins before the deadline date above and:\n\nall monthly payments are made in a timely manner\n\nthe balance is paid off by the date specified in the terms of your agreement\n\nPLEASE NOTE that penalty and/or interest charges will still continue to accrue as follows on any unpaid balance on the account during the term of the agreement:\n\nHomestead Installment Payment Agreements will accrue 1% penalty each month.\n\nInstallment Payment Agreements accrue both penalty and interest each month until paid in full.\n\nQ. When are payment agreements for delinquent taxes available?\n\nOnce taxes become delinquent, you may enter into a Homestead Installment Payment Agreement at any time.\n\nInstallment Payment Agreements become available the first business day in February for current year delinquent taxes. The deadline for entering into an agreement is:\n\nApril 1st for Business Personal Property accounts\n\nJune 30th for Real Property accounts\n\nQ. How do I contact you to set up a payment agreement for my delinquent taxes?\n\nYou may do so online, by giving us your information in the Enter Account Number box provided on this page, or contacting the Tax Office by:\n\nemail (tax.office@hctx.net)\n\nphone at 713-274-8000\n\nfax at 713-368-2219\n\nmail at P.O. Box 4663 - Houston, Texas 77210-4663\n\nQ.

If I miss a payment or do not make my payment before the monthly deadline, can I just start a new agreement?\n\nNo. You can only enter into one Payment Agreement per year. If you miss a payment, your agreement will be in default and will be voided.\n\nQ. What happens when my agreement is defaulted?\n\nOnce the agreement is defaulted, you must pay the full balance due on your account before the dates below:\n\nthe second business day in April for Business Personal Property\n\nthe first business day in July for Real Property\n\nIf you fail to do so, your account will be referred to a delinquent collection law firm and an additional 15%-20% penalty will be assessed on the total balance due on your account. Failure to pay the tax, once it has been referred to collection may also result in additional fees/costs and legal action up to and including seizure of the property.\n\nAdditionally, if you default on a Homestead Payment Agreement, you may not enter into another one for 24 months. If you default on an Installment Payment Agreement, you will not be able to enter into another until the balance due on your account is paid.\n\nQuarter Payment Plans\n\nQ. Who is eligible for a Quarter Payment Plan?\n\nThose who have an over 65 or disabled exemption or the surviving spouse of a disabled veteran may request to pay their property taxes in 4 equal payments without penalty and interest.\n\nQ.

What is a Statement of Ownership?\n\nA Statement of Ownership is a declaration of the information in the state records. It identifies the make and model, year, size, wind zone, HUD Label and serial numbers, owner and lienholder for the manufactured home.\n\n2. How do I transfer ownership (title) of a manufactured home?\n\nChanges in ownership or location must be recorded with the Texas Department of Housing and Community Affairs - Manufactured Housing Division. Contact that office for a complete list of requirements.\n\nIn most cases, in addition to other requirements, the applicant must obtain from our office MHD FORM 1076 - Statement from the Tax Assessor-Collector, showing that taxes are paid through the date of sale.\n\n3. What is a Statement from the Tax Assessor-Collector?\n\nThis statement serves as confirmation that property taxes have been paid. It must be submitted to the State along with the Application for Statement of Ownership. This statement is also known as:\n\nStatement of No Taxes Due\n\nForm 1076\n\n18 month paid Statement\n\n32.03 Statement\n\n4. What must I pay in order to get an MHD FORM 1076-Statement from the Tax Assessor-Collector?\n\nThere is no fee for issuing this statement, however we cannot issue it until all of the following taxes are paid\n\nTo calculate your required tax payment, add all taxes owed for the following:\n\nThe taxes due for active tax liens\n\nThe taxes due for the previous calendar year\n\nIf the sale took place this year, you must also pay taxes for the current calendar year in advance, OR\n\nIf the tax bills for this year have not been calculated and mailed, you must pay an estimated tax amount.\n\nTo inquire about the taxes due on your particular manufactured home, submit a Manufactured Home Tax Inquiry Form or call us at (713) 274-8000.\n\n5. How can I get an estimate of this year’s taxes?\n\nSubmit a Manufactured Home Tax Inquiry Form or call us at (713) 274-8000. In most cases, estimates are based on last year’s taxes.\n\n6.

For payment options, see Step C of question 7.\n\n7. How do I request MHD FORM 1076-Statement from the Tax Assessor-Collector?\n\nCalculate your required tax payment as described in question 4.\n\nComplete a Manufactured Home Tax Inquiry Form.

Approximate processing time is 1 hour per manufactured home.\n\nNote: There is no on-site parking at this location. Please allow sufficient time for parking plus processing.\n\n8. Why do I have to pre-pay this year’s taxes in order to title a manufactured home?\n\nPursuant to Texas Occupations Code chapter 1201.206 (g) and Texas Property Tax Code section 32.03 (a-2), a person may not transfer ownership of a manufactured home until all recorded tax liens have been released and all taxes which accrued within the 18 months preceding the date of the sale have been paid.\n\nSince tax liability is incurred on the 1st day of the year, you must pay the current year’s taxes, if the sale occurs on or after the 1st day of the year.\n\n9. How do I request the release of a manufactured home tax lien?\n\nCalculate the required tax payment. Before the lien can be released for a delinquent tax year, the taxes for that particular year must be paid in full. To find out if taxes are due for your manufactured home, you can:\n\nsearch the account record on our website\n\ncall (713) 274-8000 or\n\nsubmit a Manufactured Home Tax Inquiry Form. Select the 4th item in the Check Requested Items section of the form.\n\nComplete a Manufactured Home Tax Inquiry Form. Select the 4th item in the Check Requested Items section.\n\nSubmit the required tax payment along with the inquiry form. For instructions see Step C in question 7 above.\n\n10.

I just updated my Statement of Ownership (title). Do I have to do anything else?\n\nYes, you should contact the Appraisal District to update their records and inquire about residential exemptions.\n\n12. I purchased a manufactured home last year. Why haven’t I received a tax bill?\n\nChanges to the Statement of Ownership are not automatically updated to the appraisal roll. The property owner is responsible for informing the Appraisal District of any changes in ownership or location.\n\nIf the home moves from one county to another, you should inform the appraisal districts of both counties.\n\n13. Why is your office suing me for delinquent taxes, when I sold this manufactured home several years ago?\n\nOur delinquent tax attorneys pursue collection from the persons shown as the owners in the Harris Central Appraisal District record and from the owners reflected in the records of the Texas Department of Housing and Community Affairs.\n\nYou must report the ownership change with the Appraisal District and update the ownership record with the State in order to have your name removed as the owner of record.\n\n14. Can my manufactured home be sold due to unpaid taxes?\n\nYes. A lawsuit for tax lien foreclosure can be filed and a judgment subsequently granted by the court. The attorneys can then proceed with the Tax Sale.\n\n15. Why is your office sending me two bills for the same manufactured home?\n\nIf your manufactured home has been in Harris County since before 2010, you may have two account numbers for the same home. To determine the total tax amount due, you must add the amounts for both accounts.\n\nIn 2010, the tax office changed the numbers for all existing personal property manufactured home accounts.\n\nThe 2009 and prior year taxes remained on the old account numbers, which begin with a “3”.\n\nThe 2010 and later years were assigned the Harris Central Appraisal District account numbers, which begin with “600000”.\n\nOur office staff can help you determine if this is the reason you received two tax bills or if there is another explanation. For assistance, please call us at (713) 274-8000.\n\n16. Can your office release the school tax lien on my manufactured home?\n\nThe Harris County Tax Office can only release the liens filed by the jurisdictions for which we collect.\n\nWe can release tax liens for the Houston, Katy, Deer Park, and the former North Forest Independent School Districts. If you live in another school district, you must contact the tax collector for that district."
