        "text": "Architect: Orlopp & Kusener.\n\nYear Built: 1892.\n\nThe historic Dallas County Courthouse is located in Dallas, Texas. It is the SIXTH courthouse to sit on the present site. All prior courthouses wholly or partially burned. The “Old Red” Courthouse currently serves as a museum dedicated to the history of Dallas County.\n\nIn 1966 Old Red was replaced by a newer courthouse building nearby. This Romanesque courthouse with its many spires reminds me of a fairy castle. Its Wyvern (Gargoyles) are fascinating and have an Asian flair to them.\n\nWatch the “Old Red” video below:\n\nA look at the clock tower’s operation"
