Birx\n\nA few years ago, the name Dr. Deborah Birx may have been unfamiliar to some, however, after being appointed to the White House Coronavirus Task Force, Dr. Birx quickly became a prominent figure in the midst of the global health crisis\n\nAfter earning her medical degree from Pennsylvania State University, Birx served as an active-duty officer in the United States Army as the Director of the US Military HIV Research Program at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research. She also served within the Department of Defense and the Walter Reed Army Medical Center where she ultimately ascended to Colonel\n\nIn 2014, Dr. Birx was appointed by former President Barack Obama as the Ambassador-at-Large and U.S. Global AIDS Coordinator as part of the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief program, where she served for seven years. Her role has focused on the areas of HIV/AIDS immunology, vaccine research, and global health issues around HIV/AIDS. As part of her work with HIV prevention, Birx created a program called DREAMS (Determined, Resilient, Empowered, AIDS-free, Mentored and Safe), a public-private partnership focused on reducing infection rates among adolescent girls and young women.\n\nIn February 2020, Dr. Birx left her post as the U.S. Global AIDS coordinator to join the White House Coronavirus Task Force under former President Trump. Serving as the Coronavirus Response Coordinator, Dr. Birx drew on her years of experience fighting HIV/AIDs globally, to become one of the leading voices on the stage during the White House’s nightly briefings. Of the 27 members of the White House Coronavirus Task Force, Dr. Deborah Birx was one out of the two female advisors to a nearly all-male task force, with the exception of administrator Seema Verme\n\nSince leaving the White House earlier this year, Birx has taken on several roles in the private sector: senior fellow at the George W. Bush Institute; a member of the board of directors of the pharmaceutical company Innoviva; and chief medical and scientific adviser for ActivePure Technologies, a Dallas-based air filtration company\n\nTEAMMATE TUESDAY!\n\nHappy birthday to Anita Laroussi who had a birthday on March 28th.\n\nWishing Sherri Munn a happy birthday!
