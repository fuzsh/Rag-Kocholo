        "text": "Dallas has always been home to a diverse community. However, with the last few years passing by the gentrification of many Hispanic communities has been disheartening and many families are losing their homes and being displaced to make room for newer condos and apartments. I do hope that some of the historical homes are able to keep their spot and continue to show the history of Dallas while remaining beautiful.\n\nI love the mix of people and diversity, and how the county caters to those differences. It is easy to attend an event and learn more about our neighbors and area. I also love the moderate pace of the city; it is quicker than a small town but not too much hustle and bustle that I feel lost. I love the number of opportunities that are provided for work and the ability to have options and properly shop around."
