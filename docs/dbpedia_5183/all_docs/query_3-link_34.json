        "text": "Founding\n\nOn March 3, 1891, Hugh Cale, an African American representative in the N.C. General Assembly from Pasquotank County, sponsored House Bill 383, which established a normal (teaching) school for “teaching and training teachers of the colored race to teach in the common schools of North Carolina.” The bill passed, and the origin of Elizabeth City State University was born. The institution’s first name was Elizabeth City State Colored Normal School (1891-1939).\n\nEarly Leadership\n\nThe first leader, Peter W. Moore, was called a principal (subsequent leaders would be called President, then Chancellor). Moore served as Principal and then President until his retirement as President, Emeritus, on July 1, 1928. During his tenure, enrollment increased from 23 to 355 and the faculty from two to 15 members. During the tenure of the second president, John Henry Bias, the institution was elevated from a two-year normal school to a four-year teachers’ college (1937). Two years later, the institution’s name was officially changed to Elizabeth City State Teachers College (1939-1963). The growth and elevation to teachers’ college changed the mission to include training elementary school principals for rural and city schools. The first Bachelor of Science degrees in elementary education were awarded in May of 1939.\n\nContinued Growth\n\nBetween 1959 and 1963, the institution became more than a teaching college, adding 11 academic majors to the original elementary education major. In 1961, the college joined the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools accrediting group (SACS) and maintains its accreditation with that body to the present. In 1963, the N.C. General Assembly changed the institution’s name from Elizabeth City State Teachers College to Elizabeth City State College (1963-1969) and on, July 1, 1969, the college became Elizabeth City State University. In 1971, the General Assembly redefined the University of North Carolina system with 16 public institutions, including ECSU. Together, those institutions became constituents of The University of North Carolina (July 1972).\n\nToday\n\nAcademics. Currently ECSU offers over 30 academic programs of study. From business to music to aviation and education, ECSU prepares students to compete in the global work force. We achieve our commitment to the highest quality education by maintaining a rigorous focus on academic excellence through liberal arts pro­grams and using innovative and flexible technology-based instruction models to enhance our signature areas: integrating technology with education, improving human health and wellness, and advancing the natural and aviation sciences. As of May 2019, undergraduate and/or graduate degrees have been conferred upon more than 20,000 students.\n\nRankings. Over the years, the university has risen in national rankings. ECSU has earned acclaim for its advancements: U.S. News & World Report ranks ECSU No. 5 in Top Public Schools in the Regional South, No.16 in Top Performers in Social Mobility, No. 19 in Top HBCUs, and No. 6 Best Colleges for Veterans (2023-2024). Wash­ington Monthly ranks ECSU No. 2 for Top 200 Bachelor’s Colleges and No. 12 Best Bang for the Buck Southeast Colleges (2023).\n\nOn July 1, 2024, Dr. Catherine Edmonds appointed Interim Chancellor by UNC System President Peter Hans.\n\nPresidents/Chancellors History\n\nHUGH CALE\n\nFounding Father\n\n1835-1910\n\nPETER WEDDICK MOORE, A.M., LL.D\n\nPrincipal, 1891-1928\n\nPresident Emeritus, 1928-1934\n\nJOHN HENRY BIAS, A.B., LL.D\n\nPresident, 1928-1939\n\nHAROLD LEONARD TRIGG\n\nPresident, 1939-1945\n\nSIDNEY DAVID WILLIAMS, A.M., D.PED.\n\nPresident, 1946-1958\n\nPresident Emeritus, 1969-1974\n\nWALTER NATHANIEL RIDLEY, ED.D.\n\nPresident, 1958-1968\n\nPresident Emeritus, 1988-1996\n\nMARION DENNIS THORPE, PH.D.\n\nPresident, 1968-1972\n\nChancellor, 1972-1983\n\nJIMMY RAYMOND JENKINS, PH.D.\n\nChancellor, 1983-1995\n\nChancellor Emeritus, 1995 -\n\nMICKEY LYNN BURNIM, PH.D.\n\nChancellor, 1995-2006\n\nChancellor Emeritus, 2019 -\n\nWILLIE JAMES GILCHRIST, ED.D\n\nChancellor, 2007-2013\n\nCHARLES L.
