CHECK BACK OFTEN . . .\n\nCOUNTY INFORMATION In 1845 voters in the future Dallas County approved the annexation of Texas to the United States by a vote of 29 to 3. On March 30, 1846, Dallas County was officially formed by order of the state legislature from portions of Nacogdoches and Robertson counties, and named probably for George Mifflin Dallas, vice president of the United States under James K. Polk . At Dallas, the temporary county seat, a log cabin was built to serve as a courthouse. In 1850 an election was held to find a permanent county seat.\n\nIn 1861, since Dallas County was the food-producing center for North Texas, the Confederate government established a general quartermaster's and commissary headquarters for the army of the Trans-Mississippi Department there.\n\nThroughout its history Dallas County had a vigorous Hispanic population, but it was difficult to detect in official records because until the 1960s Mexican Americans were listed as white in the census and were not enumerated as a separate group.\n\nPhoto by Joe Mabel CC BY-SA 3.0 FORMER DALLAS COUNTY COURTHOUSE - \"OLD RED\"\n\nCITIES AND MUNICIPALITIES\n\n* Carrollton * Cedar Hill * Combine * Coppell * Dallas (county seat) * Garland * Glenn Heights *\n\n* Grand Prairie * Grapevine * Mesquite * Richardson * Rowlett * Sachse * Seagoville * Balch Springs * Cockrell Hill * DeSoto * Duncanville * Farmers Branch * Hutchins * Irving * Lancaster * Oak Cliff * University Park * Wilmer * Addison * Highland Park * Plano * Sunnyvale * Sand Branch *\n\nHistorical Communities\n\nAlpha (not incorporated)\n\nBuckingham (Annexed by Richardson in 1996)\n\nCedar Springs (Annexed by Dallas - First Settled in February 1841.
