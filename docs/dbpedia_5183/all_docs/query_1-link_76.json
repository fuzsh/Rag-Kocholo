        "text": "Fair Park was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1986.\n\nFair Park covers 277-acres just east of downtown Dallas. Its cultural, historical and entertainment venues play host to visitors from around the world every day of the year.\n\nThe park opened in 1886 with what was called the Dallas State Fair. Several structures, including the Centennial Building and Cotton Bowl Stadium, made their debut on the grounds between 1900 and 1930.\n\nBut Fair Park really became a part of the nation’s consciousness in 1936, when state leaders chose it to host a world’s fair commemorating the 100th anniversary of the Texas Republic. Texas' history, economy, flora, and fauna were highlighted in the buildings, statues, and murals designed for the event. Architects and artists came from all over the world to design a variety of elements that would establish the unique Art Deco throughout Fair Park.\n\nToday, Fair Park stands as the only intact and unaltered pre-1950s world fair site in the United States. Between the art deco and architecture, the history, and the events, Fair Park reflects an all-in-one, unique destination to visit for all."
