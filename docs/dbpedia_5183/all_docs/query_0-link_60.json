        "text": "Compensation costs for private industry workers increased 3.9 percent in Dallas-Fort Worth, TX-OK, Combined Statistical Area (CSA) for the year ended June 2024, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported today. Assistant Commissioner for Regional Operations Michael Hirniak noted that one year ago, Dallas experienced an annual gain of 4.1 percent in compensation costs. (See chart 1 and table 1.) Locally, wages and salaries, the largest component of compensation costs, advanced at a 3.9-percent pace for the 12-month period ended June 2024. (See chart 2.) Nationwide, compensation costs rose 3.9 percent and wages and salaries rose 4.1 percent over the same period.\n\nDallas is 1 of 15 metropolitan areas in the United States and 1 of 5 areas in the South region of the country for which locality compensation cost data are available. Among these 15 largest areas, over-the-year percentage changes in compensation costs ranged from 5.6 percent in Miami-Fort Lauderdale-Port St. Lucie to 3.1 percent in Boston-Worcester-Providence in June 2024; for wages and salaries Miami registered the largest increase (6.6 percent), and Philadelphia-Reading-Camden registered the smallest (3.2 percent). (See chart 3.)\n\nThe annual increase in compensation costs in Dallas was 3.9 percent in June 2024, compared to advances that ranged from 5.6 percent to 4.3 percent in the four other metropolitan areas in the South (Miami, Houston-The Woodlands, Washington-Baltimore-Arlington, and Atlanta-Athens-Clarke County-Sandy Springs). Dallas’ 3.9-percent gain in wages and salaries over this 12-month period compared to rates ranging from 6.6 percent to 4.9 percent in the four other southern localities. (See table 2.)\n\nThe Employment Cost Index for September 2024 is scheduled to be released on Thursday, October 31, 2024, at 7:30 a.m. (CT).\n\nTechnical Note\n\nLocality compensation costs are part of the national Employment Cost Index (ECI), which measures quarterly changes in compensation costs (wages and salaries and employer costs for employee benefits) free from the influence of employment shifts among occupations and industries. More information can be found in the national Employment Cost Index Technical Note. For information on survey concepts, coverage, methods, nonresponse adjustment, and imputation see the National Compensation Measures Handbook of Methods.\n\nIn addition to the data presented here, ECI national data by industry, occupational group, and union status, as well as data for civilian, private, and state and local government employees, are available on the Employment Cost Index website. The national Employment Cost Index Summary is also available online. Additional information for regions, states, and local areas may be accessed via our Southwest Information Office regional homepage.\n\nThe substate area data published in this news release reflect the Office of Management and Budget Bulletin No. 13-01, dated February 28, 2013. See the Classification Systems Used by the National Compensation Survey for more information on available geographies.\n\nDallas-Fort Worth, TX-OK CSA includes Collin, Cooke, Dallas, Denton, Ellis, Grayson, Henderson, Hood, Hopkins, Hunt, Johnson, Kaufman, Navarro, Palo Pinto, Parker, Rockwall, Somervell, Tarrant, and Wise Counties in Texas and Bryan County in Oklahoma.\n\nInformation in this release will be made available to individuals with sensory impairments upon request.
