Bednarek.\n\nThe dates were verified using information provided by M. Montes on various websites, including:\n\na page of the frequency of the date of Easter for the first 400 years in the Gregorian Calendar (https://www.smart.net/~mmontes/freq3.html),\n\na page of the frequency of the date of Easter for a 250 year period (https://www.smart.net/~mmontes/freq3.html), and\n\nan application which generates the ecclesiastical calendar for any year after 325 AD (https://www.smart.net/~mmontes/ec-cal.html).\n\nAnother page on this website gives the frequency of occurrence of the date of (Western) Easter for this 500 year period. These frequencies were used to generate the calendar means used by the most recent version of X-13ARIMA-SEATS to deseasonalize the Easter flow regressor generated by the software."
