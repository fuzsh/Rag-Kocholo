(Saturday, February 3, and Sunday, February 4, 2024 are the 10th and 11th days before the first day the committee may meet.) The notice must remain posted continuously for at least 10 days before the first day the committee meets. The notice must be posted on the county’s website if the county maintains a website. If the county does not maintain a website, the notice must be posted on the commissioners court bulletin board. (Sec. 87.027).\n\nMonday, February 5, 2024 (29th day before primary election day)\n\nLast day to register to vote or make a change of address effective for the Tuesday, March 5, 2024 primary election. (Secs. 13.143, 15.025).\n\nNOTE - A Federal Postcard Application (FPCA) also serves as an application for permanent registration under Texas law unless the voter marked “my intent to return is uncertain” (2019 form (PDF)), or “my return is uncertain” (2017 form). The early voting clerk should make a copy (for mailing ballots, keeping records, etc.), then should forward the original to the county voter registrar, as soon as practicable. (Sec. 101.055; 1 T.A.C. § 81.40(a), (c)(2)).\n\nDeadline for early voting clerk to mail a ballot by mail to a voter if the voter's Application for Ballot by Mail (ABBM) was accepted by the early voting clerk on or before Sunday, January 28, 2024. (Sec. 86.004(a)).\n\nNote - In regards to mail ballots for other voters (not military voters using an FPCA or overseas voters using an FPCA or ABBM), the early voting clerk must mail a ballot not later than the 7th day after the later of: (1) the date the early voting clerk has accepted a voter’s application for a ballot by mail or (2) the date the ballots become available for mailing. However, if the 7th day falls earlier than the 37th day before election day (Sunday, January 28), the voter’s mail ballot must be mailed no later than the 30th day (Sunday, February 4) before election day. (Sec. 86.004(a)). This means that for every application that is accepted by the early voting clerk before the 37th day before election day, the balloting materials must be mailed by the 30th day before election day. Any application that comes in after the 37th day before election day will follow the 7-day timeline in Section 86.004.\n\nWednesday, February 7, 2024 (5th day after recommended date to order signature verification committee)\n\nIf the early voting clerk issues order calling for appointment of signature verification committee, this is the deadline for the county chair to appoint the members to the committee.

The party may post the notice on the party’s website, if the party maintains a website.\n\nNOTE - The recommended time to include the notice of accepting voters with certain disabilities on a county’s website is when the notice of election is also posted on the website. (Secs. 63.0015, 85.007(d)). See Note 15 regarding notice (PDF) on accepting voters with certain disabilities.\n\nLast day to post notice of election on bulletin board used for posting notices of meetings of governing body. (Sec. 4.003(b)). A Record of Posting Notice of Election (PDF) should be completed at the time of posting. (Sec. 4.005). See Note on Notice of Elections.\n\nNOTE: Section 172.1112 requires the county to post the notice of election and notice of consolidated precincts on the county’s website if the county maintains a website.\n\nNOTE: Section 172.1112 requires that the county election officer, rather than the county chair, post the notice of election for the primary election.\n\nNOTE - Section 4.009 of the Code requires a county to post certain information on its website for elections held by a county or elections for any local political subdivision in which the county has contracted to provide election services. While these statutory web posting requirements do not specifically apply to primary elections, we strongly recommend that you post this information for any primary election in which the county has contracted to provide election services. Accordingly, the following information should be posted on the county’s website not later than the 21st day before election day:\n\nThe date of the election;\n\nThe location of each polling place;\n\nEach candidate for an elected office on the ballot; and\n\nEach measure on the ballot. (Sec. 4.009).\n\nWednesday, February 14, 2024 (20th day before primary election day; 5th day before the first day of early voting)\n\nDeadline for a person who is not permanently registered to vote to submit a postmarked FPCA, in order to receive a full ballot by mail for the March 5, 2024 primary election. A person who is not permanently registered to vote and submits a postmarked FPCA after this date (20th day) and before the deadline to submit an application for ballot by mail, is not entitled to receive a ballot for any non-federal election. See Tuesday, February 20, 2024 entry for timeliness of an FPCA received without a postmark. (Secs. 101.052(e), 101.052(i)(2)).\n\nNOTE – Section 101.052 of the Code provides that an FPCA may be submitted by in-person delivery by the voter in accordance with Section 84.008 of the Code or by common or contract carrier.\n\nNOTE – Section 101.001 of the Code provides that a member of the Texas National Guard or the National Guard of another state or a member of a reserve component of the armed forces of the United States serving on active duty under an order of the President of the United States or activated on state orders, or the spouse or dependent of a member, may submit an FPCA.\n\nNOTE - Be sure to check the list of registered voters for permanent registration status. Also, state law authorizes an FPCA to also serve as an application for permanent registration; therefore, the person might be permanently registered based on a prior FPCA. Even if the FPCA arrives too late for a particular election, the early voting clerk will still need to forward the original FPCA to the county voter registrar, after making a copy for your early voting clerk’s use (mailing ballots, etc.) and records unless the voter marked “my intent to return is uncertain” (2019 form (PDF)), or “my return is uncertain” (2017 form) in which case, it will not serve as a permanent registration. (Sec. 101.055; 1 T.A.C. § 81.40).\n\nNOTE - Overseas (non-military) voters marking the FPCA “my intent to return is uncertain” (2019 form (PDF)), or “my return is uncertain” (2017 form (PDF)) receive a federal ballot only regardless of the date filed. (Chapter 114). In a local (non-federal) election, this means there is no ballot to send the voter.\n\nLast day to publish notice of L&A test if test will be held on Friday, February 16, 2024, if testing was not already completed by January 17, 2024. Notice of the public L&A Test must be published at least 48 hours before the test begins. The notice must be posted on the county’s website if the county maintains a website. If the county does not maintain a website, the notice must be posted on the commissioners court bulletin board. Additionally, for a primary election, the custodian must notify the county chair of the test 48 hours prior to the test. The county chair is required to confirm receipt of the notice. (Secs. 129.001, 129.023). See Note 12, above.\n\nFirst day that the signature verification committee, if one is appointed, may begin operating. (Sec. 87.027).\n\nNOTE – For more information on corrective action procedures, see Note 17.\n\nLast day to post branch early voting schedule, which should be posted continuously from the fifth day before the start of the early voting period until the last day of the early voting period. The schedule must include the location of each permanent and temporary branch early voting location, and the dates and hours that voting will be conducted at temporary branch locations. The schedule may also include the dates and hours of any weekend or extended early voting that will be conducted at permanent or temporary branch locations. (Sec. 85.067).\n\nNOTE: This schedule may be amended after posting to include additional temporary branch locations or additional dates and hours at those locations. If any locations, dates, or hours are added, then the amended schedule must be posted at least five days before the start of voting at those additional locations or at least five days before the additional or extended hours at existing locations. (Sec. 85.067).\n\nThursday, February 15, 2024 — Friday, February 23, 2024 (19th — 11th day before primary election day)\n\nA person submitting an FPCA (PDF) during this period who is not registered to vote is not entitled to receive a full ballot for the March 5, 2024 primary election. This means that a person submitting an FPCA during this period is entitled to receive a federal ballot only (no state, district, or county offices), if not already a permanent registered voter. (Secs. 101.052(f), 114.002, 114.004). See entry below under Tuesday, February 20, 2024 (FPCA without a postmark). (Secs. 101.052(f), 114.004(c)).\n\nThe early voting clerk is required to maintain a copy of this application since it may be used for other elections and forward the original to the voter registrar. (Secs. 84.007, 101.052(e), (f)).\n\nNOTE - Be sure to check the list of registered voters for permanent registration status. Also, state law authorizes an FPCA to also serve as an application for permanent registration; therefore, the person might be permanently registered based on a prior FPCA. Even if the FPCA arrives too late for a particular election, the early voting clerk will still need to forward the original FPCA to the county voter registrar, after making a copy for your early voting clerk’s use (mailing ballots, etc.) and records unless the voter marked “my intent to return is uncertain” (2019 form (PDF)), or “my return is uncertain” (2017 form) in which case, it will not serve as a permanent registration. (Sec. 101.055, 1 T.A.C. § 81.40).\n\nNOTE - Overseas (non-military) voters marking the FPCA “my intent to return is uncertain” (2019 form (PDF)), or “my return is uncertain” (2017 form) receive a federal ballot only regardless of the date filed. (Chapter 114).\n\nSaturday, February 17, 2024 (17th day before primary election; 48 hours before start of early voting in person)\n\nLast day to conduct public L&A test of a voting system. We highly recommend that this test is done on an earlier date to allow time for corrections to programming, if necessary. (See Note 12, above). Per Section 129.023, the L&A test shall be conducted not later than 48 hours before voting begins on such voting systems, assuming that the voting system will first be used for early voting in person.\n\nNOTE – Section 129.023 of the Code requires the general custodian of election records to demonstrate, using a representative sample of voting system equipment, that the source code\n\nof the equipment has not been altered. (Sec. 129.023(c-1)). See Tex. Sec'y of State Election Advisory No. 2022-30.\n\nMonday, February 19, 2024 (15th day before primary election day) (Presidents’ Day)\n\nBecause Monday, February 19, 2024 is Presidents’ Day, which is a legal holiday, early voting will not be conducted on this date. (Secs. 85.001(c), 85.005).\n\nTuesday, February 20, 2024 (14th day before primary election day)\n\nFirst day to vote early in person. (Sec. 85.001(a), (c)).\n\nNOTE - The early voting period for the general primary election begins 17 days prior to election day, but because the first day of the early voting period falls on a legal state holiday (Monday, February 19, 2024), it is extended to the next regular business day, Tuesday, February 20, 2024. (Sec. 85.001(c)).\n\nNOTE – Section 85.005 of the Code provides that early voting in person must be conducted at the main early voting location on each weekday of the early voting period that is not a legal state holiday and for a period of at least nine (9) hours, except that voting may not be conducted earlier than 6:00 AM or later than 10:00 PM.\n\nNOTE - Voting by limited ballot must be done during the early voting period at the main early voting polling place (or by mail). (Sec. 112.002(a)).\n\nIn a primary election, a certain number of temporary branch locations must be established depending on the population size of the county:\n\nin a county with a population of 400,000 or more, the commissioners court must establish one or more temporary polling places, other than the main early voting polling place, in each state representative district containing territory covered by the election;\n\nin a county with a population of 120,000 or more but less than 400,000, the commissioners court must establish one or more temporary polling places, other than the main early voting polling place, in each commissioners precinct containing territory covered by the election;\n\nin a county with a population of 100,000 or more but less than 120,000, the early voting clerk must establish one or more early voting polling places in each commissioners precinct for which the early voting clerk receives a timely filed written request by at least 15 registered voters of that precinct. (Sec. 85.062(d)).\n\nNOTE - NEW LAW: HB 1217 (2023, R.S.) amended Section 85.064 of the Code, effective September 1, 2023, to establish uniform early voting requirements for all counties regardless of population size. Any established temporary branch location must remain open for at least 8 hours on each of the days that voting is required to be conducted at the main early voting location. See Tex. Sec'y of State Election Advisory No. 2023-10.\n\nNOTE – Section 85.062 of the Code provides that the location of temporary branch polling places in an election in which countywide polling places are used must be determined with the same methodology that is used for the location of countywide polling places.\n\nNOTE – Section 61.002 of the Code provides that immediately before the opening of the polls on the first day of early voting and on election day, the presiding judge or alternate judge shall confirm that the public counters on each voting machine are set to zero and shall print the tape that shows that there are zero votes for each candidate or measure on the ballot. Each election judge and alternate judge shall sign the printed tapes.\n\nNOTE - NEW LAW: HB 1217 (2023, R.S.) amended Sections 85.005 and 85.006 of the Code, effective September 1, 2023, to modify the required weekend days and hours for early voting by personal appearance at the main early voting polling place for counties. House Bill 1217 removed the population threshold that required only counties above a certain population to provide extended weekend early voting hours for the primary election and the general election for state and county officers. House Bill 1217 also repealed the provision that required counties below a certain population threshold to provide extended weekend early voting in these elections if the early voting clerk received a written request submitted by at least 15 registered voters of the county. As a result, the same extended weekend early voting hours now apply to ALL counties regardless of their population for the primary election and the general election for state and county officers. Therefore, the county voter registrar’s office is required to remain open for providing voter registration information during the extended hours or weekend hours that the main early voting polling place is open for voting. (Secs. 12.004(d), 85.005(c), 85.006(e)). See Note 7 above.\n\nNOTE - The notice of precinct conventions must be posted continuously during the early voting period. Prior to opening the polls, the presiding judge of each precinct must post at each entrance to the building a notice of the time and place for convening the precinct, county, senatorial, and state conventions. This notice must remain posted continuously during the early voting period and on election day. (Sec. 172.1111).\n\nDeadline to receive an FPCA without a postmark. If an FPCA is received by this date without a postmark to prove mailing date, the early voting clerk will accept the FPCA and mail the applicant a full ballot even if the applicant is not a permanently registered voter but meets the requirements under Title 2 of the Election Code (unless the voter marks the FPCA form “my intent to return is uncertain” (2019 form (PDF)), or “my return is uncertain (2017 form), in which case the voter receives a federal-only ballot). (Secs. 101.052(i)(1), 1.006).\n\nLast day to notify election judges of duty to hold election Writ of Election (PDF). Notice must be given by the 15th day before the election or the 7th day after the day the election is ordered, whichever is later. The Writ of Election must be given to each presiding judge and include:\n\nThe judge’s duty to hold the election;\n\nThe type and date of election;\n\nThe polling place location at which the judge will serve;\n\nThe polling place hours; and\n\nThe maximum number of clerks the judge may appoint.

Voting may not be conducted earlier than 9:00 AM or later than 10:00 PM on the last Sunday of the early voting period. (Sec. 85.006). See Note 7.\n\nFirst day a voter who becomes sick or disabled on or after this date may submit an application for a late ballot if the sickness or physical condition prevents the voter from appearing at the polling place without the likelihood of needing personal assistance or of injuring his or her health. (Sec. 102.001). See Application for Emergency Early Voting Ballot Due to Sickness or Physical Disability (PDF). Applications may continue to be submitted until 5:00 PM on Election Day.

The early voting clerk’s designated email address must be posted on the Secretary of State’s website. (Sec. 84.007(e)).\n\nLast day to receive an FPCA (PDF) from a registered voter. If the voter is not registered in the county (and/or marked intent to return “uncertain”), the voter is still eligible for a ballot containing federal offices only. In a local (non-federal) election, this means there is no ballot to send the voter. (Secs. 101.052(b), (f), 114.004(c)).\n\nIf an ABBM is faxed or emailed or if an FPCA is faxed, then the applicant must submit the ORIGINAL application BY MAIL to the early voting clerk so that the early voting clerk receives the original no later than the 4th business day after receiving the emailed or faxed ABBM or faxed FPCA. If the early voting clerk does not receive the original ABBM or FPCA by that deadline, then the emailed or faxed ABBM or faxed FPCA will be considered incomplete, and the early voting clerk may NOT send the applicant a ballot. The requirement to mail the original application does not apply to an emailed FPCA.\n\nNOTE - A member of the Texas National Guard or the National Guard of another state or a member of a reserve component of the armed forces of the United States serving on active duty under an order of the President of the United States or activated on state orders, or the spouse or dependent of a member, may submit an FPCA. (Sec. 101.001).\n\nAn applicant for a ballot to be voted by mail (ABBM or FPCA) may submit the application by delivering it in person to the early voting clerk if the application is submitted not later than the close of regular business in the clerk’s office on Friday, February 23, 2024.

Further, an application is considered submitted in the following calendar year if: 1) the applicant is eligible to vote in an election occurring in January or February of the next calendar year; and 2) the application is submitted in the last 60 days of a calendar year but not earlier than the 60th day before the date of the January or February election. (Sec. 101.052).\n\nNOTE - Section 84.008 of the Code provides that an applicant for a ballot to be voted by mail may submit the application by delivering it in person to the early voting clerk if the application is submitted not later than the deadline provided by Section 84.007(c) of the Code. This means that voters may personally deliver their ABBM or FPCA to the early voting clerk not later than the close of regular business in the early voting clerk’s office or 12 noon, whichever is later, on the 11th day before election day (unless that day is a Saturday, Sunday, or legal state or national holiday, in which case the last day is the first preceding regular business day).\n\nNOTE - NEW LAW: SB 1599 (2023, R.S.) amended Section 86.008 of the Code, effective September 1, 2023, to require that if the early voting clerk determines that it would not be possible for the applicant to correct certain defects in a mail ballot application and return an application form by mail before the deadline, the clerk may notify the applicant by telephone or e-mail of the defect, and inform the applicant that the applicant may come to the early voting clerk’s office before the deadline and correct the defect in person.
