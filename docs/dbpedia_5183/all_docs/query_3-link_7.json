        "text": "National County Government Month (NCGM), held each April, is an annual celebration of county government. Since 1991, the National Association of Counties (NACo) has encouraged counties to actively promote county roles and responsibilities in serving residents. Counties can schedule activities any time during the month. NCGM is an excellent opportunity for your county to highlight effective or innovative county programs and raise public awareness of services provided to the community.\n\nThis year's National County Government Month theme is consistent with NACo President Mary Jo McGuire’s focus for the year, ForwardTogether.\n\nForwardTogether is about connecting, inspiring and leading – pillars of county government that build trust and drive towards solutions. Counties are encouraged to reflect on this theme as you choose how to celebrate NCGM. In particular, consider how NCGM is so intrinsically connected to the responsibility of county leaders to inspire our residents to take an interest in and engage with their communities, and how it presents an opportunity to lead in new and growing ways.\n\nEach April, we seize the opportunity provided by National County Government Month (NCGM) to elevate our work and teach residents about the importance of county government. The people living and working in our counties benefit from seeing how our work touches their lives, and learning about the broader framework of intergovernmental partnership wherein we deploy local, state, and federal programs on the ground.\n\nWhen developing your plans for this year’s NCGM, consider the pillars of the ForwardTogether platform:\n\nConnect, focused on building bridges to advance excellence and networks in county government,\n\nInspire, focused on driving community engagement and residents’ trust in county government, and\n\nLead, focused on spearheading local, state, federal and tribal intergovernmental partnerships and common-sense policy.\n\nThis NCGM, we will tell stories, share data and lift up work that speaks to those values. Spotlight your county's role in making life better for every single resident, and in contributing to the intergovernmental partnership that makes effective governing possible.\n\nAs you celebrate your finest programs, I also encourage you to nominate them for a NACo Achievement Award now through March 30, 2024.\n\nIn the spirit of NCGM, we celebrate you and thank you for your service and your commitment to helping counties move ForwardTogether!\n\nHon. Mary Jo McGuire\n\nNACo President\n\nCommissioner, Ramsey County, Minn.\n\nNational County Government Month is an ideal time to discuss national policy issues affecting county government with members of Congress who represent your county. Schedule a call with your congressional representative(s) or key staff in your congressional district office. Use the call to explain the great challenges facing your county and how Congress can help.\n\nMany important issues are being debated nationally that affect counties. Be prepared with facts and information about how specific federal issues affect your county. Know where your member of Congress stands on important issues and on which committees he or she serves. Your message should be focused, compelling and relevant.\n\nAdvocacy Hub\n\nNational County Government Month - April 2024\n\nWHEREAS, the nation’s 3,069 counties serving more than 330 million Americans provide essential services to create healthy, safe and vibrant communities; and\n\nWHEREAS, counties fulfill a vast range of responsibilities and deliver services that touch nearly every aspect of our residents’ lives; and\n\nWHEREAS, [INSERT YOUR COUNTY’S NAME] and all counties take pride in our responsibility to protect and enhance the health, wellbeing and safety of our residents in efficient and cost-effective ways; and\n\nWHEREAS, under the leadership of National Association of Counties President Mary Jo McGuire, NACo is highlighting county leadership through the lens ForwardTogether, celebrating the role of county governments in connecting, inspiring and leading as intergovernmental partners; and\n\nWHEREAS, that role includes a responsibility to inspire county residents to engage with their communities, and to lead by highlighting our strength as intergovernmental partners; and\n\nWHEREAS, each year since 1991 the National Association of Counties has encouraged counties across the country to elevate awareness of county responsibilities, programs and services; and\n\nWHEREAS, [INSERT COUNTY SPECIFIC INFO TO HIGHLIGHT]\n\nNOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED THAT I, [INSERT NAME & TITLE OF CHIEF ELECTED OFFICIAL], do hereby proclaim April 2024 as National County Government Month and encourage all county officials, employees, schools and residents to participate in county government celebration activities.\n\nCONTACT: Bea Candid\n\n(123) 456-7890\n\nbcandid@ablecounty.gov\n\nAble County to Celebrate National County Government Month\n\nLeaders to highlight county innovations in public health and safety, justice, other county programs\n\nEverytown, USA (April 1, 2024) — Able County will celebrate National County Government Month (NCGM) during the month of April to showcase how the county achieves healthy, safe and vibrant communities.\n\nThe theme for this year’s celebration of NCGM is “ForwardTogether,” inspired by the signature focus of National Association of Counties (NACo) President Mary Jo McGuire.
