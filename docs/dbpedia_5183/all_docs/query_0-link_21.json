L. Dyson, A. S. Lee, B. M. Fredrick, E. G. Rust, Mrs. Terry, Mrs. Russell, Mrs. E. G. Rust, Mrs. Webb, Mrs. Potts, Mrs. Penry, Mrs. Ingram, Mrs. Jerrell and others, who, by their kind and thoughtful attention, added much to the pleasure of the affair.\n\nA majority of the guests had lived their three score years and ten and several had seen the flowers of eighty summers blossom, while two had reached the good old age of ninety, which fact alone, made the affair of unusual interest. Many of them were old pioneers to the Lone Star state and related their experience of the \"early days\" at a little reunion after dinner, which not only proved enjoyable to the first settlers of Dallas, but the late ones as well.\n\nAmong them were Col. H. H. Curl, a Mississippian by birth, who came to Texas forty-five years ago, and who, though his hair is white with the changes of eighty seasons, is a bright, active and well preserved gentleman. Others were Messrs. J. Downs, S. B. Penry, Dr. E. H. Pratt, Dr. S. A. Mitchell.\n\nAmong the old ladies present were Mrs. Jane Phares, a Mississippian, 78 years of age, who came to Dallas 22 years ago; Mrs. Sarah Downs, also a Mississippian, who has lived in the country many years, and who says that she is 25 years younger than Abram was, when his son, Isaac, was born. Mrs. A. McAllister, born April 30, 1820, in Penn county, Virginia, and lived 23 years in Texas; Miss Margaret Toole, a Mississippian, who has lived in Texas 20 years; Miss Eliza McCoy, born in Indiana in 1813, and resided in Dallas 17 years; Dr. and Mrs. Mitchell, who came to Dallas county in 1847; Mrs. M. E. Jones, a native of Kentucky; Mrs. L. A. Wilson, a native of Tennessee, 68 years old, Mrs. E. H. Pratt, a native of Michigan, 82 years of age and many others.\n\n- August 14, 1891, Dallas Daily Times Herald, p. 7, col. 6.\n\n- o o o - 1913\n\nPioneer Texas Woman\n\nHas Birthday Today. Mrs. Sophie Koester.\n\nToday, Mrs. Sophie Koester will celebrate her eighty-seventh birthday at the home of her son-in-law, G. A. Eisenlohr, 1100 East Eighth street, Oak Cliff. Mrs. Koester is the widow of Dr. Theodore Koester, some years deceased, who was a leading physician and also a member of the Legislature during the war between the States from Comal county.\n\nIn 1845, when a young lady of 19 years, with her parents, settled on the beautiful stream known now as the Comal River with the German colony brought to Texas by Prince Salm Salm. All that region was a waste of beautiful prairie land, iridescent with flowers, over which buffalo, deer and antelope roamed at will. The wild Indians were there in abundance, too, and not infrequently, raids by Comanches, Lipans and other tribes made the lives of the settlers strenuous in the extreme. During the sixty-eight years of her life in Texas, Mrs. Koester has seen the Republic disappear, to give place to the State, and has seen the State grow from its primeval condition, the ox wagon era of sparse settlements and pioneer privations, into the splendid Commonwealth of this day, with its population running into the millions, its thriving cities, its railroads, its every modern utility, adjunct and beneficence of the higher civilization and advanced education.\n\nTen children blessed the lives of Mrs. Koester and her husband, but only three remain to her in her declining years--Mrs. G. A. Eisenlohr, Miss Elisa Koester, who with her resided in the home of G. A. Eisenlohr, in charge of the Government weather service in Dallas, and Harry G. Koester of San Antonio. Three grandchildren and two great-grandchildren also gladden her life. She is of a long lived family. In 1880, her parents celebrated, in Comal County, the sixtieth anniversary of their marriage, and Mr. Eisenlohr danced with the anniversary bride, who, at 85, was as spry as a maiden in her teens.\n\nMrs. Koester has lived twenty-three years in Dallas. She is active and cheerful, taking as keen a zest in life as in her younger days.\n\n- May 4, 1913. Dallas Morning News, Sec.

Many prominent pioneer families of Dallas were among the guests.\n\nENTERTAIN 500\n\nAT ROXANA FARM\n\n__________ MR. AND MRS. MUNZESHEIMER\n\nHOSTS AT BIG BARBECUE\n\nMr. and Mrs. Max Munzesheimer entertained about five hundred of their old friends with a picnic and barbecue at Roxana farm, near Letot Saturday. The event was made the occasion of the gathering of many pioneer families in Dallas county, among them being the Harriers, the Knights, the Hughes, the Dorans and many others.\n\nMayor Blaylock headed a delegation from the city hall, and Shelby Cox and Dan Harston from the courthouse. Emil Fretz brought his park board along and there were many others prominent in business and politics who gathered for the feast. Col. S. E. Moss was master of ceremonies and introduced the various speakers. Mr. and Mrs. Munzesheimer were presented with a handsome bouquet of flowers, the mayor making the presentation speech. A great concrete pit was piled high with barbecue meats of all kinds and tables were spread under the shade of great elm trees. There was plenty to go around and many baskets of food left over.\n\nBefore the dinner, the visitors were shown over a model farm, a part of which, is used for fruit demonstration work by Mr. Fechner, well known horticulturist. One of Mr. Munzesheimer's prize specimens is a variety of loganberry, which is successfully fruiting. The visitors nearly lost their appetites before the barbecue by eating dewberries, plums and peaches off the vines and trees. Several found poles and line and sneaked away to the private lake to spend the remainder of the afternoon. Albert Martino, famed as an amateur chef, saw the barbecuing was properly executed, but the big event was the serving of the pies baked under the personal supervision of Mrs. Munzesheimer.\n\n- June 1, 1924, Dallas Daily Times Herald, p. 10, col. 5-7.\n\n- o o o - 1925Dallas Pioneers\n\nPartial list compiled by The Times Herald of men and women who have lived in Dallas more than forty years.\n\nMrs. C.

Not only were letters received in every mail, but all day long, real pioneers of Dallas county called on him for the purpose of enrolling in The Times Herald Half-Century club. When records for the day were closed, forty-five additional members had been added to the club, making a total to date of 189.\n\nKeen interest was manifested in future plans for the club, and appreciation was expressed over the fact that the old settlers of Dallas and Dallas county are to be publicly honored for the part they have played in the upbuilding of the community.\n\nPlan Meeting Soon.\n\nWithin the next few days, it is planned to announce the time and place for the first meeting of the club, when all members will be dinner guests of The Times Herald. Permanent organization will be effected, officers elected and there will be a few short talks, in which tribute will be paid to the \"old-timers.\"\n\nArrangements are also being made to present each member with a suitably engraved gold emblem, the gift of Linz Bros.\n\nAmong the pioneers enrolling Saturday was J. M. Ramsey of Cedar Hill. Mr. Ramsey has lived for eighty years in Dallas county. He was born in Missouri, Sept. 17, 1843, and was brought to Dallas county two years later.\n\nMany Exceed Half-Century.\n\nOther new members who have lived in the county considerably beyond the half-century mark include: Mrs. P. A. Geeo, of Grand Prairie, with a record of seventy-five years, W. R. Hughes, 2911 Oak Lawn avenue, seventy-three years; Mrs. B. F. Emerson, Duncanville, seventy-two years; S. A. Story, Irving, sixty-seven years, and Mrs. Mary Peterman, 5132 Richard avenue.\n\nIn a letter to the Half-Century editor, Mrs. Peterman wrote: \"Since I was born in Dallas, sixty-six years ago, I would like very much to be listed as a member of your club. A woman does not like to tell her age, but I don't mind, especially for such a club The Times Herald is sponsoring.\"\n\nMr. Story told how his father came to the country from Ohio in 1849, and settled near the present site of Irving.\n\n\"In later years, my father made five trips to Illinois and Ohio in ox carts,\" Mr. Story said. \"He had thirteen brothers and sisters. Four of the brothers fought in the Mexican war and seven of them were in the Confederate army. When father died, four years ago, he left seventy-eight grandchildren and great-grandchildren.\"\n\nThree widely known Dallas brothers, born and raised here, joined the club Saturday. They were Epps G. Knight, R. E. L. Knight and A. J. Knight.\n\nList of Members.\n\nFollowing are the names and addresses of those who have enrolled as members of the Half-Century club, to date:\n\nCaptain June Peak, 4409 Worth street.\n\nGeorge M.

II, p. 2, col. 2-4.\n\n- o o o - SIX SISTERS JOIN TIMES\n\nHERALD HALF-CENTURY CLUB;\n\nMEMBERSHIP NOW TOTALS 282\n\nSix sisters, believed to form the largest unbroken family of pioneer daughters in Dallas county, enrolled in The Times Herald Half-Century club Saturday.\n\nThe oldest of the sextette is 74, the youngest 57. Four of the sisters have never resided outside of Dallas county. Two spent brief periods in other parts of the state, but have been in the county long enough to make them eligible to membership in the Half-Century club.\n\nThe six sisters, who are all living in Dallas at the present time, are: Mrs. Cannie Record, 74; Miss Ellen Thomas, 72; Mrs. Dick Baird, 70; Mrs. Dood Roberts, 67; Mrs. Bud Smith, 64; Mrs. Mollie Salmons, 57.\n\nClub to Exceed 300.\n\nIn addition to the sisters, twenty-nine other men and women sent in their applications for membership in the club. This batch of joiners hoists the membership quota up to 282. It is apparent that the membership will exceed the 300 mark before the club is formally organized at a meeting in Oak Lawn park on Thursday, September 24. On this day, at 10:30 o'clock in the morning, the organization will be formed. And, at 1 o'clock, a diner will be served to the members by The Times Herald.
