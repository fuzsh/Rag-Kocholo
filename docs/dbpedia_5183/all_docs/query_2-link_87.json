        "meta_description": "The U.S. Climate Normals are a large suite of data products that provide information about typical climate conditions for thousands of locations across the United States. Normals act both as a ruler to compare today’s weather and tomorrow’s forecast, and as a predictor of conditions in the near future. The official normals are calculated for a uniform 30 year period, and consist of annual/seasonal, monthly, daily, and hourly averages and statistics of temperature, precipitation, and other climatological variables from almost 15,000 U.S. weather stations.",

        "text": "Overview\n\nMost of the U.S. was warmer, and the eastern two-thirds of the contiguous U.S. was wetter, from 1991–2020 than the previous normals period, 1981–2010. The Southwest was considerably drier on an annual basis, while the central northern U.S. has cooled somewhat.\n\nThere are twenty years of overlap between the current normals and the previous iteration (1991–2010), which makes the annual changes between these two datasets somewhat muted compared to trends over the same period. Monthly and seasonal changes are more dynamic. For example, the current normals for the north-central U.S. are cooler in the spring, while much of the Southeast is now warmer in October, cooler in November, and warmer again in December. Atmospheric circulation dynamics and surface feedbacks result in substantial differences from month-to-month and region-to-region.\n\nCore Month Differences\n\nChanges during the core months of each season (January, April, July, and October) can be representative of broader differences between different normals iterations. The following examples illustrate the percent change in precipitation and the change in degrees Fahrenheit in maximum temperature for each core month.\n\nJanuary\n\nJanuary temperatures have risen in the new normals by 0.5–1.5°F across most of the country. The north-central region was a notable outlier that cooled by more than 1.0° F in some places, but generally follows annual cooling patterns. Outliers aside, this winter warming correlates with increased precipitation normals throughout much of the country, as warmer air can hold more water vapor during winter. This is especially true on the western and eastern edges of the cooler north-central zone, where precipitation increased by 10–25% in January. Texas and Florida were also notably wetter during 1991–2020.\n\nApril\n\nApril is the most dynamic core month, and exhibits a variety of significant changes in maximum temperature and precipitation. The maximum temperature normals are considerably lower in the north-central U.S. compared to the previous normals period. The entire northern tier is cooler, but changes reach more than -2°F in parts of the Dakotas. Cooling patches reach all the way to Louisiana, although the areas to the west and east of the Mississippi Valley have warmed considerably. The entire southeastern quarter of the U.S. is now considerably wetter in April, while the southwest is drier. Additional precipitation is also seen in the lee of the northern Rocky Mountains and the Great Lakes.\n\nJuly\n\nThe Northwest is considerably drier as a percentage of the previous normal during what is already a dry season. The rest of the West is pockmarked with wetter and drier zones. The eastern two-thirds of the U.S. has an indistinct pattern of changes in the precipitation normals. Most of the East also remained near the same temperature levels, except for persistent cooling in the north central U.S. and warming in the Northeast. However, the entire West and lee of the Rocky Mountains and Texas are all considerably (up to 2°) warmer.\n\nOctober\n\nA strong zonal pattern in the western two-thirds of the northern U.S. marked both wetter and cooler normals for 1991–2020 than 1981–2010. The rest of the country was consistently warmer, but the southwest and south-central U.S. were also drier. The East was warm and displayed alternating zones of wetter and drier conditions that were reminiscent of shifting storm tracks.\n\nOverall, the central month of each season displayed cooling normals in the north-central U.S. to varying degrees, most distinctly in April. Precipitation normals were generally wetter east of the Rockies, and drier in the central and southern West. While annual normals changes were generally consistent, the single months showed pattern shifts that indicate a relationship to repeated preference of certain upper air wind patterns and storm tracks that shifted north or south with the seasons. The patterns of normals changes are following spatial trends in climate circulation dynamics and surface feedbacks, but still demonstrate the warmer conditions expected in the U.S. overall and the reduction of precipitation in the West and increase in precipitation in the East as anticipated by models of future climate change\n\nMany long-time users of NCEI’s station-based normals wonder how the 1991-2020 values that were released in 2021 differ from the 1981-2010 values released in 2011. There are both climatic and non-climatic causes of differences between the two sets of normals. The large-scale climatic differences are illustrated by the comparison maps shown above for which the same set of monthly gridded data was used to calculate averages for both periods. The non-climatic differences arise primarily from the fact that the 1981-2010 normals were calculated from the 2011 version of NCEI’s data holdings, while the 1991-2020 normals are based on a version from early 2021 which incorporates additions and corrections made to the historical record over the previous decade. The 1981–2010 and 1991–2020 station normals use data that was homogenized at different times (2011 for the first time period, and 2021 for the second).\n\nHowever, station-based temperature comparisons based on this same set of station normals are not reliable, because the homogenization process that removes artificial discontinuities (station moves, instrument changes, etc.) from station temperature data applies those adjustments to the entire dataset. This process aligns the whole time series with current station site and instrument characteristics so that it can be compared to today’s measurements, but it also creates substantial differences between the 2021 and 2011 normals calculations.\n\nFor example, the maximum temperature record for the KOKC station developed a substantial warming deviation from other nearby stations during early 2017 (see KOCK Oklahoma City - January Maximum Temperature).\n\nThe discontinuity adjustment assigned was -0.68°C (-1.22°F) starting in April 2017, which was subtracted from previous Januaries in this example, until another discontinuity was found in 2003, causing a further adjustment. A comparison between the 1991–2020 normals and the 2011 version of the 1981–2020 normals would not recognize this change to the underlying temperature time series, and would give the incorrect impression that the station was getting cooler.\n\nTo address this concern, NCEI provides a set of derived 1981–2010 monthly maximum and minimum temperature normals for all stations in the U.S. that have overlapping normals calculations from both 2011 and 2021.\n\nComparison Files\n\nMonthly Maximum Temperature Normals Comparison Data (.csv)\n\nMonthly Minimum Temperature Normals Comparison Data (.csv)\n\nAnnual Temperature Normals Comparison Worksheet (.xlsx)\n\nFile Contents and Structure\n\nThe two .csv comparison files have all three data types. Files are arranged in the following structure:\n\nColumn 1: Station ID\n\nColumn 2: Two-letter state/territory code\n\nColumn 3: Station Name\n\nColumn 4: Month (1-12)\n\nColumn 5: Original 1981–2010 Normals (in tenths of °F)\n\nColumn 6: New 1981–2010 Normals (in tenths of °F)\n\nColumn 7: New 1991–2020 Normals (in tenths of °F)\n\nThe third file has a spreadsheet that compares annual maximum and minimum temperature normals between the three categories for quick station-to-station comparisons. Columns are labelled and normals are in tenths of degrees F.\n\nNote: These new 1981–2010 temperature calculations are not a complete set of temperature related normals; only monthly maximum and minimum temperatures are provided. These new maximum and minimum temperature normals are not meant to replace the 1981–2010 normals if those are required by a regulatory body or for official business. Their only purpose is to compare station temperature normals properly using the same version of the underlying homogenized temperature data set for both periods. These data will render an equivalent comparison that accurately reflects the temperature change between the two latest normals time intervals."
